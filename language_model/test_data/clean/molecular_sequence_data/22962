To clarify the structure of the porcine genomic region that contains quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to fat, we constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contig of the region from DST to SRPK1 on porcine chromosome 7 and performed low-redundancy 'skim' shotgun sequencing of the clones that composed a minimum tiling path of the contig. This analysis revealed that the gene order from VPS52 to SRPK1 is conserved between human and swine and that comparison with the human sequence identified a rearrangement in the swine genome at the proximal end of VPS52. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences of three BAC clones that included the rearrangement point demonstrated that COL21A1 and DST, which were not present in the corresponding human region, were located adjacent to the rearrangement point. These results provide useful information about the genomic region containing QTL for fat in pigs and help to clarify the structure of the so-called 'extended-class II' region distal to the porcine major histocompatibility complex class II region.
