Related outer membrane proteins, termed secretins, participate in the secretion of macromolecules across the outer membrane of many Gram-negative bacteria. In the pullulanase-secretion system, PulS, an outer membrane-associated lipoprotein, is required both for the integrity and the proper outer membrane localization of the PulD secretin. Here we show that the PulS-binding site is located within the C-terminal 65 residues of PulD. Addition of this domain to the filamentous phage secretin, pIV, or to the unrelated maltose-binding protein rendered both proteins dependent on PulS for stability. A chimeric protein composed of bacteriophage f1 pIV and the C-terminal domain of PuID required properly localized PulS to support phage assembly. An in vivo complex formed between the pIV-PulD65 chimera and PulS was detected by co-immunoprecipitation and by affinity chromatography.
