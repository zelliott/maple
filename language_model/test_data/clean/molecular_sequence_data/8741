Reverse transcription of a retroviral RNA genome requires two template jumps to generate the linear double-stranded DNA required for integration. The RNase H activity of reverse transcriptase has several roles during this process. We have examined RNase H cleavages that define the maximal 3' and 5' ends of Moloney murine leukemia virus minus strand DNA prior to the second template jump. In both the endogenous reaction and on model substrates in vitro, RNase H cleaves the genomic RNA template between the second and third ribonucleotides 5' of the U5/PBS junction, but other minor cleavages between 1 and 10 nucleotides 5' of this junction are also observed. Similar experiments examining the specificity of RNase H for tRNA primer removal revealed that cleavage generally leaves a ribo A residue at the 5' end of minus strand DNA. These observations suggest that three bases are typically duplicated on the ends of the minus strands, leading to an intermediate following the second jump which contains unpaired nucleotides. Model substrates mimicking the structure of this intermediate demonstrate that reverse transcriptase has little difficulty in utilizing such a branched structure for the initiation of displacement synthesis.
