Two regulatory genes encoding a Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein (vmsS) and a response regulator (vmsT) of a bacterial two-component signal transduction system are present in the left-hand region of the biosynthetic gene cluster of the antibiotic virginiamycin, which is composed of virginiamycin M (VM) and virginiamycin S (VS), in Streptomyces virginiae. Disruption of vmsS abolished both VM and VS biosynthesis, with drastic alteration of the transcriptional profile for virginiamycin biosynthetic genes, whereas disruption of vmsT resulted in only a loss of VM biosynthesis, suggesting that vmsS is a pathway-specific regulator for both VM and VS biosynthesis, and that vmsT is a pathway-specific regulator for VM biosynthesis alone. Gene expression profiles determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR on the virginiamycin biosynthetic gene cluster demonstrated that vmsS controls the biosynthetic genes for VM and VS, and vmsT controls unidentified gene(s) of VM biosynthesis located outside the biosynthetic gene cluster. In addition, transcriptional analysis of a deletion mutant of vmsR located in the clustered regulatory region in the virginiamycin cluster (and which also acts as a SARP-family activator for both VM and VS biosynthesis) indicated that the expression of vmsS and vmsT is under the control of vmsR, and vmsR also contributes to the expression of VM and VS biosynthetic genes, independent of vmsS and vmsT. Therefore, coordinated virginiamycin biosynthesis is controlled by three pathway-specific regulators which hierarchically control the expression of the biosynthetic gene cluster.
