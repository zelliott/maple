Using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) procedure, we have determined the complete nucleotide sequence for the cDNA encoding rat eosinophil cationic protein (ECP)/eosinophil-associated ribonuclease (EAR). The deduced amino acid sequence revealed that the molecular weight of rat preECP/EAR is 18.0 kDa and the isoelectric point is 9.85, indicating that rat ECP/EAR is highly cationic. The homology of amino acid sequence between rat ECP/EAR and human ECP is 54%, and that between rat ECP/EAR and human eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) is 51%. Rat ECP/EAR is also homologous to human ribonuclease k6 (homology 47%).
