In plants, the cation/H+ exchanger (CAX) translocates Ca2+ and other metal ions into vacuoles using the H+ gradient formed by H+-ATPase and H+-pyrophosphatase. Such exchangers carrying 11 transmembrane domains (TMs) have been isolated from plants, yeast, and bacteria. In this study, multiple sequence alignment of several CAXs revealed the presence of highly conserved 36-residue regions between TM3 and TM4 and between TM8 and TM9. These two repetitive motifs are designated repeats c-1 and c-2. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we generated 31 mutations in the repeats of the Oryza sativa CAX, which translocates Ca2+ and Mn2+. Mutant exchangers were expressed in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain that is sensitive to Ca2+ and Mn2+ because of the absence of vacuolar Ca2+-ATPase and the Ca2+/H+ exchanger. Mutant exchangers were classified into six classes according to their tolerance for Ca2+ and Mn2+. For example, the class III mutants had no tolerance for either ion, and the class IV mutants had tolerance only for Ca2+. The biochemical function of each residue was estimated. We investigated the membrane topology of the repeats using a method combining cysteine mutagenesis and sulfhydryl reagents. Our results suggest that repeat c-1 re-enters the membrane from the vacuolar luminal side and forms a solution-accessible region. Furthermore, several residues in repeats c-1 and c-2 were found to be conserved in animal Na+/Ca2+ exchangers. Finally, we suggest that these re-entrant repeats may form a vestibule or filter for cation selection.
