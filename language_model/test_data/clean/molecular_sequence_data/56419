An aberrant ferrochelatase mRNA lacking exon 10 was found in a patient with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). In her genomic DNA an A-->T transversion at position -3 of the donor site of intron 10 appeared to be responsible for the exon skipping. Both the patient and her sister were heterozygous for this mutation.
