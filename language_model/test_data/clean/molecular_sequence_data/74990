The human papovavirus JC virus (JCV) was analyzed for the presence of unusual DNA conformations. Recombinant plasmids containing 60% of the JCV prototype Mad-1 strain DNA were constructed and analyzed with both enzymatic and chemical probes. Fine-mapping studies revealed that the most prominent S1 nuclease-sensitive and bromoacetaldehyde-modified sites were located within the TATA boxes of each 98-base-pair tandem repeat. Further studies revealed that the S1 nuclease-sensitive site in the first TATA box (proximal to the origin) was approximately 50-fold stronger than the site in the second TATA box (distal from the origin). Deletion of the first TATA box drastically reduced the extent of bromoacetaldehyde modification in the second TATA box, whereas deletion of the second TATA box had little or no effect on the reactivity at the first TATA box. Hence, the biological and conformational role of the second TATA box remains unclear. No supercoil-induced relaxation was found, and reactions with the probes were not pH dependent. Also, fragments containing this regulatory region did not appear to be bent, although the A+T-rich segment contained a tract of eight consecutive A's. We conclude that the regulatory region of JCV contains non-B, but right-handed, DNA conformations which account for this behavior.
