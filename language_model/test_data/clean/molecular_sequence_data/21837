A β-1,6-glucanase, LePus30A, was purified and cloned from fruiting bodies of the basidiomycete Lentinula edodes. β-1,6-glucanases degrade β-1,6-glucan polysaccharides, a unique and essential component of fungal cell walls. The complementary DNA of LePus30A includes an open reading frame of 1,575 bp encoding an 18 amino acid signal peptide and the 506 amino acid mature protein. Sequence analysis indicated that LePus30A is a member of glycoside hydrolase family 30, and highly similar genes are broadly conserved among basidiomycetes. The purified LePus30A catalyzed depolymerization of β-1,6-glucan endolytically and was highly specific toward β-1,6-glucan polysaccharide. It is known that the cell walls of fruiting bodies of basidiomycetes are autodegraded after harvesting by means of enzymatic hydrolysis. The transcript level of LePus30A gene (lepus30a) was significantly increased in fruiting bodies after harvesting. Moreover, LePus30A showed hydrolyzing activity against the cell wall components of L. edodes fruiting bodies. These results suggest that LePus30A is responsible for the degradation of the cell wall components during fruiting body autolysis after harvest.
