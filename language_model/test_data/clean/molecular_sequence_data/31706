A strain of Streptomyces, MBRL 179(T), isolated from a sample from a Limestone quarry located at Hundung, Manipur, India, was characterized by polyphasic taxonomy. The strain formed a monophyletic clade with Streptomyces spinoverrucosus NBRC 14228(T) (16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 99.3 %) in the Neighbour-joining tree. DNA-DNA hybridization experiment gave a DNA-DNA relatedness value of 34.7 % between MBRL 179(T) and S. spinoverrucosus NBRC 14228(T). Strain MBRL 179(T) contained LL-diaminopimelic acid, xylose, glucose, and mannose in the whole cell-wall hydrolysates along with small amount of ribose. The major polar lipids detected were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositolmannoside, with other unknown phospholipids and aminophospholipid. MK-9(H6), MK-9(H8) and MK-9(H4) were the predominant menaquinones detected. The major fatty acids were anteiso-C16:0 (28.1 %), iso-C16:0 (20.3 %), C16:0 (9.4 %) and anteiso-C17:0 (8.3 %). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 71.1 %. Based on the polyphasic experiment results, the strain MBRL 179(T) merits recognition as a representative of a novel species of the genus Streptomyces for which the name Streptomyces muensis sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is MBRL 179(T) (=JCM 17576(T) = KCTC 29124(T)).
