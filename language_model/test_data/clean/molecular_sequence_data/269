A Gram-positive, non-motile, rod- or coccoid-shaped Microbacterium-like bacterium, designated strain DS-66(T), was isolated from soil of Dokdo, Korea, and its exact taxonomic position was investigated by using a polyphasic approach. Strain DS-66(T) grew optimally at 30 degrees C and pH 6.5-7.0 in the presence of 0.5-1.0 % (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain DS-66(T) belonged to the genus Microbacterium. Strain DS-66(T) had a peptidoglycan type based on B2beta with partial substitution of glutamic acid by 3-hydroxy glutamic acid (Glu/Hyg-Gly-d-Orn), and galactose, rhamnose and ribose as whole-cell sugars. The acyl type was glycolyl. Strain DS-66(T) contained MK-13, MK-12 and MK-14 as predominant menaquinones and anteiso-C(15 : 0), anteiso-C(17 : 0), iso-C(17 : 0) and iso-C(16 : 0) as major fatty acids. Major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, an unidentified phospholipid and an unidentified glycolipid. The DNA G+C content was 69.9 mol%. Phylogenetic distinctiveness, DNA-DNA relatedness data and differential phenotypic properties demonstrated that strain DS-66(T) is distinguishable from recognized Microbacterium species. On the basis of the data presented, strain DS-66(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Microbacterium, for which the name Microbacterium insulae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is DS-66(T) (=KCTC 19247(T)=CCUG 54523(T)).
