Antigen-specific human IgE is in short supply. Thus, we sought to determine the yet unknown specificity of a widely available human IgE, namely the myeloma cell line U266-derived IgE-ND. For this purpose highly specific peptides able to mimic the putative antigen recognized by IgE-ND were isolated from phage-display random peptide libraries. Interestingly, we found linear sequence homologies of the IgE-ND-binding peptides with self antigens and a xenoantigen from Thiobacillus ferrooxidans. However, none of these antigens was recognized by IgE-ND. Nevertheless, our approach may be applied to identify antigen specificities of myeloma antibodies. Importantly, the mimotopes were anaphylactogenic in a histamine release assay using human basophils sensitized with IgE-ND. Thus, our mimotopes represent functional albeit synthetic antigens and may be used to study human antigen-specific IgE responses.
