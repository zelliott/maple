GB virus-C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV) is a newly identified RNA virus. The aim of the study was to compare three primer pairs from the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR), envelope region 2 (E 2) and nonstructural region 3 (NS 3) of GBV-C/HGV genome for their ability to detect GBV-C/HGV RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. By using PCR with primers from different regions of the viral genome, serum GBV-C/HGV RNA was assayed in 200 at-risk individuals. The sensitivity of this assay was assessed by a titration experiment, and nucleotide sequences of the amplified products were determined directly. Of 200 serum samples, 43 (21.5%) were positive for GBV-C/HGV RNA with at least one of the primer pairs. The positive rates by 5'UTR, NS 3, and E 2 primers were 100%, 98%, and 84%, respectively, and the sensitivity of PCR assays using 5'UTR primers was 10 to 100 times more likely to detect GBV-C/HGV RNA than that of NS 3 and E 2 primers. The average homology of amplified targets to the prototype HGV genome was 89%, 80%, and 85% and the similarity between each amplified target was up to 100%, 90%, and 92% in the 5'UTR, E 2, and NS 3 regions, respectively. Therefore, the 5'UTR of GBV-C/HGV genome is highly conserved and primers deduced from this region can provideva sensitive and specific PCR assay for GBV-C/HGV RNA.
