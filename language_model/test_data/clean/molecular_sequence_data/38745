Viral RNAs extracted from fifteen mumps virus isolated from throat swab, saliva, blood, urine or CSF during mumps epidemics between 1997-1998 in Korea were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and compared by nucleotide sequencing of the small hydrophobic (SH) gene. The deduced amino acid sequences of the SH gene were aligned with the published sequences of mumps virus isolated in different geographic areas. A comparison of the SH gene of mumps viruses in Korea indicated 96.2-100% and 91.2-100% similarity at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis, using the neighbor-joining method, showed that Korean mumps virus strains formed a genetically distinct monophyletic group from previously reported genotypes based on the 315-bp length nucleotide and 57 deduced amino acid sequences of the SH gene, and possibly be designated as a new genotype (I).
