The determinants recognized by helper T cells specific for the site E region of H3 subtype influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) have been defined by examining the reactivity of T-cell clones with sets of overlapping peptides of various lengths covering the site. Two overlapping sequences, TLIDALLG and LIDALLGDP, were identified as the minimal determinants for four of five representative clones. These sequences are located within a loop of the molecule closed by a disulfide bond and presumably require cleavage of this bond for interaction with the class II major histocompatibility molecule. In contrast, the determinant recognized by the fifth clone was dependent on the presence of an intact disulfide bond for its expression and could not be represented by a synthetic peptide homolog of the linear sequence. Both TLIDALLG and LIDALLGDP are conserved within all field strains of the H3 subtype. Nevertheless, recognition of these sequences by the T-cell clones is affected by the glycosylation pattern of the hemagglutinin and by residues lying outside the minimal determinant. Three distinct clones directed towards the sequence LIDALLGDP were remarkably similar in their pattern of response to a set of synthetic analogs of the determinant, suggesting that residues of the T-cell receptor other than those contacting the minimal determinant may be responsible for the different specificities observed for these clones with different field strains of virus.
