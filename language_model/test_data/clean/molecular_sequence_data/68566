A bacterium with an unusual ultrastructure and possessing a fusiform protoplasmic cylinder, spiral periplasmic fibers, and bipolar tufts of sheathed flagella was identified in the intestinal mucosae of laboratory mice. The organism was cultured under microaerophilic conditions and was found to rapidly hydrolyze urea. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the organism was shown to be "Flexispira rappini." "F. rappini" is closely related to members of the genus Helicobacter and has been reported to be associated with human gastroenteritis and ovine abortion. "F. rappini" has not previously been observed in the gastrointestinal tracts of mice.
