An Onchocerca volvulus cDNA clone expressing epitopes found in adult and larval parasites, designated lambda RAL-2, was derived from a 1,000-base message present in adult O. volvulus, which encodes a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 17,000. This protein does not appear to be extensively posttranslationally modified. Serum samples from 52 individuals exposed to O. volvulus were examined for antibodies recognizing the lambda RAL-2 recombinant antigen; 77% produced such antibodies. In addition, individuals producing antibodies recognizing the recombinant antigen were significantly less likely to develop some aspects of ocular pathology associated with O. volvulus infection than were individuals who did not do so. These results suggest that recombinant antigens such as that produced by lambda RAL-2 may be useful in attempts to understand the mechanism of O. volvulus-induced ocular pathology.
