Carbohydrate binding specificity of the galactose-specific, major lectin of mistletoe extract (ML-1) was studied by an inhibition assay using monosaccharides, monosaccharide derivatives, disaccharides, and compounds containing multiple galactosyl terminals. The results indicate that 1) both alpha- and beta-galactosyl residues are recognized equally well; 2) each of the hydroxyl groups of galactose contributes to varying degrees to the binding process, the 4-OH being the most important and the 6-OH the least important hydroxyl group; 3) disaccharide sequences of Gal beta 2Gal and Gal beta 3Gal have much higher affinity than galactose, whereas affinity of all other Gal-disaccharides is only slightly better than galactose; 4) macromolecular ligands having 10 or more terminal galactosyl residues have 500-fold higher affinity than Gal; and 5) a group on ML-1 with pK alpha of 4.8 appears to be involved in the binding of ligand.
