Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) expresses a capsular polysaccharide (CPS) that protects against host immunity and is synthesized by enzymes in the capsular polysaccharide synthesis (cps) locus. Serogroup 11 has six members (11A to -E) and the CPS structure of all members has been solved, except for serotype 11D. The cps loci of 11A and 11D differ by one codon (N112S) in wcrL, which putatively encodes a glycosyltransferase that adds the fourth sugar of the CPS repeating unit (RU). Gas chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis revealed that 11A and 11D PSs contain identical CPS RUs that contain αGlc as the fourth sugar. However, ∼25% of 11D CPS RUs contain instead αGlcNAc as the fourth sugar, suggesting that 11D wcrL encodes a bispecific glycosyltransferase. To test the hypothesis that codon 112 of WcrL determines enzyme specificity, and therefore the fourth sugar in the RU, we generated three isogenic pneumococcal strains with 11A cps loci containing wcrL encoding Ser-112 (MBO128) or Ala-112 (MBO130). MBO128 was serologically and biochemically identical to serotype 11D. MBO130 has a unique serologic profile; has as much αGlcNAc as 11F, 11B, and 11C CPS do; and may represent a new serotype. These findings demonstrate how pneumococci alter their CPS structure and their immunologic properties with a minimal genetic change.
