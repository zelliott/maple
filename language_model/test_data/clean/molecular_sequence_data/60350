Dendrotoxin (DTX) homologues are powerful blockers of K+ channels that contain certain subfamily Kv1 (1.1-1.6) alpha- and beta-subunits, in (alpha)4(beta)4 stoichiometry. DTXk inhibits potently Kv1.1-containing channels only, whereas alphaDTX is less discriminating, but exhibits highest affinity for Kv1.2. Herein, the nature of interactions of DTXk with native K+ channels composed of Kv1.1 and 1.2 (plus other) subunits were examined, using 15 site-directed mutants in which amino acids were altered in the 310-helix, beta-turn, alpha-helix and random-coil regions. The mutants' antagonism of high-affinity [125I]DTXk binding to Kv1. 1-possessing channels in rat brain membranes and blockade of the Kv1. 1 current expressed in oocytes were quantified. Also, the levels of inhibition of [125I]alphaDTX binding to brain membranes by the DTXk mutants were used to measure their high- and low-affinity interactions, respectively, with neuronal Kv1.2-containing channels that possess Kv1.1 as a major or minor constituent. Displacement of toxin binding to either of these subtypes was not altered by single substitution with alanine of three basic residues in the random-coil region, or R52 or R53 in the alpha-helix; accordingly, representative mutants (K17A, R53A) blocked the Kv1.1 current with the same potency as the natural toxin. In contrast, competition of the binding of the radiolabelled alphaDTX or DTXk was dramatically reduced by alanine substitution of K26 or W25 in the beta-turn whereas changing nearby residues caused negligible alterations. Consistently, W25A and K26A exhibited diminished functional blockade of the Kv1.1 homo-oligomer. The 310-helical N-terminal region of DTXk was found to be responsible for recognition of Kv1.1 channels because mutation of K3A led to approximately 1246-fold reduction in the inhibitory potency for [125I]DTXk binding and a large decrease in its ability to block the Kv1.1 current; the effect of this substitution on the affinity of DTXk for Kv1.2-possessing oligomers was much less dramatic (approximately 16-fold).
