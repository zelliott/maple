Viral RNA synthesis was assayed in HeLa cells transfected with nonviable poliovirus RNA mutated in the genome-linked protein VPg-coding region. The transfecting RNA was transcribed in vitro from full-length poliovirus type 1 (Mahoney) cDNA containing a VPg mutagenesis cartridge. Hybridization experiments using ribonucleotide probes specific for the 3' end of positive- and negative-sense poliovirus RNA indicated that all mutant RNAs encoding a linking tyrosine in position 3 or 4 of VPg were replicated even though no virus was produced. VPg, but no VPg precursor, was found to be linked to the 5' end of the newly synthesized RNA. Encapsidated mutant RNAs were not found in transfected-cell lysates. After extended maintenance of transfected HeLa cells, a viable revertant of one of the nonviable RNAs was recovered; the revertant lost the lethal lesion in VPg by restoring the wild-type amino acid, but it retained all other nucleotide changes introduced during construction of the mutagenesis cartridge. Mutant RNA encoding phenylalanine or serine rather than tyrosine, the linking amino acid in VPg, was not replicated in transfected cells. A chimeric mutant containing the VPg-coding region of coxsackievirus within the poliovirus genome was viable but displayed impaired multiplication. A poliovirus-coxsackievirus chimera lacking a linking tyrosine in VPg was nonviable and replication-negative. The results indicate that a linkage-competent VPg is necessary for poliovirus RNA synthesis to occur but that a step in poliovirus replication other than initiation of RNA synthesis can be interrupted by lethal mutations in VPg.
