The mammalian transcription activator Nrf2 plays critical roles in executing oxidative stress response by binding to the regulatory DNA sequence Maf recognition element. Bach2 is an Nrf2-related transcription repressor and a tissue-specific partner of the Maf oncoprotein family. We show here how Bach2 is regulated by an oxidative stress-sensitive conditional nuclear export. In cultured cells, Bach2 was localized in cytoplasm through its C-terminal evolutionarily conserved cytoplasmic localization signal (CLS). The CLS directed leptomycin B-sensitive nuclear export of reporter proteins, suggesting its dependence on the nuclear exporter Crm1/exportin 1. However, the CLS sequence does not bear a resemblance to the leucine-rich class of nuclear export signal, and mutagenesis analysis indicated that a stretch of nonhydrophobic amino acids is essential for its activity. Oxidative stressors aborted the CLS activity and induced nuclear accumulation of Bach2. Whereas oxidative stress is known to activate MARE-dependent transcription, overexpression of Bach2 in cultured cells silenced the inducibility of MARE. The results suggest that Bach2 mediates nucleocytoplasmic communication to couple oxidative stress and transcription repression in mammalian cells.
