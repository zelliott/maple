Atomic-scale computer models were developed for how cecropin peptides may assemble in membranes to form two types of ion channels. The models are based on experimental data and physiochemical principles. Initially, cecropin peptides, in a helix-bend-helix motif, were arranged as antiparallel dimers to position conserved residues of adjacent monomers in contact. The dimers were postulated to bind to the membrane with the NH2-terminal helices sunken into the head-group layer and the COOH-terminal helices spanning the hydrophobic core. This causes a thinning of the top lipid layer of the membrane. A collection of the membrane bound dimers were then used to form the type I channel structure, with the pore formed by the transmembrane COOH-terminal helices. Type I channels were then assembled into a hexagonal lattice to explain the large number of peptides that bind to the bacterium. A concerted conformational change of a type I channel leads to the larger type II channel, in which the pore is formed by the NH2-terminal helices. By having the dimers move together, the NH2-terminal helices are inserted into the hydrophobic core without having to desolvate the charged residues. It is also shown how this could bring lipid head-groups into the pore lining.
