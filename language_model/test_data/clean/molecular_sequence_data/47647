Low phosphorous availability, a common condition of many soils, is known to stimulate phosphatase activity in plants; however, the molecular details of this response remain mostly unknown. We purified and sequenced the N-terminal region of a phosphate starvation induced acid phosphatase (AtACP5) from Arabidopsis thaliana, and cloned its cDNA and the corresponding genomic DNA. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA predicted that AtACP5 is synthesised as a 338 amino acid-long precursor with a signal peptide. AtACP5 was found to be related to known purple acid phosphatases, especially to mammal type 5 acid phosphatases. Other similarities with purple acid phosphatases, which contain a dinuclear metal centre, include the conservation of all residues involved in metal ligand binding and resistance to tartrate inhibition. In addition, AtACP5, like other type 5 acid phosphatases, displayed peroxidation activity. Northern hybridisation experiments, as well as in situ glucuronidase (GUS) activity assays on transgenic plants harbouring AtACP5:GUS translational fusions, showed that AtACP5 is not only responsive to phosphate starvation but also to ABA and salt stress. It is also expressed in senescent leaves and during oxidative stress induced by H2O2, but not by paraquat or salicylic acid. Given its bifunctionality, as it displays both phosphatase and peroxidation activity, we propose that AtACP5 could be involved in phosphate mobilisation and in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species in stressed or senescent parts of the plant.
