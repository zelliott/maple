Biotinylated lactose permease from Escherichia coli containing a single-cysteine residue at position 330 (helix X) or at position 147, 148, or 149 (helix V) was purified by avidin-affinity chromatography and derivatized with 5-(alpha-bromoacetamido)-1,10-phenanthroline-copper [OP(Cu)]. Studies with purified, OP(Cu)-labeled Leu-330 --> Cys permease in dodecyl-beta-D-maltopyranoside demonstrate that after incubation in the presence of ascorbate, cleavage products of approximately 19 and 6-8 kDa are observed on immunoblots with anti-C-terminal antibody. Remarkably, the same cleavage products are observed with permease embedded in the native membrane. Comparison with the C-terminal half of the permease expressed independently as a standard indicates that the 19-kDa product results from cleavage near the cytoplasmic end of helix VII, whereas the 6- to 8-kDa fragment probably results from fragmentation near the cytoplasmic end of helix XI. Results are entirely consistent with a tertiary-structure model of the C-terminal half of the permease derived from earlier site-directed fluorescence and site-directed mutagenesis studies. Similar studies with OP(Cu)-labeled Cys-148 permease exhibit cleavage products at approximately 19 kDa and at 15-16 kDa. The larger fragment probably reflects cleavage at a site near the cytoplasmic end of helix VII, whereas the 15- to 16-kDa fragment is consistent with cleavage near the cytoplasmic end of helix VIII. When OP(Cu) is moved 100 degrees to position 149 (Val-149 --> Cys permease), a single product is observed at 19 kDa, suggesting fragmentation at the cytoplasmic end of helix VII. However, when the reagent is moved 100 degrees in the other direction to position 147 (Gly-147 --> Cys permease), cleavage is not observed. The results suggest that helix V is in close proximity to helices VII and VIII with position 148 in the interface between the helices, position 149 facing helix VII, and position 147 facing the lipid bilayer.
