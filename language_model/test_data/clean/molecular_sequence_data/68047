A gram-negative bacterium which hydrolyzed aryl N-methylcarbamate insecticides was isolated from an agricultural soil which quickly degraded these pesticides. This organism, designated strain ER2, grew on carbofuran as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen with a doubling time of 3 h in a mineral salts medium. The aromatic nucleus of the molecule was not metabolized, and carbofuran 7-phenol accumulated as the end product of metabolism. The insecticides carbaryl, bendiocarb, and propoxur were similarly hydrolyzed, with each yielding the corresponding phenol. Strain ER2 contained two plasmids (120 and 130 kb). A probe cloned from the pDL11 plasmid of Achromobacter sp. strain WM111, which encodes the carbofuran hydrolase (mcd) gene (P. H. Tomasek and J. S. Karns, J. Bacteriol. 171:4038-4044, 1989), hybridized to the 120-kb plasmid. Restriction fragment profiles of pDL11 and strain ER2 plasmid DNAs suggested that the 120-kb plasmid of strain ER2 is very similar to pDL11. On the basis of the results of biochemical tests, 16S rRNA sequence analysis, and membrane lipid analyses, strain ER2 was found to be a phylogenetically unique type II methylotroph. The constitutive carbofuran hydrolase activity in glucose-grown cells increased sevenfold when strain ER2 was grown in the presence of 100 mg of carbofuran per liter as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen or as the sole nitrogen source in the presence of glucose. Growth on carbofuran resulted in the induction of enzymes required for methylamine-dependent respiration and the serine pathway of formaldehyde assimilation. These results indicate that the carbofuran hydrolase mcd gene is conserved on a plasmid found in organisms from different geographic areas and that the specific activity of carbofuran degradation may increase in response to carbofuran treatment.
