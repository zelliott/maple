Tissue-specific expression of the ORF13 promoter from Agrobacterium rhizogenes 8196 was assessed throughout the development of transgenic tobacco plants using a GUS reporter gene. ORF13 exhibited high activity in roots but with different patterns of expression. The activity of the ORF13 promoter in vascular tissues increased from the base to the tip of the stem. The ORF13 promoter is wound inducible in a limited area adjacent to the wound site. The time course of wound induction of ORF13 in transgenic tobacco containing an ORF13 promoter-GUS translational fusion was similar to that previously described for genes involved in plant defense responses. A series of 5' deletions of the ORF13 promoter fused to the beta-glucuronidase gene was examined for expression in roots and leaves of transgenic plants. Cis-acting elements that modulate quantitative expression of the transgene after wounding were detected.
