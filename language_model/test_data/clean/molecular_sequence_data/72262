Our group demonstrated recently that the 3' ends of several families of tRNA-derived SINEs (short interspersed repetitive elements) originated from the 3' ends of LINEs (long interspersed repetitive elements) [Ohshima et al. (1996) Mol. Cell. Biol. 16:3756-3764]. Two fully characterized examples of such organization were provided by the tortoise Pol III/SINE and the salmonid HpaI family of SINEs, and two probable examples were provided by the tobacco TS family of SINEs and the salmon SmaI family of SINEs. This organization of SINEs can explain their potential to retropose in the genome since it appears reasonable that the sites for recognition of LINEs by reverse transcriptase should be located within the 3'-end sequences of LINEs. We now add another example to this category of SINEs. In the bovine genome, there are Bov-tA SINEs, which belong to the superfamily of tRNA-derived families of SINEs, and Bov-B LINEs, which were recently demonstrated to belong to a LINE family. Moreover, Bov-tA and Bov-B share the same 3'-end tail. We propose a possible scenario whereby the composite structure of the bovine Bov-tA family of SINEs might have been generated from the Bov-B family of LINEs during evolution.
