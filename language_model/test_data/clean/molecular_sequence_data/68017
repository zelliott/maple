A rapid diagnostic system for scrub typhus (tsutsugamushi disease) was established using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with microplate hybridization. With this system, diagnosis can be made within six hours without the need for radioisotopes, electrophoresis, or membrane hybridization. The use of a PCR processor and DNA-precoated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates allows a rapid and precise diagnosis to be easily made even in primary medical care clinics.
