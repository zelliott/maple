A Salmonella typhi chromosomal locus composed of five adjacent genes, designated sipEBCDA, was identified by transposon mutagenesis as being essential for cell invasion. Products of the sip genes exhibit extensive sequence similarities to the effectors of Shigella entry into epithelial cells encoded by the virulence plasmid-borne ipa operon. Expression of sipE and sipB in a Shigella non-invasive ipaB mutant restored the ability to invade epithelial cells. The structural and functional conservation of the Sip and Ipa proteins suggests that Salmonella and Shigella entry processes are promoted by similar effectors.
