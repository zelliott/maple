Two tandemly repeated DNA sequences of Gerbillus nigeriae (Rodentia) (GN1 and GN2) were isolated and characterized. Both share a 36bp repeated unit, which includes a 20bp motif also found in primate alphoid and other repeated DNAs. The localization of GN1 and GN2 sequences on metaphase chromosomes of three Gerbillus species, G. nigeriae, G. aureus and G. nanus, was studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In the G. nigeriae and G. aureus karyotypes, which were shown to possess large amounts of heterochromatin and to have undergone multiple rearrangements during evolution, both GN1 and GN2 sequences were observed at various chromosomal sites: centromeric, telomeric and intercalary. In contrast, the karyotypically stable G. nanus, which does not possess large amounts of heterochromatin and seems to be a more ancestral species, possesses only GN1 sequences, localized in the juxtacentromeric regions.
