Murine erythroleukemia cells that lack endogenous p53 expression were transfected with a temperature-sensitive p53 allele. The temperature-sensitive p53 protein behaves as a mutant polypeptide at 37 degrees C and as a wild-type polypeptide at 32 degrees C. Three independent clones expressing the temperature-sensitive p53 protein were characterized with respect to p53-mediated G1 cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation. Clone ts5.203 responded to p53 activation at 32 degrees C by undergoing G1 arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation. Apoptosis was seen in cells representative of all phases of the cell cycle and was not restricted to cells arrested in G1. The addition of a cytokine (erythropoietin, c-kit ligand, or interleukin-3) to the culture medium of ts5.203 cells blocked p53-mediated apoptosis and differentiation but not p53-mediated G1 arrest. These observations indicate that apoptosis and G1 arrest can be effectively uncoupled through the action of cytokines acting as survival factors and are consistent with the idea that apoptosis and G1 arrest represent separate functions of p53. Clones ts15.15 and tsCB3.4 responded to p53 activation at 32 degrees C by undergoing G1 arrest but not apoptosis. We demonstrate that tsCB3.4 secretes a factor with erythropoietin-like activity and that ts15.15 secretes a factor with interleukin-3 activity and suggest that autocrine secretion of these cytokines blocks p53-mediated apoptosis. These data provide a framework in which to understand the variable responses of cells to p53 overexpression.
