Class I genes of the Peromyscus leucopus major histocompatibility complex (MhcPele) were examined by Southern blot hybridization, genomic cloning, and DNA sequencing. At least three distinct subtypes of Pele class I genes were discerned, which we have designated Pele-A, B, and C. The nucleotide sequences of exon 5-containing regions (encoding the transmembrane domain) suggested that Pele-A genes are homologs of mouse H-2K, D, L, and Q genes and that Pele-B genes correspond to mouse Tla genes. The Pele-C genes appeared similar to mouse M1 genes. The number of unique genes in each subtype cloned from an individual P. leucopus were 20 for Pele-A, 13 for Pele-B, and 2 for Pele-C. Three genomic clones showed cross-hybridization to both Pele-A and Pele-B gene-specific probes. Six genomic clones remained unclassified as they did not cross-hybridize to exon 5-containing probes from Pele-A, B, or C genes. The homology between the transmembrane domains of Pele class I gene subtypes was found to be similar to that observed between the transmembrane domains of H-2 subtypes (or groups). Interspecific similarity of exon 5 was found to be 81%-88% between Pele class I genes and their H-2 counterparts.
