6-Hydroxynicotinate 3-monooxygenase, a membrane-bound, 42-kDa monomeric enzyme from Pseudomonas fluorescens TN5 was purified and characterized. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of 6-hydroxynicotinate and depends on O2, NADH and FAD with the holoenzyme containing 1 M of FAD per 1 M of enzyme. The isolated enzyme was used for the synthesis of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine, a precursor for the chemical synthesis of 5-aminolevulinic acid, which is applied as a plant growth hormone, a herbicide and in cancer therapy. A 1.8-kbp DNA fragment, which contains the ORF encoding 6-hydroxynicotinic acid 3-monooxygenase, was cloned, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. The deduced 385 amino acid sequence of the cloned ORF is in agreement with the enzyme molecular mass, amino acid sequence of an internal peptide, contains a putative FAD-binding site and is homologous to similar flavoproteins such as salicylate 1-monoxygenase.
