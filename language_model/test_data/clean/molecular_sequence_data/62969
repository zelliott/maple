Possible bioterrorism with smallpox has led to the resumption of smallpox (vaccinia virus) immunization. One complication, eczema vaccinatum, occurs primarily in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). Skin lesions of patients with AD, but not psoriasis, is deficient in the cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (LL-37) and human beta-defensin-2 (HBD-2). We hypothesized that this defect may explain the susceptibility of patients with AD to eczema vaccinatum. The Wyeth vaccine strain of vaccinia virus was incubated with varying concentrations of human (LL-37) and murine (CRAMP) cathelicidins, human alpha-defensin (HBD-1, HBD-2), and a control peptide. Outcomes included quantification of viral PFU, vaccinia viral gene expression by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and changes in virion structure by transmission electron microscopy. CRAMP knockout mice and control animals were inoculated by skin pricks with 2 x 10(5) PFU of vaccinia and examined daily for pox development. Physiologic amounts of human and murine cathelicidins (10-50 micro M), but not human defensins, which had antibacterial activity, resulted in the in vitro reduction of vaccinia viral plaque formation (p < 0.0001), vaccinia mRNA expression (p < 0.001), and alteration of vaccinia virion structure. In vivo vaccinia pox formation occurred in four of six CRAMP knockout animals and in only one of 15 control mice (p < 0.01). These data support a role for cathelicidins in the inhibition of orthopox virus (vaccinia) replication both in vitro and in vivo. Susceptibility of patients with AD to eczema vaccinatum may be due to a deficiency of cathelicidin.
