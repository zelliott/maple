Based on chromosomal mapping data, we recently revealed an unexpected linkage of troponin genes in the human genome: the six genes encoding striated muscle troponin I and troponin T isoforms are located at three chromosomal sites, each of which carries a troponin I-troponin T gene pair. Here we have investigated the organization of these genes at the DNA level in isolated P1 and PAC genomic clones and demonstrate close physical linkage in two cases through the isolation of individual clones containing a complete troponin I-troponin T gene pair. As an initial step toward fully characterizing this pattern of linkage, we have determined the organization and complete sequence of the locus encoding cardiac troponin I and slow skeletal troponin T and thereby also provide the first determination of the structure and sequence of a slow skeletal troponin T gene. Our data show that the genes are organized head to tail and are separated by only 2.6 kb of intervening sequence. In contrast to other troponin genes, and despite their close proximity, the cardiac troponin I and slow skeletal troponin T genes show independent tissue-specific expression. Such close physical linkage has implications for the evolution of the troponin gene families, for their regulation, and for the analysis of mutations implicated in cardiomyopathy.
