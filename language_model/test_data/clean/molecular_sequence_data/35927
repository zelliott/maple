We have identified genomic clones and corresponding cDNAs that encode a putative peroxidase of Drosophila melanogaster. The gene (DmPO) appears as a single copy gene located on the third chromosome at position 89 D/E. It is interrupted by seven small introns and one unusually large 5' intron (about 11 kb). Sequence analysis of the cDNA showed an open reading frame of 690 amino acids resulting in a protein of 77 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence reveals an overall homology to myeloeosinophil and thyroid peroxidase, a human superfamily of peroxidases.
