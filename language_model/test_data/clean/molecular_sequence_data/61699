The chemical structural variations induced by different growth temperatures in the lipooligosaccharide and exopolysaccharide components extracted from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC 125 are described. The increase in phosphorylation with the increase in growth temperature seems to be general, because it happens not only for the lipooligosaccharide but also for the exopolysaccharide. Structural variations in the lipid components of lipid A also occur. In addition, free lipid A is found at both 25 and 4 degrees C but not at 15 degrees C, which is the optimal growth temperature, suggesting a incomplete biosynthesis of the lipooligosaccharide component under the first two temperature conditions.
