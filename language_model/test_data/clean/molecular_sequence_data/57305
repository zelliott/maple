Effect of antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides on in vitro translation of RNAs corresponding to fragments of the tick-borne encephalitis virus genome has been investigated. Sequences optimal for oligonucleotide binding and translation arrest have been identified. The most efficient oligonucleotide (17-mer) at a concentration of 2.5 microM completely arrests translation of the RNA coding for the NS3 protein.
