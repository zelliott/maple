Although occasional DNA polymorphisms have been observed in inbred mice, CBA/J and C3H/HeN mice have two microsatellite alleles at over 1/3 of microsatellite loci tested. Since DNA polymorphisms were not detected in DBA/2J, C57BL/6J, and BALB/cJ, the frequency of microsatellite polymorphisms appears to be strain specific. Thus, genetic studies in inbred mice require testing for preexisting polymorphisms. The polymorphisms detected in CBA/J mice appear to be stable and do not represent microsatellite instability or a mutator phenotype. Somatic mosaicism was not observed and no more than two alleles were detected per locus. CBA/J propagated only by brother-sister mating maintained seven of eight polymorphisms over 5 years. These data suggest that the polymorphisms are due to an inherited trait and that the pattern of inheritance is not due to Mendelian distribution. As breeding analysis was not performed, the pattern of allelic inheritance is unknown.
