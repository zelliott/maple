The nucleotide (nt) sequence of 1.7 kbp cDNA representing the 3' end of the PEDV genome has been determined. Viral RNA was reverse transcribed and the cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers. The sequences of the primers were based on conserved regions of coronaviral genomes. A 1323 nt open reading frame (ORF) showed good homology to the nucleocapsid (N) gene of other coronaviruses. The greatest homologies at the amino acid and the nt levels were observed with Human Coronavirus 229E. A second 336 nt ORF, which might encode a leucine-rich protein, was found within the N gene. Between the 3' end of the N gene and the poly(A) tail was a sequence of eleven nt, which is conserved among the other sequenced coronaviruses. Finally, a seven base sequence similar to the conserved intergenic sequences was present 5' to the N gene. These results confirm the classification of PEDV as a coronavirus.
