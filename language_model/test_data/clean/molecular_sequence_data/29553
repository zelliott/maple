RNA helicase II/Gu (RH-II/Gu or DDX21) is a DEAD-box enzyme that localizes to the nucleoli and may be involved in ribosomal RNA synthesis or processing. It has two paralogues, RH-II/Gualpha and RH-II/Gubeta, both genes of which are on chromosome 10. Their similar genomic structures suggest the two genes arose by gene duplication. Both genes are expressed at higher levels in some normal human tissues compared to matching tumor tissues. Pseudogenes for RH-II/Gubeta exist on chromosomes 2, 3 and 4. No pseudogene was identified for RH-II/Gualpha. Both exon inclusion and exon skipping were found to post-transcriptionally regulate RH-II/Gubeta gene expression. No alternative splicing was identified for RH-II/Gualpha. Overall, the results suggest that the two paralogues of RH-II/Gu arose by gene duplication but the resulting genes are differentially regulated.
