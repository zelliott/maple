We have determined the sequence, genomic structure, and chromosomal location of the human synaptotagmin V (SYTV) gene. The human SYTV gene encodes a 386-amino-acid product which is 91% identical to rat Syt V. The human SYTV open reading frame is interrupted by seven introns which can be alternatively spliced. Human SYTV was found to lie very close to SYTIII on chromosome 19q13.4 by PCR analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNA and by DNA hybridization to arrayed cosmids of the chromosome 19 metric physical map. This provides the first report of linked synaptotagmin genes.
