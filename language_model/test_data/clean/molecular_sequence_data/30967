Two BamHI fragments from the right-hand terminal region of the orf virus genome have been sequenced. The bulk of the inverted terminal repetition (ITR) sequence is contained within these fragments and makes up 3388 bp of the 4425-bp sequence reported. The overall base composition of the larger sequence is 59.4% G + C and of the ITR, 60.2% G + C. An extremely G/C-rich (83.2%) block of sequence was found spanning the ITR/unique sequence junction. The bulk of the ITR could be divided into three blocks of directly repeated sequences. One block begins about 250 nucleotides from the terminus and is a direct repeat 15 bp long, repeated 14 times. The other blocks contain seven sequence sets ranging from 16 to 36 nucleotides which are repeated 2 to 4 times, interspersed with one another, interrelated in sequence, and sometimes separated by unique sequence. Eight open reading frames (ORFs), each with the potential to code for polypeptides of 50 residues or more, were identified. Three were found within the ITR, four spanned the ITR/unique sequence junction and one was found outside the ITR. A search for putative poxvirus transcriptional control signals indicated that three of the eight ORFs are likely to be transcribed early, all in the same direction toward the right end of the genome. Sequences of the type T(A)3-5T were found only twice in the sequence and only one preceded an ORF.
