The formation of N-formylkynurenine by dioxygenation of tryptophan was detected in peptides from rice leaf and potato tuber mitochondria. Proteins in matrix and membrane fractions were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified using a Q-TOF mass spectrometer. N-Formylkynurenine was detected in 29 peptides representing 17 different proteins. With one exception, the oxidation-sensitive aconitase, all of these proteins were either redox active themselves or subunits in redox-active enzyme complexes. The same site was modified in (i) several adjacent spots containing the P protein of the glycine decarboxylase complex, (ii) two different isoforms of the mitochondrial processing peptidase in complex III, and (iii) the same tryptophan residues in Mn-superoxide dismutase in both rice and potato mitochondria. This indicates that Trp oxidation is a selective process.
