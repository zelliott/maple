We have identified a novel member of the calcium-dependent (C-type) lectin family. This molecule, designated DCIR (for dendritic cell (DC) immunoreceptor), is a type II membrane glycoprotein of 237 aa with a single carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), closest in homology to those of the macrophage lectin and hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptors. The intracellular domain of DCIR contains a consensus immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. A mouse cDNA, encoding a homologous protein has been identified. Northern blot analysis showed DCIR mRNA to be predominantly transcribed in hematopoietic tissues. The gene encoding human DCIR was localized to chromosome 12p13, in a region close to the NK gene complex. Unlike members of this complex, DCIR displays a typical lectin CRD rather than an NK cell type extracellular domain, and was expressed on DC, monocytes, macrophages, B lymphocytes, and granulocytes, but not detected on NK and T cells. DCIR was strongly expressed by DC derived from blood monocytes cultured with GM-CSF and IL-4. DCIR was mostly expressed by monocyte-related rather than Langerhans cell related DC obtained from CD34+ progenitor cells. Finally, DCIR expression was down-regulated by signals inducing DC maturation such as CD40 ligand, LPS, or TNF-alpha. Thus, DCIR is differentially expressed on DC depending on their origin and stage of maturation/activation. DCIR represents a novel surface molecule expressed by Ag presenting cells, and of potential importance in regulation of DC function.
