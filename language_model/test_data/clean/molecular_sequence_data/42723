We have sequenced two segments containing a total of 51.6 kb of the left arm from chromosome XI of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The first segment of 38.5 kb contains 18 open reading frames (ORFs) of more than 100 amino acid residues. Five ORFs encode known yeast genes, including the fatty acid synthase gene (FAS1). Three new yeast genes were discovered with homologies to non-yeast genes and ten new genes without homologies to any known sequences. The second segment of 13 kb contains five ORFs with two known yeast genes and three unknown genes. The sequences from cosmid pUKG041 were obtained entirely with the walking primer strategy resulting in a very low overall sequence redundancy of 2.8 and an average reading length of 443 bases.
