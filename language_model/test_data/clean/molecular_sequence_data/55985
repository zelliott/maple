Two monoterpene glycosides, tentatively named OJV-I (1) and OJV-II (2), and eight steroidal glycosides, tentatively named OJV-III (3), OJV-IV (4), OJV-V (5), OJV-VI (6), OJV-VII (7), OJV-VIII (8), OJV-IX (9) and OJV-X (10), were isolated from the butanol-soluble fraction of the fresh subterranean part of Ophiopogon japonicus KER-GAWLER cv. Nanus. Among these compounds, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 were identified as l-borneo1 O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, l-borneo1 O-beta-D-apiofuranosyl (1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside, ophiopogonin B, glycoside C, ophiopogonin D, Ls-10, and ruscogenin 1-O-sulfate, respectively. The structures of compounds 8, 9, and 10 were established to be (23S,24S,25S)-23,24-dihydroxyruscogenin 1-O-[ alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1-->2)] [beta-D-xylopyranosyl(1-->3)]-alpha-L-arabinopyranoside 24-O-beta-D-fucopyranoside, (23S,24S,25S)-23,24-dihydroxyruscogenin I-O-[alpha-L-2,3,4-tri-O-acetylrhamnopyranosyl(1-->2)][beta-D-xylo pyranosyl(1-->3)]-alpha-L-arabinopyranoside 24-O-beta-D-fucopyranoside, and (23S,24S,25S)-23,24-dihydroxyruscogenin 1-O-[alpha-L-2,3,4-tri-O-acetylrhamnopyranosyl(1-->2)] [beta-D-xylopyranosyl(1-->3)]=alpha-L-arabinopyranoside 24-O-beta-D-fucopyranoside, respectively.
