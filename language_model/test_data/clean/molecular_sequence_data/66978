The endangered indigenous tree species Juniperus procera, commonly known as African Pencil Cedar, is an important component of the dry Afromontane vegetation of Ethiopia and was shown to be AM in earlier studies. Here we describe the composition of AM fungi in colonized roots of J. procera from two dry Afromontane forests of Ethiopia. The nuSSU rDNA gene was amplified from colonized roots, cloned and sequenced using AM fungal specific primers that were partly developed for this study. Molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that all the glomeralean sequences obtained belonged exclusively to the genus Glomus (Glomeraceae). Seven distinct Glomus sequence types were identified that all are new to science. The composition of the AM fungal communities between the sampled trees, and between the two study sites in general, differed significantly. Isolation and utilization of the indigenous AM fungal taxa from the respective sites might be required for successful enrichment plantation of this threatened Juniperus species.
