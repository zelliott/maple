Genetic variations in tapeworms causing cystic echinococcosis in Peru were investigated. Seventy one larval isolates collected from different intermediate hosts and geographic regions were identified by the DNA sequencing of genes for mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) and nuclear elongation factor 1 alpha (ef1a). The G7 genotype (E. canadensis pig strain) was found for the first time in pigs reared in the city of Lima. Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto (sheep strain or G1) was the most prevalent in human patients, sheep, and cattle and the G6 genotype (E. canadensis camel strain) was found in goats and in one human patient. These findings may inform prevention strategies and control programs against echinococcosis in Peru.
