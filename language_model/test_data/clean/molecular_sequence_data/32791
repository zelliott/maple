Cyclotides are naturally occurring mini-proteins that have a cyclic peptide backbone and a knotted arrangement of three disulfide bonds. They are remarkably stable and have a diverse range of therapeutically useful biological activities, including antimicrobial and anti-HIV activity, although their natural function appears to be as plant defence agents. Cyclotides are amenable to chemical synthesis and the potential exists to graft new bioactivities onto their cyclic cystine knot framework as a way of stabilising peptide drugs. Over the last few years, proof-of-concept that bioactive peptide epitopes can be grafted onto cyclotides and related cystine knot mini-proteins has been obtained. The cystine knot framework is tolerant to a wide range of residue substitutions and is showing great promise as a scaffold in drug design and protein engineering.
