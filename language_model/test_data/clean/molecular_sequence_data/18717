The purpose of this study was to monitor local cytokine responses to Dictyocaulus viviparus in calves during primary infection and re-infection. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected weekly from experimentally infected calves and interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IFN-γ mRNA expression was quantified in BALF cells. The major finding was a prominent transient increase in IL-4 mRNA expression, compared with that of uninfected calves, observed in BALF cells collected 2-3 weeks post-primary D. viviparus infection. At 2 weeks post-infection, macroscopic worms were also first observed in BALF. Calves re-infected after 10 weeks were partially immune which was evident at slaughter 5 weeks post-infection as a lower worm burden than in previously naïve calves infected at the same time. IL-4 mRNA expression in BALF cells 2 weeks post-re-infection was increased compared with that of uninfected animals but not as high as that of primarily infected calves. BALF cell expression of the other cytokines tested for was not as clearly effected by the D. viviparus infection. It seems likely that the strong IL-4 response observed during primary infection reflects an innate response to the worms that may initiate an ensuing Th2 response, which confers protective immunity.
