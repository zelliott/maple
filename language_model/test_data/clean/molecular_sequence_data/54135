Surface modification strategies that take advantage of the passivation effects of albumin are important in the development of biomaterial surfaces. In this study, linear peptides (LP1, LP2) and a small chemical ligand (SCL) with albumin binding affinities were grafted onto silane functionalized silicon substrates. Surfaces were characterized with contact angle and ellipsometric measurements, and densities of immobilized ligands were assessed spectroscopically. Ellipsometrically measured thickness correlated with the predicted molecular lengths of grafted moieties. Contact angle analysis indicated that the LP1 and LP2 functionalized surfaces were hydrophilic compared to SCL functionalized and control surfaces. Adsorption of albumin from human serum was evaluated and quantified via specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and 2D gel electrophoresis. The following trend was noted for surface adsorbed albumin: LP1 > LP2 > SCL > C, with LP1 derivatized surfaces having ~2.450 Î¼g/cm(2) of bound albumin. LP1 derivatized surfaces possessed the least number of adsorbed platelets with rounded platelet morphology when compared to control surface.
