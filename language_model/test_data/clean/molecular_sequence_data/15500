A Gram-positive, aerobic, rod-shaped and non-motile bacterium, designated strain KP02(T), was isolated from soil from a ginseng field in Daejeon, South Korea. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, this strain was shown to be related to 'Pseudoclavibacter alba' NBRC 15616 (95.5 %), 'Pseudoclavibacter faecalis' NBRC 15706 (93.9 %), Pseudoclavibacter helvolus DSM 20419(T) (93.7 %) and 'Pseudoclavibacter bifida' IAM 14848 (93.0 %). Chemotaxonomic data revealed that strain KP02(T) possessed MK-9 and MK-8 as major menaquinones and anteiso-C(15 : 0), anteiso-C(17 : 0), iso-C(16 : 0) and C(16 : 0 )as predominant fatty acids. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain KP02(T) was 64.4 mol%. The physiological and biochemical tests suggested that strain KP02(T) represents a novel species. Based on these data, strain KP02(T) (=KCTC 19255(T)=JCM 15058(T)) should be classified as the type strain of a novel Pseudoclavibacter species, for which the name Pseudoclavibacter soli sp. nov. is proposed.
