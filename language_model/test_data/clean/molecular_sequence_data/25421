The production of human gamma interferon as intracellular inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli, which simplified the purification process, is described. An expression plasmid carrying lipoprotein and the tryptophane promoters in tandem was used. Preparation of highly pure interferon was achieved using high resolution chromatography after denaturation and renaturation steps. Structural characteristics of this protein were verified by mass spectrometric analysis. Additional control tests have shown the suitability of the final product for clinical purposes.
