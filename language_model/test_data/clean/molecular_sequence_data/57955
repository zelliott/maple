The perbenzylated maltosyl and maltotriosyl fluorides 6 and 16 were treated with 2,3,2',3',6'-penta-O-benzyl-4,6-O-benzylidene-alpha,alpha-trehalose (7) using triflic anhydride as a promoter to give all-alpha-D-linked tetra- and penta-saccharides which were finally deblocked to the free oligosaccharides 4-O-alpha-maltosyl-9 and 4-O-alpha-maltotriosyl-alpha,alpha-trehaloses 18. The 1H NMR spectra of some of the compounds were fully analyzed by 1D TOCSY and ROESY experiments.
