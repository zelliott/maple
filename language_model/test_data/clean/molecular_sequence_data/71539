An oligonucleotide probe encoding a peptide motif conserved in all sigma factors was used to isolate a new gene, sigG, from a Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) genomic library. The deduced protein of 263 amino acids with an M(r) of 29,422 showed the greatest similarity to the previously identified sporulation sigma factor (sigma F) of Streptomyces coelicolor, and general stress response sigma factor (sigma B) of Bacillus subtilis, mostly in domains suggested to be involved in recognition of -10 and -35 promoter regions. Southern-blot hybridization with DNA from several Streptomyces spp. revealed the presence of a similar gene in all strains tested. Disruption of the S. coelicolor sigG gene appeared to have no obvious effect on growth, morphology, differentiation, and production of pigmented antibiotic actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin.
