In search of mitochondrial proteins interacting with phosphatidylcholine (PC), a photolabeling approach was applied, in which photoactivatable probes were incorporated into isolated yeast mitochondria. Only a limited number of proteins were labeled upon photoactivation, using either the PC analogue [125I]TID-PC or the small hydrophobic probe [125I]TID-BE. The most prominent difference was the very specific labeling of a 70 kDa protein by [125I]TID-PC. Mass spectrometric analysis of a tryptic digest of the corresponding 2D-gel spot identified the protein as the GUT2 gene product, the FAD-dependent mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. This was confirmed by the lack of specific labeling in mitochondria from a gut2 deletion strain. Only under conditions where the inner membrane was accessible to the probe, Gut2p was labeled by [125I]TID-PC, in parallel with increased labeling of the phosphate carrier (P(i)C) in the inner membrane. A hemagglutinin-tagged version of Gut2p was shown to be membrane-bound. Carbonate extraction released the protein from the membrane, whereas a high concentration of NaCl did not, demonstrating that Gut2p is a peripheral membrane protein bound to the inner membrane via hydrophobic interactions. The significance of the observed interactions between Gut2p and PC is discussed.
