The gyrAB genes encoding the entire B and a portion of the A subunit of DNA gyrase (E.C. 5.99.1.3) from Mycoplasma gallisepticum (Mg), strain S6, were cloned and sequenced. These gyrAB genes are co-transcribed as a single, polycistronic mRNA transcript. The Mg gyrB appears unique among prokaryotic gyrB in its use of GUG as a start codon.
