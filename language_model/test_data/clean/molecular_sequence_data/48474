The bacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens anti-CA isolated from mangrove system was found to be able to actively kill Candida albicans isolated from clinic. The bacterial strain anti-CA could produce high level of bioactive substance, amylase and protease in the cheap medium containing 2.0 % soybean meal, 2.0 % wheat flour, pH 6.5 within 26 h. After purification, the main bioactive substance was confirmed to be a cyclic lipopeptide containing a heptapeptide, L-Asp→L-Leu→L-Leu→L-Val→L-Val→L-Glu→L-Leu and a 3-OH fatty acid (15 carbons). In addition to C. albicans, the purified lipopeptide can also kill many yeast strains including Metschnikowia bicuspidata, Candida tropicalis, Yarrowia lipolytica and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. After treated by the purified lipopeptide, both the whole cells and protoplasts of C. albicans were destroyed.
