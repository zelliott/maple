Systematic screening using the SSCP technique followed by sequencing of bands with abnormal mobility derived from the AGXT exons of 15 unrelated Italian patients with primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) allowed us to characterize both the mutant alleles in each individual. Eight new mutations were identified: C155del, C156ins, G244T, C252T, GAG408ins, G468A, G588A and G1098del. This study demonstrates both the effectiveness of the screening strategy chosen to identify all the mutant alleles and the high degree of allelic heterogeneity in PH1.
