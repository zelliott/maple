We report the isolation and characterization of two new genomic loci corresponding to the mouse Dishevelled (Dvl) genes Dvl2 and Dvl3. The Dvl genes are homologs of the Drosophila dsh segment polarity gene, and are involved in the Wnt/wingless signal transduction pathway. Dvl2 and Dvl3 genomic clones were isolated from a mouse 129 strain gamma FIXII genomic library and have identical exon/intron organization to Dvl1. All three Dishevelled genes span 15 exons and 14 introns and have a number of conserved splice junction sites.
