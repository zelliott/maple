In recent years, enterovirus 71 (EV71) has been a cause of numerous outbreaks of hand-foot-and-mouth disease, with severe neurological complications in the Asia-Pacific region. The reemergence in Taiwan of EV71 genotype B5 in 2008 resulted in the largest outbreak of EV71 in Taiwan in the past 11 years. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that dominant genotype changes from B to C or C to B occurred at least three times between 1986 and 2008. Furthermore, antigenic cartography of EV71 by using neutralization tests revealed that the reemerging EV71 genotype B5 strains formed a separate cluster which was antigenically distinct from the B4 and C genotypes. Moreover, analyses of full-length genomic sequences of EV71 circulating in Taiwan during this period showed the occurrence of intra- and interserotypic recombination. Therefore, continuous surveillance of EV71 including the monitoring of genetic evolution and antigenic changes is recommended and may contribute to the development of a vaccine for EV71.
