The production of alpha-amidated peptides is accomplished through the sequential action of two enzymes, peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM) and peptidyl-alpha-hydroxyglycine alpha-amidating lyase (PAL), that are contained within the bifunctional peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) protein. Tissue-specific alternative splicing and endoproteolysis are known to generate both soluble and integral membrane mono- and bifunctional PAM proteins. In order to investigate the functional consequences of these differences we purified PAM-3, a soluble 95-kDa bifunctional form of the enzyme, from the spent medium of stably transfected hEK-293 cells. Using NH2-terminal sequence analysis of products of limited endoproteolysis and antibody cross-reactivity we identified protease-sensitive regions at the NH2 terminus, between the 35-kDa PHM and 42-kDa PAL domains and at the COOH terminus of the protein. Endoproteolytic removal of the COOH-terminal region from the bifunctional PAM-3 protein shifted the pH optimum of PHM to a more alkaline pH, increased the turnover number (kappa(cat)) of PHM and decreased its KM for alpha-N-acetyl-Tyr-Val-Gly; the catalytic properties of PAL were not altered. Since peptide amidation can be a rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of neuropeptides, similar increases in PHM activity in vivo may play an important role in regulating the extent of peptide alpha-amidation.
