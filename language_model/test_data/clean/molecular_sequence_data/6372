A retrovirus containing the multiple drug resistance (MDR-1) cDNA, was used to transduce cultures of CD34 selected human marrow cells, on stromal monolayers in the presence of hematopoietic growth factors IL-3 and IL-6, following collection from patients recently recovered from chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. In one experiment, these CD34 selected cells were grown in Dexter cultures for 35 days or more following MDR-1 transduction, and then plated in methylcellulose. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of colonies picked after 10-14 days of methylcellulose culture, using a set of primers that are specific for the endogenous or the retrovirally transduced MDR-1, showed that the long-term culture initiating cells (LTCICs) were transduced by the MDR-1 virus. Analysis of the colonies from the CD34 selected MDR-1 transduced cells, with a reverse transcription (RT) PCR assay that could distinguish viral MDR-1 mRNA from endogenous MDR-1 mRNA, showed that the viral MDR-1 mRNA levels were much higher than that of the MDR-1 mRNA from the endogenous MDR-1 gene in the transduced CD34 selected cells. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of the CD34 selected transduced marrow cells within 48 h after the transduction, using the C219 and UIC2 monoclonal antibodies for p-glycoprotein, showed that the transduction frequency under these conditions varied from 7 to 20%. Rhodamine efflux studies showed that this additional p-glycoprotein was functional and that the frequency of cells with high p-glycoprotein levels was higher in the transduced cells than in the non-transduced cells. The resistance to taxol of the CD34 selected transduced cells, as judged by the plating efficiency of clonogenic progenitor cells derived from these cells by growth in methylcellulose supplemented with taxol was much higher in the transduced cells than in untransduced cells. In order to test the reproducibility of the transduction frequency of the retroviral supernatants from PA317 MDR-1 viral producer cells on CD34 selected cells, the virus produced from 12 different lots of supernatants from the PA317 MDR-1 producer cell line was used to transduce CD34 selected marrow cells from four different patients, and to transduce the peripheral blood cells of two additional patients collected following chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. The supernatant lots used for these transduction experiments were tested by Microbiological Associates (Rockville, MD, USA), by the Mus dunni co-cultivation and amplification tests in the S+L-assay and found to be negative for replication-competent retrovirus, and later approved for human use by the Food and Drug Administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
