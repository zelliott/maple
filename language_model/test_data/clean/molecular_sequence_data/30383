A new frog skin peptide, ranamargarin depicted as H-Asp-Asp-Ala-Ser-Asp-Arg-Ala-Lys-Lys-Phe-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2' was synthesized by the conventional method. Comparisons of chemical and biological properties of both the synthetic and natural ranamargarins indicated that they were identical, so the chemical structure of ranamargarin was confirmed. Preliminary pharmacological study showed that ranamargarin was highly selective towards the SP-P subtype receptor.
