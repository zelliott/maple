The major gliadin components were isolated from the seeds of the diploid species Aegilops squarrosa, a putative source of polyploid wheat D-genome. The isolation procedure included gel-filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The purified proteins were characterized by electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide gel using acid Al-lactate system and a system containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. The amino acid composition of isolated omega-gliadins was determined. Using covalent chromatography on thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B it was found that omega-gliadins of A. squarrosa contain no SH-groups and/or S-S-bonds. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of A. squarrosa gliadins were determined. omega-Gliadins were found to contain three types of N-terminal amino acid sequences, one of which, SRQ, in hexaploid wheat is encoded by 1B chromosome. It was shown that some omega-gliadins of A. squarrosa have blocked N-terminal amino acids. The major component of the gamma-fraction was found to contain an N-terminal sequence of gamma 2 type encoded in polyploid wheat by 1D chromosome. Gliadins with electrophoretic mobility in the beta-zone of the spectrum possess the N-terminal sequence of alpha-type. The results obtained are discussed in terms of the origin of polyploid wheat genomes.
