To isolate the cellulase gene from Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii 1536.

By the shot-gun method a clone (cel8A) harbouring 3.1 kb genomic DNA fragment from R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii 1536 was obtained. The cel8A gene coded 348 amino acids and it belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase family 8. The molecular mass of Cel8A protein induced from Escherichia coli DH5alpha, appeared to be 35 kDa. The optimum pH and optimum temperature was 7.0, and about 30 degrees C for its enzymatic activity respectively.

R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii 1536 had cel8A gene having an open reading frame of 1047 bp coded for the activity of hydrolyzation of carboxymethyl cellulose.

The production of celluloytic enzyme by R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii was confirmed, which would play specific roles in rhizobia. Future study should focus on its role in the infection and nodulation phenomena.
