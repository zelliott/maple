Two tandemly linked genes are present in the Leishmania infantum genome that code for the acidic ribosomal PO protein. The genes are identical in the coding region, although a striking lack of nucleotide sequence conservation is observed when the boundaries of the coding regions between both genes are compared. The 3' untranslated regions of the two genes are, moreover, different in size. The deduced amino acid sequence of the L. infantum PO protein (LiPO) shows a high degree of sequence conservation, including the highly charged conserved C-terminal domain, with the ribosomal PO proteins of other eukaryotic organisms. Northern blot experiments showed that two different size class transcripts are expressed in the gene cluster and that the steady state level of each of the transcripts in logarithmic phase promastigotes is markedly different. The abundance of both transcripts is down-regulated in parasite cultures on reaching stationary phase. Since it seems that the two Leishmania ribosomal PO genes are expressed in a single polycistronic transcript, it is likely that the different levels of PO mRNAs observed in cultured cells is due to a postranscriptional regulatory mechanism.
