Strain Dae16T, a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium, was isolated from the soil of a ginseng field in South Korea and characterized in order to determine its taxonomic position. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain Dae16T belongs to the Gammaproteobacteria and had the highest degree of sequence similarity to Lysobacter gummosus ATCC 29489T (97.1 %), Lysobacter antibioticus DSM 2044T (96.6 %), Lysobacter enzymogenes DSM 2043T (96.2 %), Lysobacter concretionis KCTC 12205T (94.7 %) and Lysobacter brunescens ATCC 29482T (93.7 %). Chemotaxonomic data revealed that strain Dae16T possesses a quinone system with Q-8 as the predominant compound and C(15 : 0) iso, C(16 : 0) iso and C(17 : 1) iso omega9c as the predominant iso-branched fatty acids, all of which corroborated the assignment of the strain to the genus Lysobacter. Results of DNA-DNA hybridization and physiological and biochemical tests clearly demonstrated that strain Dae16T represents a distinct species. Based on these data, it is proposed that Dae16T (= KCTC 12204T = NBRC 101156T) should be classified as the type strain of a novel Lysobacter species, Lysobacter koreensis sp. nov.
