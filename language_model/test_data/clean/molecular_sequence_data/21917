Members of the Nkx family of homeodomain proteins are involved in a variety of developmental processes such as cell fate determination in the CNS and in the pancreas. Here we describe the cloning and developmental expression pattern of Nkx6.3, a new member of the Nkx6 subfamily of homeodomain proteins. Nkx6.3 is expressed in the developing CNS and gastro-intestinal tract. In contrast to Nkx6.1 and Nkx6.2 that are broadly expressed in ventral positions of the developing CNS, Nkx6.3 shows a remarkably selective expression in a subpopulation of differentiating V2 neurons at caudal hindbrain levels. The expression of Nkx6.3 at this level depends on the activity of other Nkx6 proteins. In the gut, Nkx6.3 is expressed in duodenal and glandular stomach endoderm and at the end of gestation Nkx6.3 became restricted to the base of the gastric units in the glandular stomach. The expression of Nkx6.3 overlapped with the expression of Nkx6.2 both in the CNS and in the gut. Transient Nkx6.2 expression was also detected in the developing pancreas. However, analysis of Nkx6.2(-/-) mice did not display any obvious aberrations of pancreatic or stomach development.
