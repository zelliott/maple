The development of functional layers in the brain involves spatially and temporally regulated gene expression. Through cDNA library screening, we have identified genes that are expressed in a neural-specific manner during brain development. Sequencing and expression data indicate that one of the clones, 18C15, is the chick homologue of doublecortin, a human X-linked gene found to be mutated in subcortical laminar heterotopia (double cortex syndrome) and lissencephaly. The 18C15 mRNA contains multiple motifs that are known to regulate mRNA stability in response to inductive signals, and these motifs are conserved between the chick and human sequences. Doublecortin is found to be expressed at peak levels during early development of the cerebellum and forebrain, and is expressed in other regions including the tectum, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia. This study demonstrates both spatial and temporal regulation of doublecortin expression in the chick, which is associated with early events in brain development, including neuronal migration.
