There exists a strong correlation between asthma and sensitization to indoor allergens. This study reports on the secondary structure of the major house dust mite allergen Der p 2, determined using heteronuclear NMR methods. The DNA was subcloned from the yeast expression vector pSAY1 into the high yield bacterial expression vector pET21a, resulting in yields of 50 mg/liter. The recombinant protein was shown to have immunoreactivity comparable with that of the natural mite protein using competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a modified monoclonal radioallergosorbent test (RAST). The secondary structure was determined by examining chemical shifts, short and long range NOESYs, JHN-HA coupling constants, and amide exchange rates. From these data, it is clear that Der p 2 is composed of beta-sheets and random coil. Based on long range distance constraints, a number of beta-strands were aligned into two three-stranded, anti-parallel beta-sheets.
