The promoter region of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase gene has been isolated using a Sau3AI genomic library derived from human leukocyte. It lacks typical transcriptional regulatory elements such as TATA and CAAT boxes, but it contains two potential Sp1 binding sites and three putative AP-2 binding elements. The region up to nucleotide position-99 in relation to the predominant transcriptional initiation site exhibits promoter activity as judged by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay and the activity is enhanced both by cAMP and by phorbol ester. Northern blot and Western blot analyses have revealed that expression of the polymerase gene is also stimulated by both of these compounds in cultured HeLa cells. Southern blot hybridization of genomic DNA separately digested with various endonucleases gives a discrete single band in each case when the 5'-untranslated region of the polymerase cDNA is used as a probe. These results indicate that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase is encoded by a unique gene whose expression is regulable by cAMP and by phorbol ester.
