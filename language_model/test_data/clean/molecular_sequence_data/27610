beta-Ethynyltyramine has been shown to be a potent, mechanism-based inhibitor of dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH). This is evidenced by pseudo-first-order, time-dependent inactivation of enzyme, a dependence of inactivation on the presence of ascorbate and oxygen cosubstrates, the ability of tyramine (substrate) and 1-(3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzyl)imidazole-2-thione (competitive multisubstrate inhibitor) to protect against inactivation, and a high affinity of beta-ethynyltyramine for enzyme. Inactivation of DBH by beta-ethynyltyramine is accompanied by stoichiometric, covalent modification of the enzyme. Analysis of the tryptic map following inactivation by [3H]-beta-ethynyltyramine reveals that the radiolabel is associated with a single, 25 amino acid peptide. The sequence of the modified peptide is shown to be Cys-Thr-Gln-Leu-Ala-Leu-Pro-Ala-Ser-Gly-Ile-His-Ile-Phe-Ala-Ser-Gln-Leu- His*- Thr-His-Leu-Thr-Gly-Arg, where His* corresponds to a covalently modified histidine residue. In studies using the separated enantiomers of beta-ethynyltyramine, we have found the R enantiomer to be a reversible, competitive inhibitor versus tyramine substrate with a Ki of 7.9 +/- 0.3 microM. The S enantiomer, while also being a competitive inhibitor (Ki = 33.9 +/- 1.4 microM), is hydroxylated by DBH to give the expected beta-ethynyloctopamine product and also efficiently inactivates the enzyme [kinact(app) = 0.18 +/- 0.02 min-1; KI(app) = 57 +/- 8 microM]. The partition ratio for this process is very low and has been estimated to be about 2.5. This establishes an approximate value for kcat of 0.45 min(-1) and reveals that (S)-beta-ethynyltyramine undergoes a slow turnover relative to that of tyramine (kcat approximately 50 s(-1), despite the nearly 100-fold higher affinity of the inactivator for enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
