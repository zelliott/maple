Phospholipase A (PLA) is one of the few enzymes present in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, and is likely to be involved in the membrane disruption processes that occur during host cell invasion. Both secreted and membrane-bound phospholipase A(2) activities have been described in bacteria, fungi and protozoa. Recently there have been increasing reports on the involvement of PLA in bacterial invasion and pathogenesis. This review highlights the latest findings on PLA as a virulence factor in Gram-negative bacteria.
