Using a new polyclonal antibody against prostacyclin (PGI2)-synthase this enzyme was shown to be present in neuronal cells of bovine, rat and human brain, most abundantly in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and cortical neurons, but not in glial cells. Western blots confirmed the specificity of the antibody and applied to enriched neuronal and astrocyte cultures supported these immunohistochemical data. It was further shown that staining with an anti-nitrotyrosine antibody was positive for PGI2-synthase containing cells. Possible physiological and/or pathophysiological functions of the enzyme in brain are discussed.
