During the last decade, marked progress has been made in the study of the fine details of the structures of milk proteins such as caseins, beta-lactoglobulin, alpha-lactalbumin, and lactotransferrin. Many of the functional properties of the individual milk proteins, as well as the milk protein products, may be described at the molecular level. This article is an attempt to thoroughly review the three-dimensional structures of major milk proteins, and to correlate them with the functional aspects of these proteins as food ingredients.
