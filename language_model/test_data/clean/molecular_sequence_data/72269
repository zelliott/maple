The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) contains genes which confer susceptibility to numerous diseases and must be important in primate evolution. In some instances, genes have been mapped to the region between human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) but precise localization has proven difficult especially since this region is subject to insertions, deletions, and duplications. Utilizing computer similarity searches and coding prediction programs, we have identified several potential coding sequences between HLA-B and TNF. Three of these sequences, PERB11.2, PERB15, and PERB 18, are similar to members of multicopy gene families that are located in other regions of the MHC. The identification of numerous fragmented and intact retroelements (L1, Alu, LTR, and THE sequences) flanking the PERB11 and PERB15 genes suggests that these retroelements are involved in the duplication process. The evaluation of candidate genes for disease susceptibility within the MHC is complicated by their similarity to other members of multicopy gene families. The determination of sequence differences within and between species provides a strategy with which to investigate the candidate genes between HLA-B and TNF.
