The open reading frame (ORF) of the gene for the precursor of the octapeptide Red Pigment Concentrating Hormone (RPCH) from the blue crab Callinectes sapidus was cloned by PCR with oligonucleotides targeted to the initiation and the end of the translation coding sequences. A 272 bp intron was characterized between nucleotides 343 and 344 of the reported cDNA, present in the region coding for the last amino acids of the precursor related peptide of RPCH. The intron genomic structure here described is similar to that reported for the gene coding for the Adipokinetic Hormone (AKH) of the grasshopper Schistocerca nitans.
