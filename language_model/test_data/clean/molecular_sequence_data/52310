DNA sequences required for expression of the mouse cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COXIV) promoter were identified by transient expression of recombinant COXIV-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs in COS and NIH-3T3 cells. Activity of the COXIV promoter is shown to depend upon upstream Sp1 binding sequences and two tandemly repeated 21-base pair sequence elements each mapping to sites of mRNA initiation. Each initiation region repeat contains a binding site for an ets-related transcription factor which demonstrates specificity for the characteristic GGAA ets sequence motif and reactivity with an ets domain-directed monoclonal pan ets antibody. The two 21-base pair repeats are sufficient for transcriptional activity suggesting that the ets-related factor may be involved in both transcriptional activation and start site positioning. The ets-related protein found in COS nuclear extracts is shown to be identical or closely related to the GA-binding protein (GABP) by comparison of electrophoretic mobilities and immunological reactivities of DNA-protein complexes formed with purified recombinant expressed GABP alpha and beta subunits. Sp1 and the GABP-related factors also bind to another mouse cytochrome oxidase subunit gene COXVb. The similar promoter features of these two genes suggests a possible means of coordinate transcriptional regulation among such respiratory proteins.
