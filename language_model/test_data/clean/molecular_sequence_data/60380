The purpose of this study was to investigate the frequency of occurrence of autoantibodies against G-protein coupled cardiovascular receptors and their relation to the clinical manifestation of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Autoantibodies against beta1-receptors, Muscarin-2-receptors, Angiotensin-II-receptor subtype 1 and alpha1-receptors were determined with ELISA in 52 patients with HCM (37 male, 15 female, mean age 55 +/- 15 years) and 40 healthy, age and sex matched controls. The clinical characterization of the HCM-patients included ECG, 24-h Holter, and echocardiography. The results showed that there is no significant difference in the frequency of a single autoantibody between HCM-patients and controls. However, if the number of patients who have autoantibodies against beta1-receptors and/or Muscarin-2-receptors were counted together, there are significantly more autoantibodies in HCM compared to controls (11 vs. 2, p = 0.035). Analysis of clinical data from this pooled group of patients showed that in patients with autoantibodies, heart rate variability (HRV), ultra low frequency (ULF) and very low frequency (VLF) were decreased (HRV by 20%, ULF by 50%, and VLF by 46%, p < 0.008) whereas the QTc-interval was increased by 8% (p < 0.02 each). The ratio of septal to posterior wall thickness was increased by 23% (p = 0.05), and the preejection period was prolonged by 46% in patients with autoantibodies (p < 0.001). These results suggest that the existence of these autoantibodies could be associated with an advanced stage or a severe manifestation of HCM.
