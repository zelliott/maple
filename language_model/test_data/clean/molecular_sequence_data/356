Nerve growth factor was isolated from the Vipera lebetina venom by a four-step procedure including gel filtration, ion exchange, heparin and hydrophobic chromatography. The purified protein is a glycosylated non-covalently bound homodimer with monomeric molecular mass of 14,380 Da. The cDNA encoding NGF is cloned and sequenced. The amino acid sequence translated from the cDNA comprises 117 or 119 amino acids depending on the N-terminus (truncated or not). The recombinant NGF (expressed in Escherichia coli) was used to prepare the anti-NGF antiserum. The antiserum interacted with the wild-type NGF and enabled to localize NGF during the purification procedure in parallel with MALDI-TOF analysis of tryptic peptides. The isolated NGF caused neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells in concentrations beginning from 2.5 ng/ml.
