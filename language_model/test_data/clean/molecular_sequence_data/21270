We announce the genome sequence of one of the most prevalent lactic acid bacteria present during the manufacturing process of cane juice, the type strain Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides KCTC 3652 (3,244,985 bp, with a G+C content of 38.3%), which consists of 1,160 large contigs (>100 bp in size). All of the contigs were assembled by the Newbler Assembler 2.3 software program (454 Life Sciences).
