The structures of the 6-deoxytalose-containing O-specific polysaccharides from the O45 antigen, an O45-related antigen (O45rel), and the O66 antigen (lipopolysaccharides, LPSs) of Escherichia coli were elucidated by chemical characterization and by one- and two-dimensional 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The O45 and O45-related polysaccharides have the following general structure: [formula: see text] For the O45 antigen, X is alpha-D-FucpNAc and for the O45-related antigen, X is beta-D-GlcpNAc. The structure of the O66 polysaccharide is [formula: see text]
