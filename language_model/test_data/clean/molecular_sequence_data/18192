Three genes and one mutant gene for tRNA(Phe) (GAA) and one gene for tRNA(Ala) (UGC) were isolated from a whole-cell DNA library of Arabidopsis thaliana. All three tRNA(Phe) genes are identical in their nucleotide sequence, but differ in their 5' and 3' flanking regions. The mutant tRNA(Phe) (GAA) gene differs from the other three genes by one nucleotide change from highly conserved G to C at the 57th nucleotide position. The primary structure of the first tRNA(Ala) gene was also determined in this experiment.
