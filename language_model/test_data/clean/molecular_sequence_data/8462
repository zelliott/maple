We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of a 44 420 bp DNA fragment from chromosome XIV of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The sequence data revealed 23 open reading frames (ORFs) larger than 300 bp, covering 73.5% of the sequence. The ORFs N2418, N2428, N2441, N2474 and N2480 correspond to previously sequenced S. cerevisiae genes coding respectively for the mitochondrial import protein Mas5, the nucleolar protein Nop2, the outer mitochondrial membrane porin Por1, the cytochrome c oxidase polypeptide VA precursor CoxA and the yeast protein tyrosine phosphatase Msg5. Translation products of three other ORFs N2406, N2411 and N2430 exhibit similarity to previously known S. cerevisiae proteins: the ribosomal protein YL9A, the protein Nca3 involved in the mitochondrial expression of subunits 6 and 8 of the ATP synthase and actin; in addition N2505 presents strong similarity to an ORF of chromosome IX. The predicted protein products of ORFs N2417 and N2403 present similarities with domains from proteins of other organisms: the Candida maltosa cycloheximide-resistance protein, the human interleukin enhancer-binding factor (ILF-2). The 12 remaining ORFs show no significant similarity to known proteins. In addition, we have detected a DNA region very similar to the yeast transposon Ty 1-15 of which insertion has disrupted a tRNA(Asp) gene.
