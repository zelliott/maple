Selenocysteine (Sec) is co-translationally incorporated into selenoproteins at a reprogrammed UGA codon. In mammals, this requires a dedicated machinery comprising a stem-loop structure in the 3' UTR RNA (the SECIS element) and the specific SECIS Binding Protein 2. In this report, disorder-prediction methods and several biophysical techniques showed that ca. 70% of the SBP2 sequence is disordered, whereas the RNA binding domain appears to be folded and functional. These results are consistent with a recent report on the role of the Hsp90 chaperone for the folding of SBP2 and other functionally unrelated proteins bearing an RNA binding domain homologous to SBP2.
