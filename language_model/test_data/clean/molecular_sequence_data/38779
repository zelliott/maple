The dioecious plant Rumex acetosa shows intraspecific karyotype variation, caused by supernumerary heterochromatic segments or DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2 phenylindole)-bands at the ends of the short arms of three pairs of autosomes. A DNA sequence (RAE730) specific to the supernumerary heterochromatic segments was cloned and sequenced. RAE730 was about 730 bp and AT-rich (71% AT-content). Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), RAE730 was localized in the supernumerary DAPI-positive heterochromatic segments on several mitotic chromosomes and chromocenters in interphase nuclei, but not in the DAPI-bands of Y or B chromosomes. RAE730 was tandemly arranged in the genome, and the copy number varied between plants from 40000 to 304000 copies per 2C, corresponding to the relative amount of supernumerary heterochromatic segments per genome. These results indicate that the karyotype variation caused by the supernumerary heterochromatic segment was generated by amplification or reduction of the tandem repeats of RAE730.
