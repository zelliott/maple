To detect genetic mutations associated with autosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness (ADCSNB) in a family from Henan province.

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of 14 family members. Based on 3 genes reported previously, PCR primers were designed and corresponding exons containing the mutation sites were amplified with PCR. PCR products were purified and directly sequenced.

A c.281C>T heterozygous missense mutation was detected in RHO gene in all of the patients. This mutation can cause a change of the protein structure (p.Thr94Ile). The same mutation was not detected in normal individuals from the family and 50 normal controls.

A c.281C>T mutation in RHO gene is responsible for the onset of ADCSNB in this Chinese family and results in symptoms of night blindness.
