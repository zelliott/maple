Carnobacterium maltaromaticum UAL26 produces the antimicrobial peptides (bacteriocins) piscicolin 126, first isolated from C. maltaromaticum JG126, and carnobacteriocin BM1, first isolated from C. maltaromaticum LV17. C. maltaromaticum UAL26 is especially inhibitory to strains of Listeria monocytogenes. Bacteriocin activity is not observable in the supernatant of cultures of UAL26 grown in liquid media at 25 degrees C, but at temperatures less than 19 degrees C bacteriocin activity can be detected. In contrast to JG126, the piscicolin 126 operon is downregulated in UAL26 at higher temperature, and piscicolin 126 mRNA is not detected when UAL26 is grown at 25 degrees C. Bacteriocin production in UAL26 grown at 15 degrees C can be induced by addition of 10(-10) M of chemically synthesized piscicolin 126 induction peptide (PisN). However, induction of bacteriocin production in UAL26 grown at 25 degrees C requires 10(-7) M of PisN. The sequence of the piscicolin 126 operon in UAL26 contains 34 single nucleotide differences compared with the piscicolin 126 operon in JG126, including single nucleotide differences in the immunity, histidine kinase, dedicated ABC-transporter and accessory genes, as well as a single nucleotide deletion in the transport accessory gene. This deletion causes a frameshift, resulting in truncation of the PisE transport accessory protein in UAL26.
