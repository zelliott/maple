ATP-binding cassette transporter isoform C2 (ABCC2) localizes to the apical plasma membrane in polarized cells. Apical localization of ABCC2 in hepatocytes plays an important role in biliary excretion of endobiotics and xenobiotics, but the mechanism by which ABCC2 localizes to the apical membrane has not been conclusively elucidated. Here, we investigate the role of scaffolding proteins on ABCC2 localization with a focus on the function of PDZK1 (post-synaptic density 95/disk large/zonula occludens-1 domain containing 1) in regulating ABCC2 localization. The C-terminal 77 residues of ABCC2 were used to probe interacting proteins from HepG2 cells. Protein mass fingerprinting identified PDZK1 as a major interacting protein. PDZK1 associated with the plasma membrane, most likely at the apical vacuoles of HepG2 cells. Affinity pull-down assays confirmed that the C-terminal NSTKF of ABCC2 bound to the fourth PDZ domain of PDZK1. Removal of this PDZ-binding motif significantly reduced the normal apical localization of ABCC2. In HepG2 cells, overexpression of this fourth domain overcame endogenous PDZK1 and reduced the ABCC2 localization at the apical membrane with a reciprocal increase of intracellular accumulation of mislocalized ABCC2. These results suggest a possible role for an interaction between ABCC2 and PDZK1 in apical localization of ABCC2 in hepatocytes.
