Human papillomavirus (HPV) type 97 was identified and the genome was cloned from cervicovaginal cells of a Costa Rican woman with a normal Pap smear. The HPV97 L1 open reading frame (ORF) was most closely related to HPV45 (84% identity) and HPV18 (79% identity), placing it into the high-risk alpha7 species. Ectopic expression of the HPV97 E6 and E7 proteins significantly decreased steady state p53 and pRb levels using an in vitro cotransfection assay, respectively. These data suggest that HPV97 shares a most recent common ancestor with HPV18 and HPV45 and should be evaluated in cancer specimens from different geographic populations.
