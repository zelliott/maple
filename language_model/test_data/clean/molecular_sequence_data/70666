A pink-colored iron-binding protein has been found in large amount in human seminal plasma and identified as a lactoferrin isoform. Its purification, by a modification of a three-step chromatography procedure developed in an attempt to purify a ribonuclease from the same fluid, provided about 15-18 mg of pure protein from 100 ml of seminal plasma. Despite its ability to bind a ribonuclease ligand during the affinity step, the iron-binding protein did not display any detectable RNase activity in a standard assay with yeast RNA as substrate. It showed an apparent molecular weight of 76 kDa and resulted to be quite similar, if not identical, to human milk lactoferrin in many respects. Its N-terminal sequence (31 amino acid residues) starting with Arg-3 was identical to that of one of the N-terminally truncated lactoferrin variants isolated from human milk. Moreover, the amino acid sequence of a number of peptides, which represented about 23% of the entire sequence, has been also shown to be identical to that of the corresponding peptides of human milk lactoferrin. Double diffusion analysis revealed full recognition by antibodies anti-human milk lactoferrin of the human seminal plasma protein. Using immunoblotting analysis, both human milk lactoferrin and human seminal protein were recognized by antibodies anti-milk lactoferrin. When tested for its iron binding capacity, with Fe-NTA as iron donor, the protein purified was able to bind iron up to 100% saturation, as judged by absorbance at 465 nm.
