The gene which encodes the elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) of the archaebacterium Thermoplasma acidophilum (tuf-gene) has been cloned and sequenced. The gene coding for elongation factor EF-2 was found downstream from the 3' end of the tuf-gene. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of Thermoplasma EF-1 alpha with EF-1 alpha sequences of other organisms showed that the highest similarity values were found between T. acidophilum and Methanococcus vannielii.
