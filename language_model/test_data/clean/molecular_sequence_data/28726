Phylogenetically diverse clones of the partial 16S rDNA (ca. 850 bp) of bacteria belonging to the bacteroides subgroup of the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides phylum were collected from the symbiotic microbial communities in the guts of six termite species without cultivation. Combined with the sequences reported previously, a total of thirty phylotypes of the subgroup were identified and classified into five phylogenetic clusters. One that was comprised of the phylotypes from a single termite species was related to the genus Rikenella. Two were clustered each with some cultured strains, genera of which have not been clearly defined yet. The remaining two clusters had no culturable representatives, suggesting the presence of yet-uncultivated genera within the termite guts. From these sequence data, we designed a specific primer for the bacteroides subgroup, which was successful in the terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis to detect the phylotypes of the subgroup in the termite gut.
