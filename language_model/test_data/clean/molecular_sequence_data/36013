The solid (gel)-phase peptide synthesis of peptides, each containing an azaglutamine residue, has been examined. Procedures using various mono-, di- and tripeptide and carbazate fragments containing or relating to an azaglutamine (1) residue have been evaluated. N-Activation of the amino-terminus of a resin-bound peptide with bis-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)carbonate (2) yielded the terminal isocyanate species, which reacted with protected carbazates to give resin-bound protected peptides containing the aza-residue. By contrast, coupling of activated amino-acid derivates to the free amino-group of a resin-bound peptide with an aza-residue at the N-terminus was a slow and unsatisfactory process. It is concluded that the route yielding the best results involves the reaction of a protected amino-acyl carbazate to a resin-bound isocyanate-activated peptide.
