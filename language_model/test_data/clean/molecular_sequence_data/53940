We earlier identified the GTPBP1 gene which encodes a putative GTPase structurally related to peptidyl elongation factors. This finding was the result of a search for genes, the expression of which is induced by interferon-gamma in a macrophage cell line, THP-1. In the current study, we probed the expressed sequence tag database with the deduced amino acid sequence of GTPBP1 to search for partial cDNA clones homologous to GTPBP1. We used one of the partial cDNA clones to screen a mouse brain cDNA library and identified a novel gene, mouse GTPBP2, encoding a protein consisting of 582 amino acids and carrying GTP-binding motifs. The deduced amino acid sequence of mouse GTPBP2 revealed 44.2% similarity to mouse GTPBP1. We also cloned a human homologue of this gene from a cDNA library of the human T cell line, Jurkat. GTPBP2 protein was found highly conserved between human and mouse (over 99% identical), thereby suggesting a fundamental role of this molecule across species. On Northern blot analysis of various mouse tissues, GTPBP2 mRNA was detected in brain, thymus, kidney and skeletal muscle, but was scarce in liver. Level of expression of GTPBP2 mRNA was enhanced by interferon-gamma in THP-1 cells, HeLa cells, and thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages. In addition, we determined the chromosomal localization of GTPBP1 and GTPBP2 genes in human and mouse. The GTPBP1 gene was mapped to mouse chromosome 15, region E3, and human chromosome 22q12-13.1, while the GTPBP2 gene is located in mouse chromosome 17, region C-D, and human chromosome 6p21-12.
