Phospholipase D (PLD; EC 3.1.4.4) has been proposed to play a pivotal role in various cellular processes, but molecular understanding of this enzyme is rather limited. This report describes the nucleotide sequence, structure, and genomic organization of a PLD gene from castor bean (Ricinus communis L. cv. Hale). The PLD gene was isolated from a castor bean genomic library using the PLD cDNA as a hybridization probe. Sequence comparison with the PLD cDNA revealed that the PLD gene consisted of four exons and three introns, one of which interrupts the 5'-untranslated region. Southern blot analysis indicated that the cloned PLD gene was present as a single-copy gene, and yet there were other PLD or PLD-related sequences in the castor bean genome.
