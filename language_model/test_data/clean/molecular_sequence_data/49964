Heat shock proteins (Hsps) play essential protective roles under stress conditions by preventing the formation of protein aggregates and degrading misfolded proteins. EcHsp31, the yedU (hchA) gene product, is a representative member of a family of chaperones that alleviates protein misfolding by interacting with early unfolding intermediates. The 1.6-A crystal structure of the EcHsp31 dimer reveals a system of hydrophobic patches, canyons, and grooves, which may stabilize partially unfolded substrate. The presence of a well conserved, yet buried, triad in each two-domain subunit suggests a still unproven hydrolytic function of the protein. A flexible extended linker between the A and P domains may play a role in conformational flexibility and substrate binding. The alpha-beta sandwich of the EcHsp31 monomer shows structural similarity to PhPI, a protease belonging to the DJ-1 superfamily. The structure-guided sequence alignment indicates that Hsp31 homologs can be divided in three classes based on variations in the P domain that dramatically affect both oligomerization and catalytic triad formation.
