We performed the first comprehensive peptidomic analysis of neurohormones from hemipteran insects by analyzing the neuropeptides of two major neurohemal organs, namely the corpora cardiaca and abdominal perisympathetic organs. For the experiments we selected four related species of polyphagous stinkbugs (Pentatomidae), three of which are known to attack several important food crops. Peptide sequences were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry; tandem fragmentation of myosuppressin, sNPF, CAPA-periviscerokinins and pyrokinins revealed novel sequences not known from other insects so far. Most Leu/Ile and Glu/Lys ambiguities could be solved by either specific side-chain fragmentations or on-plate acetylation experiments. The identification of the specific sequences provides a solid basis for forthcoming pharmacological tests to study the neuroendocrine system of these pest insects. However, it should be mentioned in this context that the sequences of the peptides from different stinkbugs are likely not representative of Hemiptera in general. The forthcoming release of the genome from the reduviid Rhodnius prolixus will provide sufficient data to clear this point.
