We have cloned an extracellular alpha-glucosidase gene from Aspergillus niger with oligonucleotide probes synthesized on the basis of the determined peptide sequences. The nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame of 985 amino acids split with three introns, and the deduced amino acid sequence was nearly identical to that of the alpha-glucosidase previously determined. The cloned gene was introduced into Aspergillus nidulans, and its expression in the transformants was shown to be regulated by the carbon sources in the medium, suggesting that a common regulatory expression system is shared by these two species as is the case of other starch-degrading enzymes of Aspergillus species.
