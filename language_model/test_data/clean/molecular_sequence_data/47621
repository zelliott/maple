After amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the nucleotide sequences of a 452-bp section of the D-loop region of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were determined in 40 teeth extracted from patients living in Kanagawa prefecture, Japan. Dental DNA was extracted separately from the dental pulp and dentin (i.e., the attached pulp cells from the most superficial layer of the pulp cavity wall) of the same tooth. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the 452-bp region of the D-loop demonstrated that nucleotide substitutions and insertion/deletion events were identical in material from both sources. Thus, dentin produces equivalent results when the dental pulp of a tooth is unsuitable for mtDNA analysis. To establish the reliability of the screening procedure for the sequence analysis, we identified restriction sites for the enzymes KpnI and MnlI in the 452-bp region of the D-loop. Thirteen of 14 patterns of four polymorphisms analyzed using the mtDNA from the 40 tooth samples were identifiable by an initial screening procedure involving restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Combined use of sequence analysis and RFLP analysis proved extremely efficient in analyzing mtDNA polymorphisms, allowing identification of individuals.
