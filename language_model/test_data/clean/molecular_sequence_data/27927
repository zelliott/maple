Some peculiarities of prolactin hydrolysis by rat mammary gland lysosomal proteinases were studied. It was demonstrated that at pH 3.0-3.7 the initial steps of prolactin hydrolysis are under control of cathepsin D. Cysteine cathepsins are responsible for the deep degradation of the peptides formed. The molecular mass of rat mammary gland cathepsin D as determined by chromatography on Sephadex G-100 is about 45 kDa. Using affinity chromatography on hemoglobin-Sepharose 4B, cathepsin D was purified 300--320-fold. The purified enzyme rapidly hydrolyzes low concentrations of prolactin down to peptides with Mr less than 1 kDa. At substrate--enzyme concentration ratios above 3:1, the limited proteolysis of prolactin occurred. At early steps of prolactin hydrolysis the formation of two peptides (Mr approximately 10 kDa) takes place. Deeper degradation of sheep prolactin led to the formation of four peptides with molecular masses of 6630, 3020, 1880 and 1040 Da (data from SDS-PAGE electrophoresis). An analysis of structural peculiarities of prolactin from different animal species revealed that this hormone is protected from the damaging effect of exopeptidases.
