Human organic cation transporter 2 (hOCT2; SLC22A2) is abundantly expressed in the kidney, and it plays important roles in the renal tubular secretion of cationic drugs. Although the transport characteristics of hOCT2 have been studied extensively, there is no information available for the transcriptional regulation of hOCT2. The present study was undertaken to identify the cis-element and trans-factor for basal expression of hOCT2. The transcription start site was located 385 nucleotides above the translation start site by using 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. An approximately 4-kilobase fragment of the hOCT2 promoter region was isolated and the promoter activities were measured in the renal epithelial cell line LLC-PK1. A deletion analysis suggested that the region spanning -91 to -58 base pairs was essential for basal transcriptional activity. This region lacked a TATA-box but contained a CCAAT box and an E-box. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that specific DNA/protein complexes were present in the E-box but not in the CCAAT box, and supershift assays revealed that upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF-1), which belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper family of transcription factors, bound to the E-box. Mutation of the E-box resulted in a decrease in hOCT2 promoter activity, and overexpression of USF-1 enhanced the hOCT2 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. This article reports the first characterization of the hOCT2 promoter and shows that USF-1 functions as a basal transcriptional regulator of the hOCT2 gene via the E-box.
