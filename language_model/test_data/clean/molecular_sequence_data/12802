Point mutations in the gyrA genes of 451 clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated in Japan were detected by a combination of nonradioisotopic single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and by direct sequencing. Six types of gyrA mutations were observed in 149 of the 451 strains (33%), and ofloxacin MICs were greater than 6.25 micrograms/ml for 147 of the 149 strains (98.7%). These mutations were localized between codons 84 and 88, and they were associated with fluoroquinolone resistance. Two types of silent mutations were also found. Among these eight types of mutations, three types are novel, i.e., the serine at position 84 (Ser-84)-->Val (TCA-->GTA), Ser-84-->Leu (TCA-->TTA) plus Ile-86 (ATT-->ATC, silent), and Phe-110 (TTT-->TTC, silent). Among GyrA mutants, strains with a Ser-84-->Leu alteration and strains with a Glu-88-->Lys alteration were dominant. In contrast, few strains had Ser-84-->Ala and Glu-88-->Gly alterations. All fluoroquinolones tested showed greater than a fourfold decrease in their activities in terms of their MICs that inhibited 50% of strains tested for each GyrA mutant, in comparison with their MICs that inhibited 50% of strains tested for susceptible strains. Most of the currently available fluoroquinolones, such as norfloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, lomefloxacin, sparfloxacin, and fleroxacin, were ineffective against each mutant. Mutants containing a Ser-84-->Leu or Val alteration showed high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones, and one containing a Ser-84-->Ala alteration showed relatively low-level resistance. Double mutations were associated with a higher level of resistance than single mutations.
