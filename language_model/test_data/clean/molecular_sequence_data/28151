The induction of several amino acid decarboxylases under anaerobic conditions at low pH has been known for many years, but the mechanism associated with this type of regulation has not been elucidated. To study the regulation of the biodegradative arginine and lysine decarboxylases of Escherichia coli K12, Mudlac fusions to these genes were isolated. Mudlac fusion strains deficient for lysine decarboxylase or arginine decarboxylase were identified using decarboxylase indicator media and analysed for their regulation of beta-galactosidase expression. The position of the Mudlac fusion in lysine decarboxylase-deficient strains has been mapped to the cadA gene at 93.7 minutes, while the Mudlac fusions exhibiting a deficiency in the inducible arginine decarboxylase have been mapped to 93.4 minutes.
