We describe biological and experimental factors that induce variability in reporter ion peak areas obtained from iTRAQ experiments. We demonstrate how these factors can be incorporated into a statistical model for use in evaluating differential protein expression and highlight the benefits of using analysis of variance to quantify fold change. We demonstrate the model's utility based on an analysis of iTRAQ data derived from a spike-in study.
