A cDNA encoding a neuron-specific glutamate transporter was isolated from mouse cerebellum and characterized. Expression of this cDNA in HEK293 cells induced high-affinity uptake of L-glutamate that was dependent on external Na+. The deduced amino-acid sequence of the cDNA shares 96% identity with its human homologue. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues revealed that the mRNA of this transporter is specific to the brain. In situ hybridization in mouse brain sections showed that the mRNA is expressed densely and selectively in cell bodies of Purkinje cells.
