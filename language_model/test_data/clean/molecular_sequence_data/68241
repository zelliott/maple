A cDNA coding for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) was isolated from a cDNA library from Solanum tuberosum and the sequence of the cDNA was determined. It was inserted into a bacterial expression vector and a PEPC- Escherichia coli mutant could be complemented by the cDNA construct. A functional fusion protein could be synthesized in E. coli. The properties of this PEPC protein clearly resembled those of typical C3 plant enzymes.
