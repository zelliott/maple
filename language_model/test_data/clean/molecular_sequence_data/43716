The partition matrix is a graphical tool for comparative analysis of nucleotide sequences following alignment. It is particularly useful for investigating the divergent phylogenies of sequence regions undergoing reticulate evolution. A partition matrix is generated by determining the consistency of the parsimoniously informative sites in a set of aligned sequences with the binary partitions inferred from the sequences. Since the linear order of sites is maintained, the matrix can be used to assess whether the distribution of sites either supporting or conflicting with particular partitions changes along the length of the alignment. The usefulness of the matrix in allowing visual identification of differences in evolutionary history among regions depends on the order in which partitions are shown; several suitable ordering schemes are proposed. We demonstrate the use of the partition matrix in interpreting the evolution of the pseudoautosomal boundary region on the sex chromosome of catarrhine primates. Its routine use should help to avoid attempts to derive single phylogenies from sequences whose evolution has been reticulate and to identify the gene conversion or recombination events underlying the reticulation. The method is relatively fast. It is exploratory, and it can form the basis for more formal analysis, which we discuss.
