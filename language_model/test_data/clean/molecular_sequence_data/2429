A potent collagenase inhibitor was purified from cells of calf aorta medial tissue maintained in culture. This molecule was characterized and identified as TIMP (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases). Formation of a TIMP--collagenase complex was demonstrated chromatographically using pure TIMP and pure pig synovial cell collagenase. The N-terminal aminoacid sequence of TIMP was determined and, using appropriate oligonucleotide probes the human genes was cloned from a human cDNA bank. This gene was expressed in E. coli, and fully active TIMP was obtained after a denaturation renaturation process. The interest of TIMP as a model for the design of novel collagenase inhibitors is discussed.
