The receptor for the steroid hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] belongs to a superfamily of steroid and triidothyronine (T3) receptors. As yet no 1,25(OH)2D3 response element (DRE) has been identified. Since the T3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors are structurally homologous, we have used the nucleotide sequence of the T3 response element to carry out a computer search of the promoter region of several 1,25(OH)2D3 regulated genes. We report here one candidate DRE from the chick calbindin-D28K gene (AGCCCAATGGCTGAACA) and two candidate DRE's from the rat osteocalcin gene (TCCCCACTGGATGAGCG and CCTGCACTGGGTGAATGA).
