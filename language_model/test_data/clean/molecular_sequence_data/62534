The molecular basis of host-tumor interaction in HLA-A31+ cancer patients has not been well understood. This lack of clarification is hampering the development of specific immunotherapies for these patients. This study aimed to identify a set of CTL-epitope peptides applicable for the specific immunotherapy of cancer patients with HLA-A31 allele. HLA-A31 allele is expressed in 5-10% of the world population, with the highest expression among Brazilian Amerinds (65%), and the lowest in the Eskimo population (0%). We report herein four cDNAs encoding CTL-epitopes and 7 epitope peptides with the ability to induce HLA-A31-restricted CTLs cytotoxic to tumor cell lines in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HLA-A31+ cancer patients. These peptides might be useful for the development of a peptide-based immunotherapy for HLA-A31+ cancer patients.
