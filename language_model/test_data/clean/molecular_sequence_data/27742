The insulin secretory granule of the pancreatic B cell is a complex intracellular organelle comprised of a many proteins with different catalytic activities and messenger functions. With the advent of tumour models of the B cells and the application of immunological and molecular cloning techniques considerable progress has been made in recent years towards the elucidation of the structure and function of these granule proteins. A number of examples are selected here for review. Particular emphasis given to how the activities of quite different granule proteins are interdependent and how this contributes to the co-ordination and integration of the organelle's biological functions.
