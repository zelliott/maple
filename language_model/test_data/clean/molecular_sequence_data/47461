TM4-B is a novel member of the Tetraspanin superfamily and displays characteristics typical of the superfamily. It bears significant homology to other superfamily members and is most similar to Tspan-1. This molecule is broadly expressed in most human tissues and cell lines including neural and bone marrow derived tissues. TM4-B was mapped to the q34 region on human chromosome 9.
