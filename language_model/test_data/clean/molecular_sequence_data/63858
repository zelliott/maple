Paprika and pimiento are used as vegetables and spices. We have obtained three new acyclic diterpene glycosides, called capsianosides XVII (1), V methyl ester (2) and XIV (3) together with capsianosides I and II from the aerial parts of paprika and pimiento. The structures of these compounds have been established by (1)H- and (13)C-NMR spectra and two-dimensional NMR methods.
