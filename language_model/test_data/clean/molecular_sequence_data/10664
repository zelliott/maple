Antibacterial activity of quinolones against three species of coagulase-negative staphylococci was investigated. Tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin exhibited potent activities against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus saprophyticus compared with other quinolones tested. From the analysis of the DNA sequence in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR), greater than 80% homology was recognized in coagulase-negative staphylococci. A series residue was conserved in all six species at the position corresponding to position 84 in Staphylococcus aureus.
