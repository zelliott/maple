Ribosomal protein L2 from Escherichia coli binds to and protects from nuclease digestion a substantial portion of 'domain IV' of 23S rRNA. In particular, oligonucleotides derived from the sequence 1757-1935 were isolated and shown to rebind specifically to protein L2 in vitro. Other L2-protected oligonucleotides, also derived from domain IV (i.e. from residues 1955-2010) did not rebind to protein L2 in vitro nor did others derived from domain I. Given that protein L2 is widely believed to be located in the peptidyl transferase centre of the 50S ribosomal subunit, these data suggest that domain IV of 23S rRNA is also present in that active site of the ribosomal enzyme.
