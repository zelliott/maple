EGF-TM7 receptors are adhesion class heptahelical molecules predominantly expressed by cells of the immune system. Based on an analysis of the recently unraveled genome, the EGF-TM7 family of the rat is described here. Like the mouse, the rat has three EGF-TM7 receptors--CD97, EMR1 and EMR4. The highest conservation between the orthologues lies within the membrane-spanning part and emphasizes the functional importance of this region.
