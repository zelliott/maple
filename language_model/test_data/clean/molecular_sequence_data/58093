To determine if human graft versus host disease (GvHD) is associated with any detectable change in cytokine gene expression in the skin and lymphoid organs.

Reverse transcriptase and the polymerase chain reaction were used to amplify mRNA for interleukins-1 (IL-1), -2 (IL-2), -4 (IL-4) and -6 (IL-6), IL-2 receptor (IL-2R), tumour necrosis factors alpha (TNF-alpha) and beta (TNF-beta), gamma interferon (IFN gamma) and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in frozen punch biopsy specimens of skin and necropsy samples of skin, lymph node, and spleen.

No cytokine mRNA was detected in the punch biopsy specimens except weak signals for IL-6 and IL-1 and GM-CSF in two normal donors and IL2-R in one patient with GvHD. In samples of skin taken at necropsy, however, significant quantities of mRNA for TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, and IL-4 were detected in patients who had or had had GvHD in contrast to those without the disease whose skin lacked mRNA for these products but contained detectable quantities of IL-1, IL2-R, IL-6 and GM-CSF. There seemed to be a reciprocal relation between TNF-alpha and IL-4. In necropsy samples of lymph node and spleen a pattern of cytokine production similar to that in the skin was observed with a preponderance of TNF-alpha, TNF-beta and IL-4 in patients with GvHD and GM-CSF and IL-6 in those without the disease.

The local synthesis of these molecules would explain many of the morphological and immunohistological features of GvHD. The failure to detect TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, and IL-4 in skin biopsy specimens exhibiting GvHD is probably due to their small size but further investigations are required.
