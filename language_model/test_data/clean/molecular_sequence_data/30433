It is shown that, when irradiated in the visible, ethidium bromide (EB) engages in direct photochemistry with its DNA binding site. At the photochemical end point, an average of one single-strand break is produced per bound EB molecule in a reaction which also bleaches the dye chromophore. Using high-resolution electrophoresis, we have mapped the distribution of EB photocleavage sites on DNA, at one-base resolution. It is argued that because the photocleavage is stoichiometric, the resulting pattern is similar to, if not identical with, the local distribution of EB binding affinity. When interpreted in the context of the extensive thermodynamic and structural data which are available for EB, a binding distribution of that kind can be used to infer details of DNA structure variation within the underlying helix. As a first application of the method, we have used EB to probe the structure of a 265 bp fragment of DNA, which had been described as being bent as the result of a periodic array of oligo(A) segments [Kitchin et al. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11302]. The EB mapping data provide evidence that the oligo(A) elements in this fragment assume a local secondary structure which is different than that assumed by isolated ApA nearest neighbors and that the ends of the oligo(A) elements comprise a junctional domain with EB binding properties which differ from those of the oligo(A) element or of random-sequence DNA.
