A Trypanosoma cruzi cDNA lambda gt11 recombinant, C-P0, encoding the carboxyterminus of a highly antigenic ribosomal P protein, was isolated. Sequence comparisons and immunological evidence allowed its identification as the C-terminal region of the T. cruzi 38-kDa ribosomal P0 protein. This recombinant failed to react with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) anti-P antibodies. The T. cruzi ribosomal P0 protein is the first reported eukaryotic ribosomal P protein presenting this immunological property, probably due to its peculiar C-terminal-amino-acid sequence, FGMGALF, which differs from the conserved eukaryotic ribosomal P protein C-terminal consensus, MGFGLFD.
