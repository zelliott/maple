Human connexin 26 (Cx26) has been considered to be a candidate suppressor gene in mammary epithelial cells. To gain insight into the transcriptional regulation of this gene, we have cloned and sequenced the 5' portion of the gene, which extends 4.8 kb upstream from the ATG translation start site. The 3' end of the non-coding exon 1 (160 bp) is located at 3149 bp upstream from the 5' end of exon 2. Comparison between the human Cx26 gene and the mouse gene reveals a highly conserved promoter region with 81% homology. In addition to six GC boxes and two GT boxes, a TTAAAA box is located at -24 to -19 bp upstream of the transcription start point. Analogous to the mouse beta-casein gene, the promoter region of the human Cx26 gene also contains a YY1-like binding site and a consensus mammary gland factor binding site.
