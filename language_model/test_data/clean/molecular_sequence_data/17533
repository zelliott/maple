A human immunoglobulin (Ig)-related gene, covering approximately 8 kb, was isolated from a cosmid genomic library, by hybridization with a C lambda probe and with a lambda-like probe. This gene was identified as 14.1 It belongs to the human lambda-like cluster which is composed of three genes (14.1, 16.1 and F lambda 1) that do not rearrange. Sequence data indicate that 14.1 is organized similarly to the mouse lambda 5 gene. It contains three exons with lengths of 69, 38, and 106 codons as compared with 65, 38, and 106 for exons 1, 2, and 3 of mouse lambda 5, respectively. The corresponding homology values were 61, 66 and 75.5%. Using a 14.1 specific probe containing exon 1, we showed that this gene was selectively expressed in human pre-B cell lines. It is likely to encode a 213-amino acid lambda-like light chain that would associate with mu chains and play an important role in the early steps of B cell differentiation.
