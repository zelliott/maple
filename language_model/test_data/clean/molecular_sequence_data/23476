Recently various methods for the N-terminal sulfonation of peptides have been developed for the mass spectrometric analyses of proteomic samples to facilitate de novo sequencing of the peptides produced. This paper describes the isotope-coded N-terminal sulfonation (ICenS) of peptides; this procedure allows both de novo peptide sequencing and quantitative proteomics to be studied simultaneously. As N-terminal sulfonation reagents, 13C-labeled 4-sulfophenyl[13C6]isothiocyanate (13C-SPITC) and unlabeled 4-sulfophenyl isothiocyanate (12C-SPITC) were synthesized. The experimental and reference peptide mixtures were derivatized independently using 13C-SPITC and 12C-SPITC and then combined to generate an isotopically labeled peptide mixture in which each isotopic pair differs in mass by 6 Da. Capillary reverse-phase liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry experiments on the resulting peptide mixtures revealed several immediate advantages of ICenS in addition to the de novo sequencing capability of N-terminal sulfonation, namely, differentiation between N-terminal sulfonated peptides and unmodified peptides in mass spectra, differentiation between N- and C-terminal fragments in tandem mass spectra of multiply protonated peptides by comparing fragmentations of the isotopic pairs, and relative peptide quantification between proteome samples. We demonstrate that the combination of N-terminal sulfonation and isotope coding in the mass spectrometric analysis of proteomic samples is a viable method that overcomes many problems associated with current N-terminal sulfonation methods.
