1. Hemorrhagic metalloproteinase (HMP) was isolated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-100 (superfine) and affinity chromatography on agarose HPS-7. 2. Hemorrhagic metalloproteinase is a glycoprotein with mol. wt 56.3 kDa. It contains 1 zinc atom per molecule of protein. 3. Hemorrhagic metalloproteinase hydrolyzes casein, fibrinogen and splits the insulin B chain at positions Ala14-Leu15, Tyr16-Leu17, His10-Leu11. It digests A alpha chain of fibrinogen.
