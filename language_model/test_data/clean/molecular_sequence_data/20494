Ring chromosomes are cytogenetic hallmarks of genomic amplification in several bone and soft tissue tumors, in particular atypical lipomatous tumors (ALT). In ALT, the ring chromosomes invariably contain amplified material from the central part of the long arm of chromosome 12, mainly 12q12-->15, but often also segments from other chromosomes are involved. Previous studies have shown that one of the recurrent amplicons in ALT, located in 12q13.3-14.1 and harboring the candidate target genes TSPAN31 and CDK4, often has a sharp centromeric border. To characterize this breakpoint region in more detail, 12 cases of ALT with ring chromosomes were analyzed by array comparative genomic hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization. In the seven cases showing a sharply delineated amplicon in 12q13.3-14.1, the breakpoint region was further investigated by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Vectorette PCR. The breakpoints clustered to a 146-kb region containing 11 genes. Whereas there was no indication that the breakpoints gave rise to fusion genes, in silico analysis revealed that the breakpoint region was enriched for repeated elements that could be important for ring chromosome formation in ALT.
