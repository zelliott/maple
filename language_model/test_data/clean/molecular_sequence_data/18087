Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is capable of facultative photoheterotrophy with glucose as the sole carbon source. Eight mutants that were unable to take up glucose were transformed with plasmids from pooled gene banks of wild-type Synechocystis DNA prepared in an Escherichia coli vector that does not replicate in Synechocystis. One mutant (EG216) could be complemented with all gene banks to restore ability for photoheterotrophic growth. One of the gene banks was fractionated into single clones and plasmid DNA from each clone used to complement EG216. This yielded a 1.5 kb DNA fragment that was sequenced. It contained one complete open reading frame (gtr) whose putative gene product displayed high sequence conservation with the xylose transporter of E. coli and the mammalian glucose transporters. Further, the isolated gtr gene interrupted in vitro by a kanamycin resistance cassette could be used to construct mutants from wild-type Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that lacked a functional glucose transporter, thus confirming the identity of the gtr gene with the glucose transporter gene. This is the first prokaryotic glucose transporter known to share a sequence relationship with mammalian glucose transporters and the first sugar transporter from a cyanobacterium characterized at the sequence level.
