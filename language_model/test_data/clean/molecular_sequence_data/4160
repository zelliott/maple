We report the cloning and functional analysis of a Pad1 homologue (SmPOH) from Schistosoma mansoni. SmPOH encodes a protein of approximately 35 kDa with high amino acid identities to yeast Pad1 (65%) and its human homologue, POH1 (78%). Members of the Pad1 family are subunits of the 26S proteasome and have been implicated as positive modulators of transcription in yeast. Recombinant SmPOH expressed in COS7 cells exhibited a punctate pattern of distribution throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus, predominantly in the nuclear periphery, a distribution consistent with that of the cellular proteasome. Transient overexpression of SmPOH in COS7 cells caused a dose-dependent stimulation in AP-1 transcriptional activity, as determined by a reporter gene assay. This effect was associated with a pronounced increase in the levels of cellular c-Jun. In vitro degradation assays further demonstrated that SmPOH specifically decreased the rate of c-Jun degradation in a dose dependent manner. Taken together, these results suggest that SmPOH, and possibly other related Pad1 proteins, function as positive modulators of transcription by increasing the stability of cellular c-Jun, making elevated amounts of this protein available for transactivation of AP-1-responsive genes.
