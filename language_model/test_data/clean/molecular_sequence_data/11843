Two cDNAs, designated xynA and manA, encoding xylanase A (XYLA) and mannanase A (MANA), respectively, were isolated from a cDNA library derived from mRNA extracted from the anaerobic fungus, Piromyces. XYLA and MANA displayed properties typical of endo-beta 1,4-xylanases and mannanases, respectively. Neither enzyme hydrolyzed cellulosic substrates. The nucleotide sequences of xynA and manA revealed open reading frames of 1875 and 1818 base pairs, respectively, coding for proteins of M(r) 68,049 (XYLA) and 68,055 (MANA). The deduced primary structure of MANA revealed a 458-amino acid sequence that exhibited identity with Bacillus and Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa mannanases belonging to glycosyl hydrolase Family 26. A 40-residue reiterated sequence, which was homologous to duplicated noncatalytic domains previously observed in Neocallimastix patriciarum xylanase A and endoglucanase B, was located at the C terminus of MANA. XYLA contained two regions that exhibited sequence identity with the catalytic domains of glycosyl hydrolase Family 11 xylanases and were separated by a duplicated 40-residue sequence that exhibited strong homology to the C terminus of MANA. Analysis of truncated derivatives of MANA confirmed that the N-terminal 458-residue sequence constituted the catalytic domain, while the C-terminal domain was not essential for the retention of catalytic activity. Similar deletion analysis of XYLA showed that the C-terminal catalytic domain homologue exhibited catalytic activity, but the corresponding putative N-terminal catalytic domain did not function as a xylanase. Fusion of the reiterated noncatalytic 40-residue sequence conserved in XYLA and MANA to glutathione S-transferase, generated a hybrid protein that did not associate with cellulose, but bound to 97- and 116-kDa polypeptides that are components of the multienzyme cellulase-hemicellulase complexes of Piromyces and Neocallimastix patriciarum, respectively. The role of this domain in the assembly of the enzyme complex is discussed.
