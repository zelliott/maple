The neuregulins are a family of factors that perform important functions during the development of the nervous system, neuromuscular junction and heart. These factors are also involved in nervous system disorders, and in the generation and progression of tumors.

There are four genes and many isoforms which share a similar molecular structure. The neuregulins are differentially expressed and bind with different affinities to specific combinations of ErbB receptors. This level of complexity is directing numerous researching in order to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate a specific pathway.

Neuregulin ErbB receptor complexes activate specific intracellular pathways that culminate in very different fates: differentiation or proliferation.
