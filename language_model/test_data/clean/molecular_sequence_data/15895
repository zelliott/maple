The absolutely conserved TACTAAC box within introns of RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae serves an indispensable role in lariat formation. We show in this report that rather short palindromic sequences inserted into the yeast actin gene intron immediately 3' to the TACTAAC box block the second but not the first splicing step. In contrast, a palindromic sequence inserted some 23 bp 3' of the TACTAAC box did not affect correct and efficient splicing. The data suggest that hairpin structures that might form adjacent to the branchsite sequence interfere with some necessary alteration of the spliceosome required for 3' intron cleavage and exon ligation.
