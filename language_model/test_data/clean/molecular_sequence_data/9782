Two new isolates of Ehrlichia chaffeensis (designated Jax and St. Vincent) were obtained from patients with fatal ehrlichial infections. Patients developed characteristic manifestations of severe disease due to E. chaffeensis, including marked thrombocytopenia, pulmonary insufficiency, and encephalopathy. Primary isolation was achieved in DH82 cells; the Jax and St. Vincent isolates were detected within 19 and 8 days postinoculation, respectively. The isolates were characterized by molecular evaluation of the 16S rRNA gene, the groESL heat shock operon, a 120-kDa immunodominant protein gene, and an incompletely characterized repetitive-motif sequence (variable-length PCR target [VLPT]). The sequences were compared with those of the corresponding molecular regions in the type isolate (Arkansas). St. Vincent contained one fewer repeat unit in both the 120-kDa protein gene and the VLPT compared with corresponding sequences of the Jax and Arkansas isolates. 16S rRNA gene sequences from the two new isolates had 100% identity to the corresponding sequences of the 91HE17 and Sapulpa isolates of E. chaffeensis, and to the corrected 16S rRNA gene sequence of the Arkansas isolate. The Jax isolate grew more slowly than the St. Vincent isolate in DH82 cells, and both of the new isolates grew more slowly than the extensively passaged Arkansas isolate. Although specific associations between ehrlichial pathogenicity and genotype were not identified from these comparisons, recovery of this organism from a spectrum of clinical presentations remains an integral step in understanding mechanisms of disease caused by E. chaffeensis.
