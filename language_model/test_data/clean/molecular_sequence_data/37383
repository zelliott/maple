Ehrlichia chaffeensis, a tick-transmitted rickettsial agent, is responsible for human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME). In this study, we genetically mapped 10 isolates obtained from HME patients. Sequence analysis of the 28-kDa outer membrane protein (OMP) multigene locus spanning 6 of the 22 tandemly arranged genes identified three distinct genetic groups with shared homology among isolates within each group. Isolates in Groups I and III contained six genes each, while Group II isolates had a gene deletion. There were two regions on the locus where novel gene deletion or insertion mutations occurred, resulting in the net loss of one gene in Group II isolates. Numerous nucleotide differences among genes in isolates of each group also were detected. The shared homology among isolates in each group for the 28-kDa OMP locus suggests the derivation of clonal lineages. Transcription and translation analysis of the locus revealed differences in the expressed genes of different group isolates. Analysis of the 120-kDa OMP gene and variable-length PCR target gene showed size variations resulting from loss or gain of long, direct repeats within the protein coding sequences. To our knowledge this is the first study that looked at several regions of the genome simultaneously, and we provide the first evidence of heterogeneity resulting from gene deletion and insertion mutations in the E. chaffeensis genome. Diversity in different genomic regions could be the result of a selection process or of independently evolved genes.
