Sheep immunised with the Taenia ovis recombinant 45W antigen are protected from infection with the parasite. Two peptides were synthesised corresponding to putative host-protective regions at the N- and C-termini of 45W. Sera from sheep immunised with 45W or related recombinant proteins reacted strongly with the N-terminal peptide. Approximately 40% of the antibody directed against 45WB/X, a truncated form of 45W, was found to be directed against the N-terminal peptide sequence. Sheep were immunised with the N- and C-terminal peptides alone or conjugated to a carrier protein. The N-terminal peptide was found to be highly immunogenic whereas the C-terminal peptide required conjugation to a carrier protein to be immunogenic. Antibodies raised against each of these immunogens crossreacted with the parent protein, 45WB/X, however, only antibodies specific for the N-terminal peptide were found to bind to antigens from the T. ovis oncosphere.
