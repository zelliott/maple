The neurotrophins nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT3) support the survival of subpopulations of primary sensory neurons with defined and distinct physiological characteristics. Only a few genes have been identified as being differentially expressed in these subpopulations, and not much is known about the nature of the molecules involved in the processing of sensory information in NGF-dependent nociceptive neurons or NT3-dependent proprioceptive neurons. We devised a simple dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explant culture system, allowing the selection of neuronal populations preferentially responsive to NGF or NT3. The reliability of this assay was first monitored by the differential expression of the NGF and NT3 receptors trkA and trkC, as well as that of neuropeptides and calcium-binding proteins. We then identified four differentially expressed sodium channels, two enriched in the NGF population and two others in the NT3 population. Finally, using an optimized RNA fingerprinting protocol, we identified 20 additional genes, all differentially expressed in DRG explants cultured with NGF or NT3. This approach thus allows the identification of large number of genes expressed in subpopulations of primary sensory neurons and opens the possibility of studying the molecular mechanisms of nociception and proprioception.
