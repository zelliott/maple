In the course of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe cDNA project, we succeeded in cloning all the genes encoding translation elongation factors EF-1alpha, EF-1beta, EF-1gamma, EF-2 and EF-3. With the exception of the EF-1gamma gene, the nucleotide (nt) sequence of S. pombe elongation factors has not been previously reported. For EF-1alpha, we found three genes whose amino acid (aa) sequences are quite homologous each other (99.5%), but whose 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) are completely different. Southern blot indicated that those three EF-1alpha genes are located at different loci. Northern analysis indicated that one of three EF-1alpha genes was inducible with UV-irradiation, while the level of expression for another of three EF-1alpha genes was repressed by UV and heat-shock (HS) treatments. The aa sequence predicted from the nt sequence of the S. pombe EF-1beta cDNA clone covered almost all the coding sequence (CDS) of EF-1beta except the first methionine which has 55.4% identity with that of S. cerevisiae. We also identified two copies of S. pombe EF-2 genes. Their aa sequences deduced from nt sequences are identical (100%), but they have different 3' UTRs. The location of these two EF-2 genes in different loci was proved by Southern analysis. The S. pombe EF-3 cDNA clone encoded only a third of the CDS from the C-terminal and its deduced aa sequence has a 76% identity with those of other yeasts and fungi.
