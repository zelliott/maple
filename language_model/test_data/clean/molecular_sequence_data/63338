Here we describe the first reported use of a Gram-positive bacterial system for the selection of affinity proteins from large combinatorial libraries displayed on the surface of Staphylococcus carnosus. An affibody library of 3 x 10(9) variants, based on a 58 residue domain from staphylococcal protein A, was pre-enriched for binding to human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) using one cycle of phage display and thereafter transferred to the staphylococcal host ( approximately 10(6) variants). The staphylococcal-displayed library was subjected to three rounds of flow-cytometric sorting, and the selected clones were screened and ranked by on-cell analysis for binding to TNF-alpha and further characterized using biosensor analysis and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The successful sorting yielded three different high-affinity binders (ranging from 95 pM to 2.2 nM) and constitutes the first selection of a novel affinity protein using Gram-positive bacterial display. The method combines the simplicity of working with a bacterial host with the advantages of displaying recombinant proteins on robust Gram-positive bacteria as well as using powerful flow cytometry in the selection and characterization process.
