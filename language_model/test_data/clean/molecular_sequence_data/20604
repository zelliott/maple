The major autolysin AcmA of Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris MG1363 is a modular protein consisting of an N-terminal signal sequence, a central enzymatic region (glu(acma) as a glucosaminidase), and a C-terminal cell-recognition domain (LysM123). glu(acma) (about 160 amino acids) belongs to the glycoside hydrolase (GH) 73 family, and the two acidic residues E128 and D153 have been thought to be catalytically important. In this study, amino-acid substitution analysis of AcmA was first carried out in the Escherichia coli system. Point mutations E94A, E94Q, E128A, D153A, and Y191A markedly reduced cell-lytic activity (3.8%, 1.1%, 4.2%, 4.8%, and 2.4%, respectively), whereas E128Q and D153N retained significant residual activities (32.1% and 44.0%, respectively). On the other hand, Y191F and Y191W mutations retained high activities (66.2% and 46.0%, respectively). These results showed that E94 (rather than E128 and D153) and the aromatic residue Y191 probably play important roles in catalysis of AcmA. Together with mutational analysis of another GH73 glucoaminidase Glu(atlwm) from the Staphylococcus warneri M autolysin Atl(WM), these results suggested that the GH73 members cleave a glycosidic bond via a substrate-assisted mechanism, as postulated in the GH20 members. AcmA and Glu(atlwm) were purified from E. coli recombinant cells, and their enzymatic properties were studied.
