We previously detected in salivary gland secretions of the medicinal leech (Hirudo medicinalis) a novel enzymatic activity, endo-epsilon(gamma-Glu)-Lys isopeptidase, which cleaves isopeptide bonds formed by transglutaminase (Factor XIIIa) between glutamine gamma-carboxamide and the epsilon-amino group of lysine. Such isopeptide bonds, either within or between protein polypeptide chains are formed in many biological processes. However, before we started our work no enzymes were known to be capable of specifically splitting isopeptide bonds in proteins. The isopeptidase activity we detected was specific for isopeptide bonds. The enzyme was termed destabilase. Here we report the first purification of destabilase, part of its amino acid sequence isolation and sequencing of two related cDNAs derived from the gene family that encodes destabilase proteins, and the detection of isopeptidase activity encoded by one of these cDNAs cloned in a baculovirus expression vector. The deduced mature protein products of these cDNAs contain 115 and 116 amino acid residues, including 14 highly conserved Cys residues, and are formed from precursors containing specific leader peptides. No homologous sequences were found in public databases.
