A simplified method of DNA sequencing by dideoxy chain termination is developed that approaches a single-step protocol. Utilizing the sequencing advantages contributed by a thermophilic polymerase and a guanine analog, stable sequencing reaction concentrates have been obtained that readily perform the entire sequencing reaction simply by adding prepared DNA to each of the four reaction concentrates required by this method. The mechanics and dynamics of these reactions have been investigated and the capacity of these reactions to withstand normal user variation is demonstrated. This study focuses on one form of this simplified method embodied in the FASTaq DNA sequencing kit.
