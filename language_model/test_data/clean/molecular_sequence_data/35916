In the 5'-flanking region of the bovine pancreatic ribonuclease gene a sequence has been identified which specifically binds one or more factors present in nuclear protein extracts prepared from bovine pancreas. The binding site, as delineated by footprinting analysis, is located in a region extending from positions -113 to -146 relative to the transcription initiation site of the ribonuclease gene. This region contains consensus sequences for known control transcriptional elements. The observed pattern of protein-DNA interactions is likely to be pancreas-specific as it could not be detected with nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa or bovine aorta endothelium cells.
