We report the isolation and characterization of a murine gene encoding a conserved mammalian nucleolar protein. The protein, called Tsg118, has a predicted molecular mass of 59.4 kDa and a high content of basic amino acids. A homologous human gene was localized to chromosome 16p12.3. The Tsg118 protein is predominantly expressed in proliferating somatic cells and in male germ cells. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy analysis using an affinity-purified anti-Tsg118 serum shows colocalization of Tsg118 and a known nucleolar protein, fibrillarin, to the dense fibrillar component of the nucleolus. The nucleolar localization of the Tsg118 protein appears to be temporally restricted to the interphase stages of the somatic cell cycle and to the meiotic phase of spermatogenesis. We find that the Tsg118 protein localizes to the nucleolus in both proliferating and serum-starved cells. Interestingly, as the nucleolar signal disappears in mitotic cells, the Tsg118 protein instead becomes associated with the surface of the condensed chromosomes.
