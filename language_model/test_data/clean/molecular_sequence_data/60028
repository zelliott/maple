Saponins from black bean (Vigna mungo L. Hepper) were analyzed using positive and negative ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Methanol was used to extract the saponins from defatted black bean, which was partially purified by extraction with n-butanol, and the extract was dialyzed with 3000 M(r) cut-off tubing. The dialyzate was analyzed using mass spectrometry. According to FAB-MS/MS, mixtures from black bean contain soyasaponin I as the predominant saponin. In addition, MS/MS analysis was performed in which the structures of saponins of black bean cotyledon were determined to be soyasaponin I, soyasaponin II, soyasaponin V, 3-O-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 --> 2)-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1 --> 2)-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl]complogenin (saponin A) and 3-O-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 --> 2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 --> 2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl]oleanolic acid (saponin B). For the black bean shell and the root of black bean sprout, analysis confirmed the saponins of soyasaponin I, soyasaponin II, soyasaponin V, saponin A, saponin B, acetylsoyasaponin A(4) and soyasaponin beta(g). Moreover, all the studied saponins were found in the stem and leaves of the black bean sprouts, except soyasaponin beta(g) and acetylsoyasaponin A(4), respectively.
