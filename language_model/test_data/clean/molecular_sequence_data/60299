A cDNA library of Sarcocystis muris cyst merozoites was screened using a digoxigenin-labeled probe. This probe was derived from a 504-bp polymerase-chain-reaction fragment representing part of a thiol proteinase. Several cDNA clones were isolated, one of which (PH08) consists of a nucleotide sequence of 1694 bp and encodes the complete prepropolypeptide of a cathepsin L-like proteinase. PH08 contains an open reading frame of 394 amino acid (aa) residues with a 46-residue signal sequence, which is followed by a 129-residue propeptide and 219 aa residues of the mature enzyme. Two potential glycosylation sites and a putative polyadenylation signal were also identified. The occurrence of the highly conserved interspersed ERFNIN aa motif, not found in cathepsin B-like proteinases, suggests the classification of the enzyme as a cathepsin L-like proteinase. Results worked out in this study will enable production of the recombinant thiol proteinase of S. muris cyst merozoites necessary for study of the substrate specificity as well as other biochemical parameters of this enzyme.
