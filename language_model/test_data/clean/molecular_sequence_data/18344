The cdc2 cell cycle control genes of yeast and man encode 34 kDa protein kinases. Using the human CDC2 gene as a DNA probe we have isolated cDNA clones corresponding to the mouse cdc2 gene. Sequencing of the mouse clones show 96% identity at the amino acid level to the human CDC2 gene and detects a 2 kb RNA product indistinguishable to that seen in human cells. The mouse gene should be useful in studying the functional control of the cell cycle in mouse cells.
