Trihelix DNA-binding factors (or GT factors) bind to GT elements found in the promoters of many plant genes. Although the binding specificity and the transcriptional activity of some members (e.g. GT-1 and GT-2) have been studied, the regulatory function of this family of transcription factors remains largely unknown. In this work, we have characterised a new GT factor, namely GT-3a, and a closely related member, GT-3b. We show that (1) they can form either homo- or heterodimers but do not interact with GT-1; (2) they are predominantly expressed in floral buds and roots; (3) GT-3a cannot bind to the binding sites of GT-1 or GT-2, but binds to the cab2 and rbcS-1A gene promoters via the 5'-GTTAC sequence, which has been previously shown to be the core of the Site 1 type of GT elements. These results suggest that GT-3a and GT-3b belong to a distinct subgroup of GT factors and that each subgroup of GT factors binds to a functionally distinct type of cis-acting GT elements.
