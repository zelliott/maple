Two new microcystins, [L-Ser7]microcystin-LR (1) and [L-Ser7]microcystin-RR (2), were isolated from a filamentous fresh water cyanobacterium (blue-green alga), Anabaena sp. strain 202 A1, along with the two major toxins, [Dha7]microcystin-LR (3) and [Dha7]microcystin-RR (4) and their minor components the D-Asp variants [D-Asp3,Dha7]microcystin-LR (5) and [D-Asp3,Dha7]microcystin-RR (6). Anabaena sp. strain 202 A1 also produced another new toxin, whose structure is tentatively proposed as [D-Asp3,L-Ser7]microcystin-XR (7), where X is a leucine homologue. Anabaena sp. strain 202 A2 produced one new microcystin, 1, and three known microcystins, 3, 4, and 5. The structures of the toxins were assigned based on their amino acid analyses, and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry data.
