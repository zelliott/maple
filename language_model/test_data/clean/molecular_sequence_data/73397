The major outer membrane protein of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, CD, was detergent-extracted from the bacterial cell wall and purified to homogeneity in high yields by a simple process. The purified protein appeared to exhibit immunogenic properties similar to those of native CD exposed on the surface of the bacterium. Antibodies to CD raised in mice specifically bound to intact B. catarrhalis, as determined by flow cytometry analysis. The IgG subclass distributions of anti-CD antibodies in sera from mice immunized with purified CD or with B. catarrhalis were also similar. CD was found to be antigenically conserved among a panel of B. catarrhalis isolates, as demonstrated by the consistent reactivities of mouse anti-CD antisera with a common 60 kDa protein on immunoblots. Furthermore, convalescent sera collected from patients with otitis media due to B. catarrhalis infection were found to be reactive with the CD protein by immunoblotting. Finally, the purified protein induced antibodies in guinea pigs and mice that exhibited in vitro bactericidal activity against the pathogen. Therefore, the native CD outer membrane protein represents a potentially useful antigen for inclusion in a vaccine against B. catarrhalis.
