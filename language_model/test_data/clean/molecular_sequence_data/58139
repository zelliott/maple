Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against HIV-1 protease (HIV PR), the essential protease of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), were produced in Armenian hamsters. Studies of direct binding to synthetic peptides and inhibition of binding to intact protease by peptide competition showed that five mAbs recognized an epitope that includes the sequence LPGRWKPK (residues 38-45), which lies near the region of the protease called the flap. All of the mAbs react specifically with HIV PR in Western blots. Because of structural conservation of the epitope in the proteases of many HIV-1 isolates, mAbs to this epitope are likely to be useful for detection of HIV PR in field isolates of HIV-1. Also, mAbs specific for this epitope, which lies close to the flap of HIV PR, may be useful for functional studies of HIV PR and possibly for the design of inhibitors of protease activity that bind outside the enzyme's catalytic site.
