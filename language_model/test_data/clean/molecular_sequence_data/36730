The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene is highly expressed in cultured rat hepatoma cells, but extinguished in hepatoma x fibroblast hybrids. Extinction of PEPCK gene expression in hybrids is a polygenic process that involves several fibroblast loci, only one of which (tissue-specific extinguisher-1, TSE1) has been characterized to date. To identify sequence elements of the PEPCK gene that are involved both in TSE1-mediated extinction and in TSE1-independent processes, we assayed expression of chimeric PEPCK transgenes in transiently and stably transfected hybrid cells. We report that TSE1 responsiveness mapped to the PEPCK CRE (cAMP response element), as shown previously for the tyrosine aminotransferase gene. This was expected from the recent identification of the TSE1 gene product as a regulatory subunit of protein kinase A. However, none of the transgenes we assayed were responsive to TSE1-independent extinction mechanisms, suggesting that these controls require DNA sequences and/or chromatin structures that were not present in the transfected reporters. The implications of these findings are discussed.
