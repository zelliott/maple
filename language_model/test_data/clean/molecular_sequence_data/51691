The human papillomavirus was detected in cervicovaginal cells by the polymerase chain reaction in 14 of 37 (37.8%) patients attending a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic and in 6 of 43 healthy young women (14.0%) undergoing routine gynecologic examinations who served as controls. The results indicated that even the more malignant types of human papillomaviruses were not uncommon among the control group, and that the prevalence of human papillomavirus infection was significantly higher in STD clinic patients than in the control group. These findings confirm the suggestion that factors other than human papillomavirus infections may be involved in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer.
