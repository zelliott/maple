The organization and expression of a putative serine/threonine kinase gene (designated hcstk), proposed to relate to a conserved eukaryotic signal transduction pathway, was characterized for the socio-economically important pathogen Haemonchus contortus (Nematoda). The entire hcstk gene is approximately 26.7 kb in size, has 26 exons and is inferred to produce multiple isoforms via alternative splicing in its N-terminal header and spacer domains. Comparison of hcstk with its Caenorhabditis elegans homologue, par-1, revealed major differences in genomic organization, exon number and inferred mRNA processing. The expression of hcstk transcripts was highest in the first- and late-fourth-stage larvae of the parasite compared with other developmental stages, somewhat distinct from par-1 in C. elegans. In spite of a substantial amino acid sequence identity in the functional domains between the predicted proteins HcSTK and PAR-1, overall, the findings suggest a unique functional role for each molecule.
