Calcium/calmodulin (CaM) dependent protein kinase I (CaM-KI) is a member of a well-defined multi-functional CaM-K family, but its physiological and developmental functions have yet to be determined. Here, we have cloned two cDNAs encoding CaM-KI from a Xenopus laevis (X. laevis) oocyte cDNA library. One is a novel isoform of CaM-KI, named CaM-KI LiKbeta (XCaM-KI LiKbeta). The other is an alpha isoform of CaM-KI (XCaM-KIalpha), which is a highly related to previously cloned mammalian isoform. XCaM-KIalpha was constantly expressed through embryogenesis, whereas XCaM-KI LiKbeta expression dramatically increased in the neurula stage. Both XCaM-KI isoforms exhibited kinase activity in a Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent manner. Overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of CaM-KI isoforms inhibited cell cleavage in X. laevis embryos and caused a marked change of cell morphology in Hela cells. Taken together, these results suggest that CaM-KI plays a role in cell-structure regulation during early embryonic development.
