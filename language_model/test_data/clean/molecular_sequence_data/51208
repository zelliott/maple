Comparative CD measurements were made on the model helical peptides acetylYEAAAKEAXAKEAAAKAamide and acetylYEAAAEKAXAKEAAAKAamide in which X represents a nonaromatic nonionic residue. The former peptide contains three potential i, i + 4 complementary ion pairs at neutral pH, while the latter peptide contains one potential complementary and two potential antagonistic i, i + 4 ion pairs. The effect of pH and ionic strength on the mean residue ellipticity of these peptides was measured at 222 nm and 0 degrees C. These measurements were analyzed assuming a common two-state helix/coil transition and only i, i, + 4 ion-pair interactions. The analyses suggest that the central ion pairs do modulate helical content while the peripheral ion pairs do not, presumably due to the location of the peripheral ion pairs in the frayed ends of the helix. The complementary central ion pair stabilizes the helix by about 0.4 kcal/mole and the antagonistic central ion pair destabilizes the helix by about 0.2 kcal/mole.
