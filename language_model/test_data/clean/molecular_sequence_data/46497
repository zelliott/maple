Transcobalamin (TC) deficiency (OMIM# 275350) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder that presents in early infancy with a broad spectrum of symptoms, including failure to thrive, megaloblastic anemia, immunological deficiency, and neurological symptoms. Here we report a study of a family (parents and three children) with two children suffering from TC deficiency caused by two different mutations in the TCN2 gene. Initially, molecular genetic analysis of genomic DNA revealed a heterozygous mutation in the +1 position of exon 7 (c.1106+1 G > A) in the father and all three children. Bioinformatic analysis indicates that this mutation causes exon skipping, and further experiments supported this hypothesis and suggested that the mutant allele undergoes nonsense-mediated messenger RNA (mRNA) decay. We did not identify further mutations in genomic DNA that could explain TC deficiency in the two children. However, further efforts using complementary DNA (cDNA) derived from RNA from blood leukocytes identified a large deletion removing the entire exon 8, resulting in a frameshift and a premature stop codon (p.E371fsX372) in the mother and the two affected children. Our data indicate that if exon-by-exon DNA sequencing of genomic DNA does not uncover mutations corresponding to the phenotype, a systematic search for other mutations should be initiated by sequencing cDNA or using semiquantitative methods to detect large deletions in TCN2.
