Self-reactive T cells escape deletion in the thymus and are found in the peripheral repertoire. Because bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DC) are potent activators of antigen-specific T cells, these cells could theoretically activate self-reactive T cells leading to autoimmunity. We investigated whether BM-DC could induce the autoimmune disease experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our results show that transfer of BM-DC presenting a self-peptide from the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG35-55) into naive mice induced EAE 7-14 days later. MOG35-55-specific T cells of the Th1 phenotype were present in the lymph nodes and spleens of mice that received live peptide-pulsed BM-DC. Heat-killed or formaldehyde-fixed BM-DC presenting MOG35-55 could induce neither clinical signs of EAE nor a measurable T-cell response in vitro. These data show that live BM-DC presenting a self-antigen can induce the organ-specific autoimmune disorder EAE in a non-transgenic system. Therefore, this new EAE model could be used as a more clinically relevant model for the human disease multiple sclerosis. These findings could also have implications for the use of DC immunotherapy in a clinical setting.
