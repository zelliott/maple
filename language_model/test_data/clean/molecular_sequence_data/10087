We have isolated a fission yeast gene, mts4(+), by complementation of a temperature-sensitive mutation and show that it encodes subunit 2 (S2) of the 19 S regulatory complex of the 26 S protease. mts4(+) is an essential gene, and we show that loss of this subunit causes cells to arrest in metaphase, illustrating the importance of S2 for mitosis. The Mts4 protein is 48% identical to S2 of the human 26 S protease, and the lethal phenotype of the null mts4 allele can be rescued by the human cDNA encoding S2. We provide genetic and physical evidence to suggest that the Mts4 protein interacts with the product of the mts2(+) gene, an ATPase which has previously been shown to be subunit 4 of the 26 S protease.
