Lanthanide-binding peptide tags (LBTs) containing a single cysteine residue can be attached to proteins via a disulfide bond, presenting a flexible means of tagging proteins site-specifically with a lanthanide ion. Here we show that cysteine residues placed in different positions of the LBT can be used to expose the protein to different orientations of the magnetic susceptibility anisotropy (delta chi) tensor and to generate different molecular alignments in a magnetic field. Delta chi tensors determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for LBT complexes with Yb3+, Tm3+, and Er3+ suggest a rational way of producing alignment tensors with different orientations. In addition, knowledge of the delta chi tensor of LBT allows modeling of the protein-LBT structures. Despite evidence for residual mobility of the LBTs with respect to the protein, the pseudocontact shifts and residual dipolar couplings displayed by proteins disulfide-bonded to LBTs are greater than those achievable with most other lanthanide binding tags.
