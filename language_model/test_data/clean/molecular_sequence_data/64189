A new class of helicoid type sequential oligopeptide carriers (SOC), for anchoring antigenic epitopes, has been modeled from the repetitive Lys-Aib-Gly (SOC(n)-I) and Aib-Lys-Aib-Gly (SOC(n)-II) units aiming to the development of scaffolds with predetermined 3D structures. Conformational analysis showed that the SOC(n) carriers adopt 3(10)-helical structures, while the SOC(n)-conjugates retain their original active conformations and they interact neither to the carriers nor to each other. It is concluded that the helicoid structure of SOC(n) helps the reconstitution and/or mimicking of the native forms of the epitopes so that potent antigens are generated for developing specific, sensitive and reproducible immunoassays.
