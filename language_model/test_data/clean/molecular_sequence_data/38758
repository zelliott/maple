In bacteria, extracellular signals are generally transduced into cellular responses via a two-component system. However, genome sequence data have now revealed the presence of 'eukaryotic-like' protein kinases and phosphatases. Mycobacterium tuberculosis appears to be unique among bacteria in that its genome contains 11 members of a newly identified protein kinase family. These M. tuberculosis eukaryotic-like protein kinases could be key regulators of metabolic processes, including transcription, cell development and interactions with host cells.
