Spleen necrosis virus (SNV) proteins can package RNA from distantly related murine leukemia virus (MLV), whereas MLV proteins cannot package SNV RNA efficiently. We used this nonreciprocal recognition to investigate regions of packaging signals that influence viral RNA encapsidation specificity. Although the MLV and SNV packaging signals (Psi and E, respectively) do not contain significant sequence homology, they both contain a pair of hairpins. This hairpin pair was previously proposed to be the core element in MLV Psi. In the present study, MLV-based vectors were generated to contain chimeric SNV/MLV packaging signals in which the hairpins were replaced with the heterologous counterpart. The interactions between these chimeras and MLV or SNV proteins were examined by virus replication and RNA analyses. SNV proteins recognized all of the chimeras, indicating that these chimeras were functional. We found that replacing the hairpin pair did not drastically alter the ability of MLV proteins to package these chimeras. These results indicate that, despite the important role of the hairpin pair in RNA packaging, it is not the major motif responsible for the ability of MLV proteins to discriminate between the MLV and SNV packaging signals. To determine the role of sequences flanking the hairpins in RNA packaging specificity, vectors with swapped flanking regions were generated and evaluated. SNV proteins packaged all of these chimeras efficiently. In contrast, MLV proteins strongly favored chimeras with the MLV 5'-flanking regions. These data indicated that MLV Gag recognizes multiple elements in the viral packaging signal, including the hairpin structure and flanking regions.
