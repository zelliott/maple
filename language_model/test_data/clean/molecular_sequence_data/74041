We analyzed the third complementarity-determining region (CDR3) of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene in five patients with lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP) through a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analysis. By sequencing analysis of the PCR products, morphologic LIP could be divided into two groups: a polyclonal type and a minor monoclonal type. Because of their high frequencies, minor monoclonal clones seemed to be neoplastic clones hidden in normally reactive lymphocyte clones. Consequently, only the polyclonal type might have represented true LIP. Sequencing of the PCR products from open-chest biopsy and transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) specimens obtained 8 yr later in one patient with minor monoclonal type LIP confirmed this possibility. In true LIP, six of 20 lymphocyte clones showed 67 to 86% homology with lymphocyte clones derived from fetal tissue. In three of these six clones, the D-region (N-D-N) lengths were very short, whereas four clones showed a high homology with autoreactive lymphocytes (rheumatoid factor, anti-DNA antibody, and G6-positive lymphocytes). Since rheumatoid factors, anti-DNA antibodies, and G6 are autoreactive antibodies, immature B cells stimulated by autoantigens might play some role in the pathogenesis of true LIP.
