Myristoylation is a biochemical modification of proteins in which the lipid myristate becomes covalently bound to various cellular, viral, and oncoproteins catalyzed by a monomeric enzyme myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT). This modification is important for the biological activity of several proteins, especially the regulation of several oncoproteins involved in various types of cancers. Complementary DNA encoding human NMT-1 (hNMT-1) has been previously reported; however, the genomic organization of hNMT-1 has not been available. Attempts to amplify genomic fragments corresponding to hNMT-1 cDNA sequence yielded only one fragment. We have searched databases using both the cDNA and sequence of one of the intron sequence and this identified a human BAC clone sequence from chromosome 17. Alignment of hNMT-1 cDNA coding information on human chromosome 17 resulted in the complete structural identity of 23,960 bp of the hNMT-1 gene. The hNMT-1 gene is composed of 11 exons and 10 introns with consensus GT/AG boundaries. Finally, we show that 140 bp from the 5' end of recently reported full-length cDNA of hNMT-1 was not part of this genomic region raising the possibility for posttranscriptional modification in generating larger transcripts likely by trans splicing. Further, the availability of this genomic sequence will assist in unraveling the molecular basis for several observed NMT isoforms.
