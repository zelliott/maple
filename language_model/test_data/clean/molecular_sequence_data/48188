Gene rgpG is required for biosynthesis of rhamnose-glucose polysaccharide (RGP) in Streptococcus mutans. Its deduced amino acid sequence had similarity to WecA, which initiates syntheses of enterobacterial common antigen and some O antigens in Escherichia coli. Gene rgpG complemented a wecA mutation of E. coli, suggesting that rgpG may function similarly in RGP synthesis.
