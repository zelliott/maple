Three strains (LM008(T), LM068 and LM078(T)), representing two novel yeast species were isolated from the phylloplane of three plant species by an enrichment technique. On the basis of morphological, biochemical, physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, and the sequence analysis of the D1/D2 domain of the large subunit rRNA gene and the internal spacer region, the three strains were assigned as two novel Candida species. Strain LM008(T) was assigned to be Candida sirachaensis sp. nov. (type strain LM008(T) = BCC 47628(T) = NBRC 108605(T) CBS 12094(T)) in the Starmerella clade. Two strains (LM068 and LM078(T)) represent a single species in the Lodderomyces-Spathaspora clade for which the name Candida sakaeoensis sp. nov. is proposed with the type strain LM078(T) = BCC 47632(T) = NBRC 108895(T) = CBS 12318(T).
