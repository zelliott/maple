Iron (III) binding proteins are isolated from echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus multiaculeatus) and platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) milk and blood. On the basis of several criteria it is shown that the milk proteins are not lactoferrins, but are transferrins similar to the corresponding transferrins from the blood. The heterogeneity of the proteins, particularly the echidna milk transferrin, is, at least in part, due to different levels of sialic acid. Their N-terminal sequences (30 residues) are determined and compared with those of other transferrins and lactoferrins. The role of the proteins is discussed.
