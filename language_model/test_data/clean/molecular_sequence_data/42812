The genome of influenza virus has become amenable to genetic analysis as a result of newly developed methods for reconstitution of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. This allows a dissection of the regulatory signals and promoters required for transcription and replication of the viral genome. The ability to rescue chimeric viruses in vivo after transfection opens up a way to engineer viruses suitable for human immunization and carrying desirable antigenic determinants.
