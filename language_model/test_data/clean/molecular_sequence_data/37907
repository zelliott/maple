The complete nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone representing the M5 RNA segment of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus Japan serotype 2 (EHDV-2), Ibaraki virus, was determined. The M5 segment is 1641 base pairs long with the single open reading frame which predicts a polypeptide of 527 amino acids. The comparison of the amino acid sequence of the VP5 with those of EHDV-1, bluetongue virus serotype 10, and African horse sickness virus serotype 4 revealed that the protein shared 67%, 57% and 42% homologies, respectively. In addition, the VP5 protein was expressed in insect cells by recombinant baculovirus, which could be recognized by the mouse anti-EHDV-2 sera at a position of the expected 59 kDa on immunoblot analysis.
