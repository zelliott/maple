We previously demonstrated that immunization of mice with plasmid DNAs (pDNAs) expressing the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) genes IE1-pp89 and M84 provided synergistic protection against sublethal viral challenge, while immunization with plasmids expressing putative virion proteins provided no or inconsistent protection. In this report, we sought to augment protection by increasing the breadth of the immune response. We identified another MCMV gene (m04 encoding gp34) that provided strong and consistent protection against viral replication in the spleen. We also found that immunization with a DNA pool containing 10 MCMV genes that individually were nonprotective elicited reproducible protection against low to intermediate doses of challenge virus. Moreover, inclusion of these plasmids into a mixture with gp34, pp89, and M84 DNAs provided even greater protection than did coimmunization with pp89 and M84. The highest level of protection was achieved by immunization of mice with the pool of 13 pDNAs, followed by formalin-inactivated MCMV (FI-MCMV). Immunization with FI-MCMV elicited neutralizing antibodies against salivary gland-derived MCMV, and of greatest importance, mice immunized with both the combined pDNA pool and FI-MCMV had undetectable levels of virus in the spleen and salivary glands after challenge. Intracellular cytokine staining of splenocytes from pDNA- and FI-MCMV-immunized mice showed that pDNA immunization elicited high levels of pp89- and M83-specific CD8(+) T cells, whereas both pDNA and FI-MCMV immunizations generated strong CD8(+)-T-cell responses against virion-associated antigens. Taken together, these results show that immunization with pDNA and inactivated virus provides strong antibody and cell-mediated immunity against CMV infection.
