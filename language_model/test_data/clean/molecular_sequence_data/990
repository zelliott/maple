Recent reports show that numerous chloroplast-specific proteins of peridinin-containing dinoflagellates are encoded on minicircles-small plasmidlike molecules containing one or two polypeptide genes each. The genes for these polypeptides are chloroplast specific because their homologs from other photosynthetic eukaryotes are exclusively encoded in the chloroplast genome. Here, we report the isolation, sequencing, and subcellular localization of minicircles from the peridinin-containing dinoflagellate Ceratium horridum. The C. horridum minicircles are organized in the same manner as in other peridinin-containing dinoflagellates and encode the same kinds of plastid-specific proteins, as previous studies reported. However, intact plastids isolated from C. horridum do not contain minicircles, nor do they contain DNA that hybridizes to minicircle-specific probes. Rather, C. horridum minicircles are localized in the nucleus as shown by cell fractionation, Southern hybridization, and in situ hybridization with minicircle-specific probes. A high-molecular-weight DNA was detected in purified C. horridum plastids, but it is apparently not minicircular in organization, as hybridization with a cloned probe from the plastid-localized DNA suggests. The distinction between C. horridum and other peridinin-containing dinoflagellates at the level of their minicircle localization is paralleled by C. horridum thylakoid organization, which also differs from that of other peridinin-containing dinoflagellates, indicating that a hitherto underestimated diversity of minicircle DNA localization and thylakoid organization exists across various dinoflagellate groups.
