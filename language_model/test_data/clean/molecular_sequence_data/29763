The cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) of Eimeria tenella and Toxoplasma gondii is the target of a novel coccidiostat that is effective against coccidiosis and toxoplasmosis in animal models. Preparations of native PKG enzyme from Toxoplasma and Eimeria contain a membrane-associated polypeptide (isoform-I) of about 110 kDa and a slightly smaller soluble polypeptide (isoform-II). Expression of T. gondii and E. tenella PKG cDNA clones in Toxoplasma yield similarly sized recombinant polypeptides, which co-migrate on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with the corresponding native isoforms. Results of targeted mutagenesis of potential translational initiation sites suggest that parasite isoform-II is a product of alternative translational initiation from an internal initiator methionine codon. Exclusive expression of isoform-II or isoform-I can be achieved by preventing initiation at the respective primary or secondary sites. Immunofluorescence analysis indicates that recombinant isoform-I localizes primarily to the parasite plasma membrane, while isoform-II remains cytosolic. Mutagenesis and metabolic labeling studies reveal that the observed membrane-association of full-length recombinant PKG is mediated by N-terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation at amino acids G2 and C4. We also confirm the functional significance of a putative third PKG allosteric site, common to apicomplexan PKGs but absent from vertebrate or insect PKGs. In assays with transiently transfected parasites, constructs harboring a mutation at this site express markedly lower levels of cGMP-dependent PKG activity, while a triple mutant bearing mutations in all three sites reduces kinase activity to background levels.
