A Gram-negative, motile, non-spore-forming bacterial strain, designated MJ07(T), was isolated from a farm soil and was characterized to determine its taxonomic position by using a polyphasic approach. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain MJ07(T) belongs to the family Alcaligenaceae, class Betaproteobacteria, and is related most closely to Pusillimonas ginsengisoli KCTC 22046(T) (98.6 % sequence similarity) and Pusillimonas noertemannii BN9(T) (96.9 %). The levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strain MJ07(T) and members of all other recognized species of the family Alcaligenaceae were below 95.2 %. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain MJ07(T) was 59.4 mol%. The detection of a quinone system with ubiquinone Q-8 as the major respiratory lipoquinone, putrescine as the predominant polyamine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and two unknown aminolipids as major polar lipids and a fatty acid profile with C₁₆:₀ (32.0 %), C₁₇:₀cyclo (24.7 %) and C₁₉:₀cyclo ω8c (11.5 %) as the major components supported the affiliation of strain MJ07(T) to the genus Pusillimonas. Strain MJ07(T) exhibited relatively low levels of DNA-DNA relatedness with respect to P. ginsengisoli KCTC 22046(T) (50 ± 8 %) and P. noertemannii KACC 13183(T) (18 ± 7 %). On the basis of its phenotypic and genotypic properties together with its phylogenetic distinctiveness, strain MJ07(T) (=KCTC 22455(T) =JCM 16386(T)) should be classified in the genus Pusillimonas as the type strain of a novel species, for which the name Pusillimonas soli sp. nov. is proposed.
