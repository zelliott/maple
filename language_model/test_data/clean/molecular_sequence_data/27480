The O-specific polysaccharide (O-antigen) structure of a Shigella flexneri type 4a strain from the Dysentery Reference Laboratory (London, UK) was elucidated in 1978 and its characteristic feature was found to be alpha-D-glucosylation of GlcNAc at position 6, which defines O-factor IV. Our NMR spectroscopic studies of the O-specific polysaccharides of two other strains belonging to S. flexneri type 4a (G1668 from Adelaide, Australia, and 1359 from Moscow, Russia) confirmed the carbohydrate backbone structure but revealed in both strains an additional component, ethanolamine phosphate (EtnP), attached at position 3 of one of the rhamnose residues: [structure: see text]. Phosphorylation has not been hitherto reported in any S. flexneri O-antigen. Reinvestigation of the O-specific polysaccharide of S. flexneri type 4b showed that it is not phosphorylated and confirmed its structure established earlier.
