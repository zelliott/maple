The dodecasatellite is a 11/12 bp tandemly repeated sequence which is overrepresented, with regard to its genomic representation, in extrachromosomal circular DNAs from D melanogaster embryos. Here we show that a bacterial plasmid carrying a cluster of dodecasatellite is not able to replicate efficiently in cultured cells. This observation does not support the hypothesis that the overrepresentation results from an autonomous replication of dodecasatellite circular DNA molecules.
