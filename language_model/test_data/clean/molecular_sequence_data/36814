Oligoribonucleotides consisted of modified nucleotides at 3'-turmini were chemically synthesized on the solid phase method. Moreover, these analogues were investigated the stability in a prokaryotic cell-free translation system and the resistance against a few kind of nucleases containing 3'-exonuclease activity.
