N-Acetylglucosamine is produced by the endogenous degradation of glycoconjugates and by the degradation of dietary glycoconjugates by glycosidases. It enters the pathways of aminosugar metabolism by the action of N-acetylglucosamine kinase. In this study we report the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone encoding the murine enzyme. An open reading frame of 1029 base pairs encodes 343 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 37.3 kDa. The deduced amino-acid sequence contains matches of the sequences of eight peptides derived from tryptic cleavage of rat N-acetylglucosamine kinase. The recombinant murine enzyme was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells, where it displays N-acetylglucosamine kinase activity as well as N-acetylmannosamine kinase activity. The complete cDNA sequence of human N-acetylglucosamine kinase was derived from the nucleotide sequences of several expressed sequence tags. An open reading frame of 1032 base pairs encodes 344 amino acids and a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 37.4 kDa. Similarities between human and murine N-acetylglucosamine kinase were 86.6% on the nucleotide level and 91.6% on the amino-acid level. Amino-acid sequences of murine and human N-acetylglucosamine kinase show sequence similarities to other sugar kinases, and all five sequence motifs necessary for the binding of ATP by sugar kinases are present. Tissue distribution of murine N-acetylglucosamine kinase revealed an ubiquitous occurrence of the enzyme and a very high expression in testis. The size of the murine mRNA was 1.35 kb in all tissues investigated, with the exception of testis, where it was 1.45 kb mRNA of the murine enzyme was continuously expressed during mouse development. mRNA of the human enzyme was expressed in all investigated human tissues, as well as in cancer cell lines. In both the tissues and the cancer cell lines, the human mRNA was 1.35 kb in size.
