We have previously characterized a large panel of provirus insertion Notch1 mutant alleles and their products arising in thymomas of MMTV(D)/myc transgenic mice. Here, we show that these Notch1 mutations represent two clearly distinct classes. In the first class (type I), proviral integrations were clustered just upstream of sequences encoding the transmembrane domain. Type I Notch1 alleles produced two types of mutant Notch1 RNA, one of which encoded the entire Notch1 cytoplasmic domain [N(IC)] and the other of which encoded a soluble ectodomain [N(EC)(Mut)] which, in contrast to the processed wild-type ectodomain [N(EC)(WT)], did not reside at the cell surface and became secreted in a temperature-dependent manner. A second, novel class of mutant Notch1 allele (type II) encoded a Notch1 receptor with the C-terminal PEST motif deleted (DeltaCT). The type II Notch1(DeltaCT) protein was expressed as a normally processed receptor [N(EC)(WT) and N(IC)(DeltaCT)] at the cell surface, and its ectodomain was found to be shed into the extracellular medium in a temperature- and calcium-dependent manner. These data suggest that both type I and type II mutations generate two structurally distinct Notch1 N(EC) and N(IC) proteins that may participate in tumor formation, in collaboration with the c-myc oncogene, through distinct mechanisms. Constitutive type I N(IC) and type II N(IC)(DeltaCT) expression may enhance Notch1 intracellular signaling, while secreted or shed type I N(EC)(Mut) and type II N(EC) proteins may differentially interact in an autocrine or paracrine fashion with ligands of Notch1 and affect their signaling.
