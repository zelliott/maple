One copy of the psbA gene which codes for the photosystem II reaction center D-1 protein from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus has been sequenced. It is feasible that a disulfide bridge between D-1 Cys212 and D-2 Cys212 is responsible for the thermostability of the photosystem II reaction center from Synechococcus elongatus.
