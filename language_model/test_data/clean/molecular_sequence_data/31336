Methionine is the universal amino acid for initiation of protein synthesis in all known organisms. The amino acid is coupled to a specific initiator methionine tRNA by methionyl-tRNA synthetase. In Escherichia coli, attachment of methionine to the initiator tRNA (tRNA(fMet)) has been shown to be dependent on synthetase recognition of the methionine anticodon CAU (complementary to the initiation codon AUG), [Schulman, L. H., & Pelka, H. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 6755-6759]. We show here that alteration of the anticodon of tRNA(fMet) to GAC or GAA leads to aminoacylation of the initiator tRNA with valine or phenylalanine. In addition, tRNA(fMet) carrying these amino acids initiates in vivo protein synthesis when provided with initiation codons complementary to the modified anticodons. These results indicate that the sequence of the anticodon of tRNA(fMet) dictates the identity of the amino acid attached to the initiator tRNA in vivo and that there are no subsequent steps which prevent initiation of E. coli protein synthesis by valine and phenylalanine. The methods described here also provide a convenient in vivo assay for further examination of the role of the anticodon in tRNA amino acid acceptor identity.
