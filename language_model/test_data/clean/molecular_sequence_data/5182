Sequences of two internally transcribed spacer regions between 18S and 28S rRNA genes were determined to assess the phylogenetic relationship in the strains belonging to the genus Saccharomyces. The sequences of S. bayanus and S. pastorianus were quite similar, but not identical. Two phylogenetic trees constructed by the neighbor-joining method showed that all the species examined were distinguished from one another. The Saccharomyces sensu stricto species: S. cerevisiae, S. bayanus, S. paradoxus and S. pastorianus, were closely related and far from the Saccharomyces sensu lato species including S. barnetti, S. castellii, S. dairensis, S. exiguus, S. servazzii, S. spencerorum and S. unisporus, and an outlying species, S. kluyveri.
