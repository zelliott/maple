The aim of this study is to investigate the role of adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus in the cause of chronic otitis media with effusion by use of the polymerase chain reaction for detection. The polymerase chain reaction has proved to be more sensitive and specific than viral cultures and immunoassays in the detection of viruses in other specimens. Adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus were chosen because these viruses have been the most commonly isolated viruses in middle ear effusions in studies using other techniques. The effusions (132 total) were sterilely collected from 88 children undergoing myringotomy and ventilation tube placement for chronic otitis media with effusion. Nine (6.8%) specimens were positive for adenovirus by the polymerase chain reaction, and 13 (9.9%) were positive for respiratory syncytial virus by the polymerase chain reaction. Only one specimen was positive for adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus by viral culture and immunofluorescence, respectively. Our results show that the polymerase chain reaction can be used to detect adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus in chronic middle ear effusions and that PCR is more sensitive than viral culture and immunofluorescence techniques.
