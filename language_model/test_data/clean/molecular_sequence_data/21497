We have performed a genomic characterization of a kinetoplastid protist living within the amoebozoan Neoparamoeba pemaquidensis. The genome of this "Ichthyobodo-related organism" was found to be unexpectedly large, with at least 11 chromosomes between 1.0 and 3.5 Mbp and a total genome size of at least 25 Mbp.
