To investigate whether or not alternatively spliced variants of the FSH receptor gene occur in human testis and whether the presence of the splicing variants is associated with spermatogenic defects and serum FSH concentration in infertile men.

A prospective case control study.

An IVF clinic and infertility laboratory at a university hospital.

Forty-three infertile patients undergoing testicular biopsy.

Total RNA was extracted from the testicular tissues and used for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Expression pattern was analyzed by nested RT-PCR using primers designed to amplify a fragment of FSH receptor gene. PCR products of splicing variants were cloned and sequenced.

The PCR products showed three kinds of additional bands corresponding to alternatively spliced isoforms of the FSH receptor gene. Exon 9 deleted variant was detected in all patients and inclusion variant of small extra exon was detected in 64% (9/14) of the patients with normal spermatogenesis and 34% (10/29) of the patients with spermatogenic defects. The presence of inclusion variant was not significantly associated with spermatogenic defects but was associated with a low level of serum FSH. On the other hand, exon 6 deleted variant was detected in only one patient having a high level of FSH concentration (30 IU/L) and Sertoli cell only syndrome.

We identified three different types of alternatively spliced variants of the human FSH receptor. However, it is not clear whether or not there is an association between three variants and spermatogenic defects.
