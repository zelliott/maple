Aichi virus has been associated with acute gastroenteritis in adults and children. Stool samples were collected from 788 Tunisian children suffering from diarrhea. Aichi virus was found in 4.1% of the cases. The high proportion of monoinfections and the high frequency of hospitalizations support the role of Aichi virus in pediatric gastroenteritis.
