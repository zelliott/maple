We are investigating the mechanisms for deletion formation through the use of mutants which alter deletion frequency together with well characterized systems for deletion detection. We report here on three mutations which were isolated for their ability to stimulate deletions in plasmid pMC874 (dli mutations). The mutation rec-2251 (formerly known as dli1) is a new allele of recBCD, a group of genes coding for the polypeptide components of the major recombination enzyme complex in E. coli; the second one, dli2 may be a new allele of uvrD, which codes for DNA helicase II; and the third one, dli3, has the phenotype of a mismatch repair mutation. Here we compare the effects of mutations in SOS-repair genes to those of the dli mutations on three different deletion events: (a) the deletion of short (60-100-bp) palindromic and non-palindromic inserts in derivatives of plasmid pBR325; (b) larger (600-800-bp) deletions in plasmid pMC874; and (c) the excision of the Tn10 transposon from chromosomal sites. Our results indicate that some form of SOS processing stimulates the loss of palindromes but not non-palindromes in plasmid pBR325 derivatives, and that RecA is necessary for UV-induced excision of Tn10 but this event is inhibited by UmuCD or its homolog MucAB. Each of the dli mutations showed unique effects on different classes of deletions. Mutation rec-2251 stimulated specifically deletions in pMC874 but had no effect on the deletion of non-palindromes in pBR325, and reduced the incidence of the other deletion events tested including loss of palindromic inserts in pBR325 as well as Tn10 excision. Mutation dli2, on the other hand, stimulated all deletions tested to varying extents, while dli3 did not affect markedly deletion formation in pBR325 plasmids but had a large stimulatory effect on both deletions in plasmid pMC874 and Tn10 excision. These results reveal that (a) some SOS-repair functions participate in deletion formation, (b) mutations selected for altering the incidence of one class of deletions may have totally different effects on other deletion events, and (c) the differences in mutant behavior may result in part from the ability of some pathways to discriminate among different deletion intermediates such as hairpins or cruciforms formed by palindromic sequences vs. transient secondary structures stabilized by direct repeats flanking non-palindromic sequences.
