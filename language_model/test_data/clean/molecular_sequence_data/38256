Restless is an endogenous hAT transposon found in the cyclosporin-producing fungus Tolypocladium inflatum. This element is present in about 15 copies in a particular strain (ATCC34921) which was used for successful gene tagging. We have isolated a T. inflatum mutant with a defect in nitrogen metabolism. This mutant carries a copy of the Restless element in a gene encoding a C6 zinc-finger protein. The deduced amino acid sequence of the gene product shows a significant similarity to the NIT4 protein of Neurospora crassa, which is a regulator of nitrogen metabolism. The wild-type T. inflatum gene was shown to complement a nit-4 mutant of N. crassa. From these data, we conclude that the T. inflatum gene also encodes a regulator of nitrogen metabolism, which was named tnir1 (Tolypocladium nitrogen regulator 1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fungal gene to be identified by transposon-directed gene tagging. A general method for gene tagging using an endogenous fungal transposon is presented.
