Protein kinase D (PKD) regulates cardiac myocyte growth and contractility through phosphorylation of proteins such as class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) and troponin I (TnI). In response to agonists that activate G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), PKD is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) on two serine residues (Ser-738 and Ser-742 in human PKD1) within an activation loop of the catalytic domain, resulting in stimulation of PKD activity. Here, we identify a novel PKC target site located adjacent to the auto-inhibitory pleckstrin homology (PH) domain in PKD. This site (Ser-412 in human PKD1) is conserved in each of the three PKD family members and is efficiently phosphorylated by multiple PKC isozymes in vitro. Employing a novel anti-phospho-Ser-412-specific antibody, we demonstrate that this site in PKD is rapidly phosphorylated in primary cardiac myocytes exposed to hypertrophic agonists, including norepinephrine (NE) and endothelin-1 (ET-1). Differential sensitivity of this event to pharmacological inhibitors of PKC, and data from in vitro enzymatic assays, suggest a predominant role for PKCÎ´ in the control of PKD Ser-412 phosphorylation. Together, these data suggest a novel, signal-dependent mechanism for controlling PKD function in cardiac myocytes.
