To investigate the glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GLUD1) gene mutation of three patients diagnosed as glutamate dehydrogenase congenital hyperinsulinism (GDH-HI).

Three patients diagnosed as GDH-HI and their parents were involved in the study. PCR-DNA direct sequencing was used to analyze the exons 6,7,10,11 and 12 of the GLUD1 gene.

In the first case, an R269H heterozygous mutation was found in the GLUD1 gene, with autosomal dominant inheritance. In the second case, there was a de novo S445L heterozygous mutation of the GLUD1 gene. No mutation was detected in the third case.

In Chinese, R269H, S445L heterozygous mutation of the GLUD1 gene can lead to GDH-HI. Genetic analysis is necessary in making genetic diagnosis of congenital hyperinsulinsm.
