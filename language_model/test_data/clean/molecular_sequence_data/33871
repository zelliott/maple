While searching for genes expressed in acid lemon but not in acidless lime pulp, we isolated clone Cl111 which showed the following expression phenotypes: (1) while it was expressed in the ovaries in both varieties, its mRNA was detected only in the pulp of the acid fruit, (2) no or very low expression of the gene was detected in vegetative organs. These expression patterns suggested that Cl111 is an ovary- and pulp-specific gene. The ability of ~2-kb fragments upstream of the transcription start site of the lemon and lime genes to confer reporter-gene activity was investigated by transient expression in isolated juice vesicles of both varieties. Whereas Cl111 promoter from lemon showed faint activity in lemon and lime juice vesicles, no activity was evident with the lime promoter. The activities of the 2-kb fragments and their delimited fragments were further investigated in tomato. The results indicated that the promoters were active in a manner similar to that in acid lemon and acidless lime: the lemon promoter generated activity in the fruit endocarp, analogous to citrus fruit pulp. The delimitation analyses identified an expression-conferring region which, in the lemon promoter, contained a sequence homologous to a fruit-specific element of the melon cucumisin gene. Another region, which reduced promoter activity, contained an I-Box-like sequence, identified as a fruit-specific negative element. Taken together, Cl111 promoter was confirmed to be pulp- and flower-specific. Differences in the expression of Cl111 between the two varieties could be attributable to changes in the gene promoter region.
