(6R)-2,2,6-Trimethyl-1,4-cyclohexanedione (levodione) reductase was isolated from a cell extract of the soil isolate Corynebacterium aquaticum M-13. This enzyme catalyzed regio- and stereoselective reduction of levodione to (4R,6R)-4-hydroxy-2,2, 6-trimethylcyclohexanone (actinol). The relative molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated to be 142,000 Da by high-performance gel permeation chromatography and 36,000 Da by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme required NAD(+) or NADH as a cofactor, and it catalyzed reversible oxidoreduction between actinol and levodione. The enzyme was highly activated by monovalent cations, such as K(+), Na(+), and NH(4)(+). The NH(2)-terminal and partial amino acid sequences of the enzyme showed that it belongs to the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase family. This is the first report of levodione reductase.
