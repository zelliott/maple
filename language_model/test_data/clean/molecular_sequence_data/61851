To develop a diagnostic tool to identify Mycoplasma pulmonis (M. pulmonis) in clinical isolates, we developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using primers specific for the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region (SR) of M. pulmonis. One pair of PCR primers reacted specifically with two reference strains of M. pulmonis tested and seven samples isolated from naturally infected rats. The primer pair did not produce PCR products of the correct size from any other rodent or human mycoplasmas or cellular DNA from rodent lungs. Specificity of the PCR assay was confirmed by Southern blotting with probe specific for the SR of M. pulmonis. The PCR assay for detection of M. pulmonis established in this study is suitable for diagnosis of M. pulmonis infection in clinical cases.
