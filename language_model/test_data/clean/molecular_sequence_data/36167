We have screened exon 11 of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene from familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) heterozygotes for point mutations by using analysis of single strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCP). A variant pattern was observed in three out of 39 subjects. By DNA sequencing, this variant pattern was found to be due to a C-->T transition at nucleotide 1617 that affects the third base of codon 518. A PCR method was developed to screen FH heterozygotes and normal subjects for this mutation. The gene frequencies in FH heterozygotes and normal subjects were 4% and 4.5%, respectively. Thus, the mutation cannot be in linkage disequilibrium with a mutation that causes FH. Rather, the mutation may be a useful genetic marker at the LDLR locus. Haplotype analysis at the LDLR locus in two FH families where the proband possessed the mutation revealed that the mutation was on two different haplotypes. This finding is consistent with the mutation occurring at a mutational hot spot.
