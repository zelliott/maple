Uracil-DNA glycosylase (Ung) can quickly locate uracil bases in an excess of undamaged DNA. DNA glycosylases may use diffusion along DNA to facilitate lesion search, resulting in processivity, the ability of glycosylases to excise closely spaced lesions without dissociating from DNA. We propose a new assay for correlated cleavage and analyze the processivity of Ung. Ung conducted correlated cleavage on double- and single-stranded substrates; the correlation declined with increasing salt concentration. Proteins in cell extracts also decreased Ung processivity. The correlated cleavage was reduced by nicks in DNA, suggesting the intact phosphodiester backbone is important for Ung processivity.
