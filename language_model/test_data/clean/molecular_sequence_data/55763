We have designed, synthesized, and expressed in Halobacterium halobium a gene encoding sensory rhodopsin I (SR-I). The gene has been optimized for cassette mutagenesis by incorporating 30 unique restriction sites with uniform spacing throughout the 720-bp coding region. For expression, the coding region was placed downstream of the promoter and translation initiation region of the bacterioopsin gene on a selectable vector. This construct encodes SR-I with an extended N terminus that includes the 13-amino acid leader sequence and the 8-amino acid N terminus of bacterioopsin. To obtain a SR-I- H. halobium strain for expressing the synthetic gene, we used homologous recombination to delete the chromosomal gene encoding SR-I, sopI. The deletion strain was transformed with the synthetic sopI expression vector. Using antibody directed against the C-terminal region of SR-I, we detected in transformant membranes a protein with the electrophoretic mobility expected for SR-I with a processed N-terminal extension. The synthetic gene product was functionally identical to SR-I. Its flash-induced absorption difference spectrum and photochemical reaction cycle in membrane envelope vesicles were characteristic of SR-I. The protein fully restored phototaxis responses in the deletion strain.
