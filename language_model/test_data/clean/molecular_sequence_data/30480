In saturation mutagenesis of a protein, pools of DNA molecules are made containing a mixture of codons at a specific position. In cases where genetic methods allow screens or selections for altered function, a background of nonsense mutations can complicate genetic analysis of the resulting mutations. Methods are proposed for elimination of those molecules containing stop codons at the target codon from the pool, and for identifying positions to which these methods may be applied. Application of these methods should ensure that all changes are missense mutations, thereby simplifying genetic analysis.
