Kinetoplastid membrane protein-11 (KMP-11) is a major component of the cell surface of kinetoplastids, and acts as a potent B- and T-cell immunogen during Leishmania infection. Here we report that the Leishmania infantum KMP-11 secondary structure adopts mainly an alpha-helical conformation at pH 7.5 and that its urea- and thermally-induced unfolding constitute a fully reversible two-step process. This allows estimation of a half-denaturation temperature of approximately 65 degrees C, a delta GDH2O at 20 degrees C of approximately 14.63 kJ.mol-1, and an increment of the reaction heat of approximately 183.92 kJ.mol-1 and an entropy of approximately 543.4 J.mol-1.deg-1, respectively, for the native-denatured equilibrium of the KMP-11 in solution. We also report that the KPM-11 protein is induced to adopt a molten globule state at a pH range between pH 4 and pH 6. As a whole, the stability and the specific features of the denaturing effect induced by changes in pH are similar in KMP-11 to various other lipoproteins.
