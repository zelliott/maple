In the present study, we investigated the metal-binding reactivity of the isolated alpha domain of human metallothionein isoform 1a, with specific emphasis on resolving the debate concerning the cooperative nature of the metal-binding mechanism. The metallation reaction of the metal-free alpha domain with Cd2+ was unequivocally shown to proceed by a noncooperative mechanism at physiologic pH by CD and UV absorption spectroscopy and ESI MS. The data clearly show the presence of intermediate partially metallated metallothionein species under limiting Cd2+ conditions. Titration with four molar equivalents of Cd2+ was required for the formation of the Cd4alpha species in 100% abundance. The implications of a noncooperative metal-binding mechanism are that the partially metallated and metal-free species are stable intermediates, and thus may have a potential role in the currently undefined function of metallothionein.
