To contribute to the development of the transcription map of human chromosome 21 (HC21), we have used exon trapping from pools of HC21-specific cosmids. Using selected trapped exons, we have identified a novel gene (named TMPRSS2) that encodes a multimeric protein with a serine protease domain. The TMPRSS2 3.8-kb mRNA is expressed strongly in small intestine and weakly in several other tissues. The full-length cDNA encodes a predicted protein of 492 amino acids that contains the following domains: (i) A serine protease domain (aa 255-492) of the S1 family that probably cleaves at Arg or Lys residues. (ii) An SRCR (scavenger receptor cysteine-rich) domain (aa 149-242) of group A (6 conserved Cys). This type of domain is involved in the binding to other cell surface or extracellular molecules. (iii) An LDLRA (LDL receptor class A) domain (aa 113-148). This type of domain forms a binding site for calcium. (iv) A predicted transmembrane domain (aa 84-106). No typical signal peptide was recognized. The gene was mapped to 21q22.3 between markers ERG and D21S56 in the same P1 as MX1. The physiological role of TMPRSS2 and its involvement in trisomy 21 phenotypes or monogenic disorders that map to HC21 are unknown.
