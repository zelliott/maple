A plant lectin was isolated from barley (Hordeum vulgare) coleoptiles using acidic extraction and different chromatographic methods. Sequencing of more than 50% of the protein sequence by Edman degradation confirmed a full-length cDNA clone. The subsequently identified open reading frame encodes for a 15 kDa protein which could be found in the soluble fraction of barley coleoptiles. This protein exhibited specificity towards mannose sugar and is therefore, accordingly named as Horcolin (Hordeum vulgare coleoptile lectin). Database searches performed with the Horcolin protein sequence revealed a sequence and structure homology to the lectin family of jacalin-related lectins. Together with its affinity towards mannose, Horcolin is now identified as a new member of the mannose specific subgroup of jacalin-related lectins in monocot species. Horcolin shares a high amino acid homology to the highly light-inducible protein HL#2 and, in addition to two methyl jasmonic acid-inducible proteins of 32.6 and 32.7 kDa where the jasmonic acid-inducible proteins are examples of bitopic chimerolectins containing a dirigent and jacalin-related domain. Immunoblot analysis with a cross-reactive anti-HL#2 antibody in combination with Northern blot analysis of the Horcolin cDNA revealed tissue specific expression of Horcolin in the coleoptiles. The function of Horcolin is discussed in the context of its particular expression in coleoptiles and is then compared to other lectins, which apparently share a related response to biotic or abiotic stress factors.
