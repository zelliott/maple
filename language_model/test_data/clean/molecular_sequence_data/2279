A cDNA encoding the growth hormone (GH) receptor was cloned from rat liver. Both the nucleotide and translated amino acid sequence share greater than 70% similarity with the GH receptors from rabbit and human. An RNA probe was generated from this sequence for use in a solution hybridization assay to quantitate GH receptor mRNA expression in rat tissues. Expression was detected in 9/12 tissues examined, with the highest levels observed in the liver. Expression in liver, kidney, heart and muscle was developmentally regulated, being low at birth and rising to adult levels in 5 weeks. No difference was observed between hepatic expression in males and females, although livers from pregnant rats had elevated levels. Hypophysectomy and GH treatment did not affect hepatic GH receptor mRNA levels.
