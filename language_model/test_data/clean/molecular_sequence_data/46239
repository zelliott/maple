Growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR) plays a critical role in growth hormone (GH) synthesis, release and regulation of pituitary somatotroph expansion in vertebrates. The objective of this study was to investigate variations in goat GHRHR gene and their associations with growth traits in 668 dairy goats. The results showed four novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): NC_007302:g.5203C>T, 7307C>G, 9583G>A and 9668A>C. In detail, the novel SNP C>T in the 5203rd nucleotide identified a missense mutation: CCC (Pro)>TCC (Phe) at position 116aa of the goat GHRHR (423aa). Besides, 9583G>A and 9668A>C polymorphism were in complete linkage disequilibrium. The genetic diversity analysis revealed that the Guanzhong dairy goat possessed intermediate genetic diversity in P3 and P7 loci, and the Xinong Sannen dairy goat belonged to poor genetic diversity in P4 locus. Significant associations between the genotypes of P3 locus and body length, body height and chest circumference was observed in Guanzhong goat (P<0.05). However, in Xinong saanen population, significant statistical difference was only found in body height and body length (P<0.05). In P4 and P7 loci, no significant associations were detected between any variant sites and body length, body height and chest circumference, as well as for the milk traits (P>0.05). These results strongly suggested that the goat GHRHR gene is a candidate gene that influences growth traits in dairy goat.
