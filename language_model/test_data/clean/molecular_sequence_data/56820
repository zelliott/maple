We have designed a vector which allows the synthesis in Escherichia coli of bifunctional F(ab)2-alkaline phosphatase conjugates. The vector contains a di-cistronic operon encoding truncated heavy chain (Fd or VH-CH1) of an IgG inserted between residues +6 and +7 of bacterial alkaline phosphatase (PhoA), and the light chain of the same IgG. We demonstrate the utility of this approach with the heavy and light chain domains of a snake toxin-specific monoclonal antibody, M alpha 2-3. We show that the VH-CH1-PhoA hybrid and VL-CL are concomitantly expressed and exported to the periplasm of E. coli where they form a disulfide-linked chimeric protein. The hybrid has the same affinity as M alpha 2-3 for the snake toxin antigen and possesses PhoA enzymatic activity.
