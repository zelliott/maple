The membrane-bound hydrogenase (Hdg)-encoding structural genes were isolated from the hydrogen-utilizing bacterium Pseudomonas hydrogenovora (Ph). Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed two genes, hupS and hupL. The hupS gene encoded a 363-amino-acid (aa) polypeptide (40.4 kDa). The deduced aa sequence contained a putative 43-aa leader peptide sequence. The hupL gene started at 55 bp downstream from the stop codon of hupS and encoded a 622-aa polypeptide (69.3 kDa). The disruption of Ph hupS resulted in the loss of Hdg activity.
