Four Gram-negative-staining, facultatively anaerobic bacterial isolates were obtained from a fruiting body of the edible mushroom Pleurotus eryngii showing symptoms of soft rot disease in Beijing, China. Partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing, together with partial rpoB sequencing, placed these isolates in the genus Pantoea. Multilocus sequence analysis based on the partial sequences of gyrB, rpoB, infB and atpD revealed Pantoea dispersa and Pantoea gaviniae as their closest phylogenetic relatives and indicated that these isolates constituted a possible novel species. DNA-DNA hybridization studies confirmed the classification of the new isolates as a novel species and phenotypic tests allowed for differentiation from the closest phylogenetic neighbours. The name Pantoea beijingensis sp. nov. [type strain LMG 27579(T) = KCTC 32406(T) = JZB2120001(T) (deposited at Institute of Plant and Environment Protection, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences)] is proposed.
