In order to prevent enzymatic degradation of beta-casomorphin-5 (1) and morphiceptin, reduced peptide bonds were incorporated at the 2-3 and 3-4 bonds, respectively. The analogues were synthesized by a combination of solid phase methodology and reductive alkylation of resin-bound peptide amines with Boc-amino acid aldehydes (Boc: tert-butyloxycarbonyl) in the presence of NaBH3CN. During reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography purification, peak shape distortions could be observed. Epimerization was excluded, based on gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy analysis, which indicated acceptable levels of racemization (less than 3%) in the crude product. Instead, the phenomena could be attributed to slow cis/trans isomerizations originating from the Xxx-Pro bonds in the sequence. The presence of different conformational isomers was also established by 1H-nmr spectroscopy in DMSO-d6. All analogues showed high stability in blood plasma, enhanced binding affinity for the mu receptor, and very low binding to the delta receptor. While the Phe 3 psi(CH2-N)Pro4 analogues (3) and (5) displayed agonist activity, the Pro 2 psi(CH2-NH)Phe3 modified analogue (2) showed antagonist activity comparable to D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2.
