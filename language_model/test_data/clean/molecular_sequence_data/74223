A novel QnrB-like plasmid-mediated resistance determinant, QnrB19, was identified from an Escherichia coli clinical isolate from Colombia. Its gene was associated with an ISEcp1-like insertion element that did not act as a promoter for its expression. Using an in vitro model of transposition, we showed that the ISEcp1-like element was able to mobilize the qnrB19 gene.
