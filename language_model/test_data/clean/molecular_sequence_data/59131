Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) has become a major problem in recent years. Conventional vaccines make use of attenuated or inactivated viral strains, but these are gradually losing their effectiveness. We investigated the possibility of using purified VP2, a subunit of IBDV structural protein expressed in insect cells, as a vaccine. The VP2 gene was cloned into pAcYM1. The cloned gene was expressed in a baculovirus system, giving rise to a high quantity of recombinant VP2 (rVP2) protein. The length of the VP2 is 453 amino acids, and it contains two additional amino acids of the baculovirus at the carboxyl terminus. The molecular mass of the protein is about 48 kD. The rVP2 protein reacted with antibodies raised against viral VP2 and had a similar molecular weight. This protein was tested in a controlled vaccination experiment and compared with an inactivated commercial vaccine. High levels of antibodies were raised by the vaccinated birds. The vaccinated birds were challenged with a pathogenic viral strain. rVP2-vaccinated chickens exhibited high resistance to the virus. No mortality or weight changes in the bursa of Fabricius were observed in the vaccinated birds, whereas in the negative control birds, vaccinated with phosphate buffer, up to 50% mortality was found. Higher levels of antibodies were found by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in birds vaccinated with rVP2 compared with those vaccinated with the commercial vaccine. This study suggests the potential use of the isolated rVP2 as a subunit vaccine.
