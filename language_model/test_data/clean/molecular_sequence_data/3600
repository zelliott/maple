Presenilin (PS) genes linked to early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease encode polytopic membrane proteins that are presumed to constitute the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase, forming a high molecular weight complex with other proteins. During our attempts to identify binding partners of PS2, we cloned CALP (calsenilin-like protein)/KChIP4, a novel member of calsenilin/KChIP protein family that interacts with the C-terminal region of PS. Upon co-expression in cultured cells, CALP was directly bound to and co-localized with PS2 in endoplasmic reticulum. Overexpression of CALP did not affect the metabolism or stability of PS complex, and gamma-cleavage of betaAPP or Notch site 3 cleavage was not altered. However, co-expression of CALP and a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv4.2 reconstituted the features of A-type K(+) currents and CALP directly bound Kv4.2, indicating that CALP functions as KChIPs that are known as components of native Kv4 channel complex. Taken together, CALP/KChIP4 is a novel EF-hand protein interacting with PS as well as with Kv4 that may modulate functions of a subset of membrane proteins in brain.
