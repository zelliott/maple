In this work, we present the construction of a metagenomic library in Escherichia coli using pUC19 vector and environmental DNA directly isolated from Antarctic topsoil and screened for lipolytic enzymes. Screening on agar supplemented with olive oil and rhodamine B revealed one clone with lipolytic activity (Lip1) out of 1000 E. coli clones. This clone harbored a plasmid, pLip1, which has an insert of 4722 bp that was completely sequenced from both directions. Further analysis of the insert showed three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF2 encoded a protein (Lip1 ) of 469 amino acids with 93% identity to the uncultured Pseudomonas sp. lipase LipJ03. Amino acid sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis indicated that Lip1 lipase was closely related to family I subfamily 3. Furthermore, we present a three-dimensional model of lipase Lip1 which was generated based on the two known structures of mesophilic lipases from Pseudomonas sp. MIS 38 (PML lipase, PDB; 2Z8X) and Serratia marcescens (SML lipase, PDB: 2QUB). Finally, we report the results of comparisons between lipase Lip1 and mesophilic lipases and point out similarities and differences in the catalytic site and in other parts of the analyzed structures.
