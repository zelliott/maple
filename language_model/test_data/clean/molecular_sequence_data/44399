Four X-linked loci showing homology with a previously described Y-linked polymorphic locus (DYS413) were identified and characterized. By fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), somatic cell hybrids, and YAC screening, the X-linked members of this small family of sequences (CAIII) all map in Xp22, while the Y members map in Yq11. These loci contribute to the overall similarity of the two genomic regions. All of the CAIII loci contain an internal microsatellite of the (CA)n type. The microsatellites display extensive length polymorphism in two of the X-linked members as well as in the Y members. In addition, common sequence variants are found in the portions flanking the microsatellites in two of the X-linked members. Our results indicate that, during the evolution of this family, length variation on the Y chromosome was accumulated at a rate not slower than that on the X chromosome. Finally, these sequences represent a model system with which to analyze human populations for similar X- and Y-linked polymorphisms.
