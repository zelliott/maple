The complete amino acid sequences of [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins from four species of genus Solanum (S. nigrum, S. lyratum, S. indicum, and S. abutiloides) were determined by automated Edman degradation of the entire S-carboxymethylcysteinyl proteins and of the peptides obtained by enzymatic digestion. The amino acid sequences of these four ferredoxins differed from each other by 12-19, whereas 0-4 differences have been observed among ferredoxins from plants in the same genus and 14-40 differences were seen between different families. This suggests that these Solanum plants are distantly related to each other taxonomically.
