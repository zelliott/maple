To clone human WAF1 gene and construct WAF1-pcDNA3 recombinant plasmid, and to explore the biological regulating effects of WAF1 gene.

Human WAF1 gene was amplified and cloned into pcDNA3 vector by RT-PCR and DNA direct sequencing from Hela cells. By immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry staining, the identify the expression of the inserted WAF1 gene and its biological regulating effects on Rb, cyclin D1 gene.

Human WAF1-pcDNA3 recombinant plasmid was correctly constructed and transfected into Hct-8 cells. P21WAFI/Clip was successfully expressed. The functional characterization of the inserting WAF1 gene implied that P21WAF1/Cip1 expression could upregulate Rb gene and downregulate cyclin D1 gene at protein level.

Human WAF1-pcDNA3 can modulate the protein expression of the downstream gene.
