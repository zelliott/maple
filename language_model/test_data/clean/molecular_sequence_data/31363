Monoclonal antibodies generated against a family of related nuclear pore complex proteins (nucleoporins) from rat liver nuclei cross-react with several proteins in the yeast S. cerevisiae and show punctate nuclear envelope staining similar to the pattern seen in mammalian cells. We have cloned a gene encoding one of these proteins (NUP1) and have confirmed the localization of the NUP1 protein to the pore complex by immunofluorescence, using an epitope-tagged construct to differentiate it from other members of this family. The NUP1 protein is essential for cell viability, and overexpression from the yeast GAL10 promoter prevents further cell growth. The central domain of NUP1 consists of a series of degenerate repeats similar to those found in the nucleoskeletal protein NSP1, a protein that cross-reacts with monoclonal antibodies against NUP1. We propose that the repetitive domain is a feature common to the nucleoporins.
