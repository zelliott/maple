Secretion of the extracellular Rhizopus carboxyl proteinase (EC 3.4.23.6) by Rhizopus oligosporus is repressed in the presence of low-molecular-mass sources of nitrogen, sulphur and carbon. Proteinase is secreted when the medium is deficient in any one of these three nutrients. In the case of nitrogen metabolite repression, control is at the level of transcription. Induction of proteinase secretion by exogenous protein does not occur in any of the media examined.
