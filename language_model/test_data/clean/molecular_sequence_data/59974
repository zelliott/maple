Caliciviruses that infect animals including humans cause a specific disease syndrome in their respective hosts. Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a major pathogen of respiratory disease of cats, and human caliciviru is a causative agent of diarrhea. It has been suggested, furthermore, that FCV and newly recognized canine calicivirus (CaCV) may also be possible causes of diarrhea in these animal species. In this study nucleotide sequence of the RNA polymerase gene of two caliciviruses of canine origin, namely CaCV strain No. 48 and FCV-like strain Sapporo/283, and a number of FCV strains of respiratory and enteric origins was examined. The length of sequenced region, from the 5'LKDEL motif through the 3'YGDD motif of the gene, was 555 bp for CaCV No. 48 strain and 552 bp for the other FCV strains including Sapporo/283 strain. In phylogenetic analysis, CaCV No. 48 strain grouped as a distinct branch sharing ancestral roots with San Miguel sea lion virus, and FCVs formed one compact group in which Sapporo/283 strain was included.
