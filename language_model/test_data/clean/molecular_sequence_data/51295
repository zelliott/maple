Endo-beta-1,4-glucanase B (CenB) is a large (110 kDa) extracellular enzyme from the cellulolytic bacterium Cellulomonas fimi. CenB contains five domains, including a typical C.fimi cellulose-binding domain, separated by distinctive linker polypeptides (Meinke et al., 1991b). X-ray scattering analyses show that CenB has a highly elongated shape resembling beads on a string. The sizes of the polypeptides produced by treatment of CenB with proteases, together with their N-terminal amino acid sequences, show that at least two of the four linkers connecting the five domains of CenB are more sensitive to proteolysis than the domains themselves. It is concluded that the beads represent the domains of CenB, the string represents the linkers.
