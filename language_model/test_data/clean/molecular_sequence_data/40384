Three bacterial isolates from air samples in Korea, designated strains 6424S-25(T), 6515J-31(T) and 6424S-61(T), were characterized using a polyphasic approach. The cells were strictly aerobic, Gram-stain-negative, non-motile, non-spore-forming and rod-shaped. Phylogenetic analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed a clear affiliation with the phylum Bacteroidetes. Strains 6424S-25(T) and 6515J-31(T) showed 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 92.7-94.8 % to type strains of recognized species of the genus Adhaeribacter and strain 6424S-61(T) was closely related to Segetibacter koreensis Gsoil 664(T) (93.9 % similarity). The G+C contents of the DNA of strains 6424S-25(T), 6515J-31(T) and 6424S-61(T) were 44.5, 43.9 and 38.4 mol%, respectively. Major fatty acids of strains 6424S-25(T) and 6515J-31(T) were summed feature 4 (iso-C₁₇:₁ I and/or anteiso-C₁₇ :₁ B), iso-C₁₅:₀ and C₁₆:₁ω5c. The fatty acid content of strain 6424S-61(T) mainly comprised iso-C₁₅ :₁ G and iso-C₁₅:₀. Comparative analysis of phenotypic and phylogenetic traits indicated that strains 6424S-25(T) and 6515J-31(T) represented two novel species of the genus Adhaeribacter and that strain 6424S-61(T) should be considered as a novel species of the genus Segetibacter. The names Adhaeribacter aerophilus sp. nov. (type strain 6424S-25(T) =KACC 14118(T) =NBRC 106134(T)), Adhaeribacter aerolatus sp. nov. (type strain 6515J-31(T) =KACC 14117(T) =NBRC 106133(T)) and Segetibacter aerophilus sp. nov. (type strain 6424S-61(T) =KACC 14119(T) =NBRC 106135(T)) are proposed for these organisms.
