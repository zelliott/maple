Relationships among seventy specimens, fifteen species and three genera of phlebotomines were inferred from the phylogenetic analysis of small subunit nuclear rDNA, obtained by the PCR amplification and cloning of almost full-length genes. Outgroups included fifteen dipterans, and single representatives of four other insect orders. The more distant the taxa compared, the larger were the regions of ambiguous sequence alignment that needed to be deleted in order to avoid circularity in performing parsimony analyses. Phlebotomine sequences formed a monophyletic clade within the suborder Nematocera, with the progressively more basal sister groups of Diptera being Culicomorpha, Tipulomorpha and the suborder Brachycera. Within Phlebotominae, subgeneric relationships were resolved and the genus Phlebotomus was shown to be monophyletic, but markers for intraspecific geographical populations were not found and intergeneric relationships were not resolved.
