Chondroitin sulfate (CS) dermatan sulfate (DS), and CS/DS hybrid chains are biologically active like heparan sulfate, and structurally the most complex species of the glycosaminoglycan family along with heparan sulfate. They exist at the cell surface and extracellular matrix in the form of proteoglycans. They function as regulators of functional proteins such as growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and lipoproteins through interactions with the ligands of these proteins via specific saccharide domains. Structural alterations have been often implicated in pathological conditions, such as cancer and atherosclerosis. Recent microsequencing of CS/DS oligosaccharides that bind growth factors, such as pleiotrophin, and various monoclonal antibodies against CS/DS, have revealed a considerable number of unique oligosaccharide sequences. This review focuses on recent advances in the study of the structure-function relation of CS, DS and their hybrid chains in physiological and pathological conditions.
