A variety of ssDNA phagemid cloning vectors have been constructed that combine the advantages of the filamentous coliphages with a number of plasmid and other bacteriophage-encoded functions. The practical and biological advantages of a chimeric phage-plasmid vector are considerable, and the trend toward converting existing plasmids into ssDNA phagemids and consolidating any number of useful features into one or a few vectors will undoubtedly accelerate. A new helper phage specifically designed for the isolation of large amounts of single-stranded plasmid DNA simplifies the use of these cloning vehicles. Additional refinements in phagemid-helper phage systems should extend the potential of these vectors even further.
