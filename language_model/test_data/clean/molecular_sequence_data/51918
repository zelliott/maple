We present the cloning and sequencing of the ptsI gene, encoding enzyme I (EI) of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP): sugar phosphotransferase (PTS) transport system from Streptococcus salivarius. The ptsI gene corresponds to an open reading frame of 1731 nucleotides, which translates into a putative 577-amino acid (aa) protein with a M(r) of 62,948 and a pI of 4.49. The EI was produced in Escherichia coli under the control of its own promoter located immediately upstream of ptsI, a situation never previously reported for any other gene coding for an EI. The deduced aa sequence of the S. salivarius EI shows a high degree of similarity with the E. coli EI and the EI moiety of the multiphosphoryl transfer protein from Rhodobacter capsulatus. The S. salivarius EI also shares a highly conserved aa cluster with a non-PTS protein, the maize pyruvate:orthophosphate dikinase. The conserved cluster is located in a domain which is hypothesized to be the PEP-binding site.
