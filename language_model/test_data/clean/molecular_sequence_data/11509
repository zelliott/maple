The nucleotide sequence of pHT926, a cryptic plasmid found in Bacillus borstelensis HP926, was determined. pHT926 replicates by a rolling-circle mechanism and belongs to the pC194 plasmid family. The copy number of pHT926 was fourfold higher than that of pUB110 and very stably maintained in Bacillus choshinensis.
