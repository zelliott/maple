Hepatitis C virus codes a serine proteinase in nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) to produce viral replicative machinery. Recently, we reported that the activity of NS3 proteinase (region 1050-1214) was efficiently inhibited by some chelators. Kinetic analysis revealed that its K(m) value was 3.9 mM. In contrast, an enzyme covering region 1027-1214 (including N-terminal region of NS3) was found to show an improved K(m) of 0.3 mM and a remarkably reduced susceptibility to EDTA. These results suggest that the N-terminal region of NS3 is not essential for the proteinase activity but indispensable to maintain its structural integrity.
