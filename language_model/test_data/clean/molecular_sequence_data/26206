The opioid activities of [MeTyr1]-Dyn(1-7)-NH2, [MeTyr1,D-Leu8]-Dyn(1-8)-NH2, [MeTyr1,D-Leu8]-Dyn(1-9)-NH2, [MeTyr1,D-Leu8]-Dyn(1-10)-NH2, [MeTyr1,D-Leu8]-Dyn(1-11)-NH2, and [MeTyr1,D-Leu8,12]-Dyn(1-13)-NH2 were examined in the bioassays (guinea pig ileum, mouse vas deferens and rabbit vas deferens). Because [MeTyr1,D-Leu8]-Dyn(1-9)-NH2 showed the most potent opioid activity of the peptides tested, the biological activities of two kinds of Dyn(1-9) analogues, [MeTyr1,MeArg7,D-Leu8]-Dyn(1-9)-NHEt and [D-Cys2-Cys5,MeArg7,D-Leu8]-Dyn(1-9)-NH2 were determined and compared with those of [MeTyr1,MeArg7,D-Leu8]-Dyn(1-8)-NHEt and [D-Cys2-Cys5,MeArg7,D-Leu8]-Dyn(1-8)-NHEt in the three bioassays, in the receptor binding assays, and in the mouse tail pinch test after subcutaneous administration. The results suggest that the extension of the C-terminal in the peptide chain of [MeArg7,D-Leu8]-Dyn(1-8)-NH2 analogues by Arg is ineffective for increasing the kappa-opioid activities, kappa-receptor selectivity and/or analgesic effects of the peptides.
