A recombinant Bombyx mori profilin protein (rBmPFN) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21. Purified rBmPFN was used to generate anti-BmPFN polyclonal antibody, which were used to determine the subcellular localization of BmPFN. Immunostaining indicated that profilin can be found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm but is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analyses indicated that, during the larvae stage, profilin expression levels are highest in the silk gland, followed by the gonad, and are lowest in the fatty body. Additionally, BmPFN expression begins during the egg stage, increases during the larvae stage, reaches a peak during the pupa stage, and decreases significantly in the moth. Therefore, we propose that BmPFN may play an important role during larva stage development, especially in the silk gland.
