The aim of this study was to investigate methods for the synthesis of highly pure, well-characterized analogues of the lipid core peptide (LCP) system. Difficulties synthesizing and purifying conventional LCP systems have led to the requirement for a technique to produce highly pure, LCP-based vaccines for potential use in human clinical trials. The current study describes methods for the attachment of lipophilic adjuvants onto multi-epitopic peptide vaccines. Described is the synthesis, using native chemical ligation, of a highly pure, tri-epitopic, group A streptococcal (GAS) lipopeptide vaccine candidate. Intranasal immunization of the described tri-epitopic GAS lipopeptide with the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit induced high serum IgG antibody titers specific for each of the incorporated peptide epitopes.
