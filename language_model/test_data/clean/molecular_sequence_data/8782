Trimeric G proteins have emerged as important regulators of membrane trafficking. To explore a role for G beta gamma in endosome fusion, we have taken advantage of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK), an enzyme translocated to membranes by interaction with G beta gamma. The COOH terminus of beta ARK (beta ARKct) has a G beta gamma-binding domain which blocks some G beta gamma-mediated processes. We found that beta ARKct and peptide G, a peptide derived from beta ARKct, inhibit in vitro endosome fusion. Interestingly, peptide G and ARF share sequence similarity. Peptide G and beta ARKct reversed ARF-mediated inhibition of endosome fusion and blocked ARF binding to membranes. Using an ARF fusion protein, we show that both G beta gamma and G alpha s interact with the small GTPase ARF, an interaction that is regulated by nucleotide binding. We conclude that G proteins may participate in the regulation of vesicular trafficking by directly interacting with ARF, a cytosolic factor required for transport.
