A novel insertion sequence (IS)-like element was found in the 5'-upstream region of the alanine carrier protein-encoding gene (acp) in the thermophilic bacterium PS3 chromosomal DNA. The sequence contained an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 369 amino acids which revealed high similarity with ORFs from IS891 from the cyanobacterium Anabaena and IS1136 from Saccharopolyspora erythraea. The direction of transcription was the same as that of acp, and typical inverted and direct repeats characteristic of IS were found in both the 5' and 3' region of the ORF. Southern hybridization analysis of the chromosomal DNA revealed that multiple copies of the ORF sequence were contained in the PS3 genome. This element might well be a member of a new IS family including IS891 and IS1136, and we have designated this element IS1341. The analysis of acp expression in Escherichia coli cells indicated that IS1341 promotes the expression of acp.
