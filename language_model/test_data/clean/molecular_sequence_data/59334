Symbiotic bacteria of the genus Rhizobium synthesize lipo-chitooligosaccharides, called Nod factors (NFs), which act as morphogenic signal molecules on legume hosts. The common nodABC genes, present in all Rhizobium species, are required for the synthesis of the core structure of NFs. NodC is an N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, and NodB is a chitooligosaccharide deacetylase; NodA is involved in N-acylation of the aminosugar backbone. Specific nod genes are involved in diverse NF substitutions that confer plant specificity. We transferred to R. tropici, a broad host-range tropical symbiont, the ability to nodulate alfalfa, by introducing nod genes of R. meliloti. In addition to the specific nodL and nodFE genes, the common nodABC genes of R. meliloti were required for infection and nodulation of alfalfa. Purified NFs of the R. tropici hybrid strain, which contained chitin tetramers and were partly N-acylated with unsaturated C16 fatty acids, were able to elicit nodule formation on alfalfa. Inactivation of the R. meliloti nodABC genes suppressed the ability of the NFs to nodulate alfalfa. Studies of NFs from nodA, nodB, nodC, and nodI mutants indicate that (i) NodA of R. meliloti, in contrast to NodA of R. tropici, is able to transfer unsaturated C16 fatty acids onto the chitin backbone and (ii) NodC of R. meliloti specifies the synthesis of chitin tetramers. These results show that allelic variation of the common nodABC genes is a genetic mechanism that plays an important role in signaling variation and in the control of host range.
