tRNA was found to have emerged by tandem duplication of a ca. 37-base RNA ("semi-tRNA"). The most ancestral anticodon was "(5')CCA(3')". The peptidyltransferase (PT) region of 23S rRNA was concluded to be a 5S rRNA homologue. Important evidences were obtained for elucidating that the RNA transcript from the Bacillus subtilis (BSU) trrnD operon is a relic of an early peptide-synthesizing ribozyme.
