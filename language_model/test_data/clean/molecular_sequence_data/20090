The endothelium is a metabolically active organ that regulates the interaction between blood or lymph and the vessel or the surrounding tissue. Blood endothelium has been the object of many investigations whereas lymphatic endothelium biology is yet poorly understood. This report deals with a proteomic approach to the characterization and comparative analysis of lymphatic and blood vessel endothelial cells (ECs). By 2-DE we visualized the protein profiles of EC extracts from the thoracic aorta, inferior vena cava, and thoracic duct of Bos taurus. The three obtained electropherograms were then analyzed by specific software, and 113 quantitative and 25 qualitative differences were detected between the three endothelial gels. The cluster analysis of qualitative and quantitative differences evidenced the protein pattern of lymphatic ECs to be more similar to the venous than to the arterial one. Moreover, venous ECs were interestingly found showing a protein expression profile more similar to the lymphatic ECs than to the arterial ones. We also identified 64 protein spots by MALDI-TOF MS and ESI-IT MS/MS and three reference maps of bovine endothelium were obtained. The functional implications of the identified proteins in vascular endothelial biology are discussed.
