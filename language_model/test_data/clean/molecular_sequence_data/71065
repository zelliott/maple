Methylosulfonomonas methylovora M2 is an unusual gram-negative methylotrophic bacterium that can grow on methanesulfonic acid (MSA) as the sole source of carbon and energy. Oxidation of MSA by this bacterium is carried out by a multicomponent MSA monooxygenase (MSAMO). Cloning and sequencing of a 7.5-kbp SphI fragment of chromosomal DNA revealed four tightly linked genes encoding this novel monooxygenase. Analysis of the deduced MSAMO polypeptide sequences indicated that the enzyme contains a two-component hydroxylase of the mononuclear-iron-center type. The large subunit of the hydroxylase, MsmA (48 kDa), contains a typical Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] center with an unusual iron-binding motif and, together with the small subunit of the hydroxylase, MsmB (20 kDa), showed a high degree of identity with a number of dioxygenase enzymes. However, the other components of the MSAMO, MsmC, the ferredoxin component, and MsmD, the reductase, more closely resemble those found in other classes of oxygenases. MsmC has a high degree of identity to ferredoxins from toluene and methane monooxygenases, which are enzymes characterized by possessing hydroxylases containing mu-oxo bridge binuclear iron centers. MsmD is a reductase of 38 kDa with a typical chloroplast-like [2Fe-2S] center and conserved flavin adenine dinucleotide- and NAD-binding motifs and is similar to a number of mono- and dioxygenase reductase components. Preliminary analysis of the genes encoding MSAMO from a marine MSA-degrading bacterium, Marinosulfonomonas methylotropha, revealed the presence of msm genes highly related to those found in Methylosulfonomonas, suggesting that MSAMO is a novel type of oxygenase that may be conserved in all MSA-utilizing bacteria.
