The 30-kDa protein of tobacco mosaic virus, which is involved in cell-to-cell movement function, is phosphorylated in tobacco protoplasts. To investigate which portion of the protein is phosphorylated we inoculated several truncated 30-kDa protein mutants into protoplasts and determined whether or not those truncated proteins are phosphorylated. The results showed that amino acid residues 234-261 of the 30-kDa protein are required for this phosphorylation.
