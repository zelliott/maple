Differences in assignments from those in the universal genetic code occur in codes of mitochondria. In this report, the published sequences of the mitochondrial genes for COI and ND1 in a platyhelminth (Fasciola hepatica) are examined and it is concluded that AAA may be a codon for asparagine instead of lysine, whereas AAG is the sole codon for lysine in this species.
