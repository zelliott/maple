A Gram-positive, coccoid, non-endospore-forming actinobacterium (strain 12-Be-011(T)) was isolated from indoor wall material. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons, strain 12-Be-011(T) was clearly shown to belong to the genus Microlunatus and was most closely related to Microlunatus panaciterrae Gsoil 954(T) (95.7 %), Microlunatus soli CC-12602(T) (94.9 %), Microlunatus ginsengisoli Gsoil 633(T) (94.8 %), Microlunatus aurantiacus YIM 45721(T) (95.5 %) and Microlunatus phosphovorus DSM 10555(T) (94.7 %). The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained LL-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid. Mycolic acids were absent. The major menaquinone was MK-9(H₄). The polar lipid profile consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, two unknown phospholipids and one unknown glycolipid. The major fatty acids of iso-C₁₅:₀, anteiso-C₁₅:₀ and iso-C₁₆:₀ supported the affiliation of strain 12-Be-011(T) to the genus Microlunatus. Physiological and biochemical test results allowed a clear phenotypic differentiation of strain 12-Be-011(T) from all other species of the genus Microlunatus. Hence, strain 12-Be-011(T) can be regarded as a representative of a novel species, for which the name Microlunatus parietis sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain 12-Be-011(T) (=DSM 22083(T)=CCM 7636(T)).
