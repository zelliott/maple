We isolated four novel cDNA clones of rice (Oryza sativa L.), which encode predicted proteins with a KN1-like homeodomain. In situ hybridization and RT-PCR analysis with solid cDNA libraries as templates showed that these genes are expressed in distinct patterns during the early stages of rice embryogenesis.
