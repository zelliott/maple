We developed a new strategy to prepare double-stranded oligonucleotides containing recognition sites for specific binding proteins to examine DNA-protein interactions in various assays (gel mobility shift, UV-crosslinking, and affinity chromatography). The advantages of our procedures are as follows. Only one strand needs to be synthesized using a commercial oligonucleotide synthesizer. The probes can be labeled to a high specific activity and the exact position of labeling can be chosen, which is necessary for UV-crosslinking studies. Furthermore, multimeric binding sites for efficient DNA affinity chromatography can easily be generated. It is also possible to precisely place modified bases without the need for chemical precursors. Using this protocol, more detailed information about the binding protein factors and their behavior in interaction with recognition sites can be obtained.
