The translocation (11;14)(p13;q11) was observed in karyotypes of leukemic cells from a 3-year-old boy with T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL). Since this translocation is a recurrent marker of T-ALL, we undertook to investigate its mode of formation and role in leukemogenesis. The cytogenetic breakpoint on chromosome 14 occurs in 14q11, the same band wherein lies the T-cell receptor alpha/delta chain gene; and Southern hybridization analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow DNA uncovered a tumor-specific rearrangement in the D delta-J delta region of this locus. DNA encompassing the rearrangement was isolated by molecular cloning, and further analysis revealed it to be the t(11;14)(p13;q11) junction. Nucleotide sequence determination of the junction indicates that the 14q11 breakpoint occurs immediately adjacent to the D delta 2 gene segment. Hence, the translocation arose as an aberrant rearrangement between the downstream recombination signal of D delta 2 and a pseudo recombination signal adjacent to the chromosome 11 breakpoint. Finally, comparison of the breakpoint in band 11p13 with those of other translocations (11;14)(p13;q11) identified a breakpoint cluster region of approximately 1.2 kilobase-pairs (kb), alterations of which may promote the development of T-ALL.
