The gene (aprI) encoding alkaline serine protease (AprI; subtilase) from Alteromonas sp. strain O-7 was cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of aprI has been identified. The deduced amino acid sequence indicated that aprI codes for a precursor of 715 amino acids and the precursor is composed of four regions including a signal peptide, an N-terminal pro-region, a mature protease region and a C-terminal extension region of 215 amino acids as previously described for aprII [H. Tsujibo et al., Gene, 136, 247-251 (1993)]. The amino acid sequence of the mature AprI (AprI-M) showed high sequence homology with those of other class I subtilases. The C-terminal region was characterized by a repeat of 94 amino acids residues, which showed about 50% similarity with those of the C-terminal pro-region of several known proteases from Gram-negative bacteria.
