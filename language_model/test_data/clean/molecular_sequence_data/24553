The major auxin-binding protein (ZmERabp1) from maize (Zea mays L.) has been structurally characterized. We determined the position of a disulfide bridge in ZmERabp1 by mass-spectrometric analysis. We show that Cys2 and Cys61 are covalently linked and that residue Cys155 bears the free sulfhydryl group. By making use of electrospray mass spectrometry, the molecular mass of ZmERabp1 was determined to be 20,243 Da comprising a sugar moiety of 1865 Da, corresponding to a high mannose-type glycan structure. Due to the high homology among all characterized ABPs, the information on the disulfide bonds will be important for functional analysis of recombinantly expressed ABP1.
