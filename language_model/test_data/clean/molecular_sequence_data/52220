To elucidate the role of the COOH-terminal region of antithrombin III, we studied the effects of synthetic peptides corresponding to its sequence on the amidolytic and proteolytic activities of thrombin and Factor Xa in the presence or absence of the inhibitor, antithrombin III. The peptides ANRPFLVFI and IIFMGRVANP corresponding to residues Ala404 to Ile412 and Ile420 to Pro429, respectively, blocked the inhibition by antithrombin III. The effect of IIFMGRVANP was reduced in the presence of heparin. Both peptides at a concentration of 1 mM blocked complex formation between antithrombin III and thrombin or Factor Xa. The two peptides, particularly IIFMGRVANP, directly enhanced the amidolytic activity of thrombin and Factor Xa on the synthetic substrate Boc-Ala-Gly-Arg-MCA (where Boc is t-butoxycarbonyl and MCA is 4-methylcoumarin), which corresponds to residues P3-P1 of the reactive site of antithrombin III, and also on other substrates due to increased Vmax. IIFMGRVANP also shortened the thrombin-induced fibrinogen clotting time, whereas ANRPFLVFI inhibited the thrombin-catalyzed activation of protein C both in the presence and absence of thrombomodulin. The direct effect of ANRPFLVFI and IIFMGRVANP on thrombin was confirmed by enhancement of the incorporation of dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide into thrombin. These findings suggest that the COOH-terminal region of antithrombin III interacts with thrombin and Factor Xa to increase the reactivity of the enzyme, which may enhance acyl-bond formation between the inhibitor and the enzyme.
