Predicted amino acid sequences of the enzyme orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.23) from eight different organisms are compared. The comparisons are made on the basis of primary structural differences, primary amino acid sequence, hydropathy profiles, and secondary structure predictions. The organisms compared are Mus musculus, Aspergillus nidulans, Neurospora crassa, Kluyveromyces lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium.
