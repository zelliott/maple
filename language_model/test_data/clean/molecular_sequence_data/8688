We report here a novel method by which one can recover human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) DNA in a small volume (approximately 50 microliters) of solution from 8 ml of crude cell lysate which contains as few as several HIV DNA copies. The method uses the specific binding of HIV DNA to HIV probe DNA particles. The HIV DNA thus concentrated on the particles can be subjected to the PCR assay. The method also enables the examination of 100 individual blood specimens in a combined form.
