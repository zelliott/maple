Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized in vascular endothelial cells, and appears to play an important role in the control of blood pressure and platelet aggregation. A detailed understanding of the regulation of NO synthesis by endothelial cells has been hampered by the lack of molecular clones for endothelial NO synthase; we now report the isolation and characterization of such clones. The constitutive NO synthases present in endothelial cells and in brain share common biochemical and pharmacologic features. We purified NO synthase from bovine brain, and determined the amino acid sequence of several tryptic peptides. These sequence data were utilized to design PCR-generated NO synthase cDNA probes, which were used to isolate clones encoding NO synthase from a bovine aortic endothelial cell (BAEC) cDNA library. A full-length NO synthase cDNA clone was isolated, representing a protein of 1,205 amino acids with a molecular mass of 133 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of the BAEC NO synthase cDNA differs at numerous residues from the sequence determined for the purified bovine brain protein, and shows 50-60% sequence identity with recently isolated molecular clones for murine macrophage and rat brain NO synthase isoforms. Bovine genomic Southern blots probed with bovine brain and BAEC NO synthase cDNA probes identify distinct bands, indicating that these cDNAs are the products of different genes. Prolonged treatment of BAEC with the cytokine TNF alpha, which results in a marked increase in NO synthase activity, is associated with a decrease in the abundance of the 4.8-kb BAEC NO synthase transcript.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
