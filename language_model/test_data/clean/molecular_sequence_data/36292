This study determined whether the beneficial effects of exercise training on the diabetic heart previously observed are associated with alterations in ventricular myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform composition. Diabetes was induced in rats by i.v. streptozotocin. Trained rats were run on a treadmill for 60 min/day, 27 m/min, 10% grade. After 10 wks, ventricular MHC isoenzyme protein composition was analyzed for MHC composition using gel electrophoresis. alpha-MHC and beta-MHC mRNA were determined by Northern and slot blot hybridization techniques. Both protein and mRNA analyses indicated that sedentary control rats exhibited a predominance of alpha-MHC. Sedentary diabetics exhibited a shift to beta-MHC. Exercise trained diabetic rats showed a predominance of beta-MHC. The results indicate that treadmill exercise training of diabetic rat does not prevent the diabetes-induced shift in MHC composition towards the beta-MHC isoform, thus it is unlikely that the beneficial effects of exercise training on the diabetic heart, previously shown, are due to a normalization of the myosin isoform composition.
