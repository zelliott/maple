Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) and their derivatives are highly interesting tools to regulate gene expression and promising drugs for antiviral and anticancer therapy. In view of performing more extensive pharmacological trials requiring relatively great amounts of ODNs, we used a method of ODN synthesis derived from the phosphotriester approach which allow to prepare ODNs covalently linking cholesteryl residue (in 5' or 3') and phenazinium group (in 5'). HPLC purifications are discussed.
