Kinesins are intracellular multimeric transport motor proteins that move cellular cargo on microtubule tracks. It has been shown that the sea urchin KRP85/95 holoenzyme associates with a KAP115 non-motor protein, forming a heterotrimeric complex in vitro, called the Kinesin-II. Here we describe isolation of a cDNA clone corresponding to the klp-11 kinesin in C. elegans. Our sequence analysis of the encoded KLP-11 shows that it shares high homology with the OSM-3 kinesin. We also describe a nematode cDNA encoding KAP-1 that shares extensive homology with the sea urchin KAP115 kinesin associated protein. Sequence-based structural analysis of the OSM-3, KLP-11, and KAP-1, presented here suggests that these may form a heterotrimeric complex. We also describe the presence of a Drosophila armadillo consensus motif in CeKAP-1, first found in spKAP115, that suggests a possible role for the KAP-1 in signal transduction.
