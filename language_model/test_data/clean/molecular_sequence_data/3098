Guanylyl cyclase C (GC-C) was found to function as the principal receptor for heat-stable enterotoxins (STa), major causative factors in E. coli-induced secretory diarrhea. GC-C is enriched in intestinal epithelium, but was also detected in other epithelial tissues. The enzyme belongs to the family of receptor guanylyl cyclases, and consists of an extracellular receptor domain, a single transmembrane domain, a kinase homology domain, and a catalytic domain. GC-C is modified by N-linked glycosylation and, at least in the small intestine, by proteolysis, resulting in a STa receptor that is coupled non-covalently to the intracellular domain. So far two endogenous ligands of mammalian GC-C have been identified i.e. the small cysteine-rich peptides guanylin and uroguanylin. The guanylins are released in an auto- or paracrine fashion into the intestinal lumen but may also function as endocrine hormones in gut-kidney communication and as regulators of ion transport in extra-intestinal epithelia. They are thought to activate GC-C by inducing a conformational change in the extracellular portion of the homotrimeric GC-C complex, which allows two of the three intracellular catalytic domains to dimerize and form two active catalytic clefts. In the intestine, activation of GC-C results in a dual action: stimulation of Cl and HCO3 secretion, through the opening of apical CFTR Cl channels; and inhibition of Na absorption, through blockade of an apical Na/H exchanger. The principal effector of the GC-C effect on ion transport is cGMP dependent protein kinase type II, which together with GC-C and the ion transporters, may form a supramolecular complex at the apical border of epithelial cells.
