The general transcription factor TFIID facilitates recruitment of the transcription machinery to gene promoters and regulates initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. hTAF(II)130, a component of TFIID, interacts with and serves as a coactivator for multiple transcriptional regulatory proteins, including Sp1 and CREB. A yeast two-hybrid screen has identified an interaction between hTAF(II)130 and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), a chromatin-associated protein whose function has been implicated in gene silencing. We find that hTAF(II)130 associates with HP1 in an isoform-specific manner: HP1alpha and HP1gamma bind to hTAF(II)130, but not HP1beta. In addition, we show that endogenous hTAF(II)130 and components of TFIID in HeLa nuclear extracts associate with glutathione S-transferase-HP1alpha and -HP1gamma. hTAF(II)130 possesses a pentapeptide HP1-binding motif, and mutation of the hTAF(II)130 HP1 box compromises the interaction of hTAF(II)130 with HP1. We demonstrate that Gal4-HP1 proteins interfere with hTAF(II)130-mediated activation of transcription. Our results suggest that HP1alpha and HP1gamma associate with hTAF(II)130 to mediate repression of transcription, supporting a new model of transcriptional repression involving a specific interaction between a component of TFIID and chromatin.
