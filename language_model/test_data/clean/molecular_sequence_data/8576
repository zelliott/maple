We have characterized a so-called D genome specific repetitive DNA sequence (pAs1) of Aegilops squarrosa L. (2n = 14, genome DD) with respect to its DNA sequence and its distribution among Triticeae species. The clone consisted of three units of a repetitive DNA sequence of 336 or 337 base pairs, and was AT rich (65.2%). DNA analyses revealed the presence of the pAs1-like sequences in other genomes of Triticeae species, although the repetition was greatly (as much as 100-fold) variable among the genomes. The repetitive sequences from 10 diploid species were amplified using PCR with specific primers, and the sequential variability was analyzed by the digestion pattern obtained with five restriction enzymes. Since the AfaI site was the most conservatively present in the unit of the repetitive sequences, we named them "Afa family." The analysis clearly displayed the variation of the repetitive sequences regardless of the uniformity of the size of the amplified product. These results indicated that plural amplification events of these repetitive sequences happened independently in the genome evolution of Triticeae.
