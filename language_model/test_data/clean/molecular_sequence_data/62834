Sequence analysis of vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylases (VKGC) has revealed the presence of a novel domain, HTTM (for horizontally transferred transmembrane) in its N terminus. In contrast to most known domains, HTTM contains four transmembrane regions. Its occurrence in eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea is probably caused by horizontal gene transfer rather than by early evolution. The conservation of VKGC catalytic sites also indicates an enzymatic function for the other family members.
