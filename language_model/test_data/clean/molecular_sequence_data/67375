Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium rough strain-specific phage SSU5 was isolated, and its whole genome was sequenced. The 103,229-bp-long double-stranded DNA genome of SSU5 encodes 130 open reading frames with one tRNA for asparagine. Genomic analysis revealed that SSU5 might be the phylogenetic origin of cryptic plasmid pHCM2 harbored by Salmonella Typhi CT18.
