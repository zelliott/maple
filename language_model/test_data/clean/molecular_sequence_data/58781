A novel protein target of mouse calcyclin (S100A6) was detected by a gel overlay method with 125I-labelled calcyclin. Interaction of calcyclin with its 30 kDa target protein (p30) present in Ehrlich ascites tumour (EAT) cells depended on the presence of Ca2+ ions. The binding of p30, evidenced by the reaction with 125I-labelled calcyclin, was found to be of higher affinity than the binding between mouse calcyclin and annexin II or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Examination of tissue extracts by the gel overlay method has shown that p30 is present not only in the EAT cells but also in mouse brain and spleen. This novel target protein of mouse calcyclin was purified to homogeneity from EAT cells by means of Phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, affinity chromatography and CM-cellulose chromatography. Purified p30 was digested with alpha-chymotrypsin and a partial amino acid sequence of one of the resulting peptides was established. A database search analysis revealed that the sequence is unique, with a similarity of less than 55% to any other known protein sequence.
