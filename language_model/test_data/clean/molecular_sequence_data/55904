Using a variety of techniques, including sequence alignment, secondary structure prediction, molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics, we have constructed a model for the three-dimensional structure of P-450arom (human aromatase) based on that of P-450cam, the only cytochrome P-450 enzyme for which the crystal structure is known. The predicted structure is found to be in good agreement with current experimental data; both direct, from site-directed mutagenesis studies, and indirect, from the consideration of the structures and activities of known substrates and inhibitors.
