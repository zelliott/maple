RNA loop-loop complexes are motifs that regulate biological functions in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In E. coli, RNAI, an antisense RNA encoded by the ColE1 plasmid, regulates the plasmid replication by recognizing through loop-loop interactions RNAII, the RNA primer that binds to the plasmidic DNA to initiate the replication. Rop, a plasmid-encoded homodimeric protein interacts with this transient RNAI-RNAII kissing complex. A surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensor was used to investigate this protein-nucleic acid ternary complex, at 5 degrees C, in experimental conditions such as the protein binds either to the loop-loop complex while it dissociates or to a saturated stable RNAI-RNAII surface. The results show that RNAI hairpin dissociates from the RNAII surface 110 times slower in the presence of Rop than in its absence. Rop binds to RNAI-RNAII with an on-rate of 3.6 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1) and an off-rate of 0.11 s(-1), resulting in a binding equilibrium constant equal to 31 nM. A Scatchard-plot analysis of the interaction monitored by SPR confirms a 1:1 complex of Rop and RNAI-RNAII as observed for non-natural Rop-loop-loop complexes.
