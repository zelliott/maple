The nucleotide sequence of the glycoprotein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strain Clone-30 has been determined. The open reading frame of the HN gene contains 1731 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 577 amino acids. Three highly conserved patterns among all paramyxovirus HN glycoproteins, and one additional conserved species-specific region are present. The protein contains five potential N-glycosylation sites, all but one located in the C-terminal external domain. The secondary structure prediction shows that the C-terminal external domain is mostly arranged in beta-sheets, while alpha-helices are predominantly located in the N-terminal domain. The nucleotide sequence data of the HN gene reported in this paper has been deposited in the GenBank database, under accession number AF098289.
