SV40 based shuttle vectors able to be packaged as pseudovirions have been used either as naked DNA or as pseudovirus to analyse the mutation frequency and the UV-induced mutation spectra obtained after transfection or infection of COS7 monkey cells. The frequency of supF spontaneous mutants was similar whatever the state of the vector, indicating that the transfection step is not responsible for the high spontaneous mutation frequency when using shuttle vectors. Nevertheless the UV-induced mutation frequency of the supF gene was higher when transfected DNA was replicated into COS7 cells than when pseudovirus infection was performed. The UV induced mutation spectra was basically similar in both situations but a new hot-spot at nucleotide 110 was obtained after pseudovirus infection. UV-pretreated and control COS7 cells were infected with untreated or UV-damaged pi SVPC7 shuttle virus and the survival and the supF mutation frequency were analysed in the progeny. The survival of UV-damaged pseudovirus replicated in 10 J/m2 UV-pretreated cells was 2-fold higher than in untreated cells. This increase in the survival was accompanied by a slight enhancement in the number of supF mutants.
