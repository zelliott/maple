The nematode Haemonchus contortus is an important parasite of cattle and sheep. We describe here the cloning of a cDNA encoding a 53 kDa hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1). The deduced protein shows 73% identity to a 50 kDa hexokinase deduced from a Caenorhabditis elegans cosmid. Alignment with mammalian hexokinases reveals two short amino acid insertions in the H. contortus hexokinase. Software tools for structural protein analysis (ExPASy server, Geneva) localize these insertions on the surface of the molecule, suggesting these surface changes as potential target sites for chemotherapeutic drugs.
