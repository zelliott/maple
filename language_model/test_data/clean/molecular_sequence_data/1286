We have characterized a transferable tetracycline resistance (Tcr) element from a Streptococcus intermedius isolate. The gene responsible for this resistance was identified by PCR and Southern hybridization as tet(S). Furthermore, the genetic support for this determinant was shown to be a conjugative transposon closely related to Tn916. This element has been designated Tn916S.
