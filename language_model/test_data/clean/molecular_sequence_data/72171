The Ca(2+)-sensitive and mitochondrial enzyme FAD-linked glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (m-GDH) represents an essential component of the pancreatic B-cell glucose-sensing device. This report deals with the first identified case of mutation in the calcium-binding domain of the m-GDH gene in a patient with type-2 diabetes and his glucose-intolerant half sister. Single strand conformation polymorphism analysis indeed revealed an abnormal mobility of the 32P-labelled polymerase chain reaction product in these two subjects. The corresponding base pair mutations and amino acid changes were documented. In the diabetic proband, the relative extent of the Ca(2+)-induced activation of m-GDH in CD3+ T-lymphocytes was lower than in his brother with a normal m-GDH gene sequence.
