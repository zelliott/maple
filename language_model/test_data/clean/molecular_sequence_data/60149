Two new spirostanol saponins, tuberosides D and E, have been isolated from the seeds of Allium tuberosum. On the basis of spectral data and chemical reactions, their structures were established as (25S)-5alpha-spirostane-2alpha,3beta-diol 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2)-O-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->4 )]-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and (25S)-5alpha-spirostan-2alpha, 3beta-diol 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)-O-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->4)] -O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, respectively.
