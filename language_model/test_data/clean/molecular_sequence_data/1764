This study reports on the complete genome sequence of Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3, the type member of the genus Ampelovirus. The genome is 17 919 nt in size and contains 13 open reading frames (ORFs). Previously, the sequence of 13 154 nt of the 3'-terminal of the genome was reported. The newly sequenced portion contains a 158 nt 5' UTR, a single papain-like protease and a methyltransferase-like (MT) domain. ORF1a encodes a large polypeptide with a molecular mass of 245 kDa. With a predicted +1 frameshift, the large fusion protein generated from ORF1a/1b would produce a 306 kDa polypeptide. Phylogenetic analysis using MT domains further supports the creation of the genus Ampelovirus for mealy-bug-transmitted viruses in the family Closteroviridae.
