The esg locus of Myxococcus xanthus appears to control the production of a signal that must be transmitted between cells for the completion of multicellular development. DNA sequence analysis suggested that the esg locus encodes the E1 decarboxylase (composed of E1 alpha and E1 beta subunits) of a branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKAD) that is involved in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism. The properties of an esg::Tn5 insertion mutant supported this conclusion. These properties include: (i) the growth yield of the mutant was reduced with increasing concentrations of the BCAAs in the medium while the growth yield of wild-type cells increased, (ii) mutant extracts were deficient in BCKAD activity, and (iii) growth of the mutant in media with short branched-chain fatty acids related to the expected products of the BCKAD helped to correct the mutant defects in growth, pigmentation and development. The esg BCKAD appears to be involved in the synthesis of long branched-chain fatty acids since the mutant contained reduced levels of this class of compounds. Our results are consistent with a model in which the esg-encoded enzyme is involved in the synthesis of branched-chain fatty acids during vegetative growth, and these compounds are used later in cell-cell signalling during development.
