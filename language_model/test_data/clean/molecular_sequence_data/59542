Transgenic mice carrying multiple copies of a recoverable lambda phage shuttle vector carrying the supF mutation reporter gene (lambda supF) were constructed for the purpose of studying mutagenesis in a whole animal. Spontaneous mutations in rescued supF target genes from mouse liver and skin were analyzed. The mutation frequency was similar in both tissues (in the range of 2 x 10(-5)), but the spectrum of point mutations was distinct, with transitions common in the skin and transversions more prominent in the liver (P = 0.01). These results may help to elucidate pathways of endogenous mutagenesis in vivo, and they illustrate potentially important tissue-specific differences in genetic instability.
