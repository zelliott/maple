We used a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to diagnose HTLV-1 carriers. The DNA isolated from the nuclear extract obtained from frozen whole blood was found appropriate for PCR study both qualitatively and quantitatively. The use of freshly frozen whole blood made the field work much easier, and the use of a nuclear extraction procedure allowed DNA isolation in just 4 microcentrifuge tubes. We could not attain sufficient sensitivity to detect a single molecule with single-step PCR, but nested PCR was confirmed to detect a single molecule/reaction. All samples of the seropositive group including 94 blood donors, 66 mothers, and 13 children were positive in the nested PCR, while none of the seronegative group, including 198 blood donors and 285 children, was positive. Although 18/717 (2.5%) cord blood samples obtained from babies born to carrier mothers were PCR-positive, none of 5 formula-fed children tested who had been PCR-positive in the cord blood gave evidence of infection later on. Furthermore, all of 4 seropositive infected children who were formula-fed had been PCR-negative in their cord blood. The results are not consistent with intrauterine infection, but suggest the presence of a perinatal or postnatal infection route other than through breast milk.
