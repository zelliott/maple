We have identified a gene, GSG1 (general sporulation gene 1), required for sporulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Diploids homozygous for a disruption of GSG1 fail to sporulate. The gene has an open reading frame of 2094 bp, encoding a polypeptide with an expected size of 77 kDa. GSG1 is expressed mitotically in both a and alpha haploids, and both mitotically and meiotically in diploids. The message level of GSG1 increases approximately two-fold after 4-6 h of sporulation. gsg1 mutants enter pre-meiotic DNA synthesis later than wild-type diploids. Mutant diploids are not rescued by spo13. These results suggest that GSG1 has a role late in meiosis following DNA replication.
