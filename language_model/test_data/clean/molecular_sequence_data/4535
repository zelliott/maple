In past years, much attention has been paid to the HIV-1 envelope (env) protein variable region 3 (V3), termed the principal neutralizing determinant. HIV-1 vaccines were often designed to target V3, and vaccine efficacy was often measured with V3-based assays. Thus, some disappointment resulted when volunteers in first clinical vaccine trials generated V3-specific antibodies that could not protect against V3-similar viruses. We describe an analysis of V1 and V2 sequence effects on antibody binding to V3 and non-V3 determinants. This study involved the preparation of seven full-length (gp160), chimeric env proteins in a vaccinia virus (VV) expression system. Chimeric proteins displayed different V1-V2 sequences but were otherwise identical. A panel of 12 monoclonal antibodies was then tested for binding activities toward the seven chimeras. Results showed that V1-V2 sequences affected antibody binding to env, both in V3 and non-V3 positions. These data demonstrate the enormous complexity of HIV-1 env protein conformation and antigenic determinants. Respect for the complexity of antibody-antigen interactions encourages the design of sophisticated immunoglobulin and protein cocktails for use in HIV-1 therapies and vaccines, respectively.
