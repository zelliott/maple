Diverse types of linear RNA and DNA autonomously replicating genetic elements exist in prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts, yet linear elements that replicate by reverse transcription have not been identified. Here, we report the sequence and organization of two linear mitochondrial plasmids of the fungal plant pathogen F. oxysporum and the characterization of a plasmid-associated reverse transcriptase activity. Plasmids pFOXC2 and pFOXC3 are 1.9 kb in length and have a "clothespin" genomic structure, which includes a terminal hairpin and a telomere-like iteration of a 5 bp sequence at the other terminus. The retroplasmid replication cycle involves novel strategies for copying terminal sequences, which may provide clues concerning the origin of telomerase as well as the evolution of linear DNAs.
