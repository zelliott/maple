RAPD (Random Amolified Polymorphism DNA) was employed to detect molecular markers linked to sex in S. grosvenorii by BSA (Bulked Segregant Analysis). 18 RAPD markers linked to sex were selected in BSA by screening 90 primers. Only the marker amplified by S1431 was present in all 8 male individuals tested while absent from all 8 female individuals tested. It showed that S1431 was a male RAPD marker linked to sex.
