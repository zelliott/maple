The basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) region of the immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein E47 (IEB E47) was prepared in high yield by a solid-phase peptide synthesis methodology. Size-exclusion chromatography, sedimentation equilibrium and cross-linking data showed that the synthetic bHLH protein, 1, was dimeric, and higher-order aggregates of trimer and tetramer were also observed. The circular dichroism spectrum of 1 showed a high helical content, which increased upon addition of DNA containing the kappa E2 sequence. Gel mobility shift experiments showed that protein 1 bound sequence specifically to the kappa E2 sequence with a binding constant of 10(-10) M2, and had an affinity for other E box sequences as well. Comparisons between the co-crystal structure of IEB E47 with DNA and structural studies in solution showed lower helical contents in solution as would have been predicted from the crystal structure.
