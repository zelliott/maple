Cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) have been recently described as a major class of non-coding RNAs. These transcripts are, however, extremely unstable in normal cells and their analyzes pose specific technical problems. In this chapter, after a brief introduction discussing general aspects associated with the analysis of non-coding RNAs, we provide details of methods to enrich, map, and quantify this unconventional class of transcripts.
