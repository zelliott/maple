Alleles encoding five HLA-A and B Ag characteristic of black populations have been isolated and their nucleotide sequences determined. In each case, the "black" allele is similar to a "related" allele found in caucasoid populations. The primary differences between these pairs of alleles are localized clusters of nucleotide substitutions that change two to five residues of the Ag recognition site. The pattern of differences indicates that the pairs of black and caucasoid alleles diverged primarily as a result of interallelic conversion events.
