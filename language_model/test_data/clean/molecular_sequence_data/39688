Penicillium marneffei is a dimorphic fungus native to Southeast Asia. Disease caused by this organism, until recently a very rare condition, has increased dramatically in parallel with the increase in the number of individuals in the region immunocompromised by AIDS and other conditions. While much research has been performed on the control of dimorphic switching in P. marneffei, there is a relative dearth of information regarding the proteinases secreted by this pathogen. Our laboratory has purified and characterized two proteinases produced by this organism in liquid culture and cloned the gene of a third. Both the recombinant enzyme expressed from the cloned gene and one of those purified from culture supernatants have been identified as members of the eqolisin family, a group of pepstatin-insensitive acid proteinases. The other enzyme purified from a culture supernatant is a serine proteinase with activity in the neutral pH range. These enzymes appear to be differentially expressed, depending on culture conditions.
