Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis with primers for the pp65, a-sequence, glycoprotein B, and major immediate early genes of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) was used to study five congenitally-infected infants and their CMV-infected family members. Family members excreting CMV included three mothers and two siblings. The PCR results indicated that the CMV strain excreted by each infant was indistinguishable from that excreted by the corresponding family member. By contrast, the molecular profiles of the CMV strains were distinct between families, indicating that the PCR algorithm described in this study is a useful method for analyzing CMV strains.
