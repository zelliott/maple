Cardiolipin (CL) is an anionic phospholipid with a dimeric structure. In eukaryotes, it is primarily localized in the inner membranes of mitochondria. Although the biosynthetic pathway of CL is well known, the gene for CL synthase has not been identified in any higher organisms. In this study, the CLS gene for a CL synthase has been identified in a higher plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. We have shown that the CLS gene encodes a CL synthase by demonstrating its ability to catalyze the reaction of CL synthesis from CDP-diacylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol, and that CLS is targeted into mitochondria. These findings demonstrate that CLS is a CL synthase located in mitochondria.
