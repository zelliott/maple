Mass spectrometry comparative screening was used to identify ovarian regulatory peptides involved in the successive steps of egg-laying in the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis. The peptide content of full-grown oocytes (FGO) was compared with that of oocyte-conditioned medium, which resulted in the detection of peptides that were present in both samples. These peptides, which are suspected of being released by the oocyte in the genital tract, were submitted to a structural analysis. This strategy led to the characterization of a new ovarian regulatory peptide (EISLDKD) able to inhibit the contractions of the whole female genital tract and of the main nidamental glands (MNG). As EISLDKD appeared to be the first regulatory peptide directly involved, at physiological concentrations, in the secretion of the egg capsule by the main nidamental glands, it was named SepCRP for Sepia Capsule Releasing Peptide. Mass spectrometry analysis clearly demonstrated that SepCRP was expressed during vitellogenesis by the ovarian follicles and released by the FGO in the lumen of the female genital tract. In association with the ovarian 5-HT, SepCRP would be responsible for the storage of FGO to avoid the spawning of unfertilized oocytes before mating. Released by the distal oviduct in the mantle cavity, SepCRP probably in association with a cocktail of ovarian regulatory factors targets the MNG to regulate the egg capsule secretion. Thus, the ovary appeared to be one of the main sources of regulatory peptides involved in the successive steps of egg-laying in the cephalopod mollusk S. officinalis.
