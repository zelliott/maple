The GCD2 gene product is required in conditions of amino acid sufficiency to repress the synthesis of GCN4, a transcriptional activator of amino acid biosynthetic genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. GCD2 is also required unconditionally for cell viability. The constitutive derepression of GCN4 expression and temperature sensitivity for growth associated with GCD2 alleles, known as gcd12 mutations, are completely masked by wild-type GCN3, a positive regulator of GCN4 expression. This observation suggests that GCN3 can promote or at least partially substitute for GCD2 function in normal growth conditions, while acting as an antagonist of GCD2 in amino acid starvation conditions. We report here that the predicted amino acid sequence of GCN3 shows extensive similarity with the carboxyl-terminal portion of GCD2. Based on this finding, it seems likely that gcd12 mutations specifically affect the domain of GCD2 that is similar in sequence to GCN3. We propose that GCN3 can substitute for this domain in a gcd12 mutant grown in normal growth conditions, and that modification of GCN3 in starvation conditions causes it to interfere with, rather than substitute for GCD2 function. A gcd2 deletion and gcd2-1 are each expected to inactivate a second domain for which GCN3 cannot substitute, accounting for the inability of GCN3 to mask the phenotypes associated with these mutations.
