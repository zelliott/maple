We report the fluorogenic detection of the product of base excision repair (an abasic site) in a specific sequence of duplex DNA. This is achieved by DNA-templated chemistry, employing triple helix-forming probes that contain unnatural nucleobases designed to selectively recognize the site of a missing base. Light-up signals of up to 36-fold were documented, and probes could be used to monitor enzymatic removal of a damaged base.
