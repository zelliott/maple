A PCR assay was employed to detect sequence homologous to the transposase gene of the Tc1 family of transposable elements in a wide variety of animals. Amplification products of the appropriate size were obtained from most insects (92 of 108 examined; 85%), most other invertebrates (33 of 43; 77%), and many vertebrates (18 of 36; 50%). Sequencing a sample of cloned PCR products from eight insects, one hydra, and two frogs revealed that each had multiple distinct members of the family in their genomes. In the most extreme case, the horn fly Haematobia irritans yielded evidence of seventeen distinct types of Tc1 family elements. Most of the sequences obtained indicate that the elements are within the range of variation already known from fungi, nematodes, flies, fish and frogs. Some, however, had novel length variants or divergent sequences, indicating that they represent new subfamilies of these transposons. These results indicate that this family of transposons is extremely common in animal genomes, with multiple representatives in most genomes.
