Full-length cDNAs of four new genes encoding cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins L14 and L20 (large ribosomal subunit) and S1 and S27 (small ribosomal subunit) were isolated and sequenced during the analysis of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome. One of the Sz. pombe genes encoding translation elongation factor EF-2 was also cloned and its precise position on chromosome I established. A unified nomenclature was proposed, and the list of all known genetic determinants encoding cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins of Sz. pombe was compiled. By now, 76 genes/cDNAs encoding different ribosomal proteins have been identified in the fission yeast genome. Among them, 35 genes are duplicated and three homologous genes are identified for each of the ribosomal proteins L2, L16, P1, and P2.
