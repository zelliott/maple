Oligosaccharides were analyzed by a combination of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS). First, oligosaccharides labeled with 2-aminopyridine were studied to see if they could be analyzed by MS under the conditions used for separation by HPLC. Pyridylamino (PA)-oligosaccharides could be analyzed under these conditions, although the mass spectra were affected. Then, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to analyze a PA-oligosaccharide mixture derived from human immunoglobulin G. The PA-oligosaccharides were separated on a reversed-phase column and mass-analyzed directly. The observed molecular weights were close to or identical to those expected from the structures, which were estimated from the elution position on HPLC. This method is rapid and simple, as the mass spectrometer can give the accurate molecular weight of each PA-oligosaccharide in one chromatography run, even if the HPLC separation is incomplete. This method can be used to extend the so-called two-dimensional mapping of PA-oligosaccharides. The structure can be studied in greater detail by tandem MS.
