To analyze in detail the multigene family encoding the plasma-membrane H(+)-ATPase (pma) in Nicotiana plumbaginifolia Viv., five new pma genes (pma 5-9) were isolated. Three of these (pma 6, 8, 9) were fully characterized and classified into new and independent subfamilies. Their cell-type expression was followed by the beta-glucuronidase (gusA) reporter-gene method. While the pma8-gusA transgene was not expressed in transgenic tobacco, expression of the two other transgenes (pma6- and pma9-gusA) was found to be restricted to particular cell types. In the vegetative tissues, pma6-gusA expression was limited to the head cells of the leaf short trichomes, involved in secretion, and to the cortical parenchyma of the young nodes where the developing leaves and axillary flowering stalks join the stem. In the latter tissues, gene expression was enhanced by mechanical stress, suggesting that H(+)-ATPase might be involved in the strength of the tissues and their resistance to mechanical trauma. The pma9-gusA transgene was mainly expressed in the apical meristem of adventitious roots and axillary buds as well as in the phloem tissues of the stem, in which expression depended on the developmental stage. In flowers, pma9-gusA expression was limited to the mature pollen grains and the young fertilized ovules, while that of pma6-gusA was identified in most of the organs. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of leaf and stem RNA confirmed the expression of pma 6 and 9, while pma8 was found to be expressed in both organs at a lower level. In conclusion, although pma 6 and 9 had a more restricted expression pattern than the previously characterized pma genes, they were nevertheless expressed in cell types in which H(+)-ATPase had not been previously detected.
