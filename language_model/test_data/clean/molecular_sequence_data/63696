The Begomovirus genus is the largest genus of the Geminiviridae family and comprises the whitefly transmitted geminiviruses that infect dicotyledonous plants. They can be either mono or bipartite. In this chapter, we describe the cloning of begomovirus replication modules and the subsequent functional characterization of geminivirus replication origins.
