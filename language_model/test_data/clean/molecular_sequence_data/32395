A new full-length cDNA (Ssd12) encoding a Delta12-fatty acid desaturase (Delta12-FAD) was cloned from Sapium sebiferum using RT-PCR and RACE methods. Ssd12 contained a 1146 bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 381 amino acids. The amino acid sequence showed a much higher match with microsomal Delta12-FAD amino acid sequences than chloroplast Delta12-FAD amino acid sequences. Genomic Southern blot analysis suggested that Ssd12 had at least two copies. Ssd12 transcripts were detected in roots, leaves, stems, and seeds by real time PCR.
