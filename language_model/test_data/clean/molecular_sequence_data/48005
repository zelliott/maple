This paper describes the relationship of a canine calicivirus, named No.48, to other human and animal caliciviruses, based on phylogeny of the 3' half of its genome. It was found that No.48 constitutes a unique lineage, most closely related but distinct from feline and San Miguel sea lion caliciviruses.
