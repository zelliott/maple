STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) proteins undergo cytokine-dependent phosphorylation on serine and tyrosine. STAT3, a transcription factor for acute phase response genes, was found to act as an adapter molecule in signal transduction from the type I interferon receptor. STAT3 bound to a conserved sequence in the cytoplasmic tail of the IFNAR1 chain of the receptor and underwent interferon-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation. The p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which activates a series of serine kinases, bound to phosphorylated STAT3 and subsequently underwent tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, STAT3 acts as an adapter to couple another signaling pathway to the interferon receptor.
