We describe the finding of an Alu repeat dimorphism within the first intron of the MICB gene. The frequencies of the two AluyMICB alleles, AluyMICB*0(absence of insertion) and AluyMICB*1(presence of insertion), and their associations with the highly polymorphic HLA-B locus were determined for 51 human cell lines and for 109 and 200 Caucasians and northeastern Thais, respectively. Analysis of the AluyMICB and HLA-B allelic relationships revealed that AluyMICB*1 occurred at relatively low gene frequency (0.118-0.157) [corrected] but was strongly associated with HLA-B17 (HLA-B57,HLA-B58) and HLA-B13. The AluyMICB locus provides a useful dimorphic marker for investigations on the level of linkage disequilibrium between MICB, MICA, and HLA-B loci.
