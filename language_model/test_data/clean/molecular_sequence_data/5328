We have previously reported the presence of phosphate bound beta-1,2 linked oligomannosides with unusually high degrees of polymerization (DP > 7) in the mannan of Candida albicans strain VW32. To confirm this observation, we have prepared these oligomannosides from the mannan of C. albicans strain NIH A 207. Gel filtration chromatography and TLC analysis revealed DP up to 14. For both strains, NMR analysis confirmed the exclusive presence of beta-1,2 linkages in the pools of oligomannosides with a DP higher than 6 which presented an average DP of 10.6 (VW32) and 10.4 (NIH A 207). These results are important to consider in relation with the ability of these C. albicans derived oligomannosides to trigger TNFalpha synthesis according to their DP.
