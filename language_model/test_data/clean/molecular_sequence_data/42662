HLA-DRB1*04 gene variants were determined in apparently healthy Japanese with PCR-SSCP and PCR-RFLP, and HLA-B-DRB1*04 haplotype frequencies were estimated statistically. DRB1*0405, which consisted of 60% of the Japanese DRB1*04 gene pool, was associated strongly with HLA-B54. This association was observed only for DRB1*0405, and not for any other DR4 variants. DRB1*0403 and DRB1*0406, which share the same peptide sequence except for amino acid 37, were both associated with B35 and B62. DRB1*0407 was associated exclusively with B35. DRB1*0410 was associated with B60 and B61. B60 and B61, on the other hand, were associated only with DRB1*0410 and DRB1*0405. B35 was associated with all DR4 microvariants. With this possible exception, our calculation suggests that unique B-DR associations were present even for DR4 microvariants. The knowledge of HLA-B and DRB1*04 associations would be useful in clinical settings.
