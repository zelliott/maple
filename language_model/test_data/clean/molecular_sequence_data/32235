Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) encompasses two clinical phenotypes, one producing mucosal blisters and the other mucosal and skin lesions (mcPV). The mucosal blister-producing PV variant is characterized by autoantibodies against desmoglein (Dsg)3, whereas mucosal and skin lesion-producing PV is characterized by autoantibodies to Dsg3 and Dsg1. The present study was aimed at disclosing the diversity and clonality of the anti-Dsg3 response, as well as whether anti-Dsg3 B cells are Ag selected. Human-mouse heterohybridomas were generated by fusion of EBV-transformed or freshly isolated PBLs from six PV patients with mouse myeloma cells. A total of 73 anti-Dsg hybridomas (47 IgM and 26 IgG) were isolated. Over 90% are specific for both Dsg1 and Dsg3 indicating extensive cross-reactivity between these responses. V(H) gene segment use by IgM hybridomas is diverse, but is restricted among IgG hybridomas, where the majority uses one of two V(H) genes. V(L) gene segment use was diverse even among IgG hybridomas suggesting that the V(L) is less critical to defining desmoglein specificity. Additionally, the IgG hybridomas were extensively mutated and the distribution and nature of the mutations suggested that they had been Ag selected. We conclude that the potentially pathogenic IgG anti-Dsg response is restricted in V(H) use, is somatically mutated, and is Ag selected.
