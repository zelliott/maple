Here we present a highly efficient protocol for on-the-resin coupling of fluorescent dyes or other functional groups to the N-termini of synthetic peptides prior to cleavage and deprotection. The protocol avoids expensive preactivated dyes and instead employs carboxylated dyes activated by large amounts of coupling reagents. The protocol was used to label peptides with low reactivity such as long hydrophobic peptides and peptides with strong tendencies to form sterically shielding structures or aggregates in solution. In all cases, the yields far exceeded those from commercially available preactivated compounds.
