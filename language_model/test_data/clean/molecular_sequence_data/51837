Sorbin is a newly isolated intestinal peptide that has been purified because of its ability to induce water absorption. The effects that sorbin and some synthetic peptides corresponding to its C-terminal sequence have on duodenal absorption of water, chloride, and sodium were studied in comparison with the effects of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), [D-Ala,Met]-enkephalinamide (DAMA), and angiotensin II. The technique of an in situ ligated duodenal loop in the rat was used for all peptides. Under the experimental conditions used, a low basal secretion of water, chloride, and sodium was obtained; VIP induced an increase of the secretion, whereas DAMA induced an absorption, both in the nanomolar dose range. Angiotensin II and sorbin induced an absorption in the picomolar dose range. The most effective doses of sorbin peptides but not of angiotensin induced the lowest final concentrations of Na+ and Cl- obtainable without inducing secondary water secretion. All synthetic peptides containing the C-terminal heptapeptide of sorbin were active in the picomolar dose range. Contrary to angiotensin, they had no effect on blood pressure.
