Cells of nonprimate mammals express an abundance of the carbohydrate structure Gal alpha 1-3 Gal beta 1-4 GlcNac-R (termed the alpha-galactosyl epitope). The natural anti-Gal antibody, which interacts specifically with alpha-galactosyl epitopes, is present in high concentrations in all humans. Here, Uri Galili argues that the interaction between anti-Gal in the serum and alpha-galactosyl epitopes on cells of nonprimate grafts may act as an immunological barrier which prevents xenotransplantation.
