The IclR family transcriptional factor is widespread and involves in diverse bacterial physio-pathological events, such as primary and secondary metabolism, virulence, quorum sensing, sporulation. Unlike other transcriptional factors which function as either activators or repressors, IclR can assume both role simutaneously. Its N-terminal domain possesses a helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif which can dimerize or tetramerize to bind target promoters, while the C-terminal domain is for the effector binding. The function of IclR varies with the effectors bound. Escherichia coli transcription factor IclR is the archetype of this family, which regulates the aceBAK operon responsible for the glyoxylate shunt. The sophisticated regulatory mechanisms underlying iclR was largely based on E. coli iclR. Information concerning the pathogen IclR, especially those of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is poor, and is pivotal to our understanding of its biology and development of new effective TB control measures.
