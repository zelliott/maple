The phenotype, T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) usage and specificity of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL), and hybridomas derived from IEL have been examined. In young conventionally reared mice, approximately 50% of the IEL express TCR alpha beta and 50% express TCR gamma delta, although there is considerable variation between individuals. Here we demonstrate that T-cell hybridomas can be prepared from freshly isolated BALB/c mouse IEL. The expressed TCR of these hybridomas reflects the TCR isotype distribution of the IEL population. Analysis of the gamma delta TCR expressed by the hybridomas demonstrates that IEL express a greater number of TCR V gene segments than has been reported for gamma delta T cells in several other epithelial sites. At least five types of gamma delta TCRs are expressed by a panel of BALB/c IEL hybridomas, although use of the gamma delta TCR V gene repertoire clearly is not random. Some TCR gamma delta cells and gamma delta hybridomas have been reported to recognize purified protein derivative (PPD); however, none of the IEL hybridomas secreted IL-2 in response to PPD. These data suggest that most TCR gamma delta IEL are not likely to be PPD reactive.
