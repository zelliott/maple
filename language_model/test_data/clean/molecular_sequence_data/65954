A protist tentatively designated "Pseudoperkinsus tapetis" belonging to the eukaryotic group Ichthyosporea (Mesomycetozoa) was previously isolated from carpet shell clams in Galicia (northwest Spain). In the present study, based on molecular data, a potential P. tapetis specimen was identified from the gill tissues of the mussel Adipicola pacifica associated with whale carcasses (generating chemosynthetic-based ecosystems) collected at shelf depths in the northwest Pacific (southwest Japan). Small subunit ribosomal DNA sequences (1751 sites) of the genotypes of P. tapetis from Spain and Japan were almost identical (only one substitution and one insertion/deletion difference). On the other hand, differences of 10 and 8 substitutions were found in two internal transcribed spacer regions of ribosomal DNA, ITS1 (288 sites) and ITS2 (251 sites) between these two genotypes, respectively, indicating that they are genetically different at the population level. These findings suggest that P. tapetis occurs worldwide and can associate with (and possibly infect) various types of bivalves. Further, a PCR method to specifically detect the P. tapetis cells in the host was also established.
