A full-length cDNA encoding a novel protein was isolated and sequenced from a human placental cDNA library. This cDNA consists of 1990 bp and has a predicted open reading frame encoding 433 amino acids. It possesses an Src homology 3 (SH3) motif, a leucine zipper motif and no catalytic domain, suggesting that it seems to be an adapter protein. PCR-based mapping with both a monochromosomal hybrid panel and radiation hybrid cell panels placed the gene to human chromosome 1q21-22.
