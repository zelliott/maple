Maternal-fetal histocompatibility for alleles at HLA class II loci, HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1, was examined in 40 abortuses and 31 liveborn children of 68 couples with a history of idiopathic recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSAB) who underwent leukocyte immunization prior to the index pregnancy. Significantly more couples with RSAB shared two HLA-DQA1 alleles as compared with fertile control couples (0.18 vs. 0.03, respectively; P = 0.031). There were no differences in HLA sharing between couples with RSAB who experienced a repeat abortion in the index pregnancy as compared with couples with RSAB who were delivered of a liveborn child. Non-significant deficits of abortuses who were compatible for alleles at the HLA-DQA1 (6 observed vs. 8.5 expected; P = 0.225) and the HLA-DQB1 (7 observed vs. 9.2 expected; P = 0.254) loci were observed. A significant deficit of HLA-DQA1 compatible liveborn children was observed (1 observed vs. 5.5 expected; P = 0.0069). The overall deficit of HLA-DQA1 compatible fetuses (7 observed vs. 14.0 expected; P = 0.0018) after approximately 8 weeks gestation suggests that HLA-DQA1 compatible fetuses may be aborted early in pregnancy, prior to the time when fetal tissue can be recovered for genetic studies.
