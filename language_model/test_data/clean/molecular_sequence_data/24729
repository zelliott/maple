A population study on the short tandem repeat (STR) locus D11S554 was carried out in a sample of 362 unrelated Japanese individuals living in the Gifu Prefecture. A total of 46 different alleles ranging from 180 bp to 340 bp and 135 genotypes were revealed. Sequence analysis of alleles was carried out for 185 samples. The sequence structures of the repeat regions of the alleles were found to be complex and the alleles were classified into nine sequence types, including four new sequence types. According to the system of Adams et al. (1993), we designated the new sequence types IA3, IA4, IA5 and IB3, respectively. Out of the 46 different alleles, 11 showed sequence heterogeneity. The results of this study demonstrated that the D11S554 locus is a powerful and useful genetic marker for forensic practice in the Japanese population.
