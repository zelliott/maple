Mapmodulin is a 31-kDa protein that stimulates the microtubule- and dynein-dependent localization of Golgi complexes in semi-intact Chinese hamster ovary cells. We have shown previously that it binds the microtubule binding domains of the microtubule-associated proteins, MAP2, MAP4, and tau. We also showed that mapmodulin is identical to a protein named PHAPI (Vaesen, M., Barnikol-Watanabe, S. , GÃ¶tz, H., Awni, L.A., Cole, T., Zimmermann, B., Kratzin, H.D. and Hilschmann, N. (1994) Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler 375, 113-126). We report here that mapmodulin is a phosphoprotein that is predominantly cytosolic but is also found peripherally associated with endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membranes in mammalian cells. The protein occurs as a trimer in cytosol, and phosphorylation is required for its microtubule-associated protein-binding activity. Heat treatment of nonphosphorylated mapmodulin can render it competent for binding to microtubule-associated proteins, suggesting that phosphorylation induces a conformational change in mapmodulin. Finally, despite identity in polypeptide sequence with a protein reported to act as an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, native mapmodulin was not able to inhibit protein phosphatase 2A in Chinese hamster ovary cell cytosol.
