We have purified a previously unknown glycoprotein (designated gp-340) from human bronchioalveolar lung washings from a patient with alveolar proteinosis. gp-340 was identified by its calcium-dependent binding to lung surfactant protein D (SP-D) and by its molecular mass of 340 kDa in the reduced state on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). gp-340 was purified from the 10,000 x g pellet of the lavage fluid by ion-exchange and gel permeation chromatography. On SDS-PAGE, gp-340 showed an apparent molecular mass of 290 kDa in the unreduced state. On gel chromatography under non-dissociating conditions, the apparent molecular mass of gp-340 was >1000 kDa. The presence of N-linked glycosylation was shown by digestion with N-glycosidase F, which reduced the apparent molecular mass of gp-340 under reducing condition to about 300 kDa. Partial amino acid sequence data showed the presence of scavenger-receptor type domains. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were raised against gp-340, and their specificities were confirmed by Western blotting. The antibodies were used for immunohistochemical localization of gp-340 in the lung, where it was found on the surface of and within alveolar macrophages. Direct binding between gp-340 and SP-D took place at physiological ionic strength, required the presence of calcium, and was not inhibited by maltose. The binding between SP-D and mannan also required the presence of calcium, but this interaction was completely inhibited by maltose. The same binding pattern was seen between gp-340 and recombinant human SP-D composed of the trimeric neck region and three carbohydrate recognition domains. These findings indicate that the binding between gp-340 and SP-D is a protein-protein interaction rather than a lectin-carbohydrate interaction and that the binding to gp-340 takes place via the carbohydrate recognition domain of SP-D. We conclude that gp-340 is a new member of the scavenger-receptor superfamily and likely to be a truncated form of a receptor for SP-D.
