We present a nonlinear dynamical model for DNA thermal denaturation, which is based on the finite stacking enthalpies used in thermodynamical nearest-neighbor calculations. Within this model, the finiteness of stacking enthalpies is shown to be responsible for the sharpness of calculated melting curves. Transfer-integral and molecular dynamics calculations are performed to demonstrate that the proposed model leads to a good agreement with known experimental results for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous DNA.
