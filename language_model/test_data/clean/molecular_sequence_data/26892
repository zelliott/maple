We have employed pramlintide (prAM) as a surrogate for hAM in CD and NMR studies of the conformational preferences of the N-terminal portion of the structure in media which do not provide long-lived monomeric solutions of hAM due to its rapid conversion to preamyloid beta aggregate states. Direct comparison of hAM and prAM could be made under helix-formation-favoring conditions. On the basis of CD and NMR studies: (i) the Cys(2)-Cys(7) loop conformation has a short-span of helix (Ala(5)-Cys(7)); (ii) the extent to which this helix propagates further into the sequence is medium-dependent; a helix from Ala(5) through Ser(20) (with end fraying from His(18) onward) is observed in aqueous fluoroalcohol media; (iii) in 12+ vol.% HFIP, the amyloidogenic region of hAM forms a second helical domain (Phe(23)-Ser(29)); (iv) the two helical regions of hAM do not have any specific geometric relationship as they are connected by a flexible loop that takes different conformations and (v) although the extreme C-terminus is essential for bioactivity, it is found to be extensively randomized with conformer interconversions occurring at a much faster rate than that is observed in the remainder of the peptide sequence. Two NMR-derived structures of the 1-22 sequence fragment of hAM have been derived. The work also serves to illustrate improved methods for the NMR characterization of helices. A detailed quantitative analysis of the NOE intensities observed in aqueous HFIP revealed alternative conformations in the C-terminal portion of the common amylin helix, a region that is known to be involved in the biorecognition phenomena leading to amyloidogenesis. Even though the SNN sequence appears to be a flexible loop, the chemical shifts (and changes induced upon helix structuring) suggest some interactions between the loop and the amyloidogenic segment of hAM that occur on partial helix formation.
