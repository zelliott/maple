Sisyrinchium micranthum is an herb with wide distribution and morphological variation, presenting three known cytotypes (2x, 4x, and 6x), which is naturally occurring from Mexico to Argentina. The development of microsatellite markers for this species is important to provide molecular tools to investigate polyploidy origin, as well as its relationship with phenotypic and genetic variability. •

Nine microsatellite markers were isolated using an enriched genomic library and characterized in a diploid population. Eight markers generated polymorphic loci in 27 plants of a population from southern Brazil. The number of alleles per locus ranged from two to nine, and the observed and expected heterozygosities varied from 0.192 to 0.741 and from 0.370 to 0.884, respectively. •

These species-specific DNA markers may be useful for further investigations of the involved polyploidization process and the population genetics of S. micranthum.
