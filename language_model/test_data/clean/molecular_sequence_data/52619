We have isolated the virus from a fecal pellet in the colon of a BALB/c mouse with X-linked immunodeficiency (xid) housed in a room in which there has recently been an epidemic due to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and designated it as the MHV-TY strain. Sequence analysis of the MHV-TY strain was performed on major structural, spike (S), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), proteins directly from PCR products. The comparison of nucleotide sequences of MHV-TY with other strains investigated so far revealed that all three structural proteins of the TY strain had some unique amino acid sequences among MHV strains which can be used as markers of this strain.
