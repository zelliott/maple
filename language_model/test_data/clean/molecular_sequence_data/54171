3'-Nitrotyrosine (3NT) is a post-translational modification (PTM) of body fluids and tissues that is sustained by chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, two main clinical traits of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Despite this background, protein targets and their differential susceptibility to in vivo nitration remain almost completely unexplored in CKD. This study reports a first investigation of plasma nitroproteome in these patients, carried out by both immunorecognition and LC-MS/MS techniques. Plasma proteins of chronic and end-stage KD patients showed a higher burden of nitration than in healthy controls, but main nitration targets appeared to be the same in these populations. Immunoblotting data showed that uremic albumin is largely represented in the uremic nitroproteome together with fibrinogen chains (A, B and C), transferrin, Î±1-antitrypsin, complement factor D, haptoglobin, and IgG light and heavy chains. However, immunopurification and affinity chromatography experiments demonstrated that the relative content of 3NT on the albumin molecule was very low when compared with that of the remaining plasma proteins. The uremic nitroproteome was investigated using also plasma proteins obtained by in vivo ultrafiltration from patients treated with protein leaking or standard high-flux hemodialyzers. The study of these samples revealed the possibility to selectively remove protein nitration products during hemodialysis. Identification of intramolecular sites of nitration was preliminarily obtained in IgG chains isolated by 2D PAGE and assessed by bidimensional tandem mass spectrometry after chemoselective tagging. Further studies are needed to confirm at the molecular level the presence of nitrated Tyr residues in other proteins tentatively identified as nitration targets in this study and to explore the biological meaning of such a selective modification of plasma proteins by reactive nitrogen species in uremia and dialysis patients.
