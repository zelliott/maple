Although D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) [EC 1.4.3.3] activity in rabbit kidney extract was undetectable, protein immunoreactive toward rabbit anti-pig kidney DAO antiserum and RNAs that hybridized with fragments of human and pig DAO cDNAs were detected distinctly in the rabbit kidney. A cDNA clone, RD22, was isolated from the rabbit kidney cDNA library by hybridization with a fragment of human DAO cDNA. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed a 2,018 nucleotide sequence encoding a protein consisted of 347 amino acids. The number of amino acid residues was identical with those of human and pig DAOs, and the amino acid sequence showed 80 and 83% identity with pig and human DAOs, respectively. RNAs that hybridized with RD22 DNA fragment also existed in rabbit kidney, and their sizes were the same as those of the RNAs detected with the human and pig DAO cDNA fragments. RD22-derived protein was hardly synthesized by an in vitro expression system. However, a cDNA fragment lacking most of the 5'-untranslated region and its mutants containing base changes around the initiation codon did direct protein synthesis. Moreover, the protein derived from the partial cDNA fragment containing a large part of the coding region sequence showed immunoreactivity toward anti-pig DAO antiserum. The results suggest that one of the causes of the very poor synthesis of DAO protein in rabbit kidney is translational suppression in the synthetic process.
