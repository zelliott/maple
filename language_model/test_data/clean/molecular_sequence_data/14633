A matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry-based approach is applied to identify active site domains within influenza neuraminidase that bind the antiviral inhibitors zanamivir (ZANA) and 2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (DANA). Combined data from the tryptic and Glu-C endoproteinase digests of neuraminidase-inhibitor complexes have identified binding peptides that contain the active site residues Arg118, Glu119, Arg156, Glu276, and Tyr406. The binding of these residues was confirmed from the analysis of available X-ray crystal structures. The ability to identify peptides within the active sites of proteins and likely binding residues provides both a rapid and relatively high throughput approach with which to screen protein-drug interactions by MALDI mass spectrometry.
