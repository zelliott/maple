This work describes the purification and characterization of enzymes that exhibit beta-d-xylosidase activity in stem tissues of Arabidopsis. This is the first detailed investigation that concerns the characterization of catalytic properties and sequence identity of enzymes with beta-D-xylosidase activities in a dicotyledonous plant. Three different enzymes, ARAf, XYL4, and XYL1 with apparent molecular masses of 75, 67, and 64 kD, respectively, were purified to homogeneity. ARAf was identified as a putative alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase, and XYL4 and XYL1 as putative beta-D-xylosidases using matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time of flight. ARAf belongs to family 51 and XYL4 and XYL1 to family 3 of glycoside hydrolases. ARAf and XYL1 have highest specificity for p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside and XYL4 for p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside and natural substrates such as xylobiose and xylotetraose. XYL4 was shown to release mainly D-Xyl from oat spelt xylan, rye arabinoxylan, wheat arabinoxylan, and oligoarabinoxylans. ARAf and XYL1 can also release D-Xyl from these substrates but less efficiently than XYL4. Moreover, they can also release L-Ara from arabinoxylans and arabinan. Overall, the results indicate that XYL4 possesses enzymatic specificity characteristic for a beta-D-xylosidase, while ARAf and XYL1 act as bifunctional alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase/beta-D-xylosidases. Analysis of the activity of these three enzymes in stem tissues at different stages of development has shown that young stems possess the highest activities for all three enzymes in comparison to the activities of the enzymes present in stems at older stages of development. High enzyme activities are most likely related to the necessary modifications of cell wall structure occurring during plant growth.
