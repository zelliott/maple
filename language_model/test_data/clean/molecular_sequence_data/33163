The taxonomic position of an actinomycete, designated strain IMMIB L-21(T), was determined using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. The organism, which had phenotypic properties consistent with its classification in the genus Nocardiopsis, formed a distinct clade in the 16S rRNA gene sequence tree together with the type strain of Nocardiopsis composta, but was readily distinguished from this species using DNA-DNA relatedness and phenotypic data. The genotypic and phenotypic data show that the organism represents a novel species of the genus Nocardiopsis, for which the name Nocardiopsis potens sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IMMIB L-21(T) (=DSM 45234(T)=CCUG 56587(T)).
