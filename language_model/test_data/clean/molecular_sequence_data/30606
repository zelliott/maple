A novel interrupted gene motif has been reported in which a 50-nucleotide insertion into bacteriophage T4 gene 60 appears to be present in the message at the time of translation, yet it is not translated. We present here a dynamic model for how translation may be occurring in the neighborhood of the interruption. The model involves formation of an RNA structure with similarities to a Holliday junction, followed by migration of the branch point in a strand exchange between message and interruption. The advantage of this model over previous ones is that at no time is a new tRNA required to pair with a discontinuous template.
