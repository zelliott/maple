NAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) catalyzes the interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and L-glycerol-3-phosphate. Although the enzyme has been characterized and cloned from a number of sources, until now no three-dimensional structure has been determined for this enzyme. Although the utility of this enzyme as a drug target against Leishmania mexicana is yet to be established, the critical role played by GPDH in the long slender bloodstream form of the related kinetoplastid Trypanosoma brucei makes it a viable drug target against sleeping sickness.

The 1.75 A crystal structure of apo GPDH from L. mexicana was determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) techniques, and used to solve the 2.8 A holo structure in complex with NADH. Each 39 kDa subunit of the dimeric enzyme contains a 189-residue N-terminal NAD-binding domain and a 156-residue C-terminal substrate-binding domain. Significant parts of both domains share structural similarity with plant acetohydroxyacid isomeroreductase. The discovery of extra, fatty-acid like, density buried inside the C-terminal domain indicates a possible post-translational modification with an associated biological function.

The crystal structure of GPDH from L. mexicana is the first structure of this enzyme from any source and, in view of the sequence identity of 63%, serves as a valid model for the T. brucei enzyme. The differences between the human and trypanosomal enzymes are extensive, with only 29% sequence identity between the parasite and host enzyme, and support the feasibility of exploiting the NADH-binding site to develop selective inhibitors against trypanosomal GPDH. The structure also offers a plausible explanation for the observed inhibition of the T. brucei enzyme by melarsen oxide, the active form of the trypanocidal drugs melarsoprol and cymelarsan.
