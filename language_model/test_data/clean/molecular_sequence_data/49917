The cystatins are a superfamily of cysteine protease inhibitors. Several genes including Cres (cystatin-related epididymal spermatogenic), testatin, and cystatin T, have been identified that are related to the family 2 cystatins but lack critical consensus sites important for cysteine protease inhibition. In addition, these genes are primarily expressed in the reproductive tract suggesting they may have evolved to perform tissue-specific functions distinct from that of the typical cystatins. This review describes the CRES subgroup within the family 2 cystatins including potential new members and their putative functions in the reproductive tract.
