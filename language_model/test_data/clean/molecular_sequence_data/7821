DNA recognition is a critical property of many transcription factors, some of which play important roles in human disease. Disruption of this recognition may profoundly influence the biology of these factors. One such factor, the Myc oncoprotein, utilizes a basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper motif to recognize the DNA target CACGTG. As discussed here, this recognition appears to occur through recognition by one face of a basic region alpha helix utilizing amino acid side chains highly conserved among CACGTG binding proteins. This basic domain alpha helix, however, requires DNA binding for stabilization. To circumvent this energetic requirement, analogues were produced that introduce multiple alanines, displaying substantially increased spontaneous alpha helicity and significantly enhanced DNA affinity. These studies simplify our understanding of the structural constraints for DNA recognition by this family and may serve as a template for the design of small molecule transcription-targeted therapeutics.
