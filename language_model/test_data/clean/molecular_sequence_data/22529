Self-compatible S-54 homozygotic plants were found in progenies of an F(1) hybrid cultivar in Chinese cabbage. Pollination tests revealed that this self-compatibility is controlled by the S locus and caused by the loss of the recognition function of the stigma. SRK, the gene for the recognition molecule in the stigma, was normally transcribed and translated in the self-compatible plants. The 1034-bp region in the receptor domain of SRK in the self-compatible plants was 100% identical to SLG in S-54, while that in self-incompatible S-54 homozygotic plants was 95.1% identical. These results suggest that the self-compatibility of the S-54 homozygotes is due to amino-acid changes caused by gene conversion from SLG to SRK.
