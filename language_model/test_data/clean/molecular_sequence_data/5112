The conversion of C19 steroids to estrogens is catalysed by aromatase P450 (P450arom; product of the CYP19 gene). Tissue sites of expression include the gonads and brain; however, in a small subset of mammals, P450arom is also expressed in the placenta. In humans, gonadal expression employs a promoter proximal to the start site of translation, whereas expression in the placenta relies on a promoter which is distal to this site. We characterized the bovine CYP19 gene in both the ovary (OV) and placenta (PL), to determine if this method of regulation of tissue-specific expression is employed in other species. Both bovine and human species express P450arom in these tissues, however, the pattern of expression is very different. In both humans and cattle, P450arom is expressed in the granulosa cells of the ovary, however, after ovulation only the luteinized granulosa cells of the human continue to express P450arom. There is a high degree of sequence identity (>70%) shared between humans and cattle in the OV-specific 5'-flanking DNA, whereas little identity (<40%) was found between humans and cattle in the PL-specific DNA. Promoters and 5'-flanking regions of human and bovine CYP19 genes were subcloned into a luciferase (LUC) vector. Bovine PL-specific constructs transfected into JEG-3 human choriocarcinoma cells failed to express LUC activity. When OV-specific constructs were transfected into luteinized bovine granulosa cells, there was no change in LUC activity in cells transfected with the bovine constructs after treatment with forskolin, whereas all of the corresponding human constructs expressed LUC activity. The bovine 5'-flanking DNA lacks a cAMP-responsive element-like sequence (CLS) critical for cAMP-stimulated transcription of P450arom in the human ovary. With the absence of this CLS sequence in the bovine gene, there appears to be little enhancement of transcription by cAMP in the portion of the 5'-flanking region studied so far. When the analogous region of the bovine promoter was mutated to the human CLS, only a partial restoration of LUC activity was observed. An additional element therefore appears to be important in preventing the full expression of the bovine CYP19 gene in luteinized granulosa cells.
