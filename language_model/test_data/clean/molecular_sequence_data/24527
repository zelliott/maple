Reelin is a protein involved in the organization of the developing brain of vertebrates. Reelin is divided into three parts, a F-spondin-like domain, a region including the epitopes of the monoclonal and polyclonal anti-Reelin antibodies, and eight-fold Reelin repeats. Reelin repeats consists of a subrepeat A, an EGF-like domain, and a subrepeat B. We found that the anti-Reelin antibodies' recognition region consists of three repetitive units. The correspondence of the repetitive units with the antigenicity is discussed.
