The mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was evaluated in colorectal adenocarcinomas and adjacent noncancerous colorectal tissues in 18 Japanese patients. The expression was confirmed to be up-regulated in the colorectal adenocarcinomas, when compared with the noncancerous tissues. Twelve genotypes of VEGF: six positions in the promoter region, two in the 5'UTR, and four in the 3'UTR, and their association with the expression of VEGF mRNA were evaluated. While G-1877A, T-1455C, G-1154A, C702T, and G1612A were not detected, C-2578A, T-1498C, G-1190A, C-634G, C-7T, C936T, and C1451T were found at allele frequencies of 4/36, 15/36, 15/36, 20/36, 8/36, 6/36, and 6/36, respectively, suggesting that C-2578A, G-1154A, and G1612A were associated with a decreased risk for colorectal adenocarcinoma. T-1498C (G-1190A) and C-7T were found to be associated with higher levels of VEGF mRNA, and may be a risk factor for the development of liver metastasis and/or prognosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma.
