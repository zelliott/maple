The results of 16S rRNA, gyrB and catA gene sequence comparisons and reasserted DNA-DNA hybridization unambiguously proved that Rhodococcus jialingiae Wang et al. 2010 and Rhodococcus qingshengii Xu et al. 2007 represent a single species. On the basis of priority R. jialingiae must be considered a later synonym of R. qingshengii.
