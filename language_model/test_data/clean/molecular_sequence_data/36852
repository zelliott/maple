Two glycopeptide fractions prepared from mistletoe (Viscum album) lectin I by Pronase digestion were fractioned by affinity chromatography on a concanavalin A-Sepharose column. With 400-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy, in conjunction with sugar analysis, the following oligosaccharide structures could be determined: two oligomannose-type glycans in the ratio 4:1, one containing six mannose and the other containing five mannose units, both with two 2-acetamido-2-deoxyglucose units. In addition, a mannotriosyl-->N,N'-diacetylchitobiose glycan containing a xylosyl group and an alpha-fucosyl group (1-->3)-linked to the 2-acetamido-2-deoxyglycosyl-1 residue, a common core element of many plant glycoproteins, was also observed.
