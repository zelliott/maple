The aim of a large number of studies on G protein-coupled receptors was centered on understanding the structural basis of their main functional properties. Here, we will briefly review the results obtained on the alpha1-adrenergic receptor subtypes belonging to the rhodopsin-like family of receptors. These findings contribute, on the one hand, to further understand the molecular basis of adrenergic transmission and, on the other, to provide some generalities on the structure-functional relationship of G protein-coupled receptors.
