Regulation and evolution of dinoflagellate luciferases are of particular interest since the enzyme is structurally unique and bioluminescence is under circadian control. In this study, three new members of the dinoflagellate luciferase gene family were identified and characterized from Pyrocystis lunula. These genes, lcfA, lcfB, and lcfC, also exhibit the unusual structure and organization previously reported for the luciferase gene of a related dinoflagellate, Lingulodinium polyedrum: three repeated domains, each encoding an active catalytic site, multiple gene copies, and tandem organization. The histidine residues involved in the pH regulation of L. polyedrum luciferase activity, and implicated in the regulation of flashing, are also fully conserved in P. lunula. The interspecific conservation between the individual luciferase domains of P. lunula and L. polyedrum is higher than among domains intramolecularly, indicating that this unique gene structure arose through duplication events that occurred prior to the divergence of these dinoflagellates. However, P. lunula luciferase genes differ from L. polyedrum in several respects, notably, the occurrence of an intron in one gene (lcfC), a 2.25-kb intergenic region connecting lcfA and lcfB, and, of particular interest, an invariant rate of synonymous (silent) substitutions along the repeat domains, in contrast to L. polyedrum luciferase, where the occurrence of synonymous substitutions is practically absent in the central region of the domains.
