Sugar transporters from one group of the major facilitator superfamily of membrane transporters. A conserved common central pore structure lies at the heart of these transporters and diverse functionality is brought about by alterations to this pore or regions associated with it. Recent mutagenesis studies of sugar transporters within the framework of tenable models for the distantly related lactose permease argue that this model is a good paradigm for other members of the major facilitator superfamily.
