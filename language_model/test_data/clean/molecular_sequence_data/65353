Glycoproteins can be cleared from circulation if they carry oligosaccharide structures that are recognized by specific receptors. High-mannose type and asialo complex oligosaccharides are cleared by the mannose and asialoglycoprotein receptors, respectively. This paper presents the protein and terminal saccharide characterization for nine batches of a glycoprotein developed for pharmaceutical use. Each of these batches was evaluated in human pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, and had similar terminal elimination half-lives, but the initial clearance of this glycoprotein varied between batches. The protein is lenercept, an immunoadhesin comprising the Fc domain of human IgG1 and two tumor necrosis factor (TNF) binding domains derived from the extracellular portion of the TNFR1(p55). Lenercept is manufactured in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and is extensively N-glycosylated but is devoid of high-mannose glycans. The pharmacokinetic variability between these lots only correlated with terminal N-acetylglucosamine and not with terminal galactose, sialic acid or any polypeptide related parameter. The data emphasize the need for appropriate analytical methods for the characterization of glycoproteins, especially those designed for long half-lives, and show that assessment of the content of all three terminal saccharides is sufficient to ensure consistency of their PK performance properties.
