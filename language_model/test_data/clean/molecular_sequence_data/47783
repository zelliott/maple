Low-temperature adaptation and cryoprotection were studied in the thermophilic lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ302. S. thermophilus actively adapts to freezing during a pretreatment at 20 degrees C, resulting in an approximately 1, 000-fold increased survival after four freeze-thaw cycles compared to mid-exponential-phase cells grown at an optimal temperature of 42 degrees C. No adaptation is observed when cells are exposed to a temperature (10 degrees C) below the minimal growth temperature of the strain (just below 15 degrees C). By two-dimensional gel electrophoresis several 7-kDa cold-induced proteins were identified, which are the major induced proteins after a shift to 20 degrees C. These cold shock proteins were maximally expressed at 20 degrees C, while the induction level was low after cold shock to 10 degrees C. To confirm the presence of csp genes in S. thermophilus, a PCR strategy was used which yielded products of different sizes. Sequence analysis revealed csp-like sequences that were up to 95% identical to those of csp genes of S. thermophilus ST1-1, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Lactococcus lactis. Northern blot analysis revealed a seven- to ninefold induction of csp mRNA after a temperature shift to 20 degrees C, showing that this thermophilic bacterium indeed contains at least one cold-inducible csp gene and that its regulation takes place at the transcriptional level.
