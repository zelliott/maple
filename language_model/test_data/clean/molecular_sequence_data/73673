The expression of fast myosin heavy chain (MyHC) genes was examined in vivo during fast skeletal muscle development in the inbred White Leghorn chicken (line 03) and in adult muscles from the genetically related dystrophic White Leghorn chicken (line 433). RNA dotblot and northern hybridization was employed to monitor MyHC transcript levels utilizing specific oligonucleotide probes. The developmental pattern of MyHC gene expression in the pectoralis major (PM) and the gastrocnemius muscles was similar during embryonic development with three embryonic MyHC isoform genes, Cemb1, Cemb2, and Cemb3, sequentially expressed. Following hatching, MyHC expression patterns in each muscle differed. The expression of MyHC genes was also studied in muscle cell cultures derived from 12-day embryonic pectoralis muscles. In vitro, Cvent, Cemb1, and Cemb2 MyHC genes were expressed; however, little if any Cemb3 MyHC gene expression could be detected, even though Cemb3 was the predominant MyHC gene expressed during late embryonic development in vivo. In most adult muscles other than the PM and anterior latissimus dorsi (ALD), the Cemb3 MyHC gene was the major adult MyHC isoform. In addition, two general patterns of expression were identified in fast muscle. The fast muscles of the leg expressed neonatal (Cneo) and Cemb3 MyHC genes, while other fast muscles expressed adult (Cadult) and Cemb3 MyHC genes. MyHC gene expression in adult dystrophic muscles was found to reflect the expression patterns found in corresponding normal muscles during the neonatal or early post-hatch developmental period, providing additional evidence that avian muscular dystrophy inhibits muscle maturation.
