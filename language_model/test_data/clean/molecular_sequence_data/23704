We report the analysis of a variant case of thrombasthenic phenotype that is a compound heterozygote for two mutations located within the metal ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) of the beta3 subunit. The patient inherited a maternal allele carrying the Met124Val substitution and a paternal allele that changes Asp119 to Tyr. Phenotyping of the human platelet antigen 1 (HPA-1) showed that the platelet alphaIIbbeta3 complex in the patient was mostly accounted for by the Asp 119Tyr allele that does not bind to fibrinogen (Fg). The patient showed agonistinduced binding of platelets to Fg but neither binding to PAC-1 nor cell aggregation could be detected, most likely due to the minute expression (< or = 5%) of alphaIIb(124Val)beta3 receptors. CHO cells expressing (124Val)beta3 showed a diminished surface expression of alphaIIbbeta3, enhanced adhesion to immobilized Fg, and spontaneous aggregation in the presence of soluble Fg, suggesting that (124Val)beta3 may confer constitutive activity to the alphaIIb(124Val)beta3 receptors. A distinct feature of these cells is the failure of DTT to enhance the binding to soluble Fg and the formation of cell aggregates. The substitution of (124Met)beta3 by either a polar or a positively charged amino acid restored the surface exposure and function of the alphaIIbbeta3 receptors whereas a negatively charged residue did not.
