Two new HLA class I alleles have been recognised by molecular-based typing. B*3805 was initially identified by polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) and afterwards confirmed by sequencing based typing (SBT) studies in a Spanish Caucasian blood cord unit. A unique nucleotide change throughout exons 2, 3 and 4, leading to the amino acid replacement Ser11Ala, differentiates B*3801 and *3805. This position behaves as a dimorphic residue in HLA-B and -C loci, and seems to be structurally unrelated to peptide and TcR recognition. Cw*0408 was first detected by SBT in two African American bone marrow donors in combination with its most structurally related allele, Cw*04011. The single amino acid change found between Cw*04011 and Cw*0408 was Thr163Leu, a residue involved in pocket A of the peptide-binding cleft. This new allele could be the result of a gene conversion event between Cw*04011 and any of the Cw*03 alleles.
