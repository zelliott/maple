Adipose tissue plays a critical role in metabolism, storage, and release of fatty acids in mammals. Construction of a full-length cDNA library is an effective way to understand the functional expression of genes in adipose tissue, and in addition, novel genes for further research can be found in the library. In this study, adipose tissue RNA was extracted from three 18-mo-old Lee-Sung pigs. The mRNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, and used to construct a cDNA library. After transformation, 2,880 clones were selected and sequenced. Cluster analysis was performed, and the assembled contig of each cluster was subjected to search against DNA sequences in the nucleotide databases (NCBINR/TIGRGI). These sequences were clustered into 1,527 unique sequences; 80% of the sequences were categorized as known genes, and 20% of the sequences were categorized as unknown genes. In this adipose tissue cDNA library, approximately 16% of the genes contained full-length sequences with start and stop codons. Gene ontology analysis was performed to indicate the possible functions of these genes. Genes associated with mitochondrial function were abundant and represented 10% of the total. Several fatty acid transport genes and stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase were among the most abundant genes expressed. Tissue distribution of several abundant genes was analyzed by northern analysis, and many of these genes were transcribed in porcine adipose tissue in high copy number. Our full-length sequence data and tissue distribution data can be used to decipher the functional roles exhibited by the adipocyte under various perturbations via endocrine, environmental, genetic, nutritional, pharmacological, or physiological manipulations.
