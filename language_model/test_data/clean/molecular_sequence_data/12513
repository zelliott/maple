The Chlamydomonas FLA10 gene was shown to encode a flagellar kinesin-like protein (Walther, Z., M. Vashishtha, and J.L. Hall. 1994. J. Cell Biol. 126:175-188). By using a temperature-sensitive allele of FLA10, we have determined that the FLA10 protein is necessary for both the bidirectional movement of polystyrene beads on the flagellar membrane and intraflagellar transport (IFT), the bidirectional movement of granule-like particles beneath the flagellar membrane (Kozminski, K.G., K.A. Johnson, P. Forscher, and J.L. Rosenbaum. 1993. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA). 90:5519-5523). In addition, we have correlated the presence and position of the IFT particles visualized by light microscopy with that of the electron dense complexes (rafts) observed beneath the flagellar membrane by electron microscopy. A role for FLA10 in submembranous or flagellar surface motility is also strongly supported by the immunolocalization of FLA10 to the region between the axonemal outer doublet microtubules and the flagellar membrane.
