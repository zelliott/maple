In order to study the role of N-terminal substitutions of peptide sequences related to the active site of alpha-melanotropin, [Glp5]alpha-MSH(5-10), [Glp5,D-Phe7]alpha-MSH(5-10), [Sar5,D-Phe7]alpha-MSH(5-10), [Nle4,D-Phe7]alpha-MSH(4-10), [N-carbamoyl]alpha-MSH(5-10), and formyl and acetyl derivatives of alpha-MSH(5-10), [Gly5]alpha-MSH(5-10) and [Gly5,D-Phe7]alpha-MSH(5-10), were synthesized in solution. The N-terminal acylations enhance by 2 to 10 times the melanin-dispersing activity of the unsubstituted sequences. Alkylation of the N-terminus does not change the biological activity of the parent peptide, suggesting the necessity of a carbonyl group for increasing the hormonal effect.
