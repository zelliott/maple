Natriuretic peptides (NPs) have diversified from a single NP in cyclostomes and elasmobranchs to multiple NPs in ray-finned fishes where ANP, BNP, VNP, and/or up to four CNPs (CNP-1, 2, 3, and/or 4) have been identified. To trace the evolutionary diversification of NPs in fishes, we analyzed the bichir (Polypterus endlicheri), believed to be the most primitive extant ray-finned fish, for the presence of any NPs by a PCR-based method using primers that amplify all NP cDNAs identified to date. We have cloned cDNAs encoding ANP, BNP, VNP from the heart and three CNPs (CNP-1, 3, and 4) from the brain. An extensive search for CNP-2 from the brain was not successful. The C-terminus of bichir ANP presented an amidation signal as in ray-finned fish ANP. The bichir BNP mRNA had AUUUA repeats in the 3'-untranslated region as observed in all BNP cDNAs of vertebrates. The bichir VNP had a long C-terminal 'tail' sequence extending from the intramolecular ring as does teleost VNP. The three bichir CNPs are structurally similar to each teleost counterpart and are grouped after molecular phylogenetic analyses. ANP was most abundantly expressed in the atrium, BNP in the ventricle, and VNP was expressed in both atrium and ventricle. The three CNPs are most abundantly expressed in the brain, and CNP-4 transcripts were found in small amounts in the ventricle and kidney. Taken together, it is clear that all major NPs exist prior to the whole genome duplication that occurred in the teleost lineage. Furthermore, this is the first observation that CNP-3, ANP, BNP, and VNP, whose genes are colocalized in the same chromosome, coexist in a single fish species including teleosts, thereby confirming that CNP-3 is not an ortholog of VNP, and that ANP, BNP, and VNP genes were generated by tandem duplication from the CNP-3 gene.
