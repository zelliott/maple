Sphingobium japonicum strain UT26 utilizes γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH), a man-made chlorinated pesticide that causes serious environmental problems due to its toxicity and long persistence, as a sole source of carbon and energy. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of UT26, which consists of two chromosomes and three plasmids. The 15 lin genes involved in γ-HCH degradation are dispersed on the two chromosomes and one of the three plasmids.
