A cDNA clone encoding an HMG1 protein from Pharbitis nil was characterized with regard to its sequence, genomic organization and regulation in response to photoperiodic treatments that control floral induction. The HMG1 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 432 nucleotides encoding a 144 amino acid protein of approximately 16 kDa. The predicted polypeptide has the characteristic conserved motifs of the HMG1 and HMG2 class of proteins including an N-terminal basic region, one of two HMG-box domains, and a polyacidic carboxy terminus. Within the HMG-box region, Pharbitis HMG1 deduced amino acid sequence shares 47%, 67% and 69% identity with its animal, maize, and soybean counterparts, respectively. Southern blot hybridization analysis suggests that HMG1 is a member of a multigene family. Analysis of mRNA abundance indicates that the HMG1 gene is expressed to higher levels in dark-grown tissue, such as roots, and at lower levels in light-grown tissue, such as cotyledons and stems. Following the transition to darkness, the levels of HMG1 mRNA in cotyledons were initially stable, however, after a lag time of 8 h or more, HMG1 mRNA increased in abundance to a peak level at 20 h. A second peak in mRNA levels was observed about 24 h later, indicating that the expression of the HMG1 gene is regulated by an endogenous circadian rhythm. Abundance of the HMG1 mRNA during a dark period was dramatically affected by brief light exposure (night break), a treatment which inhibits floral induction. These data indicate that the expression of HMG1 is regulated by both an endogenous rhythm and the light/dark cycle and are consistent with a role for HMG1 in maintaining patterns of circadian-regulated gene expression activated upon the transition from light to darkness.
