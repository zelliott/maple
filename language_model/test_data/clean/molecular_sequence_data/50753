A total of 807 gram-negative clinical isolates were treated with five different probes: intragenic segments for the transposase gene tnpA; the resolvase gene tnpR; the modulator of the resolvase, tnpM; the integraselike factor gene tnpI; and a 20-mer oligonucleotide for the recombinational site of action for the integrase. A total of 8% of the isolates hybridized with all five Tn21-related probes, and another 11% represented transposons in which one or more of the tested genes were missing. This 11% included groups whose descriptions have been published as well as groups that have not yet been described. The not-yet-described groups include various deletion products and some precursor structures, as is predicted for the evolution of Tn21-like transposons. The integration system appears to be coupled with Tn21-like structures and yet independent from these structures, implying an independent evolution of this system from Tn21-like transposons. The structures were found with similar incidence levels in all species tested except Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for which a novel separate family of class II transposons has been described before.
