SAG101, a leaf senescence-associated gene, was cloned from an Arabidopsis leaf senescence enhancer trap line and functionally characterized. Reporter gene and RNA gel blot analyses revealed that SAG101 was not expressed until the onset of senescence in leaves. A recombinant SAG101 fusion protein overexpressed in Escherichia coli displayed acyl hydrolase activity. Antisense RNA interference in transgenic plants delayed the onset of leaf senescence for approximately 4 days. Chemically induced overexpression of SAG101 caused precocious senescence in both attached and detached leaves of transgenic Arabidopsis plants. These data suggest that SAG101 plays a significant role in leaf senescence.
