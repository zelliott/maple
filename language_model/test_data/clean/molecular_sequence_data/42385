A diverse group of DNA-binding regulatory proteins share a common structural domain which is homologous to the sequence of a highly conserved and abundant chromosomal protein, HMG-1. Proteins containing this HMG-1 box regulate various cellular functions involving DNA binding, suggesting that the target DNA sequences share a common structural element. Members of this protein family exhibit a dual DNA-binding specificity: each recognizes a unique sequence as well as a common DNA conformation. The highly conserved HMG-1/-2 proteins may modulate the binding of other HMG-1 box proteins to bent DNA. We examine the structural and functional relationships between the proteins, identify their signature and describe common features of their target DNA elements.
