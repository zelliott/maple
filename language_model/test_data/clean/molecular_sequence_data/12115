Bovine lung endothelin-B receptor has been isolated in good yield with a new procedure involving the use of endothelin-1 coupled to iminobiotin with a long spacer and avidin-agarose affinity chromatography. Contrary to previous reports, evidence has been obtained that the native form of this receptor corresponds to the full-length transcript expected on the basis of cDNA clones. The binding of endothelin to a variety of shortened fragments of the full receptor suggests that the long N-terminal sequence of this receptor has very little influence on the binding of endothelin and that the main determinants of the endothelin binding site might be constituted by residues in the sixth, and possibly the seventh, transmembrane helices.
