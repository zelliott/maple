Various peptides related to N-terminal portion of fibrin alpha-chain were synthesized by the solution method and the solid-phase method, and their inhibitory effect on fibrinogen/thrombin clotting was examined. Extension of peptide chain from N-terminal tripeptide decreased the inhibitory effect. The most potent effect was shown by N-terminal decapeptide analog, H-Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro-Pro-Glu-Arg-His-Gln-Ser-NH2.
