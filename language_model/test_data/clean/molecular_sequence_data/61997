AML1 is among the most frequent targets of chromosomal rearrangements in human leukemias. We report here the molecular analysis of a t(4;21)(q28;q22) that has disrupted AML1 in a patient with de novo T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. By using 3'-RACE analysis, we show that this rearrangement results in the fusion of a novel gene immediately downstream of exon 5 or exon 6 of AML1, indicating that the AML1 breakpoint lies in intron 6 and that alternative fusion splice variants are generated. The sequence of the novel gene, located at 4q28, does not have any significant homology with any of the known genes in the human GenBank DNA database. However, the first 118 bases are identical to a part of a human ovarian EST. Also, its high homology with mouse and rat sequences suggests that this sequence most probably represents a part of a novel gene, which we named FGA7 (Fused Gene 7 to AML1). Following the AML1 open reading frame, the FGA7 sequence encodes an unknown protein of 27 amino acids. We isolated three bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones that contain the FGA7 sequence and confirmed the breakpoint of the gene on the patient's metaphase spreads by fluorescence in situ hybridization using these BACs as probes. RT-PCR and Northern blot analyses revealed that FGA7 is expressed in ovarian and skeletal muscle tissues. The predicted AML1-FGA7 chimeric proteins contained a limited number of residues fused to AML1 in a situation similar to that reported for the AML1-EAP fusion that is a product of t(3;21). It is possible that the expression of a constitutively shortened AML1 could compete with full-length AML1 and act as a dominant negative inhibitor of the promoters that the core binding factor activates.
