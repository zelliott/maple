Substances which regulate expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) were examined in embryonic rat hippocampal cultures containing both neurons and glial cells. Both cell types expressed NGF mRNA when cultivated in vitro. Lipopolysaccharide, an activator of macrophages, elicited a significant increase in NGF mRNA. Interleukin-1 beta evoked a similar increase in NGF mRNA which was accompanied by a rise in NGF protein. The Il-1-induced increase was partially blocked by indomethacin, suggesting that prostaglandins might mediate this effect. Treatment of the cultures directly with prostaglandin E2 resulted in elevated levels of both NGF mRNA and protein. Thus, agents which promote inflammatory activity appear to increase NGF expression. Moreover, a suppressor of inflammation, dexamethasone, decreased NGF expression. Our observations indicate that a variety of immunomodulators regulate NGF expression in the hippocampus.
