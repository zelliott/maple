The 16S rRNA gene of Alteromonas distincta KMM 638T was amplified, cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence was aligned with sequences of representative strains of Alteromonas, Moritella, Pseudoalteromonas and Shewanella. Results of phylogenetic analysis, using neighbour-joining and Fitch-Margoliash methods, clearly indicated that this species should be assigned to the genus Pseudoalteromonas. On the basis of polyphasic data obtained from previous work and this study, it is proposed that the species Alteromonas distincta be reclassified as Pseudoalteromonas distincta comb. nov. with type strain KMM 638T (= ATCC 700518T).
