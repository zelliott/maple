Purification of oligonucleotides by HPLC is limited by association between failure sequences and full-length oligonucleotide. We describe a protocol for denaturing purification of 5'-dimethoxytritylated oligonucleotides that ensures that separation of tritylated and non-tritylated species will not be complicated by strand association. Fully denaturing conditions are produced by the use of tetraethylammonium hydroxide, which is a basic reagent with ion-pairing properties similar to triethylammonium acetate. The method also includes two other convenient features: a) the option of loading the crude oligonucleotide without removing concentrated ammonium hydroxide and b) detritylation on the column with separation of dimethoxytrityl alcohol.
