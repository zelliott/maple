A single nucleotide polymorphism that results in substitution at residue 700 of a serine (Ser-700) for an asparagine (Asn-700) in thrombospondin-1 is associated with familial premature coronary artery disease. The polymorphism is located in the first of 13 Ca2+ -binding motifs, within a consensus sequence in which Asn-700 likely coordinates Ca2+. Equilibrium dialysis of constructs comprised of the adjoining epidermal growth factor-like module and the Ca2+ -binding region (E3Ca) demonstrated that E3Ca Ser-700 binds significantly less Ca2+ than E3Ca Asn-700 at low [Ca2+]. The hypothesis that this difference is due to loss of a binding site in Ser-700 protein was tested with truncations of E3Ca containing four (Tr4), three (Tr3), two (Tr2), or one (Tr1) N-terminal Ca2+ -binding motifs. The Ser-700 truncation constructs bound 1 fewer Ca2+ than matching Asn-700 constructs and exhibited decreased binding affinities. Intrinsic fluorescence of a tryptophan at residue 698 (Trp-698) in the most N-terminal motif was cooperatively quenched by the addition of Ca2+ to Asn-700 Tr2, Tr3, and Tr4 constructs. In Ser-700 constructs, quenching of Trp-698 was incomplete in the Tr2 and Tr3 constructs and complete only in the Tr4 construct. Ca2+ -induced quenching of Ser-700 constructs required higher [Ca2+] and was slower as shown in stopped-flow experiments than quenching of Asn-700 constructs. Such differences were not found with Tb3+, which quenched the fluorescence of Asn-700 and Ser-700 constructs equivalently. Thus, the Ser-700 polymorphism alters a rapidly filled, high affinity Ca2+ -binding site in the first Ca2+ -binding motif. Slower Ca2+ binding to adjoining motifs partly compensates for the change.
