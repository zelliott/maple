A region of DNA 6 kb downstream of the hydrogenase (H2ase) structural genes and directly downstream of the hypB gene of Bradyrhizobium japonicum was shown by mutational analysis to be necessary for H2ase synthesis. Sequencing of this region revealed two complete open reading frames, and the 5' fragment of a third ORF. They encode proteins with homologies to the HypF, HypC and the N-terminus of HypD from other H2ase-containing organisms. The hypF of B. japonicum encodes a 753-aa protein with a predicted molecular mass of 80.3 kDa that contains the two zinc-finger motifs characteristic of other HypF proteins. The hypC encodes a 85-aa protein with a predicted molecular mass of 8.4 kDa. The 5' portion of hypD, which encodes the first 35 aa, upon combining with the previously reported C-terminus of HypD, designated HypD' (Van Soom et al. (1993) Mol. Gen. Genet. 239, 235-240) encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 42.4 kDa. Complementation studies on a H2 uptake defective strain of B. japonicum containing a polar mutation in the hyp operon revealed that the products of the hyp F, C, D, E genes are required for H2ase production. Evidence is also presented that the hyp genes are co-transcribed from a large operon together with the downstream genes hupGHIJK, making a polycistronic message of 11 genes.
