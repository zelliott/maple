The oleaginous bacterium Rhodococus opacus strain PD630 serves as a model organism to investigate the metabolism of storage triacylglycerols (TAGs) in bacteria. The key enzyme catalysing the last step of TAG biosynthesis in bacteria is a promiscuous acyltransferase (Atf), exhibiting acyl-CoA acyltransferase activity to both diacylglycerols (DGAT activity) and fatty alcohols (wax ester synthase, WS activity). An 800 bp PCR product was obtained from chromosomal DNA of strain PD630 by using degenerate primers designed from conserved stretches of Atf proteins of Acinetobacter baylyi strain ADP1 and Mycobacterium smegmatis mc(2)155. The atf fragment was used as a probe on a strain PD630 gene library, resulting in the identification of a 3948 bp chromosomal DNA fragment containing the complete atf1 gene. An atf1 disruption mutant of strain PD630 exhibited a TAG-leaky phenotype and accumulated up to 50 % less fatty acids than the wild-type, with significantly reduced oleic acid content when cultivated in the presence of gluconate or oleic acid. Whereas DGAT activity was drastically reduced in comparison to the wild-type, WS activity remained almost unchanged in the mutant. RT-PCR analysis of gluconate-grown cells of strain PD630 showed that there is expression of atf1 under conditions of TAG synthesis. To identify additional Atfs in strain PD630, PCR employing non-degenerate primers deduced from Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 sequence data was used. This yielded nine additional atf-homologous genes exhibiting 88-99 % sequence identity to the corresponding strain RHA1 enzymes. Besides Atf1 only Atf2 exhibited high DGAT and/or WS activity when heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli.
