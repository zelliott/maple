Cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells is regulated by a balance of signals from two kinds of NK receptors, activating receptors and inhibitory receptors. Natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCR) family, which consists of NKp30, NKp44 and NKp46, is a major human activating NK receptor. NKp30 has been mapped to the HLA class III region near tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family loci. We have analyzed the NKp30 gene of healthy Japanese and found two synonymous substitutions in the coding region, c.111G>A and c.156C>T, and also identified two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promotor region, -201G>A and -163G>C. Furthermore, it was confirmed that these polymorphisms of the NKp30 gene show strong linkage disequilibria with each other and with HLA-DRB1 or TNFA polymorphisms. Since susceptibilities to certain diseases were mapped near this region, the NKp30 polymorphisms could be useful genetic markers.
