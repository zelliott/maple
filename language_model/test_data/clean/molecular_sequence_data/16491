To verify the presence of Sapporo-like virus (SLV) in children with diarrhea in Guangzhou.

Stool specimens were collected from children with diarrhea treated in the Department of Pediatrics of Nanfang Hospital in autumn and winter, 2003, and semi-nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed for SLV detection, the positive product of which was sequenced and analyzed in comparison with the SLV sequences documented in GenBank.

Only one positive specimen (CH03354) was found out of the 169 stool specimens collected. Sequence analysis of the capsid gene of this strain showed that it belonged to SLV GI-1 cluster.

SLV exists in Guangzhou and different regions of China may have different genotypes of this virus.
