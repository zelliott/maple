The enzymatic degradation of L-methionine and subsequent formation of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) is believed to be essential for flavor development in cheese. L-methionine-gamma-lyase (MGL) can convert L-methionine to methanethiol (MTL), alpha-ketobutyrate, and ammonia. The mgl gene encoding MGL was cloned from the type strain Brevibacterium linens ATCC 9175 known to produce copious amounts of MTL and related VSCs. The disruption of the mgl gene, achieved in strain ATCC 9175, resulted in a 62% decrease in thiol-producing activity and a 97% decrease in total VSC production in the knockout strain. Our work shows that L-methionine degradation via gamma-elimination is a key step in the formation of VSCs in B. linens.
