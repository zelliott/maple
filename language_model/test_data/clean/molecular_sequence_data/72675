Genomic DNA sequencing in the vicinity of the pstA-1 gene from Mycobacterium tuberculosis allowed us to clone, sequence and identify a gene encoding a 70-kDa protein. The size of the protein was confirmed by in vitro coupled transcription/translation. Its N-terminal domain shows extensive sequence similarity with the catalytic domain of eukaryotic serine/threonine protein kinases, and the protein was therefore called Mbk (mycobacterial protein kinase). The deduced amino acid sequence contains two transmembrane segments, which flank a highly repetitive region, suggesting a receptor-like anchoring. The mbk gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and the gene product (Mbk) was purified as a fusion protein with gluthatione S-transferase. Recombinant Mbk was found to be autophosphorylated on threonine residues and capable of phosphorylating myelin basic proteins from bovine brain and histones from calf thymus on serine residues, both in a manganese-dependent manner. The phosphorylation of myelin basic proteins by Mbk was inhibited by calcium and by staurosporine, a widely used inhibitor of eukaryotic protein serine/threonine kinases. A similar gene was found in Mycobacterium bovis BCG DNA by Southern blot analysis. Its expression was detected in cultures of M. bovis BCG by reverse transcriptase/PCR. Although its biological role is unknown, it is the first serine/threonine protein kinase characterized in Mycobacteria.
