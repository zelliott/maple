Three physically separate incursions of the raccoon strain of rabies have entered Canada, two into eastern Ontario in 1999 and one into New Brunswick in 2000. The course of these epizootics is described. Phylogenetic analysis of the index cases from these two provinces with raccoon rabies viruses representative of this strain in the United States supported the independence of these incursions into Canada via cross-border transmission from the United States. Genetic characterization of 190 isolates from these two Canadian provinces over a 550-bp region of the variable central portion of the viral P gene distinguished 14 variants in Ontario and five in New Brunswick although in both regions the variant represented by the initial case was most commonly encountered. The quasi-species nature of the Ontario virus was analysed using isolates taken at different times during the main outbreak to examine whether viral variation was increasing with time as well as changing in nature. These data provide a framework for study of future incursions of this rabies strain into Canada.
