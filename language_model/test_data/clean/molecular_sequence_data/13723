Proteins expressed specifically in neurons and transported to synaptic terminals are likely to constitute important molecular elements of nervous system function. In an effort to characterize synapse-associated proteins (SAPs) of Drosophila, we have isolated from a hybridoma library several monoclonal antibodies (MABs) that selectively stain synaptic terminals in immunohistochemical preparations. MAB nc46 binds to most but not all synaptic terminals of the Drosophila nervous system, it also recognizes a protein with homologous distribution in other dipteran flies and binds to large parts of fish CNS. In Western blots the antibody labels a Drosophila brain protein of 47 kDa and cross-reacts with brain proteins from several species including insects, fish, mouse and man. From these data we conclude that the corresponding gene has been conserved in evolution at least among diptera. Using MAB nc46 and expression cloning we have identified the 'sap47' gene coding for the 'synapse-associated protein of 47 kDa' of Drosophila melanogaster. Sequence analysis of genomic and cDNA clones reveals the intron-exon structure of the gene and characterizes the complete open reading frames of two alternatively spliced transcripts. The sap47 gene is located in 89A8-B3 on chromosome 3R and codes for two almost identical inferred polypeptides of 347 and 351 amino acids with no significant sequence homology to known proteins.
