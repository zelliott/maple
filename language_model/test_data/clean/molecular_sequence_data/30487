Three PstI DNA fragments of the P22-related Salmonella phage, LP7, have been cloned. They contain sequences recognized as pac signals by the packaging apparatus of P22. One of these fragments corresponds to the P22 DNA fragment carrying gene 3 which comprises the pac signal of phage P22. The product of gene 3, Gp3, is involved in the recognition of pac and the packaging process. Gene 3 of LP7 and most of the adjacent gene 2 have been sequenced. The pac analogous segments of the other two PstI fragments have been narrowed down by subcloning and by transduction of the resulting hybrid plasmids under recombination-defective conditions.
