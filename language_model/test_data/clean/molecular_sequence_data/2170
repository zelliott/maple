Lysogenization by a c1ts variant of coliphage P1, P1c1.100, markedly increased the frequency of reversion of a galT::IS1 mutation. The formation of Gal+ colonies presumably occurs by microhomologous recombination between the 9-base-pair repeats in galT (CGCCGCTAC) generated by the transposition of IS1. The responsible P1 gene, ref, has been cloned and sequenced. ref encodes a 22.8-kilodalton protein and is located near the P1 site-specific recombination function, cre. Expression of ref was repressed by P1 c+. The absence of a distinctive ribosome-binding site is consistent with a poor translation of ref from an expression vector in vivo. Placement of a ribosome-binding site before ref resulted in the extensive synthesis of the Ref protein. Ref stimulated precise excision in recB or himA cells, but not in recA mutants. Ref was active in lexA3 mutants, suggesting that the recombination activity of RecA was directly involved in the reaction. We have constructed a P1c1.100 ref::Tn10 mutant. The absence of Ref did not appear to restrict dramatically the ability of P1 to grow lytically or to form lysogens. Thus, the role of ref in the physiology of P1 remains to be determined.
