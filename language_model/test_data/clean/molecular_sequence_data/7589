Members of the Paramyxoviridae family utilize a variety of different strategies to increase coding capacity within their P cistrons. Translation initiation at alternative 5'-proximal AUG codons is used by measles virus (MV) to express the virus-specific P and C proteins from overlapping reading frames on their mRNAs. Additional species of mRNAs are transcribed from the MV P cistron by the insertion of extra nontemplated G residues at a specific site within the P transcript. Addition of only a single nontemplated G residue results in the expression of the V protein, which contains a unique carboxyl terminus. We have used an Escherichia coli system to express MV P cistron-related mRNAs and proteins. We have found that ribosomal frameshifting on the MV P protein mRNA is capable of generating a previously unrecognized P cistron-encoded protein that we have designated R. Some ribosomes which have initiated translation of the P protein mRNA use the sequence TCC CCG AG (24 nucleotides upstream of the V protein stop codon) to slip into the -1 reading frame, thus translating the sequence as TC CCC GAG. The resulting R protein terminates five codons downstream of the frameshift site at the V protein stop codon. We have gone on to use a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter system to demonstrate that this MV-specific sequence is capable of directing frameshifting during in vivo translation in eukaryotic cells. Analysis of immunoprecipitated proteins from MV-infected cells by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis allowed detection of a protein species consistent with R protein in MV-infected cells. Quantitation of this protein species allowed a rough estimation of frameshift frequency of approximately 1.8%. Significant stimulation of ribosomal frameshift frequency at this locus of the MV P mRNA was mediated by a downstream stimulator element which, although not yet fully defined, appeared to be neither a conventional stem-loop nor an RNA pseudoknot structure.
