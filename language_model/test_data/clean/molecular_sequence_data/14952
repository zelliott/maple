Aberrant Her2/neu expression is associated with the development of epithelial-derived human carcinomas and for this reason it is considered a good target for immunologic intervention. To define methods to circumvent immunologic tolerance and to elicit immunity against the Her2/neu tumor-associated antigen in a suitable animal model, we have isolated the cDNA encoding the rhesus monkey homolog of human Her2/neu (RhErbB2) to construct DNA plasmids and adenoviral vectors for the development of a cancer vaccine against this protein. To further increase the immunogenic potency of these vectors, a synthetic codon-optimized RhErbB2 cDNA (RhErbB2OPT) was constructed and characterized. Genetic vaccination of rhesus monkeys was effective in inducing a response against RhErbB2 in immunized animals; importantly, the elicited immunity was associated with natural RhErbB2 polymorphisms, thus distinguishing responses against "self " and "nonself " epitopes. In particular, the postpriming response recognized mainly nonself epitopes whereas the boosted response cross-reacted with self epitopes. Our findings are particularly relevant in the investigation of the impact of TAA polymorphisms on the efficacy of a cancer vaccine strategy.
