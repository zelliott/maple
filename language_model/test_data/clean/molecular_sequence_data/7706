Glucoamylases from Aspergillus niger and Rhizopus niveus catalyzed condensation of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (dGlc) to yield deoxy-glucooligosaccharides with polymerization degrees of 2-5. The enzymes also gave a small amount of products from 3-deoxy-D-glucose, but no products from 6-deoxy-D-glucose. A. niger alpha-glucosidase also catalyzed condensation of dGlc, while Torula and Saccharomyces alpha-glucosidases had low activity. alpha-1,4-, 1,6-, and 1,3-linked deoxy-glucobioses were isolated and identified as the products of A. niger glucoamylase and A. niger alpha-glucosidase. In the reaction of the glucoamylase, 1,4- and 1,3-linked saccharides decreased with an increase of 1,6-linked one. A. niger alpha-glucosidase produced alpha-1,6-linked disaccharide predominantly during the whole course of the reaction.
