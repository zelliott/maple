Bovine colostrum CMP-NeuAc:Gal beta(-->4)GlcNAc-R alpha(2-->6)-sialyltransferase (alpha 6-sialyltransferase) appears to be capable of catalysing alpha 6-sialylation of the disaccharide GalNAc beta(1-->4)GlcNAc to yield the trisaccharide NeuAc alpha(2-->6)GalNAc beta(1-->4)GlcNAc. This provides an enzymic basis for the occurrence of this sialylated structure on the N-linked glycans of a number of bovine milk glycoproteins. Competition experiments using Gal beta(1-->4)GlcNAc and GalNAc beta(-->4)GlcNAc as acceptors indicate that both substrates are recognized by a single active site on the alpha 6-sialyltransferase. Extrapolation of these results suggests that the NeuAc alpha(2-->6)GalNAc beta(1-->4)GlcNAc structural element occurring on the N-linked glycans of several human glycoproteins are similarly synthesized by the action of a Gal beta(1-->4)GlcNAc-R alpha(2-->6)-sialyltransferase.
