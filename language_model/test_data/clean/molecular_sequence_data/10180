A synthetic peptide representing a measles virus (MV) cytotoxic T cell epitope (CTL) when encapsulated in poly (D,L-lactide co-glycolide) (PLG) 50:50 microparticles induced a strong CTL response after a single intraperitoneal immunization of mice which was greater than that following administration of the peptide in Freund's complete adjuvant. A 100 micrograms dose of encapsulated peptide was shown to be more effective for CTL priming than 50 and 25 micrograms doses. A vaccine formulation prepared by simply mixing empty 50:50 PLG microparticles with the peptide resulted in the induction of CTL responses comparable to those induced by the encapsulated peptide. Moreover, a CTL response against MV-infected target cells was observed. These findings highlight the potential immunostimulatory effect of PLG microparticles for the induction of MV and peptide-specific CTL responses.
