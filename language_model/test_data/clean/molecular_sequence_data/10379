The use of electrospray ionization-quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry for the characterization of linear oligosaccharides and N-linked protein oligosaccharide mixtures is described. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments with orders higher than two offer a number of ways to enhance MS/MS spectra and to derive information not present in MS and MS2 spectra. Three such methods are presented in this paper. (a) Collisional activation of permethylated oligosaccharide molecular ions (MS2) as illustrated by maltoheptaose, produces abundant fragments from glycosidic bond cleavages which indicate composition and sequence, and weak cross-ring cleavage products which denote specific linkages within the oligosaccharide. Through the trapping and further dissociation of these fragments (MSn), cross-ring cleavage products can be confirmed and their relative abundances increased to facilitate interpretation. (b) The mechanisms of formation of two isobaric ions or ions isobaric with another ion's isotope peaks, such as those present in the MS2 spectrum of the ribonuclease B oligosaccharide GlcNAc2-Man5 can be independently established by separate MS3 experiments. (c) Ions in the MS2 spectrum, specific for individual components of an isobaric mixture, can be isolated and characterized by further stages of fragmentation. This is illustrated by two isobaric oligosaccharides from chicken ovalbumin of the composition HexNAc5Hex5. These findings indicate the utility of ion trap mass spectrometry towards the facile determination of oligosaccharide composition, sequence, branching and linkage, providing a wealth of structural information not obtainable by other individual methods of carbohydrate mass spectrometric analysis.
