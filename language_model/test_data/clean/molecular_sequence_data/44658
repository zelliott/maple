An Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA encoding a new RNA-binding protein (RBP37) was cloned from a silique cDNA library. The predicted amino acid sequence corresponds to a RBP containing two RNA recognition motifs (RRM) and a basic domain. An affinity for nucleic acids was confirmed in binding assays using in vitro synthesised AtRBP37 protein. In situ hybridisation experiments on sections of flowers and siliques showed expression only in growing organs: gynoecium, petals, filaments and during early-embryogenesis expression is located in the embryo proper and the suspensor up to late heart stage. Expression is not detected in the embryo during maturation. This results suggests an expression pattern correlated with dividing cells.
