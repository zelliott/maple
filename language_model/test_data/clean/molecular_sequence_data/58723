In this study, we describe the cloning of the mouse homologue of the orphan receptor, RZR/ROR gamma, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, from a mouse muscle cDNA library. The amino acid sequence of mouse ROR gamma (mROR gamma) is highly homologous to that of human ROR gamma, with an overall identity of 88%. Northern blot analysis using RNA from different tissues showed that mROR gamma was found to be highly expressed in skeletal muscle, liver and kidney. Analysis of the ROR gamma-response element using in vitro synthesized ROR gamma revealed that it binds as a monomer to response elements composed of a single core motif GGTCA preceded by a 6 bp AT-rich sequence. The ROR gamma-binding specificity was further defined by mutational analysis of the consensus RORE. ROR gamma was able to activate RORE-dependent transcription of the CAT reporter gene in mouse fibroblast D1 cells. ROR alpha 1 and ROR gamma inhibit the transactivation induced by GAL4(DBD)-ROR gamma in fibroblast D1 cells suggesting that these receptors compete for binding to the same coactivators.
