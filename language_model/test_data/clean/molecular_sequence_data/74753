Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) was recently identified and described as a major novel triglyceride lipase in animals. In this study, we aimed to study the tissue-specific and developmental expression pattern of porcine ATGL (pATGL) and the effect of resveratrol (RES) on expression of pATGL in vitro. The full-length cDNA sequence of pATGL was 1,958 bp (accession no. EF583921), with a 1,458-bp open reading frame encoding a 486-AA protein (the predicted molecular mass of 53.2 kDa, accession no. ABS58651). Comparison of the deduced AA sequence with the bovine, mouse, rat, dog, and human adipose triglyceride lipase showed 87, 84, 83, 81, and 80% similarity, respectively. Furthermore, the pATGL was highly expressed in porcine adipose tissue, to a lesser degree in kidney, heart, and muscle, and least but detectable in brain. In s.c. adipose tissue, pATGL mRNA was low at birth (1 kg of BW) and then increased, reaching a maximal value at 20 kg of BW (approximately 8 wk old; P < 0.01). In peritoneal and omental adipose tissue, the greatest expression of pATGL was observed at 40 kg of BW (approximately 12 wk old). In vitro, exposure of cultured adipocytes to 40 and 80 muM RES for 24 h increased the mRNA levels of pATGL by 95.3% (P < 0.05) and 146.8% (P < 0.01), respectively. Accordingly, lipid accumulation was decreased by 25.7% (P < 0.05) and 60.8% (P < 0.01), respectively. When treated with RES for 48 h, the mRNA levels of pATGL were increased by 104.1% (P < 0.05) and 163.1% (P < 0.01), respectively. As expected, lipid accumulation was decreased by 9.7% (P > 0.05) and 29.0% (P < 0.05), respectively. These results add to our understanding of the role of pATGL in adipose tissue development and as a potential target for regulating fat deposition and meat quality.
