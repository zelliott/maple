Flagellin gene central regions from 111 isolates of Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 obtained from soil during a field release experiment were analysed using a combined PCR/RFLP technique to look for variation. In addition, a 858 bp flagellin gene sequence from the original strain and the last isolate obtained from the release site were compared. There was no variation in flagellin gene sequences indicating that the gene was stable over the period of the release, and that the flagellin gene is a suitable marker for use in the detection of bacteria in release experiments. A comparison of Ps. fluorescens SBW25 flagellin with other sequenced flagellins revealed closest homology to the flagellin of Ps. putida PRS2000.
