The catalysis of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) in Plasmodium falciparum (pfMDH) which involves NAD/NADH coupling is crucial for the parasite's pathogenicity. Primers were designed based on the P. falciparum genome resource, and these facilitated the cloning of a gene coding for pfMDH from a local clinical isolate. The DNA sequence of the cloned gene revealed an open-reading frame that encodes a protein of 313 amino acids. After induction in Escherichia coli BL21, enzyme assays of the expressed pfMDH purified by affinity chromatography exhibited significant enzyme activity of about 50 U/mg, where one unit (U) of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme oxidising 1 microol NADH/min. Based on its phylogenetic status amongst MDHs and lactate dehydrogenases (LDHs), the cloned gene was clearly defined as belonging to the NADH-dependent [LDH-like] MDHs. It is noteworthy that pfMDH harbours unique structural characteristics potentially useful for screening drugs specific for disabling parasitic enzymes.
