A ribonuclease, with an N-terminal sequence exhibiting some homology to ribonuclease from Pleurotus ostreatus (Family Pleurotaceae), has been purified from fruiting bodies of the silver plate mushroom Clitocybe maxima (Family Tricholomataceae). However, there is little resemblance between the N-terminal sequences of ribonucleases from various Pleurotus species, and a lesser extent of resemblance between ribonucleases from C. maxima and Pleurotus tuber-regium. No structural relationship exists between ribonuclease from C. maxima, and those from Volvariella volvacea, Lentinus edodes and Irpex lacteus. The purification protocol involved ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel, ion exchange chromatography on CM-Sepharose, and fast protein liquid chromatography on Superdex 75. The ribonuclease was unadsorbed on DEAE-cellulose and adsorbed on Affi-gel blue gel and CM-Sepharose. It exhibited a molecular mass of 17.5 kDa in both gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It manifested roughly the same ribonucleolytic potency toward poly A and poly G followed by poly U. Its activity toward poly C was, by comparison, meager. The temperature and pH required for its optimal activity were, respectively, 70 degrees C and 6.5-7.0.
