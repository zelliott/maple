Plasma factor XIIIa (A*2) is a regulator in balancing the opposing coagulation and fibrinolytic processes. Its enzymatic activity is to catalyze epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysyl bonds between certain substrate molecules to link them by strong bonds. The primary physiological substrates are crosslinks between the gamma and alpha chains of fibrin that produce gamma-gamma-dimer and alpha-polymer, between alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor (alpha 2-PI) and alpha chains of fibrin, and between fibronectin and fibrin. We have characterized a unique factor XIII antibody that is specific for the middle 54-kDa section of A*2. It does not react with the zymogen (A2) or the inactive intermediate (A'2), and it does not inhibit the active center, as do most patient antibodies to factor XIII. This antibody inhibits the formation of A*2-fibrin complexes. Because of this specificity, the antibody was used to study other substrate interactions. It inhibited formation of fibronectin-factor XIIIa complexes, similarly to fibrin, and there was very little crosslinking of fibronectin to a fibrin clot. However, the amount of alpha 2-PI crosslinked to a fibrin clot was normal. It was concluded that this antibody interferes with exosite binding of fibrin and fibronectin interferes with exosite binding of fibrin and fibronectin in a similar way, while at least one critical exosite binding domain for alpha 2-PI is different from those of the other two substrates. Furthermore, with this antibody, it was shown that both alpha 2-PI-alpha chain crosslinking and alpha-polymer formation are necessary to normalize the rate of fibrinolysis.
