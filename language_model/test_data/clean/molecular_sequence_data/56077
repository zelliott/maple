In yeast, revertants were selected from four respiratory deficient mutants carrying mutations in the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene. Intragenic second site mutations revealed amino acids which are functionally complementary to the original mutated position and may be in topological interaction with it. The results provide additional data in favour of the model proposed for the structure of the binuclear centre in proton-motive oxidases.
