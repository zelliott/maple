Xenopus oocytes possess a highly conserved protein carboxyl methyltransferase postulated to function in the repair or metabolism of age-damaged protein aspartyl residues (O'Connor, C. M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10398-10403). Three hexapeptides of the general sequence Val-Tyr-Pro-isoAsp-X-Ala, in which isoAsp represents an L-isoaspartyl residue and X represents Gly, Ser, or Ala, are methylated with the same order of preference following their microinjection into oocytes as in a purified system containing bovine brain protein carboxyl methyltransferase and S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine. The affinities of the enzyme for the glycyl, seryl, and alanyl variants of the peptides in vitro are 4.25, 3.04, and 1.67 microM, respectively. A nonapeptide of the sequence Lys-Ala-Ser-Ala-isoAsp-Leu-Ala-Lys-Tyr is a higher affinity substrate for the methyltransferase in vitro, characterized by a Km of 0.88 microM, but it is modified to a lesser extent in oocytes, partially because of its reduced stability in cytoplasm. The hexapeptide Val-Tyr-Pro-Asp-Gly-Ala, which contains an aspartyl residue in the usual stereoconfiguration, is not methylated either in vitro or in intact oocytes. Microinjection of any of the four isoaspartyl-containing peptides greatly stimulates total carboxyl methylation in oocytes, with rate increases ranging from 19- to 51-fold after the injection of 30 pmol of peptide. The protein ovalbumin is also modified following its microinjection into oocytes to near its calculated methyl-accepting capacity. Each of the isoaspartyl peptides can act as a competitive inhibitor of ovalbumin methylation both in vitro and in microinjected oocytes. The inhibitory potencies of the peptides parallel their specific methyl-accepting activities. The results demonstrate that the oocyte may be a useful model for studying the significance of protein carboxyl methylation because of the large functional excess of methylation capacity and the fidelity of the reactions compared to those observed in purified systems. This excess capability may have physiological significance when structurally abnormal proteins accumulate as a result of cellular stress and or aging.
