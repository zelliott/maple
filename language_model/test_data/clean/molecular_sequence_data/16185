In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, pseudouridine formation in the middle position of the tRNA(Tyr) anticodon (psi 35) is dependent on the presence of the intron in the tRNA(Tyr) gene (Johnson and Abelson, Nature 302:681-687, 1983). Drosophila melanogaster tRNA(Tyr) genes contain introns of three size classes: 20 or 21 base pairs (bp) (six genes), 48 bp (one gene), and 113 bp (one gene). As in yeast, removal of the intron led to loss of psi 35 in the anticodon when transcription was assayed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. All Drosophila intron sizes supported psi 35 formation. The same results were obtained with the homologous X. laevis tRNA(Tyr) genes containing introns of 12 or 13 bp or with a deleted intron. The introns of yeast (Nishikura and DeRobertis, J. Mol. Biol. 145:405-420, 1981), D. melanogaster, and X. laevis tRNA(Tyr) wild-type genes, while they all supported psi 35 synthesis, did not share any consensus sequences. As discussed, these results, taken together, suggest that for appropriate function the psi 35 enzyme in the X. laevis oocyte needs the presence of an unqualified intron in the tRNA gene and a tRNA(Tyr)-like structure in the unprocessed tRNA precursor.
