Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum is a destructive disease of wheat and barley. It causes economic losses due to reduction in both yield and quality. Although FHB resistance has been well documented and resistant cultivars have been developed to reduce incidence and severity of FHB, there is a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in plant resistance against the infection and spread of F. graminearum. In the current study, 2-dimensional displays of proteins extracted from wheat spikelets infected with F. graminearum were compared with those from spikelets inoculated with sterile H2O. Fifteen protein spots were detected that were either induced (qualitatively different) or upregulated (quantitatively increased) following F. graminearum infection of spikelets of 'Ning7840', a resistant cultivar. These proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS analysis. Proteins with an antioxidant function such as superoxide dismutase, dehydroascorbate reductase, and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) were upregulated or induced 5 d after inoculation with F. graminearum, indicating an oxidative burst of H2O2 inside the tissues infected by FHB. An ascorbate-glutathione cycle is likely involved in reduction of H2O2. Expression of proteins with highest similarity to dehydroascorbate reductase and TaGSTF5 (a glutathione S-transferase) differed following FHB infection in susceptible and resistant cultivars. A 14-3-3 protein homolog was also upregulated in FHB-infected spikelets. In addition, a PR-2 protein (beta-1, 3 glucanase) was upregulated in FHB-infected spikes, which is in accord with a previous study that analyzed transcript accumulation.
