We describe an aromatic alcohol dehydrogenase with properties indicating a novel type of function in the defense response of plants to pathogens. To obtain the enzyme free of contamination with possible isoforms, a parsley (Petroselinum crispum) cDNA comprising the entire coding region of the elicitor-responsive gene, ELI3, was expressed in Escherichia coli. In accord with large amino acid sequence similarities with established cinnamyl and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenases from other plants, the enzyme efficiently reduced various cinnamyl and benzyl aldehydes using NADPH as a co-substrate. Highest substrate affinities were observed for cinnamaldehyde, 4-coumaraldehyde and coniferaldehyde, whereas sinapaldehyde, one of the most efficient substrates of several previously analyzed cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenases and a characteristic precursor molecule of angiosperm lignin, was not converted. A single form of ELI3 mRNA was strongly and rapidly induced in fungal elicitor-treated parsley cells. These results, together with earlier findings that the ELI3 gene is strongly activated both in elicitor-treated parsley cells and at fungal infection sites in parsley leaves, but not in lignifying tissue, suggest a specific role of this enzyme in pathogen defense-related phenylpropanoid metabolism.
