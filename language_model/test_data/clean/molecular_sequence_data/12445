Highly homologous 170-bp sequences were found to be carried in the same orientation by the chromosomes of Bacillus subtilis GSY908 (a 168 derivative), B. subtilis R, and B. subtilis var. natto. These sequences were in 5'- and 3'-flanking regions of a tetracycline-resistance determinant in B. subtilis GSY908 and B. subtilis R.
