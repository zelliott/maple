A heterotrophic bacterial strain AGD 8-3 capable of denitrification under extreme haloalkaline conditions was isolated from soda solonchak soils of the Kulunda steppe (Russia). The strain was classified within the genus Halomonas. According to the results of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, Halomonas axialensis, H. meridiana, and H. aquamarina are most closely related to strain AGD 8-3 (96.6% similarity). Similar to other members of the genus, the strain can grow within a wide range of salinity and pH. The strain was found to be capable of aerobic reduction of chromate and selenite on mineral media at 160 g/l salinity and pH 9.5-10. The relatively low level of phylogenetic similarity and the phenotypic characteristics supported classification of strain AGD 8-3 as a new species Halomonas chromatireducens.
