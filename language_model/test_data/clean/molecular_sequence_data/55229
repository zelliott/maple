West Nile Virus (WNV) protease is a two-component protease, important for the maturation of virus by cleaving the viral ploypeptide into functional proteins. WNV protease contains a Nonstructural (NS) protein 3 possessing the protease active sites and is regulated by a cofactor region containing approximately 40 amino acids from an integral membrane protein, NS2B. Although NS2B was demonstrated to be important for the location of the protease on the membrane, there was no direct evidence to show the interaction between protease (NS3) and membrane. Herein, we investigated the interaction between WNV protease and dodecylphosphocoline (DPC) micelles using NMR spectroscopy. The results showed that amino acids (31-33) from NS3 were important for the interaction with detergent micelles, which was similar to the finding in the study of protease from Dengue virus. This region may serve as an anchoring site to stabilized NS3 protease domain on the membrane.
