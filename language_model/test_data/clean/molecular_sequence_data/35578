It is important to establish the diagnosis of cystic echinococcosis (CE) infection and begin control management. Currently, it is difficult to make an accurate diagnosis of CE without the availability of an accurate test, which requires the use of sensitive and specific antigens. Using recombinant antigens the sensitivity and specificity of the CE serology assays could be improved considerably. Recently, a highly antigenic protein named EPC1was characterized and isolated from an Echinococcus granulosus protoscoleces. The current study was designed to assess the sequences of EPC1 isolated from different intermediate hosts of E. granulosus. In addition, identification of a highly antigenic linear B cell epitope was found within EPC1 antigen candidate. The EPC1 sequence contains coding and non-coding regions and was compared between two predominant strains (G1 and G6) in Iran. Sequence polymorphism was not found in protein coding regions, suggesting that these regions may be useful for identification of protein expression as an antigen. The average antigenic activity for the whole protein is above 1.1, and hydrophobicity below 0 indicates that it is hydrophilic. Structural analysis showed alpha helical regions in amino acids 6-25, 35-44, 52-62, and 72-78. Nine B cell epitope residues were identified out of 67 total residues. The identity of EPC1 sequence in both G1 and G6 genotypes affects the antigenic efficacy of EPC1and suggests the recombinant protein will be useful in serological assays in the regions where the two strains are prevalent.
