We describe a family of repetitive sequences found in viruses infecting the brown alga Feldmannia sp. Previously we have demonstrated that the dsDNA genomes of viruses infecting one Feldmannia sp. isolate exist as two size classes of 160 and 179 kb. Repetitive sequences within these genomes were first demonstrated based on the anomalous hybridization among five BamHI fragments from digested virus DNA. Sequence analysis of one of those fragments, B2.4, revealed the presence of 173-bp direct repeats. The restriction maps of the cross-hybridizing BamHI fragments in the two FsV (Feldmannia sp. virus) genome size classes show that these repeats are not widely dispersed, rather they are confined to a small region of each virus genome. We estimate the number of these repeats in the 179-kb genome to be about 109 and in the 169-kb genome to be about 41. In the 179-kb genome, the repeats are contained within a 22-kb region, about 12% of that virus genome, and in the 160-kb genome the repeats are contained within a 10-kb region, about 6% of the genome. The difference in repeat numbers can account for 62% of the size difference between the two size classes of the FsV genome.
