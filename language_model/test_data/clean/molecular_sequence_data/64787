The carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (pol II) plays an important role in coupling transcription with precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) processing. Efficient capping, splicing, and 3'-end cleavage of pre-mRNA depend on the CTD. Moreover, specific processing factors are known to associate with this structure. The CTD is therefore thought to act as a platform that facilitates the assembly of complexes required for the processing of nascent transcripts. The mammalian CTD contains 52 tandemly repeated heptapeptides with the consensus sequence YSPTSPS. The C-terminal half of the mammalian CTD contains mostly repeats that diverge from this consensus sequence, whereas the N-terminal half contains mostly repeats that match the consensus sequence. Here, we demonstrate that 22 tandem repeats, from either the conserved or divergent halves of the CTD, are sufficient for approximate wild-type levels of transcription, splicing, and 3'-end cleavage of two different pre-mRNAs, one containing a constitutively spliced intron, and the other containing an intron that depends on an exon enhancer for efficient splicing. In contrast, each block of 22 repeats is not sufficient for efficient inclusion of an alternatively spliced exon in another pre-mRNA. In this case, a longer CTD is important for counteracting the negative effect of a splicing silencer element located within the alternative exon. Our results indicate that the length, rather than the composition of CTD repeats, can be the major determinant in efficient processing of different pre-mRNA substrates. However, the extent of this length requirement depends on specific sequence features within the pre-mRNA substrate.
