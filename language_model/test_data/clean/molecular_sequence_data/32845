White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is the causative agent of a severe disease of cultivated shrimp. Using purified WSSV virions, VP53A encoded by open reading frame wssv067 was identified as a structural protein by SDS-PAGE and proteomics. Immunoelectron microscopy with a gold-labeled secondary antibody revealed that VP53A was distributed on the viral envelope. In order to further explore the link between WSSV067 and host proteins, we performed a yeast 2-hybrid screening of a Penaeus monodon cDNA library, using WSSV067C as bait. One of the molecules that specifically interacted with WSSV067C was the P. monodon chitin-binding protein (PmCBP). An in vitro binding assay showed that c-myc-WSSV067C was capable of co-precipitating HA-PmCBP-C. Furthermore, PmCBP was expressed in almost all organs but appeared to be up-regulated at the late stage of WSSV infection.
