Trypanothione disulfide (T[S]2), an unusual form of glutathione found in parasitic protozoa, plays a crucial role in the regulation of the intracellular thiol redox balance and in the defense against oxidative stress. Trypanothione reductase (TR) is central to the thiol metabolism in all trypanosomatids, including the human pathogens Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania. Here we report the cloning, sequencing and expression of the TR encoding gene from L. (L.) amazonensis. Multiple protein sequence alignment of all known trypanosomatid TRs highlights the high degree of conservation and illustrates the phylogenetic relationships. A 3D homology model for L. amazonensis TR was constructed based on the previously reported Crithidia fasciculata structure. The purified recombinant TR shows enzyme activity and in vivo expression of the native enzyme could be detected in infective promastigotes, both by Western blotting and by immunofluorescence.
