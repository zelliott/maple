The glycoprotein complex gII of pseudorabies virus was isolated by immunoprecipitation with the monoclonal antibody M5, which was covalently linked to protein A-Sepharose. After sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyarylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and blotting onto poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane, its subunits, gIIa, gIIb, and gIIc, were subjected to N-terminal sequencing. gIIa and gIIb start at position 59 and gIIc starts at position 503 according to the amino acid sequence deduced from the gene, indicating that there is one major protein (gIIa) which is cleaved into the two protein fragments gIIb and gIIc. Protein labeling with 14C-amino acids gave no indication that the three proteins (gIIa, gIIb, and gIIc) of the complex are present in equimolar ratios. It seems that gIIa is only a minor component of the complex, whereas gIIb and gIIc are contained in equimolar amounts.
