Parathyroid hormone inhibits sodium-phosphate cotransport in proximal renal tubule cells through activation of several kinases. We tested the hypothesis that the activity of these kinases was coordinated by an A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) by demonstrating that the type II sodium-phosphate cotransporter (NaPi-4) physically associated with an AKAP and that this association was necessary for regulation of phosphate transport by parathyroid hormone. Immunoprecipitation with anti-NaPi-4 antiserum and glutathione S-transferase pull-down with GST-NaPi-4 showed that NaPi-4 associated with AKAP79, protein kinase A catalytic and regulatory subunits, and the parathyroid hormone receptor in opossum kidney cells. When the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A was uncoupled from the AKAP by a competing peptide, parathyroid hormone lost the ability to inhibit phosphate transport. This result was confirmed by co-transfecting HEK293 cells with the sodium-phosphate cotransporter and wild type AKAP, a mutant AKAP79, or the empty vector. 8-Bromo-cAMP was able to inhibit phosphate transport in cells expressing the wild type AKAP79 but not empty vector or mutant AKAP79. We conclude that parathyroid hormone inhibits proximal renal tubule sodium-phosphate cotransport through a signaling complex dependent upon an AKAP.
