We have found that phenolic antioxidants specifically induce expression of the c-fos and c-jun protooncogenes. After treatment of quiescent human hepatoma HepG2 cells with butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyanisole, or other phenolic antoxidants, the levels of c-fos and c-jun mRNAs are substantially increased. This response is antioxidant specific, dose dependent, and transient, with maximal levels at 3-6 h. The antioxidant-specific induction of c-fos/CAT promoter constructs in transient transfections indicates that at least a portion of this response is transcriptional. Deletions and point mutations map sequences required for the antioxidant response of the c-fos promoter to the serum response element. The antioxidant-specific induction of expression directed by a reporter plasmid containing four AP-1 sites and the induction of AP-1 DNA-binding activity confirm previous results indicating that antioxidant treatment increases AP-1 activity.
