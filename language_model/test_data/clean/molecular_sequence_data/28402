Eight cDNA clones, closely related to the carcino-embryonic antigen gene family, have been isolated from a cDNA library representing genes expressed in the first trimester human placenta. Sequence analysis of one clone shows it to be a pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein (PS beta G) closely related to three other PS beta G cDNA recently characterised from a term placenta library. The protein encoded by the cDNA is predicted to be less high glycosylated than those reported previously and differs markedly in the C-terminal sequence. The 3' untranslated region of the cDNA is very similar to the equivalent region of beta 1-glycoprotein PS beta G E except that it contains the 12bp repeat sequence found flanking the Alu sequence in CEa and an additional 67bp of sequence that appears to be derived from CEA.
