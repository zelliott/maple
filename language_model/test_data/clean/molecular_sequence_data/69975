The murine cripto gene encodes a 171-aminoacid epidermal growth factor-related protein, with 93% similarity to its human counterpart in the 'EGF-like' domain. The murine cripto mRNA contains two B1 repeats in its 3' non-coding region and a 163-nucleotide homology to the human mRNA. The mouse cripto gene is expressed at low level in specific organs of the adult animal such as spleen, heart, lung and brain. In situ hybridization analysis during murine embryogenesis (day 6.2 to day 10.5) reveals a very restricted expression pattern. cripto transcripts are first detected in a few epiblastic cells at day 6.5. During gastrulation, the transcripts are expressed in the forming mesoderm and later during development cripto gene expression is restricted to the truncus arteriosus of the developing heart. This expression pattern suggests a role for cripto gene in the determination of the epiblastic cells that subsequently give rise to the mesoderm.
