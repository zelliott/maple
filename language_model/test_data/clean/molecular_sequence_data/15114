SK(66)-his, a novel glycine-rich peptide derived from the CG13551 gene of Drosophila, was directly expressed in Escherichia coli with the help of the glucose effect of the lac repressor and efficiently purified in high yield (10.063 mg/l). It showed significant activity against Gram-positive bacteria. We determined a MIC value of 9 microg ml(-1) with Bacillus thuringiensis.
