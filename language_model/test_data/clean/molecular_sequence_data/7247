Site-directed mutagenesis of the penDE gene and expression in Escherichia coli has produced recombinant acylcoenzyme A:isopenicillin N acyltransferase (re-AT) containing amino-acid substitutions in the proenzyme cleavage site (decreases) region (Asp-Gly102 decreases Cys103-Thr-Thr). The effect of these substitutions on proenzyme cleavage and AT activity has been investigated. The re-AT with substitutions at Cys103 (Cys103-->Ser, Cys103-->Ala and Cys103-->Trp) were uncleaved and inactive. Substitutions at Asp101 and Gly102 (Asp101-->Gly, Gly102-->Ala, Gly102-->Val, Gly102-->Met, Gly102-->Val and Asp101Gly102-->GlyPhe) did not prevent proenzyme cleavage or abolish AT activity. Thr105-->Ser and Thr105-->Ala substitutions did not prevent proenzyme cleavage or AT activity; however, AT containing Thr105-->Val resulted in a significant inhibition of proenzyme cleavage.
