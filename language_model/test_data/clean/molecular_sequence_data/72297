The Saccharomyces cerevisiae SPE3 gene, coding for spermidine synthase, was cloned, sequenced, and localized on the right arm of chromosome XVI. The deduced amino acid sequence has a high similarity to mammalian spermidine synthases, and has putative S-adenosylmethionine binding motifs. To investigate the effect of total loss of the SPE3 gene, we constructed a null mutant of this gene, spe3delta, which has no spermidine synthase activity and has an absolute requirement for spermidine or spermine for the growth. This requirement is satisfied by a very low concentration of spermidine (10(-8) M) or a higher concentration of spermine (10(-6) M).
