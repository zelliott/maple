Recombination intermediates, such as double Holliday junctions, can be resolved by nucleases or dissolved by the combined action of a DNA helicase and a topoisomerase. In eukaryotes, dissolution is mediated by the RTR complex consisting of a RecQ helicase, a type IA topoisomerase and the structural protein RecQ-mediated genome instability 1 (RMI1). Throughout eukaryotes, the RTR complex is involved in DNA repair and in the suppression of homologous recombination (HR) in somatic cells. Surprisingly, Arabidopsis thaliana mutants of topoisomerase 3Î± and RMI1 are also sterile due to extensive chromosome breakage in meiosis I, indicating that both proteins are essential for meiotic recombination in plants. AtRMI1 harbours an N-terminal DUF1767 domain and two oligosaccharide binding (OB)-fold domains. To define specific roles for these individual domains, we performed complementation experiments on Atrmi1 mutants with an AtRMI1 full-length open reading frame (ORF) or deletion constructs lacking specific domains. We show that the DUF1767 domain and the OB-fold domain 1 are both essential for the function of AtRMI1 in DNA cross-link repair as well as meiotic recombination, but partially dispensable for somatic HR suppression. The OB-fold domain 2 is not necessary for either somatic or meiotic HR, but it seems to have a minor function in DNA cross-link repair.
