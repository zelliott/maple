The Ecm1 gene encodes an 85-kDa protein of unknown function that was originally identified as a secretory protein of the murine osteogenic stromal cell line MN7. This paper describes the isolation of a genomic clone containing the human ECM1 gene from a chromosome 1 cosmid library and the characterization of its exon-intron structure. The protein coding region comprises 10 exons. The ECM1 gene maps at chromosome 1q21 outside the epidermal differentiation complex region. The ECM1 gene appears to be expressed as a 1.8-kb transcript predominantly in placenta and heart, while an additional 1.4-kb alternatively spliced message was detected in tonsils. The full-length human ECM1 transcript contains 1838 bp and has an overall homology of 79.6% with the mouse Ecm1 cDNA. This transcript codes for a protein of 540 amino acids that is 69.4% identical and 81.3% similar to the corresponding mouse protein. The alternatively spliced variant, 1450 bp long, encodes a protein of 415 amino acids.
