We describe the cloning of a cDNA from a human testis library that encodes a novel protein with similarity to one repeat of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels (Ca(v)). Northern and dot blot analyses indicate that the novel Ca(v)-like gene is expressed predominantly in testis and at lower levels in many other tissues. Heterologous expression of the Ca(v)-like protein did not lead to the induction of any detectable ionic current and failed to modify intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations. Similar one-repeat Ca(v)-like proteins have been cloned from Bacillus, Mus, and Homo, and appear to encode ion channels involved in renal function, axis determination, and sperm motility.
