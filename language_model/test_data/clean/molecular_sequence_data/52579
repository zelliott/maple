In contrast to the human and mouse Mhc, in which the clusters of class I and class II loci reside in close vicinity to one another, in the zebrafish, Danio rerio, they are found in different linkage groups. Chromosome walking using BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) and PAC (P1 artificial chromosome) clones reveals the zebrafish class I region to occupy a segment of approximately 450 kb and to encompass at least 19 loci. These include three class I (Dare-UDA, -UEA, -UFA), five proteasome subunit beta (PSMB8, -9A, -9C, -11, -12), two TAPs (TAP2A, TAP2B), and one TAP binding protein (TAPBP). This arrangement contrasts with the arrangements found in human and mouse Mhc, in which the orthologues of the PSMB, TAP, and TAPBP loci reside within the class II region. In addition to this main zebrafish class I contig, a shorter contig of about 150 kb contains two additional class I (UBA, UCA) and at least five other loci. It probably represents a different haplotype of part of the class I region. The previously identified UAA gene shares an identical 5' part with UEA, but the two genes differ in their 3' parts. One of them is probably the result of an unequal crossing over. The described organization has implications for the persistence of syntenic relationships, coevolution of loci, and interpretation of the origin of the human/mouse Mhc organization.
