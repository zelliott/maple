The application of polymer supports for the synthesis of polypeptides, oligonucleotides, and oligosaccharides is presented in this article and discussed in view of their methodology. The fundamentals of the polymer-supported synthesis are described as well as the role of the polymer supports in the synthetic cycle, and the problems associated are debated. It is focused on typical polymer supports for each substance class, and an overview is given on recent tendencies of development in the polymer-supported methods of synthesis.
