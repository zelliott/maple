Memory is thought to be subserved by structural and functional alteration in synaptic connectivity. But although neuronal plasticity requires gene expression, the identity of the proteins involved is largely unknown. Using the chick 1-day-old passive avoidance learning paradigm and differential display RNA fingerprinting, we identified 13 candidate genes which are upregulated in the intermediate medial hyperstriatum ventrale (IMHV), an area that has been correlated with the initial processing of memory formation. One of the induced genes is a new member of the cyclin family, with high homology to cyclin L (ania-6a). Analysis of the expression pattern of this gene after training revealed two time waves of induction: the first correlated with learning and initial memory process in the IMHV; the second correlated with memory consolidation, first in the IMHV, and then in the lobus paraolefactoris. There is a correlation between methylanthranilate (MeA) concentrations (the malaise substrate in the passive avoidance training procedure), the duration of memory and the expression level of cyclin S. While training chicks on low concentrations of MeA causes short-term memory and low expression level of cyclin S, high concentration of MeA induces long-term memory and high expression level of cyclin S in the IMHV. The role of cyclins in the regulation of neuronal-plasticity-related gene expression was overlooked, and it might serve as a key step in long-term memory formation.
