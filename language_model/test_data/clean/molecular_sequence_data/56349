The crystal structure of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, complexed with ATP and a 20-residue inhibitor peptide, is reviewed and correlated with chemical and genetic data. The striking convergence of the structure with the biochemistry and genetics provides for the first time a molecular basis for understanding how this enzyme functions, as well as an explanation for the highly conserved residues that are scattered throughout the molecule. Because these residues probably serve a common role in all eukaryotic protein kinases, this first protein kinase structure serves as a general template for the entire family of enzymes.
