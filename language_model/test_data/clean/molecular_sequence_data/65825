Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a Mg2+-dependent endoribonuclease responsible for the 5'-maturation of transfer RNAs. It is a ribonucleoprotein complex containing an essential RNA and a varying number of protein subunits depending on the source: at least one, four and nine in Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya, respectively. Since bacterial RNase P is required for viability and differs in structure/subunit composition from its eukaryal counterpart, it is a potential antibacterial target. To elucidate the basis for our previous finding that the hexa-arginine derivative of neomycin B is 500-fold more potent than neomycin B in inhibiting bacterial RNase P, we synthesized hexa-guanidinium and -lysyl conjugates of neomycin B and compared their inhibitory potential. Our studies indicate that side-chain length, flexibility and composition cumulatively account for the inhibitory potency of the aminoglycoside-arginine conjugates (AACs). We also demonstrate that AACs interfere with RNase P function by displacing Mg2+ ions. Moreover, our finding that an AAC can discriminate between a bacterial and archaeal (an experimental surrogate for eukaryal) RNase P holoenzyme lends promise to the design of aminoglycoside conjugates as selective inhibitors of bacterial RNase P, especially once the structural differences in RNase P from the three domains of life have been established.
