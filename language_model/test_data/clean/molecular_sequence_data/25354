A plasmid carrying a 2.4-kilobase-pair fragment of DNA from Pseudomonas sp. strain PG2982 has been isolated which was able to increase the glyphosate resistance of Escherichia coli cells. The increase in resistance was dependent on the presence of a plasmid-encoded protein with a molecular weight of approximately 33,000, the product of a translational fusion between a gene on the vector, pACYC184, and the insert DNA. An overlapping region of the PG2982 chromosome carrying the entire gene (designated igrA) was cloned, and a plasmid (pPG18) carrying the gene was also able to increase glyphosate resistance in E. coli. A protein with a molecular weight of approximately 40,000 was encoded by the PG2982 DNA contained in pPG18. This plasmid was not able to complement a mutation in the gene for 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (aroA) in E. coli, and modification of glyphosate by E. coli cells containing the plasmid could not be demonstrated. The nucleotide sequence of the PG2982 DNA contained an open reading frame able to encode a protein with a calculated molecular weight of 39,396.
