The 96-amino acid Vpr protein is the major virion-associated accessory protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). As Vpr is not part of the p55 Gag polyprotein precursor (Pr55(gag)), its incorporation requires an anchor to associate with the assembling viral particles. Although the molecular mechanism is presently unclear, the C-terminal region of the Pr55(gag) corresponding to the p6 domain appears to constitute such an anchor essential for the incorporation of the Vpr protein. In order to clarify the mechanism by which the Vpr accessory protein is trans-incorporated into progeny virion particles, we tested whether HIV-1 Vpr interacted with the Pr55(gag) using the yeast two-hybrid system and the maltose-binding protein pull-down assay. The present study provides genetic and biochemical evidence indicating that the Pr55(gag) can physically interact with the Vpr protein. Furthermore, point mutations affecting the integrity of the conserved L-X-S-L-F-G motif of p6(gag) completely abolish the interaction between Vpr and the Pr55(gag) and, as a consequence, prevent Vpr virion incorporation. In contrast to other studies, mutations affecting the integrity of the NCp7 zinc fingers impaired neither Vpr virion incorporation nor the binding between Vpr and the Pr55(gag). Conversely, amino acid substitutions in Vpr demonstrate that an intact N-terminal alpha-helical structure is essential for the Vpr-Pr55(gag) interaction. Vpr and the Pr55(gag) demonstrate a strong interaction in vitro as salt concentrations as high as 900 mM could not disrupt the interaction. Finally, the interaction is efficiently competed using anti-Vpr sera. Together, these results strongly suggest that Vpr trans-incorporation into HIV-1 particles requires a direct interaction between its N-terminal region and the C-terminal region of p6(gag). The development of Pr55(gag)-Vpr interaction assays may allow the screening of molecules that can prevent the incorporation of the Vpr accessory protein into HIV-1 virions, and thus inhibit its early functions.
