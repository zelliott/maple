To screen for the existence and determine the structure of Tn916-like element in Streptococcus parauberis serotype II strains isolated from cultured Japanese flounder in western Japan.

In this study, the structure of Tn916-like element and the flanking regions were characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and inverse PCR, followed by cloning and sequencing. The Tn916-like element is 18 031 bp in length and composed of 22 ORFs. Southern blot hybridization analysis showed that the HincII-digested internal structures of Tn916-like elements yielded two patterns among S. parauberis serotype II strains. The flanking sequences were identical with the corresponding region of S. parauberis serotype I strain except for the addition of 6-bp coupling sequence (ATCATA) being adjacent to the upstream of the element.

The Tn916-like element exhibited high homology (more than 99%) with Tn916 observed in other streptococci and enterococci and was integrated in the same site of chromosome for all of the tested S. parauberis serotype II strains.

The results indicate that the Tn916-like element encoding tet(M) gene is present in all of the tested S. parauberis serotype II strains, which are disseminated in the flounder-culturing areas in western Japan.
