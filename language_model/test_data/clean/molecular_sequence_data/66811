Histone methylation has important roles in regulating gene expression and forms part of the epigenetic memory system that regulates cell fate and identity. Enzymes that directly remove methyl marks from histones have recently been identified, revealing a new level of plasticity within this epigenetic modification system. Here we analyse the evolutionary relationship between Jumonji C (JmjC)-domain-containing proteins and discuss their cellular functions in relation to their potential enzymatic activities.
