Four isolates of potato witches'-broom phytoplasma, designated as PW1, PW2, PW3 and PW4, were established on four potato cultivars. The identity of each isolate was confirmed by PCR using two universal primer pairs and one specific primer set derived from phytoplasma of 16S rDNA sequences. The four isolate samples formed similar RFLP patterns after digestion of 1.2 kb PCR products with restriction endonucleases AluI, HhaI, RsaI and Sau3A. The direct DNA sequencing with the specific primer pair showed that there are no differences in the base sequences among PW1, PW2, and PW3 phytoplasma isolates and that PW4 is closely related to them. Thus, the four isolates were identified as members of the clover proliferation group.
