The 3' untranslated region of the U1A mRNA contains a binding site for the U1A protein that consists of two asymmetric internal bulges. The bulges each comprise a loop of seven unpaired bases opposing a single base (termed a U1A box). The seven-base loops are located on opposite strands, distributed in a symmetrical manner about the intervening four-base duplex. We have investigated the global conformation of this binding element. Comparison of electrophoretic mobilities of RNA duplexes interrupted by a single U1A box with a series of duplexes of the same length containing oligoadenine bulges indicates that the individual boxes cause a substantial kinking of the helix axis, estimated to be 90 (+/- 10) degrees. A series of RNA duplexes were constructed containing a U1A box separated from an A5 bulge by a duplex section of length between 3 and 21 bp. It was found that the electrophoretic mobilities of these species varied sinusoidally, indicating that the U1A box introduces a defined kink into the RNA helix, rather than a point of flexibility. Electrophoretic experiments with the complete U1A binding element suggest that the axial trajectories of the two U1A boxes combine to give an approximately in-line, 180 degrees change in duplex direction.
