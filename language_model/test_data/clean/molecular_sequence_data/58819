Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is the first lymphokine secreted following T cell activation. Several transcription factors regulate IL-2 gene expression, including the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). NFAT acts at the antigen receptor response element-2 (ARRE-2) sequence in the IL-2 enhancer and is the nuclear target of T cell stimulation signals and the immunosuppressant drugs cyclosporine and FK506, which are potent inhibitors of IL-2 gene transcription. NFAT has been cloned and found to consist of two subunits, NF45 (ILF2) and NF90 (ILF3). This communication reports the assignment of NF45, interleukin enhancer binding factor 2 gene (ILF2), to human chromosome 1 (1q11-qter and 1p11-p12) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of ILF2-specific DNA sequences from well-characterized human-rodent somatic cell hybrid DNA.
