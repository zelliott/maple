The blood of the Rock-Hopper Penguin contains only one hemoglobin component, corresponding to the Hb A of other birds. The primary structures of the alpha- and beta-chains are presented. The chains were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography and cleaved either enzymatically (alpha) or both enzymatically and chemically (beta). Both the native chains and their peptides were sequenced using liquid and gas phase sequenators. The peptides were aligned using their homology to the sequence of human hemoglobin and other bird hemoglobins. As compared to human hemoglobin, 44 amino-acid replacements are found in the alpha-chains (68% homology) and 47 in the beta-chains (67.8% homology). These exchanges involve seven alpha 1/beta 1 and one alpha 1/beta 2 contact in the alpha-chains, whereas in the beta-chains eight alpha 1/beta 1, one alpha 1/beta 2 and one hem contact are substituted. The influence of these replacements on the structure-function relationships in hemoglobin, as well as their importance for the diving ability of penguins, are discussed.
