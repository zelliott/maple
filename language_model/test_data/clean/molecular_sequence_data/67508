Aphids are insect pests with significant importance worldwide for agricultural and horticultural crops. The chemical pesticides used to control aphids could result in pesticide residues in agricultural and horticultural products as well as in negative effects on the environment. Therefore, alternative control methods are urgently needed. This study identified a new gene from strain BJFS526 of the symbiotic bacterium Xenorhabdus bovienii and expressed the protease inhibitor protein encoded by the gene. The effects of the protein on the pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum, were also investigated.

The gene PIN1 encoding the protease inhibitor protein against aphids was successfully cloned from BJFS526. The study demonstrated that the protein had adverse effects on pea aphid survival, and that the activity of aphid aminopeptidase was significantly inhibited by the protein.

The results from this study suggest that this gene and the protease inhibitor protein encoded may offer an alternative method to control aphids in the future.
