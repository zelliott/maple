Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-2 (PARP-2) was described to regulate cellular functions comprising DNA surveillance, inflammation and cell differentiation by co-regulating different transcription factors. Using an in vitro and in vivo approach, we identified PARP-2 as a new substrate for the histone acetyltransferases PCAF and GCN5L. Site directed mutagenesis indicated that lysines 36 and 37, located in the nuclear localization signal of PARP-2, are the main targets for PCAF and GCN5L activity in vitro. Interestingly, acetylation of the same two PARP-2 residues reduces the DNA binding and enzymatic activity of PARP-2. Finally, PARP-2 with mutated lysines 36 and 37 showed reduced auto-mono-ADP-ribosylation when compared to wild type PARP-2. Together, our results provide evidence that acetylation of PARP-2 is a key post-translational modification that may regulate DNA binding and consequently also the enzymatic activity of PARP-2.
