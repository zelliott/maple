Four types of phospholipase D (PLD), PLD alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, have been characterized in Arabidopsis, and they display different requirements for Ca(2+), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)), substrate vesicle composition, and/or free fatty acids. However, all previously cloned plant PLDs contain a Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid-binding C2 domain and require Ca(2+) for activity. This study documents a new type of PLD, PLD zeta 1, which is distinctively different from previously characterized PLDs. It contains at the N terminus a Phox homology domain and a pleckstrin homology domain, but not the C2 domain. A full-length cDNA for Arabidopsis PLD zeta 1 has been identified and used to express catalytically active PLD in Escherichia coli. PLD zeta 1 does not require Ca(2+) or any other divalent cation for activity. In addition, it selectively hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine, whereas the other Arabidopsis PLDs use several phospholipids as substrates. PLD zeta 1 requires PIP(2) for activity, but unlike the PIP(2)-requiring PLD beta or gamma, phosphatidylethanolamine is not needed in substrate vesicles. These differences are described, together with a genomic analysis of 12 putative Arabidopsis PLD genes that are grouped into alpha, beta, delta, gamma, and zeta based on their gene architectures, sequence similarities, domain structures, and biochemical properties.
