This study investigates sequence variation in mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene within Cercopithifilaria sp. recorded recently in Italy. Fourteen sequence types (haplotypes) were characterized for 163 (7.7%) amplicons from 2111 Genomic DNA samples prepared from skin samples from dogs and from Rhipicephalus sanguineus (ticks) from different geographical areas of the Mediterranean basin (i.e., Italy, Spain and Greece). The most prevalent sequence types represented haplotypes I (70.5%) and X (16.0%), followed by haplotype VIII (4.9%) and other 11 haplotypes (8.6%). Three haplotypes (II, V and VI) were found exclusively in ticks. The overall intraspecific nucleotide variation among pcox1 haplotypes ranged from 0.4 to 3.5% (mean = 1.6%), whereas a mean interspecific difference of 9.5% was detected as compared with other onchocercids. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence data showed a clustering of Cercopithifilaria sp. with the other Cercopithifilaria species (with strong statistical support) to the exclusion of other onchocercids. The number of haplotypes identified here might be explained by complex ecology and transmission patterns as well as the high mutation rate of mitochondrial DNA and/or inbreeding associated with hosts and their vectors.
