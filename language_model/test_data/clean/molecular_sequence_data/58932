Homeobox genes encode transcription factors involved in the genetic control of normal development and differentiation, as well as in malignant transformation. To begin to assess the possible role of homeobox genes in prostatic cell carcinogenesis, we surveyed initially for expression of homeobox-containing genes in the TSU-PR1 cell line.

This was performed by RT-PCR using degenerate oligodeoxyribonucleotide primers to the homeobox-binding sequence to generate partial cDNAs which were cloned and sequenced.

Using this method, expression of 14 members of homeobox-containing genes were detected in TSU-PR1 cells. All of these expressed genes correspond to previously identified homeobox genes located within the HOXA, B, C, and D clusters. We further examined the expression of these homeobox genes in different human prostatic cell lines by using whole cDNA slot blot and Northern blot analysis. One of the sequences corresponding to the human GBX2 homeobox gene is overexpressed in TSU-PR1, LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145 metastatic prostate cell lines relative to the normal prostate.

Our results suggest that the homeobox gene GBX2 may participate in metastatic progression in prostatic cancer.
