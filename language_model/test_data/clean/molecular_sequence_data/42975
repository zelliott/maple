This paper presents circumstantial evidence that the mating system of the North American pocket gophers (Rodentia: Geomyidae) is a promiscuous one, with female choice at its base. A molecular marker (a length variant in the mitochondrial Control region [D-loop]) is used to show mating asymmetry in a hybrid zone between the species Thomomys bottae and Thomomys townsendii in north-eastern California. All hybrids result from a bottae mother x townsendii father cross. Because of significant differences in body size and resulting burrow diameter, bottae females must have actively sought their respective townsendii mates for the asymmetry in mating to have occurred, signalling female choice in these subterranean mammals that are otherwise characterized by exclusive-use territories, skewed adult sex ratio in favour of females, and high variance in male reproductive success.
