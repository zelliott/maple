Interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) is an extracellular protein that has been suggested to participate in the visual process as a carrier for visual retinoids. A chimeric gene composed of the human IRBP promoter fused to the bacterial reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) was used to generate transgenic mice. Analysis of six transgenic families revealed that the CAT gene, concomitant with the endogenous IRBP gene, was expressed primarily in the retina and, to a lesser extent, in the pineal gland. These results establish that a 1.3-kilobase fragment from the 5' end of the human IRBP gene is sufficient to direct transgene expression to a visual subdivision of the central nervous system.
