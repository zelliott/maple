Two bacterial strains, designated KV-962(T) and KV-963, were isolated from soil collected from a field in Japan. Cells of both strains were Gram-staining-positive, non-spore-forming, short rod-shaped and motile. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that these strains were related to Conexibacter woesei DSM 14684(T), with a similarity value of 98.6 %. These strains possessed MK-7 (H(4)) as the sole menaquinone and contained C(18 : 1)ω9c, C(17 : 1)ω6c and iso-C(16 : 0) as the major fatty acids. On the basis of genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, strain KV-962(T) and KV-963 were indicated as a novel species of the genus Conexibacter, for which the name Conexibacter arvalis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KV-962(T) ( = DSM 23288(T)  = NBRC 106558(T)).
