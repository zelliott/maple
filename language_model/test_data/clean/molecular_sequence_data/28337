The sequence specificity in the photoreaction (365 nm) of 6,4,4'-trimethylangelicin (TMA) with DNA fragments of the lac I gene of Escherichia coli was studied by using DNA sequencing methodology. In order to map the sites of TMA photoaddition, we took advantage of the (3'-5') exonuclease activity associated with T4 DNA polymerase, which is blocked by bulky adducts, such as furocoumarin photoadducts. A quantitative analysis of the sites of photoaddition is reported. TMA was demonstrated to photoreact with thymine and, to a lower extent, to cytosine. AT-rich sequences and TTT sites in a GC context are the most reactive sites towards TMA whereas TA, AT, CA, AC sites are weaker sites with similar reactivity. Cytosines in alternated CG sequences are also targets of TMA photobinding. We observed a less pronounced sequence specificity of TMA than that of other psoralen derivatives already studied (Sage and Moustacchi, 1987; Boyer et al., 1988). A comparison with other furocoumarins 4,4'-dimethylangelicin (4,4'-DMA), 4'-methylangelicin (4'-MA), angelicin, 4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen (TMP) and 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) is also reported. The role of flanking sequence and consequently of the local conformation at the various sites of photoaddition is discussed. A preferential orientation of the TMA molecule during the intercalation in the dark is suggested. Hot alkali treatment of TMA-modified DNA did not reveal any DNA strand breakage due to photooxidized bases.
