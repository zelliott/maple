A cDNA for oxidosqualene:lanosterol cyclase (OSLC) was cloned and sequenced from the fungus Cephalosporium caerulens, that produces a steroidal antibiotic, helvolic acid. A 2280 bp open reading frame encoded an M(r) 87078 protein with 760 amino acids. The cDNA was functionally expressed in the OSLC-deficient mutant GIL77 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A truncated recombinant enzyme (Delta49N) starting from the second methionine (M50) residue was completely inactive, suggesting that ca. 30 additional hydrophilic amino acid residues at the N-terminal are essential for the folding of the enzyme. Furthermore, the active site residues, H234 and D456 (numbering in S. cerevisiae OSLC), were chosen for site-directed mutagenesis experiments; H234E, H234Y, H234F, D456E, D456N, and D456H mutants were inactive, while H234W and H234K mutants retained lanosterol-forming activity.
