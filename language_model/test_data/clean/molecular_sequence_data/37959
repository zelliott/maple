Nap1p is identified in mammalian cell extract by its intrinsic activity to facilitate nucleosome assembly in vitro in the physiological ionic condition. The homologous proteins are present in most eukaryotes, and their functional analyses in vitro have suggested that they are necessary to keep proper nucleosome structures in transcription and replication. This protein is also identified for its interaction with Clb2p in vitro. To address the function of Nap1p in vivo, we have surveyed for proteins to interact with Nap1p by two-hybrid system and obtained two genes, NBP1 and NBP2 (Nap1 Binding Protein 1 and 2). NBP1 is an essential gene and encodes a novel protein consisting of 319 amino acids, with a coiled-coil structure in the center of the predicted amino acid sequence. Several A-kinase dependent phosphorylation sites and Cdc28p kinase-dependent sites are also observed. By isolating the temperature-sensitive mutant, we demonstrate that the nuclear division at a non-permissive temperature is delayed and that the population of cells with a large bud carrying a single nucleus with a short spindle are increased. This mutant also confers resistance against benomyl, a microtubule-destabilizing agent. Judging from the green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal fused with Nbp1p, this protein localizes in the nucleus as one or two tiny dots.
