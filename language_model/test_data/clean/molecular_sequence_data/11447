A gene, Pf77, transcribed in the sexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum was isolated from a genomic expression library with a polyclonal antibody raised to gametocyte proteins. The entire coding region was obtained from a series of overlapping genomic and cDNA clones (from gametocyte RNA). A single open reading frame is present with no introns and no tandem repeat sequences. A Pf77 probe hybridised to a single transcript present in RNA prepared from purified gametocytes and could not be detected in RNA prepared from asexual blood stages. In situ hybridisation studies confirmed that the expression of Pf77 mRNA is sexual-stage-specific and in addition, showed that Pf77 mRNA is present only in female gametocytes during the vertebrate stages of the parasite's development.
