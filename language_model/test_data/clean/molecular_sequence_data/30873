Thyroid hormonogenesis in thyroglobulin results in the conversion of an "acceptor" iodotyrosine to a hormone residue and a "donor" iodotyrosine to a dehydroalanine residue. Altogether five acceptor sites have been located as hormone residues in thyroglobulin of different animal species. To search for donor sites, we treated bovine thyroglobulin with 4-aminothiophenol to specifically modify dehydroalanine residues to S-(4-aminophenyl)cysteine (APC) residues, according to the principle of dehydroalanine determination developed by us (Kondo, T., Kondo, Y., and Ui, N. (1988) Mol. Cell. Endocr. 57, 101-106). After digesting thyroglobulin with lysyl endopeptidase, APC-containing peptides were separated from other peptides by trapping them on immobilized naphthylethylenediamine and from each other by size-exclusion and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The HPLC patterns showed about 10 APC-containing peptides. Among them, four different peptides were purified by repeated reverse-phase HPLC. The results of partial sequencing of the four peptides by manual Edman degradation disclosed that Tyr5, Tyr926, Tyr1375, and Tyr986 or Tyr1008 are available for hormonogenesis as donor sites. These results strongly suggest that only specific tyrosine residues behave as donors.
