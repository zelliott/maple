The number of rRNA genes in Streptomyces lividans was examined by Southern hybridization. Randomly labeled 23 and 16S rRNAs were hybridized with BamHI, BglII, PstI, SalI, or XhoI digests of S. lividans TK21 DNA. BamHi, BglII, SalI and XhoI digests yielded six radioactive bands each for the 23 and 16S rRNAs, whereas PstI digests gave one band for the 23S rRNA and one high-intensity band and six low-density bands for the 16S rRNA. The 7.4-kilobase-pair BamHI fragment containing one of the rRNA gene clusters was cloned into plasmid pBR322. The hybrid plasmid, pSLTK1, was characterized by physical mapping, Southern hybridization, and electron microscopic analysis of the R loops formed between pSLTK1 and the 23 and 16S rRNAs. There were at least six rRNA genes in S. lividans TK21. The 16 and 23S rRNA genes were estimated to be about 1.40 and 3.17 kilobase pairs, respectively. The genes for the rRNAs were aligned in the sequence 16S-23S-5S. tRNA genes were not found in the spacer region or in the context of the rRNA genes. The G + C content of the spacer region was calculated to be approximately 58%, in contrast to 73% for the chromosome as a whole.
