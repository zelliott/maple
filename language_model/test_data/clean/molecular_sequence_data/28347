We have isolated from a human genomic library a pseudogene of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) gene. Its sequence shows a 78% similarity with the human PCNA/cDNA. The PCNA gene is located on human chromosome 20, while the pseudogene maps to chromosome region Xpter in equilibrium Xq13. An additional locus detected by the full-length PCNA cDNA, but not by intron probes, segregates concordantly with chromosome region 6p12 in equilibrium 6pter and probably represents a second pseudogene.
