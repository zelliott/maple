Characterization of the sequences involved in recombination of the Haemophilus plasmid p1056 with the Haemophilus influenzae chromosome produced evidence indicating site-specific recombination with chromosomal tRNA(Leu). attP sequences identical to those of p1056 were found in six plasmids of diverse origin, suggesting that a family of Haemophilus plasmids recombines with chromosomal tRNA(Leu).
