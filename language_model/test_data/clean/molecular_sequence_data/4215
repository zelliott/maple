A differential RNA display approach was used to study the gene expression in zoospores (Z) and germinating cysts (GC) of the late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans. Four differentially amplified cDNAs were selected and cloned. The clone pGPiZ0.5 showed a 2.7-kb transcript highly expressed in Z. A BLAST search revealed an almost full sequence homology (98%) to the P. infestans mitochondrial large subunit rRNA. Northern blot analysis showed a twofold accumulation of the mitochondrial rRNA (mit rRNA) in Z compared with that of GC and mycelia of P. infestans. The high level of mit rRNA in Z might reflect an increased number of gene copies, an increased rDNA transcription rate, or both. Dot blot experiments indicated that the amount of mitochondrial rDNA (mit rDNA) relative to cytoplasmic rDNA is twofold higher in Z and GC than in mycelia. This relatively elevated mit rDNA could explain the high level of mit rRNA in the zoosporic phase. On the contrary, GC conserves the mit rDNA content, but the level of mit rRNA drops to 50% that of Z. The data are consistent with a very active mitochondrial protein synthesis during zoosporic phase, followed by a rapid down-regulation of mitochondrial activity during cyst formation.
