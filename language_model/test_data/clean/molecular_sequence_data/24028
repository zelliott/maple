To clone, sequence, and express the aldolase (ALD) encoding gene of Plasmodium falciparum FCC1/HN strain.

The ALD encoding gene was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of FCC1/HN strain. The positive clones were screened and identified by agarose gel electrophoresis and endonuclease. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli M15. The fusion protein was expressed by IPTG induction and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and anion exchange column.

The ALD gene of P. falciparum was amplified. Analysis of sequencing showed that the ALD gene of P. falciparum was identical with the sequence of other reported isolates. A Mr 41,000 fusion protein was induced by IPTG and was purified by chromatography.

The ALD gene of P. falciparum FCC1/HN strain was identical to the other reported isolates. ALD fusion protein of P. falciparum was expressed and purified.
