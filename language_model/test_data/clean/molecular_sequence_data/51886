The selective association of the herpesvirus trans-activator VP16 with the human Oct-1 homeo domain is a model for differential positive transcriptional control by homeo domains. VP16 discriminates between the closely related homeo domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2 by distinguishing among their seven amino-acid differences; these differences lie on the surface that is thought to be accessible when the homeo domain is bound to DNA. Only two of these seven differences are recognized by VP16, one in each of the first two alpha-helices of the tri-alpha-helical homeo domain. The major determinant for selective association with VP16 in vitro and VP16-induced positive control in vivo is a single glutamic acid residue at position 22 in the first alpha-helix of the Oct-1 homeo domain, but the acidic properties of this residue are not critical for association with VP16 in vitro or in vivo, because it can be replaced by glutamine with little or no deleterious effect. Mere replacement of the single corresponding alanine residue in the Oct-2 homeo domain with the key glutamic acid residue is sufficient to confer on the Oct-2 homeo domain the ability to associate with VP16 in vitro and respond to VP16-induced positive control in vivo. Thus, the specificity of homeo domain positive control can be conferred by a single amino acid difference.
