A Gram-reaction-negative, chemo-organotrophic, non-motile, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium (strain Gsoil 080(T)) was isolated from soil collected in a ginseng field in Pocheon Province, South Korea, and was investigated by using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain Gsoil 080(T) was related most closely to Inquilinus limosus strains AU0476(T) and AU1979 (98.9 % similarity to both). Strain Gsoil 080(T) shared ≤91.3 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with the type strains of other recognized species examined. The genus Inquilinus belongs to the family Rhodospirillaceae in the order Rhodospirillales, class Alphaproteobacteria. The predominant ubiquinone was Q-10 and the major fatty acids were summed feature 7 (C(18 : 1)ω9c/ω12t/ω7c) and C(19 : 0) cyclo ω8c. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain Gsoil 080(T) was 69.9 mol%. The level of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain Gsoil 080(T) and I. limosus LMG 20952(T) was 12 %. The results of genotypic analyses in combination with chemotaxonomic and physiological data demonstrated that strain Gsoil 080(T) represents a novel species of the genus Inquilinus, for which the name Inquilinus ginsengisoli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is Gsoil 080(T) (=KCTC 12574(T) =LMG 23638(T)).
