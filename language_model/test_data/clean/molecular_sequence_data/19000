Toscana virus (TOSV) was detected for the first time from Phlebotomus perniciosus sandflies in Corsica, a French Mediterranean island. Genetic analysis showed that Corsican TOSV belongs to lineage A, together with Italian, Tunisian, Turkish and other French strains. The demonstration of TOSV in Corsica indicates that autochthonous and tourist populations are at risk of infection. Hence, physicians must consider TOSV as a possible cause of aseptic meningitis and unidentified febrile illness during the warm season.
