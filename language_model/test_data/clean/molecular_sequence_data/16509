Genes expressed by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae in necrotic porcine lung tissue were identified by selective capture of transcribed sequences analysis. In total, 46 genes were identified, 20 of which have been previously reported to be associated with in vivo expression or virulence in A. pleuropneumoniae or in other organisms.
