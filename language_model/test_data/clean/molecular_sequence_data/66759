Histone H3 is one of the four histones, along with H2A, H2B, and H4, which form the eukaryotic nucleosome octamer core. In this study, a new gene RH3.2A encoding an H3.2-type histone H3 protein from rice (Oryza sativa L.) was reported. RH3.2A was cloned through RT-PCR from salt-treated rice seedlings. This gene encoded a protein of 136 amino acid residues that were similar to some plant histone H3 proteins reported previously. However, the cDNA sequence of RH3.2A and other rice H3 genes were different. Alignment of RH3.2A encoding protein with other plant histone H3 proteins revealed that three amino acid residues (32, 88, and 91) were markedly different between H3.1-type and H3.2-type proteins. The mRNA expression analysis of RH3.2A revealed that RH3.2A gene was upregulated by salt stress in rice roots and ABA treatment in seedlings. The potential role of RH3.2A during salt stress was discussed.
