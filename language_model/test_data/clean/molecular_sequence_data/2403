An 83-base-pair-long hepatitis B virus DNA fragment efficiently activates the transcription of the heterologous globin gene promoter. This fragment contains binding sites for at least four distinct cellular factors termed E, TGT3, EP, and NF-I. E is a positively acting factor, responsive to phorbol ester. EP is apparently identical to the factor EF-C that binds to the polyomavirus enhancer. The conservation of the binding site sequences for most of these factors in the genomes of other members of the hepadnavirus family suggests that these viruses share common enhancer elements.
