Bone metastasis is a common event in prostate cancer, and it is known that some of the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are expressed in prostate cancer cells, while no study on the expression of their receptors, BMPRs, has been reported. Here we report cloning and sequence analysis of the human BMPR-IB cDNA. We also analysed the expression of transcripts of three types of the BMPR genes in human tissues and prostate cancer cell lines. The BMPR-IB mRNA was present in various organs, but the highest level was found in the prostate. Moreover, the amount of BMPR-IB mRNA was significantly low in prostate cancer tissues after androgen withdrawal and was also low in prostate cancer cell lines. RT-PCR analysis showed that the BMPR-IB message was upregulated by androgen stimulation in the LNCaP cell line which expresses the androgen receptor. By contrast, the mRNA levels of BMPR-IA and BMPR-II were not significantly different among non-cancerous and cancerous prostate tissues. It was also suggested that human BMPR-IA and BMPR-IB might have different biological functions in the prostate, although their sequences were 85.3% identical in the serine-threonine kinase domain.
