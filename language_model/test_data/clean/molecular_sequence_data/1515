Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also known as human herpesvirus 8, has been associated with the development of Kaposi's sarcoma, pleural effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman's disease. KSHV is a double-stranded DNA virus that has been classified as a gammaherpesvirus. The viral genome is approx 160 kb long and encodes for several genes that are involved in cell signaling pathways. These include genes that are unique to the virus as well as viral homologues of cellular genes. The latter are likely to have been usurped from the host genome and include both virokines and viral receptor proteins. This article reviews how these KSHV proteins modulate cellular signal transduction pathways.
