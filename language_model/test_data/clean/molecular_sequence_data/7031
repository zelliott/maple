The effects of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), a Staphylococcus aureus-derived bacterial superantigen, on expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were examined in cultured normal and transformed (DJM-1 cells) human keratinocytes by flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, digital image processing, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. SEB significantly upregulated ICAM-1 expression in the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-pretreated, HLA-DR-positive normal keratinocytes and DJM-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner, but not in the untreated, HLA-DR-negative cells. Other toxins such as diphtheria and pertussis toxins did not have the effect. The distribution of SEB and HLA-DR molecules was identical on the IFN-gamma-treated, HLA-DR-positive DJM-1 cells by confocal microscopy. Digital image processing analysis demonstrated that SEB induced a transient increase of intracellular calcium concentration only in the IFN-gamma-treated DJM-1 cells. Pretreatment of the IFN-gamma-treated DJM-1 cells with anti-major histocompatibility complex class II monoclonal antibody completely blocked the effect of SEB. Furthermore, ICAM-1 mRNA was detected in the IFN-gamma-pretreated, SEB-exposed normal keratinocytes by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Our results demonstrate that SEB binds to keratinocytes, presumably via major histocompatibility complex class II molecules such as HLA-DR, triggers calcium mobilization, and induces the synthesis of ICAM-1 molecules. We speculate that, in various cutaneous disorders, SEB penetrates the epidermis and interacts with HLA-DR-positive keratinocytes to upregulate ICAM-1 expression, thus modulating the course of the inflammatory process.
