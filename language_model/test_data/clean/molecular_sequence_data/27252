Aldehyde inhibitors such as furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, anisaldehyde, benzaldehyde, cinnamaldehyde, and phenylaldehyde are commonly generated during lignocellulosic biomass conversion process for low-cost cellulosic ethanol production that interferes with subsequent microbial growth and fermentation. In situ detoxification of the aldehyde inhibitors is possible by the tolerant ethanologenic yeast that involves multiple genes including numerous functional reductases. In this study, we report a novel aldehyde reductase gene clone Y63 from ethanologenic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae NRRL Y12632, representing the uncharacterized ORF YGL157W, which demonstrated NADPH-dependent reduction activities toward at least 14 aldehyde substrates. The identity of gene clone Y63 is the same with YGL157W of SGD since a variation of only 35 nucleotides in genomic sequence and three amino acid residues were observed between the two that share the same length of 347 residues in size. As one among the highly induced genes, YGL157W of Y-12632 showed significantly high levels of transcript abundance in response to furfural and HMF challenges. Based on the deduced amino acid sequence and the most conserved functional motif analyses including closely related reductases from five other yeast species to this date, YGL157W was identified as a member of the subclass 'intermediate' of the SDR (short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase) superfamily with the following typical characteristics: the most conserved catalytic site to lie at Tyr(169)-X-X-X-Lys(173); an indispensable reduction catalytic triad at Ser(131), Tyr(169), and Lys(173), and an approved cofactor-binding motif at Gly(11)-X-X-Gly(14)-X-X-Ala(17) near the N-terminus. YGL039W, YDR541C, and YOL151W (GRE2) appeared to be the similar type of enzymes falling into the same category of the intermediate subfamily.
