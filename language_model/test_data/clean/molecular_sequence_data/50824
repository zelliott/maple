Using an assay for rat platelet cAMP, we investigated the organ distribution of peptides that increase cAMP in rat platelets in porcine tissues. Marked activity was observed in the duodenum, pancreas and brain. By analysis with reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), three major peaks of activity were observed in porcine tissues. The first peak was vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and the second peak was calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The third peak of activity was isolated from porcine duodenum. By analysis with a gas phase sequencer and with an amino acid analyzer, this peptide was identified as peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI). In a glucagon-secretin family of neuropeptides, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) significantly increased platelet cAMP levels in a dose-dependent manner; however, glucagon did not. These results suggest that not only VIP and CGRP but also PHI and PACAP act upon platelets, as well as vascular tissues.
