Group A rotaviruses are a leading cause of gastroenteritis in humans and animals. Transmission between mammalian species and humans has been demonstrated repeatedly. Here, the first entire genome sequence (19,064 bp) of a chicken rotavirus, strain Ch-02V0002G3, is presented. A low degree of nucleotide sequence identity with the mammalian group A rotaviruses is evident for all 11 genome segments, whereas a closer relationship to available rotavirus sequences from avian species has been determined. According to a novel rotavirus classification system, new genotypes were proposed and ratified by the Rotavirus Classification Working Group for eight of the Ch-02V0002G3 genome segments, resulting in the genotype constellation G19-P[30]-I11-R6-C6-M7-A16-N6-T8-E10-H8. Due to the low percentages of genome sequence identity, the different genome segment sizes and the marked sequence differences of non-structural proteins, an independent evolution without exchange of genetic material between mammalian and avian group A rotavirus strains is likely.
