Six actinomycete strains isolated from soil and plant-litter samples in Indonesia were studied for their taxonomic position by using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetically, all the strains were located in the broad cluster of the genus Actinokineospora. Chemotaxonomic data [cell-wall diamino acid, meso-diaminopimelic acid; cell-wall peptidoglycan, type III (A1γ); major sugars, galactose and arabinose; major menaquinone, MK-9(H₄); major fatty acid, iso-C₁₆:₀; major phospholipid, phosphatidylethanolamine] supported the affiliation of all six strains to the genus Actinokineospora. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization with DNA from type strains of Actinokineospora species with validly published names revealed three DNA-DNA relatedness groups. Group I (ID03-0561(T)) showed low relatedness to the other strains studied. The three strains in group II (ID03-0784(T), ID03-0808 and ID03-0809) formed a group with high relatedness (98-100 %) and showed low relatedness to the other strains studied. The two strains in group III (ID03-0810(T) and ID03-0813) showed 58-68 % relatedness to Actinokineospora terrae NBRC 15668(T) and showed low relatedness (2-24 %) to the other strains studied. The description of three novel species is proposed: Actinokineospora baliensis sp. nov., for the single strain in group I (type strain ID03-0561(T) =BTCC B-554(T) =NBRC 104211(T)), Actinokineospora cibodasensis sp. nov., for the strains in group II (type strain ID03-0784(T) =BTCC B-555(T) =NBRC 104212(T)), and Actinokineospora cianjurensis sp. nov., for the strains in group III (type strain ID03-0810(T) =BTCC B-558(T) =NBRC 105526(T)).
