The genes for both subunits of Rubisco (rbcL, rbcS) are located on the plastome of the brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus (Chromophyta, Phaeophyceae). The organization of these genes in the form of an operon was similar to that found in rhodoplasts, cyanobacteria and the plastids of Cryptomonas phi. Sequence analysis of the complete operon revealed a high degree of homology and great structural similarities to corresponding genes from two red algae. In contrast, sequence homology to Rubisco genes from chloroplasts and cyanobacteria was much lower. This clearly indicated a close phylogenetic relationship between the plastids of Rhodophyta and Chromophyta which seem to have evolved independently from the chloroplasts (polyphyletic origin). Our data suggest that the plastids of Chromophyta and Cryptophyta have originated from endosymbiotic unicellular red algae. Surprisingly, red and brown algal Rubiscos show a significantly higher degree of homology to that from a hydrogen bacterium than to those from cyanobacteria.
