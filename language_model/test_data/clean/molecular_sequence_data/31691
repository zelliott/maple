Scutellarin from Erigeron breviscapus is a flavonoid with remarkable pharmacological activity, whose route of biosynthesis is still fully clear. Chalcone synthase (CHS) is the key enzyme regulating flavonoids biosynthesis, and the aim of this study is to explain the relationship between patterns of the gene expression and scutellarin content through studying CHS gene expression patterns combined with scutellarin content in various parts of E. breviscapus.

Through RT-PCR and RACE, the full length of CHS was cloned and analyzed by fluorescent quantitative PCR. The scutellarin content in tissues was analyzed by HPLC.

The full-length gene sequence was 1 270 bp, encoding 405 amino acids. Software analysis found that the DNA sequence was 80% similarity with Compositae plant homeo-box gene. Fluorescence quantitative analysis showed that CHS had the highest expression level in leaves, far higher than that in root, stem and flower. HPLC analysis showed that the scutellarin was the highest in leaves, followed by the flowers and stems, scutellarin was not detected in root.

Correlation analysis showed that CHS expression amount and scutellarin content in different parts of E. breviscapus is positive correlation (r = 0.761, P < 0.05), it suggests that CHS gene expression level has important effect on biosynthesis of scutellarin.
