The mechanisms of perception of arsenic (As)-induced stress and ensuing tolerance in plants remain unresolved. To obtain an insight into these mechanisms, biochemical and transcriptional profiling of two contrasting genotypes of Brassica juncea was performed. After screening 14 varieties for As tolerance, one tolerant (TPM-1) and one sensitive (TM-4) variety were selected and exposed to arsenate [As(V)] and arsenite [As(III)] for 7 d and 15 d for biochemical analyses. The tolerant variety (TPM-1) demonstrated higher accumulation of As upon exposure to both 500 microM As(V) and 250 microM As(III) [49 microg g(-1) and 37 microg g(-1) dry weight (dw) after 15 d] as well as a better response of thiol metabolism as compared with the responses observed in the sensitive variety (TM-4). Transcriptional profiling of selected genes that are known to be responsive to sulphur depletion and/or metal(loid) stress was conducted in 15-d-old seedlings after 3 h and 6 h exposure to 250 microM As(III). The results showed an up-regulation of sulphate transporters and auxin and jasmonate biosynthesis pathway genes, whereas there was a down-regulation of ethylene biosynthesis and cytokinin-responsive genes in TPM-1 within 6 h of exposure to As(III). This suggested that perception of As-induced stress was presumably mediated through an integrated modulation in hormonal functioning that led to both short- and long-term adaptations to combat the stress. Such a coordinated response of hormones was not seen in the sensitive variety. In conclusion, an early perception of As-induced stress followed by coordinated responses of various pathways was responsible for As tolerance in TPM-1.
