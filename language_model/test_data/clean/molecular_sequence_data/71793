A gene encoding a putative membrane protein has been identified from Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168 following an immuno-screen of a lambda ZAP II genomic DNA library with antiserum raised against glycine-extractable proteins. The nucleotide sequence of the entire genomic insert revealed six open reading frames, all but one of which have sequence homologues in the complete genome sequence of Helicobacter pylori. The gene encoding the immuno-reactive protein was further identified by independent expression of these reading frames in Escherichia coli. The gene encodes an integral membrane protein, expression of which in E. coli results in a profound filamentous phenotype.
