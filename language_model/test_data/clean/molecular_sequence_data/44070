The extensively glycosylated lysosome-associated membrane proteins (LAMP)-2a, b, and c are derived from a single gene by alternative splicing that produces proteins with differences in the transmembrane and cytosolic domains. The lysosomal targeting signals reside in the cytosolic domain of these proteins. LAMPs are not restricted to lysosomes but can also be found in endosomes and at the cell surface. We investigated the subcellular distribution of chimeras comprised of the lumenal domain of avian LAMP-1 and the alternatively spliced domains of avian LAMP-2. Chimeras with the LAMP-2c cytosolic domain showed predominantly lysosomal distribution, while higher levels of chimeras with the LAMP-2a or b cytosolic domain were present at the cell surface. The increase in cell surface expression was due to differences in the recognition of the targeting signals and not saturation of intracellular trafficking machinery. Site-directed mutagenesis defined the COOH-terminal residue of the cytosolic tail as critical in governing the distributions of LAMP-2a, b, and c between intracellular compartments and the cell surface.
