The properties of the purified recombinant PPi-dependent 6-phosphofructokinases (PPi-PFKs) from the methanotroph Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b and rhizospheric phytosymbiont Methylobacterium nodulans ORS 2060 were determined. The dependence of activities of PPi-PFK-His(6)-tag from Ms. trichosporium OB3b (6 × 45 kDa) and PPi-PFK from Mb. nodulans ORS 2060 (4 × 43 kDa) on the concentrations of substrates of forward and reverse reactions conformed to Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Besides fructose-6-phosphate, the enzymes also phosphorylated sedoheptulose-7-phosphate. ADP or AMP (1 mM each) inhibited activity of the Ms. trichosporium PPi-PFK but did not affect the activity of the Mb. nodulans enzyme. Preference of PPi-PFKs to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate implied a predominant function of the enzymes in hexose phosphate synthesis in these bacteria. PPi-PFKs from the methylotrophs have low similarity of translated amino acid sequences (17% identity) and belong to different phylogenetic subgroups of type II 6-phosphofructokinases. The relationship of PPi-PFKs with microaerophilic character of Ms. trichosporium OB3b and adaptation of Mb. nodulans ORS 2060 to anaerobic phase of phytosymbiosis are discussed.
