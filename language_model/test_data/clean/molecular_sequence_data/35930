cDNA clones encoding three types of Gi alpha, the alpha subunit of GTP-binding protein (Gi1 alpha, Gi2 alpha, and Gi3 alpha), were isolated from a cDNA library of the guinea-pig lung. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a high degree of homology with other mammalian Gi alpha cDNAs. By RNA blot analysis, the expression pattern of Gi1 alpha was more tissue-specific than those of other types of Gi alphas in the guinea-pig tissues examined. While Gi2 alpha and Gi3 alpha mRNAs were ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined, Gi1 alpha mRNA was mainly expressed in the brain, lung and kidney. These results suggest that each Gi alpha protein may have a different role.
