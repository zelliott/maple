Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is one of the most devastating soil-inhabiting fungal plant pathogens infecting various crop plants including chickpea. Genetic diversity of 24 isolates of S. sclerotiorum representing 10 different states of India was determined by different molecular markers and mycelial compatibility grouping (MCG). The majority of the isolates showed more than 90% genetic similarity. Unweighted paired group method with arithmetic average cluster analysis of DNA profiles generated by 21 RAPD primers grouped the isolates into seven categories showing high magnitude of genetic homogeneity and showed partial correlation with geographical origin of the isolates. Identical ITS-RFLP profiles were generated in all the isolates. Limited variability was observed among the nucleotide sequences of ITS region of the isolates. The phylogenetic tree generated from bootstrap neighbor-joining analysis indicated that 50% of Indian populations were distinct and grouped separately. The isolates were variable in mycelial compatibility and they were grouped into seven MCGs, namely, MCG A, MCG B, MCG C, MCG D, MCG E, MCG F and MCG G.
