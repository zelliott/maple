The expression of FGFR 1, 2 and 3 but not FGFR 4 was detected in bovine lens epithelial cells. FGFR 1 expression of both the 2-lg and 3-lg forms was detected by a difference in the lengths of the PCR products. Furthermore, mRNA which included or excluded six nucleotides corresponding to two amino acids in the acid box region of FGFR 1 was detected by a difference in mobility of the homo- and hetero-duplex strands formed in the PCR reaction.
