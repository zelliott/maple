An antiserum against a hsp of the 70-kDa family was prepared, by means of a fusion protein, which was able to detect a constitutive 75-kDa hsc in the sea urchin P. lividus. This hsc was present both during oogenesis and at all developmental stages. A two-dimensional electrophoresis has revealed four isolectric forms of this 75-kDa hsc. The amino acid sequence of the fragment used to prepare the anti-hsp70 antibodies revealed a 43% identity with the corresponding part of sea urchin sperm receptor, and in mature eggs a brighter immunofluorescence was seen all around the cell cortex where the receptor for sea urchin sperm is localized. In oocytes the hsp75 was localized in the cytoplasms but not in the nuclei. In the embryos a higher hsp75 concentration was found in the portion facing the lumen of the cells which invaginate at gastrulation.
