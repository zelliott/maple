In the course of a survey of yeast biodiversity in the natural substrates in Thailand, eight strains were found to represent three hitherto undescribed species of Hanseniaspora/Kloeckera. They were isolated from insect frass, flower, lichen, rotted fruit and rotted wood. Based on the morphological and physiological characteristics, and sequences of D1/D2 domain, six strains represent a single species of the genus Hanseniaspora, described as Hanseniaspora thailandica sp. nov. (type BCC 14938(T)=NBRC 104216(T)=CBS 10841(T)), and another strain as Hanseniaspora singularis sp. nov. (type BCC 15001(T)=NBRC 104214(T)=CBS 10840(T)). A further strain, which belongs to Kloeckera and does not produce ascospores, is described as Kloeckera hatyaiensis sp. nov. (type BCC 14939(T)=NBRC 104215(T)=CBS 10842(T)). Strains belonging to H. thailandica sp. nov. differed by 17-19 nucleotide substitutions from Hanseniaspora meyeri, the closest species. DNA reassociation between the two taxa showed 30-48% relatedness. Kloeckera hatyaiensis sp. nov. and H. singularis sp. nov. differed by eight and 16 nucleotide substitutions with one gap from the nearest species, Hanseniaspora clermontiae and Hanseniaspora valbyensis, respectively.
