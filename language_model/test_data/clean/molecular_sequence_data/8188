In this report the effects of single doses of ionizing radiation on the mRNA expression of several proteins involved in multiple drug resistance were analyzed. Murine NIH 3T3 cells treated with single doses of 5, 10 and 20 Gy during the time interval from 1.5 to 72 h after irradiation were compared with their corresponding controls at the same points of time. The glutathione S-transferase-pi (GST pi) level was elevated in cells treated with 10 or 20 Gy from 24 to 72 h after irradiation compared with the control. Topoisomerase II alpha and thymidylate synthase were decreased in irradiated cells 24-72 h after exposure. These down-regulations were associated with cellular proliferation, determined by mRNA expression of the proliferation marker histone 3. Irradiated cells exhibited no alteration in the P-glycoprotein or glutathione peroxidase mRNA content. The finding that GST pi mRNA was overexpressed after irradiation was validated by investigations on a human lung carcinoma cell line (LXF 289) on the mRNA and protein level. Thus, our results indicate that irradiation alters the expression of proteins involved in multidrug resistance and may, therefore, play a role in clinical drug response.
