A new fast and reliable approach for construction of concatemeric synthetic genes is described. The method consists of shotgun polymerization of three truncated monomeric gene units using a specific linker, followed by cloning of the recombinant clones and screening them for the presence of concatemeric genes of defined length. The method is illustrated by constructing a series of tandemly repeated human calcitonin (hCT) genes.
