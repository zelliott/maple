The chromosomal DNA of the syntrophic thermophile Symbiobacterium thermophilum contains open reading frames of the genes encoding family M42 aminopeptidases, Pep1079, Pep1080, and Pep1081. To characterize these peptidases, the genes were cloned into Escherichia coli and overexpressed. Our experiments using the recombinant proteins confirmed that Pep1079, Pep1080, and Pep1081 are components of arginyl or lysinyl aminopeptidases that require CoÂ²+ for enzymatic activity. Coexistence of Pep1079 and Pep1080 is necessary for expressing high peptidase activity. Pep1081 enhances the activity of Pep1079 and Pep1080.
