The mer genes, which encode the coenzyme F420-dependent N5,N10-methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductases (CH2 = H4MPT reductases), and their flanking regions have been cloned from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum delta H and Methanopyrus kandleri and sequenced. The mer genes have DNA sequences that are 57% identical and encode polypeptides with amino acid sequences that are 57% identical and 71% similar, with calculated molecular masses of 33.6 and 37.5 kDa, respectively. In M. thermoautotrophicum, mer transcription has been shown to initiate 10 bp upstream from the ATG translation initiating codon and to generate a monocistronic transcript approximately 1 kb in length. This transcript was synthesized at all stages of M. thermoautotrophicum delta H growth in batch cultures but was found to increase in abundance from the earliest stages of exponential growth, reaching a maximum level at the mid-exponential growth phase. For comparison, transcription of the ftr gene from M. thermoautotrophicum delta H that encodes the formylmethanofuran:tetrahydromethanopterin formyltransferase (A. A. DiMarco, K. A. Sment, J. Konisky, and R. S. Wolfe, J. Biol. Chem. 265:472-476, 1990) was included in this study. The ftr transcript was found similarly to be monocistronic and to be approximately 1 kb in length, but, in contrast to the mer transcript, the ftr transcript was present at maximum levels at both the early and the mid-exponential growth stages.
