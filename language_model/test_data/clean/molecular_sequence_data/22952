The core protein of pestiviruses is released from the polyprotein by viral and cellular proteinases. Here we report on an additional intramembrane proteolytic step that generates the C terminus of the core protein. C-terminal processing of the core protein of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) was blocked by the inhibitor (Z-LL)(2)-ketone, which is specific for signal peptide peptidase (SPP). The same effect was obtained by overexpression of the dominant-negative SPP D(265)A mutant. The presence of (Z-LL)(2)-ketone reduced the viability of CSFV almost 100-fold in a concentration-dependent manner. Reduction of virus viability was also observed in infection experiments using a cell line that inducibly expressed SPP D(265)A. The position of SPP cleavage was determined by C-terminal sequencing of core protein purified from virions. The C terminus of CSFV core protein is alanine(255) and is located in the hydrophobic center of the signal peptide. The intramembrane generation of the C terminus of the CSFV core protein is almost identical to the processing scheme of the core protein of hepatitis C viruses.
