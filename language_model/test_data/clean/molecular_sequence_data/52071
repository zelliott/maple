Cholecystokinin represents a family of gut hormones which among other activities, have been proposed to participate in satiety signaling. Ac-CCK-7[Ac-Tyr(SO3H)-Met-Gly-Trp30-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2 (2)] possesses the full spectrum of activity and potency of the intact hormone; thus analogs of 2 may be useful as anorectic agents. A series of derivatives has been prepared in which the tryptophan indole moiety of 2 has been modified. The new compounds were assayed in CCK binding assays using homogenated rat pancreatic membranes and bovine striatum as a source of CCK-A and CCK-B receptors respectively and in vivo in rats for anorectic activity. Although previous studies have concluded that the indole ring of Trp30 is a critical pharmacophore for the interaction of CCK with both its A and B type receptors, we find 2-Nal30-Ac-CCK-7 (20) to be nearly equipotent to 2 in both CCK binding and as an anorectic agent sensitive to blockade by the Merck CCK-A receptor antagonist MK-329. The extreme structural sensitivity of this anorectic activity is illustrated by the 1-naphthylalanine30 (19) and (benzo[b]thien-2-yl)alanine30 (21) analogs which are 30 and 100 times less potent than 2 respectively. Other mono- and bicyclic Trp30 replacements, including substituted phenylalanines, 3-quinolinylalanine, and 2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro)naphthylalanine, gave inactive compounds.
