The Insulin-like Growth Factors (IGFs) or Somatomedins are polypeptide growth factors which are similar to insulin in respect to their aminoacid sequence, structure and biologic activities. The IGFs bind to high affinity receptors which are present on many cells and in many tissues. In the circulation the IGFs are bound to transport (binding) proteins (IGF-BPs). In this review the physiologic role, the basic chemistry and the gene expression of this family of growth factors is summarized systematically. The pathophysiology of growth disorders, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, liver and kidney disease in relation to the IGFs as well as the therapeutic and diagnostic potentials of these peptides are discussed in detail.
