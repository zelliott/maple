Cytochrome P-450scc from bovine adrenal cortex mitochondria was shown to be selectively phosphorylated by protein kinase C. The amino acid residues most accessible to phosphorylation by protein kinase C are located in the N-terminal sequence of cytochrome P-450scc. Adrenodoxin and cytochrome b5 protect cytochrome P-450scc from phosphorylation, this effect being dependent on the protein concentration.
