A telomere YAC clone containing the most distal 115 kb of chromosome arm 4p has been previously isolated. This clone is of particular interest as it spans a potential candidate region for the Huntington disease gene. The YAC was subcloned into a phage vector, and a high-resolution restriction map extending to within 13 kb of the telomere was constructed. In situ hybridization of the YAC to human metaphase spreads gives a peak of hybridization on 4pter but also an increase in the number of signals close to several other telomeres. Where possible, these results were investigated further by the hybridization of probes from the YAC to somatic cell hybrids containing single human chromosomes. This analysis indicates that the most telomeric 60 kb of chromosome arm 4p is homologous to telomeric regions on 13p, 15p, 21p, and 22p. The extent of this homology makes it less likely that the mutation for Huntington's disease is located within the telomere YAC clone.
