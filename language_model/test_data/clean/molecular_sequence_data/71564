The effect of immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA) on inward-rectifying K(+)-channels and biochemical analysis have indicated the presence of cyclophilin in guard cells of Vicia faba. In this study, we identified a full-length cDNA sequence, vcCyP, encoding cyclophilin (CyP), a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase of guard cell protoplasts (GCPs) from Vicia faba L. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed that vcCyP contained 171 amino acid residues and exhibited a strong similarity to previously described cytosolic CyP isoforms from other plants. vcCyP had seven extra amino acid residues, which is a characteristic of the cytosolic form of plant CyPs. A complex of recombinant vcCyP and CsA inhibited the phosphatase activity of bovine calcineurin, a type 2B protein phosphatase, with a half-inhibitory concentration of 0.2 microM. Protein phosphatase activity was measured in the cytosolic fraction of GCPs using a 32P-labeled myelin basic protein (32P-MBP) and the activity was increased by a physiological concentration of Ca2+ (1 microM). This Ca(2+)-stimulated phosphatase activity was inhibited by CsA, suggesting the presence of both cytosolic CyP and calcineurin-like protein phosphatase in guard cells. Northern blot analysis showed that the transcription level of vcCyP was much higher in GCPs than in root and leaf tissues of Vicia.
