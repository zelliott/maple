Glucose transfer from mother to fetus by placental facilitated diffusion is the dominant mechanism by which the fetus acquires glucose. In small for gestational age pregnancies, fetal glucose concentrations tend to be lower than normal and this persists following delivery. GLUT1 is the major glucose transporter in human placenta but there is no evidence of GLUT1 deficiency as a cause of the lower fetal glucose concentration in small for gestational age pregnancy. The physiological and pathological roles of the other glucose transporters (and there are 14 currently described) are unknown. In recent years, the possibility has been raised that the placenta is itself capable of supplying glucose for fetal needs. This hypothesis derived from glucose isotope studies in normal pregnancy, where dilution of glucose isotope was demonstrated in blood samples taken from the fetal circulation during intravenous infusion of glucose isotope in the mother. Although other gluconeogenic enzymes were known to be present, the placenta was previously considered incapable of glucose secretion because it lacked functional glucose-6-phosphatase. Recent studies, however, have suggested that specific glucose-6-phosphatase may be present in placenta but it may be the product of a different gene from conventional hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase. The presence of the specific transporters necessary for glucose-6-phosphatase activity is currently being investigated. The role of placental glucose secretion in normal and growth-restricted pregnancies is an area of current study.
