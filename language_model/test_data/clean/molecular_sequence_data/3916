Autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (EPT; OMIM 600512) is a form of epilepsy characterized by partial seizures, usually preceded by auditory signs. The gene for this disorder has been mapped by linkage studies to chromosomal region 10q24. Here we show that mutations in the LGI1 gene segregate with EPT in two families affected by this disorder. Both mutations introduce premature stop codons and thus prevent the production of the full-length protein from the affected allele. By immunohistochemical studies, we demonstrate that the LGI1 protein, which contains several leucine-rich repeats, is expressed ubiquitously in the neuronal cell compartment of the brain. Moreover, we provide evidence for genetic heterogeneity within this disorder, since several other families with a phenotype consistent with this type of epilepsy lack mutations in the LGI1 gene.
