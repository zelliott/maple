Paneth cells are located at the bases of intestinal crypts, and their cytoplasmic granules contain large amounts of zinc. We previously showed that administration of diphenylthiocarbazone (dithizone), a zinc chelater, to rats induced the selective death of Paneth cells. This was followed by a transient wave of epithelial cell proliferation in the entire crypts. In the study described here, we again applied this experimental model in an attempt to identify novel growth-promoting factors in the small intestine. Male Wistar rats were injected with dithizone and killed 6 hr later. Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were extracted from the terminal ileum for the construction of a cDNA library. This library was then transfected into the human intestinal cell line Caco-2, and the cells that continued to grow in the medium containing only 1% FBS were cloned. One of the cDNA sequences identified from those transfection experiments was the full-length rat thioredoxin (TRX) gene. To confirm the growth-promoting effect of this cDNA, we transfected it into Caco-2 cells again. These clones proliferated in the medium containing only 1% FBS, while the control clones failed to show any growth. Transient oxidative stress exerted by the addition of oxidative reagents diamide and hydrogen peroxide partially suppressed the growth of TRX-transfected cells. Northern hybridization analysis revealed that TRX expression in rat ileum after dithizone treatment was altered in accordance with intestinal epithelial regeneration in the crypts. Single-cell RT-PCR also showed TRX mRNA expression in Paneth cells. These studies identify rat thioredoxin as a growth-promoting factor for intestinal epithelial cells.
