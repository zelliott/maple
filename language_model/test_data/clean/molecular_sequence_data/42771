Using reverse transcriptase-linked polymerase chain reaction, the effect of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 gene expression in cultured human keratinocytes was studied. Exposure to beta-naphthoflavone and benz(a)anthracene resulted in a higher copy number of IL-1 alpha and IL-6 mRNA while lower level of IL-1 beta mRNA was detected in these cells. These data suggest that, like ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, ubiquitous environmental carcinogenic PAHs are potent inducers of IL-1 alpha and IL-6 cytokines and, unlike UVB, they downregulate IL-1 beta in human keratinocytes.
