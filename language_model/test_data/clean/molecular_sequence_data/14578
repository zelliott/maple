A PCR-based assay was developed to discriminate the classical, El Tor, and Haitian types of ctxB alleles. Our retrospective study using this newly developed PCR showed that Haitian ctxB first appeared in Kolkata during April 2006, and 93.3% of strains isolated during 2011 carried the new allele. Dendrogram analysis showed a pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern of the new variant strains isolated recently that was distinct from the PFGE pattern of the strains carrying classical ctxB that closely matched the 2006 to 2007 variant strains.
