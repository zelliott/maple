N-Terminal tetrapeptide analogs of fibrin alpha-chain were synthesized by the solution method using a new active ester, the ester of the oxime of p-nitroacetophenone, and by the solid-phase method. Their inhibitory effects on fibrinogen/thrombin clotting were examined. Of the synthetic peptides, amide analogs of Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro exhibited a more potent inhibitory effect.
