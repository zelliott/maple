Human genomic clones encompassing the tissue specific expressed gene IBP-1, an insulin-like growth factor binding protein were isolated and characterized. The gene is organized in four exons and spans 5.9 kb. S1 nuclease analysis determined a single transcription start site. The first exon and 5' flanking region are highly GC rich and located in a CpG island. The CpG island enclose the CAAT box, the TATA box, the transcription start site and a potential SP1 transcription factor binding site. The presumptive promoter region is characteristic for genes expressed in a tissue specific fashion. All signals required for cleavage/polyadenylation are located within exon IV, predicting a mRNA of 1.5 kb which is consistent with the size seen on RNA blots.
