An unusual catalase-positive pleomorphic Gram-positive rod isolated from a human clinical specimen was subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic analysis. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed the unknown bacterium was a member of the high G+C branch of the Gram-positive bacteria (Actinobacteria), and was phylogenetically a member of the family Propionibacteriaceae, with Luteococcus japonicus as its nearest relative. Based on both phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium be classified in the genus Luteococcus, as Luteococcus peritonei sp. nov. The type strain of Luteococcus peritonei is CCUG 38120T.
