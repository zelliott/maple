The infection rate of 60 pigs (10 pigs from each of six farms) by Helicobacter species was studied by two techniques. Histological examination of the cardiac area of the stomach yielded a 58% positive result versus an 80% positive result by PCR with genus-specific primers. Eighty percent of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified, classified in four groups by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism, and sequenced. Isolates from all farms except one (farm C) were identified as Helicobacter heilmannii type 1, while those from farm C were identified as H. heilmannii type 2. Attempts to culture this organism in vitro failed. Helicobacter pylori was not found in these animals.
