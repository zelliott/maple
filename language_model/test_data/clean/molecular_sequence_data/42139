Glucocorticosteroids are highly effective in controlling inflammation and the molecular mechanisms involved are now becoming clear. Activation of glucocorticoid receptors results in increased or decreased transcription of a number of genes involved in the inflammatory process. Of particular importance is the repression of cytokine gene transcription and the direct interaction between the glucocorticoid receptor and other transcription factors activated in chronic inflammation. In this review, Peter Barnes and Ian Adcock discuss recent studies that have increased our understanding of these mechanisms and that may lead to improved anti-inflammatory therapies in the future.
