We cloned and expressed a full-length cDNA encoding a phospholipase D of type alpha (PLDalpha) from cabbage. Analysis of the cDNA predicted an 812-amino-acid protein of 92.0 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of cabbage PLD has 83% and 80% identity with Arabidopsis PLDalpha and castor bean PLD, respectively. Expression of this cDNA clone in E. coli shows a functional PLD activity similar to that of the natural PLD.
