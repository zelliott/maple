Adenylosuccinate synthetase (ADSS) catalyzes the key step of AMP synthesis. Vertebrates have two isozymes of ADSS, which are named ADSS1 and ADSS2, respectively. In this study, we cloned porcine ADSS1 and ADSS2 genes and comparatively analyzed their sequence, chromosome mapping, mRNA distribution and subcellular localization. According to our results, the ADSS1 gene was predominantly expressed in the striated muscle tissues, while ADSS2 gene distributed widely in all the tissues detected. Additionally, ADSS1 gene was up-regulated significantly along with porcine muscle growth, and ADSS2 gene expression was more constant during the muscle development. Porcine ADSS1 gene was assigned to SSC7q and the linked marker was SSC12B09, ADSS2 gene was mapped on SSC10p and the linked marker was SW497, and porcine ADSS2 protein was subcellular localized in mitochondria. Moreover, we found that one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, T/C(70)) in the ninth intron of ADSS2 gene was significantly associated with average daily gain trait (ADG, P<0.05) and loin muscle area trait (P<0.05).
