A chloroplastic NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase gene was identified from Chlorella vulgaris and designated CvNTRC. Mature CvNTRC protein (mCvNTRC) was expressed in Escherichia coli, and it showed both NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase (NTR) and thioredoxin (Trx)-like dithiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activities. The transcript of CvNTRC increased throughout 24-h hardening, whereas the encoded protein amount and total NTR activity decreased once and then increased during hardening. By in vitro pull-down assay, a 21.2-kDa protein bound to mCvNTRC was isolated and identified as a 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (2-Cys Prx) based on the N-terminal sequence. These data suggest that CvNTRC is maintained at a constant level during hardening and functions as an antioxidant with 2-Cys Prx in the acquisition of freezing tolerance of Chlorella.
