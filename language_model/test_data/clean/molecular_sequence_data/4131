From the antennae of the moth Mamestra brassicae, we have identified a lepidopteran G protein alpha subunit belonging to the Gq family, through immunological detection in crude antennal extract and antennal primary cell cultures, followed by molecular cloning. The complete cDNA sequence (1540 bp) contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 353 amino acids. This deduced sequence possesses all of the characteristics of the Gq family and shares a very high degree of amino-acid sequence identity with vertebrate (80% with mouse or human Gqalpha) and invertebrate subunits (varying between 60 and 87% for Gqalpha from organisms as diverse as sponge and Drosophila). The expression pattern of the Gq subunit in adult antennae was associated with the olfactory sensilla suggesting a specific role in olfaction. These data provide molecular evidence for a component of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in moth antennae: this G protein alpha subunit may be involved in the olfaction transduction process through interaction with G-protein-coupled receptors, stimulating the phospholipase C mediated second messenger pathway.
