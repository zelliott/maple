Streptomyces globisporus C-1027 is the producer of antitumor antibiotic C-1027, a nine-membered enediyne-containing compound. Here we present a draft genome sequence of S. globisporus C-1027 containing the intact biosynthetic gene cluster for this antibiotic. The genome also carries numerous sets of genes for the biosynthesis of diverse secondary metabolites.
