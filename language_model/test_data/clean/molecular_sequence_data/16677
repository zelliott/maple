The Asteridae is one of the most successful clades of flowering plants comprising some 80,000 species. Despite this diversity, analysis of seeds from 398 species (representing 8 orders, 32 families and 181 genera) showed just two major types of serine proteinase inhibitors (PI). PIs of the potato inhibitor I family were widely distributed. These had M(r) of 7000-7500 and were inhibitory to subtilisin and one or more other proteinases (but only rarely elastase). The second major group was TI related to the well-characterised Bowman-Birk inhibitors of legume seeds but these varied widely in their sequences and structure. In addition to these two groups of inhibitors, seeds of the Solanaceae also often contained PI of the potato inhibitor II family while some other asterids contained inhibitors whose relationships were not established.
