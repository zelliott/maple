Streptococcal erythrogenic toxin type A (ET-A) was purified from culture filtrate of Streptococcus pyogenes strain NY-5 grown in a chemically defined synthetic medium NCTC-135. We succeeded in simplifying the purification procedure, and obtained a highly purified preparation of ET-A. The purification procedure was the combination of ultrafiltration with Amicon PM-10 and YM-10 membranes, chromatofocusing with PBE-94 exchanger (pH 4.0-6.0), and gel filtration through Sephacryl S-200. The purified toxin protein showed a single band with Mr 28,000 on SDS-PAGE and had pI 5.2 on agarose IEF. HPLC chromatography pattern of the toxin revealed one symmetric peak. The result of amino acid analysis of the toxin was in accordance with that of Gerlach et al and with Weeks and Ferretti who reported the nucleotide sequence of the spe A gene. Biological activities of the purified toxin were remarkably potent. The mitogenic activity for rabbit lymphocytes and one skin test dose in rabbit were found at the lower dose of 10 pg and 1 ng of the toxin, respectively.
