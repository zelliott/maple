Two versatile shuttle vectors for Thermus thermophilus and Escherichia coli were developed on the basis of the T. thermophilus cryptic plasmid pTT8 and E. coli vector pUC13. These shuttle vectors, pTRK1T and pTRH1T, carry a gene encoding a protein homologous to replication protein derived from pTT8, a replicon for E. coli, new multiple cloning sites and a lacZÎ± gene from E. coli vector pUC13, and also have a gene encoding a thermostable protein that confers resistance to kanamycin or hygromycin, which can be used as a selection marker in T. thermophilus. These shuttle vectors are useful to develop enzymes and proteins of biotechnological interest. We also constructed a plasmid, pUC13T, which carries the same multiple cloning sites of pTRK1T and pTRH1T. These vectors should facilitate cloning procedures both in E. coli and T. thermophilus.
