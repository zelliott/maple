A region of the mitochondrial genome associated with cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in Phaseolus vulgaris was flanked by two different repeated sequences designated x and y. The DNA sequence of the CMS-unique region and a portion of each flanking repeat was determined. Repeat x contained a complete coding copy of the F1 ATPase subunit A (atpA) gene, as well as an open reading frame (orf) predicting a protein of 209 amino acids. The TGA termination codon of the atpA gene and the ATG initiation codon of orf209 were overlapping. These reading frames were oriented with their 3' ends proximal to the CMS-unique region. The CMS-unique region of 3736 nucleotides contained numerous orfs. The longest of these predicted proteins being of 239, 98 and 97 amino acids. The 3' coding and 3' flanking regions of orf98 were derived from an internal region of the higher plant chloroplast tRNA alanine intron. The region of repeat y immediately adjacent to the CMS-unique region contained the 111 carboxy-terminal coding residues of the apocytochrome b (cob) gene. This segment was oriented with its 5' end proximal to the CMS-unique region, but cob gene sequences were not fused to an initiation codon within the unique region.
