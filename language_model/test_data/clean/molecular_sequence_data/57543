Of the stroma-accessible proteins of photosystem I (PSI) from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, the PSI-C, PSI-D and PSI-E subunits have already been characterized, and the corresponding genes isolated. PCR amplification and cassette mutagenesis were used in this work to delete the psaE gene. PSI particles were isolated from this mutant, which lacks subunit PSI-E, and the direct photoreduction of ferredoxin was investigated by flash absorption spectroscopy. The second order rate constant for reduction of ferredoxin by wild type PSI was estimated to be approximately 10(9) M-1s-1. Relative to the wild type, PSI lacking PSI-E exhibited a rate of ferredoxin reduction decreased by a factor of at least 25. After reassociation of the purified PSI-E polypeptide, the original rate of electron transfer was recovered. When a similar reconstitution was performed with a PSI-E polypeptide from spinach, an intermediate rate of reduction was observed. Membrane labeling of the native PSI with fluorescein isothiocyanate allowed the isolation of a fluorescent PSI-E subunit. Peptide analysis showed that some residues following the N-terminal sequence were labeled and thus probably accessible to the stroma, whereas both N- and C-terminal ends were probably buried in the photosystem I complex. Site-directed mutagenesis based on these observations confirmed that important changes in either of the two terminal sequences of the polypeptide impaired its correct integration in PSI, leading to phenotypes identical to the deleted mutant. Less drastic modifications in the predicted stroma exposed sequences did not impair PSI-E integration, and the ferredoxin photoreduction was not significantly affected. All these results lead us to propose a structural role for PSI-E in the correct organization of the site involved in ferredoxin photoreduction.
