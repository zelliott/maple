It has been known that Porphyromonas gingivalis has an obligate requirement for hemin or selected heme- or Fe-containing compounds for its growth. In addition, the influence of hemin on the expression of several putative virulence factors produced by this bacterium has also been recently documented; however, the mechanisms involved in hemin uptake are poorly defined. We succeeded in cloning the gene coding for the 35-kDa protein, which was specifically expressed in P. gingivalis and seemed to confer colonizing activities. Recently, we have constructed the P. gingivalis 381 mutant defective in the 35-kDa protein by insertion mutagenesis. The beige mutant exhibited little co-aggregation and the virulence was also decreased. Based on these results and homology search analysis, we focused on assessing the hemin bindings and found the heme regulatory motif (HRM) as a hemin direct binding site. The 35-kDa protein did possess the binding ability of selected protoporphyrins involving the hemin. These results demonstrated that 35-kDa protein is one of the hemin binding proteins in P. gingivalis and suggested that hemin binding ability of 35-kDa protein is important for the expression of virulence in P. gingivalis.
