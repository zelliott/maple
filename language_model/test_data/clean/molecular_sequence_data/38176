The chromosome location and pattern of expression of the gene encoding the zinc finger protein 265 (alias "Zis") in human (ZNF265) and mouse (Zfp265) was determined. By interspecific backcross analysis, we mapped Zfp265 to mouse chromosome 3q. ZNF265 was localized to human chromosome 1p31 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Since discovery of Zfp265 (in rat) came from studies of changes in renin expression in kidney cell lines, we examined the cell specificity of expression in kidney and also determined hybridization of cDNA with RNA in other tissues. We found that expression was not confined to renin mRNA-containing cells but was ubiquitous. Moreover, the fact that highly conserved homologs of ZNF265p exist in lower organisms (e.g., C4SR in Xenopus), suggests that this protein may have a generalized role in posttranscriptional mechanisms in various cell types and species.
