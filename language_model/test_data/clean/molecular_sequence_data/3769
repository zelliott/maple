Bacterial DNA and oligonucleotides (ODN) containing CpG-motifs strongly activate cells of the immune system. Accordingly CpG-DNA is a powerful adjuvant in vaccination protocols for B-cell as well as for cytotoxic T-cell responses. A decisive propensity of CpG-DNA is its capacity to induce preferentially T helper type 1 (Th1)-dominated immune responses. To exert its function CpG-DNA has to be taken up by responsive cells, e.g. antigen-presenting cells (APC). The rate of uptake is influenced by the DNA's backbone modification and critically determines activity of CpG-DNA. CpG ODN with a phosphothioate backbone (PTO) are currently used for most in vivo and in vitro studies, since PTO modification protects ODN from the attack of nucleases. However, after administration of PTO-modified CpG-ODN long-lasting effects including lymphadenopathy as well as sustained local interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) production have been reported. To circumvent these restrictions we investigated the effects of DNA sequence as well as DNA backbone modification on cellular uptake and resulting immunostimulation. We show here that uptake of phosphodiester (PO)-CpG-ODN can be strongly enhanced by poly guanosine runs added at the 3' end of the ODN. In addition these ODN showed an improved immunostimulatory activity in vivo and in vitro. This included protection of mice against lethal Th2-dependent leishmaniasis as well as priming of antigen specific Th1 responses. More importantly, guanosine-rich PO-CpG-ODN neither induced lymphadenopathy nor prolonged cytokine production after local administration. Since these improved PO ODN are efficient in vitro and in vivo and lack long lasting undesired effects they could be used preferably as adjuvants in vaccination protocols.
