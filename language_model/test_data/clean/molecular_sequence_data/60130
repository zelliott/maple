Granzyme B is a cytotoxic lymphocyte granule serine proteinase that is pivotal in the induction of target cell apoptosis. Here we describe the expression of recombinant human granzyme B in Pichia pastoris as a chimeric zymogen comprising the alpha-factor signal sequence, a prodomain including an enterokinase cleavage site, and the mature granzyme B sequence followed by a hexahistidine tag. Inactive zymogen is purified from the medium by immobilized cobalt chelate affinity chromatography and then activated by enterokinase (final yield is approximately 1 mg per liter). The recombinant enzyme resembles native granzyme B in size and glycosylation, hydrolyzes the substrate Boc-Ala-Ala-Asp-thiobenzyl ester with equivalent efficiency (K(m) 82 microM; k(cat) 12 s(-1)), processes procaspase-3 to subunit form, and is inhibited by the cognate serpin PI-9. It efficiently induces DNA degradation and apoptosis of human cells. The availability of recombinant human granzyme B will facilitate further investigation of its structure and role in immune effector cells.
