In addition to monoglycosyl diacylglycerol, three glyceroglycolipids with two to four hexose units were isolated from Adzuki bean seeds. Their structures were determined using enzymatic hydrolysis, permethylation analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, as folows: Gal(beta 1----3')- for the monoglycosyl diacyglycerol, Gal(alpha 1----6)-Gal(beta 1----3')- and Gal(beta 1----6)-Gal(beta1----3')- for the diglycosyl diacylglycerol, [Gal(beta 1----6]2-Gal(beta 1----3')- and Gal(beta 1----6)-Gal(alpha 1----6)-Gal(beta 1----3')- for the triglycosyl diacylglycerol, and [Gal(beta 1----6)]3-Gal(beta 1----3')- and [Gal(beta 1----6)]2-Gal(alpha 1----6)-Gal(beta 1----3')- for the tetraglycosyl diacylglycerol. Except for Gal(alpha 1----6)-Gal(beta 1----3')-diacylglycerol, all of the glycolipids with oligosaccharide moieties had novel glycosidic linkage patterns differing from those in the well-known glyceroglycolipids in nature. The predominant diacylglycerol species component was characterized as dilinolenin. However, the molecular species composition of the diacylglycerol moieties of the two diglycosyl isomers with different glycosidic linkage patterns were found to be qualitatively the same but different quantitatively, as follows: in the well-known isomer Gal(alpha 1----6)-Gal(beta 1----3')-, 39% dilinolenin, 15% palmitoyl linolenin, and 14% linoleoyl linolenin; and in the novel isomer Gal(beta 1----6)-Gal(beta 1----3')-, 35% dilinolenin, 24% dilinolein, and 21% linoleoyl linolenin.
