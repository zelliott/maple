Several genomes of different Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates have been completely sequenced around the world. The genomic information obtained have shown higher diversity than originally thought and specific adaptations to different human populations. Within this work, we sequenced the genome of one Colombian M. tuberculosis virulent isolate. Genomic comparison against the reference genome of H37Rv and other strains showed multiple deletion and insertions that ranged between a few bases to thousands. Excluding PPE and PG-PGRS genes, 430 proteins present changes in at least 1 amino acid. Also, novel positions of the IS6110 mobile element were identified. This isolate is also characterized by a large genomic deletion of 3.6 kb, leading to the loss and modification of the dosR regulon genes, Rv1996 and Rv1997. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the genome sequence of a Latin American M. tuberculosis clinical isolate.
