Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) are two salmonid rhabdoviruses replicating at low temperatures (14 to 20 degrees C). Both viruses belong to the Novirhabdovirus genus, but they are only distantly related and do not cross antigenically. By using a recently developed reverse-genetic system based on IHNV (S. Biacchesi et al., J. Virol. 74:11247-11253, 2000), we investigated the ability to exchange IHNV glycoprotein G with that of VHSV. Thus, the IHNV genome was modified so that the VHSV G gene replaced the complete IHNV G gene. A recombinant virus expressing VHSV G instead of IHNV G, rIHNV-Gvhsv, was generated and was shown to replicate as well as the wild-type rIHNV in cell culture. This study was extended by exchanging IHNV G with that of a fish vesiculovirus able to replicate at high temperatures (up to 28 degrees C), the spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV). rIHNV-Gsvcv was successfully recovered; however, its growth was restricted to 14 to 20 degrees C. These results show the nonspecific sequence requirement for the insertion of heterologous glycoproteins into IHNV virions and also demonstrate that an IHNV protein other than the G protein is responsible for the low-temperature restriction on growth. To determine to what extent the matrix (M) protein interacts with G, a series of chimeric pIHNV constructs in which all or part of the M gene was replaced with the VHSV counterpart was engineered and used to recover the respective recombinant viruses. Despite the very low percentage (38%) of amino acid identity between the IHNV and VHSV matrix proteins, viable chimeric IHNVs, harboring either the matrix protein or both the glycoprotein and the matrix protein from VHSV, were recovered and propagated. Altogether, these data show the extreme flexibility of IHNV to accommodate heterologous structural proteins.
