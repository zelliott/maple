A taxonomic study was conducted on strain EM106(T), isolated from a sediment sample of the East Sea, Republic of Korea. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses showed that strain EM106(T) belongs to the family Flavobacteriaceae and is most closely related to Winogradskyella echinorum KMM 6211(T) and Winogradskyella ulvae KMM 6390(T) (97.8 and 97.3 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, respectively). The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain EM106(T) was 33.3 mol%, and the major respiratory quinone was menaquinone-6. The polar lipids of EM106(T) were phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified aminolipids and two unidentified lipids. DNA-DNA relatedness data indicated that strain EM106(T) represented a distinct species, separate from W. echinorum KMM 6211(T) and W. ulvae KMM 6390(T). Strain EM106(T) possessed iso-C15 : 0, iso-C15 : 1 G and iso-C16 : 0 3-OH as the major cellular fatty acids. The isolate was Gram-staining-negative, strictly aerobic, short rod-shaped and motile by gliding. The strain grew at 10-35 °C (optimum, 25 °C), pH 6.5-9.0 (optimum, 7.5), and with 0.5-5 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0.5-1 % NaCl). The overall physiological features of strain EM106(T) were very similar to those of W. echinorum KMM 6211(T) but only strain EM106(T) had nitrate reductase activity. On the basis of phenotypic and phylogenetic analyses, strain EM106(T) is proposed to represent a novel species, Winogradskyella pulchriflava. The type strain is EM106(T)( = KCTC 23858(T) = NCAIM B 02481(T)).
