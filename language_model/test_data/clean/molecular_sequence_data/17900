The effect of chronic infusion of gonadotropic hormone agonist Buserelin or antagonist CDB 2085 A for 15 weeks via alzet minipumps in adult male bonnet monkeys was studied. Infusion of Buserelin resulted in a decrease in the difference between serum testosterone values at 22.00 hours and 10.00 hours, decrease in responsiveness to injected Buserelin as judged by change in serum testosterone values from pre-injection values and decrease in sperm counts. Infusion of antagonist resulted in a decrease in the difference between serum testosterone values at 22.00 hours and 10.00 hours.
