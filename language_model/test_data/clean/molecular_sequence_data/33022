The whole DNA sequences of 2 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains isolated from the blood of a cancer patient (K279a) and the poplar Populus trichocarpa (R551-3) have been compared. The 2 chromosomes exhibit extensive synteny, but each is punctuated by about 40 genomic islands (GEIs), which vary in size from 3 to 70kb, and may encode up to about 50 proteins. A large set of smaller DNA sequences, encoding strain-specific 'solo' orfs, contributes to genetic heterogeneity in a significant manner. S. maltophilia GEIs potentially encode several proteins mediating interactions with the environment such as transmembrane proteins, haemagglutinins, components of type I and IV secretion systems, and efflux proteins having a role in metal and/or drug resistance. The presence of specific GEIs in the S. maltophilia population was monitored by PCR and slot-blot analyses. Data suggest that some islands are present at sites different from those identified in K279a and that alternative islands may be integrated at mapped sites.
