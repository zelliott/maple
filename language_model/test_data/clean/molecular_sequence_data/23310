Crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) and molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) have similar amino acid sequences and therefore comprise a peptide family referred to as the CHH family. All MIHs unexceptionally have an additional glycine residue at position 12, which is lacking in all CHHs. In order to understand the relevance of the absence of the glycine residue for hyperglycemic activity, a mutant CHH having a glycine residue insertion was prepared, and its hyperglycemic activity was assessed. This mutant CHH had the same disulfide bond arrangement as the recombinant CHH produced in Escherichia coli cells, and exhibited a similar circular dichroism spectrum to the recombinant CHH, indicating that the two CHHs possessed similar conformations. The mutant CHH showed a hyperglycemic effect weaker than the recombinant CHH by about one order of magnitude. These results suggest that the insertion of a glycine residue is one of the indices for structural and functional divergence of the CHH family peptides.
