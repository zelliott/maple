An endoglucanase encoded by a gene of Clostridium josui was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The homogeneous enzyme, with a molecular weight of 39,000, revealed maximum endoglucanase activity at pH 7.2 to 7.5 and a temperature of 65 to 70 degrees C. The enzyme was stable at a temperature lower than 45 degrees C (the growth temperature of the bacterium) in the range of pH 4.5 to 9.0. The amino acid sequence of the enzyme at the N terminus was Val-Glu-Glu-Asp-Ser-Ser-His-Leu-Ile-Thr-Asn-Gln-Ala-Lys-Lys----. The enzyme hydrolyzed cellotetraose to cellobiose and then transferred cellobiose to the residual cellotetraose. The resulting cellohexaose was cleaved to cellotriose.
