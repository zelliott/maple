Two cDNA clones for protein carboxyl methyltransferase were isolated from a rat brain cDNA library in lambda gt 11 with synthetic oligonucleotides as probes. The two clones differ in size, but the nucleotide sequence including the whole coding region of the shorter cDNA is completely identical with the corresponding sequence of the longer cDNA. The open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 227 amino acid residues, with a molecular weight of 24,626. This molecular weight is comparable to those reported for other protein carboxyl methyltransferases from several animals, which were determined by gel filtration chromatography or sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
