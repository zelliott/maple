The structural gene coding for the bifunctional aminoglycoside-modifying 6'-acetyltransferase-2''-phosphotransferase (6'AAC-2''APH) enzyme was specifically amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using template DNA of clinical isolates of enterococci (both Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium) and the single high-level gentamicin-resistant Streptococcus agalactiae strain identified thus far. The results of the present study demonstrated that the genes encoding this antibiotic resistance trait are highly homologous in these species. In dot blot hybridization assays using nonradioactively labeled oligonucleotide probes, strains with and without high-level gentamicin resistance could be discerned unequivocally. The gene segment encoding 6'-acetylating activity and the gene segment encoding 2''-phosphorylating activity were simultaneously present in all isolates exhibiting high-level gentamicin resistance.
