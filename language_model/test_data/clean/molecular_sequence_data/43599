RNA transcripts in which all guanosine residues are replaced by inosine are degraded at a highly accelerated rate when incubated in extracts from HeLa cells, sheep uterus or pig brain. We report here the partial purification and characterization of a novel ribonuclease, referred to as I-RNase, that is responsible for the degradation of inosine-containing RNA (I-RNA). I-RNase is Mg2+ dependent and specifically degrades single-stranded I-RNA. Comparison of the Km of the enzyme for I-RNA with the Ki for inhibition by normal RNA suggests a approximately 300-fold preferential binding to I-RNA, which can account for the specificity of degradation. The site of cleavage by I-RNase is non-specific; I-RNase acts as a 3'-->5' exonuclease generating 5'-NMPs as products. The presence of alternative unconventional nucleotides in RNA does not result in degradation unless inosine residues are also present. We show that I-RNase is able to degrade RNAs that previously have been modified by the RED-1 double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase (dsRAD). dsRADs destabilize dsRNA by converting adenosine to inosine, and some of these enzymes are interferon inducible. We therefore speculate that I-RNase in concert with dsRAD may form part of a novel cellular antiviral defence mechanism that acts to degrade dsRNA.
