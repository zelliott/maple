A protein named nuclear receptor binding factor-2 (NRBF-2) was identified by yeast two-hybrid screening, as an interaction partner of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha as well as several other nuclear receptors. NRBF-2 exhibited a gene activation function, when tethered to a heterologous DNA binding domain, in both mammalian cells and yeast.
