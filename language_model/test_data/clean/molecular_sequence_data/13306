We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of a 24.3 kb segment from chromosome X carried by the cosmid pEJ103. The sequence encodes five complete open reading frames (ORFs), none of which correspond to previously described genes; however, four of these ORFs display interesting similarities with sequences present in the databanks. The sequence also contains a tandem insertion of a Ty1 element. An investigation of the Ty1 polymorphism in other strains has revealed that the original insertion occurred within an ORF. Finally, the structure of the Ty1 repeat suggests a mechanism by which it may have been generated.
