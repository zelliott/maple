There remains uncertainty about the species status of Teladorsagia circumcincta, T. davtiani and T. trifurcata. In this study, the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS-2) sequences of these taxa and 2 other members within the same subfamily (Ostertagiinae) were examined. Although some sequence variation was detected between and within single worms of each taxon of Teladorsagia, no unequivocal base differences were detected among their consensus ITS-2 sequence. In comparison, there was 9% sequence difference between O. ostertagi and O. leptospicularis and 13-15% difference between the genera Teladorsagia and Ostertagia. These findings indicate that T. circumcincta, T. davtiani and T. trifurcata represent a single species, T. circumcincta.
