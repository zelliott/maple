The Schizosaccharomyces pombe cdc2-3w wee1-50 double mutant displays a temperature-sensitive lethal phenotype termed mitotic catastrophe. Six mitotic catastrophe suppressor (mcs1-6) genes were identified in a genetic screen designed to identify regulators of cdc2. Mutations in mcs1-6 suppress the cdc2-3w wee1-50 temperature-sensitive growth defect. Here, the cloning of mcs4 is described. The mcs4 gene product displays significant sequence homology to members of the two-component system response regulator protein family. Strains carrying the mcs4 and cdc25 mutations display a synthetic osmotic lethal phenotype along with an inability to grow on minimal synthetic medium. These phenotypes are suppressed by a mutation in wee1. In addition, the wis1 gene, encoding a stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, was identified as a dosage suppressor in this screen. These findings link the two-component signal transduction system to stress response and cell cycle control in S. pombe.
