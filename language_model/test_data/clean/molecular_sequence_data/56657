Previously, we described a gene, flp-1, that encodes seven FMRFamide-like peptides from two alternatively spliced transcripts in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. To determine whether all or a subset of the predicted peptides coded for by flp-1 are produced in vivo, we undertook the isolation of FMRFamide-like peptides from C. elegans. Six FLRFamide-containing peptides, all contained within the putative translation products of the flp-1 gene, were isolated from extracts of mixed stage animals. By quantitative PCR analysis of RNA from mixed stage animals, we found that the shorter transcript of flp-1 has a higher level of expression than the longer transcript.
