To study the pathogenic spectrum of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and the molecular characterizations of human enteroviruses 71 (HEV71) isolated from the clinical specimens of HFMD patients in Inner Mongolia in 2010. A total of 921 clinical specimens including stools and throat swabs were collected from HFMD patients in outpatient service in Inner Mongolia and then viral isolation was performed, the positive viral isolates were identified by using the real-time PCR method (detecting EV, HEV71 and CVA16 in a single tube), and VP4 and VP1 coding region amplification and sequencing was performed with the viral isolates that were identified as non-HEV71, non-CVA16 HEVs. A total of 153 viruses were isolated form 921 clinical specimens, the positive rate was 16.61%, of which 61 (39.87%) were HEV71, 82 (53.59%) were CVA16, 7 (6.53%) were other HEVs(6 were CVB4 and 1 was polio vaccine virus type II) and 3 (1.96%) were adenoviruses. Nine viruses were isolated from severe cases, of which 6 were HEV71 and 3 were CVA16. Thirty two HEV71 isolates were selected from the patients presenting mild symptoms and the patients presenting severe symptoms randomly, and the VP1 coding regions of represented HEV71 isolates were amplified and sequenced. Finally the phylogenetic tree was constructed among the VP1 coding regions of the different genotypes and subgenotypes of HEV71 strains. The nucleotide acid and amino acid of 32 represented HEV71 strains in Inner Mongolia were closed to HEV71 strains isolated from mainland China since 2007, especially from Beijing in 2008, and it showed that all HEV71 strains clustered within the C4a evolution branch of C4 subgenotype. There was slight difference in the nucleotide and the amino acid sequence in VP1 region among the 32 Inner Mongolia HEV71 strains, the identity were 96.4%-100% and 98.14%-100%, respectively, and there was a little difference in the nucleotide acid sequence between the HEV71 strains from Inner Mongolia in 2010 and in 2007, the identity was from 96.95% to 97.87%. Thirty two HEV71 strains were in different lineages in the phylogenetic tree, and it indicated that these strains belonged to many different viral transmission chains. HEV71 and CVA16 were the main pathogens of HFMD in Inner Mongolia in 2010 and most severe cases were caused by HEV71. All the HEV71 strains circulated in Inner Mongolia belonged to C4a evolution branch within C4 subgenotype. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2010 Inner Mongolia HEV71 strains were located in different lineages, and had more nucleotide identity with 2008 Beijing HEV71 strains than with 2007 Inner Mongolia HEV71 strains. This indicated that Inner Mongolia HEV71 strains had not evolved independently, but co-evolved with the HEV71 strains in other provinces in mainland China.
