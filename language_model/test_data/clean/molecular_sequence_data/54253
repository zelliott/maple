Low levels of carbon monoxide inhibit the N(2)-dependent growth of Rhodospirillum rubrum unless the âˆ¼100-residue CowN protein is expressed. Expression requires the CO-responsive regulator RcoM and is maximal in cells grown in the presence of CO and a poor nitrogen source, consistent with the role of CowN in N(2) fixation.
