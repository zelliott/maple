The endosymbiotic origin of chloroplasts from cyanobacteria has long been suspected and has been confirmed in recent years by many lines of evidence. Debate now is centered on whether plastids are derived from a single endosymbiotic event or from multiple events involving several photosynthetic prokaryotes and/or eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis was undertaken using the inferred amino acid sequences from the genes psbA, rbcL, rbcS, tufA and atpB and a published analysis (Douglas and Turner, 1991) of nucleotide sequences of small subunit (SSU) rRNA to examine the relationships among purple bacteria, cyanobacteria and the plastids of non-green algae (including rhodophytes, chromophytes, a cryptophyte and a glaucophyte), green algae, euglenoids and land plants. Relationships within and among groups are generally consistent among all the trees; for example, prochlorophytes cluster with cyanobacteria (and not with green plastids) in each of the trees and rhodophytes are ancestral to or the sister group of the chromophyte algae. One notable exception is that Euglenophytes are associated with the green plastid lineage in psbA, rbcL, rbcS and tufA trees and with the non-green plastid lineage in SSU rRNA trees. Analysis of psbA, tufA, atpB and SSU rRNA sequences suggests that only a single bacterial endosympbiotic event occurred leading to plastids in the various algal and plant lineages. In contrast, analysis of rbcL and rbcS sequences strongly suggests that plastids are polyphyletic in origin, with plastids being derived independently from both purple bacteria and cyanobacteria. A hypothesis consistent with these discordant trees is that a single bacterial endosymbiotic event occurred leading to all plastids, followed by the lateral transfer of the rbcLS operon from a purple bacterium to a rhodophyte.
