TSPY (testis-specific protein, Y-encoded) is a member of the greater SET/NAP family of molecules with various functions, e.g., in chromatin remodeling, regulation of gene expression, and has been implicated to play a role in the malignant development of gonadoblastoma, testicular and prostate cancer. Here we demonstrate that the C-terminus has a functional role for the nucleo-cytoplasmatic shuttling of the TSPY protein. Using various combinations of in vitro mutagenesis and enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter gene-expression experiments we were able to show that while the deletion of C-terminus leads to a decreased stability and enhanced degradation of the protein, the selective mutation of a C-terminal CK2 phosphorylation site (T300) prevents the TSPY protein from entering the nucleus. We conclude that phosphorylation of the (T300) residue is a necessary and functional prerequisite for TSPY's transport into the nucleus reminding of comparable data from a related Drosophila molecule, NAP1.
