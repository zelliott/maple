We have examined the chicken Very Low Density Apolipoprotein II (apoVLDL II) gene locus in transgenic mice. A DNA fragment composed of the transcribed region, 16 kb of 5' flanking and 400 bp of 3' flanking sequences contained all the information sufficient for estrogen-inducible, liver-specific expression of the apoVLDL II gene. The far-upstream region contains a Negative Regulating Element coinciding with a DNaseI-hypersensitive site at -11 kb. In transgenic mice, the NRE at -11 kb is used for downregulating the expression to a lower maximum level. The NRE might be used for modulating apoVLDL II gene expression, and may be involved in the rapid shut-down of the expression after hormone removal.
