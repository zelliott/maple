Bovine beta-lactoglobulin represents an interesting example of context-dependent secondary structure induction. In fact, secondary structure predictions indicated that this beta-barrel protein has a surprisingly high alpha-helical preference, which was retained for short fragments. Cooperative transitions from the native beta-sheet to alpha-helical structures were additionally induced by organic solvents, in particular trifluoroethanol. As a result of this high alpha-helical preference, it has been proposed that non-native alpha-helical intermediates could be formed in the unfolding pathway of this protein. In order to provide a better understanding of the processes that underlie conformational plasticity in this protein, CD measurements in the presence of increasing amounts of urea and in the presence of organic solvents were performed. Urea unfolding studies, performed at pH 2.1 and 37 degrees C, revealed an apparent two-state transition, and afforded no evidence of non native alpha-helical intermediates. The protein treated with up to 6M urea, refolded to the native structure, while treatment with higher molar concentration urea, lead to partial misfolding. A 29-mer peptide covering the region of strands a and b of the intact protein, characterized by the presence of 4/3 heptad repeats, was synthesized and studied by CD in the presence of different solvents. On the basis of the obtained results, a mechanism was proposed to explain the structural transition from the beta to alpha structure, provoked by organic solvents in the intact protein.
