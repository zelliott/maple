To construct the CABYR RNAi plasmid and study its relation with the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signal transduction pathway.

Human CABYR mRNA sequence was obtained from GenBank. The structure of cDNA sequence for the short hairpin RNA was BbsI + sense + loop + antisense + transcription terminator + KpnI + BamHI. A CABYR silencing plasmid was constructed and transfected into the human embryo cell line 293T. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze CABYR and NF-κB gene expression.

The CABYR and NF-κB expressions were detected in 293T cells. The oligonucleotide (5'-GCTCAGATGTTAGGTAAAG-3') efficiently silenced the expression of CABYR. The expression of NF-κB was not significantly affected by silencing CABYR (P = 0.743).

CABYR can be found in the human embryo cell line 293T. Cabyrmid 2 can efficiently silence its target, CABYR, indicating that CABYR is not related with the NF-κB signal transduction pathway.
