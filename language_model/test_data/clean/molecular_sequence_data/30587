The distribution of Phe-Leu-Arg-Phe (FLRF)-like immunoreactivity is described in the brain and in the ganglia of the ventral nerve cord of the locust Schistocerca gregaria. A single homologous pair of immunoreactive cell bodies occurs ventrally and medially in the suboesophageal ganglion. Each cell sends a process dorsally which bifurcates into anteriorly and posteriorly running neurites. The single anterior neurite passes along the circumoesophageal connectives to the brain where it ascends in a posterior running tract, giving off branches to innervate the tritocerebral neuropile and ending in an extensive network of highly varicose immunoreactive processes in the protocerebral neuropile. No processes are seen in the optic lobes or associated with the structured neuropiles of the muschroom bodies. The single posterior neurite from each cell passes into the suboesophageal-prothoracic connectives. It runs in the lateral dorsal tract of each ganglion in the ventral nerve cord as a highly varicose process and in each ganglion gives rise to an ipsilateral network of varicose processes in the dorsal and lateral neuropiles. In the seventh and terminal abdominal ganglia the innervation pattern exhibits sexual dimorphism. Vasopressin-like immunoreactivity is co-localized in the same pair of suboesophageal neurones and their processes. A similar pair of ventral median neurones stains with both antibodies in the suboesophageal ganglion of another species of locust, Locusta migratoria. Although the basic distribution pattern of immunoreactive processes is similar in both species there are also marked species differences in the pattern.
