The Campoletis sonorensis virus (CsV; Polydnaviridae) genome consists of at least 28 closed circular superhelical (SH) DNAs. In this study we used complete clones of four SH DNAs to analyze viral transcription both in the adult parasitic wasp host Campoletis sonorensis (Ichneumonidae) and in the lepidopteran host, Heliothis virescens (Noctuidae). CsV genes are expressed in parasitized H. virescens, but no viral transcripts had been characterized from C. sonorensis until this study. The clones of the SH DNAs B, H, M, and O1 were used to probe Northern blots of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from C. sonorensis reproductive tissue and from parasitized H. virescens larvae. All four SH DNAs hybridized to viral transcripts. SH-H,-M, and -O1 hybridized to messages expressed in both hosts. SH-B and -M hybridized to transcripts that were detected only in either C. sonorensis reproductive tissue or parasitized H. virescens larvae. These results suggest that some CsV genes are expressed in a host-specific manner. In a previous study we identified a family of imperfectly conserved tandemly repeated 540-bp repeat elements on SH-B,-H and -O1 (D. A. Theilmann and M. D. Summers, 1987 J. Virol. 61; 2589-2598). Hybridization of the 540-bp repeat regions to Northern blots showed that they were all homologous to viral transcripts. A cDNA clone of a mRNA that is transcribed from the 540-bp repeat region of SH-B was isolated from a lambda gt 10 library and completely sequenced. The sequence data revealed that the 540-bp repeat element was contained within the open reading frame of this gene. These results indicate that transcribed sequences homologous to the 540-bp repeat elements represent a second gene family to be identified within the CsV genome.
