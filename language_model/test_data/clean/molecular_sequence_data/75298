The structural organization of the entire rat vitamin-D-dependent calcium-binding protein (9-kDa CaBP) gene was determined by analysis of overlapping genomic clones isolated from a rat genomic library using the rat 9-kDa CaBP cDNA [Desplan C., Heidmann O., Lillie J., Auffray C. and Thomasset M. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 13502-13505]. These clones together span 30 kbp of rat genomic DNA, with the rat 9-kDa CaBP gene lying in the middle. The 9-kDa CaBP gene is 2.5 kbp long and contains three exons interrupted by two introns. The first exon contains almost the entire 5' untranslated region. The second exon codes for the calcium-binding site I, the third exon codes for site II and the 3' untranslated region. Therefore each of the calcium-binding domains is encoded by single, separate exons. The transcription initiation site was identified by S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension. A consensus sequence TATAAA is localized 31 bp upstream from the cap site and the 'CCAAT-box' lies upstream from the transcription start. Single (AC)25 and (AG)23 repeats are present in the second intron together with an Alu-like sequence. Repetitive elements are present 5 kbp upstream from the cap site and in the 3' flanking region. Comparison of the known rat CaBP sequences (9-kDa CaBP, 28-kDa CaBP, S100 protein) shows that the 9-kDa CaBP is more closely related to the S100 protein than to the 28-kDa CaBP. There is no evidence to indicate that 9-kDa CaBP has arisen from the 28-kDa CaBP.
