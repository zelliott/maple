The assembly of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) alpha/IE gene enhancer complex is determined by the interactions of the Oct-1 POU domain protein, the viral alphaTIF (alpha-trans-induction factor, VP16, ICP25, VMW65), and the C1 factor (host cell factor, HCF). A unique transcription factor, C1 consists of a family of polypeptides derived from a common precursor by site-specific proteolytic processing. To analyze the role of this factor in the determination of HSV lytic-latent infection, cDNAs and genomic DNAs encoding the mouse homologue have been isolated. This factor is nearly identical to the human protein, contains multiple consensus proteolytic processing sites, and functions efficiently in the assembly of a specific HSV enhancer complex. Interestingly, the differential expression of the C1 factors in both human and mouse tissues may be important for the determination of HSV tissue tropism in these two organisms.
