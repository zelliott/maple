We have sequenced 3,013 bp of the pig acyl coenzyme A long-chain synthetase 1 (ACSL1) gene. Sequence analysis allowed us to identify three conserved elements in the predicted amino acid sequence, two of them related to the ATP/AMP signature motif and the third involved in enzyme catalysis and fatty acid substrate specificity. In addition, we have identified five C --> T and one G --> A transition polymorphisms located in exon 16 (SNPe16), exon 17 (SNPe17) and the 3' UTR (SNPa to d), which have been genotyped in 143 pigs from the Landrace, Large White, Pi√©train, Iberian, and Duroc breeds.
