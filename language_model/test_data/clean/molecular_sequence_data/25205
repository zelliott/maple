Recombinant human cyclophilin has been co-crystallised with a number of peptides to give crystals suitable for X-ray analysis. The crystal complexes for which heavy-atom derivatives have been prepared and X-ray data collected are: cyclophilin with N-acetyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala-amidomethyl-coumarin (I) which crystallises in space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with a = 108.2, b = 123.0, c = 35.8 A, and cyclophilin with cyclosporin (II) which crystallises as tetragonal plates in space group P4(1)2(1)2 or P4(3)2(1)2 with a = b = 94.98, c = 278.55 A.
