The aim of this paper was to study if homofermentative strains (Lacobacillus plantarum) capable of malolactic fermentation in wine can degrade arginine via the ADI pathway.

Homofermentative lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from a typical red wine were investigated for their ability to produce citrulline. Citrulline was formed suggesting that the arginine metabolism takes place via the arginine deiminase (ADI) pathway and not via the arginase/urease pathway. Ammonia was also detected with Nessler's reagent, and all the strains examined were able to produce ammonia. Identification of homofermentative LAB was performed using 16S ribosomal sequence analysis. The strains were further classified as belonging to L. plantarum species. Furthermore, the genes encoding for the three pathway enzymes (ADI, ornithine transcarbamylase, carbamate kinase) were partially cloned and gene expression was performed at two different pH values (3.6 and 4.5).

The results suggest that citrulline production in wine, could be performed by homofermentative LAB.

Homofermentative malolactic bacteria (L. plantarum) may degrade arginine through the ADI pathway.
