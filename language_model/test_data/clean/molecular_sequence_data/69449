Over 5000 transgenic families of Arabidopsis thaliana produced following seed transformation with Agrobacterium tumefaciens were screened for embryonic lethals, defectives, and pattern mutants. One hundred and seventy-eight mutants with a wide range of developmental abnormalities were identified. Forty-one mutants appear from genetic studies to be tagged (36% of the 115 mutants examined in detail). Mapping with visible markers demonstrated that mutant genes were randomly distributed throughout the genome. Seven mutant families appeared to contain chromosomal translocations because the mutant genes exhibited linkage to visible markers on two different chromosomes. Chromosomal rearrangements may therefore be widespread following seed transformation. DNA gel blot hybridizations with 34 tagged mutants and three T-DNA probes revealed a wide range of insertion patterns. Models of T-DNA structure at each mutant locus were constructed to facilitate gene isolation. The value of such models was demonstrated by using plasmid rescue to clone flanking plant DNA from four tagged mutants. Further analysis of genes isolated from these insertional mutants should help to elucidate the relationship between gene function and plant embryogenesis.
