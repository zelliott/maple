From the roots of Adina rubella, four new quinovic acid glycosides, quinovic acid 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->4)-beta-D-fucopyranoside, quinovic acid 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->4)-beta-D-fucopyranosyl-(28-->1)-beta-D- glucopyranosyl ester, quinovic acid 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->4)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(28-->1) -beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester and quinovic acid 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(28-->1)- beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester, were isolated. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of hydrolytic and spectral methods.
