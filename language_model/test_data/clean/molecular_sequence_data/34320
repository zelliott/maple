Xvent homeobox genes encode transcription factors that repress organizer genes and are essential for dorsoventral specification during early embryogenesis in Xenopus. In contrast to the Xvent-2 gene subfamily, Xvent-1 subfamily members, including PV.1A, have been proposed as indirect targets of Bone Morphogenetic Protein-4 (BMP-4) signaling. Because PV.1A is a critical downstream mediator of, and tightly regulated by, BMP-4 signaling, we hypothesized that its promoter contains a direct BMP-4 response element to effect this transcriptional regulation. We demonstrate that direct regulation by BMP-4 is necessary for transcription of PV.1A: its proximal promoter contains cis-acting binding elements for Smads and Oaz crucial to induction in response to BMP-4 signaling. In addition to these direct cis-acting BMP-4 responsive elements, an indirect Xvent-2 response element and several repressive elements exist in the PV.1A promoter to regulate its transcription. In summary, PV.1A undergoes combinatorial regulation during early Xenopus development as both the direct target of BMP-4 signaling and as the direct and indirect target of positive and negative regulatory factors.
