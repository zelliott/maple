Anthranilate synthetase (EC4.1.3.27;AS) genes from wild-type Corynebacterium pekinense AS1.299 and its mutant PD-67 were cloned and sequenced. Analysis of PCR fragments revealed that three ORFs existed, which corresponded to trpL, trpE and trpG gene, respectively. Six bases changes that resulted in the changes of five amino acids were found in the trpE structural gene of C. pekinense PD-67 and a single-base change that resulted in an amino acid substitution was found in the trpG structural gene of C. pekinense PD-67.A homology comparison revealed that C. pekinense AS1.299 was closely related to Corynebacterim glutamicum ATCC 13032 and Brevibacterium lactofermentum. An internal promoter was found in the upstream of the trpL gene from C. pekinense and it functioned in E. coli, but a single-base exchange (A to G) existed in the-35 box of PD-67. The trpEG genes from the wild-type strain and its mutant were expressed both in C. pekinense AS1.299 and PD-67, and the specific enzyme activities of transformed C. pekinense were much higher than that of the parental strains. The amplification of the activity of AS yielded 22.39% increase of L-tryptophan production, but the cell growth became slower than PD-67.
