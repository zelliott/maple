Nck, an oncogenic protein composed of one SH2 and three SH3 domains, is a common target for various cell surface receptors. Nck is thought to function as an adaptor protein to couple cell surface receptors to downstream effector molecules that regulate cellular responses induced by receptor activation. In this report, we show that Nck forms a stable complex in vivo with IRS-1 in insulin-stimulated cells. The interaction between IRS-1 and Nck is mediated by the binding of the SH2 domain of Nck to tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1. Although Nck associates with IRS-1, Nck phosphorylation is not affected by insulin stimulation. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies show that the SH2 domains of Nck, GRB2, and p85 bind distinct phosphotyrosine residues in IRS-1. After insulin stimulation all three signaling molecules can be found complexed to a single IRS-1 molecule. These findings provide further evidence that, in response to insulin stimulation, IRS-1 acts as an SH2 docking protein that coordinates the regulation of various different signaling pathways activated by the insulin receptor.
