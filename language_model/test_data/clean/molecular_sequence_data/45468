This article summarizes structural and functional properties of pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI), which has been identified in many species. Its prominent role is to protect the pancreas from prematurely activated trypsinogen before entry into the duodenum. In the rat there are two isoforms, one of which is PSTI-I, a 61-amino acid peptide involved in the feedback regulation of pancreatic enzymes. Independent investigations in neoplastic diseases led to the discovery of tumor-associated trypsin inhibitor,which is identical to PSTI.
