Phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on two strains of a hitherto undescribed Aerococcus-like organism isolated from the human vagina. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies demonstrated that the unknown strains constitute a new subline within the genus Aerococcus. The unknown bacterium was readily distinguished from the two currently recognized Aerococcus species, Aerococcus viridans and Aerococcus urinae, by biochemical tests and electrophoretic analysis of whole-cell proteins. On the basis of phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium be classified as Aerococcus christensenii sp. nov. The type strain of A. christensenii is CCUG 28831T.
