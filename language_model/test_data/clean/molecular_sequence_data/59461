Endothelin receptors bind peptides of the endothelin family, the most potent vasoconstrictors known, and have been implicated in hypertension. To begin to define DNA sequences necessary for the transcriptional regulation of the rat endothelin type A receptor (ETA), we have sequenced the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and part of the 5'-flanking region, a total of 1153 nucleotides. Comparison of the rat and human sequences revealed a 57% similarity in the 5'-flanking sequences, and a 63% similarity in the 5'-UTRs. Several conserved sequences were identified, including GATA and E-boxes, which may be important for the regulation of ETA gene expression. Primer extension analysis identified two transcription initiation sites within the rat gene.
