Serological and virological studies were carried out of a mumps outbreak which occurred in one region, Yoeju County, Southeast of Seoul in Korea from September to December, 1999. Sera from 736 children at 8-13 years of age of patients with mumps and healthy children were tested for mumps-specific antibodies by enzyme immunoassay. The overall IgM positive rate was 7.6% (56/736), compared with 69.8% (514/736) for IgG. Of the 49 children with both IgG and IgM, 32 were also confirmed by both clinical and serological diagnosis. IgM antibodies were detected even in the samples collected up to 3 months after the onset of symptoms. Although 436 children had been vaccinated before the outbreak, 27 (6.2%) were found to be IgM positive, particularly 6 (4.4%) of 136 were positive serologically despite a second-dose vaccinees. Sequence analysis of the small hydrophobic (SH) gene of 4 mumps viruses isolated from 42 saliva specimens revealed that these were related to the genotype H, but distinguishable from European strains. This is the first study on the outbreak due to mumps virus genotype H and provides information to assess the understanding of recent outbreaks of mumps in Korea.
