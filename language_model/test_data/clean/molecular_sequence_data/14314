A novel triazophos-degrading Bacillus sp., TAP-1, was isolated from sewage sludge in a wastewater treating system of organophosphorus pesticide produced by Funong Group Co. in Jianou, Fujian, southeastern China. The isolate is a gram-positive and rod-shaped bacterium capable of hydrolyzing insecticide triazophos and was identified as a strain of Bacillus using polyphasic taxonomy combined with analysis of the morphological and physio-biochemical properties. TAP-1 could degrade triazophos through co-metabolism. When fed with nutrients such as yeast extract, peptone and glucose, TAP-1 could degrade 98.5% of TAP in the medium (100 mg/l) within 5 days. The optimal pH and temperature for the degradation were 6.5-8 and 32Â°C, respectively. An enzyme distribution experiment showed that the enzyme responsible for TAP degradation appeared to be intracellular.
