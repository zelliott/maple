The effects of low concentrations of extracellular ATP on cytosolic Ca(2+), membrane potential, and transcription of IL-6 were studied in monocyte-derived human macrophages. During inflammation or infection many cells secrete ATP. We show here that application of 10 microM ATP or 10 microM UTP induces oscillations in cytosolic Ca(2+) with a frequency of approximately 12 min(-1) and oscillations in membrane potential. RT-PCR analysis showed expression of P2Y(1), P2Y(2), P2Y(11), P2X(1), P2X(4), and P2X(7) receptors, large-conductance (KCNMA1 and KCNMB1-4), and intermediate-conductance (KCNN4) Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels. The Ca(2+)oscillations were unchanged after removal of extracellular Ca(2+), indicating that they were mainly due to movements of Ca(2+) between intracellular compartments. Comparison of the effects of different nucleotides suggests that the Ca(2+) oscillations were elicited by activation of P2Y(2) receptors coupled to phospholipase C. Patch-clamp experiments showed that ATP induced a transient depolarization, probably mediated by activation of P2X(4) receptors, followed by membrane potential oscillations due to opening of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels. We also found that 10 microM ATP gamma S increased transcription of IL-6 approximately 40-fold within 2 h. This effect was abolished by blockade of P2Y receptors with 100 microM suramin. Our results suggest that ATP released from inflamed, damaged, or metabolically impaired cells represents a "danger signal" that plays a major role in activating the innate immune system.
