Aspergillus nidulans is an excellent experimental organism for the study of gene regulation. Genetic and molecular analyses of trans-acting and cis-acting mutations have revealed a complex pattern of regulation involving multiple independent controls. Expression of the amdS gene is regulated by the facB and amdA genes which encode positively acting regulatory proteins mediating a major and a minor form of acetate induction respectively. The product of the amdR gene mediates omega amino acid induction of amdS. The binding sites for each of these proteins have been localised through amdS cis-acting mutations which specifically affect the interaction with the regulatory protein. The global controls of nitrogen metabolite repression and carbon catabolite repression regulate the expression of many catabolic genes, including amdS. Nitrogen control is exerted through the positively acting areA gene product and carbon control is dependent on the creA gene product. Each of the characterized regulatory genes encodes a DNA-binding protein which recognises particular sequences in the amdS promoter to activate or repress gene expression. In addition, there is evidence for other genetically uncharacterized proteins, including a CCAAT-binding complex, which interact with the 5' region of the amdS gene.
