Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) are found in many marine fish and have been classified into five biochemical classes: AFP types I-IV and the antifreeze glycoproteins. Type I AFPs are alpha-helical, partially amphipathic, Ala-rich polypeptides. The winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus) produces two type I AFP subclasses, the liver-type AFPs (wflAFPs) and the skin-type AFPs (wfsAFPs), that are encoded by distinct gene families with different tissue-specific expression. wfsAFPs and wflAFPs share a high level of identity even though the wfsAFPs have approximately half the activity of the wflAFPs. Synthetic polypeptides based on two representative wflAFPs and wfsAFPs were generated to examine the role of the termini in antifreeze activity. Through systematic exchange of N and C termini between wflAFP-6 and wfsAFP-2, the termini were determined to be the major causative agents for the variation in activity levels between the two AFPs. Furthermore, the termini of wflAFP-6 possessed greater helix-stabilizing ability compared with their wfsAFP-2 counterparts. The observed 50% difference in activity between wflAFP-6 and wfsAFP-2 can be divided into approximately 20% for differences at each termini and approximately 10% for differences in the core. Furthermore, the N terminus was determined to be the most critical component for antifreeze activity.
