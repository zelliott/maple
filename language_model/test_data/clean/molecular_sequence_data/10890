An invariant chain peptide (murine Ii76-92; Ii-Key) is known to produce a 10 to 50 times baseline enhancement of the presentation of specific antigenic peptides to murine T cell hybridomas by cell surface MHC class II molecules. In order to define structure-activity relationships in Ii-key, homologs were synthesized with the following systematic variations: 1) N- and C-terminal truncations, 2) N-terminal acetylation and C-terminal amidation, 3) substitutions with 13 natural amino acids in each position of the shortest, fully active peptide, and then with an additional 12 nonnatural amino acids at certain 'pharmacophore' positions, 4) substitutions with D-amino acids and N-methyl-leucine, and 5) cyclical forms. More than 160 homologs were tested for effects on antigen presentation by the murine MHC class II alleles: A(d), Ak, E(d), or Ek. For some compounds, allele specificity between E(d) and Ek exceeded 1:20. D-Amino acid and/or N-methyl-leucine substitutions were accepted at some residue positions, leading to peptides with relatively long half-lives in mouse serum and low toxicities in mice. An Ii-Key homolog inhibited in vitro presentation of an internally processed hen egg lysozyme determinant to a specific T hybridoma. The best compounds can be tested in vivo for therapeutic applications: 1) immunosuppression upon release of antigenic peptide, and 2) vaccination or immunomodulation upon co-administration of a second antigenic peptide.
