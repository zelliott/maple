Although beta actin mRNA is down-regulated during myogenesis, the beta actin promoter confers constitutive expression when joined to heterologous genes transfected into a variety of different cell backgrounds, including differentiated muscle. Normal promoter activity is dependent upon the binding of a ubiquitous factor to the CCAAT-box element. Loss or reduction in factor binding correlates with a major reduction in promoter activity both in vivo and in vitro. The binding domain covers approximately 23 base pairs as determined by DNase footprinting. Methylation of A and G residues in and adjacent to the CCAAT box results in the loss of factor binding. Mutations across the binding domain indicate that the sequence GCCAATCAG within the domain is sufficient as a recognition sequence for factor binding. This binding is not competed by the alpha cardiac actin CCAAT sequence. Bandshift experiments demonstrate a predominant single band of similar mobility in nuclear extracts from various cells and tissues, with the exception of HeLa cells. The prevalence of the factor and its recognition sequence in a variety of promoters suggests that this factor has a common role in the transcriptional activation of several eukaryotic promoters.
