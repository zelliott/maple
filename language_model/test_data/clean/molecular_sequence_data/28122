A rabbit antiserum was raised against envelope material from purified human cytomegalovirus strain AD169. The serum recognized polypeptides 200, 170, 160, 75, 58, and 45 kilodaltons in size. It was used to screen a cDNA library constructed from poly(A)+ RNA from human cytomegalovirus-infected cells in the expression vector lambda gt11. A recombinant bacteriophage expressing cytomegalovirus-specific sequences was identified, and the corresponding gene was mapped to the HindIII R fragment. The gene is transcribed into a late 1.5-kilobase RNA. The nucleotide sequence of the coding region was determined. Computer analysis of the gene product revealed a polypeptide containing multiple potential membrane-spanning domains, representing a type of protein not identified in the envelope of herpesviruses before. The protein shows homology on the amino acid level to hypothetical proteins from reading frames BBRF3 of Epstein-Barr virus, UL10 of herpes simplex virus type 1, and ORF50 of varicella-zoster virus. By using an antiserum raised against procaryote-expressed parts of the cytomegalovirus membrane protein, a 45-kilodalton structural component of the virus was identified as the gene product.
