A rabbit antiserum (anti-EP), induced against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 68 to 86 of guinea pig myelin basic protein, powerfully immunostained abnormal-appearing oligodendrocytic processes and cell bodies in demyelinating areas associated with multiple sclerosis plaques. However, it failed to recognize any structures in normal human, rat, or guinea pig brain. The antiserum recognized the synthetic peptide QDENPVV, which corresponds to human myelin basic protein residues 82 to 88. Immunoabsorption with this peptide eliminated immunohistochemical staining. By contrast, several commercial antibodies recognizing nearby sequences of human myelin basic protein intensely stained all myelinated structures in both normal and multiple sclerosis tissue. The unusual epitope recognized by anti-EP appears to be accessible only in areas of myelin degeneration. If insults occur that repeatedly expose a region of MBP normally sheltered from immunosurveillance, a self-sustaining immune reaction might result.
