These studies were undertaken to investigate the therapeutic mechanism of saturated solutions of KI, used to treat infectious and inflammatory diseases. The addition of 12-50 mM KI to cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells resulted in 319-395 mosM final solute concentration and induced interleukin (IL)-8 synthesis. Maximal IL-8 production was seen when 40 mM salt was added (375 mosM) and was equal to IL-8 induced by endotoxin or IL-1 alpha. However, there was no induction of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, or tumor necrosis factor to account for the synthesis of IL-8; the effect of KI was not due to contaminating endotoxins. Hyperosmolar NaCl also induced IL-8 and increased steady-state levels of IL-8 mRNA similar to those induced by IL-1 alpha. IL-8 gene expression was elevated for 96 hr in peripheral blood mononuclear cells incubated with hyperosmolar NaCl. In human THP-1 macrophagic cells, osmotic stimulation with KI, NaI, or NaCl also induced IL-8 production. IL-1 signal transduction includes the phosphorylation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase that is observed following osmotic stress. Using specific blockade of this kinase, a dose-response inhibition of hyperosmolar NaCl-induced IL-8 synthesis was observed, similar to that in cells stimulated with IL-1. Thus, these studies suggest that IL-1 and osmotic shock utilize the same mitogen-activated protein kinase for signal transduction and IL-8 synthesis.
