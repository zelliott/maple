Genetic architecture of coronary artery disease (CAD) is still to be defined. Since low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) gene play critical roles in Wnt signal transduction which are important for vascular development and endodermis specification, we therefore resequenced it to search for mutations in CAD patients.

We systemically sequenced all the exons and promoter region of LRP6 gene in a sample of 380 early onset CAD patients and 380 control subjects in Chinese.

In total, we identified 5 patient-specific mutations including K82N (two patients), S488Y (one patient), P1066T (two patients), P1206H (two patients) and I1264V (one patient) All these mutations located at the extracellular domain of LRP6 gene. In vitro functional analysis of patient-specific mutations demonstrated that these mutations resulted in a significant reduction in both protein level transporting to cell membrane and downstream Wnt signal activity. Furthermore, we found that LRP6 novel mutations attenuated proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) when compared with wild type (WT) LRP6.

Our results demonstrated that these loss-of-function variants might contribute to disease liability in a subset of CAD and defects in Wnt signal activation might be important contributing factors for the onset of CAD.
