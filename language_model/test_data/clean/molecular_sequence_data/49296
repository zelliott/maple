The nucleotide sequence of cDNA that encodes hamster d-amino-acid oxidase (DAO) was determined. The cDNA consisted of 1,590 nucleotides and a poly(A) tail. It had an open reading frame for a protein consisting of 346 amino acid residues. The number of the amino acid residues is the same as that of the rat DAO. However, the hamster DAO has one residue more than mouse DAO and one residue less than human, pig, rabbit, and guinea pig DAOs. Amino acid sequence of the hamster DAO was highly similar to those of mouse and rat DAOs: 89% and 88% of the amino acid residues were identical between the hamster and mouse DAOs and between the hamster and rat DAOs, respectively. The homology was slightly less between the hamster DAO and the human (81%), pig (78%), rabbit (78%), or guinea pig DAO (82%). It has been proposed that the mouse and rat DAOs lack an amino acid residue corresponding to the 25th residue of the DAOs of other mammals. However, a detailed comparison of the amino acid sequences as well as the underlying nucleotide sequences by inclusion of the hamster ones revealed that the rodent DAOs does not lack the 25th, but the 27th residue.
