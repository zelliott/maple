Amino-terminal amino acid sequencing was carried out on proteins purified from herpes simplex virus type 1 capsids. The sequences of two capsid proteins (VP19C and VP23) showed them to be encoded by genes UL38 and UL18, respectively. The product of UL38 has been shown to be essential for capsid assembly, but no role has previously been assigned to the product of UL18.
