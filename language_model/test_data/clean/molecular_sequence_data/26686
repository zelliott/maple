There is growing evidence that ouabain, a cardiotonic steroid may promote growth of cardiac and vascular myocytes, indicating its novel role in cell growth and proliferation, without appreciable inhibition of the sodium pump. The mechanism(s) by which low dose of ouabain produces pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation, a prerequisite for right ventricular hypertrophy, is currently unknown. Here, we analyzed the effects of low dose of ouabain (10 nM) on increase in [Ca2+]i, m-calpain and protein kinase C (PKC) activities on pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation and determined their sequential involvement in this scenario. We treated bovine pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells with a low dose of ouabain (10 nM) and determined [Ca2+]i in the cells by fluorometric assay using fura2-AM, m-calpain activity by fluorometric assay using SLLVY-AMC as the substrate. PKC activity using an assay kit and assay of Na+/K+ ATPase activity spectrophotometrically. We purified m-calpain and PKCalpha by standard chromatographic procedure by HPLC and then studied cleavage of the purified PKCalpha by m-calpain using Western immunoblot method. Subsequently, we performed cell proliferation assay utilizing the redox dye resazunin. We used selective inhibitors of [Ca2+]i (BAPTA-AM), m-calpain (MDL28170), PKCalpha (Go6976) and determined their involvement in ouabain (10 nM)-mediated smooth muscle cell proliferation. Our results suggested that treatment of bovine pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells with a low dose of ouabain (10 nM) increased [Ca2+]i and subsequently stimulated m-calpain activity and proteolytically activated PKCalpha in caveolae (signaling microdomain also known as signalosomes) of the cells. Upon activation, PKCalpha increased the smooth muscle cell proliferation via Go/G1 to S/G2-M phase transition. Thus, [Ca2]i-mCalpain-PKCalpha signaling axis plays a crucial role during low dose of ouabain-mediated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation.
