We have identified the fifth member of the mammalian X,K-ATPase beta-subunit gene family. The human and rat genes are largely expressed in skeletal muscle and at a lower level in heart. The deduced human and rat proteins designated as beta(muscle) (beta(m)) consist of 357 and 356 amino acid residues, respectively, and exhibit 89% identity. The sequence homology of beta(m) proteins with known Na,K- and H,K-ATPase beta-subunits are 30.5-39.4%. Unlike other beta-subunits, putative beta(m) proteins have large N-terminal cytoplasmic domains containing long Glu-rich sequences. The data obtained indicate the existence of hitherto unknown X,K-ATPase (most probably Na,K-ATPase) isozymes in muscle cells.
