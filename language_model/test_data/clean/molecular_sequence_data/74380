Southern hybridisation of genomic DNA extracted from a human primary colorectal carcinoma revealed amplification of a fragment containing the wild-type c-myc locus. Two additional rearranged DNA fragments, lying upstream of c-myc, fused to distant non-contiguous sequences from the same chromosome, with an opposite configuration (head to head vs. head to tail), were also found to be amplified. Sequences analysis suggested that these rearrangements resulted from illegitimate recombination at two distinct points within the DNA sequence just upstream of the c-myc ORF and further that these events triggered two different amplification mechanisms, only one of which, involving a strand invasion event following DNA double strand breaks, increased the copy number of the c-myc ORF.
