The genes directing the expression of group II capsules in Escherichia coli are organized into three regions. The central region 2 is type specific and thought to determine the synthesis of the respective polysaccharide, whilst the flanking regions 1 and 3 are common to all group II gene clusters and direct the surface expression of the capsular polysaccharide. In this communication we analyze the involvement of region 1 and 3 genes in the synthesis of the capsular KS polysaccharide. Recombinant E. coli strains harboring all KS specific region 2 genes and having various combinations of region 1 and 3 genes were studied using immunoelectron microscopy. Membranes from these bacteria were incubated with UDP[14C]GlcA and UDPGlcNAc in the absence or presence of KS polysaccharide as an exogenous acceptor. It was found that recombinant strains with only gene region 2 did not produce the K5 polysaccharide. Membranes of such strains did not synthesize the polymer and did not elongate K5 polysaccharide added as an exogenous acceptor. An involvement of genes from region 1 (notably kpsC and kpsS) and from region 3 (notably kpsT) in the K5 polysaccharide synthesis was apparent and is discussed.
