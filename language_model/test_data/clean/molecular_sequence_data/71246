The major E/S protein of Trichuris trichiura, the human whipworm, is a highly immunogenic 47-kDa protein that has a pore forming activity that is thought to be essential for the attachment of the worm to host mucosal epithelium. By gene analysis, we have demonstrated that this protein belongs to a multigene family, and we have obtained genomic and cDNA information for two of these genes. The encoded proteins are composed of tandem arrays of alternating 50- and 51-amino-acid domains within which the positioning of the cysteine residues is highly conserved. This structure resembles that of four disulphide core domain proteins, such as secretory leucocyte proteinase-1 (SLP-1), but the Trichuris protein family differs in being composed of multiple domains of this type (nine in TT50, 17 in TT95). An analysis of the relationship between the domains, and a comparison of the fine arrangement of the genes, suggests that TT95 has arisen relatively recently following duplication of the TT50 gene, which itself arose by duplication of a SLP-1-like ancestor.
