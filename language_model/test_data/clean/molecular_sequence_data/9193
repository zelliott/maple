Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1B1 and CYP2J have been studied in various mammals, but not in pig. The sequences encoding pig CYP1B1 and CYP2J34 were isolated from liver cDNA by RACE and sequenced. The open reading frames of pig CYP1B1 showed a higher sequence homology to bovine 1B1 (89%) than to dog 1B1 (88%) or to human 1B1 (85%). On the other hand, the coding sequence of pig CYP2J34 showed a similar homology (83-85%) to CYP2J of these species. From the substrate recognition sites (SRS 1-6) analysis of the deduced proteins, it was found that the porcine CYP1B1, unlike CYP2J34, completely shared the six SRS with the bovine counterpart. RT-PCR analysis of CYP1B1 and CYP2J34 expression in ten porcine tissues revealed that CYP1B1 was principally expressed in adrenal gland, whereas CYP2J34 was predominantly expressed in small intestine. These results further support the pig as an useful model for human.
