Chromo-helicase-DNA binding 1 (CHD1) is a conserved protein with a putative role in chromatin architecture. Single homologues have been found in mouse, Drosophila and yeast. In birds the situation is different as they possess two homologues. One is known to be W-linked, we show the second, closely related gene is linked to the Z sex chromosome. The basic structure of the Z-linked gene is similar to the homologous genes, however, it does possess an additional, internal 88 amino acid hydrophilic domain, rich in glutamic acid and lysine. Studies on pairs of genes sex-linked in mammals suggests rapid divergence of DNA sequence and function. We suggest the DNA sequences of CHD-W and CHD-Z do not follow this pattern.
