Metallothionein levels were determined in the eggs of two sea urchin species, the Mediterranean Sphaerechinus granularis and the Antarctic Sterechinus neumayeri. While appreciable levels of metallothionein were found in S. granularis eggs, a negligible amount was detected in S. neumayeri. Two metallothionein isoforms were purified from S. granularis, and metallothionein cDNAs were obtained by means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Two distinct cDNA species were cloned and sequenced. The translated amino acid sequences of these two forms consisted of 67 residues and differed in two amino acid substitutions. Despite the lack of metallothionein in S. neumayeri eggs, a metallothionein cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR amplification and a single amino acid sequence coding for a 63 residues MT was deduced. A comparative analysis of the primary structure of S. granularis and S. neumayeri metallothioneins with those of the other sea urchin metallothioneins has been performed. Sea urchin metallothioneins appear to be less similar to each other than metallothioneins of closely related vertebrates.
