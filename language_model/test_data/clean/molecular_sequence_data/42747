Prox 1, a likely mouse homologue of the Drosophila homeobox gene prospero has been cloned and its expression pattern analyzed during development. In Drosophila, prospero is expressed in the developing CNS, lens-secreting cone cells of the eye, and midgut. In the mouse, Prox 1 is expressed in many of the same tissues: young neurons of the subventricular region of the CNS, developing eye lens and pancreas. Expression is also detected in the developing liver and heart, as well as transiently in the skeletal muscles. The similarities in protein sequence and expression patterns between the mouse and fly cognate genes suggest that Prox 1 may play, among others, a fundamental role in early development of the murine CNS.
