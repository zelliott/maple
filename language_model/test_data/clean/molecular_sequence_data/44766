Two new olean-12-ene-type triterpene oligoglycosides, named sandosaponins A and B, were isolated from kidney bean, the seed of Phaseolus vulgaris L., together with three known saponins, soyasaponins I and V and dehydrosoyasaponin 1. The structures of sandosaponins A and B were determined on the basis of chemical and physicochemical evidence, which included the chemical derivation of sandosapogenol from a known sapogenol, soyasapogenol B. Five saponins obtained from kidney bean were found to inhibit histamine release from rat exudate cells induced by an antigen-antibody reaction and, among them, sandosaponins A and B showed the most potent inhibitory activity.
