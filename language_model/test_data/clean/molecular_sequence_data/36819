The catalytic domain in the minus strand of the satellite RNA of tobacco ringspot virus (sTobRV(-)) assumes a hairpin-like secondary structure. This ribozyme catalyzes a cross-ligation reaction between substrate RNAs of different lengths. We constructed ribozymes to probe the activities of ligation and RNA fragment exchange.
