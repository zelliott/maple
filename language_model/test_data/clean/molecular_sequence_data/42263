Interactions between cells from human giant cell tumors of bone and the extracellular matrix protein laminin were studied. Cells were capable of recognizing this substratum via a RGD-independent mechanism. Recognition induces adhesion and spreading onto laminin. This protein triggered the release of cellular FN which in turn enhanced recruitment of the beta 1 chain-containing integrin receptor.
