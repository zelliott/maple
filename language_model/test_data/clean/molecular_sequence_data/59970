G10BP, a serum-inducible factor, represses the transcription of the fibronectin gene through binding to the G-rich sequences in the promoter excluding Sp1 from binding to these sequences.

The 5' flanking sequence of the G10BP-1 gene was isolated by polymerase chain reaction of the adaptor-ligated genomic DNA library using the adaptor primer and the G10BP-1 cDNA primer. The elements required for activation of the G10BP-1 promoter following serum stimulation were analysed by transfection of quiescent rat 3Y1 cells with G10BP-1 promoter-luciferase cDNA constructs containing 5' sequential deletions or base substitutions. The results showed that the promoter was activated by Myc and Jun through the E box and AP1 sites. The formation of DNA-protein complexes with 32P-labelled oligonucleotides containing the E box or AP1 site with cell extracts prepared during G1 progression was correlated with the promoter activation and greatly reduced by immunodepletion of Myc or c-Jun from the extracts.

These results indicate that the G10BP-1 gene is a target of Myc and Jun/Fos and that these factors repress the fibronectin gene expression through induction of G10BP-1 during G1-to-S phase progression.
