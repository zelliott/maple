As part of biochemical and structural studies of the primosome of a gram positive bacterial species, we describe the cloning of the Bacillus stearothermophilus replicative helicase, DnaB. The protein is 45% and 82% identical to the Escherichia coli and B. subtilis replicative helicases, respectively. Recombinant DnaB was purified and shown to be an active helicase.
