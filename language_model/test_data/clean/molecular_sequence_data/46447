The glycine riboswitch has a tandem dual aptamer configuration, where each aptamer is a separate ligand-binding domain, but the aptamers function together to bind glycine cooperatively. We sought to understand the molecular basis of glycine riboswitch cooperativity by comparing sites of tertiary contacts in a series of cooperative and noncooperative glycine riboswitch mutants using hydroxyl radical footprinting, in-line probing, and native gel-shift studies. The results illustrate the importance of a direct or indirect interaction between the P3b hairpin of aptamer 2 and the P1 helix of aptamer 1 in cooperative glycine binding. Furthermore, our data support a model in which glycine binding is sequential; where the binding of glycine to the second aptamer allows tertiary interactions to be made that facilitate binding of a second glycine molecule to the first aptamer. These results provide insight into cooperative ligand binding in RNA macromolecules.
