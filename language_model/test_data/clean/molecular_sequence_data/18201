Previously, a ferredoxin-type iron-sulfur protein, frx B protein, was identified in a high-salt extract of the purified thylakoid membrane of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a unicellular green alga. Polyclonal antibody was raised against a synthetic pentadecameric peptide with an amino acid sequence corresponding to the highly conserved region of the putative frx B proteins of 3 land plants. In this report, protein(s) reacting strongly and specifically with this antibody was detected in the equivalent high-salt extract prepared from purified chloroplast of spinach and tobacco. One strong reaction polypeptide band from tobacco chloroplast was purified from SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to endoproteinase lys C digestion. The resulting polypeptides were separated by reversed-phase chromatography. N-terminal sequencing of 3 purified polypeptides revealed that the protein is encoded by the 'frxB gene' identified from DNA sequence analysis.
