A family with X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta (XAI) is described in which the disease is associated with a nonsense mutation in exon 5 of the amelogenin gene. This mutation involves a single base deletion (CCCC-->CCC) in the exon in an affected male, his sister and his mother. The effect of this deletion is to alter the reading frame and to introduce an inappropriate TGA stop codon (an opal mutation) into the exonic sequence of the amelogenin gene immediately 3' of the mutation. The clinical features in the examined members of this family indicate that, in some individuals, the most noticeable defect is of enamel hypoplasia. In others, the hypoplastic changes are subtle and might have been overlooked on cursory examination; the most noticeable change is of enamel colour, indicating a degree of hypomineralisation. We propose that the amelogenin gene is implicated in both the formation of enamel of normal thickness and in the normal mineralisation process.
