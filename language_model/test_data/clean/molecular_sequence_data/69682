We are using the diptericin gene as a model system to study the control of expression of the genes encoding antibacterial peptides during the Drosophila immune reaction. In order to investigate the putative regulatory regions in the diptericin promoter, we performed DNaseI footprinting experiments combined with gel-shift assays in two inducible systems: the larval fat body and a tumorous Drosophila blood cell line. Our results confirm the importance of kappa B-like elements previously described in the immune response of insects and reveal for the first time the involvement of other regions containing sequences homologous to mammalian acute-phase response elements.
