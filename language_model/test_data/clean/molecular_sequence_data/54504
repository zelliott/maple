A combined loop-mediated isothermal amplification lateral flow dipstick (LAMP-LFD) format was evaluated in the detection of human infective trypanosome DNA from clinical samples. The LAMP-LFD showed analytical sensitivity equivalent to 0.01 tryps/mL, levels that were identical to using gel electrophoresis and SYBR Green I dye. The LAMP-LFD showed superior specificity to SYBR Green I when supernatant prepared from boiled human biological samples was used as template. These results indicate that the use of nonspecific DNA intercalators may produce false positives when partially processed templates are used. The LAMP-LFD format presented here is simple, rapid, and has future potential use in diagnosis of sleeping sickness.
