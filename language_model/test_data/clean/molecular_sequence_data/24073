The aim of this study was to establish a porcine physical map along the chromosome SSC7q by construction of BAC contigs between microsatellites Sw1409 and S0102. The SLA class II contig, located on SSC7q, was lengthened. Four major BAC contigs and 10 short contigs span a region equivalent to 800 cR measured by IMpRH7000 mapping. The BAC contigs were initiated by PCR screening with primers derived from human orthologous segments, extended by chromosome walking, and controlled and oriented by RH mapping with the two available panels, IMpRH7000Rad and IMNpRH12000Rad. The location of 43 genes was revealed by sequenced segments, either from BAC ends or PCR products from BAC clones. The 220 BAC end sequences (BES) were also used to analyze the different marks of evolution. Comparative mapping analysis between pigs and humans demonstrated that the gene organization on HSA6p21 and on SSC7p11 and q11-q14 segments was conserved during evolution, with the exception of long fragments of HSA6p12 which shuffled and spliced the SLA extended class II region. Additional punctual variations (unique gene insertion/deletion) were observed, even within conserved segments, revealing the evolutionary complexity of this region. In addition, 18 new polymorphic microsatellites have been selected in order to cover the entire SSC7p11-q14 region.
