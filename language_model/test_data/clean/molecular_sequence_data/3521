MiniANP is a synthetic pentadecapeptide analogue of atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP). We have used the proline-scanning mutagenesis and the analogue peptides with shorter backbones to characterize the turn-like conformation at residue 6-9 and an extended structure of Gly5-Gly6 as the receptor-bound structure of miniANP. A docking study of miniANP at the binding site of the type A natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR-A) supported the deduced conformation in the receptor-bound structure.
