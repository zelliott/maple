Analysis of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) genome sequences has revealed multiple genotypes with different geographical distributions and associated disease patterns. To date, replication-competent cDNA clones of HDV genotypes I, II, and III have been reported. HDV genotypes I, II, and IIb have been found in Taiwan. Although full-length sequences of genotype IIb have been published, its replication competence in cultured cells has yet to be reported. In order to examine this, we obtained a full-length cDNA clone, Taiwan-IIb-1, from a Taiwanese HDV genotype IIb isolate. Comparison of the complete nucleic acid sequence of Taiwan-IIb-1 with previously published genotype IIb isolates indicated that Taiwan-IIb-1 shares 98% identity with another Taiwanese isolate and 92% identity with a Japanese isolate. Transfection of Taiwan-IIb-1 into COS7 cells resulted in accumulation of the HDV genome and appearance of delta antigens, showing that cloned HDV genotype IIb can replicate in cultured cells.
