The cell attachment activity of vitronectin has been ascribed to an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence near the amino terminus. To verify the importance of the RGD sequence for cell binding, we created RAD and RGE vitronectin mutants and also deleted either the somatomedin B (delta S-rVN) or heparin (delta H-rVN) binding domains. These mutants were expressed as fusion proteins, purified using Ni+2 affinity chromatography, and assayed for cell attachment. EAhy.926 cells bound equally well to wild-type, delta S-rVN, and to delta H-rVN, but binding to RAD-rVN and RGE-rVN was inhibited by more than 90%. We therefore conclude that the RGD sequence of vitronectin is the most important cell recognition site and that neither the somatomedin B nor heparin domains contribute significantly to the cell adhesive activity of vitronectin.
