We report the nucleotide sequence of the chloroplast psbA gene encoding the 32 kilodalton protein of photosystem II from Chlamydomonas moewusii. Like its land plant homologues, this green algal protein consists of 353 amino acids. The C. moewusii psbA gene is composed of three exons containing 252, 11 and 90 codons and of two group I introns containing 2363 and 1807 nucleotides. Each of the introns features an internal open reading frame (ORF) that potentially encodes a basic protein of more than 300 residues. The primary sequences of the putative intron-encoded proteins are unrelated and none of them shares conserved elements with any of the proteins predicted from the group I intron sequences published so far. The first C. moewusii intron is inserted at the same position as the fourth intron of the psbA gene from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; the second intron lies at a novel site downstream of this position. On the basis of their RNA secondary structures, the C. moewusii introns 1 and 2 can be assigned to subgroups IA and IB, respectively. However, intron 1 is not typical of subgroup IA introns, its most unusual feature being the location of the ORF in the "loop L5" region. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an ORF is located in this region of the group I intron structure.
