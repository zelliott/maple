5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSP synthase, EC 2.5.1.19) is the sixth enzyme in the shikimate pathway which is essential for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids and many secondary metabolites. The enzyme is widely involved in glyphosate tolerant transgenic plants because it is the primary target of the nonselective herbicide glyphosate. In this study, the Dunaliella salina EPSP synthase gene was cloned by RT-PCR approach. It contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 514 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 54.6 KDa. The derived amino acid sequence showed high homology with other EPSP synthases. The Dunaliella salina EPSP synthase gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and the recombinant EPSP synthase were identified by functional complementation assay.
