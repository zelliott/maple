The antioxidant and antimutagenic activities of the novel carboxyethyl derivatives of chitosan with three different degrees of substitution have been assayed in vitro in the unicellular flagellate Euglena gracilis subjected to the action of genotoxic agents acridine orange and ofloxacin. It has been demonstrated that chitosan derivatives exhibit concentration-dependent protective antigenotoxic activity against both mutagens. It is suggested that different mechanisms may be involved in its protective action--antioxidant activity in case of ofloxacin-induced DNA damage, as well as possible interaction with the cell membrane that prevents acridine orange from reaching the genetic compartments and subsequent damaging DNA through intercalative binding. Direct adsorption of acridine orange on chitosan derivatives was ruled out as a possible mechanism of protection on the basis of spectrophotometric measurements. Dependence of the antimutagenic properties of the studied chitosan derivatives on the degree of substitution was reversed in experiments involving acridine orange and ofloxacin, which also indicated different mechanisms of protection involved in these two cases.
