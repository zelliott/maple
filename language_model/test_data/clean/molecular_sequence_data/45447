The EF-hand family of calcium-binding proteins regulates cellular signal transduction events via calcium-dependent interactions with target proteins. Here, we show that the COOH-terminal tail of the leech homolog of protein phosphatase 4 regulatory subunit 2 (PP4-R2) interacts with the small neuronal EF-hand calcium-binding protein, Calsensin, in a calcium-dependent manner. Using two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and chemical shift perturbations we have identified and mapped the residues of Calsensin that form a binding surface for PP4-R2. We show that the binding groove is formed primarily of discontinuous hydrophobic residues located in helix 1, the hinge region, and helix 4 of the unicornate-type four helix structure of Calsensin. The findings suggest the possibility that calcium-dependent modulation of phosphatase complexes through interactions with small calcium-binding proteins may be a general mechanism for regulation of signal transduction pathways.
