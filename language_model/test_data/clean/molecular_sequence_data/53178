A new SHV-derived extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (SHV-24) conferring high-level resistance to ceftazidime but not cefotaxime and cefazolin was identified in Japan. This enzyme was encoded by a transferable 150-kb plasmid from an Escherichia coli clinical isolate. The pI and K(m) for CAZ of this enzyme were 7.5 and 30 microM, respectively. SHV-24 was found to have a D179G substitution in the Omega-loop of the enzyme.
