The polysaccharide part of the lipopolysaccharide obtained from an enteroaggregative Escherichia coli strain isolated from a young child with diarrhoea in Santiago, Chile (strain 73-1) was investigated. Sugar and methylation analyses of native and partially degraded polysaccharide together with 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy revealed that the polysaccharide is built of pentasaccharide repeating units. The structure of the repeating unit of E. coli strain 73-1 O-polysaccharide is (formula: see text)
