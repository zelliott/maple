The members of the RCK family of cloned voltage-dependent K+ channels are quite homologous in primary structure, but they are highly diverse in functional properties. RCK4 channels differ from RCK1 and RCK2 channels in inactivation and permeation properties, the sensitivity to external TEA, and to current modulation by external K+ ions. Here we show several other interesting differences: While RCK1 and RCK2 are blocked in a voltage and concentration dependent manner by internal Mg2+ ions, RCK4 is only weakly blocked at very high potentials. The single-channel current-voltage relations of RCK4 are rather linear while RCK2 exhibits an inwardly rectifying single-channel current in symmetrical K+ solutions. The deactivation of the channels, measured by tail current protocols, is faster in RCK4 by a factor of two compared with RCK2. In a search for the structural motif responsible for these differences, point mutants creating homology between RCK2 and RCK4 in the pore region were tested. The single-point mutant K533Y in the background of RCK4 conferred the properties of Mg2+ block, tail current kinetics, and inward ion permeation of RCK2 to RCK4. This mutant was previously shown to be responsible for the alterations in external TEA sensitivity and channel regulation by external K+ ions. Thus, this residue is expected to be located at the external side of the pore entrance. The data are consistent with the idea that the mutation alters the channel occupancy by K+ and thereby indirectly affects internal Mg2+ block and channel closing.
