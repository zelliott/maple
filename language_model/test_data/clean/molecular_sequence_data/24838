We show that Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), and more specifically just its intact N-terminal domain, binds to the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) in the endoplasmic reticulum and promotes its cell surface expression. This interaction is specific as JAK1 has no effect. Residues 32 to 58 of the JAK2 JH7 domain are required for EpoR surface expression. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the EpoR membrane proximal region reveals two modes of EpoR-JAK2 interaction. A continuous block of EpoR residues is required for functional, ligand-independent binding to JAK2 and cell surface receptor expression, whereas four specific residues are essential in switching on prebound JAK2 after ligand binding. Thus, in addition to its kinase activity required for cytokine receptor signaling, JAK is also an essential subunit required for surface expression of cytokine receptors.
