The primary structures of three human forms of secretory carrier membrane proteins (SCAMPs) have been deduced from full-length clones isolated from a HeLa cell cDNA library and confirmed by a combination of comparison to expressed sequence tags, microsequencing of purified protein, and in vitro transcription and translation. The structures indicated that SCAMPs are highly related products of distinct genes, and that the sequence identity of an individual SCAMP between different mammalian species is almost complete. Analysis of the distribution of SCAMPs among different mammalian tissues and cells indicates parallel expression of polypeptides and cognate mRNAs, and indicates that the three SCAMPs are usually but not always expressed together. The apparent M(r)s of two SCAMPs (1 and 2) do not vary appreciably among species, while that of the third (SCAMP3) is approximately 2 kDa larger in rodent cells than in humans. Examination of the codistribution of the three forms within individual cells using double label immunofluorescence indicates extensive colocalization of SCAMP2 and SCAMP3 with endogenous SCAMP1, however, subcellular regions enriched for a particular SCAMP are readily visible. These findings suggest that the SCAMPs may largely function at the same sites during vesicular transport rather than in separate post-Golgi recycling pathways.
