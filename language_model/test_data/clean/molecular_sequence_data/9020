In this study, we have cloned and characterized a cycloalkanone monooxygenase (CAMO) from the ascomycete Cylindrocarpon radicicola ATCC 11011 (identical to Cylindrocarpon destructans DSM 837). The primary structure of this Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase (BMVO) revealed 531 residues with around 45% sequence identity to known cyclohexanone monooxygenases. The enzyme was functionally overexpressed in Escherichia coli and investigated with respect to substrate spectrum and kinetic parameters. Substrate specificity studies revealed that a large variety of cycloaliphatic and bicycloaliphatic ketones are converted by this CAMO. A high catalytic efficiency against cyclobutanone was observed and seems to be a particular property of this BVMO. The thus produced butyrolactone derivatives are valuable building blocks for the synthesis of a variety of natural products and bioactive compounds. Furthermore, the enzyme revealed activity against open-chain ketones such as cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl methyl ketone which have not been reported to be accepted by typical cyclohexanone monooxygenases. These results suggest that the BVMO from C. radicicola indeed might be rather unique and since no BVMOs originating from eukaryotic organisms have been produced recombinantly so far, this study provides the first example for such an enzyme.
