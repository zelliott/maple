A diuretic hormone of unusual structure was isolated from extracts of whole heads of the mealworm Tenebrio molitor. The hormone is a 37-aa peptide of 4371 Da, with the sequence SPTISITAPIDVLRKTWEQERARKQMVKNREFLNSLN. This peptide increases cAMP production in Malpighian tubules of T. molitor. The amino acid sequence reveals that this peptide is a member of the family of sauvagine/corticotropin-releasing factor/urotensin I-related insect diuretic hormones. The C-terminal sequence of this peptide is quite different from other members of this family, which have a hydrophobic C terminus (isoleucinamide or valinamide). When aligned comparably, T. molitor diuretic hormone has a more hydrophilic C terminus, leucylasparagine (free acid). In contrast to all other known diuretic hormones of this family, this peptide has exceptionally low stimulatory activity on cAMP production in Malpighian tubules of Manduca sexta. However, at nanomolar concentrations it stimulates cAMP production in Malpighian tubules of T. molitor. Diuretic hormones of this family have been isolated previously from Lepidoptera, Orthoptera, Dictyoptera, and Diptera. This appears to be the first diuretic hormone isolated from a coleopteran insect.
