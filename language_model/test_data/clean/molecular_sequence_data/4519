The vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) family is essential to vesicle-mediated protein transport. Three mammalian isoforms, VAMP-1, VAMP-2, and cellubrevin, play a role in protein transport to the plasma membrane. In this study, we describe a new rat VAMP-1 isoform produced by alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Only one VAMP-1 isoform dominates in each tissue. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence for the newly discovered isoform, VAMP-1b, reveals that its expression is determined by whether an intron is retained or removed. The predicted amino acid sequences for the VAMP-1 isoforms differ at the carboxy-terminal end of the protein. A similar process has been described for VAMPs in Drosophila melanogaster and suggests a conserved function for the carboxy-terminal domain that can be modulated.
