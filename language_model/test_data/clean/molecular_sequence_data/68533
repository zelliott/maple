The activation of the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) by the DNA alkylating agents ethyl methanesulfonate, methyl methanesulfonate, and mitomycin C was observed in human B lymphocytes transiently transfected with plasmids in which the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) directed the expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Deletion of the two NF-kappa B-binding sites of LTR abolished the HIV-1 activation induced by the three mutagens, while deletion of the three Sp1-binding sites slightly reduced it. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed an increased binding to the kappa B sites of HIV-1 LTR in the nuclear extracts of human B lymphocytes upon mutagen treatment, while binding to Sp1 sites was unaffected. The TAR region was also involved in the mutagen-mediated activation of HIV-1 LTR inasmuch as a small deletion in the TAR sequence (nucleotides +34 to +37) greatly decreased the induction of HIV-1 expression. Moreover, an enhanced binding activity to the TAR DNA sequence (nucleotides +24 to +47) was observed in nuclear extracts of mutagen-treated lymphocytes. Thus, both the enhancer and the 5'-untranslated region of HIV-1 functionally cooperate in the mutagen-mediated induction of HIV-1 expression.
