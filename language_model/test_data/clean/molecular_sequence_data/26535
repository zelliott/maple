The Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii) is a hypoxia-tolerant species that lives at an altitude of 4,000-5,000 m above sea level on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. Myoglobin is an oxygen-binding cytoplasmic hemoprotein that is abundantly expressed in oxidative skeletal and cardiac myocytes. Numerous studies have implicated that hypoxia regulates myoglobin expression to allow adaptation to conditions of hypoxic stress. Few studies have yet looked at the effect of myoglobin on the adaptation to severe environmental stress on TA. To investigate how the Tibetan antelope (TA) has adapted to a high altitude environment at the molecular level, we cloned and analyzed the myoglobin gene from TA, compared the expression of myoglobin mRNA and protein in cardiac and skeletal muscle between TA and low altitude sheep. The results indicated that the full-length myoglobin cDNA is composed of 1154 bp with a 111 bp 5' untranslated region (UTR), a 578 bp 3' UTR and a 465 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 154 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 17.05 kD. The TA myoglobin cDNA sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence were highly homologous with that of other species. When comparing the myoglobin sequence from TA with the Ovis aries myoglobin sequence, variations were observed at codons 21 (GGT→GAT) and 78 (GAA→AAG), and these variations lead to changes in the corresponding amino acids, i.e., Gly→Asp and Glu→Lys, respectively. But these amino acid substitutions are unlikely to effect the ability of binding oxygen because their location is less important, which is revealed by the secondary structure and 3D structure of TA myoglobin elaborated by homology modeling. However, the results of myoglobin expression in cardiac and skeletal muscles showed that they were both significantly higher than that in plain sheep not only in mRNA but also protein level. We speculated that the higher expression of myoglobin in TA cardiac and skeletal muscles improves their ability to obtain and store oxygen under hypoxic conditions. This study indicated that TA didn't improve the ability of carrying oxygen by changing the molecular structure of myoglobin, but through increasing the expression of myoglobin in cardiac and skeletal muscles.
