Tight junctions are directly involved in regulating the passage of ions and macromolecules (gate functions) in epithelial and endothelial cells. The modulation of these gate functions to transiently regulate the paracellular permeability of large solutes and ions could increase the delivery of pharmacological agents or gene transfer vectors. To reduce the inflammatory responses caused by tight junction-regulating agents, alternative strategies directly targeting specific tight junction proteins could prove to be less toxic to airway epithelia. The apical delivery of peptides corresponding to the first extracellular loop of occludin to transiently modulate apical paracellular flux has been demonstrated in intestinal epithelia. We hypothesized that apical application of these occludin peptides could similarly modulate tight junction permeability in airway epithelia. Thus, we investigated the effects of apically applied occludin peptide on the paracellular permeability of molecular tracers and viral vectors in well differentiated human airway epithelial cells. The effects of occludin peptide on cellular toxicity, tight junction protein expression and localization, and membrane integrity were also assessed. Our data showed that apically applied occludin peptide significantly reduced transepithelial resistance in airway epithelia and altered tight junction permeability in a concentration-dependent manner. These alterations enhanced the paracellular flux of dextrans as well as gene transfer vectors. The occludin peptide redistributed occludin but did not alter the expression or distribution of ZO-1, claudin-1, or claudin-4. These data suggest that specific targeting of occludin could be a better-suited alternative strategy for tight junction modulation in airway epithelial cells compared with current agents that modulate tight junctions.
