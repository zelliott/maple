Novel biodegradable bacterial plastics, made up of units of 3-hydroxy-n-phenylalkanoic acids, are accumulated intracellularly by Pseudomonas putida U due to the existence in this bacterium of (i) an acyl-CoA synthetase (encoded by the fadD gene) that activates the aryl-precursors; (ii) a beta-oxidation pathway that affords 3-OH-aryl-CoAs, and (iii) a polymerization-depolymerization system (encoded in the pha locus) integrated by two polymerases (PhaC1 and PhaC2) and a depolymerase (PhaZ). The complete assimilation of these compounds requires two additional routes that specifically catabolize the phenylacetyl-CoA or the benzoyl-CoA generated from these polyesters through beta-oxidation. Genetic studies have allowed the cloning, sequencing, and disruption of the genes included in the pha locus (phaC1, phaC2, and phaZ) as well as those related to the biosynthesis of precursors (fadD) or to the catabolism of their derivatives (acuA, fadA, and paa genes). Additional experiments showed that the blockade of either fadD or phaC1 hindered the synthesis and accumulation of plastic polymers. Disruption of phaC2 reduced the quantity of stored polymers by two-thirds. The blockade of phaZ hampered the mobilization of the polymer and decreased its production. Mutations in the paa genes, encoding the phenylacetic acid catabolic enzymes, did not affect the synthesis or catabolism of polymers containing either 3-hydroxyaliphatic acids or 3-hydroxy-n-phenylalkanoic acids with an odd number of carbon atoms as monomers, whereas the production of polyesters containing units of 3-hydroxy-n-phenylalkanoic acids with an even number of carbon atoms was greatly reduced in these bacteria. Yield-improving studies revealed that mutants defective in the glyoxylic acid cycle (isocitrate lyase(-)) or in the beta-oxidation pathway (fadA), stored a higher amount of plastic polymers (1.4- and 2-fold, respectively), suggesting that genetic manipulation of these pathways could be useful for isolating overproducer strains. The analysis of the organization and function of the pha locus and its relationship with the core of the phenylacetyl-CoA catabolon is reported and discussed.
