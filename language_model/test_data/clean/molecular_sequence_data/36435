Based on both the occurrence of families of DNA sequences complementary in the same direction in different genomes and the physical possibility of DNA forming a parallel double helix, we postulate an unusual enzymatic synthesis of parallel DNA on a DNA template from its 5'-end. We discuss the assumed evolutionary aspects of this problem and suggest ways to check the hypothesis.
