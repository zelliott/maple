Fertilization of Urechis caupo oocytes stimulates dramatic changes in the pattern of protein synthesis. This shift is brought about entirely through selective translation of the large pool of maternal mRNAs synthesized and stored during oogenesis. My laboratory has identified cDNA clones to more than 20 different Urechis maternal mRNAs. These have been used to determine whether the complementary mRNAs are translated in oocytes or embryos, and to analyze the polyadenylation status of the mRNAs at different stages. For 14 of the mRNAs, multiple, overlapping cDNA clones were isolated, and the complete sequence of the mRNA molecule was determined. Of these 14 mRNAs, half are from the subset that is translated in growing and full-grown oocytes, but not in embryos. These 7 mRNAs have poly(A) tails before fertilization. The other 7 are from the subset that is not translated at any time before fertilization, and has very short poly(A) tails in oocytes. After fertilization these mRNAs are recruited onto polysomes and extensively polyadenylated. The sequence data from the two classes of maternal mRNAs was compared in an attempt to identify consensus sequences that could regulate translation directly, or indirectly, by controlling polyadenylation or secondary structure formation. Two features of the sequences correlate very well with the translation and polyadenylation of the different mRNAs--the identity of the base immediately preceding the AUG start codon, and the presence of the sequences UUUUA and UUUUUA in the 3' untranslated region.
