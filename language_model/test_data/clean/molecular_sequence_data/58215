A hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) gene bearing the 39-amino-acid-long domain A of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) within the HBcAg immunodominant loop has been constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli. Chimeric capsids demonstrated HBs but not HBc antigenicity and elicited in mice B-cell and T-cell responses against native HBcAg and HBsAg.
