A panel of single and double neutralization-resistant escape mutants of serotype G11 porcine rotavirus strains A253 and YM, selected with G11 monotype- and serotype-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to VP7, was tested in neutralization assays with hyperimmune sera raised against rotavirus strains of different serotypes. Escape mutants with an amino acid substitution in antigenic region A (amino acids [aa] 87 to 101) resulting in a residue identical or chemically similar to those present at the same positions in serotype G3 strains, at positions 87 for strain A253 and 96 for strain YM, were significantly more sensitive than the parental strains to neutralization with sera against some serotype G3 strains. Also, one YM antigenic variant (YM-5E6.1) acquired reactivity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with MAbs 159, 57/8, and YO-1E2, which react with G3 strains, but not with the serotype G11 parental strain YM. Cross-adsorption studies suggested that the observed cross-neutralization by the G3-specific sera was due to the sera containing antibodies reactive with the parental strain plus antibodies reactive with the epitope(s) on the antigenic variant that mimick the serotype G3 specific one(s). Moreover, antibodies reactive with antigenic region F (aa 235 to 242) of VP7 might also be involved since cross-reactivity to serotype G3 was decreased in double mutants carrying an additional mutation, which creates a potential glycosylation site at position 238. Thus, single point mutations can affect the serotype reactivity of G11 porcine rotavirus strains with both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and may explain the origin of rotavirus strains with dual serotype specificity based on sequence divergence of VP7.
