Eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens. The 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. Alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated I Bi-2 to I Bi-6 (for P. intermedia) and 2Bi-2 (for P. nigrescens) with the 16S rRNA suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. A 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated Bi) reliably detected both species. Because of the high degree of concordance between the 16S rRNAs of both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. Thus probe I Bi-I recognised P. intermedia while I Bi-I detected both P. intermedia and P. nigrescens at low stringency. However, under conditions of high stringency only P. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2Bi-I. These probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with DNA from the closely related P. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as Prevotella melaninogenica, P. denticola, P. loescheii, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Py. endodontalis, Py. gingivalis, Py. levii, and Py. macacae.
