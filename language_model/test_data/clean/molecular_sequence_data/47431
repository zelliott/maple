Subunit 3 (Rpb3) of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II is a homologue of the alpha subunit of prokaryotic RNA polymerase, which plays a key role in subunit assembly of this complex enzyme by providing the contact surfaces for both beta and beta' subunits. Previously we demonstrated that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rpb3 protein forms a core subassembly together with Rpb2 (the beta homologue) and Rpb11 (the second alpha homologue) subunits, as in the case of the prokaryotic alpha2beta complex. In order to obtain further insight into the physiological role(s) of Rpb3, we subjected the S. pombe rpb3 gene to mutagenesis. A total of nine temperature-sensitive (Ts) and three cold-sensitive (Cs) S. pombe mutants have been isolated, each (with the exception of one double mutant) carrying a single mutation in the rpb3 gene in one of the four regions (A D) that are conserved between the homologues of eukaryotic subunit 3. The three Cs mutations were all located in region A, in agreement with the central role of the corresponding region in the assembly of prokaryotic RNA polymerase; the Ts mutations, in contrast, were found in all four regions. Growth of the Ts mutants was reduced to various extents at non-permissive temperatures. Since the metabolic stability of most Ts mutant Rpb3 proteins was markedly reduced at non-permissive temperature, we predict that these mutant Rpb3 proteins are defective in polymerase assembly or the mutant RNA polymerases containing mutant Rpb3 subunits are unstable. In accordance with this prediction, the Ts phenotype of all the mutants was suppressed to varying extents by overexpression of Rpb11, the pairing partner of Rpb3 in the core subassembly. We conclude that the majority of rpb3 mutations affect the assembly of Rpb3, even though their effects on subunit assembly vary depending on the location of the mutation considered.
