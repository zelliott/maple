RNA and ribonuclease-resistant RNA analogs that bound and neutralized Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) were isolated from a large pool of random sequences by multiple cycles of in vitro selection using infectious viral particles. The selected RNA pool of RSV-binding sequences at a concentration of 0.16 microM completely neutralized the virus. Of 19 sequences cloned from the selected pool, 5 inhibited RSV infection. The selected RNA and RNA analogs were shown to neutralize RSV by interacting with the virus, rather than by adversely affecting the host cells. The selection of the anti-RSV RNA and RNA analogs by intact virions immediately suggests the potential application of this approach to develop RNA and RNA analogs as inhibitors of other viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus.
