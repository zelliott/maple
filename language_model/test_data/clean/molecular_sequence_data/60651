Pyridoxal reductase (PL reductase), which catalyzes reduction of PL by NADPH to form pyridoxine and NADP(+), was purified from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The purified enzyme was very unstable but was stabilized by low concentrations of various detergents such as Tween 40. The enzyme was a monomeric protein with the native molecular weight of 41,000 +/- 1,600. The enzyme showed a single absorption peak at 280 nm (E(1%) = 10.0). PL and 2-nitrobenzaldehyde were excellent substrates, and no measurable activity was observed with short chain aliphatic aldehydes; substrate specificity of PL reductase was obviously different from those of yeast aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) so far purified. The peptide sequences of PL reductase were identical with those in a hypothetical 333-amino acid protein from S. pombe (the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank(TM) accession number D89205). The gene corresponding to this protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified protein was found to have PL reductase activity. The recombinant PL reductase showed the same properties as those of native PL reductase. PL reductase showed only low sequence identities with members of AKR superfamily established to date; it shows the highest identity (18.5%) with human Shaker-related voltage-gated K(+) channel beta2 subunit. The elements of secondary structure of PL reductase, however, distributed similarly to those demonstrated in the three-dimensional structure of human aldose reductase except that loop A region is lost, and loop B region is extended. Amino acid residues involved in substrate binding or catalysis are also conserved. Conservation of these features, together with the major modifications, establish PL reductase as the first member of a new AKR family, AKR8.
