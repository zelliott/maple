The defective prophage of Bacillus subtilis 168, PBSX, is a chromosomally based element which encodes a non-infectious phage-like particle with bactericidal activity. PBSX is induced by agents which elicit the SOS response. In a PBSX thermoinducible strain which carries the xhi1479 mutation, PBSX is induced by raising the growth temperature from 37 degrees C to 48 degrees C. A 1.2-kb fragment has been cloned which complements the xhi1479 mutation. The nucleotide sequence of this fragment contains an open reading frame (ORF) which encodes a protein of 113 amino acids (aa). This aa sequence resembles that of other bacteriophage repressors and suggests that the N-terminal region forms a helix-turn-helix motif, typical of the DNA-binding domain of many bacterial regulatory proteins. The ORF is preceded by four 15-bp direct repeats, each of which contains an internal palindromic sequence, and by sequences resembling a SigA-dependent promoter. The nt sequence of an equivalent fragment from the PBSX thermoinducible strain has also been determined. There are three aa differences within the ORF compared to the wild type, one of which lies within the helix-turn-helix segment. This ORF encodes a repressor protein of PBSX.
