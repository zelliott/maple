Two new triterpenoid saponins, 3-O-{[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)]-[alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1- ->3)]- alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl}-ursolic acid-28-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl] ester (indicasaponin A), 3-O-{[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)]-[alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1- ->3)]- alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl}-oleanolic acid-28-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl] ester (indicasaponin B) and two known triterpenoid saponins, 3-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->3)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl]-ur solic acid-28-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl] ester, 3-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->3)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl]-olean olic acid-28-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl] ester have been isolated from Fagonia indica. The structures were determined primarily by NMR spectroscopy. The assignment of NMR signals was performed by means of 1H-1H COSY, NOESY, ROESY, TOCSY, HMQC and HMBC experiments.
