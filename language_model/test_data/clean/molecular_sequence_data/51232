A gene encoding a subunit of the 12S storage globulin, cruciferin, in Brassica napus (oilseed rape) has been isolated and characterized. The gene consists of about 2200 bp including three short intervening sequences. Primer extension analysis showed that the major transcription start site is located 30 bp 5' of the predicted ATG start codon. This gene belongs to one of three different major families encoding cruciferin subunits. By use of gene-family-specific probes and Southern blotting analysis the number of genes of the three different cruciferin subtypes in B. napus was estimated.
