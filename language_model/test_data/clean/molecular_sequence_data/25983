Both a neutral and an acidic polymer have been isolated from a lipopolysaccharide extract of the reference strain for Serratia marcescens serogroup O22. The neutral polymer has a linear structure with the repeating unit shown. The same tetrasaccharide unit also forms the backbone of the branched neutral polymer isolated from the reference strain for serogroup O10, which cross-reacts strongly with O22. ----2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1----2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1----3)-alpha-L-+ ++Rhap-(1----3)-alpha- D-GlcpNAc-(1----
