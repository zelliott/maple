Interaction of the RecA protein with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was analyzed by challenge with the hydroxyl radical, which can cleave the DNA backbone. We found that RecA protein induces cleavage by the radical at a defined distance from the 5' end. The cleavage was at the 11th nucleotide in many oligodeoxynucleotides. Cleavage may be intermittent since a second cleavage was induced at the 22nd or 21st site. This specific cleavage was observed under optimal conditions for filament formation, homologous pairing and strand exchange. Specificity in cleavage was, however, decreased by replacement of ATP by adenosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate (ATP gamma S), replacement of RecA protein by a mutant (RecA1) protein, or an increase in Mg2+ concentration. We propose that RecA protein induces a special structural alteration, such as bending, perhaps sequentially, on ssDNA and that this altered site plays an important role in homologous pairing and strand exchange.
