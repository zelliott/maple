We have cloned the Cephalosporium acremonium pyr4 gene by cross-hybridization with the equivalent gene from Neurospora crassa, the closest relative from which this gene is available. The C. acremonium pyr4 gene complements an E. coli pyrF mutant lacking orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase (OMPdecase), and most probably does not contain introns. Maxicell analysis in E. coli shows that it encodes a 46 kDa polypeptide. The C. acremonium OMPdecase contains a highly conserved pentadecapeptide characteristic for this category of enzyme. Extensive sequence comparison suggests an important role of this region in enzymatic activity.
