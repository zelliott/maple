A cDNA encoding a novel G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) was isolated from a human cerebral cortex cDNA library by low stringency hybridization screening. This putative seven-transmembrane domain receptor of 469 amino acids was designated SALPR (Somatostatin- and Angiotensin- Like Peptide Receptor). SALPR shares the highest amount of amino acid similarity with the somatostatin (35% with SSTR5) and angiotensin receptors (31% with AT1). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that the SALPR mRNA is predominantly expressed in human brain regions, particularly the substantia nigra and pituitary, although the mRNA can also be detected in the peripheral tissues, albeit at low levels. Chromosomal mapping by radiation hybrid analysis localized the human SALPR gene to the chromosome 5p15.1-5p14. Transient expression of SALPR in COS-1 cells did not produce any binding sites for somatostatin or angiotensin II, indicating the necessity for further study to discover its ligand and physiological significance.
