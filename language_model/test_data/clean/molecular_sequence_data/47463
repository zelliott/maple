A human homolog(RALY) of the mouse Raly gene was isolated and sequenced, and shown to encode a novel protein isoform containing a 16 amino acid in-frame insert in the variable region of the protein. Analysis of the corresponding region of the mouse Raly gene demonstrated that this novel protein isoform is also present in the mouse. Comparative analysis of RALY cDNA and EST sequences suggests the presence of additional alternatively processed RALY transcripts. As in the mouse, the human RALY gene is widely expressed as a 1.7-kb transcript.
