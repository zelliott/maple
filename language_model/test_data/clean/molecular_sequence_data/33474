The Cys-loop receptor superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels has a prominent role in neuronal signalling. These receptors are pentamers, each subunit containing ten beta-strands in the extracellular domain and four alpha-helical transmembrane domains (M1-M4). The M2 domain of each subunit lines the intrinsic ion channel pore and residues within the extracellular domain form ligand binding sites. Ligand binding initiates a conformational change that opens the ion-selective pore. The coupling between ligand binding in the extracellular domain and opening of the intrinsic ion channel pore located in the membrane is not fully understood. Several loop structures, such as loop 2, the Cys-loop, the pre-M1 region and the M2-M3 loop have been implicated in receptor activation. The current "conformational change wave" hypothesis suggests that binding of a ligand initiates a rotation of the beta-sheets around an axis that passes through the Cys-loop. Due to this rotation, the Cys-loop and loop 2 are displaced. Movement of the M2-M3 loop then twists the M2 domain leading to a separation of the helices and opening of the pore. The publication of a crystal structure of an acetylcholine binding protein and the refined structure of the Torpedo marmorata acetylcholine receptor have improved the understanding of the mechanisms and structures involved in coupling ligand binding to channel gating. In this review, the most recent findings on some of these loop structures will be reported and discussed in view of their role in the gating mechanism.
