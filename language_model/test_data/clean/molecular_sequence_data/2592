Analysis of resistant mutants to neutralizing monoclonal antibodies revealed a discontinuous neutralization epitope on VP1 of poliovirus type 1, Mahoney. The epitope has the unique property of being also part of a sequential epitope within neutralization antigenic site I (N-AgI). It is formed by residues in the loop 96-104 connecting the B and C strand and in the loop 141-152 connecting the D and E strand of VP1. Because of strong analogy to neutralization immunogen IB (NImIB) of human rhinovirus 14 (HRV-14) we have called this site N-AgIB of poliovirus type 1.
