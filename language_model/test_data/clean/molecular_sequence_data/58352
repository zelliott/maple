The inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases are an enlarging family of enzymes that terminate the signals generated by the phosphoinositide kinases and phospholipase C. Given the diverse signalling functions of both the polyphosphoinositides and Ins(1,4,5)P3, it is predicted that the 5-phosphatases will play a critical role in regulating many cellular events, in particular membrane trafficking and cell growth.
