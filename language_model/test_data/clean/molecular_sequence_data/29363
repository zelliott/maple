Using computational analysis, a novel superfamily of beta-strand-rich domains was identified in the Molybdenum cofactor sulfurase and several other proteins from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. These MOSC domains contain an absolutely conserved cysteine and occur either as stand-alone forms such as the bacterial YiiM proteins, or fused to other domains such as a NifS-like catalytic domain in Molybdenum cofactor sulfurase. The MOSC domain is predicted to be a sulfur-carrier domain that receives sulfur abstracted by the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent NifS-like enzymes, on its conserved cysteine, and delivers it for the formation of diverse sulfur-metal clusters. The identification of this domain may clarify the mechanism of biogenesis of various metallo-enzymes including Molybdenum cofactor-containing enzymes that are compromised in human type II xanthinuria.
