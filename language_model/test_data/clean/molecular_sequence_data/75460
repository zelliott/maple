Ribosomal protein S6 was isolated from rat liver ribosomes by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and subjected to cyanogen bromide and proteolytic cleavages. The cleavage fragments were resolved by HPLC and sequenced by automated Edman degradation. The overall amino acid sequence of S6 (249 residues) was determined by alignment of the overlapping sequences of selected cyanogen bromide, chymotryptic, tryptic, and clostripain cleavage fragments. The only protein found to exhibit close homology with the S6 sequence is yeast ribosomal protein S10 (61% sequence identity). Previously, characterized phosphopeptide derivatives of S6 containing phosphorylation sites for adenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate dependent and protease-activated protein kinases originate from the carboxy-terminal region of S6 encompassing residues 233-249.
