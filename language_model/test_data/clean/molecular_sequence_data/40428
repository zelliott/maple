To investigate the association of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) IVS10+12 G>A in hMSH2 gene with colorectal cancer in a Chinese population of Jiangsu province.

A case-control study to investigate whether this SNP affects the risk of developing colorectal cancer was conducted. Subjects included 108 colorectal cancer patients and 180 healthy individuals. Peripheral white blood cell DNA was obtained from all subjects. The hMSH2 gene IVS10+12 G>A was genotyped using a PCR-based DHPLC, the existence of IVS10+12 G>A was verified by DNA sequencing.

The allele frequency of the IVS10+12 G>A in the hMSH2 gene in the healthy individuals was 51.7%. There was significant difference in the frequency of the IVS10+12 G>A between patients and healthy controls (P<0.05), and between familial patients and healthy controls (P<0.05). There was also significant difference of the frequency of the IVS10+12 G>A between patients younger than 50 years, and patients with high consumption of fried food and pickled vegetable and healthy controls respectively (P<0.05).

This SNP may be associated with colorectal cancers in Chinese. Further investigation with larger sample size is needed.
