Using a PKC-epsilon cDNA probe a cDNA for PKC-eta has been cloned from a rat lung cDNA library. When expressed in COS cells, rat PKC-eta appeared as an 84 kDa protein. PKC-eta expressed in COS cells, was solubilized by 1% Triton X-100 and purified away from the endogenous PKC-alpha by ammonium sulphate fractionation. The activity of this PKC-eta preparation was characterized with respect to cofactor dependence and substrate specificity. Various PKC pseudosubstrate peptides are phosphorylated by PKC-eta in a phospholipid and TPA-dependent but calcium-independent manner. The polypeptide histone IIIS is a poor substrate.
