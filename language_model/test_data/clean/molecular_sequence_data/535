The signal communication between various organelles is essential for cells of eukaryotic organisms. Vesicle trafficking is an important pathway for this kind of communication. Most of the membrane fusion is mediated by SNAREs (Soluble N-ethyl-maleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptors), which are highly conserved from various species. Compared with genomes of other eukaryotes, plant genome encodes an even higher number of SNAREs. Accumulating evidences support that plant SNAREs is a multifunctional protein family, which is involved in variety of biological processes. We review the recent advances on molecular mechanism and biological functions of plant SNAREs.
