A family of proteins containing a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain (ADAMs) has been identified recently. Here, we report the identification of a novel member of the ADAM protein family from mouse. This protein is designated ADAM 31. The complementary DNA sequence of ADAM 31 predicts a transmembrane protein with metalloproteinase, disintegrin, cysteine-rich, and cytoplasmic domains. Messenger RNA encoding ADAM 31 was most abundant in testes, but was also detected in many other tissues. More significantly, the antibodies raised against ADAM 31 reveal that the protein has a unique and restricted expression pattern. ADAM 31 is expressed in Leydig cells of the testes, but unlike many other ADAMs, it is not found on developing sperm. Furthermore, ADAM 31 is highly expressed on four types of specialized epithelia: the cauda epididymidis, the vas deferens, the convoluted tubules of the kidney, and the parietal cells of the stomach.
