A new oleanene-type saponin with potent anti-ulcerogenic activity was isolated from the flowers of Spartium junceum. The various techniques of NMR spectral analysis, viz. 1H, 13C, DEPT, C-H COSY, H-H COSY, COLOC, NOESY, HMBC, HMQC, in conjunction with EI- and FAB-mass spectrometry, revealed that the structure of the isolated saponin was 3-O-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2) -O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)-beta-D-glucuronopyranosyl]-3 beta,16beta,22 beta,24-tetrahydroxy-olean-12-ene and named as spartitrioside.
