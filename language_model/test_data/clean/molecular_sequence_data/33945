Strain HQM9, an aerobic, rod-shaped marine bacterium from red algae, can produce agarases and liquefy solid plating media efficiently when agar is used as a coagulant. Here we report the draft genome sequence and the initial findings from a preliminary analysis of strain HQM9, which should be a novel species of Flavobacteriaceae.
