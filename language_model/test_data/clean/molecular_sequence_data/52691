GTPases of the Rho family play important roles in human leukocyte signal transduction pathways; however, little is known about the function of these proteins in bovine cells. In the present studies, we isolated molecular clones of bovine Rac1, Rac2, and the Rac/Rho GTPase regulatory protein D4-GDP dissociation inhibitor (D4-GDI) from a bovine bone marrow cDNA library. These clones contained complete open reading frames, encoding 192, 192, and 200 amino acids, respectively. Comparison of the bovine amino acid sequences with those of other species demonstrated a high degree of identity of these proteins across all species, suggesting that these proteins likely play conserved functional roles in bovine leukocyte signal transduction pathways. Comparative Western blotting of these proteins in human and bovine neutrophil cytosol demonstrated that Rac2 was the predominant Rac species and that D4-GDI was the predominant GDI species in bovine neutrophil cytosol. Despite the high degree of homology between human and bovine Rac2, some of the anti-peptide antibody probes prepared against human Rac2 failed to recognize the bovine homologue. We also showed by subcellular fractionation techniques that Rac2 is localized primarily to the cytosolic compartment of resting bovine neutrophils, but is translocated to the plasma membrane after stimulation with PMA. These findings suggest that Rac2 does play a role in bovine neutrophil activation. In addition, these data will be helpful in developing more specific probes for investigating the role of these proteins in bovine leukocyte signal transduction pathways and for studying various inflammatory diseases in cattle.
