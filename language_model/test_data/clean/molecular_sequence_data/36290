The effect of glucose and other carbohydrates on the pigmentation of three atypical isolates of Aeromonas salmonicida indicated that the addition of D-glucose at a concentration of 0.1% (w/v) or more, inhibited pigment production and caused a reduction in the size of colonies. The addition of cAMP reversed the inhibitory effects of D-glucose on pigment production.
