Cyclic nucleotides modulate potassium (K) channel activity in many cells and are thought to act indirectly by inducing channel protein phosphorylation. Herein we report the isolation from rabbit of a gene encoding a K channel (Kcn1) that is specifically activated by cGMP and not by cAMP. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence (725 amino acids) indicates that, in addition to a core region that is highly homologous to Shaker K channels, Kcn1 also contains a cysteine-rich region similar to that of ligand-gated ion channels and a cyclic nucleotide-binding region. Northern blot analysis detects gene expression in kidney, aorta, and brain. Kcn1 represents a class of K channels that may be specifically regulated by cGMP and could play an important role in mediating the effects of substances, such as nitric oxide, that increase intracellular cGMP.
