At least three types of mRNA of the catalytic subunit of Na,K-ATPase namely alpha-,alpha+- and alpha 3-isoforms are identified in different tissues. Only two of them alpha and alpha+ have well known structural and catalytic properties. Here we present immunochemical data indicating that the alpha 3 protein really exists in pig and human kidney, and human brain. Crude membrane fractions and purified membrane-bound Na,K-ATPases were immunoblotted with alpha 3-specific antibodies raised against the synthetic peptide corresponding to the unique sequence of this isoform. The mature alpha 3-subunit is shown to include the sequence GDKKDDKSSPK followed by the initiating methionine residue. Nephron collecting tubules are proposed to specifically contain Na,K-ATPase alpha 3-isoform.
