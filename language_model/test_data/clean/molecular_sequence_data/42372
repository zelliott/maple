Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a 36 amino acid peptide belonging to the pancreatic polypeptide family of neuroendocrine hormones. It is the most abundant peptide yet discovered in the mammalian brain and is widely expressed by neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems as well as adrenal medullary cells. Recently, a large number of studies have focussed on the potential roles played by NPY within the hypothalamus and pituitary with respect to the control of food intake and energy homeostasis. It is now clear that NPY is a potent stimulator of food intake in models of hyperphagia, that hypothalamic NPY also regulates sympathetic neural activity and it appears that NPY may also influence the glucocorticoid, growth hormone and thyroid hormone axes. Taken together, current data suggest that hypothalamic and pituitary NPY-expressing cells represent an important and critical site of integration of peripheral hormonal signals with regulation of energy homeostasis.
