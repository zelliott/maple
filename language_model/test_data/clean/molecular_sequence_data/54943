We performed whole genome sequencing of 22 H9N2 avian influenza viruses (AIV) isolated from domestic laying hens on farms between 2005 and 2008, and compared the sequences with viruses previously reported in Asia. A previous study revealed that two antigenically distinct sublineages were established within the MS96 lineage by antigenic drift since the first H9N2 AIV outbreak in South Korea. We designated them as the 01310-like lineage and the 116/04-like lineage. Since late 2004, most identified isolates in Korea have belonged to the 116/04-like lineage, however, in this study we found that six among twenty-two isolates were belonged to 01310-like lineage, indicating that the genetic divergence is still occurring after 2004. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that five isolates among the defined 01310-like lineage had a 24 amino acid deletion in the neuraminidase stalk region, which were not in any other H9N2 isolates previously reported. The internal genes analysis demonstrated extensive reassortment events among isolates from poultry farms, live bird markets, and wild birds, and multiple new genotypes were identified. We identified several features of gene evolution in H9N2 AIV suggesting that the long-term H9N2 AIV surveillance study should be continued in South Korea.
