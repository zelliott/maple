Cells of Methanococcus jannaschii, grown at 65 degrees C in a defined medium, contained 7% of lipid composed of 87% polar and 13% neutral components. Within the polar fraction 16 lipids were resolved by thin-layer chromatography, 4 of which were present in trace amounts. Staining reactions demonstrated that the more abundant lipids were glycolipids, aminophospholipids, and an aminophosphoglycolipid. Most of the polar fraction (82%) consisted of five diether lipids, which were purified and their structures were resolved largely through nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry, and optical rotation methods. Macrocyclic diethers had the head groups phosphoethanolamine-(1----6)-beta-D-glucopyranose, beta-D-glucopyranose, and beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1----6)-beta-D-glucopyranose. Phosphoethanolamine was identified as a head group for both the noncyclized and macrocylic diether core lipids. The neutral lipids were mainly acyclic C30 isoprenoids, predominantly dihydro-, hexahydro, and octahydro-squalenes.
