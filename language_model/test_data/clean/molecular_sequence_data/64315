Comparison of the hypervariable region (269-279 bases in length) at the 5' end of the 16S rDNA sequences of 29 bacterial strains that were identified previously as Brevibacillus brevis showed that 13 strains clustered with Aneurinibacillus species, eight strains clustered with Bacillus species and eight strains clustered with Brevibacillus species. Based on DNA-DNA hybridization results, 27 strains, not including [Brevibacillus brevis] NCIMB 13288 and [Brevibacillus brevis] DSM 6472, were reidentified as Aneurinibacillus migulanus, Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus, Bacillus methanolicus, Bacillus oleronius, Brevibacillus agri, Brevibacillus brevis and Brevibacillus parabrevis. [Brevibacillus brevis] NCIMB 13288, which was located in the Aneurinibacillus cluster, showed low DNA-DNA relatedness (<14 %) and low 16S rDNA sequence similarity (96.8-97.9 %) to other Aneurinibacillus species. [Brevibacillus brevis] DSM 6472, which was located in the Brevibacillus cluster, also showed low DNA-DNA relatedness (<12 %) and low 16S rDNA sequence similarity (95.4-98.8 %) to other Brevibacillus species. These genotypic and phylogenetic data, plus phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, suggest that [Brevibacillus brevis] NCIMB 13288 (=IAM 15048) and [Brevibacillus brevis] DSM 6472 (=NRRL NRS-887) represent novel species of the genera Aneurinibacillus and Brevibacillus, respectively, for which the names Aneurinibacillus danicus sp. nov. and Brevibacillus limnophilus sp. nov. are proposed.
