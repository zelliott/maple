A recently discovered wild-type strain, Clostridium beijerinckii G117, is unique in producing butanol and acetone but negligible amounts of ethanol, unlike previously identified acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE)-generating microbes. Here we report the draft genome sequence of strain G117 (5,806,675 bp; GC content, 29.7%) and the novel findings obtained from its genome annotations.
