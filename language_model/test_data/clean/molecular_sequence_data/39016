Phospholipid-linked glycation products are supposed to play an important role in lipid oxidation in vivo. Independent syntheses and unequivocal structural characterization are reported for the phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE)-derived Amadori compound 4-hydroxy-4-oxo-1-[(palmitoyloxy)methyl]-9-(2,3,4,5-tetrahydrox ytetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-3,5-dioxa-8-aza-4lambda5-ph osphanon-1-yl palmitate, pyrrolecarbaldehyde 2-[[[2-[2-formyl-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1H-pyrrol-1-yl]ethoxy](hydroxy)phosph oryl]oxy]-1-[(palmitoyloxy)methyl]ethyl palmitate, the carboxymethyl (CM) derivative 7-hydroxy-7,13-dioxo-10-(palmitoyloxy)-6,8,12-trioxa-3-aza-+ ++7lambda5-phosphaoctacosan-1-oic acid, and the carboxyethyl (CE) derivative 7-hydroxy-2-methyl-7,13-dioxo-10-(palmitoyloxy)-6,8,12-trioxa++ +-3-aza-7lambda5-phosphaoctacosan-l-oic acid. With these reference compounds, a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) method for the determination of such PE-linked Maillard products has been developed.
