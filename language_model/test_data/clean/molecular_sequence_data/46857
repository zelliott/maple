Circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy have been used to determine the structure of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-binding peptide, comprising residues 130-152, of the human apolipoprotein E. This peptide has little persistent three-dimensional structure in solution, but when bound to micelles of dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) it adopts a predominantly alpha-helical structure. The three-dimensional structure of the DPC-bound peptide has been determined by using 1H-NMR spectroscopy: the structure derived from NOE-based distance constraints and restrained molecular dynamics is largely helical. The derived phi and psi angle order parameters show that the helical structure is well defined but with some flexibility that causes the structures not to be superimposable over the full peptide length. Deuterium exchange experiments suggest that many peptide amide groups are readily accessible to the solvent, but those associated with hydrophobic residues exchange more slowly, and this helix is thus likely to be positioned on the surface of the DPC micelles. In this conformation the peptide has one hydrophobic face and two that are rich in basic amino acid side chains. The solvent-exposed face of the peptide contains residues previously shown to be involved in binding to the LDL receptor.
