The large HAD (haloacid dehalogenase) superfamily of hydrolases comprises P-type ATPases, phosphatases, epoxide hydrolases and L-2-haloacid dehalogenases. A comparison of the three-dimensional structure of L-2-haloacid dehalogenase with that of the response regulator protein CheY allowed the assignment of a conserved pair of aspartate residues as the Mg2+-binding site in the P-type ATPase and phosphatase members of the superfamily. From the resulting model of the active site, a conserved serine/threonine residue is suggested to be involved in phosphate binding, and a mechanism comprising a phosphoaspartate intermediate is postulated.
