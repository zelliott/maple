The HLA-B locus is the most polymorphic of the class I genes encoded within the human major histocompatibility complex. This polymorphism is mainly located in exons 2 and 3, which code for the molecule's alpha1 and alpha2 domains and includes the antigenic peptide binding site. However, information about adjacent non-coding regions (introns 1 and 2) has not been extensively reported but could be very important in establishing an understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms involved in the polymorphism generation of HLA-B and the Mhc loci. In the present work, introns 1 and 2 of 14 HLA-B alleles are studied and their significance is discussed; 10 have been sequenced in our own laboratory and the other 4 have been previously reported by others. Different serological families share the complete intron 1 sequence; at this region, 12 out of 14 HLA-B alleles could be included in four groups with the same intron 1 sequence: a) B*0702, B*4201, B*4801; b) B*27052, B*4002, B*4011; c) B*40012, B*4101, including B*4501, B*5001 (these latter two alleles have specific characteristics in both introns 1 and 2, which may reflect a common evolutionary pathway); and d) B*44031, B*44032. The other alleles, B*1402, and B*1801, do not have identical intron 1 sequences compared to any of the described groups, but share many similarities with them. The B*1801 evolutionary pathway seems to be very specific since it branches separately from other alleles both in intron 1 and intron 2 dendrograms. On the other hand, HLA-B allelic group distribution and similarities according to intron 1 sequences were not confirmed when using intron 2, especially in the cases of B*4002, B*4101 and B*4801. This would suggest that both point mutations fixed by genetic drift and gene conversion events are involved in HLA-B diversification. The latter events could be supported by the strong homology between intron 1 and, to a lesser extent, intron 2, and also the CG content within them. Finally, the precise knowledge of these non-coding regions could be important for developing DNA base typing strategies for the HLA-B alleles.
