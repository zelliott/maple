The Escherichia coli siderophore enterobactin is synthesized in response to iron starvation. 2,3-Dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase (EntA) produces 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (DHB), a biosynthetic intermediate. 2,3-Dihydroxybenzoate-AMP ligase (EntE) adenylates DHB, activating it for attachment to the NRPS substrate holo-EntB. Using analytical ultracentrifugation, we found that EntA undergoes concentration-dependent dimer-tetramer self-association (K(D) = 12.3 μM). We further found that EntA can form a specific complex with EntE. Pull-down assays revealed that recombinant EntA bait pulled down EntE from E. coli lysates, whereas recombinant EntE bait could pull down EntA. Addition of the SMCC cross-linker to a mixture of EntA and EntE resulted in a cross-linked product with a molecular mass of >250 kDa, suggesting a complex stoichiometry of one EntA tetramer and four EntE monomers. The effect of EntA on EntE activity was also examined. Addition of a 4-fold excess of EntA to an EntE assay mixture resulted in a 6-fold stimulation of EntE activity. EntA was also found to perturb the FRET signal between EntE donor residues and EntE-bound DHB. By following the EntA-dependent decrease in the magnitude of the EntE-DHB FRET signal, EntA-EntE binding behavior was found to be sigmoidal, suggesting the presence of both low- and high-affinity binding sites. The EntA-EntE interaction was also directly measured by isothermal titration calorimetry at 10 °C. The resulting binding isotherm fit well to a model describing two binding sites, supporting our AUC and fluorescence data. Taken together, our data show that tetrameric EntA optimally interacts with EntE, resulting in an enhancement of EntE activity.
