A cDNA library was constructed in lambda TriplEx2 vector using poly (A(+)) RNA from immature seeds of Cicer arietinum. The lectin gene was isolated from seeds of chickpea through library screening and RACE-PCR. The full-length cDNA of Chichpea seed lectin(CpGL)is 972 bp and contains a 807 bp open reading frame encoding a 268 amino acid protein. Analysis shows that CpSL gene has strong homology with other legume lectin genes. Phylogenetic analysis showed the existence of two main clusters and clearly indicated that CpSL belonged to mannose-specific family of lectins. RT-PCR revealed that CAA gene expressed constitutively in various plant tissues including flower, leaf, root and stem. When chickpea lectin mRNA level was checked in developing seeds, it was higher in 10 DAF seeds and decreased throughout seed development.
