A panel of bovine somatic cell hybrids was used to map ovine microsatellites. Five of seven microsatellites were assigned to five bovine syntenic groups. These microsatellites were designated D5S10 (MAF23), D1S4 (MAF46), D13S1 (MAF18), D4S3 (MAF50), and DXS2 (MAF45), mapped to syntenic groups U3 (chromosome 5), U10 (chromosome 1), U11, U13, and the X chromosome, respectively. Two remaining sheep microsatellites amplified rodent DNA in the hybrid somatic cell panel, and were not assigned to bovine syntenic groups. Assignment of ovine-derived microsatellites to bovine syntenic groups provides additional evidence of the usefulness of microsatellites for mapping closely related species. The use of ovine and bovine microsatellites will aid in development of comparative genomic maps for these two species.
