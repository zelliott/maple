Southern blot studies on Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) DNA integration in 13 human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) patients revealed the presence of several distinct HBV integration sites in different human liver disease patients. In one HCC patient the DNA fragment containing the HBV integration also hybridized to an erb B probe. The erb B/HBV co-migrating DNA fragment was cloned and sequenced, and showed that HBV DNA is integrated next to a cellular DNA fragment which is homologous to the tyrosine protein kinase domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor gene and other cell surface receptor genes. The virus-integrated cellular DNA sequence is expressed in this HCC patient, suggesting a possible role for this gene in hepatocarcinogenesis.
