The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule consists of noncovalently associated alpha and beta chains. In mammals studied so far, the class II MHC can be divided into a number of regions, each containing one or more alpha-chain genes (A genes) and beta-chain genes (B genes), and it has been known for some time that orthologous relationships exist between genes in corresponding regions from different mammalian species. A phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences of class II A and B genes confirmed these relationships; but no such orthologous relationship was observed between the B genes of mammals and those of birds. Thus, the class II regions have diverged since the separation of birds and mammals (approximately 300 Mya) but before the radiation of the placental mammalian orders (60-80 Mya). Comparison of the phylogenetic trees for A and B genes revealed an unexpected characteristic of DP-region genes: DPB genes are most closely related to DQB genes, whereas DPA chain genes are most closely related to DRA-chain genes. Thus, the DP region seems to have originated through a recombinational event which brought together a DQB gene and a DRA gene (perhaps approximately 120 Mya). The 5' untranslated region of all class II genes includes sequences which are believed to be important in regulating class II gene expression but which are not conserved in known pseudogenes. These sequences are conserved to an extraordinary degree in the human DQB1 gene and its mouse homologue A beta 1, suggesting that regulation of expression of this locus may play a key role in expression of the entire class II MHC.
