Sequence of the Puumala virus (PUU) Sotkamo strain L segment is provided, completing the total genome of this prototype PUU virus strain. The L segment is 6530 nucleotides long and it can encode 2156 amino-acids-long L protein, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The strain Sotkamo, originally isolated in Finland, showed for the L genome segment nucleotide (84.6%) and amino acid (97.3%) homology to a previously sequenced PUU Russian isolate, strain Bashkiria/CG1820 (B1820) and the L genome segment appeared to be at least as conserved as the S segment. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S, M and L segment sequences proposes that the three viral genes have a similar evolutionary history with no evidence for genome segment reassortment. Precise sequencing of the L segment termini demonstrated that the Puumala strains differ from the conserved sequences of the other hantaviruses at two positions.
