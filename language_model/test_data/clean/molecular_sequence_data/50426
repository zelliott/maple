Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains display a high degree of heterogeneity in their biological properties that correlate with in vivo pathogenesis of the virus. We previously demonstrated that overlapping regions encompassing the third hypervariable domain (V3), within the envelope glycoprotein gp120 determine the tropisms of HIV-1 for T-cell lines and primary macrophages. Studies with mutant viruses carrying one or more amino acid substitutions in the V3 loop have now identified this hypervariable domain as a major determinant for these cellular host range properties. Three to five amino acid changes in this domain, but rarely a single amino acid substitution, can confer macrophage tropism and alter T-cell-line tropism. These findings emphasize the effect on cell tropism of small amino acid differences in the viral envelope and suggest that the overall conformation of the V3 loop plays the major role in determining the ability of HIV-1 to infect T-cell lines and primary macrophages.
