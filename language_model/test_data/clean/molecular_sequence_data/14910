Nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain-1 (NOD1) is a cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor (PRR), and is a member of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family. It senses a wide range of bacteria and viruses or their products, and plays a key role in inducing innate immunity. In this report, NOD1 gene was cloned and characterized in rohu (Labeo rohita), a fish species of highest commercial importance in the Indian subcontinent. The full-length rohu NOD1 (rNOD1) cDNA comprised of 3168 bp with a single open reading frame (ORF) of 2814 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 937 amino acids (aa) with an estimated molecular mass of 106.13 kDa. Structurally, it comprised of one caspase recruitment domain (CARD) at N-terminal, seven leucine rich repeat (LRR) regions at C-terminal and one NACHT domain in between N and C-terminals. Phylogenetically, rNOD1 was closely related to grass carp NOD1 (gcNOD1), and exhibited significant similarity (95.8%) and identity (91.0%) in their amino acids. Ontogenic expression analysis of rNOD1 and its associated down-stream signaling molecule RICK (receptor interacting serineâ€“threonine kinase) by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed their constitutive expression in all embryonic developmental stages. Basal expression analysis of rNOD1 showed its wide range of expression in all examined tissues, highest was in spleen and the lowest was in blood. Inductive expression of rNOD1 was observed following LPS and poly I:C exposure, and Aeromonas hydrophila, Edwardsiella tarda and Shigella flexneri infections. Expression of RICK in various organs was significantly enhanced by ligands exposure and bacterial infections, and was correlated with the inductive expression of rNOD1. Together, these findings highlighted the important role of NOD1 in fish in response to pathogenic invasion.
