To search for the mutations RYR1 G1021A in families where malignant hyperthermia (MH) episodes have occurred, we have used an amplification-created restriction sites (ACRS) technique to detect the mutation. The previously described single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique was laborious and time consuming, but necessary to detect the mutation, whereas the method described here discriminates quickly and efficiently between homozygotes with the mutation, heterozygotes and homozygotes without the mutation.
