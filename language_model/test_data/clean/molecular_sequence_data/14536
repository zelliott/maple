The consortium responsible for the sequencing of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) genome initially focused on the sequencing of the euchromatic regions using a BAC-by-BAC strategy. We analyzed the compositional features of the whole collection of BAC sequences publically available. This analysis highlights specific peculiarities of heterochromatic and euchromatic BACs, in particular: the whole BAC collection has i) a large variability in repeat and gene content, ii) a positive and significant correlation of LTR retrotransposons of the Gypsy class with the repeat content and iii) the preferential location of the SINEs (short interspersed nuclear elements) in BAC sequences showing a low repeat content. Our results point out a typical design of the tomato chromosomes and pave the way for further investigations on the relationship between DNA primary structure and chromatin organization in Solanaceae genomes.
