Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Disease mechanisms in multiple sclerosis at the molecular level remain poorly understood and no reliable proteinaceous disease markers are available yet. The goal of the present study is the construction of a protein database of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) separated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins from multiple sclerosis patients. By means of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 65 different proteins were identified from 300 spots. Eighteen of these proteins have not been reported previously on 2-DE gels of CSF. Here we report on the identification of these proteins and discuss their potential relation to multiple sclerosis.
