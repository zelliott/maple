Structure prediction methods have been used to establish a domain structure for the voltage-dependent calcium channel beta subunit, beta1b. One domain was identified from homology searches as an SH3 domain, whilst another was shown, using threading algorithms, to be similar to yeast guanylate kinase. This domain structure suggested relatedness to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein family, and that the N-terminal domain of the beta subunit might be similar to a PDZ domain. Three-dimensional model structures have been constructed for these three domains. The extents of the domains are consistent with functional properties and mutational assays of the subunit, and provide a basis for understanding its modulatory function.
