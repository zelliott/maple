We report a case of primary cutaneous zygomycosis caused by Rhizomucor variabilis and review 6 cases reported from China that share similar features and are different from those cases caused by other species of Mucorales. It is noteworthy that all 6 of the cases were observed in 3 adjacent provinces of eastern China.
