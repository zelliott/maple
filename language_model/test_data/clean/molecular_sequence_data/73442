A complete endogenous type D viral genome has been isolated from a baboon genomic library. The provirus, simian endogenous retrovirus (SERV), is 8,393 nucleotides long and contains two long terminal repeats and complete genes for gag, pro, pol, and env. The primer binding site is complementary to tRNA(Lys)3, like in lentiviruses. The env GP70 protein is highly homologous to that of baboon endogenous virus (BaEV). PCR analysis of primate DNA showed that related proviral sequences are present in Old World monkeys of the subfamily Cercopithecinae but not in apes and humans. Analysis of virus and host sequences indicated that the proviral genomes were inherited from a common ancestor. Comparison of the evolution of BaEV, exogenous simian retrovirus types 1 to 3 (SRV1 to SRV3), and SERV suggests that SERV is ancestral to both BaEV and the SRVs.
