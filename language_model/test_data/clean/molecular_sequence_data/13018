Although many TATA-less promoters transcribed by RNA polymerase II initiate transcription at multiple sites, the regulation of multiple start site utilization is not understood. Beginning with the prediction that multiple start site promoters may share regulatory features and using the P-glycoprotein promoter (which can utilize either a single or multiple transcription start site(s)) as a model, several promoters with analogous transcription windows were grouped and searched for the presence of a common DNA element. A downstream protein-binding sequence, MED-1 (Multiple start site Element Downstream), was found in the majority of promoters analyzed. Mutation of this element within the P-glycoprotein promoter reduced transcription by selectively decreasing utilization of downstream start sites. We propose that a new class of RNA polymerase II promoters, those that can utilize a distinctive window of multiple start sites, is defined by the presence of a downstream MED-1 element.
