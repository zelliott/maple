Different hypervariable (V) regions of the archaeal 16S rRNA gene (rrs) were compared systematically to establish a preferred V region(s) for use in Archaea-specific PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The PCR products of the V3 region produced the most informative DGGE profiles and permitted identification of common methanogens from rumen samples from sheep. This study also showed that different methanogens might be detected when different V regions are targeted by PCR-DGGE. Dietary fat appeared to transiently stimulate Methanosphaera stadtmanae but inhibit Methanobrevibacter sp. strain AbM4 in rumen samples.
