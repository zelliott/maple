Genetic evidence suggests that the sigma (sigma) subunit of RNA polymerase determines the specificity of promoter utilization, by making sequence-specific contacts with DNA. We examined the effects of two single amino acid(aa) substitutions in sigma E on the utilization of mutated derivatives of three different promoters in sporulating Bacillus subtilis. We found allele-specific suppression of mutations in all three promoters by each aa substitution in sigma E. These results provide strong evidence that sigma E interacts with each of these promoters in vivo. Moreover, the specificity of suppression of the mutations by the aa substitutions in sigma E lead us to speculate that the Met124 of sigma E closely contacts two adjacent bp in the -10 region of the promoters.
