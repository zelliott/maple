A novel Gram-stain positive, aerobic, non-motile, spore-forming actinobacterium, designated YIM 75926(T), was isolated from a soil sample collected at soil forest in Yuanmo county of Yunnan province, south-west China. Its taxonomic position was investigated by a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the novel strain YIM 75926(T) belongs to the genus Pseudonocardia and was closely related to Pseudonocardia                         halophobica DSM 43089(T) (98.1% similarity). Strain YIM 75926(T) had MK-8 (H(4)) as the predominant menaquinone. The whole organism hydrolysates mainly consisted of meso-diaminopimelic acid, mannose, glucose, galactose and arabinose. The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C(16:0) (37.16%) and C(16:0) (12.43%). The DNA G+C content of strain YIM 75926(T) was 70.6 mol%. The resultant phylogenetic trees further showed that strain YIM 75926(T) belong to Pseudonocardia and had a distinct subclade within the evolutionary radiation of the genus Pseudonocardia. On the basis of its comparative analysis of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, it is proposed that strain YIM 75926(T) represent a novel species of the genus Pseudonocardia, named Pseudonocardia                         yuanmoensis sp. nov. The type strain is YIM 75926(T) (=CCTCC AA 2011017(T) = JCM 18055(T)).
