A Gram-stain-positive, aerobic, spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium, PN2(T), was isolated from a soil sample collected near the Pindari glacier. It contained anteiso-C15 : 0, iso-C15 : 0 and C16 : 1ω7c alcohol as the predominant fatty acids, MK-7 as the major menaquinone and A4α type (l-Lys-d-Glu) peptidoglycan. Based on these characteristics, strain PN2(T) was assigned to the genus Paenisporosarcina. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence placed strain PN2(T) within the genus Paenisporosarcina and showed a sequence similarity of 98.5-99.0 % with members of this genus. Paenisporosarcina macmurdoensis CMS 21w(T), Paenisporosarcina quisquiliarum SK 55(T) and Sporosarcina antarctica N-05(T) were identified as the most closely related species with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 98.6 %, 99.0 % and 98.4 %, respectively. The values for DNA-DNA relatedness between strain PN2(T) and P. macmurdoensis, P. quisquiliarum and S. antarctica were below the 70 % threshold value (32.0 %, 42.0 % and 38.0 % respectively). In addition, strain PN2(T) exhibited a number of phenotypic differences from P. macmurdoensis, P. quisquiliarum and S. antarctica. Based on the cumulative differences, strain PN2(T) was identified as representing a novel species and the name Paenisporosarcina indica sp. nov. was proposed. The type strain of Paenisporosarcina indica sp. nov. is PN2(T) (LMG 23933(T) = JCM 15114(T)). Furthermore, based on the morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, the species Sporosarcina antarctica was reclassified as a species of the genus Paenisporosarcina and renamed Paenisporosarcina antarctica comb. nov. In addition, an emended description of the genus Paenisporosarcina is presented.
