A 5S-ribosomal gene spacer region was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using a DNA preparation from the crude drug "Angelica Root" as a template. The nucleotide sequence of the amplified product was identical to that of Angelica acutiloba, the source plant of "Angelica Root", but different from that of Bupleurum falcatum or Glehnia littoralis. The possibility of discriminating "Angelica Root" from other umbelliferous crude drugs based on a Hin dIII restriction site inside the spacer region was suggested.
