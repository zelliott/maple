Endonuclease V of bacteriophage T4 possesses two enzymatic activities, a DNA N-glycosylase specific for cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CBPD) and an associated apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase. Extensive structural and functional studies of endonuclease V have revealed that specific amino acids are associated with these two activities. Controversy still exists regarding the role of the aromatic amino acid stretch close to the carboxyl terminus, in particular the tryptophan at position 128. We have expressed wild-type and mutant W128S endonuclease V in Escherichia coli from an inducible tac promoter. Purified W128S endonuclease V demonstrated substantially decreased N-glycosylase (approximately 5-fold) and AP lyase (10- to 20-fold) activities in vitro compared to the wild-type enzyme when a UV-irradiated poly(dA)-poly(dT) substrate was used. However, a much smaller difference in AP lyase activity between the two forms was observed with a site-specific abasic oligonucleotide. The difference in enzymatic activity was qualitatively, but not quantitatively, reflected in the survival of UV-irradiated bacteria, that is the W128S cells were slightly less UV resistant than wild-type cells. No difference was observed in the complementation of UV repair using UV-damaged denV- T4 phage. A more pronounced difference between the wild-type and W128S proteins was observed in human xeroderma pigmentosum group A cells by host-cell reactivation of a UV-irradiated reporter gene. The relatively large discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo results observed with bacteria may be because saturated levels of DNA repair are obtained in vivo with relatively low levels of endonuclease V. However, under limiting in vitro conditions and in human cells in vivo a considerable difference between the W128S mutant and wild-type endonuclease V activities can be detected. Our results demonstrate that tryptophan-128 is important for endonuclease V activity.
