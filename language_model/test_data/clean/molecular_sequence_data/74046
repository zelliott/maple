The ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region from individual Gyrodactylus specimens was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The reaction amplified the entire ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of the ribosomal RNA gene cluster using primers that hybridize to the 3' terminus of the small subunit and the 5' terminus of the large subunit ribosomal RNA genes. The PCR products from Gyrodactylus salaris and Gyrodactylus thymalli were cloned and sequenced. The Gyrodactylus 5.8S gene was identified following comparative alignment of the G. salaris sequence and a Schistosoma 5.8S gene sequence. The ITS regions from G. salaris, G. thymalli, Gyrodactylus derjavini, and Gyrodactylus truttae were compared by restriction enzyme analysis and interspecific restriction fragment length polymorphisms were found. Gyrodactylus salaris and G. thymalli restriction fragment sizes were confirmed from sequence data. ITS amplification followed by Sau3AI digestion enables rapid and clear differentiation of G. salaris, G. derjavini, and G. truttae.
