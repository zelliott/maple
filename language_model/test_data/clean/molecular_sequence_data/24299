Specific neutralizing epitope changes have been observed in a chimpanzee infected naturally with SIVcpz, which differ from HIV-1 infecting humans. To characterize further these changes, a longitudinal study of env genomic sequence variation of SIVcpz-ant isolates was undertaken in this animal. The V1 and V2 regions of the env were determined to arise from specific recombination events. To determine whether recombination of the V1 and V2 domains was possibly associated with the emergence of neutralization escape viruses, envelope sequences and gene length polymorphisms from PBMC and plasma viral variants were studied over a 7-year period. PBMCs and plasma-associated infectious virus titers as well as plasma RNA viral loads were monitored longitudinally. The first 5 viruses isolated from the plasma were found to be neutralization escape variants. Sequence analysis of their V1 and the V2 regions indicated that a 20 amino acid stretch of the V1 region had undergone recombination and was also associated with the emergence of isolates eliciting strong neutralization responses. These findings support the hypothesis that recombination of the V1 and V2 regions of the envelope play a role in neutralization escape of SIVcpz in chimpanzees infected naturally. Furthermore, the data confirm that the neutralizing antibody response plays an important role in the decline of plasma infectious virus titers in HIV-1 related SIVcpz nonpathogenic infection.
