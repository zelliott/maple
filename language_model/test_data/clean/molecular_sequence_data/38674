The protein sequences derived from cDNA sequences for Hsp70 binding proteins from human (HspBP2) and rat tissues (HspBPR) are presented in this paper. The derived amino acid sequences of these proteins differ from human HspBP1 in the number of consecutive glycines near the amino-terminus. These differences, however, do not alter the inhibitory activity.
