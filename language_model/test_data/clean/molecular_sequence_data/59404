The genes encoding new trehalose-producing enzymes from S. acidocaldarius ATCC33909 were cloned to analyze the distribution of these genes in Sulfolobales. Comparison of the amino acid sequences with S. solfataricus KM1 showed approximately 50% similarity. Southern analysis suggest that homologues of the trehalose-producing enzyme genes exist widely in sulfolobales and strains in Sulfolobales were classified into three kinds of genotypes.
