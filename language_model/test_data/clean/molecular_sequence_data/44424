The intermediate filament cytoskeleton of corneal epithelial cells is composed of cornea-specific keratins K3 and K12 (refs 1,2). Meesmann's corneal dystrophy (MCD) is an autosomal dominant disorder causing fragility of the anterior corneal epithelium, where K3 and K12 are specifically expressed. We postulated that dominant-negative mutations in these keratins might be the cause of MCD. K3 was mapped to the type-II keratin gene cluster on 12q; and K12 to the type-I keratin cluster on 17q using radiation hybrids. We obtained linkage to the K12 locus in Meesmann's original German kindred (Zmax = 7.53; theta = 0) and we also showed that the phenotype segregated with either the K12 or the K3 locus in two Northern Irish pedigrees. Heterozygous missense mutations in K3 (E509K) and in K12 (V143L; R135T) completely co-segregated with MCD in the families and were not found in 100 normal unrelated chromosomes. All mutations occur in the highly conserved keratin helix boundary motifs, where dominant mutations in other keratins have been found to severely compromise cytoskeletal function, leading to keratinocyte fragility phenotypes. Our results demonstrate for the first time the molecular basis of Meesmann's corneal dystrophy.
