To clone the variable genes of HAb25 McAb against hepatocellular carcinoma.

The HAb25 variable region genes were isolated by RT-PCR technique from the HAb25 hybridoma, and its nucleic acid sequences were analyzed by the sanger's dideoxy-mediated chain-termination method.

The gene of VH was 360 bp long encoding 120 amino acids and the gene of VL was 330 bp long encoding 110 amino acids. Only one open reading frame could be found in each of the variable genes. A comparison of the sequences of VH and VL domatins derived from the HAb25 antibody with those of the published mouse Ig genes in GenBank by computer revealed that the VH gene was homologous to the VH186.2 germline gene family (84.00%) and VL gene was homologous to the MMIgGKAVAG(82.00%).

Both of the two genes are rearranged variable region genes, which are VHDJH3 for the VH and VK J K4 for the VL.
