A novel insertion sequence (IS), ISPst9, from Pseudomonas stutzeri AN10 was cloned and characterized. ISPst9 is a typical bacterial IS, consisting of a 2472-bp element flanked by 24-bp perfect inverted repeats that generates 8-bp AT-rich target duplications upon insertion. The sequence also contains a gene that encodes an active transposase (TnpA) with significant amino acid identity to members of the ISL3 family. Southern blot analysis of digested genomic DNA of strain AN10 and its 4-chlorosalicylate-degrading derivative strain AN142 demonstrated that native ISPst9 transposes in multiple copies, with one of them responsible for the nahH insertional inactivation observed in strain AN142. Precise excision of ISPst9 yielded NahH+ revertants of AN142 at high frequencies (up to 10-6). In vivo transposition, mainly in multiple copies, of an ISPst9 derivative containing a KmR cassette cloned into a suicide vector was also demonstrated. Hybridization experiments carried out with different strains of P. stutzeri and with 292 phylogenetically distinct environmental isolates suggested that the presence of an ISPst9-like IS occurs in diverse bacteria together with the presence of aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading determinants.
