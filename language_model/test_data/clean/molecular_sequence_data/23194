Extracellular enzymes, including serine protease, chitinase and collagenase, corresponding to the main chemical constituents of the nematode cuticle and eggshell, have been reported to be involved in the infectious process as virulence factors. This review will focus on the categories, characterization, purification, cloning and potential function of these virulence enzymes and will attempt to provide new insights into the mechanisms of fungal pathogenesis in nematodes.
