The beta-hairpin fold mechanism of a nine-residue peptide, which is modified from the beta-hairpin of alpha-amylase inhibitor tendamistat (residues 15-23), is studied through direct folding simulations in explicit water at native folding conditions. Three 300-nanosecond self-guided molecular dynamics (SGMD) simulations have revealed a series of beta-hairpin folding events. During these simulations, the peptide folds repeatedly into a major cluster of beta-hairpin structures, which agree well with nuclear magnetic resonance experimental observations. This major cluster is found to have the minimum conformational free energy among all sampled conformations. This peptide also folds into many other beta-hairpin structures, which represent some local free energy minimum states. In the unfolded state, the N-terminal residues of the peptide, Tyr-1, Gln-2, and Asn-3, have a confined conformational distribution. This confinement makes beta-hairpin the only energetically favored structure to fold. The unfolded state of this peptide is populated with conformations with non-native intrapeptide interactions. This peptide goes through fully hydrated conformations to eliminate non-native interactions before folding into a beta-hairpin. The folding of a beta-hairpin starts with side-chain interactions, which bring two strands together to form interstrand hydrogen bonds. The unfolding of the beta-hairpin is not simply the reverse of the folding process. Comparing unfolding simulations using MD and SGMD methods demonstrate that SGMD simulations can qualitatively reproduce the kinetics of the peptide system.
