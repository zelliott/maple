In the search for novel neuropeptides in porcine follicular fluid (pff) using smooth muscle contractile activity as a response parameter, a substance with a marked activity was isolated in a pure form. By amino acid analysis and sequential study, this substance has been chemically revealed to be angiotensin I. A much smaller amount of additional activity was isolated and found to be angiotensin II, as determined by radioimmunoassay. Radioimmunoassays for angiotensin I and II confirmed that the amount of angiotensin I determined was much greater than that of angiotensin II. A comparative study of the extractions, however, indicated a large amount of angiotensin I had been generated from angiotensinogen by endogenous renin in the follicular fluid which could be activated during extraction and ultrafiltration at a low pH. These findings are consistent with the previous reports that described a high concentration of prorenin in the follicular fluid, acid activation of prorenin to renin and the subsequent generation of angiotensin I from endogenous angiotensinogen.
