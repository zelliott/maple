The tissue tropism and possible correlation with liver disease of the TT virus (TTV) as well as its prevalence and genotype distribution remain undefined. TTV-DNA was investigated in paired sera and tissue samples from 144 patients, and sera and cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) from additional six subjects. Of the 144 tissue samples, 128 were liver biopsy specimens from subjects with hepatic disease while 16 were surgically obtained nonliver specimens from patients with extrahepatic disease. TTV cloning, sequencing and genotype analyses were performed on isolates from sera, tissue specimens and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of two patients with hepatic and four patients with extrahepatic pathologies, as well as from sera and CSFs of two subjects. TTV was found in 100% of the examined tissues and in 60.1 and 50% of sera from patients with hepatic and extrahepatic pathologies, respectively. Moreover, TTV was detected in four of the six CSFs analysed but only in two correspondent sera. Genotyping revealed the coexistence of multiple TTV genotypes and genetic variants in each infected individual, and the analysis of TTV mRNA showed the presence of transcripts in all the six different tissues studied. These results indicate that the entire adult population in our area is more likely infected by TTV, although several subjects are not viraemic and that TTV infects many different human tissues and is able to invade the central nervous system.
