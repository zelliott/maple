A new approach is proposed to obtain the directed mutations in the gene under study. The technique is based on using alkylphosphotriester analogues of oligodeoxyribonucleotides as site-specific mutagens. The deletion C in lacZ' gene of bacteriophage M13mpB was obtained by cotransfection of Escherichia coli cells with a mix of DNA and phosphotriester analogues of oligonucleotides.
