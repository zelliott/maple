Epitopes of hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) were mapped by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using follow-up sera of patients, all of whom were infected with the same isolate of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Our results suggest that (i) an early appearance (up to month 13 postinfection) of antibodies directed to the N terminus of HVR1 is associated with acute self-limiting infections of HCV and (ii) isolate-independent antibodies which are mainly directed to the C terminus of HVR1 seem to persist in chronically infected patients. The relevance of HVR1-specific antibodies for neutralization was evaluated by characterization of a rabbit serum.
