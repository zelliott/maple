Pistil final morphology relies on floral meristem homeostasis, proper organ specification and regional differentiation. These are developmental processes in which sophisticated signaling networks are being uncovered. However, further elements for fine-tuning adjustment still remain to be disclosed. At the molecular level, posttranscriptional modulators may fit such a profile. In this work, we describe the characterization of PEPPER (PEP), a novel Arabidopsis gene encoding a polypeptide with K-homology (KH) RNA-binding modules, which acts on vegetative growth and pistil development. PEP was initially identified as one of the gene functions affected in a complex mutant carrying a chromosomal reorganization, which exhibits aberrant phyllotaxy and small fruits with supernumerary carpels. In contrast, plants carrying single-gene pep null mutations exhibit subtle morphological alterations. Individuals bearing a stronger-than-null allele present a phenotype comprising leaf alterations, phyllotactic errors and sporadic presence of fruits with multiple valves. Accordingly, dynamic PEP expression was detected in all major organs examined. Complementation experiments with a PEP genomic clone confirmed a role for PEP as a regulator in vegetative and reproductive development. Moreover, our genetic studies suggest that PEP interacts with element(s) of the CLAVATA signaling pathway.
