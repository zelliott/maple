We report the phylogenetic and physiological characterization of a mesophilic and halophilic member of the filamentous anoxygenic phototrophic (FAP) bacteria, provisionally named ' Candidatus Chorothrix halophila' gen. nov. sp. nov., that has been maintained in a highly enriched culture in our laboratory for over a decade. Phylogenetic analysis of small-subunit RNA-encoding sequences places ' Candidatus Chlorothrix halophila' in a clade that includes cultivated members of the genera Chloroflexus and Oscillochloris. Physiological studies demonstrated sulfide-dependent photosynthetic uptake of (14)C-labeled bicarbonate. Enzymatic assays for the activity of propionyl-coenzyme A synthase indicated that ' Candidatus Chlorothrix halophila' does not use the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle of Chloroflexus aurantiacus OK-70-fl for autotrophic carbon assimilation. New concepts regarding the taxonomy and phylogeny of FAP bacteria have emerged from this work.
