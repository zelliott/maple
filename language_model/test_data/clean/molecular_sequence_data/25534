Alterations of the C-terminal amino acid sequence of human tumour necrosis factor-alpha (hTNF-alpha) caused significant changes in its biological activity. Thus shortening of the C-terminus by removal of two or three amino acids led to a very marked loss of cytotoxic activity. Other, more subtle changes introduced by site-directed mutagenesis resulted in a less drastic reduction in cytotoxicity. The mitogenic activity towards human fibroblasts of the hTNF-alpha was reduced in parallel with the loss of cytotoxicity. These results suggest that the C-terminal amino acids of hTNF-alpha are critical for its biological actions and that they may be part of the receptor-binding site.
