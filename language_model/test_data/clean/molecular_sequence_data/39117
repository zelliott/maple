The transducin-like enhancers of split are a family of mammalian proteins that share sequence homology with the Drosophila protein Groucho. Using representational difference analysis, we isolated the cDNA for a previously unidentified gene, rTLE3 (rat transducin-like enhancer of split 3), as a sequence induced by depolarization and forskolin, but not by neurotrophins or growth factors, in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. rTLE3 encodes the protein rTLE3, a 764-amino acid orthologue of mouse and human TLE3. R-esp2, the gene encoding the closest related rat protein, is not induced by any of the four treatments in PC12 cells. rTLE3 and R-esp2 have different patterns of expression in the adult rat CNS and other tissues. After systemic administration of kainic acid, rTLE3 is induced specifically in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. We propose that members of the transducin-like enhancer of split family of proteins may have distinct functions in the mature CNS, in addition to their functions during development.
