Processing of mRNAs including, alternative splicing (AS), mRNA transport and translation regulation are crucial to eukaryotic gene expression. For example, >90% of the genes in the human genome are known to undergo alternative splicing thereby expanding the proteome production capacity of a limited number of genes. Similarly, mRNA export and translation regulation plays a vital role in regulating protein production. Thus, it is important to understand how these RNA binding proteins including alternative splicing factors (ASFs) and mRNA transport and translation factors regulate these processes. Here we report the expression of an ASF, serine-arginine rich splicing factor 10 (Sfrs10) and a mRNA translation regulation factor, CUGBP, elav like family member 4 (Celf4) in the developing mouse retina. Sfrs10 was expressed throughout postnatal (P) retinal development and was observed progressively in newly differentiating neurons. Immunofluorescence (IF) showed Sfrs10 in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) at P0, followed by amacrine and bipolar cells, and at P8 it was enriched in red/green cone photoreceptor cells. By P22, Sfrs10 was observed in rod photoreceptors in a peri-nuclear pattern. Like Sfrs10, Celf4 expression was also observed in the developing retina, but with two distinct retinal isoforms. In situ hybridization (ISH) showed progressive expression of Celf4 in differentiating neurons, which was confirmed by IF that showed a dynamic shift in Celf4 localization. Early in development Celf4 expression was restricted to the nuclei of newly differentiating RGCs and later (E16 onwards) it was observed in the initial segments of RGC axons. Later, during postnatal development, Celf4 was observed in amacrine and bipolar cells, but here it was predominantly cytoplasmic and enriched in the two synaptic layers. Specifically, at P14, Celf4 was observed in the synaptic boutons of rod bipolar cells marked by Pkc-Î±. Thus, Celf4 might be regulating AS early in development besides its known role of regulating mRNA localization/translation. In all, our data suggests an important role for AS and mRNA localization/translation in retinal neuron differentiation.
