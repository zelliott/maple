Thirty Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains isolated from outbreaks in China during 1996 to 2005 were characterized pathotypically and genotypically. All strains except one were velogenic. An analysis of the variable region (nucleotides 47 to 420) of the F gene indicated that 6 isolates belonged to genotype II, 3 to genotype III, 1 (isolated from a pigeon) to genotype VI, and 20 to genotype VII. Isolates belonging to genotype VII were further divided into five subtypes, VIIa, VIIb, VIIc, VIId, and VIIe, and subtype VIId was made up of VIId1 to VIId5. These results showed that genotype VII isolates might have been the most prevalent in China during the past two decades. Genotype VII isolates shared high homology, but the homology was less than that between genotype VII viruses and the vaccine virus LaSota. Among these NDV isolates, 25 isolates had the velogenic motif (112)R/K-R-Q-K/R-R-F(117) that is consistent with results of the biological tests. However, four of five LaSota-type isolates that contained the lentogenic motif (112)G-R-Q-G-R-L(117) were velogenic, except SY/03, in the view of the biological test. The majority of genotype VII isolates had lost one or two N-glycosylation sites. Finally, a cross-protection experiment in which specific-pathogen-free chickens vaccinated with LaSota were challenged by six NDV isolates showed that more than three isolates were antigenic variants that could be responsible for recent outbreaks of Newcastle disease.
