Vascular permeability factor, or vascular endothelial growth factor (VPF/VEGF) is a disulfide-linked dimeric glycoprotein of about 40 kD that promotes fluid and protein leakage from blood vessels. Various human tumor cell lines and cells including fetal vascular smooth muscle cells produce VPF/VEGF. Since glomerular mesangial cells (MC) are closely related to vascular smooth muscle cells, we examined whether cultured human MC produce VPF/VEGF. Northern blotting analysis revealed that cultured human MC expressed a 3.7 kilobases (kb) VPF/VEGF mRNA. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) also expressed VPF/VEGF transcripts of 8.6 and 3.8 kb. Although the sizes of the transcripts suggested the existence of unique molecular species of VPF/VEGF mRNA in PBMC, RT-PCR analysis revealed that PBMC as well as human MC expressed 121, 165, and 189 amino acid-containing isoforms of VPF/VEGF, implying that there are no unique alternative splicing products of VPF/VEGF mRNA in PBMC. Fetal calf serum and 12-o-tetradecanoyl- phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) transiently enhanced VPF/VEGF mRNA expression in cultured human MC. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 enhanced VPF/VEGF mRNA expression in cultured human MC at least within 24 hours. Dexamethasone (DEX) inhibited the TPA-induced increase in VPF/VEGF mRNA expression, whereas DEX did not change the basal level. The DEX depressed the TPA-induced increase in VPF/VEGF mRNA expression is therefore probably a result of transcriptional control. VPF/VEGF protein was detected in cultured human MC with immunoperoxidase staining using anti-VPF/VEGF antibody. TPA increased VPF/VEGF protein levels as well as those of VPF/VEGF mRNA in cultured human MC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
