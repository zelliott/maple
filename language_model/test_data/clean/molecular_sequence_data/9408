We describe in this paper the development of a novel regioselective furanosylation methodology using partially protected furanosyl thioglycosides as central glycosylating building blocks and its application in the efficient one-pot synthesis of a series of linear and branched-type arabino- and galactofuranoside fragments structurally related to the cell wall polysaccharides of  Mycobacterium tuberculosis ,  Streptococcus pneumoniae  serostype 35A, and sugar beet.
