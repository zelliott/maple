Complete 1D gene sequences of 13 Indian foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) type C field isolates and a vaccine strain (C-Bombay/64) were determined. All the field isolates showed a greater genetic homogeneity (95-100%) among themselves and were 19.7-21.2% divergent from the vaccine strain. In the phylogenetic analysis, the Indian field isolates formed a separate lineage (lineage VII) different from the previously identified six lineages (lineage I-VI) in type C FMDV [J. Virol. 66 (1992) 3557]. The vaccine strain was grouped with European lineage (lineage II). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of antigenic sites A and C of field isolates showed no significant variation from the vaccine strain. One-way serological relationship determined in ELISA showed antigenic closeness of the field isolates with C-Bombay/64.
