Site creation: Enantioselective artificial metalloenzymes have been created by grafting a new active site onto bovine pancreatic polypeptide through the introduction of an amino acid capable of coordinating a copper(II) ion. This hybrid catalyst gave good enantioselectivities in the Diels-Alder and Michael addition reactions in water (see scheme) and displayed a very high substrate selectivity.
