The E2-peplomer protein gene of the virulent Miller strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was sequenced from cDNA clones and compared to the E2 gene sequence of the avirulent Purdue strain. Sequence comparisons indicate that most amino acid differences occur in the N-terminal half of the E2-peplomer which represents the most exposed region of the protein. In addition, analysis of an incompletely sequenced open reading frame (ORF) to the immediate 5' side of the E2 gene indicates extensive sequence homology with the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) F2 gene which is thought to encode a RNA polymerase.
