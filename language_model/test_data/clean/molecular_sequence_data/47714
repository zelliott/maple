We have shown previously that p50 is the most abundant protein associated with a variety of eukaryotic mRNAs and exhibits about 98% amino acid sequence identity to mammalian Y-box binding transcription factors. The dual function of p50 in the cell as a regulator of both transcription and translation has been suggested. To gain insight into the role of p50 in these processes, we performed the yeast two-hybrid screen to identify p50 molecular partners. Here we report the identification of actin as a p50-interacting protein. Coimmunoprecipitation of p50 and actin from HeLa extracts as well as in vitro binding studies indicate specificity and a high affinity for the interaction between p50 and actin. Interestingly, p50 binding to actin is affected by mRNA; binding was observed at a low p50/mRNA ratio and was greatly reduced at higher ratios. Since the p50/mRNA ratio appears to be important for mRNA translatability, we speculate that p50 can regulate the attachment of mRNA to the actin network depending on its translational activity. Using immunofluorescence, we show that p50 binds to actin filaments in permeabilized cells and causes actin fibers to bundle in vitro. Together, these findings support the view that p50 may play an important role in mRNA transport, anchoring, and localization on actin filaments in the cell.
