Glucose is the most important energy substrate for mammalian blastocysts. Its uptake is mediated by glucose transporters (GLUT). In muscle and adipocyte cells insulin stimulates glucose uptake by activation of the insulin receptor (IR) pathway and translocation of GLUT4. GLUT4 is expressed in bovine preimplantation embryos. A new insulin-responsive isoform, GLUT8, was recently described in mouse blastocysts. Thus, potentially, two insulin-responsive isoforms are expressed in early embryos. The mechanism of insulin action on embryonic cells, however, is still not clear. In the present study expression of IR, GLUT1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 was studied in rabbit preimplantation embryos using RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The rabbit mRNA sequences for the complete coding region of IR, GLUT4 and a partial GLUT8 sequence were determined by RACE-PCR and sequencing. GLUT4 was expressed in 3-day-old morulae and in 4- and 6-day-old blastocysts. IR and GLUT8 transcripts were detectable only in blastocysts. Blastocysts also expressed GLUT1 and 3, but not GLUT2 and 5. Transcript numbers of GLUT4 and 8 were higher in trophoblast than in embryoblast cells. Translation of IR, GLUT4 and 8 proteins in blastocysts was confirmed by Western blotting. GLUT4 was localized mainly in the membrane and in the perinuclear region in trophoblast cells while in embryoblast cells its localization was predominantly in the perinuclear cytoplasm. The possible function(s) of two insulin-responsive isoforms, GLUT4 and GLUT8, in rabbit preimplantation embryos needs further investigation. It may not necessarily be linked to insulin-stimulated glucose transport.
