The 14-3-3 protein, highly conserved in all eukaryotic cells, is an important regulatory protein. It plays an important role in the growth, amplification, apoptosis, signal transduction, and other crucial life activities of cells. A cDNA encoding a putative 14-3-3 protein was isolated from cotton fiber cDNA library. The cDNA, designated as Gh14-3-3L (Gossypium hirsutum 14-3-3-like), is 1,029 bp in length (including a 762 bp long open reading frame and 5'-/3'-untranslated regions) and deduced a protein with 253 amino acids. The Gh14-3-3L shares higher homology with the known plant 14-3-3 proteins, and possesses the basic structure of 14-3-3 proteins: one dimeric domain, one phosphoralated-serine rich motif, four CC domains, and one EF Hand motif. Northern blotting analysis showed that Gh14-3-3L was predominantly expressed during early fiber development, and reached to the peak of expression in 10 days post anthers (DPA) fiber cells, suggesting that the gene may be involved in regulating fiber elongation. The gene is also expressed at higher level in both ovule and petal, but displays lower or undetectable level of activity in other tissues of cotton.
