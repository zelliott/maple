Fungi in the basidiomycete species complex Heterobasidion annosum are significant root-rot pathogens of conifers throughout the northern hemisphere. We utilize a multilocus phylogenetic approach to examine hypotheses regarding the evolution and divergence of two Heterobasidion taxa associated with pines: the Eurasian H. annosum sensu stricto and the North American H. annosum P intersterility group (ISG). Using DNA sequence information from portions of two nuclear and two mitochondrial loci, we infer phylogenetic relationships via parsimony, Bayesian and median-joining network analysis. Analysis of isolates representative of the entire known geographic range of the two taxa results in monophyletic sister Eurasian and North American lineages, with North America further subdivided into eastern and western clades. Genetically anomalous isolates from the Italian presidential estate of Castelporziano are always part of a North American clade and group with eastern North America, upholding the hypothesis of recent, anthropogenically mediated dispersal. P ISG isolates from Mexico have phylogenetic affinity with both eastern and western North America. Results for an insertion in the mitochondrial rDNA suggest this molecule was obtained from the Heterobasidion S ISG, a taxon sympatric with the P ISG in western North America. These data are compatible with an eastern Eurasian origin of the species, followed by dispersal of two sister taxa into western Eurasia and into eastern North America over a Beringean land bridge, a pattern echoed in the phylogeography of other conifer-associated basidiomycetes.
