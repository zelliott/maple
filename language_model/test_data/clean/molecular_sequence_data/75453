The nucleotide sequence of the gene for maltohexaose-producing amylase from an alkalophilic Bacillus sp. #707 was determined. Starting at an ATG initiation codon, an open reading frame was composed of 1554 bp (518 amino acids). The NH2-terminal portion encoded a 33 amino acid-long signal peptide. The deduced amino acid sequence of the extracellular mature enzyme was more than 60% homologous to those of the liquefying type alpha-amylases but not to those of the saccharifying type alpha-amylases. The sequence of its signal peptide was completely different from those of other alpha-amylases.
