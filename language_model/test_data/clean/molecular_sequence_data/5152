My colleagues and I have reported that a small nuclear RNA, U5, can cause transformation of and chromosomal aberrations in rat fibroblast 3Y1 cells. In the study described here, I found that a partial U5 sequence, the 3' half of the first stem structure (designated RNA3S), transformed the cells morphologically at a high frequency when expressed with a poly(A) tail (RNA3S+). The transformation critically depended upon a polypurine sequence in RNA3S+. The expressed RNA3S+ was associated with polysomes. The transformed cells did not exhibit significant frequencies of chromosome aberrations when compared with control cells, suggesting that the transformation occurs without significant induction of chromosome damage. Heterogeneous subcolonies emerged in monolayers when the morphologically transformed cells were subcultured and maintained at postconfluence. Cells from subcolonies acquired the ability to form small colonies in soft agar and tumors in nude mice, suggesting that RNA3S+ can drive the cells into the neoplastic stage. RNA3S+ also conferred morphological alterations and a growth advantage and decreased levels of fibronectin protein synthesis in human HeLa cells, confirming the transforming potential of the RNA. RNA3S+ transformation may therefore be a useful model system for studying a transformation process.
