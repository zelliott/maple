During meiotic maturation of Spisula oocytes, maternal mRNAs undergo changes in translation and in the length of their poly(A) tails. In general, those mRNAs that are translationally activated, i.e., unmasked, become polyadenylated, while deactivated mRNAs lose their poly(A) tails. The activated class of mRNAs encode ribonucleotide reductase, cyclins A and B and histone H3, while the proteins that stop being made include tubulin and actin. Previously, we demonstrated that mRNA-specific unmasking can be brought about in vitro by preventing the interaction of protein(s) with central portions of the 3' noncoding regions (masking regions) of ribonucleotide reductase and cyclin A mRNAs. In this report, we show that clam egg extracts are capable of sequence-specific polyadenylation of added RNAs since the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of ribonucleotide reductase and histone H3 mRNAs are polyadenylated, while that of actin mRNA is not. In contrast, oocyte extracts, as in vivo, are essentially devoid of polyadenylation activity. We present an initial characterisation of the cis-acting sequences in the 3' UTR of ribonucleotide reductase mRNA required for polyadenylation. The results suggest that the sequences for cytoplasmic polyadenylation are more complex and extensive than those determined in vertebrates and that they may partly overlap with the masking regions.
