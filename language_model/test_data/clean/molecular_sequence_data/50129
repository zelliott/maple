Desquamation is described as a protease-dependent phenomenon where serine proteases with a basic pH optimum play a key role. Recently proteases with an acidic pH optimum were identified in the stratumcorneum and associated with desquamation, e.g., cathepsin D and the stratum corneum thiol protease. The purpose of this study was to investigate if human stratum corneum contains proteases different from the above, exhibiting similar properties. After gel filtration, we identified four distinct proteolytic activities in a human stratum corneum extract, a cathepsin-E-like activity (80 kDa), a cathepsin-D activity (40 kDa), a yet unknown cathepsin-L-like form (28 kDa) exhibiting the highest caseinolytic activity, and a chymotrypsin-like protein (24 kDa) containing the acidic activity of the well described stratum corneum chymotryptic enzyme. We named the new 28 kDa protease stratum corneum cathepsin-L-like enzyme. Characterization of stratum corneum cathepsin-L-like enzyme provided clear evidence that this new protease, despite its membership to the cathepsin-L-like family, is distinct from cathepsin L and from the recently described stratum corneum thiol protease. Its ability to hydrolyze corneodesmosin, a marker of corneocyte cohesion, was in favor of a role of stratum corneum cathepsin-L-like enzyme in the desquamation process. A more detailed analysis did not allow us to identify stratum corneum cathepsin-L-like enzyme at the molecular level but revealed that stratum corneum thiol protease is identical with the recently described cathepsin L2 protease. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction studies and the use of a specific antibody revealed that, in contrast to earlier reports, expression of stratum corneum thiol protease in human epidermis is not related to keratinocyte differentiation. Our results indicate that the stratum corneum thiol protease is probably expressed as a pro-enzyme in the lower layers of the epidermis and in part activated by a yet unidentified mechanism in the upper layers during keratinocyte differentiation.
