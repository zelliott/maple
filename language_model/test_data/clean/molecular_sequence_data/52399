The chromatographic behaviour of oligosaccharide alditols and glycopeptides containing neutral and acetamido sugars and sialic acid has been investigated on a HyperCarb porous graphitised carbon column. The alditols were substantially retained and could be eluted in 0-25% acetonitrile-0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid between 3-30 min for mono- to hexasaccharides. Elution patterns were based on both size, charge and linkage such that isomeric compounds could be separated from each other.
