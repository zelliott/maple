The structural gene for excreted amylase from Aeromonas hydrophila JMP636 has been cloned within a 2.1-kilobase SmaI fragment of DNA. The amylase gene is transcribed from its own promoter in Escherichia coli, producing a gene product of Mr 49,000. The amylase gene product is secreted to the periplasm of E. coli; however, it is not excreted. Nucleotide sequencing revealed an open reading frame of 1,392 base pairs corresponding to a protein of 464 amino acid residues. A potential signal peptide of 21 amino acid residues is present at the NH2 terminal of the predicted protein. Three regions of homology with other procaryotic and eucaryotic alpha-amylases were detected within the predicted amino acid sequence.
