IR vibrational CD (VCD) has been observed for the cyclic pentapeptide cyclo-(-Gly-Pro-Gly-D-Ala-Pro-) in solution in CDBr3. The observed VCD spectra do not resemble the VCD features of any of the previously reported peptide secondary structures, such as alpha-helical, "random coil," or sheet structures, and might be due to the beta-turn contained in this molecule. To shed light onto the origin of the observed spectra, VCD intensity calculations, based on the solution and solid-state structures of cyclo-(-Gly-Pro-Gly-D-Ala-Pro-), have been carried out. In addition, calculated VCD data for pure beta-turns are discussed.
