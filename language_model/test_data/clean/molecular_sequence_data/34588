A hyphomycetous fungus isolated from montane fen soil in the Caucasus Mountains, Russia, had obscurely sympodial conidiogenous cells that suggested a link to the heterogeneous genus Leptodontidium. Sequence analysis of the nuclear ribosomal small subunit and internal transcribed spacer region, however, disclosed that the fungus was an anamorphic member of a clade containing the cleistothecial ascomycetous genus Pseudeurotium. Teberdinia, gen. nov., is proposed for the blastic, generally sympodially proliferating anamorphs in this group, and Teberdinia hygrophila, sp. nov., is proposed for the species from upland fens. Binomials are not proposed for the remaining Teberdinia anamorphs of Pseudeurotium species. Purely anamorphic isolates in this clade are difficult to recognize using current morphological keys and might be more widely distributed and ecologically significant than is currently evident.
