We cloned full-length sox3 cDNA from testis of black porgy, Acanthopagrus schlegeli. Black porgy sox3 cDNA consists of 897 base pairs (bp) and encodes a protein of 298 amino acids. We have investigated the expression pattern of sox3 and DMRT1 mRNA during the sex-reverse process from male to female (immature testis, mature testis, testicular portion of mostly testis, ovarian portion of mostly testis, testicular portion of mostly ovary, ovarian portion of mostly ovary and ovary). The expression of sox3 and DMRT1 mRNA was high in mature testis of black porgy during sex-reverse process. In a histological analysis, testicular portion of gonad was degenerated and the ovary portion was increased during sex reversal from male to female, and then oocytes were increased in ovary. Also we examined the expression of sox3 and DMRT1 mRNA after gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa) treatment in immature black porgy. The expression of sox3 and DMRT1 mRNA was increased after GnRHa treatment (in vivo and in vitro experiment) in immature black porgy. Therefore, we concluded that sox3 and DMRT1 were involved in the development of testis than ovary in black porgy.
