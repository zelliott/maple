Part of an apparent open reading frame in the tox-argK gene cluster of Pseudomonas syringae pathovar phaseolicola (Psp) potentially encodes a polypeptide with sequence similarity to fatty acid desaturases (DES). Escherichia coli B expressing this segment under T7 promoter control produced a 34-kDa polypeptide. The possible involvement of a DES in facilitating phaseolotoxin (Ptx) secretion at the low temperatures normally required for its synthesis and the evolutionary implications about the origin of the tox-argK gene cluster are discussed.
