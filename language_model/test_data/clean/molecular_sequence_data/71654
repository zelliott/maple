Heterotrimeric G proteins, composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, transduce signals from transmembrane receptors to a wide range of intracellular effectors. The G protein gamma subunits, which play an indispensible role in this communication, constitute a large and diverse multigene family. Using an interspecific backcross panel, we have determined the mouse chromosomal locations of five gamma subunit genes: gamma2, gamma8, gamma10, gamma12, and gammaCone. Combined with previous mapping studies, these data indicate that, with the possible exception of gamma1 and gamma11, the G protein gamma subunit genes are well dispersed within the mouse and human genomes.
