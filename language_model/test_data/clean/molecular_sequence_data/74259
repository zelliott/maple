Genome analysis of Treponema zioleckii proved that, in this bacterium, besides chromosomal DNA, a relatively small extrachromosomal DNA element is present. This element was shown to be a double-stranded circular plasmid DNA of approximately 7 kbp; it was designated as pKT. The plasmid was characterized by molecular and bioinformatic analysis. No pKT homologous DNA sequences were detected in other rumen Treponema strains. The overall G+C content of the pKT plasmid is approximately 56 %, which is higher than in other Treponema plasmids or genomes. The Rep module of the pKT plasmid consisting of the rep gene and the region of repeats was identified within a 1.6-kbp fragment. The putative rep gene encodes the replication protein belonging to the pfam04796 RepA_C family of proteins with the highest similarity (25 % within 249 amino acids) to the RepA protein from the green sulfur bacterium Prosthecochloris aestuarii.
