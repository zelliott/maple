The mass destruction of domestic birds has been registered in July, 2005 in Novosibirsk region. Influenza virus H5N1 have been isolated from bodies of the lost birds on developing chicken embryos and identified by serological and molecular biological methods. M-gene and genes coding hemagglutinin and neurominidase were in part sequening. The phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin gene has shown, that the isolated viruses are forming a claster with strains, isolated from birds during outbreak of the bird's flu on lake Tsinghai (Qinghai) in China in 2005, in Japan in 2004, and also with H5N1 strains, isolated from the person and birds in the countries of Southeast Asia during ipizootia in 2003-2004. The site of the restriction which associated with pathogenicity of isolated avian influenza viruses H5 serogroup, corresponds to sequence of high pathogenic strains, circulating in the countries of Southeast Asia. The test for pathogenicity with use of chickens has confirmed, that researched strains were high pathogenic for birds.
