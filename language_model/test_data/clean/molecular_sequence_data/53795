In the present study, we report the genomic reconstruction of the glutamate receptor GluR5 gene (GRIK1, alias GLUR5; 402 kb) by the use of the data available in public databases. This analysis allowed characterization of the exon-intron boundaries, identification of the gene promoter region, presentation of the putative complete sequences of two GluR5 mRNA isoforms, and definition of the structure of GluR5 pre-mRNA surrounding the Q/R editing site.
