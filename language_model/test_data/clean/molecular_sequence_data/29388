Expression of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene in skeletal muscle is positively regulated in proliferating myoblasts and declines during differentiation. We have characterized the cis-regulatory elements in the proximal region of the FGFR1 promoter which render positive transcriptional activity. Multiple elements between -69 and -14 activate the FGFR1 promoter. Myoblast transfections revealed that potential Sp transcription factor binding sites are required for promoter activity. Electromobility shift assays indicated that myoblast nuclear proteins specifically bind to these cis-elements and that differentiated myotube nuclear extracts do not form these same complexes. In addition, Southwestern blot analysis detected binding of the most proximal Sp motif to a Sp1-like protein present in myoblast nuclear extracts but not in myotubes. In corroboration, Sp1 and Sp3 proteins were detected only in myoblasts and not in differentiated myotubes. Finally, transfection of Drosophila SL2 cells showed that Sp1 is a positive regulator of FGFR1 promoter activity and that Sp3 is a coactivator via the proximal Sp binding sites. These studies demonstrate that the FGFR1 promoter is activated by Sp transcription factors in proliferating myoblasts and demonstrate at least part of the mechanism by which FGFR1 gene expression is down-regulated in differentiated muscle fibers.
