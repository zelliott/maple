The accurate taxonomic position of Donghaeana dokdonensis DSW-6(T) was investigated. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the strain studied and of Persicivirga xylanidelens SW256(T) shared 98.2 % similarity. On the basis of phylogenetic evidence, phenotypic data and DNA-DNA reassociation values, it is proposed that strain DSW-6(T) be reclassified as Persicivirga dokdonensis comb. nov. Emended descriptions of the genus Persicivirga and of P. xylanidelens are also proposed.
