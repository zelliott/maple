To establish a prenatal diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis the PCR test was done on amniotic fluids from 47 women suspected of primary Toxoplasma infection during pregnancy. Fragments of Toxoplasma B1 gene were found in 5 examined samples. Positive tests were confirmed by mouse inoculation or by serologic testing of newborns. It was concluded that the PCR performed on amniotic fluid should be recommended for the prenatal diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis, however, negative results of the test can not rule out congenital infection.
