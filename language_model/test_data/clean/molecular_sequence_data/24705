Receptor editing is a means by which immature bone marrow B cells can become self-tolerant. Rearrangements of heavy (H) and/or light (L) chain genes are induced by encounter with autoantigens to change the specificity from self to nonself. We have developed site-directed transgenic mice (sd-tg) whose transgenes code for the H chain of antibodies that bind DNA. B cells that express the transgenic H chain associate mainly with four of the 93 functional Vkappa genes of the mouse. Numerous aspartate residues that might inhibit DNA binding by the V(H) domain distinguish these L chain Vkappa sequences, but engaging these Vkappa editors often requires multiple rearrangements. Among the edited B cells is a subset of multispecific cells that express multiple receptors. One consequence of multispecificity is partial autoreactivity; these multispecific B cells may contribute to autoimmunity.
