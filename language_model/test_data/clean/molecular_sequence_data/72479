Cysteine proteases have traditionally been viewed as lysosomal mediators of terminal protein degradation. However, recent findings refute this limited view and suggest a more expanded role for cysteine proteases in human biology. Several newly discovered members of this enzyme class are regulated proteases with limited tissue expression, which implies specific roles in cellular physiology. These roles appear to include apoptosis, MHC class II immune responses, prohormone processing, and extracellular matrix remodeling important to bone development. The ability of macrophages and other cells to mobilize elastolytic cysteine proteases to their surfaces under specialized conditions may also lead to accelerated collagen and elastin degradation at sites of inflammation in diseases such as atherosclerosis and emphysema. The development of inhibitors of specific cysteine proteases promises to provide new drugs for modifying immunity, osteoporosis, and chronic inflammation.
