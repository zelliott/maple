The use of peptides as probes of peptide binding sites of neuropeptide receptors, and of peptidases and proteases is discussed. The rapidly expanding use of peptide antigens as probes of protein structure and valuable diagnostics and vaccines is described. We also discuss the use of synthetic peptide motifs in studies on the molecular details of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions. Covalently modified peptides such as phosphopeptides exemplifies the use of synthetic peptides in the study of posttranslational modifications of proteins.
