SEC66 encodes the 31.5-kDa glycoprotein of the Sec63p complex, an integral endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex required for translocation of presecretory proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DNA sequence analysis of SEC66 predicts a 23-kDa protein with no obvious NH2-terminal signal sequence but with one domain of sufficient length and hydrophobicity to span a lipid bilayer. Antibodies directed against a recombinant form of Sec66p were used to confirm the membrane location of Sec66p and that Sec66p is a glycoprotein of 31.5 kDa. A null mutation in SEC66 renders yeast cells temperature sensitive for growth. sec66 cells accumulate some secretory precursors at a permissive temperature and a variety of precursors at the restrictive temperature. sec66 cells show defects in Sec63p complex formation. Because sec66 cells affect the translocation of some, but not all secretory precursor polypeptides, the role of Sec66p may be to interact with the signal peptide of presecretory proteins.
