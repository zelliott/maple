Genomic DNA containing the protein coding region for Drosophila cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit has been cloned and sequenced. The probe used to detect and isolate the gene fragment was constructed from two partially complementary synthetic oligonucleotides and contains 60 base pairs that encode (using Drosophila codon preferences) amino acids 195-214 of the beef heart catalytic subunit. In reduced stringency hybridization conditions, the probe recognizes two target sites in fly genomic DNA with 85% homology. One of these sites is in the cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit gene, which was isolated as a 3959-base pair HindIII fragment. This fragment contains all of the protein coding portion, 900 base pairs upstream of the initiator ATG, and 2000 base pairs downstream of the termination codon (TAG). The coding portion of the gene contains no introns and yields a protein of 352 amino acids. There is a 2-amino acid insertion near the N terminus of the fly protein relative to the beef and mouse enzymes. Of the remaining 350 amino acids, 273 are invariant in the three species. A probe derived from the coding sequence of the HindIII clone hybridizes strongly to a 5100-base poly(A)+ RNA and weakly to 4100- and 3400-base poly(A)+ RNAs expressed in adult flies. A 2100-base pair EcoRI genomic fragment containing the second site recognized by the 60-base pair probe has also been cloned. DNA sequence analysis demonstrates that this fragment is part of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase gene or a close homolog. The catalytic subunit gene and the cGMP-dependent protein kinase gene have been located in regions 30C and 21D, respectively, of chromosome 2.
