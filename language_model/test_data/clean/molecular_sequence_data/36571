We cloned the hamster cdc25C cDNA by using the human cdc25C cDNA as a probe and prepared an antibody to Escherichia coli-produced hamster cdc25C protein that is specific to the human cdc25C protein. The microinjected antibody inhibited a chromosome condensation induced by tsBN2 mutation, indicating that the cdc25C protein is required for an activation of p34cdc2 kinase caused by loss of RCC1 function. The hamster cdc25C protein located in the cytoplasm, prominently in a periphery of the nuclei of cells arrested with hydroxyurea, and seemed to move into the nuclei by loss of RCC1 function. Also, we found a molecular shift of the cdc25C protein in cells showing premature chromosome condensation (PCC), in addition to normal mitotic cells. This molecular-shift appeared depending on an activation of p34cdc2 kinase.
