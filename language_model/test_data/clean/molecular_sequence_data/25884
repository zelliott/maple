We have searched for induced transcripts in a cDNA library derived from bean cell supension cultures treated with an elicitor from Colletotrichum lindemuthianum. Six independently isolated cDNAs corresponding to rapidly induced small mRNAs have been classified by their DNA sequence and slightly different induction behaviour into two groups. 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions exhibit little similarity, but the deduced small acidic proteins designated PvPR1 and PvPR2 are 89% identical. No relationship was found with the well-characterized PR1 proteins from tobacco. However, the PvPR proteins are closely related to pI49 in pea (64% identity), pSTH2 in potato (41% identity) and PcPR1-1 in parsley (39% identity), which are also induced in response to elicitor or microbial attack. Moreover, a major pollen allergen in birch (BetvI) has a 44% identity with PvPR1 proteins. These similarities establish a ubiquitous class of conserved defense-related proteins and suggest a common yet still unknown function. Southern blot analysis indicates that PvPR protein gene organization is highly complex with an estimated copy number of more than 12 genes.
