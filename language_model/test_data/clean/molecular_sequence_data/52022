The GM2 activator protein is an essential substrate cofactor for the hydrolysis of GM2 ganglioside by lysosomal beta-hexosaminidase A (EC 3.2.1.52). There have been conflicting reports as to the chromosomal localization of the gene encoding the activator. We demonstrate here that these conflicts were caused by the presence of a previously unidentified processed activator-pseudogene on chromosome 3, and we confirm a previous ELISA-based localization of the functional activator gene to chromosome 5. Our data indicate that the functional activator locus can still be considered a candidate site for defects causing some forms of spinal muscular atrophy.
