Gangliosides are characteristic glycolipid components of plasma cell membranes, especially enriched in the CNS and PNS. In some diseases involving the PNS, in particular motor neuropathies associated with conduction block, IgM autoantibodies against ganglioside GM1 have been implicated as a pathogenic factor. In order to study the GM1 distribution in peripheral nerves we have investigated its in situ localization using a new anti-GM1 monoclonal antibody, GM1:1. Immunization and production of the monoclonal antibody was made by common protocols and binding specificity was investigated by using structurally related glycolipids and modified GM1-molecules. The result showed that an alpha 2-3 bound sialic acid together with a terminal galactose moiety were essential for GM1:1 binding. In situ localization of GM1 in rat dorsal and ventral spinal roots was investigated by conventional immunomicroscopy. GM1 immunoreactivity was the same in both roots and appeared like a finely granular, in places confluent, material confined to Schmidt-Lanterman's incisures, to myelin sheath paranodal end segments and to some extent to the abaxonal Schwann cell cytoplasm; all of these structures are likely to be the target for GM1 antibodies in peripheral neuropathies. Nodal gaps and fibre contours showed a weak non-specific fluorescence. The localization of GM1 to the incisures of Schmidt-Lanterman and the paranodal end segments of the myelin sheaths might indicate a role of gangliosides as adhesion molecules.
