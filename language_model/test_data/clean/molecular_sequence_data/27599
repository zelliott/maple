The 9-kDa thylakoid polypeptide which in vivo carries the iron-sulfur centers A and B of photosystem I was isolated from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and the complete amino acid sequence determined. The polypeptide shows a very high degree of homology with the corresponding polypeptides in other plant species. The polypeptide is not post-translationally processed except for the removal of the N-terminal formyl-methionine and the insertion of the iron-sulfur centers.
