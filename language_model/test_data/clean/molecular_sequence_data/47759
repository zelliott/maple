Iridovirus-like pathogens have been recognized as a cause of serious systemic diseases among feral, cultured and ornamental fish in the recent years. Mortalities of fish due to systemic iridovirus infection reaching 30-100% were observed in Europe, Australia, Japan and Thailand. Up to now, the molecular biology of these important pathogens has been poorly documented. To get better insights on the genomic organization of these piscine iridoviruses, we have constructed a cosmid viral DNA library from the epizootic hematopoietic necrosis virus (EHNV). Two recombinant cosmids (Cos7 and Cos12) have been selected for systematic sequencing. Cos7 and 12 are localized side by side along the genome and cover the 2/3 part of the total EHNV genome which has been estimated to be approximately 101.47 kb in length. Thirty five kilobase pairs (kbps) from Cos7 and 10 kbps from Cos12 have been determined. Sequence analysis revealed open reading frames (ORF) sharing homologies with sequences from the Frog virus 3 such as the p31 and p40 proteins. Among the others identified ORFs, some of them presented homologies with known protein sequences, such as the human eIF2alpha protein, and some did not show any significant homologies with sequences available in the databases. But, none were related to Lymphocystis virus, a member of the Iridoviridae family, for which the full genome nucleotide sequence has been determined.
