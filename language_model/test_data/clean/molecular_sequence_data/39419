The Bcl I polymorphism of the glucocorticoid receptor gene, recently identified as an intronic C to G change 646 nucleotides downstream of exon 2, has been associated with increased sensitivity to glucocorticoids and its potential relevance in metabolic disturbances and in various disorders has been extensively investigated. In the present study, we designed a single-tube allele-specific polymerase chain reaction for genotyping this polymorphism in peripheral blood DNA samples. When the Bcl I polymorphism was detected with this novel method in a cohort of 247 healthy subjects, the observed genotype distribution matched the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (100 subjects homozygous for the wild-type, 124 heterozygous and 23 homozygous for the mutant allele). In 50 randomly selected subjects the Bcl I polymorphism was also determined using a traditional restriction fragment length polymorphism technique and DNA sequencing, and the results showed 100% coincidence with those obtained by our novel method. The method proved to be more rapid and less labour-intensive compared to currently used techniques, and it avoided the use of extensive instrumentals. We assume that this novel method may have a broad utility in clinical and molecular epidemiological studies aimed to elucidate the impact of the Bcl I polymorphism of the glucocorticoid receptor gene either on metabolic disturbances, or various disorders, including cancer treatment and hormone substitution therapies.
