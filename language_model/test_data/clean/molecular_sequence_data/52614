A heteromobility duplex tracking assay was developed to analyze B-cell clonality. The assay was based on the genetic variability of B-cell immunoglobulin (Ig) sequences. Binding of amplified (Ig) sequences to a single-stranded radiolabeled Ig DNA probe resulted in the formation of heteroduplexes. The mobilities of these heteroduplexes helped to distinguish clonal B cells.
