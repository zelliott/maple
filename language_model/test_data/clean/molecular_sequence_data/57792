Eighteen strains of human influenza A (H1N1) viruses isolated between August 1986 and January 1991 were analyzed in this study. Examination of the total viral genome of 12 strains by T1 mapping revealed that considerable genetic heterogeneity exists among these viruses. Partial sequencing of each of the non-HA RNA segments of 4 viruses having divergent T1 oligonucleotide maps indicated that only one was a reassortant virus that had genes from both the influenza A (H1N1) and (H3N2) subtypes. This reassortant obtained its PB2 gene from a virus of the H3N2 subtype and the other 7 RNA segments from an H1N1 parent. Sequencing studies of the HA1 domains of the hemagglutinin (HA) genes of these 18 strains revealed that although these viruses are antigenically similar to the reference strains A/Taiwan/1/86 and A/Singapore/6/86, 7 conserved amino acid substitutions that are shared by recently isolated H1N1 viruses have occurred in the main stream of evolution of the H1N1 subtype. Our data indicate that: (1) Genetic reassortment continues to contribute to genetic variability of H1N1 viruses. (2) Genetic variants of non-reassortant H1N1 viruses are co-circulating in the world. (3) The HA's of recent H1N1 viruses are related to those of the 1986 reference strains. (4) Although there has been little detectable antigenic variability, the HA genes of human epidemic influenza A (H1N1) viruses have continued to evolve at an evolutionary rate similar to that for the H1N1 and H3N2 viruses analyzed previously.
