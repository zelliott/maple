Max protein forms specific DNA-binding dimeric complexes with itself and with proteins of the c-myc gene family. A large volume of data has accumulated on the role of the c-myc proto-oncogene in cell proliferation, differentiation and tumorigenesis. To elucidate the role of max in regulating c-myc functions and the effect of both proteins on cell proliferation and differentiation, we transfected murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells with a full-length wild-type (wt) human max gene and a mutant containing a double point mutation in the basic region (bm), which abolishes specific DNA binding. All clones expressing wt-max grow slowly, and the process of inducer-mediated differentiation is delayed. Furthermore, cells transfected with the mutated max exhibit growth retardation, accumulation in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and spontaneous differentiation. Our findings are consistent with a model in which a large excess of wt-Max in the cells enhances the formation of Max-Max growth-suppressor complexes, while elevated bm-Max deprives the cell of growth-promoting Myc-Max heterodimers in a dominant-negative manner, presumably by inactivating endogenous Myc and Max.
