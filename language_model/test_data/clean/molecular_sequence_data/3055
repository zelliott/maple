We compared the biological properties of Oshima 5-10 (tick-borne encephalitis [TBE] virus isolated in Hokkaido, Japan) and Sofjin-HO (Far-Eastern subtype TBE virus) including plaque formation, virus replication and virus protein synthesis in BHK-21 cell cultures to reveal strain differences. We also determined the complete nucleotide sequences of both strains and compared the deduced amino acid sequences. Plaques of Oshima 5-10 were smaller than those of Sofjin-HO. Virus titers in culture fluid of Oshima 5-10 were 1/100 of those of Sofjin-HO at 9 and 12 hr after infection. Less viral protein and RNA syntheses of strain Oshima 5-10 was observed than with Sofjin-HO. Genetic analysis revealed 1.4% of amino acids to differ with Sofjin-HO. No difference between the two strains was detected in the motif sequence of the viral enzyme, cleavage sites of viral protein or glycosylation sites of NS1.
