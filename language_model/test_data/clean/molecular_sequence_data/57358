The nucleotide sequence of a fragment of 4867 base pairs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome II has been determined. The sequence contains three complete open reading frames. In addition to the already known gene RPB5, coding for a subunit shared by all three DNA directed RNA polymerases, two new open reading frames could be identified. YBR12.03 codes for a protein of 183 amino acids with homology to one of the proteins of the Bacillus subtilis riboflavin biosynthesis operon (RibG). Deletion mutants of YBR12.03 can germinate but stop growing after five to seven cell divisions on YPD. Supplementation with high concentrations of riboflavin does promote growth. YBR12.05 codes for a protein of 386 amino acids with homology to STI1, a stress-inducible protein of S. cerevisiae. Deletion mutants of YBR12.05 are not viable.
