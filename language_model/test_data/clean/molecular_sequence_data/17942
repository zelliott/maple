The ultra-trace analysis of opioid peptides in biological samples can be achieved by multidimensional liquid chromatography with pre-column fluorogenic derivatization with naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxaldehyde in the presence of cyanide ion. However, in order to take full advantage of the high sensitivity possible with detectors based on laser-induced fluorescence or chemiluminescence, each component of the analytical method must be carefully optimized. In this study, strategies are presented for the prediction of retention time and the optimization of separations of derivatized opioid peptides in multidimensional LC systems.
