The mouse KC gene is an alpha-chemokine gene whose transcription is induced in mononuclear phagocytes by LPS. DNA sequences necessary for transcriptional control of KC by LPS were identified in the region flanking the transcription start site. Transient transfection analysis in macrophages using deletion mutants of a 1.5-kb sequence placed in front of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene identified an LPS-responsive region between residues -104 and +30. This region contained two kappa B sequence motifs. The first motif (position -70 to -59, kappa beta 1) is highly conserved in all three human GRO genes and in the mouse macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) gene. The second kappa B motif (position -89 to -78, kappa B2) was conserved only between the mouse and the rat KC genes. Consistent with previous reports, the highly conserved kappa B site (kappa B1) was essential for LPS inducibility. Surprisingly, the distal kappa B site (kappa B2) was also necessary for optimal response; mutation of either kappa B site markedly reduced sensitivity to LPS in RAW264.7 cells and to TNF-alpha in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Although both kappa B1 and kappa B2 sequences were able to bind members of the Rel homology family, including NF kappa B1 (P50), RelA (65), and c-Rel, the kappa B1 site bound these factors with higher affinity and functioned more effectively than the kappa B2 site in a heterologous promoter. These findings demonstrate that transcriptional control of the KC gene requires cooperation between two kappa B sites and is thus distinct from that of the three human GRO genes and the mouse MIP-2 gene.
