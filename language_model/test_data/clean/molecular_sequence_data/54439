We report the electrochemical characterization and microbial community analysis of closed circuit microbial fuel cells (CC-MFCs) and open circuit (OC) cells continuously fed with propionate as substrate. Differences in power output between MFCs correlated with their polarization behavior, which is related to the maturation of the anodophilic communities. The microbial communities residing in the biofilm growing on the electrode, biofouled cation-exchange membrane and anodic chamber liquor of OC-and CC-MFCs were characterized by restriction fragment length polymorphism screening of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. The results show that the CC-MFC anode was enriched in several microorganisms related to known electrochemically active and dissimilatory Fe(III) reducing bacteria, mostly from the Geobacter spp., to the detriment of Bacteroidetes abundant in the OC-MFC anode. The results also evidenced the lack of a specific pelagic community in the liquor sample. The biofilm growing on the cation-exchange membrane of the CC-MFC was found to be composed of a low-diversity community dominated by two microaerophilic species of the Achromobacter and Azovibrio genus.
