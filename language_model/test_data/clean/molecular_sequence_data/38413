Src-like adapter protein (Slap) is a recently identified protein that negatively regulates mitogenesis in murine fibroblasts (S. Roche, G. Alonso, A. Kazlausakas, V. M. Dixit, S. A. Courtneidge, and A. Pandey, Curr. Biol. 8:975-978, 1998) and comprises an SH3 and SH2 domain with striking identity to the corresponding Src domains. In light of this, we sought to investigate whether Slap could be an antagonist of all Src functions. Like Src, Slap was found to be myristylated in vivo and largely colocalized with Src when coexpressed in Cos7 cells. Microinjection of a Slap-expressing construct into quiescent NIH 3T3 cells inhibited platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced DNA synthesis, and the inhibition was rescued by the transcription factor c-Myc but not by c-Jun/c-Fos expression. Fyn (or Src) overexpression overrides the G(1)/S block induced by both SrcK- and a Slap mutant with a deletion of its C terminus (SlapDeltaC), but not the block induced by Slap or SlapDeltaSH3, implying that the C terminus is a noncompetitive inhibitor of Src mitogenic function. Furthermore, a chimeric adapter comprising SrcDeltaK fused to the Slap C terminus (Src/SlapC) also inhibited Src function during the PDGF response in a noncompetitive manner, as Src coexpression could not rescue PDGF signaling. Slap, however, did not reverse deregulated Src-induced cell transformation, as it was unable to inhibit depolymerization of actin stress fibers while still being able to inhibit SrcY527F-induced DNA synthesis. This was attributed to a distinct Slap SH3 binding specificity, since the chimeric Slap/SrcSH3 molecule, in which the Slap SH3 was replaced by the Src SH3 sequence, substantially restored stress fiber formation. Indeed, three amino acids important for ligand binding in Src SH3 were replaced in the Slap SH3 sequence; Slap SH3 did not bind to the Src SH3 partners p85alpha, Shc, and Sam68 in vitro, and the chimeric tyrosine kinase Slap/SrcK, composed of SlapDeltaC fused to the SH2 linker kinase sequence of Src, was not regulated in vivo. Furthermore, the Src SH3 domain is required for signaling during mitogenesis and since Slap/SrcK behaved as a dominant negative in the PDGF mitogenic response when microinjected into quiescent fibroblasts. We conclude that Slap is a negative regulator of Src during mitogenesis involving both the SH2 and the C terminus domains in a noncompetitive manner, but it does not regulate all Src function due to specific SH3 binding substrates.
