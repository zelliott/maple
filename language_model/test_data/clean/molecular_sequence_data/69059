A cDNA clone (Zm58.1) was isolated by differential screening from a cDNA library made to mature Zea mays pollen, and shown to be pollen-specific by RNA blot analysis. When this partial-length clone was used to probe a genomic library, a similar but distinct pollen-specific genomic clone (68% sequence identity) was isolated (Zm58.2). The putative proteins coded for by these two clones show sequence homology to several flower-expressed gene products from various plant species, including known pollen allergens from short ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), and to pectate lyases from the plant pathogenic bacteria Erwinia spp. The two genes map to different chromosomes.
