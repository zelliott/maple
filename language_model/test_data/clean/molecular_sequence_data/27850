We have studied the distortions induced in double-stranded oligonucleotides by covalently bound acetylaminofluorene residues and by apurinic sites. Within the acetylaminofluorene-modified oligonucleotide three base-pairs are unpaired as detected by the chemical probes chloroacetaldehyde and osmium tetroxide. These two probes reveal that the bases adjacent to the apurinic site are paired. In both the modified double-stranded oligonucleotides, the backbone on the 5' side of the modification is more reactive with 1,10-phenanthroline copper than the backbone on the 3' side. On polyacrylamide gels, the ligated multimers of acetylaminofluorene or apurinic site-modified oligonucleotides migrate slower than the multimers of the unmodified oligonucleotides. It is suggested that the acetylaminofluorene-modified guanine residues and the apurinic sites behave more as hinge joints than as the centres of directed bends.
