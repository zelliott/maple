Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is tightly linked to the muscle-type glycogen phosphorylase (PYGM) gene in 11q13. This region of the human genome contains additional disease-related loci implicated in the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, familial paraganglioma type 2, spinocerebellar ataxia type 5, Bardet-Biedl syndrome and translocation t(11;17) described in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We approached cloning of candidate disease genes from 11q13 by large-scale genomic sequencing. We obtained > 106 kb of sequence around the PYGM gene and established a transcriptional map that includes: (i) two genes previously localized to 11q13, PYGM and a zinc-finger protein (ZFM1) gene; (ii) the germinal center kinase (GCK, human B-lymphocyte serine/threonine protein kinase) gene; (iii) a novel human CDC25-like (HCDC25L) gene; (iv) a dystrophia myotonica protein kinase-like (DMPKL) gene; and (v) a novel ubiquitously expressed gene of unknown function (germinal center kinase- neighboring gene, GCKNG).
