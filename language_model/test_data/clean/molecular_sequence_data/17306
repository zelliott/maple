The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K homology (KH) domain is an evolutionarily conserved module that binds short ribonucleotide sequences. KH domains most often are present in multiple copies per protein. In vitro studies of hnRNP K and other KH domain bearing proteins have yielded conflicting results regarding the relative contribution of each KH domain to the binding of target RNAs. To assess this RNA-binding we used full-length hnRNP K, its fragments and the yeast ortholog as baits in the yeast three-hybrid system. The results demonstrate that in this heterologous in vivo system, the three KH domains bind RNA synergistically and that a single KH domain, in comparison, binds RNA weakly.
