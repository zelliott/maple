Identifying the genetic variants that alter MUC1 protein expression may further our understanding of the risk for development of gastric cancer (GC). We used PCR-SSPs to identify the genotype of MUC1 A/G polymorphism at its 568 site of exon 2 and immunohistochemistry to detect MUC1 protein expression in GC patients and non-cancer subjects and analyzed the association between this polymorphism and MUC1 protein expression. We found that the frequency of AA genotype was significantly high in the GC patients and the risk for GC in AA genotype carriers increased 1.81-fold. Moreover, we found a significant underexpression of MUC1 protein in GC as compared to non-cancer subjects, which was negatively correlated to AA genotype of MUC1 (r=-0.1790, P=0.004). Furthermore, this study provides a possible mechanistic insight that the MUC1 A/G polymorphism at its 568 site disrupts the physiological functions of MUC1 which is important to the physiological protection of gastric mucosa. Thus we have provided evidence that may identify the MUC1 A/G polymorphism at 568 site, as a potential genetic factor which leads to an increase in susceptibility for GC through alteration of MUC1 gene and MUC1 expression in the population that carry the A allele.
