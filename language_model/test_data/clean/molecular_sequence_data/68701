We exchanged specific amino acids in the basic region of the murine N-Myc protein and tested the mutant proteins for their DNA binding specificity. The amino acids we exchanged were chosen in analogy to residues of the homologous basic regions of bHLH and bZIP proteins. Mutant N-Myc peptides were expressed in Escherichia coli and specific DNA binding was monitored by gel shift experiments. For this we used palindromic target sequences with systematic base pair exchanges. Several mutants with altered DNA binding specificity were identified. Amino acid exchanges of residues -14 or -10 of the basic region lead to specificity changes (we define leucine 402 of N-Myc as +1; comparable to GCN4 see (1)). The palindromic N-Myc recognition sequence 5'CACGTG is no longer recognized by the mutant proteins, but DNA fragments with symmetrical exchanges of the target sequence are. Exchanges at position -15 broaden the binding specificity. These data were used to build a computer based model of the putative interactions of the N-Myc basic DNA binding region with its target sequence.
