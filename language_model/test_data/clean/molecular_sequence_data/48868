A novel halophilic, filamentous actinobacterium, designated strain TRM 40139(T), was isolated from a hypersaline habitat in Xinjiang Province, north-west China. Its taxonomic status was determined using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analysis based on the almost-complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of the strain showed that it formed a well-separated sub-branch within the radiation of the genus Actinopolyspora and the organism was related most closely to the type strains of Actinopolyspora alba (97.6 % similarity), Actinopolyspora xinjiangensis (97.6 %) and Actinopolyspora erythraea (97.1 %). However, it had relatively lower mean DNA-DNA relatedness values with the above strains (36.4, 31.3 and 26.1 %, respectively). Optimal growth occurred at 35 Â°C, at pH 7.0 and in the presence of 12 % (w/v) NaCl. The whole-cell sugar pattern consisted of xylose, glucose, ribose and arabinose. The major fatty acids were iso-C16 : 0 (28.0 %) and anteiso-C17 : 0 (27.6 %). The diagnostic phospholipids detected were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol and two unknown phospholipids. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H4) (49.8 %) and MK-10(H4) (24.2 %). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 66.4 mol%. Strain TRM 40139(T) therefore represents a novel species of the genus Actinopolyspora, for which the name Actinopolyspora lacussalsi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is TRM 40139(T) (= KCTC 19657(T) = CCTCC AA 2012020(T)).
