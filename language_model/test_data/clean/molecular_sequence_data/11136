Four closely related cyclic-nucleotide specific phosphodiesterase (PDE4) genes have been identified in both humans and rats: PDE4A, 4B, 4C and 4D. We have now cloned cDNAs for multiple splice variants of human PDE4C. Two splice variants, PDE4C-791 and PDE4C-426, were isolated from a fetal lung library. The longest open reading frame (ORF) of 791 amino acids (aa) is encoded by PDE4C-791, which is similar to a recently described cDNA [Engels, P., Sullivan, M., Muller, T. and Lubbert, H. FEBS Lett. 358 (1995) 305-10], except that an alternative 5'-end sequence upstream of the first methionine extends the PDE4C-791 ORF by 79 aa. The PDE4C-426 variant contains 3 insertions that are located 5' to the catalytic domain and encode several in-frame stop codons. The predicted 426 aa protein initiates at a methionine 365 aa within PDE4C-791. A baculovirus clone starting at this methionine expressed an enzymatically active protein. Two additional splice variants, PDE4C-delta54 and PDE4C-delta109, were found in testis mRNA. PDE4C-delta54 contained a novel 5'-end region and a deletion of 162 nt; the predicted protein deletes 54 aa from the amino-terminal region. The PDE4C-delta54 protein produced in baculovirus-infected cells was enzymatically active and sensitive to PDE4-specific inhibitors. The PDE4C-delta109 protein is similar to PDE4C-delta54 but has an additional 55 aa deleted in the catalytic domain; it lacked enzymatic activity. Analysis of uncloned total mRNA from 4 tissue sources by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed the presence of mRNAs with the two deletions and three insertions that we observed in cDNA clones. The PDE4C-delta54 variant was found only in testis and the 5'-extended region of PDE4C-791 was seen only in lung and the melanoma cell line G361. Hence, tissue-specific expression of various PDE4C isoforms should be considered in understanding how these gene products modulate cellular responses to cAMP.
