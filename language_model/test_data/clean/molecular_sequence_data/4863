We describe a childhood mitochondrial disorder in which the clinical symptoms began and remained confined to the gastrointestinal (GI) system during the first 4 y. Seizures heralded the onset of progressive encephalopathy at age 7. Peripheral neuropathy, retinitis pigmentosa, and neural deafness developed subsequently. Laboratory investigations disclosed elevated levels of plasma lactate, and a muscle biopsy revealed ragged red fibers lacking cytochrome c oxidase activity and diminished levels of respiratory chain enzyme complexes. Molecular genetic tests failed to show any of the previously reported pathogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations. We therefore screened the whole mitochondrial genome by coupling restriction digestions with single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) patterns. We identified a unique SSCP in the segment that encompassed the tRNA(Lys) gene, and direct sequencing of this segment revealed a G-->A transition at an evolutionarily conserved nucleotide at mtDNA position 8313. This G8313A transition was heteroplasmic in muscle and fibroblasts of the patient, but was absent in the white blood cells and platelets from his maternal relatives. This report illustrates how GI symptoms can be the initial manifestation in a mitochondrial disorder and suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction should be considered in differentials of unexplained chronic GI symptoms, especially when lactic acidosis or other unrelated clinical signs or symptoms are present.
