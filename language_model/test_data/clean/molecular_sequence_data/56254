The monogenetic kinetoplastid protozoan parasite Herpetomonas samuelpessoai expresses a surface-exposed metalloprotease. Comparable to the Leishmania promastigote surface protease, or PSP, the protease of Herpetomonas is active at the surface of fixed and live organisms, and both enzymes display an identical cleavage specificity toward a nonapeptide substrate. The protease was enriched 440 times by partition into Triton X-114 followed by 2 steps of anion exchange chromatography. The 56-kDa enzyme is inhibited by the metal chelator 1,10-phenanthroline and is susceptible to cleavage by glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (GPI-PLC). The conservation of an identical surface protease activity in these monogenetic and digenetic trypanosomatids suggests that the enzyme has a physiological function in the promastigote (insect) stage of these parasites.
