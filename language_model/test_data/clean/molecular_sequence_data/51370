Various monosaccharides and oligosaccharides were used to define the specificity of the Butea frondosa lectin using the hapten inhibition technique of human erythrocyte agglutination. Although B. frondosa lectin exhibited higher affinity for N-acetylgalactosamine, lactose and N-acetyllactosamine appeared to be relatively good inhibitors of haemagglutination. The behaviour of N-acetyllactosamine-type oligosaccharides and glycopeptides on a column of B. frondosa lectin immobilized on Sepharose 4B showed that the sugar-binding specificity of the lectin is directed towards unmasked N-acetyllactosamine sequences. Substitution of these N-acetyllactosamine sequences by sialic acid residues completely abolished the affinity of the lectin for the saccharides. The presence of one or several alpha Fuc(1-3)GlcNAc groups completely inhibited the interaction between the glycopeptides and the lectin. Substitution of the core beta-mannose residue by an additional bisecting beta(1-4)GlcNAc residue decreases the affinity of the lectin for these structures as compared with the unsubstituted ones.
