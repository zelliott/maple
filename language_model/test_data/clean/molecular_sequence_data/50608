The early 3 region (E3) of two strains (genome type Ad11p and Ad11a) of human adenovirus serotype 11, causing persistent urinary and acute respiratory illnesses, respectively, has been identified and partially sequenced. The sequenced E3 regions of Ad11p and Ad11a were 1980 and 1966 bp long and encoded three complete ORFs, 18.5, 20.3, 20.6k within the Ad11p genome and 18.5, 20.3, 20.2k within the Ad11a genome. The sequence analysis of the 18.5k gene product demonstrated that a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain of Ad11p, Ad11a, and Ad35 was identical. Ad11p and Ad35 were homologous in the signal sequence. There was one amino acid mismatch between Ad11p and Ad11a, represented by an alanine instead of a proline. The endoplasmic reticulum lumenal domain, which binds to class I MHC, was relatively conserved between Ad11p and Ad11a with the exception of Glu80 and Glu104 in Ad11p, which were replaced by Gln80 and Lys104 in Ad11a. Within the 20.2k protein of Ad11a, the amino acid sequence Thr-Thr-Ser-His was deleted from a position immediately upstream the transmembrane region of the Ad11p 20.6k protein. The 9.0k E3 open reading frame (ORF) of Ad3 was deleted in the genomes of Ad11p and Ad11a. It is noteworthy that Ad11p and Ad35 which both cause persistent infection of the urinary tract display a remarkable similarity in several ORFs of the E3 region.
