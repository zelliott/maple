We determined the polymorphous 400-bp regions in UL53, US1, and US4 for the discrimination of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) strains. Thirty-six HSV-2 clinical strains could be differentiated into 35 groups using these three regions and into 36 groups by additional analysis of three noncoding regions previously reported as polymorphous.
