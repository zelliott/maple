Metallothioneins (MT) are expressed during early development in species of several groups. To understand MT function in developmental processes, we studied the MT system of Xenopus laevis, a model vertebrate species in experimental embryology. We first purified and sequenced the liver MT from copper-treated animals. This 62-amino-acid protein shares the main structural properties of known vertebrate MT, and is more closely related to avian than to fish or mammalian MT. Using this sequence, we designed oligonucleotide primers to amplify and isolate a MT clone from a XL2 cell line cDNA library. This 752-bp cDNA encodes a putative 62-amino-acid-long protein that is 100% identical with the sequenced MT. Zinc, cadmium, and copper ions are very efficient inducers of MT mRNA accumulation in Xenopus liver and cell lines.
