Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have been proved to participate in a wide variety of processes, including growth, differentiation, cell proliferation, migration, sex determination and sex differentiation. The roles of FGF9/16/20 subfamily members in the gonadal development of teleost fish have not yet been reported. Three FGFs (16, 20a and 20b) of the FGF9/16/20 subfamily were cloned from the Nile tilapia by RT-PCR and RACE. Phylogenetic, bioinformatic and syntenic analyses demonstrated that these cloned FGFs are genuine FGF16, 20a and 20b. Our analyses further supported the non-existence of FGF9 ortholog and the existence of two FGF20 paralogs in teleost genomes. Tissue distribution analysis by RT-PCR demonstrated that FGF16 was expressed in a wide range of tissues including the testis and ovary, FGF20b in the brain, pituitary, intestine and ovary, but not in the testis, while FGF20a in the brain, pituitary and spleen, but not in the gonad. These results were consistent with the Northern blot analysis. The expression profiles of FGF16 and FGF20b during normal and sex reversed gonadal development were investigated by real-time PCR. Both showed much higher expression in the XX ovary and 17 beta-estradiol induced XY ovary compared with the XY testis and fadrozole and tamoxifen induced XX testis, with the highest in both sexes at 120Â dah. Strong signals of FGF16 and FGF20b were detected in phase II oocytes by in situ hybridization. These data suggest that FGF9/16/20 subfamily is involved in the early oocyte development of the female.
