To prepare the microarray for detection of hepatitis D virus (HDV).

Several pairs of specific PCR primers were designed according to the conserved region of HDV genome. The DNA microarray were prepared by blotting the PCR products onto the surface of glass slides with the use of robotics, and restriction display PCR (RD-PCR) was employed to label the samples.

Sequences analysis showed that the products of PCR amplification were the specific gene fragments of HDV. Hybridization signals on the gene chip demonstrated good specificity and sensitivity of the microarray for HDV detection.

Microarray-based clinical HDV detection can be sensitive and effective.
