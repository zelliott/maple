Methyl alpha- and beta-D-galactopyranosides and 4-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-3,6-anhydro-L-galactose dimethylacetal were sulfated with sulfuric acid and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide as a condensation reagent. The sulfated sugars were isolated by ion-exchange chromatography, characterized, and assigned by methylation analyses. On the basis of the yield of each sulfated product that was isolated, sulfation on O-6 appeared to be predominant.
