Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin with both genetic and environmental risk factors. Here we describe the creation of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map spanning 900-1200 kb of chromosome 3q21, which had been previously recognized as containing a psoriasis susceptibility locus, PSORS5. We genotyped 644 individuals, from 195 Swedish psoriatic families, for 19 polymorphisms. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between marker and disease was assessed using the transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT). In the TDT analysis, alleles of three of these SNPs showed significant association with disease (P<0.05). A 160-kb interval encompassing these three SNPs was sequenced, and a coding sequence consisting of 13 exons was identified. The predicted protein shares 30-40% homology with the family of cation/chloride cotransporters. A five-marker haplotype spanning the 3' half of this gene is associated with psoriasis to a P value of 3.8<10(-5). We have called this gene SLC12A8, coding for a member of the solute carrier family 12 proteins. It belongs to a class of genes that were previously unrecognized as playing a role in psoriasis pathogenesis.
