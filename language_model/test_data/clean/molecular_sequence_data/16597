The C-terminal region of the breast-cancer-associated protein BRCA1 contains a pair of tandem BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) repeats that are essential for the tumour suppressor function of the protein. Similar repeat sequences have been identified in many proteins that seem to mediate cellular mechanisms for dealing with DNA damage. The BRCT domain in BRCA1 has been recently shown to constitute a module for recognizing phosphorylated (phospho-) peptides, with a recognition groove that spans both BRCT repeats. The fact that many other BRCT-containing proteins have phospho-peptide binding activity suggests that BRCT repeats might mediate phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interactions in processes that are central to cell-cycle checkpoint and DNA repair functions.
