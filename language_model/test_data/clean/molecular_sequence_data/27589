To explore the secondary structures of lingual and pancreatic lipases, circular dichroism measurements were performed. Maximum average ellipticities were used to calculate the percentage of alpha-helices, beta-sheets, and random coils. Lingual lipase had an ellipticity of -20235 +/- 140 deg cm2/dmol (mean +/- SE) at 220 nm suggesting 60% alpha-helix, 20% beta-sheet and 20% random coil structure, but the mean ellipticity for pancreatic lipase was -14093 +/- 82 deg cm2/dmol (mean +/- SE) at 210 nm suggesting a 34.8% alpha-helical, 25% beta-sheet and 40% random coil secondary structure. An alpha-helical stretch of residues with a large hydrophobic moment ("globular" alpha-helix by hydrophobic moment plot) from amino acids 382 through 389 at the COOH-terminal end of lingual lipase was noted. This sequence, absent in pancreatic lipase, may account for the avid binding of lingual lipase to fat emulsion particles.
