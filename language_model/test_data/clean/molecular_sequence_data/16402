We cloned the Bombina orientalis adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase subunit b gene from a B. orientalis oviduct cDNA library. The transcript was 997 bp long and encoded 250 amino acid residues. It showed high similarity to amphibian (84-85%), mammalian (56-62%) and invertebrate (46-50%) sequences. In phylogenetic analyses, it clustered with other amphibian sequences. This gene was highly expressed in brain, intestine and oviduct but not in muscle and liver. In this paper, we report the basic characteristics of B. orientalis ATP synthase subunit b gene.
