We investigated the molecular basis of hyperekplexia (STHE), an inherited neurological disorder characterised by neonatal hypertonia and an exaggerated startle response, in a kindred and identified a novel missense mutation in the pore-lining M2 domain of the alpha1 subunit of the glycine receptor (GLRA1). Sequencing analysis of all exons of the GLRA1 gene revealed a G1158A base transition in affected, heterozygous patients. The base transition results in a valine to methionine substitution at codon 260 in the middle of the M2 transmembrane domain. The location within the M2 domain suggests for this substitution a likely role in altering ion channel properties.
