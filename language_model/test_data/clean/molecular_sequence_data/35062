Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is a common autosomal recessive disorder. Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency is the most common urea cycle disorder and demonstrates X-linked inheritance. In female OTC deficiency, phenotypes are variable according to X-inactivation patterns. These disorders develop separately, and their co-morbidity is extremely rare. We report one girl with CAH showing recurrent hyperammonemia and hepatitis after 2 years-of-age due to additional OTC deficiency.
