PCR and direct sequencing of 300 to 377-bp fragments of the cytochrome b mitochondrial gene were carried out in 40 specimens of European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax L., collected at different sites in the Mediterranean basin and representing wild and farmed populations. Sequence analysis revealed 6 transitional changes, which generated 5 different haplotypes (A-E). Only one mutation was nonsynonymous because it occurred in the first position of a codon leading to the replacement of valine by isoleucine. The genotypic distribution revealed that haplotype B was not present in the farm samples, whereas its frequency in the wild samples exceeded 30%. In contrast, haplotypes D and E were found in farmed populations but not in the wild populations. The comparison among wild populations showed a nonhomogeneous distribution of the two most frequent haplotypes, A and B.
