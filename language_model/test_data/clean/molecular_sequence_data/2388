A synthetic DNA probe designed to detect coding sequences for platelet factor 4 and connective tissue-activating peptide III (two human platelet alpha-granule proteins) was used to identify several similar sequences in total human DNA. Sequence analysis of a corresponding 3,201-base-pair EcoRI fragment isolated from a human genomic library demonstrated the existence of a variant of platelet factor 4, designated PF4var1. The gene for PF4var1 consisted of three exons and two introns. Exon 1 coded for a 34-amino-acid hydrophobic leader sequence that had 70% sequence homology with the leader sequence for PF4 but, in contrast, contained a hydrophilic amino-terminal region with four arginine residues. Exon 2 coded for a 42-amino-acid segment that was 100% identical with the corresponding segment of the mature PF4 sequence containing the amino-terminal and disulfide-bonded core regions. Exon 3 coded for the 28-residue carboxy-terminal region corresponding to a domain specifying heparin-binding and cellular chemotaxis. However, PF4var1 had amino acid differences at three positions in the lysine-rich carboxy-terminal end that were all conserved among human, bovine, and rat PF4s. These differences should significantly affect the secondary structure and heparin-binding properties of the protein based on considerations of the bovine PF4 crystal structure. By comparing the PF4var1 genomic sequence with the known human cDNA and the rat genomic PF4-coding sequences, we identified potential genetic regulatory regions for PF4var1. Rat PF4 and human PF4var1 genes had identical 18-base sequences 5' to the promoter region. The intron positions appeared to correspond approximately to the boundaries of the protein functional domains.
