As many as 47 amphibian and mammalian, natural and non-natural opioid peptides have been examined in guinea-pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) preparations. The great value of these extremely simple and accessible tissue models in the identification, isolation and purification of endogenous opioid peptides, in studying structure/activity relationships, and in determining selectivity of the peptide molecules for the various opioid receptors, especially delta- and mu-receptors, is emphasized.
