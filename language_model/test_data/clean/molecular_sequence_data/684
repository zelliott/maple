Extraadrenal pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare entities within the pediatric population. We report the presentation of three synchronous extra-adrenal abdominal paragangliomas in an adolescent boy who carries a germline mutation in the succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB) gene. Loss of heterozygosity of this allele was demonstrated by direct sequencing of DNA from two of his tumors, confirming loss of tumor suppressor function in the pathogenesis of these paragangliomas.
