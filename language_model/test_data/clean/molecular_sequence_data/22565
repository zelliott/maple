Two actinomycete strains, designated YIM 30006(T) and YIM 31075(T), were isolated from soil samples in Yunnan, China and subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. Morphological and chemotaxonomic analysis revealed that the two isolates should be consistent with the nocardioform actinomycetes. Comparative 16S rDNA sequences confirmed that the two unknown isolates to be members of the genus Kribbella. Based on the results of phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic studies and DNA-DNA hybridization results, strains YIM 30006(T) and YIM 31075(T) should be classified as two novel species of the genus Kribbella, for which the names Kribbella yunnanensis sp. nov. and Kribbella alba sp. nov. are proposed. The type strains for them are YIM 30006(T) (=CCTCC AA001019(T)=DSM 15499(T)) and YIM 31075(T) (=CCTCC AA 001020(T)=DSM 15500(T)), respectively. The 16S rDNA sequences of strains YIM 30006(T), YIM 31075(T) have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers AY 082061 and AY 082062, respectively.
