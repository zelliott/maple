We have discovered a new HLA-DQB1 allele in a Japanese family, MAT. In the family the new allele segregates in three generations and demonstrates the positive association with DRB1*0901. We observed a novel RFLP pattern in the course of examining the modified PCR-RFLP method for HLA-DQB1 genotyping. The PCR-SSOP analysis also showed a new hybridized pattern. Sequence analysis of the allele indicates that it was generated by a gene conversion-like event between the HLADQB1*03032 and one of DQB1*04 contemporary alleles. This new allelic product did not react with all of allosera and monoclonal antibodies against DQ1, DQ2, DQ3, DQ4 and DQ7. The HLA molecule encoded by the allele is not defined by serology. This new allele was officially recognized and named DQB1*0306 by the WHO Nomenclature Committee in November 1995.
