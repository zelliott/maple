The fourth gene of a porcine (S8) and eight human rotavirus isolates possessing the major human VP4 specificity (P1A serotype and/or P[8] genotype) were partially sequenced and compared to other available P[8] sequences from rotaviruses types G1, G3, G5 and G9 specificities which had been originally recovered from children with diarrhea in Japan, Brazil and the USA. Brazilian rotavirus S8 represented the single known porcine rotavirus with this P specificity. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two lineages or subgenotypes within P[8] strains: the F45-like P subgenotype comprised most of the strains, including all the human G5 isolates analyzed, whereas the Wa- or S8-like subgenotype consisted of only a human isolate obtained in the same geographic region as S8 and an American strain with atypical RNA profile besides the prototypes Wa and S8 viruses. A conserved basic amino acid residue at position 131 in VP4 seemed characteristic of the F45-like P[8] subgenotype.
