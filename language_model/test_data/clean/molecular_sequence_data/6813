Two Spanish plum pox virus (PPV) isolates, 5.15 and 3.3, were used in transmission experiments involving the aphid vector Myzus persicae, with woody and herbaceous host plants. These isolates differ in the size of their coat protein (CP) and sequence analysis revealed that isolate 3.3 has a 15 amino acid deletion near the N terminus of the CP, affecting the same positions as in a previously reported non-aphid-transmissible PPV isolate from Germany. Aphid transmission experiments showed that isolate 5.15 was transmitted from infected plants whereas isolate 3.3 was not. In contrast, both isolates were readily aphid-transmitted when acquired through artificial membranes from purified virus preparations supplemented with purified helper component (HC) obtained from potato virus Y-infected plants. This indicates that non-transmissibility of isolate 3.3 may be due to a defect in the HC rather than in the CP.
