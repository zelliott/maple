A 1468 b.p. DNA BamHI-fragment homologous to the Bsp-repeat was isolated from the fox genome and sequenced. This fragment is an hierarchically arranged dimer. Its 734 b.p.-monomers consist of three subrepeats (SR), each 245 b.p. long, abundant with overlapping imperfect tandem repeats which in turn are rich in short direct related repeats (each 4-7 b.p. in size). The latters are mainly composed of AG, TG dinucleotides and their complements CT, CA. All subrepeats in the BamHI-dimer are flanked by motifs homologous to Jeffreys' sites. At certain points the sites are doubled. The above data allow to assume that the Bsp-repeat complex structure is likely to have developed throughout long multi-step evolution of relatively simple DNA sequences which had emerged de novo. Single substitutions, small inserts and deletions, multiple duplication and recombination events seem to have most contributed to the evolution of the Bsp-repeats. Single substitutions in SRs with respect to the consensus are not equally distributed along their length. A wave-like pattern of this distribution is the evidence for non-random character of mutations accumulation. A correspondence was noted between conservative regions in SR and the presence therein of functional motifs homologous to the binding sites of already known regulatory proteins.
