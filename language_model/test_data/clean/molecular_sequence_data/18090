We have screened a pea genomic library using a cDNA probe derived from pea shoot RNA. From this screen, we isolated two closely related genes, designated as S2 and P4. An intriguing property of these two genes is the presence in their coding region of a repeated sequence that is conserved between them in sequence but not in the number of the repeating units. The predicted amino acid sequence suggests that these proteins could be exported and glycosylated. 3' S1 analysis reveals that one of the genes, S2, is expressed highly in stem, as expected from previous work. However, mRNA derived from the other gene, P4, is not detectable in stem tissue, but is present in tissue derived from pea pods. The 5' upstream sequence of S2 and P4 are 94% identical up to position -121, suggesting that sequences upstream of -121 are responsible for organ-specific expression of the two genes.
