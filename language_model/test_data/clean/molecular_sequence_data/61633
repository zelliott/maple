Beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4Gal-T) (EC 2.4.1.38) plays a multifunctional role in many aspects of normal cell physiology. By now, several dozens of beta4Gal-T genes have been cloned, separated from mouse, chick, bovine, human, etc. This paper presents the cloning and GST-fused expression of mouse beta4Gal-T gene in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The target gene was cloned by PCR, followed by identification by DNA sequencing and expression in E.coli with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) gradient concentrations, products of which were separated on SDS-PAGE showing that the target protein had the same molecular weight as that of mouse beta4Gal-T. The transcriptional product of beta4Gal-T gene was proved by Western hybridization analysis to be due to GST-fusion.
