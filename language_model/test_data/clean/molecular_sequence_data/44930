A strong promoter of the transition to flowering in Arabidopsis is encoded by FCA. FCA has been cloned and shown to encode a protein containing two RNA-binding domains and a WW protein interaction domain. This suggests that FCA functions in the posttranscriptional regulation of transcripts involved in the flowering process. The FCA transcript is alternatively spliced with only one form encoding the entire FCA protein. Plants carrying the FCA gene fused to the strong constitutive 35S promoter flowered earlier, and the ratio and abundance of the different FCA transcripts were altered. Thus, FCA appears to be a component of a posttranscriptional cascade involved in the control of flowering time.
