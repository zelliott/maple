Polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis has been traditionally used for the analysis of synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides. As the demand for oligonucleotides of high purity has increased, a need for additional high resolution analytical techniques has arisen. This report describes the principles and application of capillary gel electrophoresis and high-performance liquid chromatography for the analysis of synthetic DNA varying in base composition and length. From the results of a series of comparative experiments, the relative advantages and disadvantages of each technique are discussed.
