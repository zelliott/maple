Bud pollinations allowed me to examine the effects of homozygosity at loci in the area of suppressed recombination around the S-locus in Solanum carolinense, whose S-alleles show surprisingly low diversification rates. The total number of seeds produced was lower for incompatible than compatible pollinations, revealing that self-incompatibility was only somewhat overcome by bud pollination. However, low seed set in incompatible crosses was not due solely to the incompatibility response; crosses between distinct plants sharing the same alleles at the S-locus led to dramatically high seed abortion, nearly equal to that found upon selfing. An excess of heterozygotes in the surviving progeny supports the supposition that these high abortion rates are due to sheltered load, that is, previously unexpressed load accumulated due to enforced heterozygosity and recombination suppression around the S-locus. Of the seven alleles examined in total, two showed evidence of severe load and five did not. The magnitude of load was consistent with terminal branch length in some, but not all, cases.
