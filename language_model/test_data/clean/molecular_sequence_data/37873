Nuclear receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors that are mediators of the action of lipophilic hormones and other endogenous ligands and are the targets of drugs useful in a variety of therapeutic areas. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma is a nuclear receptor that, acting as a heterodimer with RXR, mediates a variety of cellular effects including adipocyte-differentiation. Due to its role in modulating insulin sensitivity, it is the target of therapeutically active anti-diabetic agents such as rosiglitazone. We have assigned the chemical shifts of the backbone atoms of the 32 kDa ligand-binding domain of PPARgamma in the presence of bound rosiglitazone. Three-dimensional HNCO spectra of the apo ligand-binding domain (LBD) have less than half the expected number of cross-peaks. The missing cross-peaks are restored upon binding strong agonists such as rosiglitazone. The NMR results indicate that the apo-LBD of PPARgamma is in a conformationally mobile state, and that agonist binding is associated with a marked stabilization of the conformation. Mapping the missing peaks to the 3D X-ray crystallographic structure indicates the region of mobility is extensive and includes the ligand-binding region and the cofactor-binding site. This leads to the conclusion that activation of this nuclear receptor is a result of a population shift of a dynamic ensemble of conformations, rather than a two-state switch from an inactive to an active conformation. Our results have important implications for the mechanisms by which antagonists, partial agonists, and agonists of nuclear receptor function operate.
