A cDNA clone encoding an interspersed repeat RNA from Xenopus oocytes was isolated. Each strand of the cDNA clone hybridized to several different oocyte transcripts of diverse size. Many of these transcripts were present in poly(A) RNA at least up to the neurula stage. DNA sequence analysis and hybrid selection and in vitro translation show that molecules of this repeat family are not translatable.
