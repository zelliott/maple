Using a polyclonal antibody, a partial cDNA clone for rat aminopeptidase M was identified in a lambda gt11 library from rat kidney. A synthetic oligonucleotide probe derived from the sequence of the insert was used to screen a randomly primed lambda gt10 library. This allowed the identification of several overlapping clones encoding the full sequence of the enzyme. The reading frame, 2898 base pairs in length, encodes a 966 amino acid polypeptide. A highly hydrophobic segment, 24 amino acids in length, located close to the aminoterminus, is proposed to serve as the membrane-spanning domain for this membrane-bound enzyme. The sequence includes nine potential N-linked glycosylation sites and one potential sulfation site. In addition, the rat aminopeptidase M sequence contains an eight amino acid consensus sequence believed to serve as the zinc binding domain in a family of zinc-metallohydrolases. Rat aminopeptidase M shows 77% similarity with the recently cloned human enzyme, as well as weaker but significant similarity with aminopeptidase N from E. coli (18%) and with human leukotriene A4 hydrolase (21%).
