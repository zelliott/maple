To amplify and sequence the partial gene coding for mucin-like protein from Chinese isolates of Schistosoma japonicum (SjMLP).

The antigenic determinants of SmMLP were predicted by PCGENE software and specific oligonucleotide primers were designed and synthesized. Total RNA was isolated from adult worms of S. japonicum using Trizol reagent and the coding region gene of SjMLP was amplified by RT-PCR technique.

The coding region of SjMLP gene was specifically amplified by RT-PCR and the size of amplified fragment was 756 base pairs. The DNA sequence analysis result indicated that the coding sequence of the MLP was highly homologous between S. mansoni and S. japonicum.

The amplified fragment is consistent to the predicted one, providing a basis for cloning and further study on DNA immunization.
