The cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) a and b subtypes display a conserved E8 open reading frame encoding a 50-amino-acid hydrophobic protein, with structural similarities to the E5 transmembrane oncoprotein of genital human PVs (HPVs). CRPV E8 has been reported to play a role in papilloma growth but not to be essential in papilloma formation. Here we report that the knockout of E8 start codon almost prevented wart induction upon biobalistic inoculation of viral DNA onto rabbit skin. The scarce warts induced showed very slow growth, despite sustained expression of E6 and E7 oncogenes. This points to an essential role of E8 in disturbing epidermal homeostasis. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we found that E8 interacted with the zinc transporter ZnT1, protocadherin 1 (PCDH1), and AHNAK/desmoyokin, three proteins as yet unrelated to viral pathogenesis or cell transformation. HPV16 E5 also interacted with these proteins in two-hybrid assay. CRPV E8 mainly localized to the Golgi apparatus and the early endosomes of transfected keratinocytes and colocalized with ZnT1, PCDH1, and AHNAK. We showed that ZnT1 and PCDH1 formed a complex and that E8 disrupted this complex. CRPV E8, like HPV16 E5, increased epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation and both the EGF-dependent and the EGF-independent activity of activating protein-1 (AP-1). Competition experiments with a nonfunctional truncated ZnT1 protein showed that E8-ZnT1 interaction was required for AP-1 activation. Our data identify CRPV E8 as a key player in papilloma induction and unravel novel cellular targets for inducing the proliferation of keratinocytes.
