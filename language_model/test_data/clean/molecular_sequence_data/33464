Naturally occurring coiled coils are often not homogeneous throughout their entire structure but rather interrupted by sequence discontinuities and non-coiled-coil-forming subsegments. We apply atomic force microscopy to locally probe the mechanical folding/unfolding process of a well-understood model coiled coil when unstructured subsegments with different sizes are added. We find that the refolding force decreases from 7.8 pN with increasing size of the added unstructured subsegment, while the unfolding properties of the model coiled coil remain unchanged. We show that this behavior results from the increased size of the nucleation seed which has to form before further coiled-coil folding can proceed. Since the nucleation seed size is linked to the width of the energetic folding barrier, we are able to directly measure the dependence of folding forces on the barrier width. Our results allow the design of coiled coils with designated refolding forces by simply adjusting the nucleation seed size.
