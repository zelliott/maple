Acyclic nucleoside analogues with carboxamido- or nitro-substituted heterocyclic bases have been evaluated for their possible use as universal bases in oligodeoxynucleotides. The acyclic moiety endows the constructs with enough flexibility to allow good base stacking. The 5-nitroindazole analogue afforded the most stable duplexes among the acyclic derivatives with the least spread in Tm versus the four natural bases. In spite of the acyclic moiety, stabilities are comparable with those of duplexes incorporating the recently described 5-nitroindole nucleoside analogue, but considerably exceed those for the 3-nitropyrrole analogue.
