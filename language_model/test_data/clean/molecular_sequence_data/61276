A shift in the spectrum of heme a induced by calcium or proton binding, or by the proton electrochemical gradient, has been attributed to interaction of Ca2+ or H+ with the vicinity of the heme propionates in mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, and proposed to be associated with the exit path of proton translocation. However, this shift is absent in cytochrome c oxidases from yeast and bacteria [Kirichenko et al. (1998) FEBS Lett. 423, 329-333]. Here we report that mutations of Glu56 or Gln63 in a newly described Ca2+/Na+ binding site in subunit I of cytochrome c oxidase from Paracoccus denitrificans [Ostermeier et al. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94, 10547-10553] establish the Ca2+-dependent spectral shift in heme a. This shift is counteracted by low pH and by sodium ions, as was described for mammalian cytochrome c oxidase, but in the mutant Paracoccus enzymes Na+ is also able to shift the heme a spectrum, albeit to a smaller extent. We conclude that the Ca2+-induced shift in both Paracoccus and mitochondrial cytochrome aa3 is due to binding of the cation to the new metal binding site. Comparison of the structures of this site in the two types of enzyme allows rationalization of their different reactivity with cations. Structural analysis and data from site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggest mechanisms by which the cation binding may influence the heme spectrum.
