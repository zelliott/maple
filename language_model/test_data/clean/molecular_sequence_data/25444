A trypsin inhibitor from the venom of the cobra Naja naja naja has been isolated by a single step of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The protein strongly inhibits trypsin (Ki = 3.5 pM). The primary structure was determined by peptide analysis of the [14C]carboxymethylated inhibitor. The 57-residue polypeptide chain belongs to the family of Kunitz-type inhibitors, and exhibits 42% residue identity with bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. The structure shows only 70% identity with the corresponding peptide from the Capa cobra (Naja nevia), establishing that the inhibitor molecule exhibits extensive variations. Functionally, a basic residue at position P3' correlates with strong inhibition.
