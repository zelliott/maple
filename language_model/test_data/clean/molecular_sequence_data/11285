The nucleotide sequence of the mip genes and their inferred amino acid sequences were determined from 35 Legionella species and compared with the published sequences for L. pneumophila, L. micdadei and L. longbeachae. The sequences were 69-97% conserved at the nucleotide level and 82-99% at the amino acid level, with total conservation of amino acids determined to be associated with sites known to be involved in peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity. No apparent difference could be determined in the arrangement of amino acids that would predict a functional difference in Mip from species associated with disease and Mip from species isolated only from the environment. Additionally, a phylogenetic comparison of the sequences with published 16S RNA sequences, using both genetic distance and maximum parsimony methods, was performed. Few relationships were apparent that were well supported by both data sets, the most robust being a clade comprising ([(cincinnatiensis, longbeachae, sainthelensi, santicrucis) gratiana] (moravica, quateirensis, shakespearei, worsleiensis) anisa, bozemanii, cherrii, dumoffii, gormanii, jordanis, parisiensis, pneumophila, steigerwaltii, tucsonensis, and wadsworthii).
