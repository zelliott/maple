Viral infection of host cells primarily depends on binding of the virus to a specific cell surface protein. In order to characterize the binding protein for group B coxsackieviruses (CVB), detergent-solubilized membrane proteins of different cell lines were tested in virus overlay protein-binding assays. A prominent virus-binding protein with a molecular mass of 100 kDa was detected in various CVB-permissive human and monkey cell lines but was not detected in nonpermissive cell lines. The specificity of CVB binding to the 100-kDa protein on permissive human cells was substantiated by binding of all six serotypes of CVB and by competition experiments. In contrast, poliovirus and Sendai virus did not bind to the 100-kDa CVB-specific protein. A fraction of HeLa membrane proteins enriched in the range of 100 kDa showed functional activity by transforming infectious CVB (160S) into A-particles (135S). In order to purify this CVB-binding protein, solubilized membrane proteins from HeLa cells were separated by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by elution of the 100-kDa protein. Amino acid sequence analysis of tryptic fragments of the CVB-binding protein indicated that this 100-kDa CVB-specific protein is a cell surface protein related to nucleolin. These results were confirmed by immunoprecipitations of the CVB-binding protein with nucleolin-specific antibodies, suggesting that a nucleolin-related membrane protein acts as a specific binding protein for the six serotypes of CVB.
