A novel, 5-methylcytosine-specific, DNA-binding protein, DBP-m, has been identified in nuclear extracts of peas. DBP-m specifically recognizes 5-methylcytosine residues in DNA without appreciable DNA sequence specificity, unlike a mammalian DNA-binding protein (MDBP), which recognizes 5-methylcytosine residues but only in a related family of 14-base-pair sequences.
