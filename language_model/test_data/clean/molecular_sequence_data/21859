Four bacterial strains, SL014B-41A4(T), SL014B-20A1(T), SL014B-76A1 and SL014B-79A, isolated from a crude oil-contaminated saline soil of Shengli Oilfield, China, were investigated using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain SL014B-41A4(T) belonged to the genus Salinarimonas in the order Rhizobiales, with the highest sequence similarity with Salinarimonas rosea YIM YD3(T) (98.3 %). The DNA-DNA relatedness of strain SL014B-41A4(T) to S. rosea YIM YD3(T) was 27.03 ± 3.0 %. Strain SL014B-41A4(T) was Gram-negative staining, facultatively anaerobic and produced deep red pigment in artificial seawater medium. Cells of strain SL014B-41A4(T) were rod-shaped (0.6-4.0 × 1.25-25 µm), motile with a single polar flagellum and often formed branches. The strain contained Q-10 as the predominant respiratory ubiquinone and C(18 : 1)ω7c (57.5 %), C(16 : 0) (16.4 %) and 10-methyl C(19 : 0) (9.1 %) as the major fatty acids. Strains SL014B-20A1(T), SL014B-76A1 and SL014B-79A were actinobacteria and belonged to the genus Tessaracoccus in the family Propionibacteriaceae of the order Actinomycetales with the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities with Tessaracoccus flavescens SST-39(T) (96.4 %), Tessaracoccus lubricantis KISS-17Se(T) (96.2 %) and Tessaracoccus bendigoensis Ben 106(T) (94.7 %). Strains SL014B-20A1(T), SL014B-76A1 and SL014B-79A were Gram-positive staining, facultatively anaerobic, non-endospore-forming, non-motile, acid-fast and oval to rod-shaped (0.48 × 0.5-1.0 µm). These three novel strains had ll-diaminopimelic acid (DAP) as the diagnostic diamino acid in the cell-wall peptidoglycan, MK-9(H(4)) as the only menaquinone and anteiso-C(15 : 0) (67.11-76.14 %) as the major cellular fatty acid. The G+C contents of the genomic DNA of strain SL014B-41A4(T) and strains SL014B-20A1(T), SL014B-76A1 and SL014B-79A were 67.68 mol% and 65.65-67.17 mol%, respectively. Based on phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, strain SL014B-41A4(T) represents a novel species of the genus Salinarimonas, for which the name Salinarimonas ramus is proposed, with strain SL014B-41A4(T) ( = DSM 22962(T) = CGMCC 1.9161(T)) as the type strain. Strains SL014B-20A1(T), SL014B-76A1 and SL014B-79A represent a novel species of the genus Tessaracoccus, for which the name Tessaracoccus oleiagri is proposed, with strain SL014B-20A1(T) ( = DSM 22955(T) = CGMCC 1.9159(T)) as the type strain.
