Ral is a member of the small GTPase-binding protein (G protein) family, and plays an important role in the Ras-RalGDS signal transduction pathway. A series of recent findings reveal several important downstream target proteins of Ral, such as RalBP1, Reps1, and others. Here we report another binding partner for RalBP1, which we have isolated from the human fetal brain library. The human REPS1 protein shares 83% amino acid identity with the mouse Reps1 protein. Northern blot analysis shows that the REPS1 is expressed in a variety of tissues, with the strongest expression in the heart and testis.
