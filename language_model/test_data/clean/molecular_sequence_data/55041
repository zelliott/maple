Peanut and buckwheat induce a severe allergic reaction, anaphylaxis, which is considered to be mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE). We identified in this study a new IgE-binding epitope of the peanut allergen that cross-reacted with buckwheat. The phosphate-buffered saline-soluble fraction of buckwheat inhibited the binding between IgE and the peanut allergen. A cross-reactive peptide was isolated from the Î±-chymotrypsin hydrolysate of peanut. Based on the amino acid sequence and mass spectrometric analysis data, the peptide was identified as Ser-Asp-Gln-Thr-Arg-Thr-Gly-Tyr (SDQTRTGY); this sequence is identical to amino acids 2-9 in the N-terminal hydrophilic domain of oleosin 3 which is located on the surface of the lipid storage body. Synthetic SDQTRTGY was found to bind with IgE in the sera of all eight peanut-allergic patients tested. Since many foods of plant origin contain oleosin, the possibility of an anaphylactic cross-reaction in allergic patients should always be considered.
