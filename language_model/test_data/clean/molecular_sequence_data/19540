ATP synthases - rotary nano machines - consist of two major parts, F(O) and F(1), connected by two stalks: the central and the peripheral stalk. In spinach chloroplasts, the central stalk (subunits gamma, epsilon) forms with the cylinder of subunits III the rotor and transmits proton motive force from F(O) to F(1), inducing conformational changes of the catalytic centers in F(1). The epsilon subunit is an important regulator affecting adjacent subunits as well as the activity of the whole protein complex. Using a combination of chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry, we monitored interactions of subunit epsilon in spinach chloroplast ATP synthase with III and gamma. Onto identification of interacting residues in subunits epsilon and III, one cross-link defined the distance between epsilon-Cys6 and III-Lys48 to be 9.4 A at minimum. epsilon-Cys6 was competitively cross-linked with subunit gamma. Altered cross-linking yields revealed the impact of nucleotides and Mg(2+) on cross-linking of subunit epsilon. The presence of nucleotides apparently induced a displacement of the N-terminus of subunit epsilon, which separated epsilon-Cys6 from both, III-Lys48 and subunit gamma, and thus decreasing the yield of the cross-linked subunits epsilon and gamma as well as epsilon and III. However, increasing concentrations of the cofactor Mg(2+) favoured cross-linking of epsilon-Cys6 with subunit gamma instead of III-Lys48 indicating an approximation of subunits gamma and epsilon and a separation from III-Lys48.
