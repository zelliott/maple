The regulators of complement activation (RCA) constitute a tightly linked gene family that controls the activity of the complement system. Genetic polymorphisms have been reported for all of RCA genes at the DNA, RNA and/or protein levels. In addition, multiple RNA and/or protein products have been observed for most of these genes. These polymorphisms and variants are instrumental in the study of the structure, evolution and function of the RCA family.
