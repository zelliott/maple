Alpha-mannosidase was isolated from the culture liquid of Oerskovia sp. The purified enzyme had a molecular mass of 480 kDa and comprises four identical subunits. The enzyme cleaves bonds in side chains of yeast mannan (Km = 0.08 mM, k(cat) = 1.02 micromol x min(-1) x mg(-1)) and reveals a low activity towards p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside. The alpha-mannosidase is a Ca2+-dependent enzyme and is inhibited by EDTA. The enzyme possess no endo-mannosidase activity releasing only mannose in the reaction with the inversion of anomeric configuration and could be classified as exo-alpha-mannanase. The enzyme revealed a high deglycosylating activity towards the short mannose-rich O-linked carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins.
