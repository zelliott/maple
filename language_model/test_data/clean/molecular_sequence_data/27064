Proteins of the TpsB/Omp85 superfamily are involved in protein transport across, or assembly into, the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, and their distant eukaryotic relatives exert similar functions in chloroplasts and mitochondria. The X-ray structure of one TpsB transporter, FhaC, provides the bases to decipher the mechanisms of action of these proteins. With two POTRA domains in the periplasm, a transmembrane beta barrel and a large loop harboring a functionally important motif, FhaC epitomizes the conserved features of the super-family.
