Six different domains of CAG repeats from a human chromosome 12-specific cosmid library were identified, cloned, and sequenced. These CAG repeat domains were localized into the human chromosomic region 12q24.1. Five of them constitute repeat candidates for expansions in autosomal dominant neurological disorders with genetic anticipation, and they can also contribute to the chromosome walking in the human genome project.
