The human nuclear 5'-(CGG)(n)-3'-binding protein (CGGBP1) influences the expression of the fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene by specifically interacting with the 5'-(CGG)(n>5)-3' repeat in its 5' untranslated region. Here, we show that CGGBP1 binds to 5'-(CGG)(n)-3' repeats with n>or=5 and to interrupted repeats. The genomic and mRNA organization of the human and murine CGGBP1 genes was studied and the human gene was mapped to chromosome 3p. Due to alternative polyadenylation, mRNAs of 1.2 and 4.5 kb are transcribed at varying ratios in human and murine cells and in embryonic, fetal, and adult tissues. The human and the murine genes, including promoters and large parts of the untranslated regions, are highly conserved. A sequence of 235 nucleotides 5' upstream of CGGBP1 is essential for promoter activity in transfection experiments. Complete in vitro methylation inactivates the promoter, which is unmethylated in human cells as shown by bisulfite genomic sequencing.
