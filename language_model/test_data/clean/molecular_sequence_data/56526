Clones of cDNA coding for the autoantigen La (or SS-B) were isolated from a library made from rat liver. A comparison of the rat La cDNA (encoding from nt 38 to 1281 for rat La protein) with the sequences known for human and bovine La protein resulted in the identification of species-specific inserts. The inserts seem to be the result of multiplication of flanking sequences during evolution. In addition to these variations, we observed that rat La cDNAs exhibit non-canonical polyadenylation sites. Finally, a databank search resulted in the identification of a DNA sequence originally termed as TAG or TSG20X (GenBank accession No. X61893) which represents the C terminus of mouse La/SS-B protein.
