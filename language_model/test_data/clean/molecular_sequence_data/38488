The Meloidogyne species are agriculturally important pests widespread in the world. These polyphagous endoparasitic nematodes possess an astonishing ability to bypass the plant resistance genes in few generations. However, the genes and mechanisms involved in this molecular determinism are not yet known. Except cytogenetic and cytotaxonomic studies, few data are available concerning their genome. There is therefore an important need of molecular tools for genetic investigation of their virulence character and other aspects of host-pathogen interactions. In that respect, the presence of mariner-like-elements (MLEs) was assessed in these endoparasitic nematodes by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using degenerate primers designed from two conserved regions of the mariner transposase open reading frame (ORF). Four Meloidogyne species of the five tested revealed the presence of MLEs in their genome. Southern blot analysis indicated that sequences hybridizing to the mariner transposase-like PCR clones occur at a moderate to low copy number in the different Meloidogyne spp. genomes. The phylogenetic analysis show that the Meloidogyne MLEs may form new subfamilies of mariner. Moreover, five PCR clones were shown to possess a continuous ORF suggesting the presence of putative transposase-like coding regions.
