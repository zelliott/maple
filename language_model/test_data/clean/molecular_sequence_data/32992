The human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, UGT1A9, catalyzes glucuronidation of various endobiotics and xenobiotics. In this study, we sequenced the promoter and exon 1 regions of the UGT1A9 gene in 93 Thai individuals and identified 7 genetic polymorphisms. The allele frequencies of all 3 novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): 454A>G and 455A>C (N152A) and 760C>T (R254X) were 0.005. The other 4 known polymorphisms, -688A>C, -440T>C, -331C>T and -118A(T)(10)AT (UGT1A9(*)1b), were identified and found to have frequencies of 0.124, 0.978, 0.968 and 0.532, respectively.
