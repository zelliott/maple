A case of amebic dysentery due to a natural infection of Entamoeba histolytica in the rhesus macaque (Macaca mullata) was reported. A fecal specimen was isolated and identified by the polymerase chain reaction technique. A daily dose of 750 mg of metronidazole was given orally for 10 days, and good results were observed. The early diagnosis of an E. histolytica infection allowed a proper antiamoebic treatment in an early stage of infection resulting in a successful outcome after therapy.
