1. We have purified a 58 kDa collagen-binding protein from a 4 M guanidine hydrochloride extract of porcine kidney. 2. This protein was identified as a mature form of 60 kDa heat-shock protein (HSP60, chaperonin homolog) based on its partial amino acid sequence. 3. Among 98 determined sequences of the porcine protein, 97 residues were identical with those deduced from nucleotide sequence of the cDNA encoding human HSP60.
