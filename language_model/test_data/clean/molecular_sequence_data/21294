Exploiting self-assembly systems with biological building blocks is of significant interest in the fabrication of advanced biomaterials. We assessed the potential use of site-specific ligand labeling of protein building blocks in designing functional protein self-assemblies by combining site-specifically biotinylated bacterial alkaline phosphatase (as a bidentate or tetradentate ligand unit) and streptavidin (as a tetrameric receptor).
