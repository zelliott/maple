Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of drinking water in the homes of 56 children suffering from rotaviral gastroenteritis has shown the presence of the rotavirus genome in four samples. These strains were different from human rotaviruses detected in the children's feces, as determined by sequencing of the VP7-amplified fragments-three of them of animal origin (porcine or bovine) and one of human origin.
