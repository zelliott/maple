We have shown in earlier studies, using a mouse model, that the expression of the glutathione peroxidase 5 protein (GPX5) is restricted to the epididymis and that the accumulation of its corresponding mRNA is hormonally, spatially and temporally regulated throughout postnatal development. We report here, using run-on assays, transient expression experiments as well as gel-shift and footprinting analyses on the findings that at least part of the androgenic control of the GPX5 expression is exerted at the transcriptional level via an androgen response element localized in the distal promoter region of the GPX5 gene. The gpx5 androgen response element (ARE) is found to be consistent with the consensus palindromic steroid-receptor target sequence 5'-AGWACWnnnTGTYCT-3' but exhibits a quite weak conservation in the left half site. The data presented here further expand the diversity of sequence able to confer androgen responsiveness.
