The pre-B cell receptor is a key checkpoint regulator in developing B cells. Early events that are controlled by the pre-B cell receptor include positive selection for cells express membrane immunoglobulin heavy chains and negative selection against cells expressing truncated immunoglobulins that lack a complete variable region (D mu). Positive selection is known to be mediated by membrane immunoglobulin heavy chains through Ig alpha-Ig beta, whereas the mechanism for counterselection against D mu has not been determined. We have examined the role of the Ig alpha-Ig beta signal transducers in counterselection against D mu using mice that lack Ig beta. We found that D mu expression is not selected against in developing B cells in Ig beta mutant mice. Thus, the molecular mechanism for counterselection against D mu in pre-B cells resembles positive selection in that it requires interaction between mD mu and Ig alpha-Ig beta.
