The effects of a membrane-permeable inhibitor of calpain, Cbz-Val-Phe-H, were examined in an in vitro model of neurotoxicity. Cerebellar slices from young rats were treated with the glutamate receptor agonist, amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoazole propionic acid (AMPA), and cytotoxicity was quantified using conventional histological techniques. Slices treated with AMPA exhibited damage to 83.0% of cerebellar Purkinje cells. In contrast, only 23.6% of Purkinje cells were damaged in slices treated with Cbz-Val-Phe-H and AMPA. These findings indicate that calcium-activated proteolysis is a critical event in AMPA-induced toxicity, and provide evidence that calpain inhibitors are capable of attenuating this form of excitotoxic damage in the central nervous system.
