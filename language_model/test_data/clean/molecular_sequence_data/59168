The association between HLA-B27 and spondylarthropathies is currently being reinvestigated in the light of HLA-B27 subtyping. At least 11 different subtypes have been described among which B*2703, B*2706, and B*2709 could be less closely associated with disease at the population level. Differences in the presentation of antigenic peptides by these subtypes could be related to differences in disease susceptibility. We focused our work on the comparison of B*2705 and B*2703 which differ at a single position at residue 59 in pocket A of the peptide binding groove. Endogenous peptides from the human C1R line transfected by B*2705 or B*2703 were acid-eluted and separated by HPLC. Major individual fractions were sequenced by Edman NH2-terminal degradation. Differences observed between B*2705 versus B*2703 individual ligands were confirmed in an in vitro stabilization assay with T2-B*2705 or B*2703 transfected cells in the presence of synthetic peptides. One B*2705 associated peptide is derived from the sequence 169-179 in the second extracellular domain of several HLA class I molecules including HLA-B27. This sequence (RRYLENGKETL) is highly homologous to a previously reported sequence (LRRYLENGK) sharing similarities with proteins from enteric bacteria. We show here that it is naturally presented as a major endogenous peptide by B*2705 and B*2702 disease-associated subtypes and not by B*2703.
