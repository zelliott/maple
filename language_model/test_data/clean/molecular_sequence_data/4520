The Ku70/80 complex, known as Ku, constitutes the DNA end binding component of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). We have characterized the promoter region of the mouse and human Ku80 genes to delineate transcriptional elements necessary for basal gene expression and proliferation-dependent regulation. Consensus Sp1 recognition elements were identified in both promoters, and were determined to be essential for basal expression. We further identified a near-perfect palindrome of 21 base pairs located immediately 5' to one Sp1 element. This sequence was present once within the mouse Ku80 promoter and seven times, in a head-to-tail tandem array, within the human Ku80 promoter. This sequence possessed homology with a methylation-sensitive promoter element, Enh2, present in the LTR of mouse intractisternal A-particles. Promoter deletion studies and expression analysis of in-vitro methylated reporter gene constructs provided strong evidence that, in vivo, this repeat sequence regulates Ku80 gene expression in cis, through a mechanism involving CpG methylation. Evidence is also presented, suggesting that Ku is directly involved in this regulatory process.
