A series of fluorescein phosphoramidites (FAM) have been synthesized for use on automated DNA synthesizers. After coupling of the FAM reagents to the 5' hydroxyl of the oligonucleotide on the DNA synthesizer, the excess reagent is removed by washing the solid support. The dye, and its linkage to the oligonucleotide, are stable during the conditions of DNA synthesis and cleavage/deprotection conditions. Purification is attained with the OPC (Oligonucleotide Purification Cartridge), a polystyrene based affinity matrix, which selectively retains hydrophobic oligonucleotide conjugates. Analysis by MicroGel capillary electrophoresis effectively separates fluorescent dye labelled oligonucleotides from unlabelled products.
