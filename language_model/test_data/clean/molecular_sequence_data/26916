Based on the inherent alpha-galactosidase activity, squid liver contains two different alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidases (alpha-GalNAcases): alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase I (alpha-GalNAcase I), which typically exhibits the alpha-galactosidase activity and alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase II (alpha-GalNAcase II), which is devoid of such activity. The molecular properties of the alpha-GalNAcases that may account for their enzymological differences are as yet unknown. In this study, we have characterized and compared the chemical and immunological properties of alpha-GalNAcase I and alpha-GalNAcase II. Analysis of the N-terminal sequence of the first twenty amino acids revealed the striking homology between alpha-GalNAcase I and alpha-GalNAcase II. Digestion of alpha-GalNAcase I and alpha-GalNAcase II generated the peptide maps that display similarities in peptide pattern, indicating their close relationship in structure. Polyclonal antibodies were generated in rabbits against the purified alpha-GalNAcase I and alpha-GalNAcase II for comparison of the immunological properties. Both Western blot and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies showed that the anti-alpha-GalNAcase II antibody reacted with both alpha-GalNAcase I and alpha-GalNAcase II, whereas the anti-alpha-GalNAcase I antibody reacted only with alpha-GalNAcase I, indicating the presence of common as well as unique antigenic determinants on alpha-GalNAcase I and alpha-GalNAcase II. Taken together, these results suggest that alpha-GalNAcase I and alpha-GalNAcase II are closely related with regard to structure and that their nonhomologous domains are possibly responsible for the differences in enzymatic properties.
