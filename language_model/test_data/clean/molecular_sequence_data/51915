A genetic locus implicated in the synthesis and secretion of alkaline protease (APR) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been previously described [Guzzo et al., J. Bacteriol. 172 (1990) 942-948]. The nucleotide sequence of the DNA fragment encoding these functions was determined and revealed the existence of five open reading frames: aprA, the structural gene encoding APR; aprI, which encodes a protease inhibitor; and aprD, aprE, aprF whose products are involved in protease secretion. The AprD, AprE and AprF proteins share significant homology with proteins implicated in secretion of Erwinia chrysanthemi proteases and Escherichia coli alpha-haemolysin. These results provide further evidence for the existence of a specialized secretory system widespread among Gram- bacteria.
