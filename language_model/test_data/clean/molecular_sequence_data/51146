A new approach for the analysis of hotspots of mutations is described. It is based on the classification of hotspot site sequences. Using this approach, the consensuses RGYW and TAA of hotspot sites were revealed in the V gene. Correlation between somatic mutations and these consensuses is investigated by the statistical weight method in 323 somatic substitutions in 14 V genes. Assuming the absence of any correlation, the probability of observing such data in the sample would be very low (0.0003). These results support the idea that emergence of somatic mutation is significantly influenced by neighbouring base sequences. This idea was also supported by the analysis of 296 somatic mutations in flanking sequences of V genes. It is supposed that this influence is an important feature of somatic hypermutagenesis.
