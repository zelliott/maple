The expression of the beta-like globin genes is intricately regulated by a series of both general and tissue-restricted transcription factors. The hemapoietic lineage-specific transcription factor GATA-1 is important for erythroid differentiation and has been implicated in regulating the expression of the erythroid-specific genes including the genes of the beta-globin locus. In the human erythroleukemic K562 cell line, only one DNA region has been identified previously as a putative site of GATA-1 interaction by in vivo footprinting studies. We mapped GATA-1 binding throughout the beta-globin locus by using chIp-chip analysis of K562 cells. We found that GATA-1 binds in a region encompassing the HS2 core element, as was previously identified, and an additional region of GATA-1 binding upstream of the gammaG gene. This approach will be of general utility for mapping transcription factor binding sites within the beta-globin locus and throughout the genome.
