Tripeptide aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.4) was purified from bovine dental follicles by a series of chromatographies. Purified enzyme had a specific activity of 59.5 units per mg protein with L-prolyl-glycylglycine as substrate. The pH optimum was 8.0. The purified native enzyme had a Mr of 230,000 and was shown to be a tetramer of subunit Mr of 58,000. The isoelectric point was pH 7.0. The enzyme was inhibited by 5-5'-dithio-bis (2-nitrobenzoic acid), o-phenanthroline, and bestatin. Substrate specificity studies indicated that the enzyme specifically hydrolyzes the N-terminal amino acid residue from tripeptides only.
