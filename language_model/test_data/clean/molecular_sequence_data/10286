Exon trapping from cosmids mapping to chromosome 19q13.3 yielded 6 exonic sequences that matched the human symplekin gene, which encodes a tight junction-related protein. One exonic sequence identified a 4.0 kb brain cDNA clone, R6E1, which contained 302 bp 5' to the originally reported 3.7 kb symplekin cDNA. A portion of this novel 5' sequence matched an additional trapped exonic sequence which was obtained from the most telomeric cosmid analyzed. The symplekin gene thus lies in a telomeric-to-centromeric direction on 19q13.3. Only three cosmids from a large 19q13.3 contig hybridized with R6E1, thereby assigning the symplekin gene to a 40 kb region immediately telomeric to gene 59 and the DM protein kinase gene. The 5' end of the R6E1 clone has a potential initiation codon with a strong Kozak sequence and Northern blot analysis detected a 4.2 kb signal in most human tissues, indicating that R6E1 may be a complete cDNA sequence. Based on the trapped exonic sequences, twelve exon-intron boundaries were predicted.
