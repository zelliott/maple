A beta-lactam-resistant Bacteroides uniformis strain was isolated from a clinical specimen. The strain produced large amounts of beta-lactamase and was resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. The specific activity of the unpurified beta-lactamase was 4.8 U/mg of protein with nitrocefin as the substrate. The enzyme was purified 188-fold by Q-Sepharose, Sephacryl S-300, and Mono Q column passages. Kinetic parameters of the enzyme were determined by a micromethod performed in microtiter plates. beta-Lactamase was inhibited by cefoxitin and imipenem and hydrolyzed cephalosporins more rapidly than penicillins. The molecular weight was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gradient gel electrophoresis to be 32,500, and the isoelectric point was 4.5.
