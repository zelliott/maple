Genes encoding the Leu (GAG), Ser (UGA), Gln (UUG) and Lys (UUU) tRNAs have been cloned and sequenced from the deep sea hyperthermophilic Archaeon, Methanopyrus kandleri. Sequences conforming to the TATA box element established for methanogen promoters are located upstream of the tRNA(Gln) and tRNA(Lys) genes. All four of the tRNA genes appear to encode the 3' terminal CCA residues of the mature tRNA. These methanogen tRNAs are predicted to contain most, but not all, invariant residues and are characterized by a high level of G + C base pairing, consistent with the 98 degrees C optimum growth temperature of M. kandleri.
