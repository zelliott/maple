A 0.4-kb ScaI-HpaI fragment, 199 bp upstream of the structural gene for alkaline endoglucanase, from the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. KSM-64, was found to be essential for the extracellular production of the enzyme by recombinant Bacillus subtilis cells. We constructed a new vector, pHSP64 (5.5 kb), using pHY300PLK and part of the 5' region of the endoglucanase that contained a possible promoter region. Using recombinant B. subtilis cells that carried this vector, very high production of two endoglucanases and of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase was done.
