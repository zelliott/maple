A lambda gt11 cDNA library was constructed from RNA purified from hepatitis B viral surface antigen-negative human plasma with high alanine aminotransferase activity. A cDNA clone, designated as C8-2, was isolated by immunoscreening with mixed sera from non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) carrier and convalescent chimpanzees. The recombinant protein produced by C8-2 reacted specifically with sera of patients in the chronic phase of NANBH. The sequence of C8-2, 269 bp, did not hybridized with any human or chimpanzee genomic DNA, and had no homology with those of primates and viruses. The existence of this sequence in RNA of possibly infectious plasma was shown by RNA blot hybridization and by Southern blot analysis of products amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. These results strongly suggest that C8-2 is derived from the agent of this viral hepatitis.
