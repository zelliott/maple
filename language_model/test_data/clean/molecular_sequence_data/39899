Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a novel DNA amplification method that amplifies a target sequence specifically under isothermal conditions. The objective of this study was to identify a Y chromosome-specific sequence in water buffalo and to establish an efficient procedure for embryo sexing by LAMP. The homologues of a Y chromosome-specific sequence, bovine repeat Y-associated.2, in swamp and river buffalo were cloned, and designated swamp buffalo repeat Y-associated.2 and river buffalo repeat Y-associated.2, respectively. Sexing by LAMP was performed using primers for swamp buffalo repeat Y-associated.2. A 12S rRNA was also amplified by LAMP as a control reaction in both male and female. The minimal amount of the template DNA required for LAMP appeared to be 0.1-10 pg. The sensitivity was further examined using swamp buffalo fibroblasts as templates. When fibroblasts were lysed with NaOH, the minimal cell number required for detection of both male-specific and male-female common DNA appeared to be two cells, whereas correct determination of sex could not be achieved using fibroblasts lysed by heat denaturation. Embryo sexing was also performed using blastomeres from interspecies nuclear transfer embryos. The sex determined by LAMP for blastomeres corresponded with the sex of nuclear donor cells in analyses using four or five blastomeres as templates. The LAMP reaction required only about 45 min, and the total time for embryo sexing, including DNA extraction, was about 1 h. In conclusion, the present procedure without thermal cycling and electrophoresis was reliable and applicable for water buffalo embryos.
