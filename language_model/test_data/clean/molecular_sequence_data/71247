The genomic organization of the heparin cofactor II (HCII) gene from rat and mouse was investigated and compared with their human counterpart. The genes share a common core structure consisting of five exons interrupted by four introns, but the mouse and rat gene reveal individual additional features. A unique differentially spliced exon is present in the 5'-untranslated region of the rat gene, which most probably has arisen de novo by point mutations in intronic sequences of the ancestor gene. In the mouse HCII gene, a novel intron/exon boundary has been created due to the presence of an additional DNA segment, which simultaneously provides a 3'-splice site and a polypyrimidine stretch leading to an alternatively used exon of increased size. Our data suggest that, in contrast to most other mammalian genes, the exon/intron pattern of the gene coding for HCII is in dynamic evolution.
