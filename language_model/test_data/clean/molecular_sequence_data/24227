Natural killer (NK) cell recognition and function in humans is regulated by multiple cell surface receptors. The "on" signal leading to NK cell triggering is primarily mediated by natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCR). Analysis of NK cells in primate animal models is of particular relevance because NK cells may play an essential role in host defenses against infections. We analyzed Macaca fascicularis PBMC and in vitro-derived NK cell populations and clones by cytofluorometry, using a wide panel of mAb, and by cytolytic activity assays. In addition, RT-PCR strategy and transient transfections were used to isolate M. fascicularis NCR. NCR-specific mAb reactivity (anti-NKp46 and anti-NKp30) was present on M. fascicularis PBMC and on NK cell cultures. Macaque NCR were functional in both redirected killing and in mAb-mediated masking assays. Cloning of macNKp46 and macNKp30 NCR homologous genes showed a high sequence similarity (86 % and 88 %, respectively) with their human counterparts. Attempts at identifying NKp44 surface reactivity and at cloning the macaque homologue were unsuccessful. NKp46 and NKp30 NCRs, but not NKp44, are highly conserved in M. fascicularis NK cells. This suggests the possibility of a staged appearance of the NCR during phylogenesis and provides a useful tool for the study of natural immunity correlates of protection in primate SIV/SHIV infection models.
