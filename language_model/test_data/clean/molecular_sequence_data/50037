The binding activity of a novel regucalcin gene promoter region-related protein (RGPR-p117) to the TTGGC sequence of the rat regucalcin gene promoter region was investigated. The expression of RGPR-p117 mRNA was seen in the liver tissues of male and female rats. The sexual difference of this expression was not found. Liver RGPR-p117 mRNA expression was not changed with increasing age (1-50 weeks old), and its expression was not altered by fasting or refeeding. Nuclear factor I-A1 (NF1-A1) has been identified to be a transcription factor in stimulating the rat regucalcin gene promoter activity (Misawa and Yamaguchi [2002a] J Cell Biochem 84:795-802]. Recombinant nuclear factor I-A1 (NF1-A1) and RGPR-p117 proteins were used gel mobility shift assay. RGPR-p117 could not bind to TTGGC motif of the sequence between -525 and -504, which has been defined as a functional promoter element II-b. NF1-A1 was specifically bound to the II-b oligonucleotide. Moreover, RGPR-p117 was not bound to the II-b oligonucleotide in the presence of NF1-A1 or rat liver nuclear protein. The binding of NF1-A1 to the II-b oligonucleotide was not altered in the presence of RGPR-p117. This study demonstrates that RGPR-p117 mRNA, is expressed stably for physiologic change in rat liver, and that recombinant the protein does not directly bind to the TTGGC motif in rat regucalcin gene promoter.
