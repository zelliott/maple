Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) from the Circoviridae family has recently been associated with two serious diseases of swine, post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) and porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS). During 2002, several outbreaks of clinical disease in pigs with weights ranging from 10 to 70 kg occurred on four farms in different locations in Croatia. The signs were consistent with PMWS and PDNS. Apart from progressive weight loss, pneumonia and/or diarrhoea, multifocal erythematous skin lesions and dermal necrosis were also observed. The PCR results obtained from PCV2 specific oligonucleotide primers confirmed a PCV2 infection. In addition, archive samples that were classical swine fever virus positive and derived from domestic pigs during an outbreak in 1997 were included in this study and one out of the three isolates was found to be positive for PCV2. For a better epizootiological understanding, genetic typing of representative isolates was carried out and compared with available isolates reported in the GenBank databases.
