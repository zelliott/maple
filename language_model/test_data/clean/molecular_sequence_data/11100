In this study, alterations in gene expression patterns have been examined in v-Rel-transformed avian bone marrow cells. Using a conditional v-Rel estrogen receptor chimera (v-RelER) which transforms cells in an estrogen-dependent manner, we constructed subtraction cDNA libraries from v-RelER-transformed bone marrow cells. Several different sequences were identified whose expression was altered upon hormone activation of v-RelER. These include two genes related to the MIP-1 chemokine family (mip-1beta and a tca3 homologue), a cell surface antigen sca-2 and the transcription factor nfkb1. The expression of each gene was assayed in a number of wild-type and mutant v-Rel-expressing fibroblast and hematopoietic cells. All v-Rel-transformed hematopoietic cells tested express high levels of nfkb1 and sca-2. In fibroblasts, wild-type v-Rel induced expression of mip-1beta and nfkb1, while nontransforming mutants of v-Rel failed to do so, suggesting a role for these two genes in v-Rel mediated transformation. Finally, these genes are expressed at high levels in cells overexpressing wild-type and truncated forms of c-Rel, implying that v-Rel transforms, in part, by induction of c-Rel target genes.
