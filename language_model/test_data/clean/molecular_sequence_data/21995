Mitochondria are indispensable for cell viability; however, major mitochondrial functions including citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation are dispensable. Most known essential mitochondrial proteins are involved in preprotein import and assembly, while the only known essential biosynthetic process performed by mitochondria is the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters (ISC). The components of the mitochondrial ISC-assembly machinery are derived from the prokaryotic ISC-assembly machinery. We have identified an essential mitochondrial matrix protein, Isd11 (YER048w-a), that is found in eukaryotes only. Isd11 is required for biogenesis of cellular Fe/S proteins and thus is a novel subunit of the mitochondrial ISC-assembly machinery. It forms a complex with the cysteine desulfurase Nfs1 and is required for formation of an Fe/S cluster on the Isu scaffold proteins. We conclude that Isd11 is an indispensable eukaryotic component of the mitochondrial machinery for biogenesis of Fe/S proteins.
