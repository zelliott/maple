We have characterized a new tomato cDNA, TAS14, inducible by salt stress and abscisic acid (ABA). Its nucleotide sequence predicts an open reading frame coding for a highly hydrophilic and glycine-rich (23.8%) protein of 130 amino acids. Southern blot analysis of tomato DNA suggests that there is one TAS14 structural gene per haploid genome. TAS14 mRNA accumulates in tomato seedlings upon treatment with NaCl, ABA or mannitol. It is also induced in roots, stems and leaves of hydroponically grown tomato plants treated with NaCl or ABA. TAS14 mRNA is not induced by other stress conditions such as cold and wounding. The sequence of the predicted TAS14 protein shows four structural domains similar to the rice RAB21, cotton LEA D11 and barley and maize dehydrin genes.
