It has previously been reported that multiple copies of the hph gene integrated into the genome of Neurospora crassa are methylated at Hpa II sites (CCGG) during the vegetative life cycle of the fungus, while hph genes integrated as single copies are not methylated. Furthermore, methylation is correlated with silencing of the gene. We report here the methylation state of cytosine residues of the major part of the promoter region of the hph gene integrated into the genome of the multiple copy strain HTA5.7 during the vegetative stage of the life cycle. Cytosine methylation is sequence dependent, but the sequence specificity is complex and is different from the sequence specificity known for mammals and plants (CpG and CpNpG). The pattern of DNA methylation reported here is very different from that measured after meiosis in Neurospora or in Ascobulus . After the sexual cycle in those two fungi all the cytosines of multiple stretches of DNA are heavily methylated. This indicates that the still unknown methyltransferase in Neurospora has a different specificity in the sexual and the vegetative stages of the life cycle or that there are different methyltransferases. The pattern of methylation reported here is also different from the pattern of cytosine methylation of transgenes of Petunia , the only pattern published until now in plants that has DNA methylation at cytosines which are not in the canonical sequences CpG and CpNpG.
