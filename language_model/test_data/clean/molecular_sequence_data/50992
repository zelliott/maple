Disintegrins are soluble integrin ligands from snake venoms that disrupt cell-matrix interactions. Recently, the nuclear magnetic resonance structures of two disintegrins were determined, providing provocative molecular insight into how a disintegrin may engage an integrin. In addition, it has recently been realized that disintegrins are derived from larger multifunctional proteins, and that there is a family of membrane-anchored, disintegrin domain-containing proteins that may promote important cell-cell interactions.
