The pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is unknown. One of the most frequent cytogenetic abnormalities in CLL is a deletion within the long arm of chromosome 13, the region to which the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene has been mapped. Lack of Rb expression has been linked to the carcinogenic process in many human tumours. We therefore sought to investigate the role of Rb gene inactivation in CLL using differential polymerase chain reaction on reverse transcribed RNA. The result of the PCR was quantitated using HPLC. 5/39 patients revealed a lack or significantly impaired expression of the Rb gene upon differential PCR analysis. In addition, immunocytochemical studies were performed using the Rb-specific monoclonal antibody PMG245. 10/56 patients showed a weak or absent expression upon immunocytochemical analysis compared to monocytes or granulocytes. The samples lacking Rb were from both early and late stage CLL. Our results indicate that inactivation of the Rb protein occurs in a fraction of CLL cases and can be found in early and late stages of the disease.
