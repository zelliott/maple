Two polymorphisms were detected within exon I of the alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) gene both of which create restriction endonuclease sites and one of which changes an amino acid. The polymorphisms may be detected by digesting the same 245-bp polymerase chain reaction product. The polymorphisms can be used diagnostically in families with IDUA deficiency (mucopolysaccharidosis type I) and Huntington disease, which is closely linked to the IDUA locus.
