The myelin-associated protein Nogo-A has received more research attention than any other inhibitor of axonal regeneration in the injured central nervous system (CNS). Circumvention of its inhibitory effect, by using antibodies specific to Nogo-A, has been shown to promote axonal regrowth. Studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that active or passive immunization of CNS-injured rats or mice with myelin-associated peptides induces a T-cell-mediated protective autoimmune response, which promotes recovery by reducing posttraumatic degeneration. Here, we show that neuronal degeneration after incomplete spinal-cord contusion in rats was substantially reduced, and hence recovery was significantly promoted, by posttraumatic immunization with p472, a peptide derived from Nogo-A. The observed effect seemed to be mediated by T cells and could be reproduced by passive transfer of a T cell line directed against the Nogo-A peptide. Thus, it seems that after incomplete spinal-cord injury, immunization with a variety of myelin-associated peptides, including those derived from Nogo-A, can be used to evoke a T cell-mediated response that promotes recovery. The choice of peptide(s) for clinical treatment of spinal-cord injuries should be based on safety considerations; in particular, the likelihood that the chosen peptide will not cause an autoimmune disease or interfere with essential functions of this peptide or other proteins. From a therapeutic point of view, the fact that the active cellular agents are T cells rather than antibodies is an advantage, as T cell production commences within the time window required for a protective effect after spinal-cord injury, whereas antibody production takes longer.
