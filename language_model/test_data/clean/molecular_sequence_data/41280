Sphingomonas sp. strain ATCC 31555 can produce an anionic heteropolysaccharide, welan gum, which shows excellent stability and viscosity retention even at high temperatures. Here we present a 4.0-Mb assembly of its genome sequence. We have annotated 10 coding sequences (CDSs) responsible for the welan gum biosynthesis and 55 CDSs related to monosaccharide metabolism.
