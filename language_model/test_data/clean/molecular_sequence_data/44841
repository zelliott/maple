In this report, we report the first expression of human vitamin D-binding protein (hDBP), a serum protein with several functions and a multidomained structure, in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein (reDBP) was expressed as a fusion partner of glutathione S-transferase in order to facilitate proper folding of the reDBP; E. coli-expressed DBP was found to be fully functional with respect to vitamin D sterol binding, interaction with actin, and cross-reactivity with anti-DBP antibody. Furthermore, both natural DBP and reDBP were affinity-labeled with 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-3-bromo[1-14C]acetate in a similar fashion. Availability of an expression system for hDBP in functional form provides opportunity to develop mutants and truncated DBPs to study multiple ligand-binding properties of this protein in relationship with its structure.
