Nematodes include both free-living species such as Caenorhabditis elegans and major parasites of humans, livestock and plants. The apparent simplicity and uniformity of their nervous system belies a rich diversity of putative signalling molecules, particularly neuropeptides. This new appreciation stems largely from the genome-sequencing project with C. elegans, which is due to be completed by the end of 1998. The project has provided additional insights into other aspects of nematode neurobiology, as have studies on the mechanism of action of anthelmintics. Here, progress on the identification, localization, synthesis and physiological actions of transmitters identified in nematodes is explored.
