The Saccharomyces cerevisiae LYS7 gene has been cloned based on its genetic map position and complementation of a lys7 mutant. The 1453-bp sequence contains an open reading frame (ORF) that predicts a unique 249 amino acid (aa) protein. A Northern blot experiment demonstrated that LYS7 transcription was not regulated by lysine-specific or general aa control mechanisms. To investigate the effects of total loss of LYS7 function, we created a complete deletion of the gene and introduced this allele into wild-type yeast. The lys7 delta mutant requires lysine and simultaneously displays an array of phenotypes that include pH and temperature sensitivity. The pleiotropic phenotypes of the lys7 delta mutant and the constitutive transcription pattern are at odds with the hypothesis that Lys7p functions solely in the lysine biosynthesis pathway.
