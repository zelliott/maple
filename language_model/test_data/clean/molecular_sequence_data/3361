The cDNA encoding the Schistosoma mansoni dolichol phosphate mannose synthase was completely sequenced, displaying the highest homology with Cricetulus griseus and Saccharomyces pombe genes. The Schistosome enzyme had a K(m) of 0.127 microM, a value that is within the range of those reported for several other species. Thin-layer chromatography of the radiolabelled schistosome lipid intermediate showed it was identical to dolichol-phosphate (C80-C105). Expression of dolichol phosphate mannose synthase of S. mansoni (SmDPMS) was analysed by Northern blot and quantified by semi-quantitative RT-PCR with cDNA from mature and immature male and female worms. Northern blot analysis revealed a single 1-kb band. Both approaches confirmed a higher level of expression in mature female worms, as compared to immature and male worms.
