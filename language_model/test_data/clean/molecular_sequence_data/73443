The proviral DNA of the simian T-leukemia/lymphotropic virus (STLV) isolate, originally obtained from a captive colony of pygmy chimpanzees (Pan paniscus) (STLV(pan-p)), was cloned from the DNA of the chronically infected human T-cell line L93-79B. The entire proviral DNA sequence was obtained and compared with sequences of the known genotypes of STLV and human T-leukemia/lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1 and -2). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that STLV-2(pan-p) is an early divergence within the type 2 lineage and should be referred to as STLV-2(pan-p). Since STLV-2(pan-p) has been found in African nonhuman primates, we investigated its infectiousness and pathogenicity in Asian monkeys. Pigtailed macaques were inoculated with human cells harboring STLV(pan-p), and infection was assessed by virus isolation, PCR analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and seroconversion against viral antigens in HTLV-1/HTLV-2 and Western blot assay. Pigtailed macaques became persistently infected by STLV-2(pan-p), and the virus could be transferred by blood transfusion from an infected pigtailed macaque to a rhesus macaque. In addition, like HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, STLV-2(pan-p) was infectious in rabbits. In summary, STLV-2(pan-p) is a novel retrovirus distantly related to HTLV-2 and displays a host range similar to that demonstrated for other HTLV and STLV strains.
