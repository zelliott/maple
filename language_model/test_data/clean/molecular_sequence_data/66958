The obvious difference in muscle growth and meat quality traits exists between Chinese indigenous pig and exotic pigs. In order to study the reason of these phenotypic differences and search the potential gene related to growth and meat quality traits, silver-stained mRNA differential display technique was used to detect the difference with mRNA of loin-eye muscle tissue from maturity pigs of Lantang in Guangdong Province and Large Yorkshire. One of the newly discovered expressed sequence tag (ESTsp3) was analyzed by using bioinformatic technique. The results showed: (1) nearly 2000 cDNA fragments were detected with 30 primer pairs, and 6 differentially expressed ESTs in the loin-eye muscle tissues from the two breeds were isolated and obtained. The differential fragments were cloned and sequenced. The all sequences were recorded in the GenBank. (2) The 786 bp fragment of ESTsp3 was obtained with in silico elongation system, the ORF analysis revealed that it existed as an 83 aa complete open reading frame, and the elongation sequences were verified by RT-PCR. The analysis of in silico expression profile showed that ESTsp3 is expressed in various growth stages and in most tissues and organs, such as soft tissue, skin, skeletal muscle and kidney, but with variant expression quantity.
