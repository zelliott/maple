We isolated the novel cDNA gob-4, which was shown to be expressed in intestinal goblet cells. The deduced amino acid sequence is similar to the gene coding for the Xenopus laevis cement gland-specific XAG-2. These sequence and expression data suggest this gene may be involved in the secretory function.
