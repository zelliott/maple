We have found that under appropriate conditions, an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can achieve a sensitivity suitable for measuring specific, infrequent mutations in single cell systems or in animal tissues. Using the 12th codon GC-to-AT mutation in the rat c-Ha-ras gene as a model system, we have defined conditions that allow for measurement of mutations present at frequencies as low as one in 10(5) gene copies. Our approach involved the use of PCR primers that created a single mismatch with the mutated allele (GAA) but created a double mismatch with the wild-type allele (GGA). Five out of the six such double-mismatch primers we tested permitted amplification of the mutant allele (GAA) with a high degree of specificity. The specificity of the assay was further enhanced by using a two-step PCR cycle consisting of a denaturation step (1 min incubation at 94 degrees C) and an annealing/extension step (1 min incubation at 50 degrees C) in the presence of 10% (vol/vol) glycerol. Reconstruction experiments using genomic DNA demonstrate that this procedure cna measure the presence of 30 copies of the transforming ras allele present amongst 3 x 10(6) copies of the wild-type allele.
