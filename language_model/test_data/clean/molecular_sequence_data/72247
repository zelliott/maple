Satellite RNA of bamboo mosaic potexvirus (satBaMV) is a linear RNA molecule which encodes a 20-kDa nonstructural protein. Sequences of seven different satBaMV isolates from bamboo hosts in three genera showed 0.7% to 7.5% base variation which spanned the whole RNA molecule. However, the putative 20-kDa open reading frame was all preserved in these isolates. The phylogenetic relationship based on the nucleotide sequence did not show particular grouping of satBaMV from the host in one genus; neither was the grouping of satBaMV evident by location of sampling. Putative secondary structures of the 3' untranslated regions showed a basic pattern with conserved hexanucleotides (ACCUAA) and polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) located in the loop regions. Although the satBaMV-encoded 20-kDa protein is a nonstructural protein, its predicted secondary structure contains eight-stranded beta-sheets which may form "jelly-roll" structure similar to that found in capsid protein encoded by satellite virus of panicum mosaic virus.
