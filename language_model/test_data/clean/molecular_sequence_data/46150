The dopamine D3 receptor has been implicated as a potential target for drug development in various complex psychiatric disorders including psychosis, drug dependence, and Parkinson's disease. In our overall goal to develop molecules with preferential affinity at D3 receptors, we undertook a hybrid drug development approach by combining a known dopamine agonist moiety with a substituted piperazine fragment. In the present study, three compounds produced this way with preferential D3 agonist activity, were tested at D3 receptors with mutations in the agonist binding pocket of three residues known to be important for agonist binding activity. At S192A and T369V, the hybrid agonist compounds produced an interaction profile in [(3)H]spiperone binding assays similar to that of the parent 5-OH-DPAT and 7-OH-DPAT molecules. The loss of affinity at the S192A mutant was most prominent for 5-OH-DPAT and its corresponding hybrid compound D237. D110N did not show any radioligand binding. Homology modeling indicated that 7-OH-DPAT-derived D315 uniquely shares H-bonding with Tyr365 which produced favorable interaction and no loss of H-bonding in the S192A mutant, suggesting that agonist activity may not be solely controlled by residues in the binding pocket.
