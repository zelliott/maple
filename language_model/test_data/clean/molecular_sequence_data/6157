A human case of infection by Trichinella pseudospiralis has recently been described. Some morphologic anomalies of the muscle larvae, however, raise the possibility of an incorrect taxonomic attribution. A molecular taxonomic approach has therefore been applied for the identification of the parasite. Random amplified polymorphic DNAs were obtained from a single larva extracted from a muscle biopsy of the suspected case of T. pseudospiralis infection, and compared with those derived from 27 reference strains of Trichinella spp. Nearly identical amplification patterns were obtained from the suspected larva and from reference strains of T. pseudospiralis, thus supporting the original morphology-based identification. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blots carried out on pretreatment and post-treatment sera provided further confirmation.
