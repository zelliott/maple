The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is used as a model for many human diseases, yet comparatively little is known of its genetics, particularly at important loci such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This study investigated genetic diversity and evolutionary history of the DQA gene in a range of leporid species by analysing coding sequence diversity of exon 2 and intron 2 in 53 individuals of 16 different species. Fifty leporid DQA alleles were detected, including 13 novel European rabbit alleles. In the rabbit, the highest levels of diversity were observed in wild rabbits from Portugal, with wild rabbits from England and domestic rabbits showing less diversity. Within the sample, several recombination events were detected and trans-specific evolution of alleles was evidenced, both being general characteristics of mammalian MHC genes. Positive selection is implicated as operating on six codons within exon 2, which are also subject to positive selection in other mammals. Some of these positions are putative antigen recognition sites and underline the importance of pathogen-driven selection on these MHC genes.
