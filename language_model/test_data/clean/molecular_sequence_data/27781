Using the vector pGEM-4-blue, a 4,251-base-pair DNA fragment containing the gene for the surface (S)-layer protein of Bacillus sphaericus 2362 was cloned into Escherichia coli. Determination of the nucleotide sequence indicated an open reading frame (ORF) coding for a protein of 1,176 amino acids with a molecular size of 125 kilodaltons (kDa). A protein of this size which reacted with antibody to the 122-kDa S-layer protein of B. sphaericus was detected in cells of E. coli containing the recombinant plasmid. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence indicated a highly hydrophobic N-terminal region which had the characteristics of a leader peptide. The first amino acid of the N-terminal sequence of the 122-kDa S-layer protein followed the predicted cleavage site of the leader peptide in the 125-kDa protein. A sequence characteristic of promoters expressed during vegetative growth was found within a 177-base-pair region upstream from the ORF coding for the 125-kDa protein. This putative promoter may account for the expression of this gene during the vegetative growth of B. sphaericus and E. coli. The gene for the 125-kDa protein was followed by an inverted repeat characteristic of terminators. Downstream from this gene (11.2 kilobases) was an ORF coding for a putative 80-kDa protein having a high sequence similarity to the 125-kDa protein. Evidence was presented indicating that this gene is cryptic.
