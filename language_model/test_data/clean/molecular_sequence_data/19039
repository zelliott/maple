A group of four strains isolated from clams (Venerupis decussata and Venerupis philippinarum) in Galicia (NW Spain) were subjected to a polyphasic characterization, based on the phenotypic characteristics, the analysis of chemotaxonomic features, the sequencing of the 16S rRNA and five housekeeping (atpA, pyrH, recA, rpoA and rpoD) genes, as well as DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH). The analysis of the phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics and the results of a phylogenetic study, based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and multilocus sequence analysis, clearly indicated that these strains belong to the genus Vibrio and were allocated between the Splendidus and Anguillarum clades showing a close relationship with the type strains of Vibrio tapetis (98.8 %), Vibrio pomeroyi (98.0 %) and Vibrio crassostreae (97.9 %). DNA-DNA hybridization results confirmed that these isolates constitute a new species. The name Vibrio cortegadensis sp. nov. is proposed with C 16.17(T) (=CECT 7227(T)=LMG 27474(T)) as the type strain.
