We used the Xenopus oocyte expression system to examine the regulation of rat kappa opioid receptor (rKOR) function by G protein receptor kinases (GRKs). kappa agonists increased the conductance of G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channels in oocytes co-expressing KOR with Kir3.1 and Kir3.4. In the absence of added GRK and beta-arrestin 2, desensitization of the kappa agonist-induced potassium current was modest. Co-expression of either GRK3 or GRK5 along with beta-arrestin 2 significantly increased the rate of desensitization, whereas addition of either beta-arrestin 2, GRK3, or GRK5 alone had no effect on the KOR desensitization rate. The desensitization was homologous as co-expressed delta opioid receptor-evoked responses were not affected by KOR desensitization. The rate of GRK3/beta-arrestin 2-dependent desensitization was reduced by truncation of the C-terminal 26 amino acids, KOR(Q355Delta). In contrast, substitution of Ala for Ser within the third intracellular loop [KOR(S255A,S260A, S262A)] did not reduce the desensitization rate. Within the C-terminal region, KOR(S369A) substitution significantly attenuated desensitization, whereas the KOR(T363A) and KOR(S356A,T357A) point mutations did not. These results suggest that co-expression of GRK3 or GRK5 and beta-arrestin 2 produced homologous, agonist-induced desensitization of the kappa opioid receptor by a mechanism requiring the phosphorylation of the serine 369 of rKOR.
