In mosquitoes, including Culex quinquefasciatus, immune molecules are known to be upregulated or produced de novo upon exposure to parasites or pathogens. These molecules are regulatory in nature acting against parasite or pathogen infection and development. Similarly, there are molecules that are upregulated to facilitate parasite development in the vector mosquitoes. Lipophorin, a major lipid transporting lipoprotein in the hemolymph of insects, is implicated as a helper molecule in the clotting mechanism and facilitator of parasite and pathogen development in mosquitoes. In the present study, upregulation of a 240 kDa protein was detected in C. quinquefasciatus infected with the human lymphatic filarial parasite, Wuchereria bancrofti. It was identified as a lipophorin through nano-Lc-MS/MS analysis. Transcription of the lipophorin receptor gene also was identified through RACE-PCR. C. quinquefasciatus is the vector of W. bancrofti, and it allows successful development of the parasite. The role of upregulated lipophorin and transcription of its receptor gene in this mosquito could be implicated as a facilitator for the parasite development.
