Mimosine is a toxin present in the tree-legume leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), including its root nodules and the root exudates. The leucaena-nodulating Rhizobium sp. strain TAL1145 degrades mimosine (Mid(+)) and utilizes it as a source of carbon and nitrogen. Twelve TAL1145 mutants defective in mimosine degradation (Mid(-)) were made through Tn3Hogus, TnphoA or kanamycin-resistance-cassette insertions. A 5.0 kb PstI fragment of TAL1145, subcloned from a cosmid clone containing mid genes for mimosine degradation, complemented most of the Mid(-) mutants. Sequencing this fragment and the adjacent 0.9 kb PstI fragment identified five genes, midA, midB, midC, midD and midR, of which the first three genes encode ABC transporter proteins involved in mimosine uptake, while midD encodes an aminotransferase required for degrading mimosine into 3-hydroxy-4-pyridone, and midR is a regulatory gene encoding a LysR-type transcriptional activator. The location of MidA in the periplasm was shown by making two midA : : phoA fusions, which made active alkaline phosphatase in the periplasm. The various mid : : gus and midA : : phoA fusions were inducible by mimosine, and a midD : : gus fusion mutant showed beta-glucuronidase activity in the leucaena nodules, indicating that midD is expressed in the nodules. Similarly, a midA : : phoA fusion expressed alkaline phosphatase activity in the leucaena nodules, indicating that mimosine induces midA transcription in the bacteroids. mid genes are specific for the Mid(+) strains of leucaena Rhizobium and are absent in strains of other Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium and Bradyrhizobium spp.
