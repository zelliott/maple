The DNA-binding preferences of two oligopeptide amides, (His-Pro-Arg-Lys)(3)NH(2) (HR-12) and (Ser-Pro-Arg-Lys)(3)NH(2) (SP-12), have been examined by quantitative DNase I footprinting studies. Two different DNA fragments were investigated: a pair of 5'-(32)P-labeled duplexes from pBR322 with one or other of the complementary strands labeled and a corresponding pair of 5'-(32)P-labeled duplexes representing fragments of the latent membrane protein (LMP-1) gene from a pathogenic Epstein-Barr virus variant derived from nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The major objective was to examine molecular recognition and cooperative features associated with sequence-selective binding of synthetic peptides to the LMP-1 fragments. At various binding sites on the pBR322 fragments, Hill coefficients (n(H)) ranging from 1.9-2.2 were observed; these results indicate modest positive cooperativity between binding sites for both peptides. By contrast, unusually high values of n(H), ranging from 4.0-9.3, were observed at various binding sites on the LMP-1 fragments. Allosteric models can be constructed to interpret the observed cooperative interactions between different DNA recognition sites in the LMP-1 gene upon binding of the peptide ligands. It is noteworthy that these models feature a novel network of cooperativity interconnecting multiple DNA allosteric sites. The evidence of sequence selectivity and strong cooperativity discovered in this work may prove to be a general feature of peptide interactions with some nucleic acids.
