The Sm core proteins of U1, U2, U4/U6 and U5 snRNPs include B(B1), B'(B2), N(B3), D1, D2, D3, E, F and G polypeptides. We have isolated genomic clones encoding the Sm-D1 protein using the Sm-D1 cDNA as probe. Southern blotting and DNA sequencing analysis of these clones revealed the presence of an Sm-D1 multigene family in the human genome. Three gene members have been identified. Two of the genes are without introns and contain mutations compared to the cDNA sequence. They appear to be processed pseudogenes. The third gene, termed SNRPD1, shares 100% identity to the cDNA sequence including both 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTR); it contains three introns. Analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the SNRPD1 gene revealed promoter activity, suggesting this is the functional gene that encodes the Sm-D1 protein. The promoter activity was localized in a 0.38 kb PstI fragment using CAT reporter gene fusion assays. Addition of an SV40 enhancer element did not enhance the transcription directed by that fragment. Sequence comparison of the 0.38 kb promoter sequence with the promoters of the Sm-E gene and U1 snRNA genes revealed several homologous motifs, suggesting that genes encoding the snRNP components may be coordinately regulated.
