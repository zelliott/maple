Evolutionary transitions between different modes of development in marine invertebrates are thought to be biased toward the loss of feeding larvae. Because the morphology of feeding larvae is complex and nonfeeding larvae or encapsulated embryos with benthic development often have simplified morphologies, it is presumed to be easier to lose a larval stage than to reacquire it. Some authors have gone so far as to suggest that feeding larvae, morphologically similar to the ancestral feeding larvae, cannot be reacquired. However, the larval structures of some groups, most notably gastropods, are often retained in the encapsulated embryos of species that hatch as benthic juveniles. Therefore the re-evolution of feeding larvae using the same structures may be possible in these groups. Here we present the first well-substantiated case for the recent re-evolution of feeding larvae within a clade of direct-developers. DNA sequence data show that Crepipatella fecunda, a species of calyptraeid gastropod with planktotrophic development, is nested within a clade of species with direct development, and that Crepipatella dilatata, a species with direct development, appears to be paraphyletic with respect to C. fecunda. Observation of the embryos of C. dilatata shows that the features necessary for larval feeding and swimming are retained in the encapsulated veligers, suggesting that heterochronic shifts in hatching time and changes in nurse-egg allotment could have resulted in the re-evolution of feeding larvae in this species.
