E. coli expressing the papA-I genes produce pili that mediate specific adhesion to mammalian cells. We show that the major pilus subunit gene, papA, is part of a polycistronic transcriptional unit subject to specific posttranscriptional processing. A primary transcript also encoding the papB regulatory gene product is endonucleolytically cleaved, resulting in the rapid decay of the papB-encoding 5' half of the mRNA, whereas the papA-encoding 3' half remains as a quite stable transcript. Processing and differential mRNA stability thereby result in accumulation of mRNAs encoding only the major pilus subunit. A sequence immediately downstream of the papA coding region may serve as a stability determinant for the papA transcript and concomitantly attenuate read-through transcription into the minor pilus subunit gene papH. This suggests that differential expression of genes within an operon may include endo- and exonucleolytic processing of the mRNA.
