Plasminogen binding proteins have been described both for Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. In the present work we describe the purification and characterization of a plasminogen binding protein from Haemophilus influenzae (strain HI-23459). Bacteria were sonicated in order to solubilize plasminogen-binding proteins. The supernatant was subjected to affinity chromatography on plasminogen kringle-4 fragment bound to Sepharose 4B and subsequently processed by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B. Characterization of the protein by SDS-PAGE displayed a single band with a molecular mass of about 55,000, both prior to and after reduction. The purified protein stimulates tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) catalysed plasminogen activation by a factor of approximately 300, mainly due to a decrease in K(m). Antibodies were raised in rabbits and used in quantitative and qualitative analysis. However, using a FITC-conjugate we failed to demonstrate the presence of the purified protein on the surface of intact bacteria. The corresponding gene was isolated from a lambda EMBL3 phage library prepared from chromosomal DNA from the same H. influenzae strain, using an oligonucleotide probe based on the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence. An open reading frame corresponding to 472 amino acid was found. The amino acid sequence of the translated gene demonstrates 97% identity with the recently published sequence from aspartate ammonia lyase (aspartase) from H. influenzae. Enzymatic analysis of the purified protein revealed a high aspartase activity.
