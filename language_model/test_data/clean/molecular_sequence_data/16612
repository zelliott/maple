Previous findings on structural rearrangements in the chloroplast genome of Cuscuta (dodder), the only parasitic genus in the morning-glory family, Convolvulaceae, were attributed to its parasitic life style, but without proper comparison to related nonparasitic members of the family. Before molecular evolutionary questions regarding genome evolution can be answered, the phylogenetic problems within the family need to be resolved. However, the phylogenetic position of parasitic angiosperms and their precise relationship to nonparasitic relatives are difficult to infer. Problems are encountered with both morphological and molecular evidence. Molecular data have been used in numerous studies to elucidate relationships of parasitic taxa, despite accelerated rates of sequence evolution. To address the question of the position of the genus Cuscuta within Convolvulaceae, we generated a new molecular data set consisting of mitochondrial (atpA) and nuclear (RPB2) genes, and analyzed these data together with an existing chloroplast data matrix (rbcL, atpB, trnL-F, and psbE-J), to which an additional chloroplast gene (rpl2) was added. This data set was analyzed with an array of phylogenetic methods, including Bayesian analysis, maximum likelihood, and maximum parsimony. Further exploration of data was done by using methods of phylogeny hypothesis testing. At least two nonparasitic lineages are shown to diverge within the Convolvulaceae before Cuscuta. However, the exact sister group of Cuscuta could not be ascertained, even though many alternatives were rejected with confidence. Caution is therefore warranted when interpreting the causes of molecular evolution in Cuscuta. Detailed comparisons with nonparasitic Convolvulaceae are necessary before firm conclusions can be reached regarding the effects of the parasitic mode of life on patterns of molecular evolution in Cuscuta.
