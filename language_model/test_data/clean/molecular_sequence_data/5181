The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD; EC1.2.1.12)-encoding gene (gpd) was isolated from a genomic library of Phaffia rhodozyma CBS 6938. Unlike some other eukaryotic organisms the gpd gene is represented by a single copy in P. rhodozyma. The complete nucleotide sequence of the coding, as well as the flanking non-coding regions was determined. The nucleotide sequence of gpd predicted six introns and a polypeptide chain of 339 amino acids. The codon usage in the gpd gene of P. rhodozyma was highly biased and was significantly different from the codon usage in other yeasts. Phylogenetic analysis of different yeasts and filamentous asco- and basidiomycetes gpd sequences indicated that the gpd gene of P. rhodozyma forms a cluster with the corresponding genes of filamentous basidiomycetes.
