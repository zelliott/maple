We have isolated and sequenced a novel 754-bp human fetal brain cDNA encoding a fatty acid-binding protein (FABP). The cDNA contains an open reading frame of 396 nucleotides (132 amino acids). Northern analysis revealed small amounts of a 1.2-kb transcript in adult human brain and a shorter transcript in skeletal muscle, but no message was detected in other tissues examined. On the other hand, it was abundantly expressed in fetal brain but not in fetal lung, liver or kidney tissues. The elevated level of transcript at immature stages and its subsequent decline In adult brain indicate that the encoded protein may be essential for development of the human brain.
