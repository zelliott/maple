The amino acid sequence predicted from a rat liver cDNA library indicated that the precursor of beta-AlaAT I (4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, beta-alanine-oxoglutarate aminotransferase) consists of a mature enzyme of 466 amino acid residues and a 34-amino acid terminal segment, with amino acids attributed to the leader peptide. However, the mass of beta-AlaAT I from rat brain was larger than that from rat liver and kidney, as assessed by Western-blot analysis, mass spectroscopy and N-terminal sequencing. The mature form of beta-AlaAT I from the brain had an ISQAAAK- peptide on the N-terminus of the liver mature beta-AlaAT I. Brain beta-AlaAT I was cleaved to liver beta-AlaAT I when incubated with fresh mitochondrial extract from rat liver. These results imply that mature rat liver beta-AlaAT I is proteolytically cleaved in two steps. The first cleavage of the motif XRX( downward arrow)XS is performed by a mitochondrial processing peptidase, yielding an intermediate-sized protein which is the mature brain beta-AlaAT I. The second cleavage, which generates the mature liver beta-AlaAT I, is also carried out by a mitochondrial endopeptidase. The second peptidase is active in liver but lacking in brain.
