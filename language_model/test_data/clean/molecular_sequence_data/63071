TrpY binds specifically to TRP box sequences upstream of trpB2, but the repression of trpB2 transcription requires additional TrpY assembly that is stimulated by but not dependent on the presence of tryptophan. Inhibitory complex formation is prevented by insertions within the regulatory region and by a G149R substitution in TrpY, even though TrpY(G149R) retains both TRP box DNA- and tryptophan-binding abilities.
