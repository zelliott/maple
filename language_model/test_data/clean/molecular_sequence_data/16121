Integration host factor (IHF) of Escherichia coli is a histone-like protein that is involved both in site-specific recombination and in regulating the expression of a number of phage and bacterial genes. We have shown previously that transcription of the ilvGMEDA operon in E. coli is greatly reduced in IHF mutants. We report here that IHF specifically protects two sites within the ilvGMEDA promoter-regulatory region against DNase I digestion. These sites are located upstream from the promoter and in the leader region just prior to the sequence that specifies the attenuator. The footprinting experiments and gel retardation assays show that these sites have strong affinity for IHF. These data and results with ilvGMEDA-lac promoter fusions suggest a direct role for IHF in expression of the ilvGMEDA operon.
