Nerve growth factor (NGF) represents a family of structurally related trophic factors, including brain-derived neurotrophin factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), NT-4, and NT-5. These neurotrophin factors interact with two classes of receptors, the trk receptor tyrosine kinase family, and the low affinity p75 neurotrophin receptor. To study potential ligand-receptor interactions, recombinant trk fusion proteins have been constructed, and pan-trk polyclonal antisera directed against the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain have been generated. The recombinant proteins were assessed for in vitro kinase activity and for the ability of K-252a to inhibit phosphorylation. Antibodies made against the fusion protein recognize all trk family members, and are effective in immunoprecipitation of affinity-crosslinked receptors. Comparative crosslinking indicates that NGF can recognize all trk receptor members, illustrating the large number of potential ligand-receptor interactions between neurotrophins and their receptors.
