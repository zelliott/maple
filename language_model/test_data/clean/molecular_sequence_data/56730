The prolactin secreting rat pituitary tumor cell line, GH3, expresses high affinity receptors for both vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and somatostatin (SS14). VIP induces prolactin secretion by GH3 cells, an action which is antagonized by SS14. This in vitro model was used to examine the mechanism of action of two synthetic somatostatin analogs, D-Phe-Cys-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys-Thr-OH (octreotide; SMS 201-995) and cyclo(aminoheptanoyl-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr (benzyl)) (cyclic pentapeptide; CPP). Octreotide and CPP bind to the pituitary somatostatin receptor with lower affinity than does SS14 (KD = 1.3 +/- 1.1; 80 +/- 29; 211 +/- 107 nM for SS14, octreotide and CPP, respectively). SS14 and octreotide were equally effective as inhibitors of VIP-mediated accumulation of cAMP (40% and 45% inhibition, respectively, P < 0.01). SS14 and octreotide also inhibited forskolin-mediated accumulation of cAMP (42% and 40% inhibition of cAMP production, respectively; P < 0.01). The inhibitory action of somatostatin and octreotide on both VIP- and forskolin-mediated cAMP accumulation was blocked by pre-treatment of GH3 cells with pertussis toxin (P < 0.001). Neither SS14 nor octreotide affects the apparent affinity of VIP for its specific receptors on GH3 cells; thus, the inhibitory action of SS14 and octreotide appears to be mediated at the locus of the G-protein-adenylate cyclase complex. In contrast, CPP inhibited VIP-mediated cAMP accumulation slightly, but had no effect on forskolin-mediated cAMP production. Pertussis toxin did not attenuate CPP affects on VIP-mediated cAMP accumulation. However, pre-incubation of GH3 cells with CPP decreased the apparent affinity of receptors for VIP, suggesting that effects of CPP are attributable to interference with VIP binding rather than inhibition at the G-protein-adenylate cyclase complex.
