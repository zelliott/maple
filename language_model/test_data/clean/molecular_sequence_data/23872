We report here the isolation, cloning and characterization of two abundant centromeric satellite sequences (Rsat I and Rsat II) what are not related to each other, and that of a divergent subfamily (Rsat IIE) of rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). The Rsat I monomers had a 375 base pair (bp) average length, while repeat units Rsat II and Rsat IIE were approximately 585 bp long. Variable amounts of Rsat I were detected by FISH at the centromeric region of 11 chromosome pairs of the complement. Rsat II hybridized to the centromere of 12 different chromosomes, and two of these were labeled also with the Rsat IIE probe. Two-color in situ hybridizations with the satellite probes and rDNA revealed that the NOR chromosomes carried different satellites. Rsat I was abundant on chromosome 20 and 21, but it was undetectable on chromosomes 13 and 16. Large Rsat II arrays were found on chromosomes 16, 20 and 21, but reduced amount was detected on chromosome 13. The variant Rsat IIE was prominent on chromosome 16, but was absent from the other rDNA-bearing chromosomes. The rDNA signal on chromosome 21 was localized to the 21q(ter) region, what can be a useful cytological marker in comparative cytological studies. These data show that rabbit chromosomes form at least four distinct groups based on the satellite composition of their centromeres. The differences in the chromosomal distribution of satellite families will help easy FISH identification of individual chromosomes, as well as to unveil the evolutionary history of the Leporidae karyotype.
