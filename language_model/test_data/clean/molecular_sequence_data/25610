The gene coding for creatinase (creatine amidinohydrolase, EC 3.5.3.3) was isolated from Flavobacterium sp. U-188. The primary structure of creatinase deduced from the nucleotide sequence showed a protein (molecular weight, 42, 651) composed of 378 amino acids. The creatinase gene was over-expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of the lac promoter and the amount of this enzyme was over 20% of the soluble protein in the cell.
