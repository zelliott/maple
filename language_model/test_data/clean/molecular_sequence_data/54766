Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) with fimbriae of the F4 family are one of the major causes of diarrhea and death among neonatal and young piglets. Bacteria use the F4 fimbriae to adhere to specific receptors expressed on the surface of the enterocytes. F4 fimbriae exist in three different antigenic variants, F4ab, F4ac, and F4ad, of which F4ac is the most common. Resistance to ETEC F4ab/F4ac adhesion in pigs has been shown to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. In previous studies the ETEC F4ab/F4ac receptor locus (F4bcR) was mapped to the q41 region on pig chromosome 13. A polymorphism within an intron of the mucin 4 (MUC4) gene, which is one of the possible candidate genes located in this region, was shown earlier to cosegregate with the F4bcR alleles. Recently, we discovered a Large White boar from a Swiss experimental herd with a recombination between F4bcR and MUC4. A three-generation pedigree including 45 offspring was generated with the aim to use this recombination event to refine the localization of the F4bcR locus. All pigs were phenotyped using the microscopic adhesion test and genotyped for a total of 59 markers. The recombination event was mapped to a 220-kb region between a newly detected SNP in the leishmanolysin-like gene (LMLN g.15920) and SNP ALGA0072075. In this study the six SNPs ALGA0072075, ALGA0106330, MUC13-226, MUC13-813, DIA0000584, and MARC0006918 were in complete linkage disequilibrium with F4bcR. Based on this finding and earlier investigations, we suggest that the locus for F4bcR is located between the LMLN locus and microsatellite S0283.
