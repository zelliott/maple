Rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gamma (TCRgamma) gene potentially provides a valuable target for monitoring minimal residual leukaemia by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). However, existing strategies directed at this locus frequently lack sensitivity or specificity. We describe a novel PCR strategy for improved detection of clonal TCRgamma gene rearrangements based on the design of two overlapping clone-specific reverse PCR primers spanning the TCRgamma junctional region, which are used sequentially in conjunction with forward V-region specific primers. Unlike other strategies, specificity is generated from the initial and subsequent round of PCR amplification. This non-radioactive technique is highly specific and sensitive, and should prove effective for monitoring minimal residual leukaemia.
