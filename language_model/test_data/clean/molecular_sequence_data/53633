PI-SceI is a member of a class of proteins (inteins) that excise themselves from a precursor protein and in the process ligate the flanking protein sequences (exteins). We report here the 2.1-A resolution crystal structure of a PI-SceI miniprecursor (VMA29) containing 10 N-terminal extein residues and 4 C-terminal extein residues. Mutations at the N- and C-terminal splicing junctions, blocking in vivo protein splicing, allowed the miniprecursor to be purified and crystallized. The structure reveals both the N- and C-terminal scissile peptide bonds to be in distorted trans conformations (tau approximately 100 degrees ). Modeling of the wild-type PI-SceI based on the VMA29 structure indicates a large conformational change (movement of >9 A) must occur to allow transesterification to be completed. A zinc atom was discovered at the C-terminal splicing junction. Residues Cys(455), His(453), and Glu(80) along with a water molecule (Wat(53)) chelate the zinc atom. The crystal structure of VMA29 has captured the intein in its pre-spliced state.
