Previously, we purified a novel protein tyrosine phosphatase from eggs of the flesh fly, Sarcophaga peregrina. This protein tyrosine phosphatase, named egg-derived tyrosine phosphatase (EDTP), is expressed during oogenesis and early embryogenesis but is rapidly degraded in middle embryogenesis by lysosomal cathepsin L. Here, we demonstrate the requirement of EDTP in the development of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Deletion of the Drosophila EDTP gene using transposase-catalyzed imprecise excision resulted in homozygous lethals during embryogenesis. Additionally, germline clones generated using the FLP-FRT-ovo(D) system showed severe defects in ovarian development during oogenesis. These results indicate that the Drosophila EDTP gene is crucial in oogenesis and embryogenesis.
