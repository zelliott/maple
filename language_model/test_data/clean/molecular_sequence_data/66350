Nine strains of a new Torulaspora species were isolated from natural samples collected in Japan and Thailand including one strain obtained from a leaf of Rhizophora stylosa (NBRC 11061T), one strain from soil (NBRC 11062), six strains from mosses (ST-14, ST-266, ST-510, ST-511, ST-513 and ST-581) and one strain from sediment in mangrove forest (RV-51). On the basis of morphological, biochemical, physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, and the sequence analyses of the D1/D2 domain of the large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) (ITS1-5.8S rRNA gene-ITS2) region, the nine strains were found to represent a single novel species of the genus Torulaspora, which were named Torulaspora maleeae sp. nov. The type strain is NBRC 11061T (BCC 25515T=CBS 10694T). In the phylogenetic trees based on the sequences of the D1/D2 domain of the LSU rRNA gene, T. maleeae showed a close relationship with the five recognized species of the genus Torulaspora, Torulaspora delbrueckii, Torulaspora franciscae, Torulaspora globosa, Torulaspora microellipsoides and Torulaspora pretoriensis. Torulaspora maleeae differed from the five recognized species of the genus Torulaspora by six to 12 nucleotide substitutions (1.1-2.1%) in the D1/D2 domain of the LSU rRNA gene and by 6.4-11.7% nucleotide substitutions in the ITS (ITS1-5.8S rRNA gene-ITS2) region.
