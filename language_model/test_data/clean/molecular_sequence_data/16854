The Ras protein activates at least three different pathways during early development. Two of them regulate mesodermal gene expression and the third is thought to participate in the control of actin cytoskeleton dynamics via the Ral protein. From a yeast two-hybrid screen of a Xenopus maternal cDNA library, we identified the Xenopus orthologue of the Ral interacting protein (RLIP, RIP1 or RalBP1), a putative effector of small G protein Ral. Previously, we observed that a constitutively activated form of Ral GTPase (XralB G23V) induced bleaching of the animal hemisphere and disruption of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. To demonstrate that RLIP is the effector of RalB in early development, we show that the artificial targeting of RLIP to the membrane induces a similar phenotype to that of activated RalB. We show that overexpression of the Ral binding domain (RalBD) of XRLIP, which binds to the effector site of Ral, acts in competition with the endogenous effector of Ral and protects against the destructive effect of XralB G23V on the actin cytoskeleton. In contrast, the XRLIP has a synergistic effect on the activated form of XralB, which is dependent on the RalBD of RLIP. We provide evidence for the involvement of RLIP by way of its RalBD on the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton and propose that signalling from Ral to RLIP is required for gastrulation.
