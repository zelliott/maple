Mitomycin C (MC) is a powerful antitumor agent that targets the DNA sequence CpG. Because it is likely that this dinucleotide will contain 5-methylcytosine in vivo, we have compared the cross-linking efficiency of MC for DNA containing either 5-methylcytosine or normal cytosine embedded in random-sequence DNA oligomers. We have found that mitomycin C displays a small but significant preference for methylated DNA. Recognition of an abnormal methylation pattern in the DNA of transformed cells may therefore be one mechanism by which MC exerts its chemotherapeutic effects.
