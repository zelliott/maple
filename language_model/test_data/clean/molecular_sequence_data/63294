Giardiasis is a major problem in León, Nicaragua, yet despite this no data are available regarding the prevalence of different Giardia genotypes in this area. To address this question, a molecular analysis of Giardia isolates from humans and dogs living in the same area in León, Nicaragua was performed. Giardia isolates from 119 Nicaraguan patients and 8 dogs were successfully genotyped using single and/or nested beta-giardin PCR with subsequent restriction length fragment polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The analyses of human samples yielded 94 (79%) assemblage B isolates and 25 (21%) assemblage A isolates. Only the non-human-associated assemblages C and D were found in the dog samples. Sixteen isolates with assemblage A pattern, 26 isolates with assemblage B pattern and all dog isolates were further characterized by sequencing the nested beta-giardin PCR product and by molecular analyses of the glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) gene. Within the study area the assemblage A isolates were highly genetically homogenous, showing only sub-genotypes A2 (n=3) or A3 (n=13) at the beta-giardin locus and AII only at the gdh locus while assemblage B showed a high genetic polymorphism at both loci. Seven different sub-genotypes were identified within 13 of the sequenced assemblage B beta-giardin isolates. The remaining 13 sequenced assemblage B-isolates appeared to contain several different variants of the beta-giardin gene since the chromatograms displayed one to seven double peaks. The gdh sequences showed an even higher polymorphism since only 2 of 26 assemblage B isolates were without double peaks. Two mixed infections between assemblage A and B were found when the gdh gene was analyzed. Polymorphisms were also observed in the dog-associated assemblages C and D, but to a lesser extent than in assemblage B.
