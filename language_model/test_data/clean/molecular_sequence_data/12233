The structure of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strain 49 capsular polysaccharide has been investigated mainly by sugar and methylation analysis, partial chemical degradations, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. The results suggest that the polysaccharide is composed of pentasaccharide repeating units having the following structure. [formula: see text] The polysaccharide contains O-acetyl groups, one of which is substituted to O-3 of the 4-substituted alpha-D-Galp residue, while others occur in non-stoichiometric amounts at other locations.
