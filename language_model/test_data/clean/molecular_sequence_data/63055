Cytoskeletal scaffolding complexes help organize specialized membrane domains with unique functions on the surface of cells. In this study, we define the scaffolding potential of the Schwann cell dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) by establishing the presence of four syntrophin isoforms, (alpha1, beta1, beta2, and gamma2), and one dystrobrevin isoform, (alpha-dystrobrevin-1), in the abaxonal membrane. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of two separate DGCs in Schwann cells that divide the abaxonal membrane into spatially distinct domains, the DRP2/periaxin rich plaques and the Cajal bands that contain Dp116, utrophin, alpha-dystrobrevin-1 and four syntrophin isoforms. Finally, we show that the two different DGCs can scaffold unique accessory molecules in distinct areas of the Schwann cell membrane. Specifically, the cholesterol transporter ABCA1, associates with the Dp116/syntrophin complex in Cajal bands and is excluded from the DRP2/periaxin rich plaques.
