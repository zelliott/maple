A panel of monoclonal antibodies were generated against the surface polysaccharide antigens of the cell envelope of Salmonella typhi. Four clones (IgM) were specific for the capsular Vi polysaccharide, and one clone (IgG3) reacted selectively with the S. typhi lipopolysaccharide in enzyme immunoassay. On the basis of their reactivity pattern and binding affinity, MATy-V7 (IgM) and MATy-O9 (IgG3) antibodies were selected for further characterization of their antigenic specificity. In an inhibition enzyme immunoassay with rabbit factor-specific anti-Salmonella antibodies as the competing agents, the reactivity of MATy-V7 and MATy-O9 were significantly inhibited by the anti-Vi and anti-O9 antisera, respectively. Moreover, both the Vi- and O9-specific monoclonal antibodies were shown to be useful serotyping agents by correct identification in slide agglutination tests of 32 clinical isolates of all the S. typhi and other serogroup D salmonellae among a total of 140 bacterial isolates representing eight different Enterobacteriaceae genera tested.
