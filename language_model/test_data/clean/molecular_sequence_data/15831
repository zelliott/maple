Synovial fluid of patients with different inflammatory and metabolic joint diseases contains low-molecular CPIs (stefins and cystatins) and high-molecular CPIs (kininogens). An additional inhibitory fragment with a molecular mass of about 20 kDa, which is a part of the kininogen molecule, has been detected. Cathepsin B and cystatin C were determined by ELISA test in 47 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, seronegative spondylarthritis, osteoarthritis, undifferentiated arthritis and gout. A significantly higher amount of cathepsin B was found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The elevation of cathepsin B was accompanied by an increased amount of cystatin C.
