In the human T cell receptor gamma (TRG) locus, fourteen variable (TRGV) genes belonging to four subgroups have been identified upstream of two constant region (TRGC) genes. Three joining segments, JP1, JP and J1, have been localized upstream of TRGC1, and two others, JP2 and J2, upstream of TRGC2. In this report, we demonstrate that a unique Xho I fragment of 120 kilobases (kb) contains the fourteen TRGV genes and that the hybridization of that fragment in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) allows linkage of the variable region to the constant region locus. We also show that the variable and the constant regions are remarkably close to each other since the distance between V11, the most 3' V gamma gene, and JP1, the most 5' J gamma segment, is only 16 kb. With its 14 V gamma genes, spanning 100 kb, the two C gamma genes and 5 joining segments covering less than 40 kb and only 16 kb separating the most 3' V gene from the most 5' J segment, the human TRG locus spans 160 kb of genomic DNA and represents a particularly condensed locus compared to the other rearranging gene loci.
