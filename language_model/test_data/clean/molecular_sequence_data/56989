The multicomponent enzyme, naphthalene dioxygenase, initiates the metabolism of naphthalene by Pseudomonas putida strains G7 (PpG7) and NCIB 9816-4 (Pp9816-4). The genes involved (nahAaAbAcAd) are encoded by the NAH7 and pDTG1 plasmids, respectively, and form part of the nah operon. The locations of the structural genes were determined on previously cloned fragments of DNA. The nucleotide (nt) sequences were determined for nahAaAb from Pp9816-4 and for nahAaAbAcAd from PpG7. The appropriate open reading frames were identified using N-terminal amino acid sequences determined from the purified proteins. The two nt sequences showed 93% homology, with the least homology seen upstream from the promoter region.
