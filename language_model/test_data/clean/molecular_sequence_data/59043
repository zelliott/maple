VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein), a protein associated with microfilaments at cellular contact sites, has been identified as a ligand for profilin and zyxin, two proteins also involved in microfilament dynamics and organization at these regions. Here, we report that VASP also directly binds to vinculin, another component of adherens junctions. Competition experiments with a vinculin-derived peptide showed that a proline-rich motif, located in the hinge region that connects vinculin's head and tail domains, is involved in VASP binding. The same motif is present in zyxin but the interactions of VASP with vinculin and zyxin differ in detail. Hence, this motif may be recognized by VASP in different ways when presented in distinct cellular sites.
