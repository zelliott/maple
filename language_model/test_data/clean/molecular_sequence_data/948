Peroxiredoxins are a large family of peroxidases that have important antioxidant and cell signaling functions. Genes encoding two novel 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin proteins were identified in the expressed sequence tag data base of the helminth parasite Schistosoma mansoni, a causative agent of schistosomiasis. The recombinant proteins showed peroxidase activity in vitro with a variety of hydroperoxides and used both the thioredoxin and the glutathione systems as electron donors. Steady-state kinetic analysis indicated that the new peroxiredoxins had saturable kinetics, whereas a previously identified schistosome peroxiredoxin was found to function with more typical unsaturable (ping-pong) kinetics. The catalytic efficiencies S. mansoni peroxiredoxins were similar to those for other peroxiredoxins studied (10(4)-10(5) m(-1) s(-1)). Mutagenesis of S. mansoni peroxiredoxins indicated that glutathione dependence and kinetic differences were conferred by the C-terminal alpha-helix forming 22 amino acids. This is the first report of 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins efficiently utilizing reducing equivalents from both the thioredoxin and glutathione systems. Studies to determine the resistance to oxidative inactivation, important in regulating cell signaling pathways, showed that S. mansoni possess both bacterial-like resistant and mammalian-like sensitive peroxiredoxins. The susceptibility to oxidative inactivation was conferred by the C-terminal tail containing a tyrosine-phenylalanine motif. S. mansoni is the first organism shown to possess both robust and sensitive peroxiredoxins. The ability of schistosome peroxiredoxins to use alternative electron donors, and their variable resistance to overoxidation may reflect their presence in different cellular sites and emphasizes the significant differences in overall redox balance mechanisms between the parasite and its mammalian host.
