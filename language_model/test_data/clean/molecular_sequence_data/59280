The amino acid sequence of MG160, a membrane sialoglycoprotein of the medial cisternae of the rat Golgi apparatus, is more than 90% identical with CFR, a fibroblast growth factor (FGF) binding protein of chicken membranes, and with ESL-1, a ligand for E-selectin of plasma membranes of myeloid cells; furthermore, MG160, isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography from rat brain membranes, binds to basic FGF. The gene for MG160 has been assigned to human chromosome 16q22-23. To characterize this protein further in the human, its cDNA was cloned and sequenced. The protein has a large luminal domain composed of an initial proline-glutamine-rich segment, encoded by an uninterrupted exonic sequence of several CAG-CAA repeats. Expansion of CAG repeats has been implicated in the etiology of several neurodegenerative diseases. The proline-glutamine-rich segment is followed by 16 cysteine-rich repeats that contain five potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites, which are conserved in the human, rat, mouse, and chicken. The large intralumenal domain of the protein is followed by a single transmembrane domain and a 13-amino-acid cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal tail, which is identical to that in the chicken, rat, and mouse. The overall amino acid identifies between MG160, CFR, and ESL-1 range from 88% to 95%. In several human fetal and adult tissues, three mRNA transcripts for MG160 of 10 kb, 5 kb, and 3.8 kb were identified by Northern blot analysis of poly(A)-selected mRNAs. These transcripts may represent alternatively spliced mRNAs of the protein or mRNAs encoding closely related proteins of the Golgi apparatus and/or plasma membranes.
