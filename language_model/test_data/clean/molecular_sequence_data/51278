Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) modulates the expression of numerous genes via interaction with a specific DNA sequence termed the kappa B site. Its activity is modulated by a cytosolic inhibitor protein termed I kappa B, and its activation occurs in response to a variety of agents in a variety of cell types, most notably B and T lymphocytes. Data presented here show that an activity (designated complex I) that binds specifically to the kappa B site is induced in density-arrested Balb/c-3T3 mouse fibroblasts by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a potent mitogen for these cells. Increased levels of complex I, as evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays of nuclear extracts, were observed in cells treated for 1-4 h (but not 15 min) with the BB isoform of PDGF. 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and the AA isoform of PDGF also stimulated this response and both isoforms, but not TPA, were effective in cells depleted of protein kinase C. Complex I most likely is authentic NF-kappa B, a p50-p65 heterodimer, or a closely related factor because it exhibited properties characteristic of those previously described for NF-kappa B including inducibility by deoxycholate and cycloheximide and sensitivity to I kappa B. A second kappa B binding activity (complex II), which apparently contained p50 homodimers, displayed limited induction by PDGF, whereas a third complex (complex III) migrated faster than but behaved similarly to complex I. These studies suggest that NF-kappa B or an NF-kappa B-like factor may participate in the expression of PDGF-inducible genes.
