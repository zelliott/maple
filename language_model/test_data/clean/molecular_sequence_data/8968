Anti-Tn-antigen monoclonal antibody MLS128 has affinity for three consecutive Tn-antigens (Tn3) more than Tn2. The major aim of this study was to isolate genes encoding MLS128 variable domains to produce a large quantity of recombinant MLS128 antibodies, in turn, allowing the conduct of studies on precise interactions between Tn3- or Tn2-epitopes and MLS128. This study describes cloning of the variable region genes of MLS128, construction of the variable region genes in single-chain variable fragments (scFv) and two scFvs conjugated with human IgG(1) hinge and Fc regions (scFv-Fc) types, and their respective expression in bacterial and mammalian cell. MLS128 scFv protein with the expected specificity and affinity was successfully prepared from inclusion bodies accumulating in Escherichia coli. Construction, expression and purification of two types of MLS128-scFv-Fc proteins with differing linker lengths in Chinese hamster ovary cells demonstrated that the purified scFv-Fc proteins had binding activity specific to the glycoprotein-expressing Tn-antigen clusters. These results revealed that VL and VH genes cloned from the hybridoma represent those of MLS128 and that recombinant antibodies produced from these genes should provide sufficient amounts of binding domains for use in 3D structural studies such as NMR and X-ray analysis.
