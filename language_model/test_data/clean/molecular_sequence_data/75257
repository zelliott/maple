That the yolk proteins (YPs), or vitellins, stored in the oocytes of insects are a nutritional store for subsequent embryogenesis has long been assumed. Exhaustive data base searching programs revealed highly significant sequence similarity between the three YPs of Drosophila melanogaster and part of the triacylglycerol lipase of the domestic pig. Based upon time of degradation of YPs during embryogenesis, existence of maternally stored ecdysteroid conjugates in embryos, location of these conjugates in locust embryos, and the fact that free active ecdysteroid hormones are released at a specific time in embryogenesis to trigger cuticle deposition, we postulate that the similarity reflects a common property of Drosophila YPs--the ability to bind the fatty acid ecdysteroid conjugates. Our finding of conjugated ecdysteroids tightly bound to purified Drosophila YP supports this prediction.
