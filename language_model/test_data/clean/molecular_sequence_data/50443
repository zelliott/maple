To identify DNA sequences that are deleted in human lung cancer, genomic subtraction hybridization was used to construct plasmid libraries that are enriched for DNA sequences deleted in the small cell lung carcinoma cell line SK-LC-17. The clones of the libraries contained predominantly single copy sequences, allowing direct screening of normal and tumor DNA by genomic Southern blotting. Of 150 clones tested, three independent clones (del-27, del-118, and del-109) were identified that specifically hybridized with normal human DNA but not with tumor DNA from the cell line SK-LC-17. The corresponding DNA sequences are localized on human chromosomes 5, 8, and X/Y. The DNA regions identified by del-109 and del-118 were also found to be deleted in several other lung carcinoma cell lines. Moreover, del-118 was deleted in a freshly isolated lymph node metastasis of a human lung adenocarcinoma. It is therefore reasonable to speculate that the identified clones are derived from independent genetic loci encoding potential tumor suppressor genes.
