A hemoprotein that can be defined as hemoglobin based on oxygen binding was isolated from Tetrahymena pyriformis. The protein exists in monomeric form and is separated into four fractions (Ia, Ib, IIa, and IIb) on a CM-cellulose column. From examinations of the absorption spectra and the N-terminal sequence, fractions Ia and Ib were assigned to the oxy-form and its met-form, respectively, of the one protein, while IIa and IIb corresponded to those of the other one. The complete amino acid sequence was therefore determined of fractions I and II. The I was composed of 121 amino acid residues, with the N-terminal serine being blocked. The II, on the other hand, consisted of 119 amino acid residues, its sequence being exactly identical to that of the third residue, lysine, to the C-terminal lysine of the fraction I. Although the genomic multiplicity cannot be ruled out completely, we have concluded that fraction II is a degradation product of the fraction I by endogeneous proteases. The amino acid sequence of T. pyriformis hemoglobin is very unique and showed no notable degree of similarity with the other hemoglobins sequenced so far, but it was found to be 33.9% identical with Paramecium caudatum hemoglobin by a maximal alignment.
