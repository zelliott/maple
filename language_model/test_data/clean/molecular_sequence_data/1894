We report the isolation of 24 novel genotypes of TT viruses from a surgically removed spleen of a patient with Hodgkin's disease. The sequence analysis of our 24 isolates revealed the remarkable heterogeneity of TT virus isolates not only from the same patient but also from the same biopsy material. These isolates belong to four phylogenetic groups of TT viruses. Nucleotide sequence analyses revealed five distinct genotypes (tth3, tth4, tth5, tth6, and tth7). The limited variation in sequence identity of the other isolates defines the latter as variants of four of these genotypes. A group of 6 isolates (the tth7 group) revealed a reorganization of open reading frame 1 (ORF1) leading to one larger and a varying number of smaller ORFs. The nucleotide difference of the full-length genomes was less than 1%. A variation of 69 to 97% in amino acids of a second group of 8 isolates (the tth3 group) was restricted to the hypervariable region of ORF1, indicating the existence of a quasi-species. These isolates differed by less than 2% in the remainder of their nucleotide sequences. An alignment of these isolates with 79 previously reported TT virus genotypes permits the proposal of TT virus genera and species within the family Anelloviridae in analogy to a previous proposal for the papillomaviruses (family Papillomaviridae).
