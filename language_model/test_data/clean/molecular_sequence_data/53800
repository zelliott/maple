A T-cell attracting CXC chemokine phylogenetically related to MIG and SCYB10 was recently characterized and termed SCYB11 (alias betaR1/H174/SCYB9B/I-TAC/IP-9/CXCL11). Here, we cloned the cDNA of the murine homologue of this protein, Scyb11, from interferon-gamma/lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 mouse macrophage-like cells. The nucleotide sequence of Scyb11 shares 63% identity with its human counterpart. It encodes a 100 amino acid immature protein of 11,265 Da which contains a putative signal peptide of 21 amino acids. The molecular mass of the mature protein was calculated to be 9,113 Da. Sequence identity of the murine and human SCYB11 proteins is 68%. Phylogenetic tree analysis of mouse CXC chemokines places SCYB11 together with the murine homologues of MIG and SCYB10 (Crg-2/muIP-10) on an individual branch. A genomic sequence was obtained by genome walking and subcloning DNA fragments from a BAC clone containing Scyb11. Like human SCYB11, Scyb11 contains 4 exons with intron/exon boundaries at positions comparable to the human gene. Whereas introns 2 and 3 are of similar length in the murine and human genes, intron 1 of Scyb11 contains 1,260 bp more than intron 1 of the human gene. Intron 1 of Scyb11 is also characterized by a 201-bp stretch with repetitive sequences of high cryptic simplicity. Using a BAC clone containing Scyb11, this gene could be mapped to chromosome 5 at position 5E3. Since human SCYB11 is localized on 4q21.2, this result confirms the mouse/human homology of the two chromosome regions.
