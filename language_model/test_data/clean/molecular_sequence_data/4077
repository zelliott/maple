The Mollicutes are a group of cell-wall-less bacteria and are important plant and animal pathogens. Progress toward analyzing their pathogenic mechanisms has been hampered by the few available genetic tools. Of the two transposons shown to function in mycoplasmas, only Tn4001 is readily amenable to modification and development. One disadvantage of using Tn4001 in mycoplasmas has been independent insertion of the insertion sequence, IS256, probably as a result of inadequate control of the transposase expression in mycoplasmas. In this study, we describe the construction of a mini-Tn4001 containing the tetM antibiotic resistance gene from Tn916. The transposase gene was placed outside the inverted repeats to lower the frequency of independent transposition events. Transposition of mini-Tn4001tet in Mycoplasma gallisepticum occurred at a frequency of 1-8 x 10(-6), a frequency similar to that of the parent transposon. Insertions of mini-Tn4001tet were random and only single insertions were observed. Several unique restriction sites between the inverted repeat sequences provide for further development of mini-Tn4001.
