Human melanin-concentrating hormone (hMCH) is a nonselective natural ligand for the human melanin-concentrating hormone receptors: hMCH-1R and hMCH-2R. Similarly, the smaller peptide encompassing the disulfide ring and Arg(6) of hMCH, Ac-Arg(6)-cyclo(S-S)(Cys(7)-Met(8)-Leu(9)-Gly(10)-Arg(11)-Val(12)-Tyr(13)-Arg(14)-Pro(15)-Cys(16))-NH(2), Ac-hMCH(6-16)-NH(2), binds to and activates equally well both human MCH receptors present in the brain. To separate the physiological functions of hMCH-1R from those of hMCH-2R, new potent and hMCH-1R selective agonists are necessary. In the present study, analogs of Ac-hMCH(6-16)-NH(2) were prepared and tested in binding and functional assays on cells expressing the MCH receptors. In these peptides, Arg in position 6 was replaced with various d-amino acids and/or Gly in position 10 was substituted with various L-amino acids. Several of the new compounds turned out to be potent agonists at hMCH-1R with improved selectivity over hMCH-2R. For example, peptide 26 with d-Arg in place of L-Arg in position 6 and Asn in place of Gly in position 10, Ac-dArg(6)-cyclo(S-S)(Cys(7)-Met(8)-Leu(9)-Asn(10)-Arg(11)-Val(12)-Tyr(13)-Arg(14)-Pro(15)-Cys(16))-NH(2), was a potent hMCH-1R agonist (IC(50) = 0.5 nm, EC(50) = 47 nm) with more than 200-fold selectivity with respect to hMCH-2R. Apparently, these structural changes in positions 6 and 10 results in peptide conformations that allow for efficient interactions with hMCH-1R but are unfavorable for molecular recognition at hMCH-2R.
