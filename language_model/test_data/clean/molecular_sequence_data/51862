The sequence of the epsilon toxin gene of Clostridium perfringens type D was determined and compared with that of the previously reported type B sequence. It showed two nucleotide changes in the open reading frame, giving rise to one amino acid substitution. The promoter sequences were not homologous, and different putative -35 and -10 regions have been identified in each. The sequence information was used to develop PCR primers which were specific for the epsilon toxin gene. The utility of this system for identifying type B or D strains of C. perfringens was demonstrated.
