The glycosylation of epithelial cell surface antigens follows cellular differentiation, and changes in the pattern of expression are seen in various premalignant and malignant epithelial lesions. The distribution of type-2 chain ABH-carbohydrate structures (N-acetyl-lactosamine, H-type 2 chain, Le-y, Le-x and sialyl-Le-x) of the ABO-histo-blood group system was investigated in 19 normal fetal thymuses (gestational age 16 to 39 weeks) and in 19 thymomas in order to study possible tumor-associated changes in the glycosylation pattern. The material was investigated by immunochemical stainings of formalin-fixed paraffin-imbedded tissue using monoclonal antibodies with defined specificity. In fetal thymus the epithelial cells of the medulla and the Hassal's bodies strongly expressed elongated carbohydrate structures (Le-y, Le-x and sialyl-Le-x). In a few cases the cortical epithelial cells weakly expressed Le-x and sialyl-Le-x. Compared with fetal thymus 16 of the thymomas showed a total loss, or a very much reduced expression of elongated carbohydrate structures. Three thymomas, which histologically had been reclassified according to Kirchner & MÃ¼ller-Hermelink (14) as high grade thymic carcinomas, revealed strong expression of Le-y, moderate expression of Le-x and weak expression of sialyl-Le-x. This is of interest as in other tumors Le-y is correlated with increased cell motility and with poor prognosis.
