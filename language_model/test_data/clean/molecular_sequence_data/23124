Therapeutic peptides and small molecules, rationally designed to trigger cell death have attracted strong attention. Cell death inducible peptides were screened from amino acid sequence of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Using Fmoc solid phase synthesis, cellulose membrane-bound octameric peptide library of TRAIL scan was prepared and cell viability assay was directly performed on peptide disk with Jurkat cells. Six peptide sequences that could induce cell death were found. Peptide sequence with RNSCWSKD (TRAIL(227-234)) that exist in the zinc-binding site revealed high cell death inducible activity. Apoptotic cell death was observed when cells were treated with soluble synthesized peptide.
