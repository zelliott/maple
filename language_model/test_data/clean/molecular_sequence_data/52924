The amino acid sequence of Ectothiorhodospira vacuolata cytochrome c-552, isolated from membranes with n-butanol, shows that it is a protein of 77 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 9,041 Da. It is closely related to the cytochrome subunit of Chlorobium limicola f. sp. thiosulfatophilum flavocytochrome c-sulfide dehydrogenase (FCSD), having 49% identity. These data allowed isolation of a 5.5-kb subgenomic clone which contains the cytochrome gene and an adjacent flavoprotein gene as in other species which have an FCSD. The cytochrome subunit has a signal peptide with a normal cleavage site, but the flavoprotein subunit has a signal sequence which suggests that the mature protein has an N-terminal cysteine, characteristic of a diacyl glycerol-modified lipoprotein. The membrane localization of FCSD was confirmed by Western blotting with antibodies raised against Chromatium vinosum FCSD. When aligned according to the three-dimensional structure of Chromatium FCSD, all but one of the side chains near the flavin are conserved. These include the Cys 42 flavin adenine dinucleotide binding site; the Cys 161-Cys 337 disulfide; Glu 167, which modulates the reactivity with sulfite; and aromatic residues which may function as charge transfer acceptors from the flavin-sulfite adduct (C. vinosum numbering). The genetic context of FCSD is different from that in other species in that flanking genes are not conserved. The transcript is only large enough to encode the two FCSD subunits. Furthermore, Northern hybridization showed that the production of E. vacuolata FCSD mRNA is regulated by sulfide. All cultures that contained sulfide in the medium had elevated levels of FCSD RNA compared with cells grown on organics (acetate, malate, or succinate) or thiosulfate alone, consistent with the role of FCSD in sulfide oxidation.
