In biocontrol Pseudomonads, phlD is an essential gene involved in the biosynthesis of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG). HaeIII restriction of amplified phlD gene, previously proposed as the most discriminant analysis, showed no polymorphism among 144 Pseudomonas strains isolated from maize roots. However, these strains fell into three statistically significant DAPG production level groups. phlD sequences of 13 strains belonging to the three DAPG groups revealed a KspI restriction site only in good DAPG-producing strains. This result was confirmed on the 144 strains, 82 of which were identified as good-DAPG producers by both biochemical and amplified phlD KspI restriction analysis. They are candidates as potential biocontrol agents.
