Drosophila ovo/svb (dovo) is required for epidermal cuticle/denticle differentiation and is genetically downstream of the wg signaling pathway. Similarly, a mouse homolog of dovo, movo1, is required for the proper formation of hair, a mammalian epidermal appendage. Here, we provide biochemical evidence that movo1 encodes a nuclear DNA binding protein (mOvo1a) that binds to DNA sequences similar to those that dOvo binds to, further supporting the notion that mOvo1a and dOvo are genetically and biochemically homologous proteins. Additionally, we show that the movo1 promoter is activated by the lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (LEF1)/beta-catenin complex, a transducer of wnt signaling. Collectively, our findings suggest that movo1 is a developmental target of wnt signaling during hair morphogenesis in mice, and that the wg/wnt-ovo link in epidermal appendage regulatory pathways has been conserved between mice and flies.
