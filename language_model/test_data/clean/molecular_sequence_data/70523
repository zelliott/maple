The hairpin ribozyme-substrate complex contains two independently folding domains that interact with one another to form a catalytic complex. However, little is known about the key structural elements involved in these tertiary interactions. Here, we report the use of a photochemical crosslinking method to investigate the relative proximity and orientation of the two domains of the hairpin ribozyme. This method allows the incorporation of a photochemical azidophenacyl group at specified positions within synthetic oligoribonucleotides. Photocrosslinking was performed following the assembly of four RNA oligonucleotides into active ribozyme-substrate complexes. Two photoagent attachment sites in the substrate binding strand within domain A (between positions A7-G8 and A10-G11) and three in the 5' strand of domain B (A20-G21, A22-A23 and A24-C25) were studied. Several crosslinks between the substrate binding strand and the 5' segment of domain B were detected. All of the photo agent-specific crosslinked species were dependent upon proper assembly and folding of the ribozyme-substrate complex. In addition, a substrate base mutation (G+1 to A+1) that prevents the docking of the two domains, blocks the crosslink formation. Four interdomain crosslinks (A7-G8/C25-A26 (two species); A10-G11/A22 and A24-C25/C12-G13) have been shown to retain catalytic activity. Taken together, these results indicate that the characterized crosslinks provide important information concerning the alignment of the two domains and accurately reflect the active docked conformation of the molecule.
