Protein-protein interactions involving specific transactivation domains play a central role in gene transcription and its regulation. The promoter-specific transcription factor Sp1 contains two glutamine-rich transcriptional activation domains (A and B) that mediate direct interactions with the transcription factor TFIID complex associated with RNA polymerase II and synergistic effects involving multiple Sp1 molecules. In the present study, we report the complementary DNA sequence for an alternatively spliced form of mouse Sp1 (mSp1-S) that lacks one of the two glutamine-rich activation regions present in the full-length protein. Corresponding transcripts were identified in mouse tissues and cell lines, and an Sp1-related protein identical in size to that predicted for mSp1-S was detected in mouse nuclear extracts. Cotransfection analysis revealed that mSp1-S lacks appreciable activity at promoters containing a single Sp1 response element but is active when multiple Sp1 sites are present, suggesting synergistic interactions between multiple mSp1-S molecules. The absence of a single glutamine-rich domain does not fully explain the properties of the smaller protein and indicates that additional structural features account for its unique transcriptional activity. The functional implications of this alternatively spliced form of Sp1 are discussed.
