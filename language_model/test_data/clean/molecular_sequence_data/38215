The porcine adenovirus type 3 (PAd3) genome between map units 0 and 13.7 was sequenced and compared with similar regions of other adenoviruses. This region consists of the left inverted terminal repeat sequences involved in DNA packaging, the entire early region 1 (E1) and the protein IX (pIX) transcription unit. The lower strand contains the C-terminal end of IVa2 of the E2A transcriptional unit and two novel open reading frames (ORFs). The E1 transcription unit consists of ORFs for proteins homologous to the E1A, E1B-17k and E1B-55k of both human adenovirus type 5 (HAd5) and bovine adenovirus type 3 (BAd3). The predicted PAd3 pIX demonstrated homology with the N-terminal portion of the pIXs of HAd5 and BAd3. On the lower strand, immediately after the putative IVa2 ORF, there are two unique ORFs of 208 and 203 amino acid residues that showed homology with Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigens and other cellular transcription factors.
