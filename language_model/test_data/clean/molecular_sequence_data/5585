The Nef from a highly virulent strain of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), SIVpbj14, and a Nef from the traditional strain SIVmac239 bearing the mutation from RQ to YE (YE-Nef) both induce an acute lethal disease in monkeys. The YE mutation and its surrounding sequence resemble the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), which is present in the cytoplasmic tail of T- and B-cell antigen receptors and mediates signaling during lymphocyte activation. We show here that the ITAM from YE-Nef performs the same function. First, not only does YE-Nef increase the activity of the transcription factor NFAT, which is one of the downstream targets of T-cell activation, but the ITAM from the YE-Nef by itself also activates NFAT. Second, the ITAM from YE-Nef is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by Lck and associates with ZAP-70, a T-cell-specific tyrosine kinase. The phosphorylation of both conserved tyrosine residues on the ITAM is required for the recruitment of ZAP-70. Finally, Lck is required for the activation of NFAT by YE-Nef. These results demonstrate that YE-Nef contains a functional ITAM and elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of SIVpbj14.
