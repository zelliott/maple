The glycoside hydrolase family 57 (GH57) contains α-amylase and a few other amylolytic specificities. It counts ~400 members from Archaea (1/4) and Bacteria (3/4), mostly of extremophilic prokaryotes. Only 17 GH57 enzymes have been biochemically characterized. The main goal of the present bioinformatics study was to analyze sequences having the clear GH57 α-amylase features. Of the 107 GH57 sequences, 59 were evaluated as α-amylases (containing both GH57 catalytic residues), whereas 48 were assigned as GH57 α-amylase-like proteins (having a substitution in one or both catalytic residues). Forty-eight of 59 α-amylases were from Archaea, but 42 of 48 α-amylase-like proteins were of bacterial origin. The catalytic residues were substituted in most cases in Bacteroides and Prevotella by serine (instead of catalytic nucleophile glutamate) and glutamate (instead of proton donor aspartate). The GH57 α-amylase specificity has thus been evolved and kept enzymatically active mainly in Archaea.
