The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is often used to assess the diversity of viral nucleotide sequences present in various biological samples (e.g., blood and tissues). However, it is not clear how reproducible this approach may be. DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of a macaque that had been infected, experimentally, with SIVmac251-32H 6 months previously. The nef gene was then amplified by the PCR on three separate occasions from this same template preparation. A panel of clones was prepared from the product of each PCR, the entire nef gene was sequenced and the sequences obtained compared with each other. Phenogram analysis revealed that within each panel the same degree of sequence diversity was observed between clones. Furthermore, when the sequences obtained from all three panels were compared, the overall sequence diversity observed was no greater than that observed for each panel individually. These data indicate that the analysis of sequence diversity in SIV 'quasi-species' populations by the PCR is reliable and, more important, reproducible.
