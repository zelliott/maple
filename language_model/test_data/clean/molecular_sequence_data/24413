A serodiagnostic ELISA utilizing the recombinant nucleoprotein (rN protein) of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was developed, and evaluated by examining a panel of 141 virus neutralization (VN) positive and 101 negative sera. The rN protein-based ELISA (rnELISA) appeared to be highly sensitive and specific (98.6% and 98.0%, respectively) when it was compared to the VN test. The result was similar to that of an ELISA based on purified viral antigens with showing good correlation (R=0.829). No cross-reaction was detected with antisera against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, hog cholera virus, type A rotavirus, pseudorabies virus and swine vesicular disease virus in this ELISA. The rnELISA can be an alternative for the diagnosis of TGE with a great advantage in antigen preparation.
