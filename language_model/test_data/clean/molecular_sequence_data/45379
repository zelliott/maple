To determine a conclusive phylogeny, equine arteritis viruses from Italy, Austria, Hungary, Sweden, South Africa and other parts of the world were analysed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing. The nucleotide sequences corresponding to the variable part of the large glycoprotein GP5, specified by open reading frame 5, were compared and added to a previously published phylogenetic tree in which a clear division between 'European' and 'American' type viruses had been established. Adding the sequences determined in this study and new sequences retrieved from GenBank revealed additional diversity and new subgroups.
