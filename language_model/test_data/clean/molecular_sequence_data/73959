The 16S rRNA sequences of Chryseomonas luteola, the type species of the genus Chryseomonas, and Flavimonas oryzihabitans, the type species of the genus Flavimonas, were determined. These sequences were compared with the sequences of 27 representative strains of the genus Pseudomonas. C. luteola and F. oryzihabitans were located in the cluster that contains Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the type species of genus Pseudomonas Migula 1894, and the levels of 16S rRNA sequence homology between P. aeruginosa and the other two species were more than 93.9%. All of the strains of the genus Pseudomonas sensu stricto whose sequences have been determined were included in the P. aeruginosa cluster. These results suggested that Chryseomonas, Flavimonas, and Pseudomonas are synonymous, and we concluded that Chryseomonas and Flavimonas are junior subjective synonyms of Pseudomonas.
