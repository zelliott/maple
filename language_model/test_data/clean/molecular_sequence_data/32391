This paper reports the biochemical properties of two types of recombinant flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1) proteins obtained from the thermophilic crenarchaeon, Sulfolobus tokodaii strain 7. One of the two FEN-1 proteins is a product of the gene with AUG as the translational start codon (StoS-FEN-1), which is originally assigned in the database. The other is a product of the gene with a new AUG start codon (StoL-FEN-1), which is inserted at 153 bases upstream of the original AUG codon. Although StoL-FEN-1 showed activity and thermostability, StoS-FEN-1 showed neither activity nor thermostability. The N-terminal region in StoL-FEN-1 was also conserved in all of the FEN-1 homologs deduced from genes from newly isolated Sulfolobus spp. These results strongly suggest that the actual start codon of the fen-1 gene from S. tokodaii is not the originally assigned AUG, but rather is located at about 100 bases upstream of this codon.
