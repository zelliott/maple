Antigen 2 is a glycosylated protein present in the cell walls of the dimorphic fungus Coccidioides immitis. Using oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligo) primers based on the sequences of Ag2 cDNA, the gene encoding Ag2 was cloned from genomic DNA derived from the mycelial phase of C. immitis by PCR. Nucleotide (nt) sequence analyses showed a 582 base pair (bp) ORF disrupted by two introns which are 78 bp and 101 bp long. The deduced primary translation product consists of 194 amino acids (aa), contains an N-terminal putative signal sequence to allow transport into the endoplasmic reticulum, and a C-terminal putative signal sequence to enable a GPI anchor addition. Putative GPI anchor/cleavage site and O-glycosylation sites, as well as phosphorylation and myristoylation sites are also present. On the basis of these analyses, we predict that a prepro-Ag2 undergoes a post-translational modification to yield the mature glycosylated Ag2 protein which is anchored on the extracellular plasma membrane of mycelial and spherule-phase cells.
