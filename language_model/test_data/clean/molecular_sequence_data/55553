Bacillus siamensis KCTC 13613(T), a novel halophilic Bacillus species isolated from a salted Thai food, produced antimicrobial compounds against plant pathogens and promoted plant growth by volatile emission. We determined the 3.8-Mb genome sequence of B. siamensis KCTC 13613(T) to reveal the plant-beneficial effect at the genomic level.
