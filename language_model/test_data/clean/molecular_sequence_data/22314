Centaurin-alpha1 is known to be a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3)-binding protein that has two pleckstrin homology domains and a putative ADP ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein domain. However, the physiological function of centaurin-alpha1 is still not understood. Here we have shown that transient expression of centaurin-alpha1 in COS-7 cells results in specific activation of ERK, and the activation is inhibited by co-expression of a dominant negative form of Ras. We have also found that a mutant form of centaurin-alpha1 that is unable to bind PIP3 fails to induce ERK activation and that a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 inhibits centaurin-alpha1-dependent ERK activation. Furthermore, transient knockdown of centaurin-alpha1 by small interfering RNAs results in reduced ERK activation after epidermal growth factor stimulation in T-REx 293 cells. These results suggest that centaurin-alpha1 contributes to ERK activation in growth factor signaling, linking the PI3K pathway to the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway through its ability to interact with PIP3.
