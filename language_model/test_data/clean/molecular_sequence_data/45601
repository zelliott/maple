Purified DNA from isolates of Penicillium griseofulvum and P. expansum was used as a template to amplify a 600-bp fragment of the isoepoxydon dehydrogenase (idh) gene of the patulin biosynthetic pathway. Primer pairs designed from the P. griseofulvum gene to amplify specific regions of the idh gene yielded similar-sized bands for all strains. Asymmetrical amplification produced DNA products for sequencing and DNA sequences were translated to produce the corresponding amino acid sequences. After removal of two introns present in the region sequenced, amino acid sequences were compared. There were 12 amino acid differences between P. expansum and P. griseofulvum in the coding region. The differences correlated with the amount of patulin previously produced in culture, with strains of P. griseofulvum producing the greatest amounts of patulin.
