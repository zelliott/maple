The DNA replication requirement for vaccinia virus late gene expression was mimicked by transfecting a late promoter-controlled reporter gene into infected cells in the presence of a DNA synthesis inhibitor. This late promoter activation block was overcome by cotransfecting either naked linear vaccinia virion DNA or three cloned viral genes encoding trans-activator polypeptides of 17, 26, and 30 kd. These newly identified trans-activator genes were independently transcribed only from replicated or transfected DNA. These data suggest a regulatory cascade in which the parental viral genome serves as a template for the RNA polymerase and early promoter-specific transcription factors that are packaged in the infectious particle; the newly replicated DNA is accessible to sequentially synthesized intermediate promoter- and late promoter-specific trans-activators.
