Methylation of a base in a specific DNA sequence protects the DNA from nucleolytic cleavage by restriction enzymes recognizing the same sequence. The MboII restriction-modification (R-M) system of Moraxella bovis ATCC 10900 consists of a restriction endonuclease gene and two methyltransferase genes. The enzymes encoded by this system recognize an asymmetrical sequence 5'-GAAGA-3'/3'-CTTCT-5'. M1.MboII modifies the last adenine in the recognition sequence 5'-GAAGA-3' to N(6)-methyladenine. A second methylase, M2.MboII, was cloned and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity using a four-step chromatographic procedure. It was demonstrated that M2.MboII modifies the internal cytosine in the recognition sequence 3'-CTTCT-5', yielding N(4)-methylcytosine, and moreover is able to methylate single-stranded DNA. The protein exists in solution as a monomer of molecular mass 30 000+/-1000 Da under denaturing conditions. Divalent cations (Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Mn(2+) and Zn(2+)) inhibit M2.MboII methylation activity. It was found that the isomethylomer M2.NcuI from Neisseria cuniculi ATCC 14688 behaves in the same manner. Functional analysis showed that the complete MboII R-M system, consisting of two methyltransferases genes and the mboIIR gene, is the most stable and the least harmful to bacterial cells.
