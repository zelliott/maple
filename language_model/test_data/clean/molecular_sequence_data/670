The association of HLA-DRB1 alleles with anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) suggests the potential involvement of T lymphocytes in ACPA-seropositive disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate this hypothesis by systematic histologic and molecular analyses of synovial T cells in ACPA+ versus ACPA- RA patients.

Synovial biopsy samples were obtained from 158 RA patients. Inflammation was determined histologically and immunohistochemically. RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and synovial tissues obtained from 11 ACPA+ RA patients, 7 ACPA- RA patients, and 10 spondylarthritis (SpA) patients (arthritis controls). T lymphocyte clonality was studied by combined quantitative and qualitative T cell receptor CDR3 length distribution (LD) analysis and direct sequencing analysis.

ACPA+ and ACPA- RA patients were similar at both the clinical and histologic levels. At the molecular level, however, patients with ACPA+ synovitis displayed a marked elevation of qualitative CDR3 LD alterations as compared with those with ACPA- synovitis and with the SpA controls. These differences in CDR3 LD were not observed in the peripheral blood, indicating a selective recruitment and/or local expansion of T cells in the synovial compartment. The CDR3 LD alterations reflected true monoclonal or oligoclonal expansions, as confirmed by direct sequencing of the T cell receptor. The CDR3 LD alterations in RA synovium did not correlate with B cell clonal expansions but were inversely associated with synovial lymphoid neogenesis.

The T cell repertoire is specifically restricted in RA patients with ACPA+ synovitis. Whereas the origin and role of these clonal alterations remain to be determined, our data suggest the preferential involvement of T lymphocytes in ACPA-seropositive RA.
