Hereditary hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome (HHCS) is caused by mutations in the regulatory iron responsive element (IRE) in the 5'UTR of the L-ferritin transcript that reduce binding affinity to the iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) and lead to a constitutive upregulation of the protein in tissue and serum. Twenty-nine mutations have been reported within the L-ferritin (FTL) IRE sequence, 21 of which were available to us. In addition, we included in this study three new mutations. Thus, we analyzed 24 mutations spanning over a DNA stretch of 48 nucleotides, including four deletions 2-29 nucleotides long and 20 substitutions, seven of which were conservative transversions. With this unique experimental model we developed a microchip diagnostic platform for identifying known molecular defects in the L-ferritin IRE structure with a microelectronic array approach, which we optimized after studying the effects of various parameters. The system enables electronic deposition of biotinylated amplicons to selected pads. Under optimized conditions, no cross-hybridization was found, even for mutations that affected the same or adjacent nucleotide positions. The same cartridge could be serially hybridized with all the 24 reporter probe sets, which allowed correct genotyping right up until the end of the analysis. Extensive validation on 200 samples in a blinded fashion gave total concordance of results. This pilot study represents a first step toward developing a diagnostic microchip for large-scale analyses for epidemiological studies and screening of mutations associated with iron disorders.
