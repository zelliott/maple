Dimeric transcription factors that bind to DNA are often grouped into families on the basis of dimerization and DNA-binding specificities. cDNA cloning studies have established that members of the same family have structurally related dimerisation and DNA-binding domains but diverge in other regions that are important for transcriptional activation. These features lead to the straightforward suggestion that although all members of a family bind to similar DNA elements, individual members exhibit distinct transcriptional effector functions. This simple view is now supported by experimental evidence from those systems that have proved amenable to study. There are however some largely unaddressed questions that concern the mechanisms that allow family members to go about their business without interference from their highly related siblings. Here I will discuss some insights from studies of the bZIP class of transcription factors.
