The transcriptional factor nuclear factor kappa-beta (NFKB) consists of a multicomponent protein complex that plays a major role in the regulation of many viral and cellular genes. The NFKB complex has two alternative DNA binding subunits. We isolated a polymorphic dinucleotide (CA) repeat sequence from a genomic clone containing the NFKB subunit 1 (NFKB1) gene located at 4q23-24. High heterozygosity (0.813) makes this polymorphism a useful marker in the genetic study of disorders affecting the immune response and cell differentiation.
