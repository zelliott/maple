Three families of tandemly repetitive DNA from Crepis capillaris were cloned and characterized. Data obtained from in situ hybridization indicate that these families are located mainly in the heterochromatic C-bands. The pCcH32 family hybridizes at the paracentromeric C-band of the NOR (nucleolus-organized region) chromosome and along most of the long arm of the same chromosome. The pCcD29 family is located in all the remaining C-bands of the karyotype, while the third family, pCcE9, is restricted to the more proximal C-bands. Nucleotide sequence comparisons between one cloned repeating unit from each DNA family showed some significant regions of homology between the families. We discuss the sequence relationships between the three DNA families and the significance of our data in relation to models of heterochromatin evolution, emphasizing the concepts of equilocality and the differentiation of the NOR-bearing chromosome. We also examine the possible role that chromosome disposition, in either mitotic or meiotic nuclei, plays in the distribution and homogenization of heterochromatic DNA sequences.
