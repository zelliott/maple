A Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides was isolated from goat's milk on the basis of its ability to inhibit the growth of Listeria monocytogenes. The antimicrobial effect was due to the presence in the culture medium of a compound, named mesentericin Y105, excreted by the Leuconostoc mesenteroides Y105. The compound displayed known features of bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria. It appeared as a proteinaceous molecule exhibiting a narrow inhibitory spectrum limited to genus Listeria. The apparent relative molecular mass, as indicated by activity detection after SDS-PAGE, was 2.5-3.0 kDa. The bacteriocin was purified to homogeneity by a simple three-step procedure: a crude supernatant obtained from an early-stationary-phase culture in a defined medium was subjected to affinity chromatography on a blue agarose column, followed by ultrafiltration through a 5 kDa cut-off membrane, and finally by reverse-phase HPLC on a C4 column. Microsequencing of the pure bacteriocin and of tryptic fragments showed that mesentericin Y105 is a 36 amino acid polypeptide whose primary structure is close to that of leucocin A-UAL 187, which contains an extra residue at the C-terminus and displays only two differences in the overlapping sequence. However, unlike leucocin A-UAL 187, mesentericin Y105 displayed a bactericidal mode of action.
