A recombinant Escherichia coli strain was constructed for the overexpression of bovine placental lactogen (bPL), using a bPL structural gene containing 9 of the rare arginine codons AGA and AGG. When high level bPL synthesis was induced in this strain, cell growth was inhibited and bPL accumulated to less than 10% of total cell protein. In addition, about 2% of the recombinant bPL produced from this strain exhibited an altered trypsin digestion pattern. Amino acid residues 74 through 109 normally produce 2 tryptic peptides, but the altered form of bPL lacked these two peptides and instead had a new peptide which was missing arginine residue 86 and one of the two flanking leucine residues. The codon for arginine residue 86 was AGG and the codons for the flanking leucine residues 85 and 87 were TTG. When 5 of the 9 AGA and AGG codons in the bPL structural gene were changed to more preferred arginine codons, cell growth was not inhibited and bPL accumulated to about 30% of total cell protein. When bPL was purified from this modified strain, which included changing the arginine codon at position 86 from AGG to CGT, none of the altered form of bPL was produced. These observations are consistent with a model in which translational pausing occurs at the arginine residue 86 AGG codon because the corresponding arginyl-tRNA species is reduced by the high level of bPL synthesis, and a translational hop occurs from the leucine residue 85 TTG codon to the leucine residue 87 TTG codon. This observation represents the first report of an error in protein synthesis due to an in-frame translational hop within an open reading frame.
