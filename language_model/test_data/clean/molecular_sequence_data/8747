fgf3 has been implicated in the embryonic and fetal development of the mouse and as an oncogene in murine breast cancer. We describe a procedure to purify the product of the mouse fgf3 gene and show it to be a potent mitogen for some epithelial cell lines. Using a receptor binding competition assay, Fgf3 was shown to bind with high affinity to the IIIb isoforms of Fgf receptor (FgfR) 1 and FgfR2 (ID50 = approximately 0.8 nM) and with a lower affinity to the IIIc variant of FgfR2 (ID50 = approximately 9 nM). No competition for the binding of 125I-Fgf1 was observed for FgfR1 (IIIc), FgfR3 (IIIb and IIIc), or FgfR4. Mitogenicity assays using BaF3 cells containing individual Fgf receptors showed a pattern of response in agreement with the receptor binding results. A comparison of two mammary epithelial cell lines showed a marked difference of potency and dependence upon heparin in their response to mouse Fgf3, suggesting a complex interaction between the ligand and its low and high affinity receptors.
