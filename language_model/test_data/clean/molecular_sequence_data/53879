The hic-5 gene encodes a focal adhesion protein that has striking similarity to paxillin. Genomic clones of the mouse hic-5 gene were isolated, and included 10 exons that covered the whole mouse mRNA sequence. Comparison of the sequence with those in the expressed sequence tag database suggested that the hic-5 gene contained an extra exon (named exon 1') located about 1kb upstream of exon 1, and mouse cells seemed to express two alternatively spliced forms of mRNA. All the exon-intron boundaries followed the GT/AG rule. Physical mapping and fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis indicated that the hic-5 gene is located on mouse chromosome 7, 60. 0cM from the centromere.
