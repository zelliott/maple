In rhizobia, besides the constitutive acyl carrier protein (AcpP) involved in the biosynthesis and transfer of common fatty acids, there are at least three specialized acyl carrier proteins (ACPs): (1) the flavonoid-inducible nodulation protein NodF; (2) the RkpF protein, which is required for the biosynthesis of rhizobial capsular polysaccharides; and (3) AcpXL, which transfers 27-hydroxyoctacosanoic acid to a sugar backbone during lipid A biosynthesis. Whereas the nucleotide sequences encoding the three specialized ACPs are known, only the amino acid sequence of the AcpP of Sinorhizobium meliloti was available. In this study, using reverse genetics, the genes for the constitutive AcpPs of S. meliloti and of Rhizobium leguminosarum were cloned and sequenced. Previously, it had been shown that NodF and RkpF can be overproduced in Escherichia coli using the T7 polymerase expression system. Using the same system, the constitutive AcpPs of S. meliloti and of R. leguminosarum, together with the specialized ACP AcpXL, were overproduced and purified. All the known ACPs of rhizobia can be labelled in vivo during expression in E. coli with radioactive beta-alanine added to the growth medium due to their modification with a 4'-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group. The availability of all functionally different ACPs should help to unravel how different fatty acids are targeted towards different biosynthetic pathways in one organism.
