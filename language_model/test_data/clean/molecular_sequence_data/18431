The glucitol operon in Escherichia coli is known to consist of five structural genes with the order: gut O P A B D M R. We have sequenced downstream from gutR and have identified an open reading frame encoding a water-soluble protein (223 amino acids; molecular weight = 23,562) with a putative ATP binding site. Expression of this protein in a maxicell system has been demonstrated. A repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) sequence capable of forming stem-loop structures follows gutQ in the downstream, presumptive intercistronic region. The function of the Gut Q protein is not known.
