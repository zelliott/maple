A transposon, designated Tn5469, was isolated from mutant strain FdR1 of the filamentous cyanobacterium Fremyella diplosiphon following its insertion into the rcaC gene. Tn5469 is a 4,904-bp noncomposite transposon with 25-bp near-perfect terminal inverted repeats and has three tandemly arranged, slightly overlapping potential open reading frames (ORFs) encoding proteins of 104.6 kDa (909 residues), 42.5 kDa (375 residues), and 31.9 kDa (272 residues). Insertion of Tn5469 into the rcaC gene in strain FdR1 generated a duplicate 5-bp target sequence. On the basis of amino acid sequence identifies, the largest ORF, designated tnpA, is predicted to encode a composite transposase protein. A 230-residue domain near the amino terminus of the TnpA protein has 15.4% amino acid sequence identity with a corresponding domain for the putative transposase encoded by Lactococcus lactis insertion sequence S1 (ISS1). In addition, the sequence for the carboxyl-terminal 600 residues of the TnpA protein is 20.0% identical to that for the TniA transposase encoded by Tn5090 on Klebsiella aerogenes plasmid R751. The TnpA and TniA proteins contain the D,D(35)E motif characteristic of a recently defined superfamily consisting of bacterial transposases and integrase proteins of eukaryotic retroelements and retrotransposons. The two remaining ORFs on Tn5469 encode proteins of unknown function. Southern blot analysis showed that wild-type F. diplosiphon harbors five genomic copies of Tn5469. In comparison, mutant strain FdR1 harbors an extra genomic copy of Tn5469 which was localized to the inactivated rcaC gene. Among five morphologically distinct cyanobacterial strains examined, none was found to contain genomic sequences homologous to Tn5469.
