Pfs16 is a sexual stage/sporozoite-specific antigen of Plasmodium falciparum and is a potential candidate for a sporozoite-neutralizing vaccine. To obtain more information on the function of Pfs16 and to investigate its role during transmission and hepatocyte invasion, immunization experiments were performed with both a Pfs16-specific recombinant vaccinia virus and virus-like particles produced in yeast composed of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antigen Pfs16 fused to HBsAg. Upon transformation of yeast cells, harbouring a genomic copy of the HBsAg gene, with a plasmid carrying the fusion gene Pfs16-HBsAg (Pfs16-S) virus-like hybrid particles composed of HBsAg and Pfs16-S were formed of a size similar to those present in human sera after infection with the hepatitis B virus. Cells infected with recombinant Pfs16 vaccinia virus synthesized a polypeptide of approx. 16 kDa that reacted with a Pfs16-specific polyclonal antibody. Animals vaccinated with the yeast hybrid particles and/or recombinant vaccinia virus both produced Pfs16-specific antibodies. These antibodies showed no transmission-blocking activity, but they efficiently diminished or abolished in vitro invasion of sporozoites into human hepatoma cells (HepG2-A16) and primary human hepatocytes.
