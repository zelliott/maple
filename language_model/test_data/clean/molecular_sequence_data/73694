A small-subunit ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene lineage (SAR324) affiliated with the delta-subdivision of the class Proteobacteria (DP) was discovered in a 16S rRNA gene clone library prepared from a water sample collected from 250 m in the western Sargasso Sea. This clone library of nearly full-length amplicons of bacterial 16S rRNA genes has been the subject of previous studies aimed at identifying bacteria that inhibit the lower ocean surface layer. The novel lineage was identified by randomly sequencing clones that did not hybridize to oligonucleotide probes specific for several abundant bacterioplankton groups identified in previous studies. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that SAR324 was most closely affiliated with the DP, although it showed no specific relationship to any DP 16S rRNA genes in databases. Eight of the clones in the library of 148 clones were identified as members of the SAR324 lineage by hybridization to an oligonucleotide probe specific for SAR324. Subsequent hybridizations showed that the SAR324 group is stratified in the lower surface layer of both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, with maxima between 160 and 500 m. The repeated discovery of sequences belonging to different gene clusters with similar distributions in this region of the water column suggests that microbial communities in the lower surface layer may be functionally specialized.
