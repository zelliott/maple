Using semiempirical conformational analysis method, the spatial structure and conformational properties of the sea-whale somatotropin lipotropic action were investigated. The calculations were based on the fragmental analysis using non-valent, electrostatic interactions, torsional barriers and hydrogen bonds. The computer data suggest that this molecule can exist only in several low energy conformational states. The experimental results can be used for the analysis of structural-and-functional relationships.
