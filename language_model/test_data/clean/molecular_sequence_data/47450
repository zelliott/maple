We have shown that the thymopoietin-like octapeptides derived from DNA-binding domain of p53 protein and of its mutated forms differ in their immunomodulatory properties. A strong increase of immunostimulative activity was observed for GMNRSPIL (mutated protein) in comparison with GMNRRPIL (wild-type of p53 protein) peptide. Here the elongated sequences of respective protein fragments were synthesized and investigated by plaque forming cells and delayed type hypersensitivity tests. The change of immunomodulatory activity toward immunosuppression was observed: NSSC(Acm)MGGMNRRPILTIITLE (1, wild-type) was inactive in both tests, and the C(Acm)MGGMNRSPILTIITLE (II) and YMC(Acm)NSSC(Acm)MGGMNRSPILTIITLE (III) (mutated p53 protein fragments) peptides produced immunosuppression in plaque forming cells as well as in delayed type hypersensitivity tests.
