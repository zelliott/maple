Transcription and translation inhibitors have been used to investigate the role of mRNA stability in the low-temperature-regulated expression of the post-transcriptionally controlled low temperature responsive barley gene family, blt14. Genomic clones (blt14.1, blt14.2) representing additional members of the blt14 gene family have been isolated and sequenced. Gene specific probes have been used to analyse the spatial expression of each individual member of the blt14 gene family. Findings indicate that all of the genes are responsive to low temperature, but the organ distribution is different for each gene. The results indicate that blt14.0 mRNA is stabilised by a low-temperature-dependent protein factor. Taken together, the results suggest that organ-specific post-transcriptional mechanisms are important in the low-temperature regulation of blt14 gene expression.
