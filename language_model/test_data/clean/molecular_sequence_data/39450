Because no biomarker that reflects small bowel allograft rejection is available, we applied surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) to develop noninvasive markers required for routine diagnosis.

Heterotopic small bowel transplantation (SBT) was performed in rats, and they were divided into four experimental groups: sham-operated rats (sham), syngeneic transplants (syngeneic), allogeneic transplants (allogeneic), allogeneic transplants received FK506 (allo+FK). Plasma samples were analyzed with SELDI ProteinChip arrays to detect peaks that predominated in the allogeneic model. Possible biomarkers were identified in combination with SELDI retentate chromatography mass spectrometry (RCMS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The identified protein was further analyzed by immunohistochemistry.

An increase in the level of a 14.8-kDa protein, identified as lysozyme, was observed specifically in the plasma of the allogeneic group; the levels of this protein remained unchanged in the plasma of the other groups. On the other hand, the levels of a 10.1-kDa and a 13.0-kDa protein, identified as migration inhibitory factor-related proteins (MRP), MRP-8 and MRP-14, respectively, began to increase from an early stage of acute rejection. We also observed that lysozyme-positive macrophages had strongly infiltrated the lamina propria during acute rejection.

We identified three plasma proteins-MRP-8, MRP-14, and lysozyme-that increased during small bowel allograft rejection. The identified proteins appeared to be markers for inflammation associated with allograft rejection. This proteomic approach will be useful for the identification of candidate biomarkers.
