An antibody was developed against a 23-kDa fragment of myosin which contains a part of the ATP-binding site, and applied to skinned muscle fibers. The antibody abolished active tension generation of the fibers, but did not block their assumption of a rigor state nor their release from this state by ATP. The primary amino acid sequence of the antigenic site on the fragment was found to be the region containing residues 77-80. This sequence region is predicted to have interesting secondary structures, and is distinct from the proposed ATP-binding site. We discuss the possibility that the region is responsible for the energy-transducing step in muscle contraction.
