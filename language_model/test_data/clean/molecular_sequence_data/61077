We report the cloning, functional expression and cell-specific localization of the rat homologue of the prostaglandin D2 receptor (DP). In situ hybridization, utilizing multiple digoxigenin-labelled riboprobes and their complementary sense controls, was performed to determine the detailed distribution of DP receptor mRNA in the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. Within the brain, the leptomeninges and choroid plexus expressed DP receptor mRNA. Transcripts detected in the spinal cord were localized to the sensory and motor neurons of the dorsal and ventral horns, respectively, suggesting a role for the DP receptor in the modulation of central nervous system processes, including pain transmission. Within the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, duodenum, ileum and colon) signals were highly localized to the mucous-secreting goblet cells and the columnar epithelium. These findings suggest a novel biological role for prostaglandin D2-mediated activity at the DP receptor, namely mucous secretion. In addition, radioligand binding assays (saturation analyses and equilibrium competition assays) and functional assays (measuring cAMP accumulation) were performed to characterize the recombinant rat DP receptor expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293(EBNA) cells. A single site of binding (K(D) = 14 nM, Bmax = 115 fmol/mg protein) was measured for prostaglandin D2-specific binding to the rat DP receptor. Prostaglandin D2 proved to be a potent agonist at the rat DP receptor (EC50 = 5 nM). The rank order of efficacy for DP receptor specific agonists [prostaglandin D2 = prostaglandin J2 = BW 245C (5-(6-carboxyhexyl)-1-(3-cyclohexyl-3-hydroxypropylhydantoin)) > L-644,698 ((4-(3-(3-(3-hydroxyoctyl)-4-oxo-2-thiazolidinyl) propyl) benzoic acid) (racemate)] reflected the affinity with which the ligands bound to the receptor.
