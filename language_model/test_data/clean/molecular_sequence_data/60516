Infection of Nicotiana tabacum Samsun NN with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) results in a hypersensitive plant response and leads to systemic acquired resistance (SAR). The induction of SAR is mediated by the plant hormone salicylic acid (SA) and is accompanied by the induced expression of a number of genes including the pathogenesis-related (PR) gene 1a. Previously, it has been found that TMV infection and SA treatment resulted in a reduction of binding of nuclear protein GT-1 to far-upstream regions (-902 to -656) of the PR-1a gene. To test if GT-1 is a negative regulator of PR-1a gene expression, the effects of mutations in the seven putative GT-1 binding sites in this region were studied in vitro using dimethyl sulfate interference footprinting and band shift assays. This showed that at least one of the seven sites is indeed a GT-1 binding site. However, when tested in transgenic plants, the mutations did not result in constitutive expression of the chimeric PR-1a/GUS transgene, while inducible expression after SA treatment was decreased. The results suggest that binding of GT-1-like proteins to far-upstream PR-1a promoter regions indeed influences gene expression. A possible model for GT-1's mode of action in PR-1a gene expression is discussed.
