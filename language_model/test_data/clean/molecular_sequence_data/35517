In this work, to explain doping behavior of single-layer graphene upon HSSYWYAFNNKT (P1) and HSSAAAAFNNKT (P1-3A) adsorption in field-effect transistors (GFETs), we applied a combined computational approach, whereby peptide adsorption was modeled by molecular dynamics simulations, and the lowest energy configuration was confirmed by density functional theory calculations. On the basis of the resulting structures of the hybrid materials, electronic structure and transport calculations were investigated. We demonstrate that π-π stacking of the aromatic residues and proximate peptide backbone to the graphene surface in P1 have a role in the p-doping. These results are consistent with our experimental observation of the GFET's p-doping even after a 24-h annealing procedure. Upon substitution of three of the aromatic residues to Ala in (P1-3A), a considerable decrease from p-doping is observed experimentally, demonstrating n-doping as compared to the nonadsorbed device, yet not explained based on the atomistic MD simulation structures. To gain a qualitative understanding of P1-3A's adsorption over a longer simulation time, which may differ from aromatic amino acid residues' swift anchoring on the surface, we analyzed equilibrated coarse-grain simulations performed for 500 ns. Desorption of the Ala residues from the surface was shown computationally, which could in turn affect charge transfer, yet a full explanation of the mechanism of n-doping will require elucidation of differences between various aromatic residues as dependent on peptide composition, and inclusion of effects of the substrate and environment, to be considered in future work.
