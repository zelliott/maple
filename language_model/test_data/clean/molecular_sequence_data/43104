The glutamine synthetase (GS) gene family of Medicago truncatula Gaertn. contains three genes related to cytosolic GS (MtGSa, MtGSb, and MtGSc), although one of these (MtGSc) appears not to be expressed. Sequence analysis suggests that the genes are more highly conserved interspecifically rather than intraspecifically: MtGSa and MtGSb are more similar to their homologs in Medicago sativa and Pisum sativum than to each other. Studies in which gene-specific probes are used show that both MtGSa and MtGSb are induced during symbiotic root nodule development, although not coordinately. MtGSa is the most highly expressed GS gene in nodules but is also expressed to lower extents in a variety of other organs. MtGSb shows higher levels of expression in roots and the photosynthetic cotyledons of seedlings than in nodules or other organs. In roots, both genes are expressed in the absence of an exogenous nitrogen source. However the addition of nitrate leads to a short-term, 2- to 3-fold increase in the abundance of both mRNAs, and the addition of ammonium leads to a 2-fold increase in MtGSb mRNA. The nitrogen supply, therefore, influences the expression of the two genes in roots, but it is clearly not the major effector of their expression. In the discussion section, the expression of the GS gene family of the model legume M. truncatula is compared to those of other leguminous plants.
