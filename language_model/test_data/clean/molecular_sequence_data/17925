Studies with the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) have shown that the endoplasmic reticulum, or an organelle closely associated with it, can retain and degrade membrane proteins selectively. The observation that only three (alpha, beta, and delta) of the six (alpha beta gamma delta epsilon zeta) subunits of the TCR are susceptible to proteolysis implies that structural features within the labile proteins mark them for degradation. The TCR beta chain is degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum, and, in this study, we have started to define the domains of the protein that make it susceptible to proteolysis. The experiments show that the transmembrane anchor and short five-amino-acid cytoplasmic tail of the protein contain a dominant determinant of proteolysis. When these residues were removed from the beta chain, the protein became resistant to proteolysis. Even though the resulting ectodomain of the beta chain lacked a transmembrane anchor, it was not secreted by cells and was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. We conclude that retention in the endoplasmic reticulum alone does not lead to degradation. The results suggest that structural features within the membrane anchor of the protein predispose the beta chain to proteolysis. This was confirmed by replacing the membrane anchor of the interleukin 2 (IL2) receptor, a protein that was stable within the secretory pathway, with that of the TCR beta chain. The unmodified IL2 receptor was transported efficiently to the surface of cells, and an "anchor minus" construct was secreted quantitatively into the culture media. When the membrane anchor of the IL2 receptor was replaced with that of the TCR beta chain, the chimera was unable to reach the Golgi apparatus and was degraded rapidly.
