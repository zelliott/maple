Polyphosphate kinase (PPK) catalyzes the reversible transfer of the terminal phosphate of ATP to form a long-chain polyphosphate (polyP) (Ahn, K., and Kornberg, A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 11734-11739). The Escherichia coli gene (ppk) encoding PPK has been cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed (about 100-fold). The gene possesses an open reading frame for 687 amino acids (mass of 80,278 Da). PPK has been purified from overproducing cells after release from attachment to the cell outer membrane; the purified soluble PPK reassociate with cell membrane fractions. About 850 molecules of PPK are found in a wild type cell.
