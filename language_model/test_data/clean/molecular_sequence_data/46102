The classical view on how peptides enter cells has been changed due to the development in the research field of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). During the last 15 years, more than 100 peptide sequences have been published to enter cells and also to bring different biological cargoes with them. Here, we present an overview of CPPs, mainly trying to analyze their common properties yielding the prediction of their cell-penetrating properties. Furthermore, examples of recent research, ideas on classification and uptake mechanisms, as well as a summary of the therapeutic potential of CPPs are presented.
