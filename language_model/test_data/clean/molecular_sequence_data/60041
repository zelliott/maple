Aminoglycoside antibiotics can target RNA folds with micromolar affinity and inhibit biological processes ranging from protein biosynthesis to ribozyme action and viral replication. Specific features of aminoglycoside antibiotic-RNA recognition have been probed using chemical, biochemical, spectroscopic and computational approaches on both natural RNA targets and RNA aptamers identified through in vitro selection. Our previous studies on tobramycin-RNA aptamer complexes are extended to neomycin B bound to its selected RNA aptamer with 100 nM affinity.

The neamine moiety (rings I and II) of neomycin B is sandwiched between the major groove floor of a 'zippered-up' G.U mismatch aligned segment and a looped-out purine base that flaps over the bound antibiotic. Specific intermolecular hydrogen bonds are observed between the charged amines of neomycin B and base mismatch edges and backbone phosphates. These interactions anchor 2-deoxystreptamine ring I and pyranose ring II within the RNA-binding pocket.

The RNA aptamer complexes with tobramycin and neomycin B utilize common architectural principles to generate RNA-binding pockets for the bound aminoglycoside antibiotics. In each case, the 2-deoxystreptamine ring I and an attached pyranose ring are encapsulated within the major groove binding pocket, which is lined with mismatch pairs. The bound antibiotic within the pocket is capped over by a looped-out base and anchored in place through intermolecular hydrogen bonds involving charged amine groups of the antibiotic.
