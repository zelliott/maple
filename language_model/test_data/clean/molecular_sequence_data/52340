A mismatch-binding protein has been purified an estimated 4500-fold from HeLa nuclear extracts using four different chromatographic steps. Two polypeptides of apparent molecular weight of 160,000 and 100,000 were present in the final affinity-purified fraction as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Partial proteolytic clipping of the protein-DNA complexes visualized after UV treatment indicated that the 100-kDa polypeptide is most likely a degradation product of the 160-kDa polypeptide. UV cross-linking experiments have shown that both these polypeptides bind specifically to oligonucleotide duplexes containing G/T mismatches. Direct DNA binding studies and band-shift competition assays showed that although the mismatch-binding protein binds with highest affinity to oligonucleotides containing G/T mismatches, it is also capable of binding to oligonucleotides containing other mispairs. The purified protein has an associated Mg(2+)-dependent ATPase activity, which is markedly enhanced in the presence of single-stranded DNA. A helicase capable of unwinding a 34-mer oligonucleotide, annealed to a complementary sequence in single-stranded M13, also copurified with the mismatch-binding protein. This reaction occurs in an ATP- and magnesium-dependent manner.
