In this study, the evolutionary history of the variable second exon of RT1.Ba and its adjoining intron b are compared across a number of species and subspecies of the Australian RATTUS: Three lineages are identified in the second intron across a range of Rattus species. Two of these lineages, separated by the insertion of a probable rodent short interspersed nucleotide element and by point mutations outside the indel region, are both found in each of the major clades of the endemic Australian RATTUS: This pattern of ancestral polymorphism is reflected in the adjoining exon 2 sequences, although phylogenetic constraints confirm that the clustering is not identical to that of the associated intron sequences. In addition, the coding sequences show evidence of the retention of ancestral polymorphism, with identical exon sequences found in two divergent species, and some indication of gene conversion detected for the exon sequences.
