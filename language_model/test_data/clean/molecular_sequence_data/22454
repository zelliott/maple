Thymic MALT lymphoma shows certain distinctive features among MALT lymphomas, such as expression of IgA isotype, consistent lack of API2-MALT1 gene fusion, and very strong association with autoimmune disease, especially Sjogren's syndrome. To help clarify the nature of the clonal lymphoid infiltrates, we analysed the usage and somatic hypermutation of the Ig heavy chain variable region (V(H)) genes in nine different cases. The V(H) rearrangement was potentially functional in all cases and was restricted to the V(H)3 family. V(H) usage was biased toward V(H)3-30 (five cases) and V(H)3-23 (three cases) segments, which have both been frequently expressed by autoimmune B cells. Somatic hypermutation was absent in five cases. Fewer than the expected replacement mutations were found in the framework regions in two cases, indicating a negative antigen selection pressure. Ongoing mutation was absent in all cases. D segment usage was varied, whereas J(H) segment usage was restricted to J(H)4. The observed patterns of V(H) usage and mutations suggested that specific antigens may play a pathologically relevant role in the genesis or progression of thymic MALT lymphoma.
