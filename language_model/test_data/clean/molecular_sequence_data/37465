Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a type C human retrovirus and is the causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia and other diseases. The enzymatic and structural proteins of HTLV-I are synthesized as part of a Gag-Pro-Pol precursor polyprotein, and the mature proteins are released by proteolytic processing catalyzed by HTLV-I protease. The locations of most of the proteolytic cleavage sites are known, however, the site that creates the N-terminus of HTLV-1 integrase has not been previously identified. A 15 residue peptide corresponding to junction of the C-terminus of RNaseH and N-terminus of integrase (DALLITPVLQLSPAF-OH) was incubated with HTLV-1 protease. Analysis of the cleavage products by LC-MS revealed fragments Ac-DALLITPVLQL-OH and H(2)N-SPAF-OH were produced, indicating cleavage between the leucine and serine. This is the first physical identification of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the integrase of HTLV-1.
