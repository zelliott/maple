The taxonomic position of an actinomycete, strain K07-23T, isolated from a cold desert of the Himalayas, India, was established by a polyphasic approach. The strain exhibited phenotypic characters that were typical of the genus Rhodococcus. 16S rRNA gene sequence (1467 bases) comparisons confirmed that strain K07-23T belongs to the genus Rhodococcus. 16S rRNA sequence similarity studies showed that the isolate is very closely related to Nocardia corynebacterioides DSM 20151T (98.6 %), which has been recently reclassified as Rhodococcus corynebacterioides. It showed 94.4-96.6 % sequence similarity with other species of the genus Rhodococcus. However, genomic relatedness between strain K07-23T and R. corynebacterioides as revealed by DNA-DNA hybridization was low (62 %). Based on polyphasic analysis, strain K07-23T could be clearly distinguished from other species. It is proposed that strain K07-23T (=MTCC 6634T=DSM 44908T=JCM 13011T) represents a novel species of Rhodococcus, Rhodococcus kroppenstedtii sp. nov.
