A critical role for the conserved alpha-integrin cytoplasmic motif, KVGFFKR, is recognized in the regulation of activation of the platelet integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3). To understand the molecular mechanisms of this regulation, we sought to determine the nature of the protein interactions with this cytoplasmic motif. We used a tagged synthetic peptide, biotin-KVGFFKR, to probe a high density protein expression array (37,200 recombinant human proteins) for high affinity interactions. A number of potential integrin-binding proteins were identified. One such protein, a chloride channel regulatory protein, ICln, was characterized further because its affinity for the integrin peptide was highest as was its expression in platelets. We verified the presence of ICln in human platelets by PCR, Western blots, immunohistochemistry, and its co-association with alpha(IIb)beta(3) by surface plasmon resonance. The affinity of this interaction was 82.2 +/- 24.4 nm in a cell free assay. ICln co-immunoprecipitates with alpha(IIb)beta(3) in platelet lysates demonstrating that this interaction is physiologically relevant. Furthermore, immobilized KVGFFKR peptides, but not control KAAAAAR peptides, specifically extract ICln from platelet lysates. Acyclovir (100 microm to 5 mm), a pharmacological inhibitor of the ICln chloride channel, specifically inhibits integrin activation (PAC-1 expression) and platelet aggregation without affecting CD62 P expression confirming a specific role for ICln in integrin activation. In parallel, a cell-permeable peptide corresponding to the potential integrin-recognition domain on ICln (AKFEEE, 10-100 microm) also inhibits platelet function. Thus, we have identified, verified, and characterized a novel functional interaction between the platelet integrin and ICln, in the platelet membrane.
