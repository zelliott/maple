The liver is the first target organ for malaria parasites immediately after the bite of an infected mosquito. We studied local immunization of malaria DNA vaccines at the site of the liver using a gene gun as a useful tool for in vivo transfection of foreign genes. A malaria DNA vaccine consisting of the Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein (PbCSP) gene plus the mouse IL-12 gene was bombarded directly by a gene gun into mouse liver once or into the skin twice. A marked protective effect was induced by gene bombardment into the liver (more than 71%) compared with that into the skin (less than 33%). A Th1-type immune response and high production of iNOS were observed in the hepatic lymphocytes from mice bombarded into the liver, resulting in more effective protection compared with those bombarded into the skin. These results provide an important implication on the development of efficient malaria vaccine strategies.
