We have sequenced a segment of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of a crustacean, the brine shrimp, Artemia salina, that includes 3' end-proximal regions of the genes for subunit 1 of the NADH dehydrogenase complex (ND1) and cytochrome b (Cyt b). From our data we conclude that in this mtDNA, as in the mtDNAs of Drosophila species, a tRNA(Ser)(UCN) gene separates the ND1 and Cyt b genes. This is contrary to an earlier report that the A. salina ND1 and Cyt b genes are immediately adjacent to each other.
