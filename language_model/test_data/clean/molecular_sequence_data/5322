The aim of the present study was to identify specific, novel germ cell markers that could be used to monitor normal and abnormal spermatogenesis. Of several cloned cDNAs isolated from an adult rat testis cDNA library using an expression screening strategy, clone 813B4 (700 base pairs) hybridized exclusively to three mRNA transcripts in samples isolated from rat testes on and after Day 21 of life and to epididymides from some, but not all, adult rats. After further screening, two identical clones encoding a 2.2-kilobase cDNA (KTT4) were isolated and found to contain an open reading frame of 578 amino acids including two leucine zipper motifs. On Northern blots, KTT4 mRNA was abundant in samples from round spermatids, and homologous mRNAs were present in testes from mice and marmosets. A zoo blot revealed that the KTT4 gene is conserved in humans, monkeys, mice, dogs, and cattle. On sections of rat testes, KTT4 mRNA was first detectable in pachytene spermatocytes at stage VII and thereafter was abundant in round and elongating spermatids until step 15. Expression of KTT4 was not altered by ethane dimethane sulphonate-induced androgen withdrawal, but in rats treated 14 days previously with methoxyacetic acid, a marked reduction in KTT4 was noted associated with the depletion of round spermatids. In conclusion, the present study identified a conserved gene expressed in meiotic and post-meiotic germ cells; database searches have shown it to be homologous to recently published sequences for an outer dense fiber protein of the sperm tail (Odf2/Odf84).
