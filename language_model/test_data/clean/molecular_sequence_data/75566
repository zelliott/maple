The nucleotide sequence of the fabA gene encoding beta-hydroxydecanoyl thioester dehydrase, a key enzyme of the unsaturated fatty acid synthesis pathway of Escherichia coli, has been determined by the dideoxynucleotide sequencing technique. Most of the sequence was obtained by sequencing intragenic insertions of the transposon, Tn1000, isolated in vivo. A synthetic primer complementary to a portion of the inverted repeat sequences at the ends of the transposon was used to prime DNA synthesis into the flanking fabA sequences. The gene is composed of 516 nucleotides (171 amino acid residues) encoding a protein with a molecular weight of 18,800. Approximately half of the derived amino acid sequence was confirmed by automated Edman sequencing of peptides obtained by cyanogen bromide cleavage. The active site histidine residue (His-70) has been identified by analysis of the peptides labeled by reaction with 14C-labeled 3-decynoyl-N-acetylcysteamine, a specific mechanism-activated inhibitor. A cysteine residue (Cys-69) adjacent to the active site histidine may play the role in catalysis previously assigned to a tyrosine residue. We also report a simplified purification process for the dehydrase beginning with extracts of a brain which greatly overproduces the enzyme.
