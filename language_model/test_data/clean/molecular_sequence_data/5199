Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a recently identified human protein kinase that has been implicated in integrin-mediated signal transduction and tumorigenesis. We have identified a mouse molecule that is highly homologous to human ILK. The mouse ILK homologue protein is readily recognized by antibodies raised against the human ILK protein, and the gene encoding the mouse ILK homologue is widely expressed in mouse tissues. The mouse ILK homologue gene has been mapped to chromosome 7E1 band. A second locus in the mouse chromosome 9E1-3 region has also been detected with a mouse ILK homologue cDNA probe by fluorescence in situ hybridization, suggesting the possible existence of an ILK pseudo-gene or a family of ILK genes in the mouse.
