Plants exhibit various defense responses after recognizing elicitor molecules derived from pathogenic microorganisms and host plants. In this study, we developed an improved colorimetric assay for quantifying the generation of H2O2 in plant cells, one of the defense responses, to evaluate elicitor activity quantitatively. H2O2 is detected using a dye, N-(carboxymethylaminocarbonyl)-4,4'-bis(dimethylamino)-diphenylamine sodium salt (DA-64), which can be measured by conventional spectrometers in a highly sensitive and quantitative manner. Using this method, we successfully measured the elicitor activity of flagellin-derived peptides in cultured tobacco cells, and identified several structural features of the peptides important for the elicitor activity. The results suggest that the structural factors required for expression of the elicitor activity differ slightly among plant species. The efficient and sensitive assay developed in this study should be useful not only for studying structure-activity relationships, but also for the screening of novel compounds that can induce defense responses.
