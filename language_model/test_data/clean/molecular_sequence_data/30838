Broad-host-range plasmid RK2 encodes several kil operons (kilA, kilB, kilC, kilE) whose expression is potentially lethal to Escherichia coli host cells. The kil operons and the RK2 replication initiator gene (trfA) are coregulated by various combinations of kor genes (korA, korB, korC, korE). This regulatory network is called the kil-kor regulon. Presented here are studies on the structure, product, and expression of korC. Genetic mapping revealed the precise location of korC in a region near transposon Tn1. We determined the nucleotide sequence of this region and identified the korC structural gene by analysis of korC mutants. Sequence analysis predicts the korC product to be a polypeptide of 85 amino acids with a molecular mass of 9,150 daltons. The KorC polypeptide was identified in vivo by expressing wild-type and mutant korC alleles from a bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase-dependent promoter. The predicted structure of KorC polypeptide has a net positive charge and a helix-turn-helix region similar to those of known DNA-binding proteins. These properties are consistent with the repressorlike function of KorC protein, and we discuss the evidence that KorA and KorC proteins act as corepressors in the control of the kilC and kilE operons. Finally, we show that korC is expressed from the bla promoters within the upstream transposon Tn1, suggesting that insertion of Tn1 interrupted a plasmid operon that may have originally included korC and kilC.
