The purified native mercuric reductase (MerA) from Ralstonia metallidurans CH34 contains an N-terminal sequence of 68 amino acids predicted to be homologous to MerP, the periplasmic mercury-binding protein. This MerP-like protein has now been expressed independently. The protein was named MerAa by homology with Ccc2a, the first soluble domain of the copper-transporting ATPase from yeast. Deltaa has been characterized using a set of biophysical techniques. The binding of mercury was followed using circular dichroism spectroscopy and electrospray mass spectrometry. The two cysteine residues contained in the consensus sequence GMTC XXC are involved in the binding of one mercury atom, with an apparent affinity comparable to that of MerP for the same metal. The metal-binding site is confirmed by NMR chemical shift changes observed between apo- and metal-bound MerAa in solution. NMR shift and NOE data also indicate that only minor structural changes occur upon metal binding. Further NMR investigation of the fold of MerAa using long-range methyl-methyl NOE and backbone residual dipolar coupling data confirm the expected close structural homology with MerP. (15)N relaxation data show that MerAa is a globally rigid molecule. An increased backbone mobility was observed for the loop region connecting the first beta-strand and the first alpha-helix and comprising the metal-binding domain. Although significantly reduced, this loop region keeps some conformational flexibility upon metal binding. Altogether, our data suggest a role of MerAa in mercury trafficking.
