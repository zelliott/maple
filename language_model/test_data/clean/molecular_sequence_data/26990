An aerobic, Gram-negative, yellow-coloured, rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated KIS28-6T, was isolated from soil from Ulleung, an island located in the East Sea of Korea. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that strain KIS28-6T was a member of the genus Dokdonella, having 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 98.1 and 96.9% with respect to Dokdonella fugitiva CIP 108692T and Dokdonella koreensis DSM 17203T, respectively. Strain KIS28-6T showed DNA-DNA hybridization values of 38 and 32% with respect to D. fugitiva CIP 108692T and D. koreensis DSM 17203T, respectively. The major fatty acids (>10%) were iso-C17:1omega9c (35.7%), iso-C17:0 (26.9%) and iso-C15:0 (11.7%), the major respiratory quinone was Q-8 and the DNA G+C content was 73.0 mol%. On the basis of the results obtained in this polyphasic taxonomic analysis, strain KIS28-6T represents a novel species of the genus Dokdonella, for which the name Dokdonella soli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KIS28-6T (=KACC 12741T =JCM 15421T).
