Galactosaminoglycans from mature rooster comb and wattle tissues were separated into five fractions by ethanol precipitation. An average of 90% total uronic acid was recovered in Fractions I to III. Fractions I and II were dermatan sulfate with relatively high proportions of L-iduronic acid (61 to 80%), but this uronic acid was a minor component (30%) in Fraction III, in which D-glucuronic acid was the major uronic acid. Digestion with testicular hyaluronidase suggested that most if not all of the galactosaminoglycans in Fractions I to III were copolymers containing both L-iduronic acid and D-glucuronic acid. Fractions IV and V contained much lower proportions of L-iduronic acid and showed broader electrophoresis bands than did Fraction III.
