The partial sequences of exon I of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) genes in yak (Bos grunniens), cattle (Bos taurus), zebu (Bos indicus), and buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) were analyzed. Comparisons of these sequences and the deduced amino acid sequences with the homologous HSL gene and protein sequences in other mammalian species including pig (Sus scrofa), human (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus), and rat (Rattus sp.) retrieved from the GenBank were carried out and finally a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the partial DNA sequences of the HSL genes in all species. The results showed that the homologies of the partial exon I sequences of the HSL genes between yak and cattle, zebu, buffalo, pig, human, mouse, and rat were as high as 99.8%, 99.6%, 97.4%, 90.6%, 88.4%, 83.5%, and 82.3%, respectively. This was accompanied by highly homologous amino acid sequences of the HSLs: 100%, 100%, 98.2%, 94.0%, 92.2%, 89.8%, and 89.8% identity, respectively. There are more transitions, less transversions, and no insertion or deletion in variable nucleotides of the HSL genes between the yak and other species. The majority of the variable mutations was synonymous and was found most frequently at the third codon, followed by the first and second codons, a finding that was in accordance with the neutralism hypothesis for molecular evolution. In the phylogenetic tree, the cattle and zebu were clustered together first, followed by the yak, buffalo, pig, human, mouse, and rat. This was in agreement with taxonomy suggesting that the partial sequences of exon I of the HSL genes were useful in constructing the phylogenetic tree of mammalian species. Among the four species of Bovidae, genetic differentiation in the HSL genes between yak and buffalo is equivalent to that between buffalo and cattle and between buffalo and zebu. Furthermore, the genetic distances in the HSL genes are much smaller between yak, cattle, and zebu than those between each of the three species and the buffalo. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider yak as an independent species of the genus Bos.
