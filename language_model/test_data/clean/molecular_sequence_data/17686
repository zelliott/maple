The ability of the synthetic hypertrehalosemic peptides, HT-I and HT-II, to influence the activities of glycogen phosphorylase, trehalase and hexokinase via elevation of Ca++ and cAMP levels was examined in thoracic musculature of the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana. The peptides effect dose- and time-dependent activation of phosphorylase, trehalase and hexokinase activities that occur concomitantly with elevated levels of intracellular calcium. In addition, HT-I increases the accumulation of cyclic AMP in muscle cells.
