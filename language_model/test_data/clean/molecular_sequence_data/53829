Two components F-2-7-4 and F-2-7-5, each composed of 28 amino acid residues, were purified from the venom of Buthus martensi Karsch by an opportune procedure with cation-exchange column chromatography and repeated HPLC. Both components were totally accounted to about 0. 88% dry weight of the crude venom. The molecular weights of both components were determined to be 2950 and 2935 by mass spectrometry, which were fully coincidence with that of the known novel short-chain peptides BmP02 and BmP03, respectively [Romi-Lebrun R, Martin-Eauclaire M-F, Escoubas P, Wu FQ, Lebrun B, Hisada M, Nakajima T. Characterization of four toxins from Buthus martensi scorpion venom, which act on apamin-sensitive Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels. Eur J Biochem 1997;145:457-464]. In addition, the sequence of component F-2-7-4 was analyzed to be the same as that of BmP02. The components F-2-7-4 and F-2-7-5 purified in this study were, thus, finally distinguished to be BmP02 and BmP03 from the same venom. Using whole cell patch-clamp recording, it was found that BmP02 diminished the current of transient outward K(+) channel in adult rat ventricular myocyte in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect was reversible. Dynamic studies showed that the activation, inactivation and recovery processes of the transient outward K(+) channel were not changed significantly after applying of BmP02. In addition, when BmP02 was applied to guinea pig ventricular myocyte, both delayed and inward rectified K(+) currents showed no change compared with the control. The results suggest strongly that BmP02 or -like peptides from scorpion venom may provide a useful probe for the studying of transient outward K(+) channel in rat ventricular myocyte.
