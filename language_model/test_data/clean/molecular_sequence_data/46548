A clone containing an unusual leghemoglobin (Lb) gene was isolated from a soybean DNA library present in Charon 4A phage. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the isolated Lb gene has three intervening sequences (IVS-1, IVS-2 and IVS-3) located in the same positions as those found in other Lb genes. Due to a large increase of IVS-2 and IVS-3, the isolated Lb gene is about twice the size of a normal Lb gene. The coding sequence derived from the DNA sequence corresponds to no known soybean Lb and attempts to find a corresponding mRNA failed. In addition, the 5'-flanking sequence of the Lb gene is mutated in two regions which seem to be important for transcription. It is, therefore, tentatively suggested that the isolated Lb gene is non-functional, and consequently is an Lb pseudogene.
