The ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer sequences of 13 unrelated Encephalitozoon intestinalis isolates obtained from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with intestinal microsporidiosis were analyzed by gene amplification and DNA sequencing. Among these isolates, we found only one genetic lineage which suggests that E. intestinalis may have a clonal distribution in HIV-infected patients.
