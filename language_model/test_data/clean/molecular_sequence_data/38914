The feline CTLA4 cDNA encodes a transmembrane protein which shares 87.9% sequence identity with the human CTLA4 molecule. The cytoplasmic region of the feline CTLA4 is identical to that of humans and mice, which suggests conserved function(s) such as the regulation of cell-surface expression of this molecule.
