Eight TaqI isoschizomer genes, two from Yellowstone National Park, one from Japan, two from New Zealand, two from Portugal, and one from the Azores (1000 miles west of Portugal), were PCR-amplified and sequenced. Sequence alignment of isoschizomers isolated from close geographical locations shows identical or almost identical protein sequences, while isoschizomers from distant sites demonstrate considerable diversity, ranging from 54 to 75% in amino acid identity. Accordingly, these isoschizomers were arranged into four geographical groups, i.e., USA as represented by Thermus aquaticus YT1, Japan by Thermus thermophilus HB8, New Zealand by Thermus filiformis Tok6A1, Portugal by Thermus sp. SM32. The complete ORFs of two new representative genes, tfiTok6A1I and tsp32IR, were obtained by bubble PCR. Unlike M . TaqI-R.TaqI and M . TthHB8I-R . TthHB8I which exhibit an unusual 13-codon overlap, the methylase and endonuclease genes are each separated by 15 nucleotides in the TfiTok6A1I and Tsp32IR restriction-modification systems. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that initially TfiTok6A1I diverged from a common ancestor, then Tsp32IR branched out, and finally TaqI and TthHB8I diverged from each other during evolution.
