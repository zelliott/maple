Aberrations involving the chromosomal region 12q24 are a nonrandom cytogenetic abnormality in frequent benign tumors mainly of mesenchymal origin, e.g., uterine leiomyomas, pleomorphic adenomas of the salivary gland, lipomas, or hamartomas of the lung. Mostly, these 12q24 abnormalities occur as a result of inversions also affecting chromosomal region 12q14-15. In addition to the frequent tumors mentioned above, these abnormalities have also been found in rare mesenchymal tumors, e.g., hemangiopericytomas. Although recently the molecular basis of the aberrations of chromosomal region 12q14-15, i.e., a rearrangement of the HMGI-C gene has been identified, the molecular roots of the 12q24 changes still remain to be elucidated. Herein we report on 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR results on cDNA from a primary uterine leiomyoma. As an ectopic sequence fused to exon 3 of the HMGI-C gene, we have identified a cDNA sequence that revealed 100% homology to exon 13 of the human mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (ALDH 2). Because ALDH 2 maps to 12q24.1, this fusion transcript is a good candidate underlying the chromosomal rearrangements involving 12q24.
