Sublethal heat-shock of cells of the Bge (Biomphalaria glabrata embryonic) snail cell line resulted in increased or new expression of metabolically labeled polypeptides of approximately 21.5, 41, 70, and 74 kDa molecular mass. Regulation of this response appeared to be at the transcriptional level since a similar protein banding pattern was seen upon SDS-PAGE/fluorographic analysis of polypeptides produced by in vitro translation of total RNA from cells subjected to heat shock. Using a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) 70-kDa heat-shock protein (HSP70) probe to screen a cDNA library from heat-treated Bge cells, we isolated a full-length cDNA clone encoding a putative Bge HSP70. The cDNA was 2453 bp in length and contained an open reading frame of 1908 bp encoding a 636-amino-acid polypeptide with calculated molecular mass of 70,740 Da. Comparison of a conserved region of 209 amino acid residues revealed > 80% identity between the deduced amino acid sequence of Bge HSP70 and that of yeast (81%), the human blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni (for which B. glabrata serves as intermediate host) (81%), Drosophila (81%), human (84%), and the marine gastropod Aplysia californica (88%, 90%). In addition to the extensive sharing of sequence homology, the identification of several eukaryotic HSP70 signature sequences and an N-linked glycosylation site characteristic of cytoplasmic HSPs strongly support the identity of the Bge cDNA as encoding an authentic HSP70. Results of a Northern blot analysis, using Bge HSP70 clone-specific probes, indicated that gene expression was heat inducible and not constitutively expressed. This is the first reported sequence of an inducible HSP70 from cells originating from a freshwater gastropod and provides a first step in the development of a genetic transformation system for molluscs of medical importance.
