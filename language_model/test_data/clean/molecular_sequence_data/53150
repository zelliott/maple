The total synthesis of the methyl glycoside of GM(1) (1b) has been accomplished. The key step in the synthesis involves the sulfonamidoglycosidation reaction, which is used to create a beta-linkage leading to a GalNAc residue joined to the C4 hydroxyl group of a galactose unit of a C3 sialylated lactosyl moiety. The "proximal hydroxyl" directing effect, which has been postulated before, manifests in this context as well leading to the preponderant formation of the beta-glycoside. Together with asialo GM(1) and other substructures, the GM(1) methyl glycoside has been submitted for biological assays as potential ligands for bacterial and viral infection sites.
