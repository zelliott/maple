Adenylate cyclase genes, designated cyaA, cyaB1, cyaB2, cyaC, and cyaD, were isolated from the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 by complementation of a strain of Escherichia coli defective for the presence of cya. These genes encoded polypeptides consisting of 735, 859, 860, 1,155, and 546 amino acid residues, respectively. Deduced amino acid sequences of the regions near the C-terminal ends of these cya genes were similar to those of catalytic domains of eukaryotic adenylate cyclases. The remaining part of each cya gene towards its N-terminal end showed a characteristic structure. CyaA had two putative membrane-spanning regions. Both CyaB1 and CyaB2 had regions that were very similar to the cyclic GMP (cGMP)-binding domain of cGMP-stimulated cGMP phosphodiesterase. CyaC consisted of four distinct domains forming sequentially from the N terminus: a response regulator-like domain, a histidine kinase-like domain, a response regulator-like domain, and the catalytic domain of adenylate cyclase. CyaD contained the forkhead-associated domain in its N-terminal region. Expression of these genes was examined by reverse transcription-PCR. The transcript of cyaC was shown to be predominant in this cyanobacterium. The cellular cyclic AMP level in the disruptant of the cyaC mutant was much lower than that in the wild type.
