We have assessed the potential of using the spliced leader (SL) or mini-exon gene as a marker for molecular phylogenetic analysis of genus Trypanosoma. A total of 27 trypanosome sequences were compared, 18 of these being newly reported. In contrast to genus Leishmania, we found the non-transcribed spacer region of the SL locus in trypanosomes to be far too variable for informative comparison of all but the most closely related species. At the other extreme, the short (39 nt) SL exon was usually completely conserved and hence uninformative. The SL RNA showed variation in both length (97-152 nt) and sequence among different trypanosome species, with most variation occurring in stem-loop II. Consequently, this region could not be aligned with confidence in multiple sequence alignment, severely reducing the number of phylogenetically informative nucleotide positions. In computer simulation, most of the SL RNAs readily folded into the 3 stem-loop secondary structure predicted previously, but again stem-loop II was highly variable. No obvious correlation could be seen between the length of this stem-loop and trypanosome biology. We conclude that the SL repeat is not an informative phylogenetic marker for long range evolutionary studies of genus Trypanosoma.
