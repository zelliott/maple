Sox genes, a family of genes related to the mammalian sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene, are found throughout the animal kingdom, and involved in diverse developmental processes including sex determination and neurogenesis. Previously, we have identified one sox11 homologue, sox11b, from the ovary of the orange-spotted grouper. In the present study, another sox11 homologue, sox11a, was cloned from the brain. The orange-spotted grouper Sox11a contained the signature features of mammalian SOX11 homologues except the Pro-Glu rich region, was clustered with Sox11a homologues of other teleosts in the phylogenetic tree, and shared higher homologies with Sox11 of other species than the duplicated copy Sox11b. Interestingly, significant conservation was observed in the 3'UTR of sox11a but not sox11b transcripts when compared with mammalian Sox11 homologues. The expression of sox11a mRNA was detected in a wide range of tissues, with higher abundances in the central nervous system. During embryogenesis and larval development, the expression of sox11a mRNA remained at considerably high levels at all stages examined, from newly fertilized eggs, through organogenesis, to the larvae 18days posthatching. Together, these results indicated that the orange-spotted grouper sox11a was evolutionarily more conserved than sox11b, and may play important roles in neurogenesis, embryogenesis, and larval development.
