A simplified and sensitive method for measuring expression levels of type-1 angiotensin II (AT1) receptor subtypes, AT1A and AT1B, was established. The two receptor cDNAs were co-amplified and measured by polymerase chain reaction using primers based on the corresponding receptor subtype genes. Both AT1A and AT1B mRNAs were widely expressed in the rat tissues including adrenal gland, kidney, heart, aorta, lung, liver, testis, pituitary gland, cerebrum and cerebellum. AT1A mRNA was predominantly expressed in the rat tissues examined except adrenal gland and pituitary gland where AT1B mRNA was predominantly expressed. Sodium depletion did not change mRNA levels of AT1A and AT1B in the all tissues. However, both AT1A and AT1B mRNA levels in the heart and aorta were down-regulated by treatment with AT1 specific antagonist, TCV 116. In contrast, AT1B mRNA in the adrenal gland was mainly reduced by the treatment. These results suggest that the expression level of AT1B mRNA in the adrenal gland depends on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and both receptor subtypes mediate contraction and hypertrophy of the smooth and cardiac muscles via the RAAS.
