A new procedure for sequence-independent PCR amplification of DNA fragments is described. DNA from pUC18 plasmid was used as a test DNA. It was digested with a frequently cutting restriction enzyme (Sau3A), generating sticky ends. The DNA was ligated to a synthetic, non-phosphorylated adaptor and subsequently amplified in a nested PCR using two oligonucleotides with sequences derived from the adaptor. As little as 1 fg of pUC18 DNA could be detected by this procedure. The product was analyzed on a gel and hybridized with a pUC18-specific probe. The sequence-independent nested PCR was repeated with different amounts of pUC18 DNA in the presence of an excess of non-specific DNA. In these experiments, pUC18 DNA fragments were amplified in a concentration-dependent manner. After hybridization with a digoxigenin dUTP-labelled pUC18 DNA probe, 1 fg of pUC18 DNA could still be detected. This method allows rapid screening of blood for low titred and mutated viruses in which primer binding sites are not conserved.
