We have identified a novel cDNA clone, named AZ1, obtained from a cDNA library of mRNA prepared from C3H10T1/2 cells that had been transiently exposed to 5-azacytidine, a potent demethylating reagent. The amount of transcript increased with 5-azacytidine treatment of C3H10T1/2 cells and the transcript was highly expressed in mouse testis. As the mutant mouse jsd/jsd, which has a defect in germ cell maturation, barely expressed the transcript, the message was expected to be expressed specifically in spermatocytes. The mRNA was detected at significant levels in the testes from mice aged 16 days after birth, suggesting that its expression started at the pachytene spermatocyte stage. The elucidated nucleotide sequence contained a 2841-nucleotide open reading frame, and the expected amino acid sequence had a molecular mass of 107,254 Da. Specific antibodies raised against the fusion protein including glutathione S-transferase revealed an approximately 130-kDa band of a translation product in testis and in cultured cells transfected with AZ1 cDNA in the expression vector on Western-blot analysis. The protein was localized to the pre-acrosome region of round and elongated spermatids. However, it was not detected at a more advanced stage of spermatids, i.e. just before their release from Sertoli cells. This protein may play an important role in spermatogenesis.
