Elucidation of the factors involved in host defense against human immunodeficiency viral infection remains pivotal if viral control may be achieved. Toward these ends, we investigated the function of a putative antiretroviral factor, OTK18, isolated by differential display of mRNA from HIV type 1-infected primary human monocyte-derived macrophages. Molecular and immunohistochemical analyses showed that the OTK18 nucleotide sequence contains 13 adjacent C(2)H(2)-type zinc finger motifs, a Krüppel-associated box, and is localized to both cytosol and nucleus. Mutational analyses revealed that both the Krüppel-associated box and zinc finger regions of OTK18 are responsible for the transcriptional suppressive activities of this gene. OTK18 was copiously expressed in macrophages following HIV type I infection and diminished progeny virion production. A mechanism for this antiretroviral activity was by suppression of HIV type 1 Tat-induced viral long terminal repeat promoter activity. Our findings suggest that one possible function of OTK18 is as a HIV type 1-inducible transcriptional suppressor.
