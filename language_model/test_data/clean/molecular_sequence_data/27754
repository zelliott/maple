Collagen genes col-6, col-7 (partial), col-8, col-14 and col-19 from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans were sequenced, and compared to the previously sequenced genes col-1 and col-2. The genes are between 1.0 and 1.2 kb in length, and each includes one or two short introns. The presumptive promoter regions contain sequences similar to the eukaryotic TATA promoter element. Two distinct, conserved sequences were found in the presumptive promoter regions of, respectively, the dauer larva-specific genes col-2 and col-6, and the primarily adult-specific genes col-7 and col-19. The domain structures of the collagen polypeptides are similar: each polypeptide contains two triple-helix forming (Gly-X-Y)n domains, one of 30-33 amino acids (aa), and the other of 127-132 aa. The latter domain is interrupted by one to three short (2-8 aa) non-(Gly-X-Y)n segments that occur at relatively conserved locations in each polypeptide. Sets of cysteine residues flank the (Gly-X-Y)n domains in all of the polypeptides. The genes can be placed into three families based upon amino acid sequence similarities. Genes within a family do not always exhibit similar developmental expression programs, suggesting that structural and regulatory regions of the genes have evolved separately. The codon usage in the genes is highly asymmetrical, with adenine appearing in the third position of 85% of the glycine codons, and 93% of the proline codons.
