A general structure for the atrial natriuretic peptide clearance receptor (ANP C-receptor) has been proposed based on hydropathicity analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of this membrane protein (Fuller, F., Porter, J.G., Arfsten, A., Miller, J., Schilling, J., Scarborough, R.M., Lewicki, J.A., and Schenk, D.B. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 9395-9401). The ANP C-receptor is believed to possess a large amino-terminal extracellular domain (436 amino acids), a single hydrophobic transmembrane anchor (23 amino acids), and a short cytoplasmic tail (37 amino acids). As a means of testing the structure and proposed cellular orientation of this protein, we have employed the technique of in vitro mutagenesis to prepare a receptor mutant (anc-) lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Expression of this mutant in mammalian cells using a vaccinia virus vector results in secretion of a truncated soluble form of the ANP C-receptor which binds native ANP and synthetic ANP analogs with a specificity similar to that of the native ANP C-receptor. In contrast to the native ANP C-receptor that exists predominantly as a homodimer on the cell surface, the secreted receptor exists as a monomeric species. The results are consistent with the proposed structure of this receptor with the amino-terminal domain containing the ANP-binding site oriented extracellular to the plasma membrane. In addition, these data demonstrate that the receptor does not require association with the plasma membrane or its native dimeric configuration in order to bind ANP ligands with high affinity and specificity.
