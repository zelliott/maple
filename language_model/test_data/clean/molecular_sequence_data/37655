HindIII restriction digests of the rDNA repeat unit of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica, reveal significant intraspecies sequence polymorphism. This variability is probably caused by structural differences within the nontranscribed spacer regions (NTS) of the ribosomal repeat unit. HindIII rDNA fragment polymorphisms in three cockroach strains show that individuals from different populations may have different HindIII rDNA patterns, whereas individuals within populations exhibit relatively similar rDNA patterns. We suggest that HindIII restriction fragment polymorphisms within cockroach ribosomal DNA will be a valuable tool for measuring population-level parameters within and between natural cockroach populations.
