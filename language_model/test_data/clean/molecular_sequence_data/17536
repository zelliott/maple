Spectroscopic studies on synthetic polypeptides containing the unit-X-G-G (X=V or L) are reported. The sequences, constituting either fragments or model of elastin, were shown to adopt type II beta-turns together with an ensemble of unordered conformations. Furthermore, it was found that the stability of the beta-turns was depending on the nature of the X residue, on the hydration of the chain and, in the case of the sequence G-V-G-G-L, was decreasing by increasing the length of the chain.
