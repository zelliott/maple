The nucleotide sequence of a 3.6 kb DNA fragment containing a cellodextrinase gene (celA) from Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1 was determined. The gene was expressed from its own regulatory region in Escherichia coli and a putative consensus promoter sequence was identified upstream of a ribosome binding site and a TTG start codon. The complete amino acid sequence of the CelA enzyme (352 residues) was deduced and showed no significant homology to cellulases from other organisms. Two lysozyme-type active sites were found in the amino-terminal third of the enzyme. In E. coli the cloned Cel A protein was translocated into the periplasm. The lack of a typical signal sequence, and the results of transposon phoA mutagenesis experiments indicated that CelA is secreted by a mechanism other than a leader peptide.
