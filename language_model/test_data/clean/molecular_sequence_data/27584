Using a specific and sensitive radioimmunoassay for endothelin, the regional distribution and molecular form of endothelin was investigated in rat tissue. The highest concentration was observed in the inner medulla of the kidney (8.7 +/- 2.2 pg/mg wet weight). On two kinds of reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, immunoreactive endothelin in the inner medulla of the kidney was separated into two peaks at positions where authentic porcine/human and putative rat/human endothelin eluted. Furthermore, the concentration of immunoreactive endothelin in the inner medulla of the kidney was remarkably decreased in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) compared with normotensive control Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) but no difference was observed in lung immunoreactive endothelin.
