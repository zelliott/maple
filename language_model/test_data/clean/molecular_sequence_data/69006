We have analyzed two (BclI and XbaI) intragenic restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) and St14 (DXS52) variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) by rapid PCR method in 97 unrelated normal subjects. The incidences for positive Bc1I and XbaI polymorphic sites in the Koreans were 81% and 72%, respectively, which were higher than other ethnic groups but similar to that reported in the Chinese or Japanese, giving the heterozygosity rate of 0.32 and 0.40, respectively. The amplified allele size was 880 bp with no other polymorphism in the analysis of St14 (DXS52) VNTR. This finding should be taken into account in the planning of a prenatal diagnosis program for ethnic Koreans.
