The tyrosine phenol-lyase (TPL) gene of Erwinia herbicola was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene determined. The TPL gene comprises 1368 bp, encoding 456 amino acids which have 90% amino acid identity with TPL from Citrobacter freundii. After replacing the 5'-flanking region of the TPL gene with the E. coli lac promoter, TPL protein could be hyperproduced constitutively in E. coli without induction by L-tyrosine.
