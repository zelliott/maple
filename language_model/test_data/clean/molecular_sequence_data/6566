The so-called very low density lipoprotein receptors (VLDLRs) are related to the LDLR gene family. So far, naturally occurring mutations have only been described for the prototype LDLR; in humans, they cause familial hypercholesterolemia. Here we describe a naturally occurring mutation in a VLDLR that causes a dramatic abnormal phenotype. Hens of the mutant restricted-ovulator chicken strain carry a single mutation, lack functional oocyte receptors, are sterile, and display severe hyperlipidemia with associated premature atherosclerosis. The mutation converts a cysteine residue into a serine, resulting in an unpaired cysteine and greatly reduced expression of the mutant avian VLDLR on the oocyte surface. Extraoocytic cells in the mutant produce higher than normal amounts of a differentially spliced form of the receptor that is characteristic for somatic cells but absent from germ cells.
