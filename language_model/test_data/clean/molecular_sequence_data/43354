Incorporation of human foamy virus (HFV) envelope proteins into murine leukemia virus (MuLV) particles was studied in a transient transfection packaging cell system. We report here that wild-type HFV envelope protein can pseudotype MuLV particles, albeit at low efficiency. Complete or partial removal of the HFV cytoplasmic tail resulted in an abolishment or reduction of HFV-mediated infectivity, implicating a role of the HFV envelope cytoplasmic tail in the pseudotyping of MuLV particles. Mutation of the endoplasmic reticulum retention signal present in the HFV envelope cytoplasmic tail did not result in a higher relative infectivity of pseudotyped retroviral vectors. However, a chimeric envelope protein, containing an unprocessed MuLV envelope cytoplasmic domain fused to a truncated HFV envelope protein, showed an enhanced HFV specific infectivity as a result of an increased incorporation of chimeric envelope proteins into MuLV particles.
