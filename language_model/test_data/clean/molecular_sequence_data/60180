A clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, JES, was resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins with a marked synergistic effect with clavulanic acid on a routine antibiogram. Preliminary PCR analysis revealed the presence of blaVEB-1, an integron-located gene encoding an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase previously identified in Escherichia coli MG-1. Using class 1 integron primers and blaVEB-1 intragenic primers, the insert region of the blaVEB-1 containing integron along with some flanking sequence from P. aeruginosa JES was amplified and subsequently sequenced. In50 contains within its variable region, in addition to qacE delta 1 and sull genes commonly found in class 1 integrons, two gene cassettes, veb1 and aadB. In50 is peculiar since its attI1 site is interrupted by two novel insertion sequences, IS1999 and IS2000. P. aeruginosa JES and Escherichia coli MG-1 strains were isolated from patients previously hospitalized in south east Asian countries. The finding of blaVEB-1 in these strains and on different integrons underlines the interspecies spread of this integron-located extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene.
