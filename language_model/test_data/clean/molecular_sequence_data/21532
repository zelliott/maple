The centromeres of budding yeast are ~120 bp in size and contain three functional elements: an AT-rich region flanked by binding sites for Cbf1 and CBF3. A specialized nucleosome containing the H3 variant Cse4 (CenH3) is formed at the centromere. Our genome-wide paired-end sequencing of nucleosomal DNA reveals that the centromeric nucleosome contains a micrococcal nuclease-resistant kernel of 123-135 bp, depending on the centromere, and is therefore significantly shorter than the canonical nucleosome. Unlike canonical nucleosomes, the centromeric nucleosome is essentially perfectly positioned. The entire centromere is included, together with at least 1 bp of DNA upstream of the Cbf1 site and at least 4 bp downstream of the CBF3 site. The fact that the binding sites for Cbf1 and CBF3 are included within the centromeric nucleosome has important implications for models of the centromeric nucleosome and for kinetochore function.
