We have determined the partial amino acid sequences of the 40 kDa protein, one of the three pertussis toxin substrates in porcine brain. Purified 40 kDa protein from porcine brain was completely digested with TPCK-trypsin. Digested peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC and subjected to analysis by gas-phase protein sequencing. Several sequences of porcine brain 40 kDa protein completely matched with those which were deduced from the nucleotide sequences of the human Gi2 alpha gene and rat Gi2 alpha cDNA. On the other hand, the previously determined sequences of the rat brain 41 and 39 kDa proteins were in complete agreement with the predicted amino acid sequences of rat Gi1 alpha and Go alpha cDNAs, respectively.
