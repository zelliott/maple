Starting from L-rhamnose, D-mannose and 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose hydrochloride, two disaccharide blocks, namely, ethyl 2,4-di-O-benzyl-3-O-[(R)-1-(methoxycarbonyl)ethyl]-alpha-L-rhamnopyranos yl-(1-->3)-2-O-acetyl-4,6-di-O-benzyl-1-thio-alpha-D-mannopyranoside and 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl 2-O-acetyl-3,6-di-O-benzyl-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-(1-->3)-4,6-di-O-benzy l-2-deoxy-2-phthalimido-beta-D-glucopyranoside, were synthesised and then allowed to react in the presence of N-iodosuccinimide and trifluoromethane sulfonic acid to give a tetrasaccharide derivative. This compound was converted into 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl 2,4-di-O-benzyl-3-O-[(R)-1-(methoxycarbonyl)ethyl]-alpha-L-rhamno- pyranosyl-(1-->3)-2-O-acetyl-4,6-di-O-benzyl-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-(1-- >4)-2-O-acetyl-3,6-di-O-benzyl-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-(1-->3)-2-acetamid o-4,6-di-O-benzyl-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranoside, which on hydrogenolysis, afforded the methyl ester 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl glycoside of the tetrasaccharide related to the repeating unit of the O-antigen from Shigella dysenteriae type 5.
