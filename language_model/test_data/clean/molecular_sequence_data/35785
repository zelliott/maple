Molecular mechanics has been used to predict the structure of the Y+.R-.R(+)-type DNA triple helix, in which a second polypurine strand binds antiparallel to the homopurine strand of a homopurine/homopyrimidine stretch of duplex DNA. From calculations on the sequence d(C)10.d(G)10.d(G)10, two likely structures emerge. One has the glycosidic torsions of the third strand bases in the anti-conformation and Hoogsteen hydrogen-bonds to the purine strand of the duplex, the other has the third strand purines in the syn orientation and uses a reverse-Hoogsteen hydrogen-bonding pattern. Despite the large structural differences between these two types of triplex, calculations performed in vacuo with a distance-dependent dielectric constant to mimic the shielding effect of solvent show them to be energetically very similar, with the latter (syn) slightly preferred. However, if explicit solvent molecules are included in the calculation, the anti conformation is found to be much preferred. This difference in the results seems to stem from an underestimation of short-range electrostatic interactions in the in vacuo simulations. When TAA or TAT base triples are substituted for the sixth CGG triple in the sequence, it is found that, for the solvated model, the third strand base of the TAA triple prefers the syn orientation while that in the TAT triple retains a preference, though reduced, for the anti conformation.
