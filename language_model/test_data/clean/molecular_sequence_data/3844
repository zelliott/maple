Although mussels and oysters in the ocean are known to act as bioconcentrators for contaminants such as heavy metals, their ability to survive in heavily polluted water is relatively limited. The Asian periwinkle, Littorina brevicula, is one species that can accumulate a variety of environmental heavy metals, and the expression of its metal binding protein (MBP) is induced by cadmium. To better characterize this protein and its detoxification mechanism against cadmium, the present work examined the induction of a cadmium binding protein (Cd-BP) in Littorina brevicula exposed to 400 microg/l CdCl(2) for 30 days. The induced Cd-BP was purified by chromatography from the supernatants of homogenized organs (digestive gland, gonad, gill and kidney). This Cd-BP was found to consist of 103 amino acids, was rich in Cys (21 residues), and partial C-terminal sequence obtained by MALDI-TOF MS analysis revealed a Cys-XXX-Cys motif, which resembles a typical feature of mollusc metallothionein (MT). The Cd-BP molecular weight of 9.8 kDa is a little larger than that of other MTs.
