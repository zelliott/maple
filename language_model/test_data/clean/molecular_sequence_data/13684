An unusual property of ribosomal gene transcription is its marked species specificity. This results from distinct promoter-recognition properties of the RNA polymerase I transcription apparatus. The purification and functional characterization of TIF-IB/SL1, a promoter-recognition factor containing the TATA-binding protein, as well as the recent cloning of cDNAs encoding the three subunits (TAF(I)s) of the respective human and mouse factor, will facilitate the molecular analysis of the mechanisms underlying species-specific rDNA transcription and reveal how the basal transcriptional machinery has evolved.
