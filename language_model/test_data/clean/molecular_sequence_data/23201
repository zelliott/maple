The genetic structure of populations of Turnip mosaic virus in Eurasia was assessed by making host range and gene sequence comparisons of 142 isolates. Most isolates collected in West Eurasia infected Brassica plants whereas those from East Eurasia infected both Brassica and Raphanus plants. Analyses of recombination sites (RSs) in five regions of the genome (one third of the full sequence) showed that the protein 1 (P1 gene) had recombined more frequently than the other gene regions in both subpopulations, but that the RSs were located in different parts of the genomes of the subpopulations. Estimates of nucleotide diversity showed that the West Eurasian subpopulation was more diverse than the East Eurasian subpopulation, but the Asian-BR group of the genes from the latter subpopulation had a greater nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution ratio, especially in the P1, viral genome-linked protein (VPg) and nuclear inclusion a proteinase (NIa-Pro) genes. These subpopulations seem to have evolved independently from the ancestral European population, and their genetic structure probably reflects founder effects.
