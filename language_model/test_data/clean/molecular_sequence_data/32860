Carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) is a transcription factor that activates liver glycolytic and lipogenetic enzyme genes in response to high carbohydrate diet. Here we report the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms for the rat ChREBP gene. Firstly, we determined the transcription initiation site and the nucleotide sequences of the rat ChREBP promoter region encompassing approximately 900bp from the ATG initiation codon. Reporter gene assays demonstrated that the major positive regulatory region exists in the nucleotide sequence between -163 and -32 of the ChREBP gene. This region contains a cluster of putative transcription factor binding elements that consist of two specificity protein 1 (Sp1) binding sites (-66 to -50 and -93 to -78), a sterol regulatory element (-101 to -110), and two nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y) binding sites (-23 to -19 and -131 to -127). Mutations introduced into these sites caused marked reduction of ChREBP promoter activities. Functional synergisms were observed between Sp1/NF-Y and Sp1/sterol regulatory element-binding protein. Additionally, electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that these factors bound to these elements. Thus, we conclude that functional synergisms between these transcription factors are critical for ChREBP gene transcription.
