Comparison of the Helicobacter nemestrinae 16S ribosomal DNA with published homologous sequences from members of the genera Helicobacter, Wolinella, and Campylobacter reveals a close relationship between H. nemestrinae, H. pylori, and H. acinonyx. This finding is unexpected since these species differ significantly in their DNA guanine-plus-cytosine contents (24 to 38 mol%).
