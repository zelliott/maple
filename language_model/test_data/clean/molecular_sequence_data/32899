The alpha-chain of IL-15 receptor complex serves as a high-affinity, specific subunit for IL-15 binding. It shares functional and structural features with IL-2 receptor alpha-chain. Here we report for the first time that the molecular cloning, characterization and sequence analysis of the teleostean IL-15R alpha from Oncorhynchus mykiss. The full-length cDNA comprises of a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 167 bp, an open reading frame of 732 bp and a large 3'UTR of 630 bp, constitutively expressed in all the tissues examined. Another two variants are found derived from alternative splicing. Two copies of rainbow trout IL-15R alpha (rtIL-15R alpha) were detected in the genome by Southern blot hybridization. Moreover, EST evidence is also traced from other fishes. The deduced rtIL-15R alpha of 243 amino acids contains a 17 aa signal peptide at N-terminus and a transmembrane region at C-terminus, as well as a typical sushi domain included in the extracellular region. Phylogenetic tree analysis groups rtIL-15R alpha with other IL-15R alphas but separates it from IL-2R alphas. In addition, a putative sequence was found in the sushi domain which is conserved and versatile among all species and this might relate to cytokine recognition.
