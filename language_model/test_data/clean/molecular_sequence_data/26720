The subgenus Miwacrepidius of the genus Hemicrepidius is represented by a monotypic species, H. (M.) subcyaneus (Motschulsky 1866) from Japan, and no other congener of the subgenus has been known until now. However, three female specimens of a novel species belonging to this subgenus were recently collected from the Republic of Korea. To delimitate the species boundary of the new species compared with the monotypic species, H. (M.) subcyaneus, we attempted an integrative taxonomy based on both morphological and DNA barcoding approaches. An examination of the results revealed ten diagnostic characteristics and large genetic distances, ranging from 8.40%, between these two species; therefore, we herein describe and illustrate the new species, Hemicrepidius (Miwacrepidius) rubriventris sp. nov., based on female types.Â
