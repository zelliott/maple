Tuberculosis remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide into the 21st century. Among the main obstacles to the global control of the disease are emerging multi-drug resistant strains and the recalcitrance of persistent infections to treatment with conventional anti-TB drugs. Here we review recent developments in our understanding of some of the pathways involved in a persistent infection and pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which reveal new targets for drug development. We describe the high-resolution crystal structures of enzymes of the glyoxylate shunt, isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, and of the cyclopropane synthases of mycolic acid biosynthesis. Structure-based drug design is now underway with the potential to lead to the development of new anti-tuberculars effective against persistent and resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections.
