To determine whether tRNA or aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is responsible for spermine stimulation of rat liver Ile-tRNA formation, homologous and heterologous Ile-tRNA formations were carried out with Escherichia coli and rat liver tRNA(Ile) and their respective purified Ile-tRNA synthetases. Spermine stimulation was observed only when tRNA from the rat liver was used. Spermine bound to rat liver tRNA(Ile) but not to the purified aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex. Kinetic analysis of Ile-tRNA formation revealed that spermine increased the Vmax and Km values for rat liver tRNA(Ile). The Km value for ATP and isoleucine did not change significantly in the presence of spermine. Furthermore, higher concentrations of rat liver tRNA(Ile) tended to inhibit Ile-tRNA formation if spermine was absent. Spermine restored isoleucine-dependent PPi-ATP exchange in the presence of rat liver tRNA(Ile), an inhibitor of this exchange. The nucleotide sequence of rat liver tRNA(Ile) was determined and compared with that of E. coli tRNA(Ile). Differences in nucleotide sequences of the two tRNAs(Ile) were observed mainly in the acceptor and anticodon stems. Limited ribonuclease V1 digestion of the 3'-32P-labeled rat liver tRNA(Ile) showed that both the anticodon and acceptor stems were structurally changed by spermine, and that the structural change by spermine was different from that by Mg2+. The influence of spermine on the ribonuclease V1 digestion of E. coli tRNA(Ile) was different from that of rat liver tRNA(Ile). The results suggest that the interaction of spermine with the acceptor and anticodon stems may be important for spermine stimulation of rat liver Ile-tRNA formation.
