The level of mRNA for cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase (cAST) in the liver of vitamin B6-deficient rats was found to be 7-fold higher than that of the control rats. The administration of hydrocortisone to adrenalectomized vitamin B6-deficient rats induced expression of hepatic cAST mRNA and the induction was suppressed by the simultaneous administration of pyridoxine. Since the 5' regulatory region of the rat cAST gene contains several sequences showing homology to glucocorticoid-responsive elements, we synthesized an oligonucleotide probe of glucocorticoid-responsive element sequence and assayed the binding activity of liver nuclear extract to the oligonucleotide by gel mobility shift analysis. We found that the binding activity of nuclear extract prepared from the liver of vitamin B6-deficient rats was far greater than that of the control rats, indicating that the DNA-binding activity of glucocorticoid receptor was enhanced by vitamin B6 deficiency. We further found that preincubation of the nuclear extract from the vitamin-deficient liver with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate brought about a rapid and extensive decrease in the binding of the extract to the glucocorticoid-responsive element. Congeners of pyridoxal phosphate, such as pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine, did not show an inhibitory effect. These observations suggest that pyridoxal 5'-phosphate modulates cAST gene expression by inactivating the binding activity of glucocorticoid receptor to glucocorticoid-responsive elements.
