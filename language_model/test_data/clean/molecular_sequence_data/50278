Two CTAG-recognizing restriction and modification (R/M) systems, designated MthZI and MthFI, were identified in the thermophilic archaeon Methanobacterium thermoformicicum strains Z-245 and FTF, respectively. Further analysis revealed that the methyltransferase (MTase) genes are plasmid-located in both strains. The plasmid pFZ1-encoded mthZIM gene of strain Z-245 was further characterized by subcloning and expression studies in Escherichia coli followed by nucleotide sequence analysis. The mthZIM gene is 1065 bp in size and may code for a protein of 355 amino acids (M(r) 42,476 Da). The deduced amino acid sequence of the M.MthZI enzyme shares substantial similarity with four distinct regions from several m4C- and m6A-MTases, and contains the TSPPY motif that is so far only found in m4C-MTases. Partially overlapping with the mthZIM gene and in reverse orientation, an additional ORF was identified with a size of 606 bp potentially coding for a protein of 202 amino acids (M(r) 23.710 Da). This ORF is suggested to encode the corresponding endonuclease R.MthZI.
