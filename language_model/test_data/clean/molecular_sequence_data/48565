Based on their sequences, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hpa2 and Hpa3 proteins are annotated as two closely related members of the Gcn5 acetyltransferase family. Here, we describe the biochemical characterization of Hpa2 and Hpa3 as bona fide acetyltransferases with different substrate specificities. Mutational and MALDI-TOF analyses showed that Hpa3 translation initiates primarily from Met-19 rather than the annotated start site, Met-1, with a minor product starting at Met-27. When expressed in Escherichia coli and assayed in vitro, Hpa2 and Hpa3 (from Met-19) acetylated histones and polyamines. Whereas Hpa2 acetylated histones H3 and H4 (at H3 Lys-14, H4 Lys-5, and H4 Lys-12), Hpa3 acetylated only histone H4 (at Lys-8). Additionally, Hpa2, but not Hpa3, acetylated certain small basic proteins. Hpa3, but not Hpa2, has been reported to acetylate D-amino acids, and we present results consistent with that. Overexpression of Hpa2 or Hpa3 is toxic to yeast cells. However, their deletions do not show any standard phenotypic defects. These results suggest that Hpa2 and Hpa3 are similar but distinct acetyltransferases that might have overlapping roles with other known acetyltransferases in vivo in acetylating histones and other small proteins.
