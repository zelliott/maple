The expressions of mRNA for serine dehydratase in H4IIE, HTC, and HepG2 hepatoma cells were investigated. Of the two types of mRNA transcribed from the single copy of the rat serine dehydratase gene, expression of only that encoding 35 kDa serine dehydratase is repressed in these cells. The other type coding the 8.9 kDa truncated translation product is expressed at a similar level to that in hepatocytes in primary culture and is not under hormonal control.
