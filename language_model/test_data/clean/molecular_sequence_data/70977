Murine mastocytoma P815 induces CTL responses against at least four distinct Ags (AB, C, D, and E). Recent studies have shown that the main component of the CTL response against the P815 tumor is targeted against Ags P815AB and P815E. The gene P1A has been well characterized. It encodes the P815AB Ag in the form of a nonameric peptide containing two epitopes, P815A and P815B, which are recognized by different CTLs. Here, we report the identification of the P815E Ag. Using a cDNA library derived from tumor P815, we identified the gene coding for P815E. We also characterized the antigenic peptide that anti-P815E CTLs recognize on the MHC class I molecule H-2Kd. The P815E Ag results from a mutation within an ubiquitously expressed gene encoding methionine sulfoxide reductase, an enzyme that is believed to be important in the protection of proteins against the by-products of aerobic metabolism. Surprisingly, immunizing mice i.p. with syngeneic tumor cells (L1210) that were constructed to express B7-1 and P815E did not induce resistance against live P815, even though a strong anti-P815E CTL response was observed with splenocytes from immunized animals.
