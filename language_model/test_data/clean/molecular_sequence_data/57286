The major transitions of the eukaryotic cell cycle are triggered by cyclin-dependent protein kinases. We report the purification and crystallization of the catalytic subunit of human cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), which has been implicated in the control of the G1/S transition. CDK2 was purified in large quantities from insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus, and crystals of the protein were prepared and subjected to preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis.
