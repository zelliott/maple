Three wastewater treatment plants in South Africa were investigated to understand the phylogeny and distribution of Microthrix parvicella using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA of M. parvicella revealed 98% to 100% homology of South African clones to M. parvicella reported in Genbank. The standard curves for RT-PCR showed R2 values greater than 0.99, accurate for quantification. The relative occurrence of M. parvicella 16S rRNA gene copies in the three wastewater treatment plants was in the range 0% to 3.97%. M. parvicella copies increased when the environmental temperature (< or =20 degrees C) and food/microorganism (F/M) ratio was low. The M. parvicella 16S rRNA copies could be positively correlated to the sludge volume index at low temperature. At higher temperature, there was a rapid reduction in M. parvicella population irrespective of other favorable factors, indicating the strong influence of temperature on filamentous proliferation. RT-PCR has potential applications in wastewater treatment plants to monitor sudden shift in the microbial population and assessing the plants efficacy.
