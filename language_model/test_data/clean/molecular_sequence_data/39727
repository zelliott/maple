Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) analysis is an ion-pair reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography for performing analytical separations of DNA based on temperature: analysis is performed at a temperature sufficient to partially denature DNA heteroduplexes. The technology detects single-base changes as efficiently as short deletions and insertions. The chance that a mutation cannot be detected is 0.5%.
