DNA amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a method capable of producing a selective and very high enrichment of a specific DNA sequence. Hence it seems to be useful in various fields from basic research to clinical applications. In order to automatize PCR we assembled for a very low cost a mechanical system designed to carry a test tube holder successively in three thermal baths set at the required temperatures for the reaction. Two examples of the use of this machine are given: (i) amplification of DNA of a particular subtype of acute intermittent porphyria; (ii) the detection of the chimeric c-abl/bcr message found in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells.
