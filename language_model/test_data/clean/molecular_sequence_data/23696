In a previous environmental survey of a polluted area, the authors identified two catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O) sequences predominant in environmental bacterial isolates mineralizing benzene and/or toluene and also in soil DNA extracts. In the present study, using information of stable operon arrangement and conserved gene sequences, the complete C23O ORFs of these two variants were cloned, sequenced and overexpressed. The variants differ in six nucleotide positions, and the putative protein sequences differ only by a single amino acid, Tyr or His, at position 218. Even though the three-dimensional model does not suggest a significant influence of such an amino acid substitution on enzyme function, the Tyr218 variant differed significantly from the His218 variant in lower turnover number and in lower apparent K(m) for catecholic substrates. These results are evidence of the importance for enzyme function of amino acids not directly influencing active site structure and prove the utility of recovering polymorphisms evolved and selected for special functions in natural ecosystems.
