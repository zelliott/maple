Acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (AACS, acetoacetate-CoA ligase, EC 6.2.1.16) is a ketone body-utilizing enzyme, the physiological role of which remains unclear yet in mammals, particularly has never been studied in human. In order to investigate the tissue distribution of AACS in human, cDNA encoding AACS was isolated from HepG2 cells. Amino acid sequence of human AACS deduced from the open reading frame showed high homology (89.3%) with that of rat AACS and much less homology (43.7%) with that of bacterial AACS. The expression level of the AACS mRNA was high in kidney, heart and brain, but low in liver, and the expression profile of AACS in the human brain was quite similar to that of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase.
