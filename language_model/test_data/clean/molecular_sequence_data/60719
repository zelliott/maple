A broad spectrum of cardiovascular diseases is studied in canine animal models, in which dysfunction or dysregulation of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (ecNOS) is of pivotal pathogenetic importance. To provide the tools for subsequent molecular analyses of ecNOS structure or function and to identify putative regulatory factors we isolated and characterized the canine heart ecNOS cDNA and putative regulatory (promoter) sequences. The complete coding sequence, 5'- plus part of 3'-untranslated regions (UTR) of ecNOS cDNA, and part of the 5'-flanking sequence (putative promoter region) were identified by homology (RT-)PCR cloning using canine heart total RNA or genomic DNA. Primer sequences were derived from bovine/human ecNOS cDNAs or genes. An ecNOS sequence contig of 5138 nucleotides length was established containing an open reading frame of 3618 nucleotides (1206 amino acids predicting a 133-kDa protein) and 253 bp 3'-UTR (distal to TGA codon)/1267 bp proximal to ATG codon (containing 5'-UTR and 5'-flanking sequences = putative promoter region). Comparison to human, bovine, murine, or porcine ecNOS sequences at the nucleotide or amino acid level yielded between 86 and 91% or 83 and 84% homologies, respectively. The canine ecNOS 5'-flanking sequence (putative promoter region) revealed stretches of homology up to 86% as compared to the human sequence containing a cluster of binding sites for several regulatory elements. The homology (RT-)PCR cloning strategy is presented as an alternative to common library cloning approaches. The obtained canine ecNOS sequence might serve to further analyze the structure, regulated function (promoter region consensus sites), and expression of ecNOS in different pathophysiological conditions and in other species (GenBank Accession No. BankIt264069 AF143503).
