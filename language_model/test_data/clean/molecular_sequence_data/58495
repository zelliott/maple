Semaphorin (also known as collapsin) members are thought to be involved in axon guidance during neural network formation. Here, we report the isolation of a novel member, mouse semaphorin G (M-sema G), which encodes a semaphorin domain followed by a single putative immunoglobulin-like domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. M-sema G is most closely related to M-sema F, which we previously reported, and semB and semC. These four members appear to constitute a transmembrane type subfamily in mouse semaphorins. In contrast to the predominant expression of M-sema F mRNAs in the nervous tissues, M-sema G mRNAs are strongly expressed in lymphoid tissues, especially in the thymus, as well as in the nervous tissues. The mRNAs are also detected in various cell lines from hematopoietic cells. By generating specific antibodies, we confirmed the strong expression of M-Sema G proteins on the surface of lymphocytes. These results provide the first evidence that semaphorin is expressed on lymphocytes and suggest that semaphorins may play an important role in the immune system, as well as in the nervous system.
