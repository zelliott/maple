The efficient propagation of the OK strain of the B variant of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6B) was demonstrated in a line of T cells, TaY, established from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of a patient with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). Growth of TaY cells depends on the presence of IL-2 and the cells harbor HTLV-I genomes. A severe cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in many HHV-6B(OK)-infected TaY cells one week after infection. The release of virus from HHV-6B(OK)-infected TaY cells [TaY(OK)] was first detected after three days and increased rapidly for up to seven days after infection, as demonstrated by PCR. The titer of HHV-6B(OK) in the supernatant was comparable to the value of 10(3.5) TCID50/ml obtained with PHA-activated cord blood lymphocytes (CBL) that had been infected with HHV-6B(OK). The replication of the virus was shown to depend to a considerable extent on cell viability. Electron microscopy revealed many herpesvirus-type capsid- and enveloped-viruses in the nuclei and cytoplasm of degenerated cells in TaY(OK) cultures. The U1102 strain of HHV-6A and the Z29 strain of HHV-6B also infected TaY cells productively, as detected by PCR and an immunofluorescence test. These results suggest that the activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes with mitogens such as PHA or IL-2 and the expression of some cellular gene or the HTLV-I gene might be essential for efficient propagation of HHV-6B. TaY cells should play an important role in future investigations of cell-virus interactions and genetic variations or cell tropism of HHV-6 isolates since no cell line that shows propagation of both HHV-6A and HHV-6B has been reported to date.
