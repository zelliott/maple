Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is capable of manifesting disease in nearly every organ system in immunocompromised patients. This broad pathogenic tropism correlates with the ability of the virus to infect all tested vertebrate cell types in vitro, a characteristic that has made receptor identification extremely difficult. During virus entry, HCMV induces cellular morphological changes and signaling cascades consistent with engagement of cellular integrins; however, HCMV structural proteins do not possess the widely used RGD integrin-binding motif. We identified an integrin-binding disintegrin-like domain within HCMV envelope glycoprotein B, a protein required for virus entry and fusion throughout the Herpesviridae. Accepted receptor criteria are met through the use of function-blocking integrin Abs, beta1 integrin knockout mouse fibroblasts, and glycoprotein B disintegrin-like peptides, all of which support a critical role for alpha2beta1, alpha6beta1, and alphaVbeta3 integrins as HCMV entry receptors and signaling mediators acting during the penetration stage of the entry pathway. Strikingly, the glycoprotein B disintegrin-like domain is conserved in many human and animal herpesviruses, suggesting that integrins may support entry across this medically important virus family.
