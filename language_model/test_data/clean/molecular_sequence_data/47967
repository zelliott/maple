A cDNA clone coding for the guinea pig leukotriene B4 (BLT) receptor has been isolated from a lung cDNA library. The guinea pig BLT receptor has an open reading frame corresponding to 348 amino acids and shares 73% and 70% identity with human and mouse BLT receptors, respectively. Scatchard analysis of membranes prepared from guinea pig and human BLT receptor-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 EBNA (Epstein-Bar Virus Nuclear Antigen) cells showed that both receptors displayed high affinity for leukotriene B4 (Kd value of approximately 0.4 nM) and were expressed at high levels (Bmax values ranging from 9 to 12 pmol/mg protein). The rank order of potency for leukotrienes and related analogs in competition for [3H]leukotriene B4 specific binding at the recombinant guinea pig BLT receptor is leukotriene B4 > 20-OH-leukotriene B4 > 12(R)-HETE ((5Z,8Z,10E,12(R)14Z)-12-hydroxyeicosatetraen -1-oic acid) > 12(S)-HETE ((5Z,8Z,10E,12(S)14Z)-12-Hydroxyeicosatetraen -1-oic acid) > 20-COOH-leukotriene B4 > U75302 (6-(6-(3-hydroxy-1E,5Z-undecadienyl)-2-pyridinyl)-1,5-hexane diol) >> leukotriene C4 = leukotriene D4 = leukotriene E4. For the human receptor the rank order of 12(S)-HETE, 20-COOH-leukotriene B4 and U75302 was reversed. Xenopus melanophore and HEK aequorin-based reporter gene assays were used to demonstrate that the guinea pig and human BLT receptors can couple to both the cAMP inhibitory and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization signaling pathways. However, in the case of the aequorin-expressing HEK cells (designated AEQ17-293) transfected with either the guinea pig or human BLT receptor, expression of Galpha16 was required to achieve a robust Ca2+ driven response. Leukotriene B4 was a potent agonist in functional assays of both the guinea pig and human BLT receptors. U-75302 a leukotriene B4 analogue which possesses both agonistic and antagonistic properties behaved as a full agonist of the guinea pig and human BLT receptors in AEQ17-293 cells and not as an antagonist. The recombinant guinea pig BLT receptor will permit the comparison of the intrinsic potencies of leukotriene B4 receptor antagonists used in guinea pig in vivo models of allergic and inflammatory disorders.
