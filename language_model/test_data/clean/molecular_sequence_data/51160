The cDNA for the rat erythropoietin (EPO) has been cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence consists of 166 amino acid residues, which has a 79% and 95% homology with human and mouse EPOs, respectively. Many short stretches, highly conserved in primate and rodent EPOs, are found in the 3'-noncoding region when insertions and deletions are taken into consideration.
