Kv4 channels are believed to underlie the rapidly recovering cardiac transient outward current (I(to)) phenotype. However, heterologously expressed Kv4 channels fail to fully reconstitute the native current. Kv channel interacting proteins (KChIPs) have been shown to modulate Kv4 channel function. To determine the potential involvement of KChIPs in the rapidly recovering I(to), we cloned three KChIP2 isoforms (designated fKChIP2, 2a and 2b) from the ferret heart. Based upon immunoblot data suggesting the presence of a potential endogenous KChIP-like protein in HEK 293, CHO and COS cells but absence in Xenopus oocytes, we coexpressed Kv4.3 and the fKChIP2 isoforms in Xenopus oocytes. Functional analysis showed that while all fKChIP2 isoforms produced a fourfold acceleration of recovery kinetics compared to Kv4.3 expressed alone, only fKChIP2a produced large depolarizing shifts in the V(1/2) of steady-state activation and inactivation as seen for the native rapidly recovering I(to). Analysis of RNA and protein expression of the three fKChIP2 isoforms in ferret ventricles showed that fKChIP2b was most abundant and was expressed in a gradient paralleling the rapidly recovering I(to) distribution. Ferret KChIP2 and 2a were expressed at very low levels. The ventricular expression distribution suggests that fKChIP2 isoforms are involved in modulation of the rapidly recovering I(to); however, additional regulatory factors are also likely to be involved in generating the native current.
