In this paper the Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis complex is defined as containing all species of the actual subgenus Viannia. Organisms of the L. (V) braziliensis complex are the causative agents of localized human cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis in South America, much of Central America and some ares of North America. In our search for better species and subspecies diagnostic probes we focused our research on repetitive DNA, since it provides a greater number of target sites for hybridization. In this work we report the isolation and sequencing of a 1.8 kb DNA region, LbJ38, which is probably tandemly repeated or dispersed at least 4 times along one chromosome and is naturally present in L. (V) braziliensis genomic DNA. This region contains microsatellites and simple repeat DNA sequences and was isolated by screening a genomic DNA cosmid library with complex- and species-specific probes. No homology was found with other Leishmania microsatellite or repetitive DNA. The utility of this repetitive sequence and primers derived from it in the identification of L. (V) braziliensis is demonstrated. As far as we are aware, this is the first report of sequence characterized repetitive microsatellite and GC rich simple repeat DNA from the nuclear genome of New World Leishmania.
