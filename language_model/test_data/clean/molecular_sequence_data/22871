Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the etiological agent of porcine pleuropneumonia. Tetracycline is used for therapy of this disease, and A. pleuropneumoniae carrying the tet(B) gene, coding for an efflux protein that reduces the intercellular tetracycline level, has been described previously. Of the 46 tetracycline-resistant (Tc(r)) Spanish A. pleuropneumoniae isolates used in this study, 32 (70%) carried the tet(B) gene, and 30 of these genes were associated with plasmids. Eight (17%) isolates carried the tet(O) gene, two (4%) isolates carried either the tet(H) or the tet(L) gene, and all these genes were associated with plasmids. This is the first description of these tet genes in A. pleuropneumoniae. The last two Tc(r) isolates carried none of the tet genes examined. Except for tet(O)-containing plasmids, the other 34 Tc(r) plasmids were transformable into an Escherichia coli recipient. Two plasmids were completely sequenced. Plasmid p11745, carrying the tet(B) gene, was 5,486 bp and included a rep gene, encoding a replication-related protein, and two open reading frames (ORFs) with homology to mobilization genes of Neisseria gonorrhoeae plasmid pSJ7.4. Plasmid p9555, carrying the tet(L) gene, was 5,672 bp and, based on its G+C content, consisted of two regions, one of putative gram-positive origin containing the tet(L) gene and the other comprising four ORFs organized in an operon-like structure with homology to mobilization genes in other plasmids of gram-negative bacteria.
