Isozymes of glycosyl hydrolase Family 17 hydrolyze 1,3-beta-glucan polysaccharides found in the cell wall matrix of plants and fungi, enabling these plant enzymes to serve diverse roles in plant defense and plant development. Fourteen genes from Family 17 have been characterized in the genome of rice. A sequence dendrogram analysis divided these genes into four subfamilies. The recombinant GNS1 enzyme from subfamily B had 1,3;1,4-beta-glucanase activity, suggesting a role for this isozyme in plant development.
