We have recently studied a family with a rare combination of two abnormal alpha-globin genes. The combination of a two-base (AA) deletion in the alpha2 polyadenylation signal (poly A) (AATAAA-->AATA- -) and a 3.7 kb alpha gene deletion, found in two children, resulted in a moderately severe thalassemic condition. Both parents and three siblings were tested and the hematological condition and molecular findings are presented. The father was born in India with Portuguese and British ancestry; the mother is of Dutch ancestry. All three siblings were born in Australia.
