A novel stress-induced gene, HEVER (Hevea ethylene-responsive) from the rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis, has been isolated and characterised. HEVER is encoded by a multigene family. The HEVER transcript is expressed at basal levels in Hevea tissues and is developmentally regulated. In addition, the HEVER transcript and protein are induced by stress treatment with salicylic acid and ethephon. Sequence analysis shows that HEVER encodes a 33 kDa protein that has significant homology to the hypothetical protein SLEXORFA-1 from the plant, Stellaria longipes, and two bacterial proteins, BAC180K-75 from Bacillus subtilis and MVRNO3-1 from Methanococcus vannielii.
