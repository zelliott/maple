Methylation of CpG dinucleotides in the promoter sequence of a gene can lead to deregulated and suppressed gene expression. In this study, we have developed procedures for methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) and sequencing analysis to determine CpG methylation status of the promoter sequences of nine circadian genes in 35 endometrial cancers (EC) and paired noncancerous endometrial tissues. DNA methylation was found in the promoter sequences of PER1, PER2, and CRY1, but not of other six circadian genes in the ECs and normal tissues examined. Eleven of the 35 EC tissues showed CpG methylation in the promoter sequences of PER1, PER2, or CRY1. Of these 11 cases, 1 had promoter methylation in all the three genes, 1 in PER1 and PER2, 3 in PER1 and CRY1, and 6 in PER1, respectively. In comparison, promoter CpG methylation of PER1, PER2, or CRY1 was found in only 7 of 35 paired noncancerous tissues including 2 in PER1 and PER2, 2 in PER1, and 3 in CRY1. In summary, promoter methylation in the PER1, PER2, or CRY1 circadian genes was detected in about one-third of EC and one-fifth of noncancerous endometrial tissues of 35 paired specimens indicating possible disruption of the circadian clock in the development of EC.
