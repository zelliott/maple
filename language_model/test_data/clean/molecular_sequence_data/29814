Wnt proteins and their receptors, members of the frizzled protein family, play a key role in regulating a wide range of developmental processes. Recently, putative regulators of Wnt signaling known as secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) have been identified in several vertebrates. Here, we describe the cloning of a novel SFRP (suSFRP1) from the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. SuSFRP1 contains a putative signal sequence, four cysteine-rich domains and a single Ig domain. The developmental expression of suSFRP1 mRNA is highly dynamic and can be separated into three phases: (1) abrupt accumulation in most or all cells of the embryo at the early blastula stage; (2) restriction of expression to the prospective endoderm and animal pole region of the gastrula; and (3) expression in prospective muscle cells of the coelomic pouches during late embryogenesis.
