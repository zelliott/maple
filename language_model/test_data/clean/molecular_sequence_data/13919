Two expression vectors have been constructed to express proteins exclusively in developing cells of Dictyostellium discoideum. In these Escherichia coli/D. discoideum shuttle vectors, proteins are synthesized under control of the promoter of the contact site A (csA) gene, which is efficiently suppressed during growth and becomes strongly activated during early development of D. discoideum. The pDcsA vectors appear to be valuable tools for the production of proteins that are not compatible with growth of D. discoideum cells.
