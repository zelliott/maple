From Bradyrhizobium japonicum highly reiterated sequence-possessing (HRS) strains indigenous to Niigata and Tokachi in Japan with high copy numbers of the repeated sequences RSalpha and RSbeta (K. Minamisawa, T. Isawa, Y. Nakatsuka, and N. Ichikawa, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 64:1845-1851, 1998), several insertion sequence (IS)-like elements were isolated by using the formation of DNA duplexes by denaturation and renaturation of total DNA, followed by treatment with S1 nuclease. Most of these sequences showed structural features of bacterial IS elements, terminal inverted repeats, and homology with known IS elements and transposase genes. HRS and non-HRS strains of B. japonicum differed markedly in the profiles obtained after hybridization with all the elements tested. In particular, HRS strains of B. japonicum contained many copies of IS1631, whereas non-HRS strains completely lacked this element. This association remained true even when many field isolates of B. japonicum were examined. Consequently, IS1631 occurrence was well correlated with B. japonicum HRS strains possessing high copy numbers of the repeated sequence RSalpha or RSbeta. DNA sequence analysis indicated that IS1631 is 2,712 bp long. In addition, IS1631 belongs to the IS21 family, as evidenced by its two open reading frames, which encode putative proteins homologous to IstA and IstB of IS21, and its terminal inverted repeat sequences with multiple short repeats.
