The cardiac natriuretic peptide family includes atrial natriuretic factor and brain or B-type natriuretic peptide, also known as iso-atrial natriuretic factor (isoANF). Although these peptides contribute to cardiovascular homeostasis, their respective roles remain unclear. To study regulation of atrial natriuretic factor and isoANF gene expression during progression of hypertension, we developed a quantitative polymerase chain reaction protocol to measure their transcript level in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) hearts. At the onset of hypertension, atrial natriuretic factor transcripts in 5-week-old SHR were 50% of those of age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, whereas the level of isoANF transcripts was similar in atria and twofold higher in ventricles. Because atria are the major sites of atrial natriuretic factor gene expression and ventricles contribute predominantly to cardiac isoANF synthesis, total atrial natriuretic factor messenger RNA (mRNA) in the hearts of 5-week-old SHR was about 50% of that in WKY rats, and total isoANF mRNA content was already higher than in control rats. In left ventricles and ventricular septa, progression of hypertension led to a maximal increase of twofold and fourfold in atrial natriuretic factor and isoANF mRNA levels, respectively, with no detectable change in right ventricles. In the atria of older SHR, atrial natriuretic factor and isoANF mRNA levels were comparable to those of age-matched controls. These data indicate that, although increased blood pressure stimulates both atrial natriuretic factor and isoANF gene expression, regulation of the two natriuretic peptide genes is not temporally coordinated in all cardiac compartments. Furthermore, isoANF mRNA is already induced in the ventricles at the onset of the hypertensive stage, and in older SHR, the isoANF gene is hyperresponsive to progression of hypertension compared with atrial natriuretic factor. Thus, isoANF might represent a very sensitive marker of cardiac changes in hypertension.
