The immunodominant merozoite/piroplasm surface antigen of Theileria parasites has potential as a diagnostic reagent and as a component of a sub-unit vaccine. This molecule is known to be antigenically diverse, and it is important to determine the nature and extent of this heterogeneity. In the present study nucleotide sequences, representing alleles of the gene (Tams1) encoding this molecule in Theileria annulata were compared to each other and to sequences of homologous genes in Theileria sergenti, Theileria buffeli and Theileria parva. This analysis revealed that a region of the polypeptide which contains putative N-linked glycosylation sites is particularly diverse and, in analogy to retroviral systems, may indicate selection of variable glycosylation sites or amino acid epitopes to evade the bovine immune response. This conclusion was also made from the results of a phylogenetic analysis which compared the variable region of the genes with a second region, which appeared to show no bias for diversity or functional constraint. The results indicated that the variable sequence encoding putative glycosylation sites has diverged, both within and between Theileria species, at a much faster rate than the rest of the molecule. Southern blot analysis of T. annulata populations from within a single geographical region detected six possible variant Tams1 alleles. However, a correlation between restriction-fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns detected by the Tams1-1 gene probe and geographical location could not be made. In addition, although a high prevalence of one particular RFLP was found, this is unlikely to be the result of a clonal population structure, as we present evidence for significant parasite genotypic variability within a single endemic region.
