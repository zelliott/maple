The proteome of Tropheryma whipplei, the intracellular bacterium responsible for Whipple's disease (WD), was analyzed using two complementary approaches: 2-DE coupled with MALDI-TOF and SDS-PAGE with nanoLC-MS/MS. This strategy led to the identification of 206 proteins of 808 predicted ORFs, resolving some questions raised by the genomic sequence of this bacterium. We successfully identified antibiotic targets and proteins with predicted N-terminal signal sequences. Additionally, we identified a family of surface proteins (known as T. whipplei surface proteins (WiSPs)), which are encoded by a unique group of species-specific genes and serve as both coding regions and DNA repeats that promote genomic recombination. Comparison of the protein expression profiles of the intracellular facultative host-associated WD bacterium with other host-associated, intracellular obligate, and environmental bacteria revealed that T. whipplei shares a proteomic expression profile with other host-associated facultative intracellular bacteria. In summary, this study describes the global protein expression pattern of T. whipplei and reveals some specific features of the T. whipplei proteome.
