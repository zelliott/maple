Recently there have been reports on high-molecular mass components of Borrelia burgdorferi, namely the p100, p94 and p83, which claimed these proteins to be specific marker antigens for the serodiagnosis of late Lyme borreliosis. The nucleotide sequences of the p100 and p83 have been published. The alignment of the deduced N-terminal amino acid sequences with the N-terminal sequence of the p94 now provides evidence that all three proteins are identical.
