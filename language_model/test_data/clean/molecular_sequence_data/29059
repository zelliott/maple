The fourth DNA-methyltransferase of the BstF5I restriction-modification (RM) system from Bacillus stearothermophilus F5 (M.BstF5I-4) was discovered, which modifies the adenine residue within the upper strand of the recognition site 5'-GGATG-3'/5'-CATCC-3'. Thus, unlike other known RM systems, the BstF5I RM system comprises four genes encoding DNA-methyltransferases, three of which possess the same substrate specificity and methylate adenine within the 5'-GGATG sequence.
