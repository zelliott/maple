The effects of bradykinin, analogs and inhibitors on the human osteoblastic osteosarcoma cell lines Saos-2 and G292 and on normal rat calvarial osteoblastic cells were investigated. In all cell types, bradykinin (1 nM-100 microM) caused significant time- and dose-dependent changes in the levels of inositol phosphates. Neomycin inhibited the inositol phosphate response to bradykinin, while indomethacin had no effect. Bradykinin also elicited a dose-dependent increase in free cytosolic calcium concentration. Bradykinin and T-kinin did not affect cyclic AMP levels in these cells. Doses of des-Arg9-bradykinin, a B1 receptor agonist, up to 100 nM did not stimulate the osteoblastic inositol phosphate response. In addition, the bradykinin-stimulated inositol phosphate response was unaffected by des-Arg9-[Leu8]-bradykinin, a B1 receptor antagonist, while it was inhibited by D-Arg-[Hyp3-[beta-(2-thienyl)-Ala]5,8-D-Phe7]-bradykinin, a B2 receptor antagonist. These results suggest that in osteoblastic cells the mechanism of action of bradykinin involves stimulation of the phosphoinositide metabolism and increases in cytosolic calcium levels through activation of B2 receptors.
