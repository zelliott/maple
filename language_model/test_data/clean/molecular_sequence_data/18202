A DNA helicase activity was detected in extracts of purified chloroplasts from the SB-1 cell line of Glycine max and partially purified by column chromatography on DEAE cellulose, phosphocellulose, and single-stranded DNA cellulose. The chloroplast helicase has a DNA-dependent ATPase activity, and its strand displacement activity is strictly dependent upon the presence of a nucleoside triphosphate and Mg2+ or Mn2+. Strand displacement activity does not require a free unannealed single-strand or replication fork-like structure.
