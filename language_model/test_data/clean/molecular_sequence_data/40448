We have cloned and analysed a laeA gene (Pci-laeA) that may control mevastatin biosynthesis in Penicillium citrinum. The full-length Pci-laeA sequence is 1,340 bp with an ORF of 1,284 bp encoding 427 amino acids. It shows 95% identity with LaeA from P. chrysogenum. The predicted molecular mass of Pci-LaeA is 48.72 kDa with an estimated theoretical isoelectric point of 6.96. Pci-LaeA has a conserved S-adenosylmethionine binding site and a potential MlcR (a pathway specific regulator in mevastatin biosynthesis) binding site.
