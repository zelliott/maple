A 6.5 kb region from the genome of the cyanobacterium, Anacystis nidulans 6301 was cloned using the tobacco chloroplast gene for ribosomal protein S12 as a probe. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of genes for ribosomal proteins S12 and S7 and elongation factors EF-G and EF-Tu in this DNA region. The arrangement is rps12 (124 codons) - 167 bp spacer - rps7 (156 codons) - 77 bp spacer - fus (694 codons) - 26 bp spacer - tufA (409 codons), which is similar to that of the Escherichia coli str operon. The deduced amino acid sequences of the A. nidulans S12 and EF-Tu show high homology (72%-82%) with the E. coli and chloroplast counterparts while those of the A. nidulans S7 and EF-G give low homology (51%-59%). Striking structural homology was found between the potential S7 binding region of 16S rRNA and the beginning of S7 mRNA, suggesting that feedback regulation of rps7 expression operates in A. nidulans.
