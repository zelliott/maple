The paradox that group-specific neutralizing antibodies (NA) exist in the majority of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients, whereas the NA response against autologous HIV-1 virus isolates is highly type-specific, motivated us to study the type- and group-specific NA responses generated upon presentation of escape virus, and the viral epitopes involved in the escape. Patients with demonstrable escape virus all developed group-specific NA, which were detectable after a delay and disappeared prior to disease development. The sera tested inhibited the binding of recombinant soluble gp120IIIB to cell-associated CD4, but group-specific virus neutralization required binding of NA to HIV-1 prior to viral attachment to target cells. Consecutive escape virus isolates were tested for sensitivity to neutralization by heterologous sera. Only minor differences were demonstrated, suggesting that the majority of the change in neutralization sensitivity is driven by the selective pressure of type-specific NA. Furthermore, no differences were observed in sensitivity to neutralization by anti-carbohydrate neutralizing monoclonal antibodies or the lectin concanavalin A, indicating a conserved nature of certain carbohydrate neutralization epitopes during escape. Finally the V3 sequence of three sets of consecutive virus isolates were analysed revealing amino acid mutations in V3 sequences of all escape virus isolates. The biological significance of these variations was confirmed further by the demonstration of changes in sensitivity to neutralization by anti-V3 monoclonal antibodies. These results strongly suggest a participation of the NA response against the V3 loop in the immunoselection of escape virus.
