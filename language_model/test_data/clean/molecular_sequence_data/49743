UVB mutagenesis is characterized by an abundance of C --> T and 5-methylcytosine --> T transitions at dipyrimidine sequences. It is not known how these mutations might arise. One hypothesis is that UV-induced mutations occur only after deamination of the cytosine or 5-methylcytosine within the pyrimidine dimer. It is not clear how methylation of cytosines at the 5-position influences deamination and how this affects mutagenesis. We have now conducted experiments with a CpG-methylated supF shuttle vector that was irradiated with UVB and then incubated at 37 degrees C to allow time for deamination before passage through a human cell line to establish mutations. This led to a significantly increased frequency of CC --> TT mutations and of transition mutations at 5'-PymCG-3' sequences. A spectrum of deaminated cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in the supF gene was determined using the mismatch glycosylase activities of MBD4 protein in combination with ligation-mediated PCR. Methylation at the C-5 position promoted the deamination of cytosines within cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, and these two events combined led to a significantly increased frequency of UVB-induced transition mutations at 5'-PymCG-3' sequences. Under these conditions, the majority of all supF mutations were transition mutations at 5'-PymCG-3', and they clustered at several mutational hot spots. Exactly these types of mutations are frequently observed in the p53 gene of nonmelanoma skin tumors. This particular mutagenic pathway may become prevalent under conditions of inefficient DNA repair and slow proliferation of cells in the human epidermis.
