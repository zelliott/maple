Src homology protein 1 (SHP-1) plays an important role in B cell Ag receptor (BCR) differentiation, proliferation, survival, and apoptosis. After BCR stimulation in apoptotic cells, SHP-1 has been shown to be recruited to phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs present in receptors such as CD22 and CD72. However, the substrates of SHP-1 in the chicken B cell line, DT40, have remained undefined. To identify SHP-1 substrates in DT40, we used a trapping mutant, SHP-1 C/S (a catalytically inactive form). Cross-linking of BCR induced hyperphosphorylation of approximately 44-kDa protein in C/S transfectants. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis revealed that this was actin (cytoplasmic type 5) carrying three immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif-like sequences. SHP-1 was shown to bind to one of these sequences in synthetic peptide binding experiment. Thus, actin is a direct SHP-1 substrate. Furthermore, more SHP-1 molecules translocate into lipid rafts, and their association with actin was increased after BCR stimulation. In C/S transfectants, actin polymerization induced by membrane IgM ligation was sustained to a greater extent for a longer time compared with wild-type transfectants. Therefore, actin dephosphorylation by SHP-1 is essential for actin depolymerization after BCR stimulation. Our data suggest that SHP-1 plays a pivotal role in reorganization of cytoskeletal architecture inducing actin dephosphorylation. These results clearly demonstrate the direct interaction of SHP-1 with actin.
