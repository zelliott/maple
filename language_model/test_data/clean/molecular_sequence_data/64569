A peptidomics approach was applied to determine the peptides in the larval central nervous system of the grey flesh fly, Neobellieria bullata. Fractions obtained by high performance liquid chromatography were analysed by MALDI-TOF and ESI-Q-TOF mass spectrometry. This provided biochemical evidence for the presence of 18 neuropeptides, 11 of which were novel Neobellieria peptides. Most prominently present were the FMRFamide-related peptides: 7 FMRFamides, 1 FIRFamide, and Neb-myosuppressin. The three putative capa-gene products Neb-pyrokinin and the periviscerokinins Neb-PVK-1 and -2 were detected, as well as another pyrokinin. This Neb-PK-2 was also present in the ring gland along with corazonin, Neb-myosuppressin, and Neb-AKH-GK, an intermediate processing product of the adipokinetic hormone. Furthermore, the central nervous system contained Neb-LFamide, proctolin, and FDFHTVamide, designated as Neb-TVamide. With this study, we considerably increased our knowledge of the neuropeptidome of the pest fly N. bullata, which is an important insect model for physiological research.
