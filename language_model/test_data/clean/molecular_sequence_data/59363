The lutoid-body (bottom) fraction of latex from the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) contains a limited number of major proteins. These are, besides the chitin-binding protein hevein, its precursor and the C-terminal fragment of this precursor, proteins with enzymic activities: three hevamine components, which are basic, vacuolar, chitinases with lysozyme activity, and a beta-1,3-glucanase. Lutoid-body fractions from three rubber-tree clones differed in their contents of these enzyme proteins. The hevamine components and glucanase were isolated and several enzymic and structural properties were investigated. These enzymes are basic proteins and cause coagulation of the negatively charged rubber particles. The coagulation occurs in a rather narrow range of ratios of added protein to rubber particles, which indicates that charg neutralization is the determining factor. Differences in coagulation of rubber particles by lutoid-body fractions from various rubber clones can be explained by their content of hevamine and glucanase. Glucanase from the lutoid-body fraction may dissolve callus tissue and this may explain the observation that rubber-tree clones with a high glucanase content in this fraction produce more latex than clones with little glucanase. Sequence studies of two CNBr peptides of the glucanase indicate that this protein is homologous with glucanases from other plants, and that a C-terminal peptide, possibly involved in vacuolar targeting, may have been cleaved off.
