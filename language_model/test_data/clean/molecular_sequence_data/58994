The collagenase type IV B gene (CLG4B) was previously mapped to human chromosome 16 by hybridization of a cDNA probe to DNAs from a somatic cell hybrid panel. We have relocalized CLG4B to chromosome 20 based on three different lines of evidence: screening a somatic cell hybrid mapping panel, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and linkage analysis using a newly identified polymorphism.
