We have optimized and improved the protocol for extraction of histone proteins from Gossypium herbaceum. Histone proteins were isolated by acid extraction method and fractionation of histone proteins were performed using RP-HPLC (reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography). Analysis of histones from drought tolerant (Vagad) and drought sensitive genotype (RAHS-14) indicated that the tolerant genotype Vagad encodes a 29 kDa protein. Protein sequencing on MALDI TOF/TOF revealed that the 29 kDA protein shared sequence similarity with another drought-inducible linker histone-H1.S reported in tomato. This H1.S like linker histone was not found in RAHS-14 in our study. We further examined the expression of H1 variant at the transcript and protein levels and found that it was induced specifically in the tolerant genotype Vagad.
