The maize Bronze2 (Bz2) gene encodes a glutathione S-transferase that is required for anthocyanin pigment accumulation. Two classes of regulatory proteins, R and C1, are required for transcriptional activation of Bz2 and several additional structural genes. Functional domains of the Bz2 promoter were identified using Bz2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter genes electroporated into maize protoplasts together with R and C1 expression plasmids. Complete regulation was conferred by 224 nt of the Bz2 promoter. Within this region at least two separable regions are independently capable of conferring regulation by R and C1. Predicted regulatory elements corresponding to two classes of sequence motifs, the Myb-box homologous 'C1-motif', TAACTG/CAGTTA, and the G-box and E-box homologous 'R-motif', CACGTG, were shown to be important for full R and C1 activation of the Bz2 promoter. Expression of reconstructed Bz2 genes with mutated promoters was quantified using RNase protection, and this analysis confirmed results obtained using reporter genes.
