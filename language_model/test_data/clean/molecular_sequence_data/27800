The asparagine-linked sugar chains of fibronectin purified from human placenta were quantitatively released as oligosaccharides by hydrazinolysis. After N-acetylation, they were converted to radioactive oligosaccharides by NaB3H4 reduction. The radioactive oligosaccharides were fractionated by their charge on an anion-exchange column chromatography. All of the acidic oligosaccharides could be converted to neutral oligosaccharides by sialidase digestion. These oligosaccharides were then fractionated by serial affinity chromatography using immobilized lectin columns. Study of each oligosaccharide by sequential exoglycosidase digestion and methylation analysis revealed the following information as to the structures of the sugar chains of human placental fibronectin: 1) nine sugar chains are included in one molecule; 2) all sialic acid residues are exclusively linked at the C-3 position of the galactose residues; 3) bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary complex-type oligosaccharides with the Man alpha 1----6(Man alpha 1----3)Man beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----4 (+/- Fuc alpha 1----6)-GlcNac as their cores were found; 4) the bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residue and the Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----repeating groups are included in some of the sugar chains.
