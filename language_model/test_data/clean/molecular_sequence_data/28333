In this study, we use antisera to synthetic beta-amyloid protein precursor (beta APP) peptides to identify, in human brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), soluble approximately 125- and approximately 105-kDa derivatives of the beta APP that lack the carboxyl terminus of the full-length, membrane-associated forms. We show that the soluble approximately 125-kDa beta APP derivative contains the Kunitz protease inhibitor domain, whereas the approximately 105-kDa form does not, and we confirm that these two proteins are soluble beta APP derivatives by purifying each from human CSF and directly sequencing its amino terminus.
