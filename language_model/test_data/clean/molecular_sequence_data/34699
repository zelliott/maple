Metabolites of arachidonic acid produced by P450 are interesting substances with prominent physiological functions. To elucidate the physiological function of P450, it is necessary to identify a specific P450 in a particular tissue or organ and to characterize its catalytic activities. In this study, the expression of CYP2A1, 2B1, 2C23, 2J3, and 4F1 was investigated in liver, lung, kidney, spleen, heart, brain, and testis of rats by RT-PCR. Furthermore, arachidonic acid metabolism was investigated using the rat P450s described above and human CYP2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C18, 2C19, 2J2, and 4F2. Among the rat P450s, CYP2B1 and 2C23 efficiently produced EETs and CYP4F1 produced 19/20-HETE in abundace. CYP2B1 was specifically expressed in the lung. CYP2C23 was detected in all tissues used in this study. CYP4F1 was expressed in the kidney as well as in the liver. Among the human P450s, CYP2C9 and 2C19 efficiently produced EETs. CYP4F2 produced 19/20-HETE. The catalytic properties of rat CYP2C23 were similar to those of human CYP2C9 and 2C19. The catalytic properties of CYP4F isoforms were also similar between humans and rats. A systematic analysis of P450 expression in various tissues and of its catalytic property may provide valuable information on the physiological roles of P450s in each tissue.
