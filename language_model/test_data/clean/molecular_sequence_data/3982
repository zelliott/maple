In this study we used nucleotide sequences from a segment of mitochondrial 16S ribosomal DNA gene to investigate the evolutionary relationships of some French Guiana Hylinae. New sequences, representing the members of different French Guiana frogs-five specimens of the Scinax genus, two Hyla, one Osteocephalus, one Hyalinobatrachium and two Rana as out-group-were examined. In addition, 26 sequences available from GenBank database representing the other subfamilies of the Hylidae were added to our study. This work allowed us to clarify relationships within the four hylids subfamilies (Pelodryadinae, Phyllomedusinae, Hemiphractinae and Hylinae) and the phylogenetic placement of the enigmatic Scinax genus within the Hylidae. We found that: (1) the Scinax genus displays a high level of differentiation in comparison to two other genera (Litoria and Hyla) belonging to 'Hylidae' family; (2) the Hylinae are paraphyletic given the position of the Litoria, which was the sister-group of the Hyla and the Osteocephalus genera; (3) the anterior works and our results (based on two different data sets) showed the paraphyly of the Hylidae questioning the validity of this family; (4) the reassessment of these different taxonomic groups will induce a huge implication on the estimation (past, present and future) of the biodiversity (in Neotropical frogs).
