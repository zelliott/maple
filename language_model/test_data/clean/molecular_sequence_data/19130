Culture-dependent evaluation of the bacteria was carried out on gastropods, such as Monodonta lineata, Gibbula umbilicalis, Nucella lapillus and Patella intermedia, and the environmental samples (biofilm and surrounding sea water) collected from six different locations of Northern Portugal coastal area to investigate the interactions between the microbes in the viscera of gastropods and in the environment. A total of 141 isolates and 39 operational taxonomic units were identified. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene showed that bacterial isolates are highly diverse and most of them were found in other marine environment. The observed bacterial diversity was distributed over five different classes (Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Flavobacteria, Bacilli and Actinobacteria) with the greatest number of 16S rRNA gene sequence derived from the Gammaproteobacteria (77Â %). Vibrio is found to be the dominant one among the different bacterial species isolated. The results suggest that the microorganisms in the environment are maintained in the viscera of the gastropods which may have a key role in the metabolic functions.
