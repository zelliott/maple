Koi herpesvirus (KHV) is the aetiological agent of an emerging disease (KHVD) associated with mass mortalities in koi and common carp and reported from at least 30 countries. We report the first isolation of KHV from koi and common carp in Indonesia and initial characterization of the isolates. Clinical signs, histopathology and virion morphology are similar to those of isolates from other countries. Phylogenetic analyses using the thymidine kinase gene amplified from each isolate and from carp tissue samples collected from KHVD outbreaks throughout Indonesia indicated that the Indonesian isolates are more closely related to the Asian than the European KHV lineage. Sequence analysis of two other variable regions between ORF29 and ORF31 (marker I) and near the start of ORF 133 (marker II) indicated that all Indonesian isolates displayed a marker I allele (I(++)) previously identified only in isolates of the Asian lineage. However, in the marker II region, all Indonesian isolates displayed the II(-) allele, which has been reported previously only amongst isolates of the European lineage, and nine of these displayed a mixed genotype (II(+)II(-)). The I(++)II(-) genotype has not been reported previously and appears to represent a new intermediate lineage that may have emerged in Indonesia.
