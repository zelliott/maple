We have constructed a general-use vector for the cloning and stable expression of foreign genes in the chromosome of attenuated Salmonella typhimurium. Using this chromosomal expression vector (CEV), we expressed the circumsporozoite (CS) gene of the mouse malaria Plasmodium yoelii in an aroA S. typhimurium strain. Mice immunized with CS-expressing Salmonella recombinants mount a CS-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response. This is the first demonstration that attenuated Salmonella can elicit a specific CTL response to a foreign protein in mice. The ability to easily and stably express foreign genes from the Salmonella chromosome and the generation of specific CTL greatly expands the potential of Salmonella as an antigen-delivery system.
