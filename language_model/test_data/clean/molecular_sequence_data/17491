Eukaryotic DNA replication initiates at many sites on each chromosome during the S phase of the cell cycle. Each origin of replication lies in a unique chromosomal environment and can be regulated in different cell types both at the level of utilization and the time of initiation during S phase. In this review, we examine the control and the mechanism of eukaryotic origin function.
