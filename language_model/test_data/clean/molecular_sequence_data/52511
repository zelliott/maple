Cytochromes c6 from the green algae Chlorella vulgaris CK-5 (CK5cyc6) and C. vulgaris CK-22 (CK22cyc6) were characterized and their amino acid sequences were analyzed. CK5cyc6 had a molecular mass of 9.3 kDa, isoelectric points of 3.0 (reduced) and 3.6 (oxidized), and a redox potential of +362 mV at pH 7.0. CK22cyc6 had a molecular mass of 9.5 kDa, isoelectric points of 2.9 (reduced) and 3.5 (oxidized), and a redox potential of +355 mV at pH 7.0. The absorption spectra of both cytochromes c6 showed 4 maxima in reduced form, and 2 maxima and a weak peak at 695 nm in oxidized form. The pyridine ferrohemochrome spectra indicated that their prosthetic group was heme c. These physicochemical properties were similar to those of other algal cytochromes c6. The amino acids (88 residues) of CK5cyc6 and CK22cyc6 were sequenced and the sequence motif -CXXCH-, which is typical of the heme-binding site of c-type cytochrome, was clearly confirmed in both cytochromes. Twenty-six amino acid residues were substituted, and the similarity score of each of them was 70.45%.
