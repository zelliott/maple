The antimicrobial peptide magainin 2 isolated from the skin of the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis crosses lipid bilayers by transiently forming a peptide-lipid supramolecular complex pore inducing membrane permeabilization and flip-flop of membrane lipids [Matsuzaki, K., Murase, O., Fujii, N., and Miyajima, K. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 11361-11368]. In contrast, the antimicrobial peptide buforin 2 discovered in the stomach tissue of the Asian toad Bufo bufo gargarizans efficiently crosses lipid bilayers without inducing severe membrane permeabilization or lipid flip-flop, and the Pro(11) residue plays a key role in this unique property [Kobayashi, S, Takeshima, K., Park, C. B., Kim, S. C., and Matsuzaki, K. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 8648-8654]. To elucidate the translocation mechanism, the secondary structure and the orientation of the peptide in lipid bilayers as well as the effects of the peptide concentration, the lipid composition, and the cis-trans isomerization of the Pro peptide bond on translocation efficiency were investigated. The translocation efficiencies of F10W-buforin 2 (BF2), P11A-BF2, and F5W-magainin 2 (MG2) across egg yolk L-alpha-phosphatidyl-DL-glycerol (EYPG)/egg yolk L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine (1/1) bilayers were dependent supralinearly on the peptide concentration, suggesting that the translocation mechanisms of these peptides are similar. The incorporation of the negative curvature-inducing lipid egg yolk L-alpha -phosphatidylethanolamine completely suppressed the translocation of BF2, indicating the induction of the positive curvature by BF2 on the membrane is related to the translocation process, similarly to MG2. In pure EYPG, where the repulsion between polycationic BF2 molecules is reduced, membrane permeabilization and coupling lipid flip-flop were clearly observed. Structural studies by use of Fourier transform infrared-polarized attenuated total reflection spectroscopy indicated that BF2 assumed distorted helical structures in EYPG/EYPC bilayers. A BF2 analogue with an alpha-methylproline, which fixed the peptide bond to the trans configuration, translocated similarly to the parent peptide, suggesting the cis-trans isomerization of the Pro peptide bond is not involved in the translocation process. These results indicate that BF2 crosses lipid bilayers via a mechanism similar to that of MG2. The presence of Pro(11) distorts the helix, concentrating basic amino acid residues in a limited amphipathic region, thus destabilizing the pore by enhanced electrostatic repulsion, enabling efficient translocation.
