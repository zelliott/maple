Type X collagen, a homotrimer of alpha 1 (X) polypeptide chains, is specifically expressed by hypertrophic chondrocytes in regions of cartilage undergoing endochondral ossification. We have previously characterized a genomic clone containing the major part of the mouse type X collagen gene (col10a1) and assigned the locus for col10a1 to mouse chromosome 10 (Apte et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 224: 217-224, 1992). In this paper, through additional characterization of cDNA and genomic clones, we describe the complete organization of the col10a1 gene. The col10a1 gene is 7.2 kb in size and, as in the chick, col10a1 gene transcripts are generated from only three exons. Exon 1 encodes only the 5' untranslated (5' UT) region of the mRNA and is separated from exon 2 by an intron 562 bp in length. Exon 2 (169 bp) encodes 15 bp of 5' UT message, the translation start plus 17-amino acid residues of the putative signal peptide, and 33 1/3 codons of the putative N-terminal non-collagenous (NC2) domain of type X collagen. Exon 3 is 2854 bp in size and encodes 4 2/3 codons of the NC2 domain, the entire collagenous domain of 463 residues (COL), the entire C-terminal non-collagenous (NC1) domain (161 amino acid residues) and the entire 965 bp 3' untranslated (3' UT) sequence of the mRNA. Two TATA boxes are present in tandem in the col10a1 promotor. Both TATA boxes are active in transcription, generating two populations of transcripts with different 5'-termini; the longer transcript is of low abundance and is detectable only by PCR in newborn mice. The col10a1 promotor contains a CCAAT box as well as other consensus sequence elements required for binding of potential transcription factors. Characterization of the col10a1 gene provides data essential for studies of the regulation of type X collagen expression during mammalian endochondral bone growth and development. Knowledge of the complete structure of the mouse type X collagen gene will also be useful for the investigation of type X collagen gene abnormalities in murine chondrodysplasias and for the generation of transgenic mice.
