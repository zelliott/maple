Pancreatic polypeptide is derived from a polyprotein precursor molecule. Although the amino acid sequences specifying the signal peptide and pancreatic polypeptide are well conserved between the rat and the human, the carboxy-terminal amino acid sequences of the precursors are highly divergent. To better understand the molecular basis of the divergence between the rat and human C-terminal peptides, we have determined the nucleotide sequence of the rat pancreatic polypeptide gene. A comparison between the primary structures of the rat and human genes reveals that the heterogeneity of the C-terminal peptides can be explained in large part by a frameshift mutation and the utilization of an alternative splice donor site in the third exon of the rat gene. As a consequence of the displaced splice site, part of the third exon of the rate gene is homologous to the sequence in the third intron of the human gene. Our results suggest that the rat and human pancreatic polypeptide genes arose from a common ancestral gene, and that differences in the C-terminal domains of the precursor reflect less strict evolutionary constraints than those imposed upon the amino-terminal domains of the precursor.
