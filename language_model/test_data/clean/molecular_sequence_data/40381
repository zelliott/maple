A Gram-negative, motile, non-spore-forming bacterial strain, designated HU1-GD12(T), was isolated from freshwater sediment. The strain was characterized by using a polyphasic approach in order to determine its taxonomic position. Comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that the isolate constituted a distinct branch within the genus Sphingobium, showing the highest level of sequence similarity with respect to Sphingobium ummariense RL-3(T) (96.2â€Š%). Strain HU1-GD12(T) had a genomic DNA G+C content of 66.8 mol% and Q-10 as the predominant respiratory quinone. Furthermore, the major polyamine component (spermidine) in the cytoplasm and the presence of sphingoglycolipids suggested that strain HU1-GD12(T) belonged to the family Sphingomonadaceae. On the basis of its phenotypic properties and phylogenetic distinctiveness, strain HU1-GD12(T) represents a novel species of the genus Sphingobium, for which the name Sphingobium vulgare sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is HU1-GD12(T) (=LMG 24321(T)=KCTC 22289(T)).
