To determine the prevalent subtypes of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) present in the domestic cat population of Australia.

Blood samples were collected from 41 FIV antibody positive cats from four cities across Australia. Following DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to amplify the variable V3-V5 region of the envelope (env) gene. Genotypes were assessed by direct sequencing of PCR products and comparison with previously reported FIV sequences. Phylogenetic analysis allowed classification of the Australian sequences into the appropriate subtype.

Of the 41 FIV samples, 40 were found to cluster with previously reported subtype A isolates, whilst the remaining sample grouped within subtype B.

Subtype A was found to be the predominant FIV subtype present in Australia, although subtype B was also found. These results broaden our knowledge of the genetic diversity of FIV and the associated implications for preventative, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.
