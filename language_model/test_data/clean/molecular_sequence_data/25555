Two P-elements (bif1 and bif2) were isolated from a genomic library of Drosophila bifasciata. Both elements are internally deleted and have lost the coding capacity for a functional transposase. One of the elements (bif2) contains an insert consisting of a repetitive sequence. The terminal inverted repeats and the segments necessary for passive mobility are well conserved. Element bif2 has retained rudiments of the coding sequence of exon 0 and exon 3, but the reading frame is destroyed by insertions and deletions. The comparison of the D. bifasciata P-elements with P-elements of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila nebulosa reveals that the two latter sequences are more similar to each other than either of them is to the D. bifasciata elements. This finding contradicts the phylogenetic relationship of the species and can be taken as an indirect but unequivocal evidence for recent horizontal gene transfer from a relative of D. nebulosa to the gene pool of D. melanogaster. The P-elements of D. bifasciata are phylogenetically ancient and have evolved independently for about 50 million years. A higher substitution rate at the third codon position as well as a predominance of conservative replacements at the amino acid level indicates that the P-elements of D. bifasciata have been under selective constraint over a long period and that immunobilization has occurred only recently.
