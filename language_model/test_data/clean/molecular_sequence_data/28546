As with most G-protein-coupled receptors, repeated agonist stimulation of the platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) results in its desensitization, sequestration, and internalization. In this report, we show that agonist-induced PAFR internalization is independent of G-protein activation but is dependent on arrestins and involves the interaction of arrestins with a limited region of the PAFR C terminus. In cotransfected COS-7 cells, both arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 could be coimmunoprecipitated with PAFR, and agonist stimulation of PAFR induced the translocation of both arrestin-2 and arrestin-3. Furthermore, coexpression of arrestin-2 with PAFR potentiated receptor internalization, whereas agonist-induced PAFR internalization was inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of arrestin-2. The coexpression of a minigene encoding the C-terminal segment of the receptor abolished PAF-induced arrestin translocation and inhibited PAFR internalization. Using C terminus deletion mutants, we determined that the association of arrestin-2 with the receptor was dependent on the region between threonine 305 and valine 330 because arrestin-2 could be immunoprecipitated with the mutant PAFRstop330 but not PAFRstop305. Consistently, stop330 could mediate agonist-induced arrestin-2 translocation, whereas stop305 could not. Two other deletion mutants with slightly longer regions of the C terminus, PAFRstop311 and PAFRstop317, also failed to induce arrestin-2 translocation. Finally, the PAFR mutant Y293A, containing a single substitution in the putative internalization motif DPXXY in the seventh transmembrane domain (which we had shown to be able to internalize but not to couple to G-proteins) could efficiently induce arrestin translocation. Taken together, our results indicate that ligand-induced PAFR internalization is dependent on arrestins, that PAFR can associate with both arrestin-2 and -3, and that their translocation involves interaction with the region of residues 318-330 in the PAFR C terminus but is independent of G-protein activation.
