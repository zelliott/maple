Characterization and identification of strain CW 1 ( = JCM 17161) isolated from corn silage were performed. Strain CW 1 was a Gram-positive, catalase-negative and homofermentative rod that produced the DL-form of lactic acid. This strain exhibited more than 99.6% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and greater than 82% DNA-DNA reassociation with type strains of Lactobacillus kimchii, L. bobalius and L. paralimentarius. To clarify the taxonomic positions of these type strains, phenotypic characterization, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, ribotyping and DNA-DNA relatedness were examined. The three type strains displayed different L-arabinose, lactose, melibiose, melezitose, raffinose and N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase fermentation patterns. Phylogenetic analysis showed that L. paralimentarius is a closer neighbour of L. kimchii and L. bobalius, sharing 99.5-99.9% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, which was confirmed by the high DNA-DNA relatedness (≥82%) between L. paralimentarius JCM 10415(T), L. bobalius JCM 16180(T) and L. kimchii JCM 10707(T). Therefore, it is proposed that L. kimchii and L. bobalius should be reclassified as later synonyms of L. paralimentarius.
