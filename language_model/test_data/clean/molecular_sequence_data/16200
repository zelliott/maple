Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) has been purified and the mRNA cloned from a number of mammalian species including human, murine, bovine, porcine, and simian. Using a human TGF beta 1 cDNA probe, we have detected two distinct TGF beta RNAs in cultured primary chick embryo chondrocytes. One of these RNAs, migrating at about 1.7 kilobases, shows similarity to mammalian TGF beta 1. The second RNA, migrating at about 3 kilobases, is a novel TGF beta mRNA which we have named TGF beta 3. Clones corresponding to each of these RNAs were isolated from a cultured primary chick embryo chondrocyte cDNA library. Two cDNA clones for TGF beta 3, pTGFB-ChX17 and pTGFB-ChX25, contained a 39 nucleotide-long 5'-untranslated region, a 1236 nucleotide-long coding region, and a 911 nucleotide-long 3'-untranslated region. The predicted protein includes a signal peptide of 20-23 amino acids as in human TGF beta 1 and 2, and a precursor protein consisting of 412 amino acids, which can be cleaved at a lys-arg site to produce a 112 amino acid processed peptide containing nine cysteine residues in the same positions as in human TGF beta 1 and 2. At the nucleotide level, the processed coding region of TGF beta 3 shows 72% and 76% identity with the processed coding regions of human TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 2, respectively; at the amino acid level, TGF beta 3 shows 76% identity with TGF beta 1 and 79% identity with TGF beta 2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
