One of the important sites of peroxynitrite action that affects cellular function is known to be nitration of tyrosine residues. However, tryptophan residues could be another target of peroxynitrite-dependent modification of protein function, as we have shown previously using a model protein (F. Yamakura et al., J. Biochem. 138:57-69; 2005). Here, we report the identification of several proteins that allowed us to determine the position of nitrotryptophan in their amino acid sequences in a more complex system. We modified lysates from PC12 cells with and without nerve growth factor (NGF) by treatment with peroxynitrite (0.98 or 4.9 mM). Western blot analyses using anti-6-nitrotryptophan antibody showed several immunoreactive bands and spots, which were subsequently subjected to trypsin digestion and LC-ESI-MS-MS analysis. We identified several tryptic peptides including nitrotryptophan residues, which were derived from L-lactate dehydrogenase A, malate dehydrogenase 1, M2 pyruvate kinase, and heat-shock protein 90 Î±, in peroxynitrite-treated lysates from PC12 cells, and l-lactate dehydrogenase A, malate dehydrogenase 1, transaldorase, and lactoylglutathione lyase, in peroxynitrite-treated lysates from NGF/PC12 cells. The molar ratio of 3-nitrotyrosine to 6-nitrotryptophan in protease-digested PC12 cell lysates treated with peroxynitrite was determined to be 5.8 to 1 by using an HPLC-CoulArray system. This is the first report to identify several specific sites of nitrated tryptophan on proteins in a complex system treated with peroxynitrite and to compare the susceptibility of nitration between tryptophan and tyrosine residues of the proteins.
