In an attempt to determine whether phagocytosis of collagen by fibroblasts involves binding of the fibril to the plasma membrane, the effect of the lectin concanavalin A (Con A) was studied in an in vitro model system. Metacarpal bone rudiments from 19-day-old mouse fetuses were incubated with varying concentrations of the lectin. Quantitative electron microscopic analysis indicated that Con A caused a dose-related increase in the amount of phagocytosed collagen fibrils in periosteal fibroblasts, suggesting either an enhanced uptake or a decreased intracellular breakdown of fibrils. Since a Con A-inducible increase was not seen in the combined presence of both the lectin and the proteinase inhibitor leupeptin, which is known to inhibit the intracellular digestion of phagocytosed fibrillar collagen, it is unlikely that Con A stimulated phagocytosis. Based on the finding that Con A interfered with the digestion of a synthetic substrate by the collagenolytic lysosomal enzyme cathepsin B it is suggested that the augmentation of intracellular fibrillar collagen under the influence of the lectin was due to a decreased intracellular digestion. Since Con A did not inhibit the uptake of collagen fibrils by the fibroblasts it is concluded that Con A-inhibitable binding sites for collagen molecules are unlikely to be involved in phagocytosis of collagen fibrils by fibroblasts.
