This work reports the synthesis and the biological validation of a trisaccharide analogue of the HNK-1 epitope. The 3-O-sulfo-β-d-GlcpA-(1→3)-β-d-Galp-(1→4)-β-d-Glcp-allyl has been prepared by enzymatic glucuronylation of allyl lactoside by an engineered recombinant Escherichia coli strain followed by a chemoselective sulfation. Subsequent covalent attachment of the ozone-oxidised trisaccharide to bovine serum albumin provided a neo-glycoconjugate, which has been interrogated with antibodies specific to the human natural killer carbohydrate epitope HNK-1. ELISA assays confirmed the absolute requirement of the sulfate group for protein recognition and the potential application of this synthetic oligosaccharide as HNK-1 surrogate.
