Efficient and economic DNA nanomaterials that can work as logic components are necessary for the development of DNA computers with high speed and outstanding data storage capacity. A new molecular catalytic beacon (MCB) and a series of label-free colorimetric logic gates based on the formation and dissociation of G-quadruplex DNAzyme were established in this work. These logic gates (NOT, NOR, IMPLICATION, AND, OR and INHIBIT) were realized by the interaction between the special designed oligonucleotide hairpins and the short input single strand complementary DNA. We were able to recognize the logic output signals effortlessly by our naked eyes. It is a simple, economic and safe approach for the design of complex multiple input DNA logic molecular device.
