Higher plant chloroplast ribosomes contain several novel protein components whose homologues are not present in the eubacterial E. coli ribosome, indicating a complex evolution of the chloroplast translational apparatus following the endosymbiotic event. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of a new small protein from spinach chloroplast ribosome which has, based on the amino acid sequence and immunological data, no counterpart in the E. coli ribosome. We suggest a nomenclature suitable for this protein and other novel proteins in the chloroplast ribosome.
