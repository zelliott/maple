In all fields of molecular biology, researchers are increasingly challenged by experiments planned and evaluated on the basis of nucleic acid and protein sequence data generally retrieved from public databases. Despite the wide spectrum of available Web-based software tools for sequence analysis, the routine use of these tools has disadvantages, particularly because of the elaborate and heterogeneous ways of data input, output, and storage. Here we present a Visual Basic-encoded Microsoft Word Add-In, the Molecular BioComputing Suite (MBCS), available at the BioTechniques Software Library (www.BioTechniques.com). The MBCS software aims to manage and expedite a wide range of sequence analyses and manipulations using an integrated text editor environment including menu-guided commands. Its independence of sequence formats enables MBCS to be used as a pivotal application between other software tools for sequence analysis, manipulation, annotation, and editing.
