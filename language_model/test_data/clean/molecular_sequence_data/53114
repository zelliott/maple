Smads are intracellular signaling mediators for TGF-beta superfamily. Smad1 and Smad5 are activated by BMP receptors. Here, we have cloned mouse Smad8 and functionally characterized its ability to transduce signals from BMP receptors. Constitutively active BMP type I receptors, ALK-3 and ALK-6, as well as ALK-2, were phosphorylated Smad8 and induced Smad8 interaction with Smad4. Nuclear translocation of Smad8 was stimulated by constitutively active BMP type I receptors. In contrast, constitutively active TGF-beta type I receptor, ALK-5, did not exhibit any action on Smad8. Smad8 and Smad4 cooperatively induced the promoter of Xvent2, a homeobox gene that responds specifically to BMP signaling. Dominant-negative Smad8 was shown to inhibit the increase of alkaline phosphatase activity induced by BMP-2 on pluripotent mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 and myoblastic C2C12 cell lines. The presence of Smad8 mRNA in mouse calvaria cells and osteoblasts suggests a role of Smad8 in the osteoblast differentiation and maturation.
