Androgen receptors (ARs) belong to the family of hormone receptors that are ligand-dependent transcription factors. Endocrine therapy provides effective treatment for prostate cancer until mutations arise that alter the ligand responsiveness of AR. In this study, structural models were developed for the functional domains of human AR by homology modeling from crystal structures of closely related nuclear receptors. These models were used to locate the sites of two frequently occurring mutations in prostate cancer. The substitutions that develop in LNCaP (threonine-->alanine at residue 877) and CWR22 (histidine-->tyrosine at residue 874) tumor cell lines are both located on helix 11 that forms part of the ligand-binding pocket. However, the results suggest that these mutations influence ligand responsiveness by completely different mechanisms. Residue 877 contacts the ligand directly, and substitution at this site alters the stereochemistry of the binding pocket. Thus, the LNCaP mutation apparently broadens the specificity of ligand recognition. In contrast, residue 874 is located down the helical axis, projects away from the ligand pocket, and does not contact ligand. The side chain of residue 874 lies in a cavity between helices 11 and 12. Substitution of tyrosine for histidine 874 in CWR22 tumors may affect a conformational change of helix 12 and, thus, influence binding of coactivator proteins and their regulatory effect on transcriptional activation.
