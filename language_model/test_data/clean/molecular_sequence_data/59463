A cDNA and a gene encoding the nematode (C. elegans) ribosomal protein L3 have been cloned and sequenced. The nearly full-length cDNA is 1255 bp in size except for the poly (A) tail. The encoded protein consists of 401 amino acids and has calculated molecular weight of 45,657 daltons. The gene sequence determined is 1649 bp and consists of four exons. The sequence of the nematode protein shows high homology to other eukaryotic proteins.
