Several staphylococcal plasmids (26-45 kb) carry all three streptogramin-resistance (Sg(R)) genes, vat, vgb, and vga. Seven such plasmids harbored by independent strains belonging to three taxa (Staphylococcus aureus, S. simulans, and S. cohnii subsp. urealyticum) were compared and the deleted derivative of one of them, pIP680 (11.3 kb), carrying the three streptogramin-resistance genes was sequenced. The seven native plasmids had in common a 12.1-kb part cocarrying the three Sg(R) genes. Sequence analysis of pIP680 revealed that the simultaneous presence of these three genes has probably resulted from cointegration of two plasmids: (i) a pAMbeta1-like plasmid harboring vat-vgb and whose replication gene has been inactivated by an IS257 insertion and (ii) a functional vga plasmid whose replication is similar to that of two staphylococcal plasmids, pSX267 and pSK41.
