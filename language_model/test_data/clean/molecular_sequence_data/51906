The complete nucleotide sequence of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens recA gene was determined. A comparison of the translated open reading frame of the gene with other known recA sequences revealed significant sequence conservation. However, unlike its Escherichia coli equivalent, A. tumefaciens recA lacks the upstream 'SOS box', suggesting a different mechanism of regulation for this gene.
