Out of 200 serum samples collected from cattle (142) and buffaloes (58) of various ages and sexand subjected to latex agglutination test (LAT) using serotype specific peptides (O, A, Asia 1) and also with peptide for non-structural protein 2B (NSP-2B), 114 (70%) samples were positive against FMDV type 'O', 102 (51%) against serotype 'A' and 104 (52%) against serotype 'Asia 1'. With NSP-2B peptide a total of 71 (35.5%) samples were positive. The results suggest that LAT could be used for the diagnosis of foot and mouth disease virus as it is easy, cheap and effective test.
