N-Alkylpurines induced in DNA by simple monofunctional alkylating agents are known to be cytotoxic and possibly indirectly mutagenic. These adducts are removed by the ubiquitous N-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase (MPG) in a multistep repair pathway. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell clones expressing 2- to 16-fold enhanced levels of MPG activity were isolated from cells stably transfected with human MPG cDNA expression plasmids. The in vivo removal of 3-methyladenine and 7-methylguanine from some of these lines was analyzed and was observed to reflect their MPG levels. These cell lines did not develop increased resistance, as compared to the control, in regards to cytotoxic, mutagenic and sister chromatid exchange inducing effects of the alkylating agents that induce 3-alkyladenine and 7-alkylguanine as the major alkyl adducts in DNA. These results suggest that the MPG activity is not limiting in the multi-step repair pathway of N-alkylpurines in CHO cells.
