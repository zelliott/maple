Despite the widely accepted view that transcription of gid and mioC is required for efficient initiation of cloned oriC, we show that these transcriptions have very little effect on initiation of chromosome replication at wild-type chromosomal oriC. Furthermore, neither gid nor mioC transcription is required in cells deficient in the histone-like proteins Fis or IHF. However, oriC that is sufficiently impaired for initiation by deletion of DnaA box R4 requires transcription of at least one of these genes. We conclude that transcription of mioC and especially gid is needed to activate oriC only under suboptimal conditions. We suggest that either the rifampicin-sensitive step of initiation is some other transcription occurring from promoter(s) within oriC, or the original inference of transcriptional activation derived from the rifampicin experiments is incorrect.
