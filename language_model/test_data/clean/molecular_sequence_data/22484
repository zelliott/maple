Data on the structure and temperature-dependent variations of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Yersinia pestis are summarized and compared with data of other enteric bacteria, including other Yersinia spp. A correlation between the LPS structure and properties of the LPS and bacterial cultures as well as the LPS biosynthesis control are briefly discussed.
