In order to clarify the relationship between salt-tolerance of Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and the function of Na+/H(+)-antiporter, a gene was isolated from Z. rouxii which exhibited homology to the Na+/H(+)-antiporter gene (sod2) from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. This newly isolated gene (Z-SOD2) encoded a product of 791 amino acids, which was larger than the product encoded by its Sz. pombe homologue. The predicted amino-acid sequence of Z-Sod2p was highly homologous to that of the Sz. pombe protein, but included an extra-hydrophilic stretch in the C-terminal region. The expression of Z-SOD2 was constitutive and independent of NaCl-shock. Z-SOD2-disruptants of Z. rouxii did not grow in media supplemented with 3 M-NaCl, but grew well in the presence of 50% sorbitol, indicating that the function of Z-SOD2 was closely related to the salt-tolerance of Z. rouxii. Several genes are also compared and discussed in relation to the salt-tolerance of Z. rouxii.
