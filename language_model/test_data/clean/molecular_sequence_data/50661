Respiratory syncytial virus strains (subgroup A) isolated from around the world during the period 1988-1991 were analysed to determine their relatedness. Analysis was by restriction mapping and nucleotide sequencing following amplification of selected regions of the virus genome by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Twenty-three viruses of subgroup A isolated from cities in temperate regions of the Northern and Southern hemispheres and the tropics during the period 1988-1991 fell into distinct groupings closely related to four of the six lineages defined in analysis of recurrent epidemics within the same city (Birmingham, UK) during the same period. These observations confirm that multiple lineages of RS virus co-circulate locally, and show that very similar viruses are present simultaneously in widely separated countries.
