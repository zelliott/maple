The toll-like receptors (TLRs) detect molecular signatures of invaders known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Ten members of the TLR family have been identified in cattle to date and 4 of these recognize PAMPs specific to viruses (TLRs 3, 7, 8, 9). The objective of this work was to detect polymorphisms in the genomic sequences of bovine TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9. To achieve this objective, a panel of nine breeds representing Bos taurus and Bos indicus was assembled for sequencing and comparison with the Bovine Genome Project sequence. Comparative sequence analysis revealed a total of 139 polymorphisms, which include single-nucleotide polymorphisms and insertion-deletion polymorphisms. Of the 139 polymorphisms, 88% (N=123) are novel. In addition, the protein domain architecture of these four TLRs was examined between human, mouse, cow, and dog, which revealed several regions of conservation in the TLR variable leucine-rich-repeat patterning.
