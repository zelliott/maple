NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I ) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone coupled to proton translocation across the membrane. The cDNA sequence of Dunaliella salina mitochondrial NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase 19-kD subunit contains a 682-bp ORF encoding a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 19 kD. The sequence has been submitted to the GenBank database under Accession No. EF566890 (cDNA sequences) and EF566891 (genomic sequence). The deduced amino-acid sequence is 74% identical to Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase 18-kD subunit. The 19-kD subunit mRNA expression was observed in oxygen deficiency, salt treatment, and rotenone treatment with lower levels. It demonstrate that the 19-kD subunit of Complex I from Dunaliella salina is regulated by these stresses.
