A low-affinity glucose transporter gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was cloned by complementation of the rag1 mutation in a strain of Kluyveromyces lactis defective in low-affinity glucose transport. Gene sequence and effects of null mutation in S. cerevisiae were described. Data indicated that there are multiple genes for low-affinity glucose transport.
