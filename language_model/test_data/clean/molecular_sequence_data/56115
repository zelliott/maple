In immunoblot analysis, a murine monoclonal antibody (MAb), 27-1, which was produced to an outer membrane protein (OMP) of Haemophilus somnus, showed that a major OMP is heat modifiable, having a molecular mass of 28 kDa when the N-lauroylsarcosine-insoluble OMP preparation was solubilized at 60 degrees C and a mass of 37 kDa when the OMP preparation was solubilized at 100 degrees C. The heat-modifiable OMP reacted intensely with convalescent sera obtained from calves with experimental H. somnus pneumonia in immunoblot analysis. Immunoelectron microscopic and antibody absorption studies revealed that the MAb 27-1 epitope was not surface exposed on the intact bacterium. However, a decrease in antibody reactivity to the heat-modifiable OMP in immunoblot analysis after absorption of convalescent serum with intact bacterial cells of H. somnus suggests that a surface-exposed portion of the heat-modifiable OMP is expressed on the intact bacterium. MAb 27-1 reacted with 45 of 45 strains of H. somnus tested in immunoblot analysis. The apparent molecular mass of the antigen varied among strains, and five reactivity patterns demonstrated by MAb 27-1 were observed. MAb 27-1 also reacted with six species in the family Pasteurellaceae, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella dublin, but not with the other eight species of gram-negative bacteria. The heat-modifiable OMP of H. somnus showed immunological cross-reactivity with the OmpA protein of E. coli K-12 and significant N-terminal amino acid sequence homology with the OmpA proteins of gram-negative bacteria. We conclude that a major, 37-kDa heat-modifiable OMP of H. somnus, which elicits an antibody response in H. somnus-infected animals, is a common antigen among H. somnus strains tested and is structurally related to the OmpA protein of E. coli.
