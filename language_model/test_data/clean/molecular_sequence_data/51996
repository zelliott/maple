We have detected a polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of the AML1 gene, which is located at the breakpoint on chromosome 21 in the t(8;21)(q22;q22.3) translocation often associated with patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Informative CEPH families were genotyped for this polymorphism and used to localize the gene on the linkage map of human chromosome 21. The AML1 gene is located between the markers D21S216 and D21S211, in chromosomal band 21q22.3.
