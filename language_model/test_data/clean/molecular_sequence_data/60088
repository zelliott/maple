A description is given of Pichia lachancei sp. nov., a new species of yeast that occurs in association with several Hawaiian plant species of the genera Tetraplasandra, Cheirodendron and Clermontia. The new species is heterothallic and occurs in nature in the haploid as well as the diploid state. Upon conjugation of complementary mating types, zygotes are formed that reproduce by budding as diploid cells. When placed on sporulation medium, four hat-shaped spores are produced which are rapidly released from the ascus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that P. lachancei is most closely related to Pichia rhodanensis and Pichia jadinii. The diploid type strain of P. lachancei, isolated from rotting bark of Tetraplasandra hawaiiensis on the island of Hawaii, is strain UCD-FST 79-9T (= ATCC 201914T = CBS 8557T = NRRL Y-27008T).
