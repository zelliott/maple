The crystal structure of the bacterial K(+) channel, KcsA (Doyle, D. A., Morais, C. J., Pfuetzner, R. A., Kuo, A., Gulbis, J. M., Cohen, S. L., Chait, B. T., and MacKinnon, R. (1998) Science 280, 69-77), and subsequent mutagenesis have revealed a high structural conservation from bacteria to human (MacKinnon, R., Cohen, S. L., Kuo, A., Lee, A., and Chait, B. T. (1998) Science 280, 106-109). We have explored this conservation by swapping subregions of the M1-M2 linker of KcsA with those of the S5-S6 linker of the human Kv-channel Kv1.3. The chimeric K(+) channel constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli, and their multimeric state was analyzed after purification. We used two scorpion toxins, kaliotoxin and hongotoxin 1, which bind specifically to Kv1.3, to analyze the pharmacological properties of the KcsA-Kv1.3 chimeras. The results demonstrate that the high affinity scorpion toxin receptor of Kv1.3 could be transferred to KcsA. Our biochemical studies with purified KcsA-Kv1.3 chimeras provide direct chemical evidence that a tetrameric channel structure is necessary for forming a functional scorpion toxin receptor. We have obtained KcsA-Kv1.3 chimeras with kaliotoxin affinities (IC(50) values of approximately 4 pm) like native Kv1.3 channels. Furthermore, we show that a subregion of the S5-S6 linker may be an important determinant of the pharmacological profile of K(+) channels. Using available structural information on KcsA and kaliotoxin, we have developed a structural model for the complex between KcsA-Kv1.3 chimeras and kaliotoxin to aid future pharmacological studies of K(+) channels.
