The allele frequencies of a tetranucleotide repeat in intron 6 of the lipoprotein lipase gene (humLPL) were analyzed in 95 people from Novosibirsk. Genotype frequencies were shown to conform to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The allele frequency distribution of the tested hypervariable loci in the Novosibirsk population did not differ significantly from that in the Austrian population.
