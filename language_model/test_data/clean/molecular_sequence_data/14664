GPR120 is a long-chain fatty acid receptor that stimulates incretin hormone release from colonic endocrine cells and is implicated in macrophage and adipocyte function. The functional consequences of long (L) and short (S) human GPR120 splice variants, which differ by insertion of 16 amino acids in the third intracellular loop, are currently unknown. Here we compare signaling and intracellular trafficking of GPR120S and GPR120L receptors, using calcium mobilization and dynamic mass redistribution (DMR) assays, together with quantitative imaging measurements of β-arrestin2 association and receptor internalization. FLAG- or SNAP-tagged GPR120S receptors elicited both intracellular calcium mobilization and DMR responses in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, when stimulated with oleic acid, myristic acid, or the agonist 4-[[(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl]amino]benzenepropanoic acid (GW9508). Responses were insensitive to pertussis toxin, but increases in intracellular calcium were attenuated by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, an inhibitor of store inositol trisphosphate receptors. Despite equivalent cell surface expression of SNAP-tagged GPR120L receptors, no specific calcium or DMR responses were observed in cells transfected with this isoform. However, agonist-stimulated GPR120S and GPR120L receptors both recruited β-arrestin2 and underwent robust internalization, with similar agonist potencies in each case. After oleic acid-induced internalization, neither GPR120 isoform recycled rapidly to the cell surface. In both cases, confocal microscopy indicated receptor targeting to lysosomal compartments. Thus, the third intracellular loop insertion in GPR120L prevents G protein-dependent intracellular calcium and DMR responses, but this receptor isoform remains functionally coupled to the β-arrestin pathway, providing one of the first examples of a native β-arrestin-biased receptor.
