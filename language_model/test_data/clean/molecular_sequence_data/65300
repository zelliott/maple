A Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped, Hydrogenophaga-like bacterial strain, K102(T), was isolated from wastewater collected from a textile dye works in Korea and subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. Strain K102(T) grew optimally at pH 7.0-8.0 and 30-37 degrees C in the presence of 0.5 % (w/v) NaCl. It contained Q-8 as the predominant ubiquinone and C(16 : 0), C(16 : 1)omega7c and/or iso-C(15 : 0) 2-OH and C(18 : 1)omega7c as the major fatty acids. The DNA G+C content was 64.8 mol%. A neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain K102(T) fell within the radiation of the cluster comprising species of the genus Hydrogenophaga. Strain K102(T) exhibited 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values of 95.9-98.9 % to the type strains of recognized Hydrogenophaga species. Levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain K102(T) and the type strains of its four phylogenetically most closely related species, together with differential phenotypic properties, revealed that strain K102(T) could be distinguished from all recognized species of the genus Hydrogenophaga. On the basis of phenotypic, phylogenetic and genetic data, strain K102(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Hydrogenophaga, for which the name Hydrogenophaga bisanensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is K102(T) (=KCTC 12980(T) =CCUG 54518(T)).
