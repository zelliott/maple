cDNA clones encoding stage-and/or space-specific genes in porcine ovarian follicles have been investigated by differential screening of cDNA libraries of granulosa cells and corpus luteum. A clone corresponding to mRNA preferentially expressed in the functional stage of corpus luteum was found to encode a protein similar to the human prostatic secretory protein, PSP94, which had been originally identified in male genital organs. The expression was detected widely in the functional corpora lutea by in situ hybridization histochemistry, but the signal was most prominent in the luteal cells surrounding blood vessels. In contrast, despite the structural similarity in their products, the expression of this newly identified gene was not detected in porcine prostate, suggesting that these structurally related proteins play different roles in mammalian genital organs.
