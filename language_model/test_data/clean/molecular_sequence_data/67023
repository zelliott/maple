Trinucleotide repeats are involved in a number of debilitating diseases such as fragile-X syndrome and myotonic dystrophy. Eighteen to 75 base-long (CCG)(n) and (CGG)(n) oligodeoxynucleotides were analysed using a combination of biophysical (UV-absorbance, differential scanning calorimetry) and biochemical methods (non-denaturing gel electrophoresis, enzymatic footprinting). All oligomers formed stable intramolecular structures under near physiological conditions with a melting temperature which was only weakly dependent on oligomer length. Thermodynamic analysis of the denaturation process by UV-melting and calorimetric experiments revealed a length-dependent discrepancy between the enthalpy values deduced from model-dependent (UV-melting) and model-independent experiments (calorimetry), as recently shown for CTG and CAG trinucleotides (Nucleic Acids Res. 33 (2005) 4065). Evidence for non-zero molar heat capacity changes was also derived from the analysis of the Arrhenius plots. Such behaviour is analysed in the framework of an intramolecular "branched" or "broken" hairpin model, in which long oligomers do not fold into a simple long hairpin-stem intramolecular structure, but allow the formation of several independent folding units of unequal stability. These results suggest that this observation may be extended to various trinucleotide repeats-containing sequences.
