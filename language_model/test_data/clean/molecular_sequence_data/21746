A novel 6.6 kDa antifungal peptide (NFAP) from the culture supernatant of the mold, Neosartorya fischeri (anamorf: Aspergillus fischerianus), and its encoding gene were isolated in this study. NFAP is a small, basic and cysteine-rich protein consisting of 57 amino acid residues. It shows 37.9-50% homology to similar proteins described in literature from Aspergillus clavatus, Aspergillus giganteus, Aspergillus niger, and Penicillium chrysogenum. The in silico presumed tertiary structure of NFAP, e.g. the presence of five antiparallel Î²-sheet connected with filaments, and stabilized by three disulfide bridges, is very similar to those of the defensin-like molecules. NFAP exhibited growth inhibitory action against filamentous fungi in a dose-dependent manner, and maintained high antifungal activity within broad pH and temperature ranges. Furthermore, it exhibited relevant resistance to proteolysis. All these characteristics make NFAP a promising candidate for further in vitro and in vivo investigations aiming at the development of new antifungal compounds.
