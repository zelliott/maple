The development of a preventive vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) provides hope for control of the pandemic over the coming years. Nevertheless, it is clear that one of the greatest difficulties in achieving this vaccine is the high mutation rate of the virus, which enables it to evade the host's immune response. The production of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against the HIV-1 envelope proteins is believed to play an important role in controlling the infection and in providing effective protection following vaccination. Several studies have shown that the V1/V2 domain of the HIV-1 gp120 envelope protein is involved in viral tropism during infection, in masking conserved neutralizing epitopes, in the conformational changes occurring after coreceptor binding, and in NAb induction. Nonetheless, this domain has been poorly investigated. However, because the V1/V2 domain is highly glycosylated, numerous studies have determined the influence of carbohydrates on NAb production. The present review focuses on the importance of NAb directed against epitopes of the variable regions, mainly V1/V2, their importance in protecting against HIV-1 infection, and the role these regions play in evading the immune response. Lastly, we will discuss the importance of NAb in the search for an effective vaccine against HIV-1.
