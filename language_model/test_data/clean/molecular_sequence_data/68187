The genetic alterations that underlie prostate tumorigenesis are assumed to comprise gain or loss of specific chromosomal regions, whole chromosomes, or sequence-specific mutations. Existing data have not demonstrated clear specificity of whole chromosome or regional chromosomal gain or loss that characterizes entire individual malignant lesions, or all malignant lesions, within a cancerous prostate. We have analyzed tissues from 13 patients for target sequences by using PCR and FISH techniques on paired malignant or prostatic intraepithelial neoplastic (PIN) and benign samples (usually from different areas of the same paraffin section). We exercised stringent histologic control over these samples by examining small (< 5 mm2), discrete regions of sectioned benign, malignant, and PIN tissue. The same histologic region was examined on serial sections by FISH and PCR analysis. The tissues were examined for numerical aberrations involving chromosomes 4 (as a control), 7, 8, 10, and the Y by FISH analysis, and for gain or loss of chromosome 7 and chromosomal arms 8p, 10q, and Yp by PCR analysis. The concurrent application of PCR and FISH to microdissected prostatic tissues yielded evidence of higher frequencies of genetic aberration in prostate cancers than those found with either method alone or by other approaches. These results indicate the power of simultaneous genetic assays that are closely linked to specific tumor histology.
