All polyprenyl synthases catalyze the condensation of the allylic substrate, isopentenyl diphosphate, with a specific homoallylic diphosphate substrate. Polyprenyl synthases from Homo sapiens, Ratus rattus, Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Neurospora crassa, and Erwinia herbicola contain two conserved "aspartate-rich domains" (Ashby, M.N., and Edwards, P.A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 4128-4136). In order to determine the importance of these domains in catalysis, the conserved aspartates or arginines in domains I and II of rat farnesyl diphosphate synthase were individually mutated to glutamate or lysine, respectively. The putative "active site" arginine (Brems, D.N., Breunger, E., and Rilling, H. C. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 3711-3718) was mutated to lysine. Each mutant enzyme was overexpressed in E. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. Detailed kinetic analyses of the wild type and mutant enzymes indicated that mutagenesis of Asp104, Asp107, Arg112, Arg113, and Asp243 resulted in a decreased Vmax of approximately 1000-fold compared to wild type. However, no significant change in the Km values for either the isopentenyl diphosphate or geranyl diphosphate substrate were observed. The results strongly suggest that these amino acids, and to a lesser extent Asp244, are involved in either the condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate and geranyl diphosphate to form farnesyl diphosphate and/or the release of the farnesyl diphosphate product from farnesyl diphosphate synthase. The conservation of these amino acid residues in different enzymes from several species suggests that these domains play a similar role in other polyprenyl synthases.
