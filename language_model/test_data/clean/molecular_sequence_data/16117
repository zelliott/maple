The structures of two cloned recombinants of bacteriophage lambda and mouse genomic DNA (lambda mA14 and lambda mA36) were compared by electron microscopic analysis of various heteroduplex DNAs, restriction endonuclease mapping and nucleotide sequence determination. Each clone was shown to be derived from a distinct region of the mouse genome, but the two exhibited structural similarity over a region of at least 11,000 bases which included a cytoskeletal gamma-actin processed pseudogene of approximately 1800 bases. It is concluded that the two genomic regions were derived from a common ancestral region by duplication or amplification. The homologous regions of the two clones contained members of the long interspersed repetitive L1Md (long interspersed repeated sequence 1 of Mus domesticus) family lying in opposite orientation to one another, so that single-stranded DNA from the clones could form intra-molecular heteroduplexes. The complete nucleotide sequences of three L1Md members in lambda mA14 were determined. The longest of these (L1Md-14LH) had inserted into the gamma-actin processed pseudogene and, although it contained internal deletions, appeared to possess intact 5' and 3' ends. A second L1Md member (L1Md-14RH1) also appeared to have an intact 5' end but had lost most of its 3' portion, and a third member (L1Md-14RH2) was an internal fragment. The repeated sequence at the 5' ends of L1Md-14LH and L1Md-14RH1 showed these to be members of the L1Md-A family.
