The structure of the O-antigen polysaccharide of Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae serotype 3 (ATCC 27090) S-type lipopolysaccharide was investigated by methylation analysis, partial hydrolysis, periodate oxidation, and 1H- and 13C-n.m.r. spectroscopy, and concluded to be composed of linear pentasaccharide repeating-units having the structure: [----3)-alpha-D-Glcp-(1----2)-beta-D-Galf-(1----6)-alpha-D-Galp-(1 ----6)- beta-D-Glcp-(1----3)-beta-D-Galf-(1----]n.
