The N-terminal region of the Streptomyces K15 DD-peptidase/penicillin-binding protein shows high homology with that of other penicillin-interactive proteins or domains. The active-site serine residue of the conserved tetrad Ser-Xaa-Xaa-Lys occurs at position 35. There is no indication for the presence of a signal peptide or an N-terminal hydrophobic sequence, suggesting that the Streptomyces K15 enzyme is probably anchored to the membrane by a C-terminal peptide segment.
