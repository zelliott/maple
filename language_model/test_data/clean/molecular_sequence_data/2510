The cloned DNA fragment of the cytochrome P-450b/e gene containing the upstream region from position -179 through part of the first exon is faithfully transcribed in freeze-thawed rat liver nuclei. Phenobarbitone treatment of the animal strikingly increases this transcription, and the increase is blocked by cycloheximide (protein synthesis inhibitor) or CoCl2 (heme biosynthetic inhibitor) treatment of animals. This picture correlates very well with the reported cytochrome P-450b/e mRNA levels in vivo and run-on transcription rates in vitro under these conditions. The upstream region (from position -179) was assessed for protein binding with nuclear extracts by nitrocellulose filter binding, gel retardation, DNase I treatment ("footprinting"), and Western blot analysis. Phenobarbitone treatment dramatically increases protein binding to the upstream region, an increase once again blocked by cycloheximide or CoCl2 treatments. Addition of heme in vitro to heme-deficient nuclei and nuclear extracts restores the induced levels of transcription and protein binding to the upstream fragment, respectively. Thus, drug-mediated synthesis and heme-modulated binding of a transcription factor(s) appear involved in the transcriptional activation of the cytochrome P-450b/e genes, and an 85-kDa protein may be a major factor in this regard.
