The UL36 open reading frame encoding the tegument protein ICP1/2 represents the largest open reading frame in the genome of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Polypeptides homologous to the HSV-1 UL36 protein are present in all subfamilies of HERPESVIRIDAE: We sequenced the UL36 gene of the alphaherpesvirus pseudorabies virus (PrV) and prepared a monospecific polyclonal rabbit antiserum against a bacterial glutathione S-transferase (GST)-UL36 fusion protein for identification of the protein. The antiserum detected a >300-kDa protein in PrV-infected cells and in purified virions. Interestingly, in coprecipitation analyses using radiolabeled infected-cell extracts, the anti-UL36 serum reproducibly coprecipitated the UL37 tegument protein, and antiserum directed against the UL37 protein coprecipitated the UL36 protein. This physical interaction could be verified using yeast two-hybrid analysis which demonstrated that the UL37 protein interacts with a defined region within the amino-terminal part of the UL36 protein. By use of immunogold labeling, capsids which accumulate in the cytoplasm in the absence of the UL37 protein (B. G. Klupp, H. Granzow, E. Mundt, and T. C. Mettenleiter, J. Virol. 75:8927-8936, 2001) as well as wild-type intracytoplasmic and extracellular virions were decorated by the anti-UL36 antiserum, whereas perinuclear primary enveloped virions were not. We postulate that the physical interaction of the UL36 protein, which presumably constitutes the innermost layer of the tegument (Z. Zhou, D. Chen, J. Jakana, F. J. Rixon, and W. Chiu, J. Virol. 73:3210-3218, 1999), with the UL37 protein is an important early step in tegumentation during virion morphogenesis in the cytoplasm.
