Mono- and polydeterminant synthetic antigens have been prepared via copolymerisation of acrylamide with allyl-, 2-acrylamidoethyl, and p-acrylamidophenyl glycosides of di- and trisaccharides representative of the group-specific Salmonella O-antigenic determinants (0:2, 0:3, 0:4, and 0:9). Serological specificity of the glycoconjugates obtained has been studied in enzyme immunoassay (EIA) using monoreceptor antisera.
