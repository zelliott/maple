Antisense oligonucleotides represent an interesting tool for selective inhibition of gene expression. In order to direct oligonucleotides to specific compartments within the cell, we have investigated the possibility of coupling them to a signal peptide Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL). This sequence should be able to convey oligonucleotides to the endoplasmic reticulum and from there to the cytosol and the nucleus where their targets are located. On this basis we prepared peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates by coupling, in a single step, a Nalpha-bromoacetyl peptide with an oligonucleotide bearing a thiol group, through a thioether bond. This paper deals with the definition of the optimal pH and temperature conditions leading to an efficient synthesis of peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates: the reaction was quantitative at pH 7.5 within few hours. This method was first set up using a 5',3'-modified dodecanucleotide and a (bromoacetyl)pentapeptide as a conjugation model. Then a 5',3'-modified pentacosanucleotide, complementary to the translation initiation region of the gag mRNA of HIV, was coupled to a (bromoacetyl)dodecapeptide containing a KDEL signal sequence. The anti-HIV activity of the pentacosanucleotide was compared with that of pentacosanucleotide-dodecapeptide conjugates linked through either a thioether bond or a disulfide bridge. The conjugate with a thioether bond has a higher antiviral activity than the peptide-free oligonucleotide and the conjugate linked via a disulfide bond.
