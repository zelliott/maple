A 17-membered peptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence of (143-159) site of protein VP1 of A12 foot-and-mouth disease virus has been obtained by mixed anhydride method condensations of the earlier synthesized fragments. A norleucine residue has been attached, as a label, to the ends of peptides obtained. The complete deprotection was performed by hydrogenation peptides' hydrochlorides and the products were purified by HPLC. The antigenic properties of the synthesized peptides are discussed.
