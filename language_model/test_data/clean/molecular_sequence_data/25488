The plasmid-located gene caf1 encoding the capsular antigen fraction 1 (F1) of Yersinia pestis was cloned and sequenced. The gene codes for a 170 amino acid peptide with a deduced Mr of 17.6 kDa. The signal peptide sequence was highly homologous to the E. coli consensus signal sequence. The F1 was assumed to have beta-sheet structure for the most part. The region located between amino acids 100 and 150 was suggested to contain putative antigenic determinants and to stimulate T cells.
