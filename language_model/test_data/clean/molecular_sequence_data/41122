I-motif formation has been confirmed in a number of gene promoter sequences known to form G-quadruplex structures. I-motif formation can occur close to physiological temperature and pH for h-tert and PDGF-A. The i-motif structure formed by a HIF-1Î± promoter sequence shows unexpected stability near neutral pH.
