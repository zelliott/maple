Human rRNA precursor from normal or stressed HeLa cells were studied by S1 nuclease mapping of unlabeled RNA and by antisense RNase mapping of RNA from cells that had been labeled in vivo with [32P]PO4. Heating cells to 43 degrees C decreased the amount of newly synthesized rRNA to less than 5% of the control level and led to greater than 95% inhibition of transcription termination at a region 355 to 362 nucleotides downstream of the 3' end of 28S rRNA, with readthrough continuing into the next transcription unit. Heating of cells to 42 degrees C led to 60% inhibition of termination at this site; 50% of transcripts that extended into the nontranscribed spacer ended in a region 200 to 210 nucleotides upstream of the polymerase I (Pol I) initiation site. This is presumed to be the human upstream transcription termination site because of the absence of RNAs with a 5' end corresponding to this region, the location relative to the Pol I initiation site (which is similar to the location of upstream terminators in other species), and the fact that it is 15 to 25 nucleotides upstream of the sequence GGGTTGACC, which has an 8-of-9 base identity with the sequence 3' of the downstream termination site. Surprisingly, treatment of cells with sodium arsenite, which also leads to the induction of a stress response, did not inhibit termination. Pol I initiation was decreased to the same extent as termination, which lends support to the hypothesis that termination and initiation are coupled. Although termination was almost completely inhibited at 43 degrees C, the majority of the recently synthesized rRNAs were processed to have the correct 3' end of 28S. This finding suggests that 3'-end formation can involve an endonucleolytic cut and is not solely dependent on exonucleolytic trimming of correctly terminated rRNAs.
