The prevalence of serum GB virus C (GBV-C)/Hepatitis G virus (HGV) RNA and anti-E2 was investigated in Japanese children younger than 16 years of age without a history of blood transfusion and the family members of serum GBV-C/HGV RNA-positive children. The prevalences of serum GBV-C/HGV RNA and anti-E2 were 0.5% (5/1000) and 0% (0/330), respectively. Viral RNA was also detected in the mothers of all five GBV-C/HGV RNA-positive children and in two of their siblings. Sequence determinations indicated the likelihood of mother-to-infant transmission in all cases. The presence of the virus persisted for at least 10-18 months in all 5 children, without any appearance of anti-E2.
