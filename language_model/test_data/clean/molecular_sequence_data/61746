The glyoxysomal beta-oxidation system in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) cotyledons is distinguished by the coexistence of two different thiolase isoforms, thiolase I and II. So far, this phenomenon has only been described for glyoxysomes from sunflower cotyledons. Thiolase I (acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, EC 2.3.1.9) recognizes acetoacetyl-CoA only, while thiolase II (3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase, EC 2.3.1.16) exhibits a more broad substrate specificity towards 3-oxoacyl-CoA esters of different chain length. Here, we report on the cloning of thiolase II from sunflower cotyledons. The known DNA sequence of Cucumis sativus 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase was used to generate primers for cloning the corresponding thiolase from sunflower cotyledons. RT-PCR was then used to generate an internal fragment of the sunflower thiolase gene and the termini were isolated using 5'- and 3'-RACE. Full-length cDNA was generated using RT-PCR with sunflower thiolase-specific primers flanking the coding region. The resultant gene encodes a thiolase sharing at least 80% identity with other plant thiolases at the amino acid level. The recombinant sunflower thiolase II was expressed in a bacterial system in an active form and purified to apparent homogeneity in a single step using Ni-NTA agarose chromatography. The enzyme was purified 53.4-fold and had a specific activity of 235 nkat/mg protein. Pooled fractions from the Ni-NTA column resulted in an 83% yield of active enzyme to be used for further characterization.
