Transcription arrest plays a role in regulating the expression of a number of genes, including the murine adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene. We have previously identified two prominent arrest sites at the 5' end of the ADA gene: one in the first exon and one in the first intron (J. W. Innis and R. E. Kellems, Mol. Cell. Biol. 11:5398-5409, 1991). Here we report the functional characterization of the intron 1 arrest site, located 137 to 145 nucleotides downstream of the cap site. We have determined, using gel filtration, that the intron 1 arrest site is a stable RNA polymerase II pause site and that the transcription elongation factor SII promotes read-through at this site. Additionally, the sequence determinants for the pause are located within a 37-bp fragment encompassing this site (+123 to +158) and can direct transcription arrest in an orientation-dependent manner in the context of the ADA and adenovirus major late promoters. Specific point mutations in this region increase or decrease the relative pausing efficiency. We also show that the sequence determinants for transcription arrest can function when placed an additional 104 bp downstream of their natural position.
