Chemokines mediate their chemotactic, proinflammatory effects by binding to and activating a variety of specific receptors belonging to the G protein-coupled superfamily of seven-transmembrane serpentine receptors. We report the cloning, chromosomal localization, expression, and ligand binding of a novel CC chemokine receptor, CCR10. CCR10 is expressed primarily in placenta and fetal liver, and binds two of the CC chemokines, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and MCP-3, with highest affinity. The KD for MCP-3 binding was 1 nM, and MCP-1 competed for MCP-3 binding with an IC50 of 1.2 nM. The CC chemokines MCP-4 and RANTES competed for MCP-3 binding with IC50 values of 7.5 and 5.4 nM, respectively. The chromosomal location of CCR10 was determined to coincide with the CC chemokine receptor cluster on chromosome 3 (3p21.31-3p21.32). These results indicate that CCR10 is a novel CC chemokine receptor with a unique expression pattern that would be consistent with a role in placental immunity or hematopoiesis.
