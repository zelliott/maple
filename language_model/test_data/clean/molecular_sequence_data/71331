Mediated by the protein IIAGlc, the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system plays a role in the regulation of activity of other sugar transport systems in Escherichia coli. By using a direct binding assay, a collection of single-Cys replacement mutants in cytoplasmic loops of lactose permease were evaluated for their capacity to bind IIAGlc. Selected Cys replacements in loops IV/V or VI/VII result in loss of binding activity. Analysis of the mutagenesis results together with multiple sequence alignments of a family of proteins that interacts with IIAGlc provides the basis for developing two regions of consensus sequence in those partner proteins necessary for binding to IIAGlc. The requirement for two interaction regions is interpreted in the regulatory framework of a substrate-dependent conformational change that brings those two regions into an orientation optimal for binding IIAGlc.
