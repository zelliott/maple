An unknown Trypanosoma species was isolated from an axenic culture of intact skin from a domestic dog captured in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which was co-infected with Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis. Giemsa-stained smears of cultures grown in different media revealed the presence of epimastigotes, trypomastigotes, spheromastigotes, transitional stages, and dividing forms (epimastigotes or spheromastigotes). The highest frequency of trypomastigotes was observed in RPMI (15.2%) and DMEM (9.2%) media containing 5% FCS, with a mean length of these forms of 43.0 and 36.0 mum, respectively. Molecular analysis by sequential application of PCR assays indicated that this trypanosome differs from Trypanosoma cruzi and T. rangeli when specific primers were applied. On the other hand, a PCR strategy targeted to the D7 domain of 24salpha rDNA, using primers D75/D76, amplified products of about 250 bp in that isolate (stock A-27), different from the amplification products obtained with T. cruzi and T. rangeli. This organism differs from T. cruzi mainly by the size of its trypomastigote forms and kinetoplasts and the absence of infectivity for macrophages and triatomine bugs. It is also morphologically distinct from salivarian trypanosomes reported in Brazil. Isoenzyme analysis at 8 loci demonstrated a very peculiar banding pattern clearly distinct from those of T. rangeli and T. cruzi. We conclude that this isolate is a new Trypanosoma species. The name T. caninum is suggested.
