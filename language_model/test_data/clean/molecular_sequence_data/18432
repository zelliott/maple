We have determined the complete sequence of the galactose promoter as well as the amino terminal part of the epimerase gene from Escherichia coli and localized the regulatory elements of the galactose promoter. In this way the sequence of pKG1800, a vector constructed for detection of transcription terminator is now completed.
