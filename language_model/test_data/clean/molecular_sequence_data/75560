A plasmid expressing the cloned bacteriophage T4 gene 42 gave the same levels of complementation of gene 42 mutants in a polarity-suppressing rho mutant as in a rho+ host. A reading frame likely corresponding to gene 42 and putative promoter and terminator sequences were identified in the partial sequence of the cloned fragment.
