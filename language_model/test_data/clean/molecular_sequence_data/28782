We have identified a novel human gene UNC93B1 encoding a protein related to unc-93 of Caenorhabditis elegans. The combined sequence derived from several cDNA clones is 2282 bp and comparison with genomic sequence shows that the gene contains 11 exons. The longest open reading frame encodes a deduced sequence of 597 amino acids. Homology analysis shows that the hUNC93B1 gene is highly conserved and related to sequences in Arabidopsis thaliana, C. elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, chicken and mouse. Structural analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of hUNC93B1 points to possible existence of multiple membrane-spanning domains. hUNC93B1 protein also displays some similarities to the bacterial ABC-2 type transporter signature and to ion transporters of Deinococcus radiodurans and Helicobacter pylori. As revealed by Northern analysis, the level of expression varies significantly between tissues, with the highest level detected in the heart. The gene was mapped to chromosomal band 11q13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. We suggest that this gene is a member of a novel hUNC93B-related gene family.
