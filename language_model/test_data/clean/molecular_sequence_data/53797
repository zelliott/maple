Eosinophil peroxidase (EPX) is one of a family of mammalian peroxidases that includes myeloperoxidase (MPO), lactoperoxidase (LPO), and thyroid peroxidase (TPO). Here we show that the human EPX gene maps to chromosome 17q23.1, which localizes 34 kb from the LPO and MPO genes. Our results demonstrate that the EPX, LPO, and MPO genes form a cluster on human chromosome 17.
