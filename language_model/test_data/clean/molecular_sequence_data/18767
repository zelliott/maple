A novel Gram-negative, yellow-pigmented, aerobic, motile by gliding, rod-shaped marine bacterium (JLT2011(T)) was isolated from surface seawater. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain JLT2011(T) could be assigned to the genus Gramella and was most closely related to Gramella gaetbulicola, with 96.2 % similarity. The genomic DNA G+C content was 42.1 %. The predominant fatty acids were C16 : 0, iso-C15 : 0, C18 : 0 and summed feature 3 (C16 : 1ω6c/C16 : 1ω7c). The major menaquinone was MK-6. The major components of the polar lipid profile were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and sphingoglycolipid. On the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and taxonomic data presented, strain JLT2011(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Gramella, for which the name Gramella flava sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is JLT2011(T) ( = CGMCC 1.12375(T) = LMG 27360(T)).
