During most clinically relevant infections with cytopathic viruses, neutralizing antibodies are generated early, i.e., within the first week of infection. As early as 4 days after immunization of mice with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a cytopathic virus closely related to rabies virus, hybridomas could be isolated that secreted virus-neutralizing IgGs. Such antibodies were devoid of somatic mutations, showed high binding avidities (approximately 10(9) M-1), and used V gene fragments predominantly belonging to the VHQ52 and VK19-28 families. In contrast, most secondary and hyperimmune response IgGs isolated 12 and 150 days after infection used several additional V gene combinations. These, which used the VHQ52/VK19-28 combination of early IgGs, were point mutated but showed only marginally enhanced binding avidities. Since all VHQ52/ VK19-28-positive IgGs bound to one subsite within the major antigenic site of VSV-G irrespective of the presence or absence of somatic point mutations, fine specificity diversification of secondary and hyperimmune responses was achieved by newly appearing V gene combinations.
