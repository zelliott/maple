The StyLT1 restriction-modification (R-M) system of Salmonella typhimurium has recently been suggested to belong to the type-III R-M systems [De Backer and Colson, Gene 97 (1991) 103-107]. The nucleotide sequences of StyLT1 mod and res have been determined. Two closely adjacent open reading frames were found 12 bp apart with coding capacities of 651 (Mod) and 982 (Res) amino acids (aa), respectively. The genes, lying in the same direction of transcription in the mod-res order, are transcribed as distinct units. The deduced aa sequences reveal homologies with known type-III enzymes from the Escherichia coli P1 prophage, E. coli P15 plasmid and Bacillus cereus chromosome. In addition, the StyLT1 restriction endonuclease (ENase), like other type-I and type-III ENases, contains sequence motifs characteristic of superfamily-II helicases, which may be involved in DNA unwinding at the cleavage site.
