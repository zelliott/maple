Many natural alpha-helical amphiphilic peptides are known to have lytic activity toward different cells. Herein, we describe the synthesis and the characterization of synthetic alpha-helical amphiphilic peptide nanostructures containing crown ethers, as well as the modulation of their cytolytic activity by adding different acidic dipeptide chains at the N- or C-terminus.
