From the fruits of Kochia scoparia (L.) Schrad, five triterpenoid glycosides were isolated for the first time from this plant. They were elucidated as momordin Ic, the 6'-methyl ester of momordin Ic, momordin IIc, 2'-O-beta-D-glucopyranosylmomordin Ic, and 2'-O-beta-D-glucopyranosylmomordin IIc on the basis of spectral and chemical methods. The last two saponins are new natural products.
