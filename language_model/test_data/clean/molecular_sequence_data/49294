The new flavonoid glycoside kaempferol-3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1-->2)-O-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1-->6)]-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside-7-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside was isolated together with (S)-zierin from the leaves of Zollernia ilicifolia (Fabaceae), a medicinal plant used as analgesic and antiulcerogenic effects in Brazilian Tropical Atlantic Rain Forest. The structures were established on the basis of 1H, 13C NMR and 2D NMR (COSY, HMBC, HMQC), UV, MS and IV spectra. The infusion of Zollernia ilicifolia was qualitatively compared to the infusion of the espinheiras-santas (Maytenus aquifolium and Maytenus ilicifolia) by HPLC-DAD.
