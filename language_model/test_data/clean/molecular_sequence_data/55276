Cys2His2 (C2H2)-type zinc fingers are widespread DNA binding motifs in eukaryotic transcription factors. Zinc fingers are short protein motifs composed of two or three β-layers and one α-helix. Two cysteine and two histidine residues located in certain positions bind zinc to stabilize the structure. Four other amino acid residues localized in specific positions in the N-terminal region of the α-helix participate in DNA binding by interacting with hydrogen donors and acceptors exposed in the DNA major groove. The number of zinc fingers in a single protein can vary over a wide range, thus enabling variability of target DNA sequences. Besides DNA binding, zinc fingers can also provide protein-protein and RNA-protein interactions. For the most part, proteins containing the C2H2-type zinc fingers are trans regulators of gene expression that play an important role in cellular processes such as development, differentiation, and suppression of malignant cell transformation (oncosuppression).
