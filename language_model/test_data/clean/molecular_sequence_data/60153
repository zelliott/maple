The organisation of the E1alpha subunit of bovine branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase gene was established. c DNA was cloned from Poll Shorthorn x Poll Hereford calves affected with Maple Syrup Urine Disease to identify the mutation responsible for the disease in Poll Shorthorns. Clones containing the c DNA sequences inherited from the Poll Shorthorn sire of the affected calves were identified. Paternal clones were sequenced and a cytidine to thymidine transition was found at nucleotide 1380. The mutation is predicted to substitute leucine in place of a highly conserved proline at codon 372. A polymerase chain reaction procedure was developed for detection of the 1380C-->T mutation in genomic DNA. Three Poll Shorthorn parents of affected calves and three affected Poll Shorthorn x Poll Hereford calves were heterozygous and an affected Poll Shorthorn calf was homozygous for this mutation. An improved polymerase chain reaction procedure was also devised to genotype Poll Herefords for the 248C-->T mutation. The procedures will facilitate disease prevention programs and assist in differential diagnosis of conditions in new-born calves that present with a rapid onset of progressive neurological disease and are characterised histologically by 'status spongiosus'. Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) is an autosomal recessive defect reported in humans (Danner and Elsas 1989), and in Poll Hereford (PH) and Poll Shorthorn (PS) calves (Harper et al 1986, Healy et al 1992). The clinical, biochemical and pathological manifestations of the disease are identical in the two breeds of cattle, and are characterised by the rapid onset of progressive neurological disease, leading to death within a few days of birth. The disease is caused by a deficiency of activity of the mitochondrial enzyme branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKADH). This deficiency leads to elevated concentrations, in blood and tissues, of branched chain alpha-keto acids and their precursors, the branched chain amino acids, valine, leucine and isoleucine. BCKADH consists of four subunits E1alpha, E1beta, E2 and E3 that are encoded by separate genes, and MSUD may result from deficiency of any of the subunits. In PH s, the disease in caused by premature termination of translation, of the E1alpha subunit, that is induced by a cytidine to thymidine transition exon 2 (248C-->T), that converts the glutamine codon -6 to a stop codon (Q-6ST; Zhang et al 1990). We have shown that MSUD -affected PSxPH calves are heterozygous at the PH locus, illustrating molecular heterogeneity exists for bovine MSUD (Healy and Dennis 1994a). The fact that these crossbred calves are affected, indicates the PS, like the PH mutation, resides in the E1alpha subunit.
