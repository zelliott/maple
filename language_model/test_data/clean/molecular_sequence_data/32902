The immunoglobulin M (IgM) heavy chain constant region genes of Russian sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii), Sterlte sturgeon (Acipenser ruthenus), Amur sturgeon (Acipenser schrenckii), Chinese sturgeon (Acipenser sinensis) and Great sturgeon (Huso huso) were cloned and analyzed with molecular biology and bioinformatics methods. We cloned IGH nucleic acid sequences by RT-PCR using the specific primer, then determined the characteristics and functions of the amino acid sequences. The gene contains four constant region domain-encoding exons (CH1-4), of which CH4 sub-regions were the most conserved in IgM heavy chain constant region domain and had the highest identity within all the experimental species. According to the analysis of the phylogenetic tree, the variation expectation value (K(aa)), and species differentiation time (T) in the CH4 sub-region, we found that Chinese sturgeon and the other five sturgeon form one whole bifurcation of the tree, while, among the five left, Amur sturgeon and Huso sturgeon, Russian sturgeon and Siberian sturgeon (data from GenBank), Sterlte itself forms three other bifurcations. This result can clearly explain the relations of taxonomic status, geographical distribution and evolution among the species studied.
