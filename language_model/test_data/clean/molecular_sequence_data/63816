The presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in 460 animals (439 cattle, 16 kids, and 5 sheep) of Tuv-aimak Mongolian district was investigated by IFT. Cryptosporidium oocysts were found in 116 (26.4%) cattle. Out of the 116 IFT positive samples, 47 were further purified by IMS, investigated by PCR and 11 were found positive. The species and/or genotypes were determined by nested PCR-RFLP and sequence analysis of a fragment of the SSU rRNA gene. The results indicated the presence of Cryptosporidium andersoni in the sequenced samples and C. bovis in two samples as a common infection. No Cryptosporidium oocysts were found in fecal specimens collected from sheep and goats. The present work reports the first data on Cryptosporidium species in animals from Mongolia. Further studies are necessary to understand the epidemiology and transmission of Cryptosporidium in domestic animals in Mongolia.
