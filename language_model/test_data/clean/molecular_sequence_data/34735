Peripheral blood lymphocytes from 13 donors were transformed with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to establish immortalized human B-cells secreting antibodies to Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) pollen allergens. EBV-transformed B-lymphocytes were then fused with mouse myeloma SP2/O3, and three clones of mouse-human hybridomas secreting human IgM class monoclonal antibodies to a cedar pollen allergen Cry j1 were established.
