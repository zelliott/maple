The genomic RNA from turnip yellow mosaic virus presents a 3'-end functionally and structurally related to tRNAs. This report summarizes our knowledge about the peculiar structure of the tRNA-like domain and its interaction with tRNA specific proteins, like RNAse P, tRNA nucleotidyl-transferase, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and elongation factors. It discusses also the biological role of this structure in the viral life cycle. A brief survey of our knowledge of other tRNA mimicries in biological systems, as well as their relevance for understanding canonical tRNA, will also be presented.
