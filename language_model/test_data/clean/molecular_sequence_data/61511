FNBP1/FBP17/Rapostlin and TRIP10/CIP4 are structurally related microtubule-binding proteins involved in the regulation of cell shape, polarity, motility, and signal transduction. Here, we identified and characterized the FNBP1-like (FNBP1L) gene by using bioinformatics. Human FLJ20275 (NM_017737.1) and mouse 2610318I01Rik (NM_153118.1) were 5'-truncated partial cDNAs derived from human FNBP1L gene and mouse Fnbp1l gene, respectively. Exons 1-7 of FNBP1L gene were located within human genome sequence AL512651.13, and exons 7-15 within AL109613.11. Complete coding sequence of FNBP1L was determined in silico by assembling nucleotide sequences of FNBP1L exons. FNBP1L (547 aa) showed 59.4 and 55.4% total-amino-acid identity with FNBP1 and TRIP10, respectively. FNBP1L, FNBP1 and TRIP10 shared the common domain structure, consisting of FCH, FBH, HR1 and SH3 domains. FCH domain of FNBP1 family proteins is the microtubule-binding domain. HR1 (also known as antiparallel coiled-coil finger) is the binding domain for Rho family proteins, such as ARHN/RhoN and CDC42. SH3 domain of FNBP1 family proteins interacts with proline-rich region of Formin and WASP family proteins. FNBP1L gene was linked to SH2D3B/BCAR3 gene in tail-to-tail manner with an interval less than 8 kb within the human genome. FNBP1L-SH2D3B locus at human chromosome 1p22.1 was paralogous to GPR108-TRIP10-SH2D3A locus at 19p13.3 and GPR107-FNBP1-SH2D3C locus at 9q34.11-q34.13. This is the first report on comprehensive characterization of FNBP1L, which is predicted to function as a scaffold protein for microtubule, Rho family proteins, Formin-homology proteins and WAPS family proteins.
