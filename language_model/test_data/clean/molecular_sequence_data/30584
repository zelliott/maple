Four analogs of the natural cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) were tested for their ability to bind and inhibit the prokaryotic enzyme, EcoRI adenine DNA methylase. The EcoRI methylase transfers the methyl group from AdoMet to the second adenine in the double-stranded DNA sequence 5'GAATTC3'. Dissociation constants (KD) of the binary methylase-analog complexes obtained in the absence of DNA with S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), sinefungin, N-methyl-AdoMet, and N-ethylAdoMet are 225, 43, greater than 1000, and greater than 1000 microM, respectively. In the presence of a DNA substrate, all four analogs show simple competitive inhibition with respect to AdoMet. The product of the enzymic reaction, AdoHcy, is a poor inhibitor of the enzyme (KI(AdoHcy) = 9 microM; KM(AdoMet) = 0.60 microM). Two synthetic analogs, N-methyl-AdoMet and N-ethyl-AdoMet, were also shown to be poor inhibitors with KI values of 50 and greater than 1000 microM, respectively. In contrast, the naturally occurring analog sinefungin was shown to be a highly potent inhibitor (KI = 10 nM). Gel retardation assays confirm that the methylase-DNA-sinefungin complex is sequence-specific. The ternary complex is the first sequence-specific complex detected for any DNA methylase. Potential applications to structural studies of methylase-DNA interactions are discussed.
