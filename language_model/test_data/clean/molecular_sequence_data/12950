The widely used antitumor drug cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin or cis-DDP) reacts with DNA, cross-linking two purine residues through the N7 atoms, which reside in the major groove in B-form DNA. The solution structure of the short duplex [d(CAT-AGCTATG)]2 cross-linked at the GC:GC site was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The deoxyguanosine-bridging cis-diammineplatinum(II) lies in the minor groove, and the complementary deoxycytidines are extrahelical. The double helix is locally reversed to a left-handed form, and the helix is unwound and bent toward the minor groove. These findings were independently confirmed by results from a phase-sensitive gel electrophoresis bending assay. The NMR structure differs markedly from previously proposed models but accounts for the chemical reactivity, the unwinding, and the bending of cis-DDP interstrand cross-linked DNA and may be important in the formation and repair of these cross-links in chromatin.
