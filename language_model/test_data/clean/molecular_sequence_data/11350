The complete nucleotide sequence of a 1,513 bp fragment of Mycobacterium bovis BCG containing the secY gene homolog and partial adk gene that encodes an adenylate kinase has been determined. The secY gene of BCG has an open reading frame of 441 amino acids with homology to the SecY protein family. Comparative analyses of the deduced amino acid sequence of additional partial ORF revealed strong similarity to the known adenylate kinases.
