The syntheses and analyses of GSSG analogues with modified ionizable groups are described. Using the mixed anhydride method, three symmetrical and three asymmetrical peptide analogues were obtained in moderate overall yields. The products were analyzed by HPLC, 1H-NMR, thin-layer electrophoresis, and amino acid analysis. They were used to study enzyme:ligand interactions in glutathione reductase.
