Incubating human cells in diethylmaleate (DEM) depletes the intracellular pool of reduced glutathione (GSH) and increases the concentration of oxidative free radicals. We found that DEM-induced oxidative stress reduced the ability of p53 to bind its consensus recognition sequence and to activate transcription of a p53-specific reporter gene. Nevertheless, DEM treatment induced expression of WAF1/CIP1 but not GADD45 mRNA. The fact that N-acetylcysteine, a precursor of GSH that blocks oxidative stress, prevented WAF1/CIP1 induction by DEM suggests that WAF1/CIP1 induction probably was a consequence of the ability of DEM to reduce intracellular GSH levels. DEM induced WAF1/CIP1 expression in Saos-2 and T98G cells, both of which lack functional p53 protein. DEM treatment did not produce an increase in membrane-associated protein kinase C, but ERK2, a mitogen-activated protein kinase, was phosphorylated in a manner consistent with ERK2 activation. DEM treatment also produced a dose-dependent delay in cell cycle progression, which at low concentrations (0.25 mM) consisted of a G2/M arrest and at higher concentrations (1 mM) also involved G1 and S phase delays. Our results indicate that oxidative stress induces WAF1/CIP1 expression and arrests cell cycle progression through a mechanism that is independent of p53. This mechanism may provide for cell cycle checkpoint control under conditions that inactivate p53.
