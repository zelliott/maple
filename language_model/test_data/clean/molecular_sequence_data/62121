The centrosome in animal cells provides a major microtubule-nucleating site that regulates the microtubule cytoskeleton temporally and spatially throughout the cell cycle. We report the identification in Drosophila melanogaster of a large coiled-coil centrosome protein that can bind to calmodulin. Biochemical studies reveal that this novel Drosophila centrosome protein, centrosome protein of 309 kDa (CP309), cofractionates with the gamma-tubulin ring complex and the centrosome-complementing activity. We show that CP309 is required for microtubule nucleation mediated by centrosomes and that it interacts with the gamma-tubulin small complex. These findings suggest that the microtubule-nucleating activity of the centrosome requires the function of CP309.
