To investigate whether the CD30 molecule, expressed only by a minority of T and B cells, defines a subtype of T helper cells, Pityrosporum orbiculare-specific CD4+ T cell clones were assessed for CD30 protein and gene expression. The clones were defined as Th1, Th0, and Th2 according to their cytokine mRNA profile detected by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The kinetics of CD30 expression after OKT3 (anti-CD3) stimulation was analyzed by flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, and RT-PCR. OKT3 activation induced a high expression of CD30 in cells of both Th1 and Th0 as well as Th2 type after 1-3 days. A difference between the clones was noted in that the Th2 clones remained highly positive in CD30 expression, whereas expression in the other clones started to decline from day 3. These data indicate that CD30 is expressed in activated CD4+ T cells of all three subtypes, and that the expression is sustained in Th2 cells.
