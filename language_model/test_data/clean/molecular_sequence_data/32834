Steroid hormones are a diverse class of structurally related molecules, derived from cholesterol, that include androgens, estrogens, progesterone and corticosteroids. They represent an important group of physiologically active signalling molecules that bind intracellular receptor proteins and regulate genes involved in developmental, reproductive and metabolic processes. The receptor proteins share structurally and functionally related ligand binding and DNA-binding domains, but possess distinct N-terminal domains (NTD) of unique length and amino acids sequence. The NTD contains sequences important for gene regulation, exhibit structure plasticity and are likely to contribute to the specificity of the steroid hormone/receptor response.
