The impact of inserting hydrocarbon staples into short α-helical antimicrobial peptides lasioglossin III and melectin (antimicrobial peptides of wild bee venom) on their biological and biophysical properties has been examined. The stapling was achieved by ring-closing olefin metathesis, either between two S-2-(4'-pentenyl) alanine residues (S (5)) incorporated at i and i + 4 positions or between R-2-(7'-octenyl) alanine (R (8)) and S (5) incorporated at the i and i + 7 positions, respectively. We prepared several lasioglossin III and melectin analogs with a single staple inserted into different positions within the peptide chains as well as analogs with double staples. The stapled peptides exhibited a remarkable increase in hemolytic activity, while their antimicrobial activities decreased. Some single stapled peptides showed a higher resistance against proteolytic degradation than native ones, while the double stapled analogs were substantially more resistant. The CD spectra of the singly stapled peptides measured in water showed only a slightly better propensity to form α-helical structure when compared to native peptides, whereas the doubly stapled analogs exhibited dramatically enhanced α-helicity.
