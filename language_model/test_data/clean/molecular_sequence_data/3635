HF2 is a haloarchaeal virus infecting two Halorubrum species (Family Halobacteriaceae). It is lytic, has a head-and-tail morphology and belongs to the Myoviridae (contractile tails). The linear double-stranded DNA genome was sequenced and found to be 77 670 bp in length, with a mol% G+C of 55.8. A total of 121 likely open reading frames (ORFs) were identified, of which 37 overlapped at start and stop codons. The predicted proteins were usually acidic (average pI of 4.8), and less than about 12% of them had homologues in the sequence databases. Four complete tRNA-like sequences (tRNA-Arg, -Asx, -Pro and -Tyr) and an incomplete tRNA-Thr were detected. A transcription map showed that most of the genome was transcribed and that the synthesis of transcripts occurred in a highly organized and reproducible pattern over a 5 h infection cycle. Transcripts often spanned multiple ORFs, suggesting that viral genes were organized into operons. The predicted ORF and observed transcript directions matched well and showed that transcription is mainly directed inwards from the genome termini, meeting at about 45-48 kb, and this was also a turning point in a cumulative GC-skew plot. The low point in cumulative GC-skew, near the left end, was a region rich in short repeats and lacking ORFs, which is likely to be an origin of replication. The HF2 genome is a mosaic of components from widely different sources, demonstrating clearly that viruses of haloarchaea, like their bacteriophage counterparts, are vectors for the exchange and transmission of genetic material between wide taxonomic distances, even across domains.
