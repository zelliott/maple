Pea microsomes contain an alpha-fucosyltransferase that incorporates fucose from GDP-fucose into xyloglucan, adding it preferentially to the 2-O-position of the galactosyl residue closest to the reducing end of the repeating subunit. This enzyme was solubilized with detergent and purified by affinity chromatography on GDP-hexanolamine-agarose followed by gel filtration. By utilizing peptide sequences obtained from the purified enzyme, a cDNA clone was isolated that encodes a 565-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 64 kDa and shows 62.3% identity to its Arabidopsis homolog. The purified transferase migrates at approximately 63 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis but elutes from the gel filtration column as an active protein of higher molecular weight ( approximately 250 kDa), indicating that the active form is an oligomer. The enzyme is specific for xyloglucan and is inhibited by xyloglucan oligosaccharides and by the by-product GDP. The enzyme has a neutral pH optimum and does not require divalent ions. Kinetic analysis indicates that GDP-fucose and xyloglucan associate with the enzyme in a random order. N-Ethylmaleimide, a cysteine-specific modifying reagent, had little effect on activity, although several other amino acid-modifying reagents strongly inhibited activity.
