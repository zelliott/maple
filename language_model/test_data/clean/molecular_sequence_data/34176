Although G2P[4] rotaviruses are common causes of acute childhood diarrhoea in Africa, to date there are no reports on whole genomic analysis of African G2P[4] strains. In this study, the nearly complete genome sequences of two Kenyan G2P[4] strains, AK26 and D205, detected in 1982 and 1989, respectively, were analysed. Strain D205 exhibited a DS-1-like genotype constellation, whilst strain AK26 appeared to be an intergenogroup reassortant with a Wa-like NSP2 genotype on the DS-1-like genotype constellation. The VP2-4, VP6-7, NSP1, NSP3 and NSP5 genes of strain AK26 and the VP2, VP4, VP7 and NSP1-5 genes of strain D205 were closely related to those of the prototype or other human G2P[4] strains. In contrast, their remaining genes were distantly related, and, except for NSP2 of AK26, appeared to originate from or share a common origin with rotavirus genes of artiodactyl (ruminant and camelid) origin. These observations highlight the complex evolutionary dynamics of African G2P[4] rotaviruses.
