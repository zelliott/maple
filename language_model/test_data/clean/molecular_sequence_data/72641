The Rh blood group system has five major antigens D, C/c, and E/e. These antigens are encoded in RHD and RHCE genes. In this report, we describe a systemic method for RhC/c and RhE/e genotyping by PCR using allele-specific oligonucleotide primers (ASO-PCR). The ASO-PCR was carried out to determine the RhC/c and RhE/e genotypes in DNA samples from 513 Japanese donors. Genotypes of RhC, RhE, and Rhe were in full concordance with serological phenotypes in 511 donors. However, in two cases with the phenotype of ccdee, the C-specific ASO-PCR product was also detected in addition to the c-specific one. This method is simple and quite useful for the RhC/c and RhE/c genotyping, although further investigation on the 2 exceptional ccdee cases is needed.
