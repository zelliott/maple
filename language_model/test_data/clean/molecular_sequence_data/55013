The development of novel peptide and peptidomimetic ligands for the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) as therapeutic agents for HIV-1 infection, cancer, and immune system diseases has grown over the last decade. In this perspective article, the design of CXCR4 agonists and antagonists from endogenous stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXCL12 and horseshoe crab-derived antimicrobial peptides and their therapeutic and diagnostic applications are described.
