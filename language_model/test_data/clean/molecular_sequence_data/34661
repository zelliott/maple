Using in silico approaches and RACE we cloned a full length trinucleotide (CAG) repeat-containing cDNA (cag-3). The cDNA is 2478 bp long and the deduced polypeptide consists of 140 amino acids of which 73 are glutamines. The genomic sequence spans approximately 79 kb on mouse chromosome 7 and the gene is composed of four exons. Standard and real-time PCR analyses of several mouse tissues showed that the gene is exclusively expressed in the brain and is not detected in embryonic stages. Within the brain, it is expressed throughout the forebrain region with predominant expression in the hypothalamus and olfactory bulb and very low levels in the mid- and hindbrain.
