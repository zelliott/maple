Leucocin A is a small heat-stable bacteriocin produced by Leuconostoc gelidum UAL187. A 2.9-kb fragment of plasmid DNA that contains the leucocin structural gene and a second open reading frame (ORF) in an operon was previously cloned (J. W. Hastings, M. Sailer, K. Johnson, K. L. Roy, J. C. Vederas, and M. E. Stiles, J. Bacteriol. 173:7491-7500, 1991). When a 1-kb DraI-HpaI fragment containing this operon was introduced into a bacteriocin-negative variant (UAL187-13), immunity but no leucocin production was detected. Leucocin production was observed when an 8-kb SacI-HindIII fragment of the leucocin plasmid was introduced into L. gelidum UAL187-13 and Lactococcus lactis IL1403. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this 8-kb fragment revealed the presence of three ORFs in an operon upstream of and on the strand opposite from the leucocin structural gene. The first ORF (lcaE) encodes a putative protein of 149 amino acids with no apparent function in leucocin A production. The second ORF (lcaC) contains 717 codons that encode a protein homologous to members of the HlyB family of ATP-binding cassette transporters. The third ORF (lcaD) contains 457 codons that encode a protein with marked similarity to LcnD, a protein essential for the expression of the lactococcal bacteriocin lactococcin A. Deletion mutations in lcaC and lcaD resulted in loss of leucocin production, indicating that LcaC and LcaD are involved in production and translocation of leucocin A. The secretion apparatus for lactococcin A did not complement mutations in the lcaCD genes to express leucocin A in L. lactis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
