In the field of molecular biology or biochemistry, preparation and use of purified proteins involved in a certain biological system is crucial for understanding their mechanisms and functions in cells or organisms. The recent progress in a cell-free translation system allows us to prepare proteins in a test tube directly from cDNAs that encode the amino acid sequences. The use of the reconstituted cell-free translation system termed PURE (Protein synthesis Using Recombinant Elements) for these purposes is effective in several applications. Here we describe methods of recombinant protein expression using the PURE system for molecular biological or biochemical studies.
