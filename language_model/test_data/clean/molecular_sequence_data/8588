The complete sequence of the pig MyoD gene has been determined through the isolation and characterization of a 17 kb genomic clone. The deduced amino acid sequence shows relative conservation of about 90% with the MyoD sequences determined in other mammalian species, though there are several non-conservative changes scattered throughout the C-terminus. In situ hybridization on pig embryos (20-30 days post coitum) showed that MyoD expression was confined to myotomes and skeletal muscle masses.
