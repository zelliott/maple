We report a partial cDNA sequence that encodes a protein, dubbed "polycystwin," with 21% identify and 46% similarity to amino acids 3688-4109 of the carboxyl terminus of polycystin, the gene product of the autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease locus located on chromosome 16 at band p13 (PKD1). Northern analysis demonstrates that the R48321 gene is expressed in all tissues examined, including both adult and fetal kidneys. Finally, in situ hybridization studies localize this novel gene to 4q22, where PKD2, the second most common locus for ADPKD, is known to map. Therefore, R48321 is an excellent candidate gene for PKD2.
