In ElasCCK2 transgenic mice expressing cholecystokinin (CCK2) receptor in acinar cells, pancreatic phenotypic alterations and preneoplastic lesions are observed. We determined whether activation of phospholipase C gamma1 (PLCgamma1), known to contribute to the tumorigenesis pathophysiology, could take place as a new signaling pathway induced by the CCK2 receptor. Overexpression and activation of the PLCgamma1 in response to gastrin was observed in acinar cells. The possibility that the C-terminal tyrosine 438 of the CCK2 receptor associates with the SH2 domains of PLCgamma1 was examined. A specific interaction was demonstrated using surface plasmon resonance, confirmed in a cellular system and by molecular modeling.
