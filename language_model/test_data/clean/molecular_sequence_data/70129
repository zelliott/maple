Aminopeptidase N purified from human placenta actively hydrolyzed various immunomodulating peptides from their N-terminus such as splenopentin, thymopentin, thymic humoral factor gamma 2, tuftsin and rigin in vitro. Aminopeptidase N also actively hydrolyzed neuropeptide hormones (met-enkephalin, somatostatin and neurokinin A) and vasoactive peptides (lysyl-bradykinin and angiotensin III) from their N-terminus. In addition, angiotensin II, secretin, thymopoietin II peptide fragment, motilin, endothelin-I and insulin were tested for hydrolysis by aminopeptidase N. Km and Vmax values for the N-terminal amino acid, Thr, a liberation from tuftsin were 267 microM and 8.33 mumol/min/mg protein, respectively. L-Leucyl-p-nitroanilidase activity in the human placental membrane fraction was almost completely neutralized by anti-aminopeptidase N antibody. Our present study suggests that possible roles for surface enzyme aminopeptidase N in the human placenta would be to down-regulate the action of immunomodulating peptides as well as vasoactive and neuropeptide hormones, and to control both immunology and endocrinology of pregnancy.
