In this study, by the generation of a specific monoclonal antibody, we identified p75/AIRM1 (for adhesion inhibitory receptor molecule 1), a novel inhibitory receptor that is mostly confined to human natural killer cells. p75/AIRM1 is a 75-kD glycoprotein that, upon sodium pervanadate treatment, becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and associates to src homology 2 domain-bearing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)-1. The p75/AIRM1 gene is located on human chromosome 19 and encodes a novel member of the sialoadhesin family characterized by three immunoglobulin-like extracellular domains (one NH(2)-terminal V-type and two C2-type) and a classical immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in the cytoplasmic portion. The highest amino acid sequence similarity has been found with the myeloid-specific CD33 molecule and the placental CD33L1 protein. Similar to other sialoadhesin molecules, p75/AIRM1 appears to mediate sialic acid-dependent ligand recognition.
