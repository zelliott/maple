Recently, we have cloned the novel isoform of the progesterone receptor (PR) cDNA (PR isoform S cDNA) from the human testicular cDNA library. The isoform S cDNA consists of the novel exon (termed the exon S of the PR gene) and the exons 4-8 of the PR gene. In order to investigate the existence of the other isoform of the human PR cDNA, the human testicular cDNA library was screened by the exons 4-8 corresponding sequence of the human PR cDNA in the present study. As a result, we have identified a novel isoform of the PR cDNA (termed the PR isoform T cDNA (PR-T cDNA)), which consisted of a previously unidentified 5'-sequence and the exons 4-8 of the PR gene. The structure of this isoform T cDNA is essentially similar to that of the isoform S cDNA. By the genomic cloning, the 5'-sequence of the PR isoform T mRNA was demonstrated to originate from a novel independent exon, exon T, which was located in the 5'-upstream region of the exon S.
