cDNA coding for preproglobulin beta, a precursor protein of 11-S globulin beta subunit, was cloned and the nucleotide sequence has been determined. The sequence covers the whole coding region (1440 base pairs) with 5' and 3' noncoding region (30 and 214 base pairs, respectively). The deduced amino acid sequence of preproglobulin beta consists of a 21-amino-acid N-terminal signal peptide, preceding the acidic gamma polypeptide region (275 amino acids) and the subsequent basic delta region (184 amino acids). The site for post-translational cleavage of the precursor polypeptide to make the gamma and delta chains is estimated to be located between the asparagine-glycine residues. The N-terminal amino acid of the gamma chain of mature 11-S globulin beta subunit was reported to be blocked by 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamic acid) [Ohmiya et al. (1980) Plant Cell Physiol. 21, 157-167]. It was shown that the blocked N-terminal amino acid is coded as a glutamine residue. The derived amino acid sequence was also compared with those of precursor proteins of other 11-S globulins such as soybean glycinin, cotton beta globulin, pea legumin and rape 11-S globulin by dot matrix analysis.
