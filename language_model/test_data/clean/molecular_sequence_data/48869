A reddish-brown bacterium, designated strain JA318(T), was purified from a photoheterotrophic enrichment culture obtained from the rhizosphere soil of paddy. Cells of strain JA318(T) are spiral shaped, Gram-stain-negative and motile by means of amphitrichous flagella. Strain JA318(T) has no NaCl requirement for growth but can tolerate up to 1.5 % (w/v) NaCl. Internal photosynthetic membranes are present as lamellar stacks. Photoorganoheterotrophy is the only growth mode observed. Strain JA318(T) contains bacteriochlorophyll a, lycopene and rhodopin as major carotenoids. Thiamine, niacin and para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) are required as growth factors. Major fatty acids are C18 : 1ω7c and C16 : 0. Ubiquinone-8 and rhodoquinone-8 are the observed quinones. Diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and an unidentified aminolipid are the major polar lipids in strain JA318(T). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the strain JA318(T) clustered with species of the genus Rhodospirillum which belongs to the class Alphaproteobacteria. The highest sequence similarity of strain JA318(T) was found with Rhodospirillum sulfurexigens JA143(T) (99.9 %). The DNA-DNA reassociation values of strain JA318(T) with Rsp. sulfurexigens JA143(T) and Rhodospirillum photometricum DSM 122(T) were 52 ± 2 % and 45 ± 1 %, respectively. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain JA318(T) was 60.2 mol%. Based on the morphological, physiological, chemotaxonomical and molecular evidence, strain JA318(T) is significantly different from the type strains of species of the genus Rhodospirillum, of the family Rhodospirillaceae, and it is proposed that the strain be classified as a representative of a novel species for which the name Rhodospirillum oryzae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is JA318(T) (= KCTC 5960(T) = NBRC 107573(T)).
