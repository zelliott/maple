To assess the role of sequestration in the maintenance of the immune privilege of the retina, retrovirally mediated gene transfer was used to express a defined, specific retinal autoantigen, rat soluble retinal Ag (S-Ag), in a systemic, nonsequestered manner. In this study we report the stable, long term transduction of rat retinal S-Ag into PBMC. Tolerance to S-Ag was assayed by challenging the S-Ag chimeric animals with S-Ag peptides in CFA and monitoring the time course and severity of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU). The resulting data showed a correlation between the incidence of S-Ag chimerism and the loss of susceptibility to EAU. The development of resistance to EAU induction supports the hypothesis that Ag sequestration contributes to retinal immune privilege.
