Although enrichment culture is typically employed to isolate cellulolytic microbes, this approach tends to favor fast-growing species and discriminates against all others. Therefore, efforts to prevent the overgrowth of fast-growing species are necessary to isolate novel cellulase-producing strains. In this study, we developed a simple culture method for isolating hitherto-uncultured microbes that possess cellulase activity, particularly exocellulase. In this method, the microbial source (a forest soil) was suspended in sterilized water and inoculated onto a mineral salts agar medium, which was then overlaid with filter paper to sandwich the microbial suspension between the agar surface and paper. The filter paper fibers served to immobilize the microbial cells and were the dominant carbon source. Following cultivation at 30°C for 2 weeks, emerging colonies were isolated based on their morphology and were then subjected to phylogenetic and enzyme analyses. Using this method, 2,150 CFUs/g dry soil were obtained, and the ratio of fungal to bacterial isolates was approximately 4:1. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that most fungal and bacterial isolates belong to ten and two genera, respectively. Notably, all isolates possessed exocellulase activity, and several strains showed strong activity that was comparable to Trichoderma cellulase. Many isolates also exhibited cellulase and xylanase activity, and several strains possessed laccase activity. It is expected that the culture method described here will be useful for the isolation of hitherto-uncultured cellulolytic microbes and the identification of novel cellulases.
