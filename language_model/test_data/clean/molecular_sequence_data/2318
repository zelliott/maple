Regulation of the expression of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (ICP10) gene was studied directly by immunofluorescence or by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase analysis with hybrid ICP10 promoter constructions. In Vero cells, cotransfection with DNA encoding HSV IE110 or Vmw65 proteins or HCMV IE2 enhanced expression at least 10-fold. In contrast, expression was minimally enhanced by DNA encoding IE175 at low doses and slightly reduced at high doses. IE110-mediated trans-activation was minimal in primary astrocytes and cells from line 293. However, Vmw65 enhanced expression 20-fold in all cell types. cis-Response elements in the ICP10 promoter include a TAATGARAT-like element and other sequences associated with regulation of IE gene expression and potential SP-1, consensus AP-1, and octamer transcription factor 1 binding elements. Factors that bind to the ICP10 promoter were identified in mock and HSV-infected cell extracts. DNA-protein complex formation, presumably involving Vmw65, was demonstrated by gel retardation analysis with mixtures of uninfected cell nuclear extracts and virion lysates. The octamer transcription factor 1 motif (ATGCAAAT) was necessary for optimal Vmw65 binding to the ICP10 promoter as evidenced by competition experiments with oligonucleotides overlapping the consensus IE110 promoter virion response element. The data suggest that ICP10 can be regulated as an immediate-early gene.
