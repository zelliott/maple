We describe the disruption and basic phenotypic analysis of six open reading frames (ORFs) of unknown function located in the left arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome VII, namely YGL133w, YGL134w, YGL136c, YGL138c, YGL142c and YGL144c. Disruptions were made using the short flanking homology PCR replacement strategy in the FY1679 and CEN.PK2 diploid strains. Sporulation and tetrad analysis of the heterozygous deletants was performed, as well as phenotypic analysis of the corresponding deleted haploid strains. No obvious phenotypes could be attributed to the strains deleted in any of the genes YGL134w, YGL138c and YGL144c under the conditions tested. YGL142c was shown to be an essential gene. Segregants bearing a deletion in YGL136c grew slowly in complete glycerol medium at 37 degrees C. Cells deleted in YGL133w showed abnormal morphology and reduced mating efficiency, but these phenotypes were observed only when the YGL133w disruption was in a MATalpha background. Ygl133 protein was found to localize to the nucleus.
