Using reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction, cDNA fragments of noncoding regions of the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) genome were obtained. These fragments were cloned into a pGEM3 vector, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. The heterogeneity of the 3'-terminal untranslated region of the TBEV RNA was revealed. To create a stable full-size DNA copy of the TBEV genome, four cDNA variants differing in length and structure of the 3'-terminal fragment of the viral RNA were cloned into a pBR322-derived vector.
