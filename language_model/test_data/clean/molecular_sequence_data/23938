Tachykinins (TKs) are the most prevalent vertebrate brain/gut peptides. In this study, we originally identified authentic TKs and their receptor from a protochordate, Ciona intestinalis. The Ciona TK (Ci-TK) precursor, like mammalian gamma-preprotachykinin A (gamma-PPTA), encodes two TKs, Ci-TK-I and -II, including the -FXGLM-NH(2) vertebrate TK consensus. Mass spectrometry of the neural extract revealed the production of both Ci-TKs. Ci-TK-I contains several Substance P (SP)-typical amino acids, whereas a Thr is exceptionally located at position 4 from the C terminus of Ci-TK-II. The Ci-TK gene encodes both Ci-TKs in the same exon, indicating no alternative generation of Ci-TKs, unlike the PPTA gene. These results suggested that the alternative splicing of the PPTA gene was established during evolution of vertebrates. The only Ci-TK receptor, Ci-TK-R, was equivalently activated by Ci-TK-I, SP, and neurokinin A at physiological concentrations, whereas Ci-TK-II showed 100-fold less potent activity, indicating that the ligand selectivity of Ci-TK-R is distinct from those of vertebrate TK receptors. Ci-TK-I, like SP, also elicited the typical contraction on the guinea pig ileum. The Ci-TK gene was expressed in neurons of the brain ganglion, small cells in the intestine, and the zone 7 in the endostyle, which corresponds to the vertebrate thyroid gland. Furthermore, the Ci-TK-R mRNA was distributed in these three tissues plus the gonad. These results showed that Ci-TKs play major roles in sexual behavior and feeding in protochordates as brain/gut peptides and endocrine/paracrine molecules. Taken together, our data revealed the biochemical and structural origins of vertebrate TKs and their receptors.
