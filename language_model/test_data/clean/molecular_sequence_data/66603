Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri and Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides LC can be combined into one taxon on the basis of several contributions on both DNA sequence and protein analyses reported in the literature. Moreover, for the differentiation and identification of mycoplasmas of the "mycoides cluster", we investigated the rpoB gene, encoding the beta-subunit of the RNA polymerase. A segment of 527 bp of the rpoB gene was amplified from 31 strains of ruminant mycoplasmas by PCR. The nucleotide sequences were determined and aligned, and accurate genetic relationships were calculated. Cluster analysis of rpoB DNA allowed species differentiation within the "mycoides cluster" and confirmed that M. mycoides subsp. capri and M. mycoides subsp. mycoides LC cannot be distinguished from each other. "Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri" is proposed as a common name for both subspecies.
