NAD(+)-dependent 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11HSD2) converts glucocorticoids to 11-oxo derivatives and thus decreases their local concentration and prevents them from activating corticosteroid receptors. In this paper we report the partial cloning, characterization and tissue distribution of chicken 11HSD2. A cDNA of 991bp was cloned from kidney mRNA by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction. At the amino acid level, the sequence of PCR product had 56-59% homology with mammalian and 46-48% with fish 11HSD2. The consensus sequences of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily such as the catalytic activity motif Tyr-X-X-X-Lys and cosubstrate-binding motif Gly-X-X-X-Gly-X-Gly, were found in the cloned cDNA. Analysis of the tissue expression of chicken 11HSD2 mRNA and NAD(+)-dependent 11beta-oxidase activity showed a similar tissue distribution pattern in the majority of tissues. High levels of expression and activity were found in kidney, small intestine, colon and oviduct; low in ovary and almost zero in brain, liver and testis.
