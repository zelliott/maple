Haemagglutinin glycoproteins are the components of influenza virus membranes against which infectivity-neutralizing antibodies are directed. Sequence analysis of natural and laboratory-selected variant haemagglutinins indicates the regions of the molecule recognized by antibodies and by helper T cells; the identity of these regions and the relations between them are discussed.
