In these studies, we examined the effects of OX40 ligand (OX40L) deficiency on the development of Th2 cells during the Th2 immune response to the intestinal nematode parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus. Elevations in IL-4 production and total and Ag-specific serum IgE levels were partially inhibited during both the primary and memory immune responses to H. polygyrus in OX40L(-/-) mice. The host-protective memory response was compromised in OX40L(-/-) mice, as decreased worm expulsion and increased egg production were observed compared with H. polygyrus-inoculated OX40L(+/+) mice. To further examine the nature of the IL-4 defect during priming, adoptively transferred DO11.10 T cells were analyzed in the context of the H. polygyrus response. Although Ag-specific T cell IL-4 production was reduced in the OX40L(-/-) mice following immunization with OVA peptide plus H. polygyrus, Ag-specific T cell expansion, cell cycle progression, CXCR5 expression, and migration were comparable between OX40L(+/+) and OX40L(-/-) mice inoculated with OVA and H. polygyrus. These studies suggest an important role for OX40/OX40L interactions in specifically promoting IL-4 production, as well as associated IgE elevations, in Th2 responses to H. polygyrus. However, OX40L interactions were not required for serum IgG1 elevations, increases in germinal center formation, and Ag-specific Th2 cell expansion and migration to the B cell zone.
