Genome-wide analysis has revealed abundant FabG (beta-ketoacyl-ACP reductase) paralogs, with uncharacterized biological functions, in several halophilic archaea. In this study, we identified for the first time that the fabG1 gene, but not the other five fabG paralogs, encodes the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)-specific acetoacetyl coenzyme A (acetoacetyl-CoA) reductase in Haloarcula hispanica. Although all of the paralogous fabG genes were actively transcribed, only disruption or knockout of fabG1 abolished PHA synthesis, and complementation of the DeltafabG1 mutant with the fabG1 gene restored both PHA synthesis capability and the NADPH-dependent acetoacetyl-CoA reductase activity. In addition, heterologous coexpression of the PHA synthase genes (phaEC) together with fabG1, but not its five paralogs, reconstructed the PHA biosynthetic pathway in Haloferax volcanii, a PHA-defective haloarchaeon. Taken together, our results indicate that FabG1 in H. hispanica, and possibly its counterpart in Haloarcula marismortui, has evolved the distinct function of supplying precursors for PHA biosynthesis, like PhaB in bacteria. Hence, we suggest the renaming of FabG1 in both genomes as PhaB, the PHA-specific acetoacetyl-CoA reductase of halophilic archaea.
