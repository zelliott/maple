Intracerebral inoculation of susceptible strains of mice with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) results in a chronic, immunologically mediated demyelinating disease that shares many features with human multiple sclerosis. CD4+ T lymphocytes play a critical role in the pathogenesis of virus-induced demyelinating disease. We have identified a region within amino acid residues 24 to 37 of the VP3 capsid protein of TMEV (VP3(24-37)) that is recognized by T lymphocytes from the demyelination-susceptible SJL/J strain of mice. The T-cell response to VP3(24-37) represents a predominant Th-cell response against the virus from either TMEV-immunized or TMEV-infected SJL/J mice, and viral epitopes VP1(233-250), VP2(74-86), and VP3(24-37) account for most of the Th-cell response to TMEV.
