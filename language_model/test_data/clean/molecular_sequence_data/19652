Single-subunit polymerases are universally encoded in both cellular organisms and viruses. Their three-dimensional structures have the shape of a right-hand with the active site located in the palm region, which has a topology similar to that of the RNA recognition motif (RRM) found in many RNA-binding proteins. Considering that polymerases have well conserved structures, it was surprising that the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases from birnaviruses, a group of dsRNA viruses, have their catalytic motifs arranged in a permuted order in sequence. Here we report the 2.5 A structure of a birnavirus VP1 in which the polymerase palm subdomain adopts a new active site topology that has not been previously observed in other polymerases. In addition, the polymerase motif C of VP1 has the sequence of -ADN-, a highly unusual feature for RNA-dependent polymerases. Through site-directed mutagenesis, we have shown that changing the VP1 motif C from -ADN- to -GDD- results in a mutant with an increased RNA synthesis activity. Our results indicate that the active site topology of VP1 may represent a newly developed branch in polymerase evolution, and that birnaviruses may have acquired the -ADN- mutation to control their growth rate.
