The conventional concept is that the insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) are cysteine-rich proteins, with conserved N- and C-domains, that are capable of binding insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) with high affinity. This dogma was recently challenged by the discovery of a group of cysteine-rich proteins that share important structural similarities with the IGFBPs, but have demonstrably lower affinity for IGFs. It is therefore proposed that these IGFBP-related proteins (IGFBP-rPs) and the IGFBPs constitute an IGFBP superfamily. We speculate that the IGFBP superfamily is derived from an ancestral gene/protein that was critically involved in the regulation of cell growth and was capable of binding IGF peptides. Over the course of evolution, some members (IGFBPs) evolved into high-affinity IGF binders and others (IGFBP-rPs) into low-affinity IGF binders, thereby conferring on the IGFBP superfamily the ability to influence cell growth by both IGF-dependent and IGF-independent means.
