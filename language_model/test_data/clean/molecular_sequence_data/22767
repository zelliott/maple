Directed cloning approaches and large-scale sequencing of several vertebrate genomes unveiled many new members of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, among them GPR34. Initial studies showed that GPR34 is an evolutionarily old GPCR structurally related to a group of ADP-like receptors. To gain insight into the genomic organization, regulation of expression, and supragenomic diversification of GPR34 several vertebrate species were analyzed. In contrast to the obviously intronless coding region GPR34 displays an evolutionary preserved 5' noncoding intron-exon structure. Further, an alternatively used cryptic intron was identified within the coding region, which shortens the N terminus by 47 amino acids. Ubiquitous expression of GPR34 is driven by genomic sequences upstream of at least two transcriptional start regions in mouse and rat but only one region in human. In rodents, both promoters are active in all tissues investigated, but the level of activity is tissue-specific. At the translational level, several conserved in-frame AUGs within the first 150 bp of the coding region may serve as start points for translation in human and other mammals. Combinatory mutagenesis and expression of reporter constructs confirmed these multiple translational start points and revealed a preference for the second in-frame AUG in human GPR34. Our data show that multiple translation initiation starts and alternative splicing contribute to the supragenomic diversification of GPR34.
