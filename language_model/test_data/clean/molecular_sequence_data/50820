The 1,10-phenanthroline-cuprous complex (OP-Cu) with hydrogen peroxide as a coreactant nicks the single-stranded loops and bulges of RNA stem-loop structures more rapidly than the double-stranded stems. This chemical nuclease is therefore a useful footprinting reagent for these regions and can be used to monitor both intramolecular and intermolecular hybridization of single-stranded domains. The formation of A-form structures characteristic of either RNA-RNA or RNA-DNA duplexes inhibits scission because it blocks the binding site of the coordination complex in single-stranded loops and not because the oxidatively sensitive hydrogens of the ribose moiety are blocked. The C-4' and C-1' hydrogens are accessible to solvent in A-structures.
