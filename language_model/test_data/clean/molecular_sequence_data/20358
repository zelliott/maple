During 1998-2008, there were 31 strains of Gordonia species isolated from clinical specimens in our laboratory. Our identification of the 31 strains of Gordonia species showed that major pathogenic Gordonia species in Japan were classifiable, respectively into 14 and 13 strains of Gordonia sputi and Gordonia bronchialis. The four remaining strains were identified as three Gordonia species: G. aichiensis (2 strains), and G. terrae (1 strain), and G. otitidis (1 strain). Results of drug susceptibility tests for these 31 strains of Gordonia isolates are reported herein.
