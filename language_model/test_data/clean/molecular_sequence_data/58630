We have sequenced a DNA fragment of 39,411 bp which includes part of the left telomere of chromosome VII of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have identified 19 open reading frames (ORFs); six correspond to known yeast genes (ADH4, FZF1, HKB, RTG2, HFM1 and PDE1), nine have similarity with other genes and four exhibit no significant similarity with any known gene. The average size of these ORFs seems to be related to their location, the eight ORF's nearest the telomere being shorter than the 11 others. These two groups of genes are separated by a region of 4.5 kb devoid of significant ORFs. One ORF, NRF120, is a new member of the seripauperine family, represented once in all sequenced yeast chromosomes, in a subtelomeric location.
