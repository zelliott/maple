3-Deoxyglucosone (3DG) is a reactive intermediate in the glucose-mediated cross-linking of proteins. An enzyme catalyzing the reduction of 3DG is thought to prevent the damage to protein by the formation of 3DG. The NADPH-dependent enzyme activity was detected in the extracts of various monkey tissues, among which kidney exhibited the highest specific activity. One dimeric enzyme with subunit M(r) of 39,000 and two monomeric enzymes with M(r) of 38,000 and 34,000 were purified from monkey kidney. The dimeric enzyme exhibited high dihydrodiol dehydrogenase activity and was immunochemically identical to dimeric dihydrodiol dehydrogenase of monkey kidney. The two monomeric enzymes exhibited aldehyde reductase activity, but were clearly distinct from each other in substrate specificity, inhibitor sensitivity, and effect of sulfate ions. One enzyme was immunologically cross-reacted with human liver aldehyde reductase, whereas sequence data of digested peptides from the other enzyme revealed > 97% identity with human placental aldose reductase. Comparison of kinetic constants among the monkey kidney enzymes and aldoketo reductases from several mammalian tissues indicated that dimeric dihydrodiol dehydrogenase and aldose reductase exhibited higher catalytic efficiency for 3DG than did aldehyde reductase, carbonyl reductase, and monomeric dihydrodiol dehydrogenase.
