Strain NX02(T), a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium, was isolated from soil, and its taxonomic position was investigated using a polyphasic approach. Chemotaxonomic analysis revealed that strain NX02(T) possessed Q-10 as the predominant ubiquinone, sym-homospermidine as the major polyamine and C(18 : 1)omega7c, C(16 : 0) and C(14 : 0) 2-OH as the major fatty acids. The main polar lipids were sphingoglycolipid, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine and an unidentified glycolipid. The DNA G+C content was 66.4 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain NX02(T) belongs to the alpha-4 subgroup of the Proteobacteria, exhibiting the highest sequence similarity with respect to Sphingomonas azotifigens NBRC 15497(T) (95.9 %), Sphingomonas pituitosa DSM 13101(T) (95.8 %) and Sphingomonas dokdonensis KCTC 12541(T) (95.8 %). On the basis of these results, strain NX02(T) represents a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas sensu stricto, for which the name Sphingomonas sanxanigenens sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NX02(T) (=DSM 19645(T) =CGMCC 1.6417(T)).
