The major immunogenic protein VP2 from a pathogenic field isolate (variant A virus) of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) was cloned and sequenced to examine antigenic variations. The VP2 open reading frame consists of 1509 nucleotides and codes for a 503 amino acid protein. Overall, the VP2 amino acid sequence of the variant A virus shares 98.6% identity with VP2 genes from other published IBDV strains. However, within the central region of VP2 (amino acids 222-334) lies a highly divergent area that we have termed the variable domain. Relative to five other IBDV isolates, a total of six amino acid changes occur within the variable domain of the variant A virus. At positions 284-288, a substitution of isoleucine to threonine, a decrease in the number of Chou and Fasman beta turns, and a switch from a hydrophilic to a hydrophobic region are found only in the variant A virus. Together these changes predict a decrease in antigenicity as determined by calculation of potential antigenic sites. This suggests that only minor changes within VP2 contributed to the emergence of a variant virus that can cause disease in immunized birds.
