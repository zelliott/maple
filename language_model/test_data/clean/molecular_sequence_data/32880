The SALMFamides are a family of neuropeptides found in species belonging to the phylum Echinodermata and which act as muscle relaxants. The first two members of this family to be identified were both isolated from the starfishes Asterias rubens and Asterias forbesi and are known as S1 (GFNSALMFamide) and S2 (SGPYSFNSGLTFamide). However, little is known about the occurrence and characteristics of SALMFamide neuropeptides in other starfish species. Here we report the identification of four SALMFamide neuropeptides in the starfish Marthasterias glacialis: GFNSALMFamide (S1), SGPYSMTSGLTFamide (MagS2), AYHSALPFamide (MagS3), and AYQTGLPFamide (MagS4). Analysis of the effects of MagS2 and MagS3 on cardiac stomach preparations from Asterias rubens revealed that both peptides cause dose-dependent relaxation, consistent with previous studies using S1 and S2. The identification of four SALMFamide neuropeptides in Marthasterias glacialis provides new insights into the diversity and phylogenetic distribution of SALMFamide neuropeptides in the class Asteroidea of the phylum Echinodermata. In particular, the identification of MagS3 and MagS4, in addition to S1 and the S2-like peptide MagS2, has revealed a greater diversity of SALMFamide neuropeptides occurring in a starfish species than any previous studies.
