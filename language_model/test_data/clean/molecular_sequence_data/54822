The intrasubspecies diversity of six strains of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was investigated at the genomic level and in terms of phenotypic and transcriptomic profiles in an ultrafiltration cheese model. The six strains were isolated from various sources, but all exhibited a dairy phenotype (growth in ultrafiltration cheese model and high acidification rate). The six strains exhibited similar behaviors in terms of growth during cheese ripening, while different acidification capabilities were detected. Even if all strains displayed large genomic similarities, sharing a large core genome of almost 2,000 genes, the expression of this core genome directly in the cheese matrix revealed major strain-specific differences that potentially could account for the observed different acidification capabilities. This work demonstrated that significant transcriptomic polymorphisms exist even among Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strains with the same dairy origin.
