The replication fork blocks are common in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In most cases, these blocks are associated with increased levels of mitotic recombination. One of the best-characterized replication fork blocks in eukaryotes is found in ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It has been shown that the replication fork blocking protein Fob1p regulates the recombination rate and the number of rDNA copies in S. cerevisiae, but the mechanistic aspects of these events are still poorly understood. Sequence profile searches revealed that Fob1p is related to retroviral integrases. Subsequently, the catalytic domain of HIV-1 integrase was used as a template to build a reliable three-dimensional model of Fob1p. Structural insights from this study may be useful in explaining Fob1p-mediated formation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles that accelerate aging in yeast and recombination events that lead to expansion or contraction of rDNA.
