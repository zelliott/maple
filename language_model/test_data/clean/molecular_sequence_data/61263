Monoclonal antibodies generated against multiple antigenic peptides of the N-terminal sequence (3LVPSARAELQSSPLV17) of the cloned delta opioid receptor immunoprecipitated a 58 kDa protein from CHAPS-solubilized NG108-15 membranes. The immunoprecipitates bound [3H]DPDPE--but not [3H]DAMGO--with a Kd of 6.4 nM and a Bmax of 75 pM. Western blot analysis revealed a distinct band of 58 kDa. The antibodies inhibited basal and PGE1-stimulated cAMP levels, and mimicked the effect of agonists manifest in a compensatory increase in cAMP formation. The antibody will be potentially useful in the analysis of functional epitopes on the delta opioid receptor.
