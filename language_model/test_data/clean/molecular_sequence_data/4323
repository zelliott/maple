Dihydroxyacetone-phosphate acyl-transferase (DHAP-AT), a peroxisomal membrane-bound enzyme that catalyzes the first step of ether-glycerolipid synthesis, was purified from liver of rats treated with fenofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator. The protocol first included isolation of peroxisomes, their purification through a discontinuous gradient and solubilization of membranes in CHAPS. DHAP-AT was further purified by four chromatographic steps, namely low-pressure size-exclusion, cation-exchange, hydroxylapatite and chromatofocusing. The chromatofocusing step led to a 4000-fold increase in the specific activity of DHAP-AT with respect to the liver homogenate with a yield of about 0.2%. Trypsin digestion of a 64-kDa protein band upon SDS-PAGE resulted in a peptide sequence unknown in databases. A corresponding degenerated oligonucleotide was used as a probe in Northern blotting, and a transcript of 3.3 kb was detected in some rat tissues. Moreover, the overall procedure allowed co-purification of four major peroxisomal enzymes: urate-oxidase, catalase, multifunctional enzyme and palmitoyl-CoA oxidase, respectively.
