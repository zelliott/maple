The nucleotide sequence of bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype 17 segment 8 from North America (NA) coding for the nonstructural phosphoprotein, NS2, was determined. This segment contains 1125 base pairs and codes for a protein of 40,581 daltons containing 354 amino acids with a net charge of -8.5 at pH 7.0. The carboxyl terminal portion of the protein is very hydrophilic and has a high degree of potential alpha-helix. Serine is the major, if not the exclusive, phosphorylated amino acid residue and ten of the twenty serine residues present in NS2 are found in consensus phosphorylation sites. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of BTV-17NA segment 8 with the sequence of BTV-10NA and BTV-10 South Africa (SA) revealed a greater degree of homology between different serotypes within the same geographical area, i.e., 17NA and 10NA, than between isolates of the same serotype located in different areas, i.e., 10NA and 10SA. The same homology relationship as above was found at the amino acid level.
