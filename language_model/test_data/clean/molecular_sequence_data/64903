The genera Cryptococcus and Dioszegia contain basidiomycetous yeasts found in a wide range of habitats. Primers to amplify the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) also allow detecting members of this yeast group. Here we report the results of a sequence analysis using maximum parsimony on a set of 50 ITS sequences of yeasts associated with AMF structures (roots of 26 plant species, AM spores) from six field sites in Central Germany. Among 10 separated taxa, respectively five in the Tremellales and two in the Filobasidiales had unknown sequences. Therefore it was not possible to assign these sequences to any known species. The study indicates that exploring the diversity of Cryptococcus and Dioszegia in soil habitats with molecular methods might enlarge the actually estimated biodiversity of the group.
