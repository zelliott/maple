Caspase-5 is a caspase-1-like protease with pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory activities. Here we have identified a novel exon at the 5'-end of the human caspase-5 gene. This novel exon was present in six alternatively spliced caspase-5 mRNA variants expressed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and encoded the previously unknown amino-terminus of caspase-5. The genomic region upstream of this exon contained sequence elements homologous to those of the caspase-11 promoter in the mouse, and transcription of caspase-5 was upregulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a caspase-11-like manner in human PBMC in vivo. Taken together, our findings call for a revision of the structure of caspase-5 at the genomic level as well as at the mRNA and protein levels.
