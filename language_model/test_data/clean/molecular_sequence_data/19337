Biserrula pelecinus L. is a pasture legume species that forms a highly specific nitrogen-fixing symbiotic interaction with a group of bacteria that belong to Mesorhizobium. These mesorhizobia have >98.8 % sequence similarity to Mesorhizobium ciceri and Mesorhizobium loti for the 16S rRNA gene (1440 bp) and >99.3 % sequence similarity to M. ciceri for the dnaK gene (300 bp), and strain WSM1271 has 100 % sequence similarity to M. ciceri for GSII (600 bp). Strain WSM1271 had 85 % relatedness to M. ciceri LMG 14989(T) and 50 % relatedness to M. loti LMG 6125(T) when DNA-DNA hybridization was performed. WSM1271 also had a similar cellular fatty acid profile to M. ciceri. These results are strong evidence that the Biserrula mesorhizobia and M. ciceri belong to the same group of bacteria. Significant differences were revealed between the Biserrula mesorhizobia and M. ciceri in growth conditions, antibiotic resistance and carbon source utilization. The G+C content of the DNA of WSM1271 was 62.7 mol%, compared to 63-64 mol% for M. ciceri. The Biserrula mesorhizobia contained a plasmid ( approximately 500 bp), but the symbiotic genes were detected on a mobile symbiosis island and considerable variation was present in the symbiotic genes of Biserrula mesorhizobia and M. ciceri. There was <78.6 % sequence similarity for nodA and <66.9 % for nifH between Biserrula mesorhizobia and M. ciceri. Moreover, the Biserrula mesorhizobia did not nodulate the legume host of M. ciceri, Cicer arietinum, and M. ciceri did not nodulate B. pelecinus. These significant differences observed between Biserrula mesorhizobia and M. ciceri warrant the proposal of a novel biovar for Biserrula mesorhizobia within M. ciceri. The name Mesorhizobium ciceri biovar biserrulae is proposed, with strain WSM1271 (=LMG 23838=HAMBI 2942) as the reference strain.
