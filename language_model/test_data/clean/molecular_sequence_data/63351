The genome structure and organization of a new and distinct caulimovirus that is widespread in dahlia (Dahlia variabilis) was determined. The double-stranded DNA genome was ca. 7.0 kb in size and shared many of the features of the members of the genus Caulimovirus, such as the presence of genes potentially coding for the movement protein, the inclusion body protein, and the reverse transcriptase (RT), and an intergenic region consisting of a potential 35S promoter. However, the virus differed from the previously described dahlia mosaic caulimovirus and other known caulimoviruses in that the aphid transmission factor (ATF) was absent and the putative coat protein contained a C-terminal deletion and was fused in-frame with the RT. Sequence identity at the amino acid level with known caulimoviruses including a previously reported caulimovirus from dahlia was low and ranged from 32 to 72%. The absence of an ATF and the highly divergent nature of the genomic sequence are characteristics of this new caulimovirus that is widely associated with dahlia.
