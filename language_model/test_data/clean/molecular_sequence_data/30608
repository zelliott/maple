The broad host range streptococcal plasmid pLS1 encodes the 24.2 kDa protein RepB, which is involved in the initiation of plasmid replication by an asymmetric rolling circle. RepB was overproduced in an Escherichia coli expression system and the protein was purified and characterized. Determination of the amino-terminal sequence of RepB protein showed that translation starts from the first AUG codon, which is preceded by an atypical ribosome-binding site sequence. RepB protein has in vitro-specific endonuclease and topoisomerase-like activities on the plasmid ori(+). Footprinting experiments showed that RepB protein binds to a DNA region that includes three direct repeats of 11 base-pairs. Initiation of replication of pLS1 could start by a RepB-generated specific nick introduced on the plasmid coding strand. However, as a striking difference with other Gram-positive replicons, the nick generated by RepB lies 86 base-pairs upstream from its binding region. To explain the action of RepB at a distance, complex structures of the pLS1 ori(+) are proposed.
