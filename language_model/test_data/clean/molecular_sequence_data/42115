Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and endothelin-3 (ET-3) induced a biphasic response (relaxation and contraction) in the guinea pig ileum. Short-term activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) inhibited the contractile but not the relaxing component of the responses, as did H-7. Long-term pretreatment with PDBu reversed the short-term inhibition but did not affect the tachyphylaxis induced by ET-1. These results suggest that PKC contributes to ET-1 contraction but not to tachyphylaxis. The ETA antagonist BQ-123, at 34 nM, competitively inhibited ET-1 contraction, but at 340 nM the inhibition was noncompetitive. Dose-response curves for ET-1 relaxation were shifted to the left. For ET-3, BQ-123 (340 nM) only decreased the maximal contractile response of the dose-response curve without affecting the relaxation. We suggest that in this tissue there is one receptor for ET-1-induced contraction, which is competitively antagonized by BQ-123, and another one for ET-3-induced contraction, which is noncompetitively antagonized by BQ-123.
