The human rotavirus G9 strain is the fifth most common rotavirus worldwide. A human rotavirus G9P[8] strain CAU05-202 was isolated from a young child with diarrhea using a cell culture system, and its major gene sequences were determined. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP7 gene revealed that CAU05-202 clustered into genetic lineage III-d and was most closely related to G9 rotaviruses from Turkey (strain GUH13) and Sri Lanka (strain 05SLC056 and 05SLC057). VP4 and NSP4 gene analysis showed that CAU05-202 belongs to the P[8]-3 lineage and genotype B, respectively. In addition, CAU05-202 has a long RNA electropherotype, supported by VP6 gene analysis, which is clearly associated with subgroup II specificity. Analysis of the G9 rotavirus strain CAU05-202 provides information concerning the genetic relationships among global rotavirus G9 strains, suggesting that closely related G9 strains are persistent and widespread in Asian countries.
