We identified and characterized the gene encoding a new eukaryotic-type protein kinase from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) M145. PkaD, consisting of 598 amino acid residues, contained the catalytic domain of eukaryotic protein kinases in the N-terminal region. A hydrophobicity plot indicated the presence of a putative transmembrane spanning sequence downstream of the catalytic domain, suggesting that PkaD is a transmembrane protein kinase. The recombinant PkaD was found to be phosphorylated at the threonine and tyrosine residues. In S. coelicolor A3(2), pkaD was transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA, and it was expressed constitutively throughout the life cycle. Disruption of chromosomal pkaD resulted in a significant loss of actinorhodin production. This result implies the involvement of pkaD in the regulation of secondary metabolism.
