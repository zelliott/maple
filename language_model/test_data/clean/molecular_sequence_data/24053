To understand the origin and evolution of common wheat, chloroplast (ct) and nuclear DNA variations were studied in five hexaploid and three tetraploid wheat subspecies. Based on chloroplast simple sequence repeats at 24 loci, they were classified into two major plastogroups. Plastogroup I consisted of 11 plastotypes, including the major plastotype H10 that occurred at the highest frequency (59%) in common wheat. Plastogroup II consisted of five plastotypes and occurred in eight out of 27 accessions of T. aestivum ssp. spelta and one accession of ssp. aestivum. As for nuclear DNA variations, AFLP data using 10 primer sets revealed two major clades of a phylogenetic tree constructed by UPGMA (unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean), one consisting of common wheat and the other of emmer wheat. The clade of common wheat was further divided into two major and six minor subclades. One of the major subclades consisted only of non-free-threshing ssp. spelta accessions, which were grouped into two clusters, one consisting only of accessions with plastogroup I ctDNA and the other with both plastogroups I and II. T. aestivum ssp. macha, another non-free-threshing common wheat, formed the other cluster. Taken together, our data indicate the existence of at least two maternal lineages in common wheat and support the hypothesis that European spela wheat originated in Europe separately from other groups of common wheat.
