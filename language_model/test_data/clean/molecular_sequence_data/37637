The genes encoding cytochrome f (petA), cytochrome b(6) (petB), the Rieske FeS-protein (petC), and subunit IV (petD) of the cytochrome b(6)f complex from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus were cloned and sequenced. Similar to other cyanobacteria, the structural genes are arranged in two short, single-copy operons, petC/petA and petB/petD, respectively. In addition, five open reading frames with homology to known orfs from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 were identified in the immediate vicinity of these two operons.
