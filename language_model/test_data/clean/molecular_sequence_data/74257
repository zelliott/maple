Chemokine receptor CXCR6 mediates the chemotaxis and adhesion of leukocytes to soluble and membrane-anchored forms of CXCL16, and is an HIV-1 co-receptor. Here, we describe the effects of mutation of acidic extracellular CXCR6 residues on receptor function. Although most CXCR6 mutants examined were expressed at levels similar to wild-type (WT) CXCR6, an N-terminal E3Q mutant was poorly expressed, which may explain previously reported protective effects of a similar single nucleotide polymorphism, with respect to late-stage HIV-1 infection. In contrast to several other chemokine receptors, mutation of the CXCR6 N terminus and inhibition of post-translational modifications of this region were without effect on receptor function. Likewise, N-terminal extension of CXCL16 resulted in a protein with decent potency and efficacy in chemotaxis and not, as anticipated, a CXCR6 antagonist. D176N and E274Q CXCR6 mutants were unable to interact with soluble CXCL16, suggesting a critical role for D176 and E274 in ligand binding. Intriguingly, although unable to interact with soluble CXCL16, the E274Q mutant could promote robust adhesion to membrane-anchored CXCL16, suggesting that soluble and membrane-bound forms of CXCL16 possess distinct conformations. Collectively, our data suggest a novel paradigm for the CXCR6:CXCL16 interaction, a finding which may impact the discovery of small-molecule antagonists of CXCR6.
