The first exon of tat was sequenced from 23 provirus genomes randomly amplified directly from an HIV-1-infected individual's peripheral blood. Twelve of the 23 sequences constituted a distinct subset of the quasi-species detected. This subset had in common two inactivating mutations in the tat gene. In addition, two of these defective genomes each had a unique mutation. This is the second instance of a defective early gene being present in a high percentage of the proviruses present in the PBMCs of an HIV-1-infected individual, (the first reported by Martins LP et al.: J Virol 1991;65:4502-4507), and suggests that genomes defective in an early gene can participate in the infectious spread of HIV-1 in vivo.
