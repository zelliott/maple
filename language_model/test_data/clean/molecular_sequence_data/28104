Sera from three chimpanzees infected with a primary lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV-1) or human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-IIIB) passage, from two chimpanzees infected with blood from the primary infected chimpanzees, and from one chimpanzee infected with blood from a secondary passage animal all bound the peptides 3B and 3B/RF, sharing the sequence IQRGPGR, with equally high titers. Pepscan analysis confirmed the amino acids Q, R, G, P, and G as irreplaceable in order to retain antigenicity.
