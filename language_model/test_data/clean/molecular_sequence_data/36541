Examination of published rat and human sequences for the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) gene indicated the presence of CA dinucleotide repeats in corresponding segments of each. Presence of similar microsatellite sequences in the porcine and bovine IGF-I genes was hypothesized. A 1200-bp segment upstream of the porcine and bovine IGF-I genes was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers developed from a consensus of human, rat and bovine sequences. Both porcine and bovine PCR products contained similar microsatellite sequences. Amplified pIGF-I DNA was cloned and sequenced, and an additional primer was developed specifically for microsatellite marker detection. Six allelic variants of 124, 130, 132, 134, 136 or 138 bp were observed in pigs with differing frequencies between breeds (P < 0.01). The same primers were used to amplify the corresponding bovine microsatellite. Three alleles of 126, 128 and 130 bp were observed in a genetically diverse cattle population with estimated frequencies of 0.06, 0.68 and 0.26, respectively. Results of this study indicate sequence information from the human and laboratory species can be used to facilitate genetic marker development in livestock species.
