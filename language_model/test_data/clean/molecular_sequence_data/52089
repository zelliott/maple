N-Tyr-MIF-1 (Tyr-Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2) is an endogenous brain peptide with multiple effects on animal behavior. However, there have been no studies on the conformation of this tetrapeptide. In this report, we studied the conformation of N-Tyr-MIF-1 in aqueous solution by conventional one-dimensional and two-dimensional (COSY and NOESY) 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 300 MHz. A complete set of assignments for the resolved resonances and approximate assignments for the overlapping resonances were made. The results demonstrate that N-Tyr-MIF-1 is in slow exchange between two conformers, most likely determined by the cis and trans states of the proline residue. The minor conformation represents 30 +/- 3% of the population over the temperature range from 3 degrees to 73 degrees. In the major conformation, the tyrosine aromatic ring appears to be close enough to interact directly with the proline pyrrolidine ring, as indicated by a strong temperature dependence of the proline C beta H, C delta H and C delta H' chemical shifts. In contrast, this interaction of the tyrosine and proline rings is not present in the minor conformation.
