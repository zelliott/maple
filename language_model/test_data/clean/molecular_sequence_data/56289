Mice reconstituted with BCR/ABL-infected 5-fluorouracil-treated bone marrow are considered a model system for human chronic myelogenous leukemia, a malignancy that arises in hematopoietic stem cells. These animals develop multiple types of hematopoietic tumors, which could arise either from undifferentiated cells that mature during tumor development or from progenitors committed to different lineages. To examine the BCR/ABL-sensitive target cells present in the marrow of mice treated with 5-fluorouracil, we used a single-step in vitro assay. These experiments revealed that both the P210 and P185 BCR/ABL proteins and the related v-abl protein induce lymphoid and myeloid colonies, colony types that mimic two of the prominent types of tumors found in the reconstitution model. The lymphoid colonies were similar to lymphoid colonies found following infection of normal bone marrow with respect to differentiation state and tumorigenicity. The cells in the myeloid colonies were differentiated and non-tumorigenic. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting revealed that most of the lymphoid and myeloid colonies arose from distinct precursors and that the lymphoid colonies arose from B-lineage-committed cells. These data suggest that most of the lymphomas observed in the reconstitution model arise from committed progenitors that are distinct from those involved in the myeloid disease.
