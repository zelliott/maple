We describe the identification and detailed expression pattern of a second Drosophila Sox gene, SoxNeuro (SoxN), highly related to mammalian group B Sox1, 2, 3 genes. SoxN is expressed in a highly dynamic pattern during embyogenesis, being associated with the development of the central nervous system (CNS), from the early steps onwards. We present strong evidence that the early SoxN neuroectoderm expression is controlled by the zygotic dorso-ventral patterning genes (dpp, sog, brk, twi).
