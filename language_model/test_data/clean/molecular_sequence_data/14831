A novel gene was identified from a cDNA library of the male accessory glands of Haemaphysalis longicornis. The full-length cDNA of the gene was 349bp, encoding a 79-amino acid defensin-like protein and therefore the protein was named HlMS-defensin. Reverse transcriptase-PCR results suggested that this gene was expressed exclusively in male ticks. The tissue expression pattern and the mRNA levels of HlMS-defensin during blood feeding were determined using real-time PCR. HlMS-defensin was expressed predominately in the male accessory gland and was up-regulated during blood feeding. The antimicrobial activity of a synthetic peptide based on the predicted mature portion of HlMS-defensin was examined against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. It appears that ticks use the antimicrobial peptide to protect their reproductive tracts from microbial infections. The protective role of HlMS-defensin during mating was also discussed.
