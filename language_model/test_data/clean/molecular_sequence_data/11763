Repetitive DNA sequences in the terminal heterochromatin of rye (Secale cereale) chromosomes have consequences for the structural and functional organization of chromosomes. The large-scale genomic organization of these regions was studied using the telomeric repeat from Arabidopsis and clones of three nonhomologous, tandemly repeated, subtelomeric DNA families with complex but contrasting higher order structural organizations. Polymerase chain reaction analysis with a single primer showed a fraction of the repeat units of one family organized in a "head-to-head" orientation. Such structures suggest evolution of chromosomes by chromatid-type breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. In situ hybridization and pulse field gel electrophoresis showed the order of the repeats and the heterogeneity in the lengths of individual arrays. After Xbal digestion and pulse field gel electrophoresis, the telomeric and two subtelomeric clones showed strong hybridization signals from 40 to 100 kb, with a maximum at 50 to 60 kb. We suggest that these fragments define a basic higher order structure and DNA loop domains of regions of rye chromosomes consisting of arrays of tandemly organized sequences.
