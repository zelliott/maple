We report here the identification of a novel DQB1*06 allele, DQB1*0618, found in a bone marrow donor. The new allele was detected during routine DNA-based HLA typing by an ambiguous pattern of probe hybridization, obtained by polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific oligonucleotides (PCR-SSO). Molecular cloning and sequencing confirmed that the new allele is identical to DQB1*0609 at exon 2 except for 3 nucleotide substitutions at positions 353, 356 and 367, also found in other alleles. These nucleotide changes may explain its anomalous reactivity.
