A yellow-pigmented, Gram-staining-negative, aerobic, non-motile, moderately thermophilic, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain CC-HSB-11(T), was isolated from a coastal hot spring of Green Island (Lutao), located off Taituang, Taiwan. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis demonstrated that it shared <94.4 % sequence similarity with Muricauda species. Menaquinone with six isoprene units (MK-6) was the major respiratory quinone and iso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(15 : 1) G, iso-C(15 : 0) 3-OH, iso-C(16 : 0) 3-OH, iso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH and summed feature 3 (comprising iso-C(15 : 0) 2-OH and/or C(16 : 1)omega7c/t) were the predominant fatty acids. The predominant polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. Six unidentified phospholipids and glycolipids also occurred as minor components. The DNA G+C content of strain CC-HSB-11(T) was 46.4+/-1 mol%. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities with other Muricauda species and differentiating fatty acid compositions and other phenotypic data, strain CC-HSB-11(T) represents a novel species in the genus Muricauda, for which the name Muricauda lutaonensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CC-HSB-11(T) (=BCRC 17850(T) =KCTC 22339(T)).
