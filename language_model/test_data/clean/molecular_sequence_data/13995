The smooth muscle tropomyosin isoforms beta and gamma were isolated in pure form and labeled with N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide (PIA) on the cysteine residues at either the N- or the C-terminal region (Cys-36 and Cys-190 of beta- and gamma-isoforms, respectively). The effect of caldesmon (CaD) on local conformational changes in different regions of the tropomyosin molecule was determined on the basis of changes in the excimer fluorescence (excited dimer of pyrene) formed in homodimers of tropomyosin isoforms. In the absence of actin, excimer fluorescence from the pyrene at Cys-190 of gamma-tropomyosin homodimer decreased in a simple manner on the addition of CaD, whereas the excimer from the Cys-36 of beta-tropomyosin homodimer exhibited a biphasic change, suggesting that additional weak binding sites exist near Cys-36. In the presence of actin, CaD-induced changes in the excimer fluorescence of pyrene-tropomyosin were observed only with Cys-36, and this change was associated with an inhibition of actin-activated myosin ATPase. A competition study with unlabeled tropomyosin isoforms indicated that the different excimer changes exhibited by beta- and gamma-tropomyosin in the presence of CaD were due to conformational changes in different regions of the tropomyosin molecule and not to differences in their affinities for CaD. Experiments with recombinant CaD mutants derived using the baculovirus expression system showed that the inhibition of tropomyosin potentiation of actomyosin ATPase by CaD requires the regions between residues 728-756 and 718-727 on the CaD molecule, although the latter region was sufficient for direct interaction with tropomyosin.
