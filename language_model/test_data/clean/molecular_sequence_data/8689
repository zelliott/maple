Two synthetic peptides 31 and 32 amino acids in length were prepared as deduced from a known amino acid sequence of penicillin-binding protein 2' (PBP2') of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Two monoclonal antibodies were generated from fused cells of myeloma cells and splenic cells of mice immunized with the synthetic peptides. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis demonstrated specific binding of the antibodies to PBP2' of a methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain. An immunoradiometric assay was developed by using these antibodies for simple detection of PBP2'.
