Capillary RPLC/ESI-MS (cRPLC/ESI-MS) is one of the most powerful analytical tools for current proteomic research. The development of cRPLC techniques coupled online to a mass spectrometer has focused on increasing the separation efficiency, detection sensitivity, and throughput. Recently, the use of high-pressure (over 10,000 psi) LC systems that utilize long, small inner diameter capillary columns has gained much attention for proteomic analyses. In this study, we developed an ultrahigh-pressure dual online SPE/capillary RPLC (DO-SPE/cRPLC) system. This LC system employs two online SPE columns and two capillary columns (75 microm inner diameter x 1 m length) in a single separation system, and has a maximum operating pressure of 10,000 psi. This DO-SPE/cRPLC system is capable of providing high-resolution separation in addition to several other advantageous features, such as high reproducibility in terms of the LC retention time, rapid sample injection, online desalting, online sample enrichment of dilute samples, and increased throughput as a result of essentially removing the column equilibration time between successive experiments. We coupled the DO-SPE/cRPLC system online to a tandem mass spectrometer to allow high-throughput proteomic analyses. In this paper, we demonstrate the efficiency of this DO-SPE/cRPLC/MS/MS system by its use in the analyses of proteomic samples exhibiting different levels of complexity.
