High field 1H-NMR studies of a synthetic 21-mer RNA fragment, corresponding to residues +114 to +134 within the trp leader mRNA transcript, have been carried out. Seven well resolved imino proton resonances corresponding to six C-G and one A-U hydrogen bonded base pairs, together with their characteristic NOE patterns can be identified in the NMR spectrum. This experimental result provides direct evidence for the postulated stem-loop secondary structure, 3:4, which has been reported to act as a transcription termination signal for RNA polymerase.
