In this study, a novel single universal primer multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (SUP-MLPA) technique that uses only one universal primer to perform multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed. Two reversely complementary common sequences were designed on the 5' or 3' end of the ligation probes (LPs), which allowed the ligation products to be amplified through only a single universal primer (SUP). SUP-MLPA products were analyzed on sequencing gel electrophoresis with extraordinary resolution. This method avoided the high expenses associated with capillary electrophoresis, which was the commonly used detection instrument. In comparison with conventional multiplex PCR, which suffers from low sensitivity, nonspecificity, and amplification disparity, SUP-MLPA had higher specificity and sensitivity and a low detection limit of 0.1 ng for detecting single crop species when screening the presence of genetically modified crops. We also studied the effect of different lengths of stuffer sequences on the probes for the first time. Through comparing the results of quantitative PCR, the LPs with different stuffer sequences did not affect the ligation efficiency, which further increased the multiplicity of this assay. The improved SUP-MLPA and sequencing gel electrophoresis method will be useful for food and animal feed identification, bacterial detection, and verification of genetic modification status of crops.
