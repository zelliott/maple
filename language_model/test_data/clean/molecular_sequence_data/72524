Mice whose IgH alleles are engineered to encode two distinct antibody heavy (H) chains generate a normal-sized B cell compartment in which most cells stably express the two heavy chains. This demonstrates that "toxicity" of bi-allelic H chain expression and cell-autonomous mechanisms of silencing in-frame IgH gene rearrangements do not significantly contribute to allelic exclusion at the IgH locus. Notwithstanding, the stability of the various engineered IgH loci during B cell development in the bone marrow differed substantially from each other.
