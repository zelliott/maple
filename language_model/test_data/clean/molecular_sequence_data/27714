The structure of the gene for a small, very basic ribosomal protein in Sulfolobus solfataricus has been determined and the structure of the protein coded by this gene (L46e) has been confirmed by partial amino acid sequencing. The protein shows substantial sequence homology to the eukaryotic ribosomal proteins L39 in rat and L46 in yeast. There is no sequence homology to any of the eubacterial ribosomal proteins suggesting that this protein is absent in the eubacterial ribosome.
