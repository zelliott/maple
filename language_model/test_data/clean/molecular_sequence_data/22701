In yeast and mammalian systems, it is well established that transcriptional down-regulation by DNA-binding repressors involves core histone deacetylation, mediated by their interaction within a complex containing histone deacetylase (e.g. HDA1), as well as various other proteins (e.g. SIN3, SAP18, SAP30, and RbAp46). Here we identify that a Arabidopsis thaliana gene related in sequence to SAP18, designated AtSAP18, functions in transcription regulation in plants subjected to salt stress. The AtSAP18 loss- of-function mutant is more sensitive to NaCl, and is impaired in chlorophyll synthesis as compared to the wild-type. Using GST pull-down, two-hybrid, and transient transcription assays, we have characterized SAP18 and HDA1 orthologues and provide evidence that SAP18 and HDA1 function as transcriptional repressors. We further demonstrate that they associate with Ethylene-Responsive Element binding Factors (ERFs) to create a hormone-sensitive multimeric repressor complex under conditions of environmental stress. Our results indicate that AtSAP18 functions to link the HDA complex to transcriptional repressors that are bound to chromatin in a sequence-specific manner, thereby providing the specificity of signal transduction accompanying transcriptional repression under stress conditions.
