Six cDNAs representing unique cold-induced sequences have been cloned from the hardy citrus relative Poncirus trifoliata. Among these, pBCORc115 and pBCORc119 were found to belong to the same gene family. Sequencing data indicated that pBCORc115 and pBCORc119 each contained an open reading frame, coding for a 19.8 kDa protein (COR19) and a smaller 11.4 kDa protein (COR11) respectively. Inspection of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed three large repeats in COR19, but only one was present in the COR11. Two elements: a Q-clustered tract and a K-rich motif were identified in each repeat. The K-rich motifs were similar to those of cotton D-11 and Group 2 LEA proteins. A Serine-cluster, a common feature in many Group 2 LEA-like proteins, was also found in these proteins, but it was in an unusual position at the carboxy-terminus. A bipartite motif of basic residues, similar to known nuclear targeting sequences, was also present in COR19 and COR11, suggesting that members of this protein family may have a nuclear targeting function. The expression of COR19 mRNA in response to cold acclimation, drought, flooding, and salinization was examined. COR19 expression in leaf tissue was induced in response to cold acclimation, but repressed during drought and flooding stress.
