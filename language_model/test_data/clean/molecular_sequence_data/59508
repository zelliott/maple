Herpesviruses have acquired a variety of different mechanisms to avoid the damaging effects of host immunity. Frequently, these viruses subvert normal immune regulatory functions utilized by the host. The focus of this review is upon herpesvirus genes encoding known or potential immunomodulatory proteins. Areas covered include inhibition of complement and antibody function, herpesvirus-encoded homologues of cytokines and chemokine receptors, and potential disruption of cellular recognition of virally infected targets.
