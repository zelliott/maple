The discovery of non-universal genetic codes in several mitochondria and nuclear systems during the part ten years has necessitated a reconsideration of the concept that the genetic code is universal and frozen, as was once believed. Here, the flexibility of the relationship between codons and amino acids is discussed on the basis of the distribution of non-universal genetic codes in various organisms insofar as has been observed to date. Judging from the result of recent investigations into tRNA identity, it would appear that the non-participation of the anticodon in recognition by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase has significantly influenced the variability of codons.
