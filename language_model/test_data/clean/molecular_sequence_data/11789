We report the nucleotide sequence of a 32.8 kb DNA segment from the right arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome IV. The sequence contains 20 open reading frames (ORFs) longer than 300 bp as well as the 240 bp gene coding for the essential SSS1 secretory protein. Nine ORFs previously totally or partially sequenced (TPS2, PPH3, RAD55, SED1, PDC2, AFR1, SSS1, SLU7 and D4478) are presented, as well as the transmembrane protein D4405, the leucine zipper containing D4495 and a new tRNA for arginine. D4456 and D4461 are separated by a single in-frame stop codon only. The other five ORFs show no particular features or significant homology.
