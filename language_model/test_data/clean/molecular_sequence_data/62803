Most cis-acting regulatory elements have generally been assumed to activate a single nearby gene. However, many genes are clustered together, raising the possibility that they are regulated through a common element. We show here that a single peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE), located between the mouse PEX11 alpha and perilipin genes, confers on both genes activation by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) and PPAR gamma. A functional PPRE 8.4 kb downstream of the promoter of PEX11 alpha, a PPAR alpha target gene, was identified by a gene transfection study. This PPRE was positioned 1.9 kb upstream of the perilipin gene and also functioned with the perilipin promoter. In addition, this PPRE, when combined with the natural promoters of the PEX11 alpha and perilipin genes, conferred subtype-selective activation by PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma 2. The PPRE sequence specifically bound to the heterodimer of RXR alpha and PPAR alpha or PPAR gamma 2, as assessed by electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays. Furthermore, tissue-selective binding of PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma to the PPRE was demonstrated in hepatocytes and adipocytes, respectively, by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Hence, the expression of these genes is induced through the same PPRE in the liver and adipose tissue, where the two PPAR subtypes are specifically expressed.
