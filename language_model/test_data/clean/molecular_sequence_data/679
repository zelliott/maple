We developed a metal ion chelate-assisted ligation for SNP detection by microarray. An oligonucleotide probe was separated into two 9-10-mers bearing iminodiacetic residues at the gap point. Duplex formation with the DNA target was possible only if nickel ions were added, but a nucleotide substitution opposite the gap point prevented duplex formation. Here we demonstrate the application of this approach for SNP detection (A1298C) within the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene on a microarray.
