We employed matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry (LD-MS) to detect recombinant bovine growth hormone (r-bGH) in sustained-release preparations. After preliminary extraction in phosphate buffer, LD-MS provided a precise determination of the molecular mass (M(r)) of the r-bGH contained in 38 sustained-release preparations. The hormone was characterised using enzyme immunoassay, immunoblotting and amino acid sequencing. Rapid detection is essential for analysing large numbers of samples, and for monitoring the use of r-bGH in zootechnical productions and its administration as a "high-tech" drug for therapeutic purposes.
