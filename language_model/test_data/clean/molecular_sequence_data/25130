A 21-mer DNA oligonucleotide probe targeting the 23S rRNA of Mycobacterium leprae was developed and its high specificity demonstrated by dot-blot hybridization. Even under relaxed hybridization and washing conditions (20 degrees C below Tm) the probe was highly selective in that positive signals were only detected with M. leprae, about half of the slow-growing and one of the fast-growing reference mycobacteria and Gordona bronchialis. At more stringent washing temperatures (6 degrees C below Tm) only the rRNA of Mycobacterium leprae was detectable.
