Studies by Urbanowski et al. [Urbanowski, M. L., Stauffer, L. T., Plamann, L. S. & Stauffer, G. V. (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169, 1391-1397] have identified a regulatory locus, called metR, required for the expression of the metE and metH genes. We recently purified the MetR protein from Escherichia coli and showed that it could stimulate the in vitro expression of the metE gene and autoregulate its own synthesis. In the present study, the purified MetR protein has been shown to stimulate the in vitro expression of the metH gene. Also, the in vitro synthesized MetE, MetH, and MetR proteins were shown to be biologically active. The transcription start sites for the metE and metR genes have been determined, and DNA footprinting experiments have identified regions in the metE-metR intergenic sequence that are protected by either the MetR or MetJ proteins.
