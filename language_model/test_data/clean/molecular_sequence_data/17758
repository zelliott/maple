The presented software package allows: 1) to input and edit amino acid sequences; 2) to list aligned amino acid sequences of homologous proteins; 3) pairwise comparison of homologous sequences; 4) construction of phylogenetic trees; 5) comparison of two groups of protein sequences from the same family of homologous proteins; 6) graphic identification of conservative and variable regions of homologous sequences. The stepwise application of the programs allows to study the process of amino acid replacement accumulation during certain intervals of species evolution.
