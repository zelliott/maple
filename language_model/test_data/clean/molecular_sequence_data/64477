This study established the utility of cross-species application of the cDNA microarray technique for investigating differential gene expression. Using both total RNA and mRNA samples recovered from two opossum cell lines derived from UVB-induced melanoma, we analyzed expression of ca. 4400 genes on the human DermArray DNA microarrays. The signals generated on the DermArrays were clear, strong, and reproducible. A cDNA dot blot consisting of differentially expressed genes representative of different functional clusters was used to validate the DermArray results. We also cloned a Monodelphis gene, keratin 18 (KRT18), and characterized its expression patterns in tumor samples of different progression stages. Up-regulated expression was observed for the KRT18 gene in advanced melanomas, a finding consistent with the DermArray analysis. These results provide evidence that cross-species application of cDNA microarrays is a useful strategy for investigating gene expression patterns in animal models for which species-specific cDNA microarrays are not available.
