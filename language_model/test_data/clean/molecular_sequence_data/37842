Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) is an actin-regulating protein that induces filopodium formation downstream of Cdc42. It has been shown that filopodia actively extend from the growth cone, a guidance apparatus located at the tip of neurites, suggesting their role in neurite extension. Here we examined the possible involvement of N-WASP in the neurite extension process. Since verprolin, cofilin homology and acidic region (VCA) of N-WASP is known to be required for the activation of Arp2/3 complex that induces actin polymerization, we prepared a mutant (Deltacof) lacking four amino acid residues in the cofilin homology region. The corresponding residues in WASP had been reported to be mutated in some Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients. Expression of Deltacof N-WASP suppressed neurite extension of PC12 cells. In support of this, the VCA region of Deltacof cannot activate Arp2/3 complex enough compared with wild-type VCA. Furthermore, H208D mutant, which has been shown unable to bind to Cdc42, also works as a dominant negative mutant in neurite extension assay. Interestingly, the expression of H208D-Deltacof double mutant has no significant dominant negative effect. Finally, the expression of the Deltacof mutant also severely inhibited the neurite extension of primary neurons from rat hippocampus. Thus, N-WASP is thought to be a general regulator of the actin cytoskeleton indispensable for neurite extension, which is probably caused through Cdc42 signaling and Arp2/3 complex-induced actin polymerization.
