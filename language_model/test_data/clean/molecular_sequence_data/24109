Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is a powerful approach for visualizing RNA folding states and folding intermediates. Tris-borate has a high-buffering capacity and is therefore widely used in electrophoresis-based investigations of RNA structure and folding. However, the effectiveness of Tris-borate as a counterion for RNA has not been systematically investigated. In a recirculated Hepes/KCl buffer, the catalytic core of the bI5 group I intron RNA undergoes a conformational collapse characterized by a bulk transition midpoint, or Mg1/2, of approximately 3 mM, consistent with extensive independent biochemical experiments. In contrast, in Tris-borate, RNA collapse has a much smaller apparent Mg1/2, equal to 0.1 mM, because in this buffer the RNA undergoes a different, large amplitude, folding transition at low Mg2+ concentrations. Analysis of structural neighbors using a short-lived, RNA-tethered, photocrosslinker indicates that the global RNA structure eventually converges in the two buffer systems, as the divalent ion concentration approaches approximately 1 mM Mg2+. The weak capacity of Tris-borate to stabilize RNA folding may reflect relatively unfavorable interactions between the bulky Tris-borate ion and RNA or partial coordination of RNA functional groups by borate. Under some conditions, Tris-borate is a poor counterion for RNA and its use merits careful evaluation in RNA folding studies.
