The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Solen grandis that lives in sub-tidal waters and being buried in muddy to fine sand substrates, is described in this paper. The mitogenome (16,794Â bp) consists of 12 protein-coding genes (loss of ATPase subunit 8), 22 tRNA genes, 2 rRNA genes and 1 putative control region. It is the typical bivalve mitochondrial gene composition.
