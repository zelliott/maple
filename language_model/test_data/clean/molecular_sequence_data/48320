Among hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections diagnosed in 2011 by the French Reference Centre for HEV, 9 were due to genotype 4, which until recently was limited to Asia. Sequences from autochthonous cases formed a single cluster very similar to Belgian swine sequences. Clinical presentation differed from genotype 3 infections.
