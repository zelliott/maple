During the course of the last decade, the development of SBIs, and particularly sterol biomethylation inhibitors, has been based on the rational design approach. Successful though this approach has been in elucidating sterol biomethylation enzymology, its limitations are becoming apparent from the findings that: (i) 24,25-double bond metabolism gives rise to cholesterol and ergosterol in a mechanistically similar manner, (ii) 25-azasterols are harmful to human physiology, and (iii) side-chain modified sterols designed to inhibit the SMT enzyme in S. cerevisiae may be ineffective or operate by another kinetic mechanism in a related organism, rendering it therapeutically nonuseful. Nevertheless, it may be possible to ultimately capitalize on the unique aspects of sterol biomethylation chemistry and enzymology to design taxa-specific inhibitors. With increased understanding of the structure and function of SMT enzymes in different fungi, it should be possible to prepare novel mechanism-based inactivators to control SMT activity uniquely and with high specific activity.
