X-ray and NMR experiments were performed with simple chitosan models based on glucosamine monosaccharides and disaccharides to understand the binding properties and structures of the complexes formed between this polysaccharide and platinum(II) metals. Subjection of the glucosamine derivatives with [PdCl2(PhCN)2] provided trans-diamine complexes which upon further treatment with excess (NH4)PF6 generated complexes possessing two 5-membered chelate rings involving the C2-amine and the C3-hydroxyl group of the two individual glucosamine units.
