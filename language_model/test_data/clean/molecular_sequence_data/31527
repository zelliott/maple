Nonnative viral glycoproteins, including Friend murine leukemia virus envelope (F-MLV Env) are actively recruited to HIV-1 assembly sites by an unknown mechanism. Because interactions with the lipid microenvironment at budding sites could contribute to recruitment, we examined the contribution of the hydrophobicity of the F-MLV Env membrane-spanning domain (MSD) to its incorporation into HIV-1 particles. A series of F-MLV Env mutants that added or deleted one, two, or three leucines in the MSD were constructed. All six mutants retained the ability to be incorporated into HIV-1 particles, but the -1L, -2L, -3L, +1L, and +2L mutants were not capable of producing infectious particles. Surprisingly, the +3L Env glycoprotein was able to produce infectious particles and was constitutively fusogenic. However, when the cytoplasmic tail domains (CTDs) in the Env constructs were deleted, all six of the MSD mutants were able to produce infectious particles. Further mutational analyses revealed that the first 10 amino acids of the CTD is a critical regulator of infectivity. A similar phenotype was observed in HIV-1 Env upon addition of leucines in the MSD, with +1 and +2 leucine mutations greatly reducing Env activity, but +3 leucine mutations behaving similar to the wild type. Unlike F-MLV Env (+1L and +2L), HIV-1 Env (+1L and +2L) infectivity was not restored by deletion of the CTD. We hypothesize that the CTD forms a coiled-coil that disrupts the protein's functionality if it is not in phase with the trimer interface of the ectodomain.
