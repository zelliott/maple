Recent studies provide evidence that Sox4 is involved in regulating apoptosis as well as tumorigenesis of various human cancers; however, its role in the apoptotic machinery is not fully understood. Here we describe that the central domain containing glycine-rich region in Sox4, named CD, is a pivotal pro-apoptotic domain to induce apoptotic cell death. Deletion of the DNA-binding domain or trans-activation domain in Sox4 did not significantly affect pro-apoptotic activity, whereas transient transfection of the high mobility group box or the serine-rich region abrogated the apoptotic activity. Moreover, overexpression of the CD construct (aa 166-342) revealed the apoptotic activity comparable to that of wild-type Sox4, approximately 60% of cell death. Our data suggest that the apoptotic activity of Sox4 can be dissociated from its transcriptional trans-activation and is mediated through its CD.
