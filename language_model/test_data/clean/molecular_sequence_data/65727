Symbiotic bacteria residing in the hindgut chambers of scarab beetle larvae may be useful in paratransgenic approaches to reduce larval root-feeding activities on agricultural crops. We compared the bacterial community profiles associated with the hindgut walls of individual Dermolepida albohirtum third-instar larvae over 2 years and those associated with their plant root food source among different geographic regions. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis was used with universal and Actinobacteria-specific 16S rRNA primers to reveal a number of taxa that were found consistently in all D. albohirtum larvae but not in samples from their food source, sugarcane roots. These taxa included representatives from the "Endomicrobia," Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria and were related to previously described bacteria from the intestines of other scarab larvae and termites. These universally distributed taxa have the potential to form vertically transmitted symbiotic associations with these insects.
