Sponges (Porifera) are the phylogenetically oldest still extant metazoan phylum. Recently elements of their immune system have been cloned and analyzed, primarily from the demosponges Suberites domuncula and Geodia cydonium. By differential display, two genes were identified in S. domuncula, whose translation products are involved in graft rejection/fusion: the allograft inflammatory factor (AIF-1) and the Tcf-like transcription factor (TCF). Since the AIF-1 and TCF genes are upregulated in vivo after tissue transplantation, especially in allografts, we investigated whether this reaction can be monitored in vitro. Therefore, the autogeneic and the allogeneic mixed sponge cell reaction (MSCR) system was applied for the first time to identify distinct factors in sponges in vitro. The results confirm that the two AIF-1 and TCF genes are induced during allogeneic MSCR. Furthermore, the recombinant sponge AIF-1 causes an upregulation of the expression of the TCF. We conclude that the AIF-1 and TCF genes are upregulated in sponges during histoincompatibility reactions; the data support the view that sponges have immune systems composed of highly complex elements related to those found in mammalian systems.
