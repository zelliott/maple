GV1B is one of five viroids that have recently been purified from grapevines. GV1B has now been sequenced and its 363 nucleotide residues can potentially form the typical rod-like structure of viroids with 67% of nucleotides base-paired. GV1B has highest sequence similarity with grapevine yellow speckle viroid (GYSV; 73%) and has a central sequence which is conserved in GYSV and apple scar skin viroid (ASSV) which have been reported to constitute the ASSV group. Therefore, we have placed GV1B into the ASSV group. GV1B contains a direct repeat sequence at the terminal portions of its T1 and T2 regions. GV1B also contains a sequence of 69 nucleotides in the terminal portion of its T1 region which is almost identical to the corresponding region in tomato planta macho viroid (TPMV). This provides further evidence of the importance of RNA recombination in viroid evolution.
