Relationship among the mahseer species (Family: Cyprinidae) has long been debated in fish systematics. Present study concentrates on the nature of the phylogenetic relationship among the five mahseer species using the sequence of major ribosomal DNA (45S rDNA). We have covered rDNA sequence of approximately 5.2 kb per individual, 26.0 kb per species and 130.0 kb as a whole. We also characterized the 45S and 5S rDNA regions with respect to their nucleotide composition. For phylogenetic analyses, nucleotide sequences were divided into four datasets. First and second datasets contained 18S rDNA and ITS1 sequence, whereas third and fourth datasets consisted of ITS2 and complete 18S-ITS1-5.8S-ITS2-28S, respectively. The NJ tree was constructed for all the datasets. The mahseer species under study formed a monophyletic group well separated from the outgroup species. Similarly, the individuals of Neolissochilus hexagonolepis form monophyletic group with Tor species, indicating Neolissochilus as a sister genus of Tor. The findings from the present study provide greater insights into taxonomic status of mahseer, and set the stage for future investigations dealing with phylo-geography, taxonomy, conservation and co-evolution within this interesting and important group of fish.
