We have performed a differential screen of a Xenopus egg cDNA library and selected two clones (Cl1 and Cl2) corresponding to mRNA which are specifically adenylated and recruited into polysomes after fertilization. Sequence analysis of Cl1 reveals that the corresponding protein is 67.5% identical (83% similar) to the product of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SUP45 (also called SUP1 or SAL4) gene. This gene, when mutated, is an omnipotent suppressor of nonsense codons. When expressed in a sup45 mutant, the Xenopus Cl1 cDNA was able to suppress sup45-related phenotypes, showing that the structural homology reflects a functional homology. Our discovery of a structural and functional homolog in Xenopus cells implies that the function of SUP45 is not restricted to lower eukaryotes and that the SUP45 protein may perform a crucial cellular function in higher eukaryotes.
