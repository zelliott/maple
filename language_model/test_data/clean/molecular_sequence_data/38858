The control of equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) infections of horses has been over the past 20 years based primarily on the identification and elimination of seropositive horses, predominantly by a standardized agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) assay in centralized reference laboratories. This screening for EIAV-seropositive horses has been to date hindered by the lack of a rapid diagnostic format that can be easily employed in the field. We describe here the development of a rapid solution-phase assay for the presence of serum antibodies to EIAV based on fluorescence polarization (FP) (patent pending). Peptides derived from antigenic regions of EIAV core and envelope proteins were initially screened for their utility as probes in an FP assay to select the best peptide antigen candidates. The FP assay was optimized to detect the presence of EIAV-specific antibodies by a change in the FP of a fluorescein-labeled immunoreactive peptide diagnostic antigen. The most sensitive and specific peptide probe was a peptide corresponding to the immunodominant region of the EIAV transmembrane protein, gp45. This probe was tested for its reactivity in the optimized FP assay with 151 AGID-positive horse sera and 106 AGID-negative serum samples. The results of these studies demonstrated that the FP assay reactivity correlated with reported AGID results in 106 of 106 negative serum samples (100% specificity) and in 135 of 151 positive serum samples (89.4% sensitivity). The FP assay was also found to have a very low background reactivity and to readily detect antibodies produced early in infection (</=3 weeks postinfection). The developed EIAV FP assay is rapid (5 to 20 min) and simple to perform and is equally suitable for use both in the field and in the diagnostic laboratory, thus providing the basis of an improved commercial diagnostic assay for EIAV infection of horses.
