Helicobacter pylori babA encodes an outer membrane protein that binds to fucosylated Lewis b blood group antigen. We analyzed a panel of 35 H. pylori strains and identified three possible chromosomal loci for babA. There was a significant association between the presence of babA and the presence of cagA (P = 0.0001). Phylogenetic analysis of babA alleles revealed two divergent families of signal sequences. Among 17 strains in which an intact in-frame babA allele was identified, 10 expressed a detectable BabA protein. Expression of a BabA protein and the Lewis b-binding phenotype were not dependent on the chromosomal locus of babA. These data indicate that there is marked heterogeneity among H. pylori strains in babA genetic content and BabA expression.
