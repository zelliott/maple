Expansins are a family of proteins that catalyze long-term extension of isolated cell walls. Previously, two expansin proteins have been isolated from internodes of deepwater rice, and three rice expansin genes, Os-EXP1, Os-EXP2, and Os-EXP3, have been identified. We report here on the identification of a fourth rice expansin gene, Os-EXP4, and on the expression pattern of the rice expansin gene family in deepwater rice. Rice expansin genes show organ-specific differential expression in the coleoptile, root, leaf, and internode. In these organs, there is increased expression of Os-EXP1, Os-EXP3, and Os-EXP4 in developmental regions where elongation occurs. This pattern of gene expression is also correlated with acid-induced in vitro cell wall extensibility. Submergence and treatment with gibberellin, both of which promote rapid internodal elongation, induced accumulation of Os-EXP4 mRNA before the rate of growth started to increase. Our results indicate that the expression of expansin genes in deepwater rice is differentially regulated by developmental, hormonal, and environmental signals and is correlated with cell elongation.
