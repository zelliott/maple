Through large-scale DNA sequencing of a genomic region on chromosome 3p22-p21.3, we isolated a novel gene encoding a 527-amino-acid protein. Its 18 exons spanned a genomic region of about 90 kilobases, and the 4536-nucleotide cDNA contained an open reading frame of 1581 base pairs. The gene was expressed in all 16 human tissues examined by Northern blotting. The amino acid sequence of the predicted protein was 39% identical to that of human SOK1 (Ste20/oxidant stress response kinase-1), a molecule that is activated by oxidative stress. In view of its significant similarity to SOK1, we suspect that the novel gene, which we named OSR1, is a member of the SOK family of kinases in terms of function.
