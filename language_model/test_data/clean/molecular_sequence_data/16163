We measured the binding of yeast heat shock factor (HSF) to DNA in vivo by using an interference assay in which HSF excludes GAL4 from a synthetic promoter element containing overlapping binding sites for each protein. The results show that HSF binds to DNA in unstressed cells and that binding is not sufficient for transcriptional activation.
