A bacterial isolate obtained from soil from a municipal landfill site in India was characterized using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. The colonies of the isolate were found to be yellow and highly mucoid. Comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that this isolate constitutes a distinct phyletic line within the genus Lysobacter, displaying >3 % sequence divergence with respect to recognized Lysobacter species. The generic assignment was confirmed by chemotaxonomic data, which revealed the presence of a fatty acid profile characteristic of members of the genus Lysobacter and consisting of saturated, unsaturated, straight-chain and branched-chain fatty acids as well as iso-C(11 : 0) 3-OH as hydroxylated fatty acid, and the presence of an ubiquinone with eight isoprene units (Q-8) as the predominant respiratory quinone. The genotypic and phenotypic data show that strain IMMIB APB-9(T) merits classification as representing a novel species of the genus Lysobacter, for which the name Lysobacter defluvii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IMMIB APB-9(T) (=CCUG 53152(T)=DSM 18482(T)).
