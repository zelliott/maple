Trypanosoma cruzi expresses a set of glycoproteins encoded by the gp85/trans-sialidase gene superfamily. In this report a structure model is proposed for a cloned member of the superfamily, the Tc85-11 protein. The structure consists of an N-terminus beta-propeller and a C-terminus beta-sandwich interconnected by an alpha-helix. The recombinant protein, corresponding to the N-domain (Tc85-N), binds to laminin in a selective manner. Six synthetic 20-mer peptides from the N-domain adhere onto the surface of LLC-MK(2) cells and two of these peptides specifically inhibit the Tc85-N/laminin interaction, indicating that they are the laminin-binding sites of the molecule. Thus, Tc85-11 and other related members of the family appear to be good candidates to play an important role in T. cruzi infection via a laminin mediated host-parasite interaction.
