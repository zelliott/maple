We have identified an active Medicago truncatula copia-like retroelement called Medicago RetroElement1-1 (MERE1-1) as an insertion in the symbiotic NSP2 gene. MERE1-1 belongs to a low-copy-number family in the sequenced Medicago genome. These copies are highly related, but only three of them have a complete coding region and polymorphism exists between the long terminal repeats of these different copies. This retroelement family is present in all M. truncatula ecotypes tested but also in other legume species like Lotus japonicus. It is active only during tissue culture in both R108 and Jemalong Medicago accessions and inserts preferentially in genes.
