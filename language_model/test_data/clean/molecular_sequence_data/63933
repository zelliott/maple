We examined the transglycosylation reaction by the recombinant endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Mucor hiemalis (Endo-M) expressed in Candida boidinii in media containing organic solvents. The recombinant Endo-M could transglycosylate a disialo biantennary complex-type oligosaccharide from hen egg yolk glycopeptide to p-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide even in the presence of 30% acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide, or methanol. The yield of the transglycosylation product reached 21-34% of the total amount of acceptor, while the yield was only about 14% in aqueous solution.
