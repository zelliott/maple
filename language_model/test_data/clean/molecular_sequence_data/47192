PRL-like protein C variant (PLP-Cv) is a newly identified member of the PRL family. PLP-Cv is specifically expressed in the chorioallantoic placenta by two distinct cell populations: trophoblast giant cells and spongiotrophoblast cells. To gain some insight regarding the control of PLP-Cv gene expression and the regulatory factors controlling trophoblast giant cell and spongiotrophoblast cell lineages, we have initiated a structural and functional analysis of the PLP-Cv promoter. The activities of a series of PLP-Cv promoter constructs, ranging in size from 4.5 kb to 50 bp, ligated to a luciferase reporter have been assessed in the Rcho-1 trophoblast cell line (restricted to trophoblast giant cell differentiation) and in a primary spongiotrophoblast cell culture system after transient transfection. PLP-Cv promoter constructs containing 4.5 kb to 149 bp of 5'-flanking DNA possessed full activity in the trophoblast giant cell model. A region located between -149 and -124 bp upstream of the PLP-Cv transcription start site was found to be essential for activation of the PLP-Cv promoter. Spongiotrophoblast cells required additional PLP-Cv 5'-flanking DNA for full activity. A region located between -2518 and -2242 bp upstream of the PLP-Cv transcription start site significantly enhanced PLP-Cv promoter in spongiotrophoblast cells. In conclusion, mechanisms underlying the activation of the PLP-Cv promoter are different in trophoblast giant cells vs. spongiotrophoblast cells.
