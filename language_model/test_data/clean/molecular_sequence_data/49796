The human blood group i and I antigens are determined by linear and branched poly-N-acetyllactosamine structures, respectively. In erythrocytes, the fetal i antigen is converted to the adult I antigen by I-branching beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (IGnT) during development. Dysfunction of the I-branching enzyme may result in the adult i phenotype in erythrocytes. However, the I gene responsible for blood group I antigen has not been fully confirmed. We report here a novel human I-branching enzyme, designated IGnT3. The genes for IGnT1 (reported in 1993), IGnT2 (also presented in this study), and IGnT3 consist of 3 exons and share the second and third exons. Bone marrow cells preferentially expressed IGnT3 transcript. During erythroid differentiation using CD34(+) cells, IGnT3 was markedly up-regulated with concomitant decrease in IGnT1/2. Moreover, reticulocytes expressed the IGnT3 transcript, but IGnT1/2 was below detectable levels. By molecular genetic analyses of an adult i pedigree, individuals with the adult i phenotype were revealed to have heterozygous alleles with mutations in exon 2 (1006G>A; Gly336Arg) and exon 3 (1049G>A; Gly350Glu), respectively, of the IGnT3 gene. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with each mutated IGnT3 cDNA failed to express I antigen. These findings indicate that the expression of the blood group I antigen in erythrocytes is determined by a novel IGnT3, not by IGnT1 or IGnT2.
