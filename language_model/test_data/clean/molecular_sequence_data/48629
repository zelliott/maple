To sequence and analyze the full-length gene sequence of rabies vaccine virus aG strain. The full-length gene sequence of aG strain was amplified by RT-PCR by 8 fragments,each PCR product was cloned into vector pGEM-T respectively, sequenced and assemblied; The 5' leader sequence was sequenced with method of 5' RACE. The homology between aG and other rabies vaccine virus was analyzed by using DNAstar and Mega4. 0 software. aG strain was 11 925nt(GenBank accession number: JN234411) in length and belonged to the genotype I . The Bioinformatics revealed that the homology showed disparation form different rabies vaccine virus. the full-length gene sequence of rabies vaccine virus aG strain provided a support for perfecting the standard for quality control of virus strains for production of rabies vaccine for human use in China.
