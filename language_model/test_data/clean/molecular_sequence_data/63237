We had been unsuccessful to amplify desired nucleotide sequences from various environmental DNA samples by using the inverse polymerase chain reaction (IPCR) technique, most probably because the copy numbers of target DNA sequences had been quite low. To enrich the target DNA sequences prior to IPCR, a rolling-circle amplification was used with a site-specific primer containing locked nucleic acids (LNAs). This pre-amplified IPCR (PAI-PCR) method increased the sensitivity of PCR almost 10,000 times compared with the standard IPCR in model experiments using Escherichia coli. We then applied the PAI-PCR method to isolate glycosyl hydrolase genes from DNAs extracted from vermiform appendixes of horses and termite guts. The flanking sequences of the target genes were amplified and cloned successfully using PAI-PCR, whereas standard IPCR resulted in no amplification.
