A novel flagellatropic phage of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, called iEPS5, was isolated and characterized. iEPS5 has an icosahedral head and a long noncontractile tail with a tail fiber. Genome sequencing revealed a double-stranded DNA of 59,254 bp having 73 open reading frames (ORFs). To identify the receptor for iEPS5, Tn5 transposon insertion mutants of S. Typhimurium SL1344 that were resistant to the phage were isolated. All of the phage-resistant mutants were found to have mutations in genes involved in flagellar formation, suggesting that the flagellum is the adsorption target of this phage. Analysis of phage infection using the ΔmotA mutant, which is flagellated but nonmotile, demonstrated the requirement of flagellar rotation for iEPS5 infection. Further analysis of phage infection using the ΔcheY mutant revealed that iEPS5 could infect host bacteria only when the flagellum is rotating counterclockwise (CCW). These results suggested that the CCW-rotating flagellar filament is essential for phage adsorption and required for successful infection by iEPS5. In contrast to the well-studied flagellatropic phage Chi, iEPS5 cannot infect the ΔfliK mutant that makes a polyhook without a flagellar filament, suggesting that these two flagellatropic phages utilize different infection mechanisms. Here, we present evidence that iEPS5 injects its DNA into the flagellar filament for infection by assessing DNA transfer from SYBR gold-labeled iEPS5 to the host bacteria.
