The taxonomic position of a staurosporine-producing actinomycete isolated from a hay meadow soil was determined using a polyphasic approach. The organism had chemical and morphological characteristics consistent with its classification in the genus Streptomyces and formed a distinct branch between the Streptomyces lydicus and Streptomyces noursei clades in the 16S rRNA Streptomyces gene tree. DNA-DNA relatedness values between the isolate and its nearest phylogenetic neighbours, namely Streptomyces lydicus NBRC 13058T and Streptomyces chattanoogensis NBRC 12754T, were 53 % and 40 %, respectively. The isolate was also readily distinguished from the type strains of these species using a combination of morphological and other phenotypic properties. On the basis of these results, it is proposed that isolate BK179T (=KACC 20912T=NRRL B-24850T) be classified as the type strain of Streptomyces staurosporininus sp. nov.
