A 32-33 bp highly repeated DNA sequence, TkS1, has been isolated from genomic DNA of the newt Triturus karelini digested with the restriction endonucleases HaeIII or AluI. TkS1 is known to be localised in the centromeric heterochromatin of all the chromosomes in T. karelini and the related species T. cristatus. TkS1 has been shown to be present in varying amounts in the genomic DNA of a range of species of Triturus, including representatives of the two main subgenera Triturus and Palaeotriton. A programme of sequencing of monomers, dimers and trimers of TkS1 was carried out in order to determine the level of conservation of the sequence within and between species of Triturus. Altogether 204 monomer (32/33 bp) clones were made of TkS1 from three individuals of T. karelini, and one individual each of T. cristatus, T. carnifex, T. dobrogicus and T. marmoratus, all members of the subgenus Triturus and the cristatus species group. A number of dimer (64 bp) and trimer (96 bp) clones were also made from DNA of a single specimen of T. karelini digested with HaeIII or AluI. Three distinct types of TkS1 were identified in all species examined, except for T. marmoratus where only two of the types were found. The types were distinguished on the basis of certain recurring divergent patterns in monomers sequenced from T. karelini. Type 1 is mainly characterised by the presence of an AluI site at positions 24-27 and type 3 mainly by the presence of an additional base (C) at position 14. Type 2 normally lacks the AluI site and the C at position 14, as well as having a number of other distinguishing features. TkS1 and its three types have remained remarkably constant in sequence since before the divergence of T. marmoratus from other species in the cristatus species group, about 10 million years ago. Examination of all 204 monomer clones and comparison with consensus sequences for the three types shows less than 5% divergence at any one position in the sequence. There is good evidence from examination of dimer and trimer clones of TkS1 that the different types are intermingled with each other, and all three types are likely to be present on all chromosomes. Dimeric (64 bp) TkS1 clones constructed from AluI fragments of T. karelini DNA show evidence of a trimeric (96 bp) "supertype" with the pattern type 1-type 3-type 1 that is much more common than would be expected on a random basis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
