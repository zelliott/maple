Poly(rC) binding protein 2 (PCBP2) forms a specific ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with the 5'-terminal sequences of poliovirus genomic RNA, as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Mutational analysis showed that binding requires the wild-type nucleotide sequence at positions 20-25. This sequence is predicted to localize to a specific stem-loop within a cloverleaf-like secondary structure element at the 5'-terminus of the viral RNA. Addition of purified poliovirus 3CD to the PCBP2/RNA binding reaction results in the formation of a ternary complex, whose electrophoretic mobility is further retarded. These properties are consistent with those described for the unidentified cellular protein in the RNP complex described by Andino et al. (Andino R, Rieckhof GE, Achacoso PL, Baltimore D, 1993, EMBO J 12:3587-3598). Dicistronic RNAs containing mutations in the 5' cloverleaf-like structure of poliovirus that abate PCBP2 binding show a decrease in RNA replication and translation of gene products directed by the poliovirus 5' noncoding region in vitro, suggesting that the interaction of PCBP2 with these sequences performs a dual role in the virus life cycle by facilitating both viral protein synthesis and initiation of viral RNA synthesis.
