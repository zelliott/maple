The replacement of M74 in GyrA, A83 in GyrA, and R447 in GyrB of Mycobacterium tuberculosis gyrase by their Escherichia coli homologs resulted in active enzymes as quinolone susceptible as the E. coli gyrase. This demonstrates that the primary structure of gyrase determines intrinsic quinolone resistance and was supported by a three-dimensional model of N-terminal GyrA.
