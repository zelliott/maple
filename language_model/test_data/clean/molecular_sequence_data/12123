A chimeric protein (rscu-PA-40-kDa/Hir), consisting of the C-terminal amino acids 53-65 of hirudin (Hir), fused via a 14-amino-acid linker sequence to the C-terminal of a 40-kDa fragment (Ser47-Leu411) of recombinant (r) single-chain (sc) urokinase-type plasminogen activator (rscu-PA), was produced by expression of the corresponding chimeric cDNA in Escherichia coli cells. The thrombin inhibitory potential of purified rscu-PA-40-kDa/Hir was confirmed by complete inhibition of the coagulant activity of thrombin at 20-30-fold molar excess of the chimera, and by the resistance of rscu-PA-40-kDa/Hir to proteolytic cleavage by thrombin, rscu-PA-40-kDa/Hir prolonged the thrombin time of normal human plasma in a dose-dependent way (reduction of the apparent thrombin concentration to 50% with 95 nM chimeric protein as compared to 4.7 nM hirudin), and inhibited thrombin-mediated platelet aggregation (reduction of the apparent thrombin concentration to 50% with 40 nM chimeric protein). The chimera had a specific activity on fibrin films of 57,000 IU/mg as compared to 95,000 IU/mg for rscu-PA. The urokinase-like amidolytic activity of the single-chain protein was only 220 IU/mg but increased to 169,000 IU/mg after treatment with plasmin, which resulted in quantitative conversion to a two-chain (tc) derivative (rtcu-PA-40-kDa/Hir). Corresponding values for rscu-PA were 270 and 226,000 IU/mg. The catalytic efficiencies for plasmin-mediated conversion to two-chain molecules were comparable for rscu-PA-40-kDa/Hir and rscu-PA (0.63 and 0.65 microM-1.s-1, respectively). The plasminogen-activating potential of the single-chain chimera was comparable to that of rscu-PA; the catalytic efficiencies for plasminogen activation by their two-chain counterparts were also similar (0.55 and 0.73 microM-1.s-1, respectively). In 2 h, 50% lysis of 125I-fibrin-labeled clots prepared from platelet-poor human plasma and immersed in normal plasma was obtained with 1.3 micrograms/ml rscu-PA-40-kDa/Hir and with 0.67 micrograms/ml rscu-PA, with corresponding residual fibrinogen levels of 74% and 87%, respectively. In the absence of fibrin, 50% fibrinogenolysis in 2 h in normal human plasma required 2.1 micrograms/ml rscu-PA, but 7.9 micrograms/ml rscu-PA-40-kDa/Hir. Thus, the chimera rscu-PA-40-kDa/Hir has maintained the specific fibrinolytic and plasminogen activating activity of rscu-PA as well as its fibrinolytic potency in plasma, whereas it displayed a similar or somewhat better fibrin specificity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
