The DAZ (Deleted in AZoospermia) and DAZLA (DAZ-like autosomal) genes may be determinants of male infertility. The DAZ gene on the long arm of the human Y chromosome is a strong candidate for the 'azoospermia factor' (AZF). Its role in spermatogenesis is supported by its exclusive expression in testis, its deletion in a high percentage of males with azoospermia or severe oligospermia, and its homology with a Drosophila male infertility gene boule. No DAZ homologous sequences have been found on the mouse Y chromosome. Instead, a Dazla gene was isolated from mouse chromosome 17 and has been considered to be a murine homologue of DAZ. However, the homology between human DAZ and mouse Dazla is not strong, and Dazla contains only one of the seven DAZ repeats found in DAZ. We report the isolation of the human DAZLA gene by screening a human testis cDNA library with a DAZ cDNA clone. DAZLA encodes only one DAZ repeat and shares high homology with the mouse Dazla, indicating that these two genes are homologues. Using a panel of rodent-human somatic cell lines and fluorescence in situ hybridization, the DAZLA gene was mapped to 3p24, a region not known to share homology with mouse chromosome 17. The DAZLA gene may be involved in some familial cases of autosomal recessive male infertility.
