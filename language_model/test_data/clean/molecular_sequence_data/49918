Chronic stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system results in increased zona glomerulosa cells and in cells expressing the final enzyme in the synthesis of aldosterone, the cytochrome P-450 aldosterone synthase. The genes activated during adrenal remodeling are not well defined. We have reported that the expression of interferon-inducible genes, 9-27, 1-8D and 1-8U in H295R cells is stimulated by A-II. The 9-27 gene is expressed mainly in leukocytes and is associated with cell proliferation. In this study, we searched for similar genes in a rat zona glomerulosa cDNA library, and examined the regulation of the expression of these genes. We found the Rat8 gene, which has been reported to be similar to human interferon-inducible genes, as well as two similar genes, No. 10 (1096 bp), and No. 16 (630 bp). Rat8 gene and No. 16 were mainly expressed in zona glomerulosa. The product of No. 10 is thought to be a secreted protein, unlike those of 8 and 16, and its expression in the adrenal was weak in comparison. The control of the expression of rat8 or No. 16 genes differs depending on the tissue. Expression in A10 cells (derived from rat embryo thoracic aorta) was not stimulated by A-II, nor was it influenced by salt intake in the adrenal gland, but it was reduced in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) of rats on a low sodium diet. These results show that genes similar to the human 1-8 gene family are expressed in rat adrenal glomerulosa cells and VSMC, but their expression is not regulated by A-II. The function of these genes in VSMC and adrenal is unknown.
