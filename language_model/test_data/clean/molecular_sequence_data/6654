The L6 rust resistance gene from flax was cloned after tagging with the maize transposable element Activator. The gene is predicted to encode two products of 1294 and 705 amino acids that result from alternatively spliced transcripts. The longer product is similar to the products of two other plant disease resistance genes, the tobacco mosaic virus resistance gene N of tobacco and the bacterial resistance gene RPS2 of Arabidopsis. The similarity involves the presence of a nucleotide (ATP/GTP) binding site and several other amino acid motifs of unknown function in the N-terminal half of the polypeptides and a leucine-rich region in the C-terminal half. The truncated product of L6, which lacks most of the leucine-rich C-terminal region, is similar to the truncated product that is predicted from an alternative transcript of the N gene. The L6, N, and RPS2 genes, which control resistance to three widely different pathogen types, are the foundation of a class of plant disease resistance genes that can be referred to as nucleotide binding site/leucine-rich repeat resistance genes.
