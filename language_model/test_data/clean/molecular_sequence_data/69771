A portion of the human X-chromosome (> 5 kb) encoding the translated portion of the thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) gene was sequenced. The primary templates for sequencing were isolated from a human X-chromosome library (two positive plaques from 400,000 screened initially with a TBG cDNA probe) or were produced by PCR amplification using leucocyte genomic DNA as the amplification template. Potential hormone response elements (HREs) were identified at either end of the gene. These HREs have sequences based on the consensus half-site of thyroid hormone response elements, although it is unclear whether the structures are functional HREs. Other potential regulatory elements also were identified towards the 3' end of the gene.
