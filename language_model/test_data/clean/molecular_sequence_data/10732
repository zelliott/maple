Cloning and sequencing of the ure1+ gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe indicated that it encodes the urease which had been biochemically identified. The fission yeast urease has a one-subunit structure like those from plants but different from bacterial ureases which are composed of two or three distinct subunits. Genetic analyses showed that the ure1+ gene product is actually involved in urea metabolism.
