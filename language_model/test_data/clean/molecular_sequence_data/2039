We have used two kinds of footprinting techniques, dimethylsulfate interference and hydroxyl radical protection, to explore the way that IHF recognizes its specific target sequences. Our results lead us to conclude that IHF recognizes DNA primarily through contacts with the minor groove, an unprecedented mode for a sequence-specific binding protein. We have also determined that, although IHF is a small protein that protects a large region of DNA, only a single IHF protomer is present at each binding site. IHF bends the DNA to which it binds. We have combined this fact plus our footprinting and stoichiometry data together with the crystal structure of a related protein, the nonspecific DNA binding protein HU, to propose a model for the way in which IHF binds to its DNA target.
