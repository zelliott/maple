Understanding aqueous protein-protein interactions is crucial for the development of a molecular-thermodynamic model for salt-induced protein precipitation. In addition, protein interactions are important in many disease states, including cataract formation and alpha-amyloid diseases. Fluorescence anisotropy provides a means to measure intermolecular interactions. In this work, monomer-dimer equilibrium of the peptide T4 LYS(11-36) was studied by fluorescence anisotropy over the pH range 4-7 and the NaCl concentration range 0.0-1.0 M, in a 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer. This 26 amino-acid peptide is derived from the beta-sheet region of the T4 lysozyme molecule and has the potential to form amyloid fibrils. The association constant for dimerization increases with rising pH and ionic strength. The potential of mean force for peptide-peptide interactions was calculated from these association constants. Circular-dichroism measurements show that the peptide becomes more structured as the pH rises, possibly contributing to increased association.
