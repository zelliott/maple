S-Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) is a pyruvoyl enzyme, and the pyruvate is formed in an intramolecular reaction that cleaves a proenzyme precursor and converts a serine residue into pyruvate. The wild type potato AdoMetDC proenzyme processed much faster than the human proenzyme and did not require putrescine for an optimal rate of processing despite the presence of three acidic residues (equivalent to Glu11, Glu178, and Glu256) that were demonstrated in previous studies to be required for the putrescine activation of human AdoMetDC proenzyme processing (Stanley, B. A., Shantz, L. M., and Pegg, A. E. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 7901-7907). A fourth residue that is also needed for the putrescine stimulation of human AdoMetDC proenzyme processing was identified in the present studies, and this residue (Asp174) is not present in the potato sequence. The site of potato AdoMetDC proenzyme processing was found to be Ser73 in the conserved sequence, YVLSESS, which is the equivalent of Ser68 in the human sequence. Replacement of the serine precursor with threonine or cysteine by site-directed mutagenesis in either the potato or the human AdoMetDC proenzyme did not prevent processing but caused a significant reduction in the rate. Although the COOH-terminal regions of the known eukaryotic AdoMetDCs are not conserved, only relatively small truncations of 8 residues from the human protein and 25 residues from the potato proenzyme were compatible with processing. The maximally truncated proteins show no similarity in COOH-terminal amino acid sequence but each contained 46 amino acid residues after the last conserved sequence, suggesting that the length of this section of the protein is essential for maintaining the proenzyme conformation needed for autocatalytic processing.
