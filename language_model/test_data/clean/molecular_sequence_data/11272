More than 300 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and are at greatly increased risk of developing liver cirrhosis and eventually primary liver carcinoma. While infection can, with relative success, be prevented by vaccination, no generally effective therapy for chronic hepatitis B is available. Hence there is an urgent need for novel antiviral strategies. Recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying virus replication and assembly provide opportunities for the rational design of molecules that could specifically interfere with these processes; some of these possibilities are discussed in this review.
