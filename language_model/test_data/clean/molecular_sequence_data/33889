Adaptive variation in craniofacial structure contributes to resource specialization and speciation, but the genetic loci that underlie craniofacial adaptation remain unknown. Here we show that alleles of the hedgehog pathway receptor Patched1 (Ptch1) gene are responsible for adaptive variation in the shape of the lower jaw both within and among genera of Lake Malawi cichlid fish. The evolutionarily derived allele of Ptch1 reduces the length of the retroarticular (RA) process of the lower jaw, a change predicted to increase speed of jaw rotation for improved suction-feeding. The alternate allele is associated with a longer RA and a more robustly mineralized jaw, typical of species that use a biting mode of feeding. Genera with the most divergent feeding morphologies are nearly fixed for different Ptch1 alleles, whereas species with intermediate morphologies still segregate variation at Ptch1. Thus, the same alleles that help to define macroevolutionary divergence among genera also contribute to microevolutionary fine-tuning of adaptive traits within some species. Variability of craniofacial morphology mediated by Ptch1 polymorphism has likely contributed to niche partitioning and ecological speciation of these fishes.
