Methanothermus fervidus was shown to have two 5S rRNA-encoding genes linked in rRNA operons to 16S and 23S rRNA-encoding genes. Sequencing of a cloned 5S rRNA gene confirmed that M. fervidus is a member of the Methanobacteriales, although its 5S rRNA is also similar in both primary sequence and predicted secondary structure to the 5S rRNA of the non-methanogenic, but also extremely thermophilic archaebacterium, Thermococcus celer. Two clusters of tRNA genes have also been cloned and sequenced form M. fervidus. The smaller cluster, cloned in pET5401, is composed of 5'-tRNA(UGUThr)-tRNA(UGGPro)-tRNA(GUCAsp)-tRNA(UUUL ys)-3' and the larger cluster, cloned in pET5475, is composed of 5'-tRNA(GUUAsn)-tRNA(CAUMet)-tRNA(UUCGlu)-tRNA(UAGL eu)-tRNA(GUGHis)-3'. The encoded tRNAs, with the exception of the tRNA(Leu), translate abundant codons in M. fervidus. The tRNA genes do not contain introns or encode 3'-terminal CCA residues. Homologous clusters of tRNA genes have been sequenced from Methanococcus vannielii and Methanococcus voltae, so that comparisons of transcription signals, gene organizations and primary sequences can be made and features possibly related to thermostability identified. During evolution, a 5S rRNA gene appears to have been incorporated into the cluster of tRNA genes in the methanococci but not in M. fervidus.
