An hepatitis B immunization programme was initiated in Senegal in 1978, and infants included in this controlled study have been followed for a period of 2-12 years after immunization. During this period HBV infections have been observed both in vaccinated and non-vaccinated infants. The polymerase chain reaction was used to search for HBV DNA sequences in the sera of 153 children with evidence of serum markers of past or present HBV replication. Amplified HBV DNA sequences were detected in 93% of the HBsAg positive individuals, in 58% of those only positive for antiHBc antibodies and in 7.8% of antiHBs and antiHBc positive infants. The results confirm the high efficiency and long-lasting effectiveness of HB vaccine.
