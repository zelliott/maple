A series of fusions to the reporter proteins alkaline phosphatase and beta-galactosidase have been constructed in the predicted periplasmic and cytoplasmic loops of TetA(K), a protein responsible for efflux-mediated tetracycline resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. The results support a topological model of 14 transmembrane segments for TetA(K).
