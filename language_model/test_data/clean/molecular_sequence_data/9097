Among approximately 480 RING domain-containing E3 Ub ligases in Arabidopsis, three, At3g46620, At5g59550, and At2g39720, have a domain-of-unknown-function (DUF) 1117 motif in their C-terminal regions. At3g46620 and At5g59550 were identified as homologous ABA- and drought-induced RING-DUF1117 genes and were designated AtRDUF1 and AtRDUF2, respectively. Single and double knock-out mutations of AtRDUFs resulted in hyposensitive phenotypes toward ABA in terms of germination rate and stomatal closure and markedly reduced tolerance to drought stress relative to wild-type plants. These results are discussed in the context that AtRDUF1 and AtRDUF2 play combinatorial, but still distinguishable, roles in ABA-mediated dehydration stress responses.
