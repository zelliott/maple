Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an important subsistence and cash crop in the semi-arid tropics where it often suffers from drought stress. Although its ecophysiological responses are studied, little is known about the molecular events involved in its adaptive responses to drought. The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of membrane phospholipid and protein degrading enzymes as well as protective proteins such as "late embryogenesis-abundant" (LEA) protein in peanut adaptive responses to drought. Partial cDNAs encoding putative phospholipase D alpha, cysteine protease, serine protease and a full-length cDNA encoding a LEA protein were cloned. Their expression in response to progressive water deficit and rehydration was compared between cultivars differing in their tolerance to drought. Differential gene expression pattern according to either water deficit intensity and cultivar's tolerance to drought were observed. A good correspondence between the molecular responses of the studied cultivars and their physiological responses previously defined in greenhouse and field experiments was found. Molecular characters, as they were detectable at an early stage, could therefore be efficiently integrated in groundnut breeding programmes for drought adaptation. Thus, the relevance of the target genes as drought tolerance indicators is discussed.
