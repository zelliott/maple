Mycobacterium tuberculosis secretes several proteins into the extracellular environment, some of which are restricted to the M. tuberculosis complex. One of these antigens is MPT64. Recently, the authors showed that native as well as recombinant MPT64 is able to distinguish between an M. tuberculosis infection and a BCG Danish 1331 vaccination. Improved distinction between tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) sensitivity conferred by an M. tuberculosis infection and that induced by a BCG vaccination or infection with environmental mycobacteria would be useful in the control of tuberculosis. In this study, the authors report the mapping and characterization of a Dth-inducing epitope by the use of synthetic peptides in guinea-pigs vaccinated with BCG Danish 1331 or Tokyo. Studies with overlapping synthetic peptides have pinpointed the biological activity to a single Dth-inducing epitope at the carboxyterminal region of MPT64 consisting of 15 residues between amino acids Gly-173 and Ala-187, the core epitope (CE15). A fine mapping using truncated versions of CE15 indicates the epitope is restricted to 13 residues between amino acids Val-174 to Glu-186. However, the optimal Dth reactivity is obtained by CE15. Different modifications of CE15 revealed that a lysine tree construction improves the skin reactivity to a maximum level approaching that of the reactivity to tuberculin PPD.
