Intercellular junctions present a formidable challenge for the paracellular delivery of drugs. Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules, which are responsible for the formation and regulation of these junctions. Anti-E-cadherin monoclonal antibody can bind to E-cadherin (uvomorulin) and inhibit cell-cell adhesion through the inhibition of cadherin-cadherin interactions. The objective of this study was to utilize this monoclonal anti-E-cadherin antibody to map the extracellular domains of E- and N-cadherin. This was accomplished by using two different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), a regular indirect ELISA and an immobilized-peptide ELISA. Two peptides from each extracellular domain were recognized by this anti-E-cadherin antibody. By mapping the extracellular domains of cadherins, peptides that have discrete roles in cell-cell adhesion can be identified. This will aid in the design of synthetic peptides that can modulate intercellular junctions to improve drug delivery.
