Human profilin is a 15-kDa protein that plays a major role in the signaling pathway leading to cytoskeletal rearrangement. Essentially complete assignment of the 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances of human profilin have been made by analysis of multidimensional, double- and triple-resonance nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. The deviation of the 13C alpha and 13C beta chemical shifts from their respective random coil values were analyzed and correlate well with the secondary structure determined from the NMR data. Twenty structures of human profilin were refined in the program X-PLOR using a total of 1186 experimentally derived conformational restraints. The structures converged to a root mean squared distance deviation of 1.5 A for the backbone atoms. The resultant conformational ensemble indicates that human profilin is an alpha/beta protein comprised of a seven-stranded, antiparallel beta-sheet and three helices. The secondary structure elements for human profilin are quite similar to those found in Acanthamoeba profilin I [Archer, S. J., Vinson, V. K., Pollard, T. D., & Torchia, D. A. (1993), Biochemistry 32, 6680-6687], suggesting that the three-dimensional structure of Acanthamoeba profilin I should be analogous to that determined here for human profilin. The structure determination of human profilin has facilitated the sequence alignment of lower eukaryotic and human profilins and provides a framework upon which the various functionalities of profilin can be explored. At least one element of the actin-binding region of human profilin is an alpha-helix. Two mechanisms by which phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate can interfere with actin-binding by human profilin are proposed.
