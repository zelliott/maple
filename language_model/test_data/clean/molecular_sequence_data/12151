Data on the structure, properties, and biosynthesis of C-reactive protein (CRP) are summarized. Special attention is paid to the specific interaction of C-reactive protein with Ca(2+)-dependent and Ca(2+)-independent ligands: phosphorylcholine-containing compounds, lipoproteins, chromatin, galactans, polycations, etc. The data on the interaction of CRP with Ca2+ are presented. The methods for the CRP isolation and purification are discussed with an emphasis on affinity chromatography as the most promising method for obtaining purified CRP.
