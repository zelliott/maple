Six morphine-dependent and two control macaques were infected in an SIV/SHIV nonhuman primate model of AIDS. Three animals in the morphine group rapidly developed clinical disease and died within the timeframe of this study. The sequence evolution of nef in plasma virus was assessed at 4, 12, and 20 weeks postinfection. Cloned sequences were compared phylogenetically against each other as well as against the inoculum virus clones to determine the effect of morphine and rate of disease progression on diversity and divergence, respectively. Unlike our earlier studies of tat and env, nef evolution was not affected by morphine abuse or by rapid disease progression. The results suggest that although the evolution of other loci is inversely correlated to the onset and rate of clinical disease, differential evolution of nef is related neither to drug abuse nor to rapid progression within the first 20 weeks of infection.
