Comprised of RFX5, RFXAP, and RFX-B/ANK, the regulatory factor X (RFX) complex is an obligate transcription factor required for the expression of MHC class II genes. RFX functions by binding to the conserved X1 box sequence located upstream of all MHC class II genes. Using a mutagenesis scheme and a yeast heterologous reporter system, the mechanism by which the RFX complex is transported into the nucleus was examined. The results have identified specific nuclear localization signals (NLS) in both RFX5 and RFXAP that direct the nuclear translocation and expression of MHC class II genes. Additionally, a nuclear export signal was identified in the N terminus of RFXAP. RFX-B was poorly localized to the nucleus, and no specific NLS was identified. Whereas RFX5 could import an RFXAP NLS mutant into the nucleus, it had no effect on the import of RFX-B. The results suggest that although RFX5 and RFXAP could assemble before nuclear import, RFX-B association with the complex does not take place until after the subunits enter the nucleus. The identification of nuclear import and export sites on RFX molecules provides potential targets to modulate MHC class II expression.
