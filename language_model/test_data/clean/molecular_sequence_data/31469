A Gram-staining-positive, endospore-forming rod was isolated independently from clinical specimens in New York State, USA, once in 2009 and twice in 2011. The three isolates had identical 16S rRNA gene sequences and, based on their 16S rRNA gene sequence, are most closely related to the type strains of Laceyella sediminis and L. sacchari (94.6 % similarity). The partial 23S rRNA gene sequences of the three strains were also 100 % identical. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis suggests that the new isolates belong to the family Thermoactinomycetaceae. Additional biochemical and phenotypic characteristics of the strains support the family designation and suggest that the three isolates represent a single species. In each of the strains, the predominant menaquinone is MK-7, the diagnostic diamino acid is meso-diaminopimelic acid and the major cellular fatty acids are iso-C15 : 0, anteiso-C15 : 0 and iso-C13 : 0. The polar lipids are phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, four unknown phospholipids, four unknown aminophospholipids and an unknown lipid. It is proposed that the novel isolates represent a single novel species within a new genus, for which the name Hazenella coriacea gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Hazenella coriacea is strain 23436(T) ( = DSM 45707(T) = LMG 27204(T)).
