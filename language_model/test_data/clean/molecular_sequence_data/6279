The synthesis of methyl O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2)-alpha-D-galactopyranosides specifically deoxygenated at position 2 (31), or 4 (21) of the rhamnopyranosyl residue was accomplished using methyl 3,4,6-tri-O-benzoyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside (18) as the glycosyl acceptor. Phenyl thionocarbonate activation of the penta-O-benzoylated disaccharide precursor followed by Barton reduction and Zempl√©n transesterification gave 31, while 21 was obtained via condensation of the deoxygenated monosaccharide donor with 18, and subsequent debenzoylation of the product.
