The neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) family of Ca(2+)-binding proteins regulates a number of different processes in neurons and photoreceptor cells. The first of these proteins to be characterized, recoverin, was shown to exhibit a Ca(2+)/myristoyl switch whereby its N-terminal myristoyl group is sequestered in the Ca(2+)-free form and is exposed on Ca(2+) binding to allow the protein to become membrane-associated. It has subsequently been shown that certain other family members also exhibit this mechanism in living cells. In contrast, NCS-1 does not show the Ca(2+)/myristoyl switch and is membrane-associated even at low Ca(2+) concentrations. We have used sequence comparison combined with information from structural analyses to attempt to identify candidate residues within the NCS proteins that determine whether or not the Ca(2+)/myristoyl switch operates in cells and have tested their functional significance by mutagenesis. The results show that NCS-1 possesses residues within its N terminus that lock the myristoyl group in an exposed conformation. In addition, other structural aspects within the C-terminal domains are required to allow the switch to operate. We have determined a key role for residues within the motif EELTRK in NCS-1 in keeping the myristoyl group exposed and allowing the protein to be constitutively membrane-associated.
