Fluoresence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to localize cosmids to regions of human chromosome 10. A total of 301 cosmids were selected randomly from a flow-sorted human chromosome 10 cosmid library constructed from human x hamster cell line 762-8A and arrayed in microtiter storage dishes. Over 70% (211/301) of the cosmids mapped to unique regions of chromosome 10. About 7% (22/301) produced multiple hybridization signals indicative of chimeric clones or sequences repeated at low copy number. Three cosmids (3/301, or 1%) hybridized to the centromeric regions of chromosome 10 and one or more other human chromosomes. About 19% (59/301) consisted mostly or entirely of hamster DNA inserts, and about 2% (6/301) appeared to be nonrecombinants.
