When rat liver xanthine dehydrogenase was incubated with fluorodinitrobenzene (FDNB) at pH 8.5, the total enzyme activity decreased gradually to a limited value of initial activity with modification of two lysine residues in a similar way to the modification of bovine milk xanthine oxidase with FDNB (Nishino, T., Tsushima, K., Hille, R. and Massey, V. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 7348-7353). After modification with FDNB, the two peptides containing dinitrophenyl-lysine were isolated from the molybdopterin domain after proteolytic digestion and were identified as Lys754 and Lys771 by sequencing the peptides. During the modification of these lysine residues, xanthine dehydrogenase was found to be converted to an oxidase form in the early stage of incubation. Incorporation of the 3H-dinitrophenyl group into enzyme cysteine residues was 0.96 mol per enzyme FAD for 68% conversion to the oxidase form. The modified enzyme was reconverted to the dehydrogenase form by incubation with dithiothreitol with concomitant release of 3H-dinitrophenyl compounds. After modification with 3H-FDNB followed by carboxymethylation under denaturating conditions, the enzyme was digested with proteases. Three 3H-dinitrophenyl-labeled peptides were isolated and sequenced. The modified residues were identified to be Cys535, Cys992 and Cys1324. These residues are conserved among the all known mammalian enzymes, but Cys992 and Cys1324 are not conserved in the chicken enzyme. Cys1324 of the rat enzyme was found not to be involved in the conversion from the dehydrogenase to the oxidase by limited proteolysis experiments, but Cys535 and Cys992 which seemed to be modified alternatively with FDNB appear to be involved in the conversion.
