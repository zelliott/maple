We have isolated and characterized a cDNA sequence corresponding to the zebrafish muscle-specific isoform of creatine kinase. The sequence is 1552 bases in length and contains an open reading frame capable of producing a 381 amino acid protein. The sequence is very similar to muscle-specific creatine kinases isolated from other species at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels but contains some differences from a previously reported zebrafish clone.
