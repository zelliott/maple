The entire double-stranded DNA genome of bacteriophage BFK20, a lytic phage of the Brevibacterium flavum CCM 251--industrial producer of L-lysine--was sequenced and analyzed. It consists of 42,968 base pairs with an overall molar G + C content of 56.2%. Fifty-five potential open reading frames were identified and annotated using various bioinformatics tools. Clusters of functionally related putative genes were defined (structural, lytic, replication and regulatory). To verify the annotation of structural proteins, they were resolved by 2D gel electrophoresis and were submitted to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Structural proteins identified included the portal and major and minor tail proteins. Based on the overall genome sequence comparison, similarities with other known bacteriophage genomes include primarily bacteriophages from Mycobacterium spp. and some regions of Corynebacterium spp. genomes--possible prophages. Our results support the theory that phage genomes are mosaics with respect to each other.
