An in vitro RNA bandshift assay has been developed to demonstrate the binding of purified recombinant encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3Dpol) to the 3'-noncoding region (NCR) and 30 nucleotides of the adjacent 3'-terminal poly(A) tail (3'-NCR(A)) of EMC virus RNA. The binding of 3Dpol to the 3'-NCR(A) fragment was specific since four other unrelated proteins including an RNA polymerase did not bind, and unlabeled 3'-NCR(A), but not alpha-globin mRNA, tRNA, or pure poly(A), competed with radiolabeled 3'-NCR(A) for binding. Surprisingly, 3Dpol failed to bind to the 3'-NCR of EMC virus RNA lacking the poly(A) tail. The results together show that EMC virus RNA template specificity depends only on 3Dpol, the 3'-NCR, and the poly(A) tail. This suggests that 3'-poly(A) is essential for viral RNA template selection by the EMC virus RNA polymerase.
