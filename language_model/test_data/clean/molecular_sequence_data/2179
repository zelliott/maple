From a human fetal liver cDNA library, a cDNA clone (lambda HFL33) containing the entire coding region for a form of cytochrome P-450 related to P-450 HFLa was obtained. The clone was 1,971 bp long and had an open reading frame of 1,509 nucleotides coding for a 503 amino acid polypeptide. The nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences of lambda HFL33 were very similar to but clearly distinct from those of NF25 and HLp cDNAs, which code for forms of cytochrome P-450 in adult human liver. The deduced N-terminal amino acid sequence of the HFL33 protein was identical to that of P-450 HFLa.
