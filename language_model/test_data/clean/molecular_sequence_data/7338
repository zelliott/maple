The classification of bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus has virtually been constructed according to generally accepted peculiarities of the carbohydrate metabolism of the 3 selective groups. The information about the nucleotide contents of DNA (%GC) allows to divide all of 67 species included in the genus into 4 "nucleotide" group according to genosystematics principles. The first group species has %GC = first--49-53, second--42-46, third--34-41 and fourth--32-37. In this manner, it will be singled out 4 new genera in a new proposed family Lactobacillaceae comb.nov.: Thermobacterium comb.nov., Streptobacterium comb.nov., Mediumbacterium comb.nov., and Betabacterium comb.nov. correspondingly. For further revision of the systematics of the bacteria of the Lactobacillaceae family comb.nov. in the direction of approaching its to the natural one it is essential to study of the degree of genome similarities of species representatives within being outline 4 "nucleotide" group both the molecular hybridization using the specific DNA probes and the restriction analysis of the chromosomal DNA (dactyloscopy genome technique).
