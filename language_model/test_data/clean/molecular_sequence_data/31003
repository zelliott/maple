We have cloned the human liver/bone/kidney alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) gene using a liver-type ALPL cDNA as a probe. The gene is divided into 12 exons, and is likely to exist as a single copy in haploid genome. As compared with the gene isolated using a bone-type ALPL cDNA (Weiss et al., J. Biol. Chem. 263, 12002-12010, 1988), another leader exon specific for the liver-type ALPL mRNA was assigned about 3.4 kb upstream from exon 2 and the alternative splicing in the first exon was indicated. RNA blot analysis showed that three species of mRNA of 2.5, 4.1 and 4.7 kilobases were detected in liver and developmentally regulated.
