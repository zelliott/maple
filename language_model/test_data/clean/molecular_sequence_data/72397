An aggregate-forming coccus, isolated twice as the predominant microorganism in sputa from a cystic fibrosis patient on consecutive days, was shown to belong to the species Lautropia mirabilis on the bases of similarities of 16S rRNA gene sequences and phenotype. These isolates of L. mirabilis appear to be the first reported from a patient with cystic fibrosis and outside of Denmark.
