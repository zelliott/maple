Reproductive transition, inflorescence architecture, meristem patterning, and floral organ identity have been studied as distinct research areas in plant science. By using the ornamental plant Gerbera, we demonstrate that all of these keystone aspects of reproductive meristematic fate are integrated genetically by a single SEPALLATA-like MADS-box gene from a functional class designated previously as "floral homeotic" or "organ identity." This extended regulatory network has not been elaborated in the model plant systems, which have a floral design and inflorescence-determinacy state that obscures these relationships.
