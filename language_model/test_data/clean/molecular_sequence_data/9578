There are a large numbers of tandem repeats in FLO1, which are highly dynamic components in genome leading to the unstable flocculation profiles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The effects of repeated unite B or D deletion on the function of flocculation protein was studied to provide theory basis for constructing genetically stable flocculation gene with minimal size.

We cloned the intact flocculation gene FLO1 from S. cerevisiae YS59 by PCR, and constructed the derived genes FLO1b and FLO1d with repeated unite B or D deletion respectively by fusion PCR. We analyzed the physiological characteristics of flocculation in yeast strains YSF1, YSF1b and YSF1d containing FLO1, FLO1b and FLO1d respectively.

YSF1b and YSF1d displayed almost the same level of Flo1-type flocculation as YSF1. However, flocculation of YSF1b and YSF1d, especially YSF1d was more tolerant to pH change and mannose concentration than strain YSF1.

Tandem repeats regulate the function of flocculation protein. Deletion of repeated unite B or D, especially D increases the stability of flocculation protein.
