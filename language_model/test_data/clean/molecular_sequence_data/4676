The structural and functional organization of the Cct complex was addressed by genetic analyses of subunit interactions and catalytic cooperativity among five of the eight different essential subunits, Cct1p-Cct8p, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cct1-1, cct2-3, and cct3-1 alleles, containing mutations at the conserved putative ATP-binding motif, GDGTT, are cold-sensitive, whereas single and multiple replacements of the corresponding motif in Cct6p are well tolerated by the cell. We demonstrated herein that cct6-3 (L19S), but not the parolog cct1-5 (R26I), specifically suppresses the cct1-1, cct2-3, and cct3-1 alleles, and that this suppression can be modulated by mutations in a putative phosphorylation motif, RXS, and the putative ATP-binding pocket of Cct6p. Our results suggest that the Cct ring is comprised of a single hetero-oligomer containing eight subunits of differential functional hierarchy, in which catalytic cooperativity of ATP-binding/hydrolysis takes place in a sequential manner different from the concerted cooperativity proposed for GroEL.
