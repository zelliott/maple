We studied sequence differences in regulatory elements of the long terminal repeat (LTR) and primer-binding site (PBS) among various human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtypes. Phylogenetic sequence analysis of a fragment of 729 base pairs (bp) covering the Gag-coding region for half of p24 and all of p17 revealed the gag subtype of all 60 viruses included in the study: A (n = 20), B (n = 12), C (n = 7), D (n = 10), E (n = 3), F (n = 4), G (n = 3), and H (n = 1). The subtype was also determined by analysis of a 689-bp fragment comprising the LTR and the PBS motif. Comparison of the LTR versus gag sequences showed a mosaic genome for seven isolates. After analysis of all sequences, we could describe subtype-specific differences in sequences encompassing the regulatory elements of the LTR and the PBS motif.
