A novel nocardioform actinomycete strain YIM 31530T was isolated from a soil in Yunnan, China. Based on the results of phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic studies and DNA-DNA hybridization results, strain YIM 31530T should be assigned to a new species of the genus Kribbella, for which the name Kribbella antibiotica sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 31530T(= CCTCC AA001021T = DSM 15501T). The GenBank accession number for the sequence reported in this paper is AY082063.
