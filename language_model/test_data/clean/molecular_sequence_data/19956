Benzalacetone synthase (BAS) is a plant-specific chalcone synthase (CHS) superfamily type III polyketide synthase (PKS) that catalyzes a one-step decarboxylative condensation of 4-coumaroyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA. The diketide forming activity of Rheum palmatum BAS is attributed to the characteristic substitution of the conserved active-site Phe215 with Leu (numbering in Medicago sativa CHS). To further understand the structure and function of R. palmatum BAS, four site-directed mutants (C197T, C197G, G256L, and S338V) were newly constructed. All the mutants did not change the product pattern, however, the activity was 2-fold increased in S338V, while reduced to half in G256L mutant. On the other hand, the C197 mutants were functionally almost identical to wild-type BAS, excluding the possibility that the second active-site Cys is involved in the enzyme reaction. Instead, homology modeling suggested a possibility that, unlike the case of CHS, BAS utilizes an alternative pocket to lock the coumaroyl moiety for the diketide formation reaction.
