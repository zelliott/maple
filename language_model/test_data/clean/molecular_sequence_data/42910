1. The proposed terms and codes provide concise, quantitative information on the polymer backbone, state of oxidation, patterns of sulphation and epimerization, and proportions of monomeric units. Oversulphated domains and special units are easily recognized. 2. They are intermediate between general statements (e.g. 'chondroitin sulphate') and detailed primary structures. 3. They bring terminology into line with current analytical techniques, which depend largely on enzymes developed by S. Suzuki and co-workers. Current enzyme nomenclature (chondroitinase ABC, AC) can still be used. 4. They are not primarily intended to be spoken, although some codes are easily articulated. 5. They have capacity and flexibility to accommodate future developments.
