2-Cys peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are a large and diverse family of peroxidases which, in addition to their antioxidant functions, regulate cell signaling pathways, apoptosis, and differentiation. These enzymes are obligate homodimers (alpha(2)), utilizing a unique intermolecular redox-active disulfide center for the reduction of peroxides, and are known to form two oligomeric states: individual alpha(2) dimers or doughnut-shaped (alpha(2))(5) decamers. Here we characterize both the oligomerization properties and crystal structure of a bacterial 2-Cys Prx, Salmonella typhimurium AhpC. Analytical ultracentrifugation and dynamic light scattering show that AhpC's oligomeric state is redox linked, with oxidization favoring the dimeric state. The 2.5 A resolution crystal structure (R = 18.5%, R(free) = 23.9%) of oxidized, decameric AhpC reveals a metastable oligomerization intermediate, allowing us to identify a loop that adopts distinct conformations associated with decameric and dimeric states, with disulfide bond formation favoring the latter. This molecular switch contains the peroxidatic cysteine and acts to buttress the oligomerization interface in the reduced, decameric enzyme. A structurally detailed catalytic cycle incorporating these ideas and linking activity to oligomeric state is presented. Finally, on the basis of sequence comparisons, we suggest that the enzymatic and signaling activities of all 2-Cys Prxs are regulated by a redox-sensitive dimer to decamer transition.
