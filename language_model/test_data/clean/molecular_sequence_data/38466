We have previously reported that IL-10 inhibits proliferation of normal bone marrow-derived macrophages and of the monocyte/macrophage cell line J774. Activation of Stat3 was shown to be necessary and sufficient to mediate inhibition of proliferation. To investigate further the mechanism of growth arrest, we examined the effect of IL-10 on expression of cell cycle inhibitors. We found that IL-10 treatment increases expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p19INK4D and p21CIP1 in macrophages. IL-10 cannot induce p19INK4D expression or block proliferation when Stat3 signaling is blocked by a dominant negative Stat3 or a mutant IL-10Ralpha which does not recruit Stat3 in J774 cells, whereas p21CIP1 induction is not affected. An inducibly active Stat3 (coumermycin-dimerizable Stat3-Gyrase B), which suppresses J774 cell proliferation, also induced p19INK4D expression. Sequencing of the murine p19INK4D promoter revealed two candidate Stat3 binding sites, and IL-10 treatment activated a reporter gene controlled by this promoter. These data suggest that Stat3-dependent induction of p19INK4D mediates inhibition of proliferation. Enforced expression of murine p19INK4D cDNA J774 cells significantly reduced their proliferation. Use of antisense p19INK4D and analysis of p19INK4D-deficient macrophages confirmed that p19INK4D is required for optimal inhibition of proliferation by IL-10, and indicated that additional IL-10 signaling events contribute to this response. These data indicate that Stat3-dependent induction of p19INK4D and Stat3-independent induction of p21CIP1 are important components of the mechanism by which IL-10 blocks proliferation in macrophages.
