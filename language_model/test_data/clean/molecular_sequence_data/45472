Here we report a novel domain, MSTF (domain involved in bacterial metallopeptidases, surface proteins and other proteins, also present in mycobacteriophage tape-measure proteins and fungal proteins), which is present in bacteria, phages and fungi. MSTF is about 67-94 amino acids in length with one HxDHxH motif and some highly conserved residues including His, Gly, Ala and Asp. Secondary structure prediction indicated that this domain contains two alpha-helices and one beta-sheet. Identification of MSTF will provide an opportunity to develop new strategies to combat pathogenic microorganisms, especially Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
