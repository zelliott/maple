The design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationships (SAR) for the development of selective dipeptoid ligands for both of the cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor subtypes CCK-A and CCK-B are described. The SAR developed is used to design a ligand with equal nanomolar binding affinity for both the CCK-A and CCK-B receptors. Example compounds such as [1R-[1 alpha[R*(R*)],2 beta]]-4-[[2-[[3-(1H-indol-3-yl)- 2-methyl-2-[[[(2-methylcyclohexyl)oxy]carbonyl]amino]-1- oxopropyl]-amino]-1-phenylethyl]amino]-4-oxo-butanoic acid (24c), (1R-trans)-N-[alpha-methyl-N-[[(2-methylcyclohexyl)oxy] carbonyl]-D-tryptophyl]-L-3-(phenylmethyl)-beta-alanine (28i), and N-[alpha-methyl-N-[(tricyclo[3.3.1.1]dec-2-yloxy) carbonyl]-D-tryptophanyl]-L-3-(phenylmethyl)-beta-alanine (30m) are CCK-B selective compounds having CCK-B binding affinities of IC50 = 3.9, 0.34, and 0.15 nM with a CCK-A/CCK-B ratio of 464, 53, and 170, respectively. Other compounds such as (1R-trans)-N-[alpha-methyl-N-[[(2-methylcyclohexyl)oxy]carbonyl]- L-tryptophyl]-D-3-(phenylmethyl)-beta-alanine (281) and N-(alpha-methyl-N-[(tricyclo[3.3.1.1]dec-2-yloxy)carbonyl]-L - tryptophyl]-D-3-(phenylmethyl)-beta-alanine (30p) are CCK-A-selective compounds having CCK-A binding affinities of IC50 = 7.9 and 2.82 nM with a CCK-A/CCK-B ratio of 0.007 and 0.01, respectively. Further to these, (1S-trans)-N-[alpha-methyl-N-[[(2-methylcyclohexyl)oxy] carbonyl]-D-tryptophyl]-L-3-(phenylmethyl)-beta-alanine (28h) is a mixed CCK-A/CCK-B ligand with a CCK-A binding affinity of IC50 = 3.9 nM and a CCK-B binding affinity of IC50 = 4.2, producing a CCK-A/CCK-B ratio of unity. The CCK-B selective compounds are shown to be antagonists in electrophysiological tests on the rat ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus with an equilibrium constant (Ke) value of 2.8 nM for 30m and are also shown to be anxiolytic in the mouse ligh/dark box test with a minimum effective dose of 0.01 mg/kg, sc, for 30m. The CCK-A selective compounds are also shown to be competitive antagonists by the inhibition of CCK-8S-evoked amylase secretion from pancreatic acinar cells with a Ke value of 16 nM for 30p. In electrophysiological tests on the rat dorsal raph√© (an area rich in CCK-A receptors) 30p had a Ke value of 12.8 nM. The mixed CCK-A/CCK-B compound 28h showed antagonistic properties in both CCK-A and CCK-B models; thus it inhibited CCK-8S-evoked amylase secretion from pancreatic acinar cells and is anxiolytic in the light/dark box paradigm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
