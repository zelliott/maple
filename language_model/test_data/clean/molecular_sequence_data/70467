CD84 is a member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily (IgSF) with two Ig-like domains expressed primarily on B lymphocytes and macrophages. Here we describe the cloning of the mouse homologue of human CD84. Mouse CD84 cDNA clones were isolated from a macrophage library. The nucleotide sequence of mouse CD84 was shown to include an open reading frame encoding a putative 329 amino acid protein composed of a 21 amino acid leader peptide, two extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and an 87 amino acid cytoplasmic domain. Mouse CD84 shares 57.3% amino acid sequence identity (88.7%, considering conservative amino acid substitutions) with the human homologue. Chromosome localization studies mapped the mouse CD84 gene to distal chromosome 1 adjacent to the gene for Ly-9, placing it close to the region where other members of the CD2 IgSF (CD48 and 2B4) have been mapped. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of mouse CD84 was predominantly restricted to hematopoietic tissues. Two species of mRNA of 3.6 kilobases (kb) and 1.5 kb were observed. The finding that the pattern of expression was restricted to the hematopoietic system and the conserved sequence of the mouse CD84 homologue suggests that the function of the CD84 glycoprotein may be similar in humans and mice.
