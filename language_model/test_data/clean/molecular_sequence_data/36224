Five dinucleotide tandem repeat (DNTR) sequences were isolated from yeast artificial chromosomes containing the PGK1 and DXS56 loci in Xq13. Sequence information of these DNTR loci is given. Four of the five DNTR sequences were polymorphic. Polymorphism information content values were 0.44, 0.49, 0.47, and 0.76 for loci PY5-10, PY2-31, 4548-1, and 4548-7, respectively. Corresponding heterozygosities were 0.55, 0.55, 0.56, and 0.78. These DNTRs are useful for the fine mapping of disease loci in Xq13 and provide sequence tagged sites for this region of the X chromosome.
