Developmentally regulated mechanisms involving alternative RNA splicing and/or polyadenylation, as well as transcription termination, are implicated in controlling the levels of secreted mu (mu s), membrane mu (mu m) and delta immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain mRNAs during B cell differentiation (mu gene encodes the mu heavy chain). Using expression vectors constructed with genomic DNA segments composed of the mu m polyadenylation signal region, we analyzed poly(A) site utilization and termination of transcription in stably transfected myeloma cells and in murine fibroblast L cells. We found that the gene segment containing the mu m poly(A) signals, along with 536 bp of downstream flanking sequence, acted as a transcription terminator in both myeloma cells and L cell fibroblasts. Neither a 141-bp DNA fragment (which directed efficient polyadenylation at the mu m site), nor the 536-bp flanking nucleotide sequence alone, were sufficient to obtain a similar regulation. This shows that the mu m poly(A) region plays a central role in controlling developmentally regulated transcription termination by blocking downstream delta gene expression. Because this gene segment exhibited the same RNA processing and termination activities in fibroblasts, it appears that these processes are not tissue-specific.
