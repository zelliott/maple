EcoRI and BamHI fragments of rye chloroplast DNA comprising psbA gene were cloned and a 2729 bp region was sequenced. Cloning of EcoRI fragment into pTZ19R plasmid led to a single nucleotide deletion in the coding region of psbA gene. A scheme of full-length psbA gene cloning is proposed, allowing one to escape the damage effect of the psbA gene expression product on the host cell. The differences between monocot and dicot in nucleotide sequences of DNA downstream of psbA genes are discussed. Gene rps19 is located 131 bp downstream from psbA gene on the complementary strand. The amino acid sequences of D1 and S19 proteins of different species are compared.
