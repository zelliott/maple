The alpha-synuclein mutation Ala53Thr is associated with increased oligomerization, toxicity, and early onset Parkinson disease in humans, but 53Thr is the normal residue in other species. Comparative sequencing of SNCA genes shows that 53Ala marks the divergence of Old World and New World primates, in an otherwise constrained protein region. These results have implications for interpreting Parkinson disease models and suggest that other long-lived mammals have different mechanisms to forestall alpha-synucleinopathy.
