An unusual RNA element was discovered in an isolate of the oomyceteous fungus Phytophthora infestans. The RNA exists predominantly as single-stranded molecules of about 625 nucleotides with complementary strands present at a ratio of approximately 130:1. Gel mobility and PCR assays indicated that the element was linear. The RNA appeared to be an autonomous element, since P. infestans DNA did not contain cross-hybridizing sequences. Standard methods for virus purification yielded no evidence for encapsidation of the RNA, or for other virus particles in the isolate bearing the replicon. The replicon contained polyU and polyA tracts at its 5' and 3' termini, respectively, with a central region that had a GC content of 47%, and lacked obvious ORFs. Two-thirds of the replicon co-purified with nuclei, at about 200 copies per nucleus, while one-third resided in a cytoplasmic but non-mitochondrial location. Maternal inheritance was observed in sexual crosses, with a few exceptions. The replicon was not widely distributed throughout the species and had little effect on growth or pathogenicity. The data suggest that the RNA is best characterized as a novel linear RNA plasmid.
