The PyrR protein regulates expression of pyrimidine biosynthetic (pyr) genes in many bacteria. PyrR binds to specific sites in the 5' leader RNA of target operons and favors attenuation of transcription. Filter binding and gel mobility assays were used to characterize the binding of PyrR from Bacillus caldolyticus to RNA sequences (binding loops) from the three attenuation regions of the B. caldolyticus pyr operon. Binding of PyrR to the three binding loops and modulation of RNA binding by nucleotides was similar for all three RNAs. The apparent dissociation constants at 0 degrees C were in the range 0.13-0.87 nm in the absence of effectors; dissociation constants were decreased by three- to 12-fold by uridine nucleotides and increased by 40- to 200-fold by guanosine nucleotides. The binding data suggest that pyr operon expression is regulated by the ratio of intracellular uridine nucleotides to guanosine nucleotides; the effects of nucleoside addition to the growth medium on aspartate transcarbamylase (pyrB) levels in B. subtilis cells in vivo supported this conclusion. Analytical ultracentrifugation established that RNA binds to dimeric PyrR, even though the tetrameric form of unbound PyrR predominates in solution at the concentrations studied.
