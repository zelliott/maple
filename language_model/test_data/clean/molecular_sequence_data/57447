A cDNA clone for pre-ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) was obtained by screening a Cyanophora paradoxa expression library with antibodies specific for cyanelle FNR. The 1.4 kb transcript was derived from a single-copy gene. The precursor (41 kDa) and mature forms (34 kDa) of FNR were identified by western blotting of in vitro translation products and cyanelle extracts, respectively. The derived amino acid sequence of the mature form was corroborated by data from N-terminal protein sequencing and yielded identity scores from 58% to 62% upon comparison with cyanobacterial FNRs. Sequence conservation seemed to be even more pronounced in comparison with enzymes from higher plants, but using the neighbor joining method the C. paradoxa sequence was clearly positioned between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic sequences. The transit peptide of 65 or 66 amino acids appeared to be totally unrelated to those from spinach, pea and ice plant but showed overall characteristics of stroma-targeting peptides.
