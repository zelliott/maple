The expression of human papillomavirus type 16 late genes encoding virus capsid proteins L1 and L2 is restricted to terminally differentiated epithelial cells in the superficial layers of the squamous epithelium. We wish to understand the molecular mechanisms that determine the levels of expression of the human papillomavirus type 16 late genes. We have previously shown that the L1 coding region contains inhibitory sequences. Here we extend previous findings to show that the 5' end of the L1 gene contains strong inhibitory sequences but that the 3' end does not. We show that the first 514 nucleotides of the L1 coding region contain multiple inhibitory elements that act independently of one another and that the major inhibitory element is located within the first 129 nucleotides of the L1 gene. Introduction of point mutations in the inhibitory elements in the 5' end of the L1 gene which altered the RNA sequence without affecting the protein sequence specifically inactivated the inhibitory elements and resulted in production of high levels of human papillomavirus type 16 L1 mRNA and protein in human epithelial cells. Furthermore, we show that inhibitory sequences are present in the L1 coding regions of multiple human papillomavirus types, demonstrating that these elements are conserved among the human papillomaviruses, and suggest that they have an important function in the viral life cycle.
