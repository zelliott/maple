Enteritis induced by non-typhoid pathogenic Salmonella is characterized by fluid secretion and inflammatory responses in the infected ileum. The inflammatory response provoked by Salmonella initially consists largely of a neutrophil (PMN) migration into the intestinal mucosa and the gut lumen. The interactions between Salmonella and intestinal epithelial cells are known to play an essential role in inducing the inflammatory response. Upon interaction with epithelial cells salmonellae are able to elicit transepithelial signalling to neutrophils. This signalling is recognized as a key virulence feature underlying Salmonella-induced enteritis. However, the nature and mechanism of such signalling has not been clarified to date. Here, we characterize SopB, a novel secreted effector protein of Salmonella dublin, and present data implying that SopB is translocated into eukaryotic cells via a sip-dependent pathway to promote fluid secretion and inflammatory responses in the infected ileum.
