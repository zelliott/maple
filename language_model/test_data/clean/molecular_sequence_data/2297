Two reactive sequences of the pre-S regions of hepatitis B surface antigen were synthesized chemically and used in micro-ELISAs for the assay of pre-S1 and pre-S2 antigens in serum from patients with acute and chronic hepatitis B. Pre-S1 antigen correlated well with the presence of HBV-DNA and was no longer detectable on cessation of viral replication, after natural recovery and after successful treatment with alpha-interferon. Pre-S2 proteins were also lost after treatment with alpha-interferon. The results show that the assay of pre-S1 and pre-S2 proteins in serum provides additional useful markers for assessing patients with acute and chronic hepatitis B infection and for monitoring the response to treatment with interferon.
