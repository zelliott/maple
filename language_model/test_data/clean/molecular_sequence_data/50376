An Escherichia coli chromosomal DNA fragment cloned on a multicopy plasmid conferred resistance to carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, nalidixic acid, and a number of other toxic compounds. The sequence of the cloned emr locus located at minute 57.5 of the chromosome revealed two open reading frames, emrA and emrB. emrB encodes a highly hydrophobic 56.2-kDa peptide, with 14 potential alpha-helices to span the inner membrane. The peptide is homologous to QacA, a multidrug-resistant pump from Staphylococcus aureus, and belongs to a gene family that includes tetracycline-resistant pumps of Gram-positive bacteria and the galactose/H+ symporter of E. coli. emrA encodes a putative 42.7-kDa peptide containing a single hydrophobic domain and a large C-terminal hydrophilic domain. An active pho-fusion to the C domain suggested that EmrA is a membrane protein. Disruption of emrB significantly increased sensitivity of cells to uncouplers. The cellular content of uncoupler increased in the order: overexpressed emrB cells greater than wild type greater than emrB-.
