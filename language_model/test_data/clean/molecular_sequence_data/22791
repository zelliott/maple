We have shown that a COOH-terminal peptide of p53 (amino acids 361-382, p53p), linked to the truncated homeobox domain of Antennapedia (Ant) as a carrier for transduction, induced rapid apoptosis in human premalignant and malignant cell lines. Here, we report that human and rat glioma lines containing endogenous mutant p53 or wild-type (WT) p53 were induced into apoptosis by exposure to this peptide called p53p-Ant. The peptide was comparatively nontoxic to proliferating nonmalignant human and rat glial cell lines containing WT p53 and proliferating normal human peripheral marrow blood stem cells. Degree of sensitivity to the peptide correlated directly with the level of endogenous p53 expression and mutant p53 conformation. Apoptosis induction by p53p-Ant was quantitated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay and Annexin V staining in human glioma cells in vitro and in a syngeneic orthotopic 9L glioma rat model using convection-enhanced delivery in vivo. The mechanism of cell death by this peptide was solely through the Fas extrinsic apoptotic pathway. p53p-Ant induced a 3-fold increase in extracellular membrane Fas expression in glioma cells but no significant increase in nonmalignant glial cells. These data suggest that p53 function for inducing Fas-mediated apoptosis in gliomas, which express sufficient quantities of endogenous mutant or WT p53, may be restored or activated, respectively, by a cell-permeable peptide derived from the p53 COOH-terminal regulatory domain (p53p-Ant). p53p-Ant may serve as a prototypic model for the development of new anticancer agents with unique selectivity for glioma cancer cells and it can be successfully delivered in vivo into a brain tumor by a convection-enhanced delivery system, which circumvents the blood-brain barrier.
