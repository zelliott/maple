Peptides derived from the N- (N-HR) and C- (C-HR) terminal heptad repeat regions adjacent to the fusion peptide and transmembrane domains, respectively, of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 gp41 inhibit HIV-1 viral envelope glycoproteins (Env)-mediated cell fusion specifically. The mechanism of HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion and its inhibition by agents that target the N- and C-HR regions was investigated. Priming experiments with Env-expressing cells indicate that the N-HR region but not the C-HR region is exposed by treatment with sCD4 at 31 degrees C, whereas both the N- and C-HR regions are exposed at 37 degrees C.
