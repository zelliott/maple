Pools of mosquitoes were tested for insect-specific viruses using cytopathic effect (CPE) assays on Aedes albopictus (C6/36) cells. Illumina sequencing of RNA from pool TR7094, which produced extensive CPE 2 days post-infection, yielded the complete genome sequences of a previously unknown Bunyavirus, designated Cumuto virus (CUMV), and a second virus designated Wallerfield virus (WALV). WALV shared highest amino acid identity (60.1 %) with Dezidougou virus from Côte d'Ivoire, a positive-sense, single-strand RNA, insect-specific virus belonging to the newly proposed genus Negevirus associated with mosquitoes and phlebotomine sandflies. The S, M and L segments of CUMV were most closely related to those of Gouleako virus, also from Côte d'Ivoire (amino acid identities of 36 %, 38% and 54 % respectively). Neither virus produced CPE on vertebrate cells, or illness in newborn mice. Isolation and characterization of these viruses increase our knowledge of the geographical distribution, diversity and host range of mosquito-specific bunyaviruses and negeviruses.
