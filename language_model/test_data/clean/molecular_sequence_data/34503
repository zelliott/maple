Isolate KH was obtained from Hawaiian forest soil and found to be composed of two functionally linked anaerobes, KHa and KHb. Gene analyses (16S rRNA, fhs, cooS) identified KHa as an acetogenic strain of Clostridium glycolicum and KHb as Bacteroides xylanolyticus. KHb fermented xylan and other saccharides that KHa could not utilize and formed products (e.g., ethanol and H(2)) that supported the acetogenic growth of KHa.
