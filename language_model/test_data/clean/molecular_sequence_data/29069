Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) plays a key role in control of coagulation and tissue remodeling and has been shown to be regulated by a number of cell stimuli, among those hypoxia. In this study we characterize the hypoxia-mediated induction of PAI-1 in human hepatoma cell line HepG2. We found that PAI-1 is tightly regulated in a narrow oxygen gradient. After incubation at oxygen concentrations of 1% to 2%, a 60-fold increase in PAI-1 messenger RNA levels was observed, whereas mild hypoxic conditions of more than 3.5% did not appear to induce transcription. Moreover, increased levels of PAI-1 protein were observed after incubation at low oxygen tensions. Through sequence analysis, several putative hypoxia-response elements (HREs 1-5) were identified in the human PAI-I promoter. Reporter gene assays showed that the HRE-2 (-194 to -187) was necessary and sufficient for the hypoxia-mediated response. By electrophoretic mobility assay we observed hypoxia-dependent binding of a protein complex to the HRE-2 motif. Further analysis demonstrated that HRE-2 was specifically recognized by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1alpha-arylhydrocarbon nuclear translocator complex. Taken together, our data demonstrate that hypoxia-induced transcription is mediated through HIF-1 interaction with the HRE-2 site of the human PAI-1 promoter.
