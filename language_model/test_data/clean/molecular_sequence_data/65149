Satellite tobacco necrosis virus (STNV) RNA is naturally uncapped at its 5' end and lacks polyadenylation at its 3' end. Despite lacking these two hallmarks of eukaryotic mRNAs, STNV-1 RNA is translated very efficiently. A approximately 130-nucleotide translational enhancer (TED), located 3' to the termination codon, is necessary for efficient cap-independent translation of STNV-1 RNA. The STNV-1 TED RNA fragment binds to the eukaryotic cap-binding complexes, initiation factor (eIF) 4F and eIF(iso)4F, as measured by nitrocellulose binding and fluorescence titration. STNV-1 TED is a potent inhibitor of in vitro translation when added in trans. This inhibition is reversed by the addition of eIF4F or eIF(iso)4F, and the subunits of eIF4F and eIF(iso)4F cross-link to STNV-1 TED, providing additional evidence that these factors interact directly with STNV-1 TED. Deletion mutagenesis of the STNV-1 TED indicates that a minimal region of approximately 100 nucleotides is necessary to promote cap-independent translation primarily through interaction with the cap binding subunits (eIF4E or eIF(iso)4E) of eIF4F or eIF(iso)4F.
