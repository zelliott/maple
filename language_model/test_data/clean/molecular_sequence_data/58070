Syndecan-1, the prototype of a family of heparan sulfate-containing integral membrane proteoglycans, associates extracellularly with a variety of matrix molecules and growth factors and intracellularly with the actin cytoskeleton. Expressed constitutively on epithelia in mature tissues and in a developmentally regulated manner on epithelial and induced mesenchymal cells during embryogenesis, syndecan-1 appears to be involved in controlling the shape and organization of cells and tissues. To better understand the function and regulation of syndecan-1, we determined the structure of the mouse syndecan-1 gene (Synd-1). Synd-1 is approximately 19.5 kilobases in size and is organized into five exons that appear conserved in other family members. Exon 1 encodes the signal peptide; exon 2, the N-terminal glycosaminoglycan attachment region; exon 3, the bulk of the extracellular domain; exon 4, the protease-susceptible site; and exon 5, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains which are highly homologous between syndecan family members. Synd-1 has three transcriptional start sites, two polyadenylation sites, and is not alternatively spliced to produce its 2.6- and 3.4-kilobase mRNA species. Upstream sequences have promoter activity and contain TATA and CAAT boxes as well as a variety of other potential binding sites for transcription factors, including Sp1 (GC box), NF-kappa B, MyoD (E box), and Antennapedia. The structure of the promoter region suggests that control of Synd-1 expression is both constitutive and developmentally regulated. Because Synd-1 exons encode discrete functional domains of the syndecan-1 protein that are conserved throughout the syndecan family, all syndecan genes are likely derived from a common ancestor.
