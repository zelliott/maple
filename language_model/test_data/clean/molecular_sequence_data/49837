Thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) has recently been identified as a positive acute phase protein in mice, an observation that may have important implications for the interaction of the coagulation, fibrinolytic, and inflammatory systems. Activated TAFI (TAFIa) inhibits fibrinolysis by removing the carboxyl-terminal lysines from partially degraded fibrin that are important for maximally efficient plasminogen activation. In addition, TAFIa has been shown to be capable of removing the carboxyl-terminal arginine residues from the anaphylatoxins and bradykinin, thus implying a role for the TAFI pathway in the vascular responses to inflammation. In the current study, we investigated the ability of acute phase mediators to modulate human TAFI gene expression in cultured human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. Surprisingly, we found that treatment of HepG2 cells with a combination of interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 suppressed endogenous TAFI mRNA abundance in HepG2 cells (~60% decrease), while treatment with IL-1 or IL-6 alone had no effect. Treatment with IL-1 and/or IL-6 had no effect on TAFI promoter activity as measured using a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the human TAFI 5'-flanking region, whereas treatment with IL-1 and IL-6 in combination, but not alone, decreased the stability of the endogenous TAFI mRNA. Treatment with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone resulted in a 2-fold increase of both TAFI mRNA levels and promoter activity. We identified a functional glucocorticoid response element (GRE) in the human TAFI promoter between nucleotides 92 and 78. The GRE was capable of binding the glucocorticoid receptor, as assessed by gel mobility shift assays, and mutation of this element markedly decreased the ability of the TAFI promoter to be activated by dexamethasone.
