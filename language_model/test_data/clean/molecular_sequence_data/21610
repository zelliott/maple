A novel cellulolytic bacterium was isolated from the forest soil of KNU University campus. Through 16S rRNA sequence matching and morphological observation it was identified as Nocardiopsis sp. KNU. This strain can utilize a broad range of cellulosic substrates including: carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), avicel, xylan, cellobiose, filter paper and rice straw by producing a large amount of thermoalkalotolerant endoglucanase, exoglucanase, xylanase and glucoamylase. Optimal culture conditions (Dubos medium, 37°C, pH 6.5 and static condition) for the maximal production of the cellulolytic enzymes were determined. The activity of cellulolytic and hemicelluloytic enzymes produced by this strain was mainly present extracellularly and the enzyme production was dependent on the cellulosic substrates used for the growth. Effect of physicochemical conditions and metal additives on the cellulolytic enzymes production were systematically investigated. The cellulases produced by Nocardiopsis sp. KNU have an optimal temperature of 40°C and pH of 5.0. These cellulases also have high thermotolerance as evidenced by retaining 55-70% activity at 80°C and pH of 5.0 and alkalotolerance by retaining >55% of the activity at pH 10 and 40°C after 1 h. The efficiency of fermentative conversion of the hydrolyzed rice straw by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (KCTC-7296) resulted in 64% of theoretical ethanol yield.
