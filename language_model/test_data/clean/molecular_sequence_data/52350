The GTP-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) that transduce signals from receptors to effectors are composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. Whereas the role of alpha subunits in directly regulating effector activity is widely accepted, it has recently been demonstrated that beta gamma subunits may also directly regulate effector activity. This has made clear the importance of identifying and characterizing beta and gamma subunits. We have isolated a cDNA clone encoding a new gamma subunit, referred to here as the gamma 7 subunit, using probes based on peptide sequences of a gamma subunit previously purified from bovine brain. The clone contains a 1.47-kilobase cDNA insert, which includes an open reading frame of 204 base pairs that predicts a 68-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated M(r) of 7553. The predicted protein shares amino acid identities with the other known gamma subunits, ranging from 38 to 68%. Also characteristic of gamma subunits is a carboxyl-terminal CAAX motif. The expression of the gamma 7 subunit as well as the gamma 2, gamma 3, and gamma 5 subunits was examined in several bovine tissues at both the mRNA and protein levels. Whereas the gamma 2 and gamma 3 subunits were selectively expressed in brain, the gamma 5 and gamma 7 subunits were expressed in a variety of tissues. Thus, the gamma 5 and gamma 7 subunits are the first G protein gamma subunits known that could participate in the regulation of widely distributed signal transduction pathways.
