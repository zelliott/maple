The etiology of bovine ulcerative mammary dermatitis (UMD) is poorly characterized. The goal of this study was to genetically analyze spirochetes present in UMD lesions. DNA prepared from UMD lesion biopsies and from spirochetes cultured from the corresponding lesion biopsies was PCR amplified using primers for the 16S rDNA-tRNA(ile) intergenic spacer region (ISR) of Treponema 16S-23S rDNA. Analysis of cloned ISR amplicons from three cultivable UMD-associated spirochetes indicated that two isolates cluster closely with cultivable papillomatous digital dermatitis (PDD)-associated and human-associated Treponema phylotypes, while the remaining isolate is unique. Analysis of ISR amplicons from UMD lesion biopsies identified additional not-yet-cultivable Treponema phylotypes. Our results revealed the presence of a genetically diverse Treponema population in an UMD lesion.
