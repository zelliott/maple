Structural models of the variable domains of the murine anti-2-phenyloxazolone IgG (Ox1 idiotype) and its somatic variant, which has higher affinity to the hapten 2-phenyloxazolone, were constructed by computer-aided model building using known structures of highly homologous immunoglobulins as templates. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to dock the hapten between the VL and VH domains. The hapten is predicted to bind to slightly different sites in the two models. Hypotheses concerning the role of a number of preferred mutations in anti-oxazolone variants are presented. These can be tested by mutagenesis and crystallography. In particular, the higher binding affinities of the different antibody variants are shown to correlate with better complementarity of electrostatics. The molecular dynamic simulations also suggest that two mobile tryptophans at the mouth of the pocket may play an important role in the binding of hapten.
