We recently reported that H-Lys psi (CH2NH)Lys-Pro-Tyr-Ile-Leu-OH (JMV 449), a pseudopeptide analogue of neurotensin-(8-13) with a reduced CH2NH bond in position 8-9, was about 3 times more potent than neurotensin in binding to mouse brain membranes and in contracting the guinea-pig ileum, and was markedly more resistant to degradation than neurotensin when exposed to rat brain membranes. In the present study, we compared the time courses and dose-response relationships for the ability of i.c.v. injected neurotensin and JMV 449 to elicit hypothermia and analgesia (tail-flick test) in the mouse. The results show that the pseudopeptide analogue behaved as a highly potent and long-lasting neurotensin agonist in these two in vivo bioassays. The analogue should prove very useful for studying the effects of chronic neurotensin receptor stimulation in vitro and in vivo.
