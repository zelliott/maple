Tektins are a class of proteins that form filamentous polymers in the walls of ciliary and flagellar microtubules. We report here the molecular cloning of a new member of the tektin family, tektin-t, identified from a mouse haploid germ cell-specific cDNA library. Tektin-t mRNA encodes a protein of 430 deduced amino acids possessing RSNVELCRD, the conserved sequence of tektin family proteins. Western blotting showed a single band having a molecular weight of 86 kDa in the mouse testis. Immunohistochemistry of the testis showed that tektin-t is localized in the flagella of elongating spermatids from developmental step 15 to maturity.
