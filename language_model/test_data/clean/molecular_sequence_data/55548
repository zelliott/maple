Here we report the complete genome sequence of the Mycobacterium intracellulare clinical strain MOTT-36Y, previously grouped into the INT5 genotype among the 5 genotypes of M. intracellulare. This genome sequence will serve as a valuable reference for understanding the disparity in virulence and epidemiologic traits between M. intracellulare-related strains.
