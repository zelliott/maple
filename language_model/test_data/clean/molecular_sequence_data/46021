The serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family plays an important role in constitutive and alternative splicing (AS). These proteins regulate AS in a tissue-specific and stress-responsive manner. Pre-mRNAs encoding SR proteins are often alternatively spliced, and these AS events may be important for the regulation of AS events of other pre-mRNAs. In this study, we analyzed AS events of SR proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (rice). We found three sets of AS events conserved between Arabidopsis and rice. These conserved AS events were found in the plant-novel-SR protein, SC35-like (SCL), and two-Zn-knuckles-type 9G8 subfamilies. Each member of these subfamilies has at least one RNA recognition motif (RRM) and at least one intron in the RRM-encoded region. We found that the conserved AS events occurred in these introns and, in each case, the conserved AS events resulted in mature mRNAs encoding proteins with incomplete RRMs. To search for the evolutionary origin of these AS events, we analyzed SR proteins in Physcomitrella patens (moss) in addition to those in Arabidopsis and rice. We found moss homologues of the plant-novel-SR protein, SCL, and the two-Zn-knuckles-type 9G8 subfamilies in silico, and these homologues have long introns at the same location of the conserved AS sites in Arabidopsis and rice. Such long introns are quite specific for alternatively spliced introns concerning the Arabidopsis SR protein genes. The long introns found in the moss SR protein genes strongly suggested that conserved AS events in moss SR protein genes might be similar to those in Arabidopsis and rice. We traced the evolutionary origin of the conserved AS events to 400 MYA, when plants first invaded land. These events are likely important in the regulation of whole AS events and likely contribute to the complicated transcriptome described by AS. The complicated transcriptome created by regulated AS events might have provided plants tolerance against droughts or temperature shifts and given them the ability to live on land.
