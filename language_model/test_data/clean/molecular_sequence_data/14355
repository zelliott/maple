The MHC class I-A and -B genes of cynomolgus macaques are highly polymorphic. These genes encode proteins presenting peptides to CD8+ T cells to initiate adaptive immune response. Recombination events are one way the diversity of these alleles can be increased. Such events have been well characterized in humans, but have not been as well characterized in macaques. In order to identify and examine recombinations that create new alleles, it is important to analyze intron sequences. Intron sequences have been shown to be important to understand the evolutionary mechanisms involved in the generation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alleles and loci. Thus far, there have been relatively few intron sequences reported for MHC class I alleles in macaques, and this has hampered the understanding of MHC organization and evolution in macaques. In this study, we present evidence of a gene conversion event generating the Mafa-B*099 allele lineage by the combination of Mafa-B*054 and Mafa-B*095 allele lineages. A potential recombination between the Mafa-A3*13 and Mafa-A4:14 lineages was also observed, but it is less clear due to lack of intron 2 sequence. This report stresses the role that recombination can play in MHC class I diversity in cynomologus macaques, and the importance of introns in identifying and analyzing such events.
