Recent advances in molecular biology have allowed the study of the candidate genes for essential hypertension. To identify the genes responsible for basal blood pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat strain, the rat model of genetic hypertension, we performed a cosegregation analysis between the genotype and blood pressure in a set of male F2 progeny obtained from SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats, a reference normotensive strain. Our investigation revealed that a locus on the chromosome 4 cosegregates with the blood pressure in SHR, especially at neuropeptide Y locus. The degree of cosegregation with all values of blood pressure without sodium loading was moderate but consistent. We propose that neuropeptide Y locus on chromosome 4 is a new candidate for the hypertensive effect in original SHR.
