The plasma of the crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus contains a protein which is able to bind to laminarin (a soluble beta-1,3-glucan) and which has been isolated by two independent methods, affinity precipitation with a beta-1,3-glucan or immunoaffinity chromatography. The purified beta-1,3-glucan binding protein was homogenous as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It is a monomeric glycoprotein with a molecular mass of approximately 100,000 Da and an isoelectric point of approximately 5.0. Amino acid analysis showed a very high similarity with the amino acid composition of beta-1,3-glucan binding proteins recently purified from two insects, the cockroach Blaberus craniifer and the silkworm Bombyx mori. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined to be: H2N-Asp-Ala-Gly-X-Ala-Ser-Leu-Val-Thr-Asn-Phe-Asn-Ser-Ala-Lys-Leu-X-X-Ly s--- Using monospecific rabbit polyclonal antibodies, the presence of this protein has also been shown within the blood cells. The purified beta-1,3-glucan binding protein did not show any peptidase or phenoloxidase activity but was able to enhance the activation of hemocyte-derived peptidase and prophenoloxidase only in the presence of the beta-1,3-glucan, laminarin, whereas mannan, dextran (alpha-glucan), or cellulose (beta-1,4-glucan) incubated with the beta-1,3-glucan binding protein had no effect on these enzyme activities. The beta-1,3-glucan binding protein could only be affinity-precipitated from crayfish plasma by the beta-1,3-glucans laminarin or curdlan (an insoluble beta-1,3-glucan), while mannan or dextran did not bind to the beta-1,3-glucan binding protein. No hemagglutinating activity of the purified beta-1,3-glucan binding protein could be detected.
