We have characterized the distribution, expression, and hormonal regulation of gap junctions in primary cultures of rat osteoblast-like cells (ROBs), and three osteosarcoma cell lines, ROS 17/2.8, UMR-106, and SAOS-2, and a continuous osteoblastic cell line, MC3T3-E1. All cell lines we examined were functionally coupled. ROS 17/2.8 were the more strongly coupled, while ROB and MC3T3-E1 were moderately coupled and UMR-106 and SAOS-2 were weakly coupled. Exposure to parathyroid hormone (PTH) for 1 h increased functional coupling in ROB cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, PTH(3-34), an analog of PTH with binds to the PTH receptor and thus attenuates PTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation, also attenuated PTH-stimulated functional coupling in ROB. This suggests that PTH increases functional coupling partly through a cAMP-dependent mechanism. A 1 h exposure to PTH did not affect coupling in ROS 17/2.8, UMR-106, MC3T3-E1, or SAOS-2. To examine whether connexin43 (Cx43), a specific gap junction protein, is present in functionally coupled osteoblastic cells, we characterized Cx43 distribution and expression. Indirect immunofluorescence with antibodies to Cx43 revealed that ROS 17/2.8, ROB, and to a lesser extent MC3T3-E1 and UMR-106, expressed Cx43 immunoreactivity. SAOS-2 showed little if any Cx43 immunoreactivity. Cx43 mRNA and Cx43 protein were detected by Northern blot analysis and immunoblot analysis, respectively, in all cell lines examined, including SAOS-2. Our findings suggest that acute exposure to PTH regulates gap junction coupling, in a cell-line dependent manner, in osteoblastic cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
