The complete nucleotide sequence was determined for a cryptic plasmid, pTIW94, recovered from several Campylobacter jejuni isolates from wild birds in the southeastern United States. pTIW94 is a circular molecule of 3860 nucleotides, with a G+C content (31.0%) similar to that of many Campylobacter spp. genomes. A typical origin of replication, with iteron sequences, was identified upstream of DNA sequences that demonstrated similarity to replication initiation proteins. A total of five open reading frames (ORFs) were identified; two of the five ORFs demonstrated significant similarity to plasmid pCC2228-2 found within Campylobacter coli. These two ORFs were similar to essential replication proteins RepA (100%; 26/26 aa identity) and RepB (95%; 327/346 aa identity). A third identified ORF demonstrated significant similarity (99%; 421/424 aa identity) to the MOB protein from C. coli 67-8, originally recovered from swine. The other two identified ORFs were either similar to hypothetical proteins from other Campylobacter spp., or exhibited no significant similarity to any DNA or protein sequence in the GenBank database. Promoter regions (-35 and -10 signal sites), ribosomal binding sites upstream of ORFs, and stem-loop structures were also identified within the plasmid. These results demonstrate that pTIW94 represents a previously un-reported small cryptic plasmid with unique sequences as well as highly similar sequences to other small plasmids found within Campylobacter spp., and that this cryptic plasmid is present among Campylobacter spp. recovered from different genera of wild birds.
