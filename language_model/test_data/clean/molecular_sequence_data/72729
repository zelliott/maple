Three constitutive forms of cytochrome P-450 (P-450s) were isolated from olfactory microsomes of cattle. The purified P-450s, designated P-450bov1, P-450bov2 and P-450bov3, were electrophoretically nearly homogeneous by SDS/PAGE and their apparent relative molecular masses were estimated to be 50000, 53000 and 51000 respectively. As indicated by several criteria including the N-terminal sequence and absorption spectra, the three olfactory forms of P-450 were distinct from each other and from all the other P-450s currently known in cattle. P-450bov1 and P-450bov2 were purified in the low-spin state, whereas P-450bov3 was in the high-spin state. Studies to evaluate, by Western blot analysis, the reactivity of these purified P-450s with antibodies raised against rat hepatic P-450 2E1, 2B, 1A and 3A and rabbit olfactory P-450NMa and P-450NMb showed that P-450bov3 strongly cross-reacted with anti-P-450NMb IgG, and P-450bov1 moderately with anti-P-450NMa IgG. As determined by immunoblots, P-450bov1 and P-450bov3 represented a great portion of the total olfactory P-450. In a reconstituted system with NADPH:cytochrome P-450 reductase and phospholipids, P-450bov1 was more active in the metabolism of xenobiotic compounds (i.e. O-de-ethylation of ethoxycoumarin and N-demethylation of hexamethylphosphoramide) than towards endogenous substrates (testosterone and progesterone). Conversely, P-450bov3 metabolized the xenobiotics at lower rates but exhibited total oxidation rates of the above sex hormones higher than those of P-450bov1. From the comparison of the catalytic, immunochemical and structural properties, it was inferred that P-450bov1 and P-450bov3 are the bovine orthologues of P-450NMa (2A) and P-450NMb (2G1) respectively, the only two olfactory P-450s previously purified from rabbit. P-450bov2, which showed low activity toward some exogenous and endogenous compounds, represents a novel purified olfactory hemoprotein possibly belonging to the 3A subfamily. These results are consistent with a specific presence of catalytically and structurally similar P-450s, at least for the major ones, in the olfactory mucosa of mammals.
