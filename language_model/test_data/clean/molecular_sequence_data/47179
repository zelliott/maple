To determine the prevalence of TT virus (TTV) and GB virus C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C) infections among patients with liver disease and the general population in Shanghai, China, we studied 90 patients with liver diseases (acute hepatitis, 28; chronic hepatitis, 27; liver cirrhosis, 20; hepatocellular carcinoma, 15) and 90 age, sex matched healthy blood donors as controls. There were no significant differences in the clinical and demographic characteristics between the two groups, except for liver function test values. There was a statistical difference between the patient group and the control group with regard to the prevalence of TTV DNA (23.5% in patient group, 11.1% in control group, P < 0.05), although no differences in clinical features could be found between TTV DNA-positive and negative subjects. Also, no differences in TTV DNA prevalence among various categories of liver diseases were noted (P = NS). The prevalence of HBsAg was significantly different between the patient group (36.7%) and the control group (3.3%) (P0.01), whereas the prevalence of anti-HCV and GBV-C RNA were not significantly different between the two groups. The nucleotide sequences were determined in the TTV DNA-positive samples and evaluated using phylogenetic analysis which suggested that they could be divided into two main genotypes designated as genotype 1 and 2. There were five samples clustered into 3 hitherto unknown subtypes of genotype 2. We concluded that (1) although TTV infection is widespread among both groups and there is a statistical difference of TTV infection between them, no hepatic damaging evidence and correlation with certain liver disease could be found in this study, suggest that TTV may not be major cause of liver disease, (2) GBV-C infection is frequent, but the virus is not the cause of liver diseases, and (3) new subtypes of TTV may exist in Shanghai, China.
