Eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 4A (eIF-4A), a 46-kDa polypeptide, is involved both in mRNA cap recognition and in the binding of mRNA to 40S ribosomal subunits. A 41-mer oligodeoxynucleotide probe was synthesized complementary to a portion of the published coding sequence of eIF-4A mRNA [Nielsen et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 13 (1985) 6867-6870] and used to screen a mouse genomic library. We have isolated and characterized a full-length clone from that library. The eIF-4A sequence is contained in eleven exons. The eleventh exon also has the 3'-nontranslated sequence and two separate polyadenylation sites. Northern-blot analysis of mouse poly(A)+RNA indicates that there are several distinct mRNA species coding for eIF-4A. Two of these contain the same coding sequence and differ only in the length of the 3'-nontranslated region. Two of the eIF-4A mRNAs are therefore likely to be the result of differential processing at the 3'-end. We have used a fragment of the genomic clone to measure the steady-state levels of eIF-4A mRNA during the induced differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells. S1 nuclease protection experiments demonstrated that by the fourth day after induction eIF-4A mRNA declined to 25% of its steady-state level in uninduced cells. In contrast, the steady-state level of beta-globin mRNA increased dramatically during differentiation. In vitro transcription assays using nuclei isolated from uninduced and induced cells show that the rate of transcription of eIF-4A mRNA was 40% greater in differentiated cells, indicating a posttranscriptional component is involved in the regulation of the steady-state mRNA level.
