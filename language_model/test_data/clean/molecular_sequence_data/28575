The G-protein regulatory (GPR) motif, a conserved 25-30 amino acid domain found in multiple mammalian proteins, stabilizes the GDP-bound conformation of Galpha(i), inhibits guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPgammaS) binding to Galpha(i) and competes for Gbetagamma binding to Galpha. To define the core GPR motif and key amino acid residues within a GPR peptide (TMGEEDFFDLLAKSQSKRMDDQRVDLAG), we determined the effect of truncation, insertion, and alanine substitutions on peptide-mediated inhibition of GTPgammaS binding to purified Galpha(i1). The bioactive core GPR peptide consists of 17 amino acids ((7)F-R(23)). Within this core motif, two hydrophobic sectors ((7)FF(8) and (10)LL(11)) and Q(22) are required for bioactivity, whereas M19A and R23A increased IC(50) values by 70-fold. Disruption of spatial relationships between the required sectors in the amino and carboxyl regions of the peptide also resulted in a loss of biological activity. Mutation of three charged sectors ((4)EED(6), R(18), (20)DD(21)) within the 28-amino acid GPR decreased peptide affinity by approximately 10-fold. Alanine substitutions of selected residues within the core GPR peptide differently influenced peptide inhibition of GTPgammaS binding to Galpha(i) versus Galpha(o). These data provide a platform for the development of novel, G-protein-selective therapeutics that inhibit Galpha(i)- mediated signaling, selectively activate Gbetagamma-sensitive effectors, and/or disrupt specific regulatory input to G-proteins mediated by GPR-containing proteins.
