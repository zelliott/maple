Fragments of chromosomal DNA isolated from nuclear envelopes of mouse hepatocytes were previously cloned and partially characterized in our laboratory. One of the cloned fragments (EnvM4) had unusual characteristics: abundant representability in the clone library (about 50%) and homology with DNA of archebacteria. An analysis of nucleotide sequence of this fragment conducted in more detail allowed the detection of an evolutionary conserved region present in the genomes of various organisms (from bacteria to human). Other characteristics of fragment EnvM4 suggest a possible functional role of chromosomal DNA regions determining the attachment of chromosomes to the nuclear envelope.
