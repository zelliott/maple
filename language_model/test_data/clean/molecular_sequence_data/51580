Biotinylated chromosome-specific probes were prepared from flow-sorted pig chromosomes 1, 13, 18, X, and Y using the degenerate oligonucleotide-primed polymerase chain reaction. Probes prepared in this way can be used to confirm the identity of chromosomes in the bivariate pig flow karyotype and in pig x mouse somatic cell hybrids.
