We are investigating the genetic basis of morphological differences in skull shape between domestic dogs of different breeds using a candidate gene approach to identify genes involved in the genetic regulation. One such candidate is Fgf8. Fgf8 is a signalling molecule important in the embryonic development and patterning of the craniofacial region. Mice conditional null for the expression of Fgf8 after E9.5 have a short foreface and a wide skull (Trumpp et al. 1999). Using a combination of bioinformatics and PCR cloning, we have characterised the genomic loci of the canine Fgf8 gene. Like the mouse homologue, it is composed of six exons and we also predict that like the mouse, there are eight alternative isoforms that are generated by alternative splicing events. We have identified a short 200 bp sequence upstream of the Fgf8 gene that is highly conserved between species and have predicted putative transcription factor binding sites using the Transfac database. Genetic analysis of 4 dogs with different skull types identified genetic variation. None of the variants however, were predicted to have any functional significance.
