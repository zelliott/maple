The novel allele, B*5513, was identified from three siblings of a Korean family. Direct DNA sequencing analysis revealed that B*5513 differed from B*5502 by a single-nucleotide substitution at codon 116 (TTA-->TTC) resulting in an amino acid change from leucine to phenylalanine. This substitution altered serologic reactivity of the B55 molecule to B22-specific alloantisera.
