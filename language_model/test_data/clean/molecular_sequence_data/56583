CAMAL (common antigen of myelogenous acute leukemia) is an antigenic preparation isolated in this laboratory from the bone marrow or peripheral blood leucocytes of persons with myeloid leukemias and shown using an immunoperoxidase slide test to be diagnostic of these leukemias. Material further purified from CAMAL preparations, which migrates in the range of 30-35 kilodaltons (kDa) by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), which is referred to as P30-35 CAMAL, and was previously shown to be inhibitory to colony formation by progenitor cells from normal healthy human donors in vitro. This inhibitory activity was directed toward neutrophilic granulocyte colonies (CFU-G) in particular. We now report that P30-35 CAMAL is inhibitory to colony formation by murine progenitor cells in vitro. Colonies from P30-35 CAMAL-treated cultures of murine bone marrow cells were reduced in number and in size, an effect similar to that seen in cultures of human cells. As in assays using human cells, murine CFU-G appeared to be preferentially targeted by the inhibitory activity of P30-35 CAMAL. In addition, day 10 spleen colony formation was inhibited by P30-35 CAMAL in an ex vivo assay. Hence, the effects of P30-35 CAMAL on murine progenitor cells appear to parallel the effects observed using human cells. These observations support the possibility that CAMAL might be a regulatory protein in hematopoiesis which is conserved between species.
