A recently discovered enzyme in the mandelate pathway of Pseudomonas putida, mandelamide hydrolase (MAH), catalyzes the hydrolysis of mandelamide to mandelic acid and ammonia. Sequence analysis suggests that MAH is a member of the amidase signature family, which is widespread in nature and contains a novel Ser-cis-Ser-Lys catalytic triad. Here we report the expression in Escherichia coli, purification, and characterization of both wild-type and His(6)-tagged MAH. The recombinant enzyme was stable, exhibited a pH optimum of 7.8, and was able to hydrolyze both enantiomers of mandelamide with little enantiospecificity. The His-tagged variant showed no significant change in kinetic constants. Phenylacetamide was found to be the best substrate, with changes in chain length or replacement of the phenyl group producing greatly decreased values of k(cat)/K(m). As with another member of this family, fatty acid amide hydrolase, MAH has the uncommon ability to hydrolyze esters and amides at similar rates. MAH is even more unusual in that it will only hydrolyze esters and amides with little steric bulk. Ethyl and larger esters and N-ethyl and larger amides are not substrates, suggesting that the MAH active site is very sterically hindered. Mutation of each residue in the putative catalytic triad to alanine resulted in total loss of activity for S204A and K100A, while S180A exhibited a 1500-fold decrease in k(cat) and significant increases in K(m) values. Overall, the MAH data are similar to those of fatty acid amide hydrolase and support the suggestion that there are two distinct subgroups within the amidase signature family.
