The structures of the O-specific chains of the Hafnia alvei strain 744 and PCM strains 1194 and 1210 lipopolysaccharides have been investigated. Methylation analysis, dephosphorylation, NMR spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry and fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry were the principal methods used. It was concluded that the polysaccharides of strains 744 and PCM 1194 are composed of the same pentasaccharide repeating unit having the following structure: [structure in text] and that the polysaccharide of strain PCM 1210 is composed of a pentasaccharide repeating unit having the following structure: [structure in text].
