Cellular immune responses to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, particularly in vivo responses, have been difficult to study in large patient cohorts because of technical impediments. By use of small peptide fragments of the HIV-1 gp120 third variable loop, the CD4 T lymphocyte epitopes of 2 HIV-infected persons were mapped using a cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) assay. The in vivo DTH responses correlated with epitopes previously identified in vitro using CD4 T lymphocyte lines. The ability to determine CD4 T lymphocyte epitopes in large cohorts of patients using this simple in vivo technique would provide important diagnostic and prognostic data regarding effective immunoregulation of HIV-1. This technique should have broad applicability in HIV vaccine development and in the investigation of other immune-mediated human diseases.
