Previous restriction mapping studies (M.A. Mallamaci, D.P. Reed and S.A. Winkle, J. Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics, in press (1992)) have indicated that a small number of locations on the plasmid pBR322 may be high affinity binding sites for the carcinogen N-acetoxy-N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene (acetoxyAAF). PBR322 was reacted with acetoxyAAF to produce DNA with one, three or seven acetoxyAAF moieties per DNA molecule. Thus only the higher affinity binding sites are affected. Subsequent digestion with the restriction enzyme Hinf I produced fragments containing previously indicated locations of potential acetoxyAAF binding sites. Fragments thought not to contain binding sites were also examined as controls. The isolated fragments, singly 32P end-labeled, were digested with lambda exonuclease. The three fragments suspected of containing acetoxyAAF binding sites possess new lambda exonuclease inhibition sites when the fragments are obtained from acetoxyAAF reacted DNA. No such inhibition sites are found with the two fragments suggested previously not to contain acetoxyAAF binding sites. These carcinogen produced inhibition sites occur in sequences which are similar, suggesting that acetoxyAAF preferentially may target a small number of sequences.
