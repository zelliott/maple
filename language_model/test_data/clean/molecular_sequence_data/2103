A new secretion vector, pEAP84 which contained a unique restriction site (BglII) at the 3' end of the penicillinase gene to produce a fused protein, and the Ex-kil region to make the outer membrane permeable, was constructed from pEAP82. A recombinant plasmid p84h06, which contained a synthetic gene for human calcitonin with a cyanogen bromide cleavage site at the junction site of the fused protein, was constructed and introduced into Escherichia coli. The hybrid protein produced in E. coli carrying p84h06 was secreted into the culture medium. The amino acid composition of this product was consistent with that deduced from the DNA sequence. Mature calcitonin was obtained following cyanogen bromide cleavage of the fused protein.
