We recognized a common dimerization motif between the transmembrane (TM) domain of zeta-chain family members and glycophorin A. We have shown that a glycine within the zeta-dimerization motif is critical for zeta-homodimerization and also for its association with the TCR/CD3 complex. Similarly, two residues within the CD3 delta gamma TM domains have proven to be critical for their interaction with the zeta-homodimer. A three-dimensional homology model of the zeta-chain TM domain highlights potential residues preferentially involved either in the zeta 2-CD3 or zeta 2-TCR alpha beta association, confirming our experimental findings. These results indicate that, for symmetrical reasons, the zeta-homodimer participates in the TCR/CD3 complex assembly by interacting with CD3 gamma delta TM domains, thereby masking their degradation signals located in the cytoplasmic tails.
