Endo-Î²-N-Acetylglucosaminidases (ENGases) are highly useful biocatalysts that can be used to synthetically access a wide variety of defined homogenous N-linked glycoconjugates in a convergent manner. The synthetic efficiency of a selection of family GH85 ENGases was investigated as the structure of the acceptor substrate was varied. Several different GlcNAc-asparagine acceptors were synthesised, and used in conjunction with penta- and decasaccharide oxazoline donors. Different enzymes showed different tolerances of modification of the GlcNAc acceptor. Whilst none tolerated modification of either the 4- or 6-hydroxyl, both Endo M and Endo D tolerated modification of OH-3. For Endo D the achievable synthetic efficiency was increased by a factor of three by the use a 3-O-benzyl protected acceptor. The presence of a fucose at position-3 was not tolerated by any of the enzymes assayed.
