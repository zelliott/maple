Chitin catabolism in Vibrio furnissii comprises several signal transducing systems and many proteins. Two of these enzymes are periplasmic and convert chitin oligosaccharides to GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)2. One of these unique enzymes, a chitodextrinase, designated EndoI, is described here. The protein, isolated from a recombinant Escherichia coli clone, exhibited (via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) two enzymatically active, close running bands ( approximately mass of 120 kDa) with identical N-terminal sequences. The chitodextrinase rapidly cleaved chitin oligosaccharides, (GlcNAc)4 to (GlcNAc)2, and (GlcNAc)5,6 to (GlcNAc)2 and (GlcNAc)3. EndoI was substrate inhibited in the millimolar range and was inactive with chitin, glucosamine oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycopeptides containing (GlcNAc)2. The sequence of the cloned gene indicates that it encodes a 112,690-kDa protein (1046 amino acids). Both proteins lacked the predicted N-terminal 31 amino acids, corresponding to a consensus prokaryotic signal peptide. Thus, E. coli recognizes and processes this V. furnissii signal sequence. Although inactive with chitin, the predicted amino acid sequence of EndoI displayed similarities to many chitinases, with 8 amino acids completely conserved in 10 or more of the homologous proteins. There was, however, no "consensus" chitin-binding domain in EndoI.
