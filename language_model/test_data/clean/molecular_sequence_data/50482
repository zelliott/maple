Transcription of a calcium and zinc binding, nervous system-specific cell adhesion glycoprotein, ependymin, in goldfish leptomeninx was significantly enhanced after active avoidance conditioning, followed by enhanced translation and secretion. Inactivation of secreted ependymin by injected antisera interfered with behavioral adaptations. In addition to the site of synthesis in reticular cells of the leptomeninx electronmicroscopic immunochemistry localized the protein to tectal neurons of the superficial plexiform and the periventricular cell layers. Detection of ependymin in cells where it is not synthesized, namely in neurons, suggests a re-uptake during functional activity of the CNS and assigns a pivotal role to the cerebrospinal and interstitial brain fluids for the distribution of protein factors that support axonal growth and neuronal plasticity.
