The human smooth muscle myosin heavy chain locus (MYH11) was mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization to the middle of the p arm of chromosome 16 using a genomic cosmid clone containing coding sequences of the gene as probe. Probe from coding sequence, when applied to Southern blots of a panel of hybrids containing different portions of human chromosome 16, localized the gene to 16p13.13-13.12. Coding sequence PCR primers, when used on the DNA from a CHO-mouse hybrid clone mapping panel informative for mouse chromosomes, showed that the gene was located on mouse chromosome 16. These results correct a recent assignment of MYH11 from 16q12.2 to the region of the 16p-arm inversion breakpoint seen in acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMML) M4Eo and demonstrate that the conflicting data do not result from the presence of additional MYH genes on the q arm of the chromosome. Also, a new region of conserved synteny between human 16p and mouse 16 is established.
