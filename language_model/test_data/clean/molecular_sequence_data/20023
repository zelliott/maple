Here, we describe a cell-based in vivo assay that probes the specific interaction between nucleocapsid (NC) protein and Psi (Psi) RNA, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) packaging signal. The results demonstrate for the first time a specific NC-Psi interaction within living cells. The specificity and applicability of the assay were confirmed by mutational studies of NC and deletion-mapping analyses of Psi-RNA as well as by testing the in vivo NC-binding effects of NC-aptamer RNAs identified previously in vitro. This assay system would facilitate further detailed studies of the NC-Psi interaction in vivo and the screening of various anti-HIV molecules targeting NC and the specific interaction.
