Arboviruses with genomes composed of 12 segments of double-stranded (ds) RNA have previously been classified as members or probable members of the genus Coltivirus within the family REOVIRIDAE: A number of these viruses have been isolated in North America and Europe and are serologically and genetically related to Colorado tick fever virus, the Coltivirus type species. These isolates constitute subgroup A of the coltiviruses. The complete genome sequences are now presented of two Asian arboviruses, Kadipiro virus (KDV) and Banna virus (BAV), which are currently classified as subgroup B coltiviruses. Analysis of the viral protein sequences shows that all of the BAV genome segments have cognate genes in KDV. The functions of several of these proteins were also indicated by this analysis. Proteins with dsRNA-binding domains or with significant similarities to polymerases, methyltransferases, NTPases or protein kinases were identified. Comparisons of amino acid sequences of the conserved polymerase protein have shown that BAV and KDV are only very distantly related to the subgroup A coltiviruses. These data demonstrate a requirement for the subgroup B viruses to be reassigned to a separate new genus, for which the name Seadornavirus is proposed.
