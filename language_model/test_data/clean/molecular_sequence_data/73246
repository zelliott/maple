We previously identified a 42 kDa Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (InsP4) receptor protein (p42IP4) in brain membranes from several species. Here the cDNA sequence of p42IP4 was obtained by PCR using degenerate primers derived from peptide sequences of proteolytic fragments of the porcine protein and by subsequent screening of a pig brain cDNA library. The derived peptide sequence of 374 amino acids for porcine p42IP4 is 45 amino acids shorter at the C-terminus than centaurin-alpha from rat (84% homology) and has a calculated molecular mass of 43 kDa. From the InsP4 binding activity present in brain tissue homogenate about 25% is found in the cytosolic fraction and 75% associated with microsomes. Both activities are due to p42IP4 since (i) a peptide-specific antiserum recognizing specifically p42IP4 labels the InsP4 receptor protein in membranes and in the cytosol, (ii) the antiserum immunoprecipitates both the membrane protein and the cytosolic protein of 42 kDa, (iii) the InsP4 binding activity released by high salt or by alkaline extraction from membranes is identified immunologically as the 42 kDa protein, and (iv) the affinity for InsP4 and specificity for various inositolphosphates are similar for the membrane-associated and for the soluble p42IP4. The functional importance of p42IP4 is highlighted by the identical affinity for InsP4 and for phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)P3 (Ki = 1.6 and 0.9 nM, respectively). Thus, the InsP4 receptor, apparently a peripheral membrane protein, which exists also as a cytosolic protein can transfer the signals mediated by InsP4 or by PtdInsP3 between membranes and cytosolic compartment.
