An acidic 1,2-alpha-mannosidase from fungus, Aspergillus saitoi (now designated Aspergillus phoenicis), is highly specific for 1,2-alpha-mannosidic linkage in the high-mannose type oligosaccharide at pH 5.0. The predicted amino acid sequence of several peptide regions, including aspartic acid and glutamic acid, bears striking similarities to 1,2-alpha-mannosidases from fungi, yeast and mouse. Active site determination of the enzyme expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells was performed by site-directed mutagenesis. Substitutions of Asp-269 to Glu and of the Glu-residues, Glu-273, Glu-411, Glu-414 and Glu-474, to Asp altered the drastic decrease of specific activities with Man alpha 1-2Man-OMe and Man9-GlcNAc2-PA as substrates and shifted the optimal pH of the mutant enzymes. From the present results, Asp-269 is probably in the ionized COO- form, whereas one of four glutamic acid residues, probably Glu-411, is the un-ionized COOH form according to the analogy of a plausible mechanism for lysozyme catalysis. It is assumed that three glutamic acid residues, Glu-273, Glu-414, and Glu-474, are probably binding sites of substrate.
