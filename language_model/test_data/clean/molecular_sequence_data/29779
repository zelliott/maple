Potential receptors for Drosophila neuropeptide F (DmNPF) were identified in the genome database. One receptor (DmNPFR1) sequence resembled the Lymnaea NPY receptor, an invertebrate homolog of the vertebrate Y-receptor family. DmNPFR1 was cloned and tested for functionality in stably transfected mammalian CHO cells. In whole cell binding assays, DmNPF displaced 125I-NPF in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50) = 65 nM). DmNPF inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity similarly (IC(50) = 51 nM). Whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that DmNPFR1 RNA is expressed in CNS and midgut of Drosophila larvae. DmNPFR1, a new invertebrate Y-receptor homolog, apparently is a functional receptor for DmNPF.
