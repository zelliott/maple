Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have emerged as a major class of DNA markers with the advantage of permitting the development of high-density genetic maps adequate for quantitative trait loci (QTL) identification by linkage-disequilibrium analysis. Here we describe results of a relatively high-depth survey of chicken broiler and layer populations for SNPs in targeted genomic regions of chicken expressed sequence tag (EST) sites. The sequences scanned, representing the composite sequence of 12 amplified fragments for a total of 6489 bp, were randomly distributed, occurring on six different chromosomes or linkage groups in the chicken genome. Although one of the genomic DNA sequences did not match the reference cDNA sequence, another contained an intron that separated two putative exons. The number of SNPs observed within each of the 12 EST-targeted genomic regions ranged from 0 to 10 for a total of 44 and a frequency of 0.7%. About 70% of the polymorphisms were shared between layer and broiler populations. The average heterozygosity within the populations ranged from 0.15 to 0.48, with the layer populations showing the higher heterozygosity. SNPs and oligonucleotides described will provide a resource for genetic analysis in commercial chicken populations. The data appear to indicate that the relative frequency of SNPs in the targeted regions scanned is higher than the frequency reported for any of the other regions scanned to date in other eukaryotic genomes. Additionally, the results suggest that the use of DNA pools may offer an efficient approach to SNP detection in chickens, as has been shown in other vertebrates.
