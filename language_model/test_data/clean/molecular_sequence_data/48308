Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) based therapy is well established for treating diabetes mellitus type 2. Moreover, GLP-1 receptor agonists influence weight loss, and have potential for treating obesity. GLP-1 receptor agonists should be administered in low doses, together with drugs that potentiate insulin release, to avoid some minor side effects. We have focused on incretin hormones, especially GLP-1 and its analogues. Here we discuss the effect of the third intracellular loop-derived peptide of GLP-1 receptor on intracellular mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase and its role in regulating the receptor. We suggest that this intracellular mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase could constitute a possible novel pharmacological target in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 and obesity.
