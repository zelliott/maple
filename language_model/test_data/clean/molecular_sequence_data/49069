To study the antitumor effects of curcin from Jatropha curcas.

Antitumor activity of curcin was tested by MTT assay. The N-glycosidase activity of curcin was determined by characterization of R-fragment in gel. A cell-free system, rabbit reticulocyte lysate, was introduced to quantify the inhibitory activity of curcin on protein biosynthesis.

The curcin had a powerful inhibitory action upon protein synthesis in reticulocyte lysate with an IC50 (95 % confidence limits) value of 0.19 (0.11-0.27) nmol/L. The IC50 (95 % confidence limits) of curcin on SGC-7901, Sp2/0, and human hepatoma was 0.23 (0.15-0.32) mg/L, 0.66 (0.35-0.97) mg/L, 3.16 (2.74-3.58) mg/L, respectively. Curcin was found to have no toxic to Hela cells and normal cells (MRC). After the rRNA of ribosome was treated with curcin and aniline at acidic condition, a cleaved R-fragment of approximately 450 nt appeared, but this fragment did not occur after treatment with curcin only. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of curcin, ricin A-chain and trichosanthin revealed that there were relatively high similarities among them. The percentages of homology between curcin and ricin A chain, between curcin and trichosanthin were found to be 54 % and 57 % respectively. Especially, the conserved residues forming the active sites of the A chain of ricin and trichosanthin occurred in curcin.

Curcin has an obvious antitumor effect and its mechanisms are related to the N-glycosidase activity.
