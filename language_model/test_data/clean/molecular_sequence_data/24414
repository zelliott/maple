Three ganglioside molecular species, OSG-0 (1), OSG-1 (2), and OSG-2 (3) have been obtained from the polar lipid fraction of the chloroform/methanol extract of the brittle star Ophiocoma scolopendrina. The structures of these gangliosides have been determined on the basis of chemical and spectroscopic evidence as 1-O-[(N-glycolyl-alpha-D-neuraminosyl)-(2-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl]-ceramide (1), 1-O-[8-O-sulfo-(N-acetyl-alpha-D-neuraminosyl)-(2-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyll-ceramide (2) and 1-O-[(N-glycolyl-alpha-D-neuraminosyl)-(2-->8)-(N-acetyl- and N-glycolyl-alpha-D-neuraminosyl)-(2-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl]-ceramide (3). The ceramide moieties were composed of heterogeneous unsubstituted fatty acid, 2-hydroxy fatty acid and phytosphingosine units. Compounds 2 and 3 represent new ganglioside molecular species.
