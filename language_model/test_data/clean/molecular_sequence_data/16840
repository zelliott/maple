We isolated a mutant, rag17, which is impaired in glucose induction of expression of the major glucose transporter gene RAG1. The RAG17 gene encodes a protein 87% identical to S. cerevisiae enolases (Eno1 and Eno2). The Kleno null mutant showed no detectable enolase enzymatic activity and has severe growth defects on glucose and gluconeogenic carbon sources, indicating that K. lactis has a single enolase gene. In addition to RAG1, the transcription of several glycolytic genes was also strongly reduced in the DeltaKleno mutant. Moreover, the defect in RAG1 expression was observed in other mutants of the glycolytic pathway (hexokinase and phosphoglycerate kinase). Therefore, it seems that the enolase and a functional glycolytic flux are necessary for induction of expression of the Rag1 glucose permease in K. lactis.
