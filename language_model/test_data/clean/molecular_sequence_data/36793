Applying Southern blot hybridization, the structures of the red pigment gene (RPG) and the green pigment gene (GPG) were analyzed in 43 Chinese patients with red-green color vision defects, including 3 female cases of deuteranopia. The same analysis was carried out in 4 normal relatives and 3 carriers from 3 affected families, as well as in 11 normal controls. Among the 43 patients, abnormalities of the RPG were detected in all 19 protans, and abnormalities of the GPG were found in 14 of the 24 deutans. In about 80% of the protans and deutans, an alteration of exon 5 in RPG or GPG was discovered. All 19 protans had anomalous RPG and in one protan the normal RPG was replaced by a 5' red-3' green hybrid gene. However, no protans showed deletion of the whole RPG. Some deutans had no GPG; some had a 5' green-3' red hybrid gene with or without the GPG. The exon 5 of RPG and GPG was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the amplified fragments were further analyzed by RsaI digestion. The results of PCR were identical to those of nucleic acid hybridization. PCR will be a useful tool in prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling.
