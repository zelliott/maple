Since molecular structure of hnRNP is not available in foreseeable future, it is best to construct a working model for hnRNP structure. A geometric problem, assembly of 700 +/- 20 nucleotides with 48 proteins, is visualized by a frame work in which all the proteins participate in primary binding, followed by secondary, tertiary and quaternary binding with neighboring proteins without additional import. Thus, 40S hnRNP contains crown-like secondary structure (48 stem-loops) and appearance of 6 petal (octamers) rose-like architectures. The proteins are wrapped by RNA. Co-transcriptional folding for RNP fibril of FMR1 gene can produce 2,571 stem-loops with frequency of 1 stem-loop/15.3 nucleotides and 53 40S hnRNP beaded structure. By spliceosome driven reactions, there occurs removal of 16 separate lariated RNPs, joining 17 separate beaded exonic structures and anchoring EJC on each exon junction. Skipping exon 12 has 5'GU, 3'AG and very compact folding pattern with frequency of 1 stem-loop per 12 nucleotides in short exon length (63 nucleotides). 5'end of exon 12 contains SS (Splicing Silencer) element of UAGGU. In exons 10, 15 and 17 where both regular and alternative splice sites exist, SS (hnRNP A1 binding site) is observed at the regular splicing site. End products are mature FMR-1 mRNP, 4 species of Pri-microRNAs derived from introns 7,9,15 and 3'UTR of exon17, respectively. There may also be some other regulatory RNAs containing ALU/Line elements as well.
