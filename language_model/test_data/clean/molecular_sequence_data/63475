A novel sugar, 5,7-diacetamido-8-amino-3,5,7,8,9-pentadeoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulosonic acid (NonlA), has been identified as a component of the oligosaccharide (OS) isolated from the lipooligosaccharide (LOS) of the emerging strain of Vibrio parahaemolyticus O3:K6 associated with a global pandemic. In the present study we report the identification and characterization of this novel sugar present in the OS of V. parahaemolyticus O3:K6, using chemical analysis, NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.
