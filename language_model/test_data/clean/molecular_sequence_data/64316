Characterization of strains of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri by using DNA fingerprints that were generated from primers for enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) elements led to the discovery of differential sequences for a leucine-responsive regulatory protein (lrp) gene in two subgroups of strains with different host ranges on Citrus spp. DNA hybridization and PCR-based assays that used different sets of primers were designed to detect the core sequence, as well as to obtain the entire sequence of the lrp gene for several Xanthomonas species and pathovars. Higher variability was observed at the nucleotide level than at the amino acid level among the different species and pathovars, revealing selection pressure on the lrp gene, which is presumably due to an essential role of the gene in bacterial metabolism. Moderate variability in the 3' and 5' domains was used to study relationships among different species within the genus XANTHOMONAS: Species of this genus that were isolated from citrus, as well as other pathovars of X. axonopodis, showed highly similar lrp gene sequences, whereas other Xanthomonas species, especially Xanthomonas campestris, had sequences that were more dissimilar to that of X. axonopodis. Thus, the lrp gene sequence is useful to distinguish X. axonopodis pv. citri groups and promising for polyphasic taxonomic analysis of the genus XANTHOMONAS: Data from analysis of lrp gene sequences support the current concepts for classification of xanthomonads, which are based on other approaches.
