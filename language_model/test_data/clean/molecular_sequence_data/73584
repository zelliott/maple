Human transcription initiation factor TFIID contains the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and several TBP-associated factors (TAFs). To investigate the structural organization and function of TFIID, we have cloned and expressed a DNA encoding the third largest human TFIID subunit, hTAFII100. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that hTAFII100 is an integral subunit that is associated with all transcriptionally-competent forms of TFIID. They further suggest that at least part of the N-terminal region lies on the surface of TFIID, while a C-terminal region containing conserved WD-40 repeats appears inaccessible. Both in vivo and in vitro assays indicate that hTAFII100 interacts strongly with the histone H4-related hTAFII80 and the histone H3-related hTAFII31, as well as a stable complex comprised of both hTAFII80 and hTAFII31. Apparently weaker interactions of hTAFII100 with TBP, hTAFII250, hTAFII28, and hTAFII20, but not hTAFII55, also have been observed. These results suggest a role for hTAFII100 in stabilizing interactions of TAFs, especially the histone-like TAFs, in TFIID. In addition, functional studies show that anti-hTAFII100 antibodies selectively inhibit basal transcription from a TATA-less initiator-containing promoter, relative to a TATA-containing promoter, suggesting a possible core promoter-specific function for hTAFII100.
