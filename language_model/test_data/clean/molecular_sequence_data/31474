A novel actinobacterial strain, 3-wff-81(T), was isolated from interfacial sediment of the eutrophic Taihu Lake in Jiangsu Province (China) and subjected to polyphasic taxonomic characterization. The strain formed pale orange-pigmented colonies comprising rod-shaped cells on R2A agar. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain 3-wff-81(T) belonged to the genus Geodermatophilus, with Geodermatophilus soli PB34(T) (99.1 % similarity) and Geodermatophilus terrae PB261(T) (98.3 % similarity) as closest relatives. The major fatty acids were 16 : 0 iso, 15 : 0 iso, 17 : 1ω8c and 14 : 0 iso. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H4) and MK-9. Polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol mannosides. The genomic DNA G+C content was 73.2 mol%. DNA-DNA relatedness values with G. soli PB34(T) and G. terrae PB261(T) were 42.8 % and 39.6 %, respectively. Based on the physiological, biochemical and chemotaxonomic data, it is proposed that strain 3-wff-81(T) represents a novel species named Geodermatophilus taihuensis sp. nov. with 3-wff-81(T) ( = CGMCC 1.12303(T) = NBRC 109416(T)) as the type strain.
