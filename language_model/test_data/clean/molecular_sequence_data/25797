The ovaries of the ascidian Herdmania momus were extracted for relaxin. Relaxin immunoactivity was eluted from Sephadex G-50 in the position of authentic porcine ovarian relaxin and these fractions were parallel to porcine relaxin in an homologous porcine relaxin radioimmunoassay. Poly(A)+ RNA from ascidian ovaries hybridized to a 32P-labeled porcine relaxin B-chain 48 mer oligonucleotide probe. There was no hybridization with 32P-labeled probes of equal length but was rather directed to the B-chain of human relaxin or to two different regions of the C-peptide of porcine relaxin. We conclude that the ascidian ovary produces a relaxin-like molecule, possibly with greater homology in the B-chain to mammalian relaxins than in the C-peptide region.
