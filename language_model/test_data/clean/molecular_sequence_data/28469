As part of our screening of antiviral agents from medicinal plants, 11 compounds from plant origin (Bupleurum rigidum and Scrophularia scorodonia), three saikosaponins, seven iridoids and one phenylpropanoid glycoside were tested in vitro against herpes simplex type I (HSV-1), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and poliovirus type 1. Five of these compounds showed antiviral activity against VSV. The percentages of cellular viability at the non-toxic limit concentrations of the active compounds were: verbascoside 53.6 % at 500 microg/ml, 8-acetylharpagide 32.1 % at 500 microg/ml, harpagoside 43.3 % at 450 microg/ml, scorodioside 47.8 % at 500 microg/ml and buddlejasaponin IV 56.9 % at 25 microg/ml. Although none of the saikosaponins were active against HSV-1, the iridoid scorodioside showed moderate in vitro anti-HSV-1 activity (30.6 % at 500 microg/ml). However, none of the compounds tested in this survey had any effect against poliovirus.
