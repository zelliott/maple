To define the early stages of the interaction between Rhizobium and host legumes, we have cloned and characterized three early nodulin-encoding sequences from an alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) cDNA library by probing with a fragment of a cDNA clone for PsENOD12, an infection-related nodulin from pea (Pisum sativum L.). Although the coding regions of the three clones are 95 to 98% homologous to each other, they are only 43% homologous to the pea clone. However, the putative signal peptide encoded by the alfalfa cDNA clones is 100% homologous to the PsENDO12 signal peptide. The spatial and temporal expression patterns of PsENOD12 and the alfalfa clones were compared. In situ hybridization experiments detected RNA transcripts in the invasion zone of mature nitrogen-fixing nodules, the same site where PsENOD12 mRNAs are found. Transcripts were also found by in situ hybridization in cells of Rhizobium meliloti exoH mutant-induced nodules penetrated by infection threads, but northern analysis did not detect transcripts in inf- (infection thread minus) nodules elicited by R. meliloti exoB nodules or in pseudonodules elicited by treatment with the auxin transport inhibitor N-1-(naphthyl)phthalamic acid. In addition, the alfalfa gene represented by these cDNA clones exhibited a temporal expression pattern that differed from that of PsENOD12, which is transiently expressed. These data, plus information derived from Southern blot analysis, indicate that we have isolated cDNA clones for a novel early nodulin, which we have designated MsENOD10 (Medicago sativa Early Nodulin 10).
