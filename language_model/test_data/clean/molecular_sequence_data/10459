Recent studies have demonstrated that Rickettsia prowazekii can regulate transcription of selected genes at the level of initiation. However, little information concerning the existence of operons and coordinate gene regulation in this obligate intracellular parasitic bacterium is available. To address these issues, we have focused on the rpoD gene linkage group (greA-open reading frame 23 [ORF23]-dnaG-rpoD), which includes the rickettsial analog (ORF23-dnaG-rpoD) of the major macromolecular synthesis operon (MMSO). The rickettsial MMSO consists of an ORF coding for a protein of unknown function the structural genes for DNA primase (dnaG) and the major sigma factor of RNA polymerase (rpoD). RNase protection assays (RPA) were used to determine if these genes are organized into an operon controlled by multiple promoters and the quantities of transcripts produced by these genes relative to each other. RPA with a probe spanning the 270-base greA-ORF23 intervening region identified a putative transcriptional promoter within the intervening sequence. Multiple RPA probes spanning the next 4,041 bases of the linkage group demonstrated the presence of a continuous transcript and thus the existence of an operon. A probe spanning the dnaG-rpoD region revealed that two additional mRNA fragments were also protected, which enabled us to identify additional putative promoters for rpoD within dnaG. Primer extension determined that the 5' ends of the three transcripts consist separately of adenine (located 227 bases upstream of ORF23) and uracil and adenine (located 336 and 250 bases upstream of rpoD, respectively). Quantitation of transcripts produced by the three ORFs determined the relative amounts of transcripts (ORF23 to dnaG to rpoD) to be 1:2.7:5.1.
