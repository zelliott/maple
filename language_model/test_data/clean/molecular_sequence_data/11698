The human gut epithelium is a unique immunological compartment, containing substantial amounts of intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IEL) with unknown functions. In this study we show that distinct and unusual subpopulations of IEL are present at different levels of human intestine. IEL phenotypes in normal jejunum, ileum and colon were compared using immunoflow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. The expression of mRNA for recombination-activating gene-1 (RAG-1) in IEL from all three levels was compared using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and the morphology of IEL in situ was determined using immunoelectron microscopy. Surface marker profiles of isolated intestinal epithelial cells at all three levels were also investigated. On average the proportion of TCR gamma delta IEL was comparable in jejunum than ileum and colon and varied in phenotype with gut level. CD4-CD8-TCR alpha beta IEL dominated in colon but were absent in jejunum. CD8+ TCR alpha beta IEL were present at all levels but only in jejunum did they constitute the majority of all IEL. CD4+ TCR alpha beta IEL were present in similar frequencies at all levels of the gut. In general, the majority of IEL had an activated phenotype (CD45RO+, alpha E beta 7+). Furthermore, IEL exhibited phenotypes which are rare in peripheral blood. The thymocyte markers CD1a and CD1c as well as the NK cell marker CD56 were expressed on a fraction of TCR alpha beta and TCR gamma delta IEL. A small population of 'null' cells (CD45+ TCR/CD#-CD20-CD14-CD15- cells) was also present at equal proportions along the gut. Jejunal but not colonic IEL expressed RAG-1 mRNA suggesting that extrathymic T cell maturation occurs in the epithelium of small intestine. RAG-1 was expressed in CD2+TCR/CD3- and CD3+/TCR-IEL. Ultrastructurally, IEL often formed small clusters and intimate contacts with epithelial cells, suggesting cell cooperation within the epithelium. Some IEL had pseudopodium-like extensions penetrating the epithelial basement membrane suggesting transmigration. Epithelial cells in small intestine but not colon expressed heat shock protein 60 and HLA-DR. CD1a, CD1b and CD1c were not expressed on intestinal epithelial cells at any level. The distinct surface marker profiles of IEL and epithelial cells along small and large intestine suggest functional regional specialization and are compatible with the hypothesis that TCR alpha beta IEL participate in immune reactions to lumenal antigens while TCR gamma delta IEL perform surveillance of the epithelium.
