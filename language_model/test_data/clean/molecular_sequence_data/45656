In yeast, the nonhomologous end joining pathway (NHEJ) mobilizes the DNA polymerase Pol4 to repair DNA double-strand breaks when gap filling is required prior to ligation. Using telomere-telomere fusions caused by loss of the telomeric protein Rap1 and double-strand break repair on transformed DNA as assays for NHEJ between fully uncohesive ends, we show that Pol4 is able to extend a 3'-end whose last bases are mismatched, i.e., mispaired or unpaired, to the template strand.
