Monotremes are an ancient mammalian lineage that last shared a common ancestor with the marsupial and eutherian (placental) mammals about 170 million years ago. Characterization of their immune genes is allowing us to gain insights into the evolutionary processes that lead to the 'mammalian' immune response. Here we describe the characterization of the first cDNA clones encoding T-cell receptors from a monotreme. Two TCR alpha-chain cDNAs ( TCRA) from the short-beaked echidna, Tachyglossus aculeatus, containing complete variable, joining and constant regions were isolated. The echidna TCRA constant region shares approximately 37% amino acid identity with other mammalian TCRA constant region sequences. The two variable regions belong to the TCRAV group C, which also contains V genes from humans, mice, cattle and chickens. One echidna TCR beta-chain cDNA ( TCRB) containing the entire constant region was isolated and sequenced. It shares about 63% identity with other mammalian TCRB constant region sequences. The echidna TCRBV belongs to TCRBV group A, which also contains V genes from various eutherian species. Southern blot analysis indicates that, like in other mammalian species, there is only one TCRA constant region copy in the echidna genome, but at least two TCRB constant regions.
