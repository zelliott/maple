PriA is a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase, DNA translocase, and DNA helicase that was discovered originally because of its requirement in vitro for the conversion of bacteriophage phi X174 viral DNA to the duplex replicative form. Studies demonstrated that PriA catalyzes the assembly of a primosome, a multiprotein complex that primes DNA synthesis, on phi X174 DNA. The primosome was shown to be capable of providing both the DNA unwinding function and the Okazaki fragment priming function required for replication fork progression. However, whereas seven proteins, PriA, PriB, PriC, DnaT, DnaB, DnaC, and DnaG, were required for primosome assembly on phi X174 DNA, only DnaB, DnaC, and DnaG were required for replication from oriC, suggesting that the other proteins were not involved in chromosomal replication. Strains carrying priA null mutations, however, were constitutively induced for the SOS response, and were defective in homologous recombination, repair of UV-damaged DNA, and double-strand breaks, and both induced and constitutive stable DNA replication. The basis for this phenotype can now be explained by the ability of PriA to load replication forks at a D loop, an intermediate that forms during homologous recombination, double-strand break-repair, and stable DNA replication. Thus, a long-theorized connection between recombination and replication is demonstrated.
