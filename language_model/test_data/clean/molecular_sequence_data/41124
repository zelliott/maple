We cloned and sequenced the gene encoding Thermococcus pacificus dUTPase (Tpa dUTPase). The Tpa dUTPase gene consists of 471 bp and encodes a 156-amino acid protein. The deduced amino acid sequence of Tpa dUTPase has high sequence similarity with other archaeal dUTPases. The Tpa dUTPase had an 18-kDa major protein band consistent with the 17,801 Da molecular mass calculated based on the amino acid sequence. The specific activity of Tpa dUTPase on dUTP at 85 °C was 90,909 U/mg. For Tpa dUTPase activity, we determined an optimum pH of 8.5 and temperature of 85 °C. Magnesium ions strongly induced activity, with an optimum concentration of 0.75 mM. The half-life of the enzyme at 94 °C was about 7 h. The specific activity of the Tpa dUTPase on dUTP was about 10-20-fold higher than that of Tpa dUTPase on dCTP. Tpa dUTPase enhanced the PCR amplification efficiency of long targets when Pfu and Vent DNA polymerases were used.
