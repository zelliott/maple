TFIID is a general transcription factor required for the assembly of the transcription machinery on most eukaryotic promoters transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Although the TATA-binding subunit (TBP) of TFIID is able to support core promoter and activator-dependent transcription under some circumstances, the roles of TBP-associated factors (TAF(II)s) in TFIID-mediated activation remain unclear. To define the evolutionarily conserved function of TFIID and to elucidate the roles of TAF(II)s in gene activation, we have cloned the mouse TAF(II)55 subunit of TFIID and further isolated mouse TFIID from a murine FM3A-derived cell line that constitutively expresses FLAG-tagged mouse TAF(II)55. Both mouse and human TFIIDs are capable of mediating transcriptional activation by Gal4 fusions containing different activation domains in a highly purified human cell-free transcription system devoid of TFIIA and Mediator. Although TAF(II)-independent activation by Gal4-VP16 can also be observed in this highly purified human transcription system with either mouse or yeast TBP, TAF(II)s are strictly required for estrogen receptor-mediated activation independently of the core promoter sequence. In addition, TAF(II)s are necessary for transcription from a preassembled chromatin template. These findings clearly demonstrate an essential role of TAF(II)s as a transcriptional coactivator for estrogen receptor and in chromatin transcription.
