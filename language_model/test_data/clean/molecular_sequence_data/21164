In mammals, natriuretic peptides (NPs) lower blood pressure, reduce blood volume and broadly inhibit cardiovascular remodeling. NPs are often referred to as cardiac hormones, though they also have integral roles in regulating vascular tone, endothelial remodeling and inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cell hypertrophy. Two NPs [atrial (ANP) and C-type (CNP)] have been identified as endogenous constituents in the vasculature of mammals, though such a phenomenon has not previously been described in fishes. Here we describe the endogenous production of B-type NP (BNP) and CNP in multiple blood vessels of the rainbow trout. Western blot analysis showed pro-BNP and pro-CNP production in the efferent branchial artery, celiacomesenteric artery, ventral aorta and anterior cardinal vein. The detection of pro-BNP and pro-CNP was also supported by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of NP-enriched tissue extracts. Although vascular pro-peptide levels of BNP and CNP were quantitatively quite comparable to those found in reference tissues (the atrium for BNP and brain for CNP), mRNA levels of these NPs in the vasculature were greatly reduced as determined by quantitative PCR. When the evolutionarily conserved vascular NP (CNP) was infused into un-anesthetized trout, it reduced central venous pressure and mean circulatory filling pressure. CNP also decreased cardiac output via a reduction in preload. The presence of endogenous NP production in the trout vasculature and potent in vivo hypotensive effects further support the numerous functional similarities between teleost and mammalian NP systems.
