The study of the MHC-G gene evolution during nearly 40 million years does not support a role for the full molecule. The MHC-G-like proteins of New World monkeys are probably classical presenting molecules. Old World Cercopithecinae monkeys do not have a full MHC-G molecule and human individuals homozygous for the HLA-G null allele are healthy and do not show birth pathologies.
