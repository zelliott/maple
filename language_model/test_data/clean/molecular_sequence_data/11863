A stromal protein, designated restrictin-P, that specifically kills plasma-like cells was purified to homogeneity and shown to be identical with activin A. The specificity to plasma-like cells stemmed from the ability of restrictin-P/activin A to competitively antagonize the proliferation-inducing effects of interleukin (IL) 6 and IL-11. Restrictin-P further interfered with the IL-6-induced secretion of acute phase proteins by HepG2 human hepatoma cells and with the IL-6-mediated differentiation of M1 myeloblasts. A competition binding assay indicated that restrictin-P did not interfere with the binding of IL-6 to its receptor on plasma-like cells, suggesting that it may act by intervening in the signal transduction pathway of the growth factor. Indeed, concomitant addition of restrictin-P and IL-6 to cytokine-deprived B9 hybridoma cells was followed by sustained overexpression of junB gene until cell death occurred, while IL-6 alone caused a transient increase only. This altered response to IL-6 stimulation was accompanied by a moderate increase in STAT protein activation. Thus, in this study, we identified the plasmacytoma growth inhibitor, restrictin-P, as being activin A of stromal origin. It is shown that activin A is an antagonist of IL-6-induced functions and that it modifies the IL-6 signaling pattern.
