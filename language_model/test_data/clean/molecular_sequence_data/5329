Na channel subunits alphaSNS (PN3) and alpha mu1(SkM1) produce slowly inactivating/TTX-resistant and rapidly inactivating/TTX-sensitive currents, respectively. AlphaSNS (PN3) current recovers from inactivation (reprimes) rapidly. Sequence alignment identified the tetrapeptide SLEN, in the S3-S4 linker of D4, as alphaSNS-specific. To determine whether SLEN endows Na channels with slow kinetics and/or rapid repriming, we analyzed the transient Na current produced by a chimera mu1SLEN in HEK293 cells. Neither kinetics nor voltage dependence of activation and inactivation was affected. However, repriming was twice as fast as in the wild type at -100 mV. This suggests that SLEN may contribute to the rapid repriming of TTX-resistant Na current.
