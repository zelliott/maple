The extracellular of the putative receptor-like protein kinase, ZmPK1, is related to the self-incompatibility locus (S-locus) genes of Brassica. We have isolated and characterized a genomic DNA clone of ZmPK1 and three additional genes from maize that are highly related to ZmPK1. These three S-locus related genes do not appear to have the protein kinase catalytic domain that is found in ZmPK1. One or more of these genes are expressed specifically in the silks. This initial description of S-locus related genes in monocotyledonous plants suggests that the S-locus domain may be involved in several different cellular functions in a wide variety of plants.
