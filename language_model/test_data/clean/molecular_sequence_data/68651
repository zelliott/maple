The 21 kDa proteins encoded by RAS genes are thought to be involved in intracellular signal transduction. Expression of RAS genes activated by point mutations after transfection into mammalian cells can modulate the response of these cells to exogenously added growth factors and their expression patterns of growth factors. We analyzed leukemic cells from 50 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) for the presence of activating point mutations of the N-RAS gene using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and differential oligonucleotide hybridization. This assay allows semiquantitative determination of the relative abundance of cells carrying N-RAS mutations. Clonal activation of N-RAS, noted in the large majority of leukemic cells of the six of these patients, was correlated significantly (p = 0.0003) with the ability of these cells to express interleukin 6 (IL-6), previously shown to be expressed at high levels in approximately 30% of primary AML cells. In 16 patients, the presence of N-RAS mutations was observed only in subpopulations of leukemic cells. The 'subclonal' involvement of some but not all leukemic cells was further demonstrated by PCR analysis of individual clones grown in soft agar culture. We investigated whether additional, complementary changes in oncogene structure occurred in cells exhibiting clonal activation of N-RAS. For instance, concomitant activation of N-RAS and amplification or rearrangement of c-MYC have been observed in various tumor tissues. Southern blot analysis did not, however, reveal gross alternations of MYC gene structure or copy number in these cells.
