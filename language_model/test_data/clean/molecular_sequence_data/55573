Nitrate reductase from the yeast Candida nitratophila was found to contain one molecule of cytochrome b557 and one atom of molybdenum per subunit. FAD/haem-dependent diaphorase activity (haem domain) was associated with a 40 kDa tryptic fragment of the subunit. The 50 amino-terminal residues of this fragment were determined, and the sequence did not show significant similarity to deduced sequences of other nitrate reductases previously published. Increasing ionic strength in vitro had a stimulatory effect on enzymic activity via stimulation of the molybdenum-dependent terminal nitrate-reducing activity. Stimulation of activity by exogenous protein (bovine serum albumin or casein) also appeared to be an ionic effect. Stimulation of catalytic activity by phosphate was a separate effect.
