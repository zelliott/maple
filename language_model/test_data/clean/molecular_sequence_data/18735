Polymorphisms in the CAMP gene (cathelicidin) have not been tested in tuberculosis susceptibility. We tested polymorphisms rs9844812 (HIF-1α::ARNT binding site) and rs56122065 (CAMP) plus rs1800972 (DEFB1). SNP rs1800972 was associated with extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) in a codominant model (genotype CG, P = 0.037, OR 4.82; 95% CI: 0.92-47.42; statistical power, 82%), but not PTB (P = 0.101) in a Mexican population.
