The distribution of N-acetyl group in partially deacetylated chitin (DA-chitin) was investigated by nitrous acid deamination. Most deamination products of various DA-chitins (over 50% of deacetylation), prepared under homogeneous conditions, were oligomers of less than six units. These results would suggest a random distribution of N-acetyl groups in the DA-chitin molecule.
