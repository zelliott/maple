Sapovirus (SV), which causes gastroenteritis in humans, is composed of genetically divergent viruses classified into 5 genogroups. In this study, 2.2-kb nucleotide sequences of the 3' terminus of the genome of 15 SV strains detected in Japan were determined. The 15 SV strains could be classified into four genogroups (GI, GII, GIV and GV), and in two of these, GI and GII, 10 genotypes were identified. The amino acid sequences of the central variable region of the capsid protein showed less than 81% identity when strains belonging to different genotypes were compared. It was therefore supposed that antigenic variety exists between different genotypes. These results will be useful for further genetic and antigenic analyses of SV.
