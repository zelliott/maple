A 1.0 kilobase gene fragment from the genomic DNA of an alkaliphilic thermophilic Bacillus was found to code for a functional xylanase (XynII). The complete nucleotide sequence including the structural gene and the 5' and 3' flanking sequences of the xylanase gene have been determined. An open reading frame starting from ATG initiator codon comprising 402 nucleotides gave a preprotein of 133 amino acids of calculated molecular mass 14.090 kDa. The occurrence of three potential N-glycosylation sites in XynII gene is a unique feature for a gene of bacterial origin. The stop codon was followed by hairpin loop structures indicating the presence of transcription termination signals. The secondary structure analysis of XynII predicted that the polypeptide was primarily formed of beta-sheets. XynII appeared to be a member of family G/11 of xylanases based on its molecular weight and basic pI (8.0). However, sequence homology revealed similar identity with families 10 and 11 of xylanases. The conserved triad (Val-Val-Xaa, where Xaa is Asn or Asp) was identified only in the xylanases from alkaliphilic organisms. Our results implicate for the first time the concept of convergent evolution for XynII and provide a basis for research in evolutionary relationship among the xylanases from alkaliphilic and neutrophilic organisms.
