The cDNA for Sp23, a structural protein of the spermatophore of Tenebrio molitor, had been previously cloned and characterized (Paesen, G.C., Schwartz, M.B., Peferoen, M., Weyda, F. and Happ, G.M. (1992a) Amino acid sequence of Sp23, a structure protein of the spermatophore of the mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor. J. Biol. Chem. 257, 18852-18857). Using the labeled cDNA for Sp23 as a probe to screen a library of genomic DNA from Tenebrio molitor, we isolated a genomic clone for Sp23. A 5373-base pair (bp) restriction fragment containing the Sp23 gene was sequenced. The coding region is separated by a 55-bp intron which is located close to the translation start site. Three putative ecdysone response elements (EcRE) are identified in the 5' flanking region of the Sp23 gene. Comparison of the flanking regions of the Sp23 gene with those of the D-protein gene expressed in the accessory glands of Tenebrio reveals similar sequences present in the flanking regions of the two genes. The genomic organization of the coding region of the Sp23 gene shares similarities with that of the D-protein gene, three Drosophila accessory gland genes and two Drosophila 20-OH ecdysone-responsive genes.
