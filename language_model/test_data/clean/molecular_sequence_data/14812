The functions of two Schizosaccharomyces pombe Vps9-like genes, SPBC4F6.10/vps901(+) and SPBC29A10.11c/vps902(+), were characterized. Genomic sequence analysis predicted that Vps901p contains a VPS9 domain, whereas cDNA analyses revealed that Vps901p contains a CUE domain (coupling of ubiquitin to ER degradation) in its C-terminal region. Deletion of vps901(+) resulted in mis-sorting and secretion of S. pombe vacuolar carboxypeptidase Cpy1p, whereas deletion of vps902(+) had no effect, suggesting that only Vps901p functions in vacuolar protein transport in S. pombe. Deletion of vps901(+) further produced pleiotropic phenotypes, including vacuolar homotypic fusion and endocytosis defects. Heterologous expression of the budding yeast VPS9 gene corrected the CPY mis-sorting defect in vps901Î” cells. These findings suggest that the VPS9 domain of Vps901p is required for vacuolar protein trafficking in S. pombe.
