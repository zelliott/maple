A current focus of proteomics research is the establishment of acceptable confidence measures in the assignment of protein identifications in an unknown sample. Development of new algorithmic approaches would greatly benefit from a standard reference set of spectra for known proteins for the purpose of testing and training. Here we describe an openly available library of mass spectra generated on an ABI 4700 MALDI TOF/TOF from 246 known, individually purified and trypsin-digested protein samples. The initial full release of the Aurum Dataset includes gel images, peak lists, spectra, search result files, decoy database analysis files, FASTA file of protein sequences, manual curation, and summary pages describing protein coverage and peptides matched by MS/MS followed by decoy database analysis using Mascot, Sequest, and X!Tandem. The data are publicly available for use at ProteomeCommons.org.
