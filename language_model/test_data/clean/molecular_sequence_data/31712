A novel bacterium, designated YIM M13075(T), was isolated from a sediment sample collected from the South China Sea. Growth occurred from 4 to 45 °C (optimum 28 °C), pH 6.0-11.0 (optimum pH 8.0). The strain formed yellow-cream colonies after 5 days incubation on TSA modified with 5 % NaCl medium at 28 °C. Cells were Gram-positive, short rods and motile. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain YIM M13075(T) was affiliated with the genus Geomicrobium (93.5 %). The strain YIM M13075(T) contained meso-diaminopimelic acid in the cell wall. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol. The major fatty acids were iso-C15:0 and anteiso-C15:0. The predominant menaquinones were MK-7 and MK-6. The genomic DNA G+C content was 42.7 mol%. On the basis of the morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics as well as genotypic data, strain YIM M13075(T) represents a novel species in the genus Geomicrobium, for which the name Geomicrobium sediminis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM M13075(T) (=DSM 25540(T) =JCM 18144(T) =CCTCC AB 2013245(T)). An emended description of the genus Geomicrobium is also proposed in the light of the new data.
