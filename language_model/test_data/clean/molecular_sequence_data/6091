Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is prevalent in periodontitis but is found in some periodontally healthy individuals as well. The arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR) was used to fingerprint clinical A. actinomycetemcomitans isolates of different serotypes to determine the association between individual clonal types and periodontal conditions. Fifteen different AP-PCR genotypes were distinguished among 93 A. actinomycetemcomitans isolates from 86 uncohabiting individuals with adult periodontitis, localized juvenile periodontitis or no periodontal destruction. The 3 most common AP-PCR genotypes accounted for 68% of the isolates. Seven of the remaining AP-PCR genotypes were found only in periodontitis. The isolates of a given AP-PCR genotype usually belonged to the same serotype. The distribution of the AP-PCR genotypes among serotype b isolates seemed to differ among the subject groups. The results revealed a major genetic dissimilarity between A. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes and suggested a relationship between some A. actinomycetemcomitans clones and periodontal disease.
