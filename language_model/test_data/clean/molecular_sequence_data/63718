A new species of Crassicutis Manter, 1936 is described from the Sinaloan cichlid Cichlasoma beani (Jordan) (Osteichthyes: Cichlidae) in the upper RÃ­o Santiago basin. Crassicutis choudhuryi n. sp. differs from most of the other nominal species by having testes located in a symmetrical position. The only other species of the genus that includes some specimens exhibiting this trait is Crassicutis intermedius (Szidat 1954), a species found in 5 species of siluriforms and 1 species of characiform in South America. However, this species differs from Cr. choudhuryi n. sp. by having testes almost half of the size, and vitelline follicles extending anteriorly to the region between the acetabulum and the intestinal bifurcation. The new species is morphologically very similar to Crassicutis cichlasomae Manter, 1936, but clearly differs from this species because of the constantly symmetrical position of the testes. Additionally, Cr. choudhuryi n. sp. is found in the Santiago River basin on the Pacific slope of Mexico, parasitizing specifically the endemic Ci. beani that does not co-occur with any other cichlid. Cr. cichlasomae exhibits more hosts (about 25 species of cichlids only in Mexico) and a wider distribution range that extends from northeastern Mexico southward to Central America, Cuba, and Brazil. To corroborate that our specimens were not conspecific with Cr. cichlasomae, sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) and the 28S ribosomal RNA genes of individuals from several populations (recently collected in southeastern Mexico) were obtained and compared to the species described herein. Sequence divergence (1.3% for the 28S and 4.0% for the ITS1) gives further support to the erection of a new species.
