The cellular localization of alpha3beta1 integrin isoforms was examined in cultured neonatal myocytes at selected times during development using double immunofluorescence assays. The distribution of alpha3A subunits began as diffuse and patternless, but as the cells matured, the distribution assumed a sarcomeric banding pattern, and alpha3A appeared to be localized in costameres - sarcolemmal regions adjacent to the Z-disks. Alpha-actinin, a component of the Z-disk, was localized in the same intracellular regions. Temporal analysis of the incorporation of the alpha3A subunit and other myofibrillar proteins into sarcomeres revealed that alpha3A was integrated into sarcomeres following incorporation of alpha-actinin and myosin heavy chain (MHC) but prior to that of desmin. This suggests that alpha3A integrins are incorporated into a pre-existing myofibrillar structure, and it is unlikely that alpha3A integrins participate in the initial assembly of myofibrillar proteins. The alpha3B, beta1A and beta1D subunits were also localized in costameres, where they formed alpha3Abeta1A, alpha3Abeta1D and alpha3Bbeta1A heterodimers. The alpha3Bbeta1D heterodimer, however, was not found in cardiac myocytes. The antisera raised against the cytoplasmic domains of alpha3A, alpha3B, beta1A and beta1D caused disruption of sarcomere structure. Thus, the myofibril-extracellular matrix linkages mediated by isoforms of alpha3beta1 integrin may play a crucial role in the stabilization of myofibril assembly and in the maintenance of sarcomere structure. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that beta1A, but not beta1D, interacts with the Nck signaling protein, suggesting that Nck participates in downstream signaling triggered by beta1A and that the beta1A-mediated signaling pathway is distinct from that of beta1D.
