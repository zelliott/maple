In the present study, the second nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS-2) rDNA of Schistosoma japonicum isolates in mainland China was amplified, sequenced, and assessed for inferring the intra- and inter-species phylogenetic relationships of trematodes in the order Strigeata. The fragment containing ITS-2 rDNA was obtained from 24 S. japonicum isolates from eight epidemic provinces in mainland China. The length polymorphisms were observed among these ITS-2 rDNA sequences, ranging from 343 to 346 bp, and the intra- and inter-population variations in ITS-2 sequence were 0.0-2.1% among S. japonicum isolates in China. Phylogenetic analyses using the maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods revealed that the ITS-2 rDNA sequence is not a suitable marker for studying inter- and intra-population variation in S. japonicum. However, phylogenetic analysis of trematodes in the order Strigeata indicated that the ITS-2 rDNA sequence provides an effective molecular marker for studying inter-species phylogenetic relationships among trematodes in this order.
