Two apparent isoforms of the virulence-associated 69,000-molecular-weight protein pertactin were purified from Bordetella pertussis. Mass spectrometry showed a difference of 2,060 Da, which may result from differential C-terminal cleavage of a larger precursor. Both forms were protective in a mouse model, eliciting bactericidal antibodies and reducing respiratory tract colonization.
