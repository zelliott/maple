In higher plants, the FtsZ protein, the ancestor of tubulin, has been shown to be implicated in both proplastid division, which occurs in dividing cells and in the division of the differentiated plastids present in non-dividing cells. Here we report studies on the expression of the two FtsZ gene families in higher plants, FtsZ1 and FtsZ2, in non-synchronized and synchronized tobacco BY2 cells. We have isolated and characterized members of each gene family from Nicotiana tabacum. Specific cDNA probes for each tobacco FtsZ gene family and polyclonal antibodies specific for the FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 proteins were obtained in order to determine mRNA and protein levels. A constant level of FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 transcripts and proteins was observed in non-synchronized cell cultures. However, a complex pattern of expression of both gene families was observed during the cell cycle in synchronized cells, with mRNA and protein levels peaking during cell division, thus implying that the FtsZ proteins may be involved in plastid transmission to the two daughter cells.
