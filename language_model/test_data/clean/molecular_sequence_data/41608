An extremely drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate, sequence type ST101, was isolated from a patient in Italy. We describe antibiotic treatment, measures to clear and contain the infection, and a complete sequence analysis of a novel large plasmid, pKPN101-IT, harboring the bla(KPC-2) gene and arising from the threatening recombination of different worldwide-distributed backbones.
