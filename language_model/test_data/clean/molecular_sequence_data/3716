Homeobox (Hox)-containing factors have been shown to play regulatory roles on lung development. Although HoxB3 gene expression is detected in the prenatal lung during development, its function has not been clarified precisely. We constructed an expression vector of a hamster HoxB3 coding region, which was cloned from hamster fetal lung cell line M3E3/C3. Sixteen-base deletion was found in the hamster HoxB3 coding sequence when compared with the mouse sequence. Under conditions of differentiation, cells transfected transiently with HoxB3 augmented the retinol-induced gene expression of Clara cell-specific secretory protein, whereas the cells showed reduced expression of surfactant-associated protein C. These alterations were attenuated by the transfection with HoxB3 antisense nucleotide. The results show that the cells with overexpressed HoxB3 were reinforced to have characteristics of Clara cells but did not have the characteristics of alveolar type II cells, and that HoxB3 played a stimulatory role on Clara cell differentiation in M3E3/C3 cells. In addition, the expression of Clara cell-specific secretory protein and surfactant-associated protein C genes was enhanced upon transfer of cells to collagen substrate, suggesting that collagen substrate has some regulatory functions on lung cell differentiation through cell adhesion.
