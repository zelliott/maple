A specific monoclonal antibody, M3A, was produced to rapidly purify Lactococcus lactis phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) for amino acid sequence analysis. M3A recognized the Lac. lactis PGI specifically and sensitively with both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis. The enzyme was rapidly purified to a specific activity of 21.8 U/mg with a yield of 20% by a three-step procedure, including M3A-bound Sepharose chromatography. The specific activity of PGI was increased about 64.1-fold from the cell lysate. The molecular mass of Lac. lactis PGI was estimated to be about 50 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of Lac. lactis PGI exhibited no significant similarity to other PGIs, except for a 52.6% identity to Bacillus stearothermophilus PGI A and PGI B. These results suggest that there might be some molecular types of PGI.
