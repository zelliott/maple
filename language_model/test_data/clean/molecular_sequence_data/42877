HSV-DNA of seven corneal lesions suspected with herpes simplex keratitis (HSK) and nine normal human donor corneas were detected by PCR. Five out of seven diseased corneas showed positive results, and the other two diseased corneas and nine normal corneas negative. The results suggest the PCR may be useful as a rapid and sensitive method for diagnosing HSK.
