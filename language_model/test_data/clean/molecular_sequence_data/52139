The circular physical map of the pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes LO28 (serovar 1/2c) was established by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The L. monocytogenes chromosome contains eight NotI fragments of 1,100, 940, 400, 335, 280, 45, 30, and 20 kb in size and eight Sse8387I fragments of 860, 680, 680, 370, 335, 130, 70, and 25 kb. Therefore, the total length of the genome is 3,150 kb. To order the NotI fragments on the chromosome, we used a strategy which can be of general use. We first cloned chromosomal HindIII or EcoRI fragments in pBR322. DNA extracted from the total libraries was digested by NotI and ligated to a NotI-kanamycin resistance cassette obtained by cutting Tn5 with NotI. After transformation in Escherichia coli, kanamycin-resistant clones originating from NotI-containing EcoRI or HindIII fragments were isolated. The two EcoRI-NotI or HindIII-NotI fragments of each recombinant plasmid were isolated and used as probes on Southern blot hybridizations to identify and link the corresponding NotI fragments. Seven NotI fragments were ordered in this way. The last junction was demonstrated by partial digest analysis. All L. monocytogenes genes identified so far as well as the six rRNA operons were localized on the NotI map. Regions homologous to genes from closely related bacteria were also detected and localized. Southern blot analysis of simple Sse8387I digests or double Sse8387I-NotI digests probed with the various NotI probes allowed us to align the Sse8387I fragments and localize the single SfiI site, resulting in the establishment of the first genetic and physical map of the L. monocytogenes chromosome.
