Cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) is one of the multiple factors required for polyadenylation of mammalian pre-mRNAs in vitro. We have shown previously that this factor is composed of three distinct subunits of 77, 64, and 50 kDa, and that the 64-kDa subunit can be UV-cross-linked to RNA in a polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA)-dependent manner. By molecular cloning, the 64-kDa subunit was shown to contain a ribonucleoprotein-type RNA binding domain and a novel repeat structure. To study the functions of the other subunits, we have now isolated cDNAs encoding the 50-kDa subunit of human CstF. This subunit shares extensive homology with mammalian G protein beta-subunits and has a characteristic repeat structure (transducin repeat), in which an approximately 44-amino acid-long sequence is repeated seven times. To our knowledge, the 50-kDa subunit is the first example of a functional beta-subunit-like protein in vertebrates. Possible roles of the transducin repeat, both in CstF function specifically and in other beta-subunit homologues more generally, are discussed.
