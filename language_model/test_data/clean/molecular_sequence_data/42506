Genetic polymorphism of the ALDH2 gene was analysed according to a new technique designated as amplification created restriction site (ACRS). A restriction site for the enzyme (Mbo II) was artificially created in the amplification product using an oligonucleotide primer possessing one mismatched base. Analysis using ACRS technique concerning 41 healthy controls and 63 alcoholics with liver diseases confirmed that the ALDH2 mutant was significantly lower in alcoholics than in healthy controls.
