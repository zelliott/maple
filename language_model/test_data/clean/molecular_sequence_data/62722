Although the molecular regulation of diapause remains largely unknown, there is an accumulation of data suggesting the involvement of heat-shock proteins in the expression of diapause or dormancy. However, Goto et al. [J. Insect Physiol. 44 (1998) 1009] reported that Drosophila triauraria does not express Hsp70 transcripts at normal temperatures, regardless of the diapause state. Here, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of other heat-shock-responsive genes (Hsp23, Hsp26, Hsp83 and Hsrw) in D. triauraria with relation to diapause. The results revealed that these genes are not regulated as a function of diapause, suggesting that they are not involved in the expression of diapause in this species.
