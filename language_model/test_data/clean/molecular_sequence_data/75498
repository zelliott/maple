The amino acid sequence of human placental aromatase was determined in part (about 40%) by microsequencing methods. Using a region of overlapping peptide sequences, synthetic oligonucleotide probes were constructed and used to screen a human placental lambda gt-11 cDNA library. Of a number of positive clones, one containing a 2.4-kb insert was characterized further by restriction mapping and determination of its nucleotide sequence. The cDNA-deduced amino acid sequence is in perfect agreement with the peptide sequence data, confirming that the clone encodes for aromatase. The sequence contains a 3' untranslated region of 1.2 kb, and an open-reading frame of 1.25 kb; approximately 0.3 kb is missing from the 5' end of the coding region. While exhibiting no more than 20-30% sequence homology with other mammalian cytochromes P450, it contains the highly conserved heme-binding domain, thus confirming the essential structural requirements for this class of protein. Two cDNA fragments containing sequences coding for the amino- and carboxy-portions of the protein were used to probe for the human aromatase gene by Southern blotting. The results of these studies suggest the existence of at least two human aromatase genes. The gene encoding the aromatase cDNA we cloned was assigned to human chromosome 15 using somatic cell hybrids. This gene was mapped to band 15q21.1 by in situ hybridization studies.
