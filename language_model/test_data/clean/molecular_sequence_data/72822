We previously reported the cloning of a human S10 cDNA which encodes a small GTP-binding protein belonging to the Rab subfamily. Here we describe a mouse S10 cDNA and its genomic structure. Mouse S10 is 92.3% homologous at the nucleotide level and 98.3% identical at the amino acid level compared to human S10. The mouse S10 gene is comprised of two exons and a single intron. Northern blotting of tissue RNAs indicates that the S10 gene is predominantly expressed in brain.
