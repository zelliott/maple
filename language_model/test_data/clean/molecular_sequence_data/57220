Dictyostelium alpha-actinin is a Ca(2+)-regulated F-actin cross-linking protein. To test the inhibitory function of the two EF hands, point mutations were introduced into either one or both Ca(2+)-binding sites. After mutations, the two EF hands were distinguishable with respect to their regulatory activities. Inactivation of EF hand I abolished completely the F-actin cross-linking activity of Dictyostelium discoideum alpha-actinin but Ca2+ binding by EF hand II was still observed in a 45Ca2+ overlay assay. In contrast, after mutation of EF hand II the molecule was still active and inhibited by Ca2+; however, approximately 500-fold more Ca2+ was necessary for inhibition and 45Ca2+ binding could not be detected in the overlay assay. These data indicate that EF hand I has a low affinity for Ca2+ and EF hand II a high affinity, implying a regulatory function of EF hand I in the inhibition of F-actin cross-linking activity. Biochemical data is presented which allows us to distinguish two functions of the EF hand domains in D. discoideum alpha-actinin: (a) at the level of the EF-hands, the Ca(2+)-binding affinity of EF hand I was increased by EF hand II in a cooperative manner, and (b) at the level of the two subunits, the EF hands acted as an on/off switch for actin-binding in the neighboring subunit. To corroborate in vitro observations in an in vivo system we tried to rescue the abnormal phenotype of a mutant (Witke, W., M. Schleicher, A. A. Noegel. 1992. Cell. 68:53-62) by introducing the mutated alpha-actinin cDNAs. In agreement with the biochemical data, only the molecule modified in EF hand II could rescue the abnormal phenotype. Considering the fact that the active construct is "always on" because it requires nonphysiological, high Ca2+ concentrations for inactivation, it is interesting to note that an unregulated alpha-actinin was able to rescue the mutant phenotype.
