The sequences of the V3 loop and surrounding regions of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 from a father-to-mother-to-infant trimmer were studied and the horizontal and vertical transmissions compared. The father's virus was variable for reactivity with neutralizing antibody and sequences of the V3 loop central core sequence. In contrast, the mother's viral sequences were much less diverse and reacted with a virus neutralizing antibody. The infant's viral sequences were also less diverse than those of the father, and N-glycosylation sites were conserved. By phylogenetic analysis, the major clone, of which V3-peptide reacted with the neutralizing antibody, was found to be transmitted from the mother to her infant; however, the mutated minor clones did not bind to the antibody. These findings suggest that both horizontal and vertical virus transmission were selective, and that the clonally transmitted virus in infants mutates more rapidly than viruses in the mother, to whom the virus was horizontally transmitted.
