Soybean meal (SBM), the major byproduct of soybean oil extraction, is the main protein source for swine diets globally. In the United States, 8.6 million metric tons of SBM was used in swine rations in 2004. The pathological effect and immunological response of SBM feeding have been demonstrated in swine. In this study, we have utilized plasma collected from piglet feed with SBM in immunoblot analysis to detect proteins that elicited antigenic responses. We have identified soybean beta-conglycinin alpha-subunit as being a potential allergen for young piglets. Characterization of this protein indicated that deglycosylation and pepsin digestion did not eliminate immunoreactivity of this protein. Epitope mapping utilizing planar cellulose supports technology (SPOT) showed that three peptides spanning amino acids S185-R231 were critical for the allergenicity. A computer-generated three-dimensional structure model of the alpha-subunit of beta-conglycinin indicated that the antigenic epitopes were located on the surface of the protein. Information from this study may assist in the construction of recombinant nonallergenic soybean protein useable for both immunotherapy and the potential production of hypoallergenic soybean plants.
