RIP (Repeat-Induced point Mutation) and PR (Premeiotic Recombination) are two developmentally regulated processes in filamentous ascomycetes. RIP detects and mutates duplicated DNA sequences, while PR results in deletion of the interstitial sequence between cis-duplicated DNA sequences. These two silencing processes take place between fertilization and premeiotic replication, a period during which the mating-type genes play an active role in several developmental processes. Previous studies have shown that mutations in the mating-type genes affect the development of the fruiting body. This study provides evidence that mutations in the mating-type genes reduce the frequency of RIP and PR. It establishes that alleles which have the more stringent effect on fruiting-body development, have also the strongest effect on RIP and PR frequencies. We propose two models for the relation between mating-type genes and RIP and PR, one based on the direct control of RIP and PR by mating-type regulatory proteins, the other based on an indirect effect through the control of a development step during which RIP and PR take place.
