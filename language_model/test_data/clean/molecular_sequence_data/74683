This study exploited the unusual lactation cycle of the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) to characterise milk composition during acute involution, a time when the mammary gland is subjected to increased risk of infection. In early-lactation, tammar milk contains elevated levels of complex oligosaccharides and low protein and lipid content. Later in lactation, protein and lipid concentrations increase significantly, whereas carbohydrate content is reduced dramatically and changes to monosaccharides. Following initiation of involution at early-lactation, the carbohydrate concentration greatly decreased, while lipid and protein concentrations were elevated, suggesting that complex oligosaccharides are the major osmole in milk at this time. In contrast, involution at late lactation, when carbohydrate concentration was very low, led to an increase in the lipid concentration, but the concentration of protein was not significantly altered. This indicates that protein synthesis during acute involution at late lactation in the tammar may be down-regulated much more rapidly than during early-lactation. Analysis of milk at day 3 after the onset of involution at early-lactation identified a number of potential antimicrobials secreted at high concentrations, including lysozyme, dermcidin, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor and fragments of beta-lactoglobulin. These proteins may protect the mammary gland by minimising the risk of potential infection during involution.
