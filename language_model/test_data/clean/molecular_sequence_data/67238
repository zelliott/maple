Germinal centers (GCs) have been identified as site at which the somatic mutation of immunoglobulins occurs.However, somatic mutations in immunoglobulins have also been observed in animals that normally do not harbor germinal centers. This clearly indicates that somatic mutations can occur in the absence of germinal centers. We therefore attempted to determine whether or not GCs exist in TNFR1-deficient mice, and are essential for the somatic mutation of immunoglobulins, using (4-hydroxy-3-nitropheny)acetyl-ovalbumin (NP-OVA). Both wild-type and TNFR1-deficient mice were immunized with NPOVA, and then examined with regard to the existence of GCs. No typical B-cell follicles were detected in the TNFR1-deficient mice. Cell proliferation was detected throughout all splenic tissue types, and no in vivo immunecomplex retention was observed in the TNFR1-deficient mice. All of these data strongly suggest that no GCs were formed in the TNFR1-deficient mice. Although TNFR1-deficient mice are unable to form GCs, serological analyses indicated that affinity maturation had been achieved in both the wild-type and TNFR1-deficient mice. We therefore isolated and sequenced several DNA clones from wild-type and the TNFR1-deficient mice. Eight out of 12 wild-type clones, and 11 out of 14 clones of the TNFR-1-deficient mice contained mutations at the CDR1 site. Thus, the wild-type and TNFR1-deficient mice were not extremely different with regard to types and rates of somatic mutation. Also, high-affinity antibodies were detected in both types of mice. Collectively, our data appear to show that affinity maturation may occur in TNFR1-deficient mice, which completely lack GCs.
