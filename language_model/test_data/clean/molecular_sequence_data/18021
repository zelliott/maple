In this paper we describe the isolation and characterization of a genomic clone (Bp4) from Brassica napus which contains three members of a pollen-specific multigene family. This family is composed of 10 to 15 closely related genes which are expressed in early stages of microspore development. The complete nucleotide sequence of the clone Bp4 and of three homologous cDNA clones is reported. One of the genes (Bp4B) contained in the genomic clone is believed to be non-functional because of sequence rearrangements in its 5' region and intron splicing sites. The remaining genes (Bp4A and Bp4C), as well as the cDNA clones, appear to code for small proteins of unique structure. Three different types of proteins can be predicted as a result of the deletion of carboxy or amino terminal portions of a conserved core protein. These proteins all share a common alternation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains. A fragment of the genomic clone containing the gene Bp4A, as well as the non-functional gene Bp4B, was introduced into tobacco plants via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The functional gene Bp4A is expressed in transgenic tobacco plants and shows spatial and temporal regulation consistent with the expression patterns seen in Brassica napus.
