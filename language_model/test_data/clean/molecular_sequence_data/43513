Thromboxane A2 plays physiological and pathophysiological roles in many tissues. We isolated a cDNA for rat thromboxane synthase from the kidney and here show the location of rat thromboxane synthase gene (Tbxas) on rat chromosome 4q21-->q22 by fluorescence in situ hybridization to metaphase chromatin of rat lymphocytes.
