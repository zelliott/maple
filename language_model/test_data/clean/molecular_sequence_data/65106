This article deals with the effects of proline hydroxylation on collagen triple-helix stability, an issue that is still under discussion. To investigate the structural determinants of triple-helix stabilization by hydroxyproline (Hyp), we here characterized spectroscopically triple-helix heterotrimers containing both chains of (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 and (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10. Results are discussed in relation to the various triple-helix stabilization mechanisms.
