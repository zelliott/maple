A highly abundant and heterogeneous small RNA about 205 to 210 bases long named MP200 RNA has been identified in Mycoplasma pneumoniae. It was localized on the genome within a 319-bp-long intergenic space of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (pdh) gene cluster. A database search at the DNA level revealed the highest similarity to a sequence located within the pdh gene cluster of Mycoplasma genitalium that was also shown to be transcribed into two abundant, but smaller RNAs than the ones in Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The RNAs from both M. pneumoniae and M. genitalium have the potential to code for cysteine-rich 29- and 23-amino-acid-long peptides, but so far, these peptides have not been identified experimentally in bacterial protein extracts.
