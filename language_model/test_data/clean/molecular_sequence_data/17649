To examine whether constituent proteins of hemidesmosomal structures can be used as markers for certain pathways of epithelial differentiation we have examined the occurrence of the major M- approximately 230,000 plaque protein, the "bullous pemphigoid" (BP) antigen. Several bovine, rat and human tissues and bovine cell culture lines were examined, using different human autoantibody preparations in immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting. We report that this protein, also unequivocally identified by cDNA cloning from expression libraries and DNA sequencing, occurs not only in different stratified epithelia but also, apparently always in hemidesmosomal structures, in urothelium of bladder and the complex epithelia of trachea, bronchus and several glands, notably myoepithelium-containing skin glands, the mammary gland and salivary glands. The protein is absent, however, in all single-layered epithelia and in several tissues reported to have subplasmalemmal densities structurally similar to hemidesmosomes, such as Purkinje fibers of heart, meninges and perineuria. A mammary-gland-derived epithelial cell line (BMGE + H) is particularly rich in hemidesmosomes. This has been used to study the endocytotic uptake of hemidesmosome-containing plasma membrane domains into cytoplasmic vesicles upon detachment of cell sheets during treatment with dispase, a proteolytic enzyme. We propose to use the Mr- approximately 230,000 plaque protein as a marker selective for certain subsets of epithelial cell types and epithelium-derived tumors in studies of fetal and tumor development, including differentiation diagnosis of carcinomas.
