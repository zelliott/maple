In the case of the malaria CS protein we have shown that there is at least one T cell determinant which is able to bind to and be recognized by most human MHC class II molecules, while for the 190L polypeptide, derived from a conserved region of the p190 merozoite surface protein, we have identified several epitopes recognized by T cell clones in association with different HLA-class II isotypes and alleles. In addition, binding analysis of these epitopes indicated that most of the peptides are able to bind to multiple allelic forms of class II molecules. Although there are important obstacles to malaria vaccine development we believe that, in the light of these results, unresponsiveness in humans, caused by MHC restriction, might not be a major constraint in development of a subunit vaccine.
