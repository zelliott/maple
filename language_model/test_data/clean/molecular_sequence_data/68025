A panel of eight monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was obtained against recombinant hirudin variant 2 (rHV2). Specificities of the eight MAbs indicate that four of them recognize C-terminal amino acid residues (Group A) and four are directed against discontinuous epitopes and recognize a determinant (or determinants) within the 43 N-terminal residues (Group B). Using these antibodies recombinant hirudins missing one or more C-terminal amino acids can be distinguished from molecules with an intact C-terminus either in enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) or by immunoaffinity chromatography. A sandwich EIA using the combination of two antibodies, one from each group, can quantitate both recombinant hirudin variant 1 (rHV1) and rHV2 with a detection range from 1 to 10 ng/ml in either buffer or plasma. Using only one MAb a competitive antibody capture EIA can quantitate recombinant or natural hirudin variants 1, 2, and 3 with a detection range from 5 to 100 ng/ml for rHV2 with a lysine in position 47 (rHV2K47). None of the antibodies recognizes hirudin after it is complexed to alpha-thrombin. The ability of any one of these anti-rHV2 antibodies to interfere with hirudin binding to alpha-thrombin as measured by inhibition of thrombin's amidolytic activity correlates with the range of MAb affinity constants (KD = 3.5 x 10(-9) to 1 x 10(-6) M). Incubating hirudin with one antibody from Group A (KD = 3.5 x 10(-8) M) and one from Group B (KD = 6.0 x 10(-9) M) completely blocks the ability of hirudin to bind alpha-thrombin. This MAb panel is thus useful for probing the recombinant C-terminal integrity of hirudin, for sensitive free hirudin quantitations, and the combined use of two MAbs has potential applications as an antidote for hirudin in vivo.
