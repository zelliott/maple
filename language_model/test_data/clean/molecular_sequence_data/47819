Recombinant, insect cell derived SIV Pr56(gag) virus-like particles (VLPs) have been modified either by inserting HIV-1 Gp160 derived peptides into the Pr56(gag) precursor or by integrating the complete HIV-1 gp120 in the particle membrane. To investigate the protective efficacy of these particulate antigens, rhesus macaques were immunized with VLPs both adjuvant-free or adsorbed to alum. In addition, recombinant Semliki Forest viruses (SFV) expressing proteins corresponding to the VLP constructs were established and administered as live vaccines in combination with particulate antigens. Vaccination induced specific humoral responses irrespective of the immunization regimen. However, in contrast to Pr56(gag)-specific antibodies, Env-specific antibody titers could not be increased by booster immunizations in this study. Cell-mediated immune responses were detected following vaccination with VLP-preparations as well as recombinant SFVs. A tendency towards stimulating both enhanced cell mediated as well as humoral immune responses was observed following priming with recombinant SFVs. Upon challenge with SHIV-4 all vaccinated monkeys became infected. However, animals, that were vaccinated with VLPs presenting the complete gp120, managed to clear virus faster than nonimmunized controls. The observed virus elimination significantly correlated with an anamnestic antibody response and an accelerated appearance of neutralizing antibodies postchallenge.
