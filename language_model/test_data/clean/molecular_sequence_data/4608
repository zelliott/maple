We have investigated the subunit composition and the molecular structure of the CNG channel expressed in rat pineal gland. Three types of subunits have been cloned: an alpha-subunit (CNG1), two beta-subunit splice variants (rCNG4.1 and rCNG4.2) and a hydrophilic glutamic acid-rich protein (rGARP). In situ hybridization with sections of rat brain revealed the co-expression of CNG1, CNG4 and GARP in pinealocytes. In addition, CNG4-specific transcripts were detected in the arcuate, periventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus.
