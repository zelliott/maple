X-ray crystal structures of two non-nucleoside analogue inhibitors bound to hepatitis C virus NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase have been determined to 2.0 and 2.9 A resolution. These noncompetitive inhibitors bind to the same site on the protein, approximately 35 A from the active site. The common features of binding include a large hydrophobic region and two hydrogen bonds between both oxygen atoms of a carboxylate group on the inhibitor and two main chain amide nitrogen atoms of Ser(476) and Tyr(477) on NS5B. The inhibitor-binding site lies at the base of the thumb domain, near its interface with the C-terminal extension of NS5B. The location of this inhibitor-binding site suggests that the binding of these inhibitors interferes with a conformational change essential for the activity of the polymerase.
