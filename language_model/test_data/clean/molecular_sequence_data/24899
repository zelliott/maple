The virulence of six pigeon-origin isolates of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was evaluated before and after passage in white leghorn chickens. Four isolates were defined as pigeon paramyxovirus-1 (PPMV-1) and two isolates were classified as avian paramyxovirus-1 (APMV-1) with NDV monoclonal antibodies. The four PPMV-1 isolates were passaged four times in chickens, and the APMV-1 isolates were passaged only once. Infected birds were monitored clinically and euthanatized. Tissues were collected for histopathology, in situ hybridization with a NDV matrix gene digoxigenin-labeled riboprobe, and immunohistochemistry with an anti-peptide antibody to the nucleoprotein. Mean death time, intracerebral pathogenicity index, and intravenous pathogenicity index tests performed before and after passage in chickens demonstrated increased virulence of the passaged PPMV-1 isolates and high virulence of the original isolates of APMV-1. Sequence analysis of the fusion protein cleavage site of all six isolates demonstrated a sequence typical of the virulent pathotype. Although the pathotyping results indicated a virulence increase of all passaged PPMV-1 isolates, clinical disease was limited to depression and some nervous signs in only some of the 4-wk-old specific-pathogen-free white leghorns inoculated intraconjunctivally. However, an increased frequency of clinical signs and some mortality occurred in 2 wk olds inoculated intraconjunctivally with passaged virus. Histologically, prominent lesions in heart and brain were observed in birds among all four groups inoculated with the PPMV-1 isolates. The behavior of the two pigeon-origin APMV-1 isolates when inoculated into chickens was characteristic of velogenic viscerotropic NDVs and included necro-hemorrhagic lesions in the gastrointestinal tract.
