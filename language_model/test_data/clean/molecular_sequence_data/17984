We have identified and isolated cDNA clones of the 33 kDa protein of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEE1) from Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) and Arabidopsis thaliana and determined their nucleotide sequences. The cDNA clones and antibodies prepared against OEE1 were used as probes to examine the expression of the oee1 gene with respect to regulation by light, organ specificity, and ripening stage of tomato fruit. The steady-state mRNA level is regulated by light, being present in light-grown plants and absent in etiolated seedlings. The oee1 transcripts that accumulate during growth in the light were reduced to non-detectable or low levels by a 3-day dark treatment. The oee1 gene also exhibits differential expression in various organs of the tomato plant. Steady-state mRNA level was highest in immature leaves and absent in roots while the protein was most abundant in mature leaves and absent in roots. During tomato fruit ripening oee1 mRNA decreases to a low level in the pericarp while the protein level decreases below detection. The expression of oee1 appears to be under the control of a complex mechanism regulating both the amount of RNA and its translation.
