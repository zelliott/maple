Alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain NG-27 produces a 42-kDa endoxylanase active at 70 degrees C and at a pH of 8.4. The gene for this endoxylanase was cloned and sequenced. The gene contained one open reading frame of 1,215 bases. An active site characteristic of the family 10 beta-glycanases was recognized between amino acids 303 and 313, with the active glutamate at position 310. Though highly thermostable, the enzyme contains no cysteine residue.
