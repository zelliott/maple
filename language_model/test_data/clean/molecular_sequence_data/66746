We had previously reported that Vibrio hollisae produces aerobactin in response to iron starvation. In the present study, we identified in V. hollisae ATCC33564 the aerobactin system cluster which consists of eight genes, hatCDB, iucABCD and iutA. The hatCDB genes encode proteins homologous to components of bacterial ATP binding cassette transport systems for ferric aerobactin. The iucABCD and iutA orthologs code for aerobactin biosynthesis enzymes and the ferric aerobactin receptor, respectively. In accordance with their iron-regulated expression, putative Fur box sequences were found within the respective promoter regions of hatC, iucA and iutA. The monocistronic iutA transcript was detected by northern blotting. Moreover, phenotypic comparison between the wild-type strain and its targeted gene disruptants supported the biological functions that were expected for the respective operons and genes on the basis of the homology search. The arrangement of the aerobactin gene clusters thus far found in Vibrio and enterobacterial species was compared and discussed from an evolutionary point of view.
