The gene encoding a novel modular xylanase from Cellulosimicrobium sp. strain HY-13 was identified and expressed in Escherichia coli, and its truncated gene product was characterized. The enzyme consisted of three distinct functional domains, an N-terminal catalytic GH10 domain, a fibronectin type 3 domain, and C-terminal carbohydrate-binding module 2.
