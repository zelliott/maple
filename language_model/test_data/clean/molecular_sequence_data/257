An actinomycete strain, designated HBUM 170018(T), was isolated from soil from Hebei Province, China, and subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic analysis. This study included morphological and physiological investigations and analyses concerning cell chemistry, genomic DNA G+C content, DNA-DNA hybridization and phylogeny. The data obtained were consistent with the assignment of strain HBUM 170018(T) to the genus Streptosporangium and were confirmed by the results of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Strain HBUM 170018(T) can be differentiated from all Streptosporangium species with validly published names with reference to phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic data and DNA-DNA hybridization results. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, DNA-DNA hybridization and phenotypic data, strain HBUM 170018(T) represents a novel species of the genus Streptosporangium, for which the name Streptosporangium canum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is HBUM 170018(T) (=7177(T) =DSM 45034(T) =CGMCC 4.2126(T)).
