When simian virus 40 (SV40) is serially passaged at high multiplicity, a heterogeneous collection of naturally arising variants is generated. Those which are the most abundant presumably have a selective replicative advantage over other defective and wild-type helper SV40s. Two such naturally arising host-substituted variants of SV40 have been characterized in terms of complete nucleotide sequence determination. Evolutionary variant ev-1101 (previously isolated by Lee et al., Virology 66:53-69, 1975) is from undiluted serial passage 13, whereas ev-2101 is newly isolated from undiluted serial passage 6 of an independently-derived evolutionary series. Both variants contain a five-times tandemly repeated segment of DNA consisting of viral Hin C and Hin A sequences that have recombined with a segment of host DNA that is not highly reiterated in the monkey genome. The monkey segment differs in the two variants as does the size of the viral segment retained. In two additional host-substituted variants, ev-1102 (previously isolated from serial passage 20 by Brockman et al., Virology 54:384-397, 1973) and ev-1108 (newly isolated from serial passage 40), the SV40 sequences derived from the replication origin are present as inverted repetitions. The inverted repeat regions of these two variants have been analyzed at the nucleotide sequence level and are compared with SV40 variant ev-1104 from passage 45 (previously characterized by Gutai and Nathans, J. Mol. Biol. 126:259-274, 1978). The viral segment containing the regulatory signals for replication and viral gene expression is considerably shortened in later serial passages as demonstrated by these five variants. It is of interest that the variants presumably arose due to their enhanced replication efficiency, yet are missing some of the sequence elements implicated in the regulation of replication. Furthermore, a comparison of the structure of the replication origin regions indicates that additional changes occur in the SV40 regulatory region with continued undiluted serial passage.
