Rapid turnover of the c-myc message mediates both the low basal level of mRNA and the rapid response to changes in transcription. The primary RNA instability determinant (RID sequence) resides in the 3' untranslated region (UTR), within an 80 base region that is rich in A and U residues. In contrast to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) mRNA in which the RID sequence has been mapped to a repeating AUUUA sequence, mutation of the only copy of this sequence in the c-myc 3' UTR has no effect on RNA turnover. Thus the c-myc RID sequence appears to be quite different from that of GM-CSF, which may account for the differential regulation of half-life exhibited by these mRNAs. c-myc mRNA turnover is also tightly coupled to translation since translational inhibitors stabilize this mRNA. Mutation of the initiating AUG to a termination codon stabilizes c-myc RNA, arguing that loading with polysomes (perhaps accompanied by localization on the cytoskeleton) is also required for proper message turnover.
