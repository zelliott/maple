The delayed rectifier K+ current (IK) in rabbit heart has long been thought to consist of only a single, rapidly activating, dofetilide-sensitive current, IKr. However, we find that IK of rabbit ventricular myocytes actually consists of both rapid and slow components, IKr and IKs, respectively, that can be isolated pharmacologically. Thus, after complete blockade of IKr with dofetilide, the remaining current, IKs, is homogeneous as judged by an envelope of tails test. IKs activates and deactivates slowly, continues to activate during sustained depolarizations, has a half-activation potential of 7.0 +/- 0.8 mV and slope factor of 11.0 +/- 0.7 mV, reverses at -77.2 +/- 1.3 mV (extracellular K+ concentration = 4 mM), is increased by removing extracellular K+, and is enhanced by isoproterenol and stocked by azimilide. Northern analysis demonstrates that the minK (IsK) gene, which encodes a subunit of the channel that underlies the IKs current, is expressed in rabbit heart. Expression of the rabbit protein in Xenopus oocytes elicits a slowly activating, voltage-dependent current, IsK, similar to those expressed previously from mouse, rat, guinea pig, and human genes. The results demonstrate that IKs is present in rabbit ventricle and therefore contributes to cardiac repolarization in this species.
