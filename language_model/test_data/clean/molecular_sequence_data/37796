Heparan sulfate proteoglycans play a pivotal role in tissue function, development, inflammation, and immunity. We have identified a novel cDNA encoding human heparanase, an enzyme thought to cleave heparan sulfate in physiology and disease, and have located the HEP gene on human chromosome 4q21. Monoclonal antibodies against human heparanase located the enzyme along invasive extravillous trophoblasts of human placenta and along endothelial cells in organ xenografts targeted by hyperacute rejection, both sites of heparan sulfate digestion. Heparanase deposition was evident in arterial walls in normal tissues; however, vascular heparan sulfate cleavage was coincident with heparanase enzyme during inflammatory episodes. These findings suggest that heparanase elaboration and control of catalytic activity may contribute to the development and pathogenesis of vascular disease and suggest that heparanase intervention might be a useful therapeutic target.
