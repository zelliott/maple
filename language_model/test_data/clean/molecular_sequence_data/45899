Identifying appropriate tumor antigens is critical to the development of successful specific cancer immunotherapy. Serological analysis of tumor antigens by a recombinant cDNA expression library (SEREX) allows the systematic cloning of tumor antigens recognized by the spontaneous autoantibody repertoire of cancer patients. We applied SEREX to the cDNA expression library of cell line HMy2, which led to the isolation of six known characterized genes and 12 novel genes. Known genes, including ring finger protein 167, KLF10, TPT1, p02 protein, cDNA FLJ46859 fis, and DNMT1, were related to the development of different tumors. Bioinformatics was performed to predict 12 novel MMSA (multiple myeloma special antigen) genes. The prediction of tumor antigens provides potential targets for the immunotherapy of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and help in the understanding of carcinogenesis. Crude lysate ELISA methodology indicated that the optical density value of MMSA-3 and MMSA-7 were significantly higher in MM patients than in healthy donors. Furthermore, SYBR Green real-time PCR showed that MMSA-1 presented with a high number of copy messages in MM. In summary, the antigens identified in this study may be potential candidates for diagnosis and targets for immunotherapy in MM.
