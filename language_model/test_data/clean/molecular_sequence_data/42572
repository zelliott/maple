Reaction of (+/-)-(3/4,5,6)-4-bromo-5,6-epoxy-3-hydroxycyclohexene with 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-1-thio-alpha-D-glucopyranose, followed by treatment of the resulting isolated diastereoisomeric 4-bromo-3,5-dihydroxycyclohexene 1-thioglycoside derivatives with base under phase-transfer conditions, gave (R)- and (S)-(3,4,6/5)-3,4-epoxy-6-S-(1-thio-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-5- hydroxycyclohexene. None of them was substrate or inhibitor for cockchafer trehalase.
