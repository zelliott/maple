To identify the genetic defect in a five-generation Chinese family with congenital Y-suture cataracts.

A five-generation Chinese family with inherited Y-suture cataract phenotype was recruited. Detailed family history and clinical data of the family were recorded. Candidate genes sequencing was performed to screen out the disease-causing mutation.

The congenital cataract phenotype of the family was identified as Y-suture cataract type by using slit-lamp photography. Direct sequencing revealed a G→T splice site mutation in crystallin, beta A1 (CRYBA1/A3).This mutation co-segregated with all affected individuals in the family and was not found in unaffected family members or 100 unrelated controls.

Our study identified a novel type of a splice site mutation in CRYBA1/A3 .The mutation was responsible for the congenital Y-suture cataracts in the family. This is the first report relating a G→T mutation of CRYBA1/A3 to congenital Y-suture cataract.
