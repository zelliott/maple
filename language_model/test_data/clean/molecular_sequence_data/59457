Fragments of 5' end and 3' end of the coat protein gene of a Chinese strain grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV-Gh) were separately amplified through RT-PCR. The two products were cloned and ligated into a complete full-length coat protein gene via an inherent BgIII restriction site. The entire gene contains 1512 nucleotides which encode a 504 amino acids coat protein, molecular weight approximately 56 kDa. Comparison with GFLV F-13 shows 88.4% homology in nucleotides and 95.8% similarity in deduced amino acid residues. Also this coat protein gene was expressed in E. coli DH 5 alpha.
