An attempt has been made to construct a 3-D model of rhodopsin, a member of G-protein coupled receptors. Sequence homology of rhodopsin with the latter was a factor considered in the modeling procedure. The constructed model has been used to compare currently available specific protein/substrate interaction information, the shape of the binding cavity derived from shape of binding retinal isomers and analogs and challenged to explain recently available results from a series of fluorinated rhodopsins.
