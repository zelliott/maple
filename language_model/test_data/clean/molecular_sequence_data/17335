In a previous study, we isolated and characterized a new serotype k of Streptococcus mutans from human blood and oral cavities. Analysis of the genes involved in biosynthesis of the serotype-specific polysaccharide of serotype k strains revealed that the serotype k-specific nucleotide alignment was commonly present in the 5' region of the rgpF gene (350 bp from the initial sequence) compared to the reference strains, and then a method for rapid identification of serotype k strains was developed by use of PCR with primers designed on the basis of the sequence of the variable region. PCR assays with primers specific for amplification of serotype k strains showed a negative reaction with serotype c, e, and f strains and a positive reaction with serotype k strains, with the sensitivity for identification of the serotype k strains shown to range from 5 to 50 cells. Next, the frequency of positive reactions for serotype k-specific primers was surveyed with DNA taken from saliva samples from 200 subjects (2 to 18 years of age), and 10 of those showed a positive reaction, which was higher than the frequency in our previous survey with a serological method. In addition, all saliva samples from subjects with serotype k strains in our previous study were shown to be positive with the serotype k-specific primers. These results indicate that this new PCR method is effective for identification of subjects with S. mutans serotype k.
