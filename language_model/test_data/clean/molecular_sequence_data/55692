Studies of simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA replication in vitro have identified a small (approximately 30-nucleotide) RNA-DNA hybrid species termed primer-DNA. Initial experiments indicated that T antigen and the polymerase alpha-primase complex are required to form primer-DNA. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and presumably proliferating cell nuclear antigen-dependent polymerases, is not needed to form this species. Herein, we present an investigation of the stages at which primer-DNA functions during SV40 DNA replication in vitro. Hybridization studies indicate that primer-DNA is initially formed in the origin region and is subsequently synthesized in regions distal to the origin. At all time points, primer-DNA is synthesized from templates for lagging-strand DNA replication. These studies indicate that primer-DNA functions during both initiation and elongation stages of SV40 DNA synthesis. Results of additional experiments suggesting a precursor-product relationship between formation of primer-DNA and Okazaki fragments are presented.
