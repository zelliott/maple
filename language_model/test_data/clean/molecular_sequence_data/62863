The genes encoding the subunits for the F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase from Bacillus sp. strain TA2.A1 were cloned as three overlapping fragments and sequenced. The nine genes were organized in an operon with the gene order atpIBEFHAGDC encoding the i, a, c, b, delta, alpha, gamma, beta, and epsilon subunits, respectively. Northern blot analysis showed a maximum transcript of approximately 7.2 kb, which corresponds to the size of the atp operon and demonstrated that the nine genes are transcribed as a single polycistronic message. The alkaliphilic-specific residues Lys(218) and Gly(245) were conserved in subunit a of strain TA2.A1. Analysis of the C-terminal domain of the epsilon subunit showed several clusters of basic residues which are predicted to form a strong electrostatic interaction with the DELSDED motif in the beta subunit from strain TA2.A1, and may explain the blockage of this enzyme in the ATP hydrolysis direction.
