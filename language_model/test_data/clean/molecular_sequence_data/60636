The cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) is a common murid rodent of the southern United States, Mexico, and Central America. Using single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing techniques, 11 DQA exon 2 alleles were detected among 180 S. hispidus from Caddo County, Oklahoma, USA. The alleles represent a single locus exhibiting a high level of polymorphism. Nucleotide and amino acid distance values among DQA alleles of S. hispidus were higher than those within Mus musculus and species of Rattus. Although the distribution of polymorphic amino acid residues among alleles of S. hispidus was similiar to that of Mus and Rattus, some residues of the alpha-helix region were more variable in S. hispidus. Comparisons of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions indicated a trend toward higher numbers of nonsynonymous substitutions; however, this difference was not significant statistically among S. hispidus alleles. To examine evolution of DQA alleles within Muridae, we performed a phylogenetic analysis that included DQA alleles from S. hispidus, Peromyscus leucopus, M. musculus, R. norvegicus, and six Australian species of Rattus. Results depicted monophyly for each genus, and this concordance between species and gene trees represents a lack of evidence for trans-species persistence of alleles among these genera.
