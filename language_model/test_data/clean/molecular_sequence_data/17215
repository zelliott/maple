Melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) gene, one of the important candidate genes for coat color trait, was used to analyze the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in Chinese native pig breeds by PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP). The study had also taken 3 imported pig breeds as control. The results showed that the three mutations G284A, T309C and T364C found in Chinese native pigs were consistent to the mutation found in the European Large Black individuals. However, 68CC or C492T and G728A were only found in the imported individuals, which were obviously different from the Chinese native pigs. Accordingly, we presumed that the coat colors of Chinese native pigs belonged to dominant black color system, which was completely distinct to that of imported pig breeds. Thus it was implied that MC1R gene was not the principal factor affecting the coat color differences of Chinese native pig breeds, but could be used to trace the molecular evolution of pig breeds.
