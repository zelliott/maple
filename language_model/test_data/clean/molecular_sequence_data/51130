A cDNA library, constructed from bovine heart endothelial cell poly(A)+ RNA, was screened using a BstXI fragment of human von Willebrand and factor (vWF) cDNA as a probe. This probe codes for the major adhesion domain of vWF that includes the GPIb, collagen and heparin binding domains. Of the ten positive clones obtained, a clone that spanned the region of interest was sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide method yielding a sequence of 1550 bp. This region of the bovine cDNA codes for amino acids corresponding to #262 to #777 in human vWF and encompasses the entire pro adhesion domain. Both the nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence are 82% homologous to those of human vWF. Cysteine residues #471, 474, 509 and 695, which form intrachain bonds in human vWF, are also present in the bovine vWF sequence.
