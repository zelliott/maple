It has been hypothesized from isozymic and cytological studies of Elymus species that the Old and New World taxa may be of separate origin of the H genome in the StH genome species. To test this hypothesis, and estimate the phylogenetic relationships of polyploid Elymus species within the Triticeae, the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2) sequence of 36 Elymus accessions containing StH or StY genomes was analyzed with those of Pseudoroegneria (St), Hordeum (H), Agropyron (P), Australopyrum (W), Lophopyrum(Ee), Thinopyrum(Eb) and Dasypyrum (V). Our data indicated that the H genome in Elymus species is differentiated in accordance with geographical origin, and that the Eurasian and American StH genome species have independent alloploid origins with different H-genome donors. Phylogenetic analysis of Y genome sequences with other genome donors (St, H, P, W) of Elymus revealed that W and P genomes are sister to Y genome with a 87% bootstrap support, and that StY and StH species group might have acquired their RPB2 St sequences from distinct Pseudoroegneria gene pools. Our data did not support the suggestion that the St and Y genomes have the same origin as put forward in a previous study using ITS data. Our result provides some insight on the origin of Y genome and its relationship to other genomes in Elymus.
