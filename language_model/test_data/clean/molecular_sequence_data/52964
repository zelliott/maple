The secretory granules of neuroendocrine cells, which contain large amounts of Ca(2+) and chromogranins, have been demonstrated to release Ca(2+) in response to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)), indicating the IP(3)-sensitive intracellular Ca(2+) store role of secretory granules. In our previous study, chromogranin A (CGA) was shown to interact with several secretory granule membrane proteins, including the IP(3) receptor (IP(3)R), at the intravesicular pH 5.5 (Yoo, S. H. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 12001-12006). To examine the functional aspect of this coupling, we measured the IP(3)-mediated Ca(2+) release property of the IP(3)R reconstituted into liposomes in the presence and absence of CGA. Presence of CGA in the IP(3)R-reconstituted liposome significantly enhanced the IP(3)-mediated Ca(2+) release from the liposomes. Moreover, the number of IP(3) bound to the reconstituted IP(3)R increased. The fluorescence energy transfer and IP(3)R Trp fluorescence quenching studies indicated that the structure of reconstituted IP(3)R becomes more ordered and exposed in the presence of CGA, suggesting that the coupled CGA in the liposome caused structural changes of the IP(3)R, changing it to a structure that is better suited to IP(3) binding and subsequent Ca(2+) release. These results appear to underscore the physiological significance of IP(3)R-CGA coupling in the secretory granules.
