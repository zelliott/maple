The nucleotide sequence of gene 6 encoding the rotavirus major capsid protein VP6 of EDIM strain (EW) was determined and compared to that of 20 previously reported strains with known subgroup specificities. Multiple alignments of amino acid sequences exhibited a high level of sequence conservation (87 to 99.2%). Site-specific mutagenesis experiments were undertaken to localize regions involved in subgroup specificity. Amino acid positions 305, 315, and a region 296-299 (or 301 for equine strain H-2) were identified as contributing to subgroup epitopes. A single amino acid mutation at position 305 or 315 was sufficient to change the subgroup specificity of EW VP6 protein from non I/II to subgroup I- or subgroup II-like, respectively. Mutation at these sites may be another important mechanism for subgroup variation, along with gene reassortment.
