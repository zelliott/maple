The Ca(2+)-activated K+ current IAHP, which underlies spike frequency adaptation in cortical pyramidal cells, can be modulated by multiple transmitters and probably contributes to state control of the forebrain by ascending monoaminergic fibers. Here, we show that the modulation of this current by norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine is mediated by protein kinase A in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Two specific protein kinase A inhibitors, Rp-cAMPS and Walsh peptide, suppressed the effects of these transmitters on IAHP and spike frequency adaptation. The effects of the cyclic AMP analog 8CPT-cAMP were also inhibited, whereas muscarinic and metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists had full effect. Intracellular application of protein kinase A catalytic subunit or a phosphatase inhibitor mimicked the effects of monoamines or 8CPT-cAMP. These results demonstrate that monoaminergic modulation of neuronal excitability in the mammalian CNS is mediated by protein phosphorylation.
