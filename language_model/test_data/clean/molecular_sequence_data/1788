The sequences of the 3'-terminal 1306 and 2160 nucleotides of RNAs 1 and 2 of a virus serologically related to Satsuma dwarf virus (SDV) from Hyuganatsu ( Citrus tamurana Hort. ex Tan.) were determined, respectively. We found that the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region in RNA1 and the coat proteins (CPs) region in RNA2 of the virus tentatively named Hyuganatsu virus (HV) have 78.3-84.0% and 76.9-80.7% amino acid sequence identities to those of known SDV-related viruses (SDV-RVs), i.e., SDV, Citrus mosaic virus, and Navel orange infectious mottling virus. Sequence analyses show that HV is classifiable as a new SDV-RV species.
