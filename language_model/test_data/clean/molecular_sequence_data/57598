Lectins conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in combination with selected exoglycosidase digestion procedures were used to localize fucoglycoconjugates in the bovine submandibular gland. In particular, sequential treatments were employed to determine the distribution of neutral and acidic fucose-containing oligosaccharides that were previously shown to be present by biochemical techniques. Information was obtained on the distribution of the acidic oligosaccharide A-1a, alpha-Fuc(1-->2)-beta-Gal-(1-->4)-beta-GlcNAc-(1-->3)-[alpha-NeuAc-(2--> 6)]-GalNAc-ol, which was sequenced in situ and localized in acinar cells.
