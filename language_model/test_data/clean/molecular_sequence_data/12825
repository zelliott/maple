A DNA segment containing the 5'-upstream region and amino terminal reading frame of the gastric intrinsic factor gene was cloned from rat and its nucleotide sequence was determined. S1 mapping demonstrated that the transcription initiation site is located downstream of the second TATA-box sequence. Similar sequence motifs to those in the pepsinogen genes transcribed in gastric chief cells were found in the deduced sequence, suggesting that the rat intrinsic factor gene is transcribed in these cells. The genes for the intrinsic factor and its homologous protein transcobalamin I were apparently derived from a common ancestoral gene, since the positions of their intron insertions as well as the amino acid residues are conserved. Northern blot hybridization showed that the gene for the intrinsic factor is transcribed in the stomach but not detectably in the intestine, kidney, testis, brain, heart, liver, lung, or spleen. In situ hybridization using radioactive complementary RNA clearly indicated that the major transcription site in gastric glands is chief cells. Different locations of expression of intrinsic factor proteins in various mammals were observed previously using antibodies: in rat parietal cells and chief cells, in mouse chief cells, and in human parietal cells. The present results clearly demonstrated the intrinsic factor mRNA mainly in chief cells of adult rats, as in mice, suggesting that transcriptional regulation of the intrinsic factor gene is essentially the same in rodents.
