Major histocompatibility (MHC) class II molecules function to present antigenic peptides to CD4 T lymphocytes. The pathways by which these molecules present exogenous antigens have been extensively studied. However by contrast, far less is known about the processing and trafficking of cytosolic antigens, which can also serve as an alternative source of ligands for MHC class II molecules. Self-proteins, tumor antigens, as well as viral proteins found within the cytosol of cells, can be presented via MHC class II molecules, resulting in the activation of specific CD4 T cells. Studies have begun to reveal unique steps as well as some similarities in the pathways for cytosolic and exogenous antigen presentation. Recent developments in this area are summarized here.
