Single amino acid substitutions have been introduced throughout the N-terminal DNA binding region of the Mnt repressor, and the operator binding properties of the resulting mutant repressors have been assayed. These studies show that the side chains of Arg2, His6, Asn8, and Arg10 are critical for high affinity binding to operator DNA. Other side chains in the N-terminal region do not appear to play major roles in DNA recognition and binding. Specific alterations in the pattern of methylation protection afforded by the Arg2----Lys mutant protein suggest that Arg2 contacts the N7 groups of guanines 10 and 12 in the operator. In conjunction with previous results, these findings suggest that part of the N-terminal region of Mnt binds as an extended polypeptide strand within the major groove of the mnt operator.
