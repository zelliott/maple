Methylamine oxidase (MAOx) from Gram-positive soil bacterium Arthrobacter P1 catalyzes the oxidation of CH3NH2 to H2C = O and NH4+ via reduction of O2 to H2O2. Past work indicates that MAOx is similar to mammalian plasma amine oxidase (PAO) and diamine oxidase (DAO), plant DAO, and yeast peroxisomal amine oxidase (YAO). All have Mr congruent to 170,000 and are composed of 2 identical subunits, each of which contains 1 atom of Cu(II) and one molecule of quinonoid cofactor. Herein, we report further evidence as to the striking similarity of these enzymes, and describe properties of MAOx which offer insights into understanding the eukaryotic oxidases. It is our belief that the structure of the quinone cofactor, and the Cu(II) site in MAOx are identical to these sites in PAO and DAO.
