The YBR235w gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was found during sequencing of chromosome II. Here, we show that the 1120 aa protein (Ybr235p) encoded by this gene shares strong sequence similarity with the highly related electroneutral Na(+)-C1- and Na(+)-K(+)-C1- cotransporters of animal cells. We hypothesize that this yeast protein also mediates active uptake of C1- into the cell.
