Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) is the major thyroid hormone transport protein. Several inherited TBG variants resulting in partial or complete TBG deficiencies have been shown to be caused by either one or two nucleotide substitutions, or one nucleotide deletion in the coding regions of the TBG gene. In this report, a Japanese female patient (proband) with hyperthyroid state, whose lower TBG levels did not return to normal under the euthyroid state after treatment was examined. Genomic DNA samples from the proband with thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency (termed TBG-Kumamoto) and her family were subjected to the polymerase chain reaction, and the generated DNA fragments were sequenced. A single nucleotide substitution in the codon for the amino acid 363 of native TBG molecule (CCT to CTT) was found, resulting in the replacement of proline by leucine. It was revealed that the proband was a heterozygote and her father was a hemizygote. The mutation was confirmed by the allele-specific amplification of genomic DNAs from the proband and her father using oligonucleotide primers of normal or mutant residues at the 3' position in the polymerase chain reaction. These results indicate that the abnormality of TBG-Kumamoto is the consequence of this mutation. Genetically, this point mutation observed in TBG-Kumamoto might be classified as a new type of TBG deficiency.
