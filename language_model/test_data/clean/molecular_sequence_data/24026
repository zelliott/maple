This work compares frozen water, 70% alcohol, Koenike's and Angelier's fluid as preservation media for water mites in terms of their eventual facilitation of DNA extraction and amplification. The time the mites spent in the fixatives ranged between 1 week and 25 years. Two molecular markers were amplified: 16S ribosomal DNA and CoI mitochondrial DNA. DNA was extractable and could be sequenced from specimens fixed in all the above media, although this generally became more difficult as time progressed. In the light of the known characteristics of these media, the results suggest Angelier's fluid to be the most practical, especially on long expeditions.
