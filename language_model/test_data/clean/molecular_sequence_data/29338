The blue light receptors termed cryptochromes mediate photomorphological responses in seed plants. However, the mechanisms by which cryptochrome signals regulate plant development remain obscure. In this study, cryptochrome functions were analyzed using the moss Physcomitrella patens. This moss has recently become known as the only plant species in which gene replacement occurs at a high frequency by homologous recombination. Two cryptochrome genes were identified in Physcomitrella, and single and double disruptants of these genes were generated. Using these disruptants, it was revealed that cryptochrome signals regulate many steps in moss development, including induction of side branching on protonema and gametophore induction and development. In addition, the disruption of cryptochromes altered auxin responses, including the expression of auxin-inducible genes. Cryptochrome disruptants were more sensitive to external auxin than wild type in a blue light-specific manner, suggesting that cryptochrome light signals repress auxin signals to control plant development.
