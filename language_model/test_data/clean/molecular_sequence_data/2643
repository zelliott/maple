Two heparin binding growth factors with different molecular weight, 16.6 kD and 18.6 kD polypeptide, were purified from bovine omentum. The two factors have almost the same affinity to heparin; they were eluted with 1.0 M NaCl from the affinity column. The 16.6 kD polypeptide was found to be acidic fibroblast growth factor by amino acid sequence analysis. The 18.6 kD polypeptide was an N-terminus blocked polypeptide and was suggested to be beta-endothelial cell growth factor. These molecular species may play significant roles in maintaining vascularized structure in omentum and be related to the angiogenic activity of the tissue.
