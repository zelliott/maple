The putative O-specific polymer containing D-mannose and L-rhamnose was isolated from the lipopolysaccharide obtained from cells walls of Burkholderia vietnamiensis strain LMG 6998. NMR and degradative studies showed that the polymer has a linear trisaccharide repeating-unit of the structure shown. The same polymer carrying an O-acetyl group at position 3 of the 4-substituted mannose residue has previously been found as the O antigen in the related species Burkholderia cepacia serogroup J.
