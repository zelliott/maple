Taking advantage of the polymorphism created by the presence or the absence of a LINE-1 repeat in intron 12 of the mouse serum albumin-encoding gene, we sequenced the repeat (Alb-L1Md), as well as the flanking regions in BALB/c DNA. The empty insertion site in a wild-type mouse of the same species Mus domesticus was amplified using PCR and sequenced. The Alb-L1Md was truncated at its 5' end and bordered by two 14-bp repeats, which represented the duplication of the empty insertion site. The absence of mutations in the two direct repeats as well as in the poly(dA) tail suggests that the Alb-L1Md sequence had been inserted very recently. On the basis of the insertion sequence of intron 12 and of the sequence of the consensus L1Md repeat, 5' of the insertion, we discuss a model of integration of full-length L1Md-RNA leading to the truncation of the inserted repeat.
