The myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) undergoes a rapid and, in certain circumstances, transient increase in phosphorylation in response to stimuli that activate protein kinase C. We have investigated the protein-serine/threonine phosphatase activity responsible for reversing the phosphorylation of MARCKS. In cell-free assays, protein phosphatases 1, 2A and 2C (PP1, PP2A and PP2C) all dephosphorylate recombinant MARCKS or a synthetic peptide based on its phosphorylation site domain. In intact Swiss 3T3 cells, okadaic acid, a specific inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A, had little effect on MARCKS phosphorylation on its own, but largely prevented the dephosphorylation of MARCKS that occurred following activation of protein kinase C by bombesin with subsequent receptor blockade. These results indicate that although the dephosphorylation of MARCKS can be mediated by PP2C in vitro, this protein is dephosphorylated by okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatases in the intact cell.
