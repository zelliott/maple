We have analyzed differential gene expression in normal versus jun-transformed avian fibroblasts by using subtracted nucleic acid probes and differential nucleic acid hybridization techniques for the isolation of cDNA clones. One clone corresponded to a gene that was strongly expressed in a previously established quail (Coturnix japonica) embryo fibroblast line (VCD) transformed by a chimeric jun oncogene but whose expression was undetectable in normal quail embryo fibroblasts. Furthermore, the gene was expressed in quail or chicken fibroblast cultures that were freshly transformed by retroviral constructs carrying various viral or cellular jun alleles and in chicken fibroblasts transformed by the avian retrovirus ASV17 carrying the original viral v-jun allele. However, its expression was undetectable in a variety of established avian cell lines or freshly prepared avian fibroblast cultures transformed by other oncogenes or a chemical carcinogen. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the cDNA clone were not identical to any sequence entries in the data bases but revealed significant similarities to avian beta-keratin genes; the highest degree of amino acid sequence identity was 63%. The gene, which we termed bkj, may represent a direct or indirect target for jun function.
