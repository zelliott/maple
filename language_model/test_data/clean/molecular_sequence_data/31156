We have studied the effect of some regular sequences namely (dA-dT)n, (dA)n and (dG-dC)n on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PHO5 gene expression. These sequences were inserted into the ClaI site, located between two phosphate-responsible upstream activating sequences (UAS's). A modified PHO5 gene cloned in vector plasmids was used to transform the pho3, pho5 yeast strain and the level of acid phosphatase expression in various conditions was measured. We show that the insertion of (dA-dT)n blocks, but not (dA)n or (dG-dC)n, leads to the dramatic decrease of PHO5 gene expression in a derepressed state. (dA-dT)n inserts also inhibit the expression of PHO5 gene which was put under the control of heterologous UASgal.
