Four abundant cDNA clones have been isolated from a rat epididymal cDNA library. Northern blot analysis has shown that these clones partially encode 4.5 kb, 2.8 kb, 1.2 kb and 0.85 kb mRNAs and that their expression is not detectable in total RNA preparations from heart, kidney, liver or testis. Fourteen days after castration the levels of the 2.8 kb, 1.2 kb and 0.85 kb transcripts were greatly reduced whereas the 4.5 kb mRNA was undetectable. Subsequent treatment of castrated rats with testosterone for 1 day resulted in a complete restoration of the pre-castration steady-state levels of the 2.8 kb and 0.85 kb mRNAs, restoration of the 4.5 kb mRNA to 70% of pre-castration levels, and a slight over-induction of the 1.2 kb mRNA. Analyses of separate regions of the epididymal tract showed that expression of the 2.8 kb and 1.2 kb mRNAs increased towards the distal end of the epididymis, while the 4.5 kb and 0.85 kb transcripts were primarily synthesised in the caput region.
