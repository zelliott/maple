We present the case of a patient with catheter-related infection caused by Delftia tsuruhatensis, a newly described species closely related to Delftia acidovorans (formerly Comamonas acidovorans). To date, D. tsuruhatensis has not been described as a pathogen. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing D. tsuruhatensis as the causative agent of a human infection.
