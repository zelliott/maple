A liposome formulation containing a distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine analog was developed that was endocytosed by both lymphocytes and monocytes. This formulation was used to encapsulate sense and antisense 20-mer oligodeoxynucleotides to the 5' tat splice acceptor site of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. At a DNA concentration of 140 nM, the liposome-encapsulated sense DNA inhibited p24 production by as much as 84% in human peripheral blood leukocytes infected with "wild-type" virus. This treatment also reduced the number of peripheral blood leukocytes producing intracellular viral antigen by 71%. Of interest, no reduction in either parameter was observed for the antisense-containing liposomes. The results demonstrate the promise of a new liposomal delivery vehicle to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus replication by an entrapped oligodeoxynucleotide.
