A number of cDNAs corresponding to auxin-regulated mRNAs have been isolated from tobacco and found to be encoded by a multigene family consisting of three subfamilies. Homologous proteins have been isolated independently from soybean and potato. Here we report that the encoded proteins show a limited but significant homology to both plant and animal glutathione S-transferases (GST, EC 2.5.1.18). For the protein NT103, encoded by a member of the Nt103 subfamily, we demonstrate an in vitro GST activity. This is the first time a function is attributed to a member of this group of auxin-induced proteins or any of its homologues. The implications of this finding and the possible relationships between auxins and GSTs are discussed.
