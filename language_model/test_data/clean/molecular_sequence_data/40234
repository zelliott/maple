Three Pasteurella dagmatis-like strains recovered from the feline oral cavity were analysed by traditional biochemical tests, the Biolog Microstationâ„¢ ID System, and 16S rRNA and sodA gene sequence analysis. The molecular biological methods revealed that these strains differ from P. dagmatis, forming a new genomospecies in the genus Pasteurella sensu stricto. Furthermore, sequence analysis and multiple alignments of 16S rRNA and the sodA gene established that the P. pneumotropica NCTC10827 and the P. dagmatis-like strains described here possess high genetic similarity.
