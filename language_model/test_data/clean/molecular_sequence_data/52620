Mass spectrometry has in the last decade been accepted as a key analytical technique in protein chemistry. It is now the preferred technique for identification of proteins separated by one- or two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, i.e. in proteome analysis. It is the dominating technique for determination of posttranslational modifications in proteins. The two ionization techniques presently widely used in protein studies are matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) in combination with time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzers and electrospray ionization (ESI) in combination with a variety of mass analyzers. In this chapter the principles and performance of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry will be described as well as the application of this technique to a variety of applications.
