Hypertrehalosaemic peptides were isolated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography from corpora cardiaca of four species of cockroaches (Leucophaea maderae, Gromphadorhina portentosa, Blattella germanica, and Blatta orientalis) and one stick insect species (Extatosoma tiaratum), and their primary sequences were assigned by collision-induced decomposition tandem fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS/CID/MS). The members of the cockroach families Blaberidae (L. maderae and G. portentosa) and Blattellidae (B. germanica) contained an identical decapeptide (Glu-Val-Asn-Phe-Ser-Pro-Gly-Trp-Gly-ThrNH2), whereas the member of the cockroach family Blattidae (B. orientalis) had two octapeptides (Glu-Val-Asn-Phe-Ser-Pro-Asn-TrpNH2 and Glu-Leu-Thr-Phe-Thr-Pro-Asn-TrpNH2). The structure of the stick insect hypertrehalosaemic compound was assigned as a decapeptide (Glu-Leu-Thr-Phe-Thr-Pro-Asn-Trp-Gly-ThrNH2). The respective synthetic peptides elevated blood carbohydrates in their respective acceptor species. The results are discussed in the light of family-specificity of members of the adipokinetic hormone/red pigment-concentrating hormone family.
