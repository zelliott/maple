Gene egl2 of secreted endo-(1-4)-beta-glucanase of glycosyl hydrolase family 5 of the mycelial fungus Penicillium canescens was cloned. The gene was expressed in P. canescens under control of a strong promoter of the bgaS gene encoding beta-galactosidase of P. canescens, and endoglucanase producing strains were obtained. Chromatographically purified recombinant 48 kDa protein had pH and temperature optima 3.4 and 60 degrees C, respectively, exhibited specific activity of 33 IU, and had K(m) and V(max) in CM-cellulose hydrolysis of 10.28 g/liter and 0.26 micromol/sec per mg, respectively.
