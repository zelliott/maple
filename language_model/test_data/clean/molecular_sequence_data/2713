A region spanning 25 kb of genomic DNA containing the kappa-casein gene, has been isolated from two genomic libraries in EMBL3 and EMBL4 phage vectors. Five phage clones containing kappa-casein gene have been found. Gene organisation has been determined using restriction mapping and a partial sequencing the 5' and 3' flanking regions. The kappa-casein gene includes 5 exons, the first of them coding for 64 nucleotides from the 5' untranslated mRNA zone. The gene is 12.5 kb long, which is almost 16 times longer than the corresponding mRNA. The first intron spans 2.5 kb, the second is the largest one and spans 5.5 kb. The 5' flanking region sequence has been analysed; it contains a TATA box from -30 to -25 bp, somewhat different from the canonic sequence, and a CAAT box at -80 bp.
