N-RAP is a nebulin-related actin-binding protein found at the myotendon junction in skeletal muscle and at the intercalated disks in cardiac muscle. We mapped the NRAP gene to mouse chromosome 19 using interspecific crosses and to human chromosome 10 using radiation hybrid panels. Comparative analysis of the mouse and human genomes indicates that the NRAP gene is located in regions of conserved synteny between the two species.
