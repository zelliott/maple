Pseudomonas aeruginosa AH16 is a virulent strain isolated from a patient with chronic pneumonia in China. Here, we present a 6.8-Mb (G+C content, 66.13%) assembly of its genome with 6,332 putative coding sequences, which may provide insights into the genomic basis of activity of the clinical P. aeruginosa strain in China.
