A disturbed energy transfer involving the adenine nucleotide translocator across the inner mitochondrial membrane has been suggested to be one specific pathogenetic mechanism in dilated cardiomyopathy. Pretranslational steady state expression of this protein in dilated cardiomyopathy was investigated.

Concentrations of adenine nucleotide translocator were quantified by solution hybridisation. The enzyme or protein expressions of citrate synthase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase with isozymes were determined. Analysis was performed on specimens from the left and right ventricles from six organ donor hearts, six explanted hearts with dilated cardiomyopathy, two explanted hearts with ischaemic cardiomyopathy, and from papillary muscles from seven patients operated on for mitral regurgitation.

The ejection fraction in patients with mitral regurgitation was 50(10)%, significantly higher (p < 0.001) than in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (23(5))%. In mitral regurgitation and in ischaemic cardiomyopathy left ventricular adenine nucleotide translocator mRNA concentrations did not differ from those in donor hearts. In dilated cardiomyopathy, adenine nucleotide translocator mRNA concentrations were significantly increased (p < 0.001). Upregulation was more pronounced in right ventricular than in left ventricular myocardium (p < 0.01). The lactate dehydrogenase M subunit fraction was increased to a similar degree in dilated cardiomyopathy and in mitral regurgitation (p < 0.05). Citrate synthase activity was significantly decreased only in dilated cardiomyopathy (p < 0.005). On the other hand, the creatine kinase B subunit content was significantly higher in mitral regurgitation than in dilated cardiomyopathy (p < 0.001).

Despite signs of increased anaerobic and depressed oxidative capacities, dilated cardiomyopathy was specifically characterised by pretranslational upregulation of adenine nucleotide translocator.
