The effects of a c-myc antisense phosphorothioate DNA oligonucleotide were assessed on the proliferation rate of human arterial smooth muscle cells (HSMCs). Compared to a control oligonucleotide the antisense oligonucleotide suppressed the proliferation of HSMCs in a concentration-dependent manner without a major cytotoxic effect. Outgrowth of HSMCs from media explants was significantly inhibited as well. Induction of c-myc expression by serum stimulation of cells was blunted by the antisense oligonucleotide, as shown by immunoblotting. These results demonstrate that c-myc expression is an essential factor for proliferation of HSMCs after growth stimulation, and they show the potential of antisense technology for modulating gene expression of HSMCs in vitro.
