An experimental phylogeny was constructed using bacteriophage T7 and a propagation protocol, in the presence of the mutagen N-methyl-N'-nitro-N'-nitrosoguanidine, based on Hillis et al. [Hillis, D.M., Bull, J.J., White, M.E., Badgett, M.R., Molineux, I.J., 1992. Experimental phylogenetics, generation of a known phylogeny. Science 255, 589-592]. The topology presented in this study has a considerable variation in branch lengths and is less symmetric than the one presented by Hillis et al. [Hillis, D.M., Bull, J.J., White, M.E., Badgett, M.R., Molineux, I.J., 1992. Experimental phylogenetics, generation of a known phylogeny. Science 255, 589-592]. These features are known to present additional difficulties to phylogenetic inference methods. The performance of several phylogenetic methods (conventional and less conventional) was tested using restriction site and nucleotide data. Only methods that encompassed a molecular clock or those based on sequence signatures recovered the true phylogeny. Nevertheless a likelihood ratio test rejected the hypothesis of the existence of a molecular clock when the whole sequence data set was considered. This fact or the particular substitution pattern (mainly G-->A and C-->T) may be related to the unexpected performance of distance methods based on sequence signatures. To test if the results could have been predicted by simulation studies we estimated the evolution parameters from the real phylogeny and used them to simulate evolution along the same tree (parametric bootstrap). We found that simulation could predict most but not all of the problems encountered by phylogenetic inference methods in the real phylogeny. Short interior branches may be more prone to error than predicted by theoretical studies.
