The HMG box encodes a conserved DNA binding domain found in many proteins and is involved in the regulation of transcription and chromatin conformation. We describe HMG20A and HMG20B, two novel human HMG box-containing genes, discovered within the EURO-IMAGE Consortium full-length cDNA sequencing initiative. The predicted proteins encoded by these two genes are 48.4% identical (73.9% within the HMG domain). The HMG domain of both HMG20 proteins is most similar to that of yeast NHP6A (38% to 42%). Outside of this domain, HMG20 proteins lack any significant homology to other known proteins. We determined the genomic structure and expression pattern of HMG20A and HMG20B. Both genes have several alternative transcripts, expressed almost ubiquitously. HMG20A maps to chromosome 15q24 (near D15S1227) and HMG20B to 19p13.3 (between D19S209 and D19S216). The HMG20 genes define a distinct class of mammalian HMG box genes.
