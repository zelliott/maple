The one-step single-tube betaine-free reverse transcription (RT)-loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay was developed for rapid diagnosis of hepatitis E virus. This assay amplified the target gene in less than 45 min (even as short as 20 min) under isothermal conditions at 63 degrees C, and the sensitivity of this assay was 100-fold greater than that of RT-PCR. This assay demonstrated a detection limit of 0.045 fg (nine copies/reaction).
