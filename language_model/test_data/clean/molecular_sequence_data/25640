The N-terminal domains of the alpha and beta polypeptides of the B870 antenna complex of Rhodobacter capsulatus are oppositely charged. In both polypeptides two charged amino acids are located close to the N-terminus, and two of them are close to the hydrophobic central domain. To test the hypothesis that charged amino acids in the N-terminus have a function for insertion and assembly of pigment-binding polypeptides, charged amino acids were replaced by amino acids of opposite charge. The results show that an exchange of amino acid positions 3 and 6 in alpha (Lys----Glu) or 2 and 5 in beta (Asp----Lys, Arg) has little effect under semiaerobic conditions on the formation of B870 but the additional exchange of positions 14 and 15 in alpha (Arg----Glu, Asp) and/or 13 and 14 in beta (Asp, Glu----Arg) inhibits strongly under semiaerobic dark and anaerobic light conditions the stable incorporation of the polypeptides into the membrane and the formation of the B870 complex. The mutant U43(pTXAB5) is able to grow without any antenna.
