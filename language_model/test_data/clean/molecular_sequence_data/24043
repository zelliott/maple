Pulmonary tissues of red-grey voles, Clethrionomys rufocanus from Shkotovo District and Maritime Territory were investigated. rt-PCR was used to detect the hantavirus nt-222 M-segment genome and nt-403 mitochondrial DNA fragment. A new genetic variant of the PUUV virus named as "Shkotovo", that is different from other PUUV strains by 18-23%, was shown to be circulating in red-grey voles. A phylogenetic analysis denoted 2 PUUV subgroups with their rodent-host branching into C. graleolus and C. rufocanus.
