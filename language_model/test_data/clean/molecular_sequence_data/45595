Bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide in dairy and beef cattle. To date, little is know about BVDV genotypes circulating in Portugal. For this purpose, a fragment within the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) from 34 Portuguese field strains of BVDV was amplified by RT-PCR, cloned and sequenced. A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of viruses, originated from cattle from different regions of the country, belong to BVDV type 1 (BVDV-1), genotypes 1b (n = 19), 1a (n = 6), 1d (n = 3) and 1e (n = 3); whereas three viruses clustered in BVDV type 2 (BVDV-2). The results from this study demonstrate that BVDV-lb is the most prevalent genotype and also shows the presence of BVDV-2 in Portugal.
