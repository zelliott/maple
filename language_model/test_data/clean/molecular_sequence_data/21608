A novel bacterial strain capable of degrading the pyrethroid pesticide fenpropathrin was isolated from mixed wastewater and sludge samples. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence revealed that the organism belongs to the genus Clostridium. The organism can co-metabolically transform fenpropathrin at 100 mg l(-1) at 35°C and pH 7.5 in 12 days. Metabolic products of fenpropathrin from strain ZP3 were examined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and the results showed that the organism degraded fenpropathrin with an oxidization process to yield benzyl alcohol, benzenemethanol, 3,5-dimethylamphetamine. Analyses of cell-free extracts from this strain showed that the optimal degrading conditions for degrading fenpropathrin were 35°C and pH 7.5, and degradation efficiency was 20.0 mg l(-1) day(-1), and it might be potential using for rapid treating fenpropathrin, for example, on the surface of fruits and vegetables.
