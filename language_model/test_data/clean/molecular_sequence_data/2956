The yeast chromosomal genes SKI2, SKI3, SKI4, SKI6, SKI7 and SKI8 repress the replication of double-stranded RNA viruses, protecting the host from the otherwise lethal effects of the virus. We cloned and sequenced the SKI3 gene and found that it encodes a 163 kDa protein including a typical nuclear localization signal. Cell fractionation experiments show that the SKI3 gene product is indeed tightly associated with nuclei and that the putative nuclear localization sequence directs beta-galactosidase into the nucleus. However, fusion of a part of the SKI3 protein lacking this signal with beta-galactosidase also directs beta-galactosidase into the nucleus, suggesting the presence of a second nuclear localization signal. The SKI3 gene is only essential in the presence of an M double-stranded RNA virus.
