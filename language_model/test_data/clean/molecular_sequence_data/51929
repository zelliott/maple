The promoter sequence of the growth hormone (GH) gene binds the ubiquitous factors nuclear factor 1, activator protein-2, upstream stimulatory factor and Sp1. A pituitary-specific factor known as growth hormone factor 1 or Pit-1 also binds to the promoter sequence. This factor is responsible for somatotroph-specific expression of GH. It is also involved in the effect of GH-releasing hormone and in the ontogeny of the anterior pituitary.
