The molecular basis of the substrate specificity of Clostridium histolyticum beta-collagenase was investigated using a combinatorial method. An immobilized positional peptide library, which contains 24,000 sequences, was constructed with a 7-hydroxycoumarin-4-propanoyl (Cop) fluorescent group attached at the N terminus of each sequence. This immobilized peptide library was incubated with C. histolyticum beta-collagenase, releasing fluorogenic fragments in the solution phase. The relative substrate specificity (k(cat)/K(m)) for each member of the library was determined by measuring fluorescence intensity in the solution phase. Edman sequencing was used to assign structure to subsites of active substrate mixtures. Collectively, the substrate preference for subsites (P(3)-P(4)') of C. histolyticum beta-collagenase was determined. The last position on the C-terminal side in which the identity of the amino acids affects the activity of the enzyme is P(4)', and an aromatic side chain is preferred in this position. The optimal P(1)'-P(3)' extended substrate sequence is P(1)'-Gly/Ala, P(2)'-Pro/Xaa, and P(3)'-Lys/Arg/Pro/Thr/Ser. The Cop group in either the P(2) or P(3) position is required for a high substrate activity with C. histolyticum beta-collagenase. S(2) and S(3) sites of the protease play a dominant role in fixing the substrate specificity. The immobilized peptide library proved to be a powerful approach for assessing the substrate specificity of C. histolyticum beta-collagenase, so it may be applied to the study of other proteases of interest.
