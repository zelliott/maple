Id genes encode helix-loop-helix proteins that function to mediate processes important for normal development including cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Id proteins act as negative regulators of other transcription factors, which are essential for cell determination and differentiation in diverse cell types, and interact with proteins important for cell cycle regulation. Studies of Id gene expression in the nervous system and in neural cells in culture indicate that Id proteins contribute to the regulation of mammalian nervous system development. Also, recognition of a wide variety of proteins with which Id transcription factors are capable of interacting suggests that it will be possible to understand more precisely their specific functions and importantly how these are integrated.
