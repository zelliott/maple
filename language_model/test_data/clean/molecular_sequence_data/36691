We have developed an expeditious method for the incorporation of the biotinylaminocaproyl moiety on the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue within a peptide chain in a site-specific manner. Using t-Boc chemistry for the solid phase synthesis approach and a base labile, acid stable protecting group (Fmoc-) for the epsilon-amino group of the target lysine, we prepared fully protected resin bound peptides which are site-specifically biotinylated. Following HF cleavage, the uniquely biotinylated peptides were obtained in a high degree of purity. Using this approach, a number of biotinylaminocaproyllysyl derivatives of a monocyclic Endothelin-1 analog were prepared. Synthesis of selected bicyclic analogs of high affinity monocycles led to the preparation of the bicyclic [Nle7]ET-1 analog containing epsilon-biotinylaminocaproyllysine at position-9. This peptide, with Kd = 0.08 nM, has 1000-fold higher affinity for the ETA receptor than the commercially available N alpha-biotinylated Endothelin-1. The general utility of this biotinylation methodology was demonstrated by the synthesis of a site-specifically biotinylated PTH analog which contained several side chain functionalized amino acid residues in its sequence. The synthetic method reported here is convergent in that it allows the facile variation of the length of the spacer and also offers the potential to introduce in a site specific manner other groups such as affinity labels and fluorescent tags.
