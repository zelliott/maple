During 2003, 40 carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates collected in a Mexican tertiary-care hospital were screened for metallo-beta-lactamase production. Thirteen isolates produced IMP-15, and 12 had a single pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern. The bla(IMP-15) gene cassette was inserted in a plasmid-borne integron with a unique array of gene cassettes and was named In95.
