Frogs of the genus Tomopterna occur throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Previous work has shown that there are seven cryptic species, which occupy diverse habitats from grasslands to deserts. The current paper proposes a phylogeny of Tomopterna based on partial sequences of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene. A gene tree for the genus, including all seven named species and three undescribed species which were discovered during the course of this study, is presented.
