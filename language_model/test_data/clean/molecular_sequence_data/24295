The purpose of the present study was to assess the viral diversity of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in six nonresponder patients during three unsuccessful treatments. These patients were treated successively with IFN-alpha2a (IFN-alpha) at a posology of 3.10(6) units (MIU) three times a week, 10 MIU three times a week, and a combination of IFN-alpha (3 MIU) plus ribavirin (1,000 mg/day). However, only two chronically infected patients could be included in the study due to the persistence of HCV RNA during the three successive treatments. The viral diversity was analysed by cloning and sequencing the HVR-1 region. The treatment of the two nonresponder patients was associated with the persistence of a wide diversity in the viral population and with the emergence of new or minor variants. Under the influence of standard doses of IFN-alpha, a rearrangement of the quasispecies present was observed at this time point. No significant change in viral load or in the complexity of the quasispecies was observed. A second treatment with a high dose of IFN-alpha induced a significant decrease in the associated viral load and, in one case, resulted in a radical change of the viral diversity. Administration of a combination of IFN-alpha and ribavirin did not affect the evolution of the variants but was followed by the emergence of various multiple variants. These results reinforce the hypothesis of the presence of preexisting quasispecies best adapted to the host environment, and therefore resistant to any current therapy.
