Misregulated cell death, which can result in either the excessive, inappropriate elimination of cells, or in the insufficient removal of damaged or malignant cells, has been associated with numerous diseases. Here we discuss an important molecular regulator of cell death, DAP-kinase (DAPk), which presents a promising target for therapeutic intervention. A structure-functional analysis of this calcium-regulated Ser/Thr kinase which promotes cell death will be presented, and emphasis will be placed on particular disease models in which its modulation might affect clinically-relevant cell death processes.
