Regulating gene expression directly at the mRNA level represents a novel approach to control cellular processes in all organisms. In this respect, an RNA-binding protein plays a key role by targeting the mRNA to regulate the expression by attenuation or an anti-termination mechanism only in the presence of their cognate ligands. Although many proteins are known to use these mechanisms to regulate the gene expression, no structural insights have been revealed to date to explain how these proteins trigger the conformation for the recognition of RNA. This review describes the activated conformation of HutP, brought by the coordination of L-histidine and Mg(2+) ions, based on our recently solved crystal structures [uncomplexed HutP, HutP-Mg(2+), HutP-L-histidine, HutP-Mg(2+)-L-histidine, HutP-Mg(2+)-L-histidine-RNA]. Once the HutP is activated, the protein binds specifically to bases within the terminator region, without undergoing further structural rearrangement. Also, a high resolution (1.48 A) crystal structure of the quaternary complex containing the three GAG motifs is presented. This analysis clearly demonstrates that the first base in the UAG motifs is not important for the function and is consistent with our previous observations.
