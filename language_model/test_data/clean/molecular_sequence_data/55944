Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) is the key enzyme responsible for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and is reduced in various central neurodegenerative diseases. From a previously selected 12.6 kb human choline acetyltransferase (hChAT) genomic clone, we have identified and characterized a promoter region of 895 bp. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a TATA-like box, a CAAT box and several putative regulatory responsive elements. Three transcription initiation sites were determined by primer extension analysis. The Northern blot of poly(A)+ RNA, showed a single band of 2300 Nt in the human nucleus accumbens and facial nucleus. By using transient transfections into NE-1-115 and COS-1 cells of the 5' flanking region of the hChAT gene we identified a sequence of 66 bp upstream of the transcription start site which confers responsiveness to proto-oncogenes c-Fos/c-Jun. These data suggest that the hChAT gene may be a physiological target of c-Fos/c-Jun and therefore may play a role in neuronal responses to various stimuli.
