A multiplex PCR test based on the simultaneous amplification of two lipoprotein genes, oprI and oprL, was designed and evaluated for its ability to directly detect fluorescent pseudomonads (amplification of oprI open reading frame, 249 bp) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (amplification of oprL open reading frame, 504 bp) in clinical material. A collection of reference strains including 20 different species of fluorescent pseudomonads was tested. Positive PCR results for both genes were observed only for P. aeruginosa isolates (n = 150), including strains of clinical and environmental origin, while only one gene, oprI, was amplified from the other fluorescent pseudomonads. All other bacteria tested (n = 15) were negative by the amplification test. The lower detection level for P. aeruginosa was estimated to be 10(2) cells/ml. Preliminary evaluation on testing skin biopsy specimens from patients with burns (n = 14) and sputum samples from cystic fibrosis patients (n = 49) and other patients (n = 19) showed 100% sensitivity and 74% specificity in comparison with culture. This multiplex PCR assay appears promising for the rapid and sensitive detection of P. aeruginosa in clinical specimens. Further evaluation of its specificity in longitudinal clinical studies is warranted.
