1. Repeated oral administrations of tryptic hydrolysate of bovine milk casein (CEI) showed antihypertensive effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats. 2. Single oral administration of CEI antagonized the pressor response to angiotensin I. 3. Bovine milk casein hydrolysate inhibited the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. Three peptides with ACE-inhibiting activity were isolated from CEI. 4. It is suggested that ACE-inhibiting peptides in the tryptic hydrolysate milk casein are absorbed from the intestinal tract and produce an antihypertensive effect.
