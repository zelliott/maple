Opioid-binding cell adhesion molecule (OBCAM), neurotrimin (NTM) and limbic system-associated membrane protein (LAMP) are homologous and are the members of the IgLON family which is a subfamily within the immunoglobulin superfamily. We cloned the cDNAs for OBCAM and NTM, prepared recombinant proteins, and examined the reactivity of the previously prepared monocolonal anti-OBCAM antibody, OBC53, with the recombinant proteins by immunoblotting. These experiments revealed that OBC53 recognizes OBCAM about 1000 times as efficiently as NTM. Moreover, the NTM and LAMP peptides which have sequences homologous to the OBCAM peptide used for the preparation of OBC53 were 150 times less reactive to OBC53. Thus, the OBC53 antibody is a useful tool for specifically detecting OBCAM in immunochemical experiments.
