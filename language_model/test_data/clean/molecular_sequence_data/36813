The action of 5-trifluoromethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (CF3dUrd) on DNA synthesis was investigated in vitro assay systems with purified DNA polymerases. CF3dUrd was incorporated into the DNA of mammalian cells in culture. We studied the incorporation of CF3dUrd 5'-triphosphate (CF3dUTP) into DNA and effect of CF3dUrd residue on DNA synthesis. Therefore, we synthesized oligonucleotides that allow site specific introduction of a CF3dUrd residue into a synthetic DNA oligonucleotide. After CF3dUTP incorporation, the primer was extended for human DNA polymerase alpha (pol. alpha). When CF3dUrd residue was located at an internucleotide site in the template, however, pol. alpha was exhibited a strong arrest band one nucleotide after the CF3dUrd residue site, and Escherichia coli polymerase I (Klenow fragment) also exhibited a weaker arrest band one nucleotide before the CF3dUrd residue. These results suggested that a mechanism of antitumor activity of CF3dUrd is inhibition of DNA replication.
