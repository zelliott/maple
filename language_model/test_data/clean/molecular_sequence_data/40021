Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 is a poorly characterized actinomycete, producer of the glycopeptide antibiotic A40926. In this study, the nucleotide sequence of the atp operon coding for F1F0-ATP synthase of Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 was determined. It consisted of ten open reading frames arranged in the order atpI (encoding the i protein), orfX, atpB (a subunit), atpE (c subunit), atpF (b subunit), atpH (delta subunit), atpA (alpha subunit), atpG (gamma subunit), atpD (beta subunit) and atpC (epsilon subunit). The orfX coded for a putative small hydrophobic 71 amino acid peptide of unknown function related to several bacterial permeases. Its presence appeared to be a distinctive feature of the atp operon of phylogenetically distant actinobacteria. Transcription of the atp operon was evaluated. The results of northern blot and RT-PCR experiments demonstrated that the atp genes were co-transcribed into a single polycistronic mRNA. Real-time RT-PCR data provided evidence showing that transcription of the atp operon was biphasic during Nonomuraea growth. The amount of the atpD transcript decreased at the end of the exponential growth phase, and then moderately increased during the early stationary phase when, in contrast, the levels of ctaC, encoding the cytochrome c oxidase subunit II, progressively decreased. Western blot analysis confirmed that ATP synthase was also present in the membrane during the stationary phase. These results together with previous data demonstrate that oligomycin-sensitive ATP-driven proton pumping activity remained constant in the stationary phase; in contrast, the activity and cytochrome content of the respiratory enzymes became negligible.
