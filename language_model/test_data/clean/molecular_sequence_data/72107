90K is a secreted protein thought to be involved in the body's defense against pathogens and cancer. To elucidate its transcriptional regulation, the promoter of human 90K (HGMW-approved symbol LGAL S3BP) was isolated and characterized. Analysis of the 3. 3-kb 5'-flanking region revealed that it is a TATA-less promoter, but neither GC-rich nor dependent on SP1 sites. RNase protection assays detected one major transcription start site (+1) and several minor transcription start sites upstream and downstream. Deletion studies defined a minimal promoter (-103 --> -49) and indirectly suggested positive synergism between different elements within it. Consistent with the proposed function of 90K, its promoter activity could be stimulated by poly(I). poly(C), mimicking viral infection. Two regions mediating induction by poly(I). poly(C) (-171 --> -112, -32 --> 46) were identified by deletion mutants. A small region around the minimal promoter (-99 --> -12) was highly homologous between human and mouse. While both human and mouse minimal promoters contained an interferon-responsive element (IRF-E), the human minimal promoter was not inducible by poly(I). poly(C) in contrast to that of the mouse. Point mutations 30 bp upstream of the IRF-E, however, conferred inducibility to the human minimal promoter, suggesting interaction between different promoter elements.
