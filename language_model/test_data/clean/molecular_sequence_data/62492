The Holoarctic termite genus Reticulitermes is widely distributed in Europe. A new Reticulitermes species, R. sp. nov, was recently found in France and Italy. Its phylogenetic position was investigated using a 743-bp fragment of mitochondrial 16S rRNA-ND1 genes and 382-bp of the nuclear ITS2 region. Phylogenies for these sequences were estimated by neighbor-joining, maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood analysis. The results strongly supported a relationship between R. sp. nov. and the termite species from the eastern Mediterranean area including Reticulitermes balkanensis from the Balkans, Reticulitermes lucifugus from Turkey and Reticulitermes clypeatus from Israel. The hypothesis of a relationship between R. sp. nov. and the Japanese Reticulitermes speratus was rejected by parametric bootstrap. The current distribution of R. sp. nov. could be linked to postglacial colonization routes between Balkan refuge and northern regions.
