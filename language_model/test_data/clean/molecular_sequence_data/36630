In connection with our discovery of a strong immunosuppressive activity of cyclolinopeptide A (CLA), we investigated immunosuppressive properties of antamanide and a number of its analogues, including symmetrical antamanide, and compared them with the activities of cyclosporin A and CLA. The peptides were investigated by using plaque forming cell (PFC), graft-versus-host (GvH), delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH), and autologous rosette formation cell (ARFC) tests. Antamanide and symmetrical antamanide exhibit an immunosuppressive activity lower than CLA. Linear antamanide fragments are also active. At higher concentrations of the latter peptides, toxic effects occur.
