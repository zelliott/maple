RNA transcript-releasing plasmid has been constructed by means of artificial hammerhead ribozymes. In this specific construct of pGENE8459v3 the ribozyme targeted for SFL1 gene (a yeast suppressor gene for flocculation) was fused between two other ribozymes called 5'-processing and 3'-processing ribozymes. Since the "Ribozyme for SFL1" portion (cassette) can be replaced by other RNA sequences, it is now possible to produce any RNAs with defined 5'- and 3'- ends.
