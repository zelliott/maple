We report here the identification and characterization of a novel SR-related protein, referred to as SRrp37, based on its apparent molecular weight and subcellular location. SRrp37 was identified through a yeast two-hybrid screen during the course of searching for proteins interacting with pNO40, a ribosomal 60S core subunit. SRrp37 exhibited two alternative spliced isoforms generated by differential usage of the translation start site with the longer one, SRrp37, initiating at first exon and the shorter, SRrp37-2, starting from exon 2. Three distinct motifs can be discerned in the SRrp37 protein: (1) a serine-arginine (SR) dipeptide enriched domain, (2) a polyserine stretch, and (3) a potential nucleolar localization signal comprising a long array of basic amino acids. SRrp37's message was translated in tissue-specific patterns with both isoforms expressed at comparable levels in tissues showing expression. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis with an anti-SRrp37 antibody, as well as an experiment using myc-tagged proteins, demonstrated that SRrp37 was localized in nucleoli and nuclear speckles. GST pull-down assay showed that SRrp37 interacted physically with SC35. Using adenovirus E1A and chimeric calcitonin/dhfr constructs as splicing reporter minigenes, we found that SRrp37 modulated alternative 5' and 3' splicing in vivo. Together, SRrp37 may participate directly in splicing regulation or indirectly through interaction with SC35. Studies on this novel splicing regulator may provide new information on the intricate splicing machinery as related to the RNA metabolism involving processing of mRNA and rRNA.
