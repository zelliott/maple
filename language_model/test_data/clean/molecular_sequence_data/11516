37 CA repeats, 5 STSs, 9 ESTs, and 4 genes were mapped to 19 different intervals of chromosome 13 determined by the cytogenetic breakpoints of 19 different cell lines with interstitial deletions or translocations involving various parts of chromosome 13. A framework genetic linkage map was constructed from 25 of these microsatellite markers, to which 26 markers from other genetic maps were added. Thus, an integrated map of chromosome 13 resulted. Since the microsatellite markers included in this study derive from different genetic maps, an approximate regional localization can now be assigned in principle to any genetic marker on chromosome 13.
