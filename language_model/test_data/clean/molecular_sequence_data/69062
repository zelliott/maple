We isolated a rice cDNA encoding nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK, EC 2.7.4.6). The deduced amino acid sequence of the rice NDK shows highest homology to spinach NDK-I. The rice NDK gene exhibits a strong codon bias (73.8% GC) in the third position of the codon. DNA blot analysis indicated that at least single NDK gene is present in rice genome.
