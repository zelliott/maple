The cell-surface RAGE [receptor for AGE (advanced glycation end-products)] is associated with the development of diabetic vascular complications, neurodegenerative disorders and inflammation. Recently, we isolated a human RAGE splice variant, which can work as a decoy receptor for RAGE ligands, and named it esRAGE (endogenous secretory RAGE). In the present study, we have isolated the murine equivalent of esRAGE from brain polysomal poly(A)+ (polyadenylated) RNA by RT (reverse transcription)-PCR cloning. The mRNA was generated by alternative splicing, and it encoded a 334-amino-acid protein with a signal sequence, but lacking the transmembrane domain. A transfection experiment revealed that the mRNA was actually translated as deduced to yield the secretory protein working as a decoy in AGE-induced NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) activation. RT-PCR and immunoblotting detected esRAGE mRNA and protein in the brain, lung, kidney and small intestine of wild-type mice, but not of RAGE-null mice. The esRAGE expression was increased in the kidney of diabetic wild-type mice. The present study has thus provided an animal orthologue of esRAGE for clarification of its roles in health and disease.
