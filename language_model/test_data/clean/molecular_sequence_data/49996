The nucleotide sequence of the VP1 coding region of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) strain HKN/2002, isolated from a disease outbreak occurring in Hong Kong in February 2002, was determined and compared with the sequences of other FMDVs. The VP1 coding region was 639 nucleotides in length and encoded a protein of 213 amino acid residues. Comparison of the VP1 nucleotide sequence with those of other isolates indicated that HKN/2002 belonged to serotype O. A VP1-based sequence similarity tree of several South-east Asian FMDV-O isolates showed that HKN/2002 was most closely related to FMDV isolates found in Hong Kong from 1991 to 1999 and Taiwan in 1997. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the major immunogenic region of HKN/2002 with that of the serotype O vaccine strain, O1/Manisa/Turkey/69, reveals significant similarity, indicating that current serotype O vaccines may offer some degree of protection against HKN/2002.
