A novel DNA virus (TTV) was identified recently in Japanese patients with posttransfusion hepatitis non-A-E and has been implicated as a cause of acute and chronic liver diseases of unknown etiology in some patients. The frequency of TTV infections was investigated in 284 blood donors, 105 patients with different liver disorders before and after liver transplantation (OLT), as well as in 64 patients with chronic hepatitis C who received antiviral therapy. TTV infections were found more frequently by nested-PCR in patients with liver disorders (15%) as compared to blood donors (7%). TTV occurred independently of the aetiology of the liver disease (e.g., cryptogenic cirrhosis [12.5%], alcoholic cirrhosis [16%], fulminant hepatic failure non-A-E [35%], and chronic hepatitis C [12.5%]; p=n.s.). After OLT, a high rate of TTV de novo infections (44%) was observed. However, TTV viremia after OLT (in 56 out of the 105 patients) was not associated with graft hepatitis. Analysis of patients with chronic hepatitis C coinfected with TTV who have been treated with interferon alpha alone or in combination with ribavirin revealed that TTV is an interferon-sensitive virus. Phylogenetic analysis of TTV sequences suggest that at least four different genotypes and several subtypes exist in Germany. In conclusion, the high prevalence of TTV infections observed in patients with parenteral risk factors is an argument in favour of transmission of the virus via blood and blood products. A relevant hepatitis-inducing capacity of TTV, however, seems unlikely, considering the observation that in the majority of patients, TTV infection after OLT was not accompanied by graft hepatitis.
