Recently, human interleukin 18 (hIL-18) cDNA was cloned, and the recombinant protein with a tentatively assigned NH2-terminal amino acid sequence was generated. However, natural hIL-18 has not yet been isolated, and its cellular processing is therefore still unclear. To clarify this, we purified natural hIL-18 from the cytosolic extract of monocytic THP.1 cells. Natural hIL-18 exhibited a molecular mass of 18.2 kDa, and the NH2-terminal amino acid was Tyr37. Biological activities of the purified protein were identical to those of recombinant hIL-18 with respect to the enhancement of natural killer cell cytotoxicity and interferon-gamma production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We also found two precursor hIL-18 (prohIL-18)-processing activities in the cytosol of THP.1 cells. These activities were blocked separately by the caspase inhibitors Ac-YVAD-CHO and Ac-DEVD-CHO. Further analyses of the partially purified enzymes revealed that one is caspase-1, which cleaves prohIL-18 at the Asp36-Tyr37 site to generate the mature hIL-18, and the other is caspase-3, which cleaves both precursor and mature hIL-18 at Asp71-Ser72 and Asp76-Asn77 to generate biologically inactive products. These results suggest that the production and processing of natural hIL-18 are regulated by two processing enzymes, caspase-1 and caspase-3, in THP.1 cells.
