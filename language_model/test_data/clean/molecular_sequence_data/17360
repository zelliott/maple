In North America it has been shown that distinct hemotropic mycoplasmas exist in dogs. Blood samples from 460 French dogs were analyzed by PCR to evaluate hemoplasma infection status. Seventy-one dogs (15.4%) were positive; of these, 44 (9.6%) were infected with an organism closely related to "Candidatus Mycoplasma haemoparvum" only, 15 (3.3%) were infected with Mycoplasma haemocanis only, and 12 dogs (2.6%) were dually infected with both organisms.
