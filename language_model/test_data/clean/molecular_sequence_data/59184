A short tandem repeat (STR) in the D12S391 locus was sequenced in more than 40 individuals. Twenty different alleles were found and these could be grouped into 12 allelic classes in accordance with the total number of repeats. This is a compound STR consisting of blocks of (AGAT) and (AGAC) repeats with basic sequence structure (AGAT)8-17(AGAC)6-10(AGAT)0-1. Whereas smaller alleles (15-18) have variation limited to the (AGAT) unit, in larger alleles the complexity is greater with variation in the number of tandem arrays in the two motifs (AGAT) and (AGAC). Population data showed that this is a highly polymorphic STR with a heterozygosity of more than 0.9. This fact, together with its simple structure, makes this STR an interesting DNA polymorphism for forensic and genetic purposes.
