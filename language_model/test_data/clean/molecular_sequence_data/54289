Photoperiod-thermo-sensitive genic male sterile (PTGMS) rice exhibits a number of desirable traits for hybrid rice production. The cloning genes responsible for PTGMS and those elucidating male sterility mechanisms and reversibility to fertility would be of great significance to provide a foundation to develop new male sterile lines. Guangzhan63S, a PTGMS line, is one of the most widely used indica two-line hybrid rice breeding systems in China. In this study, genetic analysis based on F(2) and BC(1)F(2) populations derived from a cross between Guangzhan63S and 1587, determined a single recessive gene controls male sterility in Guangzhan63S. Molecular marker techniques combined with bulked-segregant analysis (BSA) were used and located the target gene (named ptgms2-1) between two SSR markers RM12521 and RM12823. Fine mapping of the ptgms2-1 locus was conducted with 45 new Insertion-Deletion (InDel) markers developed between the RM12521 and RM12823 region, using 634 sterile individuals from F(2) and BC(1)F(2) populations. Ptgms2-1 was further mapped to a 50.4 kb DNA fragment between two InDel markers, S2-40 and S2-44, with genetic distances of 0.08 and 0.16 cM, respectively, which cosegregated with S2-43 located on the AP004039 BAC clone. Ten genes were identified in this region based on annotation results from the RiceGAAS system. A nuclear ribonuclease Z gene was identified as the candidate for the ptgms2-1 gene. This result will facilitate cloning the ptgms2-1 gene. The tightly linked markers for the ptgms2-1 gene locus will further provide a useful tool for marker-assisted selection of this gene in rice breeding programs.
