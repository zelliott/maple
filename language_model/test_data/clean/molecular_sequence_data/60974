A MADS-box gene, MdMADS2, was isolated from the apple (Malus x domestica Borkh.) var Fuji and its developmental expression pattern was studied during flower development. MdMADS2 shares a high degree of amino acid sequence identity with the SQUAMOSA subfamily of genes. RNA blot analysis showed that MdMADS2 is transcribed through all stages of flower development, and its transcription was seen in the four floral organs. RNA in situ hybridization revealed that the MdMADS2 mRNA is expressed both in the inflorescence meristem and in the floral meristem. The MdMADS2 transcript was detected at all stages of flower development. Protein localization analysis showed that MdMADS2 protein was excluded from the stamen and carpel primordia, in which a considerable MdMADS2 mRNA signal was detected. This indicates that posttanscriptional regulation may be involved in the MdMADS2-mediated control of flower development. Transgenic tobacco expressing the MdMADS2 gene from the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter showed early flowering and shorter bolts, but did not show any homeotic changes in the floral organs. These results suggest that MdMADS2 plays an important role during early stages of flower development.
