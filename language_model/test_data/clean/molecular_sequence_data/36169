To understand better the organization and linkage of the interleukin genes, IL4 and IL5, we prepared long-range restriction maps of five yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) containing IL5. We determined that IL4 and IL5 are within 100-170 kb, and that the regions surrounding these genes contain several GC-rich areas. Fluorescence in situ chromosomal analysis demonstrated that three of the five YAC clones contain non-contiguous genomic sequences originating from multiple human chromosomes.
