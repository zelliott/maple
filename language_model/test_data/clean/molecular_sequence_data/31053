Human alpha-ANP was synthesised using a yeast system. In order to obtain correct expression of the human alpha-ANP gene, a few bases on one strand were substituted by the corresponding yeast sequence, but those bases were not replaced in the complementary so a few unpaired bases existed. The gene was cloned into a shuttle vector (with alpha-factor). The recombinants containing different human alpha-ANP DNA sequences were separated by BglII restriction analysis. We compared the expression level of human alpha-ANP from two kinds of genes and the results showed that the ANP expression level by the gene containing yeast sequences was lower (0.5-0.7 mg/L) than that expressed by the original gene (0.8-1.0 mg/L).
