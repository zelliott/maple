The recA gene from Clostridium perfringens was cloned using degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed from conserved regions of RecA proteins from other bacteria. The 1089 bp gene encoded a putative RecA protein with 69% amino acid sequence similarity to the RecA protein from Bacillus subtilis. The C. perfringens recA gene was induced by exposure to methyl methanesulphonate and complemented a recA mutant of Escherichia coli. A cheo box was identified in the region upstream of the gene. Since this SOS-like operator site is conserved in many DNA-damage-inducible recA gene regions from Gram-positive bacteria, the results suggest that the regulation of the C. perfringens recA gene also involves the binding of a LexA-like protein to this site.
