The integrase protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 carries out a set of polynucleotidyl transfer reactions that result in the covalent attachment of the retroviral cDNA to host DNA. We have analyzed the activities of a set of deletion derivatives of the integrase protein. The analysis reveals that a central domain of only 137 amino acids is sufficient in vitro to catalyze a subset of the reactions carried out by the complete protein. This polypeptide contains an amino acid sequence motif, Asp-Xaa39-58-Asp-Xaa35-Glu (DX39-58DX35E, where X and the subscript indicate the intervening amino acids between the invariant acidic residues), that is found in the integrases of retroviruses and retrotransposons and also the transposase proteins of some bacterial transposable elements. We also find that the integrase protein can bind Zn2+, and the histidine and cysteine residues of another conserved motif (HX3-7HX23-32CX2C) are required for efficient Zn2+ binding. The activities displayed by deletion mutants suggest to us possible functions for the various parts of integrase.
