Morbilliviruses constitute a major threat to the health of animal and man. To date the Morbillivirus genus in the Paramyxoviridae family comprises five established members, namely canine distemper virus (CDV), phocine distemper virus (PDV), measles virus (MV), rinderpest virus (RPV), and peste-des-petits-ruminants virus (PPRV). In addition, morbillivirus candidates infecting aquatic mammals were recently discovered. The present review on the biology of morbilliviruses focuses on knowledge gained by our group in studies on PDV and CDV. The aims of these studies were: i) to investigate the biological properties of the recently recognized PDV, which was found to be the primary etiology of epidemics with high mortality in seals in Western Europe, ii) to extend our knowledge of the biological properties of CDV. The morbillivirus particle is enveloped. The helical nucleocapsid core contains a single-stranded, non-segmented RNA genome of negative sense of 15 to 16 kilobases in length. The genome is organized in six transcriptional units or genes. Overall, the studies of the genome of PDV revealed a genetic map principally fitting with that determined for other morbilliviruses. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences have been determined for five PDV genes named in analogy with the encoded structural proteins of other morbilliviruses in the order: 3'N(1683)-P(1644)-M(1443)-F(2206)-H(1952)-L5' (The figures in brackets denote nucleotide lengths of the genes of the Danish PDV isolate). The L gene (covering approximately 8900 nucleotides) remains to be sequenced. The six genes are likely to code for at least eight distinct proteins. The nucleocapsid (N) protein was found to consist of 523 amino acids in PDV. The following gene of the transcription map encoded the P protein of 507 amino acid residues. Similar to other morbilliviruses, the P gene of PDV was shown to have additional coding capacity for two distinct proteins V (299 amino acids) and C (174 amino acids). The results presented provide evidence for editing at transcript of the PDV P gene by insertion of nontemplated G residues at a specific site. The edited version of the mRNA was found to encode the cystein-rich V protein. The three envelope-associated proteins of PDV were predicted to consist of 335 (M), 537 (F0) and 607 (H) amino acid residues. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the N, P, M, F, and H genes of PDV were aligned with corresponding sequences of other established members of the genus Morbillivirus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
