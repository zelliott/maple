A dot blot hybridization assay for parvovirus B19 diagnosis was developed by using a PCR-generated probe, digoxigenin labelling, and chemiluminescence detection. Different labelling techniques and hybridization solutions were evaluated. From this analysis a protocol was devised for routine diagnostic use. The protocol enabled 1 pg of B19 DNA to be detected. The results of applying this method to 8,369 diagnostic samples collected during 1994 and 1995 are given.
