Methionine is the universal translation start but the first methionine is removed from most mature proteins. This review focuses on our present knowledge of the five enzymes sustaining the methionine pathway in translation initiation in Escherichia coli: methionyl-tRNA synthetase, methionyl-tRNA(fMet) formyltransferase, peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase, peptide deformylase and methionine aminopeptidase. The possible significance of retaining methionine as initiation signal is discussed.
