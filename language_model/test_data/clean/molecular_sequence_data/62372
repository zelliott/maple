G-protein alpha subunits are involved in transmission of signals for development, pathogenicity, and secondary metabolism in plant pathogenic and saprophytic fungi. We cloned two G-protein alpha subunit genes, tgaA and tgaB, from the biocontrol fungus Trichoderma virens. tgaA belongs to the fungal Galphai class, while tgaB belongs to the class defined by gna-2 of Neurospora crassa. We compared loss-of-function mutants of tgaA and tgaB with the wild type for radial growth, conidiation, germination of conidia, the ability to overgrow colonies of Rhizoctonia solani and Sclerotium rolfsii in confrontation assays, and the ability to colonize the sclerotia of these pathogens in soil. Both mutants grew as well as the wild type, sporulated normally, did not sporulate in the dark, and responded to blue light by forming a conidial ring. The tgaA mutants germinated by straight unbranched germ tubes, while tgaB mutants, like the wild type, germinated by wavy and highly branched germ tubes. In confrontation assays, both tgaA and tgaB mutants and the wild type overgrew, coiled, and lysed the mycelia of R. solani, but tgaA mutants had reduced ability to colonize S. rolfsii colonies. In the soil plate assay, both mutants parasitized the sclerotia of R. solani, but tgaA mutants were unable to parasitize the sclerotia of S. rolfsii. Thus, tgaA is involved in antagonism against S. rolfsii, but neither G protein subunit is involved in antagonism against R. solani. T. virens, which has a wide host range, thus employs a G-protein pathway in a host-specific manner.
