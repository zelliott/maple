Programmed ribosomal frameshifting provides a mechanism to decode information located in two overlapping reading frames by diverting a proportion of translating ribosomes into a second open reading frame (ORF). The result is the production of two proteins: the product of standard translation from ORF1 and an ORF1-ORF2 fusion protein. Such programmed frameshifting is commonly utilized as a gene expression mechanism in viruses that infect eukaryotic cells and in a subset of cellular genes. RNA secondary structures, consisting of pseudoknots or stem-loops, located downstream of the shift site often act as cis-stimulators of frameshifting. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that antisense oligonucleotides can functionally mimic these RNA structures to induce +1 ribosomal frameshifting when annealed downstream of the frameshift site, UCC UGA. Antisense-induced shifting of the ribosome into the +1 reading frame is highly efficient in both rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation reactions and in cultured mammalian cells. The efficiency of antisense-induced frameshifting at this site is responsive to the sequence context 5' of the shift site and to polyamine levels.
