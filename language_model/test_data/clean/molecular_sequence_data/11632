A triplex-forming oligopyrimidine has been attached at its 5'-end to a photoreactive psoralen derivative and used to target a sequence which forms part of the coding region of the human aromatase gene. The 20 base pair sequence is not a perfect triplex target since it contains three pyrimidine interruptions within the purine-rich strand. Despite this, we have detected triplex-directed photoadduct formation at pH 7.0 between the psoralen-linked oligonucleotide and a 30mer duplex representing the aromatase target. Photoadduct formation was found to be sensitive to pH, temperature, cation concentration and the base composition of the third strand. By varying the base sequence of the target duplex around the psoralen intercalation site, we have characterised the site and mode of psoralen intercalation. The attached psoralen has been found to intercalate at the triplex-duplex junction with a strong preference for one orientation. We have shown that the psoralen will bind at the junction even when there is a preferred TpA step at an adjacent site. We have also compared the binding affinity and photoreactivity of oligodeoxyribonucleotides linked to two different psoralen derivatives and found differences in the rate of crosslinking and the extent of crosslink formation. Finally, we have examined oligodeoxyribonucleotides which are attached to psoralen by polymethylene linkers of different lengths.
