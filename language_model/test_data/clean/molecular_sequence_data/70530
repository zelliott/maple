There is considerable interest in the structure of the denatured state and in the role local interactions play in protein stability and protein folding. Studies of peptide fragments provide one method to assess local conformational preferences which may be present in the denatured state under native-like conditions. A set of peptides corresponding to the individual elements of secondary structure derived from the N-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein L9 have been synthesized. This small 56 residue protein adopts a mixed alpha-beta topology and has been shown to fold rapidly in an apparent two-state fashion. The conformational preferences of each peptide have been analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Peptides corresponding to each of the three beta-stands and to the first alpha-helix are unstructured as judged by CD and NMR. In contrast, a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal helix is remarkably structured. This 17 residue peptide is 53 % helical at pH 5.4, 4 degrees C. Two-dimensional NMR studies demonstrate that the helical structure is distributed approximately uniformly throughout the peptide, although there is some evidence for fraying at the C terminus. Detailed analysis of the NMR spectra indicate that the helix is stabilized, in part, by a native N-capping interaction involving Thr40. A mutant peptide which lacks Thr40 is only 32 % helical. pH and ionic strength-dependent studies suggested that charge charge interactions make only a modest net contribution to the stability of the peptide. The protein contains a trans proline peptide bond located at the first position of the C-terminal helix. NMR analysis of the helical peptide and of a smaller peptide containing the proline residue indicates that only a small amount of cis proline isomer (8 %) is likely to be populated in the unfolded state.
