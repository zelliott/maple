Helix 1 of the membrane-associated closed state of the colicin E1 channel domain was studied by site-directed fluorescence labeling where bimane was covalently attached to a single cysteine residue in each mutant protein. A number of fluorescence properties of the tethered bimane fluorophore were measured in the membrane-bound state of the channel domain, including fluorescence emission maximum, fluorescence quantum yield, fluorescence anisotropy, membrane bilayer penetration depth, surface accessibility, and apparent polarity. The data show that helix 1 is an amphipathic alpha-helix that is situated parallel to the membrane surface. A least squares fit of the various data sets to a harmonic function indicated that the periodicity and angular frequency for helix 1 are typical for an amphipathic alpha-helix (3.7 +/- 0.1 residues per turn and 97 +/- 3.0 degrees, respectively) that is partially bathing into the membrane bilayer. Dual fluorescence quencher analysis also revealed that helix 1 is peripherally membrane-associated, with one face of the helix dipping into the lipid bilayer and the other face projecting toward the solvent. Finally, our data suggest that the helical boundaries of helix 1, at least at the C-terminal region, remain unaffected upon binding to the surface of the membrane in support of a toroidal pore model for this colicin.
