Molecular characterization of seven Diocleinae lectins was assessed by sequence analysis, determination of molecular masses by mass spectrometry, and analytical ultracentrifugation equilibrium sedimentation. The lectins show distinct pH-dependent dimer-tetramer equilibria, which we hypothesize are due to small primary structure differences at key positions. Lectins from Dioclea guianensis, Dioclea virgata, and Cratylia floribunda seeds have been crystallized and preliminary X-ray diffraction analyses are reported.
