TraI protein of plasmid R1 possesses two activities, a DNA transesterase and a highly processive 5'-3' DNA helicase, which are essential for bacterial conjugation. Regulation of the functional domains of the enzyme is poorly understood. TraI cleaves supercoiled oriT DNA with site and strand specificity in vitro but fails to initiate unwinding from this site (nic). The helicase requires an extended region of adjacent single-stranded DNA to enter the duplex, yet interaction of purified TraI with oriT DNA alone or as an integral part of the IncF relaxosome does not melt sufficient duplex to load the helicase. This study aims to gain insights into the controlled initiation of both TraI-catalyzed activities. Linear double-stranded DNA substrates with a central region of sequence heterogeneity were used to trap defined lengths of R1 oriT sequence in unwound conformation. Concomitant reconstitution of TraI DNA transesterase and helicase activities was observed. Efficient helicase activity was measured on substrates containing 60 bases of open duplex but not on substrates containing < or =30 bases in open conformation. The additional presence of auxiliary DNA-binding proteins TraY and Escherichia coli integration host factor did not stimulate TraI activities on these substrates. This model system offers a novel approach to investigate factors controlling helicase loading and the directionality of DNA unwinding from nic.
