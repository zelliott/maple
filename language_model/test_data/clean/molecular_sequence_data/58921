Two monoclonal antibodies with specificity for rat gammadelta T cell receptor (TCR) were generated. One, called V65, reacts with all CD3+ alphabeta TCR- rat Tcells and thus recognizes a constant determinant of the rat gammadelta TCR (KÃ¼hnlein et al., Journal of Immunology 1994, 153: 979). The other, called V45, reacts with approximately 80% of gammadelta T cells in peripheral lymphoid organs. In rat epidermis, V65 but not V45 detects a dense network of the dendritic epidermal Tcells (DETC). Analysis of epidermal RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) indicated that Vgamma3 and Vdelta1 are the predominant, if not exclusive TCR V transcripts present at this site. Sequence analysis of cDNA clones obtained by reverse transcription-PCR with Vgamma3- and Vdelta1-specific primers revealed that the variable domains of rat DETC gamma and delta chains are very homologous to those described in mice (92% and 95% identity at the protein level). The complete conservation between the two species of the amino acid sequences at the V-(D)-J transitions of this monomorphic receptor indicates that the interaction of the DETC TCR with its as yet unknown ligand must be of central importance for DETC function.
