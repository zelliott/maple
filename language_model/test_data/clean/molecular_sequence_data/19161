Variants of the Bach2 gene are linked to vitiligo, celiac disease, and type 1 diabetes, but the underlying immunological mechanisms are unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that Bach2 plays crucial roles in maintaining T cell quiescence and governing the differentiation, activation, and survival of Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells. Bach2-deficient T cells display spontaneous activation and produce elevated levels of Th1/Th2-type cytokines. Without Bach2, Treg cells exhibit diminished Foxp3 expression, depleted numbers, hyperactivation, enhanced proliferation, and profound loss of competitive fitness in vivo. Mechanistically, reduced survival of Bach2-deficient Treg cells was associated with reduced Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 levels and elevated Bim/Bcl-2 ratio. Additionally, Bach2 deficiency induced selective loss of Helios(-)Foxp3(+) Treg cells and a Treg cell transcriptome skewed toward the Th1/Th2 effector program at the expense of the Treg program. In vitro experiments confirmed that Bach2: 1) is indispensable for TCR/TGF-Î²-induced Foxp3 expression; and 2) mitigates aberrant differentiation of Treg cells by repression of the competing Gata3-driven Th2 effector program. Importantly, perturbations in the differentiation of induced Treg cells was linked to a fatal Th2-type chronic inflammatory lung disease in Bach2-deficient mice. Thus, Bach2 enforces T cell quiescence, promotes the development and survival of Treg lineage, restrains aberrant differentiation of Treg cells, and protects against immune-mediated diseases.
