Cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene of a squid (Mollusca), Doryteuthis mitochondrial genome was sequenced. Comparison with the nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence of other animal mitochondria suggests that the squid mitochondria has a variation in the genetic code; UGA codes for tryptophan, AUA for methionine and AGA/G for serine. This situation is similar to the case of Drosophila or Ascaris mitochondria.
