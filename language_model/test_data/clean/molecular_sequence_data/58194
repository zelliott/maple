We have previously observed that bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) induces the appearance of five cellular proteins in C127 mouse fibroblasts, four of which appear to arise by altered processing of resident endoplasmic reticulum proteins. Studies of various cell lines revealed that expression of the 3' end of the BPV early region was sufficient for induction of these changes. To identify the BPV gene responsible, we have utilized the simian virus 40 (SV40)/BPV-1 recombinant virus Pava-1, which expresses the 3' end of the BPV early region behind an SV40 early promoter. C127 cells infected with Pava-1 for 48 h show the expected BPV-associated alterations, as do cells infected with Pava constructs mutated in the E5 or E2 genes. However, a mutation in the start codon of a previously ignored open reading frame extending from nucleotides 4013 to 4170 (E5B) eliminated the BPV-associated changes. Similar results were obtained with COS cells infected with the Pava mutants and C127 cells transformed by full-length mutated BPV. Despite its influence on the processing of cellular endoplasmic reticulum proteins, this mutation in E5B did not alter BPV-transforming efficiency or the ability of transformants to form colonies in soft agar. The E5B open reading frame encodes a hydrophobic 52-amino-acid polypeptide that shares structural similarities with HPV6 E5A and HPV16 E5. Speculations on a role for E5B in the viral life cycle are discussed.
