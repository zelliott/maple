Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) was originally discovered in fish, in which it causes aggregation or concentration of melanin granules in melanophores, thus regulating body color. MCH is a cyclic neuropeptide synthesized as a preprohormone in the hypothalamus of all vertebrates. Mammalian MCH plays an important role as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in regulating food intake and energy homeostasis. MCH signaling system may involve in regulating food intake also in fish. This neuropeptide binds to G-protein-coupled seven transmembrane receptor[s] to mediate its functions. This article reviews MCH and MCH receptor signaling systems in body color change and food intake in fish.
