Processing of polypeptide precursors by proprotein convertases (PCs) such as furin typically occurs within the trans-Golgi network. Here, we show in a variety of cell types that the propeptide of ADAMTS9 is not excised intracellularly. Pulse-chase analysis in HEK293F cells indicated that the intact zymogen was secreted to the cell surface and was subsequently processed there before release into the medium. The processing occurred via a furin-dependent mechanism as shown using PC inhibitors, lack of processing in furin-deficient cells, and rescue by furin in these cells. Moreover, down-regulation of furin by small interference RNA reduced ADAMTS9 processing in HEK293F cells. PC5A could also process pro-ADAMTS9, but similarly to furin, processed forms were absent intracellularly. Cell-surface, furin-dependent processing of pro-ADAMTS9 creates a precedent for extracellular maturation of endogenously produced secreted proproteins. It also indicates the existence of a variety of mechanisms for processing of ADAMTS proteases.
