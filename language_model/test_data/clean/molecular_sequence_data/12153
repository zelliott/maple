Kinetics of photomodification of 26-meric deoxyribonucleotide pTTGCCTTGAATGGGAA-GAGGGTCATT with derivatives of the complementary oligonucleotides pTCTTCCCATTC, pTCTTCCCA, and pTTCCCA bearing a residue of (p-azidotetrafluorobenzoyl)aminopropylamine(-ArN3) attached to the terminal phosphate (reagents I, II, and III, respectively) was studied at 37 degrees C. It was established that during irradiation the reagents are inactivated, loosing their affinity to the target. A kinetic equation describing the modification was suggested. From the dependence of the time-limited modification level on the reagent concentration, the association constants of the reagents with the target were determined: [Kx = (9.9 +/- 0.4) x 10(4), (1.1 +/- 0.1) x 10(5), and (8.4 +/- 2.1) x 10(6) M-1 for reagents I, II, and III, respectively] and the efficiency of the modification in the complex gamma ef (ca. 0.3 for all the reagents) were determined. From the dependence of the modification level [PZ]/p0 on time for reagent II, the rate constant was determined for the rate-determining step of the photomodification k0 = (7.9 +/- 0.9) x 10(-3) s-1, which is close to the rate constant for the photolysis of p-azidotetrafluorobenzoic acid kp = (5.5 +/- 0.3) x 10(-3) s-1.
