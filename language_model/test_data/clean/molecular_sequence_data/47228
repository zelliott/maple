The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) has become one of the most versatile and powerful eukaryotic systems for recombinant protein expression. We have constructed a novel baculovirus transfer vector (pbacAVs+C) which allows for the efficient production, detection, and single-step purification of the desired molecule as a secretion-compatible avidin fusion protein in insect cells. It also enables fast construction of the baculoviruses by site-specific transposition in Escherichia coli. To demonstrate the power of this vector, we report here on the production of immunologically intact hevein, a major cysteine-rich latex allergen, as avidin fusion protein. Our results indicate that avidin is a stable and versatile tag in the BEVS. It retains its extraordinarily high biotin-binding activity and also enables independent folding of the fusion partner. The versatility with which avidin fusion proteins can be detected, purified, and immobilized is the basis for the use of our system as a useful alternative in eukaryotic fusion protein production.
