A laboratory colony was established in order to enable molecular sexing in premature stages in the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens. We found four male-specific amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) in the planthopper, and sequenced one of the AFLPs along with its 5' flanking region (1,423 bp in total). PCR primers were designed based on the nucleotide sequence information so that the PCR product was present in male planthoppers and absent in female planthoppers. However, we could not completely distinguish males from females, because the PCR amplification product was absent in some of the males screened. We, therefore, established a laboratory colony, in which all males carried this sequence. We can directly sex pre-adult stages in this colony using our PCR primers, making this strain of considerable value for studies that require sex separation in egg and nymphal stages.
