Pardaxin, an amphipathic polypeptide secreted by the Red Sea flatfish Pardachirus marmoratus whose sequence is NH2-G-F-F-A-L-I-P-K-I-I-S-S-P-L-F-K-T-L-L-S-A-V-G-S-A-L-S-S-S-G-G-Q-E, was synthesized by the solid-phase method. The structure was verified by sequencing. The synthetic polypeptide changed the resistance of lipid bilayers by forming pores. At 10(-7)-10(-8) M, the synthetic pardaxin increased the frequency of the spontaneous release of quanta of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction by up to 100-fold, resembling the native product. Synthetic pardaxin seems to be a suitable tool for investigating the molecular structures underlying channel selectivity.
