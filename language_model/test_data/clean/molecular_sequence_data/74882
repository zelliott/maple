Pea lectin was exposed to a pH range of 7-13. It was observed that alkaline-unfolding resulted in a molten globule-like intermediate at pH 11. The structural stability of this alkaline unfolded molten globule-like state of pea lectin was studied in the presence of HFIP. Thermal studies showed that this state was more susceptible to thermal denaturation as compared to the native state and it became even more so in presence of HFIP.
