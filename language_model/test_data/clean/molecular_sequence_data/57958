The structure of the Vibrio fluvialis M-940 O-antigen polysaccharide has been investigated by sugar and methylation analyses, specific degradations, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. It is proposed that it consists of a heptasaccharide unit having the following structure. alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->2)-alpha-L-Fucp-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Galp-(1--> 2)-alpha-L-Fucp- (1-->3)-beta-D-GlcpA-(1-->4)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->3)-beta-D-Glc pNAc-(1--> The heptasaccharide is most probably linked to the 3-position of an alpha-D-galactopyranosyl residue in the core.
