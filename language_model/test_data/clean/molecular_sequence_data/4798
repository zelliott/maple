In mammals, one of the major actions of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is to increase skeletal growth by stimulating new cartilage formation. IGF-I stimulates chondrocytes in vitro to synthesize new cartilage matrix, measured by enhanced uptake of 35S-sulfate, but the addition of insulin does not produce a similar effect except when added at high concentrations. However, recent studies have shown that, in teleosts, both insulin and IGF-I are potent activators of 35S-sulfate uptake in gill cartilage. To further characterize the growth-promoting activities of these hormones in fish, we have used reverse transcriptase-linked PCR to analyze the expression of insulin receptor family genes in salmon gill cartilage. Partial cDNA sequences encoding the tyrosine kinase domains from six distinct members of the IR gene family were obtained, and sequence comparisons revealed that four of the cDNAs encoded amino acid sequences that were highly homologous to human IR whereas the encoded sequences from two of the cDNAs were more similar to the human type I IGF receptor (IGF-R). Furthermore, a comparative reverse transcriptase-linked PCR assay revealed that the four putative IR mRNAs expressed in toto in gill cartilage were 56% of that found in liver whereas the expressed amount of the two IGF-R mRNAs was 9-fold higher compared with liver. These results suggest that the chondrogenic actions of insulin and IGF-I in fish are mediated by the ligands binding to their cognate receptors. However, further studies will be required to characterize the binding properties and relative contribution of the individual IR and IGF-R genes.
