A clone of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) thymidine kinase (TK) gene was derived from a cDNA library of P3HR1 cells. The gene product was expressed as a fusion protein in a procaryotic system by using T7 RNA polymerase. The recombinant TK showed a molecular mass of 67 kDa and was biologically active. Antiserum raised in mice immunized with partially purified TK recognized an antigen present in EBV-superinfected Raji cells using an indirect immunofluorescence assay.
