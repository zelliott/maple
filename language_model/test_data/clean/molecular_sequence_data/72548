Clinical isolates of Escherichia coli were found to host a multiplicity of plasmids. These were resolved from plasmid gel profiles, from the properties of various transconjugants and transformants of E. coli DH1, by the topoisomerase I relaxation of covalently closed circle plasmid DNA, by electron microscopy, and by the determination of their compatibilities. The majority of these were unusually small, cryptic plasmids (SCPs). From one strain, KL4, 13 electrophoretic bands were resolved to five plasmids, three of which were SCPs. SCPs were phenotypically barren, and the smallest of these, pKL1, contained barely enough information for self-replication. A derivative of pKL1, pKL1Km, in which the transposon was restricted to a small 350-bp region, was stably maintained in Shigella, Salmonella, Serratia, and Citrobacter species and its replication was polA independent. pKL1 encoded only a single protein, RepA (Mr 17960), which specifically bound to pKL1 DNA. No apparent homologies with other RepA protein sequences could be detected. Thus the SCP, pKL1, is a novel minimal plasmid replicon encoding only enough information to ensure perpetuation. A hypothesis is presented describing SCPs as a class of selfish DNA that persists simply due to its ability to replicate and to its stability based on high copy number.
