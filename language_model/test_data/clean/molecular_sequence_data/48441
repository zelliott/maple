Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is a key adaptor molecule for the tumor necrosis factor superfamily and Toll-like/interleukin-1 receptor superfamily. It plays an important role in innate and adaptive immunity. The TRAF6 of Japanese scallop Mizuhopecten yessoensis (designated as MyTRAF6) was identified and characterized in this study. The full-length cDNA of MyTRAF6 was 2,407 bp, which consisted of 239-bp 5'-terminal untranslated region, 1,974-bp open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 657 amino acids, 194-bp of 3'-terminal untranslated region followed by a canonical polyadenylation signal sequence AATAAA and a poly (A) tail. The predicted amino acid sequence of MyTRAF6 contained the characteristic motifs of TRAF proteins, including a Zinc finger of RING-type, two Zinc fingers of TRAF-type, and a MATH (meprin and TRAF homology) domain. It had an overall identity of 43-96% with those of other TRAF6s, the highest identity (96%) with Chlamys farreri TRAF6, and the least identity (43%) with Meleagris gallopavo TRAF6. Phylogenetic analysis classified MyTRAF6 as a true TRAF6 ortholog. In addition, the promoter of MyTRAF6 was also identified by genome walking. It contained several potential transcription factor-binding sites and three single nucleotide polymorphisms. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that MyTRAF6 was highly expressed in hemocytes of adult M. yessoensis. MyTRAF6 transcript level in the hemocytes reached a maximum 6 h after Vibrio anguilarum challenge. The results indicated that MyTRAF6 may fulfill an important function during M. yessoensis bacterial infection. It could be a key effector molecule involved in the innate defense of molluscs.
