To construct the zinc finger protein-activating transcription factor (ZFP-ATF) plasmid and evaluate its efficacy in inducing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in EY.HY926 endothelial cells.

Firstly, we constructed the ZFP-ATF plasmid, then testified the quantity of VEGF protein in EY.HY926 endothelial cells after transfected with ZFP-ATP plasmid by Western blot, finally, we used the RT-PCR to testify whether the ZFP-ATF can stimulate expression of VEGF splice variants.

The ZFP-ATF DNA sequences were located the multiclone sites of PVAX1 vector between the site of BamH1and Xhol.Western blot result showed VEGF expression in EY.HY926 endothelial cells transfected with ZFP-ATF plasmid was significantly higher than that in cells transfected with VEGF165 (19.95±3.95 vs.12.15±1.55 μg÷μL, P<0.01).RT-PCR result showed VEGF-A mRNA expression level induced by ZFP-ATF was high than that induced by VEGF165.

ZFP-ATF can up-regulate the VEGF-A expression in comparison with VEGF165, which might have beneficial effects in angiogenesis process.
