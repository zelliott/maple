The truncated hemoglobins HbN and HbO of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv share little sequence similarity and display structural differences in their EF-loop regions, suggesting distinct function(s) for these hemoglobins. HbO of M. tuberculosis was expressed in Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium smegmatis as a 14.5-kDa homodimeric heme protein exhibiting nearly 50-fold (P(50) approximately 0.51) lower oxygen affinity than HbN. 40-50% of HbO remained associated with the cell membranes and significantly enhanced its respiration in comparison with the membrane fractions of control cells or cells overproducing HbN. Oxygen uptake of HbO-associated membranes was decreased by washing and restored by adding HbO. Additionally, membrane vesicles prepared from terminal oxidase-deficient (cyo(-), cyd(-)) mutants of E. coli did not exhibit significant enhancement in oxygen uptake in the presence of HbO, suggesting its interaction(s) with the electron transport chain. Expression of HbO in Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin, an experimental model of M. tuberculosis, was observed (0.2-0.5% of total cellular proteins) throughout its aerobic growth. These results provided evidence for the involvement of HbO with the component of aerobic electron transport chain, suggesting that its function may be related to the facilitation of oxygen transfer during aerobic metabolism of M. tuberculosis. Membrane association properties of HbO may thus play a crucial role in sequestering oxygen and facilitating its availability to internalized M. tuberculosis (an obligate aerobe) under the hypoxic conditions of its intracellular habitat.
