Previously we found that replacement of seven amino acid residues in a loop region markedly shifted the coenzyme specificity of malate dehydrogenase from NAD(H) toward NADP(H). In the present study, we replaced the seven amino acid residues in the corresponding region of an NAD(H)-dependent lactate dehydrogenase with those of NADP(H)-dependent malate dehydrogenase, and examined the coenzyme specificity of the resulting mutant enzyme. Coenzyme specificity was significantly shifted by 399-fold toward NADPH when k cat/Km(coenzyme) was used as the measure of coenzyme specificity. The effect of the replacements on coenzyme specificity is discussed based on in silico simulation of the three-dimensional structure of the lactate dehydrogenase mutant.
