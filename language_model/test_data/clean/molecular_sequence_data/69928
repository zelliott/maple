The nerve terminal of neurons is filled with small synaptic vesicles, specialized secretory organelles involved in the storage and release of neurotransmitters. The synapsins are a family of four proteins that are the major peripheral proteins on the cytoplasmic face of synaptic vesicles. Synaptophysin is the major integral membrane protein of synaptic vesicles. The characterization of the synapsins and of synaptophysin during the last years has revealed exciting information about their structure, regulation and possible function. To understand the role of the synapsins and synaptophysin in the biology of a nerve cell means to elucidate the fundamental mechanism of brain function, the release of neurotransmitter.
