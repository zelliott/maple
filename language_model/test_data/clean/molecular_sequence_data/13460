We established and characterized persistently-infected DBT cells with mouse hepatitis virus to study the molecular mechanisms of MHV persistence and evolution in vitro. Following infection, viral mRNA and RF RNA were coordinately reduced by about 70% as compared to acute infection suggesting that the reduction in mRNA synthesis was due to reduced levels of transcriptionally active full length and subgenomic length negative-stranded RNAs. Although the rates of mRNA synthesis were also reduced, the relative percent molar ratio of the mRNAs and RF RNAs were similar to those detected during acute infection. In contrast to the finding during BCV persistence, analysis of the MHV leader RNA indicated that the leader RNA and leader/body junction sequences were extremely stable. These data suggested that polymorphism and mutations resulting in intraleader ORFs was not required for MHV persistence. Conversely MHV persistence was significantly associated with a A to G mutation at nt 77 in the 5' end untranslated region (UTR) of the genomic RNA.
