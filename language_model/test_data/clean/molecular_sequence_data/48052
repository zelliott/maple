Ribosomal protein S19 is a 10.6 kDa protein in the small subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome. We have determined a high-resolution solution structure of S19 from Thermus thermophilus. Structures were calculated using 1160 distance and dihedral angle restraints derived from (1)H, (15)N and (13)C NMR spectra. The structures show that S19 is a mixed alpha/beta protein with long disordered tails. The folding topology is not homologous to that of any other known protein structure. Potential rRNA and protein binding sites have been identified on the S19 surface.
