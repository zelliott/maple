Partially edited mRNAs were selected by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. In the case of cytochrome b, 102 out of 106 clones displayed patterns of editing that were consistent with a strictly progressive 3' to 5' editing process, as predicted by the guide RNA model of RNA editing. In the case of cytochrome oxidase subunit III (COIII), 177 out of 304 clones displayed strictly progressive 3' to 5' patterns of editing. However, the remaining 127 COIII clones displayed unexpected patterns in which upstream editing preceded downstream editing, uridines were inserted at sites not normally edited, and purine residues were deleted. We suggest that many of these RNAs are produced by normal 3' to 5' editing of the COIII mRNA with incorrect guide RNA molecules.
