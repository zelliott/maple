Hantaviruses, family Bunyaviridae, are rodent-borne RNA viruses that have caused cases of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in various regions of the Americas. There are five hantaviral lineages associated with HCPS in Brazil: Juquitiba virus (JUQV), Araraquara virus (ARAV), Laguna Negra-like virus (LNV), Castelo dos Sonhos virus (CASV), and Anajatuba virus (ANAJV). Three additional hantaviruses have been described in rodents alone: Rio Mearim virus, Jaborá virus, and a hantavirus lineage related to Seoul virus. This study describes the genetic detection and characterization of a Juquitiba-like hantavirus in Oligoryzomys nigripes, or the black-footed pygmy rice rat, in the Serra dos Orgãos National Park, Rio de Janeiro State, where so far no cases of HCPS have been reported.
