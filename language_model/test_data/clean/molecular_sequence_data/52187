An alternative method for amplification of DNA with unknown sequences was developed. This involves the direct ligation of a primer oligodeoxyribonucleotide itself to restricted DNA fragments with unknown sequences to be amplified by PCR. The oligonucleotide need not be phosphorylated and need not be annealed with its complementary oligonucleotide in advance for ligation. The ligation reaction seems to be independent of the concentration of unknown DNA, proceeds in short time, and is efficient. The ligation efficiency was more than 30% at a low concentration, 10 fg/microliters, of DNA. This method was applied to a microdissection/microcloning of the short arm of human chromosome 2. Of 65 clones screened for the highly repetitive sequences with total human genomic DNA, eleven (17%) were positive. Their inserts ranged in size from 150 to 1,200 bp (average, 460 bp). In Southern blot analysis, thirty consecutive clones all detected signals common to both total human genomic DNA and mouse-human hybrid cell DNA containing only chromosome 2 of human origin. Among them, 24 (80%) were unique sequences, and 6 (20%) were multi-copy (or intermediate-repeat) sequences. Thus, this method is simple and efficient, and provides an alternative way to amplify unknown DNA.
