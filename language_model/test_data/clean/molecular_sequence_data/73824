The positioning of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) constitutes an important step towards a functional map of the human genome, including candidate genes for human genetic disorders that have been localized by linkage analysis. We localized 59 ESTs on the human X chromosome, including 44 derived from infant brain and 15 from adult muscle cDNA libraries. Localizations by a somatic cell hybrid panel were refined for five cDNAs by mapping them in yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contigs.
