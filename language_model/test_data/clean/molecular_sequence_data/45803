The peptides of the neuropeptide Y (NPY) family exert their functions, including regulation of appetite and circadian rhythm, by binding to G-protein coupled receptors. Mammals have five subtypes, named Y1, Y2, Y4, Y5 and Y6, and recently Y7 has been discovered in fish and amphibians. In chicken we have previously characterized the first four subtypes and here we describe Y6 and Y7. The genes for Y6 and Y7 are located 1 megabase apart on chromosome 13, which displays conserved synteny with human chromosome 5 that harbours the Y6 gene. The porcine PYY radioligand bound the chicken Y6 receptor with a K(d) of 0.80 +/- 0.36 nm. No functional coupling was demonstrated. The Y6 mRNA is expressed in hypothalamus, gastrointestinal tract and adipose tissue. Porcine PYY bound chicken Y7 with a K(d) of 0.14 +/- 0.01 nm (mean +/- SEM), whereas chicken PYY surprisingly had a much lower affinity, with a Ki of 41 nm, perhaps as a result of its additional amino acid at the N terminus. Truncated peptide fragments had greatly reduced affinity for Y7, in agreement with its closest relative, Y2, in chicken and fish, but in contrast to Y2 in mammals. This suggests that in mammals Y2 has only recently acquired the ability to bind truncated PYY. Chicken Y7 has a much more restricted tissue distribution than other subtypes and was only detected in adrenal gland. Y7 seems to have been lost in mammals. The physiological roles of Y6 and Y7 remain to be identified, but our phylogenetic and chromosomal analyses support the ancient origin of these Y receptor genes by chromosome duplications in an early (pregnathostome) vertebrate ancestor.
