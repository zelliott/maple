To identify protein-tyrosine kinases which play an important role in the process of hepatocarcinogenesis, we have screened a murine liver cDNA library with v-fps kinase domain as a probe. Using low stringency screening, we could isolate cDNAs of a putative protein-tyrosine kinase, tec (tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma). Nucleotide sequences of the cDNAs show that the C-terminal domain of its predicted protein has significant homology with that of the members of the src family. The tec gene is expressed mainly in liver and faintly in heart, kidney and ovary. Northern analysis further shows that in 2 out of 4 cell lines of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) the tec gene is highly expressed compared to normal human liver. This is the first report showing a protein-tyrosine kinase which may be specifically involved in the cell growth of hepatocytes or in the step of hepatocarcinogenesis.
