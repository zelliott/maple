Yersinia enterocolitica O:9 strain Ruokola/71-c-PhiR1-37-R possesses mainly rough-type lipopolysaccaride (LPS) and smaller amounts of S-form LPS. Structural analysis of the former is reported here. After deacylation of the LPS, the phosphorylated carbohydrate backbone of the inner core-lipid A region could be isolated by using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography. Its structure was determined by means of compositional and methylation analyses and 1H-, 13C-, and 31P-NMR spectroscopy as: [see text] in which L-alpha-D-Hep is L-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptopyranose, D-alpha-D-Hep is D-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptopyranose, and Kdo is 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulopyranosonic acid. All hexoses are pyranoses.
