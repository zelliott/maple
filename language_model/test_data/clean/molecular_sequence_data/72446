Although serum transfer studies implicate IgG anti-platelet autoantibodies in the premature platelet destruction of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), many characteristics of these putative pathogenic autoantibodies remain unclear. The inability to obtain relevant monoclonal autoantibodies from patients has prevented their molecular, genetic and functional studies as a homogenous population. We have generated a monoclonal IgG anti-platelet alpha IIb beta 3 autoantibody (termed G1) from an ITP patient. G1 binds human platelets (both resting and activated) and purified alpha IIb beta 3 with a Kd of 1.57 x 10(-8) M. G1 utilizes VH4 and V lambda 2 genes. The G1 VH region apparently has a 30 nucleotide insertion in its second complementarity determining region (CDR). Notably, somatic CDR insertion in the VH region has been observed only in one IgG rheumatoid factor, and not in any characterized polyreactive human autoantibodies reported in the literature. Combined these data suggest G1 may be a disease-relevant autoantibody. Further generation and study of monoclonal IgG anti-platelet antibodies are warranted to determine the significance of such unusual autoantibodies in the immunopathogenesis of chronic ITP.
