A predominant glycoprotein in the vitelline envelope (VE) of the anuran Xenopus laevis is gp41, known to be proteolytically converted from gp43 of the coelomic egg envelope concomitant with the acquisition of egg fertilizability. To characterize the protein core of gp41, purified gp41 from VE was digested with lysyl endopeptidase, and peptides isolated from the digests were sequenced for amino acids to design degenerate primers for polymerase chain reaction. By reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with a poly(A)+ RNA from the ovary of an ovulated female Xenopus, a specifically amplified band was obtained and sequenced. The upstream and downstream sequences of the sequenced region were completed by 5'- and 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, respectively. The cDNA, referred to as gp43 cDNA, comprises 1423 base pairs and contains one open reading frame with a sequence for 460 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence of gp43 cDNA has a close similarity with that of mammalian ZP3. Northern blot and in situ hybridization studies indicated that gp43 mRNA is expressed in oocytes, particularly in the previtellogenic oocytes. A comparison of the N-terminal sequences of gp41 and gp43 strongly suggested that gp41 is generated at least by processing of the N-terminal portion of gp43 with oviductin.
