Genomic typing of in vitro amplified DNA with sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO) probes was performed for DRB1, DQA1, DQB1, DPA1 and DPB1 alleles in 54 random Norwegian rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and 181 healthy controls. DRB1 alleles encoding the serological specificity DR4 were found in 80% of the patients, compared to 34% of the controls (relative risk = 7.9, p less than 0.0001). All DR4-positive RA patients carried either DRB1*0401 (Dw4), 0404 (Dw14), or 0405 (Dw15), while no patients were found to carry DRB1*0402 (Dw10) or 0403 (Dw13). The frequency of the DRB1*0101 allele encoding DR1 was not increased, even among DR4-negative RA patients, and we were unable to detect any sharing of other class II alleles among DR4-negative patients. No contribution of any DQA1, DQB1, DPA1 or DPB1 alleles to RA susceptibility could be detected. The results suggest that in the Norwegian population RA is primarily associated with a shared sequence at residues 67-74 of the DR beta 1 chain, but only when this sequence is expressed on DR4 molecules.
