We have previously described a series of Ly-1+ B cell lines obtained as spontaneous outgrowth cultures from mouse spleen cells (B-Ly1 cells). In this study, we report the variable region sequences utilized by independent cell lines derived from three mouse strains. Remarkably, V region utilization and junctional diversification were essentially identical in all three cell lines. These included: lambda 1 light chain; JH1; DSP2-7,8; and, a novel VH gene segement. The VH was highly homologous to CP4, a rare VH family previously found in a group of Ly-1 B cell-derived autoantibodies to bromelain-treated mouse red blood cells. The selective expression of this unusual lg species implies the action of distinctive molecular or immunophysiological processes in the outgrowth of B-Ly1 cell lines. Clarification of these factors may be relevant to understanding the peculiar biology of Ly-1 B cells in vivo. We have also evaluated switch-committed B-Ly1 clones to determine whether this phenotype is accompanied by variable region somatic mutation. However, no evidence for somatic mutation was observed in these induced clones. This may indicate that these two processes are independently regulated, despite their common concordance in vivo.
