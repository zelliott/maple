Structural and functional analyses were used to investigate the regulation of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor (InsP3R) by Ca2+. To define the structural determinants for Ca2+ binding, cDNAs encoding GST fusion proteins that covered the complete linear cytosolic sequence of the InsP3R-1 were expressed in bacteria. The fusion proteins were screened for Ca2+ and ruthenium red binding through the use of 45Ca2+ and ruthenium red overlay procedures. Six new cytosolic Ca2+-binding regions were detected on the InsP3R in addition to the one described earlier (Sienaert, I., De Smedt, H., Parys, J. B., Missiaen, L., Vanlingen, S., Sipma, H., and Casteels, R. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 27005-27012). Strong 45Ca2+ and ruthenium red binding domains were localized in the N-terminal region of the InsP3R as follows: two Ca2+-binding domains were located within the InsP3-binding domain, and three Ca2+ binding stretches were localized in a 500-amino acid region just downstream of the InsP3-binding domain. A sixth Ca2+-binding stretch was detected in the proximity of the calmodulin-binding domain. Evidence for the involvement of multiple Ca2+-binding sites in the regulation of the InsP3R was obtained from functional studies on permeabilized A7r5 cells, in which we characterized the effects of Ca2+ and Sr2+ on the EC50 and cooperativity of the InsP3-induced Ca2+ release. The activation by cytosolic Ca2+ was due to a shift in EC50 toward lower InsP3 concentrations, and this effect was mimicked by Sr2+. The inhibition by cytosolic Ca2+ was caused by a decrease in cooperativity and by a shift in EC50 toward higher InsP3 concentrations. The effect on the cooperativity occurred at lower Ca2+ concentrations than the inhibitory effect on the EC50. In addition, Sr2+ mimicked the effect of Ca2+ on the cooperativity but not the inhibitory effect on the EC50. The different [Ca2+] and [Sr2+] dependencies suggest that three different cytosolic interaction sites were involved. Luminal Ca2+ stimulated the release without affecting the Hill coefficient or the EC50, excluding the involvement of one of the cytosolic Ca2+-binding sites. We conclude that multiple Ca2+-binding sites are localized on the InsP3R-1 and that at least four different Ca2+-interaction sites may be involved in the complex feedback regulation of the release by Ca2+.
