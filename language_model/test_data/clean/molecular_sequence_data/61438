hnRNPs H, H' and F belong to a subfamily of the hnRNPs sharing a high degree of sequence identity. Eukaryotic expression and specific C-terminal antibodies were used to demonstrate great variation in the intracellular fate of the proteins. hnRNPs H and H' become posttranslational cleaved into C-terminal 35 kDa proteins (H(C), H'(C)) and possibly into N-terminal 22 kDa proteins. No detectable cleavage was observed for hnRNP F. hnRNP H/H' is almost exclusively localized to the nucleus of many cell types while hnRNP F varies from a predominant nuclear localization in some cells to a predominant cytoplasmic localization in other cells. The different fates may reflect differences in functional roles that so far only have included nuclear functions. The presence of significant quantities of hnRNP F in the cytoplasm of many cells indicates that it also may have a functional role here.
