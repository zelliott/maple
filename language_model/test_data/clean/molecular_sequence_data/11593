Multivalent synthetic peptides derived from C5a were prepared in order to examine their effects on the C5a receptor (C5aR). Multiple antigen peptide (MAP) of the C5a C-terminal region (MAP61-74) bound to cells expressing C5aR with high affinity. On the other hand, N-terminal peptides (MAP3-16 and MAP12-26) and one with a sequence from the mid-portion of C5a (MAP37-53) did not bind to the cells. In addition, MAP61-74 inhibited Ca2+ mobilization and release of beta-hexosaminidase by C5a from dibutyryl cAMP-activated U937 cells. This Ca2+ mobilization was also inhibited by MAP12-26 and Mono61-74, the monomeric C-terminal peptide. Taken together, these data indicate that C5a binds to the C5aR via its C-terminal region. Furthermore, MAP61-74, a 14mer peptide that has additional amino acids at the N-terminal compared with the C-terminal octapaptide, can bind to C5aR and can be considered an antagonist of C5a which may prove useful as an agent for controlling the allergic response caused by complement activation.
