Two methanogenic strains, 8AcT and 6Ac, were isolated from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treating beer-manufacture wastewater in Beijing, China. Cells of strains 8AcT and 6Ac were rod-shaped (0.8-1.0 x 3-5 microm) and non-motile, occurring singly or in pairs; however, at high cell density the cells were arranged in long chains within a common sheath. The two strains used acetate exclusively for growth and methane production. The specific growth rate of strain 8AcT was 0.030 h(-1) when growing in acetate (20 mM) at 37 degrees C. The temperature range for growth was 25-45 degrees C, with the fastest growth at 34-37 degrees C. The pH range for growth and methane production was 6.5-9.0, with the fastest growth at pH 7.2-7.6. The G+C content of genomic DNA of strain 8AcT was 55.7 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity showed that the novel strains clustered with Methanosaeta species; the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities between strain 8AcT and Methanosaeta concilii DSM 3013 and 'Methanosaeta thermophila' DSM 6194 were 92.5 and 87.3 %, respectively. The sequence similarity levels of mcrA, the gene encoding the alpha-subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase, and of the deduced amino acids of mcrA, between strain 8AcT and Methanosaeta concilii DSM 3671T were 36 and 78.9 %, respectively. Based on the phylogenetic and phenotypic analyses, the novel species Methanosaeta harundinacea sp. nov. is proposed, with strain 8AcT (= JCM 13211T = CGMCC 1.5026T) as the type strain.
