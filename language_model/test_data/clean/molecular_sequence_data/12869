Four new antibiotic-resistant derivatives of the broad-host-range (bhr) cloning vector pBBR1MCS have been constructed. These new plasmids have several advantages over many of the currently available bhr vectors in that: (i) they are relatively small (< 5.3 kb), (ii) they possess an extended multiple cloning site (MCS), (iii) they allow direct selection of recombinant plasmid molecules in Escherichia coli via disruption of the LacZ alpha peptide, (iv) they are mobilizable when the RK2 transfer functions are provided in trans and (v) they are compatible with IncP, IncQ and IncW group plasmids, as well as with ColE1- and P15a-based replicons.
