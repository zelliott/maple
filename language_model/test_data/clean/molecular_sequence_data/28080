A novel photoreactive amino acid has been incorporated synthetically into two model peptides and the calmodulin-binding domain from myosin light chain kinase. Cross-linked photoadducts of each peptide with calmodulin have been prepared and digested by chemical and/or enzymatic methods to determine the site of label attachment. Depending on the position of the photoprobe in the peptide sequence, either Met-144 or Met-71 is photolabeled. These results are discussed in relation to the three-dimensional structure of calmodulin obtained crystallographically and the known solution properties of calmodulin.
