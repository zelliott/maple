A cDNA of the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) gene (rbcS) was isolated from cells of the liverwort Marchantia paleacea var. diptera. The rbcS was expressed light-independently in a green line, but light-dependently in a yellow line. The accumulation of the large subunit of RuBisCO was regulated cooperatively with that of the small subunit.
