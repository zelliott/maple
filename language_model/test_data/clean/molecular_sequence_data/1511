The methionine salvage pathway allows the in vivo recovery of the methylthio moiety of methionine upon the formation of methylthioadenosine (MTA) from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). The Fe(II)-containing form of acireductone dioxygenase (ARD) catalyzes the penultimate step in the pathway in Klebsiella oxytoca, the oxidative cleavage of the acireductone 1,2-dihydroxy-3-oxo-5-(methylthio)pent-1-ene (2) by dioxygen to give formate and 2-oxo-4-(methylthio)butyrate (3). The Ni(II)-bound form (Ni-ARD) catalyzes an off-pathway shunt, forming 3-(methylthio)propionate (4), carbon monoxide, and formate. Acireductone 2 is formed by the action of another enzyme, E1 enolase/phosphatase, on precursor 1-phosphonooxy-2,2-dihydroxy-3-oxo-5-methylthiopentane (1). Simple syntheses of several analogs of 1 are described, and their activity as substrates for E1 enolase/phosphatase characterized. A new bacterial overexpression system and purification procedure for E1, a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily, is described, and further characterization of the enzyme presented.
