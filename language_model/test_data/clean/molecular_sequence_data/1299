Recently, a new serine protease inhibitor family has been described in arthropods. Eight members were purified from locusts and 13 peptides have been identified by cDNA cloning. The peptides share a conserved cysteine array (Cys-Xaa(9-12)-Cys-Asn-Xaa-Cys-Xaa-Cys-Xaa(2-3)-Gly-Xaa(3-6)-Cys-Thr-Xaa(3)-Cys) with nine inhibitory domains (PLDs) of the light chain of the crayfish protease inhibitor, pacifastin. A molecular identification of a pacifastin-related precursor (SGPP-5) with three novel PLD-related peptides is presented in this study. This is a first report, identifying the presence of a SGPP-transcript in the brain, fore- and hindgut, including a 100-fold difference in fat body SGPP-transcript level of male as compared with female locust.
