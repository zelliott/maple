Metabolism of therapeutic drugs in the body by the mixed function oxidase system is an important consideration in the analysis of a drug's effectiveness. P450-dependent metabolism within the brain of a neuro-specific drug may affect the drug's course of action. To determine whether cytochrome P450 was expressed in brain, RNA was isolated from the whole brains of rats treated with a variety of known hepatic P450 inducers, including amitriptyline, imipramine, isosafrole, phenobarbital, and beta-naphthoflavone. The RNA was analyzed for the presence of P450 isozymes by the PCR technique. Differential expression of P450IA1, P450IIB1, P450IIB2, P450IID, and P450IIE1 was detected in the brain samples, depending on the treatment. Cytochrome P450 reductase expression was also detected in the brain samples, giving strong evidence that the brain contains a competent mixed function oxidase system under all conditions studied.
