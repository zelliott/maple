Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous parasitic protozoan causing congenital infection and severe encephalitis in the course of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Glycosyl-phosphatidylinositols of T. gondii have been shown to be identical with the low molecular weight antigen which elicits an early immunoglobulin M immune response in humans. A detailed study of the structures of these glycolipid antigens was performed. Radiolabelled glycolipids were extensively analysed by chemical and exoglycosidase treatments in combination with high pH anion-exchange chromatography, gel-filtration and lectin affinity chromatography. In addition, carbohydrate fragments prepared and purified from bulk preparations of unlabelled glycolipids by high performance liquid chromatography were subjected to two-dimensional 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, fast-atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, and methylation linkage analysis in order to elucidate the structure of T. gondii GPIs. The following structures were identified: (ethanolamine-PO4)-Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1-6(GalNAc beta 1-4)Man alpha 1-4GlcN alpha-inositol-PO4-lipid and the novel structure (ethanolamine-PO4)-Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1-6(Glc alpha 1-4GalNAc beta 1-4)Man alpha 1-4 GlcN alpha-inositol-PO4-lipid both with and without terminal ethanolamine phosphate. Evidence is provided, that only T. gondii GPIs bearing the unique glucose-N-acetylgalactosamine side branch are immunogenic in humans and that this structure is widely distributed among T. gondii isolates. Monoclonal antibodies have been characterized to recognize structures with different degrees of side-chain modification. We suggest that these reagents in combination with recently devised techniques for insertional mutagenesis in T. gondii should greatly facilitate the cloning of genes essential for GPI side-chain modification.
