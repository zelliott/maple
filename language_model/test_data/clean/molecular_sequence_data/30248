A HeLa DNA fragment, which may function as an anchorage point to the nuclear matrix for human chromosomes 1 and 2, also functions as an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the present report we show that this DNA fragment contains both bent DNA and an A-T rich region which appear to be associated with the ARS function. More interestingly, DNA sequence analysis shows that the spatial distribution of these features is strikingly similar to that found in the yeast ARS1 element.
