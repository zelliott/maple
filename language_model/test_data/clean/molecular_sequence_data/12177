The highly conserved protein gamma-tubulin is required for microtubule nucleation in vivo. When viewed in the electron microscope, a highly purified gamma-tubulin complex from Xenopus consisting of at least seven different proteins is seen to have an open ring structure. This complex acts as an active microtubule-nucleating unit which can cap the minus ends of microtubules in vitro.
