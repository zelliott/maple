Molecular analyses were done for the V3 region quasispecies of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains from plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the first HIV-1-infected long-term-nonprogressing mother-child pair whose members have survived for >13 years with stable CD4 T cell counts. There was a predominance of lower V3 loop charge and the absence of genotypic changes that are critical in phenotypic determination and tropism during HIV-1 infection. The intrahost genetic diversity between HIV-1 strains from the mother-child pair compared with HIV-1 strains from slow and rapid progressors suggested that a high genetic heterogeneity in HIV-1 strains from this HIV-1-infected long-term-nonprogressing mother and child pair was directly proportional to the length of their immunocompetent period.
