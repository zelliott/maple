AmyTM is a truncated mutant of the α-amylase of Bacillus stearothermophilus US100. It has been derived from the wild type amylase gene via a reading frame shift, following a tandem duplication of the mutant primer, associated to an Adenine base deletion. AmyTM was composed of 720 nucleotides encoding 240 amino acid residues out of 549 of the wild type. The AmyTM protein was devoided of the three catalytic residues but still retains catalytic activity. It is Ca-independent maltotetraose producing amylase, optimally active at pH 6 and 60°C, under monomeric or multimeric forms. AmyTM is the smallest functional truncated TIM barrel. It contains the βαβα unit as the minimal subdomain associated to an enzymatic function. The enzymatic activity can, until now, be attributed to the presence of the whole domain B, in the structure of AmyTM. This mutant revealed, for the first time, the regeneration of a catalytic site after its abolition. This fact may be considered as the restoration of a primitive active site, which was lost in the course of evolution toward more stable domains.
