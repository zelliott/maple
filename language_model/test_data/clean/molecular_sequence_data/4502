Recent findings have suggested that the vertebrate trp family of channel proteins is the structural basis for Ca2+ influx through the capacitative calcium entry (CCE) pathway. We have discerned, in bovine aortic endothelial cells, the concomitant expression of four such vertebrate genes: trp-1 (two splice variants), trp-3, trp-4 and trp-5. Exogenous hormones rendered dynamic effects on the transcript levels of these genes. Most notably, beta-estradiol significantly down-regulated trp-4 while trans-retinoic acid dramatically up-regulated trp-5; yet these hormones rendered little change in CCE. These findings suggest that the extent of a given trp channel's participation in CCE is not reflected in alterations of its transcript level.
