Cytochrome P-450AFB is major isozyme inducible by 3-methylcholanthrene in Syrian golden hamsters and shows high potency toward aflatoxin B1 activation. We have isolated and sequenced cDNA clones to P-450AFB by immunoscreening a hamster liver cDNA library in lambda gt11. The longest clone contains an open reading frame of 1482 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 494 amino acids with a molecular weight of 57,420. The sequence of P-450AFB shares a 73% and 65% homology with that of mouse P-450 15 alpha (IIA3) and rat P-450a (IIA1), respectively, indicating that P-450AFB is a unique gene of the P-450IIA subfamily. The apparent concentration of a mRNA species hybridizable to the clone as well as the concentration of a protein immunoreactive to P-450AFB was increased significantly by the treatment with 3-methyl-cholanthrene, which indicates that the increase in P-450AFB protein is due mainly to an elevation of the mRNA.
