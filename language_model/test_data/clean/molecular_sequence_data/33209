The morphology, infraciliature, and silverline system of a new marine scuticociliate, Wilbertia typica n. g., n. sp., collected from coastal waters off northern China, were investigated. The new genus Wilbertia is characterized as follows: sculptured and dorso-ventrally flattened body; dominant buccal field that is almost completely surrounded by the paroral membrane; three apically positioned long membranelles, arranged in parallel; membranelle (M)1 and M2 prominent, M3 small; reticulate silverline system. The type species W. typica n. sp. is defined by having a conspicuous anterior beak-like protrusion; five to eight caudal cilia; M1 four-rowed, M2 two-rowed; M3, single-rowed, bipartite; 15 or 16 somatic kineties; contractile vacuole positioned just posterior to the buccal field; globular macronucleus. The small subunit ribosomal DNA sequence of W. typica is 98.5% similar to the similar morphotype, Eurystomatella sinica. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that Wilbertia groups with Eurystomatella sinica forming a branch that diverges at a deep level from all other pleuronematid scuticociliates. The molecular and morphological data indicate that Wilbertia should be placed within the family Eurystomatidae, which is closely related to the well-known Cyclidiidae.
