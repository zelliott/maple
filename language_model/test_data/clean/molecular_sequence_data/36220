We have studied, by the polymerase chain reaction, the beta-galactosidase cDNA from several Italian patients with infantile GM1-gangliosidosis. One homozygote for a previously undiscovered G > A mutation at position 1479, causing an arginine to histidine change, was detected. The same mutation, in heterozygosis, was identified in 6 unrelated patients, but not in 100 normal chromosomes.
