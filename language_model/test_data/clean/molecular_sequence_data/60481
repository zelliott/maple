Roots of bluebell (Hyacinthoides nonscripta) were sampled from a woodland in Yorkshire, UK and spores of an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Scutellospora sp., were obtained from the surrounding soil. Partial small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA sequences were amplified from both roots and spores using either the universal forward primer SS38 or the Glomales-specific primer VANS1, with the reverse Gigasporaceae-specific primer VAGIGA. Amplified products were cloned and sequenced. Both spores and roots yielded sequences related to those known from fungi within the Glomales, with up to four distinct SSU sequences obtained from individual spores. The VANS1 primer-binding site varied considerably in sequence and only a subset of Scutellospora sequences were amplified when the VANS1 primer was used. In addition to glomalean sequences, a number of different sequences, apparently from ascomycetes, were obtained from both root and spore samples.
