In many neurons, transmitter release from presynaptic terminals is triggered by Ca2+ entry via dihydropyridine-insensitive Ca2+ channels. We have looked for cDNAs for such channels in the nervous system of the marine ray Discopyge ommata. One cDNA (doe-2) is similar to dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type channels, and two cDNAs (doe-1 and doe-4) are similar to the subfamily of dihydropyridine-insensitive non-L-type channels. doe-4, which encodes a protein of 2326 aa, most closely resembles a previously cloned N-type channel. doe-1, which encodes a protein of 2223 aa, is a member of a separate branch of the non-L-type channels. Northern blot analysis reveals that doe-1 is abundant in the forebrain. doe-4 is more plentiful in the electric lobe and, therefore, may control neurotransmitter release in motor nerve terminals. These results show that the familial pattern of Ca(2+)-channel genes has been preserved from a stage in evolution before the divergence of higher and lower vertebrates > 400 million years ago. The cloning of these channels may be a useful starting point for elucidating the role of the Ca2+ channels in excitation-secretion coupling in nerve terminals.
