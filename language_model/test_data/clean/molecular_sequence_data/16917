The group A Streptococcus (GAS) is an important pathogen that is responsible for a wide range of human diseases. Fibronectin binding proteins (FBPs) play an important role in promoting GAS adherence and invasion of host cells. The prtF2 gene encodes an FBP and is present in approximately 60% of GAS strains. In the present study we examined 51 prtF2-positive GAS strains isolated from the Northern Territory of Australia, and here we describe two genotypes of prtF2 which are mutually exclusive. The two genotypes have been identified previously as pfbp and fbaB. We show that these genotypes map to the same chromosomal location within the highly recombinatorial fibronectin-collagen-T antigen (FCT) locus, indicating that they arose from a common ancestor, and in this study these genotypes were designated the pfbp type and the fbaB type. Phylogenetic analysis of seven pfbp types, 14 fbaB types, and 11 prtF2-negative GAS strains by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) produced 32 distinct PFGE patterns. Interpretation of evolution based on the PFGE dendrogram by parsimony suggested that the pfbp type had a recent origin compared to the fbaB type. A comparison of multiple DNA sequences of the pfbp and fbaB types revealed a mosaic pattern for the amino-terminal region of the pfbp types. The fbaB type is generally conserved at the amino terminus but varies in the number of fibronectin binding repeats in the carboxy terminus. Our data also suggest that there is a possible association of the pfbp genotype with sof (84.2%), while the fbaB genotype was found in a majority of the GAS strains negative for sof (90.6%), indicating that these two prtF2 subtypes may be under different selective pressures.
