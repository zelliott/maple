The iron- and manganese-containing superoxide dismutases have very similar three-dimensional structures but can be distinguished by various biochemical means. The primary structures of six manganese-containing and three iron-containing superoxide dismutases are known. Analysis of the aligned amino acid sequences of these enzymes taken together with structural data from X-ray diffraction studies demonstrates that the two classes of enzyme can be distinguished on the basis of a small number of single-site substitutions that are positioned in and close to the active site of the enzyme.
