Complete nucleotide sequences except the poly (C) tract and poly (A) tail of a vaccine strain (IND 491/97) and an atypical field isolate (IND 321/01) of Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotype Asia1 are described. Amino acid (aa) sequence analysis of the VP1 protein of the field isolate revealed that the latter has 212 instead of 210 or 211 aa found in the so far available sequences of other FMDV isolates of Asia1 serotype. The insertion was localized in the hypervariable region of aa 130-160 of VP1 protein. Nucleotide sequencing of the entire genome was therefore carried out to detect changes in other parts of the genome, if any, besides VP1, which could contribute to its fitness. An 8.16 kb sequence of IND 491/97 and an 8.162 kb sequence of IND 321/01 were compared with each other and also with the known sequence of IND 63/72, another vaccine strain of serotype Asia1. Comparison of the entire polyprotein coding (L to 3D) region of IND 321/01 with those of the two Asia1 vaccine strains (IND 63/72 and IND 491/97) revealed no significant differences. A similar comparison of IND 491/97 with IND 63/72 revealed variability across the entire length of the genome. In addition to the capsid-coding region, sequence variability was also observed in non-structural proteins albeit to different extent. This study shows that in the gene pool of serotype Asia1 at least three groups of isolates/strains are present with respect to the length of VP1 protein.
