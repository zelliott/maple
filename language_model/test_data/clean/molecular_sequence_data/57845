We have characterized four sequences from a small library containing a subset of the repetitive families of the mouse. Each clone has a repetition frequency of less than 1,100 copies per genome and each clone represents a unique family of middle repetitive DNA. One clone (pMR111) shares homology with mouse intracisternal A-particle (IAP) elements, a second clone (pMR89) has partial homology with a sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the human fibulin gene, while two clones (pMR6, pMR66) are new that have no homology to any reported DNA sequence. Each clone hybridizes to one or two discrete RNA transcripts from one or more tissues of the mouse. Clone pMR66 detected restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) at three loci in genomic mouse DNA, defining loci at the distal end of chromosome 5 and the proximal end of chromosome 7. The third locus is unmapped. This study demonstrates that cloned repeats from a repetitive DNA library are a potential source of genetic markers.
