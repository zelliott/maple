Synaptotagmins are membrane proteins that possess tandem C2 domains and play an important role in regulated membrane fusion in metazoan organisms. Here we show that both synaptotagmins I and II, the two major neuronal isoforms, can interact with the syntaxin/synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) dimer, the immediate precursor of the soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) fusion complex. A stretch of basic amino acids highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom is responsible for this calcium-independent interaction. Inositol hexakisphosphate modulates synaptotagmin coupling to the syntaxin/SNAP-25 dimer, which is mirrored by changes in chromaffin cell exocytosis. Our results shed new light on the functional importance of the conserved polybasic synaptotagmin motif, suggesting that synaptotagmin interacts with the t-SNARE dimer to up-regulate the probability of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion.
