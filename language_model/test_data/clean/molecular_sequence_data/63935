The structure of the carbohydrate backbone of the lipid A-core region of the LPS from Shewanella algae strain BrY was analysed. The LPS was N,O-deacylated to give three products, which were isolated and studied by chemical methods, NMR and mass spectrometry: [Carbohydrate structures: see text]. All monosaccharides except L-rhamnose had the D-configuration. This LPS presents a second example (after S. oneidensis) of the structure with a novel linking unit between the core and lipid A moieties, 8-amino-3,8-dideoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (8-amino-Kdo).
