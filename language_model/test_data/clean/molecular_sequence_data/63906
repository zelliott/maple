Molecule possessing ankyrin-repeats induced by lipopolysaccharide (MAIL) is known as an IkappaB protein induced after administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mice. In the present study, we cloned bovine MAIL cDNA and examined its mRNA expression in white blood cells isolated from Holstein cows. Bovine MAIL had more than 80% amino acid identities with murine and human MAILs, highly conserved ankyrin-repeat motifs and PEST-like sequences. Bovine MAIL mRNA was undetectable in isolated peripheral white blood cells, but rapidly induced (<1h) after stimulation by LPS and lipid A in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. The lipid A-induced MAIL mRNA expression was found in polymorphonuclear cells, monocytes/macrophages and total lymphocytes, but not in T-lymphocytes. MAIL mRNA was also induced in vivo in peripheral blood leukocytes of cows after intramammary injection of Escherichia coli derived from coliform mastitis. Thus, bovine MAIL, as rodent MAILs, is induced by inflammatory stimuli in specific immune cells in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a role in inflammatory responses to bacterial infection in cattle.
