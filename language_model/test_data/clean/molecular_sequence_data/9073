The Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota used in this study has in the genome four putative thioredoxin genes designated trxA1, trxA2, trxA3 and trxA4, and one putative thioredoxin reductase gene designated trxB. To elucidate the roles of the thioredoxins and the thioredoxin reductase against oxidative stress in L. casei, we constructed gene disruption mutants, in which each of the genes trxA1, trxA2 and trxB, or both trxA1 and trxA2 were disrupted, and we characterized their growth and response to oxidative stresses. In aerobic conditions, the trxA1 (MS108) and the trxA2 (MS109) mutants had moderate growth defects, and the trxA1 trxA2 double mutant (MS110) had a severe growth defect, which was characterized by elongation of doubling time and a lower final turbidity level. Furthermore, the trxB mutant (MS111), which is defective in thioredoxin reductase, lost the ability to grow under aerobic conditions, although it grew partially under anaerobic conditions. The growth of these mutants, however, could be substantially restored by the addition of dithiothreitol or reduced glutathione. In addition, MS110 and MS111 were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and disulfide stress than the wild-type. In particular, the stress sensitivity of MS111 was significantly increased. On the other hand, transcription of all these genes was only weakly affected by these oxidative stresses. Taken together, these results suggest that the thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase system is the major thiol/disulfide redox system and is essential to allow the facultative anaerobe L. casei to grow under aerobic conditions.
