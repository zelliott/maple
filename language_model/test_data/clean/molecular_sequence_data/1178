Aedes aegypti is a highly anthropophilic mosquito responsible for the transmission of dengue and yellow fever around the world. Like other mosquitoes, the biting and host preference behaviors of this disease vector are largely influenced by its sense of smell, which is presumably facilitated by G protein-coupled receptor signaling cascades. Here, we report the identification and characterization of AaOr7, the first candidate odorant receptor from Ae. aegypti. This receptor displays extremely high primary amino acid conservation with AgOr7 another candidate odorant receptor identified in the Aftrotropical malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae as well as several previously identified candidate odorant receptors in Drosophila melanogaster and other insects. Its transcript is expressed in adult chemosensory tissues and during several stages of Ae. aegypti development. Within the adult olfactory system, AaOr7 protein is found specifically within most antennal and maxillary palp sensilla, as well as in a subset of proboscis sensilla. These results are consistent with a role for AaOr7 in olfaction and gustation supporting the hypothesis that AaOr7 and its orthologs may be of general importance to chemosensory processes throughout the lifetime of an insect.
