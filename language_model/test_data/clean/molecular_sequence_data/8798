We have investigated the molecular basis for binding and Ag presentation of an immunodominant Th cell determinant of sperm whale myoglobin, a prototype amphipathic helical structure in the native protein. A series of peptides with three different substitutions at each position were evaluated for binding to the class II MHC molecule I-Ad and for activation of two T cell clones with distinct fine specificity, to determine the role of each residue. The assignment of MHC binding and TCR binding residues is consistent with a peptide bound as a twisted beta-strand, with 130 degrees twist similar to that of the influenza hemagglutinin peptide crystallized in the groove of HLA-DR1. This twist gives the peptide amphipathicity, with a periodicity similar to an alpha-helix without its being a helix. Two substituted peptides were discovered to be heteroclitic, but by different molecular mechanisms, one involving gain of a favorable residue and one involving loss of an unfavorable one. Complexes of both peptides with I-Ad had enormously higher affinity for the TCR, but peptide affinity for the MHC molecule was not increased, such that the wild-type peptide acted as a partial agonist and inhibited the response to the heteroclitic ones. Moreover, the magnitude of response was elevated in a way that could not be mimicked by the wild-type peptide even at higher concentration. These results suggest a TCR dwell time requirement for optimal signal transduction that may help explain the mechanism of partial agonism.
