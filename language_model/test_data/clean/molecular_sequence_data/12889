Influenza NS2 protein was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a copper-inducible promoter. The protein produced had a molecular weight of 13 kDa, was reactive with anti-NS2 antiserum and was localised to the yeast cell nucleus. Two-hybrid analysis identified a direct protein-protein interaction between NS2 and the M2 protein of the virus, involving the C-terminal 163 residues of M1. A filter-binding assay localised the M1 binding region to the C-terminal 70 amino acids of NS2.
