Beet western yellows virus relies on the aphid M. persicae for its transmission in a persistent and circulative mode. To be transmitted, the virus must cross the midgut and the accessory salivary gland epithelial barriers by a transcytosis mechanism where vector receptors interact with virions. The aphid and the peptidic viral determinants implicated in this interaction mechanism have been studied. In this paper, we report that the coat and the readthrough proteins that constitute the capsid of this virus are glycosylated. Modification of the glucidic core of these structural viral proteins by oxidation with sodium metaperiodate or deglycosylation with N-glycosidase F or alpha-D-galactosidase abrogates the aphid transmission of the virus. Aphid transmission could also be inhibited by lectins directed against alpha-D-galactose when aphids were allowed to acquire virus on artificial membranes. These results suggest that the glucidic cores of the capsid proteins of beet western yellows virus contain alpha-D-galactose residues that are implicated in virus-aphid interaction and promote aphid transmission of the virus.
