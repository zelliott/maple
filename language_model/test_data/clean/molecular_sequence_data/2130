DNA fragments containing the regulatory regions of two genes repressed by the tyrR gene product exhibit retarded electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide gels indicating the presence of static bends in the DNA. In the aroF gene this bend has been localized to a region containing two TyrR protein-binding sites. A point mutation between these two sites reduced the degree of bending observed but did not reduce the level of repression, indicating the static bend may not be an important component of the repression mechanism.
