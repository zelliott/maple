Ten oligomannose-type sugar chains (ManGlcNAc2-Man5GlcNAc2) were prepared from various glycoproteins and fluorescence labeled with 2-aminopyridine. The fluorescent pyridylamino (PA)-sugar chains were first separated into five fractions according to their molecular sizes by HPLC on a TSK gel Amide-80 column. Each fraction was then separated into the component PA-sugar chains by reversed-phase HPLC on a Capcell Pak C18 column according to their chemical structures. The method is useful for studying the substrate specificities of alpha-mannosidases with Man5GlcNAc2-PA as a substrate.
