The secondary structure of bacteriorhodopsin (bacR) is predicted using the Chou and Fasman method in conjunction with the hydropathic index of Kyte and Doolittle. The predicted bacR structure was compared with the structure determined by Henderson et al. (1990) using electron diffraction and was found to correlate extremely well. The secondary structure of bovine rhodopsin (bovR) was then predicted using the same techniques. The proposed transmembrane regions of bovR were then examined and found to have sequence similarity with those transmembrane regions of bacR.
