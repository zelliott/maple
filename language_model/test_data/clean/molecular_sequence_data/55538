Mycobacterium massiliense is a rapidly growing mycobacterial species. The pathogenicity of this subspecies is not well known. We report here the annotated genome sequence of M. massiliense strain M18, which was isolated from a lymph node biopsy specimen from a Malaysian patient suspected of having tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis.
