Cloning and nucleotide sequence determination of the aadB gene and boundary DNA fragments from a high molecular weight plasmid of Salmonella oranienburg were performed. The data on the restriction mapping showed that the aadB gene was located within the integrone. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the cloned fragment revealed a high level conservative nature of the aadB gene and boundary DNA areas.
