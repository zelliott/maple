We have identified two encoded proteins with an antiserum raised against a synthetic oligopeptide corresponding to amino acids 671 to 684 of the predicted protein product of gene UL47 of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). They have apparent Mrs of 82,000 and 81,000 and are both major virion components located in the tegument. The 82/81K proteins were first detected in infected cells in minor amounts 6 h after infection at 37 degrees C but were later (from 10 h until 24 h after infection) present in large amounts. UL47 regulation was investigated using phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), an inhibitor of DNA synthesis: the amounts of the 82/81K protein synthesized were compared with those of 65KDBP, an early gene product, and 21K/22K, a true late gene product. The data showed that UL47 is regulated as a true late gene.
