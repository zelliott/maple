From the aerial parts of Marrubium alysson a new phenylpropanoid glycoside, alyssonoside, and five known glycosides, verbascoside (= acteoside), leucosceptoside A, martynoside, forsythoside B and leucosceptoside B were isolated. On the basis of spectral data, the structure of the new compound was elucidated as beta-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethyl-O-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->3)]-O- [beta-D-apiopyranosyl-(1-->6)]-4-O-feruloyl-beta-D-glucopyra noside.
