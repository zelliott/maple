Mycobacterium genavense species-specific DNA was detected in intestinal tissues from two of nine individuals not infected with human immunodeficiency virus. This newly described microorganism is well documented as a causative agent of disseminated infections in AIDS patients. Our results suggest that it may colonize the guts of individuals not infected with human immunodeficiency virus.
