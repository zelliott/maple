The principal neutralizing domain, IGPGRAF sequence, from the V3-loop of HIV-1 was inserted in two positions on the surface of the protein that makes up the capside shell of the insect Flock House Virus. The hybrid proteins were expressed in insect cells via recombinant baculoviruses. Three different hybrids were used as immunogens: two with a single copy of the insert in different positions of the carrier protein and a third with two copies of the insert at the same positions as before. All hybrid proteins induced strong and broad specific immune response in guinea pigs against different V3-loop sequences. However, only one of the hybrid proteins was able to induce a strong neutralizing response against MN and IIIB HIV-1 isolates. Our results demonstrate that a very short peptide sequence of HIV-1 can constitute a valuable immunogen able to induce a neutralizing response if presented to the immune system in the context of the FHV capsomer structure.
