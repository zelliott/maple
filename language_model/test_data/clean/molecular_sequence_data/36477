The theoretical treatment of the process of washing out of a single stranded DNA fragment after hybridization with short oligonucleotides immobilized within the polyacrylamide gel layer is presented. The theory describes satisfactorily the main body of experimental findings, obtained earlier in connection with the elaboration of a new DNA sequencing method based on hybridization with the matrix of immobilized oligonucleotides [K.R. Khrapko et al.@J. DNA Sequencing Mapp. 1991. V. 1. P. 373-388]. In particular the theory explains and describes well quantitatively the observed dependence of the "washing off temperature" Tw on the concentration of the immobilized oligonucleotides. The Tw dependence on inherent physico-chemical parameters such as the enthalpy and the entropy of duplex formation and on those selected by the experimenter (washing time duration, the gel thickness etc.) is also considered. A simple approximate expression for the calculation of "washing off temperature" is given. Some inconsistencies between calculated and observed washing curves are discussed.
