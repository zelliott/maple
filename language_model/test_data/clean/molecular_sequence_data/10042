Rat ovarian genes induced by the treatment of immature rats with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) were isolated by a subtraction cloning method. Amongst them was obtained a probable rat homologue of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), which has been recently identified as a protein that is an acute regulator of the rate limiting transfer of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Structure of rat StAR was determined by nucleotide sequence analysis. Northern blot analysis revealed that StAR mRNA levels were rapidly and strongly increased by PMSG/hCG but not by FSH. In situ hybridization revealed that the expression of StAR mRNA was strongly induced by PMSG in theca interna cells as well as in corpora lutea. These findings indicate that expression of StAR mRNA is restricted to and induced in the ovarian steroidogenic cell types where cholesterol is used as a substrate for synthesis of steroid hormones.
