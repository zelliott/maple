Crystal formation by monoclonal immunoglobulins is a well-known but rare complication of B-cell neoplasia. We have designed an in vivo model of cryocrystalglobulinemia by grafting to mice hybridoma clones producing a pathogenic monoclonal immunogloblulin (Ig) G3kappa. One clone, 8A4, secreted a singular IgG3 that formed crystals both in the proliferating plasma cells and as mesangial and subendothelial deposits in the kidney glomeruli. Morphologic analysis of kidneys revealed neutrophil infiltration and endocapillary hyperplasia, while the morphology of deposits was reminiscent of those in cryocrystalglobulinemia patients. A variant clone that only differed from 8A4 by a 3-amino acid deletion in the V(kappa) CDR1 increased its secretion level by 7-fold and produced an abundant bona fide serum monoclonal cryoglobulin in mice, without crystal formation within tumoral cells; it yielded no subendothelial deposits but only amorphous precipitates in capillary lumens of kidney glomeruli, reminiscent of those seen in the human hyperviscosity syndrome, without other glomerular lesions. A limited variation in the V(kappa) domain thus proved able to increase secretion, to abrogate crystallization, and to modify patterns of glomerular lesions and deposits. Both the crystallizing and noncrystallizing IgG3kappa sequences were related to previously reported murine cryoglobulins, all including a gamma3 chain and canonical VH sequences. Two additional variants of 8A4 with identical VH and VL domains but having switched to IgG1 also lost crystal formation, further showing this feature of 8A4 to result from a unique 3-dimensional conformation of the complete immunoglobulin, relying on V and C domain primary structures of both chains.
