The pathogenesis of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) remains largely unknown since no specific genetic lesion has been identified in this disease. Previous cytogenetic analysis from our group has shown that chromosome abnormalities involving the 5q13 band are common in HCL, occurring in approximately 1/3 of patients. The data suggest that the 5q13.3 band is likely to harbor a gene involved in the transformational events of this disease. We have recently found two cosmids flanking the 5q13.3 breakpoint in patients with HCL, and the distance between them is approximately 35 kb, as analyzed by fiber-FISH. The two cosmids have been located between the markers SGC34998 and WI-15505/WI-6897 by radiation hybrid mapping. Five of 11 patients with HCL had a hemizygous deletion of the two cosmids, indicating that the function of a tumor suppressor gene may be lost. With the aim of delineating the critical region of 5q13.3 loss in patients with HCL, we have constructed an integrated contig of YAC, BAC, PAC, P1, and cosmid clones that covers the region. Within this area, three expressed sequences were identified as candidates for the putative 5q13.3 tumor suppressor gene involved in the pathogenesis of HCL.
