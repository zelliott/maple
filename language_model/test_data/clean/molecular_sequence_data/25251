In the ciliated protozoan, Tetrahymena pyriformis, the mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA (LSU rRNA) is discontinuous, consisting of two discrete RNA species: a 280-nucleotide LSU alpha (constituting the 5'-portion) and a 2315-nucleotide LSU beta (corresponding to the remaining 3'-portion of this rRNA). The T. pyriformis mitochondrial genome contains two copies of the LSU alpha.beta gene complex, and we have previously provided evidence that both copies are transcribed (Heinonen, T. Y. K., Schnare, M. N., Young, P. G., and Gray, M. W. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 2879-2887). We now report the complete sequences of the two copies of the LSU alpha.beta gene complex. These are not identical, but differ at 5 out of the 2595 positions by single nucleotide substitutions in one sequence relative to the other. In the secondary structure model we propose here, two of these differences are located in base-paired regions of the LSU rRNA; however, they do not interrupt the complementary interactions in these helices. The other three differences occur in single-stranded regions of the secondary structure. The base substitutions documented here are not localized to those regions of LSU rRNA that are the most highly conserved in global phylogenetic comparisons, and therefore it seems unlikely that they are of fundamental functional significance. Whether they might exert more subtle effects on ribosome function remains to be determined.
