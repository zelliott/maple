We have isolated the full-length coding sequence for mouse KIFC5A (kinesin family c-terminal 5A) cDNA, encoding a motor protein found in the testes. The complete sequence of the KIFC5A cDNA is homologous to a group of carboxyl-terminal motors, including hamster CHO2, human HSET, and mouse KIFC1 and KIFC4. The KIFC5A and KIFC1 cDNAs are nearly identical except for the presence of two additional sequence blocks in the 5'-end of KIFC5A and a number of single base-pair differences in their motor domains. Polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of the 5'-end of KIFC5A identified 3 distinct RNA species in testes and other tissues. Sequence comparison and genetic mapping confirmed the existence of a small multi-gene family in the mouse and suggest possible mechanisms of alternative splicing, genetic duplication, and separate genetic loci in the generation of these motors. In order to examine the possible role of these motors in germ cells of the testes, an antibody to a shared epitope was used to localize this group of proteins to different spermatogenic cell types. These experiments suggest that KIFC5-like motor proteins are associated with multiple microtubule complexes in male germ cells, including the meiotic spindle, the manchette, and the flagella.
