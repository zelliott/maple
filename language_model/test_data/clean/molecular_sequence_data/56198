Analysis of the nucleotide sequence in the 5' flanking region of bacteriophage T4 gene 25 revealed three potential Shine and Dalgarno sequences, SD1, SD2 and SD3, with a spacing of 8, 17 and 27 nucleotides from the initiation codon of this gene, respectively. Results of our experiments in the bacteriophage T7 expression system clearly demonstrate that the SD3 sequence is required for efficient expression of gene 25. We propose the existence of a stem-loop structure that includes SD1 and SD2 sequences and brings the SD3 sequence to a favourable spacing with the initiation codon of gene 25. Since the predicted secondary structure in the translational initiation region of gene 25 is relatively unstable and the SD3 sequence, GAGG, is more typical than the SD1 sequence, GAG, we suggest that this structure could control the level of gene expression.
