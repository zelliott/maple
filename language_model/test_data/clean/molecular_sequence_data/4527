In the framework of the complete genome sequencing programme of the crucifer Arabidopsis thaliana, a 23.9-kb fragment from the long arm of chromosome IV has been analysed. This paper presents a methodological approach, integrating computerized predictions, database screening, the sequencing of cognate cDNAs and a PCR-based detection of expression that allows the accumulation of an important amount of information from an anonymous sequence. This work revealed the organization of novel genes and the vestige of a copia-like retrotransposon. The gene AtRH1 encodes the first member of a new subfamily of the plant DEAD box RNA helicases. A recurrent and complete search of dbEST has been used to evaluate the number of different RNA helicases expressed in A. thaliana. On the 18 discriminated members of the family, only a small number seems to be expressed at a relatively high level. The putative gene AtTS1 encodes a novel terpene synthase in A. thaliana, and the genes G14587-5 and G14587-6 encode unknown proteins. This study illustrates most of the situations that could be encountered during the analysis of an anonymous sequence from A. thaliana.
