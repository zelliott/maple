The proto-oncogene c-fos is important in cell growth, differentiation and development. Several promoter elements have been identified as mediators for the induction of c-fos by serum, tumor promoting agents, epidermal growth factor and other stimuli. Stressors, including heat shock, arsenite and cadmium can induce c-fos transcription, but a heat shock element in the c-fos promoter has not been described. In this report we show that the induction of c-fos by heat shock, arsenite and cadmium can be mediated by the serum response element. Furthermore we show that casein kinase II, which has been proposed to be involved in serum induction via the serum response element, may also be involved in heat shock, arsenite and cadmium induction of c-fos.
