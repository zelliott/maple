Monoclonal antibodies (TB1 & TB2), which were obtained by immunization of 24 amino acids in BALB/c mice, bound specifically to the amyloid senile plaque and amyloid-angiopathic lesions of brain tissues of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or with senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT), and strongly reacted with the 1st part (Asp-Ala-Glu-Phe-Arg-His-Asp) of beta-protein. Western blotting and two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum revealed bands of 125 and 20 kilodaltons. The positive frequency of 125 and 20 KD bands detected by two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis was higher in the serum of AD and SDAT patients (12 cases) than in that of normal control patients. ELISA employing various anti-amyloid precursor protein (APP) antibodies was performed using the extract of the human neuroblastoma cell line (NB39) which produces APP. In the near future, we hope to measure APP in CSF and sera from patients with Alzheimer's disease.
