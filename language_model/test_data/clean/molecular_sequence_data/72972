Pathogenesis-related expression of the two antifungal hydrolases beta-1,3-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.39) and chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14) was studied in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as part of the defence response to stem rust (Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici, Pgt), mediated by the semi-dominantly acting resistance genes Sr5 and Sr24. Complete resistance (infection type 0), mediated by the Sr5 gene in cultivar Pre-Sr5, closely correlates with the hypersensitive response of penetrated cells at early stage of the interaction, when the first haustorium is formed. In contrast, cultivar Pre-Sr24 shows intermediate resistance (infection type 2-3) which is not directly linked to cell death. In both cases, the plant response included a rapid increase in beta-1,3-glucanase activity between 24 and 48 h after inoculation. One main extracellular 30-kDa isform of beta-1,3-glucanase was present in both lines, as shown by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Two additional minor isoforms (32 and 23 kDa) were detected only in Pre-Sr24, and only at later time points. Increased enzme activity and the appearance of new isoforms in the resistance lines was preceded by accumulation of mRNAs encoding beta-1,3-glucanase and chitinases. However, there were no changes in chitinase activity or isoforms. A high constitutive level of chitinase activity was observed in all wheat genotypes. Serological studies indicated the presence of a class II chitinase of 26 kDa. Accumulation of beta-1,3-glucanase and chitinase transcripts was detected before the pathogen penetrated the leaves through stomata and approximately 16 h before the typical hypersensitive response was observed, indicating that signal(s) for defense gene activation were recognised by the host plant long before a tight contact between the pathogen and a host cell is established. A glycoprotein (Pgt elicitor) derived from hyphal walls, strongly induced beta-1,3-glucanase. We discuss the possible role of the elicitor in the early signalling mediating Sr5- and Sr24-specified resistance in wheat.
