Production of the novel bacteriocin streptococcin A-M57 (SA-M57) by Streptococcus pyogenes strains of M-protein type 57 is plasmid-associated. Plasmid pDN571 (3351bp) harbored by S. pyogenes 71-724, the prototype M-type 57 strain, has been completely sequenced and contains three putative open reading frames (repA, scnM57 and ORF3). In addition, the double-strand and single-strand (SSO) origins of replication were identified. Analysis of the replication-associated genetic elements places pDN571 in the ubiquitous pC194/pUB110 family of rolling-circle plasmids. The SSO of pDN571 is of the ssoA type. SA-M57 (encoded by scnM57) is synthesized as a secreted 179-amino acid polypeptide with a 27-residue secretion signal peptide and has no homology to proteins of known function.
