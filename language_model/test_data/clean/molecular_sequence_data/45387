Complete DNA sequences have been determined for the mitochondrial genomes of the crinoids Phanogenia gracilis (15892 bp) and Gymnocrinus richeri (15966 bp). The mitochondrial genetic map of the stalkless feather star P. gracilis is identical to that of the comatulid feather star Florometra serratissima (Scouras, A., Smith, M.J., 2001. Mol. Biol. Evol. 18, 61-73). The mitochondrial gene order of the stalked crinoid G. richeri differs from that of F. serratissima and P. gracilis by the transposition of the nad4L protein gene. The G. richeri nad4L mitochondrial map position is unique among metazoa and is likely a derived feature in this stalked crinoid. Nucleotide compositional analyses of protein genes encoded on the major sense strand confirm earlier conclusions regarding a crinoid-distinctive T over C bias. All three crinoids exhibit high T levels in third codon positions, whereas other echinoderm classes favor A or C in the third codon position. The nucleotide bias is reflected in the relative synonymous codon usage patterns of crinoids versus other echinoderms. We suggest that the nucleotide bias of crinoids, in comparison to other echinoderms, indicates that a physical inversion of the origin of replication has occurred in the crinoid lineage. Evolutionary rate tests support the use of the cytochrome b (cob) gene in molecular phylogenetic analyses of echinoderms. A consensus echinoderm tree was generated based on cytochrome b nucleotide alignments that placed the asteroids as a sister group to a clade containing the ophiuroids and the (echinoids+holothuroids) with the crinoids basal to the rest of the echinoderm classes: [Crinoid,(Asteroid,(Ophiuroid,(Echinoid,Holothuroid)))].
