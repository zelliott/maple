Two indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi from the Mediterranean wine growing area in the Northeast of Spain were isolated and classified as Glomus intraradices Schenck & Smith. Both native fungi were found to increase the growth of the vine rootstock 110 Richter under greenhouse conditions compared with G. intraradices (BEG 72) and a phosphorus (P) fertilization treatment. The effectivity of field inoculation of Cabernet Sauvignon plants grafted on Richter 110 with the former native fungi and with G. intraradices BEG 72 in a replant vineyard severely infested by the root-rot fungus Armillaria mellea (Vahl ex Fr.) Kummer was assessed. The native fungi were not effective at enhancing plant development, and only G. intraradices BEG 72, resulted in a positive response. Field inoculation with this selected fungus increased plant shoot dry weight at the end of the first growing season.
