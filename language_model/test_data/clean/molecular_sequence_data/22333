The enzyme alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase (alpha1,3-GT), which catalyzes synthesis of terminal alpha-galactosyl epitopes (Gal alpha1,3Gal beta1-4GlcNAc-R), is produced in non-primate mammals, prosimians and new-world monkeys, but not in old-world monkeys, apes and humans. We cloned and sequenced a cDNA that contains the coding sequence of the feline alpha1,3-GT gene. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that the alpha-galactosyl epitope was expressed on the surface of a human cell line transduced with an expression vector containing this cDNA, and this alpha-galactosyl epitope expression subsided by alpha-galactosidase treatment. The open reading frame of the feline alpha1,3-GT cDNA is 1,113 base pairs in length and encodes 371 amino acids. The nucleotide sequence and its deduced amino acid sequence of the feline alpha1,3-GT gene are 88-90% and 85-87%, respectively, similar to the reported sequences of the bovine, porcine, marmoset and cebus monkey alpha1,3-GT genes, while they are 88% and 82-83%, respectively, similar to those of the orangutan and human alpha1,3-GT pseudogenes, and 81% and 77%, respectively, similar to the murine alpha1,3-GT gene. Thus, the alpha1,3-GT genes and pseudogenes of mammals are highly similar. Ratios of non-synonymous nucleotide changes among the primate pseudogenes as well as the primate genes are still higher than the ratios of non-primates, suggesting that the primate alpha1,3-GT genes tend to be divergent.
