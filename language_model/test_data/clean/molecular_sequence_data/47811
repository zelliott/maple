The MHC of the urodele amphibian Ambystoma mexicanum consists of multiple polymorphic class I loci linked, so far as yet known, to a single class II B locus. This architecture is very different from that of the anuran amphibian Xenopus. The number of class I loci in the axolotl can vary from 6 to 21 according to the haplotypes as shown by cDNA analysis and Southern blot studies in families. These loci can be classified into seven sequence groups with features ranging from the class Ia to the class Ib type. All individuals express genes from at least three of the seven groups, and all individuals possess the class Ia-like type.
