We have purified a 14 kDa fragment of the 30 kDa binding protein for insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) from BRL-3A cell conditioned medium. The fragment binds IGF-I and IGF-II with similar specificity to the 30 kDa binding protein, but with lower affinity. It corresponds to the carboxy terminus of the native binding protein (residues 148-270), and is thought to arise by proteolysis. We infer that this region of the native binding protein contains, at least in part, the IGF binding domain.
