Phenoloxidases (POs) and haemocyanins constitute a family of copper-containing proteins widely distributed among invertebrates. Both of them are able, under appropriate conditions, to convert polyphenols to quinones and induce cytotoxicity through the production of reactive oxygen species, a fundamental event in many immune responses. In ascidians, PO activity has been described and studied in both solitary and colonial species and the enzyme is involved in inflammatory and cytotoxic reactions against foreign cells or molecules, and in the formation of the cytotoxic foci which characterise the nonfusion reaction of botryllids. Expressed genes for two putative POs (CiPO1 and CiPO2) have been recently identified in C. intestinalis. In the present study, we determined the cDNA sequences of two haemocyanin-like proteins from two colonial ascidians: Botryllus schlosseri from the Mediterranean Sea and Polyandrocarpa misakiensis from Japan. Multiple sequence alignments evidenced the similarity between the above sequences and crustacean proPOs whereas the analysis of the three-dimensional structure reveals high similarity with arthropod haemocyanins which share common precursors with arthropod proPOs. Botryllus HLP grouped in the same cluster with Ciona POs, whereas Polyandrocarpa HLP clustered with arthropod haemocyanins; all of them share the full conservation of the six histidines at the two copper-binding sites as well as of other motifs, also found in arthropod haemocyanin subunits, involved in the regulation of enzyme activity. In situ hybridisation indicated that the genes are transcribed inside morula cells, a characteristic haemocyte type in ascidians where PO activity is located, at the beginning of their differentiation. These results represent a first attempt to identify candidate molecules responsible of the PO activity in compound ascidians.
