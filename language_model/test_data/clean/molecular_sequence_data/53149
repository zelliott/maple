Four novel anti-HIV macrocyclic peptides containing 28-31 amino acid residues, named cycloviolins A-D, have been isolated from the hitherto unstudied tropical plant Leonia cymosa. Their primary structure, including amino acid composition and sequence, was determined by a combination of MALDI-TOF and FAB MS and by enzymatic digestion of reduced derivatives, followed by Edman degradation and mass analyses. All of the cycloviolins contain six cysteines, which are present as three intramolecular disulfide bridges. Intriguingly, cycloviolins A-D showed high degrees of sequence homology to the known cyclopsychotride A and circulins A and B from the Rubiaceae family but much less homology to the varv peptides from Viola, a member of the same family (Violaceae).
