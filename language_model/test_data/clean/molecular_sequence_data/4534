We report the isolation and characterization of a cDNA-clone for gamma-tubulin from N. crassa. The deduced amino-acid sequence of the cDNA-clone most resembles that of gamma-tubulins from other fungi. Differential Southern blot analysis demonstrates that most probably a single gene represents gamma-tubulin. In addition, Northern blot analysis shows that most probably only one single mRNA encoding gamma-tubulin is transcribed in N. crassa. In a phylogenetic tree that includes all known gamma-tubulins, N. crassa gamma-tubulin is grouped, as expected, together with other fungal gamma-tubulins.
