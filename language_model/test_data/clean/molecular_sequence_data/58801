Light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein (LHCP) can be reconstituted with pigments in detergent solution to yield stable monomeric light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b complex (LHCII). This reconstitution is not significantly affected when up to ten amino acids are deleted on the C-terminus of LHCP or when a tryptophan, which is 11 positions from the C terminus (W222), is exchanged with other amino acids [Paulsen, H. & Kuttkat, A. (1993) Photochem. Photobiol. 57, 139-142]. Here we show that the exchange of W222 with histidine or glycine completely abolishes the ability of the protein to assemble into trimeric LHCII, either upon reconstitution of monomeric complexes in detergent solution or upon insertion into isolated thylakoids. It is concluded that part of the hydrophilic domain on the C-terminus of LHCP, although not essential for the formation of stable monomeric LHCII, is involved in trimer formation. The different degree to which various amino acids in place of W222 affect trainer formation suggests that a hydrophobic amino acid is needed in this position.
