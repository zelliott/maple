We isolated and characterized the tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) HSP70 gene, highly homologous to other HSP70 genes. A dramatic increase of tilapia HSP70 mRNA levels was observed after heat shock of whole animals in all organs tested. Reporter constructs were tested for transient expression in carp cells and in microinjected zebrafish embryos. The entire isolated regulatory region (-851/+157) was able to mediate heat shock inducible expression of the reporter gene, with no preference for a particular tissue. Our studies represent the first transcriptional analysis of a HSP70 promoter from fish, revealing a powerful tool to direct controlled, tissue-independent gene expression in fish.
