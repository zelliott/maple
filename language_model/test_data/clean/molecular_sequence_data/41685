The FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs) are known both as the receptors for immunosuppressant drugs and as prolyl isomerase (PPIase) enzymes that catalyse rotation of prolyl bonds. FKBPs are characterised by the inclusion of at least one FK506-binding domain (FKBd), the receptor site for proline and the active site for PPIase catalysis. The FKBPs form large and diverse families in most organisms, with the largest FKBP families occurring in higher plants. Plant FKBPs are molecular chaperones that interact with specific protein partners to regulate a diversity of cellular processes. Recent studies have found that plant FKBPs operate in intricate and coordinated mechanisms for regulating stress response and development processes, and discoveries of new interaction partners expand their cellular influences to gene expression and photosynthetic adaptations. This review presents an examination of the molecular and structural features and functional roles of the higher plant FKBP family within the context of these recent findings, and discusses the significance of domain conservation and variation for the development of a diverse, versatile and complex chaperone family.
