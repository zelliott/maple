The ability of lectins to interact with Yersinia pestis strains isolated from rodent fleas and human biological fluids, obtained from different geographic areas, was examined. Lectins of Canavalia ensiformis, Ulex europaeus, Phaseolus vulgaris, and Triticum vulgaris, as well as a new autochthonous lectin of Swartzia pickellii of undefined specificity, were used. Most of the Y. pestis strains did not agglutinate with U. europaeus or C. ensiformis lectin. However, P. vulgaris lectin agglutinated suspensions of all the bacillus strains used. Fifteen of the 19 strains tested positive for assays using S. pickellii lectin. It is believed this is the first report of Y. pestis strain agglutination by lectins. A similar agglutination pattern was obtained for lectins with specificity for oligosaccharides containing N-acetylglucosamine and S. pickellii lectin, which did bind to the affinity matrix chitin, a polysaccharide of N-acetylglucosamine. The use of bacterial strains and commercial lectins of defined specificity may be an approach to providing evidence about the lectin binding sites of undefined monosaccharide specificity.
