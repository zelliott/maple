The proteolytic system of lactic acid bacteria is of eminent importance for the rapid growth of these organisms in protein-rich media. The combined action of proteinases and peptidases provides the cell with small peptides and essential amino acids. The amino acids and peptides thus liberated have to be translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane. To that purpose, the cell contains specific transport proteins. The internalized peptides are further degraded to amino acids by intracellular peptidases. The world-wide economic importance of the lactic acid bacteria and their proteolytic system has led to an intensive research effort in this area and a considerable amount of biochemical data has been collected during the last two decades. Since the development of systems to genetically manipulate lactic acid bacteria, data on the genetics of enzymes and processes involved in proteolysis are rapidly being generated. In this review an overview of the latest genetic data on the proteolytic system of lactic acid bacteria will be presented. As most of the work in this field has been done with lactococci, the emphasis will, inevitably, be on this group of organisms. Where possible, links will be made with other species of lactic acid bacteria.
