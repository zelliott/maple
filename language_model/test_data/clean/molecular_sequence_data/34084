The heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a family of proteins whose expression is enhanced in response to environmental stressors. The Apostichopus japonicus hsp90 and hsp26 genes were cloned using expressed sequence tag and rapid amplification of cDNA ends techniques. The full-length cDNA of Aphsp90 and Aphsp26 contains 3,458 and 1,688 nucleotides encoding 720 and 236 amino acids, respectively. Multiple alignments indicated that the deduced amino acid sequences of ApHsp90 and ApHsp26 shared a high level of identity with Hsp90 and small SHPs (sHSPs) sequences of zebrafish, ant, acorn worms, etc., and shared identical structural features with Hsp90 and sHSPs. The expression profiles of these two genes under heat treatment were investigated by real-time quantitative PCR. It was found that the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts of the two A. japonicus genes varied among different tissues under normal conditions and heat shock, and that the mRNA expression of the two genes was higher in the intestine compared to other tissues. Heat shock significantly elevated the expression of Aphsp90 and Aphsp26 mRNA in a temperature- and time-dependent manner. The results indicate that Aphsp90 and Aphsp26 played important roles in mediating the environmental stress in A. japonicus.
