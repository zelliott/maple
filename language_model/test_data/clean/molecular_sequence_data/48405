We determined the complete genome sequence of the passion fruit woodiness virus Gld-1 isolate (PWV-Gld-1) from Australia and compared it with that of PWV-MU-2, another Australian isolate of PWV. The genomes shared high sequence identity in both the complete nucleotide sequence and the ORF amino acid sequence. All of the cleavage sites of each protein were identical to those of MU-2, and the sequence identity for the individual proteins ranged from 97.2 % to 100.0 %. However, the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the Gld-1 isolate shared only 46.8 % sequence identity with that of PWV-MU-2 and was 177 nucleotides shorter. Re-sequencing of the 5'UTR of MU-2 revealed that the 5' end of the original sequence includes an artifact generated by deep sequencing.
