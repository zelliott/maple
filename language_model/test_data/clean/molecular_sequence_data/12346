To investigate cagA, which is linked to vacuolating cytotoxin activity of Helicobacter pylori, using molecular techniques.

A polymerase chain reaction method was used to detect cagA from clinical isolates of H. pylori. H. pylori strain diversity was examined by DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns with cagA as a probe.

The detection rate of the cagA products was significantly higher in strains from gastric ulcer patients than in those of chronic gastritis patients (78.9 versus 56.0%; P < 0.05), and RFLP patterns were different between gastric ulcer and gastric cancer strains.

A polymerase chain reaction method established for the detection of cagA proved to be rapid and useful. Analysis of cagA may therefore be a useful genetic technique for the study of strain diversity.
