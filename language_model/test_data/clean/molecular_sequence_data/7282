The cause of multiple sclerosis (MS) is unknown, but the pathology is consistent with an immunological etiology. Studies conducted with the animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), have provided insight into how the immune system can provoke an immunopathological response characteristic of that seen in MS. The use of inbred rats and mice for studies of EAE has been especially rewarding with respect to the identification of the epitopes of encephalitogenic antigens responsible for the induction of this autoimmune disease and in elucidating the effector mechanism underlying EAE. Moreover, it has also been possible to ascertain how EAE can be regulated, leading to therapeutic modalities which have been applied in clinical studies of MS patients. This review briefly summarizes studies of EAE in rodents, drawing comparisons with immunological findings reported in patients with MS. It is clear that important lessons can be learned from the detailed investigation of animal models that may be applicable to human immunological disorders.
