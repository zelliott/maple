Recent studies indicate that some mammalian S-type lectins bind preferentially to oligosaccharides containing the repeating disaccharide [3Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1]n or poly-N-acetyllactosamine (PL) sequence. We report here our investigation on the distribution of these sequences in glycoproteins in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and the interaction of glycoproteins containing PL chains with an immobilized S-type lectin (L14) from calf heart tissue. Our results demonstrate that PL chains are carried by a few high molecular weight glycoproteins which are bound by tomato-lectin Sepharose and one of these was precipitated by antibody to LAMP-1 (a lysosomal-associated membrane glycoprotein). More importantly, these high molecular weight glycoproteins, including LAMP-1, were bound with high affinity by L14. These results indicate that mammalian S-type lectins are highly specific in their interactions with glycoproteins and that LAMPs carry important recognition sequences for these lectins.
