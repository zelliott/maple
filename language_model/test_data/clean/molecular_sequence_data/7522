Heat shock protein genes are induced by various kinds of stress. Besides stress, the heat shock family gene hsp70 has been shown to be induced by growth-stimulating agents such as the DNA virus oncoproteins and serum. Here, we report cloning of a novel cDNA that encodes a 100 kDa heat shock protein-related polypeptide as a human papillomavirus oncoprotein E7-inducible gene. E7 induces expression of this heat shock protein at the level of RNA synthesis. Moreover, the induction of this heat shock protein-mRNA was dependent on the conserved region 2 of the E7 protein, which is essential for binding to the proteins of the retinoblastoma family.
