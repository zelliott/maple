We have characterized sequences of genomic DNA 5' to the coding region of the rat malic enzyme gene. This sequence possesses neither TATA nor CCAAT sequences in their usual positions but is rich in GC residues. Sequences similar to those found in the regulatory regions of other genes are discussed. Deletion analyses have revealed that sequences +1 to -41 are sufficient to initiate expression, although inclusion of information up to -177 is necessary for maximal promoter activity.
