This paper investigates species delimitation within the Lactarius gerardii species complex and explores its taxonomic and geographical extent. A combined molecular phylogeny based on ITS, LSU and rpb2 gene sequences is constructed and morphological characters are evaluated. While L. gerardii was originally described from North America, it has later been reported from all over Asia. Therefore a worldwide sampling range was aimed at, including species exhibiting morphological affinities with L. gerardii. The phylogenetic analyses indicate that intercontinental conspecificity in L. gerardii is absent. Thirty strongly supported clades are retrieved of which 18 are morphologically identifiable species. The group is elevated to Lactarius subg. Gerardii stat. nov. It includes, apart from L. gerardii s.l., L. atrovelutinus, L. bicolor, L. ochrogalactus, L. petersenii, L. reticulatovenosus, L. sepiaceus, L. subgerardii and L. wirrabara, as well as the pleurotoid L. uyedae. The paraphyletic nature of the genus Lactarius is confirmed. Lactarius subg. Gerardii appears not affiliated with L.Â subg. Plinthogalus and this can be substantiated morphologically. No representatives are known from Europe, Africa or South America. The high frequency of intercontinental sister relationships observed between America, Asia and the Australian region, suggests multiple migration and speciation events have occurred across continents.
