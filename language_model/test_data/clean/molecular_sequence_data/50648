To delineate cis-acting elements for adenovirus (Ad) 12 E1A gene transcription, we transfected HeLa and NIH3T3 cells with DNAs having various deletions in the 5'-upstream region linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Deletions in the regions between nucleotide (nt) positions 54 and 166, and 167 and 200, with respect to the left end of the viral genome at nt position 1, caused a two- to three-fold reduction in transcription. Transcription decreased to an almost undetectable level with loss of the region between nt positions 201 and 282. The effect of these mutations was almost consistent between both cell lines. The region between nt positions 77 and 94 stimulated transcription when situated upstream of the simian virus 40 early promoter in either orientation. Transcription was stimulated about ninefold in the presence of the DNA that encodes the product of the 13S, but not the 12S mRNA of the Ad12 E1A gene. These results indicate that transcription of the Ad12 E1A gene is regulated by multiple cis-acting elements and is stimulated by its own gene product.
