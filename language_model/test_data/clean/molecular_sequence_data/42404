A dysfunctional protein C (PC) molecule (Protein C Padua 2) was found in a 40-year-old man presenting with recurrent deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism and a family history of thrombotic disease. The patient exhibited a normal PC antigen level, normal chromogenic activity (using Protac as PC activator) but markedly reduced coagulometric activity. After adsorption of patient plasma onto Al(OH)3, between 30% and 45% PC antigen/chromogenic activity but no coagulometric activity was detectable in the supernatant. The dysfunctional molecule exhibited reduced affinity for a Ca++ dependent anti-protein C monoclonal antibody as detected by specific ELISA assay. Immunoblotting experiments showed that PC Padua 2 had an increased MW (95 kD v 65 kD for normal PC). The lesion responsible was determined by PCR/direct sequencing to be a heterozygous CGT/TGT transition in exon 3 of the protein C gene resulting in the substitution of Arg by Cys at residue--1 in the pro-peptide leader sequence. The presence of a high MW PC was consistent with the fact that (part of) the propeptide (at least Cys-1) still was attached to the protein C molecule. This finding could also explain the strongly reduced affinity of PC Padua 2 for the Ca++ dependent anti-protein C monoclonals.
