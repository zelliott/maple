A peptide comprising residues glu293 to ser334 from the principal neutralization determinant (V3 loop) of the envelope of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV1 LAVBRU isolate) has been inserted within internal permissive sites of either LamB or MalE, two envelope proteins from Escherichia coli K12. The MalE hybrid protein (MalE133-V3 loop) was stably expressed in the periplasm of Escherichia coli K12, and the V3 loop peptide was detectable on the surface of the native protein by an anti-gp160 monoclonal antibody (mAb 110-A). The disulfide bridge between the two cysteines of the loop was formed. In contrast, genetic coupling to the outer membrane protein LamB did not allow the expression of a stable hybrid protein, and major proteolytic cleavage products of the LamB153-V3 loop were detected by mAb 110-A. The two plasmid-encoded hybrid genes were transferred to an aroA mutant of Salmonella typhimurium. Constitutive expression of the MalE133-V3 loop had no detectable effect on cell growth and on the survival in vivo of the recipient strain. The LamB153-V3 loop was not stably expressed in Salmonella, either in vitro or in vivo. Live recombinant salmonellas expressing MalE-V3 and LamB-V3 loop hybrids were used to immunize mice. The MalE-V3 loop hybrid induced anti-HIV1 envelope antibodies detectable by Western blot and ELISA, while the anti-HIV1 envelope antibodies induced by the LamB-V3 loop hybrid were only detectable by Western blot. In addition, purified MalE-V3 loop hybrid protein was able to stimulate in vitro and induce in vivo a V3 loop-specific T-cell proliferative response.
