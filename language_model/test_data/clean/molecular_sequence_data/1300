The scorpion neurotoxin BmKK4 was purified from the venom of the Chinese scorpion Buthus martensi Karsch by a combination of gel-filtration, ion exchange and reversed phase chromatography. The primary sequence of BmKK4 was determined using the tandem MS/MS technique and the cDNA database searching as followings: ZTQCQ SVRDC QQYCL TPDRC SYGTC YCKTT (NH(2)). BmKK4 is the first isolated member of a new subfamily alpha-KTx17 of scorpion K(+) toxins.
