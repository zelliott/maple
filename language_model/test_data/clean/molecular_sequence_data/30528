A beta-galactoside-binding lectin was extracted from whole neonatal marmoset homogenate with lactose solution and purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography on Q Sepharose Fast Flow and by affinity adsorption to trypsinized and glutaraldehyde-fixed ghosts of rabbit erythrocytes. The lectin has a dimeric structure composed of two 15K subunits. Its amino acid composition and partial amino acid sequences were quite similar to those of beta-galactoside-binding lectins from human placenta and lung.
