The functions of some proteins encoded by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL/b' genes have been studied; however, systematic analysis of the transcripts for this region is still insufficient. The results of both rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and cDNA library screening in this study proved that 3' termini of all transcripts in the UL138-UL145 region were located approximately 20 bp downstream from each potential poly (A) signal, which were at the positions of nucleotides 7184, 9954 and 12848 in the UL/b' sequence of the H strain, respectively. Thus, there were at least two large families of polycistronic transcripts in this gene region. The first family of 3'-coterminal transcripts contained UL139, UL140 and UL141 genes, and the second one consisted of UL142, UL143, UL144 and UL145 genes. The 3'-coterminal characterization further confirmed that multiple uses of polyadenylation signals were commonly used by HCMV to utilize genetic information.
