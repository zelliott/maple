UL16-binding proteins (ULBPs) belong to a family of ligands for NKG2D activating receptor of human natural killer (NK) cells. We previously reported that RAET1E2, a soluble isoform of the RAET1E (ULBP4), inhibits NKG2D-mediated NK cytotoxicity. In this study, we examined whether ULBP4 could be recognized by gammadeltaT cells via TCRgammadelta. Here we show that immobilized soluble ULBP4 (rULBP4) induces the proliferation of human ovarian epithelial carcinoma- or colonic carcinoma-derived Vdelta2(+) T cells in vitro. These Vdelta2(+) T cells secrete Th1 cytokines and display a strong cytolytic activity toward ULBP4-transfected targets. We also show that ULBP4 binds to a soluble chimeric protein containing TCRgamma9/delta2 and activates TCR(-) Jurkat T cells transfected with TCRgamma9/delta2. Moreover, both TCRgammadelta and NKG2D are involved in ULBP4-induced activation and cytotoxicity of gammadeltaT cells. We found that ULBP4 is expressed not only on human tumor cells, but also on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected peripheral blood cells. Taken together, our data suggest that ULBP4 functions as a ligand for both TCRgammadelta and NKG2D and may play a key role in immune surveillance of tumor development and clearance of viral infection.
