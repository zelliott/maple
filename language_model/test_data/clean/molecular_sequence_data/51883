We have cloned four cyclin-B homologs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CLB1-CLB4, using the polymerase chain reaction and low stringency hybridization approaches. These genes form two classes based on sequence relatedness: CLB1 and CLB2 show highest homology to the Schizosaccharomyces pombe cyclin-B homolog cdc13 involved in the initiation of mitosis, whereas CLB3 and CLB4 are more highly related to the S. pombe cyclin-B homolog cig1, which appears to play a role in G1 or S phase. CLB1 and CLB2 mRNA levels peak late in the cell cycle, whereas CLB3 and CLB4 are expressed earlier in the cell cycle but peak later than the G1-specific cyclin, CLN1. Analysis of null mutations suggested that the CLB genes exhibit some degree of redundancy, but clb1,2 and clb2,3 cells were inviable. Using clb1,2,3,4 cells rescued by conditional overproduction of CLB1, we showed that the CLB genes perform an essential role at the G2/M-phase transition, and also a role in S phase. CLB genes also appear to share a role in the assembly and maintenance of the mitotic spindle. Taken together, these analyses suggest that CLB1 and CLB2 are crucial for mitotic induction, whereas CLB3 and CLB4 might participate additionally in DNA replication and spindle assembly.
