Src-family tyrosine kinases (SFKs), which participate in a variety of signal transduction events, are known to localize to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane through lipid modification. Recently, we showed that Lyn, an SFK member, is exocytosed to the plasma membrane via the Golgi region along the secretory pathway. We show here that SFK trafficking is specified by the palmitoylation state. Yes is also a monopalmitoylated SFK and is biosynthetically transported from the Golgi pool of caveolin to the plasma membrane. This pathway can be inhibited in the trans-Golgi network (TGN)-to-cell surface delivery by temperature block at 19 degrees C or dominant-negative Rab11 GTPase. A large fraction of Fyn, a dually palmitoylated SFK, is directly targeted to the plasma membrane irrespective of temperature block of TGN exit. Fyn(C6S), which lacks the second palmitoylation site, is able to traffic in the same way as Lyn and Yes. Moreover, construction of Yes(S6C) and chimeric Lyn or Yes with the Fyn N-terminus further substantiates the importance of the dual palmitoylation site for plasma membrane targeting. Taken together with our recent finding that Src, a nonpalmitoylated SFK, is rapidly exchanged between the plasma membrane and late endosomes/lysosomes, these results suggest that SFK trafficking is specified by the palmitoylation state in the SH4 domain.
