The nucleotide sequences of cDNAs encoding phospholamban were found to be virtually identical when the cDNA clones were isolated from rabbit slow-twitch (soleus) and rabbit cardiac muscle libraries. These findings demonstrate that both types of muscle express the same phospholamban gene. The deduced amino acid sequences of rabbit and dog phospholamban were identical except for a change from Asp (dog) to Glu (rabbit) at position 2. The nucleotide sequences of the 5'- and the very long 3'-untranslated regions of rabbit and dog phospholamban cDNAs also exhibited a high percentage of identity.
