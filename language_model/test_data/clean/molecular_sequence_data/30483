The bacterial insertion element IS1 contains two essential open reading frames, insA and insB, arranged in tandem. We have introduced a number of site-specific mutations into the region including the 3'-terminal region of insA, the region between insA and insB, and the ATG codon at the start of insB. Relative transposition activities of mutant and wild-type elements were determined using a modified in vivo cointegration assay. The results support the hypothesis that a translational (-1) frameshift occurring in the 3'-terminal region of insA and linking insB to insA is responsible for the synthesis of the active IS1 transposition enzyme. Further results with IS1 elements containing internal deletions are in agreement with a role of the normally terminated insA product as an inhibitor of transposition.
