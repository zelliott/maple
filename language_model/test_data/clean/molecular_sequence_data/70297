A clone panel of 27 human-Chinese hamster and 4 human-mouse somatic cell hybrids which contained as minimum five discriminating clones for any chromosome pairs was set up. Segregation analysis of 45 human chromosome-specific isoenzymes and PCR markers in hybrid clones allowed to demonstrate a possibility to apply the obtained panel for chromosome mapping of human genes.
