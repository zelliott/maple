Advances in DNA transposition technology have recently generated efficient tools for various types of functional genetic analyses. We demonstrate here the power of the bacteriophage Mu-derived in vitro DNA transposition system for modification and functional characterization of a complete bacterial virus genome. The linear double-stranded DNA genome of Escherichia coli bacteriophage PRD1 was studied by insertion mutagenesis with reporter mini-Mu transposons that were integrated in vitro into isolated genomic DNA. After introduction into bacterial cells by electroporation, recombinant transposon-containing virus clones were identified by autoradiography or visual blue-white screening employing alpha-complementation of E. coli beta-galactosidase. Additionally, a modified transposon with engineered NotI sites at both ends was used to introduce novel restriction sites into the phage genome. Analysis of the transposon integration sites in the genomes of viable recombinant phage generated a functional map, collectively indicating genes and genomic regions essential and nonessential for virus propagation. Moreover, promoterless transposons defined the direction of transcription within several insert-tolerant genomic regions. These strategies for the analysis of viral genomes are of a general nature and therefore may be applied to functional genomics studies in all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell viruses.
