We have generated a human monoclonal cytotoxic IgM lambda antibody (TrJ3) that reacted specifically with all lymphoblastoid B-cell lines expressing HLA-B44(12) and B45(12). TrJ3 hybridoma supernatant was suitable for HLA-B12 typing of freshly isolated blood mononuclear cells. Analysis of available amino acid sequences of HLA-B molecules indicated that the alpha 1 domain does not contain the TrJ3 serological epitope. Since HLA-B44 is associated with a unique serine residue at position 167 that points towards the peptide binding groove, we propose that S167 of the alpha 2 domain helix is a critical part of the TrJ3 epitope.
