Cyclic AMP-mediated phosphorylation of calcium channel subunits was studied in vitro and in vivo in preparations from dog heart. Calcium channels in native cardiac membranes were phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) solubilized with digitonin and subsequently immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal antibody generated against the deduced carboxy-terminal sequence of the cardiac beta subunit. A 62 kDa protein was identified as the major PKA-substrate in the immunoprecipitates. In the intact myocardium, this putative beta subunit was found to be phosphorylated in response to cAMP elevating agents. In contrast, no phosphorylation of a protein with an electrophoretic mobility similar to the alpha 1 subunit was detected, although 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor sites were recovered in the immunoprecipitates. Thus, we suggest that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the beta subunit is the major mechanism for beta-adrenergic regulation of cardiac L-type calcium channel activity.
