In order to isolate a part of the immunoglobulin E (IgE) heavy chain cDNA of the horse, primers have been designed based upon well conserved sequences in humans, sheep and rats. The PCR resulted in a 500 bp fragment which hybridised with a human IgE constant region probe. The fragment was cloned and sequenced and its derived protein sequence compared with the corresponding sequences in humans, sheep and mice. Most amino acids common to these three species are also shared by the horse.
