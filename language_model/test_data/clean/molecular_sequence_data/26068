A subunit (Mr 15,600) from the high molecular weight protein from rapeseed was separated and isolated; its purity and homogeneity were ascertained. The subunit was cleaved with cyanogen bromide, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. The fragments were separated and isolated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gel filtration, column chromatography on Dowex 1 x 2, and paper electrophoresis. The amino acid compositions of the intact subunit and different fragments obtained from enzymatic and chemical cleavages were determined. The subunit and its fragments were sequenced by manual Edman method. The phenylthiohydantoin amino acids obtained after each step were identified by thin-layer chromatography and ultraviolet spectroscopy. The complete amino acid sequence of the subunit consisting of 125 amino acid residues has been established by the overlapping method.
