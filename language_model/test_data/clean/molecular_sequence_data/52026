In an effort to characterize genes expressed in the cerebellum, we have isolated two cDNA clones, H11B (D16S286) and 507 (D5S344), that hybridized to a cerebellar cDNA probe. Using a panel of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids, cDNA clone H11B was mapped to human chromosome 16, and clone 507 was mapped to human chromosome 5. TaqI RFLPs were identified with both clones and were used for linkage analysis in the CEPH families. D16S286 was tightly linked to several markers near chromosome 16p13, and D5S344 was tightly linked to several markers on chromosome 5q. Sequence tagged sites or expressed sequence tags were generated from the 3' untranslated regions of both cDNA clones.
