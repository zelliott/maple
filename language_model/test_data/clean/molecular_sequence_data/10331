We searched for novel imprinted genes in a region of human chromosome 11p15.5, which contains several known imprinted genes. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of the IPL ( I mprinted in P lacenta and L iver) gene, which shows tissue-specific expression and functional imprinting, with the maternal allele active and the paternal allele relatively inactive, in many human and mouse tissues. Human IPL is highly expressed in placenta and shows low but detectable expression in fetal and adult liver and lung. Mouse Ipl maps to the region of chromosome 7 which is syntenic with human 11p15.5 and this gene is expressed in placenta and at higher levels in extraembryonic membranes (yolk sac), fetal liver and adult kidney. Mouse and human IPL show sequence similarity to TDAG51 , a gene which was shown to be essential for Fas expression and susceptibility to apoptosis in a T lymphocyte cell line. Like several other imprinted genes, mouse and human IPL genes are small and contain small introns. These data expand the repertoire of known imprinted genes and will be helpful in testing the mechanism of genomic imprinting and the role of imprinted genes in growth regulation.
