A direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the human heart cDNA clones was used to generate lambda PCR product. By the use of the first set of primers derived from lambda gt11, each cDNA insert can readily be obtained. Using millipore filters, primers and nucleotides are removed and this purified PCR product can then be subjected to a second set of fluorescent primers in the generation of nucleotides in the auto-cycle reactions for automated DNA sequencing.
