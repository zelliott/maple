Pasteurella multocida, a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen, known to affect a wide range of domestic as well as wild animal and avian species throughout the world by causing either systemic or localized infections termed as 'pasteurellosis'. P. multocida isolates are known to possess type IV fimbriae (pili) as one of the major virulence factors based on their role in adhesion to host surfaces and subsequent pathogenesis. In the present study, ptfA gene of Indian P. multocida isolates (n = 8) originated from different animal (buffalo, sheep, goat, pig) and avian host species (chicken, turkey, duck, quail) were amplified, cloned, sequenced and compared with available ptfA/fimbrial protein sequences in GenBank/publications (n = 22) to understand its variability with respect to geography/host/serogroup/disease specific patterns. Multiple sequence alignment revealed highly conserved N-terminus α-1 helix region and heterogeneous C-terminus (68-137 aa) comprised of β-strand regions (β1, β2, β3, β4) with conserved two pairs of cysteine residues. Interestingly, an existence of absolute homogeneity among the P. multocida isolates that caused haemorrhagic septicaemia in bovines and septicaemic pasteurellosis in sheep and goats was noticed. Pig isolates had 99.3% homogeneity. On contrary, more diversity (35.8%) was observed among isolates that caused fowl cholera in avians irrespective of identical capsular/somatic serogroup and similar host species. Phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide sequences of ptfA gene revealed formation of mixed clusters with isolates representing different disease conditions as well as serogroups irrespective of country of origin which indicated the possible role of cross-species transmission among different animal/avian species. The study indicated highly conserved and host specific fimbriae among animal species than relatively divergent fimbriae among avian species.
