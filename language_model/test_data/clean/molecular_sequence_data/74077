Eukaryotic ribonuclease (RNase) P and RNase MRP are evolutionary related RNA-based enzymes involved in metabolism of various RNA molecules, including tRNA and rRNA. In contrast to the closely related eubacterial RNase P, which is comprised of an RNA component and a single small protein, these enzymes contain multiple protein components. Here we report the results of footprinting studies performed on purified Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNase MRP and RNase P holoenzymes. The results identify regions of the RNA components affected by the protein moiety, suggest a role of the proteins in stabilization of the RNA fold, and point to substantial similarities between the two evolutionary related RNA-based enzymes.
