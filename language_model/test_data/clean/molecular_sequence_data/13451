Amino acid residues 81-100 of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) nucleoprotein contain a cytotoxic T cell epitope that is recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in association with human leukocyte antigen B44. With panels of truncated and overlapping peptides, the minimal and optimal epitope recognized by CTLs was shown to be a 9-mer peptide (residues 88-96). The peptide can stimulate effectively CTLs that are able to recognize endogenously synthesized and processed HCV nucleoprotein.
