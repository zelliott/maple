cDNA clones encoding the human kidney S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (kidney-type isozyme) were isolated. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA indicates that this enzyme contains 395 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 43,660 Da. The predicted amino acid sequence of this protein shares 84% similarity with that of human liver S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (liver-type isozyme). In addition, the developmental expression of these two isozyme mRNAs has been studied in the human liver using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
