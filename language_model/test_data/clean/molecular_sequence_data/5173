Nucleotide sequences were obtained for the second internal transcribed spacer of the ribosomal gene repeat and for part of the mitochondrial-cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene from geographical isolates of Paragonimus westermani from Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, peninsular Malaysia and Thailand. Sequences were obtained from several other species of Paragonimus for comparative purposes. Two groups were recognized within P. westermani: an NE group (China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan) which was relatively uniform and included both diploid and triploid forms, and a southern group (Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines), members of which were genetically distant from one another. According to both ITS2 and COI data, genetic distances among P. westermani isolates equalled or exceeded those between some distinct species of Paragonimus. The ITS2 sequences were conserved relative to COI sequences. Substitutions among the latter may be approaching saturation within the genus Paragonimus.
