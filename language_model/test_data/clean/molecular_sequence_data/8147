The investigation of fission yeast chromosome structure and function has moved rapidly over the past 10 years. The isolation of replication origins, telomeres and centromeres has allowed the development of minichromosomes, a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC)-like cloning system and investigations into chromosome segregation and behaviour during mitosis and meiosis. Many mutants have been isolated which are defective in chromosome segregation. The development of the fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) technique for use in S. pombe has allowed the localization of centromeres and telomeres throughout mitosis and meiosis. In combination with indirect immunofluorescence to detect spindle and chromosomal proteins, the FISH technique should further advance our understanding of fission yeast chromosome structure and function. The recent discovery of a heterochromatin-like structure mediating transcriptional repression at centromeres reinforces the notion that fission yeast centromeres are similar to those of larger eukaryotes. Further characterization of such phenomena will accelerate the genetic dissection of this important chromosomal element.
