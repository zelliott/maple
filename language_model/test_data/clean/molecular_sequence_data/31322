The Drosophila FMRFamide gene is comprised of two exons separated by a 2.8-kb intervening sequence. The first exon consists of the 5' untranslated region and is spliced to the initiator methionine codon. The second exon encodes the prohormone and the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA. The promoter region contains a TATA box 30 nucleotides upstream from a consensus transcription start site. Immunohistochemical studies using antibodies generated against synthetic peptides and in situ hybridization histochemistry define a set of about 40 neurons in the brain and ventral ganglia that express the prohormone gene.
