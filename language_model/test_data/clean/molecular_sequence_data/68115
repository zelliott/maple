It has been shown that nitric oxide (NO) is involved in islet cell damage induced by interleukin-1 (IL-1). Here we show that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) synergistically induced NO production and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression in mouse islet cells. Cycloheximide (CXH) did not prevent the iNOS mRNA expressions. The combination of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, which is highly cytotoxic to mouse islet cells, failed to destruct islet cells in the absence of L-arginine or in the presence of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA). These observations suggest that NO is a primary effector in islet cell damage caused by IFN-gamma plus TNF-alpha.
