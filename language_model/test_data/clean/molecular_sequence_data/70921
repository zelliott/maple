A series of HeLa cell lines which stably express beta-globin pre-mRNAs carrying point mutations at nt 654, 705, or 745 of intron 2 has been developed. The mutations generate aberrant 5' splice sites and activate a common 3' cryptic splice site upstream leading to aberrantly spliced beta-globin mRNA. Antisense oligonucleotides, which in vivo blocked aberrant splice sites and restored correct splicing of the pre-mRNA, revealed major differences in the sensitivity of these sites to antisense probes. Although the targeted pre-mRNAs differed only by single point mutations, the effective concentrations of the oligonucleotides required for correction of splicing varied up to 750-fold. The differences among the aberrant 5' splice sites affected sensitivity of both the 5' and 3' splice sites; in particular, sensitivity of both splice sites was severely reduced by modification of the aberrant 5' splice sites to the consensus sequence. These results suggest large differences in splicing of very similar pre-mRNAs in vivo. They also indicate that antisense oligonucleotides may provide useful tools for studying the interactions of splicing machinery with pre-mRNA.
