The cDNAs from a hybridoma (mAb 481.1) specific for diuron, a widely used phenylurea herbicide, were cloned into the phage display vector pComb8. Antigen-binding clones were selected by panning on diuron-hapten-BSA conjugates. The nucleotide and deduced amino-acid sequences encoding the Fab regions of the light (kappa) and heavy (gamma) chains were determined. The light chain was from mouse kappa chain subgroup III and the heavy chain was a member of the mouse H chain subgroup III(d).
