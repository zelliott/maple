The rate of clot retraction in platelet-rich plasma was decreased by synthetic peptide analogues of fibrinogen and monoclonal antibodies each of which bind to the platelet plasma membrane glycoproteins IIb and/or IIIa. These and related data demonstrate that intact complexes of the glycoproteins IIb and IIIa are required for platelet-mediated clot retraction.
