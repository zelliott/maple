To provide new insights into ligand/A1 adenosine receptor (A1 AR) interactions, site-directed mutagenesis was used to test the role of several residues in the first four transmembrane (TM) domains of the human A1 AR. Based on multiple sequence analysis of all known ARs, both acidic (glutamic acid and aspartic acid) and polar hydroxy (serine and threonine) amino acids were identified that could potentially play a role in binding adenosine. Glu16 (TM1), Asp55 (TM2), Ser93 and Ser94 (TM3), Ser135 (TM4), and Thr 141 (TM4) were identified in all ARs, and Ser6 and Ser23 (TM1) were identified in all A1 ARs. To test the role of these residues, each was individually mutated to alanine. When Ala6, Ala23, Ala50, Ala93, Ala135, and Ala141 constructs were tested, affinities for [3H]2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA) and [3H]1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX) were similar to those seen for the wild-type receptor. After conversion of Glu16 to Ala16, the affinity for [3H]CCPA and other agonists fell 10-100-fold, whereas the affinity for [3H]DPCPX and other antagonists was not affected. After conversion of Asp55 to Ala55, the affinity for [3H]CCPA and other agonists increased < or = 100-fold, whereas the affinity for [3H]DPCPX and other antagonists was not affected. Studies of the Ala55 construct also revealed that Asp55 is responsible for allosteric regulation of binding by sodium because the affinity for [3H]CCPA did not change over broad ranges of sodium concentrations. When Ser94 was converted to Ala94, A1 AR immunoreactivity was present on stable cell lines; however, functional binding sites could not be detected. When Ser94 was converted to Thr94, the affinity for some xanthine antagonists fell. These data show that Glu16 in TM1 and Asp55 in TM2 play important roles in agonist/A1 AR interactions and show that Asp55 is responsible for allosteric regulation of ligand/A1 AR binding by sodium. We also identify Ser94 as an important site for ligand binding.
