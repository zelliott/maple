Since their discovery 20 years ago, the natriuretic peptides have emerged as an important endocrine response to excessive increases in intravascular volume. In a cGMP-dependent fashion, the natriuretic peptides induce a balanced vasodilation, decreasing preload and afterload in states of cardiac impairment and stimulating the excretion of salt and water by the kidneys. Recombinant B-type natriuretic peptide (nesiritide), identical to the principle natriuretic peptide produced by human cardiac ventricles, has just been approved for the treatment of acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Nesiritide has been shown in controlled trials in congestive heart failure to decrease pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, improve cardiac output, stimulate natriuresis and diuresis, and rapidly induce symptomatic relief. As a naturally occurring stress hormone of the heart, with particular rectifying effects on the pulmonary, cardiac and renal vasculatures, B-type natriuretic peptide may prove useful in a variety of cardiovascular disease states.
