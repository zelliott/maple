SHIP-1 is an SH2 domain containing inositol-5-phosphatase that appears to be a negative regulator of hematopoiesis. To the potential effects of SHIP-1 on MMP2 secretion and migration of cancer cells, three murine SHIP-1 mutants were made: DeltaSH2-SHIP-1, DeltaPtase-SHIP-1, DeltaCter-SHIP-1. These mutant forms were subcloned as well as the wild type (WT) of murine SHIP-1 cDNA were subcloned into pcDNA3 expression vector, then transfected into and overexpressed SHIP-1 and its mutants in a Src-transformed 3Y1 cell line (SR3Y1). The results showed that overexpression of wild type of SHIP-1 does not affect the MMP2 secretion in both SR3Y1 and 3Y1 cells, but can induce MMP9 secretion, while either WT SHIP-1, the SH2 domain, phosphatase domain, or C terminus deletion mutants could significantly block the MMP2 and MMP9 secretion in SR3Y1 cells and suppress cell invasion ability. The results confirmed SHIP-1 as a negative regulator for cell migration and invasion in transformed cells, and implied that it may function through each of its three domains.
