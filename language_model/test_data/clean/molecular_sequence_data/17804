The two subunits of the heterodimeric protein cap32/34, an actin-binding protein, are encoded by separate single-copy genes. We have established the genomic structure of both genes. A sequence comparison of cap32/34 with capZ from chicken skeletal muscle and two partially known sequences from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Xenopus laevis show that heterodimeric capping proteins belong to a highly conserved group of actin-binding proteins. This conclusion is supported by the cross-reaction of polyclonal antibodies against cap32 and cap34 with proteins from lower and higher eukaryotes. In addition, a system is presented that allows the expression of truncated cap34 polypeptides under the control of the cap34 promoter.
