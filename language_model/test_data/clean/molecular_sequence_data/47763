Bet v 1, the major pollen allergen from white birch, displays a considerable degree of heterogeneity. Until now, all molecular and immunological characterization studies of Bet v 1 isoforms have been performed with commercially available pollen of Swedish origin. In regard to clinical studies with Austrian birch pollen allergic individuals, knowledge about the isoform repertoire in Austrian birch pollen was necessary. cDNAs coding for Bet v 1 isoforms from Austrian birch pollen were cloned by PCR amplification and sequenced. Besides the Austrian variants of the Swedish isoforms Bet v 1a (62% of the clones), ALK167 (4%), and Bet v 1d/h, Bet v 1g, and Bet v 11 (24%), three sequences with a significantly lower homology to known isoforms and two Bet v 1a-homologous sequences with a 7 bp insertion coding for a truncated protein were detected. No Austrian variants of the majority of the Swedish isoforms were found. The isoforms coding for truncated proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and tested by immunoblotting. They bound a polyclonal anti-Bet v 1 antibody but did not recognize birch pollen allergic patients' serum IgE and two Bet v 1-specific monoclonal antibodies. The similarity of the Bet v 1 isoform patterns of Swedish and Austrian birch pollen justifies the use of Bet v 1 derived from Swedish pollen for clinical studies with birch pollen allergic individuals from outside Northern Europe.
