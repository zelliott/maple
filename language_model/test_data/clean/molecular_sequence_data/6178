The autoxidation of 4-methylcatechol under quasi-physiological conditions, leading to 2-hydroxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone, was investigated. The effects of pH and metal ions were examined. An electrophilic attack of dioxygen to the 4-methylcatechol monoanion to form a transient peroxo species is proposed. It was concluded that such a non-enzymic conversion is likely for this model compound and for its physiological counterpart, a specific tyrosyl residue incorporated in the protein chain at the active site of copper amine oxidases.
