Crystal structures of the catalytic domain of human stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) and collagenase-3 (MMP-13) with a hydroxamic acid inhibitor SM-25453 have been solved at 2.01 and 2.37A resolutions, respectively. The results revealed that the binding modes for this inhibitor to MMP-3 and -13 were quite similar. However, subtle comparative differences were observed at the bottom of S1' pockets, which were occupied with the guanidinomethyl moiety of the inhibitor. A remarkable feature of the inhibitor was the deep penetration of its long aliphatic chain into the S1' pocket and exposure of the guanidinomethyl moiety to the solvent.
