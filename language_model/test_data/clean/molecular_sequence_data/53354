We have identified an Ag recognized by autologous CTL on the melanoma cells of a patient who enjoyed an unusually favorable clinical evolution. The antigenic peptide, which is presented by HLA-A28 molecules, is encoded by a mutated sequence in a new gene. This gene, which was named MUM-3, is expressed ubiquitously and shows homology with the RNA helicase gene family. Limiting dilution analysis indicated that at least 0.15% of the blood CD8 T cells were tumor-specific CTL precursors. The MUM-3 Ag was recognized by 90% of these CTL, indicating that it is the dominant target Ag of the tumor-specific CTL response. The high frequency of anti-MUM-3 CTL was confirmed with tetramers of soluble HLA-A28 molecules loaded with the antigenic peptide. MUM-3 tetramers stained 1.2% of blood CD8 cells, a frequency that has never been reported for T cells directed against a strictly tumor-specific Ag. To confirm these results, the CD8 T cells that were clearly labeled with tetramers were restimulated in clonal conditions. About 90% of these cells proliferated, and all the resulting clones proved lytic and MUM-3 specific. By improving the conditions used for the in vitro restimulation of CTL precursors by the tumor cells, the same frequency could be obtained in limiting dilution analysis. These results show that some cancer patients have a high frequency of circulating CTL that are directed against a strictly tumor-specific Ag. These CTL are responsive to restimulation in vitro and are easily detected with tetramers. Such responses may therefore be an achievable goal for therapeutic vaccination with tumor-specific Ags.
