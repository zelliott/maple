The DLX gene family is a family of divergent homeobox genes which are related to the Drosophila distal-less (Dll) gene and has been reported to be expressed primarily in the forebrain and craniofacial structures. We have previously identified a new member of this family, DLX-7. We now report that this gene is expressed in normal hematopoietic cells and leukemia cell lines with erythroid characteristics. We used an antisense oligonucleotide targeted against the translation start site of DLX-7 mRNA to inhibit its expression in a human erythroleukemia cell line K562, which expresses DLX-7 at a high level. The antisense oligonucleotide efficiently reduced the DLX-7 mRNA, while control oligonucleotides, including a mutant oligonucleotide identical to the antisense sequence except for four nucleotide mismatches, had no effect on DLX-7 mRNA level. Inhibition of DLX-7 expression decreased the plating efficiency by approximately 70% compared with control. The antisense treatment caused apoptosis, as shown by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-digoxigenin nick end labeling (TUNEL) method. Down-regulation of DLX-7 expression by antisense treatment was associated with a reduction in GATA-1 and c-myc mRNA levels. Thus, we conclude that DLX-7 is expressed in hematopoietic cells and that the inhibition of its expression results in the decreased levels of GATA-1 and c-myc genes, with an accompanying induction of apoptosis.
