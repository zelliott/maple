All class II filamentous bacteriophage coat proteins contain a conserved, 12-amino acid sequence highly homologous to the loop portion of the EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding motif. The Pf3 coat protein contains two regions of homology to this sequence. The 12-amino acid sequence corresponds to a region of the Pf1 coat protein whose structure is controversial. In some models of the virus structure, this region is alpha-helical. In others, it forms a loop that folds back on itself. The similarity of this region to the loop in the helix-loop-helix Ca(2+)-binding motif suggests that it takes on a loop structure in the virion. Each filamentous phage lacks at least one residue normally involved in Ca(2+)-coordination, consistent with the relatively weak Ca(2+)-binding properties of the filamentous phages. Consideration of the structure of the coat protein in the membrane and in the virus particle indicates that the protein may be more effective in binding cations in its membrane-bound form than in the virus particle. This suggests that release of cations from this loop may be an obligate step during assembly of the proteins into the virus particle.
