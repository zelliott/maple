We have prepared microtubules from brain tissue by stabilizing the cellular microtubules in 6.7 M glycerol buffer, instead of the usual procedure which extracts the solubilized protein and then reassembles microtubules in vitro at some later time. There are substantial differences in the microtubule associated proteins obtained by the two methods, and brain spectrin is a major component of the stabilized microtubules. We have now modified the buffer used for the isolation of stabilized microtubules to minimize their tendency to aggregate. When the stabilized microtubules were further purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, we were able to distinguish previously unidentified polypeptides at 49, 74 (doublet), and 100 kilodaltons (doublet). These bands maintained staining intensity in the same proportion to tubulin as in the original homogenate, whereas background proteins were diminished in staining intensity. We now report the identification of the 74-kilodalton doublet polypeptides as synapsin-1 by peptide mapping. Synapsin-1 is a protein known to bind to brain spectrin and also to microtubules, and may thus serve as a linker between these cytoskeletal components.
