Fluorescence decrease in casein solutions induced by proteolytic enzymes is mainly due to cleavage of alpha-casein, and in particular to alpha S1-casein, which is quantitatively the main component of commercial casein. Treatment of alpha-casein with o-iodosobenzoic acid, diminished its intrinsic fluorescence considerably and abolished the decrease in fluorescence induced by proteolytic cleavage. The carboxyterminal Trp at position 199 in alpha S1-casein contributes approximately 30% to the overall effect, while the Trp at position 164 contributes about 70%. Treatment of alpha-casein with cyanogen bromide lowered the initial fluorescence of the preparation, but, in the resulting fragment, trypsin still diminished some of the residual fluorescence. The velocity of decrease in fluorescence correlates with the distance from the Trp in position 164 at which the peptide bond is broken. This effect seems to be rather unique for the caseins, but particularly for alpha S1-casein; this is due to the existence of a Trp that is in the vicinity of hydrophobic amino acids and which upon hydrolysis, becomes exposed to a more hydrophilic environment.
