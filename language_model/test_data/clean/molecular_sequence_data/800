A multiplexed tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) technique known as iterative accumulation multiplexing (IAM) has been implemented on a hybrid quadrupole Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (Q-FTICR-MS). The IAM experiment resulted in obtaining MS/MS spectra for six analytes in two MS/MS experiments while characteristic resolving power and mass measurement accuracies were maintained. Parent-product ion correlations were graphically represented in a "ratiogram" where each product ion is encoded with a ratio unique to the parent ion from which it was formed. This is the first example of multiplexed MS on a FTICR instrument where the ions are encoded externally to the ICR cell. By performing the encoding external to the ICR cell, one set of ions can be encoded while the previous set of ions is being analyzed in the cell, maximizing the use of the continuous ion current emanating from the electrospray ionization source.
