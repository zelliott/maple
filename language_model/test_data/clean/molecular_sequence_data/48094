Fucoidan fractions from the brown seaweed Chorda filum were studied using solvolytic desulfation. Methylation analysis and NMR spectroscopy were applied for native and desulfated polysaccharides. Homofucan sulfate from C. filum was shown to contain poly-alpha-(1-->3)-fucopyranoside backbone with a high degree of branching, mainly of alpha-(1-->2)-linked single units. Some fucopyranose residues are sulfated at O-4 (mainly) and O-2 positions. Some alpha-(1-->3)-linked fucose residues were shown by NMR to be 2-O-acetylated. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of desulfated, deacetylated fucan were completely assigned. The spectral data obtained correspond to a quasiregular polysaccharide structure with a branched hexasaccharide repeating unit. Other fucoidan fractions from C. filum have more complex carbohydrate composition and give rather complex methylation patterns. [formula: see text]
