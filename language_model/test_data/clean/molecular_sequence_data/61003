An investigation of the extracts from bulbs of Allium porrum L. has led to the isolation of four spirostanol saponins. Two of them are new compounds and have been identified as: (25R)-5 alpha-spirostan-3 beta, 6 beta-diol 3-O-{O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)-O-[beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-->3)]-O- beta -D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->4)-beta-D-galactopyranoside} (3) and (25R)-5 alpha-spirostan-3 beta,6 beta-diol 3-O-{O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->3)-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)-O- [beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-->3)]-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->4)-beta-D- galactopyranoside} (4). The isolated compounds were evaluated for their antifungal activity.
