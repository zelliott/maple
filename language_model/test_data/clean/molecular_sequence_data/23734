Sequence variation in the gag p6 region in subtype B HIV-1 has been associated with changes in viral replication capacity and antiretroviral drug susceptibility. We examined sequence variation in the HIV-1 gag p6 region using plasma samples from 22 individuals with non-subtype B HIV-1 infection [subtypes A, C, D, F, and G, and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) CRF01-AE and CRF02_AG]. An additional 105 gag sequences from the Los Alamos National Laboratory database were also analyzed. Extensive length variation was observed in the p6 gag region. Specific patterns of insertions and deletions were observed in different subtypes and CRFs, and no two subtypes or CRFs had the same general pattern. PTAP duplications were more common in subtype C than other strains (3 of 14 in subtype C vs. 2 of 113 in other strains, p = 0.004), and KQE duplications were seen only in subtype B. Further studies are needed to determine whether such genotypic differences influence viral replication capacity, antiretroviral drug susceptibility, or other phenotypic properties of these strains.
