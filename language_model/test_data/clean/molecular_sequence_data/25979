We have reported that a second rat atrial natriuretic peptide, iso-rANP (1-45), as well as the putative ANP homologue, iso-rANP (17-45), elicited circulatory and renal responses in the rat similar to those found after administration of ANP. Iso-rANP also interacted with ANP to potentiate the observed biological activity in the rat. In the present studies in awake dogs, intravenous infusion of low doses (6.3-50 pmol.kg-1.min-1) of iso-rANP(1-45) and iso-rANP(17-45) increased plasma immunoreactive ANP and suppressed plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone. Iso-rANP, like ring-deleted analogues of ANP, may have displaced ANP from ANP clearance receptors to increase plasma ANP concentration, since factors influencing myocardial ANP release were not changed. The effect of iso-rANP (1-45) and (17-45) in lowering PRA and plasma aldosterone may therefore have been indirect, via ANP stimulation of active guanylate cyclase-linked ANP receptors. However, an additional direct effect of iso-rANP on an active receptor cannot be excluded.
