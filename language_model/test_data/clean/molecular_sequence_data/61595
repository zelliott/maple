Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 3C (EBNA3C) is critical for EBV immortalization of infected B lymphocytes and can coactivate the EBV LMP1 promoter with EBNA2. EBNA3C amino acids 365 to 545 are necessary and sufficient for coactivation and are required for SUMO-1 and SUMO-3 interaction. We found that EBNA3C but not EBNA3CDelta343-545 colocalized with SUMO-1 in nuclear bodies and was modified by SUMO-2, SUMO-3, and SUMO-1. EBNA3C amino acids 545 to 628 and amino acids 30 to 365 were also required for EBNA3C sumolation and nuclear body localization but were dispensable for coactivation, indicating that EBNA3C sumolation is not required for coactivation. Furthermore, EBNA3C amino acids 476 to 992 potently coactivated with EBNA2 but EBNA3C amino acids 516 to 922 lacked activity, indicating that amino acids 476 to 515 are critical for coactivation. EBNA3C amino acids 476 to 515 include DDDVIEV(507-513), which are similar to SUMO-1 EEDVIEV(84-90). EBNA3C m1 and m2 point mutations, DDD(507-509) mutated to AAA and DVIEVID(509-513) mutated to AVIAVIA, respectively, diminished SUMO-1 and SUMO-3 interaction in directed yeast two-hybrid and glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays. Furthermore, EBNA3C m1 and m2 did not coactivate the LMP1 promoter with EBNA2. Overexpression of wild-type SUMO-1, SUMO-3, and the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9 coactivated the LMP1 promoter with EBNA2. Since EBNA2 activation is dependent on p300/CBP, the possible effect of EBNA3C on p300-mediated transcription was assayed. EBNA3C potentiated transcription of p300 fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain, whereas EBNA3C m1 and m2 did not. All of these data are consistent with a model in which EBNA3C upregulates EBNA2-mediated gene activation by binding to a sumolated repressor and inhibiting repressive effects on p300/CBP and other transcription factor(s) at EBNA2-regulated promoters.
