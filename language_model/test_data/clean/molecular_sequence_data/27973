The cellular retinoic acid binding protein is thought to be involved in the retinoic-acid-mediated signal transduction pathway. We have isolated the mouse cellular retinoic acid binding protein cDNA from an embryonal-carcinoma-derived cell line by using differential cDNA cloning strategies. In situ hybridization on sections of mouse embryos of various developmental stages indicated that the cellular retinoic acid binding protein gene, which we localized on mouse chromosome 9, is preferentially expressed in a subpopulation of neurectodermal cells. This restricted expression pattern suggests an important role for cellular retinoic acid binding protein in murine neurogenesis.
