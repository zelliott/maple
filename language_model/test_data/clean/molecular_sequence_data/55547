The psychrotolerant Pseudoalteromonas issachenkonii PAMC 22718 was isolated for its higher chitinase and protease activities from cold seawater in the Kara Sea, Arctic. Here, we present the draft genome sequence of PAMC 22718 to provide further information for the ecological function of the genus Pseudoalteromonas in a cold marine environment.
