The forkhead gene family of transcription factors belongs to the "winged helix" class of DNA-binding proteins. Today over 40 members of this gene family have been identified. Forkhead genes have been shown to be involved in embryonic development, tumorigenesis, and direction of tissue specificity of gene expression. Here we describe a new human forkhead gene called freac-10 (HGMW-approved symbol FKHL 18). A combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization and somatic cell hybrids localizes freac-10 to the chromosomal region of 20q11.1-q11.2. Hybridization to a panel consisting of RNA derived from 50 different tissues shows that freac-10 is transcribed predominantly in the aorta, thus having a unique expression pattern compared with other forkhead genes. Sequence comparison reveals a striking similarity, over the conserved DNA binding region, to a murine forkhead gene-fkh-3. We propose, based on sequence differences in the N- and C-terminal regions of the forkhead domain and a clear difference in expression pattern between freac-10 and fkh-3, that freac-10 represents a novel member of this gene family.
