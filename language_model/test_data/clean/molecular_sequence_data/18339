The overall control of the haemopoietic system is ultimately articulated at the level of stem cell proliferative regulation. An understanding of the control processes involved is central to a full understanding of the regulation of haemopoiesis in health and disease. We describe here the recent advances in understanding of the negative regulation of primitive haemopoietic cells. The possible involvement of inhibitory factors in the development of haemopoietic malignancy is discussed. The known biological functions of many of these inhibitory molecules suggests a therapeutic potential for negative regulators.
