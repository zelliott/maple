A genetic variant of human serum albumin (alloalbumin) is detected by capillary electrophoresis (CE). Two albumin peaks, which were in the ratio of approximately one, were clearly separated. One of the peaks had the same migration time as normal albumin (Alb A) and the other (Alb X) had a longer migration time. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of CNBr fragments (CB) of Alb X indicated that the amino acid substitution was localized in the CB5 fragment (residue 330-446) of the molecule, because of anomalous migration of CB5 in the gel. The CE mapping of the tryptic peptides from the variant CB5 revealed clearly the existence of a new peptide, and the lack of two normal peptides. The sequence analysis of the variant peptide collected by CE micropreparation showed that the N-terminus of the variant peptide corresponded to that of T49 in Alb A. The substitution site, lysine-->glutamic acid at the position 372, was revealed by sequence determination of the variant peptide purified by reversed-phase HPLC.
