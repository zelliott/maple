Formation of the 4-kDa peptides, which are essential constituents of the extracellular plaques in Alzheimer's disease, involves the sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases. The carboxy-terminal 99-amino-acid peptide which is liberated from APP by beta-secretase was used as a potential native substrate of the gamma-secretase(s). With the addition of an initiator Met and a FLAG sequence at the C-terminus (betaAPP100-FLAG), it was expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of the T7 promotor. The preferred site(s) of cleavage in the N-terminal 40-amino-acid beta-amyloid peptide and betaAPP100-FLAG by potential gamma-secretase(s) were rapidly identified using matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy in addition to peptide mapping followed by protein sequence analysis. Since gamma-secretases seem to be active at acidic pH, three cathepsins (D, E and B) were selected for testing. Studies using different detergents indicated that the cleavage preference of cathepsin D for the betaAPP100-FLAG is highly dependent on the surfactant used to solubilize this substrate. All three cathepsins were found to be capable of catabolizing both beta-amyloid peptides and the betaAPP100-FLAG. As cathepsin D was found to cleave the betaAPP100-FLAG in the vicinity of the C-terminus of the beta-amyloid peptides and cathepsin B has a high carboxypeptidase activity at low pH, the possibility cannot be excluded that cathepsins D and B are involved in the amyloidogenic processing of APP.
