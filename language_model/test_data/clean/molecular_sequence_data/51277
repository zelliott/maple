Here we demonstrate that partially purified Xenopus p42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphorylates bacterially expressed human c-Jun at a single site, serine 243. Several lines of evidence argue that this phosphorylation is due to p42 MAP kinase itself rather than some contaminating species. Phosphorylation of serine 243 markedly decreases the binding of c-Jun to oligonucleotides containing the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element. These findings suggest that MAP kinase may play a role in the down-regulation of c-Jun or in the cycle of transcriptional initiation and elongation.
