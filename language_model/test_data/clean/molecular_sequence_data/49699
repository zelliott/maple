We deleted the two C-terminal residues of the scorpion toxin BmTx3, a peptidyl inhibitor of a transient A-type K(+) current in striatum neurons in culture, to assess their contribution to receptor recognition. The sBmTX3-delYP analog was shown to have a native-like structure in one-dimensional 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We found that sBmTX3-delYP bound to its receptor less efficiently than the wild-type molecule (by a factor of about 10(5)) in binding assays with rat brain membranes, and that this molecule did not block the A-type K(+) current (at a concentration of 35 microM) in whole-cell patch clamp experiments with striatum neurons. Also, these results show that the A-type K(+) channel blocked by BmTX3 should have a canonical K(+) channel pore structure.
