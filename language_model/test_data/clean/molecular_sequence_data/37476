Anti-DNA autoantibodies are one of the frequently found autoantibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus patient sera. RNA aptamers for the monoclonal G6-9 anti-DNA autoantibody were selected from a random pool of RNA library. Binding affinity of the best aptamer is around 2nM, which is at least 100-fold higher than that of cognate DNA antigen to the autoantibody. Aptamer binds specifically to the G6-9 autoantibody but not to other similar autoantibodies. Minimal binding motif of the aptamer was mapped, providing a hint for a natural epitope of the autoantibody. DNA binding to the G6-9 autoantibody is shown to be efficiently inhibited by the aptamer. Such binding property of the RNA aptamer could be used not only as a modulator for the pathogenic anti-DNA autoantibody, but also as a useful biochemical reagent for elucidating a fine specificity of the autoantibody-nucleic acid interaction.
