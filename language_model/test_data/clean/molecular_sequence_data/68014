An index marker map of chromosome 9 has been constructed using the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain reference pedigrees. The map comprises 26 markers, with a maximum intermarker interval of 13.1 cM and only two intervals > 10 cM. Placement of all but one marker into the map was achieved with > 10,000:1 odds. The sex-equal length is 151 cM, with male length of 121 cM and female length of 185 cM. The map extends to within 2%-3% of physical length at the telomeres, and its coverage therefore is expected to be within 20-30 cM of full map length. The markers are all of the GT/CA repeat type and have average heterozygosity .77, with a range of .60-.89. The map shows both marked contraction of genetic distance relative to physical distance in the pericentromeric region and expansion in the telomeric regions. Genotypic data were carefully examined for errors by using the crossover routine of the program DATAMAN. Five new mutations were observed among 17,316 meiotic events examined. There were two double-crossover events occurring within an interval of 0-10 cM, and another eight were observed within an interval of 10-20 cM. Many of these could be due to additional mutational events in which one parental allele converted to the other by either gene conversion or random strand slippage. When there was no correction for these possible mutational events, the number of crossovers displayed by the maternal and paternal chromosomes was significantly different (P < .001) from that predicted by the Poisson distribution, which would be expected in the absence of interference. In addition, the observed crossover distribution for paternally derived chromosomes was similar to that predicted from cytogenetic chiasma frequency observations. In all, the data strongly support the occurrence of strong positive interference on human chromosome 9 and suggest that flanking markers at an interval of < or = 20 cM are generally sufficient for disease gene inheritance predictions in presymptomatic genetic counseling by linkage analysis.
