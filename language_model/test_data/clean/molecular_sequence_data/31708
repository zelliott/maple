A novel chemoheterotrophic, aerobic, Gram-negative, rod-shaped, yellow-pigmented, bacterial strain JLT2010(T) was isolated from deep seawater of the South China Sea. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain JLT2010(T) belongs to the family Flavobacteriaceae and is most closely related to Ulvibacter antarcticus IMCC3101(T) with 95.7 % similarity. Some phenotypic characteristics such as the absence of flexirubin-type pigments, growth at 37 Â°C, hydrolysis of casein differentiated strain JLT2010(T) from the genus Ulvibacter as well as other genera in the family Flavobacteriaceae. The DNA G+C content of the strain JLT2010(T) was found to be 35.7 mol% and the major respiratory quinone was found to be MK-6. On the basis of phenotypic and phylogenetic features, JLT2010(T) is classified as a novel genus and species within the family Flavobacteriaceae, for which the name Altuibacter lentus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is JLT2010(T) (=JCM 18884(T) = CGMCC 1.12167(T)).
