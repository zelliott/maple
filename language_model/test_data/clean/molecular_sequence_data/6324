We have cloned, from Dictyostelium discoideum, a cDNA encoding a new heat-shock (HS) protein (Hsp) with a predicted molecular mass of 31,447 Da. Outside of its low molecular mass, this Hsp does not share any similarity with the small Hsp currently identified or with alpha-crystallins. Northern blot analysis indicates that this HS-inducible gene is also developmentally regulated </p>.
