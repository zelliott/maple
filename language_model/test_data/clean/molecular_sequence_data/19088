Six influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were detected in Sapporo, Japan, between November and December 2013. All six viruses possessed an H275Y substitution in the neuraminidase protein, which confers cross-resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir. No epidemiological link among the six cases could be identified; none of them had received neuraminidase inhibitors before specimen collection. The haemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the six viruses were closely related to one another, suggesting clonal spread of a single resistant virus.
