DNA-DNA hybridisation experiments between isolates representing Burkholderia cepacia genomovar III recA lineages IIIA and IIIB reinforced the classification of both phylogenetic subgroups as a single genospecies, distinct from B. cepacia (genomovar I). A formal classification of B. cepacia genomovar III encompassing the recA lineages IIIA and IIIB, and the new recA lineages IIIC and IIID, as B. cenocepacia sp. nov., with LMG 16656 as the type strain, is proposed.
