This study assesses whether the phylogenetic relationships between SODs from different organisms could assist in elucidating the functional relationships among these enzymes from evolutionarily distinct species. Phylogenetic trees and intron positions were compared to determine the relationships among these enzymes. Alignment of Cu/ZnSOD amino acid sequences indicates high homology among plant sequences, with some features that distinguish chloroplastic from cytosolic Cu/ZnSODs. Among eukaryotes, the plant SODs group together. Alignment of the Mn and FeSOD amino acid sequences indicates a higher degree of homology within the group of MnSODs (>70%) than within FeSODs (approximately 60%). Tree topologies are similar and reflect the taxonomic classification of the corresponding species. Intron number and position in the Cu/Zn Sod genes are highly conserved in plants. Genes encoding cytosolic SODs have seven introns and genes encoding chloroplastic SODs have eight introns, except the chloroplastic maize Sod1, which has seven. In Mn Sod genes the number and position of introns are highly conserved among plant species, but not among nonplant species. The link between the phylogenetic relationships and SOD functions remains unclear. Our findings suggest that the 5' region of these genes played a pivotal role in the evolution of function of these enzymes. Nevertheless, the system of SODs is highly structured and it is critical to understand the physiological differences between the SODs in response to different stresses in order to compare their functions and evolutionary history.
