Extensive immunoreactivity (IR) towards a hexapeptide (sequence KGQELE), which flanks the C-terminus of the pancreastatin sequence in rat chromogranin A (CGA), is found throughout the nervous system of the nematode parasite Ascaris suum. The peptide IR was purified from the gonoduct of the parasite and found to have the sequence TKQELE. This peptide, designated TE-6, has some C-terminal homology with several regions of the CGA molecule. However, TE-6 was the only peptide isolated suggesting that either the nematode does not possess CGA, or that the -ELE regions of parasite CGA-like peptides which would be larger than TE-6 are not accessible to the antiserum in RIA, or are not being successfully extracted from the parasite. The N-terminus of TE-6 has little homology with any of the sequences preceding -ELE regions in CGA. This, and the fact that the tissue from which TE-6 was isolated does not contain IR towards another, highly conserved, region of the CGA molecule (WE-14) suggests that TE-6 may belong to a new class of regulatory peptide unrelated to CGA.
