The 5' flanking sequences, exon 1 and part of intron 1 of the human cathepsin D (CTD)-encoding gene (CTD) have been cloned and sequenced. RNase protection experiments identified two major transcription start points (tsp) located 14 and 63 nucleotides upstream of the start codon. The proximal -14, but not the distal -63 tsp has upstream near-concensus TATAAA and CCAAT sequences. Estrogens increase transcription from the -14 tsp, but not the -63 tsp and CTD is therefore unique among estrogen-regulated genes in having estrogen-regulated and constitutive transcription. Sequencing approximately 800 bp upstream and 600 bp downstream of the tsp failed to identify a consensus 13-bp palindromic estrogen-response element (ERE); however, four half-palindrome GGTCA motifs were located within 340 bp upstream of the -14 bp tsp. Thus, estrogen regulation of CTD may not be mediated by a consensus ERE.
