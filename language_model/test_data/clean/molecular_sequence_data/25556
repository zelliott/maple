Within the genome of human polyomavirus BK (BKV), there exists a noncoding regulatory region toward the late region side of the origin of DNA replication. In most BKV strains isolated by viral culture, this regulatory region contains tandem repeats varying in size. Recently, however, several laboratories isolated new BKV strains (designated as archetypal strains) lacking such repeat sequences. To examine the genetic relationship between archetypal strains, a phylogenetic tree was constructed for seven BKV strains, including three archetypal strains, from DNA sequence data on the late genes, those for leader protein (agnoprotein), and those for structural proteins (VP1, VP2, and VP3). For three strains data previously reported were used, whereas for the others sequences were determined in this study. From total numbers of nucleotide substitutions in each pair of strains, a phylogenetic tree was constructed by the unweighted pair-group method. The phylogenetic tree obtained reveals that BKV strains containing the archetypal regulatory region do not constitute a cluster of closely related strains and that these strains, together with those carrying the major part of the archetypal regulatory region, are widespread in the BKV population. This finding suggests that the basic structure of the archetypal regulatory region has been conserved in the course of BKV evolution.
