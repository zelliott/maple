Structures of arisostatins A and B were determined by spectroscopic analyses. Arisostatins were found to be new analogs of tetrocarcin A and possess an iso-butanoyldigitoxose unit instead of the acetyldigitoxose one. NMR analyses of arisostatins and tetrocarcin A led to the revision of the anomeric configurations in the tetrasaccharide moiety of tetrocarcin A.
