Vertebrate photoreceptor outer segment (OS) morphogenesis requires peripherin/rds (P/rds). We have characterized this protein's C-terminus and present evidence that suggests it is intrinsically disordered. We propose that structural flexibility may underlie the multifunctionality proposed for this domain previously. The extremely short C-termini present in other tetraspanin family members suggest that intrinsic disorder may also play a role for those proteins.
