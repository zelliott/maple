The gene encoding cytochrome c553 from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough was cloned by using two synthetic deoxyoligonucleotide probes. The amino acid sequence derived from the sequence of the gene differs from that reported by Bruschi and LeGall (Biochim. Biophys. Acta 271:48-60, 1972). Renewed protein sequencing confirmed the correctness of the DNA-derived sequence. The gene sequence indicates cytochrome c553 to be synthesized as a precursor protein with an NH2-terminal signal sequence of 24 residues.
