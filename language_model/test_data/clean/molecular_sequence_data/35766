Human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with specific benign and malignant lesions of the epithelial and mucosal surfaces. Of the sexually transmitted types, HPV type 16 (HPV-16) is the most commonly associated with carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Expression of the E6/E7 open reading frame of the viral genome is considered critical in the development of neoplasia. Using the CaSki cervical carcinoma cell line as a model system, we have adapted the polymerase chain reaction to quantify the transcripts expressed from this region. It was found that 97.1% of the total spliced transcript is E6*I, which putatively encodes the E7 oncoprotein, while E6*II comprises 2.9% of spliced product. The ratio of E6*I to E6*II expression may be an important parameter in evaluating the disease risk associated with HPV-16 infection.
