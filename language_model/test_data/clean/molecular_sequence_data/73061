A cDNA encoded a 462-amino acid protein, which showed CDP-diacylglycerol synthase (CDS) activity was cloned for the first time as the vertebrate enzyme molecule from rat brain cDNA library. The deduced molecular mass of this rat CDS was 53 kDa, and putative primary structure included several possible membrane- spanning regions. At the amino acid sequence level, rat CDS shared 55.5%, 31. 7%, and 20.9% identity with already known Drosophila, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Escherichia coli CDS, respectively. This rat CDS preferred 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl phosphatidic acid as a substrate, and its activity was strongly inhibited by phosphatidylglycerol 4, 5-bisphosphate. By immunoblotting analysis of COS cells overexpressed with the epitope-tagged for rat CDS, a 60-kDa band was detected. By epitope-tag immunocytochemistry, the CDS protein was mainly localized in close association with the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum of the transfected cells. The intense mRNA expression of CDS was localized in the cerebellar Purkinje cells, the pineal body, and the inner segment of photoreceptor cells. Additionally, very intense expression was detected in postmitotic spermatocytes and spermatids.
