Chemical cross-linking of dinitrogenase reductase and dinitrogenase reductase ADP-ribosyltransferase (DRAT) from Rhodospirillum rubrum has been investigated with a cross-linking system utilizing two reagents, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide and sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide. Cross-linking between dinitrogenase reductase and DRAT requires the presence of NAD, the cellular ADP-ribose donor, or a NAD analog containing an unmodified nicotinamide group, such as nicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotide. NADP, which will not replace NAD in the modification reaction, does support cross-linking between dinitrogenase reductase and DRAT. The DRAT-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of dinitrogenase reductase is inhibited by sodium chloride, as is the cross-linking between dinitrogenase reductase and DRAT, suggesting that ionic interactions are required for the association of these two proteins. Cross-linking is specific for native, unmodified dinitrogenase reductase, in that both oxygen-denatured and ADP-ribosylated dinitrogenase reductase fail to form a cross-linked complex with DRAT. The ADP-bound and adenine nucleotide-free states of dinitrogenase reductase form cross-linked complexes with DRAT; however, cross-linking is inhibited when dinitrogenase reductase is in its ATP-bound state.
