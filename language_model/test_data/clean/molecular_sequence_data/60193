Two new cycloartane-type glycosides, named aquilegiosides A and B, were isolated from the dried aerial parts of Aquilegia flabellata Sieb.et Zucc.var flabellata (Ranunculaceae). Their chemical structures have been characterized as 22S-3beta,16alpha,29-trihydroxy-cycloart-24-en-26,22-olid e 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1--->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1--->2)-alpha- L-arabinopyranoside and 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1--->2)-alpha-L-arabinopyranoside, by chemical and spectroscopic evidence.
