A hexaosyl fragment of the major component of lipooligosaccharide HS-142-1, O-(3-O-caproyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-(1-->6)-[O-(beta-D- glucopyranosyl)-(1-->6)-O-(3-O-caproyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-(1--> 6)]2-D-glucopyranose (1), was efficiently synthesized by block synthesis. More stable analogs, O-(3-O-hexyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-(1-->6)-[O-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)- (1-->6)-O-(3-O-hexyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-(1-->6)]2-D-glucopyranose (4) and O-(3-O-caproyl-2,4,6-tri-O-methyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-(1-->6)-[O- (2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-(1-->6)-O-(3-O-caproyl-2,4-di -O- methyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-(1-->6)]2-2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-D-glucopyrano se (2), were also designed and synthesized in a similar manner.
