In Escherichia coli synthesis of several proteins is transiently depressed upon heat shock treatment. A comparison of nucleotide sequences of the genes encoding these proteins revealed the occurrence of a consensus sequence, GAGGAA(N)3-6ATG, in their translation start signal region. To examine whether this sequence is involved in heat shock-induced depression of protein synthesis, DNA segments corresponding to this region of four of these genes, fusA, rpoB, glnS, and pheT, were synthesized, and each of them was fused in frame with the lacZ gene on the open reading frame vector pORF1. The effect of heat shock on the synthesis of beta-galactosidase encoded by these fused genes was then studied in E. coli. It was thus found that beta-galactosidase synthesis starting from the inserted translation start signal was arrested transiently upon temperature shift-up from 30 to 42 degrees C. I conclude that the heat shock-induced depression of gene expression is an event taking place at the initiation of translation.
