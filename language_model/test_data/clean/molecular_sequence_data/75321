A DNA library from a virulent strain of Mycobacterium bovis was constructed in the expression vector lambda gt11, and the library was probed with antisera to M. bovis. Clones expressing M. bovis antigens were isolated and characterized by using M. bovis-specific monoclonal antibodies that recognize a 22,000-molecular-weight protein (MPB70). MPB70 is a major protein antigen of the vaccine strain of M. bovis BCG and of virulent M. bovis, the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis. Of 32 clones selected by using polyclonal affinity-purified anti-M. bovis sera, 5 were recognized by the anti-MPB-70 monoclonal antibodies, and one monoclonal antibody, SB10, recognized all 5 clones. Characterization of these clones showed that one clone containing a 253-base-pair insert expressed a polypeptide bound by all of the MPB70-specific monoclonal antibodies. Western blots (immunoblots) showed that this cloned protein was recognized by sera from M. bovis-infected cattle, although not all cattle with bovine tuberculosis produced antibodies reactive to this clone. DNA sequencing of the clone showed that it coded for 84 amino acids from positions 17 to 114 of the 161-amino-acid protein, with a 16-peptide deletion between positions 79 and 94. Apart from this deletion, there were seven other variations between the cloned sequence and that deduced from M. bovis BCG MPB70.
