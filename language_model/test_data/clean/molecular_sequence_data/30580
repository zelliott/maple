Two prolactin-like proteins (bPLP-I and bPLP-II) were deduced from the nucleotide sequence analyses of the cDNA clones derived from a bovine (Bos taurus) term placenta. These proteins resembled bovine prolactin but were different from the reported bovine placental lactogens or prolactin-related proteins. The predicted amino acid sequences of these clones showed 45-51% identity with bovine prolactin and 23-24% with bovine growth hormone. The two new clones show 62 and 39% overall homology with each other at the levels of nucleotide and amino acid sequences, respectively. bPLP-I, bPLP-II, placental lactogens, prolactins (PRLs), and other prolactin-like proteins isolated from cow, mouse, and rat share 7 common amino acid residues. Five of the 7 residues are conserved by other members of the family such as growth hormones, suggesting that they may be essential for the common structural features of the gene family. The other 2 residues are uniquely conserved in bovine, mouse, and rat placental lactogens, PRLs, and PRL-like proteins, predicting their indispensable roles in binding to the specific receptors. bPLP-I and bPLP-II, as well as bPLP-III, are shown to be expressed stage specifically and predominantly in full-term bovine placentas.
