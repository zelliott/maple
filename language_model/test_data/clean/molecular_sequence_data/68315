Hydrolysis of spinach-leaf cell walls with Driselase (a fungal enzyme preparation) released two arabino-oligosaccharides and one galactobiose, each carrying a ferulic acid moiety. The oligosaccharides were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, methylation analysis, and FABMS. They were O-(2-O-trans-feruloyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl)-(1-->5)-L-arabinof uranose, O-(6-O-trans-feruloyl-beta-D-galactopyranosyl)-(1-->4)-D-galactopy ranose, and O-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl-(1-->3)-O-(2-O-trans-feruloyl-alpha-L-a rabino- furanosyl)-(1-->5)-L-arabinofuranose.
