Transcriptional regulation by the androgen receptor (AR) requires its binding to hormone response element nucleotide sequences in DNA. A consensus glucocorticoid response element (GRE) can mediate transactivation by AR and other members of the AR/glucocorticoid (GR)/progesterone (PR)/mineralocorticoid (MR) receptor subfamily. We identified putative androgen response element (ARE) sequences by binding of a human AR DNA-binding domain fusion protein to DNA in a random sequence selection assay. A 17-base pair consensus nucleotide sequence, termed IDR17, containing three potential GRE-like core binding sites organized as both inverted and direct repeats, was determined from a pool of degenerate oligonucleotides. IDR17 was active in mediating androgen-dependent induction of reporter gene expression in transient transfection assays. Dissection of the IDR17 sequence revealed an 11-base pair sequence (DR-1), consisting of two potential core binding sites oriented as an overlapping direct repeat, as the most potent ARE. DR-1 demonstrated a strong preference for AR binding and transactivation when compared with GR. To our knowledge, this is the first observation that a direct repeat of GRE-like core motifs functions as a preferred hormone response element within the AR/GR/PR/MR subfamily of nuclear receptors.
