Protein C Yonago is a dysfunctional protein C characterized by defective anticoagulant activity determined by a coagulation assay and normal amidolytic activity measured on a synthetic substrate S-2366 (Iijima et al., Thromb Res 1991;63:249-257). We have identified a single point mutation of C to G in codon 57 (CGG-->GGG) of the gene for protein C Yonago by genetic analysis utilizing the polymerase chain reaction. The mutation should have resulted in an amino acid substitution of Gly for Arg at position 15 of the light chain of mature protein C. No mutations were found in nucleotides spanning the putative gamma-carboxylase recognition site or gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues of protein C. Protein C Yonago was non-reactive to monoclonal antibodies JTC-1 and -3 that solely recognized the calcium-dependent conformation of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain. This indicated that the mutation had critically perturbed the highly conserved structure of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain. Thus, the calcium-dependent conformation required for the phospholipids binding to exert the physiological functions of protein C may not have been elicited normally in this abnormal protein C, resulting in defective generation of anticoagulant activities in plasma. Consequently, no anticoagulant activities may have been generated in vivo.
