Australian grapevine viroid (AGV, 369 residues) is a novel viroid with less than 50% sequence similarity with any known viroid. Nevertheless its entire sequence can be divided into regions, each with a high sequence similarity with segments from one of citrus exocortis, potato spindle tuber, apple scar skin, and grapevine yellow speckle viroids. AGV contains the entire central conserved region of the apple scar skin viroid group and is proposed as a member of this group. AGV appears to have originated from extensive RNA recombination involving other viroids. The vegetatively propagated grapevines which have been exposed to multiple viroid infections during their long history of cultivation may have allowed such recombination.
