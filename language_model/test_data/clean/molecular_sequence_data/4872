We report a case of Glanzmann thrombasthenia in a Pakistani child whose platelets express less than 10% of the normal amount of alphaIIb beta3 on their surface. Single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis of the exons of the patient's alphaIIb and beta3 genes showed an abnormality in exon 4 of the beta3 gene. Direct sequence analysis showed that the patient was homozygous for a T --> G nucleotide substitution in this exon, resulting in the replacement of a highly conserved Leu at position 117 with Trp. Heterologous expression of alphaIIb beta3 containing the beta3 mutation in COS-1 cells confirmed the pathogenicity of the Leu117 --> Trp substitution and showed that it resulted in the intracellular retention of malfolded alphaIIb beta3 heterodimers. Additional site-directed mutagenesis at position 117 indicated that, although the smaller hydrophobic amino acid Val could be substituted for the wild-type Leu, the larger hydrophobic amino acids Trp and Phe or the charged amino acids Asp and Lys were not tolerated. These studies indicate that Leu117 in beta3 plays a critical role in attaining the correct folded conformation of alphaIIb beta3. These studies also suggest that the hydrophobic side chain of Leu117 is likely folded into the interior of beta3, where it serves to stabilize internal packing of the protein and determines its overall shape.
