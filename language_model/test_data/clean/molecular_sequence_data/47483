A gene that exhibits sexually induced transcript accumulation, mtd1, was identified physically linked to a locus that is also under control of the mating-type genes. Genomic and cDNA sequence analyses were performed to determine a large open reading frame which starts with the amino-acid sequence M-A-T-E-D. The ORF showed similarities to a novel family of peptide transporters with at least 12 putative transmembrane structures. A gene disruption resulted in a growth-phenotype with slow aerial mycelium formation that could be complemented with peptone or uracil added to the growth medium.
