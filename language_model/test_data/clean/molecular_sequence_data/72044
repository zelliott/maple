In vitro, the S100B protein interacts with baculovirus recombinant p53 protein and protects p53 from thermal denaturation. This effect is isoform-specific and is not observed with S100A1, S100A6, or calmodulin. Using truncated p53 proteins in the N-terminal (p53(1-320)) and C-terminal (p53(73-393)) domains, we localized the S100B-binding region to the C-terminal region of p53. We have confirmed a calcium-dependent interaction of the S100B with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal region of p53 (residues 319-393 in human p53) using plasmon resonance experiments on a BIAcore system. In the presence of calcium, the equilibrium affinity of the S100B for the C-terminal region of p53 immobilized on the sensor chip was 24 +/- 10 nM. To narrow down the region within p53 involved in S100B binding, two synthetic peptides, O1(357-381) (residues 357-381 in mouse p53) and YF-O2(320-346) (residues 320-346 in mouse p53), covering the C-terminal region of p53 were compared for their interaction with purified S100B. Only YF-O2 peptide interacts with S100B with high affinity. The YF-O2 motif is a critical determinant for the thermostability of p53 and also corresponds to a domain responsible for cytoplasmic sequestration of p53. Our results may explain the rescue of nuclear wild type p53 activities by S100B in fibroblast cell lines expressing the temperature-sensitive p53val135 mutant at the nonpermissive temperature.
