The structure and distribution of a Mycobacterium bovis BCG insertion element of the IS21 family were investigated. Several IS21-like elements found in mycobacterial genomes were separated in four types, following their nucleic acid similarities. The M. bovis BCG IS21 element is highly similar to IS1533 (class I), 70% similar to IS1534 (class II), 52% similar to IS1532 (class III) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and 54% similar to both an Mycobacterium avium serovar 2 and an M. avium silvaticum IS (class IV). The M. bovis BCG IS21 element of the class I appears to be present in a single copy in the genome of M. bovis BCG, M. bovis, M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium africanum and to be absent from all other tested species of the Corynebacteria-Mycobacteria-Nocardia group.
