Recent advances in the development of electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) now permit the near routine analysis of oligonucleotides and intact nucleic acids. These developments have led to the use of mass spectrometry (MS) as a detection platform for genomics studies. Among the various uses of mass spectrometry in genomics, applications focused on the characterization of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and short tandem repeats (STRs) are particularly well-suited to MALDI or ESI-based analysis. It is predicted that continued developments in methodology and instrumentation will further improve the capabilities of mass spectrometry for nucleic acid analysis.
