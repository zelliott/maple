This article reviews the many difficulties met in the development of an effective vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), including the considerable antigenic variability of the virus, its intracellular mode of transmission, its mucosal port of entry, and the persistent nature of the infection. Progresses in the development of prototype vaccines in animal models are discussed together with the results of initial clinical trials in human volunteers.
