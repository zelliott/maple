The ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) is the first enzyme in the pathway leading to formation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates. E1 was found to be phosphorylated in cells of a mouse mammary carcinoma cell line, FM3A. Peptide mapping of trypsin digests of labeled E1 indicated that two oligopeptides were mainly phosphorylated in vivo. The same oligopeptides were also labeled in vitro on Cdc2 kinase-mediated phosphorylation of E1, affinity-purified from the same cell line. The Cdc2 kinase is a key enzyme playing a pivotal role in G2/M transition in the cell cycle. The phosphorylation of one of the two oligopeptides was prominent at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, and dependent upon the Cdc2 kinase activity in vivo since it was significantly reduced in tsFT210, a mutant cell line deficient in Cdc2 kinase. Mutation analysis indicated that the serine residue at the fourth position of the E1 enzyme was a phosphorylation site of Cdc2 kinase. These findings suggest that E1 is a target of Cdc2 kinase in the cell, implying that the ubiquitin system may be dynamically involved in cell cycle control through phosphorylation of this key enzyme.
