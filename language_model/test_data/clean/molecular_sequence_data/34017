The Letter describes a strategy for the enzymatic synthesis of glycans based on a pH-responsive water-soluble polymer. In neutral condition, the polymer is water-soluble and convenient for in-solution enzymatic synthesis, whereas in acidic condition (pH lower than 4.0), the polymer disconnects with the product and becomes insoluble, which can be easily removed. A 6-Sialyl lactose analogue was synthesized as a model reaction using this approach.
