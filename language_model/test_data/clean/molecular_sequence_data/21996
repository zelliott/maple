Formation of iron/sulfur (Fe/S) clusters, protein translocation and protein folding are essential processes in the mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In a systematic approach to characterize essential proteins involved in these processes, we identified a novel essential protein of the mitochondrial matrix, which is highly conserved from yeast to human and which we termed Isd11. Depletion of Isd11 caused a strong reduction in the levels of the Fe/S proteins aconitase and the Rieske protein, and a massive decrease in the enzymatic activities of aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase. Incorporation of iron into the Fe/S protein Leu1 and formation of the Fe/S cluster containing holoform of the mitochondrial ferredoxin Yah1 were inhibited in the absence of Isd11. This strongly suggests that Isd11 is required for the assembly of Fe/S proteins. We show that Isd11 forms a stable complex with Nfs1, the cysteine desulfurase of the mitochondrial machinery for Fe/S cluster assembly. In the absence of Isd11, Nfs1 is prone to aggregation. We propose that Isd11 acts together with Nfs1 in an early step in the biogenesis of Fe/S proteins.
