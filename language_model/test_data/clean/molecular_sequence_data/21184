In animals, Tandem CCCH Zinc Finger (TZF) proteins control a variety of cellular processes via regulation of gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Plant-unique TZF proteins can also affect many aspects of plant growth, development, and stress responses. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying plant TZF function are unknown. The purpose of this short review is to provide an overview of genetic and molecular analyses of plant TZFs, and to speculate on their possible molecular functions.
