Cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) are frequently related to endocarditis. Most cases of intravascular CIED infections are usually related to skin flora, but a few cases may occur with negative blood culture. Coxiella burnetii is one of the main causes of blood culture-negative endocarditis in native and prosthetic valves, but to date no cases related to CIED have been published. Herein we report two cases of Q fever endocarditis related to these non-valvular cardiovascular devices.
