The kinetic mechanism of the pp60c-src tyrosine kinase (src TK) reaction was investigated in the forward and reverse directions. In the forward direction, initial velocities obtained by varying ATP and the peptide (FGE)3Y(GEF)2GD indicated a sequential addition of the two substrates. The peptide analog, (FGE)3F(GEF)2GD, was a competitive inhibitor versus the peptide substrate and a noncompetitive inhibitor versus MgATP. Interestingly, the tyrosine hydroxyl group imparts only a 6-fold increase in binding. AMP-PCP was a competitive inhibitor versus MgATP and a noncompetitive inhibitor versus the peptide substrate. These results prove that the addition of substrates is random. Furthermore, there appears to be little binding synergy as the KiMgATP approximately equal to 2.4KmMgATP. The phosphorylated peptide (FGE)3-pY-(GEF)2GD was a competitive inhibitor versus peptide and a noncompetitive inhibitor against MgATP, suggesting that a dead end complex can form between MgATP, the phosphorylated peptide product, and the enzyme. The reverse reaction was investigated by varying ADP and the phosphopeptide. (FGE)3-pY-(GEF)2GD. The initial velocity pattern was indicative of a sequential mechanism. There was even less binding synergy in the reverse direction as the KiMgADP approximately equal to 1.4KmMgADP. AMP-CP was a competitive inhibitor versus MgADP and a noncompetitive inhibitor versus the phosphopeptide. (FGE)3F(GEF)2GD was a competitive inhibitor versus the phosphopeptide and a noncompetitive inhibitor versus MgADP. These data prove that addition of the substrates in the reverse direction is random. (FGE)3Y(GEF)2GD was a competitive inhibitor against peptide substrate and a noncompetitive inhibitor against MgADP; therefore a dead end complex can form between MgADP, (FGE)3Y(GEF)2GD, and the enzyme. These results indicate that the src TK reaction follows a sequential bi-biequilibrium random mechanism in both directions, with dead end complexes forming when either MgATP and (FGE)3-pY-(GEF)2GD or MgADP and (FGE)3Y(GEF)2GD bind to the enzyme. The kinetic constants determined from the forward and reverse reactions were used in the Haldane equation to determine a K(eq) constant for the forward reaction of 10.1, corresponding to a delta G of -1.4 kcal/mol. This further confirms that the O-P bond of phosphotyrosine is similar in energy to that of the gamma-phosphoryl of MgATP.
