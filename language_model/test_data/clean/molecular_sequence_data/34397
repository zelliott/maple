In hymenoptera venom allergy, about 75% of detected in vitro double positivity to yellow jacket and honeybee venom is ascribed to specific IgE (sIgE) directed against cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCDs). To date, for the detection of CCD-sIgE, different carbohydrate antigens and methods are used. The most suitable one still has to be identified.

Eighty-seven patients with confirmed hymenoptera venom allergy and venom sIgE values of â‰¥0.7 kU/l were investigated. Sixty-five patients showed sIgE reactivity to both yellow jacket and honeybee venom, 22 were venom mono positive and served as controls. Occurrence of CCD-sIgE was determined using bromelain, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and MUXF(3) on system A, and ascorbic acid oxidase (AAO), bromelain and HRP on system B. Further, a reference standard for CCD-sIgE evaluation was created: CCD positivity was assumed when at least 4 of the 6 test results were positive.

According to the defined reference standard, 45/65 venom double positive patients exhibited CCD-sIgE. Using system A, comparison with the reference standard revealed sensitivity and specificity values of 96 and 97%, respectively, for MUXF(3), 100 and 100%, respectively, for bromelain, and 96 and 97%, respectively, for HRP. Using system B, sensitivity and specificity was 98 and 97%, respectively, for AAO, 62 and 95%, respectively, for bromelain, and 96 and 69%, respectively, for HRP. Results of the 3 test allergens obtained with system A showed strong correlations (r = 0.932-0.976), whereas results with system B showed lower correlations (r = 0.714-0.898).

All 3 test allergens used with system A are suitable for CCD-sIgE detection in hymenoptera venom allergy. With system B, only AAO seems to be a reliable tool.
