We have purified DNA photolyase from the autotrophic anaerobic archaebacterium Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum to near homogeneity by a two-column affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme has an Mr = 60,000 and shows near UV absorption peak at 440 nm and a fluorescence emission maximum at 462 nm indicating that it contains 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin (coenzyme F420) as an intrinsic chromophore. The photolyase binds with high specificity to thymine dimer in DNA with an equilibrium binding constant, KA = 1.4 x 10(9) M-1, and a dissociation rate constant, koff = 1.4 x 10(-4) s-1 (t1/2 = 43 min). Despite 6-fold higher affinity compared to the folate-containing Escherichia coli photolyase the two enzymes apparently contact the same phosphates around the thymine dimer: the phosphate immediately 5' and the three phosphates immediately 3' to the dimer on the damaged strand and the phosphate across from the dimer in the minor groove on the complementary strand. The absolute action spectrum of the Methanobacterium photolyase in the 400-500-nm region closely matches the absorption of the enzyme-bound F420. The quantum yield (phi) over this region is constant and is approximately 0.2. The value is measurably smaller than the quantum yields reported for other DNA photolyases.
