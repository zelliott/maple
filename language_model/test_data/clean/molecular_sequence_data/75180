Yeast RNA polymerases are being extensively studied at the gene level. The entire gene encoding the largest subunit of RNA polymerase A, A190, was isolated and characterized in detail. Southern hybridization and gene disruption experiments showed that the RPA190 gene is unique in the haploid yeast genome and essential for cell viability. Nuclease S1 mapping was used to identify mRNA 5' and 3' termini. RPA190 encodes a polypeptide chain of 186,270 daltons in a large uninterrupted reading frame. A dot matrix comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of subunit A190 with Escherichia coli beta' and cognate subunits B220 and C160 from yeast RNA polymerases B and C showed a conserved pattern of homology regions (I-VI). A potential DNA-binding site (zinc-binding motif) is conserved in the N-terminal region I. Remarkably, the A190 subunit does not harbor the heptapeptide repeated sequence present in the B220 subunit. The sequence of the A190 subunit diverges from B220 and C160 by the presence of two hydrophilic domains inserted between homology regions I and II, and V and VI. From their codon usage and third base pyrimidine bias, RNA polymerase genes RPA190, RPB220, RPC160, and RPC40 fall among yeast genes expressed at an average level. The RPA190 5'-flanking region contains features present in other polymerase genes that might function in regulation.
