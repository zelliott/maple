SDS-PAGE analysis of luminal fluid from the ram testis and epididymis revealed a protein of about 105 kDa in the fluid in the caput epididymal region. The molecular mass of this fluid protein shifted from 105 kDa to 94 kDa in the distal caput epididymidis and remained at 94 kDa in the lower regions of the epididymis. The possible sperm origin of this protein was suggested by the decrease in intensity of a 105-kDa compound on the sperm plasma membrane extract and by its total disappearance from the fluid of animals with impaired sperm production caused by scrotal heating. The 94-kDa protein was purified from ram cauda epididymal fluid, and a rabbit polyclonal antiserum was obtained. This antiserum showed that membranes of testicular sperm and sperm from the initial caput were positive for the presence of an immunologically related antigen. The protein was immunolocalized mainly on the flagellar intermediate piece, whereas in some corpus and caudal sperm, only the apical ridge of the acrosomal vesicle was labeled. The purified protein was microsequenced: its N-terminal was not found in the sequence database, but its tryptic fragments matched the sequence of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). Indeed, the purified 94-kDa protein exhibited a carboxypeptidase activity inhibited by specific blockers of ACE. All the soluble seminal plasma ACE activity in the ram was attributable to the 94-kDa epididymal fluid ACE. The polyclonal antiserum also showed that a soluble form of ACE appeared specifically in the caput epididymal fluid of the boar, stallion, and bull. This soluble form was responsible for all the ACE activity observed in the fluid from the distal caput to the cauda epididymidis in these species. Our results strongly suggest that the epididymal fluid ACE derives from the germinal form of ACE that is liberated from the testicular sperm in a specific epididymal area.
