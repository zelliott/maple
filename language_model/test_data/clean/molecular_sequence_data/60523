cDNA clones encoding mitochondrial phosphate transporters were isolated from four herbaceous plants. The cDNAs for the soybean, maize and rice transporters contained entire coding regions, whereas the Arabidopsis cDNA lacked the 5' portion. The hydropathy profiles of the deduced amino acid sequences predicted the existence of six membrane-spanning domains which are highly conserved in the mitochondrial transporter family. In soybeans, the mRNA level for the transporter was high in tissues containing dividing cells. It was suggested that there are multiple copies of transporter genes in both dicots and monocots. The soybean transporter was expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli, solubilized with detergents, and then reconstituted into liposomes. The resulting proteoliposomes exhibited high phosphate transport activity. The activity was inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide, like those of mammalian phosphate transporters.
