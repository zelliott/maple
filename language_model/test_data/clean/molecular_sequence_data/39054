Expression of the human papillomavirus type 11 E1 and E2 genes is necessary and sufficient to support viral DNA replication. The full-length E2 protein is a transcriptional modulator that also interacts with the E1 helicase to form an E1/E2 complex at the viral origin of replication. Previous studies indicated that efficient binding of this complex to the replication origin is site-specific and that the E2 homodimer was required for efficient E1 binding. Human papillomavirus type 11 E2 and E1 proteins have been purified and their cooperative binding to the HPV type 11 viral replication origin has been characterized. Low-affinity E1 binding to the HPV type 11 replication origin was demonstrated and found to be largely nonspecific. DNA binding by E1 does not require complex formation with E2 and appears to be independent of ATP binding or hydrolysis. E1 binding quantitatively increased with the addition of increasing amounts of E2 and mutations in the E2 binding site demonstrated that the E2BS site is required for E1 and E2 to specifically bind as a high-affinity complex at the replication origin. Analysis of the A/T-rich E1 binding site via mutation showed that it was nonessential for high-affinity E1/E2 complex formation. Thus, although the replication functions between the animal and the human papillomaviruses are well conserved, there are subtle differences in the DNA binding requirements for E1, which may portend mechanistic differences among the DNA replication systems of various papillomavirus types.
