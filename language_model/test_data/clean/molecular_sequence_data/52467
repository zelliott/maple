Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA was found in cervicovaginal lavage fluids from 9 of 11 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-seropositive female prostitutes with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in Kinshasa, Zaire. Since 7 yielded complex nucleic acid hybridization results consistent with mixed HPV infections, limited sequencing of HPV DNA was used to identify the HPVs present. Three of HPV 16 and 1 each of HPV 18, 31, 33, and 56 and ME180-HPV were identified by sequencing in 8 samples. Each of these genotypes has been found in specimens from HIV-1-seronegative women with CIN. Some DNAs had nucleic acid and amino acid sequence variations relative to the reference HPVs, but the variants were closely related to variants that have been found in HIV-1-seronegative women. Variant amino acids were found predominantly at three positions in one 40-amino-acid segment of the L1 open reading frame sequenced. The predominant HPV 16 variant observed has been found rarely in other countries.
