We have prepared a series of biotinylated analogs of omega-conotoxin (omega CgTx) as potent, selective markers for N-type calcium channels. At pH 9.5, reaction of omega CgTx with amidocaproylbiotin succinimidyl ester gives three biotinylated conjugates, labeled at lysines 2 or 24, or at both positions. Kinetic competition assays of 125I-omega CgTx binding to rat brain synaptic membranes show that each conjugate has a similar rate constant for association (1-1.3 x 10(6) M-1 s-1) but not dissociation (1-4 x 10(-4) s-1). Comparison with rate constants obtained for the association (1.2 x 10(7) M-1 s-1) and dissociation (5 x 10(-5) s-1) of native omega CgTx indicates that while biotinylation reduces omega CgTx potency (Kdkin = k-2/k2 = 4 pM for omega CgTx), binding of these labels to membranes is nevertheless of very high affinity (Kdkin 0.1-0.3 nM).
