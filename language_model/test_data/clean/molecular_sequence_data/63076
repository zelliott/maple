Changed ion hydration properties near surfaces, proteins, and deoxyribose nucleic acid have been reported before in the literature. In the present work, we extend this work to carbohydrates: We have performed classical-mechanical molecular dynamics simulations to study solvation properties of simple cations of biological relevance (Na(+),K(+),Mg(2+),Ca(2+)) in explicit water, near single and multiple oligosaccharides as glycocalyx models. We find that our oligosaccharides prefer direct contact with K(+) over Na(+), but that the Na(+) contacts are longer lived. These interactions also lead to strong but short-lived changes in oligosaccharide conformations, with oligosaccharides wrapping around K(+) with multiple contacts. These findings may have implications for current hypotheses on glycocalyx functions.
