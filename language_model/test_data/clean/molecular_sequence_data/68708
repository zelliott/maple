We have developed a novel coincidence cloning strategy, termed Coincidence Painting, which enables the rapid generation of large numbers of region specific sequences. Coincidence Painting utilises Degenerate Oligonucleotide Primed PCR (DOP-PCR) amplification of flow sorted derivative translocation chromosomes. The PCR products are hybridised in situ onto specific flow sorted chromosomes for coincident sequence selection. Eluted and reamplified material is then cloned using a novel insert end revelation and ligation technique. Cloned inserts range in size from 150-1300 bps of which approximately 54% appear to be single copy sequences. The cloning method permits the excision of vector free probe for library hybridisation screening and the small insert size facilitates analysis for the generation of sequence tagged sites (STSs). We have used such clones successfully for YAC screening by PCR and for cosmid screening by filter hybridisation. This new methodology should allow the rapid saturation with probes of regions defined by specific translocation breakpoints.
