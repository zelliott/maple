The promoter elements important for intestinal and hepatic transcription of the human apoB gene have been localized downstream of nucleotide -150. Footprinting analysis using hepatic nuclear extracts identified four protected regions, -124 to -100, -97 to -93, -86 to -33, and +33 to +52. Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that multiple factors interact with the apoB sequence -86 to -33, while the region -88 to -61 binds a single nuclear factor. Methylation interference analysis and nucleotide substitution mutagenesis identified the binding site of the factor between residues -78 and -68. Binding competition experiments indicate that this factor recognizes the regulatory elements of other liver-specific genes.
