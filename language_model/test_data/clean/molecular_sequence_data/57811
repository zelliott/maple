The results suggest the feasibility of metabolic and behavioral interrelationships between ethanol (ET), certain neurotransmitter substances and major metabolites, some neuropeptides and/or psychoactive agents. This was indicated by the in vivo and in vitro effects of such authentic compounds on certain ET-elicited behavioral responses and on hepatic ET and acetaldehyde metabolizing enzymes in rats and mice.
