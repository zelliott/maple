We report the first example of peptide-protein heteronuclear two-dimensional (2D) saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance (STD NMR). This method, resulting in dramatically reduced overlap, was applied to the interaction of the integrin αvβ6 with a known peptide ligand and highlights novel contact points between the substrate and target protein.
