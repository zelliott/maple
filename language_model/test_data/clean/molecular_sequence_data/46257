Silencing of genes using small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a recently developed strategy to regulate the synthesis of target molecules. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) is a nuclear transcription factor that mediates Th2-type immunity.

To elucidate the therapeutic potential of using siRNA to inhibit STAT6 in allergic reactions, we determined the nucleotide sequences of siRNA specific for STAT6.

The selected sequences of STAT6 siRNA specifically inhibited the generation of STAT6 synthesis in dermal fibroblasts and eotaxin (CCL11) production in response to IL-4/TNF-Î± in vitro. Local administration of STAT6 siRNA in vivo alleviated contact hypersensitivity responses to chemical haptens. This was accompanied by reduced local production of IL-4, IL-13, eotaxin (CCL11), TARC (CCL17) and MDC (CCL22). Similarly, consecutive intranasal instillation of STAT6 siRNA markedly inhibited inflammatory cellular infiltration of mucosal tissues in allergic rhinitis responses in association with reduced IL-4 and IL-5 production from regional lymph node cells. Immediate responses, such as sneezing and nasal rubbing behaviors, were also improved by STAT6 siRNA.

Local administration of STAT6 siRNA is thus a promising therapeutic strategy for both Th2-mediated cutaneous diseases and allergic rhinitis.
