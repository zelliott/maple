Five genes involved in the two initial steps of the tetralin biodegradation pathway of Sphingomonas macrogolitabida strain TFA have been characterized. ThnA1A2 and ThnA3A4, components of the ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase, were encoded in divergently transcribed operons. ThnA1, ThnA2, and ThnA3 were essential for tetralin ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase activity. ThnB was identified as a dehydrogenase required for tetralin biodegradation.
