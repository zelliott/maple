Palate, lung, and nasal epithelium clone (Plunc, now renamed Splunc1) is a small secreted protein expressed in the oropharynx and upper airways of humans, mice, rats, and cows. This protein is structurally homologous to known mediators of host defense against gram-negative bacteria. We have characterized the genomic sequence and expression of a novel but closely related gene from rodents, which we call splunc5. Mouse Splunc5 sequence is 60% identical to mouse Splunc1. The genes also share highly conserved genomic elements including intron-exon structure and intronic sequence. Strikingly, splunc5 is expressed exclusively in the interpapillary epithelium of the tongue's dorsal surface. By comparing the expression profiles of splunc5, splunc1, and a third related sequence, lplunc1, in mice, we show that these genes are expressed in unique domains along a continuous corridor of oral, lingual, pharyngeal, and respiratory epithelia. This expression pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that these proteins protect epithelial surfaces colonized by potentially pathogenic microorganisms.
