Three strains of aerobic, Gram-negative, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, yellow-pigmented bacteria (OD1(T), YOx(T) and NS13), which were isolated in previous studies by enrichment in a mineral medium with potassium oxalate as the sole carbon source, were characterized. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strains OD1(T), YOx(T) and NS13 belong to the Betaproteobacteria, most closely related to Oxalicibacterium flavum TA17(T) (97.2-99.7% sequence similarity). The major whole-cell fatty acids were C(16:0), C(16:1)omega7c and C(17:0) cyclo. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization and physiological and biochemical tests allowed genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strains OD1(T) and YOx(T) from O. flavum TA17(T) and from each other. Therefore, it is concluded that the strains OD1(T) and YOx(T) represent novel species within the genus Oxalicibacterium, for which the names Oxalicibacterium horti sp. nov. (type strain OD1(T)=DSM 21640(T)=NBRC 13594(T)) and Oxalicibacterium faecigallinarum sp. nov. (type strain YOx(T)=DSM 21641(T)=CCM 2767(T)) are proposed.
