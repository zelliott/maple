Contractile responses to neurokinin A (NKA), neuropeptide gamma(NP gamma), and the NK2 receptor-selective analogs [Lys5,MeLeu9,Nle10]NKA(4-10) and MDL 28,564 were determined in the endothelium-denuded rabbit pulmonary artery. Responses to NKA, NP gamma, and [Lys5,MeLeu9,Nle10]NKA(4-10) were antagonized by the NK2 receptor antagonist MDL 29,913, with pA2 values of 6.67, 6.46, and 7.32, respectively. Autoradiographic studies failed to demonstrate any specific binding sites for [125I]-iodohistidyl NKA (INKA) over the pulmonary artery. These data suggest the presence in rabbit pulmonary artery of an unusual "nonclassical" NK2 receptor subtype, which appears to lack affinity for INKA.
