We recently reported the presence of several low-molecular-mass protein components in the PS II O2-evolving core complex from the thermophilic cyanobacterium, Synechococcus vulcanus [(1989) FEBS Lett. 244, 391-396]. Here we have characterized the three components (4.1, 4.7, 5 kDa) of the same cyanobacterial core complex by N-terminal sequencing. There were two components in the 4.7 kDa region, both having a blocked N-terminus. One has a sequence highly homologous to open reading frame 34 of plant chloroplast DNA (tentatively designated psbM), while the other has a sequence partially homologous to open reading frame 43 of chloroplast DNA (designated psbN), although neither of the two gene products has yet been confirmed in chloroplasts. The cyanobacterial 4.1 kDa protein partially corresponds to the 4.1 kDa nuclear-encoded core component of higher plant PS II. The cyanobacterial 5 kDa component, however, shows a sequence that is unrelated to any other known proteins.
