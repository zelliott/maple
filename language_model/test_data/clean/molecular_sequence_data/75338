Escherichia coli 30 S ribosomal subunits and 70 S ribosomes were treated with the bifunctional reagent diepoxybutane, acting as a cross-linker. One major cross-linked protein pair in the 30 S subunit was generated in relatively high yields. This cross-link was shown to consist of ribosomal proteins S13 and S19. Purification of this complex was achieved by a series of conventional and/or high pressure liquid chromatography techniques allowing its isolation in milligram quantities. To reveal the exact position of the two amino acids involved in the cross-link formation, the purified protein pair S13-S19 was subjected to several enzymatic fragmentations, and the resulting peptides were characterized by sequence analysis, amino acid analysis, and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. After isolation of the cross-linked peptides, Cys84 in protein S13 and His68 in S19 could be unequivocally identified as the amino acids cross-linked by the bifunctional reagent. This result demonstrates that, despite neutron scattering data which place the centers of mass of S13 and S19 85 A apart, at least these regions of the two proteins are located within a 4-A distance in the ribosomal particle.
