Responses to pituitary adenylate cyclase polypeptide (PACAP)-27, PACAP-38, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were compared in the peripheral and pulmonary vascular beds of the cat and in the isolated perfused neonatal pig heart. Intravenous injections of PACAP-27 and PACAP-38 produced biphasic changes in systemic arterial pressure whereas iv injections of VIP caused only decreases in arterial pressure. When blood flow to the hind limb and mesenteric vascular beds was maintained constant, PACAP-27 and PACAP-38 caused dose-related biphasic changes in perfusion pressure, whereas VIP only decreased perfusion pressure. PACAP-27 was approximately threefold more potent than PACAP-38, and the pressor component of the biphasic response was blocked by alpha-adrenergic antagonists and adrenalectomy. PACAP-27, PACAP-38, and VIP produced decreases in pulmonary vascular resistance, and all three peptides had significant vasodilator activity in the isolated perfused neonatal pig heart. Although all three peptides decreased coronary vascular resistance, only PACAP-27 and PACAP-38 increased left ventricular contractility, with PACAP-27 approaching isoproterenol in potency. The results of these experiments show that PACAP-27, PACAP-38, and VIP have significant effects on vasomotor tone that depend on the vascular bed studied and the contribution of adrenal catecholamines.
