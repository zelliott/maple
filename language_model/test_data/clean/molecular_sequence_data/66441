To characterize the alcohol-surviving bacterial isolate ARBG1 from in vitro grapes (Vitis vinifera).

Two bacterial strains that survived in covert form in grape cultures were isolated from the spent alcohol used for disinfecting the tools of which one (ARBG2) was characterized earlier. The present study describes characterization of the second isolate, ARBG1. Nutrient agar (NA)-derived colonies of ARBG1 displayed consistently Gram-negative staining rods (2-4x0.5-0.6 micro) substantiated by KOH mucoid thread test. Older cultures (3-7 days) showed emergence of Gram-negative staining, oblong, phase-refractile cells with ellipsoidal spores. The growth and sporulation were modified by growth medium and incubation temperature with the optimum around 37 degrees C. Identification attempts involving microscopic, biochemical, Biolog or fatty acid profiling approaches brought in mixed and inconclusive results. PCR amplification of 16S rDNA was not successful with the standard primers 27F and 1492R but with 27F and a modified primer ARBG1-RP1. The identity of the isolate was established as Brevibacillus sp. based on partial 16S rDNA sequence data from eight single colonies with Gram-positive Brevibacillus choshinensis as the closest match (99.5%). Spotting tests on NA employing spore suspension in aqueous ethanol (0%, 25%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or 90%, v/v) indicated unhindered bacterial-survival in alcohol for 1 month, and that at 2 or 4 months revealed 90% ethanol as more sporicidal than lower levels, corroborated by plating results. Grape microcuttings inoculated with ARBG1 showed substantial general colonization of shoots, roots and medium but low endophytic colonization.

The rare type of spore-producing consistently Gram-negative bacterial isolate ARBG1 was identified as Brevibacillus sp. based on 16S rDNA sequence similarity. The alcohol-defying organism was nonpathogenic and survived in covert form in grape cultures. Aqueous 90% ethanol appeared more sporicidal than lower levels.

Characterization of an unusual endospore-forming Gram-negative bacterium, observation that some bacteria may fall outside the purview of standard 16S rDNA primers, elucidation of the threats of covert bacteria in plant tissue cultures and alcohol-mediated lateral transmission of spore formers, and the revelation that 70-80% ethanol may not be the most effective bactericidal concentration for all bacteria.
