Pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 5 gene (PSG-5) belongs to the human pregnancy-specific glycoprotein family, encoded by eleven highly similar and transcriptionally active genes. High levels of PSG biosynthesis are restricted to the placenta syncytiotrophoblast and are essential for the maintenance of normal gestation in mammalian species. We have investigated here the nature of the transcription factors that recognize the FP1 (-455/-433) and the CPE (-147/-140) regulatory sequences that significantly contribute to basal PSG-5 promoter activity. Both elements bear a similar GT-box motif; and DNA-protein complex formation, as well as promoter activity, is largely dependent on the integrity of these GT-box sequences. Gel shift, super gel shift and UV-crosslinking experiments clearly demonstrate that the ubiquitous specificity protein 1 (Sp1) is the major transcription factor involved in complex formation with both cis-acting elements in normal term placenta tissue and in PSG-non-expressing COS-7 cells. Furthermore, transfection experiments indicate that Sp1 activates PSG-5 promoter constructs. In addition, we show that Sp1 is indeed co-expressed with PSG genes in the syncytiotrophoblast cells, stressing its potential role in the in vivo regulation of PSG expression.
