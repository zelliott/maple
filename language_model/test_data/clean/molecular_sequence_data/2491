The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a recently developed method whereby a specific DNA sequence in a complex mixture can be selectively amplified and visualized by ethidium bromide staining after electrophoresis. We have been able to perform PCR on DNA purified from paraffin-embedded tissues, as well as on crude DNA obtained by directly boiling deparaffinized thick sections. With the use of appropriate priming oligonucleotides, the presence of cytomegalovirus DNA in infected tissues can be detected with sensitivity and specificity in as short as 6 h, without the use of radioisotopes. Therefore, PCR may be a viable adjunct to culture techniques for detection of viral diseases, particularly in cases where fresh tissue is not available for analysis.
