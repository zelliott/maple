The stable L-ascorbic acid glucoside produced by the action of the cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase, EC 2.4.1.19) from Bacillus stearothermophilus was crystallized from an aqueous solution. Determination of the molecular structure by single crystal X-ray analysis showed the compound to be 2-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic acid (AA-2G). The crystals are orthorhombic, space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell dimensions a = 11.929 A, b = 24.351 A, and c = 4.864 A. The D-glucopyranose residue has the 4C1 conformation. These conclusions are in good agreement with those based on the 13C-NMR spectrum. The general physicochemical properties of crystalline AA-2G are reported.
