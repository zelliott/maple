Three individual peptide sequences, EVSHPKVG, WVTTSNQW, and SGGSNRSP, which have potentials to bind to Newcastle disease virus (NDV), were identified by the biopanning method using phage display technology. The binding specificities of these peptides presented on phages were confirmed by ELISA competition assay using chicken anti-NDV antiserum. The synthetic peptides designed based on these results partially neutralized the infection of NDV in vitro. The peptide-motives identified here have the potential to lead to the identification of novel molecules that inhibit the NDV infection independent of the immune system.
