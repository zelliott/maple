Na, K-ATPase is the enzyme responsible for the maintenance of the electrochemical gradients of Na+ and K+ across the plasma membrane. The enzyme consists of a heterodimer of an alpha and a beta subunits. Na, K-ATPase belongs to a multigene family. Three alpha subunit (alpha 1 alpha 2 alpha 3) and three beta subunit (beta 1 beta 2 beta 3) isoforms have been described so far. The gene expression of each subunit is differentially regulated in various tissues and developmental stages. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of the regulation of Na, K-ATPase gene expression and of the coordinated regulation between the alpha and beta subunit genes, extensive analyses of the genes encoding alpha and beta subunit isoforms have been performed. The rapid progress of the study in this field is reviewed.
