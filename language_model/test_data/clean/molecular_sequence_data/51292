Knowledge of the identity, synthesis and secretion of beta-galactoside-binding lectins by leukocytes is of importance because lactosaminoglycans present at the leukocyte cell surface may be physiologically significant lectin receptors that could mediate autocrine or paracrine functions and/or cell adhesion. This paper presents data that show that a previously identified 15.5-16.5 kDa lactose-binding protein synthesized in vitro by human peripheral leukocytes is actually comprised of three different polypeptides. One of these is related to a novel 15 kDa lectin isolated from human spleen and which is synthesized by B lymphoblastoid cells. Spleen contains at least six lactose-binding polypeptides for which the carbohydrate-binding activity is independent of the presence of divalent cations and mercaptoethanol. The splenic 15 kDa polypeptide does not appear to be immunologically related to previously characterized beta-galactoside-binding lectins. It is separable from galaptin, another galactoside-binding lectin (subunit mol. wt 14.5 kDa) by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel. Western blot analyses and immunoprecipitation/fluorography experiments with metabolically labelled cells showed the presence of the 15 kDa lectin in peripheral leukocytes and in Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B lymphoblastoid cells. The 15 kDa lectin yielded polypeptide fragments of approximately 6.2 and approximately 8.6 kDa after cyanogen bromide (CNBr) degradation. These fragments were partially sequenced and 12 residues/fragment were identified. A similarity search of the SWISS PROT protein data base did not reveal a relationship of the 15 kDa polypeptide to known lectins, including galaptin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
