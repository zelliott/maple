In the mitochondrial genome of Arabidopsis thaliana eight mosaic open reading frames arose by recombination of fragments duplicated from one or more mitochondrial genes. These duplications represent unedited sequences, suggesting their derivation from genomic DNA rather than RNA. Five of the chimeric reading frames contain the information for the N-terminus of the original polypeptide and 5' upstream regions. These observations suggest that the generation of novel open reading frames in plant mitochondria can occur rather easily by chance extensions of duplicated gene fragments. The presence of so many mosaic open reading frames in the normal Arabidopsis thaliana mitochondrial genome suggests that such recombined sequences interfere only occasionally and fortuitously with the peak mitochondrial performance presumably required during pollen maturation, and usually do not cause a cytoplasmic male sterile phenotype.
