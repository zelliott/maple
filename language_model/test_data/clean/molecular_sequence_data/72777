Four dammarane-type saponins were isolated by means of centrifugal partition chromatography from the root bark of Zizyphus lotus. Their structures were elucidated using a combination of 1D and 2D 1H and 13C NMR spectra and mass spectroscopy. One of these glycosides is the known jujuboside A. The others are three new dammarane saponins, identified as 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl (1-->3)-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1-->2)]-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl jujubogenin = jujuboside C, 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl (1-->2)-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->3)]-beta-D-galactopyranosyl lotogenin = lotoside I, and 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1-->2)-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl (1-->3)]-beta-D-glucopyranosyl lotogenin = lotoside II. Lotogenin is a new dammarane derivative identified as (15R, 16R, 20R, 22R)-16 beta, 22-epoxydammar-24-ene-3 beta, 15 alpha, 16 alpha, 20 beta-tetraol.
