To detect bacteriophages for Gram-positive oral pathogens in human saliva.

Saliva samples from 31 donors were screened for the presence of bacteriophages for Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces viscosus and Enterococcus faecalis. Bacteriophages for Enterococcus faecalis were found in seven samples. Enterococcus faecalis phages were still present in saliva re-collected from one donor one month, and one year after initial saliva collection.

The presence and stability of the Enterococcus faecalis bacteriophages in human saliva suggests a possible role of these bacteriophages in the oral ecosystem.

Phage therapy as a way to control oral bacteria might be considered.
