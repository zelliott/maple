The West Palearctic green toads, Bufo viridis , represent a species complex. Apart from tetraploid populations, which form at least one separate species, evidence exists for relevant differentiation among diploid populations. We present the results of a chromosomal (C-, Ag-NOR-, Replication pattern, DAPI and CMA3 banding) and molecular study (isolation and characterization of a satellite DNA family) carried out on a number of Central Asian, European and North African populations. For comparative purposes, our molecular analysis was also extended to specimens of three additional Bufo species (B. bufo, B. mauritanicus and B. cf. regularis ), as well as two rare African bufonids (Werneria mertensis and Wolterstoffina sp.). Our results demonstrate a remarkable karyological and molecular evolutionary stasis in the Bufo viridis complex. In fact, all chromatinic markers showed the same pattern and/or composition in all specimens, independently of their origin and ploidy levels. Even the NOR loci were invariably two and located on the telomeric regions of two chromosomes of the sixth pair, or quartet. Furthermore, very similar patterns of genomic hybridization of a monomeric unit of the Pst I satellite DNA family (named pBv) were observed in all diploid and tetraploid populations, as well as in B. bufo and B. mauritanicus . Finally, pBv hybridizes with monomeric units of Pst I satellite DNA in all species studied, including Werneria and Wolterstorffina, which are thought to have separated from Bufo as early as in the Mesozoic.
