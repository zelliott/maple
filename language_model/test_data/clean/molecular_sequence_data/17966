Mouse (Mus musculus) whole-mount, surface-spread, meiotic prophase chromosomes have an axial core structure, the synaptonemal complex, SC, from which extend chromatin loops. This arrangement permits a novel approach to the analysis of chromosome structure. Using in situ hybridization, the types of DNA sequences preferentially associated with the SC and the types located primarily in the chromatin loops can be determined. With biotinylated probes, detected by avidin conjugated to FITC, we present evidence for differential chromatin-SC interaction. The telomere sequence (TTAGGG)n is associated exclusively with the two ends of each autosomal SC rather than with the chromatin loops. The minor satellite DNA sequences are predominantly localized to the centromeric region of the SC, as defined by CREST serum anti-centromere antibodies. In contrast, the major satellite DNA probe hybridizes to the chromatin loops of the centromeric heterochromatin, and a probe containing a LINE sequence hybridizes to chromatin loops in general with no obvious preference for the SC. These observations demonstrate that, depending on the type of DNA sequence, the chromatin has different properties in regard to its association with the SC.
