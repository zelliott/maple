Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a T-cell-regulated autoimmune disease in which a pathological autoantibody response is mounted against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor of the neuromuscular junction. Our laboratory previously identified a T cell epitope, p195-212, derived from the human acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit, which triggered PBL to proliferate from about 70% of MG patients tested. p195-212 was also found to be an immunodominant T cell epitope in SJL mice and a cryptic epitope in C3H.SW mice. Inoculation of naive SJL mice with cells from a p195-212-specific syngeneic T cell line caused MG-related autoimmune manifestations in those mice. In these studies we analyzed TCR alpha and beta chain sequences used by T cell lines and clones from both high- and low-responder mouse strains in response to p195-212. T cell lines generated from either strain expressed single TCR V beta gene segments (V beta 17 in SJL mice and V beta 8 in C3H.SW mice). By deleting V beta 17-expressing T cells in p195-212-immunized SJL mice we established a T cell line that expressed the V beta 6 gene product, suggesting that SJL mice are not limited to using a single V beta gene segment in response to p195-212. In addition, we found that N- and/or C-terminal-truncated peptides of p195-212, presented under the same culture conditions to different clones bearing the same TCR alpha beta chain, could elicit very different proliferative responses from the clones. Thus, even within a constrained system, factors other than TCR sequence contribute to the differential stimulation of T cell responses.
