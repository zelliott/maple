Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus Ac16 is 1 of 17 genes conserved within Type 1 nucleopolyhedroviruses. This report demonstrates that multiple isoforms of the protein encoded by Ac16, BV/ODV-E26 (E26), are present in the infected cell. One form of E26 associates with viral DNA or DNA-binding proteins, while a second form associates with intracellular membranes and this is likely due to palmitoylation. The different forms of E26 present unique epitopes that can be discriminated by antiserum produced to bacterially or virally produced antigen. A summation of the data now available on E26 suggests that it is a multifunctional protein and the functional states assume unique conformations that can be discriminated by differing antisera.
