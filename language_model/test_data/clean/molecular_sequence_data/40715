Trametes versicolor is an important white rot fungus of both industrial and ecological interest. Saprotrophic basidiomycetes are the major decomposition agents in woodland ecosystems, and rarely form monospecific populations, therefore interspecific mycelial interactions continually occur. Interactions have different outcomes including replacement of one species by the other or deadlock. We have made subtractive cDNA libraries to enrich for genes that are expressed when T. versicolor interacts with another saprotrophic basidiomycete, Stereum gausapatum, an interaction that results in the replacement of the latter. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) (1920) were used for microarray analysis, and their expression compared during interaction with three different fungi: S. gausapatum (replaced by T. versicolor), Bjerkandera adusta (deadlock) and Hypholoma fasciculare (replaced T. versicolor). Expression of significantly more probes changed in the interaction between T.Â versicolor and S. gausapatum or B. adusta compared to H. fasciculare, suggesting a relationship between interaction outcome and changes in gene expression.
