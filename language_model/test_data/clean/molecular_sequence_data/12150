Hydrophobic stearoyl derivatives of proline-containing di- and tripeptides and their deuterated analogs were synthesized. It was shown by NMR spectroscopy that cis-trans-equilibrium around an X-Pro peptide bond is displaced towards trans-conformers for compounds containing a Ste-Pro fragment as opposed to the compounds containing Boc-Pro or Gly-Pro fragments.
