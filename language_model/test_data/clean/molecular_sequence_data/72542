We describe the isolation and characterization of the cDNA for FKHL13, the human homologue of the mouse hepatocyte nuclear factor 3/fork head homologue 4 (HFH-4) gene, a member of the HNF-3/fork head (also called winged helix) gene family. Members of this gene family contain a conserved DNA binding region of approx. 110 amino acids and are thought to play an important role in cell-specific differentiation. Previous analysis of the mouse and rat HFH-4 cDNAs revealed a distinct pattern of expression for this gene, suggesting that the gene plays an important role in the differentiation of lung and oviduct/ampulla epithelial cells and testicular spermatids. Analysis of the human FKHL13 gene confirmed this pattern of expression. We also found expression in adult human brain cortex, which we were able to confirm for the mouse. The expression pattern of FKHL13/HFH-4, confined to cilia/flagella-producing cells, leads us to believe that the gene plays an important role in the regulation of axonemal structural proteins. We show that the human gene for FKHL13 lies on chromosome 17 (comparison with the chromosomal location of the mouse gene strongly suggests 17q22-q25) and that the gene, which is approx. 6 kb, contains a single intron disrupting the fork head DNA binding domain. Such a disruption of a functional unit provides strong evidence for the theory of intron insertion during gene evolution. The expression of the gene is probably controlled by the CpG island, which is located in the promoter region of the gene. We also demonstrate that the FKHL13 gene is highly conserved among a wide variety of species, including birds.
