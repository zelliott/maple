One restriction to the cultivation of common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L., is its limited tolerance to low temperatures. In the present study, subtraction suppression hybridization was employed to enrich for stress responsive genes in both a chilling-susceptible common bean and a relatively more chilling-tolerant wild bean species, Phaseolus angustissimus. For each species, approximately 11 000 expressed sequence tags were generated. Comparative sequence analysis of the EST collection with the available annotated genome sequences of the model Fabaceae species Medicago truncatula and Glycine max identified protein homologues for approximately 65% and 80% of the Phaseolus sequences, respectively. This difference reflects the closer phylogenetic relationship between the genera Phaseolus and Glycine compared with Medicago. Annotation of the Phaseolus sequences was facilitated through this comparative analysis and indicated that several heat shock proteins, cytochrome P450s, and DNA binding factors were uniquely found among the sequences from the wild species P. angustissimus. The Phaseolus sequences have been made available on a GBrowse implementation using M. truncatula as the reference genome, providing rapid access to the sequence data and associated comparative genome data.
