In order to sequence the cysteine-rich regions of pig gastric mucin (PGM), we used our previously identified pig gastric mucin clone PGM-2A to screen a pig stomach cDNA library and perform rapid amplification of cDNA ends to obtain two cysteine-rich clones, PGM-2X and PGM-Z13. PGM-2X has 1071 base pairs (bp) encoding 357 amino acids containing five serine-threonine-rich 16 amino acid tandem repeats, downstream from a cysteine-rich region similar to human and mouse MUC5AC. PGM-Z13 encodes the complete 3'-terminus of PGM and is composed of 3336 bp with a 2964 bp open reading frame encoding 988 amino acids with four serine-threonine-rich tandem repeats upstream from a cysteine-rich region similar to the carboxyl terminal regions of human and rat MUC5AC and human MUC5B. This region is homologous to von Willebrand factor C and D domains involved in acid induced polymerization, and to the carboxyl terminal cystine-knot domain of various mucins, TGF-beta, vWF and norrin, which is involved in dimerization. These newly sequenced cysteine-rich regions of pig gastric mucin may be critical for its gelation and for its observed increased viscosity induced by low pH.
