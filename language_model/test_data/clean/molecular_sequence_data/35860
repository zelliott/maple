A plasmid-borne gene mediating trimethoprim resistance, dhfrIX, newly found among porcine strains of Escherichia coli, was observed at a frequency of 11% among trimethoprim-resistant veterinary isolates. This rather high frequency of dhfrIX could be due to the extensive use of trimethoprim in veterinary practice in Sweden. After searching several hundred clinical isolates, one human E. coli strain was also found to harbor the dhfrIX gene. Thus, the dhfrIX gene seems to have spread from porcine bacteria to human pathogens. Furthermore, the occurrence of other genes coding for resistant dihydrofolate reductase enzymes (dhfrI, dhfrII, dhfrV, dhfrVII, and dhfrVIII) among the porcine isolates was investigated. In addition, association of dhfr genes with the integraselike open reading frames of transposons Tn7 and Tn21 was studied. In colony hybridization experiments, both dhfrI and dhfrII were found associated with these integrase genes. The most common combination was dhfrI and int-Tn7, indicating a high prevalence of Tn7.
