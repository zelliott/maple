A new 1150 amino acids long open reading frame (ORF), coding for an essential protein of unknown function was found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by sequencing 3754 bp of geonomic DNA. The clone was isolated in a search for a fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) and was localized on chromosome IX. The ORF bears no homology to FABP, but it shows weak similarity to Plasmodium vivax reticulocyte binding protein 1 and to aggregation-specific adenylate cyclase from Dictyostelium discoideum. The new gene is constitutively transcribed regardless of the carbon source used.
