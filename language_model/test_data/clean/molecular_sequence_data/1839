The core oligosaccharide region of Klebsiella pneumoniae lipopolysaccharide contains some novel features that distinguish it from the corresponding lipopolysaccharide region in other members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella. The conserved Klebsiella outer core contains the unusual trisaccharide 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo)-(2,6)-GlcN-(1,4)-GalUA. In general, Kdo residues are normally found in the inner core, but in K. pneumoniae, this Kdo residue provides the ligation site for O polysaccharide. The outer core Kdo residue can also be non-stoichiometrically substituted with an l-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose (Hep) residue, another component more frequently found in the inner core. To understand the genetics and biosynthesis of core oligosaccharide synthesis in Klebsiella, the gene products involved in the addition of the outer core GlcN (WabH), Kdo (WabI), and Hep (WabJ) residues as well as the inner core HepIII residue (WaaQ) were identified. Non-polar mutations were created in each of the genes, and the resulting mutant lipopolysaccharide was analyzed by mass spectrometry. The in vitro glycosyltransferase activity of WabI and WabH was verified. WabI transferred a Kdo residue from CMP-Kdo onto the acceptor lipopolysaccharide. The activated precursor required for GlcN addition has not been identified. However, lysates overexpressing WabH were able to transfer a GlcNAc residue from UDP-GlcNAc onto the acceptor GalUA residue in the outer core.
