A new cytochrome P450 gene, CYP4G25, was identified as a differentially expressed gene between the diapausing and post-diapausing pharate first instar larvae of the wild silkmoth Antheraea yamamai, using subtractive cDNA hybridization. The cDNA sequence of CYP4G25 has an open reading frame of 1674 nucleotides encoding 557 amino acid residues. Sequence analysis of the putative CYP4G25 protein disclosed the motif FXXGXRXCXG that is essential for heme binding in P450 cytochromes. Hybridization in situ demonstrated predominant expression of CYP4G25 in the integument of pharate first instar larvae. Northern blotting analysis showed an intensive signal after the initiation of diapause and no or weak expression throughout the periods of pre-diapause and post-diapause, including larval development. These results indicate that CYP4G25 is strongly associated with diapause in pharate first instar larvae.
