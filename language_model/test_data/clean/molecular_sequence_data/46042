Synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-terminus of auxin-binding protein 1 (ABP1) have been shown to function as auxin agonists. To define a C-terminal receptor, photoaffinity crosslinking experiments were performed using an azido derivative of a C-terminal peptide and plasma membranes from maize (Zea mays L.). The crosslinking reaction was monitored by immunoblotting using anti-ABP1 antibodies. The crosslinked proteins were isolated by 2D gel electrophoresis and identified by mass spectrometric analysis. Further, the noncrosslinked forms of these proteins were also identified. Two proteins with apparent molecular masses of 73 kDa (termed C-terminal peptide-binding protein 1, CBP1) and 35 kDa (CBP2) were specifically linked with the C-terminal peptide. CBP2 is a cytoplasmic protein that consists of two conserved domains that are characteristic of a ricin-type lectin domain. CBP2 remained in the detergent-insoluble particles and was released from the particles by the addition of monosaccharides such as methyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside. CBP1 was released from the membranes by treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, indicating that CBP1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored plasma membrane protein. CBP1 was found to be a copper-binding protein, and is highly homologous to Arabidopsis thaliana SKU5 that contributes to directional root growth processes. Further, it is similar to A. thaliana SKS6 that contributes to cotyledon vascular patterning and to Nicotiana tabacum NTP303 that contributes to pollen tube growth. The present results indicate that ABP1 may contribute to directional cell growth processes via the GPI-anchored plasma membrane protein SKU5 and its family members.
