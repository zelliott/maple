The cDNA for the 33 kd protein from the oxygen-evolving complex of spinach together with the coding region for the hydrophobic C-terminal part of the transit sequence was cloned into the expression plasmid pDS12/33Ex. The 33 kd protein precursor was expressed in Escherichia coli, secreted into the periplasm and correctly processed to the mature 33 kd protein. Thus the hydrophobic domain of the transit sequence, preceded by a methionine and two lysine residues, can function as a bacterial signal peptide. The periplasmic proteins were released from the cells by osmotic shock and the expressed protein was purified by anion exchange chromatography. The protein was identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. N-terminal sequence analysis showed that the cleavage of the signal peptide occurred at the correct position. The expressed protein could be rebound to CaCl2-washed PSII particles and oxygen evolution was restored in equal amounts by the 33 kd protein from both E. coli and spinach.
