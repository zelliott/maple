The autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs) of pSR1, a cryptic circular DNA plasmid detected in a strain of Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, were delimited by subcloning and deletion analysis and by the isolation of nucleotide substitution mutations. A 30 base-pair (bp) sequence from inverted repeat 1 (IR1) and presumably the same region from IR2 of pSR1 functions as an ARS in the native host, Z. rouxii, and in a heterologous host, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Thus, pSR1 has two ARSs per molecule, either of which is sufficient for replication of the plasmid molecule in both hosts. These hosts, however, respond differently to nucleotide substitutions in the 30 bp sequence, suggesting that the sequences required for ARS function in the two organisms are not exactly the same. In addition, a 137 bp sequence that overlaps the 30 bp sequence by 11 bp also functions as an ARS in Z. rouxii but not in S. cerevisiae. However, this 137 bp sequence enhances the stability of plasmids carrying the pSR1 ARS in S. cerevisiae. The 30 bp and 137 bp sequences each contain a single copy of the 11 bp ARS consensus sequence, which is essential for ARS function in S. cerevisiae. Small insertions between the 11 bp overlapping region and the 11 bp ARS consensus sequence showed that a proper distance between these two 11 bp sequences is essential for the ARS function of the 30 bp sequence. Point mutations that inactivate ARS function show that the ARS consensus sequence, as well as a short A:T segment in the overlapping sequence, is required for the ARS function of the 30 bp sequence.
