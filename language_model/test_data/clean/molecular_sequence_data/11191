In our search for novel human galanin receptor (GALR) subtypes, human genomic DNA was PCR amplified using sets of degenerate primers based on conserved sequences in human and rat GALR. The sequence of one of the subcloned PCR products revealed homology to a sequence in the 3' region of the human CD22 gene following a BLAST search of GenBank's database. A search for open reading frames (ORF) in the non-coding CD22 sequence resulted in identification of two novel putative intronless genes, GPR40 and GPR41. The recent submission of sequence overlapping the downstream CD22 sequence revealed a possible polymorphic insert containing a third intronless gene, GPR42, sharing 98% amino acid identity with GPR41, followed by a fourth intronless gene, GPR43. Thus, the GPR40, GPR41, GPR42, and GPR43 genes, respectively, occur downstream from CD22, a gene previously localized on chromosome 19q13.1. The four putative novel human genes encode new members of the GPCR family and share little homology with GALR.
