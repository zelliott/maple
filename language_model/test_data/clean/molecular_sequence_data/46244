Complete nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of Thrinchus schrenkii (Orthoptera: Acridoidea: Pamphagidae) were determined. It is 15672 bp in length and contains 71.2% A+T. All T. schrenkii protein-coding sequences except for the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) start with a typical ATN codon. Instead, CCG, which is a rare but possible initiation codon, is located at the initiation context of COI. The usual termination codons (TAA and TAG) were found from 12 PCGs. However, the ND5 had incomplete termination codon (T). All tRNA genes could be folded into the typical cloverleaf secondary structure, excluding tRNASer(AGN) which forms another structure according to the Steinberg-Cedergren tertiary structure. The sizes of the large and small ribosomal RNA genes are 1319 and 848 bp, respectively. The A+T content of the A+T-rich region is 78.7%, which is the lowest among the known mitogenome of Acridoidea.
