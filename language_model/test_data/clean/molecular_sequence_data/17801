DNA from two regions of the phage M13 genome hybridizes with DNA restriction fragments from genomes of various species including man [15, 20]. As the pattern of hybridization is individual-specific, this phage M13 probe can be used for DNA fingerprinting. We demonstrate here that the regions of many keratin genes coding for glycine-rich parts of C and N end domains are very similar to the phage M13 probe, and this similarity may be responsible for hybridization.
