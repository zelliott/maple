We sequenced the genome of the high-siderophore-yielding strain Pseudomonas sp. HYS and then analyzed its iron acquisition systems. The 5.6-Mb draft genome sequence has a special pattern of pyoverdine synthesis clusters and contains an hmuRSTUV heme uptake cluster, which has a homolog only in some strains of the order Enterobacteriales.
