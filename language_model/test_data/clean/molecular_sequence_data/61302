The intron-containing genes encoding human and mouse ribosomal protein (r-protein) L27A were cloned and sequenced. The human r-protein L27A gene (RPL27A) shared an identical exon/intron structure with the mouse r-protein 27A gene (Rpl27a). The translational start codon ATG was separated from the main reading frame by the first intron sequence in both genes. An approximately 200-bp sequence upstream of the translational start site of both genes displayed remarkable similarity, and contained the putative promoters lacking canonical TATA, but harbored Sp1 binding sites and a short stretch of pyrimidine cluster, similar to other r-protein genes. Transcriptional regulatory elements, Box-A and GABP, found in the promoters of some other r-protein genes were also conserved in both genes. These structural features were included in the typical CpG island identified in the 5'-end sequences, suggesting that RPL27A/Rpl27a cloned here are authentic and transcriptionally active. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis localized the mouse intron-containing Rpl27a to chromosome 7E2-F1 syntenic to human chromosome 11p15, where human RPL27A was located.
