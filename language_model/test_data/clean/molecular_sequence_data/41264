The prevalence of different H. pylori genotypes in various geographical regions indicates region-specific adaptations during the course of evolution. Complete genomes of H. pylori from countries with high infection burdens, such as India, have not yet been described. Herein we present genome sequences of two H. pylori strains, NAB47 and NAD1, from India. In this report, we briefly mention the sequencing and finishing approaches, genome assembly with downstream statistics, and important features of the two draft genomes, including their phylogenetic status. We believe that these genome sequences and the comparative genomics emanating thereupon will help us to clearly understand the ancestry and biology of the Indian H. pylori genotypes, and this will be helpful in solving the so-called Indian enigma, by which high infection rates do not corroborate the minuscule number of serious outcomes observed, including gastric cancer.
