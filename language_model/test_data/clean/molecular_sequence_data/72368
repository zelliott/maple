Selenocysteine is encoded by a UGA codon in all organisms that synthesise selenoproteins. This codon is specified as a selenocysteine codon by an mRNA secondary structure, which is located immediately 3' of the UGA in the reading frame of selenoprotein genes in Gram-negative bacteria, whereas it is located in the 3' untranslated region of eukaryal selenoprotein genes. The location and the structure of a similar mRNA signal in archaea has so far not been determined. Seven selenoproteins were identified for the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii by labelling with 75Se and by SDS/polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Their size could be correlated with open reading frames possessing internal UGA codons from the total genomic sequence. One of the open reading frames, that of the VhuD subunit of a hydrogenase, possesses two UGA codons and appears to code for a selenoprotein with two selenocysteine residues. A strongly conserved mRNA element was identified that is exclusively linked to selenoprotein genes. It is located in the 3' untranslated region in six of the mRNAs and in the 5' untranslated region of the fdhA mRNA. This element, which is present in the 3' non-translated region of two selenoprotein mRNAs from Methanococcus voltae, is proposed to act in decoding of the UGA with selenocysteine.
