A pUC19-derived plasmid was constructed that coded for a hybrid cellulase with the Thermomonospora fusca E2 cellulose-binding domain at its C terminus joined to the Prevotella ruminicola 40.5-kDa carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase). The hybrid enzyme was purified and characterized enzymatically. It bound tightly to cellulose, and its specific activities on carboxymethyl cellulose, amorphous cellulose, and ball-milled cellulose were 1.5, 10, and 8 times that of the 40.5-kDa CMCase, respectively. Furthermore, the modified enzyme gave synergism with an exocellulase in the degradation of filter paper, while the 40.5-kDa CMCase did not.
