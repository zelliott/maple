An improved method for sequencing human genomic DNA amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure is described. The portion of the genome investigated is the 383 nucleotide-long exon 2 of the human antithrombin III gene. Incorporation of the analogue of dGTP, 7-deaza-2'-deoxyguanosine-5'-triphosphate, during the amplification of exon 2 by PCR allowed for the elimination of recurrent artifacts obtained during sequencing of the amplified DNA by the dideoxyribonucleotide chain termination method.
