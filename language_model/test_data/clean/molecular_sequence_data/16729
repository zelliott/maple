Mono-, di-, and trisialyloligosaccharides were introduced to mutant insulins through enzymatic reactions. Sugar chains were sialylated by alpha2,6-sialyltransferase (alpha2,6-SiaT) via an accessible glutamine residue at the N-terminus of the B-chain attached by transglutaminase (TGase). Sia2,6-di-LacNAc-Ins(B-F1Q) and Sia2,6-tri-LacNAc-Ins(B-F1Q), displaying two and three sialyl-N-acetyllactosamines, respectively, were administered to hyperglycemic mice. Both branched glycoinsulins showed prolonged glucose-lowering effects compared to native or lactose-carrying insulins, showing that sialic acid is important in obtaining a prolonged effect. Sia2,6-tri-LacNAc-Ins(B-F1Q), in particular, induced a significant delay in the recovery of glucose levels.
