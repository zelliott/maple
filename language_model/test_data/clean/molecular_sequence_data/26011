Recently, we reported the partial characterization of bovine lens intrinsic membrane proteins having apparent SDS-PAGE derived molecular mass of 19, 21, and 23 kDa, and determined that they contained identical NH2- terminal amino acid sequences for the first 20 amino acids. From this amino acid sequence information, a mixed synthetic oligonucleotide was constructed and used to screen a calf lens lambda gt11 cDNA library in order to isolate and characterize the cDNA coding for this membrane polypeptide(s). Two separate cDNA clones were isolated and sequenced, and were found to have an identical sequence of 883 bases with an open reading frame coding for a polypeptide of 173 amino acids, having a molecular mass of 19,683 Daltons. The first 20 amino acids of the translated sequence were identical to that determined by our laboratory previously, and the last seven amino acids were identical to that recently determined by another laboratory from analysis of the extracted polypeptides, indicating that this cDNA is the authentic molecule coding for MP19.
