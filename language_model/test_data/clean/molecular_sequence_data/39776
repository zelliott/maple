Bovine liver catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) was chemically modified with mannan, carboxymethylcellulose, and carboxymethylchitin. The enzyme retained about 48-97% of the initial specific activity after glycosidation with the polysaccharides. The prepared neoglycoenzyme was 1.9-5.7 fold more stable against the thermal inactivation processes at 55 degrees C, in comparison with the native counterpart. Also, the modified enzyme was more resistant to proteolytic degradation with trypsin. Pharmacokinetics studies revealed higher plasma half-life time for all the enzyme-polymer preparations, but better results were achieved for the enzyme modified with the anionic macromolecules.
