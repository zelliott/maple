Magnesium deficiency was induced in male Wistar rats by adding an excess of phosphorous and calcium to the diet (1.195 g of phosphorous and 1.04 g of calcium/100 g of diet). Feeding of these animals with a diet containing beta 1-->4 linked galactooligosaccharides (4'-GOS) (5 g of 4'-GOS/100 g of diet) increased the apparent magnesium absorption ratios and the concentrations of magnesium in the serum and femur, and reduced accumulation of calcium in the kidney and heart. We speculate that the use of magnesium increased by feeding 4'-GOS to a limited extent prevented the lower magnesium status and the severity of calcification of the kidney and heart caused by excess dietary phosphorous and calcium.
