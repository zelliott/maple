The flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) growth hormone (GH)-encoding gene (fGH) and its promoter region were cloned and sequenced following amplification of genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. The fGH gene is 2.1-kb long and consists of six exons and five introns. In the 5'-flanking region of the determined transcription start point, a potential TATA box is located at -24, and Pit-1/GHF-1-binding site candidates are located in the -70 to -53 and -133 to -141 regions.
