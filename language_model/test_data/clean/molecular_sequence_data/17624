The interaction of the cow mammary gland tRNA(IAGLeu), having a long variable loop, with the cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase has been studied by the alkylation with ethylnitrosourea. It was shown that leucyl-tRNA synthetase protects from alkylation 3'-phosphates of the nucleotides 12-13 in D-loop, 23-24 in D-stem and 37-43 in the anticodon arm of tRNA(IAGLeu). All regions of interaction with the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase are located in the same plane of tRNA whereas the long variable loop is in another plane.
