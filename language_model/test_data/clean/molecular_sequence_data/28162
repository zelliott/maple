The mouse cytochrome P1450 (CYP1A1) gene is responsible for the metabolism of numerous carcinogens and toxic chemicals. Induction by the environmental contaminant tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) requires a functional aromatic hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor. We examined the 5'-flanking region of the CYP1A1 gene in mouse hepatoma Hepa-1 wild-type cells and a mutant line having a defect in chromatin binding of the TCDD-receptor complex. We identified two cis-acting elements (distal, -1071 to -901 region; proximal, -245 to -50 region) required for constitutive and TCDD-inducible CYP1A1 gene expression. Three classes of DNA-protein complexes binding to the distal element were identified: class I, found only in the presence of TCDD and a functional Ah receptor, that was heat labile and not competed against by simian virus 40 (SV40) early promoter DNA; class II, consisting of at least three constitutive complexes that were heat stable and bound to SV40 DNA; and class III, composed of at least three constitutive complexes that were thermolabile and were not competed against by SV40 DNA. Essential contacts for these proteins were centered at -993 to -990 for the class I complex, -987, -986, or both for the class II complexes, and -938 to -927 for the class III complexes. The proximal element was absolutely essential for both constitutive and TCDD-inducible CYP1A1 gene expression, and at least two constitutive complexes bound to this region. These data are consistent with the proximal element that binds proteins being necessary but not sufficient for inducible gene expression; interaction of these proteins with those at the distal element was found to be required for full CYP1A1 induction by TCDD.
