To control the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle through contaminated animal feedstuffs, screening of feed products is essential. We designed five pairs of primers to identify specifically raw and heat-treated tissue from cattle, sheep, goat, deer, and ruminants in general. A forward common primer was designed based on a conserved DNA sequence in the mitochondrial 12S rRNA-tRNA(val)-16S rRNA gene, and reverse primers were designed to hybridize with a species-specific DNA sequence for each species considered. All primers were developed to create a specific PCR product small enough (less than 200 bp) to be suitable for heat-treated material. To evaluate the effect of heat treatment, a severe sterilization condition (133 degrees C at 300 kPa for 20 min) was chosen. Species-specific amplicons were obtained from all types of heat-treated meat meals. Analysis of laboratory-contaminated vegetable meals revealed that the detection limit of the assay was 0.05% for each species analyzed. This PCR-based analysis can be used as a routine method for detecting banned animal-derived ingredients in raw and heat-treated feedstuffs.
