The structure of the extracellular polysaccharide secreted by Rhizobium leguminosarum var. phaseoli CIAT 899 has been studied by methylation analysis. 1H-n.m.r. spectroscopy, and partial acid hydrolysis. The repeating unit is an octasaccharide made up of D-glucose, D-galactose, pyruvic acid, and acetic acid in the molar ratios 6:2:1.5:1.5. Half of the terminal Gal groups are 4,6-substituted by pyruvic acid acetal groups and the other half by O-acetyl groups at position 3. Also, one of the 3-linked glucosyl residues carries a pyruvic acid 4,6-acetal group and one of the 4-linked glucosyl residues is acetylated at position 6.
