We previously described the isolation of a human oncogene which had acquired transforming potential by a DNA rearrangement accompanying transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with human tumor DNA (X. Zhan, A. Culpepper, M. Reddy, J. Loveless, and M. Goldfarb, Oncogene 1:369-376, 1987). We now term this oncogene the FGF-5 gene, since it specifies the fifth documented protein related to fibroblast growth factors (FGFs. Two regions of the FGF-5 sequence, containing 122 of its 267 amino acid residues, were 40 to 50% homologous to the sequences of acidic and basic FGFs as well as to the sequences of the FGF-related oncoproteins int-2 and hst/KS3. The FGF-5 gene bears the three exon structures typical for members of this family. FGF-5 was found to be expressed in the neonatal brain and in 3 of the 13 human tumor cell lines examined. Several experiments strongly suggested that FGF-5 is a growth factor with properties common to those of acidic and basic FGFs. The rearrangement which activated the FGF-5 gene during DNA transfection had juxtaposed a retrovirus transcriptional enhancer just upstream from the native promoter of the gene.
