Extracellular matrix components strongly influence the differentiated properties of isolated rat arterial smooth muscle cells during in vitro cultivation. The attachment and spreading of the cells on a substrate of fibronectin or a 105-kDa cell-binding fragment of fibronectin are accompanied by a structural and functional transformation, referred to as a transition or modulation from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype. Here, the ability of the cell-attachment sequence of fibronectin, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS), to promote this process was studied. The results demonstrate that freshly isolated smooth muscle cells attached to a substrate of the synthetic peptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Cys (GRGDSC) in a specific manner and as well as to substrates of fibronectin and the 105-kDa fragment. Subsequent spreading of the cells on the peptide substrate followed the same kinetics and was as extensive as on fibronectin, even if protein synthesis was blocked by treatment of the cultures with cycloheximide. Like fibronectin, the peptide substrate induced formation of actin filament bundles, again without ongoing protein synthesis. Moreover, it was as efficient as fibronectin in supporting the transition of the cells from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype as analyzed by electron microscopy. Antibodies against the beta subunit of the fibronectin receptor interfered with the attachment, spreading, and fine structural reorganization of the cells in a similar manner on substrates of fibronectin, the 105-kDa fragment, and GRGDSC. Taken together, the findings indicate that the cell-attachment sequence (RGDS) mimics intact fibronectin in promoting a change in the differentiated properties of arterial smooth muscle cells and does so by interacting with a cell surface receptor for fibronectin.
