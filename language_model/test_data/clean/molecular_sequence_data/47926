Dentin extracellular matrix has been shown to contain components capable of inducing chondrogenesis and osteogenesis at ectopic sites when implanted in vivo, and chondrogenesis in cultures of embryonic muscle-derived fibroblasts (EMF) in vitro. The polypeptide responsible, called the chondrogenic-inducing agent (CIA), has been isolated from a 4.0-M guanidinium hydrochloride extract of demineralized bovine dentin matrix. Following Sephacryl S-100 chromatography, CIA activity was identified in fractions by assay for uptake of [35S]-SO4 into proteoglycan by the EMF after 24 hrs in culture. The active fraction induced the EMF to produce type II collagen mRNA and decrease production of type I collagen mRNA after 5 days in culture. The EMF + CIA, cultured for 4 to 7 wks, formed toluidine-blue- and alizarin-red-stainable nodules, indicative of chondrogenic induction. In vivo implants in rat muscle with collagen carrier produced ectopic bone after 7 wks. The CIA was brought to near-homogeneity by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, tested at each step by EMF [35S]-SO4-incorporation assays. The CIA components had masses in the ranges of 6000 to 10,000 Da by both mass spectroscopy and gel electrophoresis. The CIA amino acid composition, NH2-terminal, and internal amino acid sequences were determined. These data showed unequivocally that the CIA peptides were derived from bovine amelogenin. The peptides contain the amino-terminal portion of the bovine amelogenin. The presence of these chondrogenic/osteogenic amelogenin-polypeptides in dentin matrix leads us to hypothesize that they may be involved in epithelial-mesenchymal signaling during tooth development interactions-the first time a function has been indicated for these molecules.
