The Thiobacillus ferrooxidans thioredoxin gene, trxA, was isolated by its ability to complement an Escherichia coli gshA trxA mutant which was otherwise unable to grow on minimal medium lacking glutathione. The T. ferrooxidans thioredoxin also enabled the in vivo reduction by E. coli of methionine sulfoxide to methionine, as well as the in vitro reduction of insulin. When present in E. coli, the T. ferrooxidans thioredoxin supported the replication of phage T7, but not the growth of phage M13. The T. ferrooxidans trxA gene was sequenced and the thioredoxin was found to be most like that of E. coli (71% identity) and Chromatium vinosum (70% identity). As in the case of E. coli, the gene was located immediately upstream of the gene for the rho transcriptional terminator. DNA:RNA blot hybridization and primer-extension analysis of the trxA gene in T. ferrooxidans and the cloned gene in E. coli indicated that it was transcribed as an independent unit and that the major transcriptional start sites were the same in both organisms.
