The SCAN domain is described as a highly conserved, leucine-rich motif of approximately 60 amino acids found at the amino-terminal end of zinc finger transcription factors. Although no specific biological function has been attributed to the SCAN domain, its predicted amphipathic secondary structure led to the suggestion that this domain may mediate protein-protein associations. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified members of two SCAN domain protein families that interact with the SCAN domain of the zinc finger protein ZNF202. The interacting ZNF191 protein represents the family of SCAN domain-containing zinc finger proteins, whereas the novel SDP1 protein establishes a new family of genes that encode an isolated SCAN domain. Isolated SCAN domain proteins may form asymmetric homodimers in solution. Biochemical binding studies confirmed the associations of ZNF191 and SDP1 with ZNF202 and established the SCAN domain as a selective hetero- and homotypic oligomerization domain. SCAN mediated protein associations might therefore represent a new regulatory mechanism of transcriptional activity.
