Two non-motile, Gram-staining-negative, yellow-pigmented bacterial strains designated HMD1001T and HMD1033T were isolated from the water of a mesotrophic artificial lake in Korea. A phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that both strains could be assigned to the genus Flavobacterium; strain HMD1001T appeared most closely related to Flavobacterium fluvii H7T (96.8 % sequence similarity), F. succinicans DSM 4002T (96.6 %) and F. hydatis DSM 2063T (96.6 %) whereas strain HMD1033T appeared most closely related to Flavobacterium psychrolimnae LMG 2201T (96.2 %), F. segetis AT1048T (96.2 %) and F. weaverense AT1042T (96.2 %). The major fatty acids of strain HMD1001T were iso-C15:0 (21.5 %), summed feature 3 (comprising C16:1ω6c and/or C16:1ω7c; 18.0 %) and iso-C15:1 G (7.6 %), whereas those of HMD1033T were summed feature 3 (23.8 %), iso-C15:0 3-OH (16.9 %), iso-C15:0 (15.3 %) and anteiso-C15:0 (12.1 %). The genomic DNA G+C contents of strains HMD1001T and HMD1033T were 35.9 and 32.2 mol%, respectively. Phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence indicates that strains HMD1001T and HMD1033T represent two novel species of the genus Flavobacterium, for which the names Flavobacterium yonginense sp. nov. (type strain HMD1001T=KCTC 22796T=CECT 7594T) and Flavobacterium myungsuense sp. nov. (type strain HMD1033T=KCTC 22825T=CECT 7649T) are proposed.
