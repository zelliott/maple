Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a proinflammatory cytokine produced by antigen-presenting cells in response to many microbial infections. IL-12 plays an important role in the generation of T helper type-1 cells, which favor cell-mediated immune response. IL-12 is composed of two different subunits, p40 and p35, whose expression can be regulated concomitantly or differentially. Monocytic cells, the major producers of IL-12, can be primed by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) to produce optimal amounts of IL-12 in response to LPS stimulation as a consequence of bacterial infection. The priming effect is exerted primarily at the transcriptional level on the p40 promoter in conjunction with the effects of LPS, possibly by inducing specific transcription factors, which individually have no direct effect but which cooperatively can activate the promoter. We examined in detail one of these DNA-protein interactions observed around an Ets-2 element situated at -211/-207 of the p40 promoter, which is known to be a functionally critical site. This region interacts with a nuclear complex termed F1 that appears to be highly inducible by either IFN-gamma treatment for 16 h or lipopolysaccharide stimulation for 8 h. F1 binding to the Ets-2 site requires a considerable amount of spacing around the Ets-2 site, as revealed by gel mobility shift and in vitro methylation assays. Supershift experiments and DNA affinity purification indicated that both Ets-2 and a novel, antigenically related protein with an approximate molecular mass of 109 kDa are part of the F1 complex, together with additional components including IRF-1 and c-Rel. This novel protein is designated GLp109 for its inducibility by IFN-gamma or lipopolysaccharide. Its possible role in the activation of the IL-12 p40 promoter is discussed.
