Through functional studies of mutant tRNAs, we have identified sequence and/or structural features important for specifying the many distinctive properties of E coli initiator tRNA. Many of the mutant tRNAs contain an anticodon sequence change from CAU-->CUA and are now substrates for E coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS). We describe here the effect of further mutating the discriminator base 73 and nucleotide 72 at the end of the acceptor stem on: i) recognition of the mutant tRNAs by E coli GlnRS; ii) recognition by E coli methionyl-tRNA transformylase; and iii) activity of the mutant tRNAs in initiation in E coli. For GlnRS recognition, our results are, in general, consistent with interactions found in the crystal structure of the E coli GlnRS-glutamine tRNA complex. The results also support our previous conclusion that formylation of initiator tRNA is important for its function in initiation.
