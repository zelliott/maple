Bacteria isolates phenotypically related to Pseudomonas corrugata have frequently been isolated from the rhizosphere of Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica napus grown on different soils. 16S rDNA (rrs) gene sequencing, DNA-DNA hybridization, biochemical characterization and siderophore typing showed that these isolates belong to two different species that are distinct from other species of the genus Pseudomonas, including P. corrugata. A description of properties of these two new species is given based on the study of 16 isolates. Proposed names are Pseudomonas brassicacearum (10 strains studied) and Pseudomonas thivervalensis (6 strains studied). The type strain of Pseudomonas brassicacearum is CFBP 11706T and that of Pseudomonas thivervalensis is CFBP 11261T.
