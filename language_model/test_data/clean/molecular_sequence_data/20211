In plants, cytochrome P450 is a group of monooxygenases existing as a gene superfamily and plays important roles in metabolizing physiologically important compounds. However, to date only a limited number of P450s have been identified and characterized in legumes. In this study, data mining methods were used, and 151 putative P450 genes in the model legume Medicago truncatula were identified, including 135 novel sequences. These genes were classified into 9 clans and 44 families by sequence similarity, and among those 4 new clans and 21 new families not reported previously in legumes. By comparison of these genes with P450 genes in Arabidopsis and rice, it was found that most of the known P450 families in dicot species exist in M. truncatula. The representative protein sequences of putative P450s were aligned, and the secondary elements were assigned based on the known structure P450BM3. Putative substrate recognition sites (SRSs) and substrate binding sites were also identified in these sequences. In addition, the ESTs-derived expression profiles (digital Northern) of the putative P450 genes were analyzed, which was confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses of several selected P450 genes. These results will provide a base for catalogue information on P450 genes in M. truncatula and for further functional analysis of P450 superfamily genes in legumes.
