Down-modulation of major histocompatibility class I (MHC-I) molecules is a viral strategy for survival in the host. Myxoma virus, a member of the Poxviridae family responsible for rabbit myxomatosis, can down-modulate the expression of MHC-I molecules, but the viral factor(s) has not been described. We cloned and characterized a gene coding for an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein containing an atypical zinc finger and two transmembrane domains, which we called myxoma virus leukemia-associated protein (MV-LAP). MV-LAP down-regulated surface MHC-I and Fas-CD95 molecules upon transfection; the mechanism probably involves an exacerbation of endocytosis and was lost when the ER retention signal was removed. In addition, the lytic activity of MHC-I-restricted antigen-specific cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) against myxoma virus-infected antigen-presenting target cells was significantly reduced, revealing a strong correlation between MHC-I down-regulation by MV-LAP and CTL killing in vitro. In vivo experiments with a knockout virus showed that MV-LAP is a virulence factor, potentially involved in the immunosuppression characteristic of myxomatosis. Data bank analysis revealed that MV-LAP has homologs in herpesviruses and other poxviruses. We propose the name "scrapins" to define a new group of ER-resident surface cellular receptor abductor proteins. The down-regulation of cell surface molecules by scrapins probably helps protect infected cells during viral infections.
