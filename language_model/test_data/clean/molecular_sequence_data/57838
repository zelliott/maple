An acidic extracellular polysaccharide composed of D-glucose, L-fucose, D-glucuronic acid and pyruvic acid residues has been isolated from the Mycobacterium convolutum culture fluid. On the basis of methylation analysis and 13C NMR data, the structure of the repeating unit of the polysaccharide was deduced as follows: -->3)-beta-D-Glcp-(1-->4)-beta-D-GlcpA-(1-->4)-alpha-L-Fucp- (1--> [formula: see text]
