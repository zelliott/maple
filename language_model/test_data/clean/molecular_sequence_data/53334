The characterization of sequence-specific noncovalent complexes of the GCN4 peptides and dsDNA using mass spectrometry is reported. The GCN4 peptides belong to a class of proteins which bind to sequence-specific dsDNA and are important in the regulation of gene transcription in yeast. These proteins contain a bZIP structural motif which consists of a basic DNA-binding domain and a leucine zipper dimerization domain. The protein dimers specifically bind double-stranded DNA containing the binding element 5'-ATGA(C/G)TCAT-3' to form a tetramolecular noncovalent complex. Using electrospray ionization, we report the detection of such a specific tetramolecular complex using mass spectrometry. Under conditions necessary for observation of the tetramolecular complex, no ions were detected for the GCN4 peptide dimer or the GCN4 monomer with dsDNA. These observations indicate that the specific interaction of the dsDNA with the protein dimer stabilizes the biologically significant noncovalent complex in the gas phase. Complexes were observed for various lengths of both blunt-ended and cohesive-ended double-stranded DNA containing the specific recognition sequence. The binding specificity of the complex was verified with the use of control DNA not containing the recognition sequence and control peptides not known to bind DNA specifically. Additionally, combining limited proteolysis of GCN4 peptide-DNA complexes with mass spectrometric determination of the products compared to identical experiments with noncomplexed peptides was used to probe interactions of specific amino acids with the DNA. The ability to observe these complexes by mass spectrometry and to probe the specific interactions involved opens the door for utilizing this analytical technique to other structural biological problems including the study of transcription processes and determining the specific binding regions between dsDNA and proteins.
