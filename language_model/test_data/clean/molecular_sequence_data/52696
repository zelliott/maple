Ribonucleotide-based enzymes (ribozymes) that cleave pathological RNAs are being developed as therapeutic agents. Chemical modification of the hammerhead ribozyme has produced nuclease-resistant catalysts that cleave targeted mRNAs in cell culture and exhibit antitumor activity in animals. Unfortunately, stabilizing modifications usually reduce the catalytic rate in vitro. An alternative to rationally designed chemical modifications of existing ribozymes is to identify novel motifs through in vitro selection of nuclease-stable sequence space. This approach is desirable because the catalysts can be optimized to function under simulated physiological conditions.

Utilizing in vitro selection, we have identified a nuclease-stable phosphodiesterase that demonstrated optimal activity at simulated physiological conditions. The initial library of 10(14) unique molecules contained 40 randomized nucleotides with all pyrimidines in a nuclease-stabilized 2'-deoxy-2'-amino format. The selection required trans-cleaving activity and base-pairing specificity towards a resin-bound RNA substrate. Initial selective pressure was permissive, with a 30 min reaction time and 25 mM Mg(2+). Stringency of selection pressure was gradually increased until final conditions of 1 mM Mg(2+) and less than 1 min reaction times were achieved. The resulting 61-mer catalyst required the 2'-amino substitutions at selected pyrimidine positions and was stable in human serum (half-life of 16 h).

We demonstrated that it is possible to identify completely novel, nuclease-resistant ribozymes capable of trans-cleaving target RNAs at physiologically relevant Mg(2+) concentrations. The new ribozyme motif has minimal substrate requirements, allowing for a wide range of potential RNA targets.
