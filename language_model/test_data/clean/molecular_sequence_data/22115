The protein Fip1 is an important subunit of the eukaryotic polyadenylation apparatus, since it provides a bridge of sorts between poly(A) polymerase, other subunits of the polyadenylation apparatus, and the substrate RNA. In this study, a previously unreported Arabidopsis Fip1 homolog is characterized. The gene for this protein resides on chromosome V and encodes a 1196-amino acid polypeptide. Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro assays indicate that the N-terminal 137 amino acids of the Arabidopsis Fip1 protein interact with poly(A) polymerase (PAP). This domain also stimulates the activity of the PAP. Interestingly, this part of the Arabidopsis Fip1 interacts with Arabidopsis homologs of CstF77, CPSF30, CFIm-25, and PabN1. The interactions with CstF77, CPSF30, and CFIm-25 are reminiscent in various respects of similar interactions seen in yeast and mammals, although the part of the Arabidopsis Fip1 protein that participates in these interactions has no apparent counterpart in other eukaryotic Fip1 proteins. Interactions between Fip1 and PabN1 have not been reported in other systems; this may represent plant-specific associations. The C-terminal 789 amino acids of the Arabidopsis Fip1 protein were found to contain an RNA-binding domain; this domain correlated with an intact arginine-rich region and had a marked preference for poly(G) among the four homopolymers studied. These results indicate that the Arabidopsis Fip1, like its human counterpart, is an RNA-binding protein. Moreover, they provide conceptual links between PAP and several other Arabidopsis polyadenylation factor subunit homologs.
