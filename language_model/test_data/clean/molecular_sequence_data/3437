Results of comparative morphological and gene analyses of the cestode Proteocephalus thymalli, an intestine parasite of the lakes Hovsogol (Thymallus arcticus nigrescens) and Lake Baikal graylings (Thymallus arcticus baicalensis) are presented for the first time. The results indicate that representatives of the P. thymalli from these fishes are really two different species.
