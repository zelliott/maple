In this study, sandwich-structured graphene/mesoporous silica composites (C8-modified graphene@mSiO(2)) were synthesized by coating mesoporous silica onto hydrophilic graphene nanosheets through a surfactant-mediated cocondensation sol-gel process. The newly prepared C8-modified graphene@mSiO(2) nanocomposites possess unique properties of extended plate-like morphology, good water dispersibility, highly open pore structure, uniform pore size (2.8 nm), high surface area (632 m(2)/g), and C8-modified-interior pore walls. The unique structure of the C8-modified graphene@mSiO(2) composite nanosheets not only provide extended planes with hydrophilic surface that prevents aggregation in solution, but also offer a huge number of C8-modified mesopores with high surface area that can ensure an efficient adsorption of peptides through hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction between C8-moified pore walls and target molecules. The obtained C8-modified graphene@mSiO(2) materials were utilized for size selectively and specifically enriching peptides in standard peptide mixtures and endogenous peptides in real biological samples (mouse brain tissue).
