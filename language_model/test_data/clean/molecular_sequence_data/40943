The aim of this review is to give a general account on the oxidative microbial degradation of flavonols. Since now 50 years, various research groups have deciphered the way microorganisms aerobically deal with this important class of flavonoids. Flavonols such as rutin and quercetin are abundantly found in vegetal tissues and exudates, and it was thus patent that various microorganisms will bear the enzymatic machinery necessary to cope with these vegetal secondary metabolites. After initial studies focussed on the general metabolic capacity of various microorganisms towards flavonols, the so called rutin catabolic pathway was rapidly established in moulds. Enzymes of the path as well as substrates and products were known at the beginning of the seventies. Then during 30 years, only sporadic studies were focused on this pathway, before a new burst of interest at the beginning of the new century arose with structural, genomic and theoretical studies mainly conducted towards quercetinase. This is the goal of this work to relate this 50 years journey at the crossroads of microbiology, biochemistry, genetic and chemistry. Some mention of the potential usefulness of the enzymes of the path as well as micro-organisms bearing the whole rutin catabolic pathway is also discussed.
