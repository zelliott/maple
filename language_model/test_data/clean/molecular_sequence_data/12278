Proceeding from the structure and function of the shell glycoprotein gp120 of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and receptor glycoprotein CD4 on target cells for this virus, the author assumes that in nature there is genetically determined human resistance to the HIV infection and AIDS. This resistance manifests itself indirectly via products of the glycosylation system and via the composition and order of amino-acid residues in receptor CD4 sites responsible for interaction between the receptor and glycoprotein gp120. The author thinks that people in whom the glycosylation system determines either B(III) or AB(IV) blood groups are potential subjects of the HIV infection. But development of AIDS necessitates some conditions more, one of them is susceptibility of the human organism to be infected with mollicute Mycoplasma fermentans. This mycoplasma is able to recognize terminal NeuAc alpha 2-3 Gal in the composition of oligosaccharides of gp120, which permits it to adhere HIV virions on itself and then to transport them directly to the cells expressing receptor CD4 and having oligosaccharides of the same terminal structure. Oligosaccharides of glycocalyx of the mycoplasma protect it from the action of the human immune system and the mycoplasma, having "transported" HIV virions to target cells combines with membranes of the latter, stimulates formation by them of interleukin-1 and tumour necrosis factor, the known effectors of this virus reproduction. On the basis of all these factors the author identifies four types of human resistance to HIV/AIDS.
