A cDNA encoding the prohormone of the pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) in the moth Agrotis ipsilon was isolated. The cDNA contains 834 nucleotides, coding for a 193-amino acid protein that exhibits 89% identity with PBAN prohormones of other moths. The prohormone contains five potential peptides belonging to the FXPRL family. The peptide corresponding to the Bombyx mori diapause hormone exhibits an extra residue, and the C-terminal leucine is replaced by an isoleucine, introducing a new type of variability in this family of peptides. Northern blot analysis revealed expression in suboesophagal ganglion complexes. Constitutive heterologous expression of Agi-PBAN cDNA in yeast, using three different antibodies, did not produce PBAN-immunoreactive material.
