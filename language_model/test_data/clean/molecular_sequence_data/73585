The prp4 gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe encodes a protein kinase. A physiological substrate is not yet known. A mutational analysis of prp4 revealed that the protein consists of a short N-terminal domain, containing several essential motifs, which is followed by the kinase catalytic domain comprising the C-terminus of the protein. Overexpression of N-terminal mutations disturbs mitosis and produces elongated cells, Using a PCR approach, we isolated a putative homologue of Prp4 from human and mouse cells. The mammalian kinase domain is 53% identical to the kinase domain of Prp4. The short N-terminal domains share <20% identical amino acids, but contain conserved motifs. A fusion protein consisting of the N-terminal region from S. pombe followed by the mammalian kinase domain complements a temperature-sensitive prp4 mutation of S. pombe. Prp4 and the recombinant yeast/mouse protein kinase phosphorylate the human SR splicing factor ASF/SF2 in vitro in its RS domain.
