A mutation in the Schizosaccharomyces pombe sid4(+) (septation initiation defective) gene was isolated in a screen for mutants defective in cytokinesis. We have cloned sid4(+) and have found that sid4(+) encodes a previously unknown 76.4-kDa protein that localizes to the spindle pole body (SPB) throughout the cell cycle. Sid4p is required for SPB localization of key regulators of septation initiation, including the GTPase Spg1p, the protein kinase Cdc7p, and the GTPase-activating protein Byr4p. An N-terminally truncated Sid4p mutant does not localize to SPBs and when overproduced acts as a dominant-negative mutant by titrating endogenous Sid4p and Spg1p from the SPB. Conversely, the Sid4p N-terminal 153 amino acids are sufficient for SPB localization. Biochemical studies demonstrate that Sid4p interacts with itself, and yeast two-hybrid analysis shows that its self-interaction domain lies within the C-terminal half of the protein. Our data indicate that Sid4p SPB localization is a prerequisite for the execution of the Spg1p signaling cascade.
