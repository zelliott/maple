The area of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) comprising residues 140 and 160 of capsid protein VP1 has been used extensively as an immunogen in natural and experimental hosts. A detailed epitope mapping of this region, however, has not been reported. For this purpose a synthetic peptide containing the residues 135 to 160 (p135-160) of VP1 of FMDV O1 Campos was analyzed for its T- and B-cell epitopes. The p135-160 is highly immunogenic, either by itself or coupled to a carrier protein (BSA), elicits a long-lasting neutralizing antibody response in mice, and provides solid protection against virulent challenge. By using a set of synthetic 10mer overlapping peptides, which cover the entire sequence 135-160 of VP1, we have shown that at least four discrete B epitopes are regularly distributed along the peptide. Although immunization with each of the 10mers coupled with BSA as a carrier protein induced peptide-specific antibody responses, individually none of the 10mers was able to induce neutralizing antibodies. However, anti-135-160 antibodies sorted by immunoaffinity chromatography using each of the 10mers revealed the existence of at least four discrete neutralizing sites: one spanning residues 135-144, at least two more between residues 140 and 154, and another in the region 150-160. Moreover, T-cell epitopes were identified, both by antigen-dependent proliferation assays and by adoptive cell transfer. By both methods, a T-cell epitope was located in the area comprising residues 135-144; the cell transfer experiment, which seems to be more sensitive, also identified a second T-cell epitope between residues 150 and 160. Interestingly, when the region 135-144, which contains both B- and T-cell epitopes, was in a tandem repeat configuration it induced a strong neutralizing antibody response in mice and solid protection against the challenge.
