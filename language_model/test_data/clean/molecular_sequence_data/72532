The target cell antigen(s) on tumor cells and on protozoan parasites recognized by NK and nonspecific cytotoxic cells (NCC) has not yet been specifically identified. NCC may be the teleost equivalent of NK cells and IL-2-activated NK cells. A ligand recognized by NCC has been identified. It is expressed on both protozoan parasites and mammalian tumor target cells. In the present study, a protozoan parasite antigen (NK target antigen/NKTag/p46) was purified from Tetrahymena pyriformis and the entire amino acid sequence was deduced from cDNA. Soluble and purified NKTag inhibited NCC lysis of human and mouse transformed target cells. Homology comparisons using Swissprot database revealed that NKTag is a novel protein. Molecular weight computation of the deduced sequence demonstrated that NKTag is a 48.17-kDa protein containing 422 amino acids with relatively high percentages of tyrosine and serine residues. Expression of NKTag on various mammalian tumor target cells, normal tissue, and T. pyriformis was determined using anti-multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) monoclonal antibody (mab) 22A12 [generated against an N-terminal 20-mer (aa 61-80) of p46]. This mab bound to tissue-cultured and tumor cells (YAC-1, IM-9, NC-37, MOLT-4, and U937) with low levels of binding to fish, mouse, and equine cells. Studies were also done to determine if purified and iodinated NKTag bound specifically to NCC. Binding was saturable and specific. These data provide evidence that NCC recognize a target cell ligand which is found on both protozoan and tumor cells. This may provide an explanation as to how NCC (including activated NK cells) recognize a vast array of targets in the absence of haplotype recognition and in spite of a diverse species of origin.
