The outer membrane phospholipase A (OMPLA) of Enterobacteriaceae has been proposed to span the membrane 14 times as antiparallel amphipathic beta-strands, thereby exposing seven loops to the cell surface. We have employed the epitope insertion method to probe the topology of OMPLA of Salmonella typhimurium. First, missense mutations were introduced at various positions in the pldA gene, encoding OMPLA, to create unique BamHI sites. These BamHI sites were subsequently used to insert linkers, encoding a 16-amino-acid B-cell epitope. Proper assembly of all mutant proteins was revealed by their heat modifiability in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The accessibility of the inserted epitopes was assessed. Immunofluorescence analysis of intact cells with antibodies against the inserted epitope showed that three of seven predicted loops are indeed cell surface exposed. Trypsin accessibility experiments verified the cell surface exposure of two additional loops and provided support for the proposed periplasmic localization of three predicted turns. For two other predicted exposed loops, the results were not conclusive. These results support to a large extent the proposed topology model of OMPLA. Furthermore, the observation that the substitutions Glu66Pro and Glu247Gly virtually abolished enzymatic activity indicates that these residues might play a major role in catalysis.
