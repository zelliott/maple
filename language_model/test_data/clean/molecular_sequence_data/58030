Recombinant nidogen fragments comprising the globular domains G1 plus G2, the rod-like domain, and the rod connected to the globe G3 were prepared from the culture media of transfected human cell clones. In addition, domains G1 and G2 were separated from each other after cleavage with chymotrypsin. The purified fragments were characterized by N-terminal sequences, electrophoresis, electron microscopy, and radioimmunoassays and the cell clones by Northern hybridization. Transfection with a construct comprising a large part of domain G3 showed high mRNA levels but no secreted protein, indicating a protein folding problem. All these fragments were used as soluble and/or immobilized ligands in binding assays. This demonstrated major binding sites on domain G2 for collagen IV and heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Affinity chromatography on zinc- and cobalt-loaded columns showed binding of domains G2 and G3 and the rod. Protein binding, but not metal binding, was abolished by reduction and alkylation of nidogen. This allowed for the isolation of several zinc-binding tryptic peptides, four from G2, two from the rod, and one from the G3 domain. Most of these short peptides contained several histidines that are likely to mediate binding. Zinc inhibited efficiently G3-mediated nidogen binding to laminin at 4 degrees C (IC50 approximately 5 microM) but less at higher temperatures. Similarly, zinc inhibited binding to collagen IV and proteoglycan at low temperatures but not at high (37 degrees C) temperatures. This indicates a complex modulation of nidogen binding to other basement membrane proteins by some, but not all, transition metals. Whether the particularly striking effects shown for zinc are of biological relevance remains to be established.
