Antisera against vertebrate calcium-binding proteins cross-react with Drosophila nervous and muscle tissue. We have used an antiserum against carp parvalbumin to isolate from a Drosophila head cDNA library immunopositive expression clones. Tissue in situ hybridization identified a clone that labeled specific neurons and muscles similar to the parvalbumin-like immunohistochemical staining pattern. Five independent cDNAs derive from an mRNA whose open reading frame codes for a 310 amino acid polypeptide. Sequence analysis identifies six EF-hand calcium-binding domains and reveals 42% and 37% homology to chicken calretinin and calbindin D-28k, respectively. Since the positions of 9 out of 10 introns within the ORF are conserved from the Drosophila gene to both vertebrate genes, we conclude that we have identified the first invertebrate member of the calbindin sub-family of calcium-binding protein genes of the EF-hand homolog family. The calbindin-32 gene (cbn) maps to 53E on the second chromosome. It is expressed through most of ontogenesis with a selective distribution in the nervous system and in a few small adult thoracic muscles. The cloning of a Drosophila homolog to vertebrate neuronal Ca(2+)-binding proteins opens new routes to study the so far largely elusive function of these brain molecules.
