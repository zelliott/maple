Complementary DNA segments that encode different domains of human and rat androgen receptors were fused to the Escherichia coli trpE gene using pATH expression vectors. Fusion proteins expressed by the bacteria were used to immunize rats and rabbits to obtain polyclonal antibodies to androgen receptors. Spleen cells of immunized rats were fused with myeloma cells to obtain stable hybridomas that produced monoclonal antibodies. Gradient centrifugation and immuno-precipitation assays indicated that the antibodies interacted with androgen receptors specifically.
