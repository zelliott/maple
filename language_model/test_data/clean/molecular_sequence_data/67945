Cytochrome b(559)' is a transmembrane protein formed by homodimerization of the 44-residue PsbF polypeptide and noncovalent binding of a heme cofactor. The PsbF polypeptide can dimerize in the absence and presence of heme. To monitor structural alterations associated with binding of heme to the apo-cytochrome, we analyzed the apo- and holo-cytochrome structure by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Spin labeling of amino acids located close to the heme binding domain of the cytochrome revealed that the structure of the heme binding domain is unconstrained in the absence of heme. Heme binding restricts the conformational dynamics of the heme binding domain, resulting in the structurally more constricted holo-cytochrome structure.
