We have previously reported that the HMRa-bearing restriction fragment of a rho degrees sir4-11 strain (HMLalpha-MATalpha-HMRa), which acts as an alpha-mater because of being rho degrees , changes its electrophoretic mobility when the strain mates with a certain group of a-mating strains (HMLalpha-MATa-HMRa). In this study, we found that the sir4-11 strain being rho degrees was not essential for this phenomenon and also that the altered form of the fragment contained HMRalpha in place of HMRa. Furthermore, we observed conversion of HMLa to HMLalpha in the cross in which a sir4-11 HMLa-MATalpha-HMRalpha strain was mated with a representative of the above-mentioned a-mating strain. In addition, when this a-mating strain was mated with a SIR(+) HMLalpha-MATa-HMRalpha strain, the resultant diploid was found to be HMLalpha/HMLalpha MATa/MATalphaHMRa/HMRalpha, indicating that conversion of MATa to MATalpha had taken place in the course of mating. From all these observations, we conclude that there is a group of S. cerevisiae strains that carries factor(s) that induces conversion of a mating-type cassette of the mating partner to alpha mating-type cassette and that this mating type cassette conversion takes place in all three mating type loci, HML, MAT and HMR, if the loci are in the non-silenced condition.
