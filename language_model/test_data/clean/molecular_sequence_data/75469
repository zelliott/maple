The location of unpaired adenine residues within the secondary structure of rabbit 18S ribosomal RNA was determined by chemical probing. Naked 18S rRNA was first prepared by digestion of purified 40S subunits with matrix-bound proteinase K in sodium dodecyl sulfate, thereby omitting the use of nucleic acid denaturants. Adenines within naked 18S rRNA were chemically probed by using either diethyl pyrocarbonate or dimethyl sulfate, which specifically react with unpaired nucleotides [Peattie, D. A., & Gilbert, W. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77, 4679-4682]. Adenine modification sites were identified by polyacrylamide sequencing gel electrophoresis either upon aniline-induced strand scission of 32P-end-labeled intact and fragmented rRNA or by primer extension using sequence-specific DNA oligomers with reverse transcriptase. The data indicate good agreement between the general pattern of adenine reactivity and the location of unpaired regions in 18S rRNA determined by comparative sequence analysis [Chan, Y.-L., Gutell, R., Noller, H. F., & Wool, I. G. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 224-230]. The overall reactivity of adenine residues toward single-strand-specific chemical probes was, also, similar for both rabbit and Escherichia coli small rRNA. The number of strongly reactive adenines appearing within phylogenetically determined helical segments, however, was greater in rabbit 18S rRNA than for E. coli 16S rRNA. Some of these adenines were found clustered in specific helices. Such differences suggest a greater irregularity of many of the helical elements within mammalian 18S rRNA, as compared with prokaryotic 16S rRNA. These helical irregularities could be important for protein association and also may represent biologically relevant flexible regions of the molecule.
