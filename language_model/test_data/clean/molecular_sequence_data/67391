Mutations in the ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A, member 4 (ABCA4), elongation             of very long chain fatty acids 4 (ELOVL4) and peripherin-2 (PRPH2) genes have             been identified in patients with Stargardt macular degeneration (STGD). The aim             of this study was to investigate which of these genes is responsible for susceptibility             in Chinese patients. A total of 41 probands with STGD or suspected STGD were enrolled             in the study. The coding regions and adjacent intronic sequences of the ELOVL4             and PRPH2 genes and 3 coding exons of the ABCA4 gene were amplified by polymerase             chain reaction (PCR). The nucleotide sequences of the amplicons were determined             by Sanger sequencing. Three novel heterozygous missense mutations in the ABCA4             gene were identified: c:2633C>A (p:Ser878X), c:5646G>A (p:Met1882Ile) and             c:6389T>A (p:Met2130Lys). These mutations were not present in 176 normal individuals             and were predicted to be pathogenic. Two benign variations were found: a reported             variation, c:5682G>C in ABCA4 and a novel variation, c:699G>A in ELOVL4.             In addition, 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs: rs3812153, rs7764439, rs390659,             rs434102 and c:929G>A) were detected in ELOVL4 and PRPH2. The c:929G>A variation             has not been previously reported. We conclude that no pathogenic variations in             ELOVL4 and PRPH2 were detected in the Chinese STGD patients. Our results imply             that ABCA4 is more likely to be significant in Chinese STGD patients.
