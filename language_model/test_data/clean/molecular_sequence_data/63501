The ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete Tricholoma matsutake produces commercially valuable fruit bodies, matsutake, in forests. Here we report a PCR system targeting retroelement integration sites to differentiate among individual Asian isolates of T. matsutake based on their geographical origins, such as Japan, the area of South Korea through North Korea, the northeastern provinces of China, and the area of the southwestern provinces of China through Bhutan. The overall misjudgment rate of the analytical system was approximately 5% based on 95 samples of T. matsutake examined including those from cultures and from commodities. We also provide evidence that T. matsutake isolates grown throughout the Far East, including the northeastern provinces of China, are closely related to each other while distinct from those in the area of the southwestern provinces of China through Bhutan. The method allows us to trace back geographical origins of Asian matsutake, thus contributing to food safety, appropriate tariffs, and proper price setting.
