The Drosophila cactus and dorsal proteins are required for the development of embryonic dorso-ventral polarity and probably also for the innate immune response of the insect. Like their mammalian counterparts (the cytoplasmic anchor protein I kappa B and the rel/NF kappa B transcription factors) cactus and dorsal are regulated at the level of nuclear localisation. We showed previously that increased intra-cellular calcium levels induced by the ionophore ionomycin can activate dorsal/cactus complexes in the Drosophila cell line SL2. In order to study further the activation of dorsal/cactus complexes by calcium, we have prepared a cell line (SLDL) in which dorsal is expressed constitutively. In this paper we show that in SLDL cells ionomycin induces a rapid destruction of cactus and dephosphorylation of dorsal. These results suggest a role for the protein phosphatase calcineurin in calcium mediated activation of dorsal/cactus complexes. They also indicate that in the resting cell constitutive phosphorylation of dorsal is in equilibrium with calcium dependent dephosphorylation.
