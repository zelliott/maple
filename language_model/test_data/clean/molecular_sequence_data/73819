NAD+-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (type-I 15-PGDH) inactivates prostaglandins. We recently reported an mRNA sequence coding for a predicted isomer (PGDH(rI)) of this enzyme. The TT cell line, derived from medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), expresses mRNAs for both isomers. We report here the expression by TT cells and MTC of a third 15-PGDH related mRNA (PGDH(rII)), 241 nt shorter than type-I 15-PGDH. RNase protection assays confirmed that TT cells expressed this mRNA (PGDH(rII)). Thus different splicing patterns could be involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of type-I 15-PGDH gene in MTC.
