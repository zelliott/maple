We report here on the cloning, characterization and radiation hybrid mapping of the canine basic keratin gene KRT2p. The gene spans 8.3 kb, consists of nine exons and eight introns, and is characterized by the typical features of both basic keratins and keratins in general, including glycine-rich head and tail domains, which flank an alpha-helical rod domain of approximately 310 amino acids. Comparisons of sequence and structure reveal that canine KRT2p is strikingly similar to human KRT2p. Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences for human and dog reveals greater than 80% identity. In the rod domain, the amino acid identity exceeds 90%. We note, however, that canine KRT2p encodes a protein 21 residues longer than human K2p due to the insertion of a glycine repeat motif, GG(G)X, in the head and tail domains of the canine gene. This is the first report of the nearly complete genome sequence for KRT2p of any organism. Radiation hybrid mapping of canine KRT2p to chromosome 27 of the dog is also reported.
