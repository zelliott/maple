The 3'UTR of the transition protein 2 gene of several mammalian species was sequenced and the transcript level of this gene was determined by Northern blots. In all species tested so far, a Northern blot detectable transcript level was associated with the presence of a conserved 8 bp motif (GCYATCAY) 50 bp downstream of the stop codon. RNA-bandshift experiments indicate that this region is capable of binding a cytosolic protein factor from rat testis. These findings support our hypothesis that the low transcript level of the transition protein 2 gene in human is due to insufficient storage of the mRNA as ribonucleic/protein particle.
