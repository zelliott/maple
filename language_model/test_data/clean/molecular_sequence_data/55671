This study investigates the functional state of the stimulatory GTP-binding protein GS in neuroblastoma x glioma NG108-15 hybrid cells chronically exposed to an opioid. For this purpose, a novel in situ reconstitution protocol was established using membranes selectively depleted of GS function by transient exposure to low pH and then reconstituted with purified exogenous stimulatory GTP-binding proteins. With prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) receptor-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity as an indicator, reconstituted membranes of cells previously rendered tolerant to the delta-opioid [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE) exhibited approximately 3-fold elevated cAMP generation upon stimulation with PGE1, compared with nontolerant reconstituted cell membranes. This effect developed dose-dependently with respect to the opioid concentration used for pretreatment of the cells and was blocked by concomitant exposure to naloxone. In contrast, receptor-independent activation of GS by the stable GTP analogue guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate did not reveal any difference in adenylate cyclase activity between reconstituted membranes of control and chronically DADLE-pretreated cells. Furthermore, the functional activity of endogenous GS displayed no difference between control and DADLE-tolerant cells, as assessed in S49 cyc- reconstitution assays using sodium cholate extracts derived from NG108-15 membranes. The data presented suggest that the increase in PGE1 receptor-mediated adenylate cyclase activity in opioid-tolerant/dependent NG108-15 hybrid cells most likely relates to enhanced coupling efficiency between the PGE1 binding site (receptor) and GS. Moreover, our results support the concept that supersensitivity to excitatory drugs reflects an adaptive mechanism of cells chronically exposed to an opioid.
