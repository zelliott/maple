The sequence of 5,037 amino acids composing the ryanodine receptor from rabbit skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum has been deduced by cloning and sequencing the complementary DNA. The predicted structure suggests that the calcium release channel activity resides in the C-terminal region of the receptor molecule, whereas the remaining portion constitutes the 'foot' structure spanning the junctional gap between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the transverse tubule.
