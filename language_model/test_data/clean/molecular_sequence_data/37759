As a prelude to developing engineered resistance to two important potyvirus pathogens of cowpea, a phylogenetic analysis of strains of Cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus (CAbMV) and Bean common mosaic virus--blackeye cowpea strain (BCMV-B1C) was undertaken. Nucleotide sequences for the coat protein genes and 3'-untranslated regions of four CAbMV and one BCMV-B1C strains were determined and included in an analysis with published sequences. While all the newly sequenced viruses showed strong homology with the existing respective sequences in the database, the CAbMV group showed a divergence into two subgroups. These groups differed from each other by more than some CAbMV strains differed from the South African Passiflora virus (CAbMV-SAP), which has distinct biological characteristics. The implications of the sequence analyses are discussed with respect to a strategy for the generation of engineered resistance to both groups of viruses.
