Antibodies were raised against three peptides corresponding to the potential protein phosphorylation sites of rat-brain sodium channels by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). One of the antibody against sequence (C561-575) reacted to the channel molecule. This immunoreaction occurred in a sequence-specific manner, as it was inhibited by the antigen peptide itself but not inhibited by two other peptides. Although PKA phosphorylates two synthetic peptides, C561-575 and C681-689, of the three, anti-(C561-575) antibody can only inhibit the phosphorylation of peptide (C561-575). PKA catalyzed the incorporation of 3.1-3.5 mol of phosphates into the alpha subunit of the purified sodium channel. The anti-(C561-575) antibody inhibited the channel phosphorylation by 40%. Digestion of the phosphorylated sodium channel with lysyl endoproteinase yielded four major phosphorylated fragments of 3.5, 5.0, 7.0, and 10 kDa. However, similar digestion of the channel that was phosphorylated in the presence of anti-(C561-575) antibody did not yield the phosphorylated fragment of 3.5 kDa and gave the 7.0 kDa fragment in reducing yield. Inspection of these phosphorylated fragments by the predicted sizes of the peptide fragments containing the five potential phosphorylation sites gives a conclusion that anti-(C561-575) antibody inhibits the phosphorylation on Ser-573 completely, and on either Ser-610 or Ser-623 partially, probably due to their proximity orientation in the tertiary structure.
