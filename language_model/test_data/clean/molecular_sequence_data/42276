Neutrophils and macrophages are known to undergo significant modifications in their morphology and basal metabolism in response to chemical factors, in particular changes in the shape, movement, phagocytic activity and degranulation. These phenomena often involve an increase in chemokinesis and cellular secretory activity, usually expressed in antimicrobial activity. Once activated, the cells can move quickly towards the source of the stimulus, where they produce and release great amounts of enzymes (e.g. proteases, hydrolases, lysozyme) and reactive oxygen metabolites (e.g. O2-., H2O2, OH.). This study has examined the ability of surfaces of selected biomaterials to influence neutrophil morphology and locomotion. The surface of two films derived from hyaluronic acid derivatives were compared with that of glass. The two hyaluronic acid derivatives, despite having a similar chemical structure, were shown to interact with human neutrophils in different ways. A hyaluronic acid ethyl ester stimulated the whole population of neutrophils to take up a non-spherical morphology (polarize) and to move with a velocity similar to that of N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine-stimulated cells on a glass surface. In contrast, only 44% of the examined cells on the surface of hyaluronic acid benzyl ester were polarized and their mean speed was only slightly higher with respect to that found with non-stimulated cells on glass. Moreover, while on the benzyl ester and on glass a correlation between neutrophil circularity (i.e. the shape of the cell) and cell speed was found, the ethyl ester did not show any correlation.
