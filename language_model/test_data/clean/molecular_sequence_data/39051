From a crude extract of the sinus glands of the shrimp Penaeus (litopenaeus) schmitti a peptide with hyperglycemic activity in a homologous bioassay was isolated and characterized by a combination of automatic Edman degradation, enzymatic digestions, TLC of dansyl-amino acids, and mass spectrometry. Its M(r) is 8359.4 Da by MS, which coincides with the deduced sequence. Its N-terminus is free and its C-terminus is amidated. It has 6 Cys residues in conserved positions compared with other known CHHs. This is the first sinus gland hormone from an Atlantic Ocean shrimp characterized to date. It has a remarkable 90% sequence similarity to the Indo-Pacific shrimp P. (marsupenaeus) japonicus Pej-VII hyperglycemic hormone.
