A new species of Phacidiopycnis associated with pome fruits is described. The fungus causes fruit rot on apples during storage and is associated with a twig dieback and canker disease of crabapple trees and dead twigs of pear trees. To characterize the biology of the fungus and compare it with Ph. piri, the type species of the genus, effects of nine media and light on mycelial growth and pycnidial production, mycelial growth in response to temperature and mode of conidial germination in response to nutrient were determined. Apple-juice agar, pear-juice agar, prune-juice agar, potato-dextrose agar (PDA) and malt-extract agar, Czapek-Dox agar and oatmeal agar (OMA) favored mycelial growth. Cornmeal agar (CMA) did not favor mycelial growth. Light effect on pycnidial formation was medium dependent. Abundant pycnidia with mature conidia formed in 14 d old PDA and OMA cultures at 20 C, regardless of light, whereas none or very few pycnidia formed on other media in the dark. Fluorescent light stimulated formation of pycnidia except on CMA. The fungus grew at -3-25 C, with optimum growth at 15-20 C. Conidia germinated either by forming germ tubes or less often by budding. Budding of conidia occurred in 1 and 10% pear-juice solutions but not in 100% pear-juice solution. Six isolates of Ph. washingtonensis from different species of pome fruits had identical ITS sequences. The sizes of the ITS region were the same for both Ph. washingtonensis and Ph. piri, and four polymorphic nucleotide sites were found in the ITS region between Ph. washingtonensis and Ph. piri. The similarity in ITS sequences between these two taxa is confirmatory evidence for the erection of the new species of Phacidiopycnis associated with pome fruits we describe here.
