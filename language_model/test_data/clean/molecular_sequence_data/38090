cDNA clones encoding sweet potato AGPase large subunit (iAGPLI) from the cDNA library constructed from the tuberous root were isolated. Two clones were characterized and named iAGPLI-a and iAGPLI-b. They were 1,661 bp and 1,277 bp in length and contained partial open reading frames of 450 and 306 amino acids, respectively. Both nucleic acid and amino acid sequence identities between iAGPLI-a and iAGPLI-b were 83.8% and 97.3%, respectively. Based on the amino acid sequence analysis, iAGPLI-a and iAGPLI-b share the highest sequence identity (81%) with potato AGPase large subunit. The iAGPLI-a and iAGPLI-b genes were expressed predominantly in the stem and weakly in the tuberous root, and no transcript was expressed in other tissues. The sweet potato genome contains several copies of the iAGPLI gene.
