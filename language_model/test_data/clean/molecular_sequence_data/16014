To identify which segments of the beta 1 domain of the E beta k polypeptide control T cell recognition of antigen, E beta genes were constructed with in-phase insertion mutations. Five independent mutants, with insertions mapping to positions 24, 50 and 93 of the E beta k polypeptide, were obtained. Cell lines expressing these mutated genes were analysed by microfluorometry using a panel of 20 anti-Ek monoclonal antibodies. None of the tested in-phase insertions has resulted in the loss of antibody binding sites. In striking contrast, mutations at position 93 and at a lesser level 50 were indicative of a crucial role of the corresponding regions in T-cell recognition, because they led to significant or complete loss of antigen-presenting function with all but one of the T hybridomas tested. These data are discussed with regard to a model of the foreign antigen binding site of Ia molecules.
