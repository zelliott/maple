Conditioned medium (secretome) derived from an enriched stem cell culture stimulates chemotaxis of human fibroblasts. These cells are classified as multipotent murine mesenchymal stromal cells (mMSC) by immunochemical analysis of marker proteins. Proteomic analysis of mMSC secretome identifies nineteen secreted proteins, including extracellular matrix structural proteins, collagen processing enzymes, pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) and cystatin C. Immunodepletion and reconstitution experiments show that PEDF is the predominant fibroblast chemoattractant in the conditioned medium, and immunofluorescence microscopy shows strong staining for PEDF in the cytoplasm, at the cell surface, and in intercellular space between mMSCs. This stimulatory effect of PEDF on fibroblast chemotaxis is in contrast to the PEDF-mediated inhibition of endothelial cell migration, reported previously. These differential functional effects of PEDF toward fibroblasts and endothelial cells may serve to program an ordered temporal sequence of scaffold building followed by angiogenesis during wound healing.
