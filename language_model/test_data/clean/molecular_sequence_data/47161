Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) was found to exhibit a type III secretion-dependent, contact-mediated, hemolytic activity requiring the EspA, EspB, and EspD secreted proteins. EspB and EspD display homology to pore-forming molecules. Our data suggest a mechanism to explain the requirement for all three Esp proteins in the transfer of EPEC proteins, such as Tir, into target cells.
