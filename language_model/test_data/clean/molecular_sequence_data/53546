The new genus Leifsonia gen. nov. with two new species, Leifsonia poae sp. nov. (type strain VKM Ac-1401T) and Leifsonia aquatica (ex Leifson 1962) nom. rev., comb. nov. (the type species, with VKM Ac-1400T = DSM 20146T = JCM 1368T as type strain), is proposed to accommodate bacteria found in Poa annua root gall, induced by the nematode Subanguina radicicola, and 'Corynebacterium aquaticum' Leifson 1962. Further, it is proposed to reclassify Clavibacter xyli Davis et al. 1984 with two subspecies in the new genus as Leifsonia xyli (Davis et al. 1984) comb. nov., Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli (Davis et al. 1984) comb. nov. and Leifsonia xyli subsp. cynodontis (Davis et al. 1984) comb. nov. Members of the proposed genus are characterized by coryneform morphology, peptidoglycans based upon 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, the major menaquinone MK-11, phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol as principal phospholipids, the high content of anteiso- and iso-branched saturated fatty acids, and a DNA G+C base composition of 66-73 mol%. They form a distinct phylogenetic branch attached to the line of descent of Agromyces spp. The new and reclassified species of the new genus clearly differ from each other phylogenetically and phenetically and can be recognized by their morphologies, the cell wall sugar composition, the requirement of complex media for growth, and numerous physiological characteristics, including the oxidase reaction.
