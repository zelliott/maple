Copper is an essential trace element which forms an integral component of many enzymes. While trace amounts of copper are needed to sustain life, excess copper is extremely toxic. An attempt is made here to present the current understanding of the normal transport of copper in relation to the absorption, intracellular transport and toxicity. Wilson disease is a genetic disorder of copper transport resulting in the accumulation of copper in organs such as liver and brain which leads to progressive hepatic and neurological damage. The gene responsible for Wilson disease (ATP7B) is predicted to encode a putative copper-transporting P-type ATPase. An important feature of this ATPase is the presence of a large N-terminal domain that contains six repeats of a copper-binding motif which is thought to be responsible for binding this metal prior to its transport across the membrane. We have cloned, expressed and purified the N-terminal domain (approximately 70 kD) of Wilson disease ATPase. Metal-binding properties of the domain showed the protein to bind several metals besides copper; however, copper has a higher affinity for the domain. The copper is bound to the domain in Cu(I) form with a copper: protein ratio of 6.5:1. X-ray absorption studies strongly suggest Cu(I) atoms are ligated to cysteine residues. Circular dichroism spectral analyses suggest both secondary and tertiary structural changes upon copper binding to the domain. Copper-binding studies suggest some degree of cooperativity in binding of copper. These studies as well as detailed structural information of the copper-binding domain will be crucial in determining the specific role played by the copper-transporting ATPase in the homeostatic control of copper in the body and how the transport of copper is interrupted by mutations in the ATPase gene.
