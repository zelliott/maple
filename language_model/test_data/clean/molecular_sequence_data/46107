G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are a superfamily of receptors that are vital in a wide array of physiological processes. Modulation of GPCR signaling has been an intensive area of therapeutic study, mainly due to the diverse pathophysiological significance of GPCRs. Pepducins are cell-penetrating lipidated peptides designed to target the intracellular loops of the GPCR of interest. Pepducins can function as agonists or antagonists of their cognate receptor, making them highly useful compounds for the study of GPCR signaling. Pepducins have been used to control platelet-dependent hemostasis and thrombosis, tumor growth, invasion, and angiogenesis, as well as to improve sepsis outcomes in mice. Pepducins have been successfully designed against a wide variety of GPCRs including the protease-activated receptors (PAR1, 2, 4), the chemokine receptors (CXCR1, 2, 4), the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1P3), the adrenergic receptor (ADRA1B), and have the potential to help reveal the functions of intractable GPCRs. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and biodistribution studies have showed that pepducins are widely distributed throughout the body except the brain and possess appropriate drug-like properties for use in vivo. Here, we discuss the delivery, pharmacology, and biodistribution of pepducins, as well as the effects of pepducins in models of inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and angiogenesis.
