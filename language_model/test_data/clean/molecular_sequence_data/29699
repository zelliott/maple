The first 57 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site of the human CYP17 (hCYP17) gene are essential for both basal and cAMP-dependent transcription. EMSA carried out by incubating H295R adrenocortical cell nuclear extracts with radiolabeled -57/-38 probe from the hCYP17 promoter showed the formation of three DNA-protein complexes. The fastest complex contained steroidogenic factor (SF-1) and p54(nrb)/NonO, the intermediate complex contained p54(nrb)/NonO and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor (PSF), and the slowest complex contained an SF-1/PSF/p54(nrb)/NonO complex. (Bu)(2)cAMP treatment resulted in a cAMP-inducible increase in the binding intensity of only the upper complex and also activated hCYP17 gene transcription. SF-1 coimmunoprecipitated with p54(nrb)/NonO, indicating direct interaction between these proteins. Functional assays revealed that PSF represses basal transcription. Further, the repression of hCYP17 promoter-reporter construct luciferase activity resulted from PSF interacting with the corepressor mSin3A. Trichostatin A attenuated the inhibition of basal transcription, suggesting that a histone deacetylase interacts with the SF-1/PSF/p54(nrb)/NonO/mSin3A complex. Our studies lend support to the idea that the balance between transcriptional activation and repression is essential in the control of adrenocortical steroid hormone biosynthesis.
