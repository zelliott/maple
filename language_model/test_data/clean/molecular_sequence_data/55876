Three new phenylethanoid glycosides, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl-beta-D-apiosyl-(1----6)-beta-D-glucopy  ranoside(osmanthuside H), 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl 5-O-trans-p-coumaroyl-beta-D-apiosyl(1----6)-beta-D-gluc+  ++ opy ranoside (osmanthuside I) and 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl 5-O-trans-feruloyl-beta-D-apiosyl-(1----6)-beta-D-glucopy  r ano side (osmanthuside J), were isolated from the bark of Osmanthus asiaticus. The structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic evidence.
