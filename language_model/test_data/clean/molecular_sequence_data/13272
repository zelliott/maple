From an extract of a Streptomyces culture, we identified and purified a novel compound, NP-06, which is active against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro. Analyses indicate that NP-06 is a hydrophobic 21-mer oligopeptide, N terminally cyclized through the side chain of Asp-9, containing two intramolecular cystine linkages with a molecular weight of 2,163.4. The 50% inhibitory concentrations were 2.8 and 1.3 microM when NP-06 was tested for in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity in ATH8 cells and phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, respectively, NP-06 appears to block the early stage of HIV-1 infection, most likely at the stage of virus-cell fusion.
