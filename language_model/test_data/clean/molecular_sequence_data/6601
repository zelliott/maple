Capsular polysaccharide (CPS) was obtained by water-saline extraction of the Alteromonas sp. CMM 155. On the basis of solvolysis with anhydrous HF and 1H- and 13C-NMR spectral data, including NOE experiments, it was concluded that the capsular polysaccharide had the following structure containing novel N-acyl-amino sugar and bacillosamine residues: --> 3)-alpha-D-GalpNAc-(1 --> 4)-alpha-L-GalApNAc(1 --> 3)- alpha-D-QuipNAc4NAc-(1 --> 3)-beta-D-Quip4NAlaAc-(1 -->
