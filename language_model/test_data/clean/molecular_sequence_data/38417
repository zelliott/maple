Sequence blocks within the core region were swapped among RNA polymerase II promoters to explore effects on transcription in vitro. The pair of blocks flanking TATA strongly influenced general transcription, with an additional effect on promoter activation. These flanking elements induced a change in the ratio of activated to basal transcription, whereas swapping TATA and initiator sequences only altered general transcription levels. Swapping the flanking blocks influenced binding by general transcription factors TBP and TFIIB. The results suggest that the architecture of the extended core sequence is important in determining promoter-specific effects on both general transcription levels and the tightness of regulation.
