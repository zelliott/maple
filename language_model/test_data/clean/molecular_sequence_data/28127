A highly repeated sequence on the murine Y chromosome was cloned and characterized. The DNA sequence of the viral long terminal repeats (LTRs) showed that the 5' and 3' LTRs were approximately 90% homologous. The LTRs are generally unrelated to any previously reported viral LTR but are somewhat similar to the viruslike 30S sequences.
