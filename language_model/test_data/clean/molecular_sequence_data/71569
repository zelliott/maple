A cDNA encoding omega-3 fatty acid desaturase was isolated from developing perilla seeds and characterized. On the basis of its deduced amino acid sequence comparison, this cDNA was assumed to be a new isoform of microsomal omega-3 fatty acid desaturase gene. Accumulation of the mRNA for this cDNA showed seed-specific expression.
