The Paramecium primaurelia cell surface is covered with a high molecular weight protein called the surface antigen. Several genes encode alternative surface antigens, but only one is expressed at a time. In addition, each of these genes shows a high degree of allelic polymorphism. Paramecium primaurelia strains 156 and 168 have different alleles of the G antigen gene whose respective antigens can be distinguished in vivo using specific antibodies. An interallelic exclusion phenomenon has been previously described: 94% of the 156/168 heterozygotes express only the 156 allele of the G gene; 6% express both the 156 and the 168 alleles. The phenotype of the heterozygotes is determined at the time of macronuclear differentiation. We have investigated the molecular basis for the different heterozygous phenotypes. Both mRNAs are always produced, and the 156 mRNA is always more abundant than the 168 mRNA. The relative amounts of these messages, however, vary greatly between different heterozygotes and parallel their phenotype. Pushing the analysis further, we show that the copy number of each allele in the macronucleus correlates with the relative amounts of the mRNAs. However, allelic dosage alone is not sufficient to explain the variations of the mRNA ratio. The G antigen gene is located near a telomere in the macronucleus. We show that the distance between the 156G gene and the telomere is different in homozygotes and heterozygotes. It also varies among heterozygotes and is correlated with the mRNA ratio. Thus, we have identified two different parameters, both linked to the genome rearrangements occurring during macronuclear differentiation, that correlate with the relative expression of the two alleles. Two hypotheses concerning the influence of the telomere position on the expression of the gene are discussed.
