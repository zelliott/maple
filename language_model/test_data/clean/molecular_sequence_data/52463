To evaluate whether the expression of T-cell receptor (TCR) V beta families in eight cases of malignant T-cell lymphomas took place in a preferential manner, we analyzed four cases of mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common form of primary cutaneous T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), and four cases of primary nodal T-cell NHL. The usage of V beta families in T-cell populations was investigated on mRNA that was transcribed to cDNA using a C beta primer and reverse transcriptase. Subsequently, the specific usage of the families was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using combinations of the selected C beta-oligonucleotide primer and one of the family-specific V beta primers. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from four healthy volunteers and 1 "reactive" lymph node served as a control and expressed all 20 V beta families tested for. In T-cell lines, with restricted V beta expression, and in three patients with advanced MF, only one or two V beta families were expressed at the mRNA level. In an early MF lesion this monoclonal expression was absent: several V beta families were expressed with a weak intensity. This may indicate either a polyclonal origin of MF, or that too few monoclonal neoplastic cells were present in the tissue specimen. In the four nodal T-cell NHL, only one family could be clearly distinguished, whereas some of the other V beta families showed only a weak expression. These latter families represent the reactive T-cell component in the nodal T-cell NHL. Both in nodal T-cell NHL and in MF there was no preferential expression of a particular V beta family. There was a good correlation between PCR data and the expression of V beta-family protein products observed by immunohistochemistry on tissue sections of the T-cell lymphomas. All T-cell lines, three cases of MF, and three cases of nodal T-cell NHL showed a rearrangement of the TCR beta chain on DNA level.
