The leukocyte integrins play a critical role in a great number of cellular adhesive interactions during the immune response. We describe here the isolation and characterization of the caprine beta(2) (CD18) sub-unit, common to the leukocyte beta(2)-integrin family. The deduced 770-amino-acid sequence reveals a transmembrane protein with 80, 81, 83, 96 and 99% identity with its canine, murine, human, bovine and ovine homologues respectively. Analysis of CD18 sequences emphasizes the functional importance of the beta(2) sub-unit I-like domain, and included metal ion-dependent adhesion site-like motif and confirms that of the cytoplasmic tail. Moreover, comparisons of ruminant versus non-ruminant CD18 sequences allowed the identification of 16 potential mutation sites that could be held responsible for the unique virulence of Mannheimia haemolytica for ruminants. Mannheimiosis is known to be the major respiratory disease among ruminants, whereas it is not pathogenic for other mammals, an observation that has been attributed to a specific interaction between M. haemolytica leukotoxin and ruminants' CD18. Therefore, the data provided here offer the possibility to explore new avenues in studies based on the caprine model and provide key information for future studies aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the ruminant-specific virulence of M. haemolytica.
