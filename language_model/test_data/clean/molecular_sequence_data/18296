The syntheses of certain analogues of the DNA minor groove binding agent Hoechst 33258 designed to exhibit altered sequence recognition are described. The structural modifications include the following: substitution of pyridine for the benzene ring of the benzimidazole moiety, replacement of one benzimidazole unit by a benzoxazole in the two possible orientations with respect to the DNA receptor, and a synthesis of 2,2'-m-phenylene-bis[6-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)benzimidazole]. Sequence recognition of these agents on a HindIII/EcoRI fragment of pBR322 DNA was determined by MPE footprinting procedures. Some of the analogues exhibited altered DNA sequence preference compared with Hoechst 33258. In particular, a structure bearing a benzoxazole moiety with the oxygen oriented inward to the minor groove together with an inward-directed pyridine nitrogen appears to confer the property of recognition of a GC base pair within the binding sequence. The possible factors, structural, stereochemical, and electrostatic, contributing to the altered DNA sequence recognition properties are discussed.
