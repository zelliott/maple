All eukaryotic mRNAs possess a 5'-cap (m(7)GpppN) that is recognized by a family of cap-binding proteins. These participate in various processes, such as RNA transport and stabilization, as well as in assembly of the translation initiation complex. The 5'-cap of trypanosomatids is complex; in addition to 7-methyl guanosine, it includes unique modifications on the first four transcribed nucleotides, and is thus denoted cap-4. Here we analyze a cap-binding protein of Leishmania, in an attempt to understand the structural features that promote its binding to this unusual cap. LeishIF4E-1, a homolog of eIF4E, contains the conserved cap-binding pocket, similar to its mouse counterpart. The mouse eIF4E has a higher K(as) for all cap analogs tested, as compared with LeishIF4E-1. However, whereas the mouse eIF4E shows a fivefold higher affinity for m(7)GTP than for a chemically synthesized cap-4 structure, LeishIF4E-1 shows similar affinities for both ligands. A sequence alignment shows that LeishIF4E-1 lacks the region that parallels the C terminus in the murine eIF4E. Truncation of this region in the mouse protein reduces the difference that is observed between its binding to m(7)GTP and cap-4, prior to this deletion. We hypothesize that variations in the structure of LeishIF4E-1, possibly also the absence of a region that is homologous to the C terminus of the mouse protein, promote its ability to interact with the cap-4 structure. LeishIF4E-1 is distributed in the cytoplasm, but its function is not clear yet, because it cannot substitute the mammalian eIF4E in a rabbit reticulocyte in vitro translation system.
