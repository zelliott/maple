The ability of Moloney murine leukemia virus to accelerate lymphomagenesis in E mu-myc transgenic mice is frequently associated with proviral integration within a locus denoted bmi-1. This locus contains not only the bmi-1 gene implicated as a collaborator with myc in lymphomagenesis but also just upstream an unknown gene denoted bup. The nucleotide sequence reported here for bup cDNA and flanking genomic sequences reveals that this widely expressed gene comprises at least 7 exons and potentially encodes a polypeptide of 195 amino acid residues. Computer searches with this polypeptide sequence revealed no close homolog in the databases, nor any conserved motifs, and it is unrelated to the product of the mel-13 gene, which lies just upstream from the bmi-1 homolog mel-18.
