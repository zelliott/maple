Most mitochondrial mRNAs in trypanosomatid parasites require uridine insertion/deletion RNA editing, a process mediated by guide RNA (gRNA) and catalyzed by multi-protein complexes called editosomes. The six oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB)-fold proteins (KREPA1-A6), are a part of the common core of editosomes. They form a network of interactions among themselves as well as with the insertion and deletion sub-complexes and are essential for the stability of the editosomes. KREPA4 and KREPA6 proteins bind gRNA in vitro and are known to interact directly in yeast two-hybrid analysis. In this study, using several approaches we show a minimal interaction surface of the KREPA4 protein that is required for this interaction. By screening a series of N- and C-terminally truncated KREPA4 fragments, we show that a predicted α-helix of KREPA4 OB-fold is required for its interaction with KREPA6. An antibody against the KREPA4 α-helix or mutations of this region can eliminate association with KREPA6; while a peptide fragment corresponding to the α-helix can independently interact with KREPA6, thereby supporting the identification of KREPA4-KREPA6 interface. We also show that the predicted OB-fold of KREPA4; independent of its interaction with gRNA, is responsible for the stable integration of KREPA4 in the editosomes, and editing complexes co-purified with the tagged OB-fold can catalyze RNA editing. Therefore, we conclude that while KREPA4 interacts with KREPA6 through the α-helix region of its OB-fold, the entire OB-fold is required for its integration in the functional editosome, through additional protein-protein interactions.
