A cholate-inducible, NADH-dependent flavin oxidoreductase from the intestinal bacterium Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708 was purified 372-fold to apparent electrophoretic homogeneity. The subunit and native molecular weights were estimated to be 72,000 and 210,000, respectively, suggesting a homotrimeric organization. Three peaks of NADH:flavin oxidoreductase activity (forms I, II, and III) eluted from a DEAE-high-performance liquid chromatography column. Absorption spectra revealed that purified form III, but not form I, contained bound flavin, which dissociated during purification to generate form I. Enzyme activity was inhibited by sulfhydryl-reactive compounds, acriflavine, o-phenanthroline, and EDTA. Activity assays and Western blot (immunoblot) analysis confirmed that expression of the enzyme was cholate inducible. The first 25 N-terminal amino acid residues of purified NADH:flavin oxidoreductase were determined, and a corresponding oligonucleotide probe was synthesized for use in cloning of the associated gene, baiH. Restriction mapping, sequence data, and RNA blot analysis suggested that the baiH gene was located on a previously described, cholate-inducible operon > or = 10 kb long. The baiH gene encoded a 72,006-Da polypeptide containing 661 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of the baiH gene was homologous to that of NADH oxidase from Thermoanaerobium brockii, trimethylamine dehydrogenase from methylotrophic bacterium W3A1, Old Yellow Enzyme from Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, and the product of the baiC gene of Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708, located upstream from the baiH gene in the cholate-inducible operon. Alignment of these five sequences revealed potential ligands for an iron-sulfur cluster, a putative flavin adenine dinucleotide-binding domain, and two other well-conserved domains of unknown function.
