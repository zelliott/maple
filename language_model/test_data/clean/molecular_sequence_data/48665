Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has proven to be highly genetically variable; however, comprehensive information regarding the virus's genetic diversity in South China is limited. In this study, a total of 3199 clinical samples were collected from 267 pig farms suspected of PRRSV infection between 2007 and 2011. The ORF5 genes of 51 PRRSV-positive samples were sequenced and analyzed. The 51 study strains were divided into three primary subgenotypes. Fourty-five of the strains belonged to subgenotype I and were closely related to the highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) strains. The subgenotype I strains were generally clustered into genetically similar groups by year. Only one of the strains belonged to subgenotype II, clustering with the classical North American type, VR2332. Five of the strains were grouped into subgenotype III, which occupied a separate branch and was closely related to the recently isolated novel field strains, QYYZ and GM2. The 5 subgenotype III strains shared an amino acid identity with the remaining 46 study strains ranging from 79.6%-83.6%. Amino acid analysis showed extensive mutations in subgenotype III; the diverse genetic mutations of these novel strains are of great concern.
