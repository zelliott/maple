Metallothioneins (MTs) are typically low molecular weight (6-7 kDa), metal-binding proteins with characteristic repeating cysteine motifs (Cys-X-Cys or Cys-Xn-Cys) and a prolate ellipsoid shape containing single alpha- and beta-domains. While functionally diverse, they play important roles in metals homeostasis, detoxification and the stress response. The present study, combined with previous observations (e.g., Jenny et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 2005; 271:1702-1712) defines an unprecedented diversity of MT primary structure and domain organization in the American oyster, Crassostrea virginica. Two novel molluscan MT families are described. One of these (CvMT-III) is characterized by the presence of two beta-domains and the absence of alpha-domains. This family exhibits constitutive expression during larval development and is the dominant CvMT isoform expressed in larvae. CvMT-III displays low basal levels of expression in adult tissues and only moderate responsiveness to metal challenges in both larvae and adults. A second novel MT isoform (CvMT-IV) was isolated from hemocytes by subtractive hybridization techniques following a 4-hour immune challenge with heat-killed bacteria (Vibrio, Bacillus, Micrococcus spp. mixture). Based on conservation of the cysteine motifs, this isoform appears to be a sub-family related to the molluscan alphabeta-domain MTs. A series of amino acid substitutions has resulted in four additional cysteines which give rise to a Cys-Cys motif and three Cys-Cys-Cys motifs. Northern blot analyses demonstrate that CvMT-IV is down-regulated upon sterile wounding and immune challenge, displays moderate expression in larvae and adults and differential gene induction in response to metals exposure.
