Cockayne's syndrome (CS) is a disease characterized by developmental and growth defects, sunlight sensitivity, and a defect in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. The two principle proteins involved in CS, CSA and CSB/ERCC6, have been hypothesized to bind RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and link transcription to DNA repair. We have tested CSA and CSB in assays designed to determine their role in transcription-coupled repair. Using a unique oligo(dC)-tailed DNA template, we provide biochemical evidence that CSB/ERCC6 interacts with Pol II molecules engaged in ternary complexes containing DNA and nascent RNA. CSB is a DNA-activated ATPase, and hydrolysis of the ATP beta-gamma phosphoanhydride bond is required for the formation of a stable Pol II-CSB-DNA-RNA complex. Unlike CSB, CSA does not directly bind Pol II.
