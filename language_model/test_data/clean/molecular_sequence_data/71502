Previous studies have indicated that the Acn9 protein is involved in gluconeogenesis. Yeast mutants defective in the ACN9 gene display phenotypes identical with mutants defective in metabolic enzymes required for carbon assimilation. These phenotypes include the inability to utilize acetate as a carbon and energy source, elevated levels of enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, gluconeogenesis and acetyl-CoA mobilization, and a deficiency in de novo synthesis of glucose from ethanol. The ACN9 gene was isolated by functional complementation of the acetate growth defect of an acn9 mutant. The open reading frame corresponds to YDR511w, and encodes a protein of unknown function. Homologs have been identified in human, mouse, and nematode databases. Two mutant alleles were sequenced. The mutations altered amino acid residues that are conserved among members of the new gene family. ACN9 gene expression was slightly repressed by glucose, and the level of the transcript was approximately 100-fold lower than that of glyoxylate or tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes. A functional epitope-tagged form of Acn9 was expressed to study expression and the subcellular localization of the protein. The tagged protein was localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space.
