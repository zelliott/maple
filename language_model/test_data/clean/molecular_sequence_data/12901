Several myeloid antimicrobial peptide precursors have been shown to consist of a N-terminal proregion similar to a protein named cathelin and a structurally varied C-terminal antimicrobial domain. Proteins with these features have been named cathelicidins. In this paper we report the cDNA sequences of three ovine cathelicidins of 155, 160 and 190 residues, respectively, with cationic C-terminal sequences corresponding to putative antimicrobial domains. These are structurally varied and include a Cys-rich sequence of 12 residues, which is similar to the bovine antimicrobial cyclic dodecapeptide, a novel 29 residue sequence named SMAP-29 with a possible alpha-helical conformation, and a 60 residue sequence named Bac7.5, which appears to be a new member of the Pro- and Arg-rich group of mammalian antimicrobial peptides.
