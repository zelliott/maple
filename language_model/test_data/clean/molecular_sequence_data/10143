Overlapping DNA fragments spanning approximately 21 kb of genomic DNA and encompassing the human 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase gene (HPD) have been cloned by screening a human leukocyte genomic library and by PCR amplification of human fibroblastic DNA. A continuous gene sequence of 20,890 nucleotides was established, including 1957 bp of the 5'-flanking region. The 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase gene is composed of 14 exons interrupted by 13 introns, all exhibiting conventional vertebrate splicing. Computer analysis of the DNA sequence revealed 12 complete repetitive Alu elements, 1 in the 5'-flanking region and 11 in the intervening segments of the gene. The transcriptional initiation site was mapped to a position 35 nt upstream of the translational start point. The computer analysis also identified several potential transcription regulatory elements, including one CRE site, two AP-2 sites, and two Sp1 sites, in the sequence upstream of the transcription initiation site. Functional analysis of promoter activity by transient transfection of chloramphenicolacetyl transferase reporter plasmids revealed a possible involvement of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the regulation of transcription. The highest level of expression of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase was found in human liver tissue as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis.
