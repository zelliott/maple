We have used the polymerase chain reaction technique to clone the small multiply spliced mRNA species produced after infection of human cells by a molecular clone of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). We identified six Rev-expressing mRNAs, which were generated by the use of two splice acceptors located immediately upstream of the rev AUG. The class of small mRNAs included 12 mRNAs expressing Tat, Rev, and Nef. In addition, HIV-1 produced other multiply spliced mRNAs that used alternative splice sites identified by cloning and sequencing. All of these mRNAs were found in the cytoplasm and should be able to produce additional proteins. The coding capacity of the tat, rev, and nef mRNAs was analyzed by transfection of the cloned cDNAs into human cells. The tat mRNAs produced high levels of Tat, but very low levels of Rev and Nef. All the rev mRNAs expressed high levels of both Rev and Nef and were essential for the production of sufficient amounts of Rev. Therefore, HIV-1 uses both alternatively spliced and bicistronic mRNAs for the production of Tat, Rev, and Nef proteins.
