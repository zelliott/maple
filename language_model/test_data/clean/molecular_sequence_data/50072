We characterize one transcription factor of DRE-binding proteins (TaDREB1) that was isolated from a drought-induced cDNA library of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). TaDREB1 contains one conserved EREBP/AP2 domain, and shows similarity with Arabidopsis thaliana DREB family members in both overall amino-acid sequences and the secondary structure arrangement within the DNA-binding motifs. In yeast one-hybrid system, TaDREB1, can specially activate the genes fused with the promoter containing three tandemly repeated copies of the wild-type DRE sequence: TACCGACAT. In different wheat cultivars, the Ta DREB1 gene is induced by low temperature, salinity and drought; and the expression of Wcs120 that contains DRE motifs in its promoter is closely related to the expression of TaDREB1. These results suggest that TaDREB1 functions as a DRE-binding transcription factor in wheat. We also observed the dwarf phenotype in transgenic rice (T0) overexpressing TaDREB1.
