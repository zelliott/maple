Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy has been used to determine the structure of the Zn(II) sites in UDP-(3-O-acyl)-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (LpxC) from Aquifex aeolicus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The active site Zn(II) is four coordinate, with exclusively low-Z (nitrogen and oxygen) ligation in both enzymes. The amplitude of the outer-shell scattering from the histidine ligands is best fit using two histidine ligands, suggesting a ZnO(2)(His)(2) site, where O most likely represents a conserved aspartate and a solvent molecule. The same structure was found for Co(II)-substituted A. aeolicus LpxC, although in this case it is possible that the coordination sphere may expand to include a fifth low-Z ligand. EXAFS data were also measured for the Escherichia coli LpxC enzyme. When a single Co(II) is substituted for Zn(II) in the active site of E. coli LpxC, EXAFS data show the same ligand environment as is found for the P. aeruginosa and A. aeolicus enzymes. However, the EXAFS data for E. coli LpxC with two zinc ions bound per protein, with the second Zn(II) acting as an inhibitory metal, demonstrates that the inhibitory metal is bound to at least two high-Z (sulfur, presumably thiolate, or chlorine) ligands. Results of the outer-shell scattering analysis, combined with previous studies of the LpxC enzyme, indicate a novel zinc binding motif not found in any previously studied zinc metalloproteins.
