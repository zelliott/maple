Mutations in the SEC63 gene are associated with defects in protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as well as in nuclear protein localization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To identify proteins that might interact and/or function with SEC63p, we cloned a high copy suppressor (HSS1) of the temperature-sensitive lethal phenotype of the sec63-101 mutant. HSS1 is an allele-specific sec63 suppressor that encodes an integral ER membrane glycoprotein of 206 amino acids with the N-terminus in the ER lumen and C-terminal region in the cytoplasm. Haploid strains disrupted for HSS1 are temperature-sensitive for growth and accumulate precursor forms of Kar2p and invertase. The HSS1 null allele is synthetically lethal in combination with mutations affecting ER translocation. We propose that HSS1p is important for ER translocation and interacts with previously identified components of the yeast translocation apparatus. HSS1 is identical to SEC66, which encodes a glycoprotein complexed with SEC62p and SEC63p.
