Two beta-galactoside-binding proteins were found to be prominently expressed in the human colon adenocarcinoma T84 cell line. Cloning and sequencing of one, a 36-kDa protein, identified it as the human homolog of galectin-4, a protein containing two carbohydrate binding domains and previously found only in the epithelial cells of the rat and porcine alimentary tract. The other, a 29-kDa protein, is galectin-3, containing a single carbohydrate binding domain, previously found in a number of different cell types including human intestinal epithelium. Despite the marked similarities in the carbohydrate binding domains of these two galectins, their cellular distribution patterns are strikingly different and vary with cellular conditions. In confluent T84 cells, galectin-4 is mostly cytosolic and concentrated at the basal membrane, whereas galectin-3 tends to be concentrated in large granular inclusions mostly at the apical membrane. In subconfluent T84 cells, each galectin is distributed to specific domains of lamellipodia, with galectin-4 concentrated in the leading edge and galectin-3 more proximally. Such different localization of galectins-4 and -3 within T84 cells implies different targeting mechanisms, ligands, and functions. The localization of galectin-4 suggests a role in cell adhesion which is also supported by the ability of immobilized recombinant galectin-4 to stimulate adhesion of T84 cells.
