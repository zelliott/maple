Complete amino acid sequences are presented for lysozymes c from camel and goat stomachs and compared to sequences of other lysozymes c. Tree analysis suggests that the rate of amino acid replacement went up as soon as lysozyme was recruited for the stomach function in early ruminants. The two lysozymes from goat stomach are the products of a gene duplication that probably took place before the divergence of cow, goat, and deer about 25 million years ago. Partial sequences of three lysozymes from goat tears indicated that (a) the goat tear family of lysozymes may have diverged from the stomach lysozyme family by an ancient duplication and (b) later duplications are probably responsible for the multiple forms of tear and milk lysozymes in ruminants.
