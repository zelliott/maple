The transmembrane proteins (TMP) of immunodeficiency lentiviruses are primary candidates for inclusion in AIDS vaccines, the design and testing of which is facilitated by the SIV-macaque infection model. Antibody responses to linear determinants in the SIVmac TMP were investigated in rhesus macaques either infected with the SIVmac J5 molecular clone or vaccinated with partially purified, formalin-inactivated SIVmac. Infected animals were shown to recognise predominantly four regions in the external domain and three regions in the internal domain of the TMP defined by a series of nominally 20mer overlapping peptides. In contrast SIV vaccinates had extremely restricted and weak antibody responses to the TMP, indicating a selective loss of immunogenicity of this component in the vaccine.
