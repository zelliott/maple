We have isolated and in silico characterized a cold-induced LlaDREB1b encoding a putative DRE-binding transcription factor from Lepidium latifolium. Its cDNA (JN214345) sequence (998 bp) consisted of a 642 bp ORF, 168 and 188 bp of 5' and 3' UTR regions, respectively, encoding a protein of 213 aa with deduced molecular mass 23.85 kDa and pI of 4.63. In silico and phylogenetic analysis further suggested that the protein showed features of a typical member of the AP2/EREBP family of DNA-binding proteins. Southern blot analysis indicated that multiple copies of the gene could be present in the genome. Its transcripts were abundant in leaves, petiole and stem, but scarce in roots and could strongly be induced by cold treatment (4 Â°C), weakly by drought and salt stress, and did not respond to ABA treatment. Thus, LlaDREB1b is a potential candidate for abiotic stress-tolerance engineering in crop plants upon its further functional validation.
