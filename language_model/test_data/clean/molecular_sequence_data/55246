Recent studies indicate that human papillomaviruses (HPVs) from the genera Betapapillomavirus and Gammapapillomavirus are abundant in the human oral cavity. We report the cloning and characterization of a 7304 bp HPV120 genome from the oral cavity that is related most closely to HPV23 (L1 ORF, 83.7 % similarity), clustering it in the genus Betapapillomavirus (β-PV). HPV120 contains five early and two late genes, but no E5 ORF. HPV120 was detected from heterogeneous human biological niches, including the oral cavity, eyebrow hairs, anal canal and penile, vulvar and perianal warts. Characterization of the clinical spectrum of HPV120 infections indicates a broader spectrum of epithelial tropism than appreciated previously for HPV types from the genus β-PV.
