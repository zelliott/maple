O-acetylation is one of the major modifications of sialic acids that significantly alters biological properties of the parent molecule. These O-acetylated forms are components of the cellular membrane and can affect physiological and pathological responses. Understanding the role of N-glycans in physiology is of increasing relevance to cellular biologists in various disciplines who study glycoproteomics yet lack information regarding the function of the attached glycans. It is well known that stress may decrease immune function in fish; however, there are only few suitable biomarkers available to monitor the physiological responses under the stress conditions. This study is the first report on the effect of stress on the profile of O-acetylation of sialic acids in fish serum. In order to preserve the relevant structural characteristics as much as possible, native N-glycans were directly analyzed using CE-MS. We have characterized the N-glycans in serum of salmon (Salmo salar) exposed to long-term handling stress (15 s out of the water, daily for 4 wk) and compared with the results obtained from sera of control fish. The results indicated that major N-glycans in salmon serum contained mono-acetylated sialic acids (83%), and that the O-acetylation pattern of sialic acids could be altered by long-term stress.
