The woodpecker genus Colaptes (flickers) has its highest diversity in South America and the closely related genus Piculus is restricted to South and Central America. Two species of flickers occur in North America, and one species is endemic to Cuba. We conducted a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of three mitochondrial encoded genes (cyt b, COI, 12S rRNA) and confirmed that the two genera are paraphyletic. Three species historically classified as Piculus are actually flickers. We found that the Cuban endemic C. fernandinae is the most basal species within the flickers and that the Northern Flicker is the next most basal species within the Colaptes lineage. The South American clade is most derived. The age of the South American diversification is estimated to be 3.6MY, which is synchronous with the emergence of the Isthmus of Panama. The pattern of diversification of South American flickers is common among South American woodpeckers. Although woodpeckers have their greatest diversity in South America, we hypothesize that woodpeckers (Family Picidae) originated in Eurasia, dispersed to North America via the Bering land bridge, and multiple lineages entered South America as the Isthmus approached its final closing.
