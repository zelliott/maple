We have recently shown that human submandibular salivary gland and saliva contain a number of glycoproteins belonging to the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family. The members of the CEA family can be divided into the CEA subgroup and the pregnancy specific beta 1 glycoprotein (PSG) subgroup. The latter glycoproteins are abundant in placenta and fetal liver. Here we report that PSG's are expressed in normal adult submandibular salivary gland. Thus, cDNA cloning and sequencing gave two clones (SG5 and SG9) which coded for glycoproteins with a domain arrangement of N-A1-A2-B2-C and a third clone (SG8) which coded for a glycoprotein with a domain arrangement of N-A1-B2-C. SG5 is identical to PSG3, and SG9 to PSG1d, while SG8 most probably corresponds to PSG2. The 3' untranslated regions of the different members of the PSG subgroup contain highly homologous segments, suggesting a common evolutionary origin.
