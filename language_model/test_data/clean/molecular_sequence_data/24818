Mutant catalase cDNAs from the hypocatalasemic and acatalasemic mice were cloned and expressed in bacteria. A novel missense mutation, Asp (AAT) to Ser (AGT), was identified at amino acid position 439 of the hypocatalasemic catalase. Analysis of recombinant catalase mutants revealed that the mutation is responsible for the reduced activity of hypocatalasemic catalase and the unstable tetrameric structure of acatalasemic catalase was also suggested.
