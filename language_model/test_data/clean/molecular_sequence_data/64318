A taxonomic study was performed on three strains isolated from microbial mats in Lake Fryxell, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that these strains belong to the family Flavobacteriaceae, in which they form a distinct lineage. The isolates are Gram-negative, chemoheterotrophic, aerobic, rod-shaped cells. They are psychrophilic and yellow-pigmented, with DNA G+C contents in the range 37.8-38.9 mol%. Whole-cell fatty acid profiles revealed mainly branched fatty acids and 17 : 0 2-OH. On the basis of genotypic, phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic results, it is proposed that the isolates represent a novel species in a new genus, Gillisia limnaea gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain is LMG 21470(T) (=DSM 15749(T)).
