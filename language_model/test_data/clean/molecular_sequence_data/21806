Retinoid X receptor (RXR) belongs to an ancient superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors, and plays an important role in reproduction of vertebrates. However, the reproductive role of RXR has not been clarified in crustaceans. In this investigation, we first report the cloning of two alternative splice variants of RXR cDNA from green crab ovarian RNA. RXR mRNA levels were quantified in different vitellogenic stages of the crab hepatopancreas (HP) and ovary. The expression of RXR mRNA relative to the arginine kinase mRNA was significantly increased in the HP of vitellogenic crabs in a stage-dependent manner. The relative levels of RXR mRNA in the ovary were significantly lower in vitellogenic stage III crabs than in crabs in the other three stages. These data indicate that the HP and ovary of the crab are capable of expressing RXR, which may regulate, in part, vitellogenesis in the crab. We also examined the effects of methyl farnesoate (MF) and RXR-dsRNA treatments on vitellogenin and RXR gene expression. Vitellogenin and RXR mRNA levels in HP and ovarian fragments incubated in MF were significantly (P<0.001) higher than in control tissue fragments prepared from the same animal. Treatment of crabs with RXR-dsRNA significantly (P<0.001) reduced mRNA levels for RXR and for vitellogenin as well as MF levels in hemolymph. These results indicate that, MF and RXR form a complex (MF-RXR) directly and together stimulate ovarian development in these green crabs. This interaction of RXR, MF, and ovary development axis is a novel finding and is the first report to the best of our knowledge.
