A bacterial strain, ISL-4(T), comprising Gram-negative, non-motile, rod-shaped cells, was isolated from a marine solar saltern of the Yellow Sea in Korea and was subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic investigation. Phenotypically, the strain resembled members of the genus Salegentibacter. It grew optimally at pH 7.0-8.0 and 30 degrees C and in the presence of 8 % (w/v) NaCl. It contained MK-6 as the predominant menaquinone. The major fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 0) and anteiso-C(15 : 0). The DNA G+C content was 37.9 mol%. A phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain ISL-4(T) belonged to the genus Salegentibacter, exhibiting sequence similarity values of 95.9-98.6 % with respect to the type strains of recognized Salegentibacter species (with the exception of Salegentibacter catena). Low DNA-DNA relatedness values and differential phenotypic properties, together with its phylogenetic distinctiveness, demonstrated that strain ISL-4(T) represents a novel species of the genus Salegentibacter, for which the name Salegentibacter salinarum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is ISL-4(T) (=KCTC 12975(T) =CCUG 54354(T)).
