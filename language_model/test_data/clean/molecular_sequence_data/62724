The serotonin receptor 1B gene (htr1B) has been suggested to be implicated in mental disorders in both humans and other species. We have isolated a canine bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone containing htr1B, revealed the coding and surrounding DNA sequence of canine htr1B and designed primer sets for genomic sequencing of the gene. A mutation scan in 10 dogs revealed five single nucleotide polymorphisms in the htr1B coding sequence. By random sequencing of subclones of the BAC a polymorphic microsatellite repeat was found. We found evidence for at least four extended haplotypes in six dogs of the same breed. The chromosomal localization of the gene was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation and radiation hybrid mapping. This work provides a starting point for mutation scans and association studies on dogs with behavioural problems.
