Pyoverdins were isolated and characterized respectively from the cultures of Pseudomonas tolaasii NCPPB 2192 (pyoverdins Pt, Pt A, and Pt B) and Pseudomonas fluorescens CCM 2798 (Pyoverdins Pf/1, Pf/2, Pf, Pf/3/1, and Pf/3/2) each grown in iron-deficient conditions. Their structures were established by using FAB-MS, NMR, and CD techniques. These siderophores are chromopeptides, and all but one (pyoverdin Pf/3/3) possess at the N-terminal end of their peptide chain the same chromophore that has been reported in pyoverdin Pa from Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15692 [Wendenbaum, S., Demange, P., Dell, A., Meyer, J. M., & Abdallah, M. A. (1983) Tetrahedron Lett. 24, 4877-4880] and pseudobactin B 10 from Pseudomonas B10 [Teintze, M., Hossain, M. B., Barnes, C. L., Leong, J., & Van der Helm, D. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 6446-6457] which is derived from 2,3-diamino-6,7-dihydroxyquinoline. In pyoverdins Pt this chromophore is bound to a linear peptide chain D-Ser-L-Lys-L-Ser-D-Ser-L-Thr-D-Ser-L-OHOrn-L-Thr-D-Ser-D-OHOrn (cyclic) which has its C-terminal end blocked by cyclic D-N delta-hydroxyornithine. In pyoverdins Pf, the peptide chain is also linear, SerCTHPMD-Gly-L-Ser-D-threo-OHAsp-L-Ala-Gly-D-Ala-Gly-L-O HOrn(cyclic), and contains an unusual natural amino acid which is the result of the condensation of 1 mol of serine and 1 mol of 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, forming a cyclic amidine. The pyoverdins Pt differ only in substituent bound to the nitrogen on C-3 of the chromophore, which is succinic acid in pyoverdin Pt A, succinamide in pyoverdin Pt, and alpha-ketoglutaric acid bound to the chromophore by its C-5 carbon atom in pyoverdin Pt B. Similarly, pyoverdin Pf/1, pyoverdin Pf/2, pyoverdin Pf (the major compound), and pyoverdin Pf/3/2 are substituted respectively by L-malic acid, succinic acid, L-malic amide, and succinamide. Pyoverdin Pf/3/3 has the same chromophore as azotobactin, the peptidic siderophore of Azotobacter vinelandii. These pyoverdins are very similar to pseudobactin B 10, the siderophore of Pseudomonas B10: they are linear peptides containing three bidentate groups strongly chelating Fe(III) and blocked at their N-terminal end by the catecholic chromophore and at their C-terminal end by cyclic N delta-hydroxyornithine. They differ therefore from other pyoverdins such as those from P. aeruginosa ATCC 15692 which contain a partly cyclic peptide [Briskot, G., Taraz, K., & Budzikiewicz, H. (1989) Liebigs Ann. Chem., 375-384].
