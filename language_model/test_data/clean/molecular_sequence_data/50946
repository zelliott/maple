Mannose-containing polysaccharides of 18 lichen species were prepared via successive alkaline extraction, precipitation with Fehling solution and fractional precipitation with Cetavlon. Products from Fehling and Cetavlon precipitation, the latter at pH 8.5 in the presence of borax, were structurally similar, except with those of Usnea sp., U. meridionalis, Parmotrema araucaria and Evernia prunastri, which were mixtures and initially provided precipitates at pH 7 due to the presence of carboxyl groups. With one exception, glucosyl units were detected in all preparations, but possibly arose from glucan contaminants of the galactomannans. Tornabenia intricata, however, did not contain galactose, and a glucomannan was isolated. It consisted of two components with M(r)s of ca 0.85 x 10(5) and ca 1.1 x 10(5) and whose 13C NMR spectra were identical. The overall preparation contained a (1-->6)-linked alpha-D-Manp main-chain substituted at 0-2 mainly with side chains of alpha-D-Manp with smaller amounts of alpha-D-Glcp, alpha-D-Glcp-(1-->2)-[alpha-D-Manp-(1-->4)]-alpha-D-Manp, and possibly alpha-D-Manp-(1-->2)-[alpha-D-Manp-(1-->4)]-alpha-D-Manp+ ++.
