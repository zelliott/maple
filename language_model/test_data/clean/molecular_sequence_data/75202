Many mAb that bind the carbohydrate antigenic determinant 3-fucosyl-lactosamine (3-FL), Gal beta 1-4[Fuc alpha-3]GlcNAc-R have been raised in BALB/c mice, and we are studying the structure and regulation of these antibodies. In this report, we present the first information about their amino acid sequences and the Ig gene segments used to encode them. V regions of the H and L chains of three anti-3-FL antibodies, PMN6, PMN29, and PM81, were sequenced by a combination of mRNA and amino acid sequencing. The L chain sequences of PMN6 and PM81 antibodies indicate that their VK and JK regions are encoded by VK24B and JK1 germ-line genes, respectively. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the H chains suggest that the three anti-3-FL antibodies are encoded by the VH441 gene segment of the X24 VH family, and this conclusion was supported by Southern filter hybridization with VH441 and JH3-JH4 probes. PMN29 has at least 11 amino acid substitutions, which is an unusually large amount of somatic mutation for an IgM antibody. Previous analyses of BALB/c genomic libraries with VHX24 and VH441 probes make it unlikely that this VH family contains additional germ-line genes, but this possibility cannot be excluded. All three antibodies use the DQ52 and JH4 gene segments. The single VH and VL gene segments used to encode the anti-3-FL antibodies is in contrast to the multiple VH and VL segments used by antibodies against other carbohydrate Ag such as alpha 1-6 dextran and group A streptococcal carbohydrate. VH441 also encodes the VH regions of antibodies against galactan and levan (beta 2-6 fructosan). The similarities among VH segments of antibodies against 3-FL, levan, and galactan, and the striking differences in their CDR3 sequences, suggest that CDR3 plays an important role in the formation of the Ag binding site. The use of a single VH segment from the smallest VH gene family by antibodies against at least three different carbohydrate determinants is noteworthy. It raises the possibility that the amino acid sequence encoded by VH441 has some general structural features that make it particularly well adapted for binding to carbohydrate sequences.
