The recently identified NB-1 mRNA is transcribed from a single intronless gene, previously thought to be an unexpressed calmodulin pseudogene. Although expression levels of the three known human calmodulin genes fluctuate only slightly in all cell types and tissues examined, NB-1 expression is limited to certain cells of pseudostratified and stratified epithelial tissues. Like calmodulin, the protein encoded by NB-1 is heat stable and binds to phenyl-Sepharose in a calcium-dependent manner. Despite the shared identity of 85% of their 148 amino acids, however, calmodulin and NB-1 protein are easily distinguished electrophoretically and immunologically. Polyclonal antibodies prepared against recombinant NB-1 protein recognize a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 16,000 which is abundant in cultured normal human mammary epithelial cells, but which is absent or barely detectable in fibroblasts or tumor cell lines. The immunohistochemical distribution of NB-1 protein in histologically normal tissues suggests that expression of the gene is regulated during epithelial differentiation. The majority of a small number of malignant tissues examined had lowered or undetectable NB-1 protein expression relative to normal tissues. Given its restricted distribution, the NB-1 protein may be involved in the initiation or maintenance of certain differentiated functions. Its absence may be due to or necessary for the manifestation of the transformed phenotype in certain cell types.
