Identification of the putative prothymosin alpha homolog in Escherichia coli cells prompted the search for a prothymosin alpha-coding gene in the E. coli genome. A set of interspersed DNA segments was identified, which match various parts of the human prothymosin alpha molecule. Their location in the E. coli genome and high degree of similarity with the appropriate regions of the human prothymosin alpha gene suggest that some kind of trans-splicing should exist in E. coli, which could be responsible for bringing these putative bacterial prothymosin alpha-coding exons together.
