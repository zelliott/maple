One of the major obstacles in the design of an effective vaccine against HIV-1 is its antigenic variation, which results in viral escape from the immune system. Through a bioinformatics approach, we developed an innovative multivalent HIV-1 vaccine comprised of a pool of 176 lipidated and nonlipidated peptides representing variable regions of Env and Gag proteins. The potency and breadth of the candidate vaccine against a panel of HIV-1 subtypes was evaluated in nonhuman primate (cynomolgus macaques) and humanized mouse (HLA-A2.1) models. The results demonstrate strong immunogenicity with both breadth (humoral and cellular immunity) and depth (immune recognition of widely divergent viral sequences) against heterologous HIV-1 subtypes A-F.
