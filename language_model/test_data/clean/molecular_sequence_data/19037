A novel actinomycete, designated strain NEAU-GRX11(T), was isolated from muddy soil collected from a stream of Jinlong Mountain in Harbin, north China. The organism was found to have morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics typical of the genus Micromonospora. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain NEAU-GRX11(T) showed highest similarity to Micromonospora zamorensis CR38(T) (99.2 %), Micromonospora saelicesensis Lupac 09(T) (99.0 %), Micromonospora chokoriensis 2-19/6(T) (98.7 %), Micromonospora coxensis 2-30-b/28(T) (98.5 %), Micromonospora aurantiaca ATCC 27029(T) (98.4 %) and Micromonospora lupini lupac 14N(T) (98.3 %). Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene and gyrB gene demonstrated that strain NEAU-GRX11(T) was a member of the genus Micromonospora and supported the closest phylogenetic relationship to M. zamorensis CR38(T), M. saelicesensis Lupac 09(T), M. chokoriensis 2-19/6(T) and M. lupini lupac 14N(T). A combination of DNA-DNA hybridization and some phenotypic characteristics indicated that the novel strain could be readily distinguished from these closest phylogenetic relatives. Therefore, it is proposed that NEAU-GRX11(T) represents a novel species of the genus Micromonospora, for which the name Micromonospora jinlongensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NEAU-GRX11(T) (=CGMCC 4.7103(T)=DSM 45876(T)).
