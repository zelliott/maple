Efficient encapsulation of foreign molecules like proteins and low molecular weight drugs into polyoma virus-like particles (capsoids) was achieved by the development of an anchoring technique based upon the specific interaction of the inner core protein VP2 with VP1 pentamers. A stretch of 49 amino acids of VP2 served as an anchor molecule, either expressed as a fusion protein with green fluorescent protein (GFP) or covalently linked to methotrexate (MTX). The loaded capsoids showed regular morphology and stability for several months. GFP and MTX were internalized into cells in vitro, as was demonstrated by the detection of GFP and VP1 fluorescence in mouse fibroblasts and the cytostatic effect of intracellularly released MTX on leukemia T cells.
