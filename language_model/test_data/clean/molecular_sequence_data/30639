In order to identify and characterize sequences within Ty1 elements which are required in cis for transposition, a series of mini-Ty1 plasmids were constructed and tested for transposition. Mini-Ty1s are deletion mutants of the Ty1-H3 element; Ty1 gene products required for transposition are supplied in trans from a helper Ty1 which has intact open reading frames but lacks a 3' long terminal repeat (LTR) and therefore cannot transpose itself. Up to 5 kilobase pairs of internal sequences of the 6-kilobase-pair-long Ty1 element can be deleted without a significant effect on transposition. The smallest mini-Ty1 element capable of transposition contains the 3' LTR and the transcribed portion of the 5' LTR, 285 base pairs (bp) of internal sequence 3' to the 5' LTR, and 23 bp of internal sequence 5' to the 3' LTR. We conclude that Ty1-encoded proteins can act in trans and that cis-acting sequences in Ty1-H3 are all within or near the LTRs. Further deletion of the 285-bp internal sequence adjacent to the 5' LTR significantly reduced transposition frequency, and the mini-Ty1 RNA produced failed to be packaged into the viruslike particles efficiently. Surprisingly, several nonhomologous cellular mRNAs were also associated with viruslike particles.
