Xylanase is used extensively to improve feed conversion rates to enhance the performance of poultry and pigs. By expressing xylanase in simple-stomached animals, new breeds of genetically modified animals with enhanced feed conversion rates may be obtained. However, expression of heterologous proteins derived from lower organisms in mammalian cells is usually inefficient. When common codons of a ''one amino acid-one codon"-optimized xylanase from Streptomyces olivaceoviridis were replaced with rare codons, xylanase expression in human embryonic kidney 293A cells increased by 1.4- to 2.3-fold as determined by flow cytometry, western blot and enzymatic activity assay. Quantitative RT-PCR assay indicated that the enhanced expression could not be attributed to altered mRNA levels. This study provides an alternative strategy for improving expression levels of heterologous proteins in mammalian cells, which is potentially helpful for generating genetically modified animals with enhanced feed conversion ability.
