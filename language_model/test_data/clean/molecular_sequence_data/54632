Fascioliasis has a negative impact on the farming industry in both developed and developing countries, rather than a public health challenge. This study was performed to identify Fasciola sp. from different definitive hosts (buffalo, cattle, and sheep) based on the molecular parameters and spermatogenesis. Ninety-one adult flukes were collected from livers of slaughtered animals at abattoirs in different prefectures in Egypt. Microscopic examination of the analyzed flukes showed many normal spermatozoa in the seminal vesicles (spermic), suggesting that they have the ability of spermatogenesis. This study showed that no parthenogenic Fasciola species occurred in Egypt. Molecular analysis was performed utilizing genomic (ITS1 and ITS2) and mitochondrial (NDI and COI) gene markers. Whereas 16 animals proved to have infection with a single Fasciola species, 2 were infected with both F. hepatica and F. gigantica. The results indicated that sheep were prone to F. hepatica (8 out of 10 animals) more than F. gigantica infection. Sequences of ITS1 and ITS2 ribosomal region indicated that the flukes were categorized into 3 groups F. hepatica-type (47), F. gigantica-type (42) and 2 flukes possessed sequences of both types indicating an existence of different alleles at the same loci. Unique overlapping of T/C bases were detected in both ITS1 (Position 96) and ITS2 (Position 416). Based on results of mitochondrial gene markers (NDI and COI), flukes were classified into F. hepatica-type and F. gigantica-type. Extensive intra-sequence polymorphism was detected at both markers. NDI and COI sequences of Egyptian strain of F. gigantica showed pronounced diversity compared with relevant sequences at database.
