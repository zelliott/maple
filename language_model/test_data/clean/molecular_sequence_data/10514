The heat shock response of a fish which inhabits a highly stressful environment (Poeciliopsis lucida, a minnow from river systems of the Sonoran desert in northwestern Mexico) was investigated. Cells derived from this fish exhibited a typical heat shock response when exposed to elevated temperature, synthesizing high levels of 90 kDa, 70 kDa, and 30 kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hsp30), as well as lower amounts of other heat shock proteins. Additional small heat shock proteins (sHSPs), including Hsp27, were induced after a prolonged heat shock at a time when synthesis of Hsp70 and Hsp30 was decreasing. Characterization of cDNA clones for hsp27 and hsp30 revealed that both are members of the alpha-crystallin/sHSP superfamily but belong to separate lineages within this gene family. The multiple isoforms of P. lucida Hsp30 appear to be members of a multigene family and are most closely related to salmon and Xenopus Hsp30s. In contrast, Hsp27 is highly similar to mammalian and avian sHSPs; it was synthesized as three isoforms which represented differentially phosphorylated forms of a single polypeptide. In Poeciliopsis, the various sHSPs may each perform a subset of the roles attributed to mammalian sHSPs. The conservation of phosphorylation sites in Hsp27 may indicate an involvement in signal transduction to the actin cytoskeleton. The hsp30 genes appear to have diverged more rapidly than the corresponding hsp27 genes; the various members of the Hsp30 family may function as molecular chaperones and, in this role, may be less evolutionarily constrained. Finally, the presence of these two classes of sHSP in a single taxon indicates that these two lineages arose by gene duplication early in the evolution of vertebrates and raises questions about the fate of homologs of Hsp30 in mammals and of Hsp27 in Xenopus.
