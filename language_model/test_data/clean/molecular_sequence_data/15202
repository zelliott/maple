Recently, ether-linked diastereomeric 2,4-dihydroxypentanoic acids have been reported as new components of bacterial glycans [Shashkov, A. S. et al.Nat. Prod. Commun.2008, 3, 1625-1630]. In this work, an ether of (2R,4R)-2,4-dihydroxypentanoic acid (Dhpa) with d-mannose was identified in the O-polysaccharide of Providencia alcalifaciens O31, and the polysaccharide structure was elucidated. Studies by NMR spectroscopy confirmed the ether linkage between O-2 of Dhpa and O-4 of Man, and the absolute configuration of Man was determined after ether cleavage with boron trichloride. In the polysaccharide, Dhpa was found to exist partially in the form of 1,4-lactone. Using sugar and methylation analyses along with (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy, including 2D (1)H,(1)H COSY, TOCSY, ROESY, H-detected (1)H,(13)C HSQC, and gHMBC experiments, the following structure of the tetrasaccharide repeating unit of the polysaccharide was established: [carbohydrate structure: see text]
