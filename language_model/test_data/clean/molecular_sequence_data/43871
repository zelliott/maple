Sentrin is a novel ubiquitin-like protein that protects cells against both anti-Fas and tumor necrosis factor-induced cell death. Antiserum recognizing the N terminus of sentrin revealed the presence of a 18-kDa sentrin monomer, a 90-kDa band (p90), and multiple high molecular mass bands. Because sentrin possesses the conserved Gly-Gly residues near the C terminus, it is likely that these additional bands represent conjugation of sentrin to other proteins in a manner that is similar to the ubiquitination pathway. Transient expression of hemagglutinin epitope-tagged sentrin mutants in COS cells demonstrated that the sentrin C terminus is cleaved, which allows it to be conjugated to other proteins via the conserved C-terminal Gly residue. Immunocytochemical staining and cell fractionation analysis demonstrated that sentrin monomer is localized predominantly to the cytosol. However, p90 and the majority of sentrinized proteins appeared to be localized to the nucleus. When the conserved Gly-Gly residues of sentrin were changed to Gly-Ala, only sentrin monomer and p90 but not the high molecular mass bands were observed. Thus, p90 generation appears to be required for the formation of high molecular mass bands in the nucleus. Taken together, sentrinization represents a novel pathway for nuclear protein modification, which is distinct from ubiquitination.
