A neuropeptide, Cam-HrTH-I, has been isolated from the corpus cardiacum of the Indian stick insect Carausius morosus. The peptide causes hyperlipaemia in Locusta migratoria and hypertrehalosaemia in Periplaneta americana and is related to the previously isolated Cam-HrTH-II (pGlu-Leu-Thr-Phe-Thr-Pro-Asn-Trp-Gly-Thr-NH2) by substitution, apparently by a hexose, on the Trp residue. This appears to be the first example of such substitution on a Trp residue.
