We have cloned the platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein (GP) VI from a human bone marrow cDNA library using rapid amplification of cDNA ends with platelet mRNA to complete the 5' end sequence. GPVI was isolated from platelets using affinity chromatography on the snake C-type lectin, convulxin, as a critical step. Internal peptide sequences were obtained, and degenerate primers were designed to amplify a fragment of the GPVI cDNA, which was then used as a probe to screen the library. Purified GPVI, as well as Fab fragments of polyclonal antibodies made against the receptor, inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation. The GPVI receptor cDNA has an open reading frame of 1017 base pairs coding for a protein of 339 amino acids including a putative 23-amino acid signal sequence and a 19-amino acid transmembrane domain between residues 247 and 265. GPVI belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily, and its sequence is closely related to FcalphaR and to the natural killer receptors. Its extracellular chain has two Ig-C2-like domains formed by disulfide bridges. An arginine residue is found in position 3 of the transmembrane portion, which should permit association with Fcgamma and its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif via a salt bridge. With 51 amino acids, the cytoplasmic tail is relatively long and shows little homology to the C-terminal part of the other family members. The ability of the cloned GPVI cDNA to code for a functional platelet collagen receptor was demonstrated in the megakaryocytic cell line Dami. Dami cells transfected with GPVI cDNA mobilized intracellular Ca(2+) in response to collagen, unlike the nontransfected or mock transfected Dami cells, which do not respond to collagen.
