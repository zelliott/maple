To correlate genotype with response to early copper histidine therapy in Menkes disease, an X-linked disorder of copper transport, we performed mutational analysis in 2 related males who began treatment at the age of 10 days and prenatally at 32 weeks' gestation, respectively. A G to T transversion at the -1 exonic position of a splice donor site was identified, predicting a glutamine to histidine substitution at codon 724 of the Menkes copper-transporting ATPase gene. The Q724H mutation disrupts proper splicing and generates five mutant transcripts that skip from one to four exons. None of these transcripts is predicted to encode a functional copper transport protein. Copper histidine treatment normalized circulating copper and ceruloplasmin levels but did not improve the baseline deficiency of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, a copper-dependent enzyme. At the age of 36 months, the first patient was living and had neurodevelopmental abilities ranging from 10 to 15 months. The second patient also showed delayed neurodevelopment and died of pulmonary complications at the age of 5 1/2 months. We conclude that early copper histidine therapy does not normalize neurological outcome in patients with the Q724H splicing mutation, and suggest that preservation of some residual Menkes ATPase activity may be a general prerequisite for significant clinical efficacy from such treatment.
