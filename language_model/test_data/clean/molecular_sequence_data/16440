UDP-Gal:GA2/GM2/GD2/GT2 galactosyltransferase (Gal-T2) transfers galactose to the terminal N-acetylgalactosamine of either the neutral glycolipid GA2 or of the gangliosides GM2, GD2 and GT2. Previous studies revealed a tight regulation of Gal-T2 activity and mRNA expression during development of the rat CNS. Here, we study in PC12 cells the cis-acting elements involved in the activation of a fragment of 211 bp around the transcription initiation site of the mouse Gal-T2 promoter. Mutagenesis, competition experiments and functional assays showed that the Ets-1 transcription factor is involved in the activation of the Gal-T2 promoter.
