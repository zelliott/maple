Hepatocyte nuclear factor-3/forkhead homologue 4 (HFH-4) is a forkhead/winged-helix transcription factor family member that has a unique temporal and spatial pattern of gene expression in the developing and adult lung, choroid plexus, testis, and oviduct. To characterize HFH-4 further, mouse genomic clones were isolated and analyzed. The Hfh4 gene is encoded on a 5.5-kb region located on the distal end of mouse chromosome 11 and consists of two exons and one intron. Unlike most forkhead genes, the DNA binding domain is divided between two exons, and the intron position corresponds precisely to the site of gene translocations involving two known human forkhead homologues. Multiple putative transcription start sites are identified in a G+C-rich sequence that does not contain TATA or CAAT boxes. Within 2.1 kb of 5' flanking sequence are three identical E boxes and multiple putative transcription factor binding sites. Transfection of plasmids containing Hfh4 5' flanking sequence linked to a reporter gene results in promoter activity in lung epithelial cells but not in epithelial-like fibrosarcoma cells, suggesting that this 5' flanking sequence can function as a promoter with the proper cell-type specificity.
