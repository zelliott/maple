The nucleotide sequence of a 1287-base-pair segment of the maize (Zea mays) chloroplast DNA, encoding chloroplast ribosomal proteins L14, S8 and the C-terminal part of L16, has been determined using the dideoxy-chain-termination method. These data from a monocot plant are compared to the corresponding data from a dicot and a lower plant and from two bacteria. The deduced amino acid sequence of maize chloroplast L14 shows 80%, 81%, 51% and 52% and that of S8 shows 75%, 58%, 39% and 38% sequence identity, respectively, to the corresponding sequences of Nicotiana tabacum, Marchantia polymorpha, Bacillus stearothermophilus and Escherichia coli. The starting map coordinates of rpL14 and rpS8 in the physical map of the maize chloroplast DNA [Larrinua, I. M., Muskavitch, K. M. T., Gubbins, E. J. and Bogorad, L. (1983) Plant Mol. Biol. 2, 129-140] are 31.330 and 31.841. The gene order is rpL16-spacer-rpL14-spacer-rpS8. Shine-Dalgarno sequences (GGA and AGGAGG) and computer-derived stem-loop structures of dyad symmetry are present in the spacers and the 3' downstream region of rpS8, respectively, but a chloroplast promoter-like sequence could not be detected suggesting that the latter might be located further upstream in this ribosomal protein gene cluster in maize chloroplast DNA.
