The fibrinogenolytic enzyme hementin, present in extracts of the posterior salivary glands of the giant leech Haementeria ghilianii, was isolated by ultrafiltration, high-performance ion-exchange chromatography and subsequent reversed-phase liquid chromatography. Approximately 100 micrograms (1 nmol) of hementin, present at less than 0.5% in the crude leech salivary extract, was brought to about 90% purity in three steps. Hementin migrated at an Mr of about 73,000 on non-reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and at 82,000 on reducing SDS-PAGE. The amino terminal sequence was determined to be TTLTE-PEPDL. The amino terminal sequences of two inactive proteins that partially coeluted with hementin in the first chromatographic step were also determined.
