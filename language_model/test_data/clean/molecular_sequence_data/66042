Androgen-induced bZIP (AIbZIP/CREB3L4) is a transcription factor of the bZIP family that associates with the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In humans, AIbZIP RNA is most abundant in the prostate gland where the protein is produced in luminal cells of the glandular epithelium. AIbZIP could play an important role in prostate cancer because its expression is up-regulated by androgens in LNCaP prostate cancer cells and the protein is more abundant in cancerous than in non-cancerous prostate cells. We recently added 74 adenocarcinomas and 43 specimens of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) to our survey of AIbZIP expression in prostate tumours. This study showed that AIbZIP is expressed in all grades of adenocarcinoma and that it is more abundant in high-grade PIN and in adenocarcinoma than in normal prostate. The physiological function of AIbZIP remains unknown but its association with the ER and its structural homology to transcription factors such as ATF6 suggest that AIbZIP could be activated by regulated intramembrane proteolysis during the cellular response to ER stress. This review will describe the characteristics of human and mammalian AIbZIP, its relationship to prostate cancer, and our recent efforts to characterize the transcriptional properties and targets of AIbZIP.
