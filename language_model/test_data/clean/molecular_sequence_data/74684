Four forms of chymotrypsin (Chtr1, Chtr2, Chtr3, Chtr4), one form of trypsin and one form of elastase were purified from a slightly alkaline extract of ostrich (Struthio camelus) pancreas. The zymogens in the crude extract were activated with immobilized trypsin and then separated by affinity chromatography using immobilized inhibitors and ion exchange chromatography. One of the purified forms of chymotrypsin (Chtr1) exhibited an unusual interaction with the highly selective protein trypsin inhibitor from Cucurbita maxima (CMTI). Interactions with other protein trypsin inhibitors such as basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI), trypsin inhibitors from Cyclanthera pedata (CyPTI), Cucurbita pepo (CPTI), Cucurbita pepo var. giramontia (CPGTI) and Linum usitatissimum (LUTI) were also investigated. This study demonstrated the affinity of Chtr1 to inhibitors containing Arg at P1 position. Studies of substrate specificity of Chtr1 using oxidized B-chain of insulin revealed four susceptible bonds: Tyr15-Leu16, Phe24-Phe25, Phe25-Tyr26 and, surprisingly, Arg22-Gly23. The amino acid composition, as well as the first 13 residues of the N-terminal amino acid sequence, was determined. Studies of ostrich elastase showed that it can interact with immobilized CMTI in the presence of 5 M NaCl. This unusual characteristic is reported for the first time and suggests that elastase specificity depends on ionic strength. The kinetic constants K(M), k(cat) and k(cat)/K(M) for purified ostrich trypsin, chymotrypsin 4 and elastase were also determined.
