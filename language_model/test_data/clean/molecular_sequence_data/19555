Using available Borrelia outer surface protein C (OspC) sequences, a phylogenetic analysis was undertaken to delineate the number of antigenic domains required for inclusion in a broadly protective, chimeric, OspC-based Lyme disease vaccine. The data indicate that approximately 34 would be required and that an OspC-based vaccinogen is feasible.
