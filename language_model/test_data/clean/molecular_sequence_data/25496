Pasteurella multocida toxin is a potent mitogen for cultured Swiss 3T3 cells where it causes an accumulation of inositol phosphates and activation of protein kinase C. The gene sequence described here coded for a 146 kDa protein. The ORF was preceded by a ribosome binding site and followed by a stem loop. There was no evidence for a signal sequence. The gene had a low G + C base ratio which differs from the rest of the Pasteurella genome. There was no significant homology with other known proteins, although a motif found in certain bacterial toxins which are ADP-ribosyl transferases is present. A recombinant expressing only part of the PMT gene was not mitogenic.
