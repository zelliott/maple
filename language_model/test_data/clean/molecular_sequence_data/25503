We have isolated a Drosophila gene that is expressed in a temporal and spatial pattern during embryogenesis, strongly suggesting an important role for this gene in the early development of muscle. This gene, which we have named nautilus (nau), encodes basic and helix-loop-helix domains that display striking sequence similarity to those of the vertebrate myogenic regulatory gene family. nau transcripts are initially localized to segmentally repeated clusters of mesodermal cells, a pattern that is reminiscent of the expression of the achaete-scute genes in the Drosophila peripheral nervous system. These early nau-positive cells are detected just prior to the first morphological evidence of muscle cell fusion and occupy similar positions as the later-appearing muscle precursors. Subsequently, nau transcripts are present in at least a subset of growing muscle precursors and mature muscle fibers that exhibit distinct segmental differences. These observations establish nau as the earliest known marker of myogenesis in Drosophila and indicate that this gene may be a key determinant of pattern formation in the embryonic mesoderm.
