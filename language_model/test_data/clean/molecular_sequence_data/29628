Although CD8(+) T cells initially suppress human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication, cytotoxic T-cell precursor frequencies eventually decline and fail to prevent disease progression. In a longitudinal study including 16 individuals infected with HIV-1, we studied both the number and function of HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells by comparing HLA-peptide tetramer staining and peptide-induced interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production. Numbers of IFN-gamma-producing T cells declined during progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), whereas the number of tetramer+ T cells in many individuals persisted at high frequencies. Loss of IFN-gamma-producing T cells correlated with declining CD4(+) T-cell counts, consistent with the need of CD4(+) T-cell help in maintaining adequate CD8(+) T-cell function. These data indicate that the loss of HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell activity is not due to physical depletion, but is mainly due to progressively impaired function of HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells.
