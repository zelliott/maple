Effects of thyrotropin hormone (TSH) and anti-TSH receptor antibodies on the plasma membrane potential of polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN) were analyzed by means of flow cytometry. Both TSH and the autoantibody caused a rapid, dose-dependent hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane of PMNs. TSH was also able to mask (revert) the depolarizing effect of a chemotactic peptide, fMLP, on PMNs. No detectable rise in the cytosolic free calcium level accompanied the observed hyperpolarization. Quinine, a blocker of Ca(2+)-activated and voltage-gated K+ channels did not affect the hyperpolarization by TSH and antibodies. Decreasing the [K+] gradient across the plasma membrane by valinomycin, however, blocked the hyperpolarizing effect. Peptide362-376 (derived from the extracellular domain of TSH receptor) also blocked the hyperpolarization induced by both TSH and anti-TSHR antibodies. These data suggest that the observed hyperpolarization is a specific, receptor-mediated early signal during interaction of PMNs with TSH or anti-TSHR antibodies.
