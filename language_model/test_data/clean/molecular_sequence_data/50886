In a search for synthetic peptide antigens fit to detect anti-HIV antibodies, a set of algorithms were used to predict the probable antigenic determinants of gag, pol, env and nef proteins of HIV-1 and HIV-2. Over forty peptides were synthesized by the solid-phase method. The reactivity of the peptide antigens was evaluated in ELISA on panels of HIV-1/2-positive sera. Application of the synthetic peptides for the early HIV diagnostics was examined.
