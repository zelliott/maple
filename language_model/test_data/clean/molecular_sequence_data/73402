We have analyzed nucleotide sequence variation at the Glucose dehydrogenase (Gld) locus from four populations of Drosophila melanogaster from four continents. All four population samples show a significant reduction in silent variation compared to the neutral expectation. The levels of silent variation across all four populations are consistent with the predictions of the background selection model; however, Zimbabwe has a remarkably low level of variation. In the face of dramatically reduced silent polymorphism, an amino acid variant, leading to the common allozyme polymorphism at Gld, remains in low to intermediate frequency in all non-African samples. In the Chinese population sample, the ratio of replacement to silent variation is significantly elevated compared to the neutral expectation. The difference in patterns of variation across these population samples suggests that selection on Gld (or the Gld region) has been different in the Chinese population than in the other three.
