Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM, CD31) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1, CD106) are essential for leukocyte emigration and diapedesis. PECAM is an essential histologic marker of endothelial cells; VCAM-1 is a prototype marker for endothelial cell activation. In this study, equine PECAM and VCAM mRNA were cloned and sequenced. Both genes are highly conserved amongst several species. This study also revealed conserved structural and regulatory motifs, emphasizing the importance of these genes' physiological roles in immunological responses.
