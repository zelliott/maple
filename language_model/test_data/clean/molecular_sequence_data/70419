A recombinant vaccinia virus expressing both glycoprotein H (gH) and glycoprotein L (gL) of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) was used to examine the protective response to gH-gL in immunized mice and to compare these responses with those induced by the highly protective immunogen, glycoprotein D (gD). Weak levels of HSV-1-specific neutralizing antibody were obtained in response to the gH-gL complex, virus clearance from the site of challenge was marginally enhanced compared to that observed following immunization with gH alone, and gH-gL was found to protect mice against acute infection in the ganglia, although not as efficiently as gD.
