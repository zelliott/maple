We screened a phage library of Rickettsia typhi with a polyclonal antiserum to clone genes which encode immunogenic proteins of R. typhi. Among several clones obtained, one clone codes for a 466-amino-acid protein similar to the heat-shock protein, HtrA. The deduced rickettsial HtrA contains a putative signal peptide sequence at the N-terminus, a serine protease-like domain, and two PDZ domains. The recombinant protein of rickettsial HtrA reacted with sera from patients with murine typhus and tsutsugamushi disease. We suggest that this gene and its recombinant protein would be valuable for the immunologic diagnosis of rickettsial diseases.
