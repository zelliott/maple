The multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) method was applied to improve the immunogenicity of synthetic peptides representing distinct regions of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA). A tetrameric MAP with multiply incorporated overlapping B- and T-cell epitopes was combined with a particular HA sequence representing the slightly modified fusion peptide on the C-terminus of the Lys core (MAP-1). As a result of repeated injections of BALB/c mice with MAP-1 but not with the monomeric HA1C[Arg] peptide, the appearance of MAP-1-specific antibodies crossreactive with the acid-pretreated virus could be observed. In vitro studies revealed the potency of the MAP-1 structure to induce proliferation of HA1C[Arg]-primed T-cells, and in vivo studies demonstrated the protective feature of the immune response elicited by MAP-1 and to a lesser extent by the monomeric HA1C[Arg]. The increased level of MAP-1 specific antibodies upon viral challenge shows the activation of MAP-1-specific B- and/or T-cells. The advantage of the previously verified FP3 helper T-cell epitope included in MAP-1 was further utilized to synthesize chimeric structures comprising short fragments of the zeta of (MAP-2) or delta (MAP-3) subunits of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) complex. The selected peptides of the zeta and delta-chain regions failed to elicit an antibody response in BALB/c mice as tetra- or octamers, but the inclusion of the modified fusion region resulted in an immunogenic construction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
