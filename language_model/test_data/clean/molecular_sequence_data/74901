We have used an assay combining DNA-mediated gene transfer and tumorigenicity in Swiss athymic mice to look for activated ras genes in solid human sporadic melanomas. This assay can detect ras oncogenes mutated at codons 12, 13, or 61. We examined a panel of 13 independent surgical specimens of primary tumors and metastases. No H- or K-ras oncogenes were detected; an N-ras oncogene, mutated at codon 61, was identified in one of the 13 samples. No N-ras genes mutated at codon 13 were detected. Thus, the tumorigenicity assay detects a low frequency of ras gene activation in melanomas.
