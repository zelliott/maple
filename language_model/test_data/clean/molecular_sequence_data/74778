The genomic sequence analysis of many large dsDNA viruses is hampered by the lack of enough sample materials. Here, we report a whole genome amplification of the Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) isolate Ma07 starting from as few as about 10 ng of purified viral DNA by application of phi29 DNA polymerase- and exonuclease-resistant random hexamer-based multiple displacement amplification (MDA) method. About 60 microg of high molecular weight DNA with fragment sizes of up to 25 kbp was amplified. A genomic DNA clone library was generated using the product DNA. After 8-fold sequencing coverage, the 127,615 bp of OrNV whole genome was sequenced successfully. The results demonstrate that the MDA-based whole genome amplification enables rapid access to genomic information from exiguous virus samples.
