To investigate the possible role of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in fulminant and subacute liver failure, we tested serum and liver of 13 patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation for the presence of HCV RNA. HCV RNA was detected in specimens from two out of eight patients negative for all viral markers with suspected hepatitis non-A, non-B infection and in one out of four patients with hepatitis B virus infection. Only in this patient replication of HCV could be demonstrated. We conclude, that fulminant and subacute hepatic failure is induced by hepatitis C virus only in few patients with hepatitis non-A, non-B.
