We report the molecular cloning, nucleotide (nt) sequence and chromosomal assignment of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene GLP1. This gene encoded a 15-kDa protein that was synthesized at a low level during growth on glucose and was induced ninefold upon glucose deprivation. When glucose withdrawal was accompanied by the addition of fatty acids the induction was enhanced an additional two- to threefold. The GLP1 gene product was identified as a soluble protein and purified using a combination of gel permeation and ion exchange chromatography. Using oligodeoxyribonucleotides as hybridization probes we have isolated the GLP1 gene and sequenced the single, long open reading frame which is 351 nt in length and is not interrupted by introns. The GLP1 gene directed the transcription of a 700-nt mRNA in response to glucose deprivation. The accumulation of the mRNA was further enhanced twofold by the addition of oleate. We have localized the GLP1 gene to S. cerevisiae chromosome VI.
