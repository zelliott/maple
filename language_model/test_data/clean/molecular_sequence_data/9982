Chemical modification studies and site-directed mutagenesis experiments have provided evidence that human lysosomal acid lipase/cholesteryl ester hydrolase (HLAL), human gastric lipase (HGL), and rat lingual lipase (RLL) are serine esterases. Loss of HLAL and HGL activity was also observed in the presence of sulfhydryl-reactive substances, suggesting that cysteines are likewise essential for substrate hydrolysis. To study the functional role of the HLAL and HGL cysteine residues, we replaced these amino acids with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. Substitutions at positions 227 and 236, alone or together, drastically reduced hydrolytic activity in a substrate-dependent manner while the other mutants were not affected to any great extent. HLAL(Cys227-->Ala), HLAL(Cys236-->Ala), and HLAL(Cys227-->Ala, Cys236-->Ala) were essentially inactive against cholesteryl oleate, but retained about 23-39%, 28-37%, and 13-17% of catalytic activity for both triolein and tributyrin, respectively. The data obtained with the corresponding HGL mutants confirmed the importance of residues 227 and 236 in maintaining enzymatic activity towards long- and short-chain triglycerides. In order to assess the contribution of the eight amino acids delimited by Cys227 and Cys236 to lipolysis, we generated HLAL replacement mutants containing the corresponding residues 228-235 of HGL or RLL. Both HLAL chimeras were catalytically active towards all three substrates analyzed, indicating that these amino acids do not determine HLAL substrate specificity. Deletion of the eight-amino acid alpha-helix as well as disruption of its hydrophobic surface, in contrast, abolished enzymatic activity. Our studies suggest that Cys227, Cys236, and the amphipathic helix formed by residues 228-235 are essential for HLAL- and HGL-mediated neutral lipid catabolism.
