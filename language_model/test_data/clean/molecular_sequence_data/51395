A vector encoding the Staphylococcal protein A was modified by cloning the spa gene, including its signal peptide-encoding sequence, downstream of the translation initiation sites of the phage lambda cro gene and under the control of the temperature-inducible phage lambda pR promoter. The expression from this construct was studied using the Escherichia coli phoA gene as a reporter gene after fusion to the spa gene. Determination of alkaline phosphatase activity, 1 h after temperature induction of expression at 42 degrees C, revealed an 800-fold increase over host strain background level. The presence of the alternating selectable markers on the described vector, pHEMa153, which are essential for efficient oligonucleotide-directed construction of mutations by the gapped duplex DNA method, allows the construction of recombinant and mutated forms of Staphylococcal protein A fusion proteins and efficient expression of spa gene fusions without changing the vector system.
