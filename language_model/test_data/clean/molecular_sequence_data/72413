Tertiary structure models of Interleukin-6 were constructed using a routine prediction method based on the X-ray crystal structures of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The models were evaluated with the aid of the sequence-structure compatibility (3D-1D) method program compass and NMR experimental information. The model constructed from GCSF gained higher scores on compass examination than did that from LIF, and the NOE data [Nishimura et al. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 273-281] also turned to be more consistent with the former model.
