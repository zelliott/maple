We used standard karyotypic analyses of first-division cells to identify a subpopulation of cells in primary malignant gliomas with over-representation of chromosomes 7 and 22. These cells are a minor subpopulation in the primary tumor but become the dominant population after treatment in vitro of the cells with the chemotherapeutic agent 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU). The selection for a cell with this specific karyotypic abnormality suggests that these chromosomes contain genes important to the growth of BCNU-resistant cells. Southern blot hybridization analyses demonstrate an increased copy number of the genes encoding platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A-chain and B-chain, which have been mapped to chromosomes 7 and 22, respectively. Reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis demonstrates increased expression of these genes. In addition, these cells secrete a mitogenic factor that stimulates 3H-thymidine uptake in NIH 3T3 cells. This factor is sensitive to anti-PDGF antibodies and beta-mercaptoethanol, but not to anti-EGF antibodies. These data suggest that autocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms occur in human malignant gliomas, and that over-expression of PDGF may play a role in the growth of BCNU-resistant cells in these tumors.
