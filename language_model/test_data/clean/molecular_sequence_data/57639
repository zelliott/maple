Two DNA restriction enzyme fragments coding for the 3' termini of 16S rRNA, the 5' termini of 23S rRNA, and the intergenic spaces between them in Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790 were cloned and sequenced. The intergenic space of one of these genes contains a tRNA(Ala) sequence, whereas the other does not. Nevertheless, the intergenic spaces contain several regions that exhibit high levels of sequence homology and are capable of forming structures with similar base pairs. An analysis of Southern blots of chromosomal DNA cut with one and two restriction enzymes indicated that E. hirae has a total of six rrn operons.
