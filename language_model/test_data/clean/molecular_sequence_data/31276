The nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the matrix (M) protein of mumps virus (MuV), Miyahara strain, has been determined from several overlapping cDNA clones. The M protein mRNA is 1248 nucleotides in length, exclusive of the poly(A) tail, and codes for a protein of 375 amino acids (Mr41,556). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the M protein of the Miyahara strain with that of the SBL-1 strain revealed that the M proteins of both strains are highly conserved. A significantly lower rate of nucleotide differences conducive to amino acid differences in the M gene compared with other genes appeared to indicate the importance of the conserved primary structure of the M protein for its function.
