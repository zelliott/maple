The gene for the mitochondrial small subunit rRNA (SSUrRNA) from the heterotrophic alga Prototheca wickerhamii has been isolated from a gene library of extranuclear DNA. Sequence and structural analyses allow the determination of a secondary structure model for this rRNA. In addition, several sequence motifs are present which are typically found in SSUrRNAs of various mitochondrial origins. Unexpectedly, the Prototheca RNA sequence has more features in common with mitochondrial SSUrRNAs from plants than with that from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The phylogenetic relationship between mitochondria from plants and algae is discussed.
