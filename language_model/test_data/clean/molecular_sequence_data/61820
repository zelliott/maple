The killer cell Ig-like receptor (KIR) gene family encodes MHC class I-specific receptors, which regulate NK cell responses and are also expressed on subpopulations of T cells. KIR haplotypes vary in gene content, which, in combination with allelic polymorphism, extensively diversifies the KIR genotype both within and between human populations. Species comparison indicates that formation of new KIR genes and loss of old ones are frequent events, so that few genes are conserved even between closely related species. In this regard, the hominoids define a time frame that is particularly informative for understanding the processes of KIR evolution and its potential impact on killer cell biology. KIR cDNA were characterized from PBMC of three gorillas, and genomic DNA were characterized for six additional individuals. Eleven gorilla KIR genes were defined. With attainment of these data, a set of 75 KIR sequences representing five hominoid species was assembled, which also included rhesus monkey, cattle, and rodent KIR. Searching this data set for recombination events, and phylogenetic analysis using Bayesian methods, demonstrated that new KIR were usually the result of recombination between loci in which complete protein domains were shuffled. Further phylogenetic analysis of the KIR sequences after removal of confounding recombined segments showed that only two KIR genes, KIR2DL4 and KIR2DL5, have been preserved throughout hominoid evolution, and one of them, KIR2DL4, is also common to rhesus monkey and hominoids. Other KIR genes represent recombinant forms present in a minority of species, often only one, as exemplified by 8 of the 11 gorilla KIR genes.
