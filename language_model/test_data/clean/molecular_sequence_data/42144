The complete nucleotide sequence of plum pox virus (PPV) strain SK 68 was determined from a series of overlapping cDNA clones. The exact 5' terminus was determined by direct RNA sequencing. The RNA sequence was 9786 nucleotides in length, excluding a 3' terminal poly(A) sequence. The large open reading frame starts at nucleotide position 147 and is terminated at position 9568. Comparison of cistrons from other plum pox virus strains with those predicted for the SK 68 strain indicated the same genomic organizations. Comparison of sequences leads to the following conclusions: (1) The genetic organization of all four PPV strains is identical, containing one large polyprotein gene and two noncoding regions at the 5' and 3' ends; (2) pairwise comparison of the genomic sequence of PPV SK 68 with other PPV strains shows 11% alteration. Sequence differences among strains are spread in a uniform manner upon the genome, except for the P1, HC-pro, and two noncoding regions, which are more conserved (with a 4% and 6.6% change). The stability of the noncoding regions is probably linked to their role in replication. The sequence variation has little effect on the amino acid sequence of the corresponding polypeptides, as changes occur preferentially in the third position of the reading frame triplets, except in the case of the 5' end of the coat protein gene (2.7% average difference in amino acid level, while in the case of coat protein it is 7.7%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
