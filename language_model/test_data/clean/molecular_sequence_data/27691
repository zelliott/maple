Phosphorylase kinase can be labeled specifically on the alpha subunit with fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate (FITC) which concomitantly inactivates the enzyme (T. G. Sotiroudis and S. Nikolaropoulus (1984) FEBS Lett. 176, 421-425). Labeled peptides have been purified and their primary structure has been determined. The amino acid sequence of the fluorescein-labeled tryptic peptide is Lys-Met-Gln-Asp-Gly-Tyr-Phe-Gly-Gly-Ala-Arg. The environment of this fluorescein-labeled lysine has been determined by sequencing peptides isolated from a Staphylococcus aureus V8 digest and two further cyanogen bromide fragments of the purified [14C]carboxymethylated alpha subunit. The partial sequences obtained have then been localized in the primary structure of the alpha subunit [Zander et al. (1988) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 85, 2929-2933]. Both the incorporation of the fluorescent label and enzymatic inactivation are inhibited by ATP only at pH 7.0; ADP and AMP do not protect. Kinetic analysis reveals a competition between ATP and FITC; a Ki for ATP of 728 +/- 100 microM has been determined.
