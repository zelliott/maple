We have combined a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) with the SV40 core nuclear localization signal (NLS), to create a bifunctional PNA-NLS peptide. The PNA-NLS peptide increased the nuclear uptake of oligonucleotides and enhanced the transfection efficacy of plasmids. Gene expression from an enhanced green fluorescent protein plasmid and a lacZ plasmid was preserved when hybridized to PNA-NLS. In combination with the transfection agent polyethyleneimine, we have improved both the nuclear translocation of fluorescence-marked oligonucleotides, and the efficacy of plasmid transfection, up to eightfold. The technique obviates the use of cumbersome coupling procedures of the vector due to DNA-PNA duplex formation or displacement of the antisense plasmid DNA strand by a PNA molecule.
