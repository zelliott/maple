To elucidate the detailed gene organization of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I region on chromosome 6, seven contiguous cosmid genomic clones covering the 237-kb segment around the HLA-B and -C loci were subjected to DNA sequencing by the shotgun strategy to give a single contig of 236,822 bp from the MICA gene (58.2 kb centromeric of HLA-B) to 90.8 kb telomeric of HLA-C. This region was confirmed to contain four known genes, MICA, HLA-17, HLA-B, and HLA-C, from centromere to telomere. Further, a new member of the P5 multicopy genes was found to be about 1.3 kb upstream of the HLA-17 gene and designated P5.8. Five novel genes designated NOB1-5 were identified by RT-PCR and Northern blot hybridization. In addition, two pseudogenes, dihydrofolate reductase pseudogene (DHFRP) and ribosomal protein L3 homologous gene (RPL3-Hom), were also found in the vicinity of the HLA-B and -C genes, respectively. The two segments (about 40 kb) downstream of the HLA-B and HLA-C genes showed high sequence homology to each other, suggesting that segmental genome duplication including the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene must have occurred during the evolution of the MHC.
