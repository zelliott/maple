Several di-, tri-, and oligopeptides were incubated individually in vitro with rumen fluid from two sheep receiving a mixed grass hay/concentrate diet and with washed cells of Prevotella (formerly Bacteroides) ruminicola M384 and P. ruminicola B(1)4. The rates of breakdown of most peptides were similar in the rumen fluid from the two sheep. Acidic and proline-containing peptides tended to be more slowly degraded than neutral or basic peptides. The dipeptide at the N-terminus of higher peptides was observed as an early product of hydrolysis, confirming that a dipeptidyl aminopeptidase type of activity was present. The relative rates of breakdown of dipeptides by P. ruminicola were different from that of rumen fluid, but the hydrolysis of higher peptides followed a similar pattern, and dipeptides from the N-terminus were detected as early products.
