To identify Peucedani Radix and its adulterants using DNA barcoding technique.

Total genomic DNA was isolated from Peucedani Radix and its adulterants. Nuclear DNA ITS2 sequences were amplified and purified PCR products were sequenced. Sequence assembly and consensus sequence generation were performed using the CodonCode Aligner V3.0. The Kimura 2-Parameter(K2P) distances were calculated using software MEGA 4. 0. Identification analyses were performed using BLAST1, Nearest Distance and Neighbor-Joining (NJ) methods, and the secondary structure of the ITS2 sequence differences between species were analyzed.

Different samples of Peucedani Radix were gathered together and distinguished from its adulterants by NJ tree. The ITS2 secondary structure showed that Peucedani Radix could be differentiated obviously from its adulterants.

ITS2 sequence is able to identify Peucedani Radix and its adulterants correctly, which provides a scientific basis for fast and accurate identification of the herb.
