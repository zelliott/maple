Novel peptide-based (paralog) sorbents are evaluated with respect to performance, reproducibility and reusability in a 96-well test plate screening format, and to utility in protein separations. The results demonstrate that this approach to constructing sorbents provides a new and generally applicable set of tools for separating proteins.
