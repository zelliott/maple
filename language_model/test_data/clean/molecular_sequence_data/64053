The protein and lipid composition of a vitellin isolated from eggs of Sparus aurata were characterized by SDS PAGE, N-terminal sequence analysis and lipid analysis by thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography. The lipoprotein complex contains proteins with apparent molecular weights of 69, 59, 23, 21 and 12 kDa and were characterized as vitellinogenin fragments by N-terminal sequencing. Lipid extraction and analysis indicate an association of cholesterol and phospholipids with the protein subunits. The phospholipids contain fatty acids with 14, 16 and 18 carbon atoms as determined by GC/MS.
