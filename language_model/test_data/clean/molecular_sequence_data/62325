Six novel branched beta-cyclodextrins (betaCDs) having beta-D-galactose residues on the non-reducing terminal of the sugar side chains, namely 6(1),6(4)-di-O-(beta-D-galactosyl)-betaCD (10), 6-O-(beta-D-galactosyl)-betaCD (11), 6(1),6(4)-di-O-(beta-lactosyl)-betaCD (14), 6-O-(beta-lactosyl)-betaCD (15), 6(1),6(4)-di-O-(4'-O-beta-D-galactosyl-beta-lactosyl)-betaCD (18), and 6-O-(4'-O-beta-D-galactosyl-beta-lactosyl)-betaCD (19), were chemically synthesized using the trichloroacetimidate method. The reaction products were separated by HPLC on an amino column into dibranched and monobranched betaCDs. Their structures were confirmed by mass spectrometry (MS) and two-dimensional (2D) NMR spectroscopic analysis. To study the length of the sugar side chains attached to the CD ring, which leads to differences in the functions of the branched CDs, interactions of these compounds with peanut (Arachis hypogaea) agglutinin (PNA) were investigated using an optical biosensor and an inhibition assay based on hemagglutination. The results showed that all branched betaCDs interacted with PNA, and the binding affinity was 18>14>10 and 19>15>11 when the derivatives were compared on the basis of side chain length.
