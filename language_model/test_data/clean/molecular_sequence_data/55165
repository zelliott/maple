A novel aerobic actinomycete strain, designated as SCSIO 02100(T), was isolated from a deep sea sediment sample collected from Northern South China Sea at a depth of 578 m. This isolate requires sea water or a sodium-supplemented medium for growth. BLAST searches based on the almost full length of the 16S rRNA gene sequence, showed that strain SCSIO 02100(T) had the highest similarities with Streptomyces armeniacus (JCM 3070(T)) (97.1 %). Phylogenetic trees reconstructed on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain SCSIO 02100(T) formed a distinct lineage with S. nanshensis SCSIO 01066(T) with 96.9 % similarity. Further analysis of the polyphasic taxonomic data, including morphological, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic properties, showed that strain SCSIO 02100(T) could be readily distinguished from the most closely related members of the genus Streptomyces. Thus, based on the polyphasic taxonomic data, a novel species, Streptomyces oceani sp. nov., is proposed, with the type strain SCSIO 02100(T) (=DSM 42043(T) = CGMCC 4.7007(T)).
