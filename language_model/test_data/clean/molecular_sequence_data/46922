MGC-24 is a sialomucin originally found in human gastric carcinoma cells, and in human hematopoietic progenitor cells. In the human, soluble and transmembrane forms of MGC-24 are present, and the transmembrane form has been implicated in adhesion of hematopoietic progenitor cells to marrow stroma cells. In the mouse, we found that only the transmembrane form was expressed in many organs. Northern blotting and in situ hybridization analysis showed that MGC-24 mRNA was widely expressed in various adult and embryonic tissues. The mouse MGC-24 gene, which we isolated, spanned about 12 kb and was comprised of six exons. The transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic domain were encoded by a single exon; the finding agrees with the absence of an alternatively spliced product of mouse MGC-24. The minimal promoter of mouse MGC-24 was embedded in GC-rich sequences, in which two Sp1 binding motifs were found, but it lacked TATA and CAAT boxes. That the promoter resembles that of house-keeping genes is consistent with the broad expression of mouse MGC-24 mRNA.
