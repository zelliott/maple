The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) from the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi AS has been determined by direct sequencing of overlapping PCR derived fragments. Comparison of the P. c. chabaudi AS nucleotide sequence with the previously published P. c. chabaudi IP-PC1 sequence indicates that although the MSP-1 gene of these two P. c. chabaudi strains is highly conserved, with sequence identity often approaching 100%, interspersed throughout the molecule are 5 regions of divergence. This is at variance with published data which suggested that the P. c. chabaudi AS and P. c. chabaudi IP-PC1 MSP-1 sequences are largely identical. Epitope mapping studies with a panel of anti-P. c. chabaudi AS MSP-1 monoclonal antibodies demonstrate that whilst most of these mAbs recognise epitopes at the N-terminus of the MSP-1 molecule, two mAbs, including one capable of inhibiting challenge infections in mice in an in vivo passive transfer assay, recognise epitopes which map to the C-terminus.
