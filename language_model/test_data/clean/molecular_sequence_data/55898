p53 gene which is known as a tumor suppressor gene locates in chromosome 17p and has a polymorphism at codon 72 (Arginine CGC-->Proline CCC). In this study, we examined the frequency of polymorphism and of heterozygosity in Japanese, and the loss of p53 gene in brain tumor tissues of the patients with heterozygosity using a novel method. The frequencies of heterozygosity, arginine type, proline type were 43%, 42% and 15%, respectively. Heterozygosity was observed in 15 out of 32 patients with brain tumors and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in these 15 cases was demonstrated in 40%. Although we are not certain whether LOH of p53 region is inevitable process of oncogenesis of some brain tumors, some false negative results may occur. This quick technique requires small amount of samples and no radioactive isotope, therefore, can be applied to detect mutation and LOH occurred in p53 region in terms of the genesis and progression of human neoplasms.
