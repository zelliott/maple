To identify factors important for the regulation of microtubule stability in yeast, dosage suppressors of the hyperstable microtubule phenotype of the budding yeast tub2-150 beta-tubulin mutation were isolated. Of the two suppressors reported here, one (JSN2) encodes a tRNAVal, and the other (JSN3) is an antimorphic allele of the methionine biosynthesis transcription factor Met4p. Furthermore, growth of tub2-150 mutants and suppression of tub2-150 mutants by JSN3 are sensitive to levels of methionine in the growth medium. We explore several possible explanations for these findings, including the potential involvement of the general amino acid control and the involvement of Cbflp, a component of yeast kinetochores that is also necessary for Met4p-mediated transcription.
