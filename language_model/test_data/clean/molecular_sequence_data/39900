The expression of lactoferrin, a non-specific antimicrobial defence, in the canine uterus during the normal estrous cycle and in bitches with pyometra was examined. Using polymerase chain reaction analysis, lactoferrin gene transcripts were detected in the endometrium at all stages of the estrous cycle, with the highest levels in estrus. In normal bitches, endometrial lactoferrin mRNA increased from proestrus to estrus (P<0.05). Thereafter, it dramatically decreased from estrus to Day 10 of diestrus (P<0.05), and stayed low at Day 35 of diestrus and anestrus; this was consistent with blood estrogen concentrations. Levels of lactoferrin mRNA were higher in bitches with pyometra than in normal diestrus (P<0.05). With immunohistochemistry, distinct staining of lactoferrin was detected in the luminal and glandular epithelial cells of the endometrium at proestrus and estrus, but little staining was detected at Day 10 of diestrus. At Day 35 of diestrus and anestrus, a partial and weak reaction was present in the same region. In bitches with pyometra, the glandular epithelial cells and many cells in the uterine stroma were strongly stained. Staining cells in the stroma were morphologically similar to neutrophils. No lactoferrin staining was seen in the uterine stromal cells or myometrium in any section. These results suggest that, in the canine uterus, lactoferrin expression is related to the blood concentration of estrogen, and that the dramatic reduction in lactoferrin observed at the early stage of diestrus may impair antimicrobial defense. Also, enhanced expression of lactoferrin mRNA in the endometrium with pyometra may be associated with neutrophil invasion into the uterus to combat the infection.
