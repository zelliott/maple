A new cellulose-inducible gene (named cel3) was isolated from a strain of the white rot basidiomycete, Irpex lacteus MC-2. The cel3 open reading frame, containing two introns, encodes a polypeptide of 526 amino acids residues with a molecular mass of 55794 Da. Expression of the cel3 gene was induced by various insoluble celluloses and CM-cellulose. Transcription of cel3 was abolished when cells were cultivated in media containing the above cellulosic substrates, but added with glucose, fructose or lactose, while addition of glycerol or mannitol did not affect the cel3 mRNA level. The amino acid sequence of the catalytic domain of the Cel3 protein was homologous to that of fungal exo-type cellulases belonging to family 7 of the glycosyl hydrolases. A phylogenetic study showed that these exo-type cellulases can be clearly separated from family 7 endo-type cellulases.
