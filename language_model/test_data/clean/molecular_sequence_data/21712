Lysozymes are the key molecules in innate immune system and possess high bactericidal properties. In the present study, a full-length c-type lysozyme cDNA has been cloned and characterized by expressed sequence tag (EST) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) techniques from kelp grouper, Epinephelus bruneus (Eb-CTL). The cDNA consists of 753 base pairs (bp) with a 432 bp open reading frame (ORF) that encodes 144 amino acids (aa) residues and polyadenylation signal sequence AATAAA. The deduced aa sequence polypeptide had a predicted molecular weight of 16 kDa and theoretical isoelectric point of 7.3. The deduced aa sequence have a long lysozyme domain which contains all catalytic sites and other conserved residues required for lysozyme activity. Pair-wise alignments showed a higher identity (76.4%) with Psetta maxima lysozyme and low identity (38.9%) with lysozymes of insect Bombyx mori. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis revealed that the kelp grouper lysozyme was more closely related to other fish and vertebrate lysozymes. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis showed that Eb-CTL transcripts are constitutively expressed in hematopoietic organs such as heart, spleen, and kidney after stimulation with LPS or infection with Vibrio anguillarum, indicating the involvement of Eb-CTL in the innate immunity of kelp grouper. This study is a first step on the genetics and functions of the c-type lysozyme in kelp grouper, and their role in anti-bacterial activity with reference to immunological properties which might have biotechnological applications.
