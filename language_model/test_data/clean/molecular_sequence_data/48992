An endospore-forming, gram-positive bacillus was isolated from a patient's blood culture. This bacillus did not grow in the presence of 5% carbon dioxide although it grew well in ambient air at 37 degrees C. Although the organism thus is an aerobic bacterium, its sensitivity to increased carbon dioxide concentration places it in a distinct category of gaseous atmospheric requirement: capnophobic. Based on its morphology, growth characteristics, biochemical reactions and a complete 16S rRNA gene nucleotide sequence analysis, this microorganism represents a novel Bacillus species. The clinical significance of this isolate is unknown. It is proposed that the bacterium be classified in the genus Bacillus as "Bacillus hackensackii".
