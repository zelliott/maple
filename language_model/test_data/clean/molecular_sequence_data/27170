Adenylate cyclase-hemolysin plays an important role in the virulence of Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica species. Its C-terminal region carries protective epitopes and receptor binding site for human cells. Genomic analyses of this region indicate no polymorphism in B. pertussis and B. parapertussis regions, but substantial variability in B. bronchiseptica that might be linked to the various niches of this species.
