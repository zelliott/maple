Two distinct protein translocation pathways that employ hydrophobic signal peptides function in the plant thylakoid membrane. These two systems are precursor specific and distinguished by their energy and component requirements. Recent studies have shown that one pathway is homologous to the bacterial general export system called Sec. The other one, called the DeltapH-dependent pathway, was originally considered to be unique to plant thylakoids. However, it is now known that homologous transport systems are widely present in prokaryotes and even present in archaea. Here we review these protein transport pathways and discuss their capabilities and mechanisms of operation.
