Actin-based motility involves a cascade of binding interactions designed to assemble actin regulatory proteins into functional locomotory units. Listeria ActA surface protein contains a series of nearly identical EFPPPPTDE-type oligoproline sequences for binding vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). The latter is a tetrameric protein with numerous GPP-PPP docking sites for profilin, a 15 kDa regulatory protein that promotes actin filament assembly. Analysis of known actin regulatory proteins led to the identification of distinct Actin-Based Motility homology sequences ABM-1; (D/E)FPPPPX(D/E); and ABM-2, XPPPPP (where X denotes G, A, L, and S).
