Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) can be induced in B6D2F1 mice by injection of parental DBA/2 lymphoid cells. Stimulation of donor T cells by host MHC antigens leads to the stimulation of host B cells. Little is known of the lymphokines produced during such a reaction. This study was designed to directly measure the levels of mRNA for interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10, as well as several other genes, using semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Semiquantitative PCR was reproducible and signals generated were dependent on the amount of specific RNA or cDNA in each reaction. Early during the progression of GVHD (2 days after the first injection of parental cells) there was little increase in IL-10 mRNA, a slight increase in IL-4 mRNA, and a dramatic increase in IL-2 mRNA. In addition, IL-2 bioactivity was demonstrated in supernatants from GVH splenocytes cultured in vitro for 24 h. Later in the response (1 week after the second and final injection of parental cells) IL-4 mRNA levels were elevated as they were earlier while IL-10 mRNA levels were dramatically increased. IL-2 mRNA levels were no different in mice undergoing GVHD than in normal mice at this time. IFN-gamma mRNA was detectable both early and late, although at similar levels in normal mice and mice undergoing GVHD. At both times examined, IL-4 was below the limits of detection by bioassay and IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10 were below the limits of detection by ELISA. Further studies showed that a majority of the IL-4 and IL-10 mRNA found elevated in GVH mice were produced by Thy1.2+ T cells, with small amounts from B220+ B cells. In addition, the detectable IFN-gamma mRNA found in GVH mice at this later time also was produced by Thy1.2+ T cells, with small amounts from B220+ B cells.
