Two clones, totalling 8068 bp and spanning over half of the coding region of the mitochondrial genome of Schistosoma mansoni, have been sequenced. Complete sequences are presented of the large and small ribosomal RNA subunits, CO2, ND3, ND4, ND6 and ATPase 6 genes. Incomplete sequences were found for the CO1, ND2 and CytB genes. At least 10 tRNAs were also detected and alternative structures for some of these discussed. The gene order of S. mansoni is unique and differs from that of Fasciola hepatica, the only other trematode for which any information is available.
