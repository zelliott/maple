The binding of a synthetic four-way junction in DNA by T4 endonuclease VII has been studied using gel retardation and footprint analysis. Two specific protein-DNA complexes have been observed, but only one is stable in the presence of moderate concentrations of salt. The footprint of T4 endonuclease VII in the salt-resistant complex has been probed using hydroxyl radicals generated by the reaction of iron(II)/EDTA with hydrogen peroxide. The hydroxyl radical cleavage pattern indicates protection of approximately 5 residues in two strands that are diametrically opposed across the junction point.
