All nucleated animal cells synthesize heme to provide the prosthetic group of respiratory cytochromes. Large amounts of heme are synthesized by erythroid cells for hemoglobin production and by liver cells for drug-induced cytochromes P450. This review focuses on the first enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway, 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS), which catalyzes the rate-controlling step in liver and possibly other tissues. We report that there are two distinct human genes for ALAS: one, a housekeeping gene, is probably ubiquitously expressed while the other is active only in erythroid tissue. By contrast it has been reported that, for porphobilinogen deaminase, the third enzyme of the heme pathway, there is a single human gene with two promoters; one functional in all tissues, the other erythroid specific. In liver, transcription of the housekeeping ALAS gene is induced by drugs and repressed by heme. Heme also acts in a novel way to prevent transport of ALAS into mitochondria, its site of function. Porphyrias result from inherited defects in enzymes of the heme pathway subsequent to ALAS and the molecular abnormality is now known for the most common subtype of acute intermittent porphyria. In developing red cells, levels of ALAS are regulated by increased gene transcription and by a post-transcriptional mechanism, in which iron most probably controls translation of erythroid ALAS mRNA through an iron-responsive element identified in the 5' untranslated region of the mRNA. The human erythroid ALAS gene is located on the X-chromosome, suggesting that a defect in this gene may be responsible for X-linked sideroblastic anemias.
