The surface expression in Staphylococcus carnosus of three different fibronectin binding domains (FNBDs), derived from fibronectin binding proteins of Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus, has been investigated. Surface localization of the chimeric proteins containing the FNBDs was demonstrated. All three surface-displayed FNBDs were demonstrated to bind fibronectin in whole-cell enzyme-linked binding assays. Furthermore, for one of the constructs, intranasal immunizations with the recombinant bacteria resulted in improved antibody responses to a model immunogen present within the chimeric surface proteins. The implications of the results for the design of live bacterial vaccine delivery systems are discussed.
