We have identified an apolipoprotein (apo) B mutation in a patient with an atypical form of retinitis pigmentosa (RP). In the family the eye disease is characterised by late age of onset and autosomal dominant inheritance. In addition to RP, the proband has low total cholesterol (4.5 mmol/l) and LDL-cholesterol (2.0 mmol/l) levels characteristic of the autosomal codominant apolipoprotein (apo) B deficiency disease hypobetalipoproteinemia (HBL). Using a monoclonal antibody directly against apo B and immunoblots of SDS polyacrylamide gel separated plasma, a normal apo B100 and a truncated apo B species with an estimated size of apo B54 was identified in the proband and his RP-affected sister. The location of the mutation in the apo B gene was identified using chemical cleavage of mismatch and this was confirmed by direct sequencing of an amplified fragment of DNA spanning the estimated site of the mutation. The mutation is a C----T transition at nucleotide 7692 which changes the CGA arginine2495 codon to a STOP codon resulting in the premature termination of apo B100. The truncated apo B protein is 2494 amino acids long with a predicted size of apo B55. Using allele specific oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide melting techniques, the proband, his sister and two other relatives out of a total of 20 family members, screened for the presence of the apo B55 mutation, were heterozygous for the mutation. The segregation of the apo B55 allele was confirmed in the family using the 3' variable number of tandem repeats of the apo B gene.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
