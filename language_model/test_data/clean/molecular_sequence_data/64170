Ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains are found in a large number of proteins with diverse functions involved in ubiquitination, DNA repair, and signaling pathways. Recent studies have shown that several UBA domain proteins interact with ubiquitin (Ub), specifically p62, the phosphotyrosine-independent ligand of the SH2 domain of p56(lck); HHR23A, a human nucleotide excision repair protein; and DDI1, another damage-inducible protein. NMR chemical shift mapping reveals that Ub binds specifically but weakly to a conserved hydrophobic epitope on HHR23A UBA(1) and UBA(2) and that the UBA domains bind on the hydrophobic patch on the surface of the five-stranded beta-sheet of Ub. Models of the UBA(1)-Ub and UBA(2)-Ub complexes obtained from de novo docking reveal different orientations of the UBA domains on the Ub surface compared with those obtained by homology modeling with the related CUE domains, which also bind Ub. Our results suggest that UBA domains may interact with Ub as well as other proteins in more than one way while utilizing the same binding surface.
