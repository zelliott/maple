Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strains show glutamate decarboxylase activity, whereas L. lactis subsp. cremoris strains do not. The gadB gene encoding glutamate decarboxylase was detected in the L. lactis subsp. cremoris genome but was poorly expressed. Sequence analysis showed that the gene is inactivated by the frameshift mutation and encoded in a nonfunctional protein.
