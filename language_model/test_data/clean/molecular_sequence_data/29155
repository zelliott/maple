We present the genomic characterization of a Spanish isolate of Mycobacterium malmoense. Identification and molecular characterization of the microorganism were performed using the technique of PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (PRA) and sequencing of the 16S and the ITS spacer (16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region). It was seen that our isolate is very similar to the strain described in Sweden, but differs in the sequencing of the ITS from the isolate in Great Britain. Molecular techniques facilitate a rapid diagnosis and enable a better understanding of the epidemiology of this microorganism.
