(1) The intestinal Fc receptors of neonatal rats and mice consists of beta 2m and an alpha-chain that is similar to those of MHC class I and CD1 antigens. (2) Mouse and rat FcRns are highly conserved. There are no amino acid substitutions in the 90 amino acid alpha 3 domain, and only one in the 40 amino acid cytoplasmic tail. (3) Despite its similarity to class I MHC antigens, the mouse FcRn alpha-chain is encoded outside the MHC, on chromosome 7.
