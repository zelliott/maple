5'-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends, done on poly(A)+ RNA from human U87 cells, was used to identify 420 bp of novel 5' sequence of a PDE4B cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE). This identified an open reading frame encoding a putative 721-residue 'long-form' PDE4B splice variant, which we term HSPDE4B3. HSPDE4B3 differs from the two known PDE4B forms by virtue of its unique 79-residue N-terminal region, compared with the unique N-terminal regions of 94 and 39 residues found in HSPDE4B1 and HSPDE4B2 respectively. In transfected COS7 cells the two long forms, HSPDE4B1 and HSPDE4B3, had molecular masses of approx. 104 and approx. 103 kDa respectively. Expressed in COS-7 cells, the three HSPDE4B isoforms were found in the high-speed supernatant (cytosol) fraction as well as both the high-speed pellet (P2) and low-speed pellet (P1) fractions. All isoforms showed similar Km values for cAMP hydrolysis (1.5-2.6 microM). The maximal activities of the soluble cytosolic activity of the two long forms were very similar, whereas that of the short form, HSPDE4B2, was approx. 4-fold higher. Particulate-associated HSPDE4B1 and HSPDE4B2 were less active (approx. 40%) than their cytosol forms, whereas particulate HSPDE4B3 was similar in activity to its cytosolic form. Particulate and cytosolic forms of HSPDE4B1 and HSPDE4B3 were similarly inhibited by rolipram {4-[3-(cyclopentoxyl)-4-methoxyphenyl]-2-pyrrolidone}, the selective inhibitor of PDE4 (IC50 0.05-0.1 microM), whereas particulate-associated HSPDE4B2 was profoundly (approx. 10-fold) more sensitive (IC50 0.02 microM) to rolipram inhibition than its cytosolic form (IC50 0.2 microM). The various particulate-associated HSPDE4B isoforms showed very different susceptibilities to solubilization with the detergent Triton X-100 and high NaCl concentration. A novel cDNA, called pRPDE74, was obtained by screening a rat olfactory lobe cDNA library. This contained an open reading frame encoding a 721-residue protein that showed approx. 96% amino acid identity with HSPDE4B3 and is proposed to reflect the rat homologue of this human enzyme and is thus called RNPDE4B3. Alternative splicing of mRNA generated from both the human and rat PDE4B genes produces long and short splice variants that have unique N-terminal splice regions. It is suggested that these alternatively spliced regions determine changes in the maximal catalytic activity of the isoforms, their susceptibility to inhibition by rolipram and mode of interaction with particulate fractions.
