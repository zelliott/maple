Mass correlated acceleration (MCA) has now been integrated into a 4 in (10.2 cm) matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer to achieve high resolving power across a broader mass range, without sacrificing detection of higher mass ions. The goal was to combine MCA with a custom-built miniaturized instrument such as those that might be used for field-portable applications. Unlike other pulsed extraction methods, MCA is not mass dependent and mass spectra can be achieved with a single tuning of instrument parameters. Additionally, the multi-channel recording advantage is better realized because ions of all masses can be brought into focus simultaneously. The MCA dual-stage ion source compensates dynamically for the mass dependence by incorporating an extraction pulse region followed by an acceleration region that contains a time-dependent waveform correlated with mass. The technique was validated with applications in peptide mixtures and protein digestions. Diagnostic studies for the instrument include m/z range and limits of detection.
