The synthesis of a protected bifunctional analog of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is described. The molecule contains an aminobenzyl moiety that allows the easy attachment of the chelating agent to a wide variety of groups. Examples of reaction with the C-termini of two peptides are given. In the following paper, the two peptides are used to study the enzymatic cleavage of metal chelates from a monoclonal antibody.
