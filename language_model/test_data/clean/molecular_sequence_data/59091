Five arabidopsis kn1-like homeobox genes were cloned through low-stringency screening of Arabidopsis cDNA libraries with the kn1 homeobox from maize. These five genes were named KNAT1-5 (for kn1-like Arabidopsis thaliana). An analysis of KNAT1 and 2 has been presented previously [19]. Here we present an analysis of the genes KNAT3, 4 and 5. On the basis of sequence and expression patterns, these three genes belong to the class II subfamily of kn1-like homeobox genes [16]. Low-stringency Southern analysis suggests several additional members of the class II genes exist in the Arabidopsis genome. The predicted amino acid sequences of the three genes share extensive homology outside of the homeodomain, including 84% between KNAT3 and KNAT4. Northern analysis shows that although all three genes are expressed in all tissues examined, the level of KNAT3 RNA is highest in young siliques, inflorescences and roots, KNAT4 RNA level is strongest in leaves and young siliques, and KNAT5 RNA level is highest in roots. The specificity of these patterns was confirmed by RNA fingerprint analysis. KNAT3 and 4 are light-regulated as they show reduced expression in etiolated seedlings and also in hy3, cop1 and det1 mutant backgrounds.
