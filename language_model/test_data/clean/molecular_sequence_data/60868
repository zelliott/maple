Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). RT-PCR verified by Southern blotting and sequencing of PCR products of two C-C chemokines, MIP-1alpha and MCP-1, was performed on brain samples from EAE rats to evaluate mRNA transcription of these chemokines at different stages of disease. mRNA transcription in of each chemokine peaked after the onset of disease and declined during its remission. Each PCR product was then used as a construct for naked DNA vaccination. The subsequent in vivo immune response to MIP-1alpha or MCP-1 DNA vaccines prevented EAE. Immunization of CFA without the encephalitogenic epitope did not elicit an anti-C-C chemokine regulatory response in DNA- vaccinated rats. Thus, modulation of EAE with C-C chemokine DNA vaccines is dependent on targeting chemokines that are highly transcribed at the site of inflammation at the onset of disease.
