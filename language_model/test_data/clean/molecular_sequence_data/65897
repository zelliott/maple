Until very recently isolates of American plum line pattern virus (APLPV) had not been reported from outside North America. The nucleotide sequences corresponding to the movement (MP) and coat (CP) proteins of eight APLPV isolates from five Mediterranean countries were determined. Sequence analysis showed that both MP and CP genes are highly conserved irrespective of geographic origin. The study of the distribution of synonymous and nonsynonymous changes along both open reading frames revealed that these proteins are under the effect of negative purifying selection. The MP and CP of APLPV possess most of the functional motifs described for other members of the genus Ilarvirus.
