In the course of systematic cloning of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) expressed in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, we have identified the murine homologue of human Bmx. It encodes a protein containing the five domains characteristic of the Tec family of cytoplasmic src-related PTKs: pleckstrin homology (PH), Tec homology (TH), src homology 3 and 2 (SH3 and SH2), and tyrosine kinase (TK). In adults, Bmx expression was found primarily in bone marrow and at a lower level in lung and heart. During fetal development it was also found in the spleen at late stage of gestation and in neonates. Analysis of bone marrow subpopulations showed that Bmx was expressed in the progenitor cell population and maturing hematopoietic cells of the granulo/monocytic lineage where expression increased with maturation and differentiation. At the periphery, a high level of Bmx expression was also found in neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages. Bmx expression was not detected in the primitive hematopoietic stem cell population, and cells of the B-, T-, and erythroid-lineages. It was also not detected in most of the cell lines examined. Our results indicate that Bmx is another member of the Btk/Itk/Tec PTK family, which is predominantly expressed in the granulo-monocytic lineage within the hematopoietic system.
