Several non-pigmented bacterial isolates, with an optimum growth temperature of about 50-55 degrees C, were recovered from the Elisenquelle at Aachen, Germany. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strains AA-1(T) and AA-2 indicated that these organisms represent a new species of the genus Tepidimonas. The major fatty acids of strains AA-1(T) and AA-2 are 16:0 and 16:1 omega7c. Ubiquinone 8 is the major respiratory quinone, the major polar lipids are phosphotidylethanolamine and phosphotidylglycerol. The new isolates are aerobic; thiosulfate is oxidized to sulfate in the presence of a metabolizable carbon source. The organism assimilated organic acids and amino acids, but did not assimilate carbohydrates or polyols. On the basis of the phylogenetic analyses, physiological and biochemical characteristics, we propose that strains AA-1(T) (=LMG 23094(T); =CIP 108777(T)) and AA-2 (=LMG 23095; =CIP 108778) represents a new species for which we recommend the name Tepidimonas thermarum.
