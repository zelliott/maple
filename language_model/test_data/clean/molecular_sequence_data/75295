Glycophorin A is the major membrane sialoglycoprotein of human erythrocytes and represents a typical example of a transmembrane glycoprotein. The functional role of this cell-surface component is not known but it represents a receptor for viruses, bacteria and parasites like Plasmodium falciparum. 1. Two cDNA clones encoding glycophorin A have been characterized from human fetal cDNA libraries. The longer cDNA extended from the coding region of glycophorin A (residues 4-131) to the 3' untranslated region which included two polyadenylation signals and a poly(A) tail. 2. The structural gene for glycophorin A is located on chromosome 4, q28-q31 as shown by in situ hybridization, thus confirming the previous localization by genetic linkage analysis. 3. Three distinct mRNA species (1.0 kb, 1.7 kb and 2.2 kb) have been identified in erythroid spleen. Northern blot analyses with a probe directed against the 3' untranslated region of the mRNAs indicated that all these species share a homologous 3' non-coding region and that the first polyadenylation signal downstream the stop codon is not used. 4. Preliminary studies by Southern blot analysis of the genomic DNA from normal En(a+) and rare En(a-) donors suggest that the glycophorin A gene has a complex organization and is largely deleted in donors of the En(a-) phenotype (Finnish type) who lack glycophorin A on their red cells.
