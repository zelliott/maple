Previously characterized monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to Grapevine virus A (GVA) showed a differential reactivity against intact or partially destabilized virus particles [2]. In the present study, this differential reactivity was confirmed and several peptides reacting with a panel of four different antibodies were identified by the PEPSCAN method of epitope mapping. Oligopeptide sequences comprised between coat protein residues 61 (V) and 72 (T) were recognized by all the antibodies tested. One of these peptides (VGPKASK) was also reactive when expressed on recombinant phage particles as a fusion protein with protein pVIII. The specificity of this sequence for antibody binding was also demonstrated by competitive-ELISA using one of the GVA MAbs. The results of this study suggest that GVA particles carry a highly structured epitope centered on a common peptide region of the coat protein sequence.
