The mouse remains the animal of choice in transgenic experiments, creating a need for methods of evaluating the physiology of genetically modified animals. We have established and characterized two murine models of renovascular hypertension known as the two-kidney, one clip and one-kidney, one clip models. The appropriate size of the clip lumen needed to induce high blood pressure was determined to be 0.12 mm. Clips with a lumen of 0.11 mm induced a high percentage of renal infarction, and clips with a 0.13-mm opening did not produce hypertension. Four weeks after clipping, two-kidney, one clip hypertensive mice exhibited blood pressure approximately 20 mm Hg higher than their sham-operated controls. After a similar period, this increase reached almost 35 mm Hg in the one-kidney, one clip model. Depending on the model, mice develop either renin-dependent or renin-independent hypertension. Both models are characterized by the development of cardiovascular hypertrophy.
