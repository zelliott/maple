Mortality from myeloid leukosis was observed in commercial layers from 12 farms in northern China. Affected chickens were extremely thin and dehydrated, bleeding occurred in feather follicles and claws, combs were pale and anaemic, phalanges were swollen, and many yellowish-white tumours were seen on the visceral surface of the sternum. Focal tumour cells, with spherical eosinophilic granules in the cytoplasm, were found in the liver, spleen, kidney, ovary, oviduct, lung, bone marrow, proventriculus and gut by histopathological examination. Immunohistochemical studies with a monoclonal antibody to gp85 of avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) revealed antigen in all organs examined. Polymerase chain reaction tests using a pair of ALV-J-specific primers H5/H7 (Smith et al., 1998) produced a 545 basepair fragment. The sequence of the Polymerase chain reaction product was compared with that of the ALV-J HPRS-103 prototype strain. The identity of nucleotides and predicted amino acids was 97.4% and 96.1%, respectively. On this basis the disease in the egg-type chickens was diagnosed as an ALV-J infection. This is the first report of field cases of myeloid leukosis caused by ALV-J in commercial egg-type chickens.
