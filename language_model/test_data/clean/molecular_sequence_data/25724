CPI-CDPI2 is a synthetic analogue of CC-1065, which is a naturally occurring antitumor antibiotic. Assignment of the 1H NMR spectra of a CPI-CDPI2-oligodeoxyribonucleotide decamer, d-(CGCTTAAGCG)2, complex has been made by two-dimensional 1H/1H spectroscopy. The solution structure of the complex was calculated by an iterative hybrid relaxation matrix method combined with NOESY distance restrained molecular dynamics. Refinement proceeded in two steps in which the decamer was initially refined alone and then CPI-CDPI2 was added to the structure to allow initial estimates of drug-DNA contacts. A hybrid matrix/MD refinement was used to better take into account problems associated with spin diffusion. Thus the distances from the 2D NOESY spectra were calculated from the relaxation rate matrix which were evaluated from a hybrid NOESY volume matrix comprising elements from the experimental spectrum and those calculated from an initial structure. The hybrid matrix derived distances were then used in a restrained molecular dynamics procedure to obtain a new structure that better approximates the NOESY spectra. The resulting partially refined structure was then used to calculate an improved theoretical NOESY volume matrix which is once again merged with the experimental matrix until refinement is complete. The efficacy of CC-1065 has been attributed to its minor groove binding and alkylation to the N3 position of adenosine. CPI-CDPI2 appears to bind to the decamer in a similar manner. The effect of CPI-CDPI2 on the decamer's 1H and 31P spectrum was consistent with a minor groove binding motif with the drug alkylating at A17 with the CDPI rings oriented toward the 5'-end of the alkylated strand. In addition, the NMR data support one major adduct but also indicate the presence of a minor adduct. The latter could represent a drug alkylation of the DNA at a secondary site (or alternative orientation of the rings).
