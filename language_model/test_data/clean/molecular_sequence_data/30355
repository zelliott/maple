Abetalipoproteinemia (ABLP) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by a lack of plasma apolipoprotein B (apo B). In this report, the hypothesis that ABLP is due to rare mutations in the apo B gene was tested. A total of eight ABLP families were studied. Apo B gene RFLPs were used to establish the haplotypes of the apo B alleles in family members. LOD score analysis was used to study the linkage between the apo B alleles and ABLP. These families were categorized arbitrarily as class I, II, III, or IV because of differences in the results derived from both haplotyping and LOD score analysis. In a class I family, affected siblings, who on the basis of the hypothesis would be expected to have the same apo B alleles, had different ones. LOD score analysis of this family gave an infinite negative number at a recombination fraction (theta) of zero. In two class II families, probands who were the result of consanguineous marriages and who, on the basis of the hypothesis, should be homozygotes for a defective apo B allele, were heterozygotes at this locus. The sum of the LOD scores from these two families was -1.7 at theta = 0. In one class III family, a parent was apparently homozygous for a particular apo B allele and yet not affected. This also contributed negatively to the LOD score. In four class IV families, disease inheritance was compatible with segregation of the apo B alleles. This, however, was not statistically significant (LOD score = 0.97 at theta = 0).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
