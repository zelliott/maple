Syncytium-inducing (SI) variants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are evolutionary variants that are associated with rapid CD4+ cell loss and rapid disease progression. The heteroduplex tracking assay (HTA) was used to detect evolutionary V3 variants by amplifying the V3 sequences from viral RNA derived from 50 samples of patient plasma. For this V3-specific HTA (V3-HTA), heteroduplexes were formed between the patient V3 sequences and a probe with the subtype B consensus V3 sequence. Evolution was then measured by divergence from the consensus. The presence of evolutionary variants was correlated with SI detection data on the same samples from the MT-2 cell culture assay. Evolutionary variants were correlated with the SI phenotype in 88% of the samples, and 96% of the SI samples contained evolutionary variants. In most cases the evolutionary V3 variants represented discrete clonal outgrowths of virus. Sequence analysis of the six discordant samples that did not show this correlation indicated that three non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) samples had V3 sequences that had evolved away from the consensus sequence but not toward an SI genotype. A fourth sample showed little evolution away from the consensus but was SI, which indicates that not all SI variants require basic substitutions in V3. The other two samples had SI-like genotypes and NSI phenotypes, suggesting that V3-HTA was able to detect SI emergence in these samples in the absence of their detection in vitro. V3-HTA was also used to confirm SI variant selection in MT-2 cells and to examine the possibility of variant selection during virus culture in peripheral blood cells.
