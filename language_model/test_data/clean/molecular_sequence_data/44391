In this study a second endogenous Porphyromonas gingivalis insertion element (IS element) that is capable of transposition within P. gingivalis was identified. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the Tn4351 insertion site in a P. gingivalis Tn4351-generated transconjugant showed that a complete copy of the previously unidentified IS element, designated PGIS2, had inserted into IS4351R in Tn4351. PGIS2 is 1,207 bp in length with 19-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats, and insertion resulted in a duplicated 10-bp target sequence. Results of Southern hybridization of chromosomal DNA isolated from several P. gingivalis strains with a PGIS2-specific probe demonstrated that the number of copies of PGIS2 per genome varies among different P. gingivalis strains. Computer analysis of the putative polypeptide encoded by PGIS2 revealed strong homologies to the products encoded by IS1358 from Vibrio cholerae, ISAS1 from Aeromonas salmonicida, and H-rpt in Escherichia coli K-12.
