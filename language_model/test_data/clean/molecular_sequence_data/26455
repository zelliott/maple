Two open reading frames followed by a rho-independent transcription terminator and early promoter were established in a sequenced region downstream from gene 31 of T4 phage. The mRNA hairpin suggested by the terminator sequence has the structure (x)8CUUCGG(y)8, the loop sequence UUCG having been shown to significantly stabilize RNA hairpins.
