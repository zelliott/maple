The genus Orthobunyavirus is composed of segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses that are responsible for mild to severe human diseases. To date, no molecular studies of bunyaviruses in the genus Orthobunyavirus from central Africa have been reported, and their classification relies on serological testing. Four new primer pairs for RT-PCR amplification and sequencing of the complete genomic small (S) RNA segments of 10 orthobunyaviruses isolated from the Central African Republic and pertaining to five different serogroups have been designed and evaluated. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these 10 viruses belong to the Bunyamwera serogroup. The S segment sequences differ from those of the Bunyamwera virus reference strain by 5-15 % at the nucleotide level, and both overlapping reading frames, encoding the nucleocapsid (N) and non-structural (NS) proteins, were evident in sequenced genomes. This study should improve diagnosis and surveillance of African bunyaviruses.
