Cytokines are soluble mediators that possess both intra- and intercellular signaling properties. Their function has been investigated most thoroughly in the context of immune reactions. Cytokines, however, form an important component of the inflammatory response to trauma and are found in elevated concentrations following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). We were, therefore, interested in studying mRNA expression for the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. White cells isolated from the circulation of seven patients before and after CPB were assayed for the expression of mRNA with TNF-alpha specific primers using the polymerase chain reaction. Message for TNF-alpha was found in all patients, with the highest values demonstrated in patients whose CPB times exceeded 1 1/2 hours. Enhanced message expression was seen as early as 1 hour after the start of CPB. Genes responsible for cytokine (TNF-alpha) expression and production are activated during cardiac surgery.
