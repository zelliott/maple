Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Southern hybridization and DNA sequencing experiments were done to determine whether all of Tn4560, a Streptomyces transposon, integrated into the genomes of three nikkomycin non-producing mutants. A deletion of 279 bases occurred at one end of Tn4560 while present in the genome of one of the mutants.
