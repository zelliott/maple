Agonist-stimulated production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3], is considered the primary output signal of activated phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase. The physiological targets of this novel phospholipid and the identity of enzymes involved in its metabolism have not yet been established. We report here the identification of two enzymes which hydrolyze the 5-position phosphate of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, forming phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate. One of these enzymes is the 75 kDa inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (75 kDa 5-phosphatase), which has previously been demonstrated to metabolize inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3], inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate [Ins(1,3,4,5)P4] and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2]. We have identified a second PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase in the cytosolic fraction of platelets, which forms a complex with the p85/p110 form of PI 3-kinase. This enzyme is immunologically and chromatographically distinct from the platelet 43 kDa and 75 kDa 5-phosphatases and is unique in that it removes the 5-position phosphate from PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, but does not metabolize PtdIns(4,5)P2, Ins(1,4,5)P3 or Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. These studies demonstrate the existence of multiple PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 5-phosphatases within the cell.
