The nucleotide sequence of the virion protein (VP) gene of erysimum latent tymovirus (ELV) has been determined and the amino acid sequence of the VP deduced and confirmed by peptide analysis. The ELV VP is larger than the VPs of other tymoviruses because it has, unexpectedly, 11 more amino acid residues at its N terminus. The amino acid sequences of the VPs of ELV and four other tymoviruses align unequivocally and their relationships, as assessed from the percentage of identical residues, correlate well with previously reported serological tests which have shown ELV to be distant from other tymoviruses.
