Transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana plants expressing the replicase gene of cymbidium ringspot tombusvirus (CymRSV) were tested for the biological activity of the transgene. Protoplasts from one resistant and three susceptible transgenic lines were transfected with in vitro synthesized defective interfering (DI) RNA, a small subviral molecule which requires only the virus replicase for replication. Only protoplasts of susceptible transgenic lines were able to sustain the replication of DI RNA, whereas protoplasts of the resistant line were not. The transgene of the resistant line was recovered from transgenic cells, cloned, and shown to be intact and functional, which suggests that this is not a case of dysfunctional replicase conferring resistance to transgenic plants as a "dominant negative mutant." Plants of the transgenic line resistant to CymRSV were shown to be susceptible to two other tombusviruses, artichoke mottled crinkle and carnation Italian ringspot virus. Since the resistance is specific and inversely correlated to the level of expression of the transgene, it appears to be a form of RNA-mediated resistance.
