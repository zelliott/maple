Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) play a central role in cellular immunity against tumor. We have revealed the characteristics of TILs in terms of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, T-cell clonality, and cytokine production. TCR repertoire analyses and CDR3 size spectratyping were performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and tissue specimens of gastric or colorectal cancers surgically resected from 11 patients. The cytokine expression was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. TCR repertoires were similar among multiple tissue specimens from different sites of the same tumor. Similar peak patterns of CDR3 size spectratyping were observed among these tumor specimens, but not in normal tissues or PBMCs. In addition, identical peaks were detected in multiple specimens of the same tumor. The ratio of the levels of IFN-gamma to that of IL-4 is significantly higher for tumor lesions compared with PBMCs. These results suggested that a limited number of TILs locally expand in response to tumor antigens exiting within gastric or colorectal cancers and local predominant production of the T helper 1/T cytotoxic 1 type cytokine may affect the anti-tumor immune response of TILs.
