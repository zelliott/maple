To better understand the molecular signaling events leading to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and multiple organ failure (MOF), changes in gene expression profiles after burn injury were investigated by differential display. C57BLKS/J mice were subjected to 18% total body surface area (TBSA) full-thickness burn and various tissues were harvested at multiple time points after injury. Initial differential display revealed that retroviral transcripts similar to the envelope sequence of murine AIDS (MAIDS) virus were rapidly and transiently up-regulated after injury. Subsequent RT-PCR and DNA sequencing analyses confirmed the transient up-regulation of retroviral sequences similar to those of the MAIDS virus. In addition, the presence and induction of the subgenomic envelope transcripts of these MAIDS virus-related sequences, including a novel double spliced message, were identified after burn injury. These data suggest that the transcriptional efficiency of the integrated retroviral DNA and reactivation of defective MAIDS virus-related sequences may be affected by pathophysiological signals, such as burn injury. The elevated expression of these MAIDS virus-related retroviral sequences may affect the transcriptional activities of the flanking genes at the integration sites and may be a cause of altered local and systemic immune responses to burn-related stress.
