The chemical synthesis of oligoribonucleotides containing vicinal (2'-5')- and (3'-5')-phosphodiester linkages is described. The solid-phase method, based on silyl-phosphoramidite chemistry, was applied to the synthesis of a series of branched RNA [(Xp)nA2' (pN)n3'(pN)n] related to the splicing intermediates derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae rp51a pre-messenger RNA. The branched oligonucleotides have been thoroughly characterized by nucleoside and branched nucleotide composition analysis. Branched oligoribonucleotides will be useful in the study of messenger RNA splicing and in determining the biological role of RNA 'lariats' and 'forks' in vivo.
