The ability of site-specific antipeptide antisera to enhance the biological activity of ovine FSH (oFSH) in vivo was investigated using hypopituitary Snell dwarf mice. These animals were shown to respond to increasing doses of oFSH (3.3-90 micrograms/day), administered in two daily injections over a 5-day treatment period, in a highly significant dose-dependent fashion. The responses measured were increases in uterine weight, ovarian weight and the index of keratinisation in vaginal smears. The dose-dependent response to oFSH confirmed the suitability of this animal model for these investigations and suggested the suboptimal dose of oFSH (20 micrograms/day) for use in enhancement studies. Five peptides derived from the beta subunit of bovine FSH (bFSH) (A, residues 33-47; B, 40-51; C, 69-80; D, 83-94; E, 27-39) were used to generate polyclonal antipeptide antisera. Of these peptides, only A and B produced an antiserum (raised in sheep) capable of recognising 125I-bFSH in a liquid phase RIA. Antisera prepared against peptide A or peptide B were found to significantly enhance the biological activity of 20 micrograms oFSH/day over a 5-day treatment period. The response to antipeptide antisera alone did not differ significantly from that observed in PBS-injected control animals, neither did the response to FSH alone differ from that observed in animals treated with FSH plus preimmune serum. Thus the enhanced responses are dependent upon the presence of FSH plus antipeptide antiserum. Peptides A and B are located in a region thought to be involved in receptor recognition, this may have implications for the mechanism underlying this phenomenon and/or the structure/function relationships of FSH. That FSH-enhancing antisera can be generated by immunisation of animals with peptides A and B suggests that it may be possible to develop these peptides as vaccines capable of increasing reproductive performance, such as ovulation rate. The high degree of sequence homology between ovine, bovine and porcine (and to a lesser extent human and equine) FSH in the region covered by peptides A and B suggests that these peptides could also be used to promote and regulate ovarian function in all of these species.
