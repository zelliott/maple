Animal African trypanosomosis is a serious constraint to livestock sector development in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease, mainly caused by Trypanosoma congolense, has a limitation in its diagnosis and treatment. There is urgent need for a simple, rapid detection technique to replace the few available serological tests that are of variable sensitivity and specificity. Currently, there is a promising use of recombinant proteins to improve on the trypanosome lysate to detect antibodies. In this respect, we have identified a stage-specific gene that is relatively highly expressed in metacyclic and blood trypomastigotes of T. congolense. According to previously obtained differential protein expression data, the gene TcIL3000.0.38630 (1,236 bp) is by 8.5 times more expressed in metacyclic and blood trypomastigotes than in procyclic trypomastigotes and epimastigotes. The same stage specific expression pattern was shown in Western blot analysis. In addition, in confocal laser scanning microscopy the Tc38630 protein was present in the cytosol and on the cell surface of metacyclic and blood trypomastigotes. Through bioinformatics, the Tc38630 had N-terminal signal sequence, hydrophilic extracellular domain, single transmembrane alpha-helix and short cytoplasmic domain, which is characteristic of the Trypanosoma brucei invariant surface glycoprotein. However, unlike T. brucei invariant surface glycoprotein, the Tc38630 existed as a single copy gene with a probable allelic polymorphism at the Nar I restriction site. The recombinant Tc38630-based ELISA detected antibodies against Tc38630 as early as 7 days post infection in experimentally infected mouse model. Taken together, our results suggest that the Tc38630 is a novel potential diagnostic antigen of Animal African trypanosomosis.
