Signalling from membrane receptors through heterotrimeric G-proteins (G alpha and G beta gamma) to intracellular effectors is a highly regulated process. Receptor activation causes exchange of GTP for GDP on G alpha and dissociation of G alpha from G beta gamma. Both subunits remain membrane-associated and interact with a series of other molecules throughout the cycle of activation. The N-terminal binding domain of G alpha subunits interacts with the membrane by several partially defined mechanisms: the anchoring of G alpha to the more hydrophobic G beta gamma subunits, the interaction of N-terminal lipids (palmitate and/or myristate) with the membrane, and attachment of amino acid regions to the membrane {amino acids 11-14 of Go alpha (D[11-14]); Busconi, Boutin and Denker (1997) Biochem. J. 323, 239-244}. We characterized N-terminal mutants of Go alpha with known G beta gamma-binding properties for the ability to interact with phospholipid vesicles and membranes prepared from cultured cells (acceptor membranes). In vitro analysis allows membrane interactions that are important to the activated and depalmitoylated state of G alpha to be characterized. Subcellular localization was also determined in transiently transfected COS cells. All of the mutant proteins are myristoylated, and differences in myristoylation do not account for changes in membrane binding. Disrupting the N-terminal alpha-helix of Go alpha with a proline point mutation at Arg-9 (R9P) does not affect interactions with G beta gamma on sucrose-density gradients but significantly reduces acceptor membrane binding. Deletion of amino acids 6-15 (D[6-15]; reduced G beta gamma binding) or deletion of amino acids 3-21 (D[3-21]); no detectable G beta gamma binding) further reduces acceptor membrane binding. When expressed in COS cells, R9P and D[6-15] are localized in the membrane similar to wild-type Go alpha as a result of the contribution from palmitoylation. In contrast, D[3-21] is completely soluble in COS cells, and no palmitoylation is detected. The binding of Go alpha and mutants translated in vitro to liposomes indicates that Go alpha preferentially binds to neutral phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine). R9P and D[11-14] bind to phosphatidylcholine liposomes like Go alpha, but D[6-15] exhibits no detectable binding. Taken together, these studies suggest that interactions of the N-terminus of G alpha subunits with the membrane may be affected by both membrane proteins and lipids. A detailed understanding of G alpha-membrane interactions may reveal unique mechanisms for regulating signal transduction.
