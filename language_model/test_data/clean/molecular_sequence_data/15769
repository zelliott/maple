Following a protracted carrier state in the infected cell, filamentous bacteriophage Cf16-v1 neolysogenizes Xanthomonas campestris pv. citri by inserting the phage genome into the host chromosome. The integration region in the phage and the host chromosome, respectively, and the two junctions in the lysogen chromosome were isolated and their nucleotide sequence was determined. The phage and host attachment sites shared an identical 15-bp "core," 5'-TATACATTATGCGAA-3'. Located on either side of each core were two unique arm sequences. Each of the two phage-host junctions contained an intact core flanked by a hybrid combination of phage and host arm sequences. A 10-bp symmetrical sequence arranged as inverted repeats with 1-bp spacing straddled the core sequence. A 10-bp repeated sequence, 5'-GCGCTATGGC-3', was found distal to the core in opposite orientation at the phage attachment site, while an abbreviated form of this sequence was present in the host attachment site. These sequence characteristics indicate that neolysogenic insertion of Cf16-v1 was accomplished by a site-specific recombination mechanism similar to lambda integration. However, in contrast to lambda, the phage and the host attachment sites in the Cf16-v1 system contained a high G + C nucleotide bias (except for the core sequence itself).
