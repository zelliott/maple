Two culture collection strains, CCM 168 and CCM 1405, previously assigned to the genus Micrococcus were shown by molecular chemical characterization to belong to the genus Salinicoccus. A more detailed comparison of the physiological and biochemical properties of these strains and comparison with the type strain of Salinicoccus roseus indicated high degrees of relatedness among the three strains. DNA-DNA hybridization studies confirmed the high degrees of relatedness. All of the data demonstrate quite clearly that strains CCM 168 and CCM 1405 are members of the species S. roseus.
