A 'big' frog (Rana esculenta) neurophysin, encompassing sequences homologous to mammalian MSEL-neurophysin and copeptin, has been passed through a trypsin-Sepharose column in order to compare its conformation with that of the two-domain intermediate precursor isolated from guinea pig. Whereas the polypeptide possesses 8 arginine residues, only two cleavages were observed located in a putative inter-domain sequence (at Arg-94 and Arg-114). Because free vasotocin has been isolated from the frog, it is assumed that pro-vasotocin has a three-domain conformation similar to that of pro-vasopressin but processing in amphibians involves only one step rather than two steps as in mammals.
