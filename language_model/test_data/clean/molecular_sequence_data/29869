All of the 181 possible overlapping hexapeptides as well as 179 octapeptides covering the amino acid sequence of human dihydrofolate reductase (hDHFR) were synthesized on polyethylene supports. The synthetic procedure of Geysen et al. (Geysen, H. M., Rodda, S. J., Mason, T. J., Tribbick, G., and Schoofs, P. G. (1987) J. Immunol. Methods 102, 259-274) was modified to obtain up to 100 nmol of peptide on each pin. Peptides constituting antigenic epitopes on hDHFR were identified by examining the binding of antibodies raised against both native and denatured hDHFR to these peptides by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The peptides bound in a similar pattern to polyclonal antibodies against both native and denatured dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Six major epitopes were located corresponding to residues 27-33, 45-51, 67-74, 133-139, 153-158, and 176-181 using both hexapeptides and octapeptides. An additional epitope, constituting residues 14-21, was found by the use of octapeptides. Most of the epitopes are hydrophilic and reside largely in "loop" regions at the boundaries of secondary structural elements of hDHFR. This observation is consistent with our previous results which suggested that ligand binding at the active site of the enzyme can cause a dramatic reduction in antibody binding to DHFR due to conformational constraints in flexible loop regions in various parts of the molecule. The similarity of the immunogenic profiles of native versus denatured hDHFR indicates that the two forms of the antigen share the same amino acid sequence-specific epitopes. Competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the binding of anti-hDHFR antiserum to both native and denatured hDHFR was inhibited by approximately 30% by the seven antigenic peptides, indicating that a significant proportion of the antibodies elicited by this enzyme is specific for short peptides. Besides revealing the antigenic structure of DHFR our results provide a rational basis for the design of mutant DHFRs to study the importance of loop residues in the conformational dynamics of the enzyme.
