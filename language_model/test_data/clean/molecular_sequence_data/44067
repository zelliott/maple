We report the identification and characterization of ERS-24 (Endoplasmic Reticulum SNARE of 24 kD), a new mammalian v-SNARE implicated in vesicular transport between the ER and the Golgi. ERS24 is incorporated into 20S docking and fusion particles and disassembles from this complex in an ATP-dependent manner. ERS-24 has significant sequence homology to Sec22p, a v-SNARE in Saccharomyces cerevisiae required for transport between the ER and the Golgi. ERS-24 is localized to the ER and to the Golgi, and it is enriched in transport vesicles associated with these organelles.
