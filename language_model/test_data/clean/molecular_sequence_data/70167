A computer evaluation of 13C-NMR data for the title polysaccharides based on the monosaccharide and methylation analysis data led to the structure of the repeating unit of the O1A polysaccharide as well as to several probable structures of the O1C polysaccharide, of which the correct one was inferred by means of a single NOE experiment. The analysis of the spectrum of the O1B polysaccharide was unsuccessful, due to the presence in its structure of the fragment alpha-L-Rha-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Gal-(1-->3)-D-GlcNAc with the terminal (1-->2)-linkage, whose spectral data could not be calculated by additive schemes using only glycosylation effects. However in reevaluation of the O1B spectral data by taking into account the deviations from additivities of the chemical shifts values in spectra of the related trisaccharides, to reveal the most probable structure of the O1B's repeating unit.
