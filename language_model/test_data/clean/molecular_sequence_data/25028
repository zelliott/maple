Casitone added to chemically defined medium (CDM) specifically influenced the regulation of the proteinase activity in the natural isolate Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis BGIS29. Comparative analysis of the influence of casitone present in CDM on the proteolytic activity of strain BGIS29 and of L. lactis subsp. cremoris strains SK11 and Wg2 indicated that the proteolytic activity of strains BGIS29 and SK11 is casitone-dependent, whereas that of strain Wg2 is not. The regulatory region of the prt genes of strain BGIS29 was cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the prt regulatory region of strain BGIS29 was distinctly different from that of L. lactis subsp. cremoris strains SK11 and Wg2. Transcriptional gene fusions with the Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase gene ( gusA) were used to study medium-dependent expression of two divergent prtP and prtM promoters of strain BGIS29 (designated P (prtP) and P (prtM), respectively). beta-Glucuronidase assays and Northern blot analysis showed that the activities of P (prtP) and P (prtM) are controlled by casitone at the transcriptional level.
