SRY, a putative transcription factor encoded by the sex-determining region of the human Y chromosome, regulates a genetic switch in male development. Impairment of this switch leads to intersex abnormalities of the newborn and is observed in association with mutations in the SRY DNA-binding domain [the high-mobility-group (HMG) box]. Here we show that the SRY HMG box exhibits a novel mechanism of DNA recognition: partial intercalation of a nonpolar side chain in the DNA minor groove. Base stacking (but not base pairing) is interrupted at the site of insertion. Sequence specificity reflects topological requirements of partial intercalation rather than direct readout of base-specific functional groups. Our results predict that the SRY HMG box inserts an alpha-helix into a widened minor groove at the center of a sharp DNA bend. A similar mechanism may underlie binding of SRY and homologous HMG proteins to four-way junctions (Holliday intermediates) and other noncanonical DNA structures.
