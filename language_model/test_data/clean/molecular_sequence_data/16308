The HinfI restriction and modification genes were cloned on a 3.9-kb PstI fragment inserted into the PstI site of plasmid pBR322. Both genes are confined to an internal 2.3-kb BclI-AvaI subfragment. This subfragment was sequenced. Two large open reading frames (ORF's) are present. ORF1 codes for the methylase [predicted 359 amino acids (aa)] and ORF2 codes for the endonuclease (predicted 262 or 272 aa).
