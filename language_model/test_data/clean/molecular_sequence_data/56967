Individuals with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are generally divided into asymptomatic healthy carriers and patients with chronic liver disease. Several studies have suggested that the core antigen (HBcAg) could be an immunological target of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). To investigate the possible pressure site from CTL, the entire core region of HBV DNA was sequenced in 30 subjects (10 asymptomatic healthy carriers and 20 patients with chronic liver disease). No significant changes in the nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid residue were noted in the 10 healthy carriers. In contrast, a cluster of changes in small segment of 18 amino acids (codon 84 to 101 from the start of the core gene) was found in 15 of the 20 chronic liver disease patients. All these 15 patients had advanced liver diseases (chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis), whereas only mild liver disease (chronic persistent hepatitis) was found in the 5 patients without mutation. These data suggest that this region with clustering mutations may play an important role in the pathogenesis of B viral liver disease, and the mutations in the region may be related to progressive liver disease.
