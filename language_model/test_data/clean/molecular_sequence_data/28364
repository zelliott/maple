The objective of this study was to identify and characterize the gene encoding a protein of approximately 12 kDa that is secreted from cells infected with the vaccinia virus. The absence of this protein from the medium of cells infected with a spontaneous deletion mutant (6/2) suggested that the open reading frame (ORF) was located within a 12,800-base pair segment near the left end of the genome (G. Kotwal and B. Moss, Nature (London) 335, 176-178, 1988). Antibody to the 12-kDa protein immunoprecipitated an appropriate size in vitro translation product of mRNA that hybridized to a DNA segment containing an ORF (N1L) that could encode a 13.8-kDa polypeptide. The similarity in the sizes of the in vitro translation product and the secreted protein was consistent with the absence of processing. Transcriptional analysis revealed major and minor early RNA start sites preceding the N1L ORF as well as a late RNA start site with an atypical TAAAAT sequence. The N1L gene was interrupted by replacing a segment of the ORF with the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene. When two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic patterns of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins secreted from cells infected with parental and recombinant viruses were compared, a spot missing from the latter corresponded in molecular weigh and isoelectric point with that predicted from the N1L ORF. The latter analysis revealed the presence of other secreted proteins of similar molecular weight but different isoelectric points that also appear to map within the left end of the vaccinia genome. The recombinant virus was attenuated as judged by the increased intracranial LD50 for mice but nevertheless induced antibody and cytotoxic responses after intradermal and intraperitoneal injections. Relative to the parental virus, the recombinant was also more attenuated for immunodeficient nude mice, based on their survival time after infection.
