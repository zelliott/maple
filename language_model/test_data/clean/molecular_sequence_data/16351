In order to examine the number and organization of the immunoglobulin lambda light chain genes of the rat, we have used mouse lambda chain cDNA probes to isolate hybridizing fragments from a partial EcoRI rat liver DNA library. We have determined the partial nucleotide sequence of two such clones. One clone, containing a 5.8 kb EcoRI insert which hybridizes to both mouse C lambda 1 and C lambda 2 probes, includes an apparently expressible C lambda 2-like gene as well as a C lambda 1-like pseudogene (psi C lambda 1.1), arranged similarly to the mouse C lambda gene complexes. Sequence analysis of a second cloned EcoRI fragment (1.15 kb in length) revealed part of a second C lambda 1-like pseudogene (psi C lambda 1.2), the coding regions of both pseudogenes being interrupted by multiple frame-shifting size differences. In the case of psi C lambda 1.2, the degree of sequence identity with mouse C lambda 1 drops abruptly immediately following the termination codon, suggesting that translocation events have played a role in its generation. These two rat pseudogenes, and the mouse C lambda 4 pseudogene, clearly have been rendered unexpressible by separate evolutionary events. Comparisons between C lambda coding and non-coding regions of rats and mice indicate that some of the unusual patterns of divergence we have observed in recently diverged Ck genes may exist in C lambda genes as well.
