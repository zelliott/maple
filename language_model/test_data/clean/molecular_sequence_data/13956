A recombinant baculovirus, the genome of which contains DNA encoding Marek's disease virus serotype 1 (MDV1) homolog of glycoprotein D (gD) of herpes simplex virus under the polyhedrin promoter was constructed and designated rAcMDV1gD. Five monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) which recognize the MDV1 homolog of gD (MDV1 gD) in Spodoptera frugiperda cells infected with rAcMDV1gD were prepared. The MAbs reacted with proteins ranging from 52 to 49 kDa in rAcMDV1gD-infected cell lysates by immunoblot analysis. These molecular weights were coincident with molecular weights predicted from the open reading frame of MDV1 gD. By ELISA additivity test, the 5 MAbs were divided into 3 groups which seemed to recognize 3 different epitopes. In addition, all of the 5 MAbs were reactive with chick embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) expressing MDV1 gD. The MAbs are considered to be useful to study the role of MDV1 gD in MDV1 infection.
