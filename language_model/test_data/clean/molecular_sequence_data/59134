4 patients of two families with congenital persistent hyperthyroidism without detectable autoantibodies are reported. The members of the first family affected by hyperthyroidism, i.e. the mother and her two children, showed a germline mutation, a transition of GCC to GTC in the genomic DNA of the TSH receptor, leading to an exchange of alanine by valine at the position 623. The mother was thyroidectomized at two times because of recurrent nodular goiter. The third child of a healthy second family showed a transition of AGC to AAC leading to an exchange of serine by asparagine at the position 505 of the TSH receptor. The mutation of family 1, as a somatic point mutation leading to autonomous thyroid adenoma, has originally been demonstrated to constitutively activate TSH independent cAMP accumulation. The functional tests of the TSH receptor gen mutation, detected in family 2, are ongoing, but an exchange of serine by arginine at the same position has been shown to lead to constitutively active cAMP accumulation. The cases of congenital hyperthyroidism in the first family lead to a reduction of the birth weight and head circumference and to a neonatal but not fetal tachycardia. Bone age of both children was accelerated by one year. In contrast to that, congenital hyperthyroidism of the second family lead to more marked signs of intrauterine hyperthyroidism. The mother observed marked symptoms of fetal and neonatal hyperthyroidism. The bone age at a chronological age of 6 months was 4-6 years and the neonate showed a mild exophthalmus. We conclude, that congenital hyperthyroidism due to constitutively activating TSH receptor mutations has to be considered, if hyperthyroidism is not transient but persistent, and the parameters of autoimmunity are absent. Constitutively active TSH receptor germline mutations lead to different degrees of congenital hyperthyroidism. In contrast to patients with Graves' disease, more aggressive means of treatment like total thyroidectomy and/or radiation seem to be recommendable in cases with severe hyperthyroidism to control the disease.
