We have expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells a catalytically inactive form of human factor Xa (factor rXai). A recombinant precursor of human factor Xa was inactivated by two point mutations in the serine protease catalytic triad, Asp322Asn and Ser419Ala. A two-step purification to homogeneity of the secreted material involved immunoaffinity followed by heparin-agarose chromatography. Two forms were identified; a fully processed dimer (70%) and a partially processed monomer (30%). Limited N-terminal amino acid sequencing of factor rXai detected the predicted residues and gamma-carboxyglutamic acid content was 90% of human plasma control. Although devoid of measurable proteolytic activity, factor rXai competitively inhibited plasma factor Xa assembly into functional prothrombinase complexes (Ki = 3 x 10(-10) M). Factor rXai also inhibited plasma clotting in a dose-dependent manner. The possible use of recombinant catalytically inactive proteins as a general approach for pharmacological regulation of human diseases is discussed.
