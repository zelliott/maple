A gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was sequenced that encodes a protein with homology to a family of putative ATPases. These homologous proteins include the yeast cell division cycle protein Cdc48p and its mammalian homologues VCP and p97; Sec18p and its mammalian homologue NSF, proteins necessary for fusion of transport vesicles to target membranes in the secretory pathway; Pas1p, a protein necessary for peroxisome biosynthesis in yeast; Yme1p, a yeast mitochondrial protein that influences the rate of DNA escape from mitochondria; and TBP-1, MSS1 and Sug1p, proteins that interact with transcription factors. This newly sequenced gene, named AFG2 for ATPase family gene, is located on chromosome XII 5' to the SLP1/VPS33 open reading frame and encodes an essential protein of 780 amino acids that is most homologous to Cdc48p.
