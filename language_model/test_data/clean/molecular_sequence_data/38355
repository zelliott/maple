pCMV-NL(Deltapol) and pAKV-NL(Deltapol) expressed human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gag and env under the regulation of the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early (IE) promoter/enhancer and the endogenous AKV murine leukemia viral long terminal repeat (LTR), respectively. Analysis of the immune responses elicited by direct DNA injection of pCMV-NL(Deltapol) and pAKV-NL(Deltapol) in macaques indicated that generation of the humoral and T-cell proliferative responses correlated directly with the promoter strength of the vaccine DNAs. In Macaca mulatta, pCMV-NL(Deltapol) generated stronger humoral responses and T-cell proliferative responses to Gag and Env using less DNA and fewer number of injections than pAKV-NL(Deltapol). Similarly, in Macaca nemestrina pCMV-NL(Deltapol) elicited high humoral responses, which persisted long-term and were boostable. Injection of large amounts of pAKV-NL(Deltapol), in general, failed to produce antibody levels comparable to pCMV-NL(Deltapol). However, injection of a control animal with large amounts of vector DNA produced a generalized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reactivity to HIV-1. The results indicated that generation of high immune responses to HIV-1 cannot be achieved by increasing the vaccine DNA dose and may require high protein expression from the DNA by including a strong promoter or by the use of other boosting agents. Furthermore, safety concerns may arise with increasing the DNA dose that could need additional investigation.
