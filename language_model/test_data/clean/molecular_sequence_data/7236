We describe the construction of an attenuated Salmonella dublin aroA strain which secretes via the Escherichia coli hemolysin secretion machinery an active hybrid cytolysin consisting of listeriolysin from Listeria monocytogenes and the C-terminal secretion signal of E. coli hemolysin. This hemolytic S. dublin strain is partially released into the cytoplasm of the host cell following uptake by J774 macrophage cells, whereas the nonhemolytic control S. dublin aroA strain remains in the phagosome.
