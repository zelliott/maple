Tinea capitis due to Trichophyton tonsurans is currently epidemic among Japanese Judo practitioners. T. tonsurans has seven genotypes in a variable internal repeat (VIR) region of the rRNA gene. All 101 isolates obtained from Japanese Judo practitioners had the identical genotype. This suggests that a specific genotype strain occurs throughout Japan.
