The aim was to investigate the roles of proline residues in extracellular loop 2 (P172, P183, P188 and P209) and transmembrane domains 2, 5, 11 and 12 (P108, P270, P526, P551, P552 and P570) in determining noradrenaline transporter (NET) expression and function. Mutants of human NET with these residues mutated to alanine were pharmacologically characterized. Mutation of P108, P270 and P526 disrupted cell surface expression, from [3H]nisoxetine binding and confocal microscopy data. Mutations of P526, P551 and P570 reduced transporter turnover (Vmax of [3H]noradrenaline uptake/Bmax of [3H]nisoxetine binding) by 1.5-1.7-fold compared with wild-type NET, so these residues might be involved in conformational changes associated with substrate translocation. Conversely, mutations of P172, P183, P188 and P209 increased Vmax/Bmax by 2-3-fold compared with wild-type, indicating that the presence of these proline residues limits turnover of the NET. The mutations had few effects on apparent affinities of substrates or affinities of inhibitors, except decreases in inhibitor affinities after mutations of the P270 and P570 residues, and increases after mutation of the P526 residue. Hence, proline residues in extracellular loop 2 and in transmembrane domains have a range of roles in determining expression and function of the NET.
