There is now evidence for the existence of two somatostatin genes in most vertebrate species, and even three somatostatin genes in teleosts. To help clarify the evolutionary relationships between the different somatostatin isoforms currently known, we characterized the somatostatin loci in a teleost species, the zebrafish Danio rerio, and compared them with the corresponding regions in the human and pufferfish genomes. The occurrence of three somatostatin genes, termed SS1, SS2 and SSII, has been previously demonstrated in the zebrafish. Radiation hybrid mapping assigned these three genes to linkage groups 15, 23 and 2, respectively. Conserved synteny of the zebrafish SS2 gene and the human cortistatin gene was revealed by comparative genomic analysis, indicating that mammalian cortistatin is orthologous to the SS2 variant of non-mammalian species. In contrast, using a similar approach, it was not possible to identify the evolutionary relationships between the atypical SSII gene of zebrafish and the other teleost SSII genes.
