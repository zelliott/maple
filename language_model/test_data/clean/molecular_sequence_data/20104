The IL-2Ralpha chain (CD25, Tac) is an essential component of high affinity IL-2Rs, playing critical role for the immune specificity of antigen-activated T-cell clonal expansion. Up to now, no duck cytokine receptor has been described. Here, the cDNA segment of a duck cytokine receptor (duCD25), encoding a 226 aa precursor protein with a 20 aa signal peptide, was isolated. Then a novel mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) was generated using the prokaryotically expressed duCD25 protein as immunogen. Using this mAb, the endogenous duCD25 molecule was localized on the surface of duck lymphocytes, and the duck IL-2-induced lymphocyte proliferation was further inhibited. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis showed that duCD25 positive cells were upregulated in ducks infected with avian influenza virus (H9N2). Our findings confirm that duCD25 is a receptor of duck interleukin-2, and duCD25 positive cells play a potential role in H9N2 virus infection.
