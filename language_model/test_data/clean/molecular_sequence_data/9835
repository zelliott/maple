Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens bind peptides of diverse sequences with high affinity. They do this in order to generate maximal immunological protection by covering the spectrum of peptides that may be seen by a host over the course of its lifetime. However, in many circumstances the immune system does not recognize a particular peptide that it should for maximum advantage over the pathogen. In other situations, the immune system goes awry and incorrectly recognizes a self-peptide that it should not. This results in disease characterized by recognition and attack of self. Rheumatoid arthritis is an example of just such a disease. In either of these situations, peptide-based modalities for immune therapy would be an advantage. However, peptide-based therapies require a thorough understanding of the forces involved in peptide binding. Great strides have been made in elucidating the mechanisms by which these MHC proteins may bind peptides with diverse sequences and high affinity. This review summarizes the current data obtained from crystallographic analyses of peptide binding for both class I and class II MHC molecules. Unfortunately, as yet these data have not allowed us to predict which peptides will bind with high affinity to a specific MHC molecule.
