In search of proteins which interact with activated steroid hormone receptors, we screened a human liver lambda gt11 expression library with the glucocorticoid receptor. We identified and cloned a cDNA sequence of 1322 bp that encodes a protein of 274 aa. This protein consists predominantly of hydrophilic amino acids and contains a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal. The in vitro translated receptor-associating protein runs in SDS/polyacrylamide gels with an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa. By use of the bacterially expressed fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase we have found that interaction is not limited to the glucocorticoid receptor but included other nuclear receptors--most notably, the estrogen and thyroid receptors. Binding also occurs with the glucocorticoid receptor complexed with the antiglucocorticoid RU 38486, with the estrogen receptor complexed with the antiestrogen 4-hydroxytamoxifen or ICI 164,384, and even with receptors not complexed with ligand. Association with steroid hormone receptors depends on prior receptor activation--i.e., release from heat shock proteins. The sequence identified here appears to be a general partner protein for nuclear hormone receptors, with the gene being expressed in a variety of mammalian tissues.
