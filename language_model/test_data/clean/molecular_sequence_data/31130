A cDNA encoding one isoform (PP1 alpha) of the catalytic subunit of human protein phosphatase 1 has been isolated and used to map the human PP1 alpha gene (PPP1A) to chromosome band 11q13 by analysis of somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization. Neoplasms that map to 11q13 are discussed in the light of the recent findings that PP1 alpha is a putative tumor suppressor and that it plays a key role in the control of mitosis.
