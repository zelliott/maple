A soluble 65582.9 Da (in MALDI-TOF) angiotensin converting (ACE)-like enzyme has been purified by a captopril-Sepharose affinity column chromatography from the mollusk Mytilus edulis. This glycosylated peptidyl dipeptidase, with an N-terminal sequence of LDPELSPGCFVANQAGGQLF, hydrolyses the Phe8-His9 bond (at pH 8.4 and 37 degrees C) of angiotensin I with a high catalytic activity i.e. Km: 168 microM and Kcat/Km: 262 s-1 mM-1. The hydrolysis of angiotensin I is inhibited by the specific ACE inhibitors captopril and lisonopril (Ic50 = 50 nM). This activity is increased by Cl- (optimal Cl- concentration 400 mM) and by Zn2+. This zinc metallopeptidase also attacks peptides having a Gly-His, Gly-Phe or a Phe-His bond in their sequence e.g. leucine-enkephalin (Kcat/Km: 1200 s-1 mM-1 or bradykinin (Kcat/Km: 2500 s-1 mM-1). Mytilus ACE displays properties of the C-domain of human ACE, indicating a high degree of conservation during evolution. These results are consistent with an ACE activity implicated in metabolism of several neuropeptides in mollusks.
