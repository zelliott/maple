In this work, we approach the impact of dynamic and static disorder on DNA charge transfer from a theoretical and numerical perspective. Disordered or defect geometries are either realized via molecular dynamics simulations using a classical force field or by experimentally determined DNA bulge structures. We apply a chemically specific, atomically resolved extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model to compute the energy parameters relevant to DNA charge transfer. For both models studied here, the effective donor-acceptor couplings--and hence the charge transfer rates--significantly depend upon the geometry. Dynamic disorder leads to a correlation time in this quantity of the order of 30 fs, and the transfer rates universally exhibit a broad, yet well-defined, exponential distribution. For DNA bulges, the angle characterizing the defect controls the charge transfer efficiency. The results are discussed and extensively compared to experimental findings and other calculations.
