We have isolated two genomic clones which together encode the Ca2+-ATPase of rabbit fast-twitch skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. One of the two 16.5 kilobase (kb) genomic inserts in the lambda phage vector Charon 4A contains 23 exons extending from the polyadenylation site at the 3' end of the ATPase gene to within 38 nucleotides of the translation initiation codon in the 5' exon. An overlapping genomic insert of 16.5 kb contains the remainder of the 5' exon and a further 8 kb of upstream sequence. S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension analysis of the 5' end of the Ca2+-ATPase mRNA indicate that the transcription initiation site is located 185 base pairs (bp) upstream of the translation initiation codon. A "TATA" box (CA-TAAA) was found at position -30 and the sequence CCAAT was found at position -78 relative to the transcription initiation site. In a previous study (Brandl, C. J., de Leon, S., Martin, D. R., and MacLennan, D. H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 3768-3774) cDNAs for neonatal and adult forms of the fast-twitch Ca2+-ATPase were shown to encode different carboxyl-terminal sequences, presumably as a result of alternative splicing. We have now found that these different DNA sequences encoding different carboxyl-terminal sequences are located in different exons. Exon boundaries of the Ca2+-ATPase gene did not correlate well with proposed domain boundaries for the Ca2+-ATPase protein. The locations of exon/intron boundaries were only partially conserved between the Ca2+-ATPase gene and a Na+/K+-ATPase gene (Ovchinnikov, Y. A., Monastyrskaya, G. S., Broude, N. E., Allikmets, R. L., Ushkaryov, Y. A., Melkov, A. M., Smirnov, Y. V., Malyshev, I. V., Dulubova, I. E., Petrukhin, K. E., Gryshin, A. V., Sverdlov, V. E., Kiyatkin, N. I., Kostina, M. B., Modyanov, N. N., and Sverdlov, E. D. (1987) FEBS Lett. 213, 73-80) and they did not follow closely the boundaries of amino acid sequences that are highly conserved among a group of ion transport ATPases.
