The I-superfamily of Conus peptides represents a new class of peptides with four disulfide bridges (-C-C-CC-CC-C-C-) that falls into three (I1, I2 and I3) categories according to the different signal peptide sequences. The I-superfamily has received increasing attention because it targets K+ ion channels, a function that is relatively rare in conotoxins. Herein we report 11 novel I-superfamily conotoxins from the venom ducts of five Cone snails (Conus eburneus, Conus imperialis, Conus vitulinus, Conus emaciatus and Conus litteratus) native to the South China Sea using a primer designed according to the N-terminus of the signal sequence of I2-superfamily conotoxins. The alignment of sequences revealed that signal regions exhibited moderate conservation with the exception of Eb11.3 from C. eburneus with homologies of 21.1%, 38.5% and 30.0% to the signal peptides of I1, I2 and I3 superfamily conotoxins, respectively. The mature peptides ranged from almost identical to highly divergent between species. Analyses of the evolutionary trees of these peptides with those of reported I-superfamily conotoxins showed that nine of them fall in I2 superfamily clades, but two of them were neither I1- and I2- nor I3-superfamily clades. Notably, some peptides exhibited significantly different amino acid residues in the intercysteine loops compared with group A, B and C of I-superfamily conopeptides, suggesting that they may have different bioactivities and functions.
