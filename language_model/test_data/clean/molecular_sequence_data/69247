Using a back translated oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe, encoding a conserved motif in insect antibacterial peptides, we have isolated two cDNA clones from the medfly, Ceratitis capitata. Sequence determination shows that the cDNAs encode two closely related peptides which are members of the cecropin family.
