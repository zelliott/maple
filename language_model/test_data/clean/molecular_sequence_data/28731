A novel alkaliphilic Nocardiopsis sp., strain TOA-1, was isolated from a tile-joint of a bathroom. Strain TOA-1 produced a variety of alkaline hydrolytic enzymes. An alkaline protease, designated NAPase, was purified and characterized. NAPase had a very high keratinolytic activity and high stability under acidic conditions.
