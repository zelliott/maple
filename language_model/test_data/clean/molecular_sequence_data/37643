The Arabidopsis abscisic acid (ABA)-insensitive abi5 mutants have pleiotropic defects in ABA response, including decreased sensitivity to ABA inhibition of germination and altered expression of some ABA-regulated genes. We isolated the ABI5 gene by using a positional cloning approach and found that it encodes a member of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family. The previously characterized abi5-1 allele encodes a protein that lacks the DNA binding and dimerization domains required for ABI5 function. Analyses of ABI5 expression provide evidence for ABA regulation, cross-regulation by other ABI genes, and possibly autoregulation. Comparison of seed and ABA-inducible vegetative gene expression in wild-type and abi5-1 plants indicates that ABI5 regulates a subset of late embryogenesis-abundant genes during both developmental stages.
