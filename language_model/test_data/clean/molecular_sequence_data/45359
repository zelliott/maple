A novel anaerobic, moderately thermophilic, spore-forming bacterium, designated strain BRT, was isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal core samples collected at the Rainbow vent field on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (36 degrees 14' N 33 degrees 54' W). The cells were found to be rod-shaped, non-motile, Gram-positive and spore-forming. The organism grew in the temperature range 37-60 degrees C, with an optimum at 55 degrees C, and at pH values in the range 6-8.5, with an optimum around pH 7. NaCl concentrations for growth were in the range 10-40 g l(-1), with an optimum at 20-30 g l(-1). Strain BRT grew chemo-organoheterotrophically with carbohydrates, proteinaceous substrates and organic acids with nitrate as electron acceptor. The novel isolate was not able to ferment. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 34.5 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence placed strain BRT in the Bacillaceae within the class 'Bacilli'. On the basis of the phenotypic and phylogenetic data, this isolate should be described as a member of a novel genus, for which the name Vulcanibacillus gen. nov. is proposed. The type species is Vulcanibacillus modesticaldus sp. nov., with the type strain BRT (=DSM 14931T=JCM 12998T).
