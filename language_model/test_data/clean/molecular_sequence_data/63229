This study isolated nine strains of aerobic phenol-degrading granules. These isolates (I1-I9) were characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, with gamma-Proteobacteria as the dominant strains in the aerobic granules. While most strains demonstrated either high phenol-degrading capabilities or auto-aggregation capabilities, three isolates, I2, I6, and I8 showed both features. These findings contradict the previous view that auto-aggregation and phenol degradation are mutually exclusive in aerobic granules. Strains I2 and I8 independently formed single-culture aerobic granules except for I3. Anti-microbial activity test results indicated that strains I2 and I8 inhibited growth of strain I3. However, co-culturing I3 with I2 or I8 helped to form granules.
