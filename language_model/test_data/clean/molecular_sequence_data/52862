Fibrillarin is a nucleolar protein known to be involved in the processing of ribosomal RNA precursors. We isolated AtFbr1, a cDNA encoding a homolog of fibrillarin in Arabidopsis. The cDNA is 1.2 kb in size and encodes a polypeptide of 310 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 33 kD. AtFbr1 is expressed at high levels in the flower and root tissue and at a slightly lower level in leaf tissue, whereas it was nearly undetectable in siliques. Expression of AtFbr1 was compared with that of the FLP (fibrillarin-like protein) gene identified by the Arabidopsis genome project. Abscisic acid treatment resulted in the down-regulation of the expression of both AtFbr1 and FLP genes in seedlings, although the degree of suppression was higher for FLP than for AtFbr1. In addition, the expression level of FLP decreased with the age of the seedlings, whereas AtFbr1 did not exhibit any detectable change. The subcellular localization of AtFbrl was studied with an in vivo targeting approach using a fusion protein, and was found to be correctly targeted to the nucleolus in protoplasts when expressed as a green fluorescent fusion protein (GFP). Deletion experiments showed that the N-terminal glycine- and arginine-rich region is necessary and sufficient to target AtFbr1 to the nucleolus.
