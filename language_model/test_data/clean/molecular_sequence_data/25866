Using a probe derived from the human 5-HT1A receptor gene (G-21), a strongly hybridizable clone was identified from a rat genomic DNA library. This clone (G21Y2) had an overall deduced amino acid sequence that was 88% homologous with that of the human 5-HT1A receptor. There was only an 18% and 19% amino acid homology with the rat 5-HT1C and 5-HT2 receptors, respectively. The G21Y2 appears to be an excellent candidate for the rat 5-HT1A receptor gene. As this manuscript was being prepared a report by Albert et al. (13) was published in which a probe to the hamster beta 2-adrenergic receptor was used to identify a rat genomic (Clone D) that demonstrated a sequence that was similar to G21Y2.
