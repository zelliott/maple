Most viral glycoproteins mediating membrane fusion adopt a metastable native conformation and undergo major conformational changes during fusion. We previously described a panel of compounds that specifically prevent fusion induced by measles virus (MV), most likely by interfering with conformational rearrangements of the MV fusion (F) protein. To further elucidate the basis of inhibition and better understand the mechanism of MV glycoprotein-mediated fusion, we generated and characterized resistant MV variants. Spontaneous mutations conferring drug resistance were confirmed in transient assays and in the context of recombinant virions and were in all cases located in the fusion protein. Several mutations emerged independently at F position 462, which is located in the C-terminal heptad repeat (HR-B) domain. In peptide competition assays, all HR-B mutants at residue 462 revealed reduced affinity for binding to the HR-A core complex compared to unmodified HR-B. Combining mutations at residue 462 with mutations in the distal F head region, which we had previously identified as mediating drug resistance, causes intracellular retention of the mutant proteins. The transport competence and activity of the mutants can be restored, however, by incubation at reduced temperature or in the presence of the inhibitory compounds, indicating that the F escape mutants have a reduced conformational stability and that the inhibitors stabilize a transport-competent conformation of the F trimer. The data support the conclusion that residues located in the head domain of the F trimer and the HR-B region contribute jointly to controlling F conformational stability.
