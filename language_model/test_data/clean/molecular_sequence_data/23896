Dihydroorotase (DHOase) catalyzes the reversible condensation of carbamoyl aspartate to form dihydroorotate in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. The enzyme from Aquifex aeolicus, a hyperthermophilic organism of ancient lineage, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified protein was found to be a 45-kDa monomer containing a single zinc ion. Although there is no other DHOase gene in the A. aeolicus genome, the recombinant protein completely lacked catalytic activity at any temperature tested. However, DHOase formed an active complex with aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) from the same organism. Whereas the k(cat) of 13.8 +/- 0.03 s(-1) was close to the value observed for the mammalian enzyme, the K (m)for dihydroorotate, 3.03 +/- 0.05 mM was 433-fold higher. Gel filtration and chemical cross-linking showed that the complex exists as a 240-kDa hexamer (DHO(3)-ATC(3)) and a 480-kDa duodecamer (DHO(6)-ATC(6)) probably in rapid equilibrium. Complex formation protects both DHOase and ATCase against thermal degradation at temperatures near 100 degrees C where the organism grows optimally. These results lead to the reclassification of both enzymes: ATCase, previously considered a Class C homotrimer, now falls into Class A, whereas the DHOase is a Class 1B enzyme. CD spectroscopy indicated that association with ATCase does not involve a significant perturbation of the DHOase secondary structure, but the visible absorption spectrum of a Co(2+)-substituted DHOase is appreciably altered upon complex formation suggesting a change in the electronic environment of the active site. The association of DHOase with ATCase probably serves as a molecular switch that ensures that free, uncomplexed DHOase in the cell remains inactive. At pH 7.4, the equilibrium ratio of carbamoyl aspartate to dihydroorotate is 17 and complex formation may drive the reaction in the biosynthetic direction.
