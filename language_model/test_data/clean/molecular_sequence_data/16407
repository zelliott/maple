This paper presents the complete sequencing and annotation of the pLAFR1 vector. pLAFR is a tetracycline-resistant "cosmid" cloning vector, which is derived from the 20 kb plasmid pRK290, a RK2-derivative. Due to its broad host range, the pLAFR1 vector has been widely used in the genetic analysis of a broad number of gram-negative bacterial species. The availability of the complete pLAFR1 sequence will most definitely help in the construction and analysis of clone librares based on pRK290 or pLAFR vectors.
