The development of a protective immune response in sheep towards the presence of the larval stage of Lucilia cuprina has not been reported in the field. Upon investigation of the effects of larval excretory/secretory material on ovine T lymphocyte proliferation, we isolated a 56 kDa protein capable of inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation by at least 70%, compared with that in the presence of mitogen alone. This protein inhibited proliferation induced through cross-linking of the T-cell receptor as well as proliferation induced pharmacologically through the stimulation of the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. The protein, named blowfly larval immunosuppressive protein (BLIP), was shown to bind directly to lymphocytes. Further investigation revealed that the BLIP prevented a proportion of lymphocytes from entering the first division following stimulation, by affecting the early events in lymphocyte activation. Subsequently, the BLIP reduced CD25 expression on T lymphocytes, reduced IL-2 mRNA expression, in addition to IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 mRNA expression. Conversely, TNF-alpha and TGF-beta gene expression was up-regulated in response to the BLIP. These effects suggest suboptimal activation of T lymphocytes in the presence of the BLIP, and we propose that the BLIP presents an effective immune evasion tactic for the larvae of L. cuprina.
