Transcription of rRNA genes (rDNAs) in the nucleolus is regulated by epigenetic chromatin modifications including histone H3 lysine (de)methylation. Here we show that LegAS4, a Legionella pneumophila type IV secretion system (TFSS) effector, is targeted to specific rDNA chromatin regions in the host nucleolus. LegAS4 promotes rDNA transcription, through its SET-domain (named after Drosophila Su(var)3-9, enhancer of zeste [E(z)], and trithorax [trx]) histone lysine methyltransferase (HKMTase) activity. LegAS4's association with rDNA chromatin is mediated by interaction with host HP1α/γ. L. pneumophila infection potently activates rDNA transcription in a TFSS-dependent manner. Other bacteria, including Bordetella bronchiseptica and Burkholderia thailandensis, also harbour nucleolus-localized LegAS4-like HKMTase effectors. The B. thailandensis type III effector BtSET promotes H3K4 methylation of rDNA chromatin, contributing to infection-induced rDNA transcription and bacterial intracellular replication. Thus, activation of host rDNA transcription might be a general bacterial virulence strategy.
