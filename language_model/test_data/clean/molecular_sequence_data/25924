Arginine thiobenzyl esters are convenient chromogenic substrates of factor VIIa (Z-Arg-SBzl, Kcat/KM = 1,600 M-1 s-1) and were used to study the kinetics of inhibition of factor VIIa by several mechanism-based isocoumarin inhibitors of trypsin-like enzymes. Isocoumarin derivatives substituted with a 7-guanidino or 3-isothiureidopropoxy group were good inhibitors of factor VIIa and acted as anticoagulants in human and rabbit plasma. With normal citrated human plasma, 4-chloro-3-ethoxy-7-guanidinoisocoumarin (3) and 7-amino-4-chloro-3-(3-isothiureidopropoxy) isocoumarin (ACITIC, 6) prolonged the prothrombin time (PT) ca. two-fold and prolonged the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) more than 4.5-fold at 20-30 microM. Both compounds had smaller effects in rabbit plasma. The short half-life of ACITIC and related isocoumarins in plasma should make these compounds uniquely useful as anticoagulants in therapeutic situations where it is desirable to have anticoagulant effects for a short defined time period.
