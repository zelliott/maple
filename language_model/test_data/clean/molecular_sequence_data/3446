Streptococcus sobrinus has four gtf genes, gtfI, gtfS, gtfT, and gtfU, on the chromosome. These genes correspond respectively to the enzymes GTF-I, GTF-S1, GTF-S2, and GTF-S3. An Escherichia coli MD66 clone that contained the S. sobrinus gtfU gene was characterized. Immunological properties showed that the protein produced by the E. coli MD66 clone was similar to S. sobrinus GTF-S1. Biological properties and a linkage analysis of the glucans by 13C NMR spectrometry revealed that the protein produced by the E. coli MD66 clone was GTF-S1.
