To identify mutations in the paired box 6 (PAX6) gene of 33 probands with aniridia and to reveal the mutational spectrum in the Chinese population.

Unrelated probands with aniridia from 27 newly selected families and six previously analyzed families participated in this study. The coding regions of PAX6 in the 27 new families were analyzed using cycle sequencing. Families that lacked detectable variations based on sequencing (14 new and six previously analyzed) were further analyzed using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).

Fifteen mutations were identified in 16 of the 33 families: c.[65_94del30; 99_105dup7], c.101_102insA, c.177delG, c.238_239insGCGA, c.1033-42_1033-26del17insG, c.1A>G, c.120C>A, c.718C>T, c.949C>T, c.1062C>A, c.1183G>A, c.1268A>T, and three gross deletions involving exons 1-14, exons 8-14, and exons 9-14. The first five mutations were novel and the c.1268A>T mutation was present in two families. Phenotypic variations were observed between families and between different affected patients within the families.

The PAX6 mutation spectrum in Chinese aniridia patients is comparable to that reported in other ethnic groups. Further studies of the 17 families with no detected mutations may provide additional information to improve the understanding of the molecular genetics of aniridia.
