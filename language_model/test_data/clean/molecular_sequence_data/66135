Hexa-, penta- and tetrasaccharide fragments related to the repeating unit of the exopolysaccharide secreted by Streptococcus macedonicus Sc 136 were synthesized in a very efficient manner involving minimum number of steps. A general glycosylation condition has been applied for all glycosylation steps and yields were excellent.
