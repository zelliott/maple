We mapped the canarypox virus (CaPV) thymidine kinase (TK) gene within a 5.8-kbp XbaI fragment of the genome by Southern blotting using the fowlpox virus (FPV) TK gene as a probe. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the fragment revealed seven open reading frames (ORFs) showing gene organization similar to that of FPV. The TK gene contained in this region had an ORF of 179 amino acids encoding a polypeptide with a putative molecular mass of 20.0 kDa. An A/T-rich region and a transcription termination signal, TTTTTAT, were found upstream and at the end of the ORF, which is consistent with poxvirus early gene regulation. The consensus sequence of the late promoter TAAAT also overlapped with the initiation codon of the ORF. The amino acid sequence similarity between the TK genes of CaPV and FPV, avipoxviruses, was 64.2%, which was lower than the similarities between vaccinia and variola orthopoxviruses (97.2%) and between Shope fibroma and myxoma leporipoxviruses (82.6%). However, the monophyly of avian clades of CaPV and FPV was supported by phylogenetic analysis. We then inserted the genes encoding lacZ, luciferase (luci), and envelope of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1 env) into the TK gene of CaPV to evaluate its suitability as an expression vector. The recombinant viruses obtained were unstable, although the foreign genes were expressed efficiently in the mammalian cells infected with the viruses.
