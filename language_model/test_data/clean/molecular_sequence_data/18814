In this study, we sequenced the whole genome of a reovirus isolated from a green bush viper (Atheris squamigera). The bush viper reovirus shared several features with other orthoreoviruses, including its genome organization. In phylogenetic analysis, this strain was monophyletic with Broome virus and baboon orthoreovirus, indicating that these viruses might have originated from a common ancestor. These new molecular data supplement previous information based mainly on biological properties of reptilian reoviruses, confirming their taxonomic position and broadening our knowledge of the evolution of members of the genus Orthoreovirus.
