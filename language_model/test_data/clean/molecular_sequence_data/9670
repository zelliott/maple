Rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) replicates only in phloem cells in infected rice plants and its promoter drives strong phloem-specific reporter gene expression in transgenic rice plants. We isolated a cDNA encoding a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein, RF2a, which binds to the Box II cis element that is important for expression from the promoter. RF2a, which stimulates Box II-dependent transcription in a homologous in vitro transcription system, accumulates in nuclei of phloem and certain other cell types in shoots, but is found at only very low levels in roots. Transgenic antisense plants in which RF2a accumulation was suppressed had normal roots but stunted, twisted leaves with small, disorganized vascular bundles, an enlarged sclerenchyma and large air spaces. We propose that the RTBV promoter exploits a host transcription factor that is critical for leaf tissue differentiation and vascular development for its expression.
