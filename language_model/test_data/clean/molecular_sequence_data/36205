The complete nucleotide (nt) sequence of an open reading frame (ORF) (map unit 5.1 to 3.8) from Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus strain E2 (AcMNPV-E2) has been determined. This 1629-nt ORF has a coding potential for a 61-kDa Pro-rich protein. However, in vitro translation of the 1629-nt ORF and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) revealed a 78-kDa protein product. The discrepancy between the M(r) predicted by the nt sequence and that obtained from the in vitro translational analysis is due to the high Pro content of this protein. The high Pro content causes anomalous migration of this protein during SDS-PAGE.
