We isolated cDNA clones encoding a transglutaminase (TGase: EC 2.3.2.13) from a salmon (Onchorhynchus keta) cDNA library prepared from the liver. In the cDNA sequence combined, an open reading frame coding for a protein of 680 aa was found. The deduced sequence showed a considerable similarity (62.4%) to that of red sea bream TGase. By comparison of sequence similarity to other TGases, the structure of salmon TGase was like tissue type TGases, rather than membrane-associated type or plasma type TGases. As a structural feature of salmon TGase, 3 aa residues were substituted in the 25 aa sequence around the active site Cys residue, which is conserved among several tissue type TGases. The critical residues thought to form the catalytic-center triad (Cys272, His331, and Asp301) were found in the highly conserved region, but the region surrounding Tyr511, which corresponds to the residue participates in hydrogen-bond interactions of active center domain, was less similar to other TGases, except for red sea bream TGase. These finding suggests that the overall structure of fish TGase resembles tissue-type TGases, but has some unique structure.
