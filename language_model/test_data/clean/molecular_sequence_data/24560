Proteus mirabilis strain MAG1, a clinical isolate that is resistant to broad-spectrum penicillins and co-amoxiclav, produces inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-21, a novel mutant of TEM beta-lactamase. This enzyme has a pI of 5.2 and is derived from the bla(TEM-1a) gene ancestor. It contains two major amino acid substitutions specific for co-amoxiclav resistance (Leu-69 for Met and Ser-244 for Arg) that have never been found together previously. The dramatic loss of sensitivity to clavulanic acid, the enhancement of K(m) for all beta-lactams and markedly for ticarcillin, and the decrease in the catalytic efficiency makes IRT-21 comparable to the other IRTs with substitutions at position 244 or double substitutions.
