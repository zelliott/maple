We isolated an 18-kilobase (kb) genomic selenoprotein P clone from a human placenta library and cloned, sequenced, and characterized the 5'-flanking region of the human selenoprotein P gene. Sequence analysis revealed an intron between base pairs (bp) -13 and -14 upstream of the ATG codon and another one between bp 534 and 535 of the coding region. The major transcription start site of selenoprotein P in human HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells was mapped to bp -70 by 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and by primer extension. 1.8 kb of the 5'-flanking sequence were fused to a luciferase reporter gene. They exhibited functional promoter activity in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma and Caco2 colon carcinoma cells in transient transfection experiments. Treatment of transfected HepG2 cells with the cytokines interleukin 1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interferon gamma repressed promoter activity. Nuclear extracts of interferon gamma-treated cells bound to a signal transducer and activator of transcription response element of the promoter in gel retardation experiments. By transfection of promoter-deletion constructs, a TATA box and a putative SP1 site were identified to be necessary for selenoprotein P transcription. These data indicate that the human selenoprotein P gene contains a strong promoter that is cytokine responsive. Furthermore, selenoprotein P, secreted by the liver, might react as a negative acute phase protein.
