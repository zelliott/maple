With one of the largest iron ore deposits in the world, South Africa is recognised to be among the top ten biggest exporters of iron ore. Increasing demand and consumption of this mineral triggered search for processing technologies, which can be utilised to "purify" the low-grade iron ore minerals that contain high levels of unwanted potassium (K) and phosphorus (P). This study investigated a potential biological method that can be further developed for the full biobeneficiation of low-grade iron ore minerals. Twenty-three bacterial strains that belong to Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobateria were isolated from the iron ore minerals and identified with sequence homology and phylogenetic methods. The abilities of these isolates to lower the pH of the growth medium and solubilisation of tricalcium phosphate were used to screen them as potential mineral solubilisers. Eight isolates were successfully screened with this method and utilised in shake flask experiments using iron ore minerals as sources of K and P. The shake flask experiments revealed that all eight isolates have potentials to produce organic acids that aided the solubilisation of the iron ore minerals. In addition, all eight isolates produced high concentrations of gluconic acid followed by relatively lower concentrations of acetic, citric and propanoic acid. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyses also indicated extracellular polymeric substances could play a role in mineral solubilisation.
