The murine Na(+)/myo-inositol cotransporter (SLC5A3) gene (Slc5a3) was cloned, the restriction sites mapped, and the coding region sequenced. Similar to other mammalian counterparts, including human, the gene has a single coding exon, with an open reading frame of 2.2 kb. The predicted protein of 718 amino acids is also highly conserved, compared to other mammalian homologs. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Slc5a3 was localized to the telomeric region of mouse chromosome 16, which is syntenic to human chromosome 21q22. An increased Slc5a3 copy number may explain the increased levels of myo-inositol in the brains of trisomy 16 mice and the increased rate of transport of myo-inositol into cultured neurons derived from trisomy 16 mice.
