Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida is the etiological agent of furunculosis, a serious infectious disease of salmonids. Bacterial phenotypes are known to change in vivo compared to the in vitro state. Proteomic analysis of in vivo phenotypes is usually not possible due to insufficient biomass. Using an in vivo growth chamber model, the pathogenic fish bacterium A. salmonicida was cultured in pure culture in vivo in its host, the Atlantic salmon, to obtain sufficient biomass to allow proteomic analysis. Growth of A. salmonicida under in vitro iron-restricted conditions resulted in the expression of outer membrane proteins of 73, 76 and 85 kDa, which were not present when grown under in vitro iron-replete conditions. Mass spectrometry analysis identified the 73 kDa protein as a colicin receptor, the 76 kDa protein as an outer membrane heme receptor, and the 85 kDa protein as a ferric siderophore receptor. When cultured in vivo, A. salmonicida up-regulated the identical 73, 76 and 85 kDa proteins. The results of this study also suggest, at least with respect to the outer membrane proteins, that the in vitro iron-restricted growth model largely reproduces the results obtained from growth of A. salmonicida within the peritoneal cavity of salmon.
