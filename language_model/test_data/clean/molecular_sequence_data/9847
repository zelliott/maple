The aly, alymphoplasia, is an autosomal recessive mutation in mice of an unknown etiology, which induces total aplasia of lymph nodes and Peyer's patches. We hypothesized that the lack of lymphoid tissue may be due to abnormalities of lymphocyte traffic into these tissues. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of various adhesion molecules associated with lymphocyte homing. Among the adhesion molecules examined, all were normally expressed except the mucosal addressin MAdCAM-1. In aly/aly mice MAdCAM-1 was absent in the spleen at mRNA and protein levels, but was normally expressed in the intestinal venules. The FISH analysis and linkage analysis using microsatellite markers demonstrated that the MAdCAM-1 gene is located on chromosome 10, indicating that MAdCAM-1 is not encoded by the aly gene, which is located on chromosome 11. Our results indicate that the aberrant expression of MAdCAM-1 is not the direct cause of aly mutation but rather a secondary defect.
