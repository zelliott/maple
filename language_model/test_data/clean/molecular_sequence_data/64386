The occurrence of uterine leiomyoma is related to the abnormal expression of some genes, but the molecular mechanism has not been clarified yet, the study screened genes related to uterine leiomyoma by comparing different genes expressed in uterine leiomyoma tissues with normal myometrium uterine tissues.

To compare different genes expressed in uterine leiomyoma tissues with normal myometrium uterine tissues by fluorescent differential display reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (FDD-RTPCR). Four sets of anchor primers and three sets of arbitrary primers, totally twelve primer combinations, were used for FDD-RTPCR amplification. Differentially expressed cDNA fragments were cloned, sequenced, and analyzed in origin. And one of differentially expressed bands was analyzed by RT-PCR.

Twenty-seven cDNA fragments were isolated from uterine leiomyoma. N(568) cDNA fragment shared 96% homology with the sequence of GCRG114 gene. RT-PCR confirmed that this gene was expressed lowlier in uterine leiomyoma tissues than in normal myometrium uterine tissues.

N(568) cDNA fragment is highly homologous with the sequence of GCRG114 gene, and it may be related to the development of uterine leiomyoma.
