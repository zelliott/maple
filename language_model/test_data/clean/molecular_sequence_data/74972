Two mAb were used to develop new techniques for the purification and quantitation of the major feline salivary allergen, Felis domesticus allergen I (Fel d I). The allergen was purified from aqueous house dust extract with a high Fel d I content by affinity chromatography over a monoclonal immunosorbent and elution with 4 mM HCl, pH 2.5. This single step procedure gave 40 to 50% recovery of 90% pure allergen which, following final purification by size exclusion HPLC, showed a single line on immunodiffusion and crossed immunoelectrophoresis against monospecific anti-Fel d I and polyclonal anti-cat dander antibodies. The m.w. of native Fel d I was 39,000 on size exclusion HPLC, and 17,000 under nonreducing conditions on gel electrophoresis. The N-terminal amino acid sequence (33 residues) showed no homology with other known protein sequences. The combination of the SDS-PAGE and N-terminal sequence data suggests that Fel d I is a non-covalently linked homodimer. A two-site RIA was developed using mAb directed against different epitopes on Fel d I. This assay was species-specific, highly sensitive (0.0004 U/ml), and showed an excellent correlation with a polyclonal inhibition RIA (n = 27, r = 0.93, p less than 0.001). Cat allergen extracts used for immediate skin tests showed marked differences in Fel d I content (from 0.1 to 30 U/ml). Consistently high Fel d I levels were found at monthly intervals in six dust samples from four houses with cats (10 to 100 U/g of dust). Comparisons of Fel d I and mite and pollen allergen levels showed that house dust can contain greater than 100 micrograms/g of either of these allergens and is a potent source of foreign environmental antigens. Monoclonal affinity chromatography provides a major breakthrough in the purification of Fel d I, from a source material that would otherwise have been considered impossible (house dust). The mAb assay for Fel d I is both more sensitive and more easily standardized than existing techniques. These techniques will allow full structural and antigenic analysis of Fel d I and more detailed studies on the relationship between cat antigen exposure and the development of asthma.
