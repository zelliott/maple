The heat shock promoter is useful for regulating transgene expression in small water-living organisms. In zebrafish embryos, downstream gene expression can be greatly induced throughout the body by raising the temperature from 28.5 degrees C to 38.0 degrees C. By manipulating the local temperature within an embryo, spatial control of transgene expression is also possible. One such way for inducing heat shock response in targeted cells is by using a laser microbeam under the microscope. In addition, random mosaic expression by transient gene expression and transplantation of the transgenic embryo into a wild type host can be considered a powerful tool for studying gene functions using this promoter. In this paper, we review the applications of the zebrafish heat shock protein promoter as a gene expression tool and for lineage labeling and transcription enhancer screening.
