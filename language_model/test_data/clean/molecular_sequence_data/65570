The rapid increase in the number of putative cDNA sequences encoding crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) family in various tissues [either from the eyestalk (ES) or elsewhere] underscores a need to identify the corresponding neuropeptides in relevant tissues. Moreover, the presence of provided structural CHH implies the level of the complexity of physiological regulation in crustaceans. Much less is known of the functions of non-ES CHH than of those of its counterpart present in ESs. In the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, we know little of CHH involvement in response to the stressful conditions that naturally occur in Chesapeake Bay. We have identified two isoforms of CHH neuropeptide in the sinus gland of the ES and isolated a full-length cDNA encoding CHH from the pericardial organ (PO). The functions of ES-CHH and PO-CHH in this species were studied with regard to expression and release in response to stressful episodes: hypoxia, emersion, and temperatures. Animals exposed to hypoxic conditions responded with concomitant release of both CHHs. In contrast, the mRNA transcripts encoding two CHHs were differentially regulated: PO-CHH increased, whereas ES-CHH decreased. This result suggests a possible differential regulation of transcription of these CHHs.
