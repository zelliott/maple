A novel approach to study the variability of consensus sites of regulatory regions of DNA is proposed. The overall strategy includes chemical synthesis of representative series of all possible DNA structures under investigation, cloning and screening according to their function. The chemical-enzymatic synthesis of a complete library of 40-bp DNA duplexes, corresponding to the model prokaryotic promoter and differing in 6-membered segments at -35 region, is described.
