The organization of the human cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) gene was found to be similar to its rat counterpart, and the location of the introns in the protein structure was identical to the rat CDO gene. The major transcription start site, identified by primer extension, was located 260 bp upstream from the ATG codon. The sequence of the 5'-immediate upstream region was highly conserved between the human and rat CDO genes. The putative promoter region contained a TATA-box-like sequence, and many putative cis-acting elements including HNF5, GRE, TRE, CRE, CArG box, ARE, MBS, and NF-kB. A Northern blot analysis revealed that CDO mRNA was strongly expressed in the liver and placenta, and weakly in the heart, brain and pancreas. CDO mRNA was also detected in human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells. The CDO mRNA level in HepG2 cells was decreased after 2 h and reached a minimum 6 h-8 h after a phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment, and then gradually returned to the basal level.
