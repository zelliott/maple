We present a new method for the analysis of glycans enzymatically released from monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) employing a zwitterionic-type hydrophilic interaction chromatography (ZIC-HILIC) column coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Both native and reduced glycans were analyzed, and the developed procedure was compared with a standard HILIC procedure used in the pharmaceutical industry whereby fluorescent-labeled glycans are analyzed using a TSK Amide-80 column coupled with fluorescence detection. The separation of isobaric alditol oligosaccharides present in monoclonal antibodies and ribonuclease B is demonstrated, and ZIC-HILIC is shown to have good capability for structural recognition. Glycan profiles obtained with the ZIC-HILIC column and ESI-MS provided detailed information on MAb glycosylation, including identification of some less abundant glycan species, and are consistent with the profiles generated with the standard procedure. This new ZIC-HILIC method offers a simpler and faster approach for glycosylation analysis of therapeutic antibodies.
