In the course of studies on local keratin phenotypes in the epidermis of the adult mouse, we have identified a new 65 kD and 48 kD keratin pair. In mouse skin, this keratin pair is only expressed in suprabasal cells of adult mouse tail scale epidermis which is characterized by the complete absence of a granular layer and the formation of a remarkably compact stratum corneum. A second site in which the 65 kD and 48 kD keratin pair is suprabasally expressed and whose morphology corresponds to that of tail scale epidermis is found in the posterior unit of the complex filiform papillae of mouse tongue. The causal relationship of the expression of the 65 kD and 48 kD keratins with this particular type of a non-pathological epithelial parakeratosis is emphasized by the suppression of the mRNA synthesis of the two keratins during retinoic acid mediated orthokeratotic conversion of tail scale epidermis. Apart from tail scale epidermis and the posterior unit of the filiform papillae, the 65 kD and 48 kD keratin pair is, however, also coexpressed with "hard" alpha keratins in suprabulbar cells of hair follicles and in suprabasal cells of the central core unit of the lingual filiform papillae. The non alpha-helical domains of the two new keratins are rich in cysteine and proline residues and lack the typical subdomains into which epithelial keratins of both types can be divided. This structural resemblance of the 65 kD and 48 kD keratins to "hard" alpha keratins is supported by comparative flexibility predictions for their non alpha-helical domains. Phylogenetic investigations then show that the 65 kD and 48 kD keratin pair has evolved together with hair keratins, but has diverged from these during evolution to constitute an independent branch of a pair of hair-related keratins. In view of this exceptional position of the 65 kD and 48 kD keratins within the keratin multigene family, their expression has apparently been adopted by rare anatomical sites in which an orthokeratinized stratum corneum would be too soft and a hard keratinized structure would be too rigid to meet the functional requirement of the respective epithelia.
