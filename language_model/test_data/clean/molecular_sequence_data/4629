Some Gram-negative bacteria possess a system for the uptake of iron from host's transferrin consisting of two outer-membrane proteins, namely transferrin-binding proteins 1 and 2. Here we present the cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding the transferrin-binding protein 1 from a serotype 1 isolate of the Gram-negative pathogen Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. We have also cloned for expression the Tbp1 and Tbp2 encoding sequences. Both proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and further purified. We also report the deduced Tbp1 amino acid sequence comparison to Tbp1s from related species.
