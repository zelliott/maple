Twenty-eight polymorphic microsatellites were isolated from the sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, using a microsatellite enrichment protocol and selective hybridization with oligonucleotide probes. Analysis for these markers and 11 recently described microsatellites of D. labrax found linkage between 26 loci and revealed eight linkage groups.
