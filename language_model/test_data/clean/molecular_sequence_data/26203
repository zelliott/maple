The major fraction of an acidic galactoglucomannan present in lipopolysaccharide extracts from cell walls of the O23 reference strain of Serratia marcescens has the tetrasaccharide repeating-unit shown. In a minor fraction, L-glutamic acid was amide-linked to about half of the D-glucuronic acid residues. The possible contributions of the acidic polymers and a neutral polymer produced by the organism to cross-reactions with other serogroups are discussed.
