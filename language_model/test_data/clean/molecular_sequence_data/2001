The DNA sequences encoding component C of methyl coenzyme M reductase (mcr genes) in Methanothermus fervidus, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Methanococcus vannielii, and Methanosarcina barkeri have been published. Comparisons of transcription initiation and termination sites and of the amino acid sequences of the mcr gene products are presented. Structural features conserved within the amino acid sequences are identified and a comparison of methyl reductase with other disulfide bond synthesizing enzymes is presented.
