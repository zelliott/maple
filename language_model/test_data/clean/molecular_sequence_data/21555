The SLC2A10 gene located on chromosome 20q13.1 encodes the facilitative glucose transporter 10 (GLUT10), a class III member of the SLC2A facilitative glucose transporter family. Mutations in the human SLC2A10 gene cause arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS), a rare autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder. In this work, we report the characterization of the slc2a10 ortholog gene in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and its expression pattern during embryonic development and in adult tissues. The slc2a10 gene consists of 5 exons, spanning 8 kb and mapping to a region on chromosome 11 that exhibits conserved synteny with human chromosome 20. The gene encodes Glut10, a 513 amino acid protein that maintains the 12 transmembrane domain structure typical of the GLUTs family, and shares the specific functional motifs involved in sugar transport with the vertebrate GLUT10. RT-PCR analysis showed that two specific splice variants, both including the 5â€™-UTR region, were expressed during embryogenesis and in different adult zebrafish tissues and organs. In situ hybridization analyses demonstrated a maternal origin of the total slc2a10 mRNA and its ubiquitous distribution until the early somitogenesis stage. In later embryonic stages, slc2a10 mRNA was detected in the otic vesicles, hatching gland cells, pectoral fin, posterior tectum and swim bladder. Overall, these results suggest a wide role of slc2a10 during zebrafish development.
