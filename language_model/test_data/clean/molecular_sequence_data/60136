Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 activator (Cdk5alpha) is an activator of Cdk5 kinase activity and its expression is restricted to neurons. The complex of Ckd5/Cdk5alpha is essential for neurite outgrowth during neuronal differentiation and possibly also for neuronal degeneration. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a Drosophila Cdk5alpha-like molecule (dCdk5alpha). The gene encoding this molecule is localized in the Drosophila chromosome region of 31D1-31D2. The expression of this gene is differentially regulated with a very low level at earlier developmental stages and reaches the highest level in the adult. The C-terminal of this molecule shares high homology with the mammalian Cdk5alpha molecule. Constitutive over-expression of dCdk5alpha in transgenic flies significantly prolongs their recovery time from 5 min to O(2) deprivation or anoxia in older flies (15 days) but not in young ones (4 days). In addition, anoxia up-regulated the expression of this gene. Taken together, the results in this report and others provide a framework for genetically dissecting the functions of Cdk5alpha/Cdk5 complex in the CNS.
