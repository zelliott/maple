The efficacy of single-dose azithromycin therapy in the treatment of cervical Chlamydia trachomatis infections was compared to that of a standard seven-day course of treatment with doxycycline. Cervical samples from 60 patients reacted positively in an enzyme immunoassay for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis. In 31 patients Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated from the sample taken before treatment. Fourteen of the 31 patients were treated with doxycycline and 17 with azithromycin. All cultures of samples taken one and four weeks after the start of therapy were negative. All 31 isolates showed a similar pattern of MICs for the seven antibiotics tested, including azithromycin and doxycycline. No differences were observed between isolates of different serovars. In samples from four patients chlamydial DNA could be detected by PCR one week after the start of the therapy and in two patients also after four weeks. No difference in microbiological parameters could be observed between the two treatment groups. It is concluded that single-dose azithromycin is as effective as a seven-day course of doxycycline in the therapy of cervical Chlamydia trachomatis infections.
