The gene (HSD-1) coding a human sperm membrane protein (hSMP-1) was isolated from a human testis cDNA expression library using antibodies found in the serum of an infertile woman. HSD-1 was localized to a single locus on chromosome 9 and assigned to band 9p12-p13 by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) mapping and DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) banding, using rat/human somatic cell hybrids and metaphase chromosomes of human lymphocytes. In rescreening a testis lambdagt10 cDNA expression library, the full-length cDNA (HSD-1) and several truncated cDNAs with heterologous regions were isolated from positive clones. The heterology consisted of deletion, insertion and alteration of the 5'-end. These heterologous truncated fragments may be produced by alternative splicing of mRNAs. Two recombinant prokaryotic expression vectors were constructed with one of the heterologous fragment (clone #26) with and without the alternative 5'-end. Escherichia coli transfected with the construct containing the alternative 5'-end failed to produce the recombinant product, whereas those transfected with the vector lacking the 5'-end produced hSMP-1. DNASIS analysis of the structure of #26 mRNA suggests that the 5'-end has a stable secondary configuration that may maintain the mRNA in an inactivated state, whereby hindering its translation and preventing the expression of the gene.
