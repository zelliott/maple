The gene encoding the major envelope glycoprotein (gp51) with its signal sequence, represented by an additional NH2-terminal 33-residue amino acid sequence of bovine leukemia virus (BLV), was inserted into a baculovirus transfer vector. A recombinant virus expressing a secreted gp51 protein in insect cells was isolated. The recombinant gp51 expressed was characterized by using an anti-BLV monoclonal antibody by both Western blotting analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The secreted gp51 was used as an antigen, and an ELISA with recombinant gp51 (rgp51) was developed for the detection of BLV antibodies. This new procedure was compared with a previous ELISA method for the detection of BLV antibodies and an agar gel immunodiffusion test performed with an unpurified BLV antigen preparation. The comparative testing of field samples showed that the ELISA with rgp51 is more specific and also suitable for the testing of pooled sera.
