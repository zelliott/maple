The bacterial transposon Tn7 encodes two distinct but overlapping transposition pathways. tnsABC + tnsD promote transposition to a specific site, attTn7, while tnsABC + tnsE promote transposition to many other sites unrelated to attTn7. We have identified a tnsD-dependent DNA binding activity that specifically recognizes attTn7. We have localized the recognition sequences for this activity to a 28-base-pair region and have shown that this same region can provide specific properties of an attTn7 target in vivo. Interestingly, these sequences are positioned more than 25 base pairs from the specific point of Tn7 insertion.
