A battery of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated lectins (ConA, WGA, PNA, SBA, DBA, UEAI and LTA) was used to study the content and distribution of glycoconjugate sugar residues of the normal human nasal mucosa. Our findings indicate that differences exist between the types of sugar residues found in the secretory product of the mucous goblet-like cells and those found in the mucous glands secretion. The saccharide content of the epithelial basal cells, which has never been previously investigated, is reported. Differences in the content and distribution of glycoconjugate sugar residues were found between human nasal mucosa and that of the other human extrapulmonary tracts.
