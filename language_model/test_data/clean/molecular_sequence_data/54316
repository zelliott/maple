A Gram-staining-negative, oxidase-positive, catalase-positive, non-motile, non-spore-forming, and rod-shaped bacterium, designated BJQ-6(T), was isolated from activated sludge of a waste-water treatment plant in Jiangsu Province, China. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain BJQ-6(T) belonged to the genus Rhodanobacter, and shared 98.7% similarity with Rhodanobacter lindaniclasticus LMG 18385(T) and <97% similarities with other Rhodanobacter species. The major fatty acids were iso-C₁₅:₀ (17.6%), iso-C₁₆:₀ (19.3%), and Summed feature 9 (isoC₁₇:₁ ω9c and/or C₁₆:₀ 10-methyl) (25.8%). The DNA G+C content of strain BJQ-6(T) was 64.8 mol%. Based on the phenotypic and phylogenetic considerations, strain BJQ-6(T) represents a novel species of the genus Rhodanobacter, for which the name Rhodanobacter xiangquanii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is BJQ-6(T) (=CCTCC AB 2010106(T) =KCTC 23100(T)).
