Sequence analysis was carried out of a human clone pBA0.6 generated after exonuclease III/S1 nuclease digestion and subcloning of pCMM86 (GDB: 168382, D17S74), which was not available in the database. It revealed the presence of a reiterating core motif of 24mer GTGGGTGTGTTGGAGGGGGTGAGG, present 23 times, which was GC-rich and minisatellitic in nature. Genomic blots of HaeIII-digested human DNA, when hybridized with pBA0.6, generated a ladder of bands between 29.0 kb and 2.1 kb. Hybridization analyses of 88 unrelated individuals belonging to four regions of India using this probe revealed polymorphic bands which were individual specific. The probability of identity ranged from 5.07x10(-14) in Punjabis to 2.64x10(-16) in Bengalis and was found to be 3.06x10(-16) in UPites, whereas in the case of South Indians, it was 3.9x10(-15). Three sets of isomorphic bands at 29.0 kb, 2.4 kb, and 2.1 kb were common between the individuals of all the regions and served as internal markers. The 29.0-kb band was observed to be Homo sapiens specific. Construction of dendrograms based on the UPGMA method with Jaccard's coefficient values suggested less genetic similarity/high genetic diversity in all the population groups, indicating that the samples taken were random. Maximum likelihood estimates through the bootstrap sampling method showed that Punjabis, Bengalis, and UPites formed one cluster, whereas South Indians formed a separate cluster, altogether thus showing the proximity of these three population groups compared with that from South India. A preliminary study by Northern hybridization with pBA0.6 resulted in two transcripts of 0.63 kb and 0.29 kb. This finding was corroborated with RT-PCR results where 2 amplicons, matching the expected size of two open reading frames within the minisatellite sequence, were obtained. The role of the two transcripts from the minisatellite sequence is not clear as yet, and it is probable that these messages may not get translated because of the absence of a eukaryotic Kozak sequence around the initiator methionine in the pBA0.6 sequence.
