The coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4) belongs to human enterovirus B species within the family Picornaviridae. Here we report a novel complete genome sequence of a recombinant CVB4 strain, CVB4/GX/10, which was isolated from a patient with a fatal case of hand, foot, and mouth disease in China. The complete genome consists of 7,293 nucleotides, excluding the 3' poly(A) tail, and has an open reading frame that maps between nucleotide positions 742 and 7293 and encodes a 2,183-amino-acid polyprotein. Phylogenetic analysis based on different genome regions reveals that CVB4/GX/10 is closest to a CVB4 strain, EPIHFMD-CLOSE CONTACT-16, in the 5' half (VP4∼2B) of the genome, although it is closer to a Chinese CVB5 strain, CVB5/Henan/2010, in the 3' half (2C∼3D) of the genome. Furthermore, similar bootscan analysis based on the whole genomes demonstrates that recombination has possibly occurred within the 2C domain and that CVB4/GX/10 is a possible progeny of intertypic recombination of the CVB4 strain EPIHFMD-CLOSE CONTACT-16 and CVB5/Henan/2010 that occurred during their cocirculation and evolution, which is a relatively common phenomenon in enteroviruses.
