To evaluate the relationship between nitric oxide (NO) and carcinogenesis, we assayed 4 human thyroid papillary carcinomas (TPC) and 3 normal thyroid glands for the presence of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Using an antibody against iNOS, we observed immunohistochemical staining if iNOS in the TPC samples, but not in normal thyroid. When we incubated TPC samples with antibodies against both iNOS and human leukocyte antigen (LCA), a macrophage marker, we found that while most TPC cells were stained with anti-iNOS antibody, only a few were stained with both. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that iNOS mRNA was expressed in the samples of TPC, but not in normal thyroid. The sequence of iNOS message in the TPC samples was identical to that previously detected in a human colon cancer cell line. These results suggest that iNOS in human TPC is mostly derived from tumor cells, rather than macrophages, and that it may play a direct role in carcinogenesis.
