Cilia-associated respiratory (CAR) bacillus, an unclassified gliding bacterium associated with respiratory disease in rats, mice, and rabbits, has previously been cultivated only in embryonated chicken eggs, cell culture, or cell culture medium supplemented with conditioned medium from cultured tracheas. A reference strain of CAR bacillus, originally isolated in eggs, grew in cell culture flasks as adherent individual bacilli and ropy, whorled fascicles in cell culture media supplemented only with fetal calf serum. Using Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, we isolated CAR bacillus from naturally infected rats and a naturally infected rabbit and from experimentally inoculated mice and rats. Isolates were maintained for up to 20 passages. Isolates from rats were similar in morphology to the reference strain, but most were more actively motile and formed pincushion-like aggregates. The rabbit bacilli were smaller and formed fewer aggregates. DNAs of rat isolates differed only slightly in restriction fragment patterns from that of the reference strain, whereas that of the rabbit isolate was distinctly different. Cultures of CAR bacilli of all strains from rats contained Mycoplasma fermentans, Mycoplasma pulmonis, or both, and cultures of the CAR bacillus from the rabbit contained an unidentified arginine-utilizing mycoplasma. The sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of the reference strain was determined by amplification by polymerase chain reaction, cloning of the product, and sequencing by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. Comparison of the sequence with sequences in the GenBank data base indicated that CAR bacillus is a unique organism most closely related to Flavobacterium ferrugineum and Flexibacter sancti.
