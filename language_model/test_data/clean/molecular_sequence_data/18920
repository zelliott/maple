Peroxisomal ascorbate peroxidase detoxifies H₂O₂ leaching out from peroxisomes into the cytoplasm. The present study describes transcript expression and cis-regulation of the SbpAPX gene cloned from an extreme halophyte, Salicornia brachiata, in the steady state and under different stresses. About 2-fold elevated transcript expression was found in salt- and drought-treated shoots at 12 h compared with control, while 1.9-fold increased expression was observed under heat treatment. In roots, the transcript level was down-regulated at 2 h, thereafter increasing with the time of exposure and reaching a maximum at the control level. The SbpAPX promoter has characteristic cis-regulatory ABA-dependent abiotic stress-responsive elements. The full-length promoter (1,024 bp, PP1) and deletion constructs -838 (PP2), -697 (PP3), -433 (PP4) and -185 bp (PP5) were fused with the GUS (β-glucuronidase) gene and transformed into tobacco for functional validation. Expression of GUS increased significantly in transgenic plants under stress. Quantitative expression analysis of GUS in T₁ plants revealed that promoter PP5 is efficient for gene expression. In planta transient expression further suggested that the promoter PP5 contains efficient stress-inducible elements. A steep decline in GUS expression in PP3, and thereafter an elevated expression in PP4 and PP5, suggested the presence of a repressor element between -696 and -433 bp, while an enhancer element was predicted between -838 and -697 bp. Further, transient expression analyses and electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that the core sequence of cis-acting motifs ATAA and CCTCAA function as enhancer and repressor binding sites, respectively. Based on the study, a model is proposed for the cis-regulation of the SbpAPX gene. The present study provides a useful insight for understanding gene expression regulation in a halophyte with or without stress. Furthermore, potential stress-responsive promoter-driven expression of introgressed gene(s) can be used for engineering crops with enhanced stress tolerance.
