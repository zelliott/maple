Protein synthesis is controlled by the phosphorylation of proteins comprising the translational apparatus. At least 12 initiation factor polypeptides, 3 elongation factors and a ribosomal protein are implicated. Stimulation of translation correlates with enhanced phosphorylation of eIF-4F, eIF-4B, eIF-2B, eIF-3 and ribosomal protein S6, whereas inhibition correlates with phosphorylation of eEF-2 and the alpha-subunit of eIF-2. Strong evidence for regulatory roles exists for eIF-2, eIF-4F and eEF-2, whereas changes in other factor activities due to phosphorylation remain to be demonstrated. Regulation of the specific activity of the translational apparatus by phosphorylation appears to be a general mechanism for the control of rates of global protein synthesis, and may also play a role in modulating the translation of specific mRNAs.
