Changes in the structure and composition of a protistan community were characterized through the analysis of small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene (18S) sequences for a 3-day bottle incubation using a single sample collected in the western North Atlantic. Cloning and sequencing was used to investigate changes in perceived species richness and diversity as a consequence of environmental perturbation. The treatments included a control (unamended seawater), inorganic nutrient enrichment, and enrichment with a complex organic mixture. Five clone libraries were constructed and analyzed at the time of collection (t-0 h) and after 24 (t-24 h) and 72 (t-72 h) h for the control, and at t-72 h for the inorganic and organic enrichments, resulting in an analysis of 1,626 partial 18S rDNA sequences that clustered into 238 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Analysis of the clone libraries revealed that protistan assemblages were highly dynamic and changed substantially at both the OTU level and higher taxonomic classifications during time frames consistent with many oceanographic methods used for measuring biological rates. Changes were most dramatic in enrichments, which yielded community compositions that were strongly dominated by one or a few taxa. Changes in community structure during incubation dramatically influenced estimates of species richness, which were substantially lower with longer incubation and especially with amendment, even though all incubated samples originated from the same aliquot of seawater. Containment and enrichment of the seawater sample led to the detection of otherwise undetected protistan taxa, suggesting that characterization of protistan diversity in a sample only at the time of collection could lead to an underrepresentation of unique taxa. Additionally, the rapid increase in the relative abundance of some members of the "rare biosphere" in our results implies an ecological importance of at least some of the taxa comprising the "rare biosphere."
