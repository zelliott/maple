The ability of genetically diverse strains of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) to coexist in a 1750-sow farm was assessed through the case study describing a chronically infected farm, and also by an animal experiment involving the use of swine bioassay. The case study employed a program of monitoring sera from suckling, nursery, and finishing pigs for the presence of PRRSV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and virus isolation (VI). The swine bioassay tested homogenates, consisting of lymphoid and pulmonary tissues, collected from 60 breeding animals from the same farm. The open reading frame (ORF) 5 portion of selected positive PRRSV detected from sera or tissues were nucleic acid sequenced and their phylogenies compared. The results indicated the presence of 3 genetically diverse groups, designated PRRSV-A, -B, and -C. Sequence heterology ranged from 5.8 to 11% between groups. Sequence homology ranged from 98.7 to 99.8% within groups. Swine bioassay verified the presence of PRRSV-A in 1 of 60 animals, and no evidence of strains B or C were detected. This paper indicates that based on the evaluation of ORF 5, genetically diverse strains of PRRSV appear to coexist, although the frequency and significance of this observation is not understood.
