Three short synthetic DNA sequences, which are closely related to one another, confer three distinct patterns of developmental expression on the heat shock hsp70 gene in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster lines. These results show that small variations or even single base pair changes in a repeated element of a regulatory sequence can create promoters that display new specificities of tissue and developmental regulation. Interestingly, the three patterns of developmental expression conferred by the synthetic DNAs resemble in part those of the known developmental genes: glucose dehydrogenase (Gld), Dopa decarboxylase (Ddc), and salivary gland secretory proteins (Sgs), respectively. In each case, the defined regulatory region of the known developmental gene contains multiple sequences that are similar or identical to the synthetic sequence that confers a similar pattern of developmental expression on the hsp70 gene. Thus, these results are congruent with the view that short sequence elements in multiple copies can confer either simple or relatively complex patterns of developmental expression on a receptive promoter like that of hsp70. Furthermore, the fact that the three variants tested produced three distinct patterns of expression in transgenic animals suggests that the number of different elements is large.
