Human endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent cardiovascular bioactive peptide. Its activity is based on the C-terminal residues, e.g., Trp 21 in particular. Recently, we reported an NMR solution structure of ET-1, which has a C-terminal hydrophobic core around Tyr 13. This C-terminal conformation does not agree with a previously reported X-ray crystal structure. To clarify the discrepancy, we performed photo-CIDNP NMR in combination with MALDI-TOF MS. The photo-CIDNP results revealed that the Tyr 13 aromatic ring is concealed in a hydrophobic interaction. MALDI-TOF MS experiments showed this is an intramolecular interaction in monomeric form, which is also supported by sedimentation analysis and two-dimensional NMR cross-peak line shapes. Thus, we confirmed the intramolecular hydrophobic core around Tyr 13 in aqueous solution, which agrees with the solution structure. The C-terminal conformational discrepancy between the solution and crystal was caused by the intermolecular hydrogen bond between Tyr 13 of one molecule and Asp 8 of the other in a dimer-like formation of crystalline ET-1. On the other hand, we indicated that endothelin-3, another isoform of the endothelin, has an apparent self-association equilibrium under the same condition in which three tyrosines participate.
