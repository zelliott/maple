Family: Ascaridae as a whole is distributed among Africa and adjacent regions and in many areas of the world. The nematode Ascaridia galli is one of the most pathogenic and economically important parasites of poultry. The adult affect the small intestine of the hosts feeding on digested food materials. Its control costs million dollars annually. The genomic DNA was extracted from nematode parasites, A. galli, from specific host, native chickens. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was applied to ensure that the DNA content aids in the further studies. Two primers were used in the PCR reactions. The two primers were screened, only the second primer gave total amplified fragment markers 818Â bp. The gene sequences obtained from Egyptian A. galli was compared with another one of accession number (AY587609) showing that the sequence was similar in some points from 346 to 1244 sequence, to make a phylogenetic relationships of A. galli with other nematodes on the data base showing that it was to some extent similar to Heterorhabditis spp.
