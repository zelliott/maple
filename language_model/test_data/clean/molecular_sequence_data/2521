Retroviral gag gene-encoded core nucleic acid binding proteins contain either one or two sequences of the form Cys-Xaa2-Cys-Xaa4-His-Xaa4-Cys. Previously, one of us has proposed that these sequences form metal-binding domains in analogy with the "zinc finger" domains first observed in transcription factor IIIA. We report that an 18-amino acid peptide derived from the core nucleic acid binding protein from Rauscher murine leukemia virus binds metal ions such as Co2+ and Zn2+. The absorption spectrum of the peptide-Co2+ complex is highly suggestive of tetrahedral coordination involving three cysteinates and one histidine. Titration experiments indicate that the dissociation constant for the peptide-Co2+ complex is 1.0 microM and that Zn2+ binds more tightly than Co2+. A detailed three-dimensional structure for this domain based on conserved substructures in other crystallographically characterized metalloproteins and on a detailed analysis of the Cys-Xaa2-Cys-Xaa4-His-Xaa4-Cys sequences from retroviruses and other related sources is proposed.
