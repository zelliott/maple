The nucleotide sequence of the Candida albicans erg7 gene, which complements erg7 mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and restores oxidosqualene cyclase activity, was determined. The gene encodes a 728-aa protein that displays homology with squalene-hopene cyclase, providing further evidence that erg7 is the gene encoding 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase.
