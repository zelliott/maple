Gene trapping in mouse embryonic stem cells is an important genetic approach that allows simultaneous mutation of genes and generation of corresponding mutant mice. We designed a selection scheme with drug selection markers and Cre/loxP technology which allows screening of gene trap events that responded to a signaling molecule in a 96-well format. Nine hundred twenty gene trap clones were assayed, and 258 were classified as gene traps induced by in vitro differentiation. Sixty-five of the in vitro differentiation-inducible gene traps were also responsive to retinoic acid treatment. In vivo analysis revealed that 85% of the retinoic acid-inducible gene traps trapped developmentally regulated genes, consistent with the observation that genes induced by retinoic acid treatment are likely to be developmentally regulated. Our results demonstrate that the inducible gene trapping system described here can be used to enrich in vitro for traps in genes of interest. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the cre reporter is extremely sensitive and can be used to explore chromosomal regions that are not detectable with neo as a selection cassette.
