Most of the 97 transcripts of the genes on chromosome VI of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that were identified by a series of Northern hybridization experiments (Yoshikawa and Isono, Nucl. Acids Res., 19, 1189-1195, 1991) have been correlated with the open reading frames (ORFs) deduced from the nucleotide sequence data of this chromosome (Murakami et al., Nature Genet., 10, 261-268, 1995). This was performed by comparing the experimentally constructed physical map and the one produced from the nucleotide sequence data, as well as the sizes and positions of observed transcripts and those of sequenced ORFs. Thus, 75 ORFs of chromosome VI were correlated uniquely with the corresponding transcripts and 3 ORFs with two transcripts of different sizes. Comparing the relative abundance levels of individual transcripts with that of the RPO41 transcript, highly expressed genes of chromosome VI were found to be located almost exclusively on the Crick strand. Based on the correlation between the abundance level of the experimentally identified transcripts and the codon adaptation indices of the corresponding gene, the genes on chromosome VI of S. cerevisiae were classified into three groups. The data thus provides information concerning their chromosomal locations as well as their likely levels of expression in vegetatively growing cells.
