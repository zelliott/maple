Rat prostaglandin endoperoxidase synthase-2 (PGHS-2) cDNA was cloned from rat calvarial osteoblasts total RNA by RT-PCR. The primary sequence of rat PGHS-2 had 98% and 92% identity to the mouse and human enzymes, respectively. Transfection of the rat PGHS-2 cDNA into COS 7 cells, followed by the addition of 20 microM arachidonic acid, resulted in a dramatic increase in PGE2 released from these cells. The amount of PGE2 produced was comparable to that obtained from cells similarly transfected with human PGHS-1 cDNA. In the rat paw carrageenin-oedema inflammatory model, the injected paw had elevated levels of PGHS-2 mRNA compared to the control paw. In a rat pyrexia model, injection of the pyrogen lipopolysaccharide, resulted in elevated levels of PGHS-2 mRNA in the brain. These results suggest that PGHS-2 expression plays a role both in inflammation and fever.
