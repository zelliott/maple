A cDNA encoding a novel isoform of acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS6) was isolated from embryos of oilseed rape. Homology searches show it is most closely related to ACS4 from rat and human brain rather than the other oilseed rape ACSs. The ACS6 is strongly expressed in embryos and flowers, tissues of Brassica napus that synthesize lipids at high rates. The activity of recombinantly expressed ACS6 was recovered in the insoluble fraction (214,000 x g, 1 h pellet). CHAPS-solubilized recombinant ACS6 protein preferred utilising long-chain fatty acids that contained a cis-9 double bond, i.e. palmitoleic, oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids. Western blot analysis showed that the ACS6 protein is membrane-bound.
