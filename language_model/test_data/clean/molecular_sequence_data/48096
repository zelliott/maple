Peptide-based approaches to protein structure within membranes have proven enormously valuable. When one focusses on the detailed manner through which membrane proteins actually traverse the cell bilayer, a simple observation emerges: helical peptide segments of 20 amino acids each constitute the only tangible connection between the inside and outside of the cell. Thus, a major step towards understanding the key relationships between biological function and membrane protein structure can be taken through characterization, by composition, sequence, chain length, hydrophobicity and conformation, of hydrophobic peptides designed as mimics of transmembrane segments.
