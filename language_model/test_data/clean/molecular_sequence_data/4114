Genetic and RAPD analysis were studied among [4] individuals in F2 segregated population originating from a cross between wheat cultivator Nongda 85021 (female parent, salt sensitive) and Chadian Red (male parent, salt tolerant). For genetic analysis and chi-square test gave a good fit of 1:2:1 ratio showing that one major gene was controlling the salt tolerant character in Chadian Red. DNA of F2 population was extracted to develop tolerant and sensitive gene pools, respectively, based the BSA (Bulked Segregate Analysis). By RAPD (Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNAs), 520 random primers were used to amplify the two types of gene pools. Only primer OPZ09 was found to be polymorphic with a fragment of 590 bp in the two parents, F1 and F2 populations. So, the specific fragment OPZ09-590 was, a RAPD marker linked to salt tolerance gene in Chadian Red. By the software JOINMAP (Version 1.4), the recombination was 5.674% and the linking distance was 6.557 cM. OPZ09-590 was extracted from the agarose and mixed with pUCm-T vector, then the vector was transferred into JM109. The clone was determined 591 bp after being sequenced. It indicated that the RAPD marker of salt tolerance gene in Chadian Red was OPZ09-591.
