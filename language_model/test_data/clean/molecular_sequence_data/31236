Based on protein sequence databank (PIR), the 'variable fragment' bank, comprising pairs of closely-related proteins, containing one or more strongly differing sites of primary structures, was formed. The bank includes 465 'variable fragments' in 383 protein pairs. The amino acid composition of 'variable fragments' was examined and indices of potential amino acid residue variability were formed. An analysis of the interchangeability of amino acid fragments depending on the substitution site (N- or C-terminal, or middle part of a chain), the fragment length differences and physico-chemical properties of residues, such as volume, hydrophobicity, polarity and isoelectric point, was carried out. Based on this analysis some general empirical rules of peptide insertions in carrier proteins were created. The rules are directed at performing modifications leaving the general structure and function of the carrier protein molecule unchanged. The selection scheme for the regions suitable for modification and the criteria for determination of the range of acceptable variations in these regions were suggested. The use of the potential variability profile for detecting regions suitable for peptide insertion was considered using surface protein of hepatitis B virus as an example.
