The sequencing of a 6619 bp region encoding for a flocculation gene previously cloned from a strain defined as FLO5 (Bidard et al., 1994) has revealed that it was a FLO1 gene. The FLO1 gene product has been localized at the cell surface of the yeast cell by immunofluorescent microscopy. The Flo1 protein contains four regions with repeated sequences which account for about 70% of the amino acids of this protein. A functional analysis of the major repeated region has revealed that it plays an important role in determining the flocculation level. A gene disruption experiment has shown that FLO5 strain STX 347-1D contains at least two flocculation genes of the FLO1 type but that they are supposed to be inactive and do not contribute to its flocculation. However, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays performed on intact cells have revealed that a protein expressed at the cell surface of the FLO5 strain STX 347-1D is antigenically related to Flo1p. A deletion analysis of the 5' region of the FLO1 gene has shown that the expression is submitted to controls which depend on the genetic background of the strain.
