ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), approximately 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, are involved in protein trafficking and enhance cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Expression of six ARF genes was examined in mammalian tissues; only ARF 4 mRNA was detected in rat testis in forms considerably shorter than those in other tissues. Testis-specific expression of short forms of ARF 4 mRNA was observed in several mammalian species. On Northern analysis of the developmental expression of rat ARF 4 mRNA, appearance of the shorter species was consistent with its involvement in a late stage of spermatogenesis. Sequences of products of rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE-polymerase chain reaction) of rat ARF 4 mRNA revealed that different mRNAs resulted from the use of three polyadenylation signals, one AUUAAA and two AAUAAA. Sequences of 3'-untranslated regions of rat and human ARF 4 mRNA were very similar with identical polyadenylation signals at similar positions. Of the ARF 4 mRNAs identified by RACE-PCR, with sizes of 1.1, 1.3, and 1.8 kb, the 1.1-kb mRNA was predominant in adult testis. By in situ hybridization, the 1.1-kb mRNA was identified primarily in mature sperm, consistent with the developmental studies. Shorter mRNAs, thought to be more stable, may compensate for cessation of transcription at late stages of spermatogenesis.
