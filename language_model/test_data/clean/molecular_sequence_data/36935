Ovine interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) c-DNA, obtained by polymerase chain reaction, has been cloned into pTZ18R and pTZ19R. The resulting DNA sequence shows close homology with the bovine sequence. The derived amino-acid sequence shows conserved motifs similar to those observed in all species studied so far. No signal peptide is seen. Northern blots of RNA from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated ovine alveolar macrophages show IL-1 beta m-RNA to be produced earlier than and to be more transient than IL-1 alpha m-RNA. c-DNAs coding for the IL-1 alpha proprotein and IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta mature proteins have been cloned and expressed in the yeast Ty-VLP system as fusion proteins. The resultant IL-1 protein preparations, cleaved from their fusion partners by the action of activated coagulation Factor Xa, are 80-95% pure and show biological activity in standard thymocyte co-mitogen and cartilage degradation assays for IL-1. Some species specificity is observed in that sheep thymocytes are more responsive to ovine rIL-1 than are mouse thymocytes. The presence of a Factor Xa cleavage site in the IL-1 alpha proprotein suggests that Factor Xa may be involved in the processing of ovine IL-1 alpha to its mature form.
