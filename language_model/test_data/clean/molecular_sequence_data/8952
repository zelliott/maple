A nodavirus isolated from red-spotted grouper (Epinephelus akaara) larvae in China has been subjected to genome analysis. The full-length genome sequences of RNA1 and RNA2 were determined, and the 5'-non-coding region (NCR) and 3'NCR sequences were determined by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and 3'RACE. RNA1 is 3,103 nt in length and contains a 982-amino-acid open reading frame (ORF) encoding protein A with a calculated molecular mass of 110.74 kDa. RNA2 is 1,433 nt long and contains a 338-amino-acid major ORF encoding coat protein with a calculated molecular mass of 37.059 kDa. Multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis clearly supported including this virus in the species Redspotted grouper nervous necrosis virus, genus Betanodavirus, family Nodaviridae.
