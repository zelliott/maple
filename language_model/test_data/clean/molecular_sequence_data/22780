In order to evaluate the genetic variability of Porcine parvovirus (PPV), the complete capsid protein sequences (VP1/VP2) from seven recent field isolates from Germany, one isolate from the UK and one German vaccine strain were sequenced and analysed, along with two American (NADL-2 and Kresse), three Asian and 22 Brazilian partial PPV sequences retrieved from GenBank. The analysis revealed a high degree of diversity: 1.2-2.6% at the nucleotide level and 1.2-6.8% at the amino acid level. Phylogenetic analysis defined two German clusters: one formed by four German isolates and the English, Asian and American sequences; and the second, distinct cluster formed by the other three of the seven German isolates examined. The latter cluster was still observed when the 22 partial sequences (853 nt of the 3' terminus of the VP2 gene) from the Brazilian isolates were included in the analyses, indicating that the VP2 sequence determines the phylogeny.
