The genome of the Spanish mild isolate T385 of citrus tristeza virus (CTV) was completely sequenced and compared with the genomes of the severe isolates T36 (Florida), VT (Israel) and SY568 (California). The genome of T385 was 19,259 nt in length, 37 nt shorter than the genome of T36, and 33 and 10 nt longer than those of VT and SY568, respectively, but their organization was identical. T385 had mean nucleotide identities of 81.3, 89.3 and 94% with T36, VT and SY568, respectively. The 3' UTR had over 97% identity in all isolates, whereas the 5' UTR of T385 had 67% identity with VT, 66.3% with SY568 and only 42.5% with T36. In the coding regions, the nucleotide differences between T385 and VT were evenly distributed along the genome (around 90% identity); this was not observed between T385 and the other isolates. T385 and T36 had nucleotide identities around 90% in the eight 3'-terminal ORFs of the genome, but only 72.3% in ORF 1a, a divergence pattern similar to that reported previously for T36 and VT. T385 and SY568 had nucleotide identities close to 90% in the 5'- and 3'-terminal regions of the genome, whereas the central region had over 99% identity. Our data suggest that the central region in the SY568 genome results from RNA recombination between two CTV genomes, one of which was almost identical to T385.
