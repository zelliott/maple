To prepare the allelic ladder materials of three STR loci includes D1S1649, D4S1627, D14S1426, and construct a synchronous detection method by multiplex amplification of the three loci.

Multiplex PCR method, PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and silver staining were applied to detect 120 unrelated Chinese Han population from Chengdu whose allele and gene frequency distributing of these three loci. The electrophoretic bands of the multiplex PCR of these three loci were clear, no overlap of each alleles were observed, and the results were the same with single-locus test results. The results of the multiplex PCR demonstrated that the genotype of these three STR loci in Chengdu Han population in the genotype distribution met with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. 6 alleles (10-15) were detected in D4S1627, 9 alleles(5, 6, 8-14, without 7) were detected in D14S1426, 6 alleles (7-12) were detected in D1S1649.

The results suggested that the multiplex PCR system of these three loci is of practical value in genetic research and forensic identification.
