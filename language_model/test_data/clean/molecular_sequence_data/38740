The decasaccharide sialyl-trimeric-Lewis x is a component of glycoproteins and glycolipids that serve as E- and P-selectin ligands. The synthesis of this target structure was accomplished by utilizing a combination of chemical and enzymatic methods. Highlights of the chemical synthesis include minimal use of protecting groups and regioselective glycosylations to arrive at a linear tri-lactosamine structure. Glycosyltransferase-catalyzed reactions were then employed for the addition of the terminal sialic acid and branch-point fucose residues. Notably, fucosyltransferases V and VI showed different specificities for the sialyl-tri-lactosamine core structure.
