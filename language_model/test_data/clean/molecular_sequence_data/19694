The sheep parapoxvirus orf virus (ORFV) induces acute, pustular skin lesions in humans. ORFV encodes an orthologue of interleukin-10 (IL-10) that, whilst it closely resembles ovine IL-10 (91 % amino acid identity), shows only 75 % amino acid identity to human IL-10 (hIL-10). The anti-inflammatory potential of ORFV IL-10 in human ORFV infection was investigated by examining its immunosuppressive effects on THP-1 monocytes. ORFV IL-10 and hIL-10 were shown to have equivalent inhibitory effects on the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide-activated monocytes, but differed in their abilities to inhibit monocyte proliferation. Structural modelling of ORFV IL-10 revealed differences from hIL-10 in residues predicted to interact with IL-10 co-receptor 2 (IL-10R2), whereas there were very few differences in the residues predicted to interact with IL-10R1. These findings suggest that the partial ability of ORFV IL-10 to inhibit THP-1 monocyte proliferation may be due to the absence of critical residues that mediate the interaction with human IL-10R2.
