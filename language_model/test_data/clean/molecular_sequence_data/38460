DNA sequences of ITS-1 and ITS-2 of rDNA were determined for 16 individual adult males each of Ostertagia gruehneri and Ostertagia arctica from Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) and Eurasian tundra reindeer (R. t. tarandus). Each ITS was virtually identical in O. gruehneri and O. arctica and the three mixed bases detected were shared by both species. Our results strongly suggest that O. gruehneri and O. arctica are dimorphic males of the same species.
