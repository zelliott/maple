Cell surface carbohydrates present on BG01 human embryonic stem cells after 28 days of differentiation were examined using two classes of carbohydrate binding proteins: lectins and antibodies specific for carbohydrate epitopes. Specificity of lectin staining was verified using carbohydrate ligands to block lectin interaction, glycohydrolases to cleave specific sugar residues that are receptors for these proteins, and periodate oxidation to destroy susceptible sugar residues. Specific antibodies were used to identify various tissue types and germ layers present in the 12- and 28-day differentiating embryoid bodies. Results from 12 and 28-day differentiated embryoid bodies were compared to determine changes over time. A slight increase in the sialylation of alpha-GalNAc was seen between 12 and 28 days of differentiation due to the presence of sialyl Tn and/or other sialylated alpha-GalNAc residues. Increases were also observed in GalNAc, the T antigen (Gal beta1,3 GalNAc), and difucosylated LacNAc residues during this time interval. Additionally, some distinct differences in the pattern of lectin staining between 12 and 28 days were observed. Not unexpectedly, the presence of most differentiated cell-types increased during this time period with the exception of neural progenitors, which decreased. Undifferentiated cells, which were prevalent in the 12-day EBs, were undetectable after 28 days. We conclude that several changes in glycosylation occurred during the differentiation of embryonic stem cells, and that these changes may play a role in embryonic development.
