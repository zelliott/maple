Human matrilysin devoid of its propeptide is expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity by heparin chromatography after refolding of the guanidine hydrochloride solubilized protein. Matrilysin autolytically removes its N-terminal tripeptide Met-Tyr-Ser during the refolding process. The enzyme contains 1.91 +/- 0.08 zinc atoms/mol of protein and retains full activity when stored several months at 4 degrees C. It hydrolyzes the fluorescent substrate Dns-PLALWAR at the Ala-Leu bond with a kcat of 3.1 s-1 and K(m) of 1.8 x 10(-5) M at pH 7.5, 37 degrees C, values closely similar to those for the matrilysin produced by activation of the Chinese hamster ovary and E. coli-expressed promatrilysin. The properties of this form of matrilysin demonstrate that the propeptide is not essential for proper folding or stability of the enzyme but likely determines the N-terminal amino acid of the mature enzyme. The pH dependence of kcat/K(m) for Dns-PLALWAR shows that matrilysin has a broad pH optimum (5.0-9.0) and the pKa values obtained are 4.3 and 9.6 at 25 degrees C. The activity is inhibited by several metal binding agents including 1, 10-phenanthroline, OP, but not by the nonchelating isomer, 1,7-phenanthroline. OP inhibits instantaneously by likely forming a transient ternary enzyme.metal.chelator complex. The zinc atom is then removed from the protein in a time-dependent manner. In agreement with the kinetic studies, dialysis in the presence of OP and CaCl2 removes only the catalytic zinc atom. The monozinc enzyme can be reactivated to 90%, 56%, 27%, and 17% of the native activity by addition of zinc, manganese, nickel, and cobalt, respectively. Cadmium, on the other hand, forms an inactive Cd/Zn hybrid. The differences in the chelator accessibility properties of the two zinc sites can thus be exploited to yield metallohybrids of matrilysin.
