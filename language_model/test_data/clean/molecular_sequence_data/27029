The taxonomic status of a Gram-negative-staining bacterium, isolated from the faeces of a seal, was investigated using a polyphasic approach. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that the novel isolate formed a distinct phyletic line within the genus Psychrobacter, displaying >3.3% sequence divergence with other known Psychrobacter species. The generic assignment was confirmed by chemotaxonomic data, which revealed a fatty acid profile that included straight-chain saturated, unsaturated and 3-hydroxylated fatty acids, with C18:1omega9c as the major fatty acid. A ubiquinone with eight isoprene units (Q-8) was the predominant respiratory quinone and spermidine was the predominant polyamine. The novel isolate was distinguished from other members of the genus Psychrobacter by using a set of phenotypic properties. On the basis of phenotypic and phylogenetic considerations, it is proposed that the new isolate represents a novel species, for which the name Psychrobacter lutiphocae sp. nov. is proposed. Strain IMMIB L-1110T (=DSM 21542T=CCUG 56590T) is the type strain.
