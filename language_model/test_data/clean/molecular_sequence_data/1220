In the present study, full length of feline bax, bcl-2, bcl-xL and caspase 3 genes were sequenced and the expression of these mRNAs were also investigated in FIV-infected lymphocytes. The full length cDNA sequence of bax (646 bp), bcl-2 (1423 bp), bcl-xL (1163 bp) and caspase 3 genes (1208 bp) contained a single open reading frame of 579 bp coding 193 amino acids, 708 bp coding 236 amino acids, 702 bp coding 234 amino acids and 834 bp coding 278 amino acids, respectively. Number of apoptotic Kumi-1 cells gradually increased after FIV infection and approximately 70% were apoptotic and 30% were viable in the cells infected with FIV after 8-day incubation, though approximately 80% were non-apoptotic and 20% were dead in non-infected cells. The expression of bcl-2 mRNA in lymphocytes of established cell line was increased by FIV. The amounts of mRNAs of bax, caspase 3 and bcl-xL in FIV-infected cells were not different from those in uninfected control cells.
