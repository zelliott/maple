We tested for measles, mumps, and rubella viruses in multiple sclerosis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Using RNA extracted from 19 multiple sclerosis and 8 control brain specimens, nested PCR was performed after reverse transcription (RT) of the RNA to cDNA using primer pairs directed against two regions in the genomes of measles and mumps viruses and one region in the rubella virus genome. Despite enhanced sensitivity of nested RT PCR, measles, mumps, and rubella viral genomic sequences were not found in any brain specimen.
