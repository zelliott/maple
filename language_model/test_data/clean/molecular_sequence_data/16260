The N-terminal fragment, comprising residues -5 to 55 of herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoprotein D was expressed as a beta-galactosidase fusion protein in Escherichia coli. This gD-fusion protein reacts with monoclonal antibody LP 14 directed against glycoprotein D of HSV. Antisera obtained after immunization of rabbits with purified gD-fusion protein react with HSV-1 gD in a Western blot and with N-terminal synthetic peptides of gD. In addition, these antisera are able to neutralize viral infectivity in vitro.
