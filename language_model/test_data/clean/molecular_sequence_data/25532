The nucleotide sequence of the 5'-flanking region of the mouse k-FGF oncogene has been determined. This sequence extends 2.1 kb upstream from the transcriptional start point (tsp) and includes two Sp1 and two AP-2 consensus binding sequences immediately 5' of the TATA box. In addition, the sequence contains an alternating purine:pyrimidine motif that lies approx. 1 kb upstream from the tsp.
