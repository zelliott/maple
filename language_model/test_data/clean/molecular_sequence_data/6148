The presence of Y chromosome sequences in Ullrich-Turner syndrome (UTS) patients has been suggested in previous work. Karyotype analysis estimated at about 60% of patients with a 45, X constitution and molecular analysis (Southern blot analysis with several Y chromosome probes and PCR of specific sequences) identified the presence of Y chromosome material in about 40% of 45, X patients. We have developed a very sensitive, PCR-based method to detect Y specific sequences in DNA from UTS patients. This protocol permits the detection of a single cell carrying a Y sequence among 10(5) Y-negative cells. We studied 18 UTS patients with 4 Y-specific sequences. In 11 patients we detected a positive amplification for at least one Y sequence. The existence of a simple and sensitive method for the detection of Y sequences has important implications for UTS patients, in view of the risk for some of the females carrying Y-chromosome material of developing gonadoblastoma and virilization. Additionally, some of the UTS associated phenotypes, such as renal anomalies, could be correlated with the presence of Y chromosome specific sequences.
