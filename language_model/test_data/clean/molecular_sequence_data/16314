Sequence analyses show that deletions of 10 and 12 bp occur at homologous sites in a domain that is rich in alternating purines and pyrimidines (Pu/Py) in B42 and EXT, two cloned variants of a complex satellite DNA. A 3-bp deletion occurs 27 bp upstream from the site of the specific deletions in B42 and RU, a third cloned satellite variant that has not suffered the 10-bp deletion. Under torsional stress, the Pu/Py-rich domain adopts a Z-conformation as shown by (i) inhibition of cutting at a BssHII site that accounts for 2/5 of a 15-bp tract of pure Pu/Py in the domain; (ii) binding of polyclonal and monoclonal anti-Z-DNA antibodies to the domain; and (iii) antibody stabilization and subsequent relaxation of the Z-region.
