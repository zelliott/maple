If a number of cytokines and growth factors that have been characterized from human cells were investigated in non-human primates, results from such approaches would allow the development of assays to detect and quantitate cytokines in experimental models. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is an important pluripotent cytokine which plays a crucial role in host defense. As yet, no complete molecular data have been reported for the squirrel monkey TNF-alpha. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were used to trace introns, by comparing product sizes obtained using cDNA and genomic DNA as templates. The genomic DNA is composed of four exons and three introns with 1793 nucleotides. The corresponding cDNA is 702 nucleotides and phylogenetic analysis showed that the Saimiri sciureus was most closely related to that of the genus Aotus, a new-world primate, compared to old-world primates (genus Macaca and Papio). The deduced TNF-alpha protein consists of 233 amino acids with 82% identity to human, 95% to new-world monkeys and 79% to old-world monkeys. The cloned TNF-alpha cDNA will be useful to quantitate TNF-alpha at the mRNA level.
