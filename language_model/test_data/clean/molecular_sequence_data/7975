The 16S rRNA gene sequences of eight Cellulomonas species, two Promicromonospora species, and Jonesia denitrificans were determined, and these sequences were compared with the sequences of about 50 representatives of the Arthrobacter line of descent in the order Actinomycetales. We found that in spite of its current assignment to the family Cellulomonadaceae, J. denitrificans branches outside the radiation of this taxon and cannot be considered a member of it. The two Promicromonospora species do not cluster separately from Cellulomonas species and are more closely related to Cellulomonas species than to each other.
