Islet cell antigen p69 (ICAp69) is a target self-antigen in autoimmune (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Distributed over more than 100 kb on chromosome 6 (6{A1-A2}), the single murine genomic locus contains 14 coding exons, 39-271 bp in length. The identified human and mouse intron-exon junctions are identical, with intron sizes ranging from 94 bp to 24 kb and with conserved flanking region intron sequences. cDNA cloning identified alternatively spliced ICAp69 mRNA transcripts. The predominating alpha-transcripts lack exon 4, while beta-transcripts include this exon, which codes translation termination in all reading frames and a truncated molecule following in vitro expression. gamma-Transcripts show splice removal of exons 8-12, while delta-transcripts exclude exon 11. Transcripts use alternative polyadenylation signals including a less frequent ATTAAA sequence. 5'-Untranslated cDNA and genomic sequencing and long PCR analysis suggest the presence of more noncoding exons. All splice variants encode the conserved T-cell epitope (in exon 2) recognized by autoreactive T cells in diabetic children and diabetes-prone NOD mice.
