A pair of synthetic oligonucleotide primers, designed from the gene encoding a 32-kDa intraerythrocytic piroplasm surface protein of Theileria sergenti, were used to amplify parasite DNA from the blood of T. sergenti-infected cattle by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR-amplified DNA was examined by electrophoresis and by dot blot or microplate hybridization using a parasite-specific cDNA probe. PCR was specific for T. sergenti, since no amplification was detected with DNA from Anaplasma centrale, Babesia ovata, uninfected erythrocytes, and leukocytes. This method was sensitive enough to detect about 4.5 parasites per microliters of blood with a 10-microliters sample volume. Moreover, of 66 specimens from grazing cattle, 40 were microscopically positive, whereas PCR revealed that 54 samples were positive. Therefore, PCR provides a useful diagnostic tool for detecting T. sergenti-infected cattle, and it is significantly more sensitive than the current methods.
