From the results of these studies of the activities of the various EGF receptor mutants we were able to disassociate the ability of EGF to increase intracellular calcium from its ability to induce genes and to cause morphological transformation and growth. These results lead us to the following concept. The kinase domain has a C-terminal border at about residue 957. The remainder of the C-terminus is regulatory. The 164 amino acids from residue 1022 to 1186 constitute an inhibitory region for the kinase. It contributes to ligand-induced internalization because this is reduced in a mutant receptor truncated to residue 1052. Proximally within the C-terminus kinase inhibitory domain is a domain that is required for endocytosis and for raising intracellular calcium that we call the calcium internalization (CAIN) domain. In summary, we have found that the kinase activity of the EGF receptor is required for its function even when all of the self-phosphorylation sites have been removed. The EGF receptor has several distinct cytoplasmic domains that are important for its activity to regulate gene expression, DNA synthesis, and the intracellular calcium level. Biological signaling occurs from the cell surface via essential protein tyrosine kinase activity with ligand-induced internalization serving to abbrogate the biological signal.
