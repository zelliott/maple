The pathogenic effects of HIV may reflect mimicry of several key immunological molecules. The surface glycoprotein of HIV has superantigenic properties responsible for the sequential deletion of T-cell clones. In addition, the glycoprotein has several regions sharing homology with class II MHC products. It can elicit cross-reactive antibodies which block replenishment of these T-cells in the thymus. The usefulness of conventional vaccination strategies in the fight against AIDS has been subject to debate. Based on these considerations, we argue that effective vaccines should avoid viral sequences homologous to class II MHC proteins which might exacerbate this process.
