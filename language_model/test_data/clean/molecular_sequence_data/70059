Chromosome 1 of the inbred mouse strain DBA/2 shows an unusual polymorphism associated with its centromeric satellite DNA sequences. The minor satellite array has undergone amplification and is present as two blocks separated by major satellite sequences. Both minor satellite blocks appear to carry the sequence motif necessary for CENP-B protein binding. Despite this apparent similarity the functional centromere, as defined by the location of CREST antigens, appears to form only within the more terminal block. The two blocks also vary in that sister chromatid association only occurs with this more terminal block.
