In this study, the complete genome sequence of a Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolate collected from an outbreak in 1995 in chickens was fully characterized and compared with other NDV sequences. The genome was found to be 15,192 nucleotides long and to consist of six genes in the order 3'-NP-P-M-F-HN-L-5', similar to other avian paramyxoviruses type-I. However, a six-nucleotide insertion was observed in the 5' non-coding regions of the nucleoprotein (NP) gene, a feature that is unique to some NDV isolates. The isolate shows the amino acid sequence (112)RRQKRF(117) at the cleavage site of the F protein, which is identical to a known motif for virulent pathotypes of NDV. The phylogenetic analysis of the coding region of the F gene indicated that this isolate belongs to genotype VI, more specifically to genotype VId, along with isolates from the other European countries (Denmark, Switzerland and Austria). The same genotype caused outbreaks in the Middle East and Greece in the late 1960s, and in Hungary, in the early 1980s, suggesting a common source for these outbreaks.
