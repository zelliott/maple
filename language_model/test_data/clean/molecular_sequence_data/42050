Using both chromosomal in situ hybridization and molecular techniques, we report the genetic localization of the gene coding for the alpha 1 subunit of the skeletal slow Ca2+ current channel/DHP receptor gene (Cchl1a3) on human Chromosome (Chr) 1 (1q31-1q32 region) and on mouse Chr 1 (region (F-G)). On the basis of single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP-PCR) analysis in an interspecific backcross, we have determined that the Cchl1a3 = mdg (muscular dysgenesis) locus is very closely linked to the myogenin (Myog) locus.
