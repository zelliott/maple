The structure of a peptide from the transforming region (residues 4-20) of the p21 protein has been determined using two-dimensional NMR. In the normal protein, this segment contains a Gly residue at the critical 12 position; any substitution, other than Pro, at this position results in a transforming protein. Previously performed energy calculations indicated that this peptide segment is a structured one. In this study we find that the Asp12 containing peptide has a surprisingly well-defined structure in solution which has more similarity to the GDP-binding loop region in EF-tu than to that in p21.
