Multiplex hybridization reactions of perfectly matched duplexes and duplexes containing a single basepair mismatch (SNPs) were investigated on DNA microarrays. Effects of duplex length, G-C percentage, and relative position of the SNP on duplex hybridization and SNP resolution were determined. Our theoretical model of multiplex hybridization accurately predicts observed results and implicates target concentration as a critical variable in multiplex SNP detection.
