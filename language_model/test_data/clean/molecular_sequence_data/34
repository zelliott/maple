Heparanase (HPSE) is an endoglycosidase that specifically degrades heparan sulfate, which is an abundant glycosaminoglycan of the pig placenta. The aim of the present study was to clone cDNA encoding porcine HPSE and characterise the expression level and localisation of HPSE mRNA in porcine placentas throughout gestation. Placental tissues were collected from litters on Days 25, 45, 65, 85 and 105 of gestation. Three transcript variants similar to HPSE were identified in the pig placenta. In addition, the HPSE gene was mapped to pig chromosome 8 in close proximity to quantitative trait loci for litter size and prenatal survival. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridisation were used to characterise the expression of two HPSE variants, namely HPSE v1 and v2, in the pig placenta throughout gestation. The expression of HPSE v1 and v2 was elevated (P < 0.01) in placentas during very early gestation (Day 25) as well as during late gestation (Days 85 and 105). Finally, HPSE v1 and v2 mRNA were localised to the cuboidal trophoblast cells of the folded bilayer located nearest to the maternal endometrium. These findings illustrate that HPSE likely plays a role in the development and modification of the pig placenta, which has implications for litter size and prenatal survival.
