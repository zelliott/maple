Two novel marine, Gram-negative, non-motile, catalase- and oxidase-positive, aerobic bacteria were isolated from coastal seawater in Tokyo Bay. Analysis of almost-complete 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the two isolates are members of the genus Paracoccus, sharing highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (96.5 %) with Paracoccus aminophilus NBRC 16710(T). The DNA-DNA reassociation values between P. aminophilus NBRC 16710(T) and these isolates were only 10-20 %, in contrast to the high DNA relatedness between the two isolates (89 %). At least 1 % (w/v) NaCl was required for growth. Cellular fatty acid profiles revealed C(18 : 1)omega7c as the major component and C(10 : 0) 3-OH as the major hydroxy fatty acid. Ubiquinone-10 was detected as the major respiratory quinone. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of both strains was 69 mol%. On the basis of DNA-DNA hybridization data and physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, it is proposed that these strains should be placed in a novel species, Paracoccus marinus sp. nov. The type strain is KKL-A5(T) (=NBRC 100637(T) =CIP 108500(T)); KKL-B9 (=NBRC 100640) is a reference strain.
