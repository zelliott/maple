The 5' upstream region of a chicken MHC class I gene BF-IV contains sequence motifs similar to the interferon consensus sequences (ICS) contained in promoters of many mammalian interferon-regulated genes. To study a possible functional role of this putative chicken ICS, an oligonucleotide spanning the upstream sequences of the BF-IV gene (-174/-194) was cloned singly or in multiple copies before the herpes TK promoter controlling the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene (pBLCAT2). Transient expression studies performed with primary chicken fibroblasts (CEF) showed that the chicken ICS represses constitutive promoter activity. The chicken ICS, however, enhanced CAT activity up to 20-fold following treatment with chicken interferon (IFN). Deletion analysis of the BF-IV promoter also confirms that the upstream DNA sequences (-174/-194) contain a functional ICS recognized by chicken interferon. The murine ICS of the H2-Ld gene was also activated by chicken interferon when introduced into CEF. IFN activation of chicken ICS containing reporters was also observed in transformed chicken fibroblast lines. We show that the chicken ICS binds two specific nuclear factors present in chicken fibroblasts which are induced by interferon. These factors were also capable of recognizing the mouse ICS, suggesting the conservation of a relevant DNA-binding protein. Taken together, these data indicate that the chicken ICS motif contained in a sequence from -174 to -194 of the BF-IV gene acts as a strong interferon-response element, which has been functionally conserved during about 270 million years of separate evolution of mammals and birds.
