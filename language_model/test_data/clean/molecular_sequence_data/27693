The amino acid sequence of rat ribosomal protein L37a was deduced from the sequence of nucleotides in recombinant cDNAs isolated in Yamagata and in Chicago and confirmed from the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein. Ribosomal protein L37a contains 91 amino acids (the NH2-terminal methionine is removed after translation of the mRNA) and has a molecular mass of 10143 Da.
