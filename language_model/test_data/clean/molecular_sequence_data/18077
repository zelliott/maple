A new nodule-specific gene, Nms-25 (nodulin-25), was identified in cDNA clones isolated from a nodule-specific cDNA library of Medicago sativa. The first transcript of this gene appeared 9 days after inoculation of the roots with Rhizobium meliloti. The time of expression and the quantity of the transcripts of the Nms-25 gene was similar to that of leghemoglobin genes suggesting a similar regulation. A protein of 246 amino acids could be deduced from a full-length cDNA clone. The first 24 amino acids at the N-terminal end of this protein formed a signal sequence which might direct membrane transport into the peribacteroid space. Using different predictive methods the signal sequence cleaved protein was tentatively predicted to be a water-soluble enzyme, but not hydrolase.
