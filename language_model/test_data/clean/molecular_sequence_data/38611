The crustacean eyestalk CHH/MIH/GIH neurohormone gene family represents a unique group of neuropeptides identified mainly in crustaceans. In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of the cDNA and the gene encoding the hyperglycemic hormone (MeCHH-B) of the shrimp Metapenaeus ensis. The amino acid sequence of MeCHH-B shows 85% identity to that of MeCHH-A (formerly MeCHH-like neuropeptide). Two separate but identical MeCHH-B genes were identified in the genome of shrimp by library screening and they are located on different CHH gene clusters. The organization of the MeCHH-B gene is identical to other members of the CHH/MIH/GIH neurohormone family. MeCHH-B is expressed at a constant level in the eyestalks of juveniles and mature females. Unlike the MeCHH-A gene, a low level of MeCHH-B transcripts can also be detected in the central nervous system. Interestingly, the expression pattern of MeCHH-B in the eyestalk of vitellogenic females is reversed to that of the MeCHH-A gene. At the middle stage of gonad maturation, a minimum level of MeCHH-B transcript was recorded and a maximum level of MeCHH-A transcript was detected. Recombinant proteins for MeCHH-A and MeCHH-B were produced by a bacterial expression system. The hemolymph glucose level of bilaterally eyestalk-ablated shrimp increased two-fold 1 h after the rCHH injection and then returned to normal after 2 h. The hyperglycemic effect of these fusion proteins is comparable to that of de-stalked shrimp injected with crude extract from a single sinus gland.
