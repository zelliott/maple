Two integral membrane proteins, MP28 and MP23, were found in protein bodies isolated from pumpkin (Cucurbita sp.) seeds. Molecular characterization revealed that both MP28 and MP23 belong to the seed TIP (tonoplast intrinsic protein) subfamily. The predicted 29 kDa precursor to includes six putative membrane-spanning domains, and the loop between the first and second transmembrane domains is larger than that of MP28. The N-terminal sequence of the mature MP23 starts from residue 66 in the first loop, indicating that an N-terminal 7 kDa fragment that contains one transmembrane domain is post-translationally removed. During maturation of pumpkin seeds, mRNAs for MP28 and MP23 became detectable in cotyledons at the early stage, and their levels increased slightly until a rapid decrease occurred at the late stage. This is consistent with the accumulation of the 29 kDa precursor and MP28 in the cotyledons at the early stage. By contrast, MP23 appeared at the late stage simultaneously with the disappearance of the 29 kDa precursor. Thus, it seems possible that the conversion of the 29 kDa precursor to the mature MP23 might occur in the vacuoles after the middle stage of seed maturation. Both proteins were localized immunocytochemically on the membranes of the vacuoles at the middle stage and the protein bodies at the late stage. These results suggest that both MP28 and the precursor to MP23 accumulate on vacuolar membranes before the deposition of storage proteins, and then the precursor is converted to the mature MP23 at the late stage. These two TIPs might have a specific function during the maturation of pumpkin seeds.
