The dissimilatory reduction of sulfate contributes to the retention of sulfur in acidic mineratrophic peatlands. Novel sulfate-reducing prokaryotes (SRPs) colonize these low-sulfate fens. This study assessed the community structures of SRPs in a depth gradient (0-50 cm) in a fen, located in the Fichtelgebirge (Spruce Mountains), Germany. Detection of SRPs with multiplex (terminal-) restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of amplified dissimilatory (bi)sulfite reductase genes (dsrAB) separated three subgroups derived from (i) the upper 5 and 10 cm, (ii) 15-25 cm, and (iii) 30-50 cm depth. Biogeochemical parameters measured in the soil solution from July 2001 to July 2004 documented that the upper 5-10 cm were exposed to drying and oxygenation prior to sampling. Periodic oxygenation reached a maximum depth of 25 cm in the water-saturated fen and was concomitant with relative high concentrations of nitrate (120 microM) and sulfate (up to 310 microM). The fen soil was permanently anoxic below 30 cm depth with average concentrations of sulfate below 40 microM and maximum concentrations of methane. Cloning of dsrAB PCR products from 5, 20 and 40 cm depth yielded a total of 84 unique dsrAB restriction patterns. Partial sequencing of 61 distinct clones resulted in 59 unique partial protein sequences that mainly clustered with DsrA sequences of uncultivated sulfate reducers. Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans- and Syntrophobacter wolinii-related bacteria appeared to be present only in 40 cm depth. Differences in the SRP community structures suggested that SRPs present in the upper fen soil have to tolerate O(2) and even drying, whereas SRPs present in deep anoxic zones may act as syntrophic fermentors in cooperation with H(2)-utilizing methanogens.
