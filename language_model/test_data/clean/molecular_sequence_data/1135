MutY homolog (MUTYH) excises adenine opposite 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) in DNA, thus preventing occurrence of G:C to T:A transversion. In cell-free extract prepared from the thymocytes of wild type but not MUTYH-null mice, adenine opposite 8-oxoG in DNA was excised by MUTYH, however, the generated apurinic (AP) site opposite 8-oxoG mostly remained unincised. Recombinant mouse MUTYH (mMUTYH) efficiently excised adenine opposite 8-oxoG and prevented mouse AP endonuclease (mAPEX1) from incising the generated AP site. In contrast, an AP site opposite 8-oxoG created by uracil DNA glycosylase or tetrahydrofuran opposite 8-oxoG was efficiently incised by mAPEX1 in the presence of an excess amount of mMUTYH. Mutant mMUTYH with R361A or G365D substitution, excised adenine opposite 8-oxoG as efficiently as did wild-type mMUTYH, but failed to prevent mAPEX1 from incising the generated AP site. Wild-type mMUTYH bound duplex oligonucleotides containing A:8-oxoG pair with a lower apparent K(d) than that of the mutants, and prevented OGG1 from excising 8-oxoG opposite adenine or the generated AP site. The G365D mutant failed to prevent OGG1 from excising 8-oxoG opposite the generated AP site, thus indicating that the protection of its own product by mMUTYH is an intrinsic function which depends on the C-terminal domain of mMUTYH.
