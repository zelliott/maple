The levels of thermal hysteresis (antifreeze activity) produced by purified antifreeze proteins (DAFPs) from the larvae of the beetle Dendroides canadensis at endogenous concentrations are lower than what are present in the hemolymph of overwintering larvae. Thermal hysteresis activity of DAFPs is dependent not only on AFP concentration but also on the presence of enhancers that may be either proteins (including other hemolymph DAFPs) or low-molecular mass enhancers such as glycerol. The purpose of this study was to identify endogenous protein enhancers using yeast two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation, and finally the enhancement of antifreeze activity. Here we show that a thaumatin-like protein from D. canadensis, until recently known only from plants, significantly enhances the thermal hysteresis of DAFP-1 and -2. Glycerol can further this enhancement, presumably by promoting the interaction of the DAFPs and thaumatin-like protein.
