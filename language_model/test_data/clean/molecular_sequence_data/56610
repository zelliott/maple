Three genes for the subunits of the NADH dehydrogenase (nad5, nad4, and nad2) are tandemly clustered on the liverwort mitochondrial genome. Their gene products showed high levels of amino acid sequence identity with the corresponding subunits from higher plant mitochondria (82.8-84.4%), and significant levels of identity with those from liverwort chloroplast (32.0-33.5%). Podospora anserina mitochondria (21.4-45.9%), and human mitochondria (18.4-27.9%). In addition, these three subunits from liverwort mitochondria have conserved amino acid residues in their central regions. The gene nad5 is interrupted by a 672 bp group I intron, while genes nad4 and nad2 are interrupted by group II introns of 899 bp and 1418 bp, respectively. Northern blot analysis using exon-intron specific probes indicated that these three genes are transcribed as a single precursor mRNA of 9.6 kb in length and are processed into mature mRNA molecules in liverwort mitochondria. Several regions of this nad gene cluster are repeated in the liverwort mitochondrial genome.
