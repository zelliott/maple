The B800-820 peripheral light-harvesting complex, an integral membrane protein from Rhodopseudomonas acidophila strain 7050, has been crystallized in a form suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis. The crystals belong to space group R32 with hexagonal cell dimensions a = 117.20, c = 295.14 A (at 100 K). A complete 2.8 A resolution data set has been collected and a structure solution obtained using molecular-replacement methods.
