We have isolated the entire gene coding for human lysyl oxidase. Coding and untranslated domains of human lysyl oxidase mRNA were found in 7 exons, distributed throughout approximately 14 kb of human genomic DNA. The appearance of exon sequences in lysyl oxidase mRNA in several human tissues was determined using a reverse transcriptase - PCR assay. In contrast to a previous report, this analysis has unambiguously shown that the size heterogeneity of lysyl oxidase mRNA was not due to alternate usage of any of the exons of the lysyl oxidase gene. Moreover, DNA sequence analysis of the entire 3.8 kb 3'-untranslated region (UTR) within exon 7 revealed multiple poly-adenylation sites which were shown to be differentially expressed in human skin fibroblasts. This differential usage of polyadenylation sites within the 3'-UTR explains the appearance of multiple lysyl oxidase mRNAs of different sizes.
