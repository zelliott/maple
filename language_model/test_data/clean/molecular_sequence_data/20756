The combined sequences encoding a partial and putative rpsI open reading frame (ORF), non-coding (NC) region, a putative ORF for the Campylobacter adhesin to fibronectin-like protein (cadF), a putative Cla_0387 ORF, NC region and a partial and putative Cla_0388 ORF, were identified in 16 Campylobacter lari isolates, using two novel degenerate primer pairs. Probable consensus sequence at the -35 and -10 regions were identified in all C. lari isolates, as a promoter.

Thus, cadF (-like) gene is highly conserved among C. lari organisms. Transcription of the cadF (-like) gene in C. lari cells in vivo was also confirmed and the transcription initiation site was determined. A peptidoglycan-associating alpha-helical motif in the C-terminal regions of some bacterial cell-surface proteins was completely conserved amongst the putative cadF (-like) ORFs from the C. lari isolates.

The putative cadF (-like) ORFs from all C. lari isolates were nine amino acid larger than those from C. jejuni, and showed amino acid residues 137 -140 of FALG (50% identity), instead of the FRLS residues of the maximal fibronectin-binding activity site demonstrated within C. jejuni CadF. A neighbor joining tree constructed based on cadF (-like) gene sequence information formed a major cluster consisting of C. lari isolates, separating from the other three thermophilic campylobacters.
