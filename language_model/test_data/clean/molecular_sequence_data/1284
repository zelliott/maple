Most of the known prohead maturation proteases in double-stranded-DNA bacteriophages are shown, by computational methods, to fall into two evolutionarily independent clans of serine proteases, herpesvirus assemblin-like and ClpP-like. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that these two types of phage prohead protease genes displaced each other multiple times while preserving their exact location within the late operons of the phage genomes.
