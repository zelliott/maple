A deficiency of the enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) is the cause of Hunter syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type II). Here, we report a study of the human IDS locus at Xq28. An unexpected finding was an IDS-related region (IDS2) which is located on the telomeric side of the IDS gene within 80 kb. We have identified sequences in this locus that are homologous to exons 2 and 3 as well as sequences homologous to introns 2, 3 and 7 of the IDS gene. The exon 3 sequences in the IDS gene and in the IDS2 locus showed 100% identity. The overall identities of the other identified regions were 96%. A locus for DXS466 was also found to be located close to IDS2. The existence of the IDS2 locus complicates the diagnosis of mutations in genomic DNA from patients with Hunter syndrome. However, information about the IDS2 locus makes it possible to analyze the IDS gene and the IDS2 locus separately after PCR amplification.
