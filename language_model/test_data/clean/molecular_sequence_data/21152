NCU04379 gene encodes a conserved Ca(2+) and/or calmodulin binding protein that possesses a consensus signal for N-terminal myristoylation and four EF-hands, characteristics of Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1proteins. The NCU04379.2 knockout mutant shows slow growth rate, increased sensitivity to calcium and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, and a wild-type fragment carrying NCU04379 gene complements the mutant. Therefore, NCU04379 gene has a role in growth, calcium stress tolerance, and UV survival. Crosses homozygous for Î”NCU04379.2 mutant strains were fully fertile; however, we found evidence for involvement of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase encoding genes NCU02283 and NCU09123 in sexual development.
