Recent work has suggested that important B- and T-cell epitopes on the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) of Plasmodium vivax lie external to the major repeat regions of the protein. We have studied two naturally exposed human populations (Caucasian and Papua New Guineans) and determined the antibody response to yeast-derived recombinant CSPs, overlapping synthetic peptides spanning amino acids 76 348 of the Belem P. vivax CSP and overlapping peptides representing the variant repeats of the VK247 strain of P. vivax. We have demonstrated that the P. vivax CSP-specific antibody response is directed towards areas within the repeat region as well as areas external to this; but the dominant epitopes recognized by the two populations studied, were distinct. One epitope, lying external to the repeats and recognized by both populations, partially overlaps an area of the protein referred to as region II-plus. Sera from malaria-exposed Papua New Guineans and Thais contained antibodies to this epitope (V22, single letter amino acid sequence TCGVGVRVRRRVNAANKKPE) which were capable of recognizing sporozoites, as determined by quantitative inhibition IFA. Seventeen percent of PNG sera had antibodies to this peptide compared with 33% who had antibodies to the central repeats of the protein. Immunization of mice with recombinant CSP did not induce antibodies to V22. However, immunization with overlapping peptide epitopes representing this region (V21 or V22) induced specific antibodies but only two sera recognized both V21 and V22 and, by inference, the overlapping peptide sequence (TCGVGVRVRR). Antibodies in these two sera could bind recombinant CSP in ELISA; however, in contrast, nine sera which recognized either V21 or V22 alone did not bind CSP. Only one of two sera containing antibodies recognizing CSP stained P. vivax sporozoites. This serum also recognized an epitope dependent upon two amino acids aminoterminal to V22. These data suggest that the fine specificity of antibodies is a critical determinant for binding to both recCSP and sporozoites.
