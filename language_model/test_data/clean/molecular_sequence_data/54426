Naive T cells encountering their cognate antigen become activated and acquire the ability to proliferate in response to cytokines. Stat5 is an essential component in this response. We demonstrate that Stat5 cannot access DNA in naive T cells and acquires this ability only after T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement. The transition is not associated with changes in DNA methylation or global histone modification but rather chromatin decondensation. Condensation occurs during thymocyte development and proper condensation is dependent on kleisin-Î² of the condensin II complex. Our findings suggest that this unique chromatin condensation, which can affect interpretations of chromatin accessibility assays, is required for proper T-cell development and maintenance of the quiescent state. This mechanism ensures that cytokine driven proliferation can only occur in the context of TCR stimulation.
