Scrapie is a prion disease affecting sheep and goats. Susceptibility to this neurodegenerative disease shows polygenic variance. The involvement of the laminin receptor (LRP/LR) in the metabolism and propagation of prions has previously been demonstrated. In the present work, the ovine laminin receptor gene (RPSA) was isolated, characterized, and mapped to ovine chromosome OAR19q13. Real-time RT-PCR revealed a significant decrease in RPSA mRNA in cerebellum after scrapie infection. Conversely, no differences were detected in other brain regions such as diencephalon and medulla oblongata. Association analysis showed that a polymorphism reflecting the presence of a RPSA pseudogene was overrepresented in a group of sheep resistant to scrapie infection. No amino acid change in the LRP/LR protein was found in the 126 sheep analyzed. However, interesting amino acid positions (241, 272, and 290), which could participate in the species barrier to scrapie and maybe to other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, were identified by comparing LRP/LR sequences from various mammals with variable levels of resistance to scrapie.
