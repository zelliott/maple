Pseudolysin, the extracellullar elastase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (EC: 3.4.24.26) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa infections. In the present study, molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical affinity predictions were used to gain molecular insight into pseudolysin inhibition. Four low molecular weight inhibitors were docked at their putative binding sites and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed for 5.0 ns, and the free energy of binding was calculated by the linear interaction energy method. The number and the contact surface area of stabilizing hydrophobic, aromatic, and hydrogen bonding interactions appears to reflect the affinity differences between the inhibitors. The proteinaceous inhibitor, Streptomyces metalloproteinase inhibitor (SMPI) was docked in three different binding positions and MD simulations were performed for 3.0 ns. The MD trajectories were used for molecular mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann surface area analysis of the three binding positions. Computational alanine scanning of the average pseudolysin-SMPI complexes after MD revealed residues at the pseudolysin-SMPI interface giving the main contribution to the free energy of binding. The calculations indicated that SMPI interacts with pseudolysin via the rigid active site loop, but that also contact sites outside this loop contribute significantly to the free energy of association.
