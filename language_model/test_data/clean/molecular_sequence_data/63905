Recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vectors expressing equine influenza virus genes were constructed and evaluated for use in equine vaccination. Two strains of recombinant MVA, expressing either hemagglutinin (HA) or nucleoprotein (NP) genes were constructed. Each influenza virus gene was cloned from A/equine/Kentucky/1/81 (Eq/Ky) into an MVA construction plasmid, and was introduced to the deletion III locus of the wild type MVA genome by homologous recombination. Recombinant viruses were plaque purified, and antigen expression was confirmed by immunostaining. Two ponies were primed by vaccination with 50 microg HA-DNA and two ponies were vaccinated with 50 microg NP-DNA using the PowderJect XR research device. Six and 10 weeks later, ponies were immunized with 2 x 10(9) infectious units of recombinant MVA encoding the homologous influenza antigen, equally divided between intramuscular and intradermal sites in the neck. A marked rise in influenza virus-specific IgGa and IgGb serum antibody titers was detected following administration of MVA boosters with both HA and NP antigens. Influenza virus-specific lymphoproliferative responses and IFN-gamma mRNA production were also strongly elicited by both antigens. This study demonstrates the facility with which recombinant MVA viruses expressing defined pathogen genes can be constructed, and provides preliminary evidence of the immunogenicity and safety of these vectors in the horse.
