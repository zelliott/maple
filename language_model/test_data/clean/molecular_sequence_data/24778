Polyketide synthases (PKS) produce an array of natural products with different biological activities and pharmacological properties by varying the starter and extender molecules that form the final polyketide. Recent studies of the simplest PKS, the chalcone synthase (CHS)-like enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids, anthocyanin pigments, and antimicrobial phytoalexins, have yielded insight on the molecular basis of this biosynthetic versatility. Understanding the structure-function relationship in these PKS provides a foundation for manipulating polyketide formation and suggests strategies for further increasing the scope of polyketide biosynthetic diversity.
