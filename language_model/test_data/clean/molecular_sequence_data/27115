The one-carbon response regulon is essential for the biosynthesis of nucleic acids as well as several amino acids. The ADE3 gene is known to encode a crucial one-carbon regulon enzyme, tetrahydrofolate synthase, which is involved in the biosynthesis of purine and the amino acids methionine and glycine. Therefore, the mechanism through which ADE3 transcription is regulated appears to be critical for the cross-talk among these metabolic pathways. Even so, the direct involvement of ADE3 transcription through gene-specific transcription factors has not been shown clearly. In this study, the promoter structure of the ADE3 gene was investigated in detail, and a genuine Gcn4p responsive element (GCRE) was confirmed among three putative GCRE elements in vivo and in vitro. Through gene deletion studies of Gcn4p and Bas1p, it was established that both factors are involved in the transcriptional regulation of the ADE3 gene. Direct binding to this GCRE and the occupancy of the ADE3 promoter by these factors were also confirmed. Taking these results together, we concluded that Gcn4p is responsible for the basal and inducible expression of the ADE3 gene, while Bas1p is required for its basal expression.
