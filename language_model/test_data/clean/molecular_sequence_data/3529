A model of the carbohydrate recognition domain of the serum form of mannose-binding protein (MBP) from rat complexed with methyl 3,6-di-O-(alpha-D-mannopyranosyl)-alpha-D-mannopyranoside is presented. Allowed conformations for the bound sugar were derived from simulated annealing protocols incorporating distance restraints computed from transferred NOESY spectra. The resulting sugar conformations were then modeled into the MBP binding site, and these models of the complex were refined using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the presence of solvent water. These studies indicate that only one of the two major conformations of the alpha(1-->6) linkage found in solution is significantly populated in the bound state (omega = 60 degrees ), whereas the alpha(1-->3) linkage samples at least two states, similar to its behavior in free solution. The bound conformation allows direct hydrogen bonds to form between the sugar and K182 of MBP, in addition to other water-mediated hydrogen bonds. Estimates of binding constants of candidate complexes based on changes in solvent-accessible surface areas upon binding support the NMR and MD results. These estimates further suggest that the enthalpic gains of the additional sugar-MBP interactions in a trisaccharide as opposed to a monosaccharide are offset by entropic penalties, offering an explanation for previous binding data.
