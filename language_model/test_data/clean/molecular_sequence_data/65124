The homeodomain-containing protein Hex acts as an activator as well as a repressor of transcription in animals. While its repression domain has been mapped to the amino-terminal region, the activation domain has never been identified. Here, we show that the homeodomain and the acidic carboxyl-terminal region are necessary for full activation of the sodium-dependent bile acid cotransporter gene promoter in a cell type-independent manner, suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal region comprising residues 197 to 271 functions as the activation domain. In addition, we observed that a Hex mutant without this activation domain acts as a dominant-negative mutant as to the transactivating function of Hex.
