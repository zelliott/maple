This report describes a detailed mutational analysis of a major histocompatibility complex class II molecule--the alpha chain of the Ak complex. Each residue from 50-79 was replaced by an alanine, and the effects on recognition of Ak by panels of antibodies and T cells determined. The results provide the strongest existing experimental evidence that the antigen binding site on a class II molecule can be modelled on the crystal structure of a class I molecule. The data have also permitted the delineation of residues that actually contact antigenic peptides.
