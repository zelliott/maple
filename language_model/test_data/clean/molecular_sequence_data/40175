Martentoxin is a peptide of 37 amino acid residues purified from the venom of the Chinese scorpion Buthus martensi Karch, which has been demonstrated to be an inhibitor of voltage-dependent sodium channel and voltage-dependent delayed rectifier potassium channel. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of this interaction, the structure of martentoxin was studied by 2D-NMR. The secondary structure of martentoxin consists of a triple-stranded beta-sheet connected to a alpha-helical structure. This helix encompasses 10 residues from Ser11 to Lys20. The three strands of beta-sheet probably comprise residues Gly2-Asp5, Q27-N30 and Glu33-Cys36, Cys30-Asn33 with a type I'beta turn centered on Asn31-Asn32. The results indicate that martentoxin possesses the conserved beta alpha beta beta structure of all the potassium channel toxins.
