Bromoviral templates for plus-strand RNA synthesis are rich in A or U nucleotides in comparison to templates for minus-strand RNA synthesis. Previous studies demonstrated that plus-strand RNA synthesis by the brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNA replicase is more efficient if the template contains an A/U-rich template sequence near the initiation site (K. Sivakumaran and C. C. Kao, J. Virol. 73:6415-6423, 1999). These observations led us to examine the effects of nucleotide changes near the template's initiation site on the accumulation of BMV RNA3 genomic minus-strand, genomic plus-strand, and subgenomic RNAs in barley protoplasts transfected with wild-type and mutant BMV transcripts. Mutations in the template for minus-strand synthesis had only modest effects on BMV replication in barley protoplasts. Mutants with changes to the +3, +5, and +7 template nucleotides accumulated minus-strand RNA at levels similar to the the wild-type level. However, mutations at positions adjacent to the initiation cytidylate in the templates for genomic and subgenomic plus-strand RNA synthesis significantly decreased RNA accumulation. For example, changes at the third template nucleotide for plus-strand RNA3 synthesis resulted in RNA accumulation at between 18 and 24% of the wild-type level, and mutations in the third template nucleotide for subgenomic RNA4 resulted in accumulations at between 7 and 14% of the wild-type level. The effects of the mutations generally decreased as the mutations occurred further from the initiation nucleotide. These findings demonstrate that there are different requirements of the template sequence near the initiation nucleotide for BMV RNA accumulation in plant cells.
