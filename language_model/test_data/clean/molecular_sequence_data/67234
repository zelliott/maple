CMTM/CKLFSF is a novel family of proteins linking chemokines and TM4SF. In humans, these proteins are encoded by nine genes, CKLF and CMTM1-8/CKLFSF1-8. Here we report the characteristics and expression profile of CMTM3/CKLFSF3. Human CMTM3/CKLFSF3 has a high sequence identity among various species and similar characteristics as its mouse and rat homologues. Established by results both of RT-PCR and Quantitative Real-time PCR, the gene is highly transcribed in testis, leukocytes and spleen. For further verification, we generated a polyclonal antibody against human CMTM3/CKLFSF3 and found that the protein is highly expressed in the testis and some cells of PBMCs. Therefore, CMTM3/CKLFSF3 is an evolutionarily conserved gene that may have important roles in the male reproductive system and immune system. Further studies are necessary to validate its functions in the two systems.
