Human minisatellite B6.7 is a highly variable locus showing extensive heterozygosity with alleles ranging from six to >500 repeat units. Paternal and maternal mutation rates to new length alleles were estimated from pedigrees at 7.0 and 3.9% per gamete, respectively, indicating that B6.7 is one of the most unstable minisatellites isolated to date. Mutation at this locus was also analysed by small pool PCR of sperm and blood DNA. Male germline instability varied from <0.8 to 14% per allele and increased with tandem array size. In contrast, the frequency of mutants in somatic (blood) DNA was far lower (<0.5%), consistent with a meiotic origin of germline mutants. Sperm mutants were further characterized by minisatellite variant repeat mapping using four major polymorphic sites within the B6.7 repeats. This highly informative system revealed a wide variety of changes in allele structure, including simple intra-allelic duplications and deletions and more complicated inter- and intra-allelic transfers of repeat blocks, as seen at other human minisatellites. The main mode of sperm mutation, however, resulted in extremely complex allele reorganization with evidence of inter-allelic transfer plus the generation of novel repeats by rearrangement at the sub-repeat level, suggesting that recombinational instability at B6.7 is a complex multistep process.
