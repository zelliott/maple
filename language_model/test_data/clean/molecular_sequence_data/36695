The distribution of HLA-A, B, C, DR and DRB1, DQB1, DPB1 alleles was studied in 60 Japanese patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS) using serologic and genomic analysis. We found significant associations with HLA-Cw3 (p = 0.002, pc = 0.012, RR = 3.2), DR2 (p = 0.007, RR = 2.6), and DQB1*0602 (p = 0.04, RR = 4.0) in Japanese patients for the first time. The combined presence of Cw3 and DR2 gave a higher risk than each antigen alone. The reported increase in the frequency of DPw4 in Japanese MS patients [12] could not be confirmed by our genomic study. The frequencies of all of the residues in each variable region of the amino acid sequences of DQ beta and DP beta chains were not different between the MS patients and the controls. These results suggest that MS susceptibility may result from polygenic influences and from the presence of environmental factors.
