Inducible maltose fermentation by Saccharomyces carlesbergensis requires the product of the MAL63 gene of the MAL6 locus. It has been suggested that this gene product is an activator protein controlling the expression of the structural genes encoding the maltose fermentative enzymes perhaps by binding to DNA sequences upstream of these genes. We report the sequence of the MAL63 gene. A single open reading frame is seen capable of encoding a protein of 470 amino acid residues. The deduced sequence of this protein indicates that it is a cysteine-zinc finger protein supporting the hypothesis that the MAL63 gene product is a DNA binding protein.
