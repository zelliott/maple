The polyhedrin gene of the nuclear polyhedrosis virus of the silkmoth Bombyx mori (BmNPV) has been subjected to deletion mutagenesis. A number of clones containing partially deleted polyhedrin genes were characterized and four clones containing limited deletions of the 5'-untranslated or 5'-flanking sequences of the gene were further analyzed with respect to polyhedrin promoter activity. The functional characterization of the deletion mutants was achieved through the insertion of a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene (cat) into each deletion junction. The resultant cat constructs were introduced into the genome of BmNPV through homologous recombination and the effect of each deletion on the activity of the polyhedrin promoter was evaluated by measurements of CAT enzymatic activity in extracts of tissue culture cells infected with the corresponding recombinant BmNPVs as well as by primer extension assays. Removal of the entire leader region and eleven adjacent residues of the 5'-flanking sequences of the polyhedrin gene results in a dramatic decrease in promoter activity, which, however, remains detectable through CAT activity measurements. Elimination of an additional 30 nucleotides (nt) of the upstream sequences results in the complete inactivation of the polyhedrin promoter. The functional characterization of a deletion mutant lacking 41 nt of the 5'-flanking sequences has demonstrated that no functions necessary for viral infectivity, replication or assembly are disrupted by this deletion, since the corresponding recombinant viruses propagate in the cells with the same kinetics and to the same extent as wild-type BmNPV. As a result of the deletion mutagenesis, two classes of transfer vectors have become available. The first class can be used for introducing into the viral genome foreign nucleotide sequences under polyhedrin promoter control, while the second one can be used for obtaining recombinant viruses harboring foreign genetic material in an environment which is devoid of polyhedrin promoter activity.
