We identified a temperature-sensitive mutant of the plant pathogenic fungus Ustilago maydis that is defective in the polar distribution of cell wall components and shows abnormal morphology. The affected gene, yup1, was cloned by complementation. It encodes a putative target soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor (t-SNARE), suggesting a function in membrane fusion. A Yup1-GFP fusion protein localized to vesicles that showed rapid saltatory motion along microtubules. These vesicles are part of the endocytic pathway and accumulate at sites of active growth, thereby supporting the expansion of the hyphal tip. In yup1(ts) cells, endocytosis is impaired and accumulation of Yup1-carrying endosomes at cell poles is abolished, resulting in apolar distribution of wall components and morphological alterations. This suggests that a membrane recycling process via early endosomes supports polar growth of U. maydis.
