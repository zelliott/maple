We have isolated and determined the nucleotide sequences for cDNA clones encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) from the medfly Ceratitis capitata. The derived amino acid sequences for G6PD and 6PGD are presented and compared with G6PDs and 6PGDs from other species. The codon usage of the cDNA clones has little bias with the notable exceptions of arginine, glycine and leucine. The chromosomal location of the genes for 6PGD and G6PD were determined by in situ hybridization to salivary gland polytene chromosomes. This localization orients a genetic map of enzymatic loci and illustrates a remarkable similarity in the intra chromosomal order of homologous genes between Drosophila melanogaster and medfly.
