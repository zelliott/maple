D-Amino acid replacements and the determination of resulting structural changes are a useful tool to recognize amphipathic helices in biologically active peptides such as neuropeptide Y and corticotropin-releasing factor. In this paper the secondary structures of one amphipathic alpha-helical peptide and its double D-amino acid analog have been determined by means of 1H NMR and CD spectroscopies under equivalent conditions. The chemical shifts (NH and C alpha H) and the analysis of nuclear Overhauser effects show a split of the continuous helix for the all-L peptide into two helices at the position of double D-amino acid replacement. Hydrogen exchange rates correlate with water accessibilities in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic face and confirm the amphipathic helical structure in the all-L peptide as well as in its double D-amino acid analog. A significantly accelerated hydrogen isotope exchange rate is observed for the D-Ala9 backbone proton, implying an increased flexibility at that position. These results show that the incorporation of an adjacent pair of D-amino acids only causes a local change in structure and flexibility, which makes the double D replacement interesting as a tool for specific helix-disturbing modifications to search for helical conformations in biologically active peptides.
