A full-length metallothionein (MT) gene (GintMT1) was isolated from Glomus intraradices extraradical mycelium. This is the first MT gene reported in the genus Glomus, third in the Glomeromycota. Functional analysis of GintMT1 in a MT-defective Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain indicates that it encodes a functional MT. Gene expression analyses revealed that the transcript levels of GintMT1 were elevated in mycelia treated with 5 mM Cu or paraquat but inhibited in mycelia treated with 50 microM Cu or 450 microM Cd. The elevated expression of GintMT1 in the 5 mM Cu-treated mycelia together with the ability of GintMT1 to provide tolerance to a Cu-sensitive yeast suggests that GintMT1 might afford protection against Cu. Induction of GintMT1 expression by paraquat and 5 mM Cu, treatments that also produced an oxidative damage to the fungal membranes, suggests that GintMT1 may play a role in the regulation of the redox status of the extraradical mycelium of G. intraradices.
