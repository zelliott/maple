We used riboprobes and monoclonal antibodies to characterize tissue distribution of the human 550-kD homologue to gp330/megalin, primarily identified in the rat kidney. Human gp330/megalin mRNA and protein are readily identified in human parathyroid cells, placental cytotrophoblasts, kidney proximal tubule cells, and epididymal epithelial cells. The immunoreactivity is found on the surface of the cells and is heterogeneously downregulated in parathyroid hyperplasia and adenomas. Cells of the proximal kidney tubule and epididymis express the protein on their luminal aspect. Moreover, the protein is expressed in Type II pneumocytes, mammary epithelial and thyroid follicular cells, and the ciliary body of the eye. Sequence analysis of cDNA fragments, obtained by RT-PCR, revealed identical nucleotide sequences in parathyroid, kidney, placenta, epididymis, and lung. Immunohistochemistry for parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) revealed partial co-expression with human gp330/megalin in parathyroid, placenta, and mammary gland. The findings substantiate human gp330/megalin expression in a variety of human tissues expected to possess calcium-sensing functions. It may constitute a protein of utmost importance to adult and fetal calcium homeostasis, although other important functions may also be coupled to this exceptionally large protein with highly restricted tissue distribution.
