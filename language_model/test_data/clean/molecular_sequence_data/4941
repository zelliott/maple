The Pax-3 protein contains two DNA-binding domains, a paired domain and a homeodomain. Mutations in Pax-3 cause Waardenburg syndrome (WS) in humans and the mouse Splotch (Sp) phenotype. In the Sp-delayed mouse, a mutation in the Pax-3 paired domain (G9R) abrogates the DNA-binding activity of both the paired domain and the homeodomain, suggesting that they may functionally interact. To investigate this possibility further, we have analyzed the DNA-binding properties of additional point mutants in the Pax-3 paired domain and homeodomain that occur in WS patients (F12L, N14H, G15S, P17L, R23L, G48A, S51F and G66D in the paired domain, V47F and R53G in the homeodomain), the Pax-1 un mutation (G15A) and a substitution associated with Peters' anomaly in the PAX-6 gene (R23G). Within the paired domain, seven of 10 mutations were found to abrogate DNA-binding by the paired domain. Remarkably, these seven mutations also affected DNA binding by the homeodomain, causing either a complete loss (P17L and G66D), a reduction (R23G, R23L, G15S and G15A) or an increase in DNA-binding activity (N14H). In addition, the effect of paired domain mutations occurred at the level of monomer formation by the homeodomain, while the dimerization potential of this domain seemed unaffected in mutants where it could be analyzed. Furthermore, while both homeodomain mutations were found to abolish DNA binding by this domain, the R53G mutation also abrogated DNA binding by the paired domain. The important observation that independent mutations in either domain can affect DNA binding by the other in the intact Pax-3 protein strongly suggests that the two domains are not functionally independent but bind DNA through cooperative interactions. Modeling the deleterlous mutations on the three-dimensional structure of the paired domain of Drosophila Prd shows that these mutations cluster at the DNA interface, thus suggesting that a series of DNA contacts are essential for DNA binding by both the paired domain and the homeodomain of Pax-3.
