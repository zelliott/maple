To isolate microbial proteins capable of binding the third component of complement (C3), we coupled the free sulfhydryl group of methylamine-inactivated C3 to a thiolSepharose matrix. This simple technique facilitated the purification of the first C3-binding protein isolated from a bacterium (Streptococcus pneumoniae). Both metastable (native) and thioester-disrupted C3 were recognized by this protein; binding of C3 was noncovalent, independent of thioester conformation, and preferential for the C3 alpha-chain. Sequencing of amino-terminal and internal peptides from the C3-binding protein disclosed a proline-rich region spanning approximately 20 amino acids and a signal peptide that had not been previously reported. The gene was isolated from a library of genomic DNA from laboratory strain CP1200 by screening with a 1200 bp PCR product amplified from degenerate oligonucleotides encoding the amino terminal sequence and the internal proline-rich sequence. The open reading frame spanned 1692 bp; all peptide sequences were identified in the translated gene product, which also contained at least three choline-binding repeats at the carboxy-terminus. The gene was conserved, and the translated protein was functionally active in pneumococcal clinical isolates of serotypes 1, 3, 4, 14, and 19F. Serum from a patient recovering from acute pneumococcal infection contained IgG antibodies specific for this protein by immunoblot. Wide conservation among clinical isolates, saturable binding of C3, and the ability to stimulate the human immune response have not previously been reported for this choline-binding protein. A similar biochemical approach should enable the identification of other C3-binding proteins in microorganisms able to elude complement-mediated host defense.
