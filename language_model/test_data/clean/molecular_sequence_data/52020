Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) is a potentially lethal, hereditary disorder of skeletal muscle that may be triggered by inhalation anesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants. Defects in the gene encoding the ryanodine receptor (RYR1) localized on human chromosome 19q13.1 have been proposed to be responsible for MHS. Using a chromosome 19-specific human/hamster somatic cell hybrid mapping panel, we were able to determine that four closely linked microsatellite repeat markers bracket RYR1 with the order 19cen-D19S75-D19S191-RYR1-(D19S47, D19S190)-19ter. Application of the four markers to genetic studies of MHS showed recombination between the markers and MHS in two families, with linkage analysis apparently excluding the MHS locus from the RYR1 region of 19q13.1. These results therefore support the recent observations of genetic heterogeneity in MHS.
