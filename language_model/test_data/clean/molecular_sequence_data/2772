To define the V gene family repertoire of human IgG anti-Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide antibodies, we purified six IgG1 and nine IgG2 anti-Hib-PS antibodies to monoclonality from immune serum of six individuals and performed N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. Of the 15 clonal antibodies we examined, all H chain V regions were of the VHIII family. In contrast, the L chains of these antibodies were clearly from at least four different VL families; VKI, VKII, VKIII, and V lambda. Interestingly. VL family expression correlated with the cross-reactivity of these antibodies to the capsular carbohydrate of Escherichia coli K100. VKII antibodies did not cross-react, whereas antibodies expressing V lambda, VKI, or VKIII generally cross-reacted. We conclude that L chain V regions are very important contributors to the limited heterogeneity in this antibody repertoire.
