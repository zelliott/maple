Alteromonas sp. strain SN2, able to metabolize polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, was isolated from a crude oil-contaminated sea-tidal flat. Here we report the complete 4.97-Mb genome sequence and annotation of strain SN2. These will advance the understanding of strain SN2's adaptation to the sea-tidal flat ecosystem and its pollutant metabolic versatility.
