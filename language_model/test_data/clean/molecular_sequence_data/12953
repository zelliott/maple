We have amplified, cloned, and sequenced 583 bp GCAP-II/uroguanylin-specific cDNA from human colon cDNA first strand. The cDNA codes for a putative 112 amino-acid precursor protein including the sequence of uroguanylin and GCAP-II. Northern blot hybridization revealed a high level expression of the GCAP-II gene in human colon, but not in the kidney. This expression of GCAP-II indicates a pivotal role in cGMP-mediated functions of the colon.
