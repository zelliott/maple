High molecular weight hepatoma-associated nonhistone chromosomal proteins (NHPs) in transplantable rat hepatoma cells were reported previously from this laboratory. A cDNA library prepared from Morris hepatoma 7777 cells was screened with the polyclonal antibodies against hepatoma NHPs and a positive cDNA clone (lambda P2A1) was isolated. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the cDNA clone was identical to that of rat fibronectin (FN). The polyclonal antibodies against hepatoma NHPs were shown to bind specifically to both rat plasma FN and the fusion proteins encoded by lambda P2A1. A monoclonal antibody specific to rat plasma FN also recognized high molecular weight antigens of hepatoma NHPs in a pattern similar to that demonstrated with the polyclonal antibodies. These results suggest the existence of FN or FN-like antigens in the chromatin preparations from rat hepatoma cells. The antigenic proteins are localized in the nuclei of neoplastic foci of liver undergoing hepatocarcinogenesis.
