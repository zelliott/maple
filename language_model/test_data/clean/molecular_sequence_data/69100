A coordinated and efficient development of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses is believed to be required for complete eradication of viral infections. During the course of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HLA class II and class I-restricted T cell responses to HBV nucleocapsid antigens are vigorous in patients with acute infection who succeed in clearing the virus but weak or totally absent in patients with chronic persistence of the virus. These findings suggest a role for these responses in the pathogenesis of hepatitis B and in HBV clearance. Molecular analysis of T cell recognition of the HBV nucleoprotein defines the presence of immunodominant core epitopes recognized by helper and cytotoxic T cells that may represent the starting point for the design of alternative strategies for prevention and treatment of HBV infection.
