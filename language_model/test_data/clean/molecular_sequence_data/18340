We report the sequence of 4264 nucleotides of 5' flanking sequence of the human thymidine kinase gene, a gene that is maximally expressed at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle. The position of nucleotide sequences which can act as binding sites for trans-acting factors, Sp-1, AP-1/jun, AP-2, OTF-1 and CAAT box factors as well as other potential cis-acting sequences have been mapped. The organization of these cis-acting sequences in the promoter of the human PCNA gene (another gene that is maximally expressed at the G1/S boundary) are shown for comparison. The potential role that these sequences may play in the transcriptional regulation of these genes is discussed.
