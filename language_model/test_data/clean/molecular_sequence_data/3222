The invasive green alga Caulerpa taxifolia has gained a high profile due to 'outbreaks' in the Mediterranean and California. During the year 2000 three new discrete locations colonised by abundant C. taxifolia were discovered in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal DNA was used to explore the source(s) of these new records, which is an important prerequisite for subsequent environmental management responses. Our results indicate that the NSW C. taxifolia originated from several sources and, hence, through different invasion events. For two of the new records (Port Hacking, Careel Bay) it can be excluded that they are derived from the so-called "aquarium strain" of C. taxifolia, closely related to the invasive Mediterranean populations. Port Hacking is likely to have originated from tropical native populations. However, samples from Lake Conjola cannot be sufficiently distinguished with the applied technique from native C. taxifolia in Moreton Bay and the Mediterranean/"aquarium strain".
