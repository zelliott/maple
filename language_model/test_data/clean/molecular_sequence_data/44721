A scotochromogenic acid-fast bacillus was isolated from a lymph node of a 2-year-old female. On the basis of conventional testing, the mycobacterium appeared to be Mycobacterium scrofulaceum. Its mycolic acid profile, however, was not identical to that of Mycobacterium scrofulaceum but was similar to that of Mycobacterium interjectum. Direct sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed a unique nucleic acid sequence, suggesting that the isolate represents a previously undescribed pathogenic species.
