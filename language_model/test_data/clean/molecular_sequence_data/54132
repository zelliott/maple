A xylan-degrading bacterium, strain X11-1(T), was isolated from soil collected in Nan province, Thailand. The strain was characterized based on its phenotypic and genotypic characteristics. Strain X11-1(T) was a Gram-stain-positive, facultatively anaerobic, spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium. It contained meso-diaminopimelic acid in the cell-wall peptidoglycan. The major menaquinone was MK-7, anteiso-C(15 : 0) (56.6 %) and C(16 : 0) (14.0 %) were the predominant cellular fatty acids and diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol were the major phospholipids. The DNA G+C content was 51.6 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain X11-1(T) was affiliated to the genus Paenibacillus and was closely related to Paenibacillus naphthalenovorans KACC 11505(T) and Paenibacillus validus CCM 3894(T), with 96.5 % sequence similarity. Therefore, the strain represents a novel species of the genus Paenibacillus, for which the name Paenibacillus xylanisolvens sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is X11-1(T) (=KCTC 13042(T) =PCU 311(T) =TISTR 1829(T)).
