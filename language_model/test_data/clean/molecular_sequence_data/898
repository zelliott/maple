Vinorama isolectins (VL2-VL4) were purified from seeds of Acacia constricta (vinorama) using affinity chromatography on a fetuin-fractogel column followed by cationic-exchange chromatography. Each isolectin fraction presented a characteristic isoelectric point range from 5.5 to 8.4. Under native conditions, VL containing fractions migrated as tetramers of 133 kDa, while in SDS-PAGE, in presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, a single subunit band with M(r) of 34 kDa was observed. VL was found to be a glycoprotein with a 7.5% neutral sugar content. Antibodies to Phaseolus vulgaris lectins PHA and other wild legume lectins as Olneya tesota (palo fierro) PF2 and PF3, and Parkinsonia aculeate (palo verde) PV reacted with VL, but not with anti Glycine max agglutinin SBA or anti Lotus tetragonolobus agglutinin LTA. Furthermore, direct analysis of VL peptides showed sequences homologous to those reported in different lectins of the Phaseolus genus. VL2-VL4 did not have ABO serological or simple sugar specificity, but were inhibited by complex carbohydrates from fetuin and thyroglobulin. Asialofetuin carbohydrates strongly interacted with VL4 and VL3. Vinorama isolectins could be classified as "complex lectins".
