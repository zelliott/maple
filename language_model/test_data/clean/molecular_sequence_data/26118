The nucleotide sequence of katG from Salmonella typhimurium was determined revealing an open reading frame of 2181 bp that could encode a 727 amino acid protein. The predicted sequence of the encoded hydroperoxidase I (HPI) was found to be 90% similar to HPI from Escherichia coli and was one amino acid longer. The physical and enzymatic properties of HPI from both Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli were found to be virtually identical despite the 10% divergence in sequence.
