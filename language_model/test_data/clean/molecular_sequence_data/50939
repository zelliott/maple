Previously, it has been shown by light microscopy that antiserum to the L7 protein labels cerebellar Purkinje neurons. Herein we show by light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry that all cerebellar Purkinje cells express L7 and that the gene product is distributed to all neuronal compartments, including the nucleus. Possible functional roles for L7, based on its subcellular localization, are discussed. L7 is proposed as an excellent marker molecule for future studies of normal and aberrant cerebellar development.
