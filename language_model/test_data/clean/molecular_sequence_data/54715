Genomic sequence of Scophthalmus maximus rhabdovirus (SMRV) isolated from diseased turbot has been characterized. The complete genome of SMRV comprises 11,492 nucleotides and encodes five typical rhabdovirus genes N, P, M, G and L. In addition, two open reading frames (ORF) are predicted overlapping with P gene, one upstream of P and smaller than P (temporarily called Ps), and another in P gene which may encodes a protein similar to the vesicular stomatitis virus C protein. The C ORF is contained within the P ORF. The five typical proteins share the highest sequence identities (48.9%) with the corresponding proteins of rhabdoviruses in genus Vesiculovirus. Phylogenetic analysis of partial L protein sequence indicates that SMRV is close to genus Vesiculovirus. The first 13 nucleotides at the ends of the SMRV genome are absolutely inverse complementarity. The gene junctions between the five genes show conserved polyadenylation signal (CATGA(7)) and intergenic dinucleotide (CT) followed by putative transcription initiation sequence A(A/G)(C/G)A(A/G/T), which are different from known rhabdoviruses. The entire Ps ORF was cloned and expressed, and used to generate polyclonal antibody in mice. One obvious band could be detected in SMRV-infected carp leucocyte cells (CLCs) by anti-Ps/C serum via Western blot, and the subcellular localization of Ps-GFP fusion protein exhibited cytoplasm distribution as multiple punctuate or doughnut shaped foci of uneven size.
