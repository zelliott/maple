Isocitrate lyase is the first enzyme of the glyoxylate shunt which is required for the assimilation of fatty acids and acetate. The intracellular pathogen Rhodococcus equi contains high activities of this enzyme following growth on acetate and lactate, indicating that it plays an important role in the metabolism of these substrates. The gene encoding isocitrate lyase (aceA) was cloned and sequenced. It specifies a 46846 Da protein, which was shown to be functional by expressing it in Escherichia coli. A gene similar to fadB, encoding 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, was located 90 bp downstream from aceA. Northern hybridization and RT-PCR experiments showed that aceA and fadB are cotranscribed into a 2.8 kb transcript. A smaller 1.6 kb aceA transcript was also observed which was 2.5-fold more abundant than the aceA-fadB transcript. It is proposed that a stable hairpin structure with a free energy (DeltaG) of -28.5 kcal x mol(-1) and located in the 90 bp aceA-fadB intergenic region is involved in stabilizing the aceA transcript.
