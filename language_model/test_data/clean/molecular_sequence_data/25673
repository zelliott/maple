A molecular mechanical force field is described for the conformational analysis of oligosaccharides. This force field has been derived by the addition of new parameters to the AMBER force field and is compatible with simulations of proteins. This new parametrization is assessed by comparison of the theoretically predicted conformations of Man alpha 1-3Man beta 1-4GlcNAc with the corresponding crystal structure. Molecular dynamics simulation data are presented for this structure both in vacuo and with the explicit inclusion of water molecules. While the former demonstrate significant torsional oscillations about glycosidic linkages at physiological temperature, in the latter these oscillations are highly damped due to the stabilizing influence of a "cage" of solvent-solvent and solvent-solute hydrogen bonds.
