The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is an extremely dynamic region of the genome, characterized by high polymorphism and frequent gene duplications and rearrangements. This has resulted in considerable differences in MHC organization and evolution among vertebrate lineages, particularly between birds and mammals. As nonavian reptiles are ancestral to both mammals and birds, they occupy an important phylogenetic position for understanding these differences. However, little is known about reptile MHC genes. To address this, we have characterized MHC class I sequences from the tuatara (Sphenodon spp.), the last survivor of an ancient order of reptiles, Sphenodontia. We isolated two different class I cDNA sequences, which share 93% sequence similarity with each other but are highly divergent from other vertebrate MHC genes. Southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction amplification of class I sequences from seven adult tuatara plus a family group indicate that these sequences represent at least two to three loci. Preliminary analysis of variation among individuals from an island population of tuatara indicates that these loci are highly polymorphic. Maximum likelihood analysis of reptile MHC class I sequences indicates that gene duplication has occurred within reptilian orders. However, the evolutionary relationships among sequences from different reptilian orders cannot be resolved, reflecting the antiquity of the major reptile lineages.
