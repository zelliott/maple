Point mutations in the mitochondrial gene tRNA leucine(UUR) have been associated with maternally inherited mitochondrial myopathies including the MELAS syndrome (Mitochondrial Myopathy Encephalopathy Lactic acidosis and Stroke-like episodes). We describe a further mutation in tRNA leucine(UUR) in a patient with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, pigmentary retinopathy, dementia, hypoparathyroidism and diabetes mellitus. The mutation was heteroplasmic in the proband's blood (30%) and muscle (76%); it was present at high levels in the proband's affected mother (50% in muscle), and at low levels (< 10%) in blood, muscle and fibroblasts of an unaffected sister. The mutation was not found in 121 normal controls or 35 other patients with mitochondrial disorders. The mutation is at a highly conserved position in the tRNA molecule, close to the 3,243 mutation which is associated with more than 80% of MELAS cases. Further more, both mutations lie within a possible transcriptional control region. This finding adds further support to the evidence that mutations in this region and in other mitochondrial tRNA genes may cause disease.
