Transcription of the myelin basic protein (MBP) gene is regulated in a cell-type-specific and developmental stage-specific manner during myelin formation in the murine central nervous system. The 5'-flanking region of the MBP gene contains several regulatory elements that differentially contribute to the cell-type-specific transcription of MBP in cells derived from the central nervous system. The proximal element, termed MB1, which is located between nucleotides -14 and -50 with respect to the RNA start site, has previously been shown to have characteristics of a cell-type-specific enhancer element. In this study, we used band shift and UV cross-linking assays to identify DNA-binding proteins in mouse brain nuclear extract which interact with the MB1 element. Fractionation of these extracts has allowed the identification of a 38- to 41-kDa nuclear protein, derived from mouse brain tissue at the peak of myelination, which specifically binds the MB1 DNA sequence. Fractions enriched in the MB1-binding protein have been shown to stimulate transcription of the MBP promoter in extract derived from HeLa cells. MB1 binding protein activity is expressed in a tissue-specific and development stage-specific pattern which coincides with the pattern of MBP transcription, suggesting that this protein may be a biologically relevant transcription factor for the MBP gene in vivo.
