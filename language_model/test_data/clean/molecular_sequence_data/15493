Two bacterial strains, IPL15(T) and IPL20(T), isolated from a hexachlorocyclohexane dump site in India, were characterized by using a polyphasic approach. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, both strains belonged to the genus Devosia; highest sequence similarities of strain IPL15(T) were observed with Devosia neptuniae J1(T) and Devosia geojensis BD-c194(T) (96.2 % in each case) and the highest sequence similarity of strain IPL20(T) was observed with Devosia soli GH2-10(T) (98.6 %). Phylogenetic analysis showed the distinct lineages of strains IPL15(T) and IPL20(T) among members of the genus Devosia. The presence of C(18 : 0) 3-OH and C(10 : 0) 3-OH fatty acids supported their respective positions within the genus Devosia. On the basis of phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic analysis and DNA-DNA hybridization results, it is concluded that strains IPL15(T) and IPL20(T) represent two distinct species of the genus Devosia for which the names Devosia albogilva sp. nov. and Devosia crocina sp. nov., respectively, are proposed. The type strains are Devosia albogilva IPL15(T) (=CCM 7427(T)=MTCC 8594(T)) and Devosia crocina IPL20(T) (=CCM 7425(T)=MTCC 8590(T)).
