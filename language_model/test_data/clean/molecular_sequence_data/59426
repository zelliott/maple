Two new alcoholic aroma precursors, cis- and trans-linalool, 3,7-oxides 6-O-beta-D-apiofuranosyl-beta-D-glucopyranosides (1 and 2), as well as two already known compounds, (Z)-3-hexenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside (3) and methyl salicylate 6-O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (beta-primeveroside: 4), and another new monoterpendiol glycoside, 8-hydroxygeranyl beta-primeveroside (5) have recently been isolated as aroma precursors in tea leaves (Camellia sinensis var. sinensis cv. Maoxie) ready for oolong tea processing.
