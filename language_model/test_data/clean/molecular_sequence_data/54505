Six Escherichia coli O25b ST131 isolates, which were mostly hospital-acquired but from various types of samples, were found to carry bla(CTX-M-3a,)bla(CTX-M-14), or bla(CTX-M-65) genes, demonstrating that such isolates have emerged in China. The bla(CTX-M) genes were mostly carried by IncFII-related conjugative plasmids. All isolates were also resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin and had substitutions in GyrA and carried an aac(3)-II gene.
