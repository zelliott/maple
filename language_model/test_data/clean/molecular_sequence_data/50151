Glycoprotein E of West Nile, dengue and other flaviviruses is the principal stimulus for the development of neutralizing antibodies and contains a fusion peptide responsible for inserting the virus into the host cell membrane. This glycoprotein lies flat on the surface of the virion and therefore only epitopes on the outer or lateral surface are important immunogens. Changes in antigen recognition after exposure of the virus to low pH have yielded clues to the fusion process.
