The primary structure of mouse preproacrosin was deduced by nucleotide sequencing of cDNA clones isolated from a mouse testis cDNA library. The largest cDNA, with 1373 bp, consists of a 11-bp 5'untranslated sequence, a 1254-bp open reading frame terminated by a TGA triplet and a 105-bp 3' untranslated end, including one potential polyadenylation signal. The NH2-terminus of the polypeptide contains a hydrophobic 15-amino acid signal peptide. This cleavable signal sequence is followed by 403 amino acids, representing the acrosin light and the heavy chain of 23 and 380 amino acid residues, respectively. The proteolytic active site segments His, Asp and Ser are part of the heavy chain, as well as a proline-rich COOH-terminus, which is not present in any other serine proteinase studied so far. Furthermore the postmeiotic expression of the preproacrosin gene during mouse spermatogenesis was studied.
