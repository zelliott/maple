We report the first heterozygous case of Hb A(2)-NYU (HBD:c.39T>A) in the Hellenic population. The proband, an adult female from the island of Crete, Greece, was identified during routine family screening. DEAE chromatography of the index case revealed a minor hemoglobin (Hb) fraction preceding the elution of the wild-type Hb A(2). DNA sequencing of the entire HBD gene coding regions indicated that the index case was heterozygous for the rare variant Hb A(2)-NYU. Family studies indicated that this Hb variant was inherited from the mother. This finding underlines the vast genetic heterogeneity of the HBD gene in the Hellenic population.
