Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) gene expression is liver specific and inducible by glucocorticoids and via the cAMP signaling pathway. In fibroblasts and other nonliver cells the gene is subject to negative control by the trans-dominant tissue-specific extinguisher locus Tse-1. We identified a hepatocyte-specific enhancer that is repressed by Tse-1. Two distinct sequence motifs are absolutely essential for function of this enhancer: a cAMP response element (CRE), which is the target for repression by Tse-1, and a hepatocyte-specific element. The specificity of the enhancer is generated by the combination of these two essential elements, which are fully interdependent. In vivo footprinting indicates that Tse-1 acts by affecting protein binding at the CRE. A direct antagonism between Tse-1 and the cAMP signaling pathway suggests that Tse-1 plays a role in control of developmental activation of the TAT gene.
