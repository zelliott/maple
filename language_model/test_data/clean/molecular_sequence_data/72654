The polyadenylation of replication-dependent histone H2B, H3 and H4 mRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster was analysed. Two types of mRNAs, containing a poly(A) tail, can be detected in addition to non-polyadenylated messengers, which represent the majority of replication-dependent histone mRNAs. Firstly, conventional polyadenylation signals, localized downstream from the stem-loop region, are used to produce polyadenylated mRNAs. The messengers of this type, generated from the D. melanogaster H2B gene, are preferentially synthesized in the testis of the fly. Secondly, a distinct type of polyadenylated histone mRNA has been identified. This mRNA, which is present in many different tissues and constitutes a minor part of the total histone mRNA pool, contains a short poly(A) tail, added to the end of the 3' terminal stem-loop structure, which is in most cases lacking several nucleotides from its 3' end. The sites of polyadenylation within the stem-loop are not preceded by a normal polyadenylation signal. The possible functions of the polyadenylated histone transcripts are discussed.
