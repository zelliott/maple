Fibronectin alternative exon EIIIA is largely included in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells of the developing limb bud, whereas the exon is excluded in differentiated chondrocytes. Inclusion of exon EIIIA in chondrocytic cells is increased by overexpression of SRp40, and, to a lesser extent, SRp75, but not SRp55. RT-PCR analysis using real-time PCR revealed that the levels of the mRNAs for these three proteins did not vary significantly in chick chondrocytes versus mesenchymal cells of the developing limb bud. However, a variant spliced form of SRp40, termed, SRp40LF, is detected preferentially in chondrocytes and in chondrifying mesenchymal cells. Forced overexpression of SRp40 or SRp75, but not SRp55, enhanced chondrogenic differentiation of chick limb mesenchymal cells in a high-density micromass assay. Overexpression of SRp40LF, which produces a truncated form of SRp40, also was strongly pro-chondrogenic. In a HeLa cell-based assay, SRp40LF fails to substitute for SRp40 in mediating an increase in exon EIIIA inclusion, suggesting that the latter event is not essential for the pro-chondrogenic effect. These results demonstrate the ability of these highly conserved splicing factors to modulate chondrogenesis and are consistent with earlier results that implicated exon EIIIA-containing isoforms of fibronectin in formation of chondrogenic condensations.
