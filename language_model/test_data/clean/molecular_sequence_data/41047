The chloroplast genome of Eutreptia viridis Perty, a basal taxon in the photosynthetic euglenoid lineage, was sequenced and compared with that of Euglena gracilis Ehrenberg, a crown species. Several common gene clusters were identified and gene order, conservation, and sequence similarity was assessed through comparisons with Euglena gracilis. Significant gene rearrangements were present between Eutreptia viridis and Euglena gracilis chloroplast genomes. In addition, major expansion has occurred in the Euglena gracilis chloroplast accounting for its larger size. However, the key chloroplast genes are present and differ only in the absence of psaM and roaA in Eutreptia viridis, and psaI in Euglena gracilis, suggesting a high level of gene conservation within the euglenoid lineage. Further comparisons with the plastid genomes of closely related green algal taxa have provided additional support for the hypothesis that a Pyramimonas-like alga was the euglenoid chloroplast donor via secondary endosymbiosis.
