The structure of the main saccharide chain of the acrosome reaction-inducing substance in the egg jelly coat of the starfish, Asterias amurensis, is composed of the following pentasaccharide repeating units (Structure I). A polymer consisting of 10-11 repeating units has been observed to induce the acrosome reaction in starfish sperm at high calcium concentrations. [STRUCTURE I:see text] The identities and linkage positions of constituent sugars were established using sugar, methylation, and sulfate analyses together with one- and two-dimensional nmr spectroscopy. The structure was supported by the data obtained for desulfation products and the Smith degradation of the polysaccharide.
