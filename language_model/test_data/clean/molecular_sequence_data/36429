Molecular clones of Borrelia burgdorferi, aetiologic agent of Lyme borreliosis, were isolated and analysed by DNA sequence determination. This procedure yielded B. burgdorferi homologues of gidA, gyrB, gyrA, ftsA and ftsZ. The genes were located on the physical map of the B. burgdorferi linear chromosome. Also mapped were the genes fla and p60 while dnaA was mapped using a heterologous probe. gyrA and gyrB were found to be in tandem and were mapped, along with dnaA at the centre of the chromosome. gidA was located close to the left hand extremity of the chromosome. Because gyrB, dnaA and gidA are normally located within 50 kb of the origin of replication (oriC), we propose two possible sites for oriC in the B. burgdorferi linear chromosome.
