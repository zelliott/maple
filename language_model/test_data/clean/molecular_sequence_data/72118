We cloned and sequenced a mouse gene encoding a new type of membrane bound serine protease (epithin) containing a multidomain structure. The initial cDNA clone was found previously in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based subtractive library generated from fetal thymic stromal cells, and the message was shown to be highly expressed in a thymic epithelial nurse cell line. A clone isolated from a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) thymus library and extended to its full length at the 5' end with the RACE technique contains an open reading frame of 902 amino acids. Based on the sequence of this clone, the predicted protein structure is a type II membrane protein with a C-terminal serine protease domain linked to the membrane by four low density lipoprotein receptor modules and two CUB domains. High message expression by northern blotting was detected in intestine, kidney, lung, SCID, and Rag-2(-/-) thymus, and 2-deoxyguanosine-treated fetal thymic rudiment, but not in skeletal muscle, liver, heart, testis, and brain. Sorted MHC class II+ and II- fetal thymic stromal cells were positive for expression by reverse transcriptase-PCR, whereas CD45(+) thymocytes were not. The gene was found in chicken and multiple mammalian species under low stringency Southern hybridization conditions. Under high stringency conditions, only a single gene per haploid genome was identified in the mouse. This gene, Prss14 (protease, serine, 14), was mapped to mouse chromosome 9 and is closely linked to the Fli1 (Friend leukemia integration 1) gene.
