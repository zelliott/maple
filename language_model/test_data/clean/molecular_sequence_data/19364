Mycolic acids are a key component of the mycobacterial cell wall, providing structure and forming a major permeability barrier. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis mycolic acids are synthesized by type I and type II fatty acid synthases. One of the enzymes of the type II system is encoded by fabG1. We demonstrate here that this gene can be deleted from the M. tuberculosis chromosome only when another functional copy is provided elsewhere, showing that under normal culture conditions fabG1 is essential. FabG1 activity can be replaced by the corresponding enzyme from the closely related species Mycobacterium smegmatis but not by the enzyme from Escherichia coli. M. tuberculosis carrying FabG from M. smegmatis showed no phenotypic changes, and both the mycolic acids and cell wall permeability were unchanged. Thus, M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis enzymes are interchangeable and do not control the lengths and types of mycolic acids synthesized.
