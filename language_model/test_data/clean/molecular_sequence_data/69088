Myelin formation and maintenance requires complex interactions between neurons and glia, and between the integral protein and lipid components of the myelin sheath. Many of the underlying mechanisms may be examined by studying the perturbations caused by spontaneous and targeted mutations in myelin protein genes. This review summarizes the progress in our understanding of these mutations with an emphasis on integrating the recent advances in the genetics of myelin into a more generalized view of myelin organization and function.
