The p21 GTPases, Rho and Cdc42, regulate numerous cellular functions by binding to members of a serine/threonine protein kinase subfamily. These functions include the remodeling of the cell cytoskeleton that is a feature of cell growth and differentiation. Two of these p21 GTPase-regulated kinases, the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinases (MRCKalpha and beta), have been recently characterized in rat. Both of these proteins phosphorylate nonmuscle myosin light chain, a prerequisite for the activation of actin-myosin contractility. Here we report the cDNA cloning of the human homologue of MRCKbeta, CDC42BPB, which was found by Northern blot analysis to be expressed in a wide range of tissues. The human CDC42BPB gene maps to cytogenetic band 14q32.3 by FISH analysis.
