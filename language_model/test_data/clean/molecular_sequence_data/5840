ORF95 in the filamentous phage phi Lf genome, locating behind gIII, was identified to be the gene (gVI) coding for minor coat protein pVI (95 amino acids, 10,245 dal). It was shown to be virion associated by Western blot analysis of chloroform-treated phage particles. Computer analysis predicted two transmembrane regions for this protein. Since no signal peptide was suggested and the size estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis matches that deduced from nucleotide sequence, it appears to be incorporated into the phage particle as its primary translational product. After completion of this study, eight genes organizing into an order of gVII-gX-gV-gVII-gIX-gIII-gIII-gVI have been identified for phi Lf.
