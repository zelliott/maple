Genetic and phylogenetic characterization of Cryptosporidium isolates at two loci (18S rRNA gene and heat shock gene) from both Australian and United States dogs demonstrated that dog-derived Cryptosporidium isolates had a distinct genotype which is conserved across geographic areas. Phylogenetic analysis provided support for the idea that the "dog" genotype is, in fact, a valid species.
