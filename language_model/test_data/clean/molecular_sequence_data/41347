The zona pellucida (ZP) participates in sperm-egg interactions during the first steps of fertilization. Recent studies have shown that the ZP matrix of oocytes in several species is composed of four glycoproteins, designated as ZP1, ZP2, ZP3 and ZP4, rather than the three described in mouse, pig and cow. In this study, investigations were carried out to unveil a fourth glycoprotein in the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) ZP. Using total RNA isolated from rabbit ovaries, the complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) encoding rabbit ZP1 was amplified by reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The ZP1 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1825 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 608 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of rabbit ZP1 showed high identity with other species: 70% identity with human and horse ZP1, and 67% identity with mouse and rat ZP1. At the proteomic level, peptides corresponding to the four proteins were detected by mass spectrometry. In addition, a molecular phylogenetic analysis of ZP1 showed that pseudogenization of this gene has occurred at least four times during the evolution of mammals. The data presented in this manuscript provide evidence, for the first time, that the rabbit ZP is composed of four glycoproteins.
