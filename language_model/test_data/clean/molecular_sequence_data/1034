To better understand the phylogenetic divergence and the species-specific characteristics of the Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP), we cloned the cDNA encoding the neotomodon CCSP (nCCSP) and analyzed its tissue-specific expression. The full-length cDNA is 451bp long and predicts an amino acid sequence of 93 residues. Northern blot analysis from different neotomodon tissues demonstrated that the mRNA of CCSP appears to be solely expressed in the lung. To study the transcriptional regulation of the CCSP gene, we cloned the 5'-flanking region of the nCCSP gene and compared its features with those previously reported for the hamster gene. The neotomodon and hamster genes share 89% sequence homology in their promoter region as well as a number of conserved cis-acting elements. However, in H441 cells the expression of a reporter gene driven by the nCCSP promoter was about 4-fold greater than its hamster counterpart. Functional analysis of progressive 5'-deletion mutants identified a region involved in the higher transcriptional activity of the neotomodon promoter.
