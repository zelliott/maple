Initiation factor 1 (IF1) is an essential protein in Escherichia coli involved in the initiation step of protein synthesis. The protein level of IF1 increases when E. coli cells are subjected to cold shock, however, it remains unclear as to how this increase occurs. The infA gene encoding IF1 contains two promoters, the distal P1 and the proximal P2 promoter. In this study, we found that infA mRNA was greatly increased, and that this increase resulted from transcriptional activation of P1, not P2, during cold shock although stability of transcripts from both promoters concomitantly increased.
