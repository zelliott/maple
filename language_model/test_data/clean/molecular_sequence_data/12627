The present study concerns the identification of four alpha-globin gene deficiencies, one alpha 1-globin gene mutation, and one beta-globin gene mutation in a Laotian couple and their newborn baby. The parents were Hb E heterozygotes and the baby was an Hb E homozygote. The father carried the 4.2-kb deletion on one chromosome and a TAA-->CAA mutation at the terminating codon of the alpha 2-gene (Hb Constant Spring or CS) on the other chromosome. Moreover, the remaining alpha 1-globin gene on the chromosome with the 4.2-kb deletion was mutated at codon 74 (GAC-->CAC; Asp-->His; Hb Q-Thailand). The mother had the 3.7-kb deletion on one chromosome and a TAA-->TAT mutation at the terminating codon of the alpha 2-globin gene (Hb Paks√©) of the second chromosome. The baby was a compound heterozygote for the two termination codon mutations and, at birth, had a high level of Hb Bart's (16.6%) reflecting a mild form of Hb H disease.
