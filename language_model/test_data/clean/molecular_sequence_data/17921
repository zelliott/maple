Leaves of Hosta ventricosa yielded eight kaempferol glycosides, of which six: the 3-(2G-glucosylrutinoside)-7-glucoside, 3-sophoroside-7-glucoside, 3-rutinoside-7-glucoside, 3-(2G-glucosylrutinoside), 3-sophoroside, 3-rutinoside were fully characterized and two: the 3-xylosylrutinoside-7-glucoside and 3-xylosylrutinoside were tentatively identified. Investigations included 1H-1H COSY and 1H-1H 2D J NMR analysis.
