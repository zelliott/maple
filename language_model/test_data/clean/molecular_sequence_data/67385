Densoviruses (DNVs) infecting arthropods are members of the family Parvoviridae. Here we report the complete genome sequence of a novel DNV with a monosense genome that infects cotton bollworms (Helicoverpa armigera), named HaDNV-1. Alignment and phylogenetic analysis revealed that HaDNV-1 showed high identity with the genus Iteravirus.
