This paper concerns the behavior in dilute and demidilute solutions of deacetylated gellan. The conformational transition, controlled by temperature and ionic strength, is investigated. It corresponds to a double-helix single-chain transition. Large ionic selectivity is observed in the helical conformation th at controls the degree of aggregation upon gelation. Potentiometry and conductivity measurements are interpreted in terms of the Manning polyelectrolyte theory in the sol state.
