Recombination activating gene 1 (RAG1) and RAG2 are the essential and tissue-specific components of V(D)J recombination. We have characterized the genomic organization of the human RAG locus, mapped the transcriptional initiation sites, and partially sequenced and performed functional reporter assays on the 5' flanking regions of human RAG1 and RAG2. Transcription initiation sites were mapped by rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends, primer extension, and/or RNase protection in normal thymocytes, three pre-B cell lines, and a mature B cell line. A single promoter region was used for RAG1 transcription. In contrast, transcription of RAG2 initiates at two distinct regions of the genome. The 5'-flanking region of the human RAG2 gene is TATA-less; however, there is a GATAA consensus at position -34 with respect to the major transcriptional initiation site of RAG1. Promoter regions of human RAG1 and RAG2 are active in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid cell lines, suggesting that an outside regulatory element is probably involved in the tissue-specific transcriptional regulation of the RAG genes.
