Crystallographic structures of HIV protease with three different peptide-mimetic inhibitors were subjected to energy minimization using molecular mechanics, the minimized structures analyzed and the inhibitor binding energies calculated. Partial charge assignment for the hydrogen bonded catalytic aspartic acids, Asp25 and -25', was in good agreement with charge calculations using semi-empirical molecular orbital methods. Root mean square deviations on minimization were small and similar for both subunits in the protease dimer. The surface loops, which had the largest B factors, changed most on minimization; the hydrophobic core and the inhibitor binding site showed little change. The distance-dependent dielectric of D(r) = 4r was found to be preferable to D(r) = r. Distance restraints were applied for the intermolecular hydrogen bonds to maintain the conformation of the inhibitor binding site. Using the dielectric of D(r) = 4r, the calculated interaction energy of the three inhibitors with the protease ranged from -53 to -56 kcal/mol. The psi groups of the inhibitors were changed to add or remove a 'transition state analogue' hydroxyl group, and the loss in energy on the removal of this group was calculated to be 0.9-1.7 kcal/mol. This would represent 19-36% of the total measured difference in binding energy between the inhibitors JG365 and MVT-101.
