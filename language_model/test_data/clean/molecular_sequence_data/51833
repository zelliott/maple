Thrombospondin (TSP) is a large, trimeric, modular glycoprotein that is a major constituent of platelet alpha granules. TSP is also secreted by a wide variety of epithelial and mesenchymal cells in patterns that reflect developmental changes in the embryo and response to injury in the adult. In addition to its role in blood coagulation, TSP has been reported to serve both adhesive and anti-adhesive functions, to foster neurite outgrowth, stimulate and inhibit cell growth and migration, and inhibit angiogenesis. Although this diversity in apparent function can be attributed, in part, to the ability of a single TSP to interact with several different cell-surface receptors, it is now known that the TSPs are encoded by at least three homologous genes in both human and mouse. TSP1, the commonly recognized protein isolated from platelets, is similar to TSP2 in structure. Both proteins contain NH2-terminal, COOH-terminal, and procollagen homology domains, and type I (TSP or properdin), type II (EGF-like), and type III (Ca(2+)-binding) repeats. However, the two TSPs differ in amino acid sequence and in the regulation of their expression. TSP1 is rapidly induced by serum and growth factors. An SRE and a binding site for NF-Y have been shown to mediate the serum response of the human TSP1 gene. On the other hand, TSP2 is far less responsive to serum than TSP1 and lacks the promoter elements that mediate the serum responsiveness of TSP1. TSP3 resembles TSP1 and TSP2 in its COOH-terminal domain and type III repeats, but contains four rather than three type II repeats and lacks type I repeats and a procollagen homology. The NH2-terminal domain of TSP3 also differs from that of either TSP1 or TSP2. All three TSPs demonstrate characteristic patterns of expression in the developing and adult mouse. It is therefore likely that each protein subserves a discrete function. In the future it will be necessary to distinguish among the three TSPs in addressing the function of these proteins.
