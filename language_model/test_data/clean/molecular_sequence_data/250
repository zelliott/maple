Two ustilaginomycetous anamorphic strains were isolated from flowers in Taiwan. Phylogenetic analysis based on the combined rRNA gene sequence of internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1)-5.8S-ITS2 and large-subunit D1/D2 domains indicated that the closest recognized species was Pseudozyma fusiformata. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization and physiological characteristics showed that the two strains represent a novel species within the genus Pseudozyma. The name Pseudozyma pruni sp. nov. is proposed, with FIRDI 005(T) (=BCRC 34227(T) =CBS 10937(T)) as the type strain.
