To define DNA regions involved in the neuron-specific expression of the neurofilament light (NF-L) gene, we generated transgenic mice bearing different NF-L constructs. A 4.9-kilobase human NF-L fragment including -292 base pairs of 5'-flanking sequences contained sufficient elements for nervous system expression in transgenic mice. Deletion of introns 1 and 2 from this 4.9-kilobase DNA fragment resulted in reduced levels of transgene expression in the cortex, while deletion of intron 3 had little effect. Both introns 1 and 2 could act independently as enhancers to confer neuronal expression of the basal heat shock promoter (hsp68) fused to lacZ in transgenic mice. The hNF-L basal promoter (-292 base pairs) was found to contain elements for directing neuronal expression of either the lacZ reporter gene or an intronless hNF-L construct. Sequence comparison revealed that intron 1, intron 2, and the basal human NF-L promoter all contain an ETS-like motif, CAGGA, present in a variety of genes expressed in the nervous system.
