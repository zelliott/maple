Using a method of expression profiling called differential analysis of cDNA library expression (DAzLE), we report the expression profile of late response genes in a model of activity-dependent neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth. Using DAzLE, we isolated differentially expressed genes from cultured rat embryonic cortical neurons after KCl (50 mM)-mediated membrane depolarization. We identified 469 activity-dependent regulated genes, of which 174 are genes of unknown function. The regulation of 63 genes was found to be nitric oxide (NO)-dependent. Identifiable genes fell into several major categories, including signal transduction pathways, neuronal development, DNA replication, gene transcription, protein metabolism, energy regulatory proteins, and antiapoptotic proteins. These genes may be important in activity-dependent neuron survival and development. Furthermore, these late response genes provide the tools to begin to investigate downstream events in activity-dependent neuronal survival and development. The major advantage of DAzLE is that it provides a nearly complete and relatively comprehensive differential screening profile that has the potential to be a powerful and useful tool in other fields of study.
