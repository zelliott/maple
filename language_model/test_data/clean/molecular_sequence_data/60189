Leucocyte migration into lymphatic tissues or inflammatory sites depends upon the expression of adhesion molecules. Among these molecules, the selectins expressed on endothelial cells (E- and P-selectins) and leucocytes (L-selectin) recognize carbohydrate ligands such as sialyl Lewis A or sialyl Lewis X oligosaccharides due to the same positioning of NeuAc, Gal and Fuc residues in both isomeric structures. We have shown that the sialic acid residue could be replaced by a sulfate group such as in the sulfated Lewis A pentasaccharide, one of the most potent monovalent ligand for human E-selectin, which was shown to be very active in the prevention of ischemia reperfusion lung injury. In the same way, we have prepared through chemoenzymatic syntheses, two disulfated Lewis X pentasaccharides, the sulfated analogs of carbohydrate ligands found on GLYCAM 1, the natural receptor of L-selectin. Finally, based on the double recognition of L-selectin with Lewis type and glycosaminoglycan structures, we tentatively introduced a possible link between the selectin- and the integrin-mediated lymphocyte adhesion systems.
