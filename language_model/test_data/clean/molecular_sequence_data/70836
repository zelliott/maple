In the amphidiploid genome of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) the diploid ancestral genomes of B. campestris and B. oleracea have been merged. As a result of this crossing event, all gene loci, gene families, or multigene families of the A and C genome types encoding a certain protein are now combined in one plant genome. In the case of the multigene family for glutamine synthetase, the key enzyme of nitrogen assimilation, six different cDNA sequences were isolated from leaf and root specific libraries. One sequence pair (BnGSL1/BnGSL2) was characterized by the presence of amino-terminal transit peptides, a typical feature of all nuclear encoded chloroplast proteins. Two other cDNA pairs (BnGSR1-1/BnGSR1-2 and BnGSR2-1/BnGSR2-2) with very high homology between each other were found in a root specific cDNA library and represent protein subunits for cytosolic glutamine synthetase isoforms. Comparative PCR amplifications of genomic DNA isolated from B. napus, B. campestris and B. oleracea followed by sequence-specific restriction analyses of the PCR products permitted the assignment of the cDNA sequences to either the A genome type (BnGSL1/BnGSR1-1/BnGSR2-1) or the C genome type (BnGSL2/BnGSR1-2/BnGSR2-2). Consequently, the ancestral GS genes of B. campestris and B. oleracea are expressed simultaneously in oilseed rape. This result was also confirmed by RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) analysis of RT-PCR products. In addition, the different GS genes showed tissue specific expression patterns which are correlated with the state of development of the plant material. Especially for the GS genes encoding the cytosolic GS isoform BnGSR2, a marked increase of expression could be observed after the onset of leaf senescence.
