The 2.8 A crystal structure of hydroxylamine oxidoreductase of a nitrifying chemoautotrophic bacterium, Nitrosomonas europaea, is described. Twenty-four haems lie in the centre bottom of the trimeric molecule, localized in four clusters within each monomer. The haem clusters within the trimer are aligned to form a ring that has inlet and outlet sites. The inlet is occupied by a novel haem, P460, and there are two possible outlet sites per monomer formed by paired haems lying within a cavity or cleft on the protein surface. The structure suggests pathways by which electron transfer may occur through the precisely arranged haems and provides a framework for the interpretation of previous and future biochemical and genetic observations.
