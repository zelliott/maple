A conserved neutralising epitope was confirmed as the site of specific activity for the monoclonal antibody R92F6. This monoclonal antibody was used to detect B19 viral antigen in serum samples after SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Twenty samples from the United Kingdom, Ireland, Japan, and the United States were positive with this technique. Serum samples from various control groups were negative.
