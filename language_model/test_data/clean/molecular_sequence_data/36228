A genomic fragment containing the 5' boundary of the von Willebrand factor pseudogene was cloned, partially sequenced and used for in situ hybridization experiments on metaphase spreads from a Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia patient. Data obtained indicate that the von Willebrand factor pseudogenic region is centromeric to the breakpoint cluster region on 22q11.2. This probe could be used for the study of deletions in the DiGeorge syndrome.
