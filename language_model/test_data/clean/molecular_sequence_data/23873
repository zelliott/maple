Interaction between nucleus and cytoplasm has essential roles in plant development, including that of floral organs. We isolated a wheat homolog Whlp of Arabidopsis HUELLENLOS PARALOG (HLP) gene encoding a mitochondrial (mt) ribosomal protein L14. Transient expression analysis using the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein showed that 50 amino residues located on the N-terminal of the wheat HLP homolog (WHLP) protein acted as a mt-targeting signal (MTS). Expression patterns of the Whlp gene were compared among floral organs of alloplasmic lines of wheat, in which intrinsic cytoplasms were replaced by the cytoplasm of a wild relative Aegilops crassa. In these alloplasmic lines, pistillody (homeotic transformation of stamens into pistil-like organs) is induced by the alien cytoplasm in the absence of nuclear restorer genes. The Whlp transcripts preferentially accumulated in stamens compared with pistils, leaves, and roots. The expression level of Whlp in the pistillate stamens of the alloplasmic lines was similar to that in genuine pistils of both euplasmic lines and fertile alloplasmic lines. The result suggested that the elevated expression of the Whlp gene plays a role in aiding the development of male reproductive organ but not in the determination of its whorl identity. A comparable expression pattern was observed in another nuclear-encoded mt ribosomal protein gene but not in a mt-encoded gene. The different expression patterns of different mt ribosomal protein genes suggest that the abundance of mt ribosomal proteins is differentially regulated in the organ/tissue development in wheat.
