Clusterin, a protein associated with cell death, has been suggested as a marker of renal injury. Correlation of clusterin gene expression with changes in renal function and quantitative measurement of clusterin protein levels after ureteral obstruction have not been previously reported. With unilateral ureteral obstruction in rabbits as the experimental model, the time course of alterations in renal function, clusterin mRNA accumulation, and concentrations of clusterin protein in serum, urine, and renal tissue were investigated. RBF, GFR, and renal concentrating ability (percent sodium reabsorption and urine osmolarity) all decreased (P < 0.05) in the obstructed kidney from control values within 1 day of ureteral obstruction. Clusterin mRNA levels started to rise in the ipsilateral kidney within 12 h of ureteral obstruction and increased up to 10-fold above control levels after 3 days of obstruction. Hybridization histochemistry showed that clusterin mRNA was initially detectable in collecting ducts and distal tubules within 12 h of ureteral obstruction. After 7 days of obstruction, increased accumulation of clusterin mRNA was also detectable in proximal tubular epithelial cells. Clusterin gene expression remained elevated in collecting ducts after 60 days of obstruction. Clusterin expression in the contralateral kidney was increased twofold over control values after 12 h of obstruction. No increase in clusterin mRNA accumulation was detectable after 24 h in the contralateral kidney. Total clusterin protein in the obstructed kidney increased from 0.59 +/- 0.66 (mean +/- 1 SD) to 2.5 +/- 1.3 micrograms after 7 days of ureteral obstruction (P < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
