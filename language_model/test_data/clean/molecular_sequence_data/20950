Lactate dehydrogenases which convert lactate to pyruvate are found in almost every organism and comprise a group of highly divergent proteins in amino acid sequence, catalytic properties, and substrate specificity. While the L-lactate dehydrogenases are among the most studied enzymes, very little is known about the structure and function of D-lactate dehydrogenases (D-LDHs) which include two discrete classes of enzymes that are classified based on their ability to transfer electrons and/or protons to NAD in NAD-dependent lactate dehydrogenases (nLDHs), and FAD in NAD-independent lactate dehydrogenases (iLDHs). In this study, we used a combination of structural and phylogenomic approaches to reveal the likely evolutionary events in the history of the recently described FAD binding oxidoreductase/transferase type 4 family that led to the evolution of D-iLDHs (commonly referred as DLD). Our phylogenetic reconstructions reveal that DLD genes from eukaryotes form a paraphyletic group with respect to D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (D2HGDH). All phylogenetic reconstructions recovered two divergent yeast DLD phylogroups. While the first group (DLD1) showed close phylogenetic relationships with the animal and plant DLDs, the second yeast group (DLD2) revealed strong phylogenetic and structural similarities to the plant and animal D2HGDH group. Our data strongly suggest that the functional assignment of the yeast DLD2 group should be carefully revisited. The present study demonstrates that structural phylogenomic approach can be used to resolve important evolutionary events in functionally diverse superfamilies and to provide reliable functional predictions to poorly characterized genes.
