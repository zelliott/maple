Biomineralization is the process by which living organisms deposit mineral in the extracellular matrix. In nature, almost 50% of biominerals are calcium-bearing minerals. In addition to calcium, we find biominerals formed from silica and magnetite. Calcium-containing biominerals could be either calcium phosphate as in apatite found in vertebrates or calcium carbonate as in calcite and aragonite found in many invertebrates. Since all biomineralization is matrix mediated, an understanding of the nature of the proteins involved is essential in elucidating its mechanism. This review will discuss some of the proteins involved in the process of biomineralization involving calcium. Two proteins, dentin matrix protein 1 and dentin phosphoprotein (Phosphophoryn) will serve as models for the vertebrate system, and two others - P16 and phosphodontin will serve as models for the invertebrate system.
