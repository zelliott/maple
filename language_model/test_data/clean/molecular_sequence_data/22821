Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence techniques have been used to characterize the energetics and dynamics associated with the interaction of an E. coli 16 S rRNA A-site model oligonucleotide and four aminoglycoside antibiotics that exhibit a broad range of antibacterial activity. The results of these characterizations suggest that aminoglycoside-induced reduction in the mobility of an adenine residue at position 1492 of the rRNA A-site is a more important determinant of antibacterial activity than drug affinity for the A-site. This observation is consistent with a recently proposed model for the mechanism of protein synthesis inhibition by aminoglycosides that invokes a drug-induced alteration in the conformational equilibrium of the rRNA A-site (centered around the conserved adenine residues at positions 1492 and 1493), which, in turn, promotes an enhanced interaction between the rRNA and the minihelix formed by the tRNA anticodon and the mRNA codon, even when the anticodon is noncognate. Regarded as a whole, the results reported here indicate that the rational design of antibiotics that target the 16 S rRNA A-site requires consideration of not only the structure and energetics of the drug-RNA complex but also the dynamics associated with that complex.
