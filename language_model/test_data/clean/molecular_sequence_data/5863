Methods for detection of Candida albicans in culture or biological samples were developed by the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with oligonucleotide primers from C. albicans 70 kDa heat shock protein gene (Cahsp70). The PCR amplifies a 335-base pair fragment which is then hybridized with a non-radioactive probe, leading to the specific identification of C. albicans and its differentiation from all other human pathogenic Candida and/or yeast species. Candida albicans could be rapidly detected in human urine and blood, with a sensitivity of 10 and 50 fungal cells per sample, respectively.
