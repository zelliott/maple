The purpose of this study was to investigate the phylogenetic relationship of the Juquitiba virus (JUQV) carried by Oligoryzomys nigripes in endemic and non-endemic areas of Brazil. Wild rodents infected with the Juquitiba virus (JUQV) were sampled from a non-Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome endemic area in Brazil. Three strains from O. nigripes were identified by the sequencing of the complete S segment and compared to previous studies of JUQV available in GenBank. The phylogenetic analysis of the complete S segment revealed two distinct clades; the first clade was composed of the JUQV from two non-endemic areas in Brazil and the second clade contained JUQV strains from Argentina, Paraguay and other Brazilian endemic areas.
