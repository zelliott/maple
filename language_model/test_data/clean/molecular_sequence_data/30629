The transcriptional regulation of the chicken myosin alkali light-chain (MLC) L23 gene was analyzed. Two different types of cis-regulatory regions were identified: one was a silencerlike region located between 3.7 and 2.7 kilobases upstream of the mRNA initiation site, and the other was essential for the expression of L23 in skeletal muscle cells and was located between 106 and 91 base pairs upstream of the cap site. This 16-base-pair cis-acting element was designated as the MLC box since it is well conserved in various muscle-specific MLC promoter regions. The activity of the MLC box showed tissue specificity. To analyze the relationship between the nucleotide sequence and the activity of the MLC box precisely, mutation analysis was performed. The 16-base-pair sequence was indispensable for the active transcription of L23 gene, and the MLC box could function in either orientation. The inverted sequence of the MLC box was similar to the sequence of the alpha-actin CArG box. By using a gel mobility retardation assay, the nuclear protein(s) that binds to both MLC box and CArG box was detected with nuclear extract prepared from chicken embryonic breast muscle. These observations imply that a common factor regulates the coordinate expression of these contractile proteins in muscle differentiation.
