A composite plot for depicting in two dimensions the conformation and the secondary structural features of protein residues has been developed. Instead of presenting the exact values of the main- and side-chain torsion angles (&phi;, psi and chi(1)), it indicates the region in the three-dimensional conformational space to which a residue belongs. Other structural aspects, like the presence of a cis peptide bond and disulfide linkages, are also displayed. The plot may be used to recognize patterns in the backbone and side-chain conformation along a polypeptide chain and to compare protein structures derived from X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy or molecular modelling studies and also to highlight the effect of mutation on structure.
