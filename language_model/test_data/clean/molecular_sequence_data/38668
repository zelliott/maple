A full-length cDNA encoding a novel protein was isolated and sequenced from a human hepatocellular cDNA library. This cDNA consists of 7037 base pairs and has a predicted open reading frame encoding 1924 amino acids. It possesses an RNA-helicase motif containing a DEXH-box in its amino-terminus and an RNase motif in the carboxy-terminus. From a striking homology to Caenorhabditis elegans K12H4.8, it might be a human homolog of the K12H4.8. PCR-based mapping with both a monochromosomal hybrid panel and radiation hybrid cell panels placed the gene to human chromosome 14q31 near the marker D14S605.
