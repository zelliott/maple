The collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) are highly expressed in the vertebrate nervous system. CRMP2 has been shown to function in Semaphorin and lysophosphatidic acid induced growth cone collapse. Correspondingly, the highest levels of CRMP2 protein are found in the distal portion of growing axons. To understand the role of CRMP2 during embryonic development we have documented its expression pattern in zebrafish embryos at multiple stages. We find that CRMP2 is expressed in the major neural clusters of the embryonic brain during the primary stages of neurogenesis. From 20 somites through 30 hpf CRMP2 is expressed in the dorsal rostral cluster of the telencephalon, the ventral rostral cluster of the diencephalon, the ventral caudal cluster of the mesencephalon, and the hindbrain clusters. CRMP2 is also expressed in the trigeminal sensory ganglia and the Rohon Beard cells of the neural tube from 15 somites. By 48 hpf, we find expression of CRMP2 throughout the developing brain, trigeminal sensory ganglia, and Rohon Beard cells. CRMP2 is also detected in the retinal ganglion cell layer of the eye, and in the otic vesicle. Finally, we have compared the expression of CRMP2 to PlexinA4, a Semaphorin receptor expressed in sensory neurons, and find that their expression partially overlaps.
