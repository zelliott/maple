Allergen from the house dust mite (Dermatophagoides sp.) is a major trigger factor of allergic disorders, and its characterization is crucial for the development of specific diagnosis or immunotherapy. Here we report the identification of a novel dust mite (Dermatophagoides farinae) antigen whose primary structure belongs to the gelsolin family, a group of actin cytoskeleton-regulatory proteins. Isolated mite cDNA, termed Der f 16, encodes 480 amino acids comprising a four-repeated gelsolin-like segmental structure, which is not seen in conventional gelsolin family members. Enzyme immunoassay indicated that recombinant Der f 16 protein, prepared using an Escherichia coli expression system, bound IgE from mite-allergic patients at 47% (8/17) frequency. This is the first evidence that the gelsolin family represents a new class of allergen recognizable by atopic patient IgE.
