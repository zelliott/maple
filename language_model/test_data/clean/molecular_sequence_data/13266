We present nucleotide sequence data for mitochondrial DNA extracted from ancient human skeletons of the Yayoi era (ca. 2,000 BP) excavated from the Takuta-Nishibun site in northern Kyushu of Japan. Nucleotide sequence diversity showed that the Yayoi people of the Takuta-Nishibun site were not a genetically homegeneous population. This site shows a diversity in the burial style. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a statistically significant correlation between burial style and the genetic background of the Takuta-Nishibun individuals, and revealed no discrete clusterig patterns for the Yayoi individuals, for early modern Ainu, or for the Jomon people.
