Endangered San Joaquin kit foxes Vulpes macrotis mutica can be sympatrically distributed with as many as four other canids: red fox, gray fox, coyote and domestic dog. Canid scats are often found during routine fieldwork, but cannot be reliably identified to species. To detect and study the endangered kit fox, we developed mitochondrial DNA markers that can be amplified from small amounts of DNA extracted from scats. We amplified a 412-bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene from scat samples and digested it with three restriction enzymes. The resulting restriction profiles discriminated among all five canid species and correctly identified 10 'unknown' fox scats to species in blind tests. We have applied our technique to identify canids species for an environmental management study and a conservation study. We envision that our protocol, and similar ones developed for other endangered species will be greatly used for conservation management in the future.
