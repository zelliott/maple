In vitro mutagenesis of the LTA gene, encoding the A subunit of the Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin, has been used to obtain A subunits deficient in enzymic activity. One inactive A-subunit mutant which contained two amino acid substitutions, was shown to associate with native B subunits to form a holotoxoid lacking toxin activity. A serine to phenylalanine mutation appears to be responsible for the loss of toxicity.
