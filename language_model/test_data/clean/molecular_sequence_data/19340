Three strains, Br3437(T), Br3461 and Br3470, were isolated from nitrogen-fixing nodules on the roots of Mimosa scabrella (Br3437(T)) and Mimosa bimucronata (Br3461, Br3470), both of which are woody legumes native to Brazil. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, all the strains were shown previously to belong to the genus Burkholderia. A polyphasic approach, including DNA-DNA hybridizations, PFGE of whole-genome DNA profiles, whole-cell protein analyses, fatty acid methyl ester analysis and extensive biochemical characterization, was used to clarify the taxonomic position of these strains further; the strains are here classified within a novel species, for which the name Burkholderia nodosa sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain, Br3437(T) (=LMG 23741(T)=BCRC 17575(T)), was isolated from nodules of M. scabrella.
