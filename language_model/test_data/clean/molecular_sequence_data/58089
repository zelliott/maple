Interleukin-1 (IL-1) induces substance P (SP) gene expression in cultured rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG) explants. In order to study the molecular mechanism of this action of IL-1, the presence of an interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) activity and the identity of an mRNA homologous to known IL-1R sequence was determined in SCG. The SP increase is blocked by recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist protein, so IL-1 must be interacting with a specific receptor. We have cloned cDNA homologous to IL-1R type I from rat SCG using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The resulting cDNA sequence is strongly homologous with mouse and human IL-1R cDNA of the T cell and fibroblast type (type I; encoding an 80-kDa protein). mRNA specific for IL-1R can be readily detected in intact SCG by quantitative RT-PCR and S1 hybridization. However, the level of IL-1R mRNA increases 3-6-fold by 2 days in culture. This increase is independent of the presence of dexamethasone, IL-1 beta or IL-1 receptor antagonist protein ligands. The increase of IL-1R following explantation, a model of nerve injury, may provide a mechanism linking inflammatory signalling to neuronal phenotypic changes.
