A novel, Gram-stain-positive, non-motile, facultatively anaerobic, rod- or coccoid-shaped bacterium, designated strain ORY33(T), was isolated from the gut of a camel cricket (Diestrammena coreana). The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain ORY33(T) belonged to the genus Weissella, with highest sequence similarity to Weissella koreensis S-5623(T) (97.7 %). The strain grew optimally at 30 °C and pH 7 in the presence of 0 % (w/v) NaCl. Catalase and oxidase activities were negative. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain ORY33(T) was 45.1 mol%. DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain ORY33(T) and closely related members of the genus Weissella were less than 27 %. The major fatty acids of strain ORY33(T) were C18 : 1ω9c, C16 : 0 and C14 : 0. Based on these phenotypic, phylogenetic and genotypic analyses, strain ORY33(T) represents a novel species belonging to the genus Weissella, for which the name Weissella diestrammenae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is ORY33(T) (= KACC 16890(T) = JCM 18559(T)).
