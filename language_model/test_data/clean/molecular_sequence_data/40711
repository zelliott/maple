Mycelia of basidiomycetes differentiating into fruiting body is a controlled developmental process, however the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. In previous work, a novel fungal Agrocybe aegerita galectin (AAL) was isolated from A. aegerita in our laboratory. AAL was shown to promote mycelial differentiation in A. aegerita and Auricularia polytricha, indicating that AAL might function as a conserved fruiting initiator during basidiomycete mycelia development. In the current work, we investigate the role of AAL in mycelia differentiation and fruiting body formation. First, the expression and localization of AAL in mycelia, primordium and fruiting body were assessed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. AAL was found to be ubiquitously expressed in the primordium and fruiting body but not in the mycelia. AAL facilitated mycelia congregation and promoted fruiting body production when AAL was applied on mycelia. At the same time, when AAL was spread on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium prior to mycelia inoculation, mycelia exhibited slowed growth rates, resulting in mycelia cords formation and inhibition of fruiting body formation. The 5' regulatory sequence of aal was cloned by 'genome walking'. Here, we show that aal lack introns in the coding region and the upstream 740 bp sequence was characterized by the existence of core promoter elements, which included: two CCAAT boxes (-535/-280), a GC box (-145), a TATA box (-30) and a fungal leader intron within the 5' UTR. The identification of regulatory expression elements may provide an explanation to the stage-specific and high-level expression of aal during fruiting development.
