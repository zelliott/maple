Adenoviruses are double stranded DNA viruses that cause an array of diseases. More than 60 types of human adenovirus have been reported so far. The discovery and division of human adenovirus types 52-67 are based on the genomic sequencing and bioinformatic analysisy and different from the pre-existing 51 serotypes identified by traditional serological methods in composition and pathogenicity. The majority of new types of human adenovirus are homologous recombination within the same subgenus, and as a result, certain new serotypes acquire different pathogenicity. Recombination is a common evolutionary way for human adenovirus, however, the mechanism of recombination and potenital danger to human remain unknown. As new types of human adenovirus have been receiving increasing attention, in this review, the latest progress in new types of human adenovirus is summarized.
