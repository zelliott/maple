Protein phosphorylation is an important regulatory post-translational modification in many biochemical processes. The phosphopeptide analysis strategies developed in this study were all at microscale. After using a standard microwave oven to assist protein digestion, phosphoserine and phosphothreonine were tagged with chemical analogues, such as 2-mercaptoethanol and 3-mercapto-1-propanol, to enable simultaneously relative quantitation and identification. This method enabled the use of thio alcohols for direct labeling of phosphorylated sites (not labeled at the mercapto, amino, hydroxyl, or carboxyl groups) of phosphopeptides. Various digestion parameters (e.g., microwave power, reaction time, NH4HCO3 concentration) and derivatization efficiency parameters (e.g., reaction time, labeling tag concentration) were studied and optimized. In both control and experimental samples, microwave-assisted digestion coupled with relative quantitation using analogue tags enabled calculation of phosphopeptide ratios in the same sequence. A non-labeling method was also established for quantifying phosphopeptides in human plasma by using the abundant protein albumin as an internal control for normalizing relative quantities of phosphopeptides. Nano ultra-performance liquid chromatography (nanoUPLC) was combined with LTQ Orbitrap to enable simultaneous protein relative quantitation and identification. These strategies proved to be effective for quantifying phosphopeptides in biological samples.
