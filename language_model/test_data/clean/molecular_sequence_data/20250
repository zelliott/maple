Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, and Bordetella bronchiseptica are pathogens with a complex iron starvation stress response important for adaptation to nutrient limitation and flux in the mammalian host environment. The iron starvation stress response is globally regulated by the Fur repressor using ferrous iron as the co-repressor. Expression of iron transport system genes of Bordetella is coordinated by priority regulation mechanisms that involve iron source sensing. Iron source sensing is mediated by distinct transcriptional activators that are responsive to the cognate iron source acting as the inducer.
