Streptomyces coelicolor is a filamentous, gram-positive bacterium that exhibits a complex cycle of morphological differentiation involving the formation of an aerial mycelium of multinucleoid hyphae which undergo septation to form long chains of spores. We report the identification of two proteins of 13 and 3 kilodaltons, designated SapA and SapB, respectively, that are produced during formation of the aerial mycelium and are found in assocation with purified, mature spores. We cloned the structural gene (sapA) for one of these spore-associated proteins. Nucleotide sequence analysis suggests that the 13-kilodalton polypeptide is derived from a larger pre- or preproprotein containing a leader sequence of 37 amino acids. Nuclease protection-hybridization analysis and experiments using the Vibrio harveyi, luciferase-encoding luxAB operon as a gene tag demonstrated that expression of sapA is controlled from a promoter contained within a region of less than 110 base pairs in length, whose transcription start site is located approximately 50 base pairs upstream from the initiation codon for the sapA open reading frame. Transcription of sapA was induced at the time of appearance of the aerial mycelium, and the level of sapA transcripts was significantly reduced in certain mutants blocked in aerial mycelium (bld) and or spore (whi) formation. As further evidence of the association of sapA transcription with morphological differentiation, experiments in which we monitored sapA transcription topographically by use of a sapA-luxAB operon fusion demonstrated a close spatial correlation between colony regions undergoing aerial mycelium formation and zones of sapA-promoted light emission.
