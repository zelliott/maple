A full-length Hsp83, named SnoHsp83, cDNA from the corn stalk borer, Sesamia nonagrioides, was cloned and sequenced. Genomic analysis showed that the SnoHsp83 gene is unique. The size of the SnoHsp83 cDNA was found to be approximately 2.6 kb. The deduced polypeptide comprised 717 amino acid residues, with a molecular mass of 82.6 kDa. It contained all the highly conserved amino acid motifs that characterize the cytosolic members of the hsp90 family. We investigated the expression of SnoHsp83 gene in response to diapause and heat/cold stress. SnoHsp83 is constitutively expressed in non-diapausing larvae and is induced 15-fold by heat. SnoHsp83 displays a similar pattern to SnoHsc70 under diapause conditions, when extra larval moults occur. Our results indicate that the SnoHsp83 gene could be involved in the developmental process that occurs between two moults.
