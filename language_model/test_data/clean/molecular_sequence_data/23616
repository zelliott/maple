The gene encoding an aromatic and neutral aliphatic amino acid permease of Penicillium chrysogenum was cloned, functionally expressed and characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae M4276. The permease, designated PcMtr, is structurally and functionally homologous to Mtr of Neurospora crassa, and unrelated to the Amino Acid Permease (AAP) family which includes most amino acid permeases in fungi. Database searches of completed fungal genome sequences reveal that Mtr type permeases are not widely distributed among fungi, suggesting a specialized function.
