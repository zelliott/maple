Pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) promotes synthesis and release of sex pheromones in moths. We have identified and functionally expressed a PBAN receptor from Heliothis virescens (HevPBANR) and elucidated structure-activity relationships of PBAN analogs. Screening of a larval CNS cDNA library revealed three putative receptor subtypes and nucleotide sequence comparisons suggest that they are produced through alternative splicing at the 3'-end. RT-PCR amplified preferentially HevPBANR-C from female pheromone glands. CHO cells expressing HevPBANR-C are highly sensitive to PBAN and related analogs, especially those sharing the C-terminal pentapeptide core, FXPRLamide (X=T, S or V). Alanine replacements in the C-terminal hexapeptide (YFTPRLamide) revealed the relative importance of each residue in the active core as follows: R5>L6>F2>>P4>T3>>Y1. This study provides a framework for the rational design of PBANR-specific agonists and/or antagonists that could be exploited for disruption of reproductive function in agriculturally important insect pests.
