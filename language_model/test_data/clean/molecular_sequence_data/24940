Ovaries of bitches are relatively inactive during anoestrus despite apparently adequate circulating FSH concentrations. Alternative FSH receptor (FSH-R) transcripts in bitches might hinder the follicular response to gonadotrophins, which may account for anoestrus. The expression of the full length FSH-R and novel isoforms in bitches was examined using in situ hybridization and RT-PCR analysis. Various PCR primers to the FSH-R were used and its expression was assessed in ovarian tissue at different stages of the oestrous cycle. RT-PCR amplification of the extracellular domain (exon 1-10) was generally successful, indicating that cFSH-R expression (> 90%) occurs throughout the oestrous cycle. Two FSH-R isoforms were sequenced, but there were no clear differences in the pattern of expression between anoestrus and other stages of the oestrous cycle, except that isoform expression was less frequent (30% occurrence) in prepubertal bitches. Data from in situ hybridization showed clear expression of the FSH-R in secondary and antral follicles, and corpora lutea. It was concluded that there is no evidence of a change in the expression of the FSH-R specific to anoestrus.
