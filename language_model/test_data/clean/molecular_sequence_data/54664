A variable migration of linker histone H1.b and H1.c spots in two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel patterns of total erythrocyte histone H1 has been detected during population screening in two differently plumaged Guinea fowl strains. Alloforms, H1.b1 and H1.b2 as well as H1.c1 and H1.c2, differing in apparent molecular weights tended to form only phenotypes b1 and b2 or c1 and c2 in a white-feathered strain while all phenotypes (b1, b2 and b1b2 or c1, c2 and c1c2, respectively) were present in a black-feathered population. Accordingly, the white-feathered population significantly deviated from the Hardy-Weinberg principle (chi-square test, d.f=1, p<<0.001) due to a lack of heterozygotes while the black-feathered population conformed to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.05) at both H1.b and H1.c loci. Differential electrophoretic mobilities of the C-peptides from a partial chemical cleavage (N-bromosuccinimide) or limited enzymatic digestion (Î±-chymotrypsin and protease V8) of the histone H1.b and H1.c alloforms seem to indicate that altered amino acid sequence segments might be located either at the C-terminal end of globular domain or in the C-terminal domain itself.
