The N-terminal part of the CreA protein encompassing two zinc fingers was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with the maltose binding protein (MalE) of E. coli. Our results show that CreA binds to the promoter of the Taa-G2 gene encoding Taka-amylase A of Aspergillus oryzae. DNase I footprinting experiments showed that CreA bound to three sites with high affinity and to one site with low affinity within the first 401-bp region upstream of the transcription initiation site. All of the sites contained sequences related to the CreA consensus binding site (5'-SYGGRG-3'), and are suggested to participate in repression of the Taa-G2 gene in response to glucose.
