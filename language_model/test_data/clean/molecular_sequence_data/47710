Cytoplasmic mRNA localization is one method by which protein production is restricted to a particular intracellular site. We report here a novel mechanism for localization of transcripts encoding distinct protein isoforms to different destinations. Alternative processing of transcripts produced in the Drosophila ovary by the hu-li tai shao (hts) locus introduces distinct 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) that differentially localize the mRNAs. Three classes of hts mRNA (R2, N32 and N4) are synthesized in the germ line nurse cells and encode proteins with adducin-homologous amino-terminal regions but divergent carboxy-terminal domains. The R2 and N32 classes of mRNA remain in the nurse cells and are not transported into the oocyte. In contrast, the N4 class of transcripts is transported from the nurse cells into the oocyte starting at stage 1, is subsequently localized to the oocyte cortex at stage 8 and then to the anterior pole from stage 9 on. All aspects of N4 transcript transport and localization are directed by the 345-nucleotide(nt)-long 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). The organization of localization elements in the N4 3'UTR is modular: a 150 nt core is sufficient to direct transport and localization throughout oogenesis. Additional 3'UTR elements function additively together with this core region at later stages of oogenesis to maintain or enhance anterior transcript anchoring. The swallow locus is required to maintain hts transcripts at the anterior pole of the oocyte and functions through the N4 3'UTR. In addition to the three classes of germ line-expressed hts transcripts, a fourth class (R1) is expressed in the somatic follicle cells that surround the germ line cells. This transcript class encodes the Drosophila orthologue of mammalian adducin.
