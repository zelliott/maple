A transposable element has been isolated from the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana by trapping it in the nitrate reductase structural gene, which has been cloned from this species. The element had inserted in the first exon of the nia gene and appeared to have duplicated the sequence TA at the site of insertion. It was 3336 bp long with 30-bp imperfect, inverted, terminal repeats. The element, called hupfer, contained an open reading frame encoding a 321-amino acid protein similar to the IS630- or mariner-Tcl-like transposases, and a residual sequence of about 2 kb which was not significantly similar to any published sequence. There are fewer than five copies of this transposable element present per genome in the fungus.
