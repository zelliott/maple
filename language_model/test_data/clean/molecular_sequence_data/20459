Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) infections are a leading cause of infantile diarrhea in developing nations. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) characterizes bacterial strains based on the sequences of internal fragments in housekeeping genes. Little is known about strains of EPEC analyzed by MLST from Brazil. In this study, a diverse collection of 29 EPEC strains isolated from patients with diarrhea, admitted to the University Hospital of Ribeirao Preto, was characterized by MLST. Strain analysis demonstrated 22 different sequence types (STs), of which almost half (48%) were new, indicating a high genotype diversity. The 22 STs were divided by eBURST into 12 clonal complexes. It was not possible to correlate typical and atypical EPEC with other strains in the MLST database. This is the first study that analyzed EPEC strains from South America that are included in the E. coli MLST database. Nine (31%) out of 29 strains are part of the CC10 clonal complex, the major clonal complex in the database, which comprises 174 strains and 86 different STs, suggesting that these strains might be the most important intestinal pathogenic E. coli worldwide. Genetic relationships between typical and atypical EPEC, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, and enteroaggregative E. coli strains were not established by MLST.
