Capillary electrophoresis has been used to determine binding constants of tioconazole enantiomers with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD), after correcting for changes in mobility with increasing viscosity. The predicted and observed values of enantiomeric mobility difference were found to be maximum at a concentration of HP-beta-CD equal to the reciprocal of the average binding constant.
