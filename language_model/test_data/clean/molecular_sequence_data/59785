The halophilic Archaeon Haloferax mediterranei exudes into the growth medium a high molecular weight sulfated polysaccharide. The structure of the repeating unit of this polymer was determined by a combination of glycose, methylation, and sulfate analysis, periodate oxidation, and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic analysis of the native and periodate-oxidised/reduced polysaccharides. The location of the sulfate group was established from the 1H and 13C NMR data. The structure of the repeating unit of the polysaccharide may be written as [formula: see text]
