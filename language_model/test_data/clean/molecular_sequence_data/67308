BA42 is a protein belonging to the psychrophilic bacteria Bizionia argentinensis sp. nov. Bioinformatics analysis showed that it presents significant sequence identity with a Pfam A family, DUF 477, found both in eukarya and eubacteria but of unknown function in all these organisms. Here, we report the NMR spectra assignment of this 145 amino acid protein. These data will allow performing NMR structural studies with the aim of using the three-dimensional structure as relevant information in order to determine the function of this family of proteins.
