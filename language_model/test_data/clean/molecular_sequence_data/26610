In this study, the dicer gene (designated as cidicer) was identified and characterized from grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella. The complementary DNA (cDNA) of cidicer contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 5646 nucleotides (nts) encoding a putative protein of 1881 amino acids (aa). The deduced Dicer protein contained all known functional domains identified in other organisms. Tissue tropism analysis indicated that cidicer is abundantly expressed in brain, gill, head kidney, liver, spleen, heart, muscle and intestine. In the C. idella kidney (CIK) cells, messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of cidicer was significantly up-regulated at 24 h (6·36-fold, P < 0·01) after grass carp reovirus (GCRV) infection, and its transcriptional expression level was also transiently induced to a high level (6·54-fold, P < 0·01) at 2 h post-stimulation of synthetic double-stranded polyinosinic-polycytidylic potassium salt [poly(I:C)]. In vivo analysis further showed that the expression of cidicer mRNA in the liver was induced to a significantly high level at 12 h (8·46-fold, P < 0·01), and then dropped to normal level at 72 h post-challenge with GCRV. The transcriptional expression pattern of cidicer in the spleen tissue was similar to that of liver tissue upon GCRV challenge. These results collectively implied that the identified cidicer was an inducible gene responding to viral infection both in vitro and in vivo, and the data would shed light on the interaction between RNA interference (RNAi) antiviral pathway and aquareovirus infection.
