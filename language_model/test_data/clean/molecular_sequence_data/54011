Cells of the wild-type yeast strain Zygosaccharomyces bisporus CBS 702 form alpha-hydroxy ketones from aromatic amino acid precursors during fermentation. Pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC, E.C. 4.1.1.1), the key enzyme of this biotransformation catalysing the non-oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and other 2-oxo-acids, was purified and characterised. The active enzyme is homotetrameric (alpha4) with a molecular mass of about 244 kDa. Activation of PDC by its substrate pyruvate results in a sigmoidal dependence of the reaction rate from substrate concentration (apparent Km value 1.73 mM; Hill coefficient 2.10). A cDNA library was screened using a PCR-based procedure, and a 1856 bp cDNA of PDC was identified and sequenced. The cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 563 amino acid residues (monomeric unit). Sequence alignments demonstrate high homologies (> 80%) to PDC genes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces lactis and Kluyveromyces marxianus.
