We recently identified a region within the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 isoform (residues 579 to 684) which is essential for inhibition of transport activity by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (Cabado, A. G., Yu, F. H., Kapus, A., Gergely, L., Grinstein, S., and Orlowski, J. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 3590-3599). To further define determinants of PKA regulation, six serine residues located in potential recognition sequences for PKA within, or adjacent to, this region (positions 552, 605, 634, 661, 690, and 691) were altered either independently or in various combinations using site-directed mutagenesis. Wild type and mutant NHE3s tagged with the influenza virus hemagglutinin epitope were stably expressed in exchanger-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells (AP-1) for functional studies. Of the individual mutations examined, only substitutions at Ser605 or Ser634 affected sensitivity to forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, although partial inhibition of NHE3 activity by forskolin remained. By contrast, simultaneous mutation of both these serines completely abolished cAMP-mediated inhibition of NHE3 without greatly affecting basal transport activity. Two-dimensional analysis of tryptic digests of immunoprecipitated NHE3 labeled in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate revealed several phosphopeptides under basal conditions. Phosphorylation was increased approximately 3-fold in one of these peptides following forskolin treatment, and this change was eliminated by mutation of residue Ser605. Thus, phosphorylation of Ser605 is essential for cAMP-mediated inhibition of NHE3. In addition, Ser634 is also required for the effect of cAMP, even though this residue does not become phosphorylated upon activation of PKA.
