The 16S rRNA or rRNA gene sequences of the type strains of 5 species of Rhodobacter, Rhodopseudomonas blastica and Paracoccus denitrificans were determined. The sequence analysis revealed that Rhodobacter species, whose intracytoplasmic membrane systems were characteristically vesicular, composed a sole cluster. Rhodopseudomonas blastica, whose intracytoplasmic membrane system was lamellar, was included in the cluster of Rhodobacter. The phylogenetic co-clustering of these bacteria conformed to their possessing of the identical types of carotenoids. Paracoccus denitrificans, which is nonphototrophic, is a right member of the Rhodobacter cluster. Rhodobacter species, Rhodopseudomonas blastica and Paracoccus denitrificans are apart from the other phototrophic bacteria and have the common deletions of 21 bases at the positions 1258 to 1278 (Escherichia coli numbering system). It was demonstrated that the morphological character "intracytoplasmic membrane structure", that has been regarded as a generic criterion does not reflect the phylogeny in the phototrophic bacteria. The transfer of Rhodopseudomonas blastica to the genus Rhodobacter is proposed.
