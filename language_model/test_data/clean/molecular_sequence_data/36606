The tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) nuclear genome contains long tracts of DNA (i.e. in excess of 18 kb) with high sequence homology to the tobacco plastid genome. Five lambda clones containing these nuclear DNA sequences encompass more than one-third of the tobacco plastid genome. The absolute size of these five integrants is unknown but potentially includes uninterrupted sequences that are as large as the plastid genome itself. An additional sequence was cloned consisting of both nuclear and plastid-derived DNA sequences. The nuclear component of the clone is part of a family of repeats, which are present in about 400 locations in the nuclear genome. The homologous sequences present in chromosomal DNA were very similar to those of the corresponding sequences in the plastid genome. However significant sequence divergence, including base substitutions, insertions and deletions of up to 41 bp, was observed between these nuclear sequences and the plastid genome. Associated with the larger deletions were sequence motifs suggesting that processes such as DNA replication slippage and excision of hairpin loops may have been involved in deletion formation.
