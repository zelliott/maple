In this study a protein expression system was used to synthesize recombinant human serum albumin containing a mutation that has been shown to result in familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia. Equilibrium dialysis was used to measure the binding of this recombinant human serum albumin with thyroxine. The association constant determined for the binding of this human serum albumin variant with thyroxine was shown to be 65-fold greater than that of recombinant normal human serum albumin.
