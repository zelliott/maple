In an attempt to identify relationships among genomes of the allotetraploid Pennisetum purpureum Schumach and closely related Pennisetum species with which it can be successfully hybridized, repetitive DNA sequences were examined. Digestion with KpnI revealed two highly repetitive fragments of 140 bp and 160 bp. The possibility that these sequences could be used as genome markers was investigated. Average sequences were determined for the 140 bp and 160 bp KpnI families from P. purpureum and P. squamulatum Fresen. Average sequences (based upon four or five repeats) were determined for the P. glaucum (L.) R. Br. 140 bp KpnI family and the diploid P. hohenackeri Hochst. ex Steud. 160 bp KpnI family. The average sequences of the 160 bp KpnI families in P. purpureum and P. squamulatum differ by only nine bases. The 140 bp KpnI families of the three related species, P. purpureum, P. squamulantum, and P. glaucum are nearly identical, and thus likely represent a recent divergence from a common progenitor or a common genome. Each repetitive sequence may contain internal duplications, which probably diverged following amplification of the original sequence. The 140 bp KpnI repeat probably evolved from the 160 bp KpnI repeat since the missing 18 bp segment is part of the internal duplication that is otherwise conserved in the subrepeats. Tandemly arrayed repetitive sequences in plants are likely to be composed of subrepeats which have been duplicated and amplified.
