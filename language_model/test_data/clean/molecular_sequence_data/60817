Most simple retroviruses induce tumors of a single cell type when infected into susceptible hosts. The SRS 19-6 murine leukemia virus (MuLV), which originated in mainland China, induces leukemias of multiple cellular origins. Indeed, infected mice often harbor more than one tumor type. Since the enhancers of many MuLVs are major determinants of tumor specificity, we tested the role of the SRS 19-6 MuLV enhancers in its broad disease specificity. The enhancer elements of the Moloney MuLV (M-MuLV) were replaced by the 170-bp enhancers of SRS 19-6 MuLV, yielding the recombinants DeltaMo+SRS(+) and DeltaMo+SRS(-) M-MuLV. M-MuLV normally induces T-lymphoid tumors in all infected mice. Surprisingly, when neonatal mice were inoculated with DeltaMo+SRS(+) or DeltaMo+SRS(-) M-MuLV, all tumors were of T-lymphoid origin, typical of M-MuLV rather than SRS 19-6 MuLV. Thus, the SRS 19-6 MuLV enhancers did not confer the broad disease specificity of SRS 19-6 MuLV to M-MuLV. However, all tumors contained DeltaMo+SRS M-MuLV proviruses with common enhancer alterations. These alterations consisted of tandem multimerization of a subregion of the SRS 19-6 enhancers, encompassing the conserved LVb and core sites and adjacent sequences. Moreover, when tumors induced by the parental SRS 19-6 MuLV were analyzed, most of the T-lymphoid tumors had similar enhancer alterations in the same region whereas tumors of other lineages retained the parental SRS 19-6 MuLV enhancers. These results emphasize the importance of a subregion of the SRS 19-6 MuLV enhancer in induction of T-cell lymphoma. The relevant sequences were consistent with crucial sequences for T-cell lymphomagenesis identified for other MuLVs such as M-MuLV and SL3-3 MuLV. These results also suggest that other regions of the SRS 19-6 MuLV genome contribute to its broad leukemogenic spectrum.
