A Cameroonian patient with antibodies reacting simultaneously to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) group O- and group M-specific V3-loop peptides was identified. In order to confirm that this patient was coinfected with both viruses, PCRs with O- and M-specific discriminating primers corresponding to different regions of the genome were carried out with both primary lymphocyte DNA and the corresponding viral strains isolated from three consecutive patient samples. The PCR data suggested that this patient is coinfected with a group M virus and a recombinant M/O virus. Indeed, only type M gag sequences could be amplified, while for the env region, both type M and O sequences were amplified, from plasma or from DNA extracted from primary lymphocytes. Sequence analysis of a complete recombinant genome isolated from the second sample (97CA-MP645 virus isolate) revealed two intergroup breakpoints, one in the vpr gene and the second in the long terminal repeat region around the TATA box. Comparison of the type M sequences shared by the group M and the recombinant M/O viruses showed that these sequences were closely related, with only 3% genetic distance, suggesting that the M virus was one of the parental viruses. In this report we describe for the first time a recombination event in vivo between viruses belonging to two different groups, leading to a replicative virus. Recombination between strains with such distant lineages (65% overall homology) may contribute substantially to the emergence of new HIV-1 variants. We documented that this virus replicates well and became predominant in vitro. At this time, group O viruses represent a minority of the strains responsible for the HIV-1 pandemic. If such recombinant intergroup viruses gained better fitness, inducing changes in their biological properties compared to the parental group O virus, the prevalences of group O sequences could increase rapidly. This will have important implications for diagnosis of HIV-1 infections by serological and molecular tests, as well as for antiviral treatment.
