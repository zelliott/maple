Virulent and avirulent clones of Leishmania mexicana amazonensis promastigotes or amastigotes were loaded with the fluorescent reagent fura 2/AM to measure intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i). When the cells were treated with the calcium ionophore ionomycin in the nominal absence of extracellular Ca2+, there was an increase of [Ca2+]i that was further elevated by addition of either NH4Cl, nigericin, or the vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1. Similar results were obtained when the order of additions was reversed. Taking into account the relative importance of the ionomycin-releasable and the ionomycin plus NH4Cl-releasable Ca2+ pools, it is apparent that a significant amount of the Ca2+ stored in L. mexicana amazonensis promastigotes and amastigotes is present in an acidic compartment rich in Ca2+ (acidocalcisome). Results indicated that more releasable Ca2+ is stored intracellularly in virulent amastigotes than in virulent promastigotes or avirulent cells of both stages. This higher amount of releasable Ca2+ was correlated with the presence of Ca2+ signals in the virulent amastigotes during invasion of macrophages. Ca2+ signals and invasion were reduced by preloading the parasites with intracellular Ca2+ chelators (1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid/AM) and quin 2/AM) but not by a non-Ca2+-chelating analog (N-(2-methoxyphenyl)imidoacetic acid/AM). The gene encoding an organelle-type Ca2+-ATPase was cloned and sequenced and found overexpressed in virulent amastigotes as compared with all other forms. Together, these results demonstrate a significant link between expression of a Ca2+-ATPase, intracellular Ca2+ pool content and signaling, and virulence.
