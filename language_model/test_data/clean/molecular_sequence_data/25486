The transcriptional enhancer of the Moloney Murine Leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) is comprised of a 75-bp direct repeat, each of which contains multiple binding sites for transcription factors. The occupancy of these sites determines the tissue specificity of expression and disease tropism of the virus. The identification of proteins that bind to this enhancer is therefore required in order to understand the molecular basis of this viral-host interaction. Analysis of the nucleic acid sequence of the Mo-MuLV has identified 4 potential binding sites for the transcription factor NF-1. Evidence is presented using DNAase I protection analysis that NF-1 binds to these 4 sites within the enhancer. The potential role of NF-1 binding in tissue specific expression of Mo-MuLV is discussed.
