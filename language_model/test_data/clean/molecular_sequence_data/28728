Ribosomal protein L5, a 5S rRNA binding protein in the large subunit, is composed of a five-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and four alpha-helices, and folds in a way that is topologically similar to the ribonucleprotein (RNP) domain [Nakashima et al., RNA 7, 692-701, 20011. The crystal structure of ribosomal protein L5 (BstL5) from Bacillus stearothermophilus suggests that a concave surface formed by an anti-parallel beta-sheet and long loop structures are strongly involved in 5S rRNA binding. To identify amino acid residues responsible for 5S rRNA binding, we made use of Ala-scanning mutagenesis of evolutionarily conserved amino acids occurred at beta-strands and loop structures in BstL5. The mutation of Lys33 at the beta 1-strand caused a significant reduction in 5S rRNA binding. In addition, the Arg92, Phe122, and Glu134 mutations on the beta2-strand, the alpha3-beta4 loop, and the beta4-beta5 loop, respectively, resulted in a moderate decrease in the 5S rRNA binding affinity. In contrast, mutation of the conserved residue Pro65 at the beta2-strand had little effect on the 5S rRNA binding activity. These results, taken together with previous results, identified Lys33, Asn37, Gln63, and Thr90 on the beta-sheet structure, and Phe77 at the beta2-beta3 loop as critical residues for the 5S rRNA binding. The contribution of these amino acids to 5S rRNA binding was further quantitatively evaluated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis by the use of BIAcore. The results showed that the amino acids on the beta-sheet structure are required to decrease the dissociation rate constant for the BstL5-5S rRNA complex, while those on the loops are to increase the association rate constant for the BstL5-5S rRNA interaction.
