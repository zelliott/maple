The position of felid herpesvirus 1 within the alphaherpesvirus subfamily was investigated using molecular phylogenetic techniques applied to multiple sequence alignments of recently reported FHV-1 gene homologs (glycoprotein B, ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase). FHV-1 was most closely related to other carnivore alphaherpesviruses, (phocid herpesvirus 1 and canid herpesvirus 1) and to the equid herpesviruses 1 and 4.
