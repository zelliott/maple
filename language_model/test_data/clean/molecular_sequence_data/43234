The characterization of novel cytoplasmic, structural, and enzymatic proteins has been enhanced by a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific for protein substrates of transforming and nontransforming c-Src mutants. These protein substrates have included the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), cortactin, AFAP-110, p120CAS, and p130CAS. The monoclonal antibody 4G8 was generated as part of this panel of antibodies and was used to isolate the human gene for a 167-kD polypeptide. The cDNA sequence is 5,238 nucleotides in length with a predicted open reading frame consisting of 1,382 amino acids. The polypeptide is largely hydrophilic and highly charged. The central region of p167 has 88% identity with the entire 278-amino-acid encoded sequence of the murine centrosomin A gene. The carboxyl third of p167 contains a unique cluster of 10 amino acid repeats with the consensus sequence (A/M)DDDRGPRRG. The p167 protein was found primarily in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes and is part of a multicomponent protein complex with prominent members of 167, 120, 64, 45, 40, 38, and 25 kD. Finally, we illustrate the conservation of p167 and its associated complex, and demonstrate its expression in different human tissues and cell types. The data suggest that p167 is novel and has an important cellular function as a cytoplasmic structural protein.
