MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that have emerged in recent years as central regulators of eukaryotic gene expression. In mammalian systems, miRNAs are associated with numerous pathological and physiological pathways. miRNAs are important in many viral infections, with different viral families expressing their own miRNAs, manipulating host miRNA expression, or showing direct or indirect regulation by host or viral miRNAs. In this chapter we will examine the current evidence for interplay between the miRNA pathway and viral infections in mammals.
