One of three gene copies encoding ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (AmoA) and flanking sequences was isolated from genomic DNA of the chemolithotrophic soil bacterium Nitrosospira sp. NpAV using oligodeoxyribonucleotide primers and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The gene (amoA) encodes a 274-amino-acid polypeptide which has similarity to the ammonia monooxygenase acetylene-binding protein from Nitrosomonas europaea.
