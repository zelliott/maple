Ehrlichia spp. from human and equine sources in the northeastern Unites States were detected by PCR, isolated, and propagated in the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line. Growth of Ehrlichia from both equine and human sources was enhanced by addition of retinoic acid, which causes granulocytic differentiation of the HL-60 cells. DNA sequencing of a portion of the 16S rDNA gene supported the hypothesis that the same pathogen was responsible for both equine and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis.
