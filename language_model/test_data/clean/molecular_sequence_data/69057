The pea late nodulin gene PsNOD6 has been cloned and sequenced. PsNOD6 is homologous to the pea early nodulin genes PsNOD3 and PsENOD14. In situ hybridization experiments showed that, like the PsENOD3 and PsENOD14 genes, the PsNOD6 gene is only expressed in the infected cell type. The PsNOD6 gene is first expressed at the transition of the pre-fixation zone II into the interzone II-III (the amyloplast-rich zone preceding the fixation zone III), whereas the early nodulin genes PsENOD3 and PsENOD14 are already induced in the pre-fixation zone II. Thus these nodulin genes encoding homologous proteins are induced at consecutive stages of nodule development. The expression of the late nodulin genes encoding leghaemoglobin precedes the expression of the late nodulin gene PsNOD6. Therefore these late nodulin genes have to be regulated by different mechanisms despite the fact they are expressed in the same cell type. This conclusion is consistent with the fact that PsNOD6 lacks one of the conserved regions occurring in the promoters of all other late nodulin genes studied.
