The polymerase chain reaction was used to survey HOM/Hox type homeobox genes in the North American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus. The survey reveals 28 different homeobox fragments possessing 44-80% nucleotide sequence similarity with HOM-C sequences in Drosophila and Hox B sequences in mouse. Limulus has one to four representatives of HOM/Hox cognates when fragments are assigned according to amino acid identity. A parsimony analysis including the Limulus sequences and homologous mouse Hox B and Drosophila HOM-C sequences reveals several instances of monophyletic groupings of Limulus homeoboxes with a Drosophila or mouse gene as the sister branch. Under the current model of HOM/Hox cluster evolution, these results suggest that Limulus has as many as four HOM/Hox type clusters. This is the first evidence suggesting the presence of multiple clusters in a nonvertebrate taxon. Putative homologs of mouse Hoxb-3 in Limulus suggest that the gene was present in the common ancestor of arthropods and vertebrates and has been lost in Drosophila.
