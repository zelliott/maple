We propose a multiple alignment of the sequence of formate dehydrogenase with the D-specific 2-hydroxy acid dehydrogenases family. Structurally conserved regions are predicted for those sequences corresponding to important regions of the catalytic and the coenzyme binding domains defined from the known three-dimensional structure of the formate dehydrogenase, namely the nicotinamide binding site (beta D to beta F) and the beta A-loop-alpha B region containing the typical glycine pattern of the adenosine binding site, the catalytic histidine/aspartic acid pair and an arginine probably involved in the interaction with the carboxyl group of the substrate.
