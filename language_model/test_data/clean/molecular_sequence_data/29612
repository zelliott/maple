Pollinosis to Chenopodium album has been reported, but no data are available on its allergenic proteins.

An allergen from C. album pollen has been isolated by means of gel permeation and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Molecular characterization was achieved by concanavalin A reaction, mass spectrometry, Edman degradation and cDNA sequence. Antigenic analyses were performed by immunoblotting, ELISA, and ELISA inhibition, using sera from allergic patients, two Ole e 1-specific monoclonal antibodies and an Ole e 1-specific polyclonal antiserum.

The isolated allergen, Che a 1, is a glycoprotein of molecular mass 17.088 kD and 143 amino acid residues, whose sequence exhibits 27-45% identity with known members of the Ole e 1-like protein family. 77% of sera from patients allergic to chenopod pollen were reactive to Che a 1. No correlation was found between the IgE reactivities to Che a 1 and Ole e 1, the major allergens from olive pollen, and both allergens display low, although detectable, IgE and IgG cross-reactivities.

Che a 1, a relevant allergen from chenopod pollen, is structurally related to the Ole e 1-like protein family, but exhibits significant differences on its polypeptide sequence that could explain its different antigenic behavior and limited cross-reactivity.
