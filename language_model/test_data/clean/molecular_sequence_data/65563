To improve heterologous gene expression in Trichoderma reesei, a set of optimal artificial cellobiohydrolase I gene (cbh1) promoters was obtained. The region from -677 to -724 with three potential glucose repressor binding sites was deleted. Then the region from -620 to -820 of the modified cbh1 promoter, including the CCAAT box and the Ace2 binding site, was repeatedly inserted into the modified cbh1 promoter, obtaining promoters with copy numbers 2, 4, and 6. The results showed that the glucose repression effects were abolished and the expression level of the glucuronidase (gus) reporter gene regulated by these multi-copy promoters was markedly enhanced as the copy number increased simultaneously. The data showed the great promise of using the promoter artificial modification strategy to increase heterologous gene expression in filamentous fungi and provided a set of optional high-expression vectors for gene function investigation and strain modification.
