Viral infections produce severe respiratory morbidity in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). CF cells are more susceptible to virus in part because of impaired airway epithelial activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1). As Stat1 is a fundamental regulator of antiviral defenses, we hypothesized that there may be multiple alterations in the antiviral defense of CF epithelium compared with normal (NL). To obtain a comprehensive view of mucosal host responses to influenza and characterize the difference between CF and NL responses to influenza, gene expression profiles of primary human airway epithelial cells (HAEC) were evaluated using an interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes/AU/double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) microarray or quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) following influenza A infection. Gene expression was significantly modified by influenza in NL (228 genes) and CF (101 genes), with a similar pattern of gene response but with overall less numbers of responsive genes in CF (p < 0.05). Moreover, CF cells had less IFN-related antiviral gene induction at 24 h but greater inflammatory cytokine gene induction at 1 h after infection. Taken together, the lesser antiviral and greater early inflammatory response likely contribute to the severe respiratory illness of CF patients with viral infections.
