P2X receptors are ion channels gated by extracellular ATP. We report here cloning of a P2X(2) receptor splice variant (P2X(2-2)) carrying a 207 bp deletion in the intracellular C-terminus and the analysis of the corresponding genomic structure of the P2X(2) gene. P2X(2-2) is as highly expressed as the original P2X(2) sequence in various tissues. ATP-activated currents mediated by heterologous expressed P2X(2) or P2X(2-2) receptors showed significant differences in desensitization time constants and steady-state currents in the continuous presence of ATP. These results imply functional differences between cells differentially expressing these P2X(2) isoforms.
