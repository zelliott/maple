We describe sequence-specific primer (SSP) combinations for use in a one-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) typing system to determine HLA-A locus subtypes of A9 (A23, A24), A10 (A25, A26, A43), A28 (A*6801, A*6802, A*6901) and A19 (A*2901, A*2902, A*3001, A*3002, A31, A32, A33) from genomic DNA. SSP's were designed on the basis of the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) in which a mismatch at the 3' residue inhibits non-specific amplification. The SSP combinations described extend our low-resolution typing system, to provide a high-definition typing of the HLA-A locus.
