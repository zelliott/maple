We have identified four overlapping genomic DNA clones coding for human class 1 heparin-binding growth factor (HBGF-1), also known as acidic fibroblast growth factor, by screening genomic DNA libraries with an HBGF-1 cDNA probe. The exon-intron structure of the HBGF-1 gene was determined by Southern hybridization and nucleotide sequence analysis. The complete amino acid sequence of human HBGF-1 was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of these genomic DNA clones. The predicted amino acid sequence is identical to the published amino acid sequence determined by protein sequencing. Southern blot analysis of human DNA suggested that there is a single-copy gene coding for HBGF-1. A 4.5-kilobase mRNA and two minor species (3.4 and 2.0 kilobases) homologous to the HBGF-1 gene were detected in cellular RNA isolated from human adult brain and kidney. The HBGF-1 mRNAs from brain and kidney had slightly different sizes. The mechanism for the synthesis of different sizes of mRNA was not determined. We also detected HBGF-1 transcript from glioblastoma cells, fetal brain, and kidney but not from placenta or fetal liver. Since HBGF-1 is an angiogenic factor, these data suggest that it may play a role in embryonic angiogenesis during fetal development.
