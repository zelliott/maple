The synthesis, by means of the standard phosphoramidite chemistry, of modified oligodeoxynucleotides (5-20 residues) containing 2'-amino-2'-deoxypyrimidine nucleosides has been carried out, and their ability to form duplexes with complementary DNA has been investigated. A high reactivity of such compounds in N-acylation was shown.
