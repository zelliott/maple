Bacillus stearothermophilus contains two carbamoyl-phosphate synthetases (CPS), one specific for pyrimidine biosynthesis and the other for arginine biosynthesis. The pyrimidine-specific CPS is repressed by exogenous pyrimidines, and its activity is inhibited by UMP and activated by 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribosyl diphosphate. The arginine-specific CPS is similarly repressed by exogenous arginine but its activity is not sensitive to these or other potential effectors. Each of the two enzymes consist of two unequal subunits, as is the case for other microbial CPS; however, the large subunit for the arginine-specific CPS is smaller than that for the pyrimidine-specific enzyme. Comparison of the derived amino acid sequence for the cloned large subunit of the arginine-specific CPS with those for subunits from pyrimidine-sensitive CPS showed significant similarity throughout the polypeptides except at the carboxy terminus, which was identified by other laboratories to contain the binding site for the pyrimidine effector. Unlike the results previously reported for CPS from an enteric mesophile, the kinetic properties of the arginine-specific CPS were not affected by growth of B. stearothermophilus at temperatures near the minimal growth temperature. Furthermore, calorimetric studies showed that the thermal stability of cloned CPS was identical regardless of the growth temperature of B. stearothermophilus between 42 degrees C and 63 degrees C. The thermal stability of cloned CPS was not affected by expression at 37 C in Bacillus subtilis or Escherichia coli. In contrast, the thermal stabilities for CPS and other proteins were higher in extracts of cells grown at higher temperatures. These results indicate that cellular factors, probably chaperonins, are necessary for thermal stability of proteins at and below the optimal temperature for this thermophile.
