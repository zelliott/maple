In a previous publication we identified a novel human GTP-binding protein that was related to DRG, a developmentally regulated GTP-binding protein from the central nervous system of mouse. Here we demonstrate that both the human and the mouse genome possess two closely related drg genes, termed drg1 and drg2. The two genes share 62% sequence identity at the nucleotide and 58% identity at the protein level. The corresponding proteins appear to constitute a separate family within the superfamily of the GTP-binding proteins. The DRG1 and the DRG2 mRNA are widely expressed in human and mouse tissues and show a very similar distribution pattern. The human drg1 gene is located on chromosome 22q12, the human drg2 gene on chromosome 17p12. Distantly related species including Caenorhabditis elegans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae also possess two drg genes. In contrast, the genomes of archaebacteria (Halobium, Methanococcus, Thermoplasma) harbor only one drg gene, while eubacteria do not seem to contain any. The high conservation of the polypeptide sequences between distantly related organisms indicates an important role for DRG1 and DRG2 in a fundamental pathway.
