Schistosomes have a complex life cycle (vertebrate and molluscan hosts as well as larvae living freely in water) in which they are exposed to different environments and temperatures (20 degrees C - 37 degrees C). Since heat shock genes are activated in response to stress and during development [1], it is of interest to study the hsp70 gene family in schistosome. To approach this issue we have isolated from Schistosoma mansoni a genomic clone containing the complete coding region of hsp70 and the 5' flanking DNA with transcription regulatory elements including HSE (heat shock element) sequences.
