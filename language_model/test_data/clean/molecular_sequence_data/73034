Metal-catalyzed oxidation of proteins represents an important pathway of post-translational modification. We utilized human growth hormone (hGH), a protein with a well defined metal-binding site, to study the detailed mechanism of metal-catalyzed oxidation by ascorbate/Cu(II)/O2. Particularly His18 and His21 within the metal-binding site were oxidized, predominantly to 2-oxo-His with the incorporated oxygen originating from molecular oxygen, based on amino acid analysis, tryptic mapping, mass spectrometry, isotopic labeling, and 1H NMR. The anaerobic reduction of a hGH/Cu(II) mixture by ascorbate generated a hGH-Cu(I) complex with NMR spectral features different from those of native hGH and hGH/Cu(II). The anaerobic reaction of this hGH-Cu(I) complex with hydrogen peroxide resulted in the oxidation of His18 and His21, suggesting that a fraction of Cu(I) was bound at the metal-binding site of hGH. Site-specific oxidation of hGH required an intact metal-binding site and could largely (about 80%) be inhibited by the presence of >/=28% (v/v) 1-propanol which appears (i) to perturb the metal-binding site and (ii) to interact with a reactive oxygen species formed at the perturbed metal-binding site. The inhibition by 1-propanol-d7 (CD3CD2CD2OH) was significantly lower than that by 1-propanol-h7 with [residual hGH]1-propanol-h7/[residual hGH]1-propanol-d7 = 1.95 at 30% (v/v) 1-propanol, reflecting a kinetic isotope effect close to that for the reaction of a hydroxyl radical with Calpha-H/D bonds of methanol, suggesting the involvement of a hydroxyl radical-like species in the oxidation of His.
