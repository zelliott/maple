The present study was aimed at determining the role of paraquat (PQ) in the activation of the NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) pathway and the possible neuroprotective effects of tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) pretreatment on PQ-induced neurodegeneration in vivo and in vitro. 7 mg/kg PQ treatment of male C57BL/6 mice caused decreased spontaneous locomotor activity, decreased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons, increased terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells in the substantia nigra, as well as increased protein levels of both nuclear Nrf2 and HO-1. In PQ-treated mice, pretreatment with 1 % tBHQ (w/w) significantly attenuated impairments in behavioral performance, decreased TH-positive neurons, and increased TUNEL-positive cells in the substantia nigra, as well as increased protein expression of both nuclear Nrf2 and HO-1. Pretreatment with 40 μM tBHQ protected PC12 cells against 100 and 300 μM PQ-mediated cytotoxicity. The dual-luciferase reporter gene also revealed that the transcriptional activation of HO-1 gene expression of the antioxidant responsive element via Nrf2 occurred as a consequence of 100 and 300 μM PQ exposure. Collectively, these results clearly indicated for the first time that the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in the substantia nigra was activated by PQ, and pretreatment with tBHQ conferred neuroprotection against PQ-induced Parkinsonism presumably by increasing Nrf2 and HO-1 expression.
