As a continuation of our program to study the structure-function relationship of the peptide hormone somatostatin, we report the synthesis and biological potencies of a series of cyclic hexapeptide analogs related to somatostatin. The parent peptide of this series was designed by Veber and coworkers, c[-Pro6-Phe7-D-Trp8-Lys9-Thr10-Phe11-], and has been reported to be superactive in the inhibition of the release of growth hormone. (The superscript numbers refer to the positions of residues in native somatostatin). The series of analogs has been designed to examine the role of the so-called bridging region, Phe11-Pro6, which has been postulated to be important in maintaining the proper conformation of the biologically active tetrapeptide, Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr. We have incorporated peptidomimetics and the retro-inverso modification into the bridging region of the molecule, with the aim of affecting the conformational preferences found in the parent peptide. Results from the biological assay--in vitro inhibition of growth hormone--and the conformational analysis (adjoining paper) of our analogs will provide insight into the relationship between structure and biological activity of somatostatin.
