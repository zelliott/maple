A new actinomycete strain designated TN256, producing antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria and fungi, was isolated from a Tunisian Saharan soil. Morphological and chemical studies indicated that strain TN256 belonged to the genus Streptomyces. Analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence of strain TN256 showed a similarity level ranging between 99.79 and 97.8% within Streptomyces microflavus DSM 40331(T) and Streptomyces griseorubiginosus DSM 40469(T) respectively. The comparison of its physiological characteristics showed significant differences with the nearest species. Combined analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene sequences (FN687758), fatty acids profile, and results of physiological and biochemical tests indicated that there were genotypic and phenotypic differentiations of that isolate from other Streptomyces species neighbours. These date strongly suggest that strain TN256 represents a novel species with the type strain Streptomyces TN256 (=CTM50228(T)). Experimental validation by DNA-DNA hybridization would be required for conclusive confirmation. Four active products (1-4) were isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces TN256 using various separation and purification steps and procedures. 1: N-[2-(1H-indol-3-yl)-2 oxo-ethyl] acetamide 'alkaloid' derivative; 2: di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, a phthalate derivative; 3: 1-Nonadecene and 4: Cyclo (L: -Pro-L: -Tyr) a diketopiperazine 'DKP' derivative. The chemical structure of these four active compounds was established on the basis of spectroscopic studies NMR and by comparing with data from the literature. According to our biological studies, we showed in this work that the pure compounds (1-4) possess antibacterial and antifungal activities.
