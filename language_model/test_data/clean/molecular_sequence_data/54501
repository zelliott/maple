Group C rotavirus (GpC RV) causes sporadic cases and outbreaks of acute diarrhoea in humans worldwide, but has not been detected among children in South Korea. The present study aimed to detect GpC RV among children hospitalized with gastroenteritis in South Korea and to perform a molecular characterization of GpC RV strains. From November 2003 to January 2006, 434 faecal samples were collected from children <10 years of age who were hospitalized for treatment of acute diarrhoea and screened for group C and A rotaviruses by enzyme immunoassay. GpC RV strains were characterized by sequence and phylogenetic analysis.Of the 434 samples screened, two were positive for GpC RV and one had a mixed GpC and GpA RV infection. One of the strains, Icheon, shared high sequence conservation in VP4, VP6 and VP7 genes with other published GpC RV. This is the first report describing the molecular characteristics of GpC RV among children in South Korea. Additional surveillance is needed to determine the burden of GpC RV gastroenteritis.
