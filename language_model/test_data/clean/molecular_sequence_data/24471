Numerous sequences analogous to resistance (R) genes exist in plant genomes and could be involved in resistance traits. The aim of this study was to identify a large number of Brassica napus sequences related to R genes and also to test the adequacy of specific PCR-based tools for studying them. Different consensus primers were compared for their efficiency in amplifying resistance-gene analogues (RGAs) related to the nucleotide-binding-site subgroup of R genes. Specific primers were subsequently designed to fine-study the different RGAs and we tested their efficiency in three species related to B. napus: Brassica oleracea, Brassica rapa, and Arabidopsis thaliana. Forty-four B. napus RGAs were identified. Among 29 examined, at least one-third were expressed. Eighteen RGAs were mapped on 10 of the 19 B. napus linkage groups. The high variability within these sequences permitted discrimination of each genotype within a B. napus collection. The RGA-specific primers amplified RGAs in the B. oleracea and B. rapa genomes, but the sequences appear to be poorly conserved in A. thaliana. Specific RGA primers are a precise tool for studying known-sequence RGAs. These sequences represent interesting markers that could be correlated with resistance traits in B. napus or related Brassica genomes.
