The taxonomy of canine Mollicutes is described, based on phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene and 16S/23S rRNA intergenic spacer (IGS) region sequences. The nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA gene of two untyped mycoplasmas and the IGS region of 11 Mycoplasma species were determined and used for phylogenetic analysis. The two untyped Mycoplasma strains, HRC 689 and VJC 358, were found to be distinct from all known canine mycoplasmas and all published mycoplasma 16S rRNA gene sequences.
