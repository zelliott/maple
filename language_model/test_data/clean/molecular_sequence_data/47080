A mouse Mix-like gene, Mml, related to the Xenopus Mix/Bix homeobox gene family and the chick CMIX gene has been identified. At E5.5, Mml is expressed symmetrically in the visceral endoderm but by E6.0 this expression is noticeably asymmetric. At E6.5, expression is restricted to the nascent primitive streak. Mml expression persists in the primitive streak through E7.5-E9.5, marking those cells fated to form extra-embryonic and lateral mesoderm.
