Annexins are multifunctional lipid-binding proteins. Plant annexins are expressed throughout the life cycle and are under environmental control. Their association or insertion into membranes may be governed by a range of local conditions (Ca(2+), pH, voltage or lipid identity) and nonclassical sorting motifs. Protein functions include exocytosis, actin binding, peroxidase activity, callose synthase regulation and ion transport. As such, annexins appear capable of linking Ca(2+), redox and lipid signalling to coordinate development with responses to the biotic and abiotic environment. Significant advances in plant annexin research have been made in the past 2 yr. Here, we review the basis of annexin multifunctionality and suggest how these proteins may operate in the life and death of a plant cell.
