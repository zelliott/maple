We present a systematic structure comparison of three major classes of postsynaptic snake toxins, which include short and long chain alpha-type neurotoxins plus one angusticeps-type toxin of black mamba snake family. Two novel alpha-type neurotoxins isolated from Taiwan cobra (Naja naja atra) possessing distinct primary sequences and different postsynaptic neurotoxicities were taken as exemplars for short and long chain neurotoxins and compared with the major lethal short-chain neurotoxin in the same venom, i.e., cobrotoxin, based on the derived three-dimensional structure of this toxin in solution by NMR spectroscopy. A structure comparison among these two alpha-neurotoxins and angusticeps-type toxin (denoted as FS2) was carried out by the secondary-structure prediction together with computer homology-modeling based on multiple sequence alignment of their primary sequences and established NMR structures of cobrotoxin and FS2. It is of interest to find that upon pairwise superpositions of these modeled three-dimensional polypeptide chains, distinct differences in the overall peptide flexibility and interior microenvironment between these toxins can be detected along the three constituting polypeptide loops, which may reflect some intrinsic differences in the surface hydrophobicity of several hydrophobic peptide segments present on the surface loops of these toxin molecules as revealed by hydropathy profiles. Construction of a phylogenetic tree for these structurally related and functionally distinct toxins corroborates that all long and short toxins present in diverse snake families are evolutionarily related to each other, supposedly derived from an ancestral polypeptide by gene duplication and subsequent mutational substitutions leading to divergence of multiple three-loop toxin peptides.
