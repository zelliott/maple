We have isolated a cDNA encoding a member of the Tlx/Hox11 family of homeodomain factors from the zebrafish, most closely related to the vertebrate Tlx-1/Hox11 and Tlx-3/Hox11L2 proteins. The gene is expressed in a set of early differentiating neurons that project to a common tract, the lateral longitudinal fascicle. We show that the gene is specifically expressed in spinal cord Rohon Beard neurons, in nucleus of the posterior commissure neurons of the midbrain, in a set of hindbrain neurons that include RoL3 reticulospinal interneurons, and in the trigeminal, statoacoustic, anterior lateral line, glossopharyngeal, and vagal cranial sensory ganglia. Timing of expression of the gene in these neurons correlates with the phase of axonal outgrowth and target innervation. Expression of the gene is also observed in several non-neural tissues, including the pharyngeal arches, budding gill filaments, outgrowing semicircular protrusions in the otic vesicle, and in the pectoral fin buds.
