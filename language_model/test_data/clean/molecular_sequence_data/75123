An oxygen-induced superoxide dismutase was purified from the halophilic bacterium, Halobacterium halobium, strain NRL. Due to the high salt requirement for enzyme stability, the purification had to be performed in the presence of 2 M NaCl. The pI of the protein was 4.95. The approximate Mr was 38,500. The subunit size as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-electrophoresis was approximately 19,000. Metal analysis showed 1.5 atoms of manganese per dimer, 0.5 atom zinc, and 1.54 atoms copper. The N-terminal sequence of amino acids was determined, and based upon the first 26 amino acids significant homology to other manganese- and iron-containing superoxide dismutases was revealed.
