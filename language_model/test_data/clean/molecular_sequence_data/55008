We report the complete genome sequence of two Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages MP29 and MP42. Their genomes are similar to those of P. aeruginosa temperate phages DMS3 and MP22, whose lysogens are impaired in swarming motilities, involving the host CRISPR loci. Both MP29 and MP42 lysogens, however, were proficient in swarming, suggesting the absence of the phage-host CRISPR interaction.
