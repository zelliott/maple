Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the eighth and most recently identified human herpesvirus (HHV-8). KSHV was discovered in 1994 by Chang et al. who used representational difference analysis to search for DNA sequences present in AIDS-associated KS but not in adjacent normal skin [1]. The virus has since been shown to be specifically associated with all forms of this disease and has fulfilled all of Hill's criteria for causation (reviewed in ). KSHV is also found in all cases of primary effusion lymphoma and in a plasmablastic variant of multicentric Castleman's disease. Over the last few years a wealth of data has been gained on the role of KSHV genes during infection. This review is an attempt to assemble this information into a more complete picture of how KSHV may cause disease.
