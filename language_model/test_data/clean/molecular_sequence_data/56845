The region between the zebrafish homeobox genes hox-B5 and hox-B6 was sequenced, and searched for consensus binding sites of retinoic acid receptors and other transcription factors. A continuous sequence of 7.2 kb covering the zebrafish hox-B5/B6 genes was then compared to the corresponding region of the mouse Hox-B complex. Except for the open reading frames, the only highly conserved regions that could be found were stretches extending 0.3 kb upstream from the initiation codons. Within the conserved upstream regions of hox-B5/B6, we identified a common 10 bp sequence, which is also present close to the initiation codons of several other Hox genes and which therefore may be implicated in the control of their expression.
