Smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (MLC kinase) was phosphorylated by smooth muscle calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM protein kinase II). When MLC kinase was free from calmodulin, two sites were phosphorylated. The phosphorylation at the one site was much faster than the other site; however, the phosphorylation at the first site was completely blocked by calmodulin binding to MLC kinase. Phosphorylation of MLC kinase by CaM protein kinase II increased the dissociation constant of MLC kinase for calmodulin about 10 times without changing the Vmax. The location of the phosphorylation sites was identified by isolating and sequencing the tryptic phosphopeptides of MLC kinase. The preferred site was identified as serine 512 and the second site as serine 525. These sites are the same as the sites phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase.
