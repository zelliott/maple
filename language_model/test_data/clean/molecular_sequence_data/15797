alpha 2-Antiplasmin Enschede is a variant of alpha 2-antiplasmin which has lost its ability to inhibit plasmin irreversibly and which is associated with a haemorrhagic disorder [Kluft et al. (1987) J. Clin. Invest. 80, 1391-1400]. The abnormal protein was purified from the plasma of a homozygous patient and subjected to one-dimensional peptide mapping using papain for digestion. A slightly abnormally migrating polypeptide (Mr 17,000) was found which represented the C-terminal part of the molecule (the N-terminus of the polypeptide corresponded to Gly-338 in normal alpha 2-antiplasmin) and which contained the reactive centre. The interaction of plasmin with alpha 2-antiplasmin Enschede was studied by adding plasmin to plasma of the homozygous patient. SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting showed that no complex persisted, but that the abnormal alpha 2-antiplasmin was cleaved into two fragments of Mr 56,000 and 14,000 respectively. The latter fragment co-migrated with the post-complex peptide, which is cleaved from normal alpha 2-antiplasmin during complex-formation with plasmin. In a purified system, catalytic amounts of plasmin rapidly cleaved alpha 2-antiplasmin Enschede into the aforementioned fragments. In kinetic studies alpha 2-antiplasmin Enschede reversibly and temporarily inhibited the plasmin-catalysed hydrolysis of D-valyl-L-leucyl-L-lysine p-nitroanilide ('S-2251') as a competitive inhibitor (Ki,app. 35 nM). It was concluded that alpha 2-antiplasmin Enschede apparently forms a normal complex with plasmin. The complex is, however, not stable, but disintegrates rapidly to a cleaved form of alpha 2-antiplasmin Enschede and active plasmin. The abnormal protein thus behaves like a substrate, instead of an inhibitor, of plasmin.
