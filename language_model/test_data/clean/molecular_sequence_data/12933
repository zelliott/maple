Biologically active bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) was produced in Escherichia coli using an OmpA leader-peptide fusion-protein system, and BPTI homologues were generated by cassette mutagenesis. Amino acids in the reactive loop of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-PI) were incorporated into the reactive loop of BPTI in a stepwise approach such that the contribution of individual amino acids could be assessed. The introduction of mutations into BPTI diminished the yield of heterologous protein relative to wild-type BPTI. However, for three BPTI homologues sufficient material was isolated to allow characterization of the proteins by electrospray MS and N-terminal peptide sequencing.
