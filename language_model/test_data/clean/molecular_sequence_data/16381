Chromosomal translocations involving immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) switch regions and an oncogene such as Myc represent initiating events in the development of many B cell malignancies. These translocations are widely thought to result from aberrant class-switch recombination. To test this model, we measured translocations in mice deficient in activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) that lack class-switch recombination. We found that AID made no measurable contribution to the generation of initial translocations, indicating that the intrinsic fragility of the switch regions or a pathway unrelated to AID is responsible for these translocations. In contrast, the outgrowth of translocation-positive cells was dependent on AID, raising the possibility that AID is important in tumor progression, perhaps by virtue of its mutagenic properties.
