Variants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were selected for resistance to the neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb) NM-01. MAb NM-01 recognizes the center of the third hypervariable domain (V3 loop) of the envelope gp120, and neutralizes diverse HIV-1 strains. In the continuous presence of MAb NM-01, transmission and propagation of molecularly cloned HIV-1 were performed in vitro to isolate escape variants. The polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequence analyses of these variants indicated that the antigenic change against MAb NM-01 is due to a single base substitution resulting in one amino acid interchange within the recognition site of MAb NM-01 in the V3 loop. Mutational analyses also demonstrated a nonrandom event of variability and the existence of mutational hot spots in the V3 loop. The bias of variability could be interpreted by the specificity of error-prone replication by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Furthermore, the results suggest that distribution of mutability might correlate closely with the stability of the secondary structure of RNA encoding the V3 loop region.
