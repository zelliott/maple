HIV-1 subtype G was identified by the authors in the former Soviet Union, and is related to a sequence VI525 from Gabon.  All told, subtype G isolates have been identified in the former Soviet Union, Gabon, Zaire, and Nigeria.  A subtype G gag sequence has also been reported in Taiwan.  This paper reports the first HIV-1 subtype G to be isolated from Uganda.  Uganda has the highest reported incidence of HIV-1 infection in Africa, with HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, and D having already been isolated in the country.  The authors isolated and sequenced HIV-1 genetic subtype G from a Ugandan female patient with CDC stage IV disease and a CD4 count of 20/cu. mm.  Although recently immigrated to the UK from Uganda, there is epidemiologic evidence that the patient was infected with HIV-1 in Uganda.  The V3 region of the isolate had 35 amino acids, with the common African tetrapeptide GPGQ at the tip of the loop.  There were deletions relative to other G subtype sequences in the V4 and V5 env regions.  The phylogenetic relationship of UGJW3 with other HIV-1 strains was inferred using nucleotide sequences and the PHYLIP package.  The C2-V5 env region of the isolate was found to cluster with the subtype G isolates from the former Soviet Union and the Gabon.  These findings confirm the need for further examination of the distribution of HIV-1 genetic subtypes and the exploration of their biologic significance.
