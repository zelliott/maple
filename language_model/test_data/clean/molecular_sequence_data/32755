A novel genic male sterile (GMS) line in Brassica napus L., which was identified in 1999, was found to be controlled by a monogenic dominant gene, which we have designated as MDGMS. The microspores of the MDGMS abort before the degradation of the tapetal cell layer. The F1 fertility from any fertile lines crossed with MDGMS segregated and the ratio was close to 1:1. Bulked segregation analysis (BSA) was employed to identify random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers linked to the Ms gene in MDGMS. Among 880 random 10-mer oligonucleotide primers screened against the bulk DNA of sterile and fertile, one primer S243 (5'-CTATGCCGAC-3') gave a repeatable 1500-bp DNA polymorphic segment S243(1500) between the two bulks. Analysis of individual plants of each bulks and other types of GMS and cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) lines suggest that the RAPD marker S243(1500) is closely linked to the MDGMS locus in rapeseed. This RAPD marker has been converted into sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker to aid identification of male-fertility genotypes in segregating progenies of MDGMS in marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding programs.
