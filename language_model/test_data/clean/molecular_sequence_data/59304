The solution structure of the peptide antigen from the receptor binding domain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain P1 has been determined using two-dimensional 1H NMR techniques. Ensembles of solution conformations for the trans form of this 23-residue disulfide bridged peptide have been generated using a simulated annealing procedure in conjunction with distance and torsion angle restraints derived from NMR data. Comparison of the NMR-derived solution structures of the P1 peptide with those previously determined for the 17-residue PAK, PAO and KB7 strain peptides [McInnes, C., et al. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 13432-13440; Campbell, A.P., et al. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 16255-16268] reveals the common structural motif of a beta-turn, which may be the necessary structural requirement for recognition of a common cell surface receptor and a common cross-reactive antibody to which all four strains bind. The importance of this conserved beta-turn in the PAK, PAO, KB7 and P1 peptides is discussed with regard to the design of a synthetic peptide vaccine effective against multiple strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections.
