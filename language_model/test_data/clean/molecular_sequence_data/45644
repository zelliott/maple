Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyzes the formation of deoxyribonucleotides, a rate limiting step in DNA synthesis. Class I RNR is a tetramer that consists of two subunits, R1 and R2; enzymatic activity requires association of R1 with R2. The R2 subunit is of special interest because it dictates the interaction with R1 that is required for enzymatic activity expression, and it is expressed only during the S phase of the cell cycle. We previously sequenced an R2 cDNA clone from the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. We found the message was upregulated by blood feeding. We now report the sequence of an R2 genomic clone. The gene consists of 4 introns and 5 exons. Both major and minor transcriptional start sites have been identified, and their use differs in sugar-fed versus blood-fed females. The gene contains putative cis-regulatory sites for E2F, Caudal (Cdx) and Dearolf (Dfd). The mosquito R2 gene contains iron-specific regulatory elements immediately upstream of the minimal promoter region. Binding of a factor to the distal putative Cdx site in the -400 region is altered by iron treatment of cells. Further, following blood feeding, R2 message is significantly induced in mosquito ovaries (tissues that are involved in oogenesis--a process requiring DNA synthesis).
