An extensive series of oligodeoxyribonucleotides was reacted with reductively activated mitomycin C (MC), and the resulting cross-linked drug-oligonucleotide complexes were isolated by reverse-phase HPLC and characterized by nucleoside and MC-nucleoside adduct analysis. HPLC also served for assay of the yield of cross-linked oligonucleotides. AT-rich duplex oligonucleotides, containing a single central CG.CG, gave high yields of cross-links between the two guanines while those having GC.GC, instead, gave none. In another series, the central sequences CGC.GCG and CGC.ICG both yielded 50% cross-link while CGC.GCI was completely resistant. Cross-linking was conducted also in two steps: Oligonucleotides substituted monofunctionally by MC at guanine at either a CG or GC sequence were annealed with their complementary strands followed by reductive reactivation of the bound MC to form a cross-link. The CG oligomers were cross-linked quantitatively while the GC ones were again resistant. These results show unambiguously that the MC cross-link is absolutely specific to the CG.CG duplex sequence, confirming our previous finding [Chawla, A.K., Lipman, R., & Tomasz, M. (1987) in Structure and Expression, Volume 2: DNA and Its Drug Complexes (Sarma, R.H., & Sarma, M.H., Eds.) Adenine Press, Guilderland, NY]. Evidence is presented that this specificity is due to the specific orientation of the monofunctionally attached MC in the minor groove. Superimposed on the CG.CG requirement, a four-base-pair sequence preference was observed at PuCGPyr.PuCGPyr sequences. This suggests that the guanine N2 atom of GpPyr is more reactive toward the drug than that of GpPu, due to the favorable effect of the negative dipole of the O2 of the Pyr on the reaction; in accordance, GpT was more reactive than GpC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
