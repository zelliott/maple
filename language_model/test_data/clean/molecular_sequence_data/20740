We report here a novel human leukocyte antigen-DRB1 allele, DRB1*112802, which was identified from a Chinese individual during sequence-based typing. The new allele is identical to DRB1*112801 except for one nucleotide change at nucleotide 189 (A --> G ), codon 34 Q (CAA) --> Q (CAG), no coding change.
