4-1BB, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, is induced on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells upon engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR)/ CD3 complex with the antigen bound to MHC. 4-1BB plays an important role in transmitting costimulatory signal during T cell activation. However, 4-1BB-mediatded signal transduction pathways have remained elusive. We conducted the yeast two-hybrid screening to identify intracellular signaling molecules that associate with 4-1BB. A novel leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing protein, herein named LRR-1, was found to specifically interact with the cytoplasmic domain of 4-1BB. Overexpression of LRR-1 suppressed the activation of NF-KB induced by 4-1BB or TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2. In addition, LRR-1 down-regulated JNK1 activity was induced by 4-1BB. These results indicate that LRR-1 negatively regulates the 4-1BB-mediated signaling cascades which result in the activation of NF-kappaB and JNK1.
