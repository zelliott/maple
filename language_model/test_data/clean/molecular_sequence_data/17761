The hydration of water bridged base pairs of nucleic acids have been simulated via the Monte Carlo method. The simulation have shown that water molecules forming H-bonds with both bases preserve this H-bonding with large probability in the water surrounding. This fact supports the supposition about the important role of water molecules in wrong base pair formation and about the role of these base pairs in the structure and functioning of nucleic acids.
