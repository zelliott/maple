The presence of the foetal protein fetuin has previously been demonstrated by immunocytochemistry to be specifically confined to the primordial plexiform layer, the early cortical plate and subplate zone cells in the developing neocortex of a number of species. In order to investigate its origin there, we have applied in situ hybridization in paraffin sections of Bouin's fixed foetal sheep brain, using a short anti-sense oligonucleotide probe. The distribution of fetuin mRNA has been compared with that of the protein by using anti-fetuin antibodies and immunocytochemistry. This allowed us to confirm that fetuin is synthesised initially in cells of the primordial plexiform layer and subsequently cortical plate and subplate cells. On the other hand, cells in the ventricular zone that are fetuin (protein) positive do not contain detectable fetuin mRNA. The time course of fetuin mRNA expression in the developing neocortex follows closely the previously described pattern of fetuin (protein) distribution in the sheep brain, apart from its absence from the ventricular zone where its origin is probably by uptake from cerebrospinal fluid.
