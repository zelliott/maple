A soluble form of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase was purified to apparent homogeneity from the culture media of Sf9 cells which had been infected with recombinant baculoviruses encoding human tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). To facilitate purification, an oligonucleotide consisting of 6 tandem codons for histidine and a stop codon was engineered into the TNSALP cDNA. The molecular mass of the enzyme purified through a nickel-chelate column was estimated to be 54 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. That of the native enzyme was 90 kDa as estimated by gel filtration, indicating that the purified soluble TNSALP is dimeric. The enzyme was used for production of antibodies specific for human TNSALP. Immunoblotting analysis showed a single 80-kDa band in the cell homogenate prepared from Saos-2 (human osteosarcoma) cells. However, upon digestion with peptide: N-glycosidase F, the 80-kDa TNSALP of human origin and the soluble enzyme of insect origin migrated to the same position on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, indicating that the size difference between the two enzymes is ascribed to N-linked oligosaccharides. The antibodies prepared against the purified TNSALP were found to be useful also for immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies.
