To compare the gene expression profile in a pair of HBV-infected twins.

The gene expression profile was compared in a pair of HBV-infected twins.

The twins displayed different disease outcomes. One acquired natural immunity against HBV, whereas the other became a chronic HBV carrier. Eighty-eight and forty-six genes were found to be up- or down-regulated in their PBMCs, respectively. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 1 (TNF-alphaIP1) that expressed at a higher level in the HBV-immune twins was identified and four pairs of siblings with HBV immunity by RT-PCR. However, upon HBV core antigen stimulation, TNF-alphaIP1 was downregulated in PBMCs from subjects with immunity, whereas it was slightly upregulated in HBV carriers. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a K+ channel tetramerization domain in TNF-alphaIP1 that shares a significant homology with some human, mouse, and C elegan proteins.

TNF-alphaIP1 may play a role in the innate immunity against HBV.
