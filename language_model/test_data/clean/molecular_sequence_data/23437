Gene ytkD of Bacillus subtilis, a member of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily, has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified protein has been characterized as a nucleoside triphosphatase active on all of the canonical ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. Whereas all other nucleoside triphosphatase members of the superfamily release inorganic pyrophosphate and the cognate nucleoside monophosphate, YtkD hydrolyses nucleoside triphosphates in a stepwise fashion through the diphosphate to the monophosphate, releasing two molecules of inorganic orthophosphate. Contrary to a previous report, our enzymological and genetic studies indicate that ytkD is not an orthologue of E. coli mutT.
