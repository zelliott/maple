The myelin basic protein (MBP) gene is a candidate locus for disease susceptibility in familial multiple sclerosis. Amplification of a polymorphic tetranucleotide repeat region immediately 5' to MBP exon 1 demonstrated the presence of eight different alleles among members of 14 multiplex multiple sclerosis families (36 affected individuals). Linkage analysis was performed with autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive models, normal individuals with abnormal magnetic resonance scans being scored as either unknown or affected. Cumulative LOD scores were negative for both models of inheritance. The results do not demonstrate linkage between the MBP gene region and multiple sclerosis.
