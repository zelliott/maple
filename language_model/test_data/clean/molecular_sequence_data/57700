The sequence-specific DNA-binding protein factor F6, which binds upstream of the cluster of the chicken alpha-globin genes, has previously been found to interact with a DNA fragment containing a replication origin and a nuclear matrix binding site. This protein has been partially characterized. Based on its molecular weight and binding affinity, F6 belongs to a family of GATA proteins, the chicken equivalent of transcription factor NFE-1. An oligonucleotide including the binding site for F6 competes for binding of the above-mentioned DNA fragment to the nuclear matrix. This indicates an involvement of this protein in the interaction between DNA and the nuclear matrix.
