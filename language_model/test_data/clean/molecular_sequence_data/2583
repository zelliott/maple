The complete nucleotide sequence of RNA alpha from the Type strain of barley stripe mosaic virus has been determined. The RNA is 3768 nucleotides long and contains a single open reading frame which codes for a polypeptide of 1139 amino acids (mw 129,634). The open reading frame is flanked by a 5'-terminal sequence of 91 nucleotides and a 3'-nontranslated region composed of a short poly(A) tract followed by a 238-nucleotide tRNA-like structure. The amino acid sequence of the polypeptide (alpha a) encoded by the open reading frame has homology with the TMV 126K protein and with related polypeptides from other viruses. The carboxy-terminal portion of the alpha a polypeptide also has limited homology with the 58K (beta b) protein encoded by BSMV RNA beta and includes a consensus sequence found in mononucleotide-binding polypeptides.
