Cellular prion proteins, PrP(C), carrying the amino acid substitutions P102L, P105L, or A117V, which confer increased susceptibility to human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, are known to form structures that include transmembrane polypeptide segments. Herein, we investigated the interactions between dodecylphosphocholine micelles and the polypeptide fragments 90-231 of the recombinant mouse PrP variants carrying the amino acid replacements P102L, P105L, A117V, A113V/A115V/A118V, K110I/H111I, M129V, P105L/M129V, and A117V/M129V. Wild-type mPrP-(90-231) and mPrP[M129V]-(91-231) showed only weak interactions with dodecylphosphocholine micelles in aqueous solution at pH 7.0, whereas discrete interaction sites within the polypeptide segment 102-127 were identified for all other aforementioned mPrP variants by NMR chemical shift mapping. These model studies thus provide evidence that amino acid substitutions within the polypeptide segment 102-127 affect the interactions of PrP(C) with membranous structures, which might in turn modulate the physiological function of the protein in health and disease.
