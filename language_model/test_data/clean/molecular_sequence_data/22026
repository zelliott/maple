A Gram-negative, rod-shaped, non-motile, non-spore forming bacterium (SV96T) was isolated from wetland soil near Ny-Alesund, Svalbard. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strain SV96T was shown to belong to the Gammaproteobacteria, related to Methylobacter psychrophilus Z-0021T (99.1 %), Methylobacter luteus ATCC 49878T (97.3 %), Methylobacter marinus A45T (97.0 %) and Methylobacter whittenburyi ATCC 51738T (95.8 %); the closest related species within the genus Methylomicrobium with a validly published name was Methylomicrobium album ATCC 33003T (95.0 %). Chemotaxonomic data (including the major fatty acids: 16 : 1omega8, 16 : 1omega7 and 16 : 1omega5t) supported the affiliation of strain SV96T to the genus Methylobacter. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization, physiological and biochemical tests allowed genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strain SV96T from the four Methylobacter species mentioned above. Strain SV96T therefore represents a novel species, for which the name Methylobacter tundripaludum sp. nov. is proposed (type strain SV96T = DSM 17260T = ATCC BAA-1195T).
