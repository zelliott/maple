Efficient and cost-effective DNA sequencing technologies have been, and may continue to be, critical to the progress of molecular biology. This overview of DNA sequencing strategies provides a high-level review of six distinct approaches to DNA sequencing: (a) dideoxy sequencing; (b) cyclic array sequencing; (c) sequencing-by-hybridization; (d) microelectrophoresis; (e) mass spectrometry; and (f) nanopore sequencing. The primary focus is on dideoxy sequencing, which has been the dominant technology since 1977, and on cyclic array strategies, for which several competitive implementations have been developed since 2005. Because the field of DNA sequencing is changing rapidly, this unit represents a snapshot of this particular moment.
