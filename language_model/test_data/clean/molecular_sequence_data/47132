From a human placenta cDNA library, we isolated a novel gene whose predicted product is highly homologous in amino acid sequence to human gadd45 and murine MyD118 proteins (about 55% and 52% identity, respectively). The cDNA clone, designated GRP17 (gadd-related protein, 17 kDa), contained a 477-bp open reading frame encoding 159 amino acids. Northern blot analysis revealed strong expression of a 1.35-kb transcript in heart, placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, prostate, testis, and ovary. A 1.7-kb additional transcript was detected in liver. We assigned the GRP17 gene to chromosome 9q22.1-q22.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
