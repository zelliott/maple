A feasible and fully described strategy, with a detailed list of primers, for amplifying, cloning and sequencing known and potentially novel cry1A genes harboured by a Bacillus thuringiensis strain was successfully established. Based on the analysis of conserved regions of the cry1A genes, the 1AF and 1UR oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify the whole open reading frame of these genes. The PCR products obtained revealed the successful amplification of cry1A genes from 13 B. thuringiensis strains. These bacteria were previously known to harbour at least one cry1A gene. An Argentinean B. thuringiensis isolate INTA Mo1-12 was randomly chosen for cloning and sequencing of cry1A genes by using a primer set developed in this study. Both nucleotide and amino acid sequences similarity analysis revealed that cry1Aa and cry1Ac from B. thuringiensis INTA Mo1-12 are new natural variants, showing several differences with the other known cry1A subclasses. These genes were named by the B. thuringiensis Pesticidal Crystal Protein Nomenclature Committee as cry1Aa15 and cry1Ac21 respectively.
