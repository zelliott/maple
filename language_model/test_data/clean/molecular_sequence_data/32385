During over a decade of study on aspartic protease inhibitors and water-soluble prodrugs, in 2003, we discovered that the presence of an O-acyl instead of N-acyl residue within the peptide backbone significantly changed the secondary structure of the native peptide. In addition, the target peptide was subsequently generated by an O-N intramolecular acyl migration reaction. These findings led to the development of a novel method, called "O-acyl isopeptide method," for the synthesis of peptides containing difficult sequence. Further application of the method to Alzheimer's Abeta1-42 revealed that the O-acyl isopeptide of Abeta1-42 could be effectively synthesized and stored without spontaneous self-assembly. Intact monomer Abeta1-42 could then be obtained from the isopeptide under physiological experimental conditions. We named the O-acyl isopeptide as "Click Peptide," because of its "quick and easy one-way conversion" to the parent Abeta1- 42. Application of the click peptide has provided a new basis for the investigation of the biological functions of Abeta1-42 by inducible activation of its self-assembly. The O-acyl isopeptide method has further evolved as a general method for peptides synthesis with our recent developments of "O-acyl isodipeptide units" and "racemization-free segment condensation methodology." Isodipeptide units have enabled routine use of the O-acyl isopeptide method by avoiding the often difficult esterification reaction on resin. "Racemizationfree segment condensation methodology" has been achieved by employing N-segments possessing a C-terminal urethaneprotected O-acyl Ser/Thr residues. The synthesis of long peptides/proteins by racemization-free segment condensation has thus become possible at Ser/Thr residues instead of Cterminal Gly/Pro residues. As the O-acyl isopeptide method becomes more widely utilized, we have composed this review to facilitate its application for the production of peptides and proteins.
