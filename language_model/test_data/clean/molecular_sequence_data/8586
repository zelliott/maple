It has been previously reported that 8701-BC cells, derived from a primary carcinoma of the breast, constitutively express parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) gene and that N-terminal PTHrP immunoreactivity can be found in cell medium. Here we have firstly measured immunoreactive PTHrP in 8701-BC cell medium using antibodies raised against midregion and C-terminal fragments, and also demonstrated the expression of PTH/PTHrP receptor by 8701-BC cells. Secondly, we have examined the role, if any, elicited by diverse PTHrP domains on 8701-BC cell proliferation, and invasive behaviour in vitro related to production of extracellular proteolytic enzymes. Our data show that PTHrP [1-34], and, to a minor extent, [67-86] and [107-139], are anti-mitogenic but 'invadogenic' for 8701-BC cells, and suggest that diverse enzymatic activities may contribute to cell invasion in response to different PTHrP fragments. In light of the present data on a chemoattractive role for PTHrP in vitro, we hypothesize that this protein might intervene in local control of the invasive process in breast carcinoma.
