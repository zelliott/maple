In this study we analyzed expression patterns of two delta-protocadherins, protocadherin-9 and protocadherin-17, in the developing zebrafish using in situ hybridization and RT-PCR methods. Both protocadherins were mainly detected in the embryonic central nervous system, but each showed a distinct expression pattern. Protocadherin-9 message (Pcdh9) was expressed after 10h post fertilization (hpf). It was found mainly in small clusters of cells in the anteroventral forebrain and ventrolateral hindbrain, and scattered cells throughout the spinal cord of young embryos (24 hpf). Pcdh9 expression in the hindbrain was segmental, reflecting a neuromeric organization, which became more evident at 34 hpf. As development proceeded, Pcdh9 expression increased throughout the brain, while its expression in the spinal cord was greatly reduced. Pcdh9 was also found in the developing retina and statoacoustic ganglion. Protocadherin-17 message (Pcdh17) expression began much earlier (1.5-2 hpf) than Pcdh9. Similar to Pcdh9 expression, Pcdh17 expression was found mainly in the anteroventral forebrain at 24 hpf, but its expression in the hindbrain and spinal cord, confined mainly to lateroventral regions of the hindbrain and anterior spinal cord, was more restricted than Pcdh9. As development proceeded, Pcdh17 expression was increased both in the brain and spinal cord: detected throughout the brain of two- and three-day old embryos, strongly expressed in the retina and in lateral regions of spinal cord in two-day old embryos. Its expression in the retina and spinal cord was reduced in three-day old embryos. Our results showed that expression of these two protocadherins was both spatially and temporally regulated.
