Cells of the dipteran insect Chironomus contain a high mobility group protein that is homologous to the mammalian high mobility group proteins I/Y (HMGI/Y). These proteins facilitate the assembly of higher order nucleoprotein complexes. In proliferating cells, >30% of Chironomus HMGI was found to be phosphorylated. The phosphorylation sites were mapped to Ser3, Ser22, and Ser72 and were found to be substrates for the kinases Cdc2 (and mitogen-activated protein (MAP)), MAP, and Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, respectively. In mitotically arrested cells, the extent of phosphorylation at Ser3 increased, whereas phosphorylation at Ser22 remained unchanged. In nondividing cells, phosphorylation at Ser3 and Ser22 was strongly reduced. The DNA binding affinity of Chironomus HMGI was not influenced by single phosphorylation at Ser3 or Ser22. In contrast, phosphorylation at both of these sites resulted in a 10-fold weakening of the binding activity and altered the mode of protein-DNA interaction. Since both human and murine HMGI/Y proteins, similarly to the insect HMGI protein, possess phosphorylation sites for Cdc2 and MAP kinases that intersperse the AT-hook DNA-binding motifs, our results may reflect a general mechanism that regulates the properties and function of this class of putative transcriptional regulators.
