The prolyl peptidase that removes the tetra-peptide of pro-transglutaminase was purified from Streptomyces mobaraensis mycelia. The substrate specificity of the enzyme using synthetic peptide substrates showed proline-specific activity with not only tripeptidyl peptidase activity, but also tetrapeptidyl peptidase activity. However, the enzyme had no other exo- and endo-activities. This substrate specificity is different from proline specific peptidases so far reported. The enzyme gene was cloned, based on the direct N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme, and the entire nucleotide sequence of the coding region was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed an N-terminal signal peptide sequence (33 amino acids) followed by the mature protein comprising 444 amino acid residues. This enzyme shows no remarkable homology with enzymes belonging to the prolyl oligopeptidase family, but has about 65% identity with three tripeptidyl peptidases from Streptomyces lividans, Streptomyces coelicolor, and Streptomyces avermitilis. Based on its substrate specificity, a new name, "prolyl tri/tetra-peptidyl aminopeptidase," is proposed for the enzyme.
