The two diastereotopic protons at C4 of NAD(P)H are seen separately in 1H-NMR spectra. This fact was used to determine the stereospecificity at C4 of NAD(P) for the NADP-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase from Methanogenium organophilum and for the NAD-dependent (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase from Acidaminococcus fermentans. The reduction of NADP+ with [2H6]ethanol was found to yield (4R)-[4-2H1]NADPH and the oxidation of (4R)-[4-2H1]NADH with 2-oxoglutarate to yield unlabelled [4-1H]NAD+. These results indicate that both enzymes are Re-face stereospecific at C4 of the pyridine nucleotides.
