A 96-kDa protein predicted by the DNA sequence of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PRP5 gene contains a domain that bears a striking resemblance to a family of RNA helicases characterized by the conserved amino acid sequence Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (D-E-A-D). Previous work indicated that the product of the PRP5 gene is required for splicing and that spliceosome assembly does not occur in its absence. However, its precise role in splicing and the nature of its biochemical activity remained unknown. To examine the role of PRP5 in splicing, we cloned the gene by complementation of a temperature-sensitive mutation and determined its DNA sequence. We discuss here the possible roles for an RNA helicase in splicing and for the activity of the PRP5 protein.
