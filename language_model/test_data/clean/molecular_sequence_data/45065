Nearly two dozen microbial pathogens have surface polysaccharides or lipo-oligosaccharides that contain sialic acid (Sia), and several Sia-dependent virulence mechanisms are known to enhance bacterial survival or result in host tissue injury. Some pathogens are also known to O-acetylate their Sias, although the role of this modification in pathogenesis remains unclear. We report that neuD, a gene located within the Group B Streptococcus (GBS) Sia biosynthetic gene cluster, encodes a Sia O-acetyltransferase that is itself required for capsular polysaccharide (CPS) sialylation. Homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis identified Lys-123 as a critical residue for Sia O-acetyltransferase activity. Moreover, a single nucleotide polymorphism in neuD can determine whether GBS displays a "high" or "low" Sia O-acetylation phenotype. Complementation analysis revealed that Escherichia coli K1 NeuD also functions as a Sia O-acetyltransferase in GBS. In fact, NeuD homologs are commonly found within Sia biosynthetic gene clusters. A bioinformatic approach identified 18 bacterial species with a Sia biosynthetic gene cluster that included neuD. Included in this list are the sialylated human pathogens Legionella pneumophila, Vibrio parahemeolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Campylobacter jejuni, as well as an additional 12 bacterial species never before analyzed for Sia expression. Phylogenetic analysis shows that NeuD homologs of sialylated pathogens share a common evolutionary lineage distinct from the poly-Sia O-acetyltransferase of E. coli K1. These studies define a molecular genetic approach for the selective elimination of GBS Sia O-acetylation without concurrent loss of sialylation, a key to further studies addressing the role(s) of this modification in bacterial virulence.
