To detect less prevalent viruses, such as wild-type polioviruses in sewage from a highly immunized community, a method was developed to efficiently recover viruses and remove PCR inhibitors. The method consisted of initial separation of solids from liquid, followed by solvent extractions, polyethylene glycol precipitations, Sephadex G-200 chromatography, and guanidinium isothiocyanate (GIT) extraction. To elute viruses from the separated solids, 0.5 M threonine (pH 7.5) was as efficient as 3% beef extract but conferred no PCR inhibition. In samples that were concentrated approximately 1,000-fold, 21% of the initially seeded viruses were recovered. When poliovirus type 3 (PV3) Sabin strain at low levels and PV1 LSc strain at high levels were seeded in raw sewage, PV3 was specifically detected in the final sample concentrates at sensitivities of 14 PFU by direct PCR and 0.7 PFU by GIT extraction-PCR. While applying the method to international airplane sewage, which contains high levels of solids as well as commercial sanitizers, 44% (7 of 16) of the samples were found to harbor enteroviruses by both cell culture infectivity and pan-enterovirus PCR analyses. Nucleotide sequencing of the PCR products revealed that multiple enterovirus genotypes were amplified from each final sewage concentrate, whereas the fewer virus genotypes detected by cell culture infectivity were probably the better growing strains. By this method, we demonstrated that air travel may contribute to the intercontinental dissemination of enteric pathogens.
