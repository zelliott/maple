The regulatory mechanisms of microcirculation might differ in the liver from other organs, because macrophages are resident in the hepatic sinusoids and sinusoidal endothelial cells are unique in shape and function. Thrombomodulin expression in endothelial cells and tissue factor activity in isolated macrophages were studied in the liver and lung of rats. In normal rats, the thrombomodulin expression was minimal in hepatic sinusoids, but prominent in pulmonary capillaries, while the tissue factor activity in the presence of endotoxin was higher in pulmonary macrophages than in Kupffer cells, although the levels in the absence of endotoxin were comparable in both cells. The tissue factor activity in hepatic macrophages was increased after priming of the cells with Corynebacterium parvum or after induction of liver necrosis or cirrhosis with carbon tetrachloride. In the necrotic or cirrhotic liver, increased thrombomodulin expression was seen along capillaries extending in necrotic areas and regenerating nodules, but this increase was minimal in the Corynebacterium parvum-treated rat liver. Blood coagulation equilibrium in microcirculation regulated by endothelial cells and macrophages may differ between the liver and lung. Such equilibrium in the liver may vary depending on pathological status.
