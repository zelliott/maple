An erythroid cell-specific nuclear factor that binds tightly to a sequence motif (5'-GATAAGGA-3') shared by many erythroid cell-specific promoters was purified to homogeneity by DNA sequence affinity chromatography. Visualization of the purified factor, which we term EF-1, showed a simple pattern comprising a polypeptide doublet with Mrs of 18,000 and 19,000. We confirmed that these species account for EF-1-binding activity by eluting the polypeptides from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and renaturing the appropriate binding activity. Using the purified polypeptides, we mapped seven factor-binding sites that are dispersed across the murine alpha- and beta-globin genes. The murine alpha-globin gene is flanked by at least two EF-1-binding sites. One site is centered at nucleotide (nt) -180 (with respect to the alpha-globin cap site). A fivefold-weaker site is located downstream of the alpha-globin poly(A) addition site, at nt +1049. We mapped five EF-1-binding sites near the murine beta-globin gene. The strongest site was centered at nt -210. Four additional sites were centered at nt -266 (adjacent to the binding site of a factor present in both murine erythroleukemia and Raji cells), -75 (overlapping the beta-globin CCAAT box), +543 (within the second intervening sequence), and -111.
