We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence for the cDNA encoding human dihydrolipoyl transacylase (E2) using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) procedure. The full-length E2 cDNA is 3535 nucleotides in length. The coding region spans 1446 bp and the 3'-noncoding region spans 2074 bp. The latter contains three Alu repetitive sequences and two transcription termination sites.
