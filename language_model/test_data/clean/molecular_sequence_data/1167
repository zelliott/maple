A cecropin-like antimicrobial peptide, Gm cecropin, was purified from hemolymph of larvae of the wax moth, Galleria mellonella, immunized against E. coli, and its antibacterial activity was examined in a radial diffusion assay. The molecular mass of Gm cecropin was 4,160.69 Da by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis. The full-length cDNA of the Gm cecropin precursor was cloned by a combination of RT-PCR, based on the N-terminal sequence obtained by Edman degradation, and 5'-RACE-PCR. Analysis of the cDNA showed that cecropin is synthesized as a prepropeptide, with a putative 22-residue signal peptide, a 4-residue propeptide and a 39-residue mature peptide with a calculated mass of 4,344.18 Da the difference between the calculated and measured masses suggests that Gm cecropin is a 37-residue peptide generated by removal of the C-terminal residue and amidation.
