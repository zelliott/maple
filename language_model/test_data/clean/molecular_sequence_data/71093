Previous data indicated that Pseudomonas aeruginosa exoenzyme S (ExoS) ADP-ribosylated Ras at multiple sites. One site appeared to be Arg41, but the second site could not be localized. In this study, the sites of ADP-ribosylation of c-Ha-Ras by ExoS were directly determined. Under saturating conditions, ExoS ADP-ribosylated Ras to a stoichiometry of 2 mol of ADP-ribose incorporated per mol of Ras. Nucleotide occupancy did not influence the stoichiometry or velocity of ADP-ribosylation of Ras by ExoS. Edman degradation and mass spectrometry of V8 protease generated peptides of ADP-ribosylated Ras identified the sites of ADP-ribosylation to be Arg41 and Arg128. ExoS ADP-ribosylated the double mutant, RasR41K,R128K, to a stoichiometry of 1 mol of ADP-ribose incorporated per mol of Ras, which indicated that Ras possessed an alternative site of ADP-ribosylation. The alternative site of ADP-ribosylation on Ras was identified as Arg135, which was on the same alpha-helix as Arg128. Arg41 and Arg128 are located within two different secondary structure motifs, beta-sheet and alpha-helix, respectively, and are spatially separated within the three-dimensional structure of Ras. The fact that ExoS could ADP-ribosylate a target protein at multiple sites, along with earlier observations that ExoS could ADP-ribosylate numerous target proteins, were properties that have been attributed to several vertebrate ADP-ribosyltransferases. This prompted a detailed alignment study which showed that the catalytic domain of ExoS possessed considerably more primary amino acid homology with the vertebrate mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases than the bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that ExoS may represent an evolutionary link between bacterial and vertebrate mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases.
