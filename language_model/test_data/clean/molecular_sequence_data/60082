The polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities of the marine melanogenic strains MMB-1T and 2-40 were compared. Both contained a multifunctional PPO able to oxidize a wide range of substrates. In spite of this similarity, phylogenetic studies based on 16S rRNA sequences showed that these strains are not closely related. Strain 2-40 is not related to any previously described genus. On the basis of these studies and morphological and physiological characteristics, it is proposed that strain MMB-1T (= CECT 4803T = ATCC 700492T) represents a new species in the genus Marinomonas, Marinomonas mediterranea sp. nov.
