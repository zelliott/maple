The aim of the study was to characterize a spirochaete isolated from the lesions of a cow with digital dermatitis (DD).

The characterization was on the basis of its light and electron microscopic appearance, enzymic profile and DNA sequence analysis of its flagellin and 16S rRNA genes. The spirochaete was 6-8-microm long and 0.2-0.3 microm in diameter, and possessed seven to eight periplasmic flagella, with three to five helical turns. The enzymic profile of the bacterium resembles, but is not identical to that of Treponema brennaborense. Its flagellin gene sequence was identical to that of Treponema phagedenis but distinct from that of an ovine spirochaete. Analysis of a 1477-bp region of the 16S rRNA genes indicated that this is a Treponema species and that it is indistinguishable from some isolates made from cases of bovine DD in the United States. Finally, electron microscopy revealed the presence of myovirus-like bacteriophage particles in all cultures of the treponeme examined.

The spirochaete isolate was identified as a Treponema species closely related to some isolates from the United States (by 16S rDNA) and to T. phagedenis (by flagellin gene sequence) and is associated with bacteriophage particles.

The fact that the isolates with the same or very similar 16S rDNA sequences have been obtained from cases of bovine DD in cattle in different countries at different times, lends further support to the hypothesis that treponemes play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease.
