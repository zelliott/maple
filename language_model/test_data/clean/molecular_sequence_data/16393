A novel human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQB1 allele, DQB1*020102, was detected in a 28-year-old woman of Han ethnic in Guangzhou, China. Compared with HLA-DQB1*020101 and HLA-DQB1*0202, they differed in only one nucleotide at the position 167 (C to T) of exon 2, which was a highly conserved position. This is a synonymous mutation, which does not cause any change in the amino acid sequence of mature protein.
