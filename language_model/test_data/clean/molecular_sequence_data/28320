The Leishmania tarentolae cytochrome oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) subunit II (COII) and maxicircle unidentified reading frame 3 (MURF3) mRNAs are edited internally by the addition of four and five uridine residues, respectively, which eliminate -1 and +1 reading frameshifts in the gene sequences. The editing events in COII are conserved in three kinetoplastid species, and those in MURF3 are conserved in two species. A primer extension assay showed that the ratio of edited to unedited RNA differed for each gene: 89% of the COII and 36% of the MURF3 transcripts are edited. Preliminary evidence was obtained for translation of the edited COII transcript into protein: antibodies generated against a synthetic peptide with the predicted carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence reacted with a polypeptide of the correct molecular weight in immunoblots of a mitochondrial lysate.
