Haptoglobin belongs to the major constituents of plasma and acts as hemoglobin-binding and acute-phase protein. Due to the occurrence of three major allelic variants and further structural modifications, the alpha chains of haptoglobin form varying spot patterns in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) gels, which is generally observed in differential proteome analyses using plasma or related body fluids of humans. In the present study plasma samples from 10 donors of initially unknown haptoglobin phenotype were separated by 2-DE and tryptic digests of excised haptoglobin alpha chain spots were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and MALDI-quadrupole ion trap TOF-MS. Haptoglobin alpha1S, alpha1F, as well as alpha2 chains were found to occur each with at least three structurally differing protein species: (i) the unmodified form, which corresponds to the sequence database entries; (ii) derivatives, in which asparagine at position five is deamidated to aspartic acid; and (iii) derivatives with an additional C-terminal arginine residue. These structural variants account for the most commonly observed spot patterns of haptoglobin alpha chains in Coomassie-stained gels. Additionally, a minor derivative of the haptoglobin alpha2 chain carrying both modifications, deamidation at position five and the C-terminal arginine residue, was identified. Theoretical pI values of the characterized structural variants are, consistent with their observed migration in the 2-DE gels.
