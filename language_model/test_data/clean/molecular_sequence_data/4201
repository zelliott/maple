Over the past few years, several new 3' 5' exonucleases have been identified. In vitro studies of these enzymes have uncovered much about their potential functions in vivo, and certain organisms with a defect in 3' 5' exonucleases have an increased susceptibility to cancer, especially under conditions of stress. Here, we look at not only the newly discovered enzymes, but also at the roles of other 3' 5' exonucleases in the quality control of DNA synthesis, where they act as proofreading exonucleases for DNA polymerases during DNA replication, repair and recombination.
