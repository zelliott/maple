To analyze the secondary structure of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) for the prediction and screening of candidate receptor-binding domain of CTGF.

Bioinformatics method was employed to predict and screen CTGF receptor-binding domain based on the analysis of secondary structure of CTGF, and its hydrophilicity and physical property.

The results showed that the candidate receptor-binding domains locate in 96-102, 104-112, 257-272 segments, the corresponding amino acid sequences are TAKDGAP, IFGGTVYRS and IRTPKISKPIKFELSG, respectively.

There were 3 candidate receptor-binding domains of CTGF, which might be the targets for newly antagonistic micromolecule polypeptide of CTGF.
