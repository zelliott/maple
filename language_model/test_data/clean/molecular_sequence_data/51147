The secY gene product is an essential component of the Escherichia coli cytoplasmic membrane, which mediates the protein translocation across the membrane. We found a gene homologous to secY in the genome of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC7942. The deduced amino acid sequence, 439 amino acids long, shows 43% homology with that of the E. coli secY. The hydrophobic profile suggests that the Synechococcus SecY protein is an integral membrane protein containing ten membrane-spanning segments, which are closely related to the E. coli counterpart. The SecY protein may participate in the protein translocation across the cytoplasmic or thylakoid membrane in Synechococcus PCC7942.
