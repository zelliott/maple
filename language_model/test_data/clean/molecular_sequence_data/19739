HIV-1 evolution in the envelope gene (env) was analyzed in four asymptomatic antiretroviral therapy na√Øve patients with typical and slow disease progression rates. In typical progressors, viral populations were monophyletic and two distinct evolutionary patterns were observed. In one patient, HIV-1 evolution displayed a strong temporal structure similar to the consistent pattern previously described. In the other, viral evolution displayed a lack of temporal structure with no increase in genetic heterogeneity and divergence over time. In slow progressors, several clades were observed in viral populations. However, analysis within the major sub-population revealed the same two evolutionary patterns described for typical progressors. Synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rate analyses indicated that positive selection was the major force driving HIV-1 evolution in viral populations with temporal structure, while evolution in viral populations with an atemporal structure was dominated by genetic drift and purifying selection. These results support the existence of distinct patterns of env evolution in untreated HIV-1-infected patients.
