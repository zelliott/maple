Carrot (Daucus carota L.) cell suspensions were treated with a spirostanol saponin from Yucca. This saponin is an elicitor of callose synthesis. Irrespectively of the mode of action of spirostanol on the callose synthase activity itself, the spirostanol-induced callose synthesis in carrot is not preceded by changes in membrane potential, cytosolic free calcium or cytosolic pH. The inability of modulators of cytosolic free calcium content (verapamil, nifedipine and Br-A23187), EGTA and a proton pump inhibitor (vandate) to inhibit or induce callose formation is consistent with a calcium- and pH-independent mechanism for callose deposition.
