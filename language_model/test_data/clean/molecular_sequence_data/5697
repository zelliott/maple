Dynein heavy chains are involved in microtubule-dependent transport processes. While cytoplasmic dyneins are involved in chromosome or vesicle movement, axonemal dyneins are essential for motility of cilia and flagella. Here we report the isolation of dynein heavy chain (DHC)-like sequences in man and mouse. Using polymerase chain reaction and reverse-transcribed human and mouse testis RNA cDNA fragments encoding the conserved ATP binding region of dynein heavy chains were amplified. We identified 11 different mouse and eight human dynein-like sequences in testis which show high similarity to known dyneins of different species such as rat, sea urchin or green algae. Sequence similarities suggest that two of the mouse clones and one human clone encode putative cytoplasmic dynein heavy chains, whereas the other sequences show higher similarity to axonemal dyneins. Two of nine axonemal dynein isoforms identified in the mouse testis are more closely related to known outer arm dyneins, while seven clones seem to belong to the inner arm dynein group. Of the isolated human isoforms three clones were classified as outer arm and four clones as inner arm dynein heavy chains. Each of the DHC cDNAs corresponds to an individual gene as determined by Southern blot experiments. The alignment of the deduced protein sequences between human (HDHC) and mouse (MDHC) dynein fragments reveals higher similarity between single human and mouse sequences than between two sequences of the same species. Human and mouse cDNA fragments were used to isolate genomic clones. Two of these clones, gHDHC7 and gMDHC7, are homologous genes encoding axonemal inner arm dyneins. While the human clone is assigned to 3p21, the mouse gene maps to chromosome 14.
