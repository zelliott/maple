A wide diversity of biological functions have been attributed to the highly conserved and ubiquitous 14-3-3 protein family. Yet how much of this diversity is inherent in the basic structure of 14-3-3 and how much is due to isoform specific functions is not yet fully understood. Here, two Caenorhabditis elegans 14-3-3 isoforms whose protein sequences are 90% similar were found to differ significantly in both their genomic structure and expression patterns. The two genes, ftt-1 (IV) (fourteen-three-three) and ftt-2 (X), differ in both the position and sequence of their introns. Since the various intron/exon boundaries respect neither functional nor structural protein motifs, the introns appear to be relatively recent evolutionary additions. ftt-1(IV) encodes three germline enhanced transcripts, two of which are related through the differential use of alternative poly(A) addition sites. RNA in situ hybridization studies reveal high levels of ftt-1 throughout the gonad with particularly high levels in the distal arm. In contrast, ftt-2 (X) encodes a single transcript which is expressed somatically. In embryos, high levels of ftt-1 transcripts appear to be maternally supplied, whereas ftt-2 is expressed as an early zygotic transcript whose expression pattern later localizes to the posterior region of post-proliferative embryos. These expression pattern differences between ftt-1 and ftt-2 suggest that these two 14-3-3 isoforms perform distinct biological roles within the worm.
