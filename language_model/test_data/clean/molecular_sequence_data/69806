The conformation of two fragments of rabbit uteroglobin is described. The peptides are PRFAHVIENLL and PQTTRENIMKLTEKIVK, corresponding to helices I and IV in the crystal structure. CD shows that both peptides interact with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles and change their conformation to an alpha-helix. The helical content estimated from the CD band at 222 nm is about 40% in each peptide. Surface tension measurements show that both peptides lower the critical micellar concentration (cmc) of SDS, with a more dramatic effect in the case of helix I. This peptide by itself acts as a surfactant, and is able to interact with SDS even below the observed cmc, forming beta aggregates. Proton magnetic resonance (1H-nmr) suggests that flexible helices are present. The longest helical stretches compatible with 1H-nmr data extend from Phe6 to Leu14 for helix I and from Arg53 to Ile63 for helix IV.
