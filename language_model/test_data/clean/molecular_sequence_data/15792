Three strains of passionfruit woodiness virus, Tip Blight (PWV-TB), Severe (PWV-S) and Mild (PWV-M), were compared on the basis of their biological, serological and coat protein structural properties. Each of the strains could be distinguished on the basis of their reactions on selected test plant species but no differences were observed in the serological properties of the three PWV strains. Molecular weight estimates on SDS-PAGE suggest the PWV coat protein contains 275 amino acid residues and sequence data for 269 of these residues is presented. The amino terminal peptide is blocked and has not been sequenced. The coat proteins of PWV-TB and PWV-S, which cause severe symptoms in infected plants, showed only three sequence differences compared to the eleven or twelve sequence changes between their coat proteins and that of the mild strain. The high sequence homology (96-99%) between the three PWV strains is similar to that previously reported for two strains of tobacco etch virus and three strains of sugarcane mosaic virus. Sequence homology between the three strains of PWV and published sequences for the coat proteins of eight distinct potyviruses ranged from 43-71% (average 57%).
