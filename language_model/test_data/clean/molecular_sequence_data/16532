The murine Abcg1 gene is reported to consist of 15 exons that encode a single mRNA (herein referred to as Abcg1-a) and protein. We now demonstrate that (i) the murine gene contains two additional coding exons downstream of exon 1, (ii) transcription involves the use of multiple promoters, and (iii) the RNA undergoes alternative splicing reactions. As a result, three mRNAs are expressed that encode three putative protein isoforms that differ at their amino terminus. ABCG1 transcripts are induced in vivo in multiple tissues in response to the liver X receptor ligand T0901317. Identification and characterization of four liver X receptor response elements in the intron downstream of exon 2 provides a mechanism by which this induction occurs. Importantly, cholesterol efflux to high density lipoprotein was stimulated following transfection of Hek293 cells with plasmids encoding individual ABCG1 isoforms. In situ hybridization studies in embryonic day 11.5-15.5 mouse embryos revealed strong expression of ABCG1 transcripts in the olfactory epithelium, hind brain, eye, and dorsal root ganglia. The relatively high levels of expression in neuronal tissues and the eye suggest that ABCG1-dependent cholesterol efflux may be critical for normal neuronal function in addition to its role in macrophages.
