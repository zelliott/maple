This chapter discusses the alternative splicing of glutathione S-transferase proteins, including current investigations of enzymatic, nonenzymatic functions, as well as structural differences between the alternatively spliced products. The data demonstrate that the different GST splice forms possess different properties, both in their catalytic function and in the effects of their protein-protein interactions.
