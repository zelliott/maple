Enzymatically active and inactive (diisopropylfluorophosphate-treated) cathepsin G exerted antibacterial action in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus, whereas only enzymatically active cathepsin G displayed bactericidal action against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In order to further test the requirement for protease activity for the antipseudomonal action of cathepsin G, synthetic peptides spanning the full-length mature protein were prepared and examined for antibacterial action. Surprisingly, three structurally distinct peptides that correspond to residues 61 to 80, 117 to 136, and 198 to 223 within the full-length protein were found to exert potent antipseudomonal action (> 4.5 logs of killing at 500 micrograms/ml) against P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and four mucoid clinical isolates. Only the peptide (CG117-136) corresponding to residues 117 to 136 (117-RPGTLCTVAGWGRVSMRRGT-136) within cathepsin G exerted antibacterial action against the gram-positive pathogen S. aureus. The antipseudomonal action of CG117-136 was rapid and could be inhibited either by increasing concentrations of NaCl or by 0.5 mM MgCl2 plus 0.5 mM CaCl2, and these conditions appeared to reduce binding of the peptide to whole bacteria. Variants of peptide CG117-136 lacking either a hydrophobic N-terminal domain or a positively charged C-terminal domain were found to have significantly less antipseudomonal action than CG117-136. The antibacterial capacity of the all-D-enantiomeric form of peptide CG117-136 was found to be identical to that of the all-L-peptide, suggesting that the mechanism of killing does not require the recognition of a target site possessing a chiral center.
