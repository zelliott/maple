Enzymatic degradation of hyaluronan (HA) by testicular hyaluronidase (HAase, hyaluronate 4-glucanohydrolase) requires inclusion of mono- or divalent cations in the reaction mixture. Most divalent cations activated HAase with equal potency; however, Cu2+ suppressed degradation, and Ca2+ showed a concentration-dependent regulation of size of the oligosaccharide products. Careful selection of HAase assay parameters is critical for discovery of novel HAase inhibitors and for preparation of controlled-size oligosaccharide fragments.
