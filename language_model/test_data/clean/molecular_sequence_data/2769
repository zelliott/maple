The major secreted proteinase of Entamoeba histolytica, a 56-kDa neutral cysteine proteinase, activates C by cleaving C3. The action of the proteinase is similar to C-derived C3 convertases because it produces a single cleavage of the alpha-chain in a dose- and time-dependent manner and cleaves C3 between residues 78 and 79, only one amino acid residue distal to the natural site acted on by the C3 convertases. C3a generation was detected by RIA. The 105-kDa fragment produced by the cleavage of the alpha-chain was structurally and functionally equivalent to the alpha'-chain of C3b, as demonstrated by susceptibility to the action of factors I and H and participation in the activation of the alternative pathway of C. Activation of C by the 56-kDa neutral cysteine proteinase may play a role in the early inflammatory response in amebic lesions and thus contribute to the pathogenesis of invasive amebiasis.
