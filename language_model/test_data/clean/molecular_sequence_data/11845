We have identified a mouse gene encoding a 65-kDa protein (FKBP65) that shares homology with members of the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) class of immunophilins. Predicted amino acid sequence shows that this protein shares significant homology with FKBP12 (46%), FKBP13 (43%), FKBP25 (35%), and FKBP52 (26%). FKBP65 contains four predicted peptidylprolyl cistrans-isomerase (PPIase) signature domains, and, although similar in size, is distinct from FKBP52 (also identified as FKBP59, hsp56, or HBI), which contains three FKBP12-like PPIase domains. With N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide as the substrate, recombinant FKBP65 is shown to accelerate the isomerization of the prolyl peptide bond with a catalytic efficiency similar to other family members. This isomerization activity is inhibited by FK506 and rapamycin, but is not sensitive to Cyclosporin A. Based on Northern blot analysis, FKBP65 mRNA transcripts are present in lung, spleen, heart, brain, and testis. A polyclonal antibody, raised against a COOH-terminal peptide (amino acid residues 566-581), was used to immunoprecipitate FKBP65 from NIH3T3 cells and demonstrate that FKBP65 is a glycoprotein. In addition, [32P]orthophosphate labeling experiments show that FKBP65 is also a phosphoprotein. These results suggest that FKBP65 is a new FKBP family member.
