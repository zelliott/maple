Many undomesticated legumes harbor nodule bacteria related to the soybean symbiont Bradyrhizobium elkanii, but little is known about their phylogenetic relationships or geographic distribution. Sequences of ribosomal genes (16S rRNA and partial 23S rRNA) and the nitrogenase alpha-subunit gene (nifD) were analyzed in 22 isolates of this group sampled from diverse legumes in Korea, Japan, the USA, Mexico, Costa Rica and Panama. Some strains from Asia and North America shared identical sequences for both ribosomal genes. However, pairs of strains with closely related nifD sequences were almost never found in different regions. The major exceptions involved North American isolates B. elkanii USDA 76 and USDA 94, which had nifD sequences highly similar to certain Korean strains. However, 16S rRNA sequences of USDA 76 and USDA 94 were closely related to Central American rather than Asian bradyrhizobia, implying that these strains are genetic mosaics combining sequences from distinct ancestral areas. Several other conflicts between rRNA and nifD tree topologies indicated that the genealogical histories of these loci have been influenced by recurrent lateral gene transfer events.
