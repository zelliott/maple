The citrate transport determinant of plasmid pES1 from Klebsiella pneumoniae [Schwarz E. and D. Oesterhelt (1985) EM BO J. 4, 1599-1603] has been subcloned in Escherichia coli DH1. The DNA sequence of a 1723-base fragment that codes for the citrate carrier has been determined and the gene product has been characterized with the T7 promoter system. The DNA fragment contains an open reading frame of 1332 base pairs and codes for a protein of 444 amino acids. The hydropathy profile suggests that the protein is very hydrophobic and contains 12 membrane-spanning segments centered around a hydrophilic core. The gene for the citrate carrier has 66% similarity with a citrate carrier determinant from a naturally occurring plasmid responsible for secondary transport of citrate across the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli.
