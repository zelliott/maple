A full length cDNA encoding the growth hormone receptor (GHR) of Chinese sturgeon was cloned in order to investigate the mechanism of growth hormone in regulating the growth of Chinese sturgeon. The open reading frame of the cloned Chinese sturgeon growth hormone receptor (csGHR) cDNA encodes a trans-membrane protein of 611 amino acids containing all the characteristic motifs of GHR. By sequence alignment, substitutions of amino acid residues highly conserved in other species were identified. Using the CHO cell culture system, the function of csGHR and the biological significance of the amino acid substitution in csGHR were examined. The promoter of serine protease inhibitor 2.1 (Spi2.1) was trans-activated upon stimulation of seabream GH (sbGH) in the csGHR-expressing CHO cells. Furthermore, CHO cells stably expressing csGHR were stimulated to proliferate by sbGH. In agreement with our previous report, Chinese sturgeon growth hormone-binding protein (csGHBP) was detected in the culture medium of CHO cells stably expressing csGHR. Mutation of Asp residue in the ligand binding motif in csGHR to Glu significantly enhanced csGHR's biological function, whereas mutation of Asp residue to Ala decreased its biological function. The results demonstrated that the cloned csGHR was of full biological function and the csGHBP could be generated through proteolysis of csGHR. These findings might provide new insights into thoroughly understanding the regulatory mechanism of Chinese sturgeon growth.
