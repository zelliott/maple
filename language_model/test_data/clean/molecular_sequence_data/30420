Polyoma virus large tumor antigen (PyV T antigen) has been purified to near homogeneity by immunoaffinity column chromatography. We have detected DNA helicase and ATPase (nucleoside-5'-triphosphatase) activities in the purified PyV T antigen fraction and characterized these activities. The ATPase activity was stimulated about 2-fold by poly(dT), which was the most effective stimulator among the synthetic polynucleotides tested. Natural nucleic acids, such as calf thymus native and heat-denatured DNA, and single-stranded circular fd DNA were also effective, but the degree of stimulation was less than 1.5-fold. The basal and poly(dT)-stimulated ATPase activities showed similar preference for nucleoside 5'-triphosphates, requirement for divalent cations, and pH optima. The preference for nucleoside 5'-triphosphates was ATP, dATP greater than CTP, UTP much greater than GTP. The only difference observed between the two activities was salt sensitivity. The basal ATPase activity was resistant to KC1 up to 300 mM. In contrast, poly-(dT)-stimulated activity was reduced to the level of basal activity at 300 mM KC1. DNA helicase activity required divalent cations and was dependent on hydrolysis of ATP. The activity showed similar preference for nucleoside 5'-triphosphates, requirement for divalent cations, and pH optimum as the two ATPase activities, and the salt sensitivity of DNA helicase activity was similar to that of poly(dT)-stimulated ATPase activity. The helicase activity was inhibited competitively by the addition of single-stranded or double-stranded DNA, and a relatively high inhibitory activity was observed with poly [d(A-T)]. The PyV T antigen helicase was found to migrate in the 3' to 5' direction along the DNA strand to which the protein bound.
