Molecular taxonomic studies were performed on two LL-diaminopimelic acid-containing coryneform isolates from herbage. The results indicate that the herbage strains represent a new species of the genus Nocardioides for which the name Nocardioides fastidiosa sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NCIB 12713.
