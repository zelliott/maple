We have isolated and sequenced a full-length cDNA for rabbit kidney aminopeptidase N (APN). The 3-kilobase cDNA contains 12 nucleotides of the 5' noncoding region, a 2898 nucleotide long open reading frame, and 113 nucleotides of the 3' untranslated region. The open reading frame encodes a type II membrane protein of 966 amino acid residues composed of a 10 residue NH2-terminal cytosolic domain, a 23 residue transmembrane domain, and a large 933 residue ectodomain that contains the active site. Rabbit APN has eight potential N-glycosylation sites and seven cysteine residues, one of which is located in the transmembrane domain. Computer analysis showed that the enzymes from human, rat, and rabbit were highly conserved, except for the stalk region immediately downstream from the transmembrane domain. Using in situ hybridization techniques we showed that in rabbit kidney, APN mRNA is present in proximal tubules but not in glomeruli, which corresponds to the localization of the protein observed by immunohistochemistry. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the expression of APN in kidney is modulated at mRNA levels and not at translational and (or) posttranslational levels.
