Human infection due to Nocardiopsis, an actinomycete, is rare and the majority of those infections are due to Nocardiopsis dassonvillei. This agent has been implicated in cutaneous, pulmonary, eye and disseminated infections. It has never been isolated from the nose or any nasal infection. We report here a rare case of nasal vestibular abscess due to N. dassonvillei in an adult diabetic patient. The bacterium was identified on the basis of morphological and biochemical characteristics, and confirmed by sequencing the 16S rRNA and hsp65 genes. The patient was successfully treated with clarithromycin and levofloxacin. Though N. dassonvillei infections may be rare, the study highlights that it may cause a wide spectrum of disease manifestations, and laboratories should take care to isolate and identify the easily treatable pathogen.
