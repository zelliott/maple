A total of 390 adult ticks (288 Ixodes ovatus and 102 I. persulcatus ) collected at the foot of Mt. Fuji and two near cities in Shizuoka prefecture, Japan, were examined for Ehrlichia infection by isolation with laboratory mice from whole tick tissues. Ehrlichial DNAs were detected from the spleens of mice inoculated with tissues from I. ovatus, but not I. persulcatus. The prevalence of ehrlichiae in the ticks was estimated to be ca. 3%. The 16S rDNA analysis revealed that the sequences of 8 ehrlichial isolates (termed "Shizuoka" isolates) obtained were identical, and they were very similar, but not identical, to those of two Ehrlichia species strain variants recently isolated in Japan, followed by Ehrlichia chaffeensis in the US. Analysis of parts of the omp-1 multigene family specific for monocytic ehrlichiosis agents showed that the Shizuoka isolates were distinct from other ehrlichial organisms. The Shizuoka isolates caused death in immunocompetent laboratory mice, suggesting that they are highly pathogenic in mice. The data show that the Shizuoka isolates are likely to be a new strain variant of Ehrlichia species in Japan. Further characterization and surveillance will be required in Japan due to the presence of these human ehrlichiosis agent-like organisms.
