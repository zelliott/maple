Metallothioneins chelate metals and consequently may be a control point of metal homeostasis. Homologous to type 3 metallothioneins, TcMT3 cDNA was identified in the Cd/Zn hyperaccumulator, Thlaspi caerulescens. TcMT3 amino acid sequence showed modifications in the Cys positions when compared with its Arabidopsis orthologue. A structural model established that the MT3 carboxyterminal domain is similar to the beta domain of animal metallothioneins and predicts a smaller cavity to chelate metals for A. thaliana than for T. caerulescens. Functional testing in yeast and Northern blot analysis added further evidence for adaptative variations of MT3 for the maintenance of Cu homeostasis in a metal hyperaccumulator.
