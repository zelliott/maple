Complementary DNA clones encoding mouse cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor (CSIF; interleukin-10), which inhibits cytokine synthesis by TH1 helper T cells, were isolated and expressed. The predicted protein sequence shows extensive homology with an uncharacterized open reading frame, BCRFI, in the Epstein-Barr virus genome, suggesting the possibility that this herpes virus exploits the biological activity of a captured cytokine gene to enhance its survival in the host.
