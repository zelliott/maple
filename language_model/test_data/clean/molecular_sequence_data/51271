The most recent developments in mammalian cell inducible expression systems have involved the use of bacterial gene control elements and viral transactivator proteins. The combination of hybrid viral transactivator and bacterial repressor proteins, and simple chemical inducers can provide induction ratios of over 1000-fold. These developments will have applications in both cell-based research and the generation of transgenic animals.
