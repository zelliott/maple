Transgenic plants expressing either bean yellow mosaic potyvirus or chimeric potyvirus coat protein (CP) were inoculated with various potyviruses. Antigen-coated plate, indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoelectron microscopy of virus purified from transgenic plants showed that progeny virions contained from < 1% to as much as 25% transgenic CP. Different levels of transcapsidation may reflect the extent of compatibility between transgene CP and the viral CP.
