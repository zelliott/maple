The first case of cavitary pulmonary disease caused by Purpureocillium lilacinum is described. The isolate showed atypical microscopic characteristics similar to Acremonium and Fusarium spp., which necessitated molecular identification by sequencing of multiple conserved loci. The patient responded to voriconazole, reinforcing its therapeutic efficacy for P. lilacinum infections.
