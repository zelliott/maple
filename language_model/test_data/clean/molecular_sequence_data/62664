To investigate the contribution of amino acid residues to the thermostability of phospholipase D (PLD), a chimeric form of two Streptomyces PLDs (thermolabile K1PLD and thermostable TH-2PLD) was constructed. K/T/KPLD, in which residues 329-441 of K1PLD were recombined with the homologous region of TH-2PLD, showed a thermostability midway between those of K1PLD and TH-2PLD. By comparing the primary structures of Streptomyces PLDs, the seven candidates of thermostability-related amino acid residues of K1PLD were identified. The K1E346DPLD mutant, in which Glu346 of K1PLD was substituted with Asp by site-directed mutagenesis, exhibited enhanced thermostability, which was almost the same as that of TH-2PLD.
