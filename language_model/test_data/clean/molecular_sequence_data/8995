We report the full-genome sequence of an Indian isolate of bluetongue virus serotype 1 (BTV-1), strain IND1992/01. This is the first report of the entire genome sequence (Seg-1 to Seg-10) of an Eastern (e) strain of BTV-1. These sequence data provide a reference for BTV-1e that will help to define the phylogenetic relationships and geographic origins of distinct Indian lineages of BTV-1 as well as their relationships with other BTV strains from around the world. The availability of data for all 10 genome segments of this strain will also help to identify reassortment events involving this and other virus lineages.
