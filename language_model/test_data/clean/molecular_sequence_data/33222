Plasmodium vivax, a protozoan malaria parasite of humans, represents a major public health concern in the Republic of Korea (= South Korea). However, little is known about the genetic properties and population structures of the P. vivax isolates circulating in South Korea. This article reviews known polymorphic genetic markers in South Korean isolates of P. vivax and briefly summarizes the current issues surrounding the gene and population structures of this parasite. The critical genetic characteristics of major antigens of the parasite, such as circumsporozoite protein (CSP), merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) and MSP-3, Duffy binding protein (DBP), apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1), and GAM-1, are also discussed.
