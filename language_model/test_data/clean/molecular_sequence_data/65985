Picolinamidination of amino groups in peptides was carried out using ethyl picolinimidate tetrafluoroborate synthesized from picolinamide and triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate. The N-terminal amino group as well as the epsilon-amino group of lysine were derivatized. The matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) signal of a peptide was enhanced 20-35-fold upon picolinamidination depending on the number of amino groups derivatized. The signal enhancement effect is much higher than that of acetamidination or guanidination previously reported. Improved protein identification by mass mapping of the derivatized peptides was demonstrated.
