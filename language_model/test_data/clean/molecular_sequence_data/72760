C-Type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is the third member of the natriuretic peptide family which plays an important role in body fluid homeostasis. To determine a possible role of CNP in regulation of an inner ear fluid, we investigated the expression of CNP and atrial natriuretic peptide B receptor (ANP-B receptor) mRNAs in rat inner ear using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. Amplification products with sizes expected for CNP and ANP-B were detected in the inner ear. After cloning and analysis, the sequences for PCR products were identical to those of CNP or ANP-B receptor in the brain. These results indicate that both CNP and ANP-B receptor are expressed in the inner ear of the rat and suggest that CNP may play a role in inner ear function (such as regulation of inner ear fluid) in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner.
