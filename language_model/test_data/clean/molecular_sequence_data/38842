Kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein (KCBP) is a novel member of the kinesin superfamily that is involved in cell division and trichome morphogenesis. KCBP is unique among all known kinesins in having a myosin tail homology-4 region in the N-terminal tail and a calmodulin-binding region following the motor domain. Calcium, through calmodulin, has been shown to negatively regulate the interaction of KCBP with microtubules. Here we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify the proteins that interact with the tail region of KCBP. A protein kinase (KCBP-interacting protein kinase (KIPK)) was found to interact specifically with the tail region of KCBP. KIPK is related to a group of protein kinases specific to plants that has an additional sequence between subdomains VII and VIII of the conserved C-terminal catalytic domain and an extensive N-terminal region. The catalytic domain alone of KIPK interacted weakly with the N-terminal KCBP protein but strongly with full-length KCBP, whereas the noncatalytic region did not interact with either protein. The interaction of KCBP with KIPK was confirmed using coprecipitation assays. Using bacterially expressed full-length and truncated proteins, we have shown that the catalytic domain is capable of phosphorylating itself. The association of KIPK with KCBP suggests regulation of KCBP or KCBP-associated proteins by phosphorylation and/or that KCBP is involved in targeting KIPK to its proper cellular location.
