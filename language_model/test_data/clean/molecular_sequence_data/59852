Binding of laurate (n-dodecanoate) to genetic variants of albumin or its proprotein and to normal albumin isolated from the same heterozygous carriers was studied by a kinetic dialysis technique at physiological pH. The first stoichiometric association constant for binding to proalbumin Lille (Arg-2-->His) and albumin (Alb) Roma (Glu321-->Lys) was increased to 126% and 136% respectively compared with that for binding to normal albumin, whereas the constant for Alb Maku (Lys541-->Glu) was decreased to 80%. In contrast, normal laurate-binding properties were found for as many as nine other albumin variants with single amino acid substitutions. Because the net charges of all these mutants were different from that of normal albumin, the results suggest that the examples of modified laurate binding are not caused by long-range electrostatic effects. Rather, the three positions mentioned are located close to different binding sites for the fatty acid anion. The most pronounced effect was observed for the glycosylated Alb Casebrook, the binding constant of which was decreased to 20%. Binding to the glycosylated Alb Redhill was also decreased, but to a smaller extent (68%). These decreases in binding are caused by partial or total blocking of the high-affinity site by the oligosaccharides, by the negative charges of the oligosaccharides, and/or by conformational changes induced by these bulky moieties. Laurate binding to two chain-termination mutants (Alb Catania and Alb Venezia) was normal, indicating that the C-terminus of albumin is not important for binding. By using different preparations of normal albumin as controls in the binding experiments, it was also possible to compare the effect of various methods for isolation and defatting on laurate binding.
