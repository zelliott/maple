We isolated the actin gene of the glaucocystophyte alga Cyanophora paradoxa and analyzed the coding region and its introns. Phylogenetic analyses of the actin coding region and the inferred protein sequence in data sets containing 47 other actin sequences show Cyanophora to be a member of the eukaryotic crown-group radiation in agreement with ribosomal DNA sequence analyses. Four of the five Cyanophora actin introns are relatively short (55-59 nt) and occupy novel positions in a catalogue of actin introns containing 56 distinct sites. The fifth intron has a length of 171 nt and occurs also in actin genes from green algae and the crustacean Artemia.
