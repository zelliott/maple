A retrospective phylogenetic analysis was performed on isolates of Enterocytozoon bieneusi to characterize the genotypes in different patient cohorts. Fifty-seven isolates, collected from patients living in Malawi and the Netherlands, were classified by age and immune status of the hosts. Sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region identified 16 genotypes; nine have not previously been described. Genotypes K and D were most prevalent among patient groups, whereas genotype C was restricted to transplantation patients receiving immunosupressives and genotype B showed a predisposition toward patients living with HIV/AIDS. Different genotypes showed more dispersion among isolates from Malawi compared with those from the Netherlands. A constructed map estimating the genealogy of the ITS region reveals a dynamic evolutionary process between the genotypes.
