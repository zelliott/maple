Aptamers are short single-stranded DNA or RNA oligonucleotides that are selected in vitro by their affinity and specificity for the target. Binding is a consequence of the particular tertiary structure that they are able to acquire, depending on their sequence. Parasites of the genus Leishmania belongs to the lower eukaryote order Kinetoplastida that causes leishmaniosis in man and animals. Histone genes in Leishmania are of considerable interest because these flagellates do not condense their chromatin during mitosis. Thus, the study of the structural features of histones has been considered of particular interest and, as a result, in recent years a great number of histone genes have been characterized in trypanosomatids. Histones are extremely conserved proteins, reflecting their apparent universality of function. Sequence similarity of kinetoplastid core histones those of higher eukaryotes is found predominantly in the globular region with high sequence divergences in the N- and in the C-terminal domains. These divergences indicate that they may be potential diagnostic and/or therapeutics targets. We have successfully isolated a pool of DNA sequences, named SELH2A, which specifically binds to Leishmania infantum H2A. When tested in an enzyme-linked oligonucleotide assay, slot blot and Western blot analysis, the aptamer pool exhibited specificity in its ability to bind only to H2A antigen but not to other proteins from L. infantum including other histones. Thus, it appears that this novel anti-H2A aptamer population may be of potential application as a diagnostic system for leishmaniosis.
