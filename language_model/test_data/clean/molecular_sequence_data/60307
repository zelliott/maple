Pollen cells are symplasmically isolated during maturation and germination. Pollen therefore needs to take up nutrients via membrane carriers. Physiological measurements on pollen indicate sucrose transport in the pollen tube. A cDNA encoding a pollen-specific sucrose transporter-like protein NtSUT3 was isolated from a tobacco pollen cDNA library. NtSUT3 expression is detected only in pollen and is restricted to late pollen development, pollen germination and pollen tube growth. Altogether these data indicate that pollen is supplied not only with glucose, but also with sucrose through a specific sucrose transporter. The respective contribution of each transport pathway may change during pollen tube growth.
