A mannose-specific lectin was isolated from leaves of Neoregelia flandria, an ornamental plant that belongs to Bromeliaceae, a family of monocotyledons. The amino acid composition and molecular mass of the lectin were similar to those of mannose-specific lectins from other monocotyledons. However, in a test to examine the inhibition of hemagglutination, it became apparent that the isolated lectin recognized D-glucose and N-acetyl D-glucosamine in addition to D-mannose, unlike mannose-specific lectins from the monocotyledons that have been reported to date.
