In this report it is suggested that at early stages of evolution ribosomes were responsible for synthesizing short oligonucleotide cDNA packets which formed the protogenic tandem repetitive sequences. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) could have been the most probable template for such a synthesis. rRNA has homology with the monomers of tandem hypervariable repetitive elements of the genome. A model for the proposed participation of rRNA in the genesis of genomic fragments is provided by analysis of the active center of GTP-binding proteins. The role of oligonucleotides, synthesized by the ribosome, in the context of mechanisms of genome regulation, genes responsible for disease and human longterm memory formation are also discussed.
