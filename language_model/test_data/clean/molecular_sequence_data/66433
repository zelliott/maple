Caspases are essential components of the apoptotic machinery in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Here, we report the isolation of a mutant allele of the Drosophila effector caspase drICE as a strong suppressor of hid- (head involution defective-) induced apoptosis. This mutant was used to determine the apoptotic role of drICE. Our data are consistent with an important function of drICE for developmental and irradiation-induced cell death. Epistatic analysis suggests that drICE acts genetically downstream of Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (Diap1). However, although cell death is significantly reduced in drICE mutants in all assays, it is not completely blocked. A double-mutant analysis between drICE and death caspase-1 (dcp-1), another effector caspase, reveals that some cells (type I) strictly require drICE for apoptosis, whereas other cells (type II) require either drICE or dcp-1. Thus, these data demonstrate a barely appreciated complexity in the apoptotic pathway, and are consistent with current models about effector caspase regulation in both vertebrates and invertebrates.
