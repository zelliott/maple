Osteogenic Disorder Shionogi (ODS) rats, which cannot synthesize ascorbic acid due to a deficiency of L-gulonolactone oxidase, become scorbutic when not supplied with dietary ascorbic acid. We used the deficient rats to study the effects of ascorbic acid on the amount of cytochrome P450 enzymes in liver microsomes. The total amount of hepatic cytochrome P450 in ODS rats deprived of ascorbic acid was lower by approximately 40%, whereas ODS rats fed with ascorbic acid and the wild strain had the same level of total hepatic cytochrome P450. Western blot analysis for various forms of cytochrome P450 in liver microsomes indicated that the amount of CYP1A2 was significantly higher in ascorbic acid deficient rats. On the other hand, amounts of CYP2B2 and 3A were lower, and those of CYP2E1 and CYP2C6/11 were unaffected. In accordance with the higher amount of CYP1A2, Northern blot analysis showed increased expression of CYP1A2 mRNA. The capacity of microsomes to produce mutagens from 2-amino-6-methyl-dipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole acetate (Glu-P-1) and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole acetate (Trp-P-2) was higher in scorbutic ODS rats by the Ames test. These results indicate that the effects of ascorbic acid deficiency on the expression of cytochrome P450 in ODS rat livers are form-specific and that the increased CYP1A2 is associated with increased metabolic activation of promutagens in the scorbutic state.
