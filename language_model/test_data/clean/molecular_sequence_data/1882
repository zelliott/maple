Thirty species and one variety of Symplocos (Symplocaceae), including all taxa distributed in Japan, were phylogenetically analyzed with DNA sequence data. The evolution of morphological characters is discussed on the basis of the phylogenetic relationships obtained. All species were Asian, except one, S. austromexicana, from Mexico. The nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and two intergenic spacer regions, between trnL and trnF, and between trnH and psbA of chloroplast DNA were used. The topologies of trees obtained from ITS and the chloroplast intergenic spacers are largely congruent. S. sonoharae, the representative of the subgenus Symplocos in Asia, was sister to all other species. The position of the American species, S. austromexicana, which also belongs to the subgenus Symplocos, was not well resolved. The phylogenetic tree based on combined sequence data largely supports the monophyletic origin of the infrageneric sections proposed earlier. However, the phylogenetic relationship between them is not well resolved, probably due to rapid diversification. The section Palura, a deciduous group, is well defined in the DNA analysis, suggesting its independent status in the genus Symplocos. In spite of their morphological divergence, the three endemic species of the Bonin Islands are monophyletic. The occurrence of curved seeds seems to be homoplastic, scattered over the phylogenetic tree without showing a particular infrageneric relationship.
