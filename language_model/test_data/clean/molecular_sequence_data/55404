The effects of culture conditions on 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD) production and its possible scale-up have been studied. A newly isolated Bacillus amyloliquefaciens B10-127, belonged to GRAS microorganisms and showed a remarkable 2,3-BD producing potency, was used for this experiment. Corn steep liquor, soybean meal and ammonium citrate were found to be the key factors in the fermentation according to the results obtained from the Plackett-Burman experimental design. The optimal concentration range of the three factors was examined by the steepest ascent path, and their optimal concentration were further optimized via response surface methodological approach and determined to be 31.9, 22.0 and 5.58 g/l, respectively. The concentration of the obtained 2,3-BD increased significantly with optimized medium (62.7 g/l) when compared with unoptimized medium (45.7 g/l) and the 2,3-BD productivity was about 2.4-fold (The fermentation time was shorten from 72 to 42 h). To observe scale-up effects, batch fermentation was carried out at various working volumes. At a working volume of 20.0 l, the final 2,3-BD concentration and yield were 61.4 and 0.38 g/g at 36 h with a 2,3-BD productivity of 1.71 g/l h. This result shows similar amount of 2,3-BD obtained in lab-scale fermentation, and it is possible to scale up to larger fermentors without major problems.
