An anomalous high frequency of ATL was observed in a remote 'noir maroons' village of French Guiana. Since it is not clear if HTLV-I is responsible for different frequencies of disease in different geographical areas, we undertook a comparison of the population with a similar one located in Gabon. We found a much higher degree of gp46 surface envelope glycoprotein sequence conservation in the Guianese village than in the Gabonese one.
