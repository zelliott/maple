During a survey for beta-thalassemia in Kashi City, Xinjiang Province, P.R. China, four unrelated Uygur students were identified as heterozygotes for the beta-thalassemia frameshift at codon 8 (-AA). Detection was with the polymerase chain reaction combined with allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. This beta-thalassemia allele has not been observed in the Chinese population before and might be rather specific for the Uygur nationality.
