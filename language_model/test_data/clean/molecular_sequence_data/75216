The sequences of two minicircles from the kinetoplast DNA of the CL strain and one of the Y strain of Trypanosoma cruzi are reported. These 1.4 kb molecules have a peculiar sequence organization, the most distinctive feature being the occurrence of a 120 bp sequence repeated four times, located at 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees along each circle. We have termed these conserved regions in this species 'minirepeats'. Minirepeats have a 3-fold higher concentration of cytosine residues in comparison with the variable regions and contain the universal 12-mer motif GGGGTTGGTGTA present in all sequenced minicircles and which was shown to be involved in DNA replication. A consensus sequence of T. cruzi minirepeats was determined using the 20 minirepeats present in five known T. cruzi minicircle sequences. This consensus sequence contains regions which have been remarkably well preserved in strains which show great biological diversity. In addition a low level of intraminicircle sequence similarity was also observed within the variable region, but this similarity did not extend between strains. The abundance of conserved minirepeat sequences containing invariant restriction sites in T. cruzi cells may prove valuable for the development of new direct diagnostic methods for Chagas' disease based on DNA probe technology.
