The number of tree-pollen-allergic patients showing allergic reactions to apples, various vegetables and nuts is increasing. In this paper the molecular characterization of the major apple allergen, Mal d 1, is reported. The cDNA coding for Mal d 1 was cloned and sequenced. Its open reading frame codes for a protein of 159 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 17.7 kDa and a predicted pI of 5.9. Sequence comparison to Bet v 1, the major birch pollen allergen, revealed 64.5% identity on the amino acid level and 55.6% identity on the nucleic acid level. Recombinant Mal d 1 was expressed in the plasmid pMW 175 in E. coli BL 21 (DE3) and its immunological properties were tested. Crossreactivity with Bet v 1 was shown by inhibition assays.
