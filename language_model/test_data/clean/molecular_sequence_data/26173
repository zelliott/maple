A graphical procedure for analysis of helical parameters in dynamic structure of DNA is described. The performance of the procedure is illustrated by analysis of a 20 ps dynamics simulation of the non-self-complementary ninemer, 5'CAAACAGGA:5'TCCTGTTTG, which is a part of DNA from lacI gene. The dynamics trajectory of the duplex shows sequence-dependent fluctuations of helical parameters.
