Eight 5' ends of RNA molecules which encompass the bacteriophage T4 base plate late genes 51 to 26 region have been mapped by S1 nuclease protection and reverse transcription within a 246-bp DNA segment. Two of eight 5' ends are initiated at two absolutely conserved late promoter sites, P51 and P26a, that direct RNA synthesis on opposite strands. These two promoters share four of eight promoter sequence base pairs. A third 5' end arises from another promoter, P26b, which shows one base pair mismatch with respect to the absolutely conserved -10 sequence. All the other 5' ends arise from RNA processing and/or degradation. Since no other late transcription promoter sites were found within the base plate cluster sequence, we propose that the two overlapping late promoters, P51 and P26a, direct the expression of the T4 base plate gene cluster, included between map coordinates 114,000 and 121,038: P51 directs the transcription of genes 51, 27, 28, 29, 48, and 54 on the rDNA strand and P26a the transcription of genes 26 and 25 on the /DNA strand. This peculiar promoter configuration might account for the low level of transcription of these late genes.
