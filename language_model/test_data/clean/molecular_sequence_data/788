Histochemical characterization of the equine guttural pouches was performed using lectins combined with sialidase digestion and deglycosylation pre-treatments. The goblet cells contained O- and N-linked oligosaccharides with alpha-Fuc, GlcNAc moieties whereas beta-GalNAc, beta-Gal-(1-3)-GalNAc, beta-Gal-(1-4)-GlcNAc and alpha-Gal residues belonged only to O-linked glycoproteins. The acinar and ductal cells expressed alpha-Man/alpha-Glc in N-linked oligosaccharides, GlcNAc in both O- and N-glycoproteins and beta-GalNAc, beta-Gal-(1-3)-GalNAc, beta-Gal-(1-4)-GlcNAc and alpha-Gal residues included in O-linked glycoproteins. The Golgi area of the epithelial lining expressed alpha-Fuc in O-linked glycoproteins, internal GlcNAc in N-linked glycoproteins and large amounts of sialic acid residues linked to subterminal beta-GalNAc, Galbeta1,4GlcNAc and Galbeta1,3GalNAc. High amounts of sulpho-carbohydrates and of sialic acids (alpha2,3-6), linked to-alpha/beta-Gal and sialic acids (alpha2-6) linked to beta-GalNAc, were also demonstrated. Such diversity of the mucin saccharide residues may be implicated in the binding of macromolecules such as those of bacterial or viral etiology, thus playing a role in the organism's host-defense mechanism in the guttural pouches.
