Sapelovirus is a member of the family Picornaviridae and is emerging as an enteric porcine, simian, and avian pathogen. Here, we report the genome sequence of a novel porcine sapelovirus strain YC2011 isolated from piglets with severe diarrhea. The availability of the genome sequence is helpful to further investigations of molecular characteristics and epidemiology of porcine sapelovirus.
