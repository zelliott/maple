We identified in Dictyostelium a gene snwA containing a region of similarity to SH2 domains of higher eukaryotes. snwA is homologous to a novel human gene SNW1 and to Bx42 from Drosophila melanogaster, a gene coding for a chromatin binding protein responsive to 20-OH-ecdysone. snwA has one mRNA transcript of an approximate size of 2.5 kb.
