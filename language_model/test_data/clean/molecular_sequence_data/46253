Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases have been well known to be responsible for the synthesis of endogenous compounds and the metabolism of exogenous compounds in almost all living organisms, which require NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) as an electron donor to function. In this study, a 2031 bp open reading frame of POR gene was cloned from 35-day-old Roman hen liver, encoding an enzyme of 676 amino acids. Sequence analysis showed that chicken POR shares high homology with other vertebrates PORs and possesses the conserved binding domains of FAD, FMN, and NADPH. The genomic sequences of POR genes from chicken and other four vertebrates have highly conserved exon/intron organization structure. By fusion with bacterial signal peptide, chicken POR gene was functionally expressed in E. coli membrane and showed activities in reduction of cytochrome c and oxidation of NADPH. The Km values for cytochrome c and NADPH were 21.9 ± 2.3 μM and 2.4 ± 0.3 μM respectively. A Ping-Pong mechanism was proposed for chicken POR.
