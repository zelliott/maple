Although atopic allergy affects </=20% of the total population, the relationship between the protein structure and immunogenic activity of the allergens is still largely unknown. We observed that group 5 grass allergens are characterized by repeated structural motifs. Using a new algorithm, TEPITOPE, we predicted promiscuous HLA-DR ligands within the repeated motifs of the Lol p5a allergen from rye grass. In vitro binding studies confirmed the promiscuous binding characteristics of these peptides. Moreover, most of the predicted ligands were novel T cell epitopes that were able to stimulate T cells from atopic patients. We generated a panel of Lol p5a-specific T cell clones, the majority of which recognized the peptides in a cross-reactive fashion. The computational prediction of DR ligands might thus allow the design of T cell epitopes with potential useful application in novel immunotherapy strategies.
