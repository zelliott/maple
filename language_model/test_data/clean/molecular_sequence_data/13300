Nerve injury alters the function of Schwann cells from quiescent, myelin forming cells to proliferating cells that facilitate nerve repair. The transcription factor, Zif268, may be involved in transmitting injury-related signals since its expression is rapidly induced by nerve transection in vivo and without intervening protein synthesis by injury-related signals in vitro. Expression of the low-affinity p75 nerve growth factor receptor (NGFRp75) by Schwann cells after nerve injury closely correlated with the zif268 expression profile, and Zif268 transactivated the NGFRp75 promoter in transient transfection assays. Conversely, the NGFRp75 gene was not expressed when Zif268 protein was depleted by stable transfection of antisense cDNA. Moreover, nuclear proteins corresponding to Zif268 bound to the NGFRp75 promoter by Southwestern blotting, indicating that a direct interaction of Zif268 with the NGFR gene is required for its expression in Schwann cells.
