A homologue of the ABI3 gene was isolated from the conifer species, Chamaecyparis nootkatensis. The deduced protein of 794 amino acids exhibited sequence similarity to other VP1/ABI3 proteins within four regions. Expression occurs exclusively in seeds, with no detectable mRNA in leaves and roots. Unlike the homologues of angiosperms, CnABI3 may be encoded by more than one gene.
