Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus is highly pathogenic for humans and remains the only Category A virus for which full sequence information is currently unavailable. In this study we completed CCHF genome characterization by determining the L segment sequence using Dugbe and CCHF virus-specific oligonucleotides. Sequence alignments revealed the presence of four previously described conserved regions in all Bunyaviridae polymerases. Interestingly, additional regions containing putative Ovarian Tumor (OTU)-like cysteine protease and helicase domains were identified in the L segments of CCHF and Dugbe viruses, suggesting an autoproteolytic cleavage process for nairovirus L proteins.
