The cDNA for xylanase B from Penicillium purpurogenum was cloned and sequenced. This DNA encodes a protein of 208 amino acids which is expected to yield a protein of 183 residues upon processing of the N terminus. The sequence of the predicted protein is very similar to that of 40 other xylanase domains which belong to family G of cellulases/xylanases (73-21% identity).
