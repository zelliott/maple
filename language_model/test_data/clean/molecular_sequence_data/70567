The 'promiscuous' E2A gene, at 19p13.3, is fused with two different molecular partners, PBX1 and HLF, following two chromosome translocations recurrent in childhood pre-B ALL. We have identified a novel gene, FB1, by virtue of its fusion with E2A and by a combination of molecular techniques. FB1 was localized on 19q13.4, suggesting that the novel chimera originated by a cryptic rearrangement of chromosome 19. Two FB1 transcripts, of 1.2 kb and 1.1 kb, are differentially expressed at low level in a variety of human tissues, including hemopoietic cell lines from different lineages. Accordingly, FB1 cDNA displays high homology with a number of cDNA clones from different human tissues. High homology was found also with cDNA clones from mouse and rat, suggesting that the sequence might be conserved at least among mammals. The function of the putative FB1 protein, however, is currently unknown as database sequence comparisons have failed to reveal strong homology with known proteins. The E2A/FB1 fusion appears to be a recurrent feature of pre-B ALLs, suggesting that it might have a role in the development and/or progression of leukemogenesis.
