Comprehensive sequence specific (1)H, (15)N, and (13)C resonance assignments are reported for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv0287-Rv0288 protein complex. Analysis of the chemical shift data obtained indicates that each protein in the complex contains two relatively long helical regions joined by an irregular loop.
