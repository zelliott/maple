Incubation of purified Escherichia coli biodegradative threonine dehydratase with glyoxylate resulted in covalent binding of 1 mol of glyoxylate per mol of protein with concomitant loss of enzyme activity. The glyoxylate-binding site was identified as a heptapeptide representing amino acid residues Ser-33-Asn-Tyr-Phe-Ser-Glu-Arg-39 in the protein primary structure. Addition of glyoxylate to a culture of E. coli cells led to time-dependent enzyme inactivation. Immunoprecipitation with anti-dehydratase antibody of extract from [14C]glyoxylate-treated cells revealed labeled dehydratase polypeptide. These results are interpreted to mean that enzyme inactivation by glyoxylate in E. coli cells is associated with covalent protein modification.
