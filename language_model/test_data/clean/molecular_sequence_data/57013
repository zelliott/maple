Commercially important traits of domestic animals have often been genetically linked to sex chromosomes, such as the Z chromosome of chickens. Using a backcross mapping population between two divergent, inbred lines and random-amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR markers, a genetic map of the chicken Z chromosome has been generated. Thirteen Z-linked RAPD markers were identified, mapped, and linked to two RFLPs and one phenotypic marker. The protocol used also generated RAPD markers for the W chromosome. The linkage distances obtained suggest that the RAPD markers are widely distributed throughout the Z chromosome and are likely to be linked to most or all traits of interest on this chromosome. The map provides a preliminary estimate of genetic to physical distance of about 0.5 Mb per centimorgan for the Z chromosome in chickens (male-specific recombination). A similar approach should be applicable to facilitate the mapping and analysis of sex-linked traits in other domestic animals.
