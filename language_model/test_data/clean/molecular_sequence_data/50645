The complete nucleotide sequence of apple stem grooving virus (ASGV) genome has been determined. The genome is 6496 nucleotides in length excluding a 3'-terminal poly(A) tail and contains two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 begins at nucleotide position 37 and is terminated at position 6341, encoding a protein with a molecular weight of 241 kDa. ORF2, which is in a different reading frame within ORF1, begins at position 4788 and can encode a 36-kDa protein. The 241-kDa protein contains two consensus sequences associated with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the NTP-binding helicase. Comparisons of amino acid sequences around these conserved motifs with other RNA viruses revealed that ASGV has extensive similarities with apple chlorotic leaf spot, tymo-, carla-, and potexviruses, and is a member of the sindbis-like supergroup. ASGV coat protein is found to be located in the C-terminal region of the 241-kDa polyprotein. The 36-kDa protein encoded by ORF2 contains the consensus sequence Gly-Asp-Ser-Gly found in the active site of several cellular and viral serine proteases.
