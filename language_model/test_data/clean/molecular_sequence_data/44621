A sequential assignment protocol for proteins was developed using heteronuclear 3D NMR. The protocol consists of an amino acid type recognition algorithm and a primary sequence mapping algorithm. The former measures the similarity between each detected spin pattern and 20 standard amino acid coupling patterns. Both chemical shift and topologically likeness are considered. The mapping algorithm uses the amino acid type information to direct detected polypeptides to proper position onto protein primary sequence. The assignment protocol can be applied to spin systems generated by many different approaches. We designed a few computer programs to derive a protein's backbone and side chain spin systems using heteronuclear 3D NMR. The results was then input to the sequential assignment protocol. All of the algorithms were tested on NMR data of a 90-residue N-domain of chicken skeletal troponin-C.
