The maize autonomous transposable element Ac was introduced into haploid Nicotiana plumbaginifolia via Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformation of leaf disks. All the regenerated transformants (R0) were diploid and either homozygous or heterozygous for the hygromycin resistance gene used to select primary transformants. The Ac excision frequency was determined using the phenotypic assay of restoration of neomycin phosphotransferase activity and expression of kanamycin resistance among progeny seedlings. Some of the R0 plants segregated kanamycin-resistant seedlings in selfed progeny at a high frequency (34 to 100%) and contained one or more transposed Ac elements. In the primary transformants Ac transposition probably occurred during plant regeneration or early development. Other R0 transformants segregated kanamycin-resistant plants at a low frequency (< or = 4%). Two transformants of this latter class, containing a unique unexcised Ac element, were chosen for further study in the expectation that their kanamycin resistant progeny would result from independent germinal transposition events. Southern blot analysis of 32 kanamycin-resistant plants (R1 or R2), selected after respectively one or two selfings of these primary transformants, showed that 27 had a transposed Ac at a new location and 5 did not have any Ac element. Transposed Ac copy number varied from one to six and almost all transposition events were independent. Southern analysis of the R2 and R3 progeny of these kanamycin-resistant plants showed that Ac continued to transpose during four generations, and its activity increased with its copy number. The frequency of Ac transposition, from different loci, remained low (< or = 7%) from R0 to R3 generations when only one Ac copy was present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
