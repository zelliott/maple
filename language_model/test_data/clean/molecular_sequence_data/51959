A DNA mapping panel derived from an interspecific backcross was used to position the mouse insulin-2 locus (Ins-2) on Chromosome 7, near H19 (0/114 recombinants) and Th (1/114 recombinants). Ins-2 is part of a human-mouse conserved linkage group that includes Th, H19, and Igf-2. Analysis of segregation in the F2 generation from the cross C57BL/6J-tub/tub x CAST/Ei demonstrated that Ins-2 and the obesity mutant tubby (tub) are distinct loci, thus eliminating Ins-2 as a candidate gene for tub. These results also refine the estimated genetic distance between tub and Hbb to 2.4 +/- 1.4 cM. The predicted location for a human homolog of tubby is HSA 11p15.
