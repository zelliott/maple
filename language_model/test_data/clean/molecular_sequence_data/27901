Novel antibodies were raised against a synthetic NH2-terminal myristoyl glycine moiety which is characteristic of N-myristoyl-proteins. Antisera raised against N-myristoyl-Gly-hemocyanin reacted with N-myristoyl-Gly-[125I]albumin. The immunoreaction was competed for by albumin conjugated with N-myristoyl-glycine, while underivatized albumin had no effect. Of the [3H]myristate-labeled proteins detected, pp60v-src, which is a transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus, and p19gag and p17gag, which are core proteins in the human T-cell leukemia virus and the human immunodeficiency virus, were identified as N-myristoylated proteins by the radioimmunoprecipitation analyses with the antibody.
