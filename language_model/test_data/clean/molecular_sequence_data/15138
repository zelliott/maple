To explore the association of microbial community structure with the development of eutrophication in a large shallow freshwater lake, Lake Taihu.

The bacterial and archaeal assemblages in sediments of different lake areas were analysed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of amplified 16S rDNA fragments. The bacterial DGGE profiles showed that eutrophied sites, grass-bottom areas and relatively clean sites with a eutrophic (albeit dredged) site are three respective clusters. Fifty-one dominant bacterial DGGE bands were detected and 92 corresponding clones were sequenced, most of which were affiliated with bacterial phylotypes commonly found in freshwater ecosystems. Actinobacteria were detected in the centre of the lake and not at eutrophied sites whereas the opposite was found with respect to Verrucomicrobiales. Twenty-five dominant archaeal DGGE bands were detected and 31 corresponding clones were sequenced, most of which were affiliated with freshwater archaeal phylotypes.

The bacterial community structures in the sediments of different areas with similar water quality and situation tend to be similar in Taihu Lake.

This study may expand our knowledge on the relationship between the overall microbial assemblages and the development of eutrophication in the shallow freshwater lake.
