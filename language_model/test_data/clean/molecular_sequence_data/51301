PCR primers of arbitrary nucleotide sequence have identified DNA polymorphisms useful for genetic mapping in a large variety of organisms. Although technically very powerful, the use of arbitrary primers for genome mapping has the disadvantage of characterizing DNA sequences of unknown function. Thus, there is no reason to anticipate that DNA fragments amplified by use of arbitrary primers will be enriched for either transcribed or promoter sequences that may be conserved in evolution. For these reasons, we modified the arbitrarily primed PCR method by using oligonucleotide primers derived from conserved promoter elements and protein motifs. Twenty-nine of these primers were tested individually and in pairwise combinations for their ability to amplify genomic DNA from a variety of species including various inbred strains of laboratory mice and Mus spretus. Using recombinant inbred strains of mice, we determined the chromosomal location of 27 polymorphic fragments in the mouse genome. The results demonstrated that motif sequence-tagged PCR products are reliable markers for mapping the mouse genome and that motif primers can also be used for genomic fingerprinting of many divergent species.
