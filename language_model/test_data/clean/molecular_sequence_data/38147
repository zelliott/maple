Alanine-scanning site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on all conserved lysine residues of pigeon cytosolic NADP(+)-dependent malic enzyme. Only two mutant enzymes, K162A and K340A, showed significant effect on their kinetic parameters. Both mutant enzymes have K(m) values for Mn(2+) and l-malate similar to those of wild-type. The K(m) value for NADP(+) of K162A is identical to that of wild-type. However, K162A demonstrated a 235-fold decrease in the k(cat) value (0.17 +/- 0.01 vs 40.0 +/- 1.3 s(-1)). These data suggested that the side chain of K162 is important for the enzyme catalytic reaction. We propose that the epsilon-amino group of K162 may serve as a general acid to protonate the 3-carbon of enolpyruvate after decarboxylation. The K340A mutant demonstrated no effect on the k(cat) value. However, its K(m) value for NADP(+) was increased by a factor of 65 (225.7 +/- 5.07 vs 3.49 +/- 0.05 microM). We propose that the NADP(+) specificity is determined by the electrostatic interaction between the epsilon-amino group of K340 and 2'-phosphate of NADP(+).
