From August 2 to October 11, 2006, clusters of low pathogenicity (LP) North American lineage H5N1 and H7N3 avian influenza A viruses (AIV), and other subtypes, were recovered from free-flying, resident, wild mallards used as sentinels at one site. The antigenic subtypes, pathogenicity potential, and Sanger sequencing of the isolates determined the H5N1 and H7N3 isolates were only recovered from samples collected on 8/2/2006 and 9/8/2006, respectively. However, subsequent efforts using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and additional Sanger sequencing found partial H7 segments in other HA-NA virus combinations on 8/2/2006, 9/8/2006 and 10/11/2006. It is well established that over larger geographic areas and years AIVs form transient genomic constellations; this sequential sampling data revealed that over a short period of time the dynamics of AIVs can be active and newer sequencing platforms increase recognition of mixed infections. Both findings provide further insight into the natural history of AIVs in natural reservoirs.
