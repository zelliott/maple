Some proteins of cypovirus (CPV) bind to RNA, probably contributing to the replication of viral genome. However, little is known about whether any protein from Heliothis armigera cypovirus (HaCPV) could bind to RNA. In this study, we cloned the ORF of segment 9 (S9) of HaCPV, serotype 14, into pMAL-c2X for the generation and purification of maltose binding protein (MBP) fused protein p36 (MBP-p36). The analysis of the RNA-binding properties of MBP-p36 revealed that p36, but not MBP alone, bound to ssRNA of CPV. Furthermore, the ssRNA-binding activities of p36 were significantly inhibited or completely eliminated by protein denaturants or unsuitable concentrations of NaCl. Importantly, the formation of ssRNA/p36 was only competitively inhibited by a heavy dose of competitive non-viral ssRNA or dsRNA, but not by ssDNA and dsDNA, suggesting that p36 bound to both ssRNA and dsRNA, but not DNA. Moreover, the characterization of different mutants of p36 revealed that the regions 1-26aa, 154-170aa, and 229-238aa, but not region 291-320aa, may be crucial for the ssRNA-binding ability of p36. Conceivably, the sensitivity of p36 to denaturants and the synergetic effect of different regions suggest that the RNA-binding ability of p36 may be conformation-dependent. Thus, our findings provide new insights into understanding the genomic function of HaCPV-14.
