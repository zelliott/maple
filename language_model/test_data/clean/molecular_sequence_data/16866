The structural variants of the regulatory and coding regions of the LTR-retrotransposon 1731 are described. Two classes of genomic copies of retrotransposon 1731, with and without frameshifting strategy to express Gag and Pol proteins, were earlier revealed in the D. melanogaster genome. Copies without frameshifting are shown to be evolved from an ancient variant with frameshifting and are widespread in the genomes of the melanogaster complex species. Position of a rare codon responsible for ribosome pausing and efficient frameshifting is identified. Two structural variants of 1731 LTRs were detected in the melanogaster complex species: the predominant structural variant A1A2 of 1731 LTR in the D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. sechellia genomes contains duplicated and diverged copies of 28 bp in the U3 region, whereas A1 variant lacking this duplication is expanded in the D. mauritiana genome. Selective expansion of the A1A2 variant was detected in the independently established D. melanogaster cell cultures. A1A2 variant is expressed in embryos, cell culture, and testes, whereas A1 is expressed only in testes of D. melanogaster. Relief of expression of the A1A2 but not A1 variant in the ovaries as a result of mutation in the RNA interference (RNAi) spn-E gene is shown. Thus, expansion of the recently evolved genomic variants of the LTR retrotransposon 1731 possessing a new translation strategy, duplication in the U3 region, and extended profile of expression is revealed.
