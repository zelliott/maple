A monosaccharide-modified β-loop peptide library displayed on phage has been constructed and used for the screening of glycopeptide ligands against a carbohydrate-binding protein. The β-loop peptide library was designed and modified with a mannose derivative on phage. The glycopeptide ligands to concanavalin A (ConA), a mannose-binding protein, were obtained from the mannose-modified peptide phage library. The amino acids neighboring the mannose unit of glycopeptides not only reinforced the binding affinity but also gave diverse binding characteristics.
