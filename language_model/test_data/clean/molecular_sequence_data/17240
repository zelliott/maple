The estrogen-receptor-related (ERR) receptors are orphan members of the nuclear receptor superfamily that bind to their specific DNA target sites as homodimers. However, it has not been shown whether this mode of binding is required for the transcriptional activation they drive. We here show that heterodimerization can also occur between these receptors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the unique amphioxus ortholog of ERR genes (AmphiERR) is expressed as two isoforms differing by an in-frame insertion. While the short isoform behaves like its mammalian counterparts, the long isoform (AmphiERR(L)) displays divergent transcriptional properties according to the target site to which it binds. Indeed, AmphiERR(L) binds as a monomer but does not activate transcription through the SF1 response element (SFRE). On the contrary, this isoform binds as a homodimer and activates transcription through the classical estrogen-response element. Our results strongly suggest that dimerization is required for transactivation exerted by the ERR receptors.
