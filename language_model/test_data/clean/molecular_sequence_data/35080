The IncHI1 plasmid pSRC27-H from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium carries a region containing several genes that confer resistance to different antibiotics, and this resistance region is in the same position as related resistance regions in a group of sequenced IncHI1 plasmids from various sources that includes pHCM1. Four further additional segments are found in pHCM1 relative to another IncHI1 plasmid, R27. Using PCR or DNA sequencing to detect the presence or absence of each of these additional segments in the same position in the IncHI1 backbone, plasmid pSRC27-H was found to include them. However, in one case the additional segment was smaller in pSRC27-H, lacking a transposon carrying a second resistance region in pHCM1. The sequences of IncHI1 plasmids, pO111_1 and pMAK1, were also examined and found to share the same or closely related additional segments. The structure of the additional material in pHCM1, pO111_1 and pMAK1 was examined, and potential novel transposons were identified. These additional segments define an IncHI1 lineage (pHCM1, pO111_1, pMAK1, pSRC27-H) which we designated type 2 to distinguish it from type 1 (R27, pAKU_1, pP-stx-12). A segment from the Escherichia coli genome and an adjacent copy of IS1 in pHCM1 was defined by comparison to pO111_1 and pMAK1, which lack it. pSRC27-H also lacks it. This structure is present in the same position in R27 and type 1 plasmids, but in the opposite orientation, and appears to have been incorporated via IS1-mediated transposition. The PCRs developed provide a simple means of distinguishing type 1 and type 2 IncHI1 plasmids based on the presence or absence of variable regions.
