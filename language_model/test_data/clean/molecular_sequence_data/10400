A 4.4-kb DNA fragment from Legionella pneumophila (Lp) was isolated, which could complement an Escherichia coli (Ec) dnaK ts mutant, HC4102. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the region revealed two complete open reading frames (ORFs) encoding both a predicted DnaK protein of 644 aa and a predicted GrpE protein of 199 aa, and also the 5'-end of the predicted dnaJ gene organized in the order of grpE-dnaK-dnaJ. Consensus heat shock (HS) promoter sequences were identified upstream of the start of both grpE and dnaK transcripts. However, no obvious promoter sequences were detected upstream of dnaJ. The transcription start points of grpE and dnaK were determined by primer extension analysis and the amount of each of the transcripts increased four- to eightfold after HS.
