Glycodeterminants play an important role in mediating cellular and cell-substrate interactions during development and immune-related reactions enabling an organism to distinguish self determinants from non-self or modified-self determinants. One of the hallmarks of sugar recognition molecules (lectins) is their wide range of binding activities and their organisation in multigene families. Here we describe a group of Drosophila genes that are possible members of the C-type lectin family.
