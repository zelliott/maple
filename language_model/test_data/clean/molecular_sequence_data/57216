We have cloned and determined the nucleotide sequence of the gene (CBF2) specifying the large (110 kD) subunit of the 240-kD multisubunit yeast centromere binding factor CBF3, which binds selectively in vitro to yeast centromere DNA and contains a minus end-directed microtubule motor activity. The deduced amino acid sequence of CBF2p shows no sequence homologies with known molecular motors, although a consensus nucleotide binding site is present. The CBF2 gene is essential for viability of yeast and is identical to NDC10, in which a conditional mutation leads to a defect in chromosome segregation (Goh, P.-Y., and J. V. Kilmartin, in this issue of The Journal of Cell Biology). The combined in vitro and in vivo evidence indicate that CBF2p is a key component of the budding yeast kinetochore.
