Three bacterial strains, designated MT1(T), RW10(T) and IpA-2(T), had been isolated previously for their ability to degrade chlorosalicylates or isopimaric acid. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis demonstrated that these bacteria are related to species of the genus Pseudomonas. Analysis of the results of DNA-DNA hybridization with several close phylogenetic neighbours revealed a low level of hybridization (less than 57 %). On the basis of phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic analysis, DNA-DNA relatedness data and chemotaxonomic analysis, it is concluded that these isolates represent separate novel species, for which the names Pseudomonas reinekei sp. nov. (type strain MT1(T) =DSM 18361(T)=CCUG 53116(T)), Pseudomonas moorei sp. nov. (type strain RW10(T) =DSM 12647(T)=CCUG 53114(T)) and Pseudomonas mohnii sp. nov. (type strain IpA-2(T) =DSM 18327(T)=CCUG 53115(T)) are proposed.
