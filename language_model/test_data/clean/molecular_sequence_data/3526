Uniaxially aligned phospholipid bilayers are often used as model membranes to obtain structural details of membrane-associated molecules, such as peptides, proteins, drugs, and cholesterol. Well-aligned bilayer samples can be difficult to prepare and no universal procedure has been reported that orients all combinations of membrane-embedded components. In this study, a new method for producing mechanically aligned phospholipid bilayer samples using naphthalene, a sublimable solid, was developed. Using (31)P-NMR spectroscopy, comparison of a conventional method of preparing mechanically aligned samples with the new naphthalene procedure found that the use of naphthalene significantly enhanced the alignment of 3:1 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine to 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol. The utility of the naphthalene procedure is also demonstrated on bilayers of many different compositions, including bilayers containing peptides such as pardaxin and gramicidin. These results show that the naphthalene procedure is a generally applicable method for producing mechanically aligned samples for use in NMR spectroscopy. The increase in bilayer alignment implies that this procedure will improve the sensitivity of solid-state NMR experiments, in particular those techniques that detect low-sensitivity nuclei, such as 15N and 13C.
