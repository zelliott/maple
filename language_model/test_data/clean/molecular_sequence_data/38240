The advent of the antibiotic era ushered in a shift towards non-pathogen-specific therapy of infectious diseases. This led to an overt emphasis on targeting microbial pathogens while strategies directed towards enhancing host immunity were neglected. In an effort to decrease sole reliance on antimicrobials, the time has come for a critical reappraisal of nonantibiotic, albeit immune response-enhancing substances. The diverse array of natural, synthetic, and recombinant immunomodulators discussed in this review succinctly demonstrate the potential of these agents to stimulate host defense mechanisms for prophylaxis and treatment of various microbial infections.
