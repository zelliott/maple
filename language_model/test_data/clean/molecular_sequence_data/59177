Using a probe obtained by PCR amplification from mouse genomic DNA, a genomic clone was isolated covering the entire mouse preprogalanin gene. The mouse gene has an exon:intron organisation very similar to that of the rat and human genes. The first exon is noncoding while exons 2-5 carry the coding region. Exon 6 also encodes the stop codon and a polyadenylation signal. The deduced amino-acid sequence of mouse preprogalanin is 94% and 68% identical to the rat and human peptide, respectively. The amino-acid sequence of mouse galanin was confirmed by RT-PCR amplification of mouse brain RNA. The cloning of the mouse galanin gene should allow elucidation of the regulatory characteristics of its promoter and facilitate transgenic approaches to the analysis of galanin gene function in this species.
