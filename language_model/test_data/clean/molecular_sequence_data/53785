A new type of skin wart was observed in a Japanese patient. It was characterized by intracytoplasmic inclusions with a 'fibrillar' structure which were distinct from previously described wart-associated inclusions. The papillomavirus (HPV)-group-specific antigen could be detected, but DNA hybridization and PCR amplification using probes or PCR primers specific for the main skin HPV genotypes (including HPV-63 which is also associated with 'filamentous' inclusions) were negative. We consider that this cytopathic effect could correspond to an HPV genotype which has not yet been characterized.
