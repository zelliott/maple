STSs, which have been used to build and format clone contigs, have been used here to assemble a transcriptional map across a cytogenetic band. Of fifty one STSs in Xq28, 20 were positive by RT-PCR. Thus, an additional 20 possible ESTs were detected among the STSs, and seven of these also identified cDNAs in at least one library. The transcripts confirm the high expression level of this region, correlated with its GC compositional map and CpG island content.
