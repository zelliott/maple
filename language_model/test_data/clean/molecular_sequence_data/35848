By using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) we detected latent herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in human geniculate and trigeminal ganglia obtained from autopsy cases. A pair of primers which were specific for a part of the HSV-1 thymidine kinase domain were used for detection of HSV DNA. We also examined the latency-associated transcript (LAT), known as latency-specific RNA, by means of reverse transcription-PCR with a pair of LAT-specific primers. HSV-1 DNA was detected in 16 of 17 (94%) trigeminal ganglia and in 15 to 17 (88%) geniculate ganglia of adults. We also demonstrated HSV-1 RNA derived from the LAT in both types of ganglia. These findings suggest that HSV-1 latently infects the majority of geniculate and trigeminal ganglia of adults, and that PCR and reverse transcription-PCR are useful tools for analysis of HSV latency.
