Leuconostoc mesenteroides Y105 and L. mesenteroides FR52 produce both mesentericin Y105 and B105, in equal amounts. The mesentericin operons of L. mesenteroides FR52 and Y105 which are involved in mesentericin Y105 and B105 production, were both sequenced and compared. Differences were limited to the two genes, mesD and mesE, which encode the dedicated transport system of mesentericin Y105. Analysis of mesentericin non-producing mutants and complementation experiments demonstrated that the major role of the membrane fusion protein, MesE, was in bacteriocin secretion for both strains. Moreover, the secretion machinery MesDE was demonstrated to be capable of transportation and maturation of the two pre-bacteriocins, mesentericin Y105 and B105. We also demonstrate that although MesDEs from strains Y105 and FR52 have significant sequence differences, both transporters were capable of assuring secretion of either bacteriocin.
