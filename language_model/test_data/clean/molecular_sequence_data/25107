The nucleotide sequence of the RNA1 of Patchouli mild mosaic virus (PatMMV) has been determined. It contains 5,957 nucleotides excluding the 3'-terminal poly(A) tail and contains a single long open reading frame (ORF) of 5,613 nucleotides extending from nucleotide 235 to 5847. The predicted polyprotein encoded by the long ORF is 1,870 amino acids in length with a molecular weight of 210 kD. The conserved residues of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, cysteine protease, purine NTP-binding domain and a cofactor for viral protease are present in a 210-kD polyprotein. As PatMMV RNA showed high sequence identity (81-97%) with BBWV-2 RNA, PaMMV may be one strain of BBWV-2.
