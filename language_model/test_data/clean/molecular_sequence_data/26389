We studied antibody production in serial serum samples from patients with acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. Sera were analyzed both by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a synthetic peptide (P62) derived from the glycine-alanine repeating region of the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA-1) and by immunoblotting. In prior studies, we have shown that patients with acute EBV infection make IgM antibodies that react with this peptide, that recognize a viral-specific protein (EBNA-1), and that bind with a number of proteins present in uninfected cells; however, antibody binding to these autoantigens was inhibited by the peptide. IgG antibodies reactive with the peptide did not appear until months after the disease and were specific for the EBNA-1 protein. We now find that patients with acute CMV infection but not those with acute infections from a variety of other nonherpes organisms also produce IgM antibodies that recognize the EBV-derived peptide P62. These antibodies also appear to recognize the same cellular proteins as the EBV-induced IgM antibodies. The IgM antibodies appeared in all acutely infected CMV patients studied and occurred both in patients with previous EBV infections and in one patient studied who had not previously been exposed to EBV. It appears that infection with EBV or CMV can induce the synthesis of a very similar or identical set of IgM antibodies.
