Strain DCY14(T), a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped, non-motile bacterium, was isolated from soil from a ginseng field in Korea and was characterized in order to determine its taxonomic position. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain DCY14(T) belongs to the family Sphingobacteriaceae, the highest degree of sequence similarity being found with respect to Parapedobacter koreensis Jip14(T) (95.8 %). Chemotaxonomic data revealed that strain DCY14(T) possesses MK-7 as the major menaquinone. The major fatty acids present were anteiso-C(13 : 0), iso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH and summed feature 4 (C(16 : 1)omega7c/iso-C(15 : 0) 2-OH). The results of physiological and biochemical tests clearly demonstrated that strain DCY14(T) represents a distinct species. On the basis of these data, DCY14(T) represents a novel species of the genus Parapedobacter, for which the name Parapedobacter soli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is DCY14(T) (=KCTC 12984(T) =LMG 24069(T)).
