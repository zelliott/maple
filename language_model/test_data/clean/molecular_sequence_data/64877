The sequence of the Gyrodactylus salaris Malmberg, 1957, large subunit, or 28S, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene has been determined. This gene is the final portion of the Gyrodactylus rRNA gene operon to be sequenced and results in the first complete sequence of all rRNA genes and spacers from a monogenean. The nucleotide sequence was used to predict the secondary structure of the large subunit rRNA, and regions of conserved and variable sequence and structure were identified. The site where the 5' terminus of the 5.8S rRNA binds to a region within the large subunit rRNA was predicted and complements the anticipated interaction of the 3' terminus of the 5.8S with the 5' terminus of the large subunit rRNA. The large subunit gene may be useful in phylogenetic analysis of the Monogenea or Platyhelminthes and comparisons with other eukaryotes. The variable domains C and H may be most suitable for this purpose.
