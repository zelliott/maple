Oncogenic ras activates multiple signaling pathways to enforce cell proliferation in tumor cells. The ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is required for the transforming effects of ras, and its activation is often sufficient to convey mitogenic stimulation. However, in some settings oncogenic ras triggers a permanent cell cycle arrest with features of cellular senescence. How the Ras/ERK1/2 pathway activates different cellular programs is not well understood. Here we show that ERK1/2 localize predominantly in the cytoplasm during ras-induced senescence. This cytoplasmic localization seems to be dependent on an active nuclear export mechanism and can be rescued by the viral oncoprotein E1A. Consistent with this hypothesis, we showed that E1A dramatically down-regulated the expression of the ERK1/2 nuclear export factor PEA-15. Also, RNA interference against PEA-15 restored the nuclear localization of phospho-ERK1/2 in Ras-expressing primary murine embryo fibroblasts and stimulated their escape from senescence. Because senescence prevents the transforming effect of oncogenic ras, our results suggest a tumor suppressor function for PEA-15 that operates by means of controlling the localization of phospho-ERK1/2.
