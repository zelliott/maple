The interaction of the novel CCK analogs JMV-180, JMV-320, and JMV-332 with CCK-B/gastrin receptors on small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells was investigated. JMV-180, JMV-320, and JMV-332 potently inhibited specific binding of 125I-CCK-8 to CCK-B/gastrin receptors expressed on the SCLC cell line NCI-H345 (H345) with IC50 values of 4.9, 1.8, and 7.0 nM, respectively. JMV-320 and JMV-332 stimulated intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) release in a dose-dependent manner in cells preloaded with indo-1. JMV-180 did not stimulate [Ca2+]i but inhibited the [Ca2+]i release elicited by 10 nM CCK-8 in a dose-dependent manner. These data indicate that JMV-320 and JMV-332 function as CCK-B/gastrin receptor agonists while JMV-180 functions as a CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonist in H345 cells.
