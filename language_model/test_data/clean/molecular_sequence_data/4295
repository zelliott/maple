It has been reported previously that immunization with recombinant protein containing the two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like modules from merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) of Plasmodium yoelii (strain YM) protects mice against a lethal blood-stage challenge with the same parasite strain. Since MSP-1 is expressed in both liver- and blood-stage schizonts and on the surface of merozoites, we evaluated the effectiveness of immunization with recombinant proteins containing either the individual or the two combined EGF-like modules in producing a protective response against a sporozoite challenge. The recombinant protein expressing the combined EGF-like modules of the YM strain protected mice against a homologous sporozoite challenge, and sterile protection, as defined by the absence of detectable blood-stage parasites, was observed in the majority of the mice. In contrast, mice immunized with recombinant P. yoelii YM MSP-1 were not protected against a heterologous challenge with sporozoites from strain 265 BY of P. yoelii. The lack of protection may be explained by differences identified in the amino acid sequences of MSP-1 for the two strains. A recombinant protein containing the two EGF-like modules of MSP-1 from P. yoelii 265 BY was produced and used to immunize mice. These mice were protected against a homologous challenge with sporozoites of P. yoelii 265 BY. The results suggest that a recombinant MSP-1 has potential as a vaccine against malaria, but its efficacy may be limited by sequence polymorphism and selection of variants.
