Antibodies binding to conserved epitopes can provide a broad range of neutralization to existing influenza subtypes and may also prevent the propagation of potential pandemic viruses by fighting against emerging strands. Here we propose a computational framework to study structural binding patterns and detailed molecular mechanisms of viral surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) binding with a broad spectrum of neutralizing monoclonal antibody fragments (Fab). We used rigorous free-energy perturbation (FEP) methods to calculate the antigen-antibody binding affinities, with an aggregate underlying molecular-dynamics simulation time of several microseconds (∼2 μs) using all-atom, explicit-solvent models. We achieved a high accuracy in the validation of our FEP protocol against a series of known binding affinities for this complex system, with <0.5 kcal/mol errors on average. We then introduced what to our knowledge are novel mutations into the interfacial region to further study the binding mechanism. We found that the stacking interaction between Trp-21 in HA2 and Phe-55 in the CDR-H2 of Fab is crucial to the antibody-antigen association. A single mutation of either W21A or F55A can cause a binding affinity decrease of ΔΔG > 4.0 kcal/mol (equivalent to an ∼1000-fold increase in the dissociation constant K(d)). Moreover, for group 1 HA subtypes (which include both the H1N1 swine flu and the H5N1 bird flu), the relative binding affinities change only slightly (< ±1 kcal/mol) when nonpolar residues at the αA helix of HA mutate to conservative amino acids of similar size, which explains the broad neutralization capability of antibodies such as F10 and CR6261. Finally, we found that the hydrogen-bonding network between His-38 (in HA1) and Ser-30/Gln-64 (in Fab) is important for preserving the strong binding of Fab against group 1 HAs, whereas the lack of such hydrogen bonds with Asn-38 in most group 2 HAs may be responsible for the escape of antibody neutralization. These large-scale simulations may provide new insight into the antigen-antibody binding mechanism at the atomic level, which could be essential for designing more-effective vaccines for influenza.
