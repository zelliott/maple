Peptide diazomethyl ketones, well known as specific cysteine protease inhibitors are also potent inhibitors of the microbial serine proteases thermitase (EC 3.4.21.14) and subtilisin Carlsberg (EC 3.4.21.14). The affinity of the enzymes towards the synthetic inhibitors Z-Ala(n)-PheCHN2 (n = 0, 1, 2) depends on the chain length and is in the same range as for the corresponding chloromethyl ketones. Both kinds of inhibitors react irreversibly in a 1:1 ratio with the enzymes and covalently bind to the active site histidine of both subtilisin Carlsberg and thermitase despite the fact that thermitase contains an active-site cysteinyl residue. The mechanism of the inhibition reaction is discussed.
