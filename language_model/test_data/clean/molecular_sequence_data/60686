To fully characterize human glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)65 protein T-cell epitopes associated with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), CTL clones specific to GAD65 protein antigens were isolated from two congenital rubella syndrome (CRS)-associated IDDM patients. Overlapping nonamer T-cell epitopes recognized by both CD4+ or CD8+ CTL clones within peptides GAD65(252-266) and GAD65(274-286) were identified as sequences bounded by GAD65(255-266) with 6/9 overlapping residues, and GAD65(276-285) with 8/9 overlapping residues, respectively, using two panels of overlapping peptide analogs in cytotoxicity assays. HLA restrictive elements of the T-cell clones were also identified using a panel of B cell lines with different HLA phenotypes as targets in cytotoxicity assays. The antigenic GAD65 peptides elicited cytotoxic responses of peptide-specific CD4+ T-cell clones in the context of HLA DRB1*0404. The CD8+ T-cell clone specific to GAD65(255-263) was found to be restricted by HLA A3 and A11. Similarly, the CD8+ T-cell clone specific to GAD65(277-285) killed peptide-sensitized target cells expressing HLA B35 and B15. The observed HLA restriction of these overlapping epitopes implies that a tandem of [DRB1*0404-A11(3)] and/or a tandem of [DRB1*0404-B35(15)] might predispose CRS patients to development of IDDM.
