Although triacylglycerol (TAG) stores play a critical role in organisms, mechanisms underlying TAG synthesis are poorly understood in invertebrates. In mammals, the synthesis of glycerolipids, including TAG, diacylglycerol (DAG) and phospholipids (PL), occurs predominantly by the glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) pathway in most cell types, except for in enterocytes. In these cells, the monoacylglycerol (MAG) pathway accounts for the majority of glycerolipid production. The insect Rhodnius prolixus, a vector of Chagas' disease, exhibits a high capacity to produce glycerolipids in the midgut after a blood meal, providing substrates that are transferred to other organs, such as the fat body, which is specialized in TAG production and storage. In this report, the genes required for TAG synthesis were identified in the R. prolixus genome. The genomic data indicated that TAG is synthesized by the G3P pathway, which is the sole pathway for TAG synthesis in this organism. Furthermore, transcription of both the RpGpat and RpDgat genes were upregulated in a diverse number of organs at moments of highest lipid production. In the midgut and fat body, in vitro synthesis of glycerolipids required G3P, but not MAG, as the initial substrate. These results indicate that the G3P pathway is the only route for TAG synthesis in R. prolixus, and its regulation at the transcriptional level can be a determinant of glycerolipid synthesis and TAG formation in insect organs.
