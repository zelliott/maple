Rck2p is a Hog1p-MAP kinase-activated protein kinase and regulates osmotic and oxidative stresses in budding yeast. In this study, we have demonstrated in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and, the most medically important human fungal pathogen, Candida albicans that deletion of RCK2 renders cells sensitive to rapamycin, the inhibitor of target of rapamycin protein kinase controlling cell growth. The kinase activity of Rck2p does not seem to be required for this rapamycin sensitivity function in both eukaryotic microorganisms. Interestingly, the HOG pathway is not directly involved in cell sensitivity to rapamycin in S. cerevisiae, whereas disruption of CaHOG1 renders cells sensitive to rapamycin in C. albicans. In addition, we have shown that CaRck2p and its kinase activity are required for cell growth in C. albicans.
