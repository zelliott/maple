Here, we show that fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) induces proliferation of H-510 and H-69 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells. However, the optimal response to FGF-2 was obtained at 10-fold lower concentrations in H-510 cells. This correlated with the selective activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) pathway in H-510, but not H-69 cells. Moreover, inhibition of MEK with PD098059 blocked FGF-2-induced proliferation in H-510 cells only. Similarly, ribosomal protein S6 kinase 2 (S6K2), a recently identified homologue of S6K1 was activated by FGF-2 in H-510, but not H-69 cells. This activation was independent of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, but was sensitive to inhibition of the MEK pathway. These data suggest that S6K2 is a novel downstream target of MEK. The potency of FGF-2 in H-510 cells might reflect this additional MEK/S6K2 signalling. In contrast to S6K2, S6K1 was activated in both SCLC cell lines. Inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin with 10 ng/ml rapamycin blocked S6K1 activation and proliferation of both lines. However, even at 100 ng/ml, rapamycin only partially inhibited S6K2. Strikingly, this correlated with inhibition of MEK signalling. Our data indicate that S6K1, and possibly S6K2, are involved in FGF-2-induced SCLC cell growth, a notion supported by the overexpression and higher baseline activity of both isoforms in SCLC lines, as compared to normal human type-II pneumocytes.
