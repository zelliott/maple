The amyloid beta precursor protein can exist as both a membrane-bound and a secreted protein, with the former having the potential to generate the amyloid beta peptide present in the neuritic plaques which are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we have used a clone of the AtT20 mouse pituitary cell line which expresses high levels of the amyloid beta precursor protein to characterize the glycosylation state of the secreted and membrane-bound forms of the protein and to examine the role of post-translational modifications in protein processing. Lectin blot analysis of immunoprecipitated amyloid beta precursor protein demonstrated that the soluble form of the protein contains significant amounts of sialic acid, with the lectin staining being reduced in the particulate cellular fractions. Treatment of the cells with mannosidase inhibitors to interfere with the formation of complex-type N-linked glycans resulted in a decrease in secreted amyloid beta precursor protein and an increase in the level of the cellular form of the protein. The increase in amyloid beta precursor protein levels in the cellular fraction was accompanied by an increase in perinuclear staining. Furthermore, cells overexpressing the alpha2,6(N)-sialyltransferase enzyme also demonstrated an increase in amyloid beta precursor protein secretion. These results suggest that the presence of terminal sialic acid residues on complex-type N-glycans may be required for the optimal transport of the amyloid beta precursor protein from the Golgi to the cell membrane with the subsequent cleavage to generate the secreted form of the protein.
