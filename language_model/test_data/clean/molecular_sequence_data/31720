Two novel glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 12 xyloglucanase genes (designated RmXEG12A and RmXEG12B) were cloned from the thermophilic fungus Rhizomucor miehei. Both genes contained open reading frames of 729 bp encoding 242 amino acids. Their deduced amino acid sequences shared 68% identity with each other and less than 60% with other xyloglucanases. The two genes, without the sequences for the signal peptides, were cloned and successfully expressed in Escherichia coli as active xyloglucanases, designated RmXEG12A and RmXEG12B, with similar molecular masses--25.6 and 25.9 kDa, respectively. RmXEG12A showed optimal activity at pH 6.5 and 65 °C, RmXEG12B at pH 5.0 and 60 °C. Both recombinant xyloglucanases displayed very high specific activities, 6,681.4 and 3,092.2 U mg(-1), respectively, toward tamarind xyloglucan, but no activity toward carboxymethylcellulose, Avicel, or p-nitrophenyl derivatives. The main products of tamarind xyloglucan hydrolysis by the two xyloglucanases were XXXG, XXLG/XLXG, and XLLG (where G is an unsubstituted β-D-Glc residue, X is a xylosylated β-D-Glc residue, and L is a β-D-Glc residue substituted by xylosyl-galactose).
