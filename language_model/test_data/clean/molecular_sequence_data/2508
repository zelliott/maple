Expression of the gene encoding preproglucagon gives rise to different glucagon-related peptides in the pancreas and intestine. Glucagon gene expression is regulated by a protein kinase C-dependent pathway in rat islet cell lines, whereas activation of the adenylate cyclase pathway in islet cell lines is without effect. To elucidate the factors important for the control of proglucagon biosynthesis in the intestine, we have studied proglucagon gene expression and proglucagon biosynthesis in rat intestine. Analysis of intestinal cDNA clones encoding preproglucagon indicated that pancreatic and intestinal glucagon mRNA transcripts were identical. The regulation of proglucagon gene expression in rat intestine differed markedly from that previously observed in islet cell lines. Phorbol esters increased the secretion of glucagon-like immunoreactive peptides (GLI) but had no effect on proglucagon mRNA levels in rat intestinal cells. Bombesin also increased the secretion of GLI without affecting proglucagon mRNA levels or biosynthesis. In contrast, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, forskolin, and cholera toxin increased both proglucagon mRNA levels and GLI biosynthesis and secretion, suggesting that proglucagon gene expression in the intestine is regulated by a cyclic AMP-dependent pathway. These observations suggest that tissue-specific differences in both the regulation of proglucagon gene expression and the posttranslational processing of proglucagon contribute to the diversity of glucagon gene expression.
