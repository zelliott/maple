Mammalian cytochrome c oxidase consists of thirteen subunits, ten encoded by the nuclear genome and three by the mitochondrial DNA. In several species, two isoforms have been isolated for nuclear-encoded subunits VIa, VIIa and VIII: an ubiquitous L (liver) form and a heart- and skeletal-muscle specific H form. The gene for murine cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIIa-L (Cox7aL) and its promoter region were isolated, sequenced and analysed. The coding region is split in four exons spanning 4.1 kbp and the promoter carries potential binding sites for Sp1, NRF1 and NRF2 transcription factors. Transcriptional activity of the promoter in reporter assays suggested an ubiquitous expression in mouse tissues.
