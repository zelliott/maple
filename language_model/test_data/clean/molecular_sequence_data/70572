Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification and cloning of cDNA encoding the chicken CLIP-170(11) isoform of the Cytoplasmic Linker Protein 170 gene revealed an unusual source of protein sequence variation. In addition to differential combinatorial splicing of two cassette exons to yield four CLIP-170 protein isoforms, we found differential usage of alternative 5'-splice junctions in a single exon. Splicing at the downstream site yields message containing 18 bp of nucleotide sequence that is missing from message spliced at the more 5' site. This 18 bp sequence encodes a segment of 6 amino acids that fills a gap in the alignment of chicken and human CLIP-170 homologue sequences. Differential usage of the 5'-splice junctions in this complex exon appears to be tissue- rather than isoform-specific.
