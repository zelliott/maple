As part of a program to determine the genetic diversity of human immunodeficiency virus in rural Kenya, we carried out a molecular analysis of the C2-V3 region of HIV-infected blood samples obtained from 30 antenatal clinic attendees of seven health centers in western Kenya. Direct sequencing was carried out on the envelope C2-V3 region of proviral DNA. On phylogenetic analysis with reference strains, 20 were subtype Al, 2 were subtype D, 1 was subtype C, 1 was subtype G, 1 was CRF-10, 2A/D, 2A/C, and 2 were unclassified. The presence of CRF-10 and the great variety of subtypes and recombinants in such a limited sample size suggest that western Kenya may be a potential hotspot for HIV recombination in the country.
