A derivatization method, adapted from that of Angel et al. (ref. 10), for sequencing sugar residues in partially degraded poly- and oligo-saccharides using positive-ion f.a.b.-m.s. is described. Derivative selection provides sequence information by directing fragmentation exclusively to both sides of glycosidic oxygen atoms and, in the case of opened rings, between glycosidic carbon and ring oxygen atoms. Polysaccharides or oligosaccharides are subjected to sequential periodate oxidation, borodeuteride reduction, and acetylation. The derivatized polysaccharides are then subjected to partial degradation, acetylation, and high-performance liquid chromatography (h.p.l.c.) purification. F.a.b.-m.s. data obtained on model compounds, using 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol as matrix for f.a.b.-m.s., demonstrated direction of fragmentation to both sides of the glycosidic oxygen atom in unoxidized residues, and to both sides of the acetal oxygen atoms in oxidized residues. Oligosaccharide linkage and sequence may thus be determined by observing fragmentation from both the reducing and non-reducing ends of the molecule. Two Salmonella lipopolysaccharides, derivatized by this procedure, were partially hydrolyzed and then acetylated. Analysis of the h.p.l.c.-purified oligosaccharide derivatives by f.a.b.-m.s. demonstrated the applicability of the technique for sequencing nmol quantities of branched structures.
