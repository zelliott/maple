D21S112 is a highly polymorphic marker on the long arm of chromosome 21. Our analysis of this locus indicated the presence of three VNTR systems. We estimated the heterozygosity of each system and sequenced one of the repetitive regions. Utilizing PCR, we demonstrated that the sequenced VNTR is responsible for the system with the highest level of heterozygosity. Combining data from the three systems makes D21S112 one of the most informative loci on the chromosome.
