To contribute to the identification and analysis of novel genes, we undertook the study of a cosmid clone in the Xq27 region of human DNA. The cloned fragment was previously observed to have a high number of evolutionarily conserved sequences. In this genomic stretch of DNA we have identified sequence homologous to the U7 RNA gene including its potential regulatory elements. This paper describes the genomic organisation of this gene and its mapping to the Xq27.1 genomic sub-interval between the DXS1232 and DXS119 loci.
