The surface (S)-layer protein of Lactobacillus brevis was isolated, purified, and characterized. The S-layer protein is the major protein of the cell, with an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Immunogold electron microscopy with polyclonal antiserum against the isolated 46-kDa protein was used to confirm the surface location of this protein. N-terminal amino acid sequences of the intact 46-kDa protein and its tryptic peptides were determined. The gene of the S-layer protein was amplified from the genome of L. brevis by polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotides, synthesized according to the N-terminal amino acid sequences, as primers. The polymerase chain reaction fragments containing the entire S-layer gene and its regulatory regions were sequenced. Nucleic acid sequence analysis revealed one open reading frame with a capacity to encode a protein of 48,159 Da. From the regulatory region of the gene, two subsequent promoters and a ribosome binding site, showing typical features of prokaryotic consensus sequences, were found. The coding region contained a characteristic gram-positive-type signal peptide of 30 amino acids. Removal of the signal peptide results in a polypeptide of 435 amino acids, which is in excellent agreement with the size of the S-layer protein determined by SDS-PAGE. The size and the 5' end analyses of the S-layer transcripts confirmed the monocistronic nature of the S-layer operon and the functionality of the two promoters found.
