A transposon, Tn4556, has recently been isolated from Streptomyces fradiae (S.-T. Chung, J. Bacteriol. 169:4436-4441, 1987). The ends of Tn4556 were found to contain inverted repeats of 38 base pairs with 70% sequence identity with the ends of Tn3. Insertion of Tn4556 into a Streptomyces plasmid resulted in a 5-base-pair duplication of the target site.
