To investigate the role of two highly conserved negative patches, residues #42-45 and #59-61, on the surface of plant plastocyanin, six mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of the intermediate precursor gene from Silene pratensis. The mutants were designed systematically to incorporate positive charges into the negative patches, and the net charge on negative patches was modified from -4 to +1. Upon expression in Escherichia coli, the mutant proteins were correctly processed to the mature size and accumulated as holo-proteins. Absorption spectra, EPR, and redox potentials of the purified mutant proteins were almost indistinguishable from those of the wild-type. It was found that the electron transfer rate from cytochrome f to plastocyanin decreased exponentially as the net charge on the negative patch (#42-45) was increased, whereas the modification of the other negative patch (#59-61) had no effect. Ionic strength dependence studies indicated that the rate constants at infinite ionic strength did not change significantly among the wild-type and the six mutants, and the electrostatic attraction energies between plastocyanin and cytochrome f decreased when residues #42-45 were modified, whereas the modification of residues #59-61 had no effect. These results clearly indicated that only one (#42-45) of the two negative patches is involved in the transient complex formation with cytochrome f. Essentially similar results were observed for the electron transfer from plastocyanin to the photosystem I reaction center (P700), although in this case, slight participation of the negative patch (#59-61) is suggested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
