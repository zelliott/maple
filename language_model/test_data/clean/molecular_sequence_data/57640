The DnaK protein of Zymomonas mobilis (DnaKz) was identified and found to be 80% identical to the DnaK protein of Escherichia coli on the basis of the sequence of the N-terminal 21 amino acids. The dnaKz gene was cloned and found to be expressed in a thermosensitive dnaK mutant of Escherichia coli. Expression of the foreign gene restored a thermoresistant phenotype but failed to modulate the heat shock response in E. coli.
