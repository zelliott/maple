Here, we present the draft genome sequence of "Candidatus Nitrosoarchaeum limnia" BG20, an ammonia-oxidizing archaeon enriched in culture from low-salinity sediments of the San Francisco Bay estuary. The genome sequence revealed many similarities to the previously sequenced genome of "Ca. Nitrosoarchaeum limnia" SFB1 (enriched from a nearby site in San Francisco Bay) and is representative of a clade of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) found in low-salinity habitats worldwide.
