The Shaker type voltage-gated potassium (K+) channel consists of four pore-forming Kv alpha subunits. The channel expression and kinetic properties can be modulated by auxiliary hydrophilic Kv beta subunits via formation of heteromultimeric Kv alpha-Kv beta complexes. Because each (Kv alpha)4 could recruit more than one Kv beta subunit and different Kv beta subunits could potentially interact, the stoichiometry of alpha-beta and beta-beta complexes is therefore critical for understanding the functional regulation of Shaker type potassium channels. We expressed and purified Kv beta 2 subunit in Sf9 insect cells. The purified Kv beta 2, examined by atomic force and electron microscopy techniques, is found predominately as a square-shaped tetrameric complex with side dimensions of 100 x 100 A2 and height of 51 A. Thus, Kv beta 2 is capable of forming a tetramer in the absence of pore-forming alpha subunits. The center of the Kv beta 2 complex was observed to be the most heavily stained region, suggesting that this region could be part of an extended tubular structure connecting the inner mouth of the ion permeation pathway to the cytoplasmic environment.
