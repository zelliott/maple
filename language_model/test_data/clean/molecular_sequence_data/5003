Degradation of protein antigens by cellular proteases is a crucial step in the initiation of a T-cell-mediated immune response. But still little is known about the enzymes responsible for the processing of antigens, including their specificity. In this paper, we show that the combination of automated N-terminal sequencing with a newly developed method for C-terminal sequencing of peptide pools generated by the aspartic proteases cathepsins D and E is a fast and easy method to obtain detailed information of the substrate specificity of these endopeptidases. Using a 15-residue synthetic peptide library and a native protein as substrates, we confirm and extend the knowledge about the cleavage motif of cathepsin E where positions P1 and P1' of the substrate must be occupied exclusively by hydrophobic amino acids with aromatic or aliphatic side chains. However, Val and Ile residues are not allowed at position P1. Position P2' accepts a broad range of amino acids, including charged and polar ones. Additional requirements concerning the substrate positions P3' and P4' were also defined by pool sequencing. Furthermore, pool sequencing analysis of melittin digests with the aspartic proteases cathepsin D and E provided evidence that both enzymes share the same cleavage motif, identical to the one derived from the peptide library and the native protein. Therefore, pool sequencing analysis is a valuable and fast tool to determine the substrate specificity of any endopeptidase.
