Insect C-type lectins function as pattern recognition receptors in innate immunity. In the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta, we have previously isolated three C-type lectins named immulectins, which are involved in innate immune responses. Here, we report a new member of the immulectin family, immulectin-4 (IML-4). IML-4 mRNA was detected in the fat body of control larvae and was induced in the fat body when larvae were injected with bacteria. Recombinant IML-4 bound to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and the binding activity was not affected by addition of calcium or EGTA. IML-4 agglutinated bacteria and yeast, and agglutination of Escherichia coli by IML-4 was concentration- and calcium-dependent. IML-4 also enhanced haemocyte encapsulation and melanization.
