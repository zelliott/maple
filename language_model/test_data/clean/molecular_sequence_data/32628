Early B cell factor (EBF)-1 is a transcription factor known to be of critical importance for early B lymphocyte development. EBF-1 has been shown to directly interact with and regulate expression of a set of genes involved in the functional formation of the pre-B cell receptor, but the dramatic phenotype observed in the EBF-1-deficient mice suggests that several additional genes are activated by this protein. In order to identify additional target genes for EBF-1, we transduced a hematopoietic progenitor cell line, BaF/3, with an EBF-1-encoding retrovirus and investigated the induced gene expression pattern by micro-arrays. This analysis suggested that among others, the CD53 and the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM)-1 genes both were induced by ectopic expression of EBF-1. Identification of the 5' end of the cDNA enabled the identification of promoter elements with functional binding sites for EBF-1 and ability to respond to EBF-1 expression in transient transfection assays. These data suggest that CD53 and CEACAM-1 are direct genetic targets for EBF-1, providing additional information concerning the activity of this crucial transcription factor in hematopoiesis.
