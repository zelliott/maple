The G0S19 genes are members of the "small inducible" family of genes, which have similar exon-intron organizations and encode secreted proteins with similar dispositions of cysteine and proline residues. G0S19-1 mRNA is increased shortly after the addition of lectin or cycloheximide to cultured human blood mononuclear cells. The cDNA sequence is homologous to that of a murine gene encoding an inhibitory cytokine (MIP1 alpha/SCI), which decreases hemopoietic stem cell proliferation. The homology extends to the 3' noncoding region, which contains two conserved elements: (i) GGGACTCTTC, a potential transcription factor NF chi B-binding site, and (ii) TTTTGTAATTTATTTT, which is found in some related genes (e.g., that encoding the immediate early protein ornithine decarboxylase). A similar but complementary sequence is present in human immunodeficiency virus. Two of the three human genes that hybridize to G0S19-1 cDNA were sequenced. G0S19-1 has 5' AP1-like recognition elements as found in some other phorbol ester-responsive genes (e.g., c-fos). G0S19-2 has a 5' Alu sequence, but is likely to be expressed because of the conservation of sections of the gene believed to be important for function. The 5' flanks of both genes contain the nucleotide motifs CK-2 and SRE, indicating cytokine-like genes with the potential to respond to growth factors. G0S19-1 is the main G0S19 gene expressed in adult T lymphocytes and may encode a homeostatic negative regulator of the size of cell populations (or subpopulations) which are derived ultimately from marrow stem cells. As such, it is a potential antioncogene.
