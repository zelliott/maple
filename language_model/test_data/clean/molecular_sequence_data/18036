Six different glycosyltransferases that are active with glycosphingolipid substrates have been purified from Golgi-membranes after solubilization with detergents. It appears that GalT-4(UDP-Gal:GlcNAc-R1 beta 1-4GalT), GalNAcT-2(UDP-Gal:Gal alpha-R2 beta 1-3GalNAcT) and FucT-2(GDP-Fuc:Gal beta GlcNAc-R3 alpha 1-2FucT) are specific for oligosaccharides bound to ceramide or to a protein moiety. These are called CARS (carbohydrate recognition sites) glycosyltransferases (GLTs). On the other hand, GalT-3(UDP-Gal:GM2 beta 1-3GalT), GalNAcT-1(UDP-GalNAc:GM3 beta 1-4GalNAcT) and FucT-3 (GDP-Fuc:LM1 alpha 1-3FucT) recognize both hydrophobic moieties (fatty acid of ceramide) as well as the oligosaccharide chains of the substrates. These GLTs are called HY-CARS (hydrophobic and carbohydrate recognition sites). D-Erythro-sphingosine (100-500 microM) modulates the in vitro activities of these GLTs. Modulation depends on the binding of D-sphingosine to a protein backbone, perhaps on more than one site and beyond transmembrane hydrophobic domains. Control of GLTs by free D-sphingosine was suggested with the concomitant discovery of ceramide glycanase in rabbit mammary tissues. The role of free sphingosine as an in vivo homotropic modulator of glycosyltransferases is becoming apparent.
