Calbindin D28K, a member of the troponin-C superfamily of calcium-binding proteins, contains six putative EF-hand domains. Calcium-binding studies of the protein by different groups of investigators have yielded discordant results with respect to the stoichiometry of calcium-binding. It has been suggested that the protein binds anywhere from 3-6 mol of calcium/mol of protein. We used negative ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in order to definitively determine the exact calcium-binding stoichiometry of calbindin D28K and two mutant forms of the protein, one lacking EF-hand 2 (delta2) and the other lacking EF-hands 2 and 6 (delta2,6). The full-length protein bound 4 mol of calcium/mol of protein, while both of the deletion mutants bound 3 mol of calcium. Since terbium has been used extensively as a probe for the determination of the calcium-binding stoichiometries of calcium-binding proteins, we also examined the binding of terbium to the three proteins under the same conditions. Full-length calbindin D28K bound 4 mol of terbium/mol of protein, while calbindin delta2 and delta2,6 each bound 3 mol. These results clearly show that calbindin D28K binds 4 mol of calcium/mol of protein and that terbium-binding stoichiometry is similar to that of calcium.
