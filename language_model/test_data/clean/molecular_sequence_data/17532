It is generally held that one of the recessive genes controlling diabetes in the NOD mouse is linked to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Unique substitution of Asp57 with Ser in the A beta chain is considered to make the A beta gene the MHC-linked susceptibility gene. We therefore analysed the nucleotide sequences of the A beta second exon in ILI, CTS, and NON mice, which are nondiabetic inbred strains but are derived from the same Jcl-ICR mice as the NOD mouse. The DNA sequence analyses revealed that the A beta second exon sequences in the ILI and CTS mice, but not in the NON mouse, are identical to that of the NOD mouse. Possible roles of Ser57 of the A beta chain in the nondiabetic sister strains are discussed.
