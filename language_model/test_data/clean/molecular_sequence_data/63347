Recently, several polydnavirus (PDV) genomes have been completely sequenced. The dsDNA circles enclosed in virus particles and injected by wasps into caterpillars appear to mainly encode virulence factors potentially involved in altering host immunity and/or development, thereby allowing the survival of the parasitoid larvae within the host tissues. Parasitoid wasps generally inject virulence factors produced in the venom gland. As PDV genomes are inherited vertically by wasps through a proviral form, wasp virulence genes may have been transferred to this chromosomal form, leading to their incorporation into virus particles. Indeed, many gene products from Cotesia congregata bracovirus (CcBV), such as PTPs, IkappaB-like, and cystatins, contain protein domains conserved in metazoans. Surprisingly however, CcBV virulence gene products are not more closely related to insect proteins than to human proteins. To determine whether the distance between CcBV and insect proteins is a specific feature of BV proteins or simply reflects a general high divergence of parasitoid wasp products, which might be due to parasitic lifestyle, we have analyzed the sequences of wasp genes obtained from a cDNA library. Wasp sequences having a high similarity with Apis mellifera genes involved in a variety of biological functions could be identified indicating that the high level of divergence observed for BV products is a hallmark of these viral proteins. We discuss how this divergence might be explained in the context of the current hypotheses on the origin and evolution of wasp-bracovirus associations.
