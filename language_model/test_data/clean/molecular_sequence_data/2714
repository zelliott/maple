Nucleotide sequences of two 5S rRNA genes located in repeated 327 bp long units were determined in diploid wheat Triticum monococcum. They were compared with sequences of 5S rRNA genes of Tr. monococcum and Tr. aestivum which were earlier determined. The differences were revealed in two localizations of the nucleotide sequence in 5S DNA coding regions of Tr. monococcum and - in nine localizations in nontranscribed spacer. It was established that the nucleotide sequence of 5S rRNA gene cloned in pTm5S9 plasmid and 5S DNA coding region in Tr. aestivum have significant homology. Diploid wheat Tr. monococcum was supposed to have 5S rRNA genes with different functional activity within one multigene family.
