Two clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, TL-1 and TL-2, were isolated from a patient transferred from Bangladesh and hospitalized for osteomyelitis in Paris, France. P. aeruginosa TL-1 expressed the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase VEB-1a and was susceptible only to imipenem and colistin, while P. aeruginosa TL-2 expressed only the naturally occurring bla(AmpC) gene at a basal level and exhibited a wild-type beta-lactam resistance phenotype. In TL-1, the typical 5'-end conserved sequence (5'-CS) region of class 1 integrons usually present upstream of the bla(VEB-1a) gene was replaced by a truncated 3'-CS and a 135-bp repeated element (Re). Downstream of the bla(VEB-1a) gene, an insertion sequence, ISPa31 disrupted by ISPa30, and an orf513 sequence, belonging to a common region (conserved region 1 [CR1]) immediately upstream of the aphA-6 gene, were present. Further downstream, a second truncated 3'-CS region in direct repeat belonged to In51, an integron containing two gene cassettes (aadA6 and the OrfD cassette). Thus, the overall structure corresponded to a sul-type class 1 integron termed In121. Genetic analyses revealed that both isolates were clonally related and differed by a ca. 100-kb fragment that contained In121. Both isolates contained another integron, In122, that carried three gene cassettes: aadB, dfrA1, and the OrfX cassette. This work identifies for the first time the spread of Re-associated bla(VEB) genes located on a sul-type integron. It also reports for the first time a CR1 element in P. aeruginosa that is associated with an aminoglycoside resistance aphA-6 gene that is expressed from a composite promoter.
