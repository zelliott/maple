The hydrolysis of peptide-amides in the solid state at 4 degrees due to the presence of residual strong acid was investigated. It was found that even small molar excesses of these acids cause substantial deamidation in one day. The degree of amide hydrolysis depends not only upon the pKa and the volatility of the acid, but also upon the accessibility of the amide function; peptides with bulky C-terminal residues are more stable than the less-hindered ones.
