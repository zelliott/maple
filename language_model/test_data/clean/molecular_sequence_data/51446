The APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) gene is responsible for familial adenomatous polyposis and is also associated with the development of sporadic tumors of the colon and stomach. To investigate whether or not mutations of APC play any role in tumors arising in other organs, we examined somatic mutations of this gene in sporadic (nonfamilial) renal cell carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and cancers of the lung and pancreas. DNAs isolated from tumors were examined by means of a RNase protection analysis, coupled with the polymerase chain reaction followed by DNA sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction products. By screening a part of the APC coding region, we detected somatic mutations in four of ten pancreatic cancers; each of these mutations would yield a truncated APC product due to a 1- or 5-base pair deletion. These results imply that mutations in APC contribute to carcinogenesis in the pancreas.
