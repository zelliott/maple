We here report the genomic organisation of the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) MHC class II DQ and DR region based on BAC clone analysis. The sequenced Mimu-MHC haplotype spans 343Â kb and encompasses the genes TAP2, DOB, DQB, DQA, DRB, DRA, BTNL2 and a further BTNL gene. The DQ and DR genes of this haplotype are not duplicated. Mimu-DOB is not transcribed and represents a pseudogene due to deletions and premature stop codons. Analysis of BAC clone DNA, a cDNA sample and eight genomic DNA samples suggests that Mimu-DRB, Mimu-DQA and Mimu-DQB are highly polymorphic with the majority of peptide-binding residues being affected by polymorphisms. In contrast, Mimu-DRA is moderately polymorphic, and the variable amino acid positions are not part of the peptide-binding region. Phylogenetic analysis of Mimu-DQA and Mimu-DQB and other primate DQA and DQB genes indicates that duplication of DQA and DQB loci occurred in Anthropoidea after the split from Strepsirrhini.
