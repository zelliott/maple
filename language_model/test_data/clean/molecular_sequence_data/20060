Rice microarray analysis showed that a number of stress-related genes are induced by external addition of L-ascorbic acid (AsA). The gene designated as AK073843 which is homologous to class capital SHA, Cyrillic chitinase was found to exhibit the highest induction among these genes. However, its crucial residues within the chitinase active site are substituted with other residues, suggesting that the protein has no chitinase activity. The recombinant protein which is encoded by the AK073843 gene produced in Escherichia coli has xylanase inhibitor activity, indicating that the gene encodes a novel rice XIP-type xylanase inhibitor protein (OsXIP). The expression of OsXIP was enhanced not only by exogenous AsA treatment but also by various stresses such as citrate and sodium chloride treatments, and wounding; however, it was not influenced by increasing endogenous AsA content. External AsA treatment caused a significant increase in electrolyte leakage from rice root. These results suggested that OsXIP was induced by stress which is caused by external AsA treatment. Rice XIP-family genes, OsXIP, riceXIP and RIXI, showed differential organ-specific expression. Also, these genes were differentially induced by stress and stress-related phytohormones. The transcripts of OsXIP and riceXIP were undetectable under normal conditions, and were drastically induced by wounding and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment in the root. RIXI was constitutively expressed in the shoot but not induced by wounding and stress-related phytohormones. Thus, XIP-type xylanase inhibitors were suggested to be specialized in their function and involved in defense mechanisms in rice.
