The effect of binding of an antitumour drug cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cis-[Pt(NH3)2Cl2]) to DNA on cutting effectiveness of BamHI, EcoRI, and SalI restriction endonucleases was quantitatively determined. The platinum complex inhibits the cleavage of plasmid pHC624 DNA linearized by BglI restrictase. From the present results we conclude that the yield of restriction endonuclease cleavage is also lowered if the platinum complex is bound outside the recognition DNA sequence of these enzymes. We propose that the origin of platinum adducts on DNA outside the recognition sequence can decrease the yield of restriction enzyme cleavage via inducing a conformational perturbation in the recognition DNA sequence of these enzymes and also via inhibition of the linear diffusion of these enzymes on DNA.
