The nucleotide sequence of the Bacillus subtilis 168 chromosomal segment located between yvhJ (307 degrees) and secA (305 degrees) was determined. This 20.3 kb region encompasses 23 ORFs, 17 of which have been sequenced previously. Comparison of sequences obtained here with the previously obtained ones revealed seven discrepancies. The products of the sequenced genes are involved in the regulation of degradative enzymes, competence, flagellar motility and protein secretion. Putative functions of newly identified genes are based on sequence homologies.
