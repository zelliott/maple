Interleukin-HP1 (HP1) is a murine T cell-derived lymphokine, originally described as a growth factor for B cell hybridomas and plasmacytomas, that was recently shown to stimulate growth and differentiation of normal B and T lymphocytes. Here, we describe a cDNA for HP1 that was isolated from a library prepared using mRNA of a murine helper T cell clone activated with a clonotypic antibody. The cDNA, which hybridizes with a mRNA of approximately 1300 bp, encodes a polypeptide consisting of 211 amino acids with a typical signal sequence of 24 residues followed by 187 amino acids, which form the mature protein (Mr = 21,710). No N-glycosylation site but several potential O-glycosylation sites were identified in the predicted sequence. Comparison of the cDNA sequence of HP1 with that of human interleukin 6 disclosed a homology of 65% at the DNA level and of 42% at the protein level with a maximum of 57% for the segment spanning residues 42-102 of mature HP1. Considering the functional homology that was previously established between these two proteins, we therefore propose that HP1 be renamed murine interleukin 6.
