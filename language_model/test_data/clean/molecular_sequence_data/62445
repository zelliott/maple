A DNA fragment, carrying the Candida utilis HIS3 gene, has been isolated from a genomic DNA library by complementation of the E. coli hisB mutant. Its nucleotide sequence was determined and it predicts a single open reading frame of 675 bp (224 aa). The deduced amino acid sequence is highly homologous to other yeast and fungi HIS3 genes.
