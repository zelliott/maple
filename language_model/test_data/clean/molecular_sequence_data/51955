The APO-1 (APT) antigen is a cell surface antigen expressed on a variety of normal and malignant cells. Binding of anti-APO-1 antibody to the APO-1 antigen induces programmed cell death (apoptosis). The APO-1 antigen shows homology to the members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor/nerve growth factor receptor superfamily. Using cosmid DNA containing the APO-1 gene as a probe for fluorescence in situ hybridization, we have mapped the gene to a subregion of chromosomal band 10q23. The human APO-1 locus lies within a conserved synteny segment present on mouse chromosome 19 consistent with the previous chromosomal assignment of the corresponding mouse antigen.
