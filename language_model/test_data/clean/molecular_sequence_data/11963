Complementary DNA encoding the putative mouse homologue for human acrosomal protein SP-10, a candidate contraceptive vaccinogen, was cloned and sequenced. The entire open reading frame (amino acids 18 to 261) of the mouse SP-10 (mSP-10), with the exception of the signal peptide (amino acids 1 to 17), was placed under the influence of inducible T7 RNA polymerase/promoter system to overproduce recombinant protein (re-mSP-10) in Escherichia coli. A six-histidine tag, which was coexpressed at the carboxyl terminus of re-mSP-10, provided the means for purification of re-mSP-10 by immobilized metal chelation affinity chromatography technique. The level of purity of re-mSP-10 thus obtained was determined by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis to be 98%. Immunoblotting with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies previously generated against human or baboon SP-10 showed that mSP-10 shared significant antigenic similarity with its primate counterparts. The position of mSP-10 in the mouse genome was next mapped through segregation analysis of an interspecific backcross panel of 96 animals. Acrv1 (assigned gene symbol for mSP-10) was localized in the proximal portion of mouse chromosome 9 in a region that exhibits synteny with human 11q23, the region to which ACRV1 (gene symbol for human SP-10) was previously mapped. These characterizations by combined immunological and gene mapping techniques established the cloned mSP-10 to be the mouse homologue of SP-10.
