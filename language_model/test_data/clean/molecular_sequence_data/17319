An orthologue to the mammalian epithelial calcium channels, ECaC1 (TRPV5) and ECaC2 (TRPV6), was cloned from gill of pufferfish (Fugu rubripes) and characterised, demonstrating that this gene predates the evolution of land-living vertebrates. The F. rubripes ECaC (FrECaC) protein displays all structural features typical for mammalian ECaCs including three ankyrin repeats, six transmembrane domains, and a putative pore region between TM V and TM VI. Functional expression of FrECaC in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells confirmed that the channel mediates Ca(2+) influx. FrECaC was also permeable to Zn(2+) and, to a small extent, to the Fe(2+) ion. Thus, in addition to a role in Ca(2+) uptake FrECaC might serve as a pathway for zinc and iron acquisition. FrECaC mRNA was highly abundant in the gill, but sparsely present in the intestine. Calcium absorption via FrECaC in pufferfish may be subject to the regulation of 1.25(OH)(2)D(3), estrogen and progesterone as consensus cis regulatory elements for the respective steroid hormone receptors were found in the upstream regulatory region of the FrECaC gene. FrECaC gene organisation is very conserved when compared with mammalian ECaCs. Only one ECaC gene seems to exist in the F. rubripes genome, and the corresponding protein clusters together with ECaC2 from mammals upon phylogenetic analysis. Thus, the two mammalian ECaC genes may originate from a single ancestral ECaC2 gene in vertebrates appearing early in evolution.
