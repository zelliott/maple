Angiostatin is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis generated in cancer-bearing hosts by tumor-derived proteases. Because the naturally occurring bone and prostate cancers of pet dogs provide unique model systems to study factors that regulate cancer progression and tumor dormancy, we investigated the capacity of these tumors to generate angiostatin. We determined that angiostatin fragments are present in urine of dogs with bone cancer. The identity of these fragments was confirmed by comparison of the experimentally determined protein sequence to that of a clone of canine angiostatin. Importantly, these fragments were absent in urine collected from the same dogs after complete surgical removal of the primary tumor. We also demonstrate that canine prostate cancer cells are capable of processing plasminogen to angiostatin in vitro. These findings provide rationale for using spontaneous canine tumor models to isolate endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors and to investigate their therapeutic use against cancer.
