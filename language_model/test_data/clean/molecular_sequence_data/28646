Amino acid sequence analysis of the product encoded by repN of Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum (Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum) pNB2, which is capable of rolling-circle (RC) replication, revealed all known motifs conserved among replication (Rep) proteins that initiate RC replication of plasmids related to pC194/pUB110. Using the T7 expression system in Escherichia coli, RepN was identified as a 35K protein. Its lethal effect on bacterial cells was unusually high for a protein of the kind. Mutation analysis of the potential active centers (Y85F and Y211F) showed that the lethal effect of RepN is not associated with its putative topoisomerase (relaxase) activity. On evidence of deletion mapping, the lethal effect was attributed to the N- and C-terminal domains, each accounting for about 30% of the total protein. The RepN fragments essential for the lethal effect were found to share a motif, which showed no appreciable homology to known conserved motifs. The high lethal effect of RepN was assumed to result from duplication of the motif and to play an adaptive role, providing for the stable maintenance of the AT-rich plasmid in thermophilic bacterial cells.
