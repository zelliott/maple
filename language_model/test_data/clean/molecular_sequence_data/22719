It has been reported that some double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding proteins interact with small RNA biogenesis-related RNase III enzymes. However, their biological significance is poorly understood. Here we examine the relationship between the Arabidopsis microRNA- (miRNA) producing enzyme DCL1 and the dsRNA binding protein HYL1. In the hyl1-2 mutant, the processing steps of miR163 biogenesis were partially impaired; increased accumulation of pri-miR163 and reduced accumulation of short pre-miR163 and mature miR163 as well as misplaced cleavages in the stem structure of pri-miR163 were detected. These misplaced cleavages were similar to those previously observed in the dcl1-9 mutant, in which the second double-stranded RNA binding domain of the protein was disrupted. An immunoprecipitation assay using Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana showed that HYL1 was able to form a complex with wild-type DCL1 protein, but not with the dcl1-9 mutant protein. We also examined miR164b and miR166a biogenesis in hyl1-2 and dcl1-9. Increased accumulation of pri-miRNAs and reduced accumulation of pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs were detected. Misplaced cleavage on pri-miR164b was observed only in dcl1-9 but not in hyl1-2, whereas not on pri-miR166a in either mutant. These results indicate that HYL1 has a function in assisting efficient and precise cleavage of pri-miRNA through interaction with DCL1.
