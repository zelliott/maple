The core complex of Rhodobacter sphaeroides is formed by the association of the light-harvesting antenna 1 (LH1) and the reaction center (RC). The PufX protein is essential for photosynthetic growth; it is located within the core in a 1 : 1 stoichiometry with the RC. PufX is required for a fast ubiquinol exchange between the Q(B) site of the RC and the Qo site of the cytochrome bc1 complex. In vivo the LH1-PufX-RC complex is assembled in a dimeric form, where PufX is involved as a structural organizer. We have modified the PufX protein at the N and the C-terminus with progressive deletions. The nine mutants obtained have been characterized for their ability for photosynthetic growth, the insertion of PufX in the core LH1-RC complex, the stability of the dimers and the kinetics of flash-induced reduction of cytochrome b561 of the cytochrome bc1 complex. Deletion of 18 residues at the N-terminus destabilizes the dimer in vitro without preventing photosynthetic growth. The dimer (or a stable dimer) does not seem to be a necessary requisite for the photosynthetic phenotype. Partial C-terminal deletions impede the insertion of PufX, while the complete absence of the C-terminus leads to the insertion of a PufX protein composed of only its first 53 residues and does not affect the photosynthetic growth of the bacterium. Overall, the results point to a complex role of the N and C domains in the structural organization of the core complex; the N-terminus is suggested to be responsible mainly for dimerization, while the C-terminus is thought to be involved mainly in PufX assembly.
