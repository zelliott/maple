Tight junctions (TJs) serve as a barrier that prevents solutes and water from passing through the paracellular pathway, and as a fence between the apical and basolateral plasma membranes in epithelial cells. TJs consist of transmembrane proteins (claudin, occludin, and JAM) and many peripheral membrane proteins, including actin filament (F-actin)-binding scaffold proteins (ZO-1, -2, and -3), non-F-actin-binding scaffold proteins (MAGI-1), and cell polarity molecules (ASIP/PAR-3 and PAR-6). We identified here a novel peripheral membrane protein at TJs from a human cDNA library and named it Pilt (for protein incorporated later into TJs), because it was incorporated into TJs later after the claudin-based junctional strands were formed. Pilt consists of 547 amino acids with a calculated M(r) of 60,704. Pilt has a proline-rich domain. In cadherin-deficient L cells stably expressing claudin or JAM, Pilt was not recruited to claudin-based or JAM-based cell-cell contact sites, suggesting that Pilt does not directly interact with claudin or JAM. The present results indicate that Pilt is a novel component of TJs.
