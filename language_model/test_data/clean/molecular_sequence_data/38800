Complementary DNAs encoding two subunits of scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) testis calcineurin were cloned, and the nucleotide sequences of their coding regions were determined. The deduced amino acid sequences of the catalytic subunit, calcineurin A (486 amino acid residues, M(r) 55,005.91), and the regulatory subunit, calcineurin B (170 residues, M(r) 19,237.67), showed high similarity to those of mammalian calcineurins, especially to the brain-type ones rather than to the testis-specific isoforms. Northern blot analysis showed that only a single species for each subunit was expressed in testis and the expression of each subunit increased dramatically from January to March during the maturation stages of the one-year cycle. The period when the maximum amount of mRNAs for calcineurin was expressed corresponds to the one immediately after meiosis, that is, the maturation stage in which 20-80% of the average testis is occupied by spermatozoa. The result is consistent with the one as to the expression of the testis-specific isoform of calcineurin A in mouse, which occurs immediately after meiosis. This is the first report on the stage-specific expression of calcineurin in invertebrate testis and its sequence similarity to the mammalian brain-type isoforms may indicate that the mammalian testis-specific isoforms appeared in evolution after the divergence of mammals from the mollusks and then diverged rapidly for specific functions in testis.
