The use of a bioartificial liver with pig liver cells in the treatment of fulminant hepatic failure has already begun as a clinical trial in several countries. Therefore, studies on plasma complement regulatory proteins of the pig are necessary, because the liver produces them. Complement factor I is a serine protease that cleaves C3b and C4b. The DNA sequences of factor I have been reported in many species, with the noted exception of pigs. In this study, porcine factor I was cloned and an open reading frame of 1794 base pairs were identified. The predicted amino acid sequence maintained a relatively high homology compared to those of other mammals, especially in the serine protease (SP) region. The cell membrane-bound forms of the porcine and the human SP domain of factor I were constructed. Amelioration of complement-mediated cell lysis by these molecules was then tested, using several kinds of sera and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell transfectants. Both molecules had a suppressing effect on pig, human and dog complements, indicating little species-specificity. Further studies of other plasma complement regulatory proteins produced from pig liver cells will need to be considered as the primary feature of the pig bioartificial liver.
