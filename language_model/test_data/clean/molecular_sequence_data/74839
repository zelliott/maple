Herbaspirillum species are not known to be human pathogens. We report on the identification of Herbaspirillum from cultures from 28 persons with cystic fibrosis (CF). Most isolates were initially identified as members of the Burkholderia cepacia complex. Although the role that these species play in lung disease in persons with CF is not known, their differentiation from other species is important and has serious implications for clinical care and patient well-being.
