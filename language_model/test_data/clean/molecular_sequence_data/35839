Influenza viruses, like other viruses, must exhibit a genome constellation, which permits optimal virus reproduction in a given host. Besides this prerequisite the influenza virus haemagglutinin glycoprotein (HA) has been shown to be an essential determinant for pathogenicity. HA, which is synthesized as a precursor molecule, is activated by posttranslational cleavage by host proteases to obtain its full biological properties. Proteolytic activation is therefore indispensable for effective virus spread in the infected host and thus for pathogenicity. HA of the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses inducing a systemic infection in birds is cleaved in a broad range of different host cells. On the other hand, HA of all mammalian viruses and the nonpathogenic avian strains, which cause local infection, exhibit a restricted cleavability. The prime determinant for these differences has been found to be the structure of the cleavage site. This concept was corroborated on virus mutants adapted in vitro to a new host.
