Mice homozygous for the retinal degeneration slow (rds) mutation completely lack photoreceptor outer segments. The rds gene encodes rds/peripherin (rds), a membrane glycoprotein in the rims of rod and cone outer segment discs. rds is present as a complex with the related protein, rom1. Here, we generated transgenic mice that express a chimeric protein (rom/D2) containing the intradiscal D2 loop of rds in the context of rom1. rom/D2 was N-glycosylated, formed covalent homodimers, and interacted non-covalently with itself, rds, and rom1. The rds.rom/D2 interaction was significantly more stable than the non-covalent interaction between rds and rom1 by detergent/urea titration. Analysis of mice expressing rom/D2 revealed that rds is 2.5-fold more abundant than rom1, interacts non-covalently with itself and rom1 via the D2 loop, and forms a high order complex that may extend the entire circumference of the disc. Expression of rom/D2 fully rescued the ultrastructural phenotype in rds+/- mutant mice, but it had no effect on the phenotype in rds-/- mutants. Together, these observations explain the striking differences in null phenotypes and frequencies of disease-causing mutations between the RDS and ROM1 genes.
