The cMG1 gene was originally identified as a mitogen-stimulated primary response gene. However, in contrast to genes such as c-fos and TIS11, cMG1 is also expressed at significant levels before and after the transient elevation induced by agonists. We have sequenced a 1.3 kb rat genomic cMG1 clone, which includes 931 bp upstream of the transcription start site identified by primer-extension analysis. A 1033 bp fragment, including this 5'-flanking sequence, directed the expression of the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) in transfected NIH-3T3 cells. Progressive 5'-to-3' deletion indicated that an element located between -138 and -114 was responsible for most of this basal CAT expression. DNA mobility-shift assays showed that the sequence between -143 and -105 contained binding sites for cellular proteins, the principal complexes involving nucleotides between -119 and -105. We conclude that these complexes may represent the transcription factor-DNA element interactions that determine basal cMG1 expression.
