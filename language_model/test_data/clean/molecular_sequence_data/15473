A novel gammaproteobacterium, designated Gsoil 3054(T), was isolated from soil of a ginseng field in Pocheon province, South Korea, and was characterized using a polyphasic approach to determine its taxonomic position. The strain was Gram-negative, aerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming and rod-shaped. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the strain belonged to the genus Rhodanobacter; it was most closely related to Rhodanobacter fulvus Jip2(T) and Rhodanobacter thiooxydans LCS2(T) (97.9 and 97.2 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, respectively). Chemotaxonomic data, i.e. Q-8 as the predominant ubiquinone and iso-C(15 : 0), 10-methyl C(16 : 0) and iso-C(17 : 0) as major fatty acids, also supported classification of strain Gsoil 3054(T) in the genus Rhodanobacter. However, DNA-DNA hybridization values of Gsoil 3054(T) with R. fulvus Jip2(T) and R. thiooxydans LCS2(T) were 45 and 31 %, respectively. Moreover, physiological and biochemical tests enabled strain Gsoil 3054(T) to be differentiated phenotypically from other established species of Rhodanobacter. Therefore, the isolate represents a novel species, for which the name Rhodanobacter ginsenosidimutans sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is Gsoil 3054(T) (=KACC 12822(T) =DSM 21013(T) =KCTC 22231(T) =LMG 24457(T)).
