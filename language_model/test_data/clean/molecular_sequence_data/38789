A novel amidase involved in bacterial cyclic imide metabolism was purified from Blastobacter sp. strain A17p-4. The enzyme physiologically functions in the second step of cyclic imide degradation, i.e., the hydrolysis of monoamidated dicarboxylates (half-amides) to dicarboxylates and ammonia. Enzyme production was enhanced by cyclic imides such as succinimide and glutarimide but not by amide compounds which are conventional substrates and inducers of known amidases. The purified amidase showed high catalytic efficiency toward half-amides such as succinamic acid (K(m) = 6.2 mM; k(cat) = 5.76 s(-1)) and glutaramic acid (K(m) = 2.8 mM; k(cat) = 2.23 s(-1)). However, the substrates of known amidases such as short-chain (C(2) to C(4)) aliphatic amides, long-chain (above C(16)) aliphatic amides, amino acid amides, aliphatic diamides, alpha-keto acid amides, N-carbamoyl amino acids, and aliphatic ureides were not substrates for the enzyme. Based on its high specificity toward half-amides, the enzyme was named half-amidase. This half-amidase exists as a monomer with an M(r) of 48,000 and was strongly inhibited by heavy metal ions and sulfhydryl reagents.
