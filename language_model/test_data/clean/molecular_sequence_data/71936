A 314-bp fragment of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene from 21 cestodes species of eight families was synthesized by PCR with specially designed primers. These allowed amplification of parasite DNA without concomitant synthesis of host DNA. Phylogenetic trees were inferred from the sequence data using three methods (maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Fitch-Margoliash). At the major nodes all three trees were similar. For the first time the genus Mesocestoides could be arranged into the Cyclophyllidea and a narrow relationship between the Mesocestoididae, Taeniidae, Hymenolepididae, Anoplocephalidae, and Dipylidiidae was shown. Members of the families Catenotaeniidae and a cluster of two families (Hymenolepididae and Dilepididae) form two monophyletic groups which derive prior to the remaining families of this phylogenetic study. A third and a fourth clear monophyletic group were formed by the Taeniidae and by the Mesocestoididae. A high degree of variation within the examined 304-bp fragment was observed between two isolates of Taenia taeniaeformis, supporting often discussed genetic heterogeneity within this species. In contrast, only one nucleotide exchange was found in 23 isolates of Echinococcus multilocularis of various geographic origin, indicating that this species is genetically homogenous.
