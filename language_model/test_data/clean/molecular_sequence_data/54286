The MRN complex plays a central role in the DNA repair pathways of eukaryotic cells and takes part in many other processes, including cell cycle checkpoint signalling, meiosis, DNA replication and telomere maintenance. This complex is formed by the interaction of the products of the Mre11, Rad50 and Nbs1 genes. This paper reports the molecular characterization, expression and interactions of the Rad50 gene in several wheat species with different levels of ploidy. The homoeologous Rad50 wheat genes were found to show a high level of conservation. Most of the RAD50 domains and motifs previously described in other species were also present in wheat RAD50; these proteins are therefore likely to have similar functions. Interactions between the RAD50 wheat proteins and their MRE11 counterparts in the MRN complex were observed. The level of expression of Rad50 in each of the species examined was determined and compared with those previously reported for the Mre11 genes. In some cases similar levels of expression were seen, as expected. The expression of the RAD50 homoeologous genes was assessed in two polyploid wheat species using quantitative PCR. In both cases, an overexpression of the Rad50B gene was detected. Although the results indicate the maintenance of function of these species' three homoeologous Rad50 genes, the biased expression of Rad50B might indicate ongoing silencing of one or both other homoeologues in polyploid wheat. To assess the consequences of such silencing on the formation of the MRN complex, the interactions between individual homoeologues of Rad50 and their genomic counterpart Mre11 genes were examined. The results indicate the inexistence of genomic specificity in the interactions between these genes. This would guarantee the formation of an MRN complex in wheat.
