We examined the expression of a nucleus-encoded mitochondrial protein, cytochrome c, during the life cycle of Trypanosoma brucei. The bloodstream forms of T. brucei, the long slender and short stumpy trypanosomes, have inactive mitochondria with no detectable cytochrome-mediated respiration. The insect form of T. brucei, the procyclic trypanosomes, has fully functional mitochondria. Cytochrome c is spectrally undetectable in the bloodstream forms of trypanosomes, but during differentiation to the procyclic form, spectrally detected holo-cytochrome c accumulates rapidly. We have purified T. brucei cytochrome c and raised antibodies that react to both holo- and apo-cytochrome c. In addition, we isolated a partial cDNA to trypanosome cytochrome c. An examination of protein expression and steady-state mRNA levels in T. brucei indicated that bloodstream trypanosomes did not express cytochrome c but maintained significant steady-state levels of cytochrome c mRNA. The results suggest that in T. brucei, cytochrome c is developmentally regulated by a posttranscriptional mechanism which prevents either translation or accumulation of cytochrome c in the bloodstream trypanosomes.
