The peculiarities of the sequences of 18S rDNA included in a 90-kb DNA segment cloned in YAC vector are described. This heterochromatic segment is situated on the X chromosome distal to the main rDNA cluster. The pseudo 18S rDNA sequence comprised undamaged stretches of rDNA interspersed with segments characterized by high density of nucleotide substitutions and insertions/deletions. The observed patchwork arrangement of unaltered rDNA sequences was considered as evidence of segmented gene conversion events between the normal and damaged genes which are thought to constitute one of the mechanisms of rDNA array homogenization. The 18S rDNA fragment (510 bp) located nearby, homologous to the internal, undamaged part of pseudo 18S rDNA, carries comparable density of randomly distributed nucleotide substitutions with no evidence of correction.
