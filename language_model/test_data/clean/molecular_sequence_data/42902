Activation of protein kinase C is a key event in the transduction of receptor-mediated extracellular signals. Little is known about the role of protein kinase C in the microcirculation of the brain. In this study, we examined protein kinase C in isolated cerebral microvessels. A technique for partial purification of protein kinase C from microvessels was employed, using Q-Sepharose batch adsorption and single-step salt elution in microfuge tubes. This procedure greatly reduced variability and increased protein kinase C specific activity in both the cytosolic and particulate fractions by nearly 50-fold. The identity of the enzyme was confirmed by its inhibition by staurosporine and bisindolylmaleimide and by its translocation in response to phorbol ester. The level of protein kinase C was assessed by [3H]phorbol ester binding and the endogenous substrates evaluated by in vitro phosphorylation studies. Finally, western blot analysis of protein kinase C isoforms indicated that the beta-isoform was present in both cytosolic and particulate fractions. The alpha-isoform was present at low levels in the cytosolic fraction, whereas the gamma-isoform was not detected.
