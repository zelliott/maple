The tyrosine and dual-specificity phosphatases are involved in signaling, cell growth and differentiation, and the cell cycle. The enzymes share a common catalytic mechanism mediated by an active site cysteine, arginine and aspartic acid. Supplementary domains assist in targeting and substrate specificity.
