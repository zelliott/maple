B1 SINEs were studied in 22 families covering all major rodent lineages. The number of B1 copies considerably varies, from 1 x 10(4) in Geomyidae to 1 x 10(6) in Myodonta. B1 sequences can be divided into three main structural variants: B1 with a 20-bp tandem duplication (found in Gliridae, Sciuridae, and Aplodontidae), B1 with a 29-bp duplication (found in other families), and proto-B1 without duplication (pB1). These variants can be further subdivided according to their characters, including specific 7-, 9-, or 10-bp deletions. Different B1 subfamilies predominate in different rodent families. The analysis of B1 variants allowed us to propose possible pathways for the evolution of this SINE in the context of rodent evolution.
