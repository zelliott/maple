A gut2 mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is deficient in the mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and hence cannot utilize glycerol. Upon transformation of a gut2 mutant strain with a low-copy yeast genomic library, hybrid plasmids were isolated which complemented the gut2 mutation. The nucleotide sequence of a 3.2 kb PstI-XhoI fragment complementing a gut2 mutant strain is presented. The fragment reveals an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide with a predicted molecular weight of 68.8 kDa. Disruption of the ORF leads to a glycerol non-utilizing phenotype. A putative flavin-binding domain, located at the amino terminus, was identified by comparison with the amino acid sequences of other flavoproteins. The cloned gene has been mapped both physically and genetically to the left arm of chromosome IX, where the original gut2 mutation also maps. We conclude that the presented ORF is the GUT2 gene and propose that it is the structural gene for the mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
