Venous blood from 65 Panamanian schoolchildren living in an area endemic for both Trypanosoma cruzi and T. rangeli were screened for the presence of these parasites. Trypanosoma rangeli were isolated and cultured from four individuals. Serological tests of all 65 sera were performed, including immunohaemagglutination (IHA), indirect immunofluorescence assay (IF) and ELISA using both T. rangeli and T. cruzi as antigens, as well as T. cruzi synthetic peptides in an ELISA assay. Results indicated a higher immunoreactivity to T. rangeli preparations than to T. cruzi within the studied population, which could be divided into four 'serological responder' groups. Interestingly, the panel of SAPA and other T. cruzi synthetic peptides were not useful in the discrimination of patients. Furthermore, patients from whom parasites had been isolated could not be distinguished from those of two other groups. Significant immunoreactivity to T. cruzi preparations was displayed in all responder sera, despite total lack of evidence of infection with this parasite. The immunobiological significance of T. rangeli infection is unclear, but these data indicate that it is a compounding problem in the accurate diagnosis of pathological T. cruzi infection by serological analysis. The relationship of these cohabiting species, in respect to infection outcome and immunological activation, is discussed.
