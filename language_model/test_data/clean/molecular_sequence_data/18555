Proline-rich proteins (PRPs) are known to play important roles in sexual plant reproduction. Most of the known proteins in the family were found in styles or pollen and modulate pollen tube growth. Here, we identified a novel member of the gene family, NtProRP1, which is preferentially expressed in tobacco pollen grains, pollen tubes and zygotes. NtProRP1 could be secreted into the extracellular space including the cell wall, and the predicted N-terminal signal peptide is crucial for its secretion. In NtProRP1-RNAi plants, pollen germination and pollen tube growth were significantly slower and showed zigzag or swell morphology in vitro. Early embryogenesis also exhibited aberrant development, indicative of its critical role in both pollen tube growth and early embryogenesis. Further investigation revealed that NtProRP1 plays a crucial role in osmotic stress response during pollen tube growth and is likely regulated by Tsi, a stress-responsive gene, suggesting that the regulatory mechanism is also involved in the stress response during sexual plant reproduction. These data provide evidence that NtProRP1 functions as a downstream factor of Tsi1 in the stress response and converges the stress signal into the modulation of pollen tube growth and early embryogenesis.
