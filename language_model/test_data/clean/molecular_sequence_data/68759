We have sequenced a 3296 bp segment of the chromosome VIII adjacent to the 3' end of the ARG4 gene. This segment contains two divergently oriented open reading frames (YSC83 and YSC84). Northern blot analysis showed the presence of transcripts corresponding to these two open reading frames in vegetative cells. Levels of these transcripts increase five to ten-fold during sporulation. These two genes are not essential for vegetative growth or sporulation. Analysis of the putative protein products on the SwissProt database revealed that the C-terminal region of the Ysc84 protein contains a putative SH3 domain.
