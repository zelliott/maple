We have examined the comparative reactivity of mitomycin cross-linking sites in DNA molecules either free in solution or complexed with Escherichia coli CAP protein. Sites in the region to which the protein is bound show strongly variable cross-linking by the drug. The reactivity of a CpG site located where the minor groove is narrowed by bending toward the protein was decreased by about 4-fold, compared to free DNA. The reactivity of a site placed so that the minor groove is widened by the bend was reduced by about 25%, and the reactivity of a (CpG)3 sequence facing primarily away from the protein was reduced 25-fold by CAP binding. These results support the view that local DNA structure plays a critical role in determining the efficiency of cross-linking.
