In experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), T-cell receptor (TCR) variable (V)-region gene usage by neuritogenic T cells has been reported to be clonally restricted at the RNA level. This study was designed to verify TCR usage by neuritogenic T cells at the protein level. We generated two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 7H4 and 8G8 specific for a Vbeta4/Valpha11 associated idiotype expressed by the majority of neuritogenic cells of P2-specific T-cell lines. The remaining neuritogenic P2-specific T cells either exhibited a dominant usage of the TCR Vbeta13 chain recognized by the recently generated mAbs 17D5 and 18B1 or showed diverse Vbeta usage. Treatment of adoptive-transfer (AT)-EAN or of EAN actively induced with the neuritogenic P2 peptide by mAbs 7H4 and 8G8 led to a partial, but significant, reduction of clinical disease. Treatment with Vbeta13-specific mAb 17D5 had no clear effect on active EAN. Our data show that at least three different TCR are used by P2-specific pathogenic T cells in EAN, an animal model for human inflammatory neuropathies.
