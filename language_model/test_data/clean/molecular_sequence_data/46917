In vitro, procathepsin D is activated to pseudocathepsin D by incubation at low pH. To investigate the mechanism of this activation, recombinant human procathepsin D and two mutants were generated in a baculovirus expression system. One mutant carried a point mutation within the catalytic domain, which resulted in a catalytically inactive enzyme form (D77A). The other carried a point mutation within the propeptide, which prevented activation by processing at the 'autoproteolysis-site' (L26P). Neither mutant is capable of processing itself to form pseudocathepsin D, and L26P is not able to process D77A. Despite the inability of L26P to cleave either its own or a wild-type prosequence, it did exhibit activity against a synthetic peptide substrate. The ability of intact precursor (zymogen) to cleave a peptide, but not a protein substrate, offers new insights into the mechanism of inhibition by the propeptide. Mature cathepsin D can process the inactive D77A mutant to the pseudoform, demonstrating that processed species are capable of cleaving zymogen molecules in an intermolecular interaction. In addition, kinetic studies provide evidence for a two-phase mechanism for the conversion of procathepsin D to pseudocathepsin D, one phase where the first molecules of pseudocathepsin D are formed at a low rate and a second phase where the process is autocatalytically accelerated by newly formed pseudocathepsin D molecules. Finally, with the help of the mutants L26P and D77A it was observed that at least two additional proteinase activities, found in conditioned media from insect cell culture, are capable of activating procathepsin D by cleaving it within the proregion. This observation suggests that there are likely to be multiple proteinases in the extracellular matrix that are capable of activating procathepsin D, thereby triggering the second autocatalytic phase. This may also be important for solid tumors, where the presence of cathepsin D has been correlated with tumor growth and invasion.
