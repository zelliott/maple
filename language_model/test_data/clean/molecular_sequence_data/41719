A nonglycosylated (N30QN78Q) form of the human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, TIMP-1, has been prepared and crystallized in a form suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis. Small single crystals have been grown using sodium tartrate as a precipitant. The crystals are in space group P2(1), with cell dimensions a = 35.28, b = 53.95, c = 48.56, and beta = 96.0 degrees. There is a single molecule of TIMP-1 in the asymmetric unit. The crystals diffract to at least 2.3 A resolution. Complete data have been collected to 2.9 A and a search for heavy-metal derivatives is in progress.
