Highly phosphorylated core oligosaccharides and those substituted with one O-antigen repeating unit were obtained by mild acid degradation or strong alkaline hydrolysis of lipopolysaccharide samples from 23 reference strains representing all Pseudomonas aeruginosa O-serogroups. Studies by high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy revealed both conserved and variable structural features of the lipopolysaccharides of various O-serogroups. The upstream terminal saccharide of the O-antigen, which contributes most to the immunospecificity of the bacteria, was defined in 11 from a total of 13 O-serogroups. The data obtained link together the known biosynthesis pathways, genetics and serology of the P. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide.
