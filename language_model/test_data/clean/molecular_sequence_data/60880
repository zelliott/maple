Heteroduplex Mobility Assays (HMAs) of 700 bp amplified products of a 17S rDNA region were used to identify and differentiate seven yeast species of clinical importance Candida albicans, Torulopsis (Candida) glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida (Pichia) guilliermondii and Hansenula (Pichia) anomala. Distance of heteroduplex migration (dHE) was found to be negatively correlated to the number of nucleotide differences between amplified DNA sequences.
