Six cDNA clones add 3549 nucleotides to the DNA sequence of the alpha 1 chain of basement membrane (type IV) collagen. Thus the complete nucleotide and derived amino acid sequence of the alpha 1 type IV collagen with 5007 nucleotides coding for 1669 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 160,827 is known. The six cDNA clones cover the putative N-terminal signal peptide, the 7 S region and two thirds of the helical region extending into the previously published murine nucleotide sequence [(1986) Gene 43, 301]. The protein sequence for 289 amino acids of the helical region adjacent to the 7 S region has not previously been published for any species.
