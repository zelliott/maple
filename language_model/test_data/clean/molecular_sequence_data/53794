We have isolated a gene, termed CORO1C (human coronin-like actin-binding protein 1C), that encodes a new member of the coronin-like family of proteins. The cDNA consists of 3,857 nucleotides, with an open reading frame of 1,422 bp encoding a 474 amino acid protein. The deduced amino acid sequence shared 65% identity with p57 (human coronin-like actin-binding protein), as well as 46% identity with coronin, a protein first isolated from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. Computer analysis predicted that the product of the CORO1C gene would contain five WD repeats in its N-terminal region and a coiled-coil motif in its C-terminal region, both of which are conserved among coronin-like proteins. CORO1C was ubiquitously expressed in all human tissues examined, in contrast to other known coronin-like molecules, each of which is expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Immunocytochemical staining demonstrated that CORO1C was co-localized with F-actin; therefore, the gene product is likely to be important in cytokinesis, motility, and signal transduction, as are the other members of this molecular family. We assigned this novel gene to chromosome 12q24.1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
