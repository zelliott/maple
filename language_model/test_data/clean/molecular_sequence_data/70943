Alpha-cell specific transcription of the glucagon gene is mainly conferred by the glucagon promoter G1-element, while additional elements G2, G3, and G4 have broad islet cell specificity. Transcription of the glucagon gene has been shown to be stimulated by Pax6 through binding to the glucagon gene promoter G3-element. In this report, we show that Pax6 additionally binds the glucagon gene promoter G1-element and forms a transcriptionally active complex with another homeodomain protein, Cdx2/3. Two distinct mutations in the G1-element, that both reduce promoter activity by 85-90%, is shown to eliminate binding of either Pax6 or Cdx2/3. Additionally, Pax6 enhanced Cdx2/3 mediated activation of a glucagon reporter in heterologous cells. We discuss how Pax6 may contribute to cell-type specific transcription in the pancreatic islets by complex formation with different transcription factors.
