Little is known at the molecular level about the transporters involved in nutrient transfer in the plant/powdery mildew interaction. A PCR-based approach was used to identify and isolate a partial-length cDNA coding for an isoform of the plasma membrane H+ -ATPase (EcPMA1) in the biotrophic pathogenic fungus Erysiphe cichoracearum. Southern analysis suggests that EcPMA1 exists as a single-copy gene. Sequence analysis indicated a high similarity of EcPMA1 to other fungal H+ -ATPases. Expression of EcPMA1 increases in infected Arabidopsis leaves as the disease progresses, correlating with the growth of the pathogen.
