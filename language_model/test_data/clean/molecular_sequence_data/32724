A full-length cDNA encoding 10-deacetylbaccatin III-10-O-acetyl transferase (designated as TmDBAT), which catalyzes the acetylation of the C-10 hydroxyl group of the advanced metabolite 10-deacetylbaccatin III (10-DAB) to yield baccatin III, the immediate diterpenoid precursor of Taxol, was isolated from Taxus x media. Heterologous expression of TmDBAT in E. coli demonstrated that TmDBAT was a functional gene. Tissue expression pattern analysis revealed that TmDBAT expressed strongly in leaves, weak in stems and no expression could be detected in fruits, implying that TmDBAT was tissue-specific. Expression profiling analysis of TmDBAT under different elicitor treatments including silver nitrate, ammonium ceric sulphate and methyl jasmonate indicated that TmDBAT was an elicitor-responsive gene. Southern blot analysis suggested that TmDBAT belonged to a small multigene family.
