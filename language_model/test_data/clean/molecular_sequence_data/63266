Polyunsaturated fatty acids, like arachidonic acid, can bind proteins and affect their function. The 14-3-3 proteins bind phosphorylated sites on a diverse array of client proteins and, in this way, are involved in many intracellular signaling pathways. In this study, we used a novel approach to discover that 14-3-3zeta is able to directly bind arachidonic acid. Furthermore, arachidonic acid, at physiological concentrations, reduced the binding of 14-3-3zeta to phosphorylated BAD, an interaction that is important in regulating apoptosis. In addition, high concentrations of arachidonic acid caused the polymerization of 14-3-3zeta, an event observed in neurodegenerative disorders. Taken together, these results indicate that arachidonic acid directly interacts with 14-3-3zeta and that this interaction may be important in both normal and pathological cellular events. If so, then factors that mediate the release, metabolism and reacylation of arachidonic acid into membranes represent key points of regulation.
