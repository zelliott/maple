It has been reported that inflammatory cell infiltration can be detected in patients with endoscopically negative gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as well as those with erosive reflux esophagitis. In this study, we examined the expression of mRNA for interleukin (IL)-8, a potent chemokine for neutrophils, in the esophageal mucosa of patients with GERD and compared the results with their endoscopic findings and symptoms.

Biopsy samples were obtained from 80 patients. Endoscopic diagnosis was performed according to the Los Angeles classification. Patients with typical symptoms such as heartburn despite normal endoscopic findings were classified as the non-erosive GERD group. Total cellular RNA was extracted from the biopsy samples and IL-8 mRNA was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Localization of IL-8 protein in the esophageal mucosa was done by immunostaining.

Expression of IL-8 mRNA was correlated with the endoscopic grade of esophagitis or with inflammatory cell infiltration, but not with the symptoms of the patients. Expression of IL-8 mRNA was also detected in all patients with non-erosive GERD. The level of IL-8 expression in non-erosive GERD was low compared with that in erosive GERD, but was higher than that in normal controls. IL-8 immunostaining was found in the basal layers of the esophageal mucosa. Administration of lansoprazole, a proton-pump inhibitor, decreased both IL-8 mRNA and protein levels in the esophageal mucosa.

These results suggest that IL-8 in the esophageal mucosa may be involved in the pathogenesis of esophageal inflammation, including non-erosive GERD.
