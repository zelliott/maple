This study describes a new potential role in human cancer for a gene, HLM, isolated by differential display, that bears homology to an oxysterol-binding protein. A significant association between increased expression of HLM with metastatic disease was found. HLM mRNA levels were increased in circulating tumor cells in patients' peripheral blood and in primary human epithelial cells expressing the human papillomavirus16 E6 and E7 proteins. HLM mRNA was not detected in most normal human tissues, including peripheral blood and lymph node. These findings indicate that HLM may function as a potential marker for tumor dissemination.
