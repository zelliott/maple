During their metacyclic developmental stage, African trypanosomes are coated with one of 12-15 variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) that define different metacyclic variant antigen types (MVATs). The MVAT VSG genes are located near telomeres of large chromosomes and are expressed without rearrangement in the metacyclic stage. We have cloned and examined the telomere-linked MVAT5 VSG gene and its upstream expression site associated gene (ESAG I) which are separated by 4.5 kb. Within this 4.5-kb intergenic region is an 87-bp sequence that serves as a strong promoter for a luciferase reporter gene in transient transfection assays. This 87-bp sequence is similar, but not identical, to the promoter for another MVAT VSG gene. UV irradiation experiments were used to detect RNA synthesis from this MVAT5 promoter in bloodstream trypanosomes expressing an unrelated VSG. We propose that this sequence is a specific promoter for the MVAT5 VSG mRNA that occurs in about 10% of the trypanosome population during the metacyclic stage of the parasites' life cycle.
