Several immunodominant B and T cell epitopes of the P. falciparum blood stage antigen Pf155/RESA, a vaccine candidate, are located in the central (5') and C-terminal (3') invariant repeat regions of the molecule. Here we have attempted to functionally analyze human T cell responses to some of the T cell epitopes. For this purpose short synthetic peptides corresponding to these epitopes were used to study the induction of in vitro expression of IL-4 mRNA, IFN-gamma secretion, proliferation and B cell help for antibody production. In individual malaria immune donors these different T cell activities were not correlated. The findings emphasize the importance of examining multiple parameters of T cell activation when estimating the total proportion of individuals responding to a defined antigen. IL-4 mRNA was expressed in activated T cells of donors who had elevated serum concentrations of antibodies to the peptide used for T cell activation. These results suggest the involvement of IL-4 producing T helper cells in the induction of Pf155/RESA specific antibody production in individuals in which immunity has been induced by natural infection. Taken together, these findings also suggest that functionally distinct CD4+ T cells occur in humans similarly to what has been described in mice. In further experiments, we have also attempted to establish MHC class II restriction of the immune response to these epitopes at the level of the donor populations. When studying monozygotic twins, antibody responses to Pf155/RESA derived peptides and some of the T cell responses could be paired within the twin pairs, indicating a genetic regulation of their B cell responses. Whether or not this regulation reflects MHC class II restriction, or other factors needs to be elucidated.
