By using degenerate oligonucleotides based on the sequence homology between known MutS homologues, three MSH cDNAs belonging to the MSH2, MSH3 and MSH6 families, as defined in eukaryotes, have been isolated from Arabhidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia). Genomic sequences for two of these genes (AtMSH2 and AtMSH6-2) were also isolated and determined, whereas the genomic sequence of AtMSH3 was obtained through the Arabidopsis sequencing project, as was the sequence of a second, distinct AtMSH6 homologue (AtMSH6-1). Comparative analysis of the AtMSH2 Landsberg erecta genomic sequence (reported here) and the previously described AtMSH2 Columbia allele revealed several polymorphisms, including the presence of a small, transposon-like element in the 3' untranscribed region of the former allele. Arabidopsis is the first organism to show such divergence of two AtMSH6 genes; the divergence is strongly supported by sequence data and phylogenetic analysis. Southern analysis revealed that the three genes we have isolated exist as single copies, and genetic mapping indicated that AtMSH2 and AtMSH6-2 both reside on chromosome III. Finally, expression of these three genes could only be observed in suspensions of A. thaliana cells. Such a cell suspension divides actively after subculture, and the AtMSH genes are most strongly expressed at this stage.
