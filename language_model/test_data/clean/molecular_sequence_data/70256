Dejerine-Sottas syndrome is a hypertrophic, demyelinating neuropathy which appears to demonstrate autosomal recessive inheritance in most pedigrees. Clinical symptoms are similar but more severe than Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (CMT1), of which the major subtype, CMT1A, results either from duplication of a 1.5-megabase DNA region in chromosome 17p11.2-p12 containing the myelin gene PMP22, or from PMP22 point mutation. Mutational analysis of the PMP22 coding region in two unrelated Dejerine-Sottas patients identified individual missense point mutations present in the heterozygous state. These findings suggest that Dejerine-Sottas syndrome can result from dominant point mutation alleles of PMP22.
