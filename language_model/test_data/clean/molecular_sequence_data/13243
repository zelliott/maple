The characterization of 4a-carbinolamine dehydratase with the enzymatically synthesized natural substrate revealed non-Michaelis-Menten kinetics. A Hill coefficient of 1.8 indicates that the dehydratase exists as a multisubunit enzyme that shows cooperativity. A mild form of hyperphenylalaninemia with high 7-biopterin levels has been linked to mutations in the human 4a-carbinolamine dehydratase gene. We have now cloned and expressed two mutant forms of the protein based on a patient's DNA sequences. The kinetic parameters of the mutant C82R reveal a 60% decrease in Vmax but no change in Km (approximately 5 microM), suggesting that the cysteine residue is not involved in substrate binding. Its replacement by arginine possibly causes a conformational change in the active center. Like the wild-type enzyme, this mutant is heat stable and forms a tetramer. The susceptibility to proteolysis of C82R, however, is markedly increased in vitro compared with the wild-type protein. We have also observed a decrease in the expression levels of C82R protein in transfected mammalian cells, which could be due to proteolytic instability. The 18-amino acid-truncated mutant GLu-87--> termination could not be completely purified and characterized due to minute levels of expression and its extremely low solubility as a fusion protein. No dehydratase activity was detected in crude extracts from transformed bacteria or transfected mammalian cells. Considering the decrease in specific activity and stability of the mutants, we conclude that the patient probably has less than 10% residual dehydratase activity, which could be responsible for the mild hyperphenylalaninemia and the high 7-biopterin levels.
