GlcNAc beta 1-2Man and GlcNAc beta 1-6Man were synthesized using the reverse hydrolysis activity of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase from both jack beans and Bacillus circulans. In turn, Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-2Man and Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-6Man were synthesized regioselectively using the transglycosylation activity of beta-galactosidase from Diplococcus pneumoniae and B. circulans, respectively. These di- and trisaccharides are important components of complex type sugar chains and will be used as intermediates in our synthetic studies.
