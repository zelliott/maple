Reverse transcription PCR was used to amplify the complete open reading frame of the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) from testicular poly (A)+ RNA of the non-human primate Macaca fascicularis. Along with the structural motifs of a G-protein coupled receptor, sequence analysis reveals that the monkey FSHR is highly homologous to the human FSHR and has specific features such as N-linked glycosylation sites which are identical to the human FSHR but not present in the rat or ovine FSHR. Northern blot hybridization of testicular poly (A)+ RNA to a cRNA probe corresponding to the extracellular domain of the monkey FSHR resulted in the identification of several transcripts, indicating alternative splicing events of the primary transcript.
