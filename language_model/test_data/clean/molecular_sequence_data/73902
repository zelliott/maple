A 300 bp probe generated by the PCR was derived from rabbit genomic DNA using primers from a highly conserved region of the DNA for human factor X (HFX). The probe was used in northern blot analysis of liver RNA to demonstrate an mRNA species of 1.6 kb for the rabbit factor X and subsequently for isolation and characterization of the cDNA for rabbit factor X (RFX) from a lambda Zap II cDNA library generated from rabbit liver mRNA. The cDNA contains 22 bases upstream from the 5'-translation initiation codon, 1470 nucleotides of open reading frame, a stop codon and a 3' poly (A) tail. The cDNA codes for a 40-residue signal/propeptide region, followed by a 447-residue mature protein. The deduced amino acid sequence shows a high degree of homology with the sequence of HFX. Inhibitory peptides derived from interactive sites of HFX for activators, cofactor and substrate exerted degrees of inhibition of RFX activation which showed a dependence on extent of homology with the corresponding regions of RFX.
