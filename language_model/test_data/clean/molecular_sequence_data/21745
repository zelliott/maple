Cyclotides are a large family of plant peptides characterized by a macrocyclic backbone and knotted arrangement of three disulfide bonds. This unique structure renders cyclotides exceptionally stable to thermal, chemical and enzymatic treatments. They exhibit a variety of bioactivities, including uterotonic, anti-HIV, cytotoxic and hemolytic activity and it is these properties that make cyclotides an interesting peptide scaffold for drug design. In this study, eight new cyclotides (Viphi A-H), along with eight known cyclotides, were isolated from Viola philippica, a plant from the Violaceae family. In addition, Viba 17 and Mram 8 were isolated for the first time as peptides. The sequences of these cyclotides were elucidated primarily by using a strategy involving reduction, enzymatic digestion and tandem mass spectroscopy sequencing. Several of the cyclotides showed cytotoxic activities against the cancer cell lines MM96L, HeLa and BGC-823. The novel cyclotides reported here: (1) enhance the known sequence variation observed for cyclotides; (2) extend the number of species known to contain cyclotides; (3) provide interesting structure-activity relationships that delineate residues important for cytotoxic activity. In addition, this study provides insights into the potential active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicines.
