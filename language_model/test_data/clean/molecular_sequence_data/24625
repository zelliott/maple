A novel tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer is described that enables gaseous collision-induced dissociation (CID) and surface-induced dissociation (SID) experiments. The instrument consists of a commercially available triple quadrupole mass spectrometer connected to an SID region and an additional, orthogonal quadrupole mass analyser. The performance of the instrument was evaluated using leucine-enkephalin, allowing a comparison between CID and SID, and with previous reports of other SID instruments. The reproducibility of SID data was assessed by replicate determinations of the collision energy required for 50% dissociation of leucine-enkephalin; excellent precision was observed (standard deviation of 0.6 eV) though, unexpectedly, the reproducibility of the equivalent figure for CID was superior. Several peptides were analysed using SID in conjunction with liquid secondary-ion mass spectrometry or electrospray; a comparison of the fragmentation of singly protonated peptide ions and the further dissociation of y-type fragments was consistent with the equivalence of the latter fragments to protonated peptides. Few product ions attributable to high-energy cleavages of amino acid side-chains were observed. The SID properties were investigated of a series of peptides differing only in the derivatization of a cysteine residue; similar decomposition efficiencies were observed for all except the cysteic acid analogue, which demonstrated significantly more facile fragmentation.
