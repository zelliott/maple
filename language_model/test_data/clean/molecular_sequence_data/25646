The interaction of the intermediate filament protein vimentin and its non-alpha-helical N-terminus with phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol small unilamellar vesicles was investigated by measuring vesicle aggregation, fusion, and leakage. While the N-terminus suppressed Ca2(+)-induced fusion of phosphatidylserine vesicles, it caused their rapid aggregation in the absence of Ca2+; at a molar ratio of lipid to polypeptide of 25:3, the polypeptide/lipid complexes precipitated from the reaction mixture. This aggregation was efficiently diminished by NaCl. The phosphatidylinositol vesicles, on the other hand, became leaky when interacting with the N-terminus of vimentin, even at a molar ratio of lipid to polypeptide of 500:1. The leakage of phosphatidylinositol vesicles was suppressed by the addition of Ca2+ or NaCl to the reaction mixture. Intact vimentin also caused leakage of phosphatidylinositol vesicles, at low and high salt concentration. The results indicate specific and differential interactions of the N-terminus of vimentin with various negatively charged lipid species, although there is an electrostatic component common to these interactions.
