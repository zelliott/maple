Nickel compounds are known human carcinogens, but the exact molecular mechanisms of nickel carcinogenesis are not known. Due to their abundance, histones are likely targets for Ni(II) ions among nuclear macromolecules. This paper reviews our recent studies of peptide and protein models of Ni(II) binding to histones. The results allowed us to propose several mechanisms of Ni(II)-inflicted damage, including nucleobase oxidation and sequence-specific histone hydrolysis. Quantitative estimations of Ni(II) speciation, based on these studies, support the likelihood of Ni(II) binding to histones in vivo, and the protective role of high levels of glutathione. These calculations indicate the importance of histidine in the intracellular Ni(II) speciation.
