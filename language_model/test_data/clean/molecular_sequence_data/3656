On the basis of recent fundamentally novel developments in the protein structure a proteomic code is suggested, that would potentially allow to describe sequence, structure, and function of proteins by a spectrum of elementary loop-n-lock units. All major characteristics of the nearly standard units are described, and first five "codons" of the proteomic code are presented with their respective unique sequences, structures, and functions. More such codons are to be discovered, and the general procedure for their identification is described.
