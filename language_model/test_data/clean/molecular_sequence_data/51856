A 2.3-kb DNA fragment cloned from plasmid pCH200, the largest (52 kb) of four plasmids detected in Staphylococcus xylosus, was found to confer resistance to 14-membered ring macrolides in Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. DNA-sequence analysis of the fragment revealed the presence of an open-reading frame, the deduced product of which was identical to one of the two ATP-binding domains encoded by the macrolide/streptogramin-B-resistance gene msrA of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The observation that a polypeptide homologous to the C-terminus of MsrA is capable of mediating erythromycin resistance in the absence of the N-terminal region is of significance both to the evolution and functional activity of members of the ATP-binding transport super-gene family.
