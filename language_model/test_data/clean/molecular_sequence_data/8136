The tenascins are a family of large multimeric extracellular matrix proteins consisting of repeated structural modules including heptad repeats, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, fibronectin type III repeats, and a globular domain shared with the fibrinogens. The tenascins are believed to be involved in the morphogenesis of many organs and tissues. To date three members of the tenascin family have been described, tenascin-C, tenascin-R, and tenascin-X. Tenascin-R seems to be specific for the central and peripheral nervous system, tenascin-X is most prominent in skeletal and heart muscle, while tenascin-C is present in a large number of developing tissues including the nervous system, but is absent in skeletal and heart muscles. Tenascin-C was the original tenascin discovered, partly because of its overexpression in tumors. Inferring from cell biological studies, it has been proposed that tenascin-C is an adhesion-modulating protein.
