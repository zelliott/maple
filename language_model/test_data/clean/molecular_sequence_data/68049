Vibrio vulnificus was enumerated on membrane filters after hybridization with a fluorescent oligonucleotide eubacterial probe. Cells were hybridized in liquid buffer or directly on membrane filters. There was no significant difference between fluorescent oligonucleotide direct counts and acridine orange direct counts (P > 0.05). Liquid buffer hybridization was preferable to direct filter hybridization.
