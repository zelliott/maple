Defining regulatory elements governing cell-restricted gene expression can be difficult because cis-elements may reside tens of kilobases away from start site(s) of transcription. Artificial chromosomes, which harbor hundreds of kilobases of genomic DNA, preserve a large sequence landscape containing most, if not all, regulatory elements controlling the expression of a particular gene. Here, we report on the use of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) to begin understanding the in vivo regulation of smooth muscle calponin (SM-Calp). Long and accurate polymerase chain reaction, sequencing, and in silico analyses facilitated the complete sequence annotation of a BAC harboring human SM-Calp (hSM-Calp). RNase protection, in situ hybridization, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry assays showed the BAC clone faithfully expressed hSM-Calp in both cultured cells and transgenic mice. Moreover, expression of hSM-Calp mirrored that of endogenous mouse SM-Calp suggesting that all cis-regulatory elements governing hSM-Calp expression in vivo were contained within the BAC. These BAC mice represent a new model system in which to systematically assess regulatory elements governing SM-Calp transcription in vivo.
