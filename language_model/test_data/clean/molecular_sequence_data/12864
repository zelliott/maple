Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) mRNAs have been described as falling into two major classes with respect to mRNA half-life [Santiago et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 14 (1986) 8347-8360]. We have used DNA sequence analysis to address the functional roles of eleven of the thirteen cDNAs upon which Santiago et al. based their conclusions. Eight had been described as copies of short half-life and five as copies of long-half-life mRNAs. We show here that five members of the short-half-life class encode known Sc cytosolic ribosomal proteins (rp). One further short-half-life cDNA appears to encode a new Sc rp related to higher eukaryotic rp S12. Among the long-half-life cDNAs, one encodes the glucose-inducible glycolytic enzyme enolase, while another is related to the mouse housekeeping gene MER5.
