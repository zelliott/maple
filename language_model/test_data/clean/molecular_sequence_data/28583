We describe the construction of a phage antibody fragments library which combines, in a single cloning step, a synthetic human light chain variable region (V(L)) with a diverse set of heavy chain variable regions, from a mouse immunized with the prostate specific antigen (PSA). Despite V(L) restriction, selection from this library rendered two different single chain Fv antibody fragments, specifically recognizing PSA. The human V(L), used as a general partner for mouse heavy chains, was constructed by linking the germline A27 gene and the J(K)1 minigene segment, both of which are prominently involved in human antibody responses. Our approach offers a fast and simple way to produce half-human molecules, while keeping the advantage of immunizing animals for high affinity antibodies.
