Breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1) suppresses metastasis of multiple human and murine cancer cells without inhibiting tumorigenicity. By yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation, BRMS1 interacts with retinoblastoma binding protein 1 and at least seven members of the mSin3 histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex in human breast and melanoma cell lines. BRMS1 co-immunoprecipitates enzymatically active HDAC proteins and represses transcription when recruited to a Gal4 promoter in vivo. BRMS1 exists in large mSin3 complex(es) of approximately 1.4-1.9 MDa, but also forms smaller complexes with HDAC1. Deletion analyses show that the carboxyl-terminal 42 amino acids of BRMS1 are not critical for interaction with much of the mSin3 complex and that BRMS1 appears to have more than one binding point to the complex. These results further show that BRMS1 may participate in transcriptional regulation via interaction with the mSin3.HDAC complex and suggest a novel mechanism by which BRMS1 might suppress cancer metastasis.
