PYY was purified from canine colonic mucosa by sequential steps of reverse phase HPLC and ion-exchange FPLC. Microsequence, amino acid and mass spectral analyses of the purified peptide and its tryptic fragments were consistent with the structure: YPAKPEAPGEDASPEELSRYYASLRHYLNLVTRQRY-amide. Canine PYY(1-36) has the identical sequence as porcine and rat PYY but differs from human PYY at position 3, with Ala instead of Ile, and position 18, with Ser instead of Asn. A smaller form, PYY(3-36), was also purified and characterized. It may differ in its biological activity from the intact peptide and could act as a partial antagonist or agonist of PYY(1-36).
