A Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped bacterial strain, JN53(T), was isolated from the surfaces of weathered rock (potassic trachyte) from Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, PR China. Strain JN53(T) grew optimally at 30 °C, pH 7.0. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain JN53(T) belonged to the genus Chitinophaga in the family Chitinophagaceae. It was most closely related to Chitinophaga terrae KP01(T) (97.3 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Chitinophaga eiseniae YC6729(T) (96.3 %). Strain JN53(T) contained MK-7 as the major menaquinone and homospermidine as the major polyamine. The main fatty acids of strain JN53(T) were iso-C15 : 0, C16 : 1ω5c, C16 : 1ω7c and/or C16 : 1ω6c (summed feature 3), iso-C17 : 0 3-OH, C16 : 0, iso-C15 : 0 3-OH and C16 : 0 3-OH. The polar lipid profile contained phosphatidylethanolamine, unknown aminolipids and unknown lipids. The total DNA G+C content of strain JN53(T) was 49.7 mol%. The low level of DNA-DNA relatedness to other species of the genus Chitinophaga and the many phenotypic properties that distinguished strain JN53(T) from recognized species of this genus demonstrated that isolate JN53(T) should be classified as representing a novel species of the genus Chitinophaga, for which the name Chitinophaga jiangningensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is JN53(T) ( = CCTCC AB 2013166(T) = JCM 19354(T)).
