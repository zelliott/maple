To determine whether the proposed molecular chaperone Hsp47 is associated with the production of heterotrimeric procollagen, the distribution of anti-Hsp47 and anti-collagen antibodies were examined in developing murine femurs and molars of 22-23-day CD-1 mice. In addition, the expression of Hsp47, and collagen mRNAs were assessed by in situ hybridization using oligonucleotide probes. These studies revealed that Hsp47 was developmentally expressed and produced in regions that are coincident with type I collagen. Hsp47 was not localized in cartilaginous zones of developing femurs or in the regions of developing molars producing type III collagen. These results support the hypothesis that Hsp47 is necessary for the assurance of type I procollagen and is not expressed with other homotrimeric procollagen molecules.
