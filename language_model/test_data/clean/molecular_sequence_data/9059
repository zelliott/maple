Here we report the draft genome sequence of Clostridium difficile strain CD37, the first nontoxigenic strain sequenced. Every sequenced strain of Clostridium difficile has been shown to contain multiple different mobile genetic elements. The draft genome sequence of strain CD37 reveals the presence of two putative conjugative transposons.
