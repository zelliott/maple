1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) oxidase, which catalyses the terminal step in ethylene biosynthesis, is encoded by a small multigene family in tomato that is differentially expressed in response to developmental and environmental cues. In this study we report the isolation and sequencing of approximately 2 kb of 5'-flanking sequence of three tomato ACC oxidase genes (LEACO1, LEACO2, LEACO3) and the occurrence of class I and class II mobile element-like insertions in promoter and intron regions of two of them. The LEA CO1 upstream region contains a 420-bp direct repeat which is present in multiple copies in the tomato genome and is very similar to sequences in the promoters of the tomato E4 and 2A11 genes. The region covering the repeats resembles the remnant of a retrotransposon. Two copies of a small transposable element, belonging to the Stowaway inverted repeat element family, have been found in the 5'-flanking sequence and the third intron of LEACO3.
