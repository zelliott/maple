We have produced single-chain antibody (scFv) fragments in bacteria specific for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for the cloning and modification of the heavy and light variable regions (VH and VL) of the mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) CB-CEA.1. A 14-amino acid linker was used in the synthesis of the scFv gene. The VH and VL regions were amplified from cDNA by PCR using 5' end FR1 and 3' end constant region primers, and then sequenced. VH was then amplified by PCR using an exact 5' end FR1 primer, and a phosphorylated (PP) 3' end primer for J2 that also encoded the first 7 amino acids of the linker. VL was amplified with a PP 5' end primer for FR1, also encoding the remaining 7 amino acids of the linker, and a 3' end primer for J5, plus a stop codon and a BglII restriction site. The fragments were ligated and reamplified with the PP VH 5' and VL 3' end primers. The VH-linker-VL structure was blunt-cloned into expression vectors bearing the tryptophan promoter and pelB or ompA signal peptide sequences. Culture supernatant, bacteria pellet and periplasm preparations were assayed in Western blot and a protein of about 27 kDa was identified with rabbit antibodies specific for the Fab of CB-CEA.1. Bacterial supernatant and periplasm preparations also inhibited the recognition of CEA by HRP-labeled CB-CEA.1 in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Periplasm preparations were purified by affinity chromatography with specific anti-idiotypic MAbs. The Western blot of the eluates identified a protein of approximately 27 kDa that blocked the recognition of CEA by HRP-labeled CB-CEA.1 in ELISA. The VH-linker-VL structure was cloned into a vector bearing the lacZ promoter and the pelB signal peptide. The recombinant bacterial clones also expressed about 27 kDa scFv, specific for CEA.
