The solution conformation of synthetic Ecballium elaterium trypsin inhibitor II, a 28-residue peptide with 3 disulfide bridges, has been studied by 1H 2D NMR measurements. Secondary structure elements were determined: a miniantiparallel beta-sheet Met 7-Cys 9 and Gly 25-Cys 27, a beta-hairpin 20-28 with beta-turn 22-25, and two tight turns Asp 12-Cys 15 and Leu 16-Cys 19. A set of interproton distance restraints deduced from two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectra and 13 phi backbone torsion angles restraints were used as the basis of three-dimensional structure computations including disulfide bridges arrangement by using distance geometry calculations. Computations for the 15 possible S-S linkage combinations lead to the proposal of the array 2-19, 9-21, 15-27 as the most probable structure for EETI II.
