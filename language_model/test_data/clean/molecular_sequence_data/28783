Profilins are small, widely expressed actin binding proteins, thought to be key regulators of actin dynamics in living cells. So far, three profilin-genes have been described: profilin-I (PFN1), profilin-II (PFN2) with two splice variants and the recently identified profilin-III (PFN3). Here we describe the genomic organization of the genes encoding human and mouse profilin-III. Both are single exon genes and lie in close vicinity to the renal sodium-phosphate transport gene 2 (SLC34A1, NPT2) which is highly expressed in kidney. Northern hybridization to rat tissues has previously demonstrated expression of an approximately 4.5 kb long profilin-III mRNA transcript in kidney and a mRNA transcript of approximately 1 kb in length in testis. Here we show that mouse profilin-III expression is restricted to testis and that the 4.2 kb profilin-III mRNA in kidney is the result of a slc34a1 transcript which includes the antisense profilin-III open reading frame in its 3'-untranslated region. Finally, we demonstrate by in situ hybridization that profilin-III mRNA is localized to cells in the late stage of spermatogenesis.
