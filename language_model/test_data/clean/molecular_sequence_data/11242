We have cloned a new geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) synthase gene, designated GGPS6, from Arabidopsis thaliana genomic DNA. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the GGPS6 gene contains an open reading frame coding for a protein of 343 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 37,507 Da. Also, the gene is not interrupted by an intron. The predicted amino acid sequence of the GGPS6 gene shows significant homology (34.0-57.7%) with other GGPP synthases from Arabidopsis. The GGPS6 protein contains a N-terminal signal peptide which is thought to function as an organelle targeting sequence. In fact, the GGPS6-GFP fusion protein was found to be localized exclusively in mitochondria when expressed in tobacco BY-2 cells. In vitro analysis of the enzyme activity as well as genetic complementation analysis with Erwinia uredovora crt gene cluster expressed in Escherichia coli showed that the GGPS6 gene most certainly encodes a GGPP synthase catalyzing the conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate to GGPP.
