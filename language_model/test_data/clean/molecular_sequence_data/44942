Following administration of certain chemicals (heavy metals or lupus-inducing drugs), H-2s mice produce autoantibodies reacting with various nuclear antigens such as fibrillarin in the nucleolus and histones in chromatin. In the present study, we have immunized A.SW (H-2s) mice and their congenic counterparts A.BY (H-2b) mice with bovine thymus nuclei in Freund's adjuvant. As was previously observed with lupus-prone mice, such active immunization did not elicit antinuclear antibodies in any of the experimental groups. Surprisingly, the A.SW immunized with nuclei in adjuvant developed high titers of IgG antibodies that reacted exclusively with synthetic polycations. We obtained several monoclonal IgG antibodies from these mice and verified that these polycation-reactive antibodies were not directed against a specific nuclear antigen. The genetic analysis of the monoclonal antibodies further confirmed their clonal diversity. The mechanisms leading to the appearance of antibodies reactive with highly basic molecules in A.SW mice may be related to their predisposition to produce autoantibodies to cationic nuclear antigens (fibrillarin, histones) during chemically-induced autoimmunity.
