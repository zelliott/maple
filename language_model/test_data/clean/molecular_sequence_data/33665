RDL receptors are invertebrate members of the Cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channels. They are GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-activated chloride-selective receptors that are closely related to their vertebrate orthologues, the GABA(A) receptors, as well as other Cys-loop receptors such as the ionotropic glycine, nicotinic acetylcholine and 5-HT(3) receptors. RDL receptors are widely expressed throughout the insect CNS (central nervous system) and are important in inhibitory neurotransmission. They are therefore a major insecticidal target site.
