All transcription terminators for RNA polymerase I (pol I) that have been studied so far, ranging from yeast to humans, require a specific DNA binding protein to cause termination. In yeast, this terminator protein has been identified as Reb1p. We now show that, in addition to the binding site for Reb1p, the yeast pol I terminator also requires the presence of a T-rich region coding for the last 12 nucleotides of the transcript. Reb1p cooperates with this T-rich element, both to pause the polymerase and to effect release of the transcript. These findings have implications for the termination mechanism used by all three nuclear RNA polymerases, since all three are known to pause at this terminator.
