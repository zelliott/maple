5-Deoxy-5-fluoro- (1), 5.3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro- (2), and 5,3',4'-trideoxy-5-fluoro-kanamycin B (3) have been prepared by treatment of 5-epihydroxyl precursors (prepared by the Mitsunobu reaction) with DAST as the key step. 5,3'-Dideoxy-5,5-difluoro- (26) and 5,3',4'-trideoxy-5,5-difluoro-kanamycin B (27) were also prepared by treatment of the corresponding 5-oxo derivatives with DAST. These 5-deoxy-5-fluoro and 5-deoxy-5,5-difluoro derivatives showed markedly decreased toxicity as compared with the parent compounds.
