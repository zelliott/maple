In an attempt to develop a reproducible experimental model of bacterial infection in Crassostrea gigas, oysters taken from very localised sub-populations suffering natural mortality outbreaks were used in cohabitation trials under laboratory conditions. From these trials, a collection of Vibrio strains was isolated from moribund and healthy oysters. In a second step, strains were experimentally tested for virulence by means of injection into healthy oysters. This screening revealed a span of virulence among isolated strains from none to medium. When pooling injected strains, results suggest increased virulence. Vibrio strains may have additive/synergistic action leading to higher C. gigas mortality rates in experimental challenges. Although the study initially aimed to develop a simple experimental model, a complex of interactions emerged between several bacterial strains during the pathogenic process in their molluscan host. Selected strains provide a suitable model of experimental disease for further studies and better understanding of bacterial interaction and pathogenesis in C. gigas.
