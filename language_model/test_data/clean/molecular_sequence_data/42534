The expression of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) was investigated during chicken gizzard development. The molecular weight and the antigenic properties of MLCK did not change during development. The use of anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) enabled us to distinguish between MLCKs from post-hatched and adult chickens. A partial amino acid sequence determination of 4-day-old gizzard MLCK failed to disclose differences in the primary sequences of the two proteins. The results suggest that MLCK has the same primary sequence in all stages of gizzard development, although charge variants due to post-translational modifications may exist.
