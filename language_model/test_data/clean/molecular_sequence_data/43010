We report here a new method for the direct sequencing of large DNA inserts of cosmid clones from human chromosomes using STS primers of 14 nucleotides without any mismatches, which are designed from results of a mathematical analysis. It is clear that STS primer of 14 nucleotides is optimum for direct sequencing of cosmid recombinant DNA clones. We also provide examples of direct sequencing of cosmid clones of human chromosome 21 using these STS primers.
