It has been reported that Nak(a)-negative platelets lack GP IV. To examine the GP IV genetic defects in Nak(a)-negative platelets, we studied four unrelated Nak(a)-negative subjects by amplifying their GP IV cDNA, which were synthesized from platelet mRNA using the reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR). We detected the entire coding region of GP IV mRNA in the platelets of all four subjects. Restriction enzyme analysis of the amplified GP IV cDNA showed fully predictable cutting sites. These results suggest that no gross deletion or insertion had occurred in the GP IV mRNA of Nak(a)-negative platelets.
