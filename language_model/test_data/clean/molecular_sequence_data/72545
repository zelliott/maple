cDNA selection and exon trapping were performed on cosmids mapping to a region 3 Mb distal to HLA-A. Analysis of resulting fragments indicated the presence of two zinc finger transcripts, and one of these was used to isolate a partial cDNA (ZNF184) from a placental library. The second transcript contained additional sequence of the 5' end of the gene, extending the sequence to 2678 bp. Sequence analysis indicates that ZNF184 is a classical Krueppel zinc finger with 19 highly conserved zinc finger motifs at the C-terminus and a Krueppel associated box at the N-terminus of the protein. This gene encodes a 3.2-kb transcript that is highly expressed in testis and expressed at a moderate to low level in all other tissues tested. This zinc finger gene maps to a region approximately 200 kb distal to the microsatellite marker D6S105 and approximately 300 kb proximal to D6S1260.
