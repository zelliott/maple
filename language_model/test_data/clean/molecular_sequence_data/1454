The mechanism(s) by which the early EICP27 gene product cooperates with other equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) regulatory proteins to achieve maximal promoter activity remains unknown. Transient transfection assays revealed that deletion of residues 93-140 of the 470-aa EICP27 protein substantially diminished its activation of the immediate-early (IE) promoter, whereas deletion of residues 140-470 that contain a zinc-finger motif abolished this activity. Fluorescence microscopy of cells expressing the full-length EICP27 protein or portions of this protein revealed that an arginine-rich sequence spanning residues 178-185 mediates nuclear entry. Experiments employing the mammalian Gal4 two-plasmid system revealed that the EICP27 protein does not possess an independent trans-activation domain (TAD). Protein-protein interaction assays using purified proteins revealed that residues 124-220 of the EICP27 protein mediate its direct interaction with TATA box-binding protein (TBP). Partial deletion of this TBP-binding domain attenuated the ability of the EICP27 protein to stimulate the IE and early EICP0 promoters by 68% and 71%, respectively, indicating the importance of this protein-protein interaction.
