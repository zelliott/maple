A procedure for the construction of double stranded DNA microcircles is described that overcomes the natural limits of established circularization procedures. Starting with two synthetic oligonucleotides which are able to form dumbbell shaped structures, two subsequent ligation reactions yield a microcircle of double stranded DNA of 42 base pairs. This is by far the smallest circle of double stranded DNA yet described. These microcircles can be constructed in quantities required for high resolution structural analyses such as X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy.
