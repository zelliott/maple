A combined protein and pharmacophore model for cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) has been derived using various computational chemistry techniques. A combination of pharmacophore modeling (using 31 metabolic pathways for 27 substrates), protein modeling (using the rabbit CYP2C5/3 crystal structure), and molecular orbital calculations was used to derive a model that incorporated steric, electronic, and chemical stability properties. The initial pharmacophore model (based on a subset of 17 metabolic pathways for 16 substrates) and the protein model used to construct the combined model were derived independently and showed a large degree of complementarity. The combined model is in agreement with experimental results concerning the substrates used to derive the model and with site-directed mutagenesis data available for CYP2C9. The model has been successfully used to predict the metabolism of substrates not used to construct the model, of which four examples are discussed in detail. The model has also been successful in explaining the differences in substrate specificity between CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
