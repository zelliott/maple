We have isolated and sequenced a cDNA clone (pB8) that codes for a novel member of the cytochrome P450IIC sub-family of man. Analysis, by Southern blot hybridization, of DNA isolated from a panel of nine independent human-rodent somatic cell hybrids demonstrated that the corresponding gene (CYP2C) is located on human chromosome 10. Northern blot hybridization of RNA isolated from human livers revealed a 10-fold inter-individual variation in the expression of the gene.
