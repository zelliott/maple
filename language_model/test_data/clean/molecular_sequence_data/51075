The "right-sided" and "left-sided" substrate binding modes at the lower saccharide binding subsites (D-F sites) of chicken lysozyme were investigated by utilizing mutant lysozymes secreted from yeast. We constructed the following mutant lysozymes; "left-sided" substitution of Asn46 to Asp, deletion of Thr47, and insertion of Gly between Thr47 and Asp48 and "right-sided" substitution of Asn37 to Gly. Analyses of their activities and substrate binding abilities showed that Asn46 and Thr47 are involved in the initial enzyme-substrate complex and Asn37 is involved in the transition state. These results support an earlier proposal that interactions between substrate and residues at the left side of lysozyme stabilize a catalytically inactive enzyme-substrate complex, while interactions between substrate and residues at the right side stabilize the catalytically active complex [Pincus, M. R., & Scheraga, H. A. (1979) Macromolecules 12, 633-644]. These results are also consistent with the proposed kinetic mechanism for lysozyme reaction that the rearrangement of an initial enzyme-substrate complex (beta-complex) to another complex (gamma-complex) is required for catalytic hydrolysis [Banerjee S. K., Holler, E., Hess, G. P., & Rupley, J. A. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 4355-4367].
