In this report, the novel allele B*40351 is presented. The allele was identified in a Caucasian individual by sequence-based typing. B*4035 is identical to B*4002 in exon 2, but differs in exon 3 at position 463, where it has an A in stead of a C. This results in an amino acid change from arginine to serine at codon 131 of the mature protein. The haplotype carrying the B*4035 was A3 B*4035 Cw2 DR11 DQ3.
