A two-step procedure was used to place a cryIC crystal protein gene from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. aizawai into the chromosomes of two B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strains containing multiple crystal protein genes. The B. thuringiensis aizawai cryIC gene, which encodes an insecticidal protein highly specific to Spodoptera exigua (beet armyworm), has not been found in any B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strains. The cryIC gene was cloned into an integration vector which contained a B. thuringiensis chromosomal fragment encoding a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, allowing the B. thuringiensis subsp. aizawai cryIC to be targeted to the homologous region of the B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki chromosome. First, to minimize the possibility of homologous recombination between cryIC and the resident crystal protein genes, B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki HD73, which contained only one crystal gene, was chosen as a recipient and transformed by electroporation. Second, a generalized transducing bacteriophage, CP-51, was used to transfer the integrated cryIC gene from HD73 to two other B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki stains. The integrated cryIC gene was expressed at a significant level in all three host strains, and the expression of cryIC did not appear to reduce the expression of the endogenous crystal protein genes. Because of the newly acquired ability to produce the CryIC protein, the recombinant strains showed a higher level of activity against S. exigua than did the parent strains. This two-step procedure should therefore be generally useful for the introduction of an additional crystal protein gene into B. thuringiensis strains which have multiple crystal protein genes and which show a low level of transformation efficiency.
