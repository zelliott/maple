Rat ENH (Enigma homolog) is a LIM domain protein that associates with protein kinase C in an isoform-specific manner. We have identified a human cDNA which shares a significant sequence homology with rat ENH. The isolated cDNA clone, designated human ENH (hENH), was 3287 bp in length and encoded a predicted protein of 596 amino acids which had 88% overall identity to rat ENH protein. Northern blot analysis revealed that 1.9 kb of the hENH messenger RNA was predominantly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, while 5.6 kb of the hENH messenger RNA was ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues. The chromosomal location of the gene was determined on chromosome 4q22 region, between markers WI-2900 and WI-3273, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based analyses using both a human/rodent monochromosomal hybrid cell panel and a radiation hybrid mapping panel.
