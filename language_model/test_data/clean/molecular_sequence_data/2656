Genomic clones encompassing all the translated sequences, the 3' untranslated sequence, and 1 kb flanking the ATG translation initiation codon of bovine tropoelastin have been obtained and characterized by restriction enzyme analysis and extensive DNA sequencing. These analyses demonstrated that functionally distinct hydrophobic and cross-linking domains of the protein are segregated into separate exons throughout the gene. The putative promoter region lacks a TATA box, has an extremely high G+C content, and contains several SP1 binding sites. Comprehensive S1 analyses using probes covering the entire mRNA and RNA isolated from the nuchal ligament of bovine fetuses of different ages, neonate calves, and adult cows demonstrated that while only a single exon is alternatively spliced at high frequency, many exons are alternatively spliced at limited, variable frequencies. The results also suggest that such limited splicing is increased in the adult tissue relative to fetal and neonate tissues.
