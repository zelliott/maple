Most physiological and pathophysiological responses to bradykinin are mediated by G-protein-coupled receptors designated B2 receptors. Discovery of antagonists for these receptors has brought about a revolution in research in the kinin field. The chemistry and development of antagonists for B2 kinin receptors are discussed. Uses of the antagonists in biomedical research and potential clinical applications are presented.
