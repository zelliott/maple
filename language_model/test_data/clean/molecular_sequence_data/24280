The rod cGMP-gated channel is localized in the plasma membrane of rod photoreceptor outer segments, where it plays a central role in phototransduction. It consists of alpha- and beta-subunits that assemble into a heterotetrameric protein. Each subunit contains structural features characteristic of nucleotide-gated channels, including a cGMP-binding domain, multiple membrane-spanning segments, and a pore region. In addition, the beta-subunit has a large glutamic acid- and proline-rich region called GARP that is also expressed as two soluble protein variants. Using monoclonal antibodies in conjunction with immunoprecipitation, cross-linking, and electrophoretic techniques, we show that the cGMP-gated channel associates with the Na/Ca-K exchanger in the rod outer segment plasma membrane. This complex and soluble GARP proteins also interact with peripherin-2 oligomers in the rim region of outer segment disc membranes. These results suggest that channel/peripherin protein interactions mediated by the GARP part of the channel beta-subunit play a role in connecting the rim region of discs to the plasma membrane and in anchoring the channel.exchanger complex in the rod outer segment plasma membrane.
