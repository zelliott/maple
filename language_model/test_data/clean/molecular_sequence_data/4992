A neuropeptide named pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) stimulates the pheromone production of lepidopteran insects. We have identified a different type of cDNA for PBAN, which shows two amino acid replacements in the region of the PBAN sequence previously reported. Single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis revealed that the two types of cDNA originated from two allelic variants of the gene for PBAN.
