A 1735 bp cDNA for human placental cytokeratin 8 is described which encompasses the entire coding sequence as well as 33 and 250 base pairs of 5'- and 3'-untranslated region, respectively. The level of cytokeratin 8 mRNA in various fetal tissues and placentae of different gestational ages was determined as were the effects of 8-bromo-cAMP on cytokeratin 8 mRNA in primary cultures of cytotrophoblasts and JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells. Cytokeratin 8 mRNA was abundant in fetal small intestine, placenta, pancreas, lung, liver, and kidney. Levels of cytokeratin 8 mRNA in placenta increased slightly during pregnancy. 8-Bromo-cAMP suppressed cytokeratin 8 mRNA in primary cultures of cytotrophoblasts, whereas the cAMP analog increased mRNA levels in JEG-3 cells, revealing differential regulation of this mRNA in normal and transformed trophoblastic cells.
