We provide the first report, to our knowledge, of a helper-independent system for rescuing a segmented, negative-strand RNA genome virus entirely from cloned cDNAs. Plasmids were constructed containing full-length cDNA copies of the three Bunyamwera bunyavirus RNA genome segments flanked by bacteriophage T7 promoter and hepatitis delta virus ribozyme sequences. When cells expressing both bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and recombinant Bunyamwera bunyavirus proteins were transfected with these plasmids, full-length antigenome RNAs were transcribed intracellularly, and these in turn were replicated and packaged into infectious bunyavirus particles. The resulting progeny virus contained specific genetic tags characteristic of the parental cDNA clones. Reassortant viruses containing two genome segments of Bunyamwera bunyavirus and one segment of Maguari bunyavirus were also produced following transfection of appropriate plasmids. This accomplishment will allow the full application of recombinant DNA technology to manipulate the bunyavirus genome.
