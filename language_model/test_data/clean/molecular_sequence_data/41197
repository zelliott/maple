We isolated a recombinant H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) from fresh egret feces in the Ardeidae protection region of the Dongting Lake wetland area in China, and it was designated A/Egret/Hunan/1/2012(H9N2). This is the first report of isolating H9N2 AIV from wild birds in the Dongting Lake wetland. Its eight gene segments are generated by reassortment of gene segments of different AIV subtypes. These results are helpful for understanding the epidemiology and evolution of AIV in wild birds during migration.
