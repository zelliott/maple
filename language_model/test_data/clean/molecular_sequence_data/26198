Human smooth muscle cells were used to investigate the antiproliferative activities of sulfated carbohydrates. The antiproliferative potencies of coarse heparin fractions prepared by ultrafiltration increased with the mean molecular-weight, whereas the anticoagulant activities of a high-molecular-weight fraction had submaximal values. Furthermore, the dependence of antiproliferative activity on sulfate content is discussed. Carboxyl-reduction of heparin abolished both antiproliferative and anticoagulant activities. Sulfation of this compound yielded CRS-heparin with restored antiproliferative potency but devoid of antithrombin III-mediated anticoagulant activity. Sulfation of the pseudo-nonasaccharide, Trestatin A, yielded a compound having the highest antiproliferative activity, so far observed for a low-molecular-weight compound, and having only weak anticoagulant properties.
