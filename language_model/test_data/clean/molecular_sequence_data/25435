Hb Calais [beta 76 (E20) Ala----Pro] is a new human hemoglobin variant displaying a decreased oxygen affinity. The only electrophoretical difference with Hb A was a slightly more acidic isoelectric point. A 2-fold decrease in the oxygen affinity was found by equilibrium measurements performed in a suspension of intact red blood cells and in the lysate. It was confirmed by kinetic studies of the purified abnormal hemoglobin. The rate of methemoglobin formation at 37 degrees C of Hb Calais was also increased relative to Hb A. The mechanism by which the Pro for Ala substitution of an external residue in the beta-chains results in these profound functional abnormalities is unclear. Subtle changes at the heme pocket, at a distance from the mutation, may be a plausible explanation for the effects observed.
