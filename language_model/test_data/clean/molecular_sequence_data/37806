We examine the phylogenetic relationships of more than 40 species of European satyrids representing six tribes (Coenonymphini, Erebiini, Maniolini, Satyrini, Melanargiini, and Lethini). The analyses are based on comparisons of morphological data and mitochondrial genes encoding the large ribosomal subunit (16S rDNA) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1). The cladistic reassessment of systematics based on morphological characters differs from the view retained by Miller by a lack in resolution due to the low number of characters used. Furthermore, some level of incongruence about the monophyly of the tribes is found between topologies from morphological and molecular analyses. In the case of Aphantopus hyperantus, molecular data and reexamination of morphology of this taxon indicate that this species has to be included within Maniolini. Contrary to the other clades, Erebia displays a radiate systematic pattern which cannot be explained by a lack of variable or informative sites. The combined spatial and temporal specialization found in the Erebia species may explain the rapid diversification of this genus relative to other satyrids. Finally, the subfamily level as defined by Miller for the taxa presented in the data set (Satyrinae and Elymninae) is not consistent with the molecular data. Given the reassessment of satyrids as a subfamily within Nymphalidae (Satyrinae), it seems more appropriate to retain the tribes as valid taxonomic ranks only in Satyrinae.
