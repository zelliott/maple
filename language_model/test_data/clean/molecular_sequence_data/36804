The upstream region of the beta-lactamase promoter of Escherichia coli plasmid pUC19 has a DNA curvature (bent DNA). This region was replaced with another sequence by using randomly synthesized oligonucleotides. Among the reconstructed plasmids, a plasmid which could endow E. coli cells with the strongest resistance to ampicillin on plates was selected. Nucleotide sequence and DNA conformation of the altered region was investigated.
