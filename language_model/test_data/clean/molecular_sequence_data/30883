Glycoproteins from the human T leukemia cells Jurkat were found to bind to the GalNAc alpha 1----Ser/Thr-specific lectin from Salvia sclarea seeds. The analysis of the O-linked saccharides of immunopurified leukosialin, the major [3H]glucosamine-labeled glycoprotein in Jurkat cell lysate, revealed the presence of mainly GalNAc alpha 1----Ser/Thr with only minor amounts (approximately 17%) of more complex O-glycans. A comparison between Jurkat and K562 cell glycosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of O-linked carbohydrates showed that a markedly lower activity of UDP-Gal:GalNAc alpha 1----Ser/Thr beta 1----3galactosyltransferase is apparently responsible for the presence of truncated O-glycans in the Jurkat cell line. The O-glycosylation defect makes Jurkat cells an ideal model to study the initiation of O-linked saccharides. Pulse-chase experiments with [35S] methionine showed that the addition of GalNAc to leukosialin is responsible for the decreased mobility of the mature glycoprotein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, no biosynthetic intermediates between the O-glycan-free precursor and the fully O-glycosylated form could be detected either with an anti-leukosialin antiserum or with the GalNAc-specific lectin. Lowering the chase temperature to 15 degrees C completely inhibited the transfer of GalNAc to the peptide core indicating that O-glycan initiation takes place in the first Golgi elements and not in transitional vesicles between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. In addition, treatment of the cells with monensin did not inhibit GalNAc transfer to leukosialin apoprotein. These results indicate that the initiation of O-glycosylation in Jurkat cells starts in the cis-Golgi stacks.
