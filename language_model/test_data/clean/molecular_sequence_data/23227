P-glycoprotein, encoded by the multidrug resistance (MDR)-1 gene, expels various drugs from cells resulting in drug resistance. However, its functional relevance to lymphocytes and the regulatory mechanism remain unclear. Although MDR-1 is known to be induced by various cytotoxic stimuli, it is poorly understood whether the activation stimuli such as cytokines induce MDR-1 transcription. We investigated the transcriptional regulation of MDR-1 in lymphocytes by activation stimuli, particularly by interleukin (IL)-2. IL-2 induced translocation of YB-1, a specific transcriptional factor for MDR-1, from the cytoplasm into nucleus of lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner and resulted in the sequential events; transcription of MDR-1, expression of P-glycoprotein on the cell surface, and excretion of the intracellular dexamethasone added in vitro. Transfection of YB-1 anti-sense oligonucleotides inhibited P-glycoprotein expression induced by IL-2. Cyclosporin A, a competitive inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, recovered intracellular dexamethasone levels in lymphocytes. We provide the first evidence that IL-2, a representative lymphocyte-activation stimulus, induces YB-1 activation followed by P-glycoprotein expression in lymphocytes. Our findings imply that lymphocytes activation by IL-2 in vivo, in the context of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, results in P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance, and that P-glycoprotein could be an important target for the treatment of refractory autoimmune diseases.
