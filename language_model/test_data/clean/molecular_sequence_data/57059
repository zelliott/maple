The endocellular enzyme beta-glucosidase of Candida cacaoi was purified by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. The molecular weight was 220 +/- 10 kDa; its optimum pH was between 4 and 5.5 and its optimum temperature was 60 degrees C. This enzyme was active against soluble glucosides tested with beta(1-2), beta(1-3), beta(1-4) and even alpha(1-4) and alpha(1-6) and was inhibited by D-glucono-delta-lactone. The enzyme was constitutive but its synthesis was repressed by glucose.
