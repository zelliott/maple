An epitope-tagged calmodulin (CaM), capable of interacting with CaM-binding proteins in cellular extracts, would be a valuable tool for identifying proteins in signal transduction pathways involving calcium. A bacterial overexpression vector for epitope-tagged CaM has been constructed by inserting the coding sequence for a nine amino acid portion of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein into the initiation site of an overexpression vector for chicken CaM. The HA-CaM fusion produced in bacteria was compared to native CaM for its ability to activate smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), one of the best understood CaM-dependent enzymes. MLCK activity was tested in both a purified system and a CaM-depleted "native actomyosin" preparation maintaining many of the regulatory properties of the intact smooth muscle. HA-CaM behaves identically to unmodified CaM in both systems, indicating that the HA epitope does not adversely affect CaM function. The recombinant HA-CaM was used to sensitively detect CaM interactions with smooth muscle proteins in a modified gel overlay assay, using a monoclonal antibody against the HA epitope as the secondary reagent. Enzymatically active complexes of HA-CaM and MLCK could be immunoprecipitated from actomyosin preparations using the same monoclonal antibody and protein G-Sepharose beads.
