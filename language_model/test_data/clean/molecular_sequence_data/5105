Eotaxin has been found to bind exclusively to a single chemokine receptor, CCR3. Using expression sequence tag screening of an activated monocyte library, a second chemokine has been identified; it was expressed and purified from a Drosophila cell culture system and appears to only activate CCR3. Eotaxin-2, MPIF-2, or CKbeta-6, is a human CC chemokine with low amino acid sequence identity to other chemokines. Eotaxin-2 promotes chemotaxis and Ca2+ mobilization in human eosinophils but not in neutrophils or monocytes. Cross-desensitization calcium mobilization experiments using purified eosinophils indicate that eotaxin and MCP-4, but not RANTES, MIP-1alpha, or MCP-3, can completely cross-desensitize the calcium response to eotaxin-2 on these cells, indicating that eotaxin-2 shares the same receptor used by eotaxin and MCP-4. Eotaxin-2 was the most potent eosinophil chemoattractant of all the chemokines tested. Eotaxin-2 also displaced 125I-eotaxin bound to the cloned CCR3 stably expressed in CHO cells (CHO-CCR3) and to freshly isolated human eosinophils with affinities similar to eotaxin and MCP-4. 125I-Eotaxin-2 binds with high affinity to eosinophils and both eotaxin and cold eotaxin-2 displace the ligand with equal affinity. Eotaxin and eotaxin-2 promote a Ca2+ transient in RBL-2H3 cells stably transfected with CCR3 (RBL-2H3-CCR3) and both ligands cross-desensitized the response of the other but not the response to LTD4. The data indicate that eotaxin-2 is a potent eosinophil chemotactic chemokine exerting its activity solely through the CCR3 receptor.
