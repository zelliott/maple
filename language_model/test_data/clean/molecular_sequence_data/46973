Previous studies have characterized the endothelin peptides (ET-1, ET-2, ET-3) as strong vasoconstrictors which are possibly involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Whereas ET-1 and ET-3 have been characterized using a number of approaches, little is known about the function of ET-2. The aim of this study was to define the role of ET-2 in physiology and pathophysiology using a transgenic approach. Transgenic rats expressing a genomic construct of the human ET-2 gene were generated by microinjection of fertilized oocytes from Sprague-Dawley rats. Two transgenic lines were generated, and one line was further characterized in detail. Studies on mRNA expression demonstrated that the transgene is expressed predominantly in kidney, gastrointestinal tract, adrenal gland, lung, and brain. Plasma endothelin levels were elevated 2-fold, and big-endothelin levels were elevated 2.5-fold. Despite these alterations blood pressure in transgenic rats remained normal. Further analysis of transgenic animals revealed that endothelin receptors were not downregulated, and that infusion of exogenous human ET-2 results in an enhanced blood pressure response. These observations suggest the presence of counterregulatory mechanisms influencing the effects of endothelin on blood pressure. One of these mechanisms may involve the nitric oxide system since infusion of an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase resulted in a greater blood pressure response than in non-transgenic littermates. Despite unchanged blood pressure, alterations were observed in organ development and function, namely of hearts and kidneys, indicating an interference between transgene expression and growth processes. Male rats seem to be more susceptible to endothelin actions. These data show that the elevation in endothelin-2 expression in this transgenic model does not induce hypertension but leads to changes at the end-organ level. Normotension is most likely due to compensatory mechanisms such as increased nitric oxide formation.
