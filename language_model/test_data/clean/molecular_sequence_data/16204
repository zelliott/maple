The primary structure of hemagglutinin (HA) gene of Influenza virus A/USSR/90/77 (H1N1) variants after 3 and 11 passages has been determined. In the HA1 coding region of mice-adapted virus (11 passages) there are two amino acid substitutions: Thr 89----Ala and Asn 127----Asp. At the first stage of adaptation (3-rd passage) only a single mutation was detected: Asn 127----Asp. The adaptation is accompanied by the loss of specific carbohydrate attachment sites adjacent to the receptor-binding site located at HA1 subunit with a concomitant variation in antigenicity.
