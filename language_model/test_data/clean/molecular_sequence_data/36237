The para-aminophenyl derivative of Man alpha 1-->2Man alpha 1-->6Man alpha 1-->was coupled via a diazotization reaction to bovine serum albumin, and the resulting glycoconjugate was used to immunize two rabbits. The resultant antisera were tested for reactivity with a number of related mono, di- and trisaccharides to determine the immunodominant portion of this trisaccharide. Two populations of antibody resulted, one of which required the reducing end mannose, and could react with either an N-acetylglucosamine or a mannose as the penultimate sugar. The other population reacted with the Man alpha 1-->2Man alpha 1-->6Man alpha 1-->. The aglycone moiety and its configurations play an important role in determining the specificity of antibodies to this synthetic antigen. The similarity of this reactivity to the reactivity of mannose binding lectins is discussed.
