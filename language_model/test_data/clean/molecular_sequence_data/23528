In response to brief synaptic stimulation that activates protein kinase A (PKA), the bag cell neurons of Aplysia trigger the onset of reproductive behaviors by generating a prolonged afterdischarge. In juvenile animals, such afterdischarges are inhibited by a high density of Ca2+ -activated K+ (BK) channels, encoded by the slo gene. An increase in this current also follows an afterdischarge in mature animals, contributing to a subsequent refractory state that limits reproductive behaviors. Using a bag cell cDNA library, we have isolated two alternative transcripts of the slo gene, differing in the presence (slo-a) or absence (slo-b) of a consensus phosphorylation site for PKA. Expression of either isoform in Chinese hamster ovary cells produced Ca2+ - and voltage-dependent channels with macroscopic and unitary properties matching those in bag cell neurons. The isoforms differed, however, in their response to application of the catalytic subunit of PKA, which reduced the open probability of Slo-a, an effect that was reversed by a PKA inhibitor. In contrast, PKA had no effect on Slo-b. By immunocytochemistry, we determined that the PKA-regulated Slo-a subunit is present in adult, but not juvenile, bag cell neurons. Patch clamp recordings from adult and juvenile bag cell neurons confirmed that PKA decreases BK channel activity only in adults. Our findings suggest that a change in the identity of Slo isoforms expressed during development allows mature neurons to generate afterdischarges that are required for reproduction.
