In this chapter we have described one of the more complex hemopoietic factors, M-CSF. The single-copy M-CSF gene is almost 21 kb in length and is arranged into 10 exons and 9 introns. Expression of the gene at the RNA level is heterogeneous, and several species of M-CSF mRNA have been found in human and murine cells and tissues. In human cells the different mRNAs arise from alternative splicing of the nuclear RNA precursor in both coding and noncoding regions. This results in mRNAs encoding two distinct M-CSF proteins, 256 and 554 amino acids in length. In murine cells only a 552-amino-acid form has been found thus far. All forms of M-CSF have a 32-amino-acid signal peptide and a 23-amino-acid hydrophobic region near the carboxy-terminus, which resembles a transmembrane domain. A large portion of the carboxy-terminal end, including the hydrophobic region, is not found in the mature protein. Thus, the primary translation product of M-CSF is a prepropolypeptide, with processing occurring at both amino- and carboxy-terminal ends. The exact size of the mature protein is still somewhat in doubt, but deletion mutagenesis from the carboxy-terminal end indicates that the protein may be as small as 150 amino acids and still be functional. Site-directed mutagenesis has also shown that the first seven cysteines in the mature molecule are probably necessary for biological activity, whereas the next two cysteine residues are not. In spite of the heavy glycosylation found in the native protein, removal of the N-linked glycosylation signals does not seem to affect activity to any great degree. The M-CSF gene and its receptor, C-FMS, are tightly linked on the long arm of chromosome 5, a unique finding in the ligand/receptor field. This region also contains the genes for GM-CSF, IL-3, ECGF, and the receptor for PDGF. A similar situation may exist on chromosome 11 of the mouse. The close linkage of these factors and receptors is the probable cause for the disorders of hemopoiesis that arise when deletions occur in this area. The preceding discussion has shown how quickly the area of M-CSF molecular biology has advanced in the past 2-3 years. A great deal of effort is now being directed toward expressing M-CSF at high levels in a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
