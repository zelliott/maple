Two bumetanide-sensitive ion cotransporters that carry Na+, K+, and Cl- in a coupled fashion have been identified. One type, the "absorptive" isoform, carries these ions across the apical plasma membrane of the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. Another isoform, the "secretory" cotransporter, has been identified in a number of epithelial tissues by physiological means, but its sites of expression in the kidney have not been fully characterized. Complementary DNA believed to code for the secretory isoform (called "BSC2" or "NKCC1") have recently been cloned. This study used a specific affinity-purified antipeptide antibody to this protein for immunolocalization in the rat kidney. Immunoblot studies using this antibody show abundant immunoreactivity against bands of 140-190 and 120 kd in the parotid gland, colon, and stomach, sites where the secretory form of the cotransporter has been identified by physiological techniques. This distribution supports the hypothesis that this isoform represents the secretory form of the cotransporter. Studies in the kidney revealed that the same bands are associated with membrane fractions chiefly in the outer medulla. Immunolocalizations show that immunoreactivity is selectively and intensely localized to the basolateral plasma membrane of a subfraction of outer medullary collecting duct cells. An independently produced monoclonal antibody (T4) specific for Na-K-Cl cotransporter displays the same localization. Dual localizations of cotransporter antibody with respect to antibody specific for principal cells (aquaporin-2) and intercalated cells (band 3 and H(+)-ATPase) show that cotransporter immunoreactivity is localized to alpha-intercalated cells of the outer medullary collecting duct in the rat. This distinctive localization suggests that the secretory form of the cotransporter may play a role in renal NH4+ and/or acid secretion by this cell type.
