Renal cancer accounts for 2% of tumors. The most common chromosome abnormality found in renal cancer is the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p), which suggests that near the gene responsible for von Hippel-Lindau disease, there may be one or more tumor suppressor genes between 3p14 and 3p21 with a relevant role in the development of renal cancer.

41 patients with sporadic renal cancer were tested for three microsatellites mapped to the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p14.1-3p14.3, 3p21.2-3p21.3 and 3p25) by polymerase chain reaction. The results were compared with patient habits and tumor features.

43.9% of the patients showed LOH on at least one locus. Thirty-four percent showed LOH only on one locus, 4.9% on two loci and 7.3% on the three loci tested. All the patients who showed LOH on 3p21 had a tumor size greater than 25 mm. There is a risk 1.76 times higher of no loss in tumors less than 25 mm in size than in tumors greater than 25 mm (Cl 95% 1.33-2.33).
