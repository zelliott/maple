A synthesis of the phosphoroamidite derivative of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine which allows one to introduce the modified nucleoside residue into the 5'-position of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide by the standard solid phase phosphoroamidite method, has been carried out. Oligonucleotides with 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine residues in various positions of the DNA strand are obtained by the combination of chemical and enzymatic syntheses.
