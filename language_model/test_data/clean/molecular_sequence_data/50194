A partial cDNA (B52) molecule with the characteristics of retroviral sequences was isolated from the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cell line. The B52 cDNA contains 1184 nucleotides. The first 452 nucleotides (nt) are 71% homologous to the env gene of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) and murine endogenous retroviruses. The 139 amino acids predicted from the 452 nt have 82% homology with the carboxy-terminal amino acids of the env protein of MMLV. The remaining 732 nt have several features of a typical retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR). For example, the first 14 nt are identical to the 5' inverted repeat of the retroviral LTRs. The 41-nt sequence at the 3' end is common to the R region of retroviral LTRs. The 732-nt sequence was shown to have promoter activity. The activity is approximately twofold higher than that of the Rous sarcoma virus LTR, and 1.5-fold lower than that of the early promoter of SV40 virus. Two species of mRNA of 5.2 and 2.7 kb in size were readily detected by B52 cDNA in the CHO K1 cells.
