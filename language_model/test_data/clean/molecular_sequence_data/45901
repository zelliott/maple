The aim of this study was to evaluate a 54-kDa recombinant protein encoded by the CPn0980 gene for use in a Chlamydia pneumoniae-specific ELISA. The ability of this affinity-purified protein to detect C. pneumoniae-specific antibodies was evaluated with a panel of 105 serum samples from 62 patients with community-acquired pneumonia. The results of this assay were compared with those obtained with a direct PCR-based detection assay and an outer-membrane complex-based immunoassay. The 54-kDa protein induced specific antibodies following infection of humans, and the recombinant 54-kDa ELISA detected anti-C. pneumoniae IgG and/or IgM antibodies with a sensitivity of 66.7% and a specificity of 79.2% compared with the direct PCR-based detection assay.
