The sodC gene of Haemophilus ducreyi was cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of this protein exhibited 71.6% identity and 81.8% similarity to the H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae copper (Cu), zinc (Zn)-superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes. This gene was localized to a 2.2-kb H. ducreyi chromosomal DNA insert in plasmid pHdSOD. SOD activity was expressed in cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli containing the recombinant plasmid pHdSOD and was localized to the periplasmic space. The Cu,Zn-SOD produced by the H. ducreyi sodC gene did not complement the aerobic growth defect of an E. coli SOD-deficient mutant.
