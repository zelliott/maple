Three anti-peptide antisera were raised against three distinct amino acid sequences of ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 3 (NTPDase3), characterized by Western blot analyses, and used to determine the distribution of NTPDase3 protein in adult rat brain. The three antisera all yielded similar immunolocalization data, leading to increased reliability of the results obtained. Unlike NTPDase1 and NTPDase2, NTPDase3 immunoreactivity was detected exclusively in neurons. Immunoreactivity was localized primarily to axon-like structures with prominent staining of presynaptic elements. Specific perikaryal immunostaining was detected primarily in scattered neurons near the lateral hypothalamic area and the perifornical nucleus. High densities of immunoreactive axon-like fibers were present in midline regions of the forebrain and midbrain. Highly scattered NTPDase3 positive fibers were observed in the cerebral cortex, the hippocampal formation, and the basal ganglia. Moreover, very high densities of immunostained fibers were detected in the mediobasal hypothalamus, with the overall mesencephalic pattern of staining associated closely with hormone responsive nuclei. High densities of NTPDase3 positive terminals were also associated with noradrenergic neurons. However, co-immunolocalization studies revealed clearly that NTPDase3 immunoreactivity was not localized within the noradrenaline cells or terminals. In contrast, nearly all of the NTPDase3 immunopositive hypothalamic cells, and most fibers in the mid- and hindbrain, also expressed hypocretin-1/orexin-A. The overall pattern of expression and co-localization with hypocretin-1/orexin-A suggests that NTPDase3, by regulating the extracellular turnover of ATP, may modulate feeding, sleep-wake, and other behaviors through diverse homeostatic systems.
