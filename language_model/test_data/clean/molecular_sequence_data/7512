cDNA encoding the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase of guard cells of Vicia faba L. was isolated. The clone encoded a 105-kDa polypeptide (956 amino acids) that was 79-85% identical in terms of amino acid sequence to other plant H(+)-ATPases. High levels of mRNA explain the high H(+)-ATPase activity of these plasma membranes.
