An Avian coronavirus was detected in pools of lungs, tracheas, female reproductive tracts, kidneys, and enteric contents from quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) and laying hen flocks, with and without infectious bronchitis (IB)-like signs, cohoused in farms located in two states of southeastern Brazil during 2009-2010. Although Avian metapneumovirus subtype B was found in two layers samples, Newcastle disease virus was not found in quail or in hens. Based on DNA sequences for the 3'-untranslated region and the gene encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, this avian coronaviruses in quail is an IB virus-like gammacoronavirus.
