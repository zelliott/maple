The epidermal differentiation complex, located on human chromosomal band 1q21, contains at least 20 genes expressed during epidermal differentiation. We constructed a 1.2-Mb YAC contig spanning the SPRR and S100 gene clusters. Restriction mapping and FISH confirmed the colinearity of the contig with the genomic restriction map (A. Volz et al., 1993, Genomics 18:92-99). However, the YAC clones revealed several additional restriction sites not previously detected in genomic DNA, presumably due to CpG methylation. Making use of cDNA selection, we have identified three novel cDNAs, all of which map to the SPRR/IVL region. All three transcripts are expressed at high levels in normal and psoriatic skin, but not in cultured keratinocytes or in a variety of cell lines and human tissues. The molecular cloning of this region provides a valuable tool for identifying additional epidermal differentiation genes and for elucidating the relationship between chromatin structure and gene expression during terminal differentiation.
