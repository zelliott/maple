This study was undertaken to identify novel mitochondrial membrane proteins that are potential targets for phosphorylation. Mitochondrial membranes were incubated in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP and the Triton X-114 extractable protein was subjected to ion-exchange and polyacrylamide gel chromatography to purify a major phosphorylated protein of approximately 17000 Da. The determined peptide sequence of the purified phosphoprotein corresponded to a segment of cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV, an inner membrane protein of 17160 Da. The identity of the phosphoprotein was confirmed by two-dimensional electrophoresis and Western blotting. The results identify mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV as a protein which is phosphorylated by an endogenous kinase.
