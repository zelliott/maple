In adult bone marrow, hematopoietic stem cells are found in close association with distinctive stromal cell elements. This association is necessary for maintenance of hematopoiesis, but the precise mechanisms underlying the cross-talk between stromal cells and hematopoietic stem cells are poorly understood. In this study, we used a bone marrow stromal cell line (MS-5) that is able to support human long-term hematopoiesis. This hematopoietic-promoting activity cannot be related to expression of known cytokines and is abolished by addition of hydrocortisone. Using a gene trap strategy that selects genes encoding transmembrane or secreted proteins expressed by MS-5 cells, we obtained several insertions that produced fusion proteins. In one clone, fusion protein activity was downregulated in the presence of hydrocortisone, and we show that insertion of the trap vector has occurred into the neuropilin-1 gene. Neuropilin-1 is expressed in MS-5 cells, in other hematopoietic-supporting cell lines, and in primary stromal cells but not in primitive hematopoietic cells. We show that neuropilin-1 acts as a functional cell-surface receptor in MS-5 cells. Two neuropilin-1 ligands, semaphorin III and VEGF 165, can bind to these cells, and the addition of VEGF 165 to MS-5 cells increases expression of 2 cytokines known to regulate early hematopoiesis, Tpo and Flt3-L. Finally, we show that stromal cells and immature hematopoietic cells express different neuropilin-1 ligands. We propose that neuropilin-1 may act as a novel receptor on stromal cells by mediating interactions between stroma and primitive hematopoietic cells.
