The membrane attack complex, C5b-9, is of considerable importance in many inflammatory reactions. It is the terminal, cytolytic component of both classical and alternative pathway activation, and its presence presupposes other potentially destructive complement constituents, including anaphylotoxins and opsonins. We have characterized C5b-9 and its C9 constituent in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) and nondemented elderly (ND) brain using immunohistochemistry at the light and electron microscopic levels, Western blot analysis, and the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We have also conducted in vitro ELISA assays of amyloid beta-peptide-stimulated SC5b-9 production. C5b-9 is abundantly present in Alzheimer's disease cortex, associated with neurofibrillary tangle containing neurons, dystrophic neurites within neuritic plaques, and neuropil threads, but is weakly detected, if at all, in nondemented elderly cortex under the same conditions. Staining of Alzheimer's disease sections is abolished both by deletion of primary antibody or preabsorption with purified SC5b-9.
