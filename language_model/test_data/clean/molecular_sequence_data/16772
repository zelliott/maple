Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a multifocal cytokine produced by lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells, regulates immune responses, acute-phase reactions against bacterial infections, and haematopoiesis. After cloning and sequencing of porcine IL-6, the expression pattern of porcine IL-6 mRNA was evaluated through real-time RT-PCR using porcine immune cells (spleen cells and alveolar macrophages) following stimulation with LPS. The sequence has been reported to GenBank with Accession no. AF 518322. The nucleotide sequence was different at the 89th and 205th positions in comparison with M80258, but only at the 205th with M86722. Comparison of porcine IL-6, Accession no. AF 518322, with IL-6 of human, canine, ovine, and mouse showed homologies of 78%, 81%, 82% and 73% in nucleotide sequence and 42%, 69%, 61% and 42% in amino acids. Expression of IL-6 mRNA was induced by stimulation with LPS. IL-6 mRNA expression in alveolar macrophages peaked at 2 h and decreased sharply to control levels at 4 h, whereas it peaked at 14 h and decreased at 24 h in spleen cells after stimulation with LPS (1 microg/ml). These results suggest that IL-6 mRNA expression in porcine immune cells is cell-type specific and the results of this study could be used as the basis for research on the porcine immune system.
