In this short review, we compare the structure, biosynthetis and processing pathways, physiological actions, receptor systems and signaling pathways of 3 vasoactive peptides: vasopressin, angiotensin II and endothelins. This comparison shows clearly that all these peptides are synthesized as preproproteins and are processed by proteolytic enzymes. They all act via different types of membrane-bound G protein coupled receptors. Their actions on cardiovascular target tissues are either of an endocrine nature (vasopressin) or a paracrine nature (endothelins) or both (angiotensin II).
