In the A/J strain of mice, urethane (ethyl carbamate) induces lung hyperplasia, adenoma, and adenocarcinoma in a time-dependent manner. These distinct morphological stages may correlate with sequential molecular genetic changes in this mouse model. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the presence of mutations involving Ki-ras and p53 in urethane-induced lung lesions in A/J mice at early and late stages of tumorigenesis. We precisely microdissected 40 lung lesions from paraffin-embedded sections. Ki-ras mutations around codon 61 and p53 mutations in exons 5-8 were identified by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing techniques. In 29 early-stage lung lesions classified as hyperplasias (seven) or adenomas (22), we observed 19 Ki-ras mutations (66%), including three silent mutations and one double mutation at different codons, and one silent p53 mutation (3.5%). In 11 late-stage adenomas, we identified nine activating Ki-ras mutations (82%) and four missense p53 mutations (36%). These results indicate that Ki-ras mutations arise early, whereas p53 mutations occur relatively late during the benign stages of urethane-induced lung carcinogenesis in A/J mice.
