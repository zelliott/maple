Hyaluronic acid was degraded with hyaluronate lyase (E.C. 4.2.2.1, from Streptomyces hyalurolyticus), and the resulting oligosaccharides up to dp 16 were characterized by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS) and high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD). In accordance with the known regiospecificity of the enzyme, the products included even-numbered oligosaccharides of structure beta-D-4en-thrHexpA-(1-->3)-[beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->4)-beta-D- GlcpA]n-(1-->3)-D-GlcpNAc. Minor amounts of novel and unexpected odd-numbered oligomers, having the structure beta-D-4en-thrHexpA-(1-->3)-[beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->4)-D-Glc pA]n, were also isolated and characterized. This study, in addition to others beginning to appear in the literature, demonstrates the usefulness of ESIMS and HPAEC-PAD in the analysis and characterization of anionic glycosaminoglycan-type oligosaccharides.
