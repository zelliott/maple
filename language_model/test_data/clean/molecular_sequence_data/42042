The alfalfa ENOD8 nodule-specific gene is expressed in empty nodules elicited by exopolysaccharide-deficient Rhizobium meliloti, and it is expressed early in nodule development. An ENOD8 cDNA was sequenced and found to encode a novel product. Its deduced polypeptide sequence was found to be similar to the nonproline-rich domains of the putative polypeptides encoded by a class of anther-specific genes from Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica napus. The role of the ENOD8 gene product is predicted to be in nodule organogenesis. ENOD8 is expressed in a developmental pathway triggered as a result of Rhizobium nodulation signal transduction.
