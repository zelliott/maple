Synthesis of tetra- and hexasaccharides built up from a beta-(1-->6)-linked galactopyranosyl backbone with arabinofuranosyl side chains at position 3 and with a 3-aminopropyl spacer related to arabinogalactans is described. These oligosaccharides were prepared for investigation of monoclonal antibodies raised against arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) from pressed juice of Echinacea purpurea.
