Subcellular distribution of plant endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (endo-beta-GlcNAc-ase) and high-mannose type free N-glycans produced by the endoglycosidase has been analyzed using cotyledons of pumpkin seedlings as the model plant cells. Each organelle in the cotyledons was fractionated by ultracentrifugation with the sucrose density gradient system and the endo-beta-GlcNAc-ase activity in each fraction was assayed with fluorescence labeled N-glycans as substrates. The endoglycosidase activity was exclusively recovered in the soluble fraction (cytosol fraction) but not in other specific organellar fractions, suggesting that the endoglycosidase would reside predominantly in the cytosol. The quantitative analysis of high-mannose type free N-glycans occurring in each fraction showed that more than 70% of the free N-glycans was recovered from the soluble fraction, suggesting the endoglycosidase would work in the cytosol and the resulting free N-glycans would accumulate in the same fraction. The pumpkin endo-beta-GlcNAc-ase (endo-CM) partially purified from the cotyledons showed optimum activity around pH 6.5, supporting this enzyme would reside in the cytosol. Furthermore, the detailed analysis of substrate specificity of endo-CM using various high-mannose type N-glycans showed that the pumpkin enzyme, as well as other plant endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidases, were highly active toward the high-mannose type glycans bearing the Man(alpha1)-2Man(alpha1)-3Man(beta1)-structural unit.
