Spreading of tobacco mosaic virus in infected plants is of two modes: cell-to-cell movement (to adjacent cells) and long-distance movement (to distant parts of the plant). Viral coat protein has been suggested to be involved in long-distance movement. To analyze the function of coat protein in the movement, we used mutants with modifications in the coat protein gene or in the assembly origin on the genomic RNA. A mutant which has the coding region for the C-terminal 5 amino acids of the protein deleted and mutants with 1 amino acid inserted after residue 101 or 152 of the protein retained both the abilities of long-distance movement and assembly into virus particles. Other mutants in the coat protein gene eliminated the two abilities. A mutant with modifications in the assembly origin displayed greatly reduced abilities of both the movement and assembly. These results suggest that both the coat protein with its ability to assemble into virus particles and the assembly origin are involved in long-distance movement, and that virus particles may play a pivotal role in the movement.
