G(q), a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein, plays important roles such as the regulation of calcium mobilization and cell proliferation. This protein is considered as a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy. Selective activation of G(q) would be quite useful for analyzing the role of G(q) in signaling pathways. We synthesized m3i3c-a peptide with 16 amino acid residues that corresponds to the junction between the C-terminus of the third intracellular loop and the sixth transmembrane helix (TM-VI) of human m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, which couples to G(q) but not G(i2). At micromolar concentrations, this peptide was found to activate G(q) but not G(i2). This peptide is the first small compound that selectively activates G(q) but not G(i2).
