Mutant proteins with altered properties can be useful probes for investigating structure, ligand binding sites, mechanisms of action, and physicochemical attributes of the corresponding wild-type proteins of interest. In this report, we illuminate properties of mutants of the potent HIV-inactivating protein, cyanovirin-N (CV-N), selected by construction of a mutant library by error-prone polymerase chain reaction and affinity-based screening using T7 phage display technology. After three rounds of biopanning, two phage-displayed, one-point mutants of CV-N, Ser52Pro and Ala77Thr, were isolated. After the elucidation of biological activities of the mutants displayed on phage as well as the Escherichia coli-expressed, purified mutant proteins, we subsequently subjected the mutants to analyses by native PAGE and size-exclusion chromatography. We found that the Ser52Pro mutant not only was active against HIV but also existed exclusively as a dimer in solution. This was in marked contrast to the wild-type CV-N, which exists in solution predominantly as the monomer. The Ser52Pro mutant provides a novel model for further investigations of the folding mechanism as well as structure-activity requirements for CV-N's antiviral properties.
