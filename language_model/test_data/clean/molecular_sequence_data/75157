Double-stranded DNA containing a d(pG)18.d(pC)18 sequence was shown to be selectively alkylated in the vicinity of this fragment using the 5'-p-(N-2-chloroethyl-N-methylamino)benzylamide of deoxyribooligocytidylate, CIRCH2NH(pdC)n (n = 9,15), in conditions favouring triple-stranded complex formation.
