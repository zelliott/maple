Previous studies have shown that linearized SV40-based shuttle vectors transfected into mammalian cells are efficiently recircularized by an error-prone end-joining pathway. To determine whether and with what specificity free radical-mediated double-strand breaks are rejoined by this pathway, a structural mimic of such a break was introduced at a specific site in an SV40-based shuttle vector, by ligating purified 3'-phosphoglycolate-terminated oligonucleotides into 3' recessed ends generated in the linearized vector. These terminally blocked linear vectors were efficiently repaired and replicated when transfected into simian CV-1 cells. Sequencing across the repair joints in progeny plasmid indicated that, for a blunt-ended vector, the most frequent mechanism of rejoining was splicing at a terminal 4-base homology; however, a significant fraction of the joints retained all bases from both ends of the break, consistent with a mechanism involving simple 3'-phosphoglycolate removal, followed by blunt-end ligation. For the analogous 3'-hydroxyl terminated break, the fraction of simple blunt-end ligations was considerably higher. For a phosphoglycolate-terminated vector with cohesive ends the most frequent repair mechanism was simple ligation of the annealed cohesive ends, presumably preceded by phosphoglycolate removal. For all these substrates, the remaining repair joints showed small or large deletions from one or both of the ends, usually with apparent annealing at short (1-4-base) homologies. The results suggest that while breaks with 3'-phosphoglycolates can be repaired, these blocked termini represent a significant barrier to DNA end-joining, and can significantly alter its specificity. The presence of cohesive ends appears to improve markedly the fidelity of rejoining for terminally blocked double-strand breaks.
