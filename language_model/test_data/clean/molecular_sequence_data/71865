The highly heterogeneous rat hemoglobin system was investigated at the gene level. Two regions of the alpha-like globin gene cluster from a Wistar rat were isolated. Four lambda Dash recombinant clones carrying rat alpha-like globin genes were localized on two distinct gene regions. A region of approximately 16kb was found to contain the 5'-IIalpha1-psi theta 1-3' loci, and another of approximately 24kb the 5'-IIalpha2-psi theta2-psiI alpha3-3' loci. Both IIalpha1 and IIalpha2 are considered to be active, coding the IIalpha-globin chain. The nt sequences of IIalpha1 and IIalpha2 are identical except for six nt in the non-coding region. The psiI alpha3 locus is a truncated pseudogene. The putative promoter region of an alpha-like globin gene is joined directly to the third exon, homologous to that of Ialpha-globin cDNA. psi theta1 and psi theta2 are also pseudogenes, as evidenced by several deletions located in the protein-coding regions of these loci. The psi theta1 and psi theta2 loci exhibit extensive homology, but the restriction maps of these genes and their flanking regions differ considerably. Genomic Southern blot analyses of the total liver DNA from six rats showed the existence of three theta-globin-related genes, including psi theta1 and psi theta2. These results indicate that the two gene regions investigated are not allelic variants, but may be generated by block duplication. This is the first report of the existence of rodent theta-globin genes.
