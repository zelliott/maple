The survivability of embryo, especially during the early embryonic life is dependent on the effective maternal recognition of pregnancy. Interferon-tau (IFNT), secreted from the elongating blastocyst, acts as the primary signal for maternal recognition of pregnancy in ruminant ungulates. IFNT has been studied extensively in many domesticated and wild ruminant species. In the present study, we have cloned and characterized the IFNT gene of Garole sheep, a popular Indian micro-sheep breed, which is known across the world for its high prolificacy and fecundity. The 588 bp sequences of two variants of IFNT gene described in this study are novel variants, compared to the variants reported previously in sheep. It exhibited more than 96% identity with other ovine IFNT variants and phylogenetically placed in a single clad containing the ovine, caprine and musk ox IFNT variants. The IFNT of Garole sheep demonstrated the highest identity with the genomic derived and highly expressed ovine IFNT variants.
