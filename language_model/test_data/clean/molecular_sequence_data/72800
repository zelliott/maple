Differential Display was used to isolate genes that show transcriptional changes in the kidney during the development of diabetes in the GK rat. Eight candidate diabetes-associated cDNA fragments, CDK1-8, were isolated and characterised. cDNA sequencing and subsequent database analysis revealed that CDK2, 4, 5 and 6 showed no significant sequence similarity to previously reported genes, suggesting that they represent novel genes, whereas CDK 1, 3, 7 and 8 showed significant similarity with rat lactate dehydrogenase, rat amiloride sensitive sodium channel, EST109013 and mouse ubiquitin-like protein respectively. The differential mRNA expression of CDK1-8 was confirmed using differential screening of slot blots. CDK1, 2, 4 and 8 mRNAs appeared to increase whereas CDK3, 5, 6 and 7 mRNAs decreased in the kidneys of GK rats with increasing hyperglycaemia. The altered renal mRNA expression of these genes in association with increased hyperglycemia in the GK rat suggest that they are candidates for a role in the development of diabetic nephropathy.
