The fission yeast dsk1+ gene, a multicopy suppressor for cold-sensitive dis1 mutants, encodes a novel 61-kd protein kinase. It is a phosphoprotein, and phosphoserine is the major phosphorylated amino acid. Hyperphosphorylation of dsk1 causes a mobility shift, resulting in two dsk1-specific protein bands. The phosphorylation pattern is strikingly altered when cell cycle progression is delayed or arrested. The slowly migrating phosphorylated form is prominent in mitotically arrested cells, and the fast migrating form is enriched in interphase-arrested cells. dsk1 is a protein kinase. It auto-phosphorylates as well as phosphorylates myelin basic protein (MBP). Phosphotyrosine as well as phosphoserine/threonine were found in autophosphorylation, but no tyrosine phosphorylation occurs when MBP was used as the substrate. The dsk1 immunoprecipitates from mitotically arrested cells have a several-fold higher kinase activity than that from wild type. The haploid gene disruptant is viable, indicating that the dsk1+ gene is non-essential for viability. High dosage of dsk1+, however, strongly delays the G2/M progression. Immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-dsk1 antibody shows that localization pattern of dsk1 protein strikingly alters depending on cell cycle stages. In G2-arrested cells, dsk1 locates in the cytoplasm, whereas in mitotically arrested cells, nuclear stain is intense. In wild-type cells, nuclear stain is seen only in mitotic cells. Hence dsk1 protein may play an important role in mitotic control by altering cellular location, degree of phosphorylation and kinase activity. We discuss possible roles of dsk1 kinase as an add-on regulator in mitosis.
