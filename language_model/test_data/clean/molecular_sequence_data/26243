Oligodeoxynucleotide probes (17 and 28 bases long) complementary to a unique region of Treponema hyodysenteriae 16S rRNA were developed. These probes bound specifically to partially purified rRNA and whole-cell rRNA of T. hyodysenteriae. No binding to partially purified rRNA or whole-cell rRNA of Treponema innocens, Treponema succinifaciens, Treponema bryantii, or Escherichia coli occurred under stringent conditions. The 28-base probe was 5 to 10 times more sensitive than the 17-base probe when hybridized with T. hyodysenteriae rRNA. The 28-base probe detected T. hyodysenteriae in the feces of experimentally inoculated pigs exhibiting clinical signs of swine dysentery.
