An approximately 1.9-kb region encompassing the CHI gene, which encodes chalcone isomerase, was sequenced in 24 worldwide ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. and in 1 ecotype of A. lyrata ssp. petraea. There was no evidence for dimorphism at the CHI region. A minimum of three recombination events was inferred in the history of the sampled ecotypes of the highly selfing A. thaliana. The estimated nucleotide diversity theta(TOTAL) = 0.004, theta(SIL) = 0. 005 was on the lower part of the range of the corresponding estimates for other gene regions. The skewness of the frequency spectrum toward an excess of low-frequency polymorphisms, together with the bell-shaped distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences at CHI, suggests that A. thaliana has recently experienced a rapid population growth. Although this pattern could also be explained by a recent selective sweep at the studied region, results from the other studied loci and from an AFLP survey seem to support the expansion hypothesis. Comparison of silent polymorphism and divergence at the CHI region and at the Adh1 and ChiA revealed in some cases a significant deviation of the direct relationship predicted by the neutral theory, which would be compatible with balancing selection acting at the latter regions.
