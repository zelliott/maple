Two catalases, KatA and KatB, have been detected in Sinorhizobium meliloti growing on rich medium. Here we characterize a new catalase gene encoding a third catalase (KatC). KatC activity was detectable only at the end of the stationary phase in S. meliloti growing in minimum medium, whereas KatA activity was found during the exponential phase. Analysis with a katC-lacZ fusion demonstrated that katC expression is mainly regulated at the transcription level. An increase of catalase activity correlating with KatA induction was detected in bacteroids. A dramatic decrease of nitrogen fixation capacity in a katA katC double mutant was observed, suggesting that these catalases are very important for the protection of the nitrogen fixation process.
