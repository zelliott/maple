RNase H (retroviral ribonuclease H) cleaves the phosphate backbone of the RNA template within an RNA/DNA hybrid to complete the synthesis of double-stranded viral DNA. In the present study we have determined the complete structure of the RNase H domain from XMRV (xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus) RT (reverse transcriptase). The basic protrusion motif of the XMRV RNase H domain is folded as a short helix and an adjacent highly bent loop. Structural superposition and subsequent mutagenesis experiments suggest that the basic protrusion motif plays a role in direct binding to the major groove in RNA/DNA hybrid, as well as in establishing the co-ordination among modules in RT necessary for proper function.
