Previously, we demonstrated that a putative vesicle-targeting protein, syntaxin-4, is expressed in renal collecting duct principal cells and is localized to the apical plasma membrane, suggesting a role in targeting aquaporin-2-containing vesicles to the apical plasma membrane. To investigate whether other syntaxin isoforms are present in the renal collecting duct, we determined the intrarenal localization of syntaxin-2 and -3. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments using total RNA extracted from kidney and various organs revealed that both syntaxin-2 and -3 are expressed in kidney cortex and medulla. RT-PCR experiments using microdissected tubules and vascular structures from the kidney revealed that syntaxin-3 mRNA, but not syntaxin-2, is expressed in collecting duct cells. Syntaxin-3 mRNA was also relatively abundant in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop and in vasa recta. Syntaxin-2 mRNA was found chiefly in glomeruli. To investigate the localization of syntaxin-3 protein, a peptide-derived polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbits. In immunoblotting experiments, this antibody labeled a 37-kDa protein in inner medulla that was most abundant in plasma membrane-enriched subcellular fractions. Immunoperoxidase labeling of thin cryosections combined with immunogold electron microscopy showed that, in contrast to the labeling seen for syntaxin-4, syntaxin-3 labeling in medullary collecting duct was predominantly in the basolateral plasma membrane of intercalated cells. These results suggest the possibility that syntaxin-3 may be involved in selective targeting of acid-base transporters and/or in basolateral membrane remodeling in response to systemic acid-base perturbations.
