We have incorporated chloroplast ribosomal proteins (R-proteins) L12 and S18 into Escherichia coli ribosomes and examined the hybrid ribosomes for their ability to form polysomes in vivo and perform poly(U)-dependent poly(Phe) synthesis in vitro. The rye chloroplast S18 used for the experiment is a highly divergent protein (170 amino acid residues; E. coil S18, 74 residues), containing a repeating, chloroplast-specific, heptapeptide motif, and has amino acid sequence identity of only 35% to E. coli S18. When expressed in E. coli, chloroplast S18 was assembled in E. coli ribosomes. The latter formed polysomes in vivo at about the same rate as the host ribosomes, indicating that the replacement of E. coli S18 with its chloroplast homologue has only a minor, if any, effect on function. The L12 protein is much more conserved in sequence and chain length, and is known to have a very important function. The Arabidopsis chloroplast L12 used in the experiment was incorporated into E. coli 50S subunits that associated with the 30S subunits to form ribosomes, but the latter were unable to form polysomes. This result indicates functional inactivation of E. coil ribosomes by a chloroplast R-protein. To further confirm this result, we overproduced chloroplast L12 through the use of a secretion vector and purified the protein to homogeneity. Chloroplast L12 could be efficiently incorporated in vitro into L7/12-lacking E. coli ribosomes, but the hybrid ribosomes were totally inactive in poly(U)-dependent poly(Phe) synthesis. Computer modeling of the spatial structure of all known chloroplast L12 proteins (using E. coli L12 coordinates) indicated a 'chloroplast loop' present only in chloroplast L12. The presence of this loop might have a role in the observed inactivation. Taken together with previously reported results (summarized in this paper), it would appear that the features of chloroplast R-proteins concerned with specific functions are more divergent than their assembly properties. We have previously described methods suitable for overproduction and purification of chloroplast R-proteins that are encoded in organellar DNA (approximately 20), but that gave poor yield for those encoded in the nuclear DNA (approximately 45). Here we describe a method that overcomes this problem and allows the purification of nucleus-encoded chloroplast R-proteins in milligram quantities.
