A method to obtain disruption cassettes based on the homologous recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is described. The disruption marker is amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides containing 50 bp homologous to the disruptable gene and 20 bp from the marker. The PCR product is cotransformed into yeast with a plasmid containing the gene. After recombination, a plasmid that carries the disruption cassette for the gene is produced.
