In a previous paper, we reported the isolation and structure determination of three new steroidal saponins, dongnosides C (3), D (2) and E (1) from the dried fermented residues of leaf-juices of Agave sisalana forma Dong No. 1. In a continuing study on this plant, two additional new major steroidal saponins, named dongnosides B (4) and A (5), were obtained. Their structures were characterized respectively as tigogenin 3-O-alpha-L-rhamonpyranosyl-(1-->4)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)- [beta-D- glucopyranosyl-(1-->3)]-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->4)-beta-D-galactop yranoside and 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->4)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->2)-[beta- D- xylopyranosyl-(1-->3)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->3)]-beta-D- glucopyranosyl-(1-->4)-beta-D-galactopyranoside on the basis of chemical and physicochemical evidence.
