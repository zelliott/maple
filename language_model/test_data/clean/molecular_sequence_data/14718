WaaA is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of LPS, a critical component of the outer envelope of Gram-negative bacteria. Embedded in the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane, WaaA catalyzes the transfer of 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) to the lipid A precursor of LPS. Here we present crystal structures of the free and CMP-bound forms of WaaA from Aquifex aeolicus, an ancient Gram-negative hyperthermophile. These structures reveal details of the CMP-binding site and implicate a unique sequence motif (GGS/TX(5)GXNXLE) in Kdo binding. In addition, a cluster of highly conserved amino acid residues was identified which represents the potential membrane-attachment and acceptor-substrate binding site of WaaA. A series of site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed critical roles for glycine 30 and glutamate 31 in Kdo transfer. Our results provide the structural basis of a critical reaction in LPS biosynthesis and allowed the development of a detailed model of the catalytic mechanism of WaaA.
