Vasopressin (VP) mRNA and the non-coding BC200 RNA are sorted to neuronal dendrites. Among proteins interacting specifically with both RNAs is the multifunctional poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) consisting of four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a C-terminal auxiliary domain. The protein/RNA interaction studies presented here reveal that PABPs association with VP- and BC200 RNA is exclusively mediated by RRMs 3+4. Quantitative binding studies with PABP deletion mutants demonstrate preferential binding of RRMs 3+4 even to poly(A)-homopolymers, while RRMs 1+2 exhibit a lower affinity for those sequences. An optimal interaction with both poly(A)- and non-poly(A) sequences is only achieved by full-size PABP.
