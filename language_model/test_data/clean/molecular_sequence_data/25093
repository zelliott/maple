The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC-4R) is a 7-transmembrane protein, which is involved in the central regulation of appetite and obesity. Despite the great interest in this protein, tools for detecting this molecule (as expressed on the cell surface in its native state) have been unavailable. Radioactive- or otherwise labeled ligands showed low receptor specificity to this particular melanocortin receptor isotype. Also, the antibodies were only available for epitopes that were displayed in the cytoplasm. To produce antibodies that enable the detection of this receptor (as expressed on the cell surface without disruption of the target cells), a candidate epitope was selected from the extracellular domains by a computer-aided analysis of the IC-4R secondary structure. This particular region was then recombinantly expressed in E. coli. Immunization of BALB/c mice with the recombinant proteins induced a specific immune reaction, which resulted in the production of MC-4R-specific antibodies. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays confirmed the specificity of these antibodies. To examine whether this tool also reacts with native cell surface-displayed MC-4R, HEK-293 cells were transfected with the human MC-4R cDNA. They were analyzed with these antibodies using Western blot and flow cytometry. Specificity and exclusion of cross-reactivity of these antibodies to other MC receptors were further confirmed by an immunofluorescence analysis of the HEK-293 cells that were transfected with other MC receptor isotypes. It is evident that with the availability of this tool, studies on the cell- and tissue-specificity, as well as the regulation mechanism of the MC-4 receptor, will be largely facilitated.
