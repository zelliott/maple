The hydrolysis of H-Cys(Bzl)-NH-Meq by human serum oxytocinase (E.C. 3.4.11.3) was inhibited non-competitively by various pyroglutamyl peptides. The most effective were the chicken GnRH II (Ki = 6 x 10(-6) mol l-1) and salmon GnRH (Ki = 12 x 10(-6) mol l-1), while the inhibitory potency of human GnRH was substantially lower (Ki = 60.0 x 10(-6) mol l-1). Variations in inhibitory potency of individual peptides reflected mostly the differences in N-terminal and C-terminal parts of the molecules.
