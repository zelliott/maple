Posttranscriptional editing of trypanosome mitochondrial messenger RNA is directed by small guide RNAs (gRNAs). Using crosslinking techniques, we have previously shown that the gRNA base pairs to the mRNA via a 5' anchor, whereas its 3' U-tail interacts with upstream purine-rich mRNA sequences. The incorporation of crosslinking data into RNA folding programs produced similar structure predictions for all gRNA/mRNA pairs examined. This suggests that gRNA/mRNA pairs can form common secondary structure motifs that may be important for recognition by the editing complex. In this study, the structure of CYb mRNA crosslinked to gCYb-558 was examined using solution-probing techniques. The mRNA/gRNA crosslinked molecules are efficient substrates for gRNA-directed cleavage. In addition, when the cleavage assay is performed in the presence or absence of additional UTP, the activities of both the U-specific exonuclease and terminal uridylyl transferase (tutase) can be detected. These results indicate that a partial editing complex can assemble and function on these substrates suggesting that the crosslink captured the molecules in a biologically relevant interaction. The structure probing data directly show that the U-tail protects several mRNA bases predicted to be involved in the U-tail-mRNA duplex. In combination with our previous studies, these new data provide additional support for the predicted secondary structure of interacting gRNA/mRNA pairs.
