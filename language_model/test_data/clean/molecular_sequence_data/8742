Mucins are heavily O-glycosylated Thr/Ser/Pro-rich molecules. Given their relevant functions, mucins and their genes have been mainly studied in higher eukaryotes. In the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, mucin-like glycoproteins were shown to play an important role in the interaction with the surface of the mammalian cell during the invasion process. We show now that this parasite has a family of putative mucin genes, whose organization resembles the one present in mammalian cells. Different parasite isolates have different sets of genes, as defined by their central domain. Central domains, rich in codons for Thr and/or Ser and Pro residues, are made up of either a variable number of repeat units in tandem or non-repetitive sequences. Conversely, 5'- and 3'-ends from different genes in different isolates have similar sequences, suggesting their common origin. Comparison of deduced amino acid sequences revealed that all members of the family have the same putative signal peptide on the N terminus and a putative sequence for glycophosphatidylinositol anchoring on the C terminus. The deduced molecular mass of the core proteins is small (from 17 to 21 kDa), in agreement with the 1-kilobase size of the mRNA detected. Putative mucin genes in T. cruzi are located on large chromosomal bands of about 1.6-2.2 megabase pairs.
