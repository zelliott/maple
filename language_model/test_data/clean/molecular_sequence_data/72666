The polysaccharide part of the lipopolysaccharide obtained from the enteropathogenic Escherichia coli O142 has been isolated, and its structure determined. Together with 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy, sugar and methylation analyses show that the polysaccharide is composed of repeating pentasaccharide units. Sequential information on the O-polysaccharide was obtained by two-dimensional NMR techniques, namely heteronuclear-multiple-bond-connectivity and NOESY experiments. The repeating unit of the O-polysaccharide of E. coli strain O142 has the following structure: [structure: see text].
