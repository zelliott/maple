Very small vertebrate exons are problematic for RNA splicing because of the proximity of their 3' and 5' splice sites. In this study, we investigated the recognition of a constitutive 7-nucleotide mini-exon from the troponin I gene that resides quite close to the adjacent upstream exon. The mini-exon failed to be included in spliced RNA when placed in a heterologous gene unless accompanied by the upstream exon. The requirement for the upstream exon disappeared when the mini-exon was internally expanded, suggesting that the splice sites bordering the mini-exon are compatible with those of other constitutive vertebrate exons and that the small size of the exon impaired inclusion. Mutation of the 5' splice site of the natural upstream exon did not result in either exon skipping or activation of a cryptic 5' splice site, the normal vertebrate phenotypes for such mutants. Instead, a spliced RNA accumulated that still contained the upstream intron. In vitro, the mini-exon failed to assemble into spliceosome complexes unless either internally expanded or accompanied by the upstream exon. Thus, impaired usage of the mini-exon in vivo was accompanied by impaired recognition in vitro, and recognition of the mini-exon was facilitated by the presence of the upstream exon in vivo and in vitro. Cumulatively, the atypical in vivo and in vitro properties of the troponin exons suggest a mechanism for the recognition of this mini-exon in which initial recognition of an exon-intron-exon unit is followed by subsequent recognition of the intron.
