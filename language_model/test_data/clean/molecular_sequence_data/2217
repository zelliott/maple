Two forms of small, interstitial proteoglycans have been isolated from bovine articular cartilage and have different core proteins, based on NH2-terminal analysis and peptide mapping (Choi, H. U., Johnson, T. L., Pal, S., Tang, L-H., Rosenberg, L. C., and Neame, P. J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 2876-2884). These proteoglycans have been called PG I and PG II. Since they were first described, they have also been called "biglycan" (PG I), "decorin," and "DS-PG" (PG II). This report describes the primary structure of PG I from bovine articular cartilage. The protein core consists of 331 amino acids with a molecular mass of 37,280 Da. The amino acid sequence shows 55% identity to the cDNA-derived sequence of PG II from bovine bone. There are four discrete domains in the amino acid sequence. Domain 1, at the NH2 terminus (approximately 23 amino acids), contains two sites of attachment of dermatan sulfate, both of which match the consensus sequence of Asp/Glu-X-X-Ser-Gly-hydrophobic. Neither of these sites is substituted to 100% with glycosaminoglycan in native PG I. Domain 2, near the NH2 terminus and containing approximately 28 amino acids, has a cysteine pattern similar to a domain near the COOH terminus of mouse metallothionein and contains at least one disulfide bond (between the first and fourth cysteine residues). The majority of the core protein of PG I (domain 3) is a leucine-rich domain containing ten repeating units (approximately 231 amino acids). Patthy [1987) J. Mol. Biol. 198, 567-577) has shown that for PG II, the majority of domain 3 shows considerable similarity to leucine-rich alpha 2-glycoprotein (LRG) from serum. Domain 2 of PG I or PG II also has an analog in LRG, in that it has two cysteines in a similar place. The major motif in the PG I described here, in PG II and in LRG, is a series of leucine-rich repeats. PG I and PG II both contain 10 leucine-rich repeats which are 14 amino acids long and which are somewhat irregularly spaced, while LRG contains 9 leucine-rich repeats spaced 10 amino acids apart. Other proteins which contain leucine repeats are the platelet glycoprotein Ib, which is involved in platelet adherence to subendothelium (eight repeats in the alpha chain and two in the beta chain), the protein encoded by the Toll gene (involved in lateral and ventral spatial organization in Drosophila) and chaoptin (a protein involved in Drosophila photoreceptor morphogenesis).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
