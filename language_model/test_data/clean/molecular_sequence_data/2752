Activation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor kinase leads to autophosphorylation and to the phosphorylation of various cellular substrates. The three known autophosphorylation sites of EGF receptor are located at the carboxyl-terminal tail where they probably act to compete with and thus modulate substrate phosphorylation. Mutational analysis and microsequencing techniques have been used to localize and identify new autophosphorylation site(s) of the EGF receptor. We have compared the phosphopeptide maps of human EGF receptor, and two deletion mutants lacking 63 and 126 amino acids from the carboxyl-terminal tail with the phosphopeptide maps of HER/neu and a chimeric EGF receptor containing the carboxyl-terminal tail of HER2/neu. HER2/neu is highly homologous to the EGF receptor, and it probably functions as a growth factor receptor for as yet unidentified growth factor. On the basis of this analysis, we have concluded that all autophosphorylation sites of EGF receptor and HER2/neu are located in their carboxyl-terminal tails. Utilizing the EGF receptors with carboxyl-terminal deletions, we were also able to identify tyr1086 as an additional autophosphorylation site of EGF receptor. Direct microsequencing of a phosphorylated tryptic peptide from the human EGF receptor confirmed this assignment.
