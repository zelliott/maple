Intermolecular enzyme complementation assay is a useful method for detecting protein-protein interactions. Specifically, bioluminescent signals produced from reconstructed split luciferase fragments are powerful tools for in vivo analysis because the bioluminescent signals have been visualized both in cultured cells and living animals. However, they are limited for detection and evaluation of biological events relevant to intermolecular protein-protein interactions. In this study, we constructed an intramolecular luciferase complementation probe for detecting target biomolecules other than protein-protein interactions. It consists of peptide-inserted firefly luciferase (PI-FLuc) containing a short peptide between internally divided firefly luciferase. The inserted short peptide triggers FLuc complementation or discomplementation and subsequent reactivation or inactivation of FLuc activity through its induced fit conformational changes. We chose RNA binding arginine rich motif (ARM) peptides, Rev and/or Tat, for model peptide insertion, and expressed constructed PI-FLuc probe variants using a wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system. They showed FLuc activity changes, reactivation, or inactivation after binding to their specific RNA targets. Furthermore, to expand the versatility of the PI-FLuc RNA detection system, we designed split-RNA probes built to reform the ARM peptide binding site in the presence of arbitrarily selected target-RNA. As a result, the target RNA was homogeneously detected by FLuc luminescent signals mediated by a cooperative function of the PI-FLuc and split-RNA probe sets.
