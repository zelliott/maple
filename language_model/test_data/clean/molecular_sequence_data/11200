Cyclins play an essential role in the control of the cell cycle. In this study the murine cyclin G1 gene expression, structure, and chromosomal localization were examined. Genes with high homology to murine cyclin G1 were detected in various mammals, including human, monkey, rat, dog, cow, and rabbit, but not in yeast or chicken. Cyclin G1 gene was expressed in all murine tissues examined, with the highest levels in cardiac and skeletal muscle. A 10,366-bp genomic DNA fragment encompassing the promoter region and the 5'-flanking region of the gene was cloned and sequenced. Three putative binding sites for the myocyte enhancer factor-2 family of transcription factors were revealed. Furthermore, an upstream p53-binding site was localized to nucleotides -252 to -233 and a new putative p53-binding site was identified in the first intronic region at nucleotides 275 to 294. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, the cyclin G1 gene was mapped to mouse chromosome 11B1.1. This region is homologous with human chromosome 5q31-q32, consistent with the recent mapping of the human cyclin G1 gene to chromosome 5q32-q34. Localization of murine cyclin G1 will facilitate determination of gene linkage and the identification of synteny groups in mammals and of DNA elements in or near this gene that mediate its tissue expression or development-specific pattern of expression.
