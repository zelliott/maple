Two MHC class I cDNA sequences from the tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri), Tube-W01 and Tube-W02, have been isolated which are probably derived from classical class I genes. Expression of the tupaia class I genes was investigated in several organs, in particular the brain, in which slightly different amounts of class I transcripts are detectable in different areas. Gene tree analysis performed with Tube-W01 and Tube-W02, and including class I sequences derived from other orders, indicated that the tupaia sequences cluster differently from Primates, Carnivora, Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla, and Rodentia, but might be related to Lagomorpha class I genes.
