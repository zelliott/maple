The beta-thymosins are N-terminally acetylated peptides of about 5 kDa molecular mass and composed of about 40-44 amino acid residues. The first member of the family, thymosin beta4, was initially isolated from thymosin fraction 5, prepared in five steps from calf thymus. Thymosin beta4 was supposed to be specifically produced and released by the thymic gland and to possess hormonal activities modulating the immune response. Various paracrine effects have indeed been reported for these peptides such as cardiac protection, angiogenesis, stimulation of wound healing, and hair growth. Besides these paracrine effects, it was noted that beta-thymosins occur in high concentration in the cytoplasm of many eukaryotic cells and bind to the cytoskeletal component actin. Subsequently it became apparent from in vitro experiments that they preferentially bind to monomeric (G-)actin and stabilize it in its monomeric form. Due to this ability the beta-thymosins are the main intracellular actin sequestering factor, i.e., they posses the ability to remove monomeric actin from the dynamic assembly and disassembly processes of the actin cytoskeleton that constantly occur in activated cells. In this review we will concentrate on the intracellular activity and localization of the beta-thymosins, i.e., their modulating effect on the actin cytoskeleton.
