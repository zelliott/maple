Many DNA-binding proteins that are involved in the differential regulation of gene expression are composed of multiple discrete modules. Association of the homeobox-encoded helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif with conserved modules, such as the paired box or the POU domain, has led to the definition of structurally and functionally related subfamilies of regulatory proteins. The zinc finger, which is the second major nucleic acid-binding motif characterized to date, defines large multigene families in higher eukaryotes; we have isolated more than 100 Xenopus finger protein-encoding cDNAs and in this study we show that at least 10 of these clones share extensive sequence homologies in a region of more than 200 amino acids in the N-terminal nonfinger portion of the predicted proteins, which is connected to variable finger clusters. We refer to this element as a finger-associated boxes (FAX) domain. Cross-hybridization with human genomic DNA indicates that the finger-associated boxes domain is evolutionary conserved. Northern blot analysis shows that the corresponding genes are differentially expressed in the course of early Xenopus embryogenesis.
