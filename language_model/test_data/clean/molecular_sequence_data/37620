Superoxide dismutase (Sod) plays an important role in all aerobic organisms. The sodB gene of a heterocystous cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 was cloned and sequenced. The Sod protein is predicted to have 199 amino acids and a molecular mass of 22.5 kDa. Sequence comparison among SodB from cyanobacteria and chloroplasts revealed that the sodB gene indeed encodes an iron-Sod. Northern blot analysis showed that the sodB gene of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 is transcribed as a single gene and its expression was up-regulated when the cells were subjected to a shift from a nitrogen repletion condition to a nitrogen depletion condition.
