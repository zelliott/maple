The molecular properties of substance P (SP) (Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro-Gln-Gln-Phe-Phe-Gly-Leu-Met amide) and three of its antagonists were derived by measuring the Gibbs adsorption isotherm, providing information on the surface activity, the molecular shape, and the pK values of the different molecules. The following three antagonists were investigated: [D-Arg1,D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9,Leu11]SP, ANT I; [D-Arg1,D-Trp7,9,Leu11]SP, ANT II and [D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9]SP, ANT III. SP is only moderately surface active. The amino acid substitutions lead, however, to an increased surface activity of the antagonists. From the concentration dependence of the surface activity it was possible to quantify the packing characteristics of the individual neuropeptides. SP shows cross-sectional areas of 300 +/- 5 A2 to 240 +/- 5 A2 (pH 5 to 8, 154 mM NaCl) at concentrations below 10(-5) M, i.e., in the physiological concentration range, indicating a folded SP conformation. Upon increasing the packing density to concentrations larger than 10(-5) M the surface area was only half as large (148 +/- 5 A2 to 124 +/- 3 A2) suggesting now a relatively extended conformation of the SP molecule with its long molecular axis perpendicular to the air/water interface. In contrast, the three antagonists were characterized by surface areas of 147 +/- 3 A2 to 126 +/- 3 A2 which were almost independent of concentration. The antagonists thus adopt a relatively extended conformation in the whole concentration range measured. This is further supported by computer modelling which shows that the antagonists are motionally restricted and can adopt neither a bent nor a alpha-helical conformation. The surface activity of the neuropeptides was dependent on the pH of the solution. At low peptide concentrations (about 10(-6) M) it was possible to resolve and determine the pK values of all individual charged amino acid side chains. The pK values observed for the neuropeptides were about two pK units lower than those of the free amino acids in solution. The pK shifts of the neuropeptides at the air/water interface are explained in terms of the Gouy-Chapman theory. SP and its antagonists bind to lipid bilayers in the order of their surface activity. While the binding of SP is mainly due to electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic peptide-lipid interactions contribute to the binding of the antagonists.
