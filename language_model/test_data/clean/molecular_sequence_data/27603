The complete coding region of the human androgen receptor gene has been isolated from a genomic library. The information for the androgen receptor was found to be divided over eight exons and the total length of the gene exceeded 90 kb. The sequence encoding the N-terminal region is present in one large exon. The two putative DNA-binding fingers are encoded separately by two small exons. The information for the hormone-binding domain is split over five exons. Positions of introns are identical to those reported for the chicken progesterone receptor and the human oestrogen receptor genes. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA with various specific probes reveal that the human androgen receptor is encoded by a single-copy gene.
