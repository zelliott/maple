The human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y was used to demonstrate morphine-induced down-regulation and naloxone-induced up-regulation of opiate receptors in a mu receptor containing neuronally derived preparation capable of desensitization to morphine. Chronic exposure to morphine decreased the number but not the affinity of mu opiate receptors in SH-SY5Y cells. Differentiation of the cells with retinoic acid or with the phorbol agent TPA (12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate) increased the number of mu receptors. Morphine-induced down-regulation, however, was observed in the absence of differentiation as well as after differentiation with retinoic acid or TPA. The decrease in the number of receptors was related to time of exposure, with a half-maximum disappearance time (T1/2) of about 3 hr during the initial phase. The receptor decrease was near maximum at 24 hr with no further significant change up to 72 hr. The loss of [3H] DAMGO ([3H]Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-N-Me-Phe-Gly-ol) binding was also dose-dependent, with reductions occurring at 0.3, 1 and 10 microM. The loss of receptors was dependent on temperature, with reductions at 37 but not 23 degrees C. The down-regulation was blocked by naloxone and the mu-selective antagonist CTOP (D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D(-Trp-)Orn-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2), but not by the delta antagonist ICI 174864 ([N,N-diallyl-Tyr1,Aib2,3]Leu-enkephalin). Cholinergic ([3H]quinclidinyl benzilate) binding was not affected by the morphine treatment, indicating that the down-regulation was homologous for opiate receptors. In SH-SY5Y cells, unlike other cell models, the opiate antagonist naloxone upregulated mu receptors by more than 50%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
