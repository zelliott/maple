1. Long neurotoxin S4C6 from Aspidelaps scutatus venom was purified by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography (Joubert, 1987). 2. It contains 68 amino acids including 10 half-cystines. The toxicity of toxin S4C6 was determined and a LD50 of 0.13 +/- 0.04 micrograms/g mouse was found. 3. The complete primary structure of long neurotoxin S4C6 has been elucidated. In the toxin the 10 structurally invariant amino acids of the neurotoxins and cytoxins and the five functionally invariant amino acids of the neurotoxins are conserved.
