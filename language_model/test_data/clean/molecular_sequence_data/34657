The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of eight influenza A virus (H5N1) isolates obtained from various avian species in Thailand in 2003-2004 have been characterized in comparison with the Thai isolate A/Chicken/Nakorn-Pathom/Thailand/CU-K2/04(H5N1). Phylogenetic analyses of both genes revealed that all the eight avian isolates were closely related to the A/Chicken/Nakorn-Pathom/Thailand/CU-K2/ 04(H5N1). The amino acid sequence of the HA cleavage site revealed a common characteristic of a highly pathogenic virus strain. Moreover, a deletion of 20 amino acids in the NA stalk region was detected in all Thai isolates in contrast to the H5N1 strain that had caused outbreaks in eastern Asia in 1996-1997 and 2000-2001.
