Fractionation of the hot water extract of Chlorella pyrenoidosa was performed using a combination of ethanol precipitation, size exclusion chromatography, and anion exchange chromatography. One fraction contained a new polysaccharide, and this compound was shown to be a 1-->2-linked beta-d-galactofuranan from its 1D and 2D (1)H and (13)C NMR spectra, with a molecular weight of 15 kDa from DOSY NMR measurements. A number of other fractions were shown to have the same repeating unit as the previously identified arabinogalactan. However, arabinogalactans from different fractions were shown by DOSY NMR to have different molecular weights, which ranged from 27 to 1020 kDa. Agreement with molecular weights measured for some of these fractions by SEC-MALS was very good, further confirming the relationship established by Viel et al. between molecular weights of neutral polysaccharides and self-diffusion coefficients. The smaller molecular weight polysaccharides, the galactofuranan and the 27 and 50 kDa arabinogalactans, were shown to be close to monodisperse by analysis of the distributions of the self-diffusion coefficients for the polymers. The larger arabinogalactans had considerable variation in their molecular weights (188 +/- 109 kDa and 1020 +/- 370 kDa). Only the two larger arabinogalactans showed immunostimulatory activity.
