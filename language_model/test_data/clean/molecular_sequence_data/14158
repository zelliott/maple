Microsatellite markers were characterized for an Antarctic endemic, Buellia frigida, to investigate population structure and origin of Antarctic lichens.

Five primer sets were characterized. All loci were polymorphic with eight to 16 alleles per locus in a sample of 59 lichens.

The microsatellite markers potentially provide insight into population structure and gene flow of B. frigida.
