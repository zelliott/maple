Using a newly constructed minitransposon with a phoA reporter gene in a Salmonella enteritidis phoN mutant, we have identified an iron- and pH-inducible lipoprotein gene sfbA, which is a component of a novel ABC-type transporter system required for virulence. This gene is located on a 4 kb Salmonella-specific chromosomal segment, which constitutes a new pathogenicity islet. This islet encodes an outer membrane protein, OmpX, and contains the operon designated sfbABC (Salmonella ferric binding) encoding a putative periplasmic iron-binding lipoprotein SfbA, a nucleotide-binding ATPase SfbB and a cytoplasmic permease SfbC, as predicted by their characteristic signature sequences. Inactivation of the sfbA gene resulted in a mutant that is avirulent and induces protective immunity in BALB/c mice. The wild-type phenotype could be restored by in vivo complementation with the sfbABC operon. This novel transporter might be involved in iron uptake in Salmonella.
