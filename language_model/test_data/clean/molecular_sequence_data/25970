An oligopeptide, L-arginyl-glycyl-L-aspartyl-L-serine, having cell attachment activity was synthesized from the respective aminoacids carrying suitable protecting residues, by using carboxymethyl polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified proteases in organic solvents. Papain, trypsin, and alpha-chymotrypsin were modified with PEG. Organic solvents used were 1,1,1-trichloroethane, chloroform and chloroform/ethyl cellosolve (1:1) mixture. Identification of the products was done by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and thin layer chromatography (TLC).
