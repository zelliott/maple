Evi5 is a common site of retroviral integration in T-cell lymphomas of AKXD mice. Mapping studies have localized Evi5 to a region approximately 18 kb upstream of another common viral integration site, Gfi1, on mouse chromosome 5 (Liao X, Jenkins NA and Copeland NG, (1995a). J. Virol., 69, 7132-7137). Gfi1 encodes a zinc finger transcription factor involved in interleukin-2 signaling. To determine if Evi5 encodes a gene separate from Gfi1 that might also be involved in T-cell disease, we have searched within the Evi5 locus for novel transcripts. A 6.0 kb transcript was identified in these studies that spans the Evi5 locus and is disrupted by viral integration at Evi5. This transcript is expressed in all embryonic and adult mouse tissues examined. While blast searches indicated that Evi5 is a novel gene, homologies were detected between Evi5 and a known oncogene, Tre2, as well as mammalian and yeast cell cycle regulatory proteins. Evi5 thus encodes a gene separate from Gfi1 that may also be involved in T-cell disease.
