We report here the complete genomic sequence of a novel porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) strain, which is supposed to be the result of natural genetic recombination between the ORF1 gene of genotype PCV2b-1B and the ORF2 gene of PCV2b-1C. Further analyses revealed that this novel PCV2 strain arose from recombination between PCV2a and PCV2b strains within the ORF2 gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report of both inter- and intragenotype PCV2 gene rearrangement in the field, and it will help in understanding the epidemiology and molecular characteristics of porcine circovirus type 2(PCV2) in southern China.
