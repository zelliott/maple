A cDNA encoding a small heat shock protein of Trichinella spiralis, Ts-sHsp, was cloned and expressed and is herein characterized. This cDNA encoded a predicted protein of 165 amino acids, which had a high sequence identity in alpha crystallin domain with various small heat shock proteins of other organisms. A Western blot analysis indicated that anti-Ts-sHsp recombinant antibody recognized the protein of adults and larvae migrating at about 19 kDa. An in situ localization study showed the protein to be abundantly present in the body wall muscle cells, hypodermis, stichocytes, and esophagus of muscle larvae. The Ts-sHsp recombinant protein possessed chaperone activity to suppress the thermally-induced aggregation of citrate synthase. This sHsp was expressed at various developmental stages of T. spiralis, but at different levels. A high level was observed in mature muscle larvae (infective larvae), which was much higher than the levels seen in adults, newborn larvae, or immature muscle larvae. The expression of the sHsp gene was thermal inducible, thus responding to both cold (0 degrees C) and heat shock (43 degrees C) stress; however, at different patterns. The expression of Ts-sHsp increased gradually from 3 to 72 h after cold stress, while the expression was elevated to its highest after 3 h heat stress and then decreased. These results suggest that this small heat shock protein likely plays a role in the tolerance to both chemical and physical stresses, thereby enhancing the survival ability of Trichinella muscle larvae.
