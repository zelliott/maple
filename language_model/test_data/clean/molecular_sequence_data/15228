During a survey of myxosporean parasites of cyprinid fish in Hungary, infections caused by unknown Myxobolus spp. were found in the internal organs of rudd, Scardinius erythrophthalmus, and bleak, Alburnus alburnus. Small plasmodia developed in blood vessels of the kidney, liver, testes and intestinal wall. The parasites were studied on the basis of spore morphology and by histological and molecular methods. In most cases, plasmodia were surrounded by host tissue without a host reaction; however, in advanced cases, a connective tissue capsule was seen around plasmodia. Spores collected from the two fish species differed from each other and from the known Myxobolus spp. both in their morphology and 18S rDNA sequences. The two species, described as M. erythrophthalmi sp. n. from rudd and M. shaharomae sp. n. from bleak, are characterized by a specific histotropism to blood vessels, while the organ specificity involves the kidney and for the latter species, most internal organs.
