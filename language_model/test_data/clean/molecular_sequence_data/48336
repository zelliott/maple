11Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD11B) catalyzes the interconversion between active and inactive glucocorticoid, and is known to exist as two distinct isozymes: HSD11B1 and HSD11B2. A third HSD11B isozyme, HSD11B1L (SCDR10b), has recently been identified. Human HSD11B1L, which was characterized as a unidirectional NADP(+)-dependent cortisol dehydrogenase, appears to be specifically expressed in the brain. We previously reported that HSD11B1 and abundant HSD11B2 isozymes are expressed in neonatal pig testis and the Km for cortisol of NADP(+)-dependent dehydrogenase activity of testicular microsomes obviously differs from the same activity catalyzed by HSD11B1 from pig liver microsomes. Therefore, we hypothesized that the neonatal pig testis also expresses the third type of HSD11B isozyme, and we herein examined further evidence regarding the expression of HSD11B1L. (1) The inhibitory effects of gossypol and glycyrrhetinic acid on pig testicular microsomal NADP(+)-dependent cortisol dehydrogenase activity was clearly different from that of pig liver microsomes. (2) A highly conserved human HSD11B1L sequence was observed by RT-PCR in a pig testicular cDNA library. (3) mRNA, which contains the amplified sequence, was evaluated by real-time PCR and was most strongly expressed in pig brain, and at almost the same levels in the kidney as in the testis, but at lower levels in the liver. Based on these results, neonatal pig testis appears to express glycyrrhetinic acid-resistant HSD11B1L as a third HSD11B isozyme, and it may play a physiologically important role in cooperation with the abundantly expressed HSD11B2 isozyme in order to prevent Leydig cell apoptosis or GC-mediated suppression of testosterone production induced by high concentrations of activated GC in neonatal pig testis.
