The translation initiation of Escherichia coli mRNAs is known to be facilitated by a cis element upstream of the initiation codon, called the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence. This sequence complementary to the 3' end of 16 S rRNA enhances the formation of the translation initiation complex of the 30 S ribosomal subunit with mRNAs. It has been debated that a cis element called the downstream box downstream of the initiation codon, in addition to the SD sequence, facilitates formation of the translation initiation complex; however, conclusive evidence remains elusive. Here, we show evidence that the downstream box plays a major role in the enhancement of translation initiation in concert with SD.
