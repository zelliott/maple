CCR5 and CXCR4 usage has been studied extensively with a variety of clade B human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates. The determinants of CCR5 coreceptor function are remarkably consistent, with a region critical for fusion and entry located in the CCR5 amino-terminal domain (Nt). In particular, negatively charged amino acids and sulfated tyrosines in the Nt are essential for gp120 binding to CCR5. The same types of residues are important for CXCR4-mediated viral fusion and entry, but they are dispersed throughout the extracellular domains of CXCR4, and their usage is isolate dependent. Here, we report on the determinants of CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptor function for a panel of non-clade B isolates that are responsible for the majority of new HIV-1 infections worldwide. Consistent with clade B isolates, CXCR4 usage remains isolate dependent and is determined by the overall content of negatively charged and tyrosine residues. Residues in the Nt of CCR5 that are important for fusion and entry of clade B isolates are also important for the entry of all non-clade B HIV-1 isolates that we tested. Surprisingly, we found that in contrast to clade B isolates, a cluster of residues in the second extracellular loop of CCR5 significantly affects fusion and entry of all non-clade B isolates tested. This points to a different mechanism of CCR5 usage by these viruses and may have important implications for the development of HIV-1 inhibitors that target CCR5 coreceptor function.
