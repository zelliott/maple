A novel microsatellite homologous to DYS391, a (GATA)(n) short tandem repeat on the human Y chromosome, was identified and characterized in the present work. Employing somatic cell hybrid and deletion panels in a PCR-based approach, we found out that the new microsatellite is located in Xp21.2-22.3, while its Y counterpart mapped to Yq11.21. This X-linked locus (provisionally called DXYS391) and its Y homolog constitute one more example of similarity outside the pseudoautosomal regions between the two human sex chromosomes. Sequencing data showed high levels of homology in the flanking regions of DXYS391 and DYS391 that differ primarily by the presence of a (GACA)(3) motif in the Y locus. Both loci were detected in chimpanzee DNA, suggesting that a putative transposition from the X to the Y occurred before the human/chimpanzee split. The allele frequencies of DYS391 and DXYS391 were investigated, respectively, in 271 Y and 337 X chromosomes from distinct human populations worldwide. DYS391 consistently displayed greater among-population component of the variance of the allele frequencies than DXYS391, as expected due to the three-times lower effective population size of Y chromosomes relative to the X. The intra-population diversity of DYS391, measured by Nei's locus diversity as well as by allele size variance, was lowest in Amerindians, while very low diversity of DXYS391 was seen in Africans. Since our African data are based on a small sample, further studies will be necessary to evaluate better this observation.
