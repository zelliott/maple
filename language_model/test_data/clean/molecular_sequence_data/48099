An 11-residue peptide (FQWQRNMRKVR) homologous to just over half the loop region of human lactoferricin is thought to be responsible for antimicrobial properties of human lactoferricin. Multiple antigen peptides (MAP) of the 11-residue peptide exerted significant antibacterial effects against a broad spectrum of bacteria including MRSA. More than eight branching was favourable for increasing its antibacterial activity. Our report shows a novel possibility for MAP to increase the activity of antibiotic peptides other than simply to stimulate antibody production, as reported so far.
