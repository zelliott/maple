Heme-hemopexin or cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP)-hemopexin (a model ligand for hemopexin receptor occupancy) is shown to increase transcription of the metallothionein-1 (MT-1) gene by activation of a signaling pathway. Promoter deletion analysis followed by transient transfection assays show that 110 base pairs (-153 to -43) of 5'-flanking region of the murine MT-1 promoter are sufficient for increasing transcription in response to heme-hemopexin or to CoPP-hemopexin in mouse hepatoma cells. The protein kinase C inhibitor, 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (H7), prevented the increase in MT-1 transcription by heme-hemopexin, CoPP-hemopexin, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, but the protein kinase A inhibitor, HA1004, was without effect. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) and glutathione, as well as superoxide dismutase and catalase, inhibited both the increase in endogenous MT-1 mRNA and the activation of reporter gene activity by heme-hemopexin, CoPP-hemopexin, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. In sum, these data suggest that reactive oxygen intermediates are generated by heme-hemopexin via events associated with receptor binding, including protein kinase C activation. Induction of heme oxygenase-1 expression, in contrast to MT-1, is significantly less sensitive to NAC. Deletion and mutation analyses of the MT-1 proximal promoter revealed that the sequence 5'-GTGACTATGC-3' (from -98 to -89 base pairs) is, in part, responsible for the hemopexin-mediated regulation of MT-1 which is inhibited by H7. Regulation via this element is also induced by H2O2 showing that it is an antioxidant response element. Heme itself acts via more distal elements on the MT-1 promoter. In contrast to NAC and glutathione, diethyl dithiocarbamate and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, which inactivate reactive oxygen intermediates and chelate Zn(II), synergistically augment the induction of MT-1 mRNA levels and reporter gene activity in response to heme-hemopexin via the antioxidant response element by both metal-responsive element-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
