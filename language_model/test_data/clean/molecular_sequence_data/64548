A dramatic rise in the number of resistant Campylobacter to quinolones has been documented in human patients and domestic animals. In this study, the mechanism of acquisition of quinolone resistance was studied by detecting point mutations in the gyrA gene of Campylobacter strains obtained from broilers and strains with in vitro-induced resistance. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of norfloxacin (NFLX) and ofloxacin (OFLX) for the strains that had no point mutation were slightly increased from the source strain (Campylobacter jejuni ATCC 33560). The MICs of nalidixic acid (NA), NFLX, and OFLX for the strains that had the point mutation at Thr-86 were 100 or 200 microg/ml, 50 microg/ml, and 25 microg/ml, respectively. The MIC of NA for the strain that had a point mutation at Asp-90 higher than those for the strains that had the point mutation at Thr-86, but the MICs of NFLX and OFLX were relatively lower than those for the strains that had point mutation at Thr-86. These findings suggest that the degree of antimicrobial resistance against NA, NFLX, and OFLX in the in vitro-induced C. jejuni strains was associated with the location of the point mutation in gyrA. On the other hand, a point mutation in all seven resistant strains isolated from broilers was located only at Thr-86, while the MICs of the three quinolones varied in each wild strain. This suggests that another mechanism might also be involved in the acquisition of quinolone resistance in C. jejuni wild strains.
