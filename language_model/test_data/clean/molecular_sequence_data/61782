LMV-Common and LMV-Most are two seed-borne types of Lettuce mosaic virus (LMV), genus Potyvirus. LMV-Most, but not LMV-Common, overcomes the resistance afforded to lettuce by two recessive genes, mo11 and mo12. An RT-PCR-based assay thought to be specific for LMV-Most also amplified LMV-Tn2, previously typified as LMV-Common. The sequence of selected regions along the genome indicated that LMV-Tn2 is a natural recombinant between LMV-Most and LMV-Common isolates, with a putative recombination site located within the P3 coding region. This is the first evidence of a naturally occurring LMV recombinant isolate.
