Flupirtine, trade name Katadolon, is a centrally acting nonopioid analgesic that has recently been found to display cytoprotective activity in vitro and in vivo on neurons induced to undergo apoptosis. This report shows that the PrP106-126 fragment of the prion protein, which is the likely etiological agent for a series of encephalopathies, is toxic to cortical neurons in vitro. Simultaneously, PrP106-126 influences the molecular GSH content and the bcl-2 expression in neurons. Significant toxicity (32% reduction in cell viability) was observed at a concentration of 50 microM of the peptide after 9 days of incubation, while at higher concentrations toxicity increased to 70%. Neurotoxicity was greatly reduced following coincubation with 1 to 3 microg/ml flupirtine. Concomitant with PrP106-126-mediated cytotoxicity, glutathione (GSH) content fell by > 70% with respect to untreated controls. This decrease in GSH level was strongly blocked by flupirtine under incubation conditions that reduce cell toxicity. In addition to normalizing GSH content, flupirtine induced the expression of the anti-apoptotically acting proto-oncogene bcl-2. Based on these in vitro data and on the favorable pharmacokinetic profile of the drug, we strongly suggest that flupirtine may prove useful for treatment of patients with prion disease.
