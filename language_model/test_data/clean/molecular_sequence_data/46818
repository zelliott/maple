Transport of glucose across the plasma membrane of mammary epithelial cells is believed to be a passive process of facilitated diffusion mediated by facilitative glucose transporter(s). This article presents three lines of evidence that indicate the expression of sodium/glucose cotransporter (SGLT1) in the mammary gland of lactating and nonlactating cows. First, transcripts of SGLT1 mRNA ranging in size from 1.5 to 5.2 kb were detected in polyadenylated RNA preparations of mammary glands of lactating and nonlactating cows. Second, SGLT1 cotransporter protein was also detected in plasma membrane preparations of mammary glands of lactating cows. Third, partial amino acid sequence deduced from the reverse transcriptase-PCR fragment of SGLT1 from bovine mammary glands was similar to the sequence reported for ovine SGLT1. We conclude that mammary gland expression of SGLT1 mRNA and protein suggests that an active glucose transport system may be involved in glucose transport and metabolism in the mammary gland of dairy cows. However, the physiological significance of the expression of SGLT1 in mammary gland remains unknown.
