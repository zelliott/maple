The primary structure of rat chromogranin A has been deduced from a rat adrenal cDNA clone. A comparison of rat and bovine chromogranin A reveals similar features: clusters of polyglutamic acid, similar amino acid composition, position of seven of 10 pairs of basic amino acids, identical placement of the only two cysteine residues, a highly conserved N- and C-terminus, and a sequence homologous to porcine pancreastatin 1-49 [(1986) Nature 324, 476-478]. Unique features of rat chromogranin A are an eicosaglutamine sequence and two potential N-linked glycosylation sites. Chromogranin A mRNA is detectable in adrenal medulla, anterior pituitary, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus, as well as tumor cell lines derived from pancreas, pituitary, and adrenal medulla.
