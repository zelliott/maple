Myotoxin a, a small basic polypeptide isolated from the venom of prairie rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis viridis), has been shown to bind to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase. The attachment of myotoxin a to Ca(2+)-ATPase is believed to cause uncoupling of the calcium pump. In order to further elucidate which portion of myotoxin a is important for the uncoupling action, five peptides were synthesized and two peptide fragments were obtained by chemical cleavage. These peptides correspond to discrete portions of the primary sequence of myotoxin a. The peptides are equivalent to the primary sequence of myotoxin a from 1 to 16 residues, 7 to 22 residues, 13 to 28 residues, 19 to 34 residues, and 25 to 42 residues. Chemically produced fragments are equivalent to 1 to 28 residues and 29 to 42 residues of myotoxin a. Peptides of the sequences "YKQCHKKGGHCFPKEK" and "LGKMDCRWKWKCCKKGSG" of myotoxin a inhibited 45Ca uptake into isolated SR and bound to Ca(2+)-ATPase. The same peptides caused weak skeletal muscle vacuolization similar to that caused by native myotoxin a and increased serum creatine kinase activity. The active peptides correspond to the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of myotoxin a. The inactive or less active peptides have sequences which correspond to the middle sequence of myotoxin a. From this study, both the N-terminal and the C-terminal regions of primary sequence of myotoxin a are required to express myotoxin a's biological activity.
