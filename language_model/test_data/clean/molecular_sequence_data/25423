A chemical robot capable of performing enzymatic reactions and extraction processes of DNA has been developed. The basic functions of this robot include handling of plastic tubes with caps, micropipetting, mixing, microcentrifuging and incubating. As a result, almost all of the pre-electrophoresis steps can be carried out. In addition, because these processes are automated, the working time of each process can be reduced. The reproducibility of the automated operation is equivalent to that of a skilled operator.
