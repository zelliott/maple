Strains of Caenorhabditis elegans mutant for clk-1 exhibit a 20-40% increase in mean lifespan. clk-1 encodes a mitochondrial protein thought to be either an enzyme or regulatory molecule acting within the ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway. Here CLK-1 is shown to be related to the ubiquinol oxidase, alternative oxidase, and belong to the functionally diverse di-iron-carboxylate protein family which includes bacterioferritin and methane mono-oxygenase. Construction and analysis of a homology model indicates CLK-1 is a 2-polyprenyl-3-methyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone mono-oxygenase as originally predicted. Analysis of known CLK-1/Coq7p mutations also supports this notion. These findings raise the possibility of developing CLK-1-specific inhibitors to test for lifespan extension in higher organisms.
