The reaction between human 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase and the anti-epileptic drug 4-aminohex-5-enoate, an irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme, has been studied using the radiolabelled compound. The inactivated enzyme was found to lose radiolabel over a period of a few days at 37 degrees C but even in the presence of the coenzyme, pyridoxal phosphate, no enzyme activity returned. At 4 degrees C the radiolabelled inhibitor remained stably bound. The amount of enzyme-bound 4-aminohex-5-enoate was significantly less than would be expected if one mol of inhibitor was bound per mol of active site. Reversed phase chromatography of a tryptic digest of the labelled enzyme showed that, apart from material eluting at the front of the chromatogram, all of the radioactivity was in a single fraction. This fraction contained a peptide, the sequence of which indicated that it included the lysine that binds the coenzyme and that the major release of radioactivity occurred in an Edman degradation cycle corresponding to this residue.
