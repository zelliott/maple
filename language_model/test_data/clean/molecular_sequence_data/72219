Using PCR with pools of primers based on conserved sequences in chemokine receptors, we have cloned a human member of the G-protein-coupled receptor gene family. The new gene, which we have named STRL22, is predicted to encode a receptor related to chemokine receptors, including IL8RA (CXCR1), IL8RB (CXCR2), and CXCR4/fusin, and to the orphan receptors EBI1 and BLR1. Consistent with a role in leukocyte biology, STRL22 is expressed in lymphocytes and in lymphoid tissue. We have mapped STRL22 to chromosome 6q27. STRL22 cDNAs reflect alternative (or incomplete) mRNA processing in the 5'-nontranslated region, a phenomenon found in analysis of other chemoattractant receptor genes. In contrast to most chemokine receptor genes, the STRL22 coding sequence is not limited to a single exon.
