A new lignan 1-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-6-(3-acetyl-4-hydroxy-5-methoxyphenyl)-3,7-dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octane, the secoiridoid 2H-pyran-4-acetic acid,3-hydroxymethyl-2,3-dihydro-5-(methoxycarbonyl)-2-methyl-, methyl ester, the phenylglycoside 4-[beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-->6)]-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-1,4-dihydroxy-2-methoxybenzene and the lactone 3-[1-(hydroxymethyl)-1-propenyl] delta-glutarolactone were isolated and identified on the basis of spectroscopic data including two-dimensional NMR, as components of olive oil mill waste-waters. The known aromatic compounds catechol, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, 2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy)phenylethanol, 2-(3,4-dihydroxy)phenyl-1,2-ethandiol, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, 1-O-[2-(3,4-dihydroxy)phenylethyl]-(3,4-dihydroxy)phenyl-1,2-ethandiol, 1-O-[2-(4-hydroxy)phenylethyl]-(3,4-dihydroxy)phenyl-1,2-ethandiol, D(+)-erythro-1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy)-phenyl-1,2,3-propantriol, p-hydroxyphenethyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside,2(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol 3beta-D-glucopyranoside, and 2(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol 4beta-D-glucopyranoside were also confirmed as constituents of the waste-waters.
