Potato leafroll virus (PLRV) causes one of the most widespread and important virus diseases in potato. Resistance to PLRV is controlled by genetic factors that limit plant infection by viruliferous aphids or virus multiplication and accumulation. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of resistance to virus accumulation revealed one major and two minor QTL. The major QTL, PLRV.1, mapped to potato chromosome XI in a resistance hotspot containing several genes for qualitative and quantitative resistance to viruses and other potato pathogens. This QTL explained between 50 and 60% of the phenotypic variance. The two minor QTL mapped to chromosomes V and VI. Genes with sequence similarity to the tobacco N gene for resistance to Tobacco mosaic virus were tightly linked to PLRV.1. The cDNA sequence of an N-like gene was used to develop the sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker N127(1164) that can assist in the selection of potatoes with resistance to PLRV.
