The glycoprotein envelope surrounding the Xenopus laevis egg is converted from an unfertilizable to a fertilizable form during transit through the pars recta portion of the oviduct. Envelope conversion involves the pars recta protease oviductin, which selectively hydrolyzes envelope glycoprotein gp43 to gp41. Oviductin cDNA was cloned, and sequence analysis revealed that the protease is translated as the N terminus of an unusual mosaic protein. In addition to the oviductin protease domain, a protease domain with low identity to oviductin was present, possessing an apparent nonfunctional catalytic site. Three CUB domains were also present, which are related to the mammalian spermadhesin molecules implicated in mediating sperm-envelope interactions. We propose that during post-translational proteolytic processing of the mosaic oviductin glycoprotein, the processed N-terminal protease domain is released coupled to two C-terminal CUB domains and constitutes the enzymatically active protease molecule. In functional studies, isolated coelomic egg envelopes treated with oviductin purified from the oviduct showed a dramatic increase in sperm binding. This observation established that oviductin alone was the oviductal factor responsible for converting the egg envelope to a sperm-penetrable form, via an increase in sperm binding. Trypsin mimicked oviductin's effect on envelope hydrolysis and sperm binding, demonstrating that gp43 processing is the only requirement for envelope conversion.
