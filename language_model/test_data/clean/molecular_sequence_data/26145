Multiple continuous-flow solid-phase peptide synthesis has been adapted for synthesis of peptides on a cellulose carrier (Whatman 3MM paper). Paper-bound synthetic peptides that represent antigenic determinants of particular proteins detected antibodies against the respective proteins in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The method is applied to the synthesis, and use in site-directed serology, of four peptides derived from the gp41 glycoprotein of HIV, the Epstein-Barr virus-determined nuclear antigen-1 and VCA proteins of the Epstein-Barr virus, and the early region of human papillomavirus type 11.
