Primer walking is a simple and efficient technique to find new microsatellites in the regions adjacent to known sequences. The method was applied to obtaining new microsatellite markers for rat chromosome 10 in the region of a blood pressure quantitative trait locus. Eight microsatellites were found, five of them were polymorphic in at least one population used for mapping. Improved genetic maps of this region for F2(SxMNS) and F2(SxLEW) populatons were constructed.
