To understand the biological function of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of proteins, we have isolated and characterized the gene for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase from Drosophila melanogaster. Two approaches were taken to analyze the function of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction. The first is analysis of the homology of the amino acid sequences of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase from phylogenetically different eukaryotes, namely human, mouse, bovine, chicken, Xenopus laevis and Drosophila melanogaster and elucidation of the conserved amino acid sequences that appear to be important for the function of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Analysis of the recombinant poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase which had truncated or mutated motifs expressed in E coli would confirm the importance of the conserved amino acid sequence. The interaction of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase with other proteins involved in DNA repair, replication, recombination and transcription will clarify the function of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. The second approach is to get the mutants which have disruption in the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase gene and to analyse the phenotypes of these mutants. The characterization of these mutants will be discussed.
