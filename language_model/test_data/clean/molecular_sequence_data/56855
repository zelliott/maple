The nucleotide sequence of the protein core for bovine aortic smooth muscle cell biglycan was determined using recombinant DNA technology. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence for bovine biglycan revealed a striking homology, 94.6% and 95.7%, to human and rat biglycan, respectively. The bovine biglycan protein core has four potential O-linked and two potential N-linked glycosylation sites and is composed of 11 leucine-rich repeat units.
