We have isolated cDNAs of the human gene for high mobility group protein HMG2a, using the method of direct cDNA selection. The gene maps to chromosome band Xq28, and is located within 40 kb from marker DXS1684, at a distance of 5.4 Mb from the telomere. The deduced human HMG2a protein sequence has a length of 199 amino acids and is 97% identical to the sequence of chicken HMG2a. The 3' untranslated regions of the HMG2a gene in both species are highly homologous (87% identical nucleotides), and are even more conserved than the coding sequences (84% identical nucleotides). In addition, a partial cDNA sequence of the putative HMG2a gene from mouse was identified. The 3' untranslated regions from human and mouse are 90% identical. We conclude that the 3' untranslated sequences have been under strong selective pressure during evolution. Whereas expression of the chicken HMG2a gene has previously been demonstrated in liver of newly hatched chicken, the human HMG2a gene is transcribed mainly in placenta.
