We have studied the potential of mean force of two peptides, one known to adopt a beta-hairpin and the other an alpha-helical conformation in solution. These peptides are, respectively, residues 41-56 of the C-terminus (GEWTYDDATKTFTVTE) of the B1 domain of protein G and the 13 residue C-peptide (KETAAAKFERQHM) of ribonuclease A. Extensive canonical ensemble sampling has been performed using a parallel replica exchange method. The effective potential employed in this work consists of the OPLS all-atom force field (OPLS-AA) and an analytical generalized Born (AGB) implicit solvent model including a novel nonpolar solvation free energy estimator (NP). An additional dielectric screening parameter has been incorporated into the AGBNP model. In the case of the beta-hairpin, the nonpolar solvation free energy estimator provides the necessary effective interactions for the collapse of the hydrophobic core (W43, Y45, F52, and V54), which the more commonly used surface-area-dependent nonpolar model does not provide. For both the beta-hairpin and the alpha-helix, increased dielectric screening reduces the stability of incorrectly formed salt bridges, which tend to disrupt the formation of the hairpin and helix, respectively. The fraction of beta-hairpin and alpha-helix content we obtained using the AGBNP model agrees well with experimental results. The thermodynamic stability of the beta-hairpin from protein G and the alpha-helical C-peptide from ribonuclease A as modeled with the OPLS-AA/AGBNP effective potential reflects the balance between the nonpolar effective potential terms, which drive compaction, and the polar and hydrogen bonding terms, which promote secondary structure formation.
