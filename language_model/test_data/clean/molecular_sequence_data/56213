Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a heparin-binding protein, expressing potent mitogenic and angiogenic properties. Elevated levels of bFGF have been identified in human gliomas and glioma cell lines, suggesting that bFGF expression is involved in the aberrant growth patterns associated with these tumors. In the present study, the influence of bFGF on additional parameters of glioma cell malignancy was evaluated utilizing three distinct methods to suppress bFGF expression or activity including antisense oligonucleotide primers, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody or an inhibitor of the agonist action of bFGF: (1) The addition of 30 microM bFGF-specific antisense oligonucleotide primer to the human glioma cell line SNB-19 resulted in a 55% inhibition in colony formation in soft agar. This effect was dose-dependent and specific, as sense strand primer was ineffective in suppressing growth. In addition to exhibiting fewer colonies, antisense treatment significantly altered colony morphology. (2) SNB-19 cell growth in culture was suppressed in the presence of a neutralizing bFGF-specific monoclonal antibody. (3) Inositolhexakisphosphate, a newly identified antagonist of FGF binding and activity, suppressed SNB-19 cell growth in soft agar culture. These results demonstrate that bFGF may regulate glioma growth and progression independent of its role in tumor angiogenesis and that bFGF release or secretion may be required for these actions.
