Secondary endosymbiosis describes the origin of plastids in several major algal groups such as dinoflagellates, euglenoids, heterokonts, haptophytes, cryptomonads, chlorarachniophytes and parasites such as apicomplexa. An integral part of secondary endosymbiosis has been the transfer of genes for plastid proteins from the endosymbiont to the host nucleus. Targeting of the encoded proteins back to the plastid from their new site of synthesis in the host involves targeting across the multiple membranes surrounding these complex plastids. Although this process shows many overall similarities in the different algal groups, it is emerging that differences exist in the mechanisms adopted.
