Biological research related to orthodontics naturally leads to two general areas. One is the investigation of craniofacial growth and development in normal and abnormal circumstances, attempting to understand the etiological basis for the development of malocclusion or dentofacial deformity. The other concerns developing an understanding of the basic mechanisms involved in tooth movement during orthodontic therapy. This paper reviews ongoing research in both areas.
