It is demonstrated that the amino acid sequences of the products of E. coli genes sbcC and prrC, and bacteriophage P2 gene old encompass the four conserved motifs typical of the superfamily of UvrA-related ATPases. A more pronounced statistically significant similarity was revealed between SbcC protein, bacteriophage T4 endonuclease component gp46 and bacteriophage T5 protein D13. It is suggested that the newly identified members of the superfamily might all be ATPase components of the respective nucleases, and that the reactions catalyzed by these enzymes are probably ATP dependent.
