The acid-labile subunit (ALS) is a glycosylated 85-kDa member of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein superfamily and circulates in ternary complexes with the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and their binding proteins (IGFBPs). These complexes are thought to regulate the serum IGFs by restricting IGF movement out of the circulation. However, little is known about how ALS binds to IGFBP-3 or -5, which link the IGFs to ALS. To investigate potential sites of interaction, the ALS structure has been modeled with the crystal structure of the LRR protein porcine ribonuclease inhibitor as a template. ALS is predicted to be a donut-shaped molecule with an internal diameter of 1.7 nm, an external diameter of 7.2 nm, and a thickness of 3.6 nm. These dimensions are supported by rotary shadowing electron microscopy of ALS. The internal face is lined with a substantial region of electronegative surface potential that could interact with the positively charged region on IGFBP-3 known to be involved in ALS binding. The model also predicts that three potential N-linked oligosaccharide sites within the LRR domain are clustered together, which may be important in light of recent studies showing ALS glycan involvement in complex formation with IGFBP-3.
