The first synthesis of maradolipid, a unique dissymmetrically 6,6'-di-O-acylated trehalose glycolipid isolated from C. elegans, is accomplished in five steps starting from trehalose in 45% overall yield. The short synthesis relies on dissymmetrization of trehalose core via regioselective acylation of a 2,3,4,2',3',4'-hexa-O-TMS trehalose 6,6'-diol derivative as a key step.
