Routine serosubtyping of Neisseria meningitidis relies upon reactivity of whole cells to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). This procedure is limited in providing maximum serosubtype information because some epitopes in whole cells are masked and because mAbs are currently unavailable for some epitopes. To address masking of epitopes in whole cells, we isolated outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) from nine representative meningococcal strains that were isolated (1991-1993) in the province of Quebec, Canada; the OMVs were used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for reactivity to mAbs, and improved serosubtyping information was obtained. A recent proposal assigns subtypes based on deduced amino acid sequences in the variable regions of the class 1 outer membrane protein. This scheme maintains the subtyping nomenclature that is based on reactivity to mAbs by defining the sequences in the epitopes recognized by the mAbs. We used this technique to assign subtypes to the meningococcal strains isolated in Quebec. For the strains tested, serosubtyping using mAbs and subtyping based on deduced amino acid sequences were in complete agreement. Subtyping using deduced amino acid sequences is superior because it does not depend on the availability of mAbs.
