The ability of the TGEV transcription initiation sequence (TIS) to produce subgenomic RNAs was investigated by placing a reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) under the control of either the mRNA 6 or the mRNA 7 TISs. Both constructs only produced CAT in TGEV infected cells and the amount of CAT produced from the mRNA 7 TIS was less than from the mRNA 6 TIS. Mutations were made within and around the TISs and the effect on CAT production assayed. THe results showed that the TGEV TIS acted as a initiator of transcription for CAT, though the degree of base pairing between the TIS and leader RNA was not the only factor implicated in the control transcription.
