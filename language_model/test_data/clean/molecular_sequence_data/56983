We have determined the nucleotide (nt) sequence of nat1, a gene encoding nourseothricin (Nc) acetyltransferase (AT) from Streptomyces noursei, and its transcriptional start point (tsp). The nt sequence upstream from the coding region is completely different from that of the stat gene (encoding streptothricin AT) from Streptomyces lavendulae [S. Horinouchi, K. Furuya, M. Nishiyama, H. Suzuki and T. Beppu, J. Bacteriol. 169 (1987) 1929-1937], even though the nt sequences of the two genes and the deduced amino acid (aa) sequences of the two enzymes show a high degree of similarity. Another stat gene, derived from a Gram-negative plasmid, showed only deduced aa similarity, but not nt sequence similarity, to the above two. A database search for related aa sequences did not reveal any clear-cut homologies to other types of protein. A multiple aa sequence alignment of several ATs is presented.
