Two distinct mucin components of saliva, MG1 and MG2, have been identified based on chemical composition and molecular weights (high and low, respectively) in saliva. With the aim of characterizing the expression pattern of salivary mucins, we have prepared monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against the peptide core of MG1 and against a synthetic peptide derived from the MG2 (MUC7) sequence. MAb PANH2 raised against partially deglycosylated MG1 stained a high-molecular-weight smear in Western blots of partially purified MG1. PANH2 binding was increased by deglycosylation with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid as well as with subsequent periodate treatment, and was eliminated by pronase treatment, strongly suggesting that MAb PANH2 was directed to a peptide epitope of MG1. MAb PANH3 raised against a synthetic peptide derived from the MG2 (MUC7) sequence reacted with the native molecule and stained a narrow smear of ca. 200,000 to 210,000 in Western blots of concentrated saliva and a lower-molecular-weight smear of trifluoromethanesulfonic-acid-treated MG2. Immunohistology on frozen sections of human salivary glands showed that MAb PANH2 selectively labeled mucous cells, whereas MAb PANH3 labeled subpopulations of serous cells. Double-direct immunofluorescence staining with PANH2 and PANH3 demonstrated that the staining patterns were non-overlapping. The development of these antibody probes will facilitate studies of mucin expression in diseases of salivary glands.
