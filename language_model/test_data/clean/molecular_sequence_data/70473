The Tapasin molecule plays a role in the assembly of major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum, by mediating the interaction of class I-beta2-microglobulin dimers with TAP. We report here the identification of the Tapasin gene in the chicken Mhc (B complex). This gene is located at the centromeric end of the complex, between the class II B-LBI and B-LBII genes. Like its human counterpart it comprises 8 exons, but features a significantly reduced intron size as compared to the human gene. Chicken Tapasin codes for a transmembrane protein with a probable endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. Exons IV and V, and possibly exon III, code for separate domains that are related to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily (this relationship was so far unrecognized for human Tapasin domain IV which has lost its two cysteines). Two different cDNAs corresponding to the Tapasin gene were isolated, possibly related to alternative splicing events; the Ig-like domain encoded by exon IV is missing in one of the cDNAs, suggesting either that this domain is not necessary for the protein to perform its function, or that the two alternatively spliced cDNAs are translated into two functionally different forms of the protein.
