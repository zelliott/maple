In the present work, we studied the phagocytic and endocytic properties of murine Fc gamma RII in mast cells. Mouse mast cells express high-affinity receptors for monomeric IgE and three low-affinity receptors for complexed IgG: Fc gamma RIIb1, Fc gamma RIIb2, and Fc gamma RIII. In previous studies we showed that, when aggregated by multivalent ligands, murine Fc gamma RIII, but not Fc gamma RII, triggers the release of inflammatory mediators and cytokines by mast cells. Upon Fc gamma R aggregation, mast cells not only release intracellular materials, they also internalize particulate and soluble immune complexes. We compared the ability of the two Fc gamma RII isoforms to trigger phagocytosis and endocytosis in RBL-2H3 cells stably transfected with cDNAs encoding wild-type, deleted, and tyrosine mutant Fc gamma RIIb1 or Fc gamma RIIb2. We found that Fc gamma RIIb2, but not Fc gamma RIIb1, triggered both phagocytosis and endocytosis. We identified distinct intracytoplasmic sequences necessary for Fc gamma RIIb2-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis respectively, and we observed that two tyrosine residues, located in each of these sequences, are critical for endocytosis and/or phagocytosis. Our data indicate that the two internalization pathways diverge as early as signal transduction.
