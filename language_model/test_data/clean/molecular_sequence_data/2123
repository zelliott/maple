The 16S and 23S mitochondrial rRNAs of Aspergillus nidulans have been identified by Northern hybridisation and the ends of the molecules mapped onto the mitochondrial genome by S1 nuclease analysis. The results show that both the rRNA molecules are longer than originally reported, forcing a reassessment of the potential secondary structures that can form in the terminal regions. In particular, structures resembling the 5.8S- and 4.5S-like domains of the bacterial large rRNA can now be recognised within the A. nidulans 23S molecule. The new 5' termini of the 16S and 23S genes lie within conserved 18-bp sequences that may be promoters but are more likely to be processing signals that cleave the mature rRNAs from larger precursor molecules. The new end of the 23S gene abuts the 5' end of the threonine-tRNA gene.
