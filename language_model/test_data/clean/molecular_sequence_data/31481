A thermotolerant, alkalitolerant, Gram-stain-negative and strictly aerobic bacterium, designated strain YIM 77974(T), was isolated from a geothermally heated soil sample collected at Rehai National Park, Tengchong, Yunnan province, south-west China. Cells of the strain were rod-shaped and colonies were light brown and circular. The strain grew in the presence of 0-3 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0-1 %) and at pH 7.0-10.0 (optimum, pH 8.0) and 30-55 °C (optimum, 45 °C). The only quinone was Q-8 and the genomic DNA G+C content was 68.3 mol%. Major fatty acids (>10 %) were iso-C16 : 0, iso-C17 : 0, iso-C15 : 0 and iso-C11 : 0. The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, an unidentified aminophospholipid, three unidentified phospholipids and two unidentified polar lipids. On the basis of the morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics as well as genotypic data, it is proposed that this strain should be classified as a representative of a novel genus and species, Rehaibacterium terrae gen. nov., sp. nov., in the family Xanthomonadaceae. The type strain is strain YIM 77974(T) ( = DSM 25897(T) = CCTCC AB 2012062(T)).
