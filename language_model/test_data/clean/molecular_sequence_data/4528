Seventy-two near full size long terminal repeats (LTRs) of human endogenous retrovirus of K-family (HERV-K) have been precisely located on the metric map of human chromosome 19. The LTR-related sequences were identified and assigned to cosmids by hybridization with two independent chromosome 19 specific cDNA clones corresponding to different parts of U3 region of LTR of HERV-K. The presence of full-size LTR sequences in a cosmid was further verified by PCR assay with a pair of primers complementary to the termini of the LTR. Coincidences of the LTR and the known genes positions are discussed.
