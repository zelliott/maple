To identify transcribed sequences rapidly and efficiently, we have developed a recombination-based assay to screen bacteriophage lambda libraries for sequences that share homology with a given probe. This strategy determines analytically whether a given probe is transcribed in a given tissue at a given time of development, and may also be used to isolate preparatively the transcribed sequence free of the screening probe. We illustrate this technology for the fragile X sequence, demonstrating that it is transcribed ubiquitously in an 11 week fetus, in a variety of 20 week human fetal tissues, including brain, spinal cord, eye, liver, kidney and skeletal muscle, and in adult jejunum.
