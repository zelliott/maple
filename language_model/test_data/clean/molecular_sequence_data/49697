Anuran amphibians, animals that spend a terrestrial life after metamorphosis, exhibit a marked development of hindlimbs during and after metamorphosis. In order to see whether changes occur in the muscle protein components in the course of postmetamorphic development, we subjected gastrocnemius muscle extracts from growing froglets to two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE). As a result, we found two proteins to undergo a change in level. One spot, indicating a molecular mass of approximately 12 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 5.0 first became detectable at 45 days after metamorphosis. Another spot, corresponding to a protein of 11 kDa and pI 4.8, was prominent until the former spot appeared. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis and comparison of the spots with those of parvalbumin (PA) revealed that these two proteins were PA alpha and PA beta. Northern blot analysis using PA alpha and PA beta cDNAs as probes revealed that the PA beta mRNA level declined whereas that of PA alpha mRNA rose as the frogs grew.
