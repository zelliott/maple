An affinity column immobilizing a decapeptide H(2)N-RGDSPASSKP-CO(2)H was used to select RGD-binding aptamers from a pool of 86-mer single-strand oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) containing a random 40-mer sequence. The enriched library thus obtained was further selected against adsorbed fibronectin and individual aptamers were monocloned in E. coli and sequenced to give a couple of highly homologous ODNs, which indeed inhibited fibronectin-integrin mediated cell adhesion.
