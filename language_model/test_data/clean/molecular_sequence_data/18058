The molecular and cellular mechanisms of action of synthetic polyions on immunogenesis are reviewed. The results of studies of the principal properties of polyionic immunostimulators and of the cell responses to the action of these stimulants have been used to construct artificial antigen-polyion complexes with enhanced immunogenic properties. The vaccinating properties of such macromolecular complexes, constructed with the use of bacterial or viral antigens, are analysed.
