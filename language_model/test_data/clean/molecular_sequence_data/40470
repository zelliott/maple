Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a fatal viral disease that occurs in approximately 30 countries. It has the most extensive geographic range among the tick-borne viruses that affect human health. Recently, a 6-year-old boy presented with complaints of fever, fatigue, and loss of appetite. He revealed a history of tick bite in rural Istanbul three days prior to presentation. A hyperemia was detected at the site of the tick bite. Laboratory tests showed that alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated and that the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were prolonged. Anti-CCHF virus IgM ELISA and a reverse transcriptase-PCR assay for CCHF RNA were both positive. Phylogenetic studies revealed that the virus was a new AP92-like CCHF strain, which was named KMAG-Hu-07-01 (accession number EU057975). This patient could provide important information on the transmission dynamics of CCHF infection.
