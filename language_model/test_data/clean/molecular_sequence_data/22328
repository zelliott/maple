CD30+ cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders include lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). LyP is associated with development of lymphoma in nearly 20% of patients. Herein is reviewed the clonal relationship of LyP to malignant lymphoma, the concept of a common stem cell for LyP and associated lymphomas, and the role of genetic instability in lymphomagenesis. The possible role of the CD30+ cell as a regulatory T-cell is introduced and a model for progression of LyP to ALCL is illustrated.
