Cytomegalovirus injection is common in kidney transplanted patients. Viremia is the only marker of active CMV infection, but the use of cell culture for the direct detection of the virus is time-consuming and not very sensitive, while the detection of CMV by measuring the titre of antibodies is difficult due to the immunosuppression these patients undergo. Thus the ability to amplify CMV DNA by the polymerase chain reaction from blood or urine samples of the patients becomes a valuable diagnostic tool for the detection of CMV in the early stages of the infection. Using a set of primers specific for the amplification of a 435 bp region of the IE-1 gene, we detected CMV DNA in blood leucocytes of a kidney transplanted patient who received the transplant from a CMV-seropositive donor, 45 days after the operation, while the antibody titre showed no evidence of active CMV infection.
