We have generated four monoclonal antibodies specific for one or more members of a series of two sequentially derived PR8 influenza virus variants. Three of these antibodies share cross-reactive idiotypes. The amino acid sequences of these antibodies were determined, and it was found that two of these antibodies use genes from the VH7183 family, whereas the third uses a gene from the VHJ558 family. All four monoclonal antibodies derive from different families of genes encoding the variable region of the kappa chain. The RNA sequence of the parent PR8 virus as well as the RNA sequences of the sequential variants were also determined, and it was demonstrated that the variant hemagglutinin molecules differed from the parent molecule by only a single amino acid interchange. Despite these subtle differences in antigenic structures of hemagglutinin, and the cross-reactive idiotype of the antibodies, their primary structures were very different. These data reinforce the idea that a wide variety of antibody structures exist which are directed against subtly different structures in biologically important antigens.
