The cDNA for the monocarboxylate transporter MCT2 from rat testis has been cloned and sequenced. The derived protein sequence shows 82% identity with that from hamster. Rat MCT2 has a relative insertion of five amino acids in the N-terminal sequence preceding the first predicted transmembrane segment. MCT2 appears to be less highly conserved between species than MCT1. Using Northern blotting of RNA from rat and mouse tissues, MCT2 message was demonstrated to be abundant in the testis where a smaller, less abundant MCT2 transcript was also present. Low levels of a slightly different-sized transcript were found in rat and mouse liver, and mouse kidney. In hamster, only one-size transcript was detected at relatively high abundance in all the tissues examined. Antibodies were raised against a peptide derived from the extreme C-terminus of rat MCT2, and Western blotting with these detected MCT2 in membrane fractions prepared from rat testis, liver and brain but not those from heart or skeletal muscle. In hamster, MCT2 was detected in liver, heart and testis but not in brain [Garcia, Brown, Pathak, and Goldstein (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 1843-1849]. For both rat MCT1 and MCT2 there were marked differences between the relative abundance of their respective messages and the amount of protein in membrane fractions from different tissues. This suggests that expression of both of these transporters in different tissues may be species-specific and regulated post-transcriptionally. The different-sized MCT2 transcripts may arise from alternative splicing. Starvation of rats for up to 48 h did not lead to any change in MCT1 or MCT2 expression in the liver, as determined by either Northern or Western blotting.
