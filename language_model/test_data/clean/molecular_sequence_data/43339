The matrix protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been postulated to serve a variety of functions in the virus life cycle. Previously, we introduced a large number of mutations into the HIV-1 matrix and determined the effects on virus replication. These studies identified domains involved in virus assembly and release and envelope glycoprotein incorporation into virions. Here we describe the identification and characterization of viral revertants containing second-site changes in the matrix which compensate for the effects of four of the original mutations on matrix function. Specifically, mutations at matrix residues 4 and 6 severely impaired virus assembly and release; substitutions at residues 4 and 6 reversed the phenotype of the amino acid 4 change while second-site mutations at matrix positions 10, 69, and 97 partially or fully reversed the phenotype of the amino acid 6 substitution. A mutation at matrix residue 62 reversed the effect of a position 34 change which blocks envelope glycoprotein incorporation into virions, and substitutions at residues 27 and 51 reversed the phenotype of a position 86 mutation which redirects virus assembly to the cytoplasm. In addition to determining the effects of the compensatory changes in the context of the original mutations, we also introduced and analyzed the second-site changes alone in the context of the wild-type molecular clone. The data presented here define potential intermolecular and intramolecular interactions which occur in the matrix during the virus life cycle and have implications for our understanding of the relationship between matrix structure and function.
