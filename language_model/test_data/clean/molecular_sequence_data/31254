The gfa gene encodes glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intermediate-filament protein expressed primarily in glial cells. We have used in vitro transcription studies to show that the basal level of transcription of the human gene encoding GFAP is controlled by two distinct initiators--i.e., promoter elements that direct transcription from a specific start site. One initiator is located about 25 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site, contains a TATA box, and apparently acts together with a sequence found around the transcription start site. The other initiator is located between +11 and +50 bp downstream from the transcription start site. Most of this second region overlaps with the protein-encoding sequence, which starts at bp +17. The sensitivity of transcription to alpha-amanitin indicates that both initiators are used by RNA polymerase II.
