Two copies of the chloroplast-like tRNA(Asn) gene, trnN1 and trnN2, are expressed in potato mitochondria. While Northern-blot analysis revealed only mature tRNA(Asn), RT-PCR indicated that trnN1 is co-transcribed with trnY and nad2 (exons c, d and e). Using primer-extension and capping experiments, four transcription initiation sites have been mapped in the vicinity of these genes. The first site, responsible for the co-transcription of trnN1, trnY and nad2 (exons c, d and e), gives rise to a primary transcript of at least 7000 nt. A second site, 58 nt downstream from trnY, corresponds to an alternative promoter specific for nad2. In both cases, only the CRTA core motif of the consensus CRTAaGaGA of dicot mitochondrial promoters was found. Finally, two transcription initiation sites were identified 135 and 128 nt upstream of trnN2 in a region which shows no sequence homology with this consensus motif.
