The second exon of the bovine MHC class II DRB3 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from DNA samples of 568 zebu Brahman cattle (Bos indicus) from Martinique (French West Indies). Cloning of these PCR products allowed the isolation of both alleles from each animal, which were characterized by the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) technique using the restriction enzymes RsaI, BstYI and HaeIII. Four new PCR-RFLP patterns were obtained by digestion with RsaI. These patterns were named 'v', 'w', 'x' and 'y' continuing the accepted nomenclature. Sequencing of each allele allowed the identification of 18 new BoLA-DRB3 exon 2 nucleotide sequences and their deduced amino acid sequences.
