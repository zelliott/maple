Hypochnicium is a genus of corticioid, wood-inhabiting fungi in the Polyporales with a worldwide distribution. The genus has been characterized by the nature of the spores; they are thick-walled, smooth or ornamented, and cyanophilous. Nine new ITS nrDNA sequences from species of this genus were aligned with 32 sequences from GenBank, and phylogenetic analyses were performed. Six clades were determined within the genus; one contains taxa with smooth spores, and the other three with ornamented spores. Hypochnicium versatum must be included in Gloeohypochnicium, and the new combination Gloeohypochnicium versatum is proposed. Two new species, Hypochnicium michelii from Spain and Hypochnicium guineensis from Equatorial Guinea, are described.
