Amino acid substitutions in variable regions of the T-cell receptor (TCR) can alter T-cell reactivity; however, relatively little is known about the extent of allelic variation in human TCR coding sequences. In the present studies, coding region variation in the human TCR V beta 12.2 gene was examined in detail. Virtually the entire V beta 12.2 coding region was screened for nucleotide substitutions by single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis. Four alleles were identified in a sample population of 90 unrelated people from diverse genetic backgrounds. Three of the alleles were common, with estimated frequencies of 0.32, 0.47, and 0.20. Sequence analyses revealed that variation between the alleles was confined to three single-base differences in codons 24, 31, and 45; none of these changes altered the amino acid sequence. No evidence for other coding region differences in this gene were found. This analysis suggests that coding region variation in V beta 12.2 is limited, and amino acid sequence is highly conserved.
