Glycosylation of proteins is a common event and contributes to protein antigenic properties. Most data have been obtained from model studies on glycoprotens with well-defined structure or synthetic glycopeptides and their respective monoclonal antibodies. Antibodies raised against glycoprotein antigens may be specific for their carbohydrate units which are recognized irrespective of the protein carrier (carbohydrate epitopes), or in the context of the adjacent amino acid residues (glycopeptidic epitopes). Conformation or proper exposure of peptidic epitopes of glycoproteins is also frequently modulated by glycosylation due to intramolecular carbohydrate-protein interactions. The effects of glycosylation are broad: glycosylation may 'inactivate' the peptidic epitope or may be required for its reactivity with the antibody, depending on the structure of the antigenic site and antibody fine specificity. Evidence is increasing that similar effects of glycosylation pertain to T cell-dependent cellular immune responses. Glycosylated peptides can be bound and presented by MHC class I or II molecules and elicit glycopeptide-specific T cell clones.
