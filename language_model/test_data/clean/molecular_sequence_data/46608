We have isolated TBP (TATA-binding protein)-interacting protein (TIP) from cell lysates of a hyperthermophilic archaeon, Pyrococcus kodakaraensis KOD1, by affinity chromatography with TBP-agarose. Based on the internal amino acid sequence information, PCR primers were synthesized and used to amplify the gene encoding this protein (Pk-TIP). Determination of the nucleotide sequence and characterization of the recombinant protein revealed that Pk-TIP is composed of 224 amino acid residues (molecular weight of 25,558) and exists in a dimeric form. BIAcore analyses for the interaction between recombinant Pk-TIP and recombinant Pk-TBP indicated that they interact with each other with an equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, of 1.24-1.46 microM. A gel mobility shift assay indicated that Pk-TIP inhibited the interaction between Pk-TBP and a TATA-DNA. Pk-TIP may be one of the archaeal factors which negatively regulate transcription.
