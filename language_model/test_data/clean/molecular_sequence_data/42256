The type II and type III collagen alpha-1 chain C-telopeptides are a 27 mer with the sequence NAc-GPGIDMSAFAGLGPREKGPDPLQYMRA and a 22mer,NAc-GGGVASLGAGEKGPVGYGYEYR, respectively. Their conformations have been studied in CD3OH/H2O (80/20) solution by means of two-dimensional proton NMR and CD spectroscopy. Based on TOCSY and NOESY experiments, all resonances were assigned and the conformational properties were analyzed in terms of vicinal NH-H alpha coupling constants, sequential and medium range NOEs and amide proton temperature coefficients. The conformation of the type II C-telopeptide is essentially extended. Evidence from CD spectroscopy suggests that a very minor proportion of the peptide might be helical (ca.8%), but the NMR data show no evidence for a non-linear structure. The observation of reduced amide proton temperature dependence coefficients in certain sections of the molecule can, in view of the absence of any other supporting evidence, only be interpreted in terms of local shielding from solvent for sterical reasons (large hydrophobic side-chains). The conformation of the type III C-telopeptide is mostly extended except for a beta-turn ranging from Gly8 to Glu11, which is stabilized by a hydrogen-bond between NH of Glu11 and the carbonyl group of Gly8. The low temperature coefficient of NH(Glu11) and, in particular, the observation of a medium range NOE between H alpha (A9) and NH(E11) corroborate the existence of a beta-turn in this region. Although spectral overlap prevents a precise conclusion with regard to the type of beta-turn present, there is some evidence that it might be type II.
