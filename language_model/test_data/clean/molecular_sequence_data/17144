Hoxc8 early enhancer controls the initiation and establishment phase of Hoxc8 expression in the mouse. Comparative studies indicate the presence of Hoxc8 early enhancer sequences in different vertebrate clades including mammals, birds and fish. Previous studies have shown differences between teleost and mammalian Hoxc8 early enhancers with respect to sequence and organization of protein binding elements. This raises the question of when the Hoxc8 early enhancer arose and how it has become modified in different vertebrate lineages. Here, we describe Hoxc8 early enhancer from the Indonesian coelacanth, Latimeria menadoensis. Coelacanths are the only extant lobefinned fish whose genome is tractable to genome analysis. The Latimeria Hoxc8 early enhancer sequence more closely resembles that of the mouse than that of Fugu or zebrafish. When assayed for enhancer activity by reporter gene analysis in transgenic mouse embryos, Latimeria Hoxc8 early enhancer directs expression to the posterior neural tube and mesoderm similar to that of the mouse enhancer. These observations support a close relationship between coelacanths and tetrapods and place the origin of a common Hoxc8 early enhancer sequence within the sarcopterygian lineage. The divergence of teleost (actinopterygii) Hoxc8 early enhancer may reflect a case of relaxed selection or other forms of instability induced by genome duplication events.
