Analysis of deletion polymorphism of human c-fms gene intron 11 (approximately 425-bp deletion) is of particular interest because of the increased proportion of the deletion heterozygotes among the infants born from the parents, one of which lacks the deletion allele, and the other is heterozygous for the deletion. In this study, allele and haplotype frequencies of the polymorphism examined were assessed in a number of Caucasoid and Mongoloid populations of Russia. In all populations tested, relatively high prevalence of the deletion-bearing allele, ranging from 9.45% in ethnic Germans to 20.75% in Altaians, was detected. Russians and Kazakhs were characterized by intermediate frequencies of the rare allele, constituting in these populations 12.89 and 14.93%, respectively. Hardy-Weinberg expectations were met in all populations examined, pointing to a stable level of polymorphism at the c-fms intron 11. It was established by the context analysis of DNA of the deleted fragment along with the flanking sequences that this region contained a number of transcription factor motifs (Ets, SRF, and Myc), potentially capable of the regulation of the M-CFF-dependant c-fms transcription. The deletion breakpoint was localized within the CArG motif, which, together with the neighboring ets motif, form the potential CArG/ets composite element. It was suggested that allele lacking the fragment of intron 11 could be restricted in its ability to modulate the level of the c-fms transcription in response to the action of M-CSF. The data of molecular epidemiological survey serve as the indirect evidence favoring the suggestion on the possible functional value of this gene fragment. It was demonstrated that in the samples of acute bronchitis and trichomoniasis patients allelic and genotype frequencies were statistically significantly different from those in the population sample. In case of trichmoniasis, the frequency of rare allele was 2.4 times lower, and in case of acute bronchitis it was 2.1 times higher than in the control sample.
