Strain DCY24(T), a Gram-reaction-positive, aerobic, rod-shaped, motile bacterium, was isolated from soil of a ginseng field in South Korea. According to 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, it was closely related to Nocardioides aromaticivorans DSM 15131(T) (95.1 % similarity), Nocardioides simplex KCTC 9106(T) (95.0 %), Nocardioides nitrophenolicus DSM 15529(T) (94.8 %) and Nocardioides kongjuensis DSM 19082(T) (94.7 %). Chemotaxonomic data revealed that strain DCY24(T) possessed MK-8(H(4)) as the predominant menaquinone, ll-2,6-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid, phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol as predominant polar lipids and iso-C(16 : 0), iso-C(17 : 0) and C(18 : 1)omega9c as predominant fatty acids. The DNA G+C content was 71.0 mol%. Based on evidence from this polyphasic study, strain DCY24(T) (=KCTC 19265(T) =LMG 24128(T)) should be classified as the type strain of a novel Nocardioides species, for which the name Nocardioides humi sp. nov. is proposed.
