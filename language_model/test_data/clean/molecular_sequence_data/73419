A new disease of epidemic proportions caused by fish viruses within the Iridoviridae family inflicts serious damage on red sea breams (Pagrus major) and striped jack (Caranx delicatissimus) populations grown in aquacultures in Japan. A partial segment of the fish iridoviral DNA was directly amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with synthetic primers designed from well conserved nucleotide sequences between the frog virus 3 (Ranavirus) and the silkworm iridescent virus type 6. The deduced amino acid sequence from the nucleotide sequence of the PCR fragment demonstrates a high correlation with a partial sequence from the frog virus 3. Using the PCR method with specific primers, we could detect three of four different known types of fish iridoviruses in diseased fishes. To construct more reliable detection methods specific for this viral family, DNA fragments which can specifically hybridize with all of the four known iridoviridae viral DNAs were screened from the genomic library of one iridoviridae strain. The hybridization assay, using a specific fragment which contains regions which are highly homologous with a characterized partial sequence from the frog virus 3, proved to be a reliable diagnostic tool for fish iridoviral diseases.
