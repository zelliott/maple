The nucleotide sequence of the Vibrio alginolyticus alkaline serine exoprotease A (ProA) gene cloned in Escherichia coli was determined. The exoprotease A gene (proA) consisted of 1602 bp which encoded a protein of 534 amino acids (aa) with an Mr of 55,900. The region upstream from the gene was characterized by a putative promoter consensus region (-10 -35), a ribosome-binding site and ATG start codon. The proA gene encodes a typical 21-aa N-terminal signal sequence which, when fused to alkaline phosphatase by means of transposon TnphoA, was able to mediate transport of the alkaline phosphatase to the periplasm in E. coli. Deletions of up to 106 aa from the C terminus of ProA did not result in the loss of extracellular protease activity. Additional V. alginolyticus genes were not involved in the secretion into the medium of the cloned ProA in E. coli. The amino acid sequence of ProA showed low overall homology to a Serratia marcescens serine exoprotease but significant homology was detected with other subtilisin family exoproteases. The fungal proteinase K, another sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant protease, had 44% aa homology with ProA.
