OmpR, the transcriptional regulatory protein of ompF, had not been previously shown to specifically bind to the -70 to -60-bp region of ompF. We show that the -102 to -76-bp sequence of ompF has a high affinity binding site for OmpR and produced a single OmpR/ompF complex (complex b). Extension of this DNA fragment to include an inverted repeat sequence located between the -71 and -64-bp region resulted in the formation of a second, slower migrating complex (complex a). A -102 to -58-bp fragment containing a substitution of the -70 CG bp was able to form complex b, but not complex a. A mutant OmpR protein derived from a strain that can not repress ompF was unable to form complex a, while complex b was formed normally. Deletion of the -70 CG bp resulted in incomplete repression of OmpF. These results suggest that OmpR binds to the -71 to -64-bp region and that this sequence plays a role in the regulation of ompF in Escherichia coli.
