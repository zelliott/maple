In vivo gene transfer into various organs of postnatal animals has recently been demonstrated. We applied this technique in order to map the promoter element of the protooncogene c-fos in the myocardium that responds to left ventricular pressure overload in vivo. Beating rat hearts were directly injected with a recombinant plasmid containing a 356-base pair upstream regulatory element of the mouse c-fos gene fused to a reporter gene. Two days after the injection, the hearts were excised and buffer-perfused. Acute pressure overload was applied for 2 h by inflating an intraventricular balloon. Pressure overload increased the myocardial reporter gene activity by 3-8-fold (p < 0.01). Deletion and point mutations in the serum response element (SRE) of the c-fos promoter resulted in loss of pressure-induced reporter gene expression, indicating that the SRE is necessary for pressure response. The SRE alone was sufficient to confer pressure responsiveness to the minimal c-fos promoter, confirming that the pressure response element coincides with the SRE. A construct containing a point mutation at the p62TCF binding site of the SRE did not respond to pressure overload or to a protein kinase C activator but retained responsiveness to a calcium ionophore. This suggests that pressure overload may activate the c-fos promoter by a protein kinase C-dependent pathway. Thus, a directly injected gene can be regulated in the host cells by a physical stimulus to the intact organ. The in vivo DNA injection technique is a useful method to study complex organ physiology at the molecular level.
