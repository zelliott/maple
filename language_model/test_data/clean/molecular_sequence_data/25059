The fusion gene of BPI23 and human Fc gamma 1 was obtained by PCR method, and the expression plasmid was constructed to express recombinant BPI23-Fc gamma 1 fusion protein in CHO cells. After transfection with the plasmid and selection by methotrexate, the cell lines expressing the fusion protein were obtained. The recombinant protein was purified using cation-exchange chromatography and its bioactivity was proved with bactericidal assays.
