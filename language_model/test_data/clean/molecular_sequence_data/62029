The O-polysaccharide (O-antigen) of Providencia stuartii O18 was obtained by mild acid degradation of the lipopolysaccharide and studied by chemical methods and NMR spectroscopy, including 2D 1H,1H COSY, TOCSY, NOESY and 1H,13C HSQC experiments. The following structure of the tetrasaccharide repeating unit of the polysaccharide was established: [structure: see text] where Qui3NAc is 3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxyglucose. Anti-P. stuartii O18 serum cross-reacted with the O-antigen of Proteus genomospecies 4, which could be accounted for the marked structural similarities of the main chain.
