Human parvovirus B19 replicates and encapsidates its genome in the nucleus of erythroid progenitors in vivo and in vitro. We wanted to understand the determinants necessary for the nuclear transport of the major coat protein, VP2, which makes up about 96% of the viral capsid proteins. A nonconsensus basic motif, KLGPRKATGRW, necessary for the nuclear localization of VP2 was identified and shown to be able to import reporter proteins into the nucleus. The sequence is conserved among the VP2 C-terminal region of erythroviruses. This newly identified sequence will facilitate the understanding of the replication of these viruses.
