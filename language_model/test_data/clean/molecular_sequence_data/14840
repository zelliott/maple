Ovalbumin (OVA) derived from egg white contains two residues that can be phosphorylated: Ser-68 and Ser-344. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(PAGE) shows the presence of three distinct migration bands corresponding to phosphorylation states with two, one, or no phosphate groups, respectively. Phosphate-affinity sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; Zn(2+)-Phos-tag SDS-PAGE), on the other hand, showed the presence of four distinct phosphorylated states in intact OVA. In addition to the diphosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms, two distinct species, one with a phosphate group at Ser-68 and one with a phosphate group at Ser-344, were separately visualized. The content of the OVA monophosphorylated at Ser-68 was greater than that of OVA monophosphorylated at Ser-344. Zn(2+)-Phos-tag SDS-PAGE is therefore a useful method for the quantitative analysis of the detailed phosphorylation status of food proteins.
