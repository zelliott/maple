To clone and sequence the phosphodiesterase 6 beta subunit (pde6b) gene of Kunming mice, and to compare it with counterpart sequences in the GenBank database.

The primers were designed covering the CDS region of the pde6b gene, and the corresponding fragments were amplified using RT-PCR. The fragments were cloned into plasmids, amplified in E.coli, and sequenced. Bioinformatics programs and online tools were used to analyze the sequences.

The CDS of the pde6b gene of Kunming mice was cloned and sequenced. Compared with the inbred mice C57BL/6J, pde6b CDS sequence of Kunming mice was different in some points: a G-->A transition at +706, a C-->T transversion at +1149. The protein sequence was of little difference: only a glycine-->serine at +236.

The pde6b CDS region of Kunming mice was successfully cloned. Pde6b sequences are of some level difference in different kinds of mice, but they are most conserved in protein level.
