The cDNA of the androgen receptor (AR) has been isolated from the ovary of red sea bream, Pagrus major, and sequenced. The amino acid sequence of red sea bream AR (rsAR) shows about 45% identity with that of Xenopus, rat, mouse, and human AR. It is shown that rsAR has the ability to trans-activate the responsive gene depending on the presence of androgen.
