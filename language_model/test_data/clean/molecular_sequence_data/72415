A member of the AAA family of Mg2(+)-ATPases from the archaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The protein, VCP-like ATPase of Thermoplasma acidophilum (VAT), is a homologue of SAV from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and CdcH of Halobacterium salinarium, and belongs to the CDC48/VCP/p97 subfamily. The deduced product of the vat gene is 745 residues long (Mr 83,000), which has an optimal Mg2(+)-ATPase activity at 70 degrees C. Electron microscopy shows the purified protein to form single and double homo-hexameric rings. Although the symmetry is different, the appearance of the complexes formed of two rings resembles the 20S proteasome and Hsp60/GroEL.
