The 22 kDa auxin-binding proteins in higher plants have received considerable attention as candidates for an auxin receptor. A cDNA clone Ca-ERabp1 of hot pepper (Capsicum annum) was isolated using the oligonucleotides as PCR primers. The cDNA codes for a polypeptide related to the major 22 kDa auxin-binding protein from maize and Arabidopsis ERabp1. The deduced amino acid sequence contains an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, the KDEL sequence located at the C-terminal end, and has two possible auxin-binding sites, HRHSCE and YDDWSVPHTA conserved sequences. Northern hybridization analysis revealed that the Ca-ERabp1 gene is differentially expressed in total RNA isolated from different organs of a pepper plant, showing the highest level of expression in fruits but barely detectable in leaves and roots.
