A new triterpenoid saponin named bredemeyeroside B has been isolated from the roots of Bredemeyera floribunda and its structure elucidated as 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-2 beta, 3 beta, 27-trihydroxyolean-12-en-23,28-dioic acid 28-O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1-->4)-[beta-D-apiofuranosyl-(1-->3)]-a lpha -L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2)-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->3] -beta-D-fucopyranoside by means of MS, NMR and chemical evidence. In addition rutin was also isolated. In laboratory tests bredemeyeroside B showed snake venom antidote activity.
