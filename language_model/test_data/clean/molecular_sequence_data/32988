A water-soluble polysaccharide (PS-I), isolated from the aqueous extract of the stems of Amaranthus tricolor Linn. (Amaranthus gangeticus L.), was found to consist of L-arabinose, methyl-D-galacturonate, D-galactose, and 3-O-Ac-L-rhamnose in a molar ratio of nearly 1:1:1:1. On the basis of total acid hydrolysis, methylation analysis, periodate oxidation, and NMR studies ((1)H, (13)C, TOCSY, DQF-COSY, NOESY, ROESY, HMQC, and HMBC), the structure of the repeating unit of the PS-I is determined as: -->5)-alpha-L-Araf-(1-->4)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->2)-3-O-Ac-beta-L-Rhap-(1-->4)-alpha-D-Gal-A6Me-(1-->
