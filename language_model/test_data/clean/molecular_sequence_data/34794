Phylogenetic relationships were inferred among several xylariaceous genera with Nodulisporium or nodulisporium-like anamorphs based on the analyses of beta-tubulin and alpha-actin sequences. One hundred nine cultures and three specimens of 83 representatives of these four genera were included in the study. Biscogniauxia taxa formed a well supported clade that was basal to the other taxa, while taxa of Hypoxylon and Daldinia comprised a large monophyletic group that contained two subclades. The first subclade encompassed Hypoxylon sect. Annulata and is accepted here as the new genus Annulohypoxylon. The second subclade contained taxa of Hypoxylon sect. Hypoxylon and Daldinia. Hypoxylon is restricted to include only those taxa in sect. Hypoxylon. Thirty-three epithets are made in Annulohypoxylon. Hypoxylon cohaerens var. microsporum is raised to the species level and accepted as A. minutellum. Hypoxylon polyporoideum is recognized as distinct from H. crocopeplum. Hypoxylon placentiforme is accepted as Daldinia placentiformis.
