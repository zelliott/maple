Specific point mutations which affect viral tropism have been identified in both the V3 loop and in the CD4-binding region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 surface glycoprotein gp120. Here we report that a single point mutation in the first variable region (V1) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strain JRCSF is responsible for a change in viral tropism.
