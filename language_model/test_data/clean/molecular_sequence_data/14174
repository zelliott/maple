We have constructed the first Escherichia coli-Veillonella shuttle vector based on an endogenous plasmid (pVJL1) isolated from a clinical Veillonella strain. A highly transformable Veillonella strain was also identified. Both the shuttle vector and the transformable strain should be valuable tools for future Veillonella genetic studies.
