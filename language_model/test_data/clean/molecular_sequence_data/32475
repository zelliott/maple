"Actinobacillus porcitonsillarum" is a newly suggested commensal species colonizing porcine tonsils. In the diagnostic laboratory the sole difference to the porcine lung pathogen Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is a negative mannitol reaction. In order to substantiate and improve this important differentiation a PCR test was developed using the relevant reference strains including Actinobacillus minor. The practicability of the test was confirmed on 20 clinical isolates of Actinobacillus spp. cultured from 100 tonsil samples originating from 18 farms in Thailand. Applying the newly developed PCR test 10 isolates were identified as A. pleuropneumoniae, and 10 as "A. porcitonsillarum" with one of them being mannitol-positive in biochemical testing. Subsequent 16S rRNA sequencing confirmed classification of all 10 strains as "A. porcitonsillarum"/A. minor. These results emphasize that suspected A. pleuropneumoniae isolates, particularly from porcine tonsils, should be confirmed by PCR in order to prevent false positive diagnoses.
