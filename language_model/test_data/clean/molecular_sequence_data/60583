A cellular disintegrin, also called MDC and ADAM is a recently discovered gene family that encodes protein with disintegrin-like and metalloprotease-like domains. We have reported the identification of human cDNAs encoding novel ADAM family proteins that we named MDC2 and MDC3 because of their structural similarity to the MDC (Sagane, K. et al., 1998. Biochem. J. 334, 93-98). The Human Gene Nomenclature Committee assigned the gene symbols ADAM11 for the MDC, ADAM22 for the MDC2 and ADAM23 for the MDC3. Here we report the isolation of three novel murine cDNAs encoding the proteins closely related to the human ADAM11, ADAM22 and ADAM23. Their chromosomal locations in the mouse were identified by interspecies backcross mapping. The loci of these murine ADAM genes were in good accordance with the location of each human ortholog, ADAM11, ADAM22 and ADAM23. These findings suggest that three murine cDNAs that we have isolated are the murine ADAM11, ADAM22 and ADAM23 cDNAs. Northern blot analysis shows that all of these three murine ADAMs were highly expressed in the mouse brain. The structures of these ADAM proteins strongly suggest that they could function as integrin receptors. The implications of the cellular disintegrins in neural development are discussed.
