Drosophila melanogaster D1 is a satellite DNA-associated protein which preferentially binds DNA sequences containing runs of AT base pairs. Clones encoding this polypeptide have been isolated from a lambda gt11 cDNA library by immunological screening with a D1 antiserum. The deduced sequence of the D1 polypeptide is 355 amino acids long and contains 10 copies of a repeating motif consisting of a glycine-arginine-proline (GRP) tripeptide located within a cluster of basic amino acids. Three copies of a similar motif have previously been observed in a mammalian satellite DNA-binding protein, high mobility group protein I (Lund, T., Dahl, K. H., Mork, E., Holtlund, J., and Laland, S. G. (1987) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 146, 725-730), suggesting that this motif may be a general feature of proteins which bind AT-rich satellite DNA and perhaps other AT-containing DNA as well.
