The mammalian gene encoding the alpha subunit of the Go protein generates by alternative splicing two isoforms, alpha o1 and alpha o2, which differ in their carboxy-terminal region. We report here the cloning of a Xenopus cDNA (XG alpha o1) which encodes a protein corresponding to the mammalian alpha o1 isoform. In its 3' untranslated region, the transcript contains a repetitive motif made up of dinucleotide AT repeats. By RT-PCR amplification, we showed that XG alpha o1 transcripts are both maternal and zygotic. As alpha o2 transcripts have been shown to be maternal and devoid of AT repeats, the repetitive motif could play a role in the differential expression of each isoform.
