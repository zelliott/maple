The enzymes and redox proteins, which participate in the oxidation of ferrous ion by the acidophilic iron-oxiding bacterium Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, have been isolated and characterized. They are Fe(II)-cytochrome c oxidoreductase, cytochromes c-552(s), c-552(m) and c-550(m), rusticyanin, and cytochrome c oxidase. On the basis of the interactions of these components, an electron transfer system has been proposed which seems to function in the oxidation of ferrous ion by the bacterium.
