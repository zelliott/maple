Little is known about the role of the humoral immune response to hepatitis C virus (HCV). This study provides molecular evidence for the mechanism by which neutralizing Abs from the sera of chronic HCV patients have lower inhibitory activities against the binding of HCV E2 envelope protein to human hepatoma cell lines than to a lymphoma cell line. E2 binds to several putative receptors, specifically human CD81; human scavenger receptor, class B, type 1; and heparan sulfate. We have shown that E2 binds to target cells via these receptors in a noncompetitive manner. Thus, incomplete inhibition of one of the receptors leads to only a partial E2 blockade and, possibly, evasion of the host immune response. We demonstrated that the difference in and reduction of inhibition was closely related to impaired blockade of E2 binding to scavenger receptor, class B, type 1, and heparan sulfate. We have also shown that soluble E2 protein binds to multiple soluble receptors via separate binding domains on E2, providing further evidence for the distinct recognition of multiple cellular receptors by E2. This report suggests a novel finding that biased humoral immune responses to HCV E2 might provide an alternative mechanism for viral escape without the involvement of mutation. Additionally, our data give crucial consideration to the development of HCV vaccines that stimulate protective humoral immune responses.
