The N-terminal part of class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP) is assumed to interact with an accessory peptide-binding site on the class II Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecule, and promote a conformational modification. We have linked this immunoregulatory segment (residues 81-88) to the N-terminus of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) 307-319 epitope in order to evaluate relationships between the MHC conformational changes and their implication in immune responses. Our chimeric peptide, named CLIP-HA, bind with the same affinity to class II HLA-DR1 molecules as the HA peptide, and is normally recognized by HA-specific T cells. Interestingly, the presence of the N-terminal CLIP region enhances the rate of association to soluble DR1 molecules but prevents the formation of SDS-resistant complexes. These features suggest the existence of HLA-DR1 conformational changes induced by the chimeric peptide. Furthermore, while in vitro HA and CLIP-HA peptides associated to DR1 could not be differentiated based on T-cell recognition, in vivo the CLIP residues strongly impaired the immunogenicity of HA epitope as assessed in HLA-DR1 transgenic mice. Our study demonstrates for the first time that MHC conformational changes, revealed at molecular level, may influence the immunogenicity.
