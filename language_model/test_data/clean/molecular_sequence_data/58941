eth-1r, a thermosensitive allele of the Neurospora crassa S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) synthetase gene that confers ethionine resistance, has been cloned and sequenced. Replacement of an aspartic amino acid residue (D48-->N48), perfectly conserved in prokaryotic, fungal and higher eukaryotic AdoMet synthetases, was found responsible for both thermosensitivity and ethionine resistance conferred by eth-1r. Gene fusion constructs, designed to overexpress eth-1r in vivo, render transformant cells resistant to ethionine. Dominance of ethionine resistance was further demonstrated in eth-1+/eth-1r partial diploids carrying identical gene doses of both alleles. Heterozygous eth-1+/eth-1r cells have, at the same time, both the thermotolerance conferred by eth-1+ and the ethionine-resistant phenotype conferred by eth-1r. AdoMet levels and AdoMet synthetase activities were dramatically decreased in heterozygous eth-1+/ eth-1r cells. We propose that this negative effect exerted by eth-1r results from the in vivo formation of heteromeric eth-1+/eth-1r AdoMet synthetase molecules.
