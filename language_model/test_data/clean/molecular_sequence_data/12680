The ompK gene of Vibrio parahaemolyticus 1010 (RIMD 2210001) encoding an outer membrane protein (OMP), OmpK, which serves as the receptor for a broad-host-range vibriophage, KVP40, was cloned and sequenced. The gene consisted of 789 nucleotides encoding 263 amino acids. Since the first 20 amino acids most likely constitute the signal peptide, mature OmpK would consist of 243 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 27458 Da. Sequence comparisons indicate that OmpK is unique among Vibrio OMPs so far sequenced, but may be distantly related to Tsx of enteric bacteria and is homologous to an Aeromonas hydrophila OMP, protein IV.
