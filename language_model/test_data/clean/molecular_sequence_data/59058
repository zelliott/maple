Mutations in the genes for two highly conserved TAFs, TAF(II)60 and TAF(II)110, reduce transcription of Bicoid-dependent target genes in vivo. By means of several distinct genetic test systems, specific activator-TAF interactions are shown to support both simple and synergistic enhancement of transcription in the embryo. These studies provide in vivo evidence that TAFs can serve as coactivators to receive gene-specific transcriptional activation signals. This genetic system also presents the opportunity to study the function of basal transcription components in regulating development of complex organisms.
