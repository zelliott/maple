One of the most cultivated and consumed vegetables in Brazil is the common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L. The symbiosis of this plant species with nitrogen-fixing bacteria that are adapted to the stresses commonly found in tropical soils can increase production. The aim of this study was to evaluate the symbiotic effectiveness of bacterial strains from soils under different land uses in the Amazon region. Further, rhizobia tolerance to acidity and aluminium and the involvement of some possible physiological mechanisms of such tolerance were also investigated. In assessing the efficiency of biological nitrogen fixation, inoculation with strains UFLA04-195, UFLA04-173 and UFLA04-202, belonging to the genus Rhizobium, resulted in greater plant growth, higher shoot nitrogen content and good nodulation compared to the inoculation with the strain CIAT 899 (R. tropici), and to the mineral nitrogen control or Burkholderia fungorum strains that nodulated or not bean plants. These efficient strains grew better at pH 5.0 than at pH 6.0 or pH 6.9; they also tolerated up to 1 mmol l(-1) of Al(3+) and showed an increased production of exopolysaccharides where the growing rates were less (pH 6.0 and pH 6.9). With respect to aluminium, the highest production of EPS produced greater tolerance to this element. Taken together, these results indicate that the strains evaluated in this study were tolerant to acidity and aluminium; they appeared to have developed resistance mechanisms such as EPS production and a resistant cell outer membrane (indicated by resistance to polymyxin and methyl violet). As these strains also gave increased yields of the host species, further studies on whether to recommend these strains as inoculants are already underway.
