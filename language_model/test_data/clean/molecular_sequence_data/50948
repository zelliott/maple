In addition to a known spirostanol glycoside, balanitin-3, and a new sapogenol, 6-methyldiosgenin, a new furostanol saponin, balanitoside has been isolated from the fruits (mesocarp) of Balanites aegyptiaca. The structure of the glycoside has been determined as 26-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-3 beta, 22,26-trihydroxy-furost-5-ene 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2)-beta-D- glucopyranosyl-(1-->4)-beta-D-glucopyranoside, on the basis of spectroscopic and chemical evidence.
