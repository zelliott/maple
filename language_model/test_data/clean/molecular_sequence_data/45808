Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) are causative agents of diarrhea, being characterized by aggregative adherence to cultured epithelial cells. In this study, phenotypic properties of EAEC were analyzed with respect to AA, hemagglutination, clump and biofilm formation, all of which are mediated by aggregative adherence fimbriae (AAF). The strains were also screened for AAF types, AAF adhesin variants and Dr adhesin by PCR. Of the three known AAF types, AAF/I and AAF/II adhesin variants were identified. An association between the AAF/adhesin genotypes and the subtypes/scores of phenotypic properties was sought and it was observed that strains harboring same adhesins displayed different subtypes/scores and vice versa.
