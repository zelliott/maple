The c-myb protooncogene encodes a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein (c-Myb) that induces transcriptional activation or repression. We have identified three functional domains of the mouse c-Myb protein that are responsible for DNA binding, transcriptional activation, and negative regulation, respectively. In addition to the DNA-binding domain, which is located near the N terminus, an adjacent region (the transcriptional activation domain) containing about 80 amino acids was found to be essential for transcriptional activation. Deletion of a region spanning about 175 amino acids of the C-proximal portion increased transcriptional activation markedly, revealing that this domain normally represses activation. Differences between the transcriptional activation and repression functions of c-Myb and v-Myb are discussed in the light of these functional domains. Our results suggest that transcriptional activation may be involved in transformation by myb gene products.
