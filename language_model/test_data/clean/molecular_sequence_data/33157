Two recently reported bacterial strains that are able to reductively dehalogenate polychlorinated aliphatic alkanes, including 1,2,3-trichloropropane, 1,2-dichloropropane, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, 1,1,2-trichloroethane and 1,2-dichloroethane, were further characterized to clarify their taxonomic position. The two strains, designated BL-DC-8 and BL-DC-9(T), were mesophilic, non-spore-forming, non-motile, Gram-negative staining and strictly anaerobic. Cells were irregular cocci, 0.3-0.6 mum in diameter. The two strains were resistant to ampicillin and vancomycin. Hydrogen was utilized as an electron donor. The genomic DNA G+C content of strains BL-DC-8 and BL-DC-9(T) was 54.0 and 53.8 mol%, respectively. The major cellular fatty acids were C(18 : 1)omega9c, C(16 : 1)omega9c, C(16 : 0) and C(14 : 0). Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the strains cluster within the phylum Chloroflexi, but are related only distantly to all recognized taxa in the phylum. Morphological, physiological and chemotaxonomic traits as well as phylogenetic analysis support the conclusion that these two strains represent a novel species of a new genus in the phylum Chloroflexi, for which the name Dehalogenimonas lykanthroporepellens gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Dehalogenimonas lykanthroporepellens is BL-DC-9(T) (=ATCC BAA-1523(T) =JCM 15061(T)).
