Fusion between viral envelopes and host cell membranes, which is mediated by special glycoproteins anchored on the viral membrane, is required for HIV viral entry and infection. The HIV gp41 fusion peptide (FP), which initiates membrane fusion, adopts either an α-helical or β-sheeted structure depending on the cholesterol concentration. We used phosphocholine spin labels on the lipid headgroup and different positions on the acyl chain to detect its perturbation on lipid bilayers containing different cholesterol concentrations by electron-spin resonance. Our findings were as follows. 1), gp41 FP affects the lipid order in the same manner as previously shown for influenza hemagglutinin FP, i.e., it has a cooperative effect versus the peptide/lipid ratio, supporting our hypothesis that membrane ordering is a common prerequisite for viral membrane fusion. 2), gp41 FP induces membrane ordering in all lipid compositions studied, whereas a nonfusion mutant FP perturbs lipid order to a significantly smaller extent. 3), In high-cholesterol-containing lipid bilayers, where gp41 FP is in the β-aggregation conformation, its effect on the lipid ordering reaches deeper into the bilayer. The different extent to which the two conformers perturb is correlated with their fusogenicity. The possible role of the two conformers in membrane fusion is discussed.
