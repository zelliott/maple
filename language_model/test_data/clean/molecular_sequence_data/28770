The major chaperone genes of Helicobacter pylori are negatively regulated by HspR, a homologue of the repressor of the dnaK operon of Streptomyces coelicolor. Using an in vitro selection and amplification approach we identified two new chromosomal binding sites of the HspR protein. Both binding sites were characterized by footprinting analysis with purified HspR protein. Intriguingly, these HspR binding sites are located at the 3prime prime or minute ends of two genes coding for predicted proteins with functions unrelated to those of chaperones. This suggests that H. pylori HspR may regulate the expression of genes encoding proteins with diverse functions. Nucleotide sequence alignment of HspR-binding sites highlights conserved nucleotides extending outside the previously proposed consensus binding sequence with structural features predicting geometry of HspR binding as an oligomer.
