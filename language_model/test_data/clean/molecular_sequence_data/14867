The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) plays an important role in an organism's ability to respond to pathogens. Immunogenetic diversity is advantageous as it permits the recognition of more external antigens. For this reason, MHC and immune gene variation are considered a barometer for the genetic health of wild populations. Mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) were previously shown to have little variation at the MHC Class II Oram-DRB locus, which was attributed to population bottlenecks during the last glacial maximum (LGM). In this paper, we extended the analysis of immunogenetic variability in mountain goats to 5 genes representing the 3 classes of MHC gene (Class I OLA, Class II DRA and DRB, and Class III TNF-Î±) and the natural resistance-associated macrophage protein. We sequenced approximately 3000 bp from 31 individuals sampled across the range of mountain goats and found very low levels of diversity (1-3 polymorphic sites per gene) with the exception of the Class I Oram-OLA gene. Oram-OLA was nearly 30 times more diverse than the other immune genes and appears to represent a source of increased immunogenetic diversity. This diversity may be attributed to multiple loci, mediated by pathogen exposure, or potentially influenced by social factors. The distribution of SNPs was not associated with refugial history, suggesting that the current distribution of immunogenetic diversity was present prior to the LGM. These data suggest that although they have low levels of diversity at the 4 of 5 immune loci, mountain goats may be better equipped for future climate oscillations and pathogen exposure than previously thought.
