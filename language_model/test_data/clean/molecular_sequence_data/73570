meta-Cleavage dioxygenase genes were isolated from the benzoate-assimilating bacteria Pseudomonas stutzeri A401 and Pseudomonas mendocina KC37. The gene products had the enzymatic activity of 2,3-dihydroxy-biphenyl-1,2-dioxygenase. Phylogenetic analysis based on the alignment of amino acid sequences suggests that these enzymes are distantly related to other meta-cleavage enzymes and may be members of a new family of extradiol dioxygenases.
