The alpha-helical coiled coil is a valuable folding motif for protein design and engineering. By means of phage display technology, we selected a capable binding partner for one strand of a coiled coil bearing a charged amino acid in a central hydrophobic core position. This procedure resulted in a novel coiled coil pair featuring an opposed Glu-Lys pair arranged staggered within the hydrophobic core of a coiled coil structure. Structural investigation of the selected coiled coil dimer by CD spectroscopy and MD simulations suggest that a buried salt bridge within the hydrophobic core enables the specific dimerization of two peptides.
