A novel method to monitor specific peptidase activities in biological samples as complex as undiluted plasma/blood is described. The approach is based on the design of synthetic polypeptide substrates in which di- or triarginine sequences are linked to each other via one or more other amino acids recognized specifically by the peptidase to be determined. Detection of chymotrypsin and renin activities using synthetic substrates P4 (F-R-R-R-F-V-R-R-F-NH2) and P5 (R-R-R-L-L-R-R-L-L-R-R-R), respectively, serves to demonstrate the principles of this new assay system. A polyion-sensitive membrane electrode, prepared by doping polymer films with dinonylnaphthalene-sulfonate (DNNS), is shown to exhibit significant nonequilibrium electromotive force (EMF) responses toward these and other polycationic substrates at microgram/milliliter levels under physiological conditions. The same electrode, however, exhibits much smaller total EMF response toward the shorter fragments of the synthetic peptides generated by peptidase activity; hence, the addition of peptidase to a solution containing the synthetic substrate yields a change in electrode EMF response, the rate of which is proportional to the activity of peptidase present. Other synthetic polycationic peptides as well as natural polycationic peptides (e.g., protamine) that lack specific cleavage sites for chymotrypsin and renin, yet are detected by the DNNS-based membrane electrode, do not elicit any significant change in EMF response in the presence of the peptidases, confirming the feasibility and utility of the proposed bioanalytical method.
