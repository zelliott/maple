Commitment of cells to the B lineage in chickens occurs only during a brief period of embryogenesis. B cell progenitors then progress through discrete developmental stages resulting in the production of mature B cells that are competent to form a functioning humoral immune system in the adult bird. During embryogenesis, chicken B cell precursors undergo tissue and developmental stage-specific changes in cell-surface glycosylation. Immature B cell progenitors that migrate to the bursa of Fabricius express the carbohydrate epitope sialyl Lewis(x). Such cells undergo initial clonal expansion within the bursa without undergoing gene conversion. Beginning between days 15 and 17 of embryogenesis, B cells in the bursa undergo a tissue specific change in surface glycosylation that results in the loss of sialyl Lewis(x) expression and the acquisition of the related carbohydrate structure Lewis(x). Expression of Lewis(x) identifies B lymphocytes that have begun to undergo gene conversion. Before emigration from the bursa, bursal lymphocytes undergo another phenotypic switch in glycosylation and down-regulate Lewis(x) expression. Therefore, developmental switches in glycosylation allow us to distinguish three populations of B cells in the bursa of Fabricius at defined stages of development and suggest that regulation of cell-surface glycosylation plays a role in B cell development in the chicken.
