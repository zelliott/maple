N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM), which reacts readily with exposed sulfhydryl groups, has been shown to inhibit the activity of the microtubule (MT) motors kinesin, Ncd, and dynein. Currently, the mechanism of inhibition is not known for any of these proteins. To investigate the mechanism by which NEM inhibits Ncd, the recombinant Ncd motor-stalk protein MC1 (modified claret 1) was treated with varying concentrations of NEM (0-10 mM) and cosedimentation and ATPase assays were used to assess the effects of modification on MC1 interactions with MTs. In the cosedimentation assay, treatment with </=0.1 mM NEM enhanced MC1 binding to MTs in the presence of MgATP but had no effect on MC1 binding to MTs in the presence of MgAMP-PNP. In comparison, treatment with >/=0.5 mM NEM induced aggregation of MC1 and resulted in sedimentation of the motor in the absence of MTs. NEM modification had no effect on the basal ATPase rate but produced a decrease in the MT-stimulated ATPase rate. Labeling of MC1 with [3H]NEM indicated that enhanced MT binding was associated with an average labeling of 1 Cys residue per MC1 polypeptide, while aggregation was associated with an average labeling of 2 Cys residues per MC1 polypeptide. Protein digestion, structural analysis, and mass spectrometry indicate that modification of Cys313 or Cys324 in the stalk domain is correlated with enhanced binding of MC1 to MTs. These results suggest that NEM enhances Ncd binding to MTs by disruption of neck and/or stalk function and demonstrate the importance of this region in motor function.
