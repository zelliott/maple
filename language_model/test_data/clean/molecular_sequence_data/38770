Lactobacillus collinoides is a lactic acid bacterium commonly found in fermenting apple juice. Although this bacterium is not particularly involved in malolactic conversion, the presence of L. collinoides in cider may have serious consequences on the product. L. collinoides is indeed considered to be responsible for the transformation of glycerol to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA), a precursor of acrolein that spoils the product quality by generating bitter tastes. The purpose of our work was to evaluate the influence of environmental and culture conditions on the conversion of glycerol to 3-HPA in L. collinoides, and to obtain a DNA probe of the gene coding for glycerol dehydratase, the enzyme responsible for this conversion.
