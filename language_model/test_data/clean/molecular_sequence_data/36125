Mutations in gene promoter/regulatory regions represent an important class of lesion causing human genetic disease. Such mutations are associated with either increases or decreases in transcriptional activity mediated by the altered binding behaviour of trans-acting protein factors to specific DNA sequences in the promoter region. Although most promoter mutations are individually very infrequent, some occur at polymorphic frequencies. Both categories of lesion are likely to be important in clinical medicine and their study has already led to new insights into the mechanisms underlying the regulation of human genes.
