Fifteen physicochemical descriptors of side chains of the 20 natural and of 26 non-coded amino acids are compiled and simple methods for their evaluation described. The relevance of these parameters to account for hydrophobic, steric, and electric properties of the side chains is assessed and their intercorrelation analyzed. It is shown that three principal components, one steric, one bulk, and one electric (electronic), account for 66% of the total variance in the available set. These parameters may prove to be useful for correlation studies in series of bioactive peptide analogues.
