A Gram-staining-negative, yellow-coloured, strictly aerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium, designated HS39(T), isolated from a soil sample collected from a natural Populus euphratica forest in Xinjiang, China, was characterized using a polyphasic approach. The isolate grew optimally at 30-37&emsp14;°C, at pH&emsp14;6.5-8.0 and with 0-3 % NaCl. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain HS39(T) revealed that it is a member of the genus Sphingobacterium. Sphingobacterium mizutaii ATCC 33299(T) was the nearest relative (94.0 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 40.2 mol%. The major fatty acids were iso-C₁₅:₀, iso-C₁₇:₀ 3-OH and summed feature 3 (comprising C₁₆:₁ω6c and/or C₁₆:₁ω7c). The predominant isoprenoid quinone was MK-7. On the basis of phenotypic properties and phylogenetic inference, strain HS39(T) represents a novel species of the genus Sphingobacterium, for which the name Sphingobacterium shayense sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is HS39(T) (=CCTCC AB 209006(T) =NRRL B-59203(T)).
