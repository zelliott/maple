Phylogenetic analysis was performed on the sequences of 44 Polish isolates of equine arteritis virus that were isolated from the semen of stallions from national and private studs, collected during 2001--2005. These sequences were also compared with 41 reference strains previously described and commonly used in phylogenesis. On the basis of the nucleotide sequence analysis of the ORF5 gene, encoding the glycoprotein GP5, it was demonstrated that the Polish EAV isolates belonged to two subgroups and showed the closest relationship to the European strains. Similar results were obtained using the nucleotide sequences of the ORF7 gene. The nucleotide identity between the ORF5 and ORF7 sequences of all Polish isolates was in the range of 80.1-99.0% and 93.6-100%, respectively. The analysis of genetic diversity within the ORF5 sequences enabled a retrospective epizootic investigation. This study suggested that some of the EAV shedding stallions were probably infected before they were moved to Poland.
