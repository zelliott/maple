Restriction mapping and sequence analysis of the gene encoding the rat beta 2 adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR) revealed an error affecting most of the 5'-flanking domain, located between -192 and -2245 bp in the only published sequence of this gene [Buckland et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 18 (1990) 682]. The correct sequence lacks a TATA box, contains 67% G + C residues in the first 500 nucleotides upstream from the start codon, and contains putative glucocorticoid, thyroid hormone and cAMP-response elements.
