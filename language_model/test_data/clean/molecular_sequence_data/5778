Malonate decarboxylase from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus was isolated and characterized (Kim, Y.S., Byun, H.S., J. Biol. Chem. 269 (1994) 29636-29641), and its subunits were reanalyzed recently to be alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. The genes for the subunits, MdcA (548 a.a.), B (295 a.a.), C (238 a.a.), and D (102 a.a.), of the enzyme have been cloned by using oligonucleotide primers deduced from amino acid sequences of peptides isolated from the purified enzyme, and sequenced to be clustered in an operon in the order of A-D-B-C. The operon was found to encode more genes than mdcABCD. The Escherichia coli, transformed with the vector containing the insert mdcADBC and about 1.7 kb of an upstream region, expressed the four subunits of the enzyme but the proteins did not show enzyme activity. It indicates that, like the enzymes from Malonomonas rubra and Klebsiella pneumoniae, more genes are needed for the formation of the functional malonate decarboxylase.
