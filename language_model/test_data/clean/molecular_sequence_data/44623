Cytoplasmic aggregation is an early resistance-associated event that is observed in potato tissues either after penetration of an incompatible race of Phytophthora infestans, the potato late blight fungus, or after treatment with hyphal wall components (HWC) prepared from P. infestans. In potato cells in suspension culture, the number of cells with cytoplasmic aggregation increased upon treatment with HWC, but such an increase was suppressed by treatment with cytochalasin D prior to treatment with HWC. This result suggested that cytoplasmic aggregation in cultured potato cells might be connected with the association of actin filaments. To identify the molecular basis of cytoplasmic aggregation, we purified actin and actin-related proteins by affinity chromatography on a column of immobilized DNase I from cultured potato cells and isolated proteins of 43 kDa, 32 kDa and 22 kDa. Analysis of the amino-terminal amino acid sequences indicated that the 43 kDa, 32 kDa and 22 kDa proteins were potato actin, basic chitinase and osmotin-like protein, respectively. This conclusion was supported by the results of Western blotting analysis of the 43 kDa and 32 kDa proteins with antibodies against actin and basic chitinase. Binding analysis with actin coupled to actin-specific antibodies and biotinylated actin suggested that the 32 kDa and 22 kDa proteins had actin-binding activity. In addition, examination of biomolecular interactions using an optical biosensor confirmed the binding of chitinase to actin. These results imply the possibility that basic chitinase and osmotin-like protein might be involved in cytoplasmic aggregation, hereby participating.
