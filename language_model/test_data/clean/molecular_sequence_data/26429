Bovine parathyroid hormone (PTH) 1-34 [bPTH(1-34)] and human PTH related protein [hPTHrP(1-34)] stimulated cAMP accumulation in opossum kidney (OK) cells with Km of 5 x 10(-9) M, but inhibition of phosphate uptake was obtained with 17-fold lower Km of 3 x 10(-10) M. Phosphate uptake was partially inhibited with [Nle8.18Tyr34]bPTH(3-34)NH2 without concomitant cAMP stimulation. With hPTHrP(7-34)NH2, cAMP accumulation was increased in parallel to inhibition of phosphate uptake. [D-Trp12Tyr34]bPTH(7-34)NH2 and [Tyr34]hPTH(7-34)NH2 had no agonist activity on cellular cAMP and inhibition of phosphate uptake. bPTH(1-34)-stimulated cAMP accumulation was antagonized by [Nle8.18Tyr34]bPTH(3-34)NH2, [D-Trp12Tyr34]bPTH(7-34)NH2, hPTHrP(7-34)NH2 and [Tyr34]hPTH(7-34)NH2 with Ki of 1.4 x 10(-7), 2 x 10(-7), 4.7 x 10(-7) and 3.7 x 10(-6) M, respectively. But [Nle8.18Tyr34]bPTH(3-34)NH2 and [D-Trp12Tyr34]bPTH(7-34)NH2 reversed the inhibition of phosphate uptake only marginally, and hPTHrP(7-34)NH2 and [Tyr34]hPTH(7-34)NH2 were inactive. With hPTHrP(1-34) the Ki for cAMP accumulation of [Nle8,18Tyr34]bPTH(3-34)NH2 and hPTHrP(7-34)NH2 were 1.9 x 10(-7) and 7.2 x 10(-7) M, and inhibition of phosphate uptake was partially reversed with [Nle8,18Tyr34]bPTH(3-34)NH2, but not with hPTHrP(7-34)NH2. The present results indicate that truncated hPTHrP(7-34)NH2, unlike [Tyr34]hPTH(7-34)NH2 and [D-Trp12Tyr34]bPTH(7-34)NH2, elevates cellular cAMP and inhibits phosphate uptake. bPTH(1-34)- and hPTHrP(1-34)-evoked cAMP accumulation is suppressed by PTH and PTHrP fragments while inhibition of phosphate uptake remains largely unaltered.
