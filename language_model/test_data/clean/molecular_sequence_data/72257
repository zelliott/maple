Based on sequence analyses of 17 complete centromeric DNA monomers from ten different deer species, a model is proposed for the genesis, evolution, and genomic organization of cervid satellite I DNA. All cervid satellite I DNA arose from the initial amplification of a 31-bp DNA sequence. These 31-bp subrepeats were organized in a hierarchical fashion as 0.8-kb monomers in plesiometacarpalia deer and 1-kb monomers in telemetacarpalia deer. The higher-order repeat nature of cervid centromeric satellite DNA monomers accounts for their high intragenomic and intraspecific sequence conservation. Such high intraspecific sequence conservation validates the use of a single cervid satellite I DNA monomer from each deer species for interspecific sequence comparisons to elucidate phylogenetic relationships. Also, a specific 0.18-kb tandem duplication was observed in all 1-kb monomers, implying that 1-kb cervid satellite I DNA monomers arose from an unequal crossover event between two similar 0.8-kb ancestral DNA sequences.
