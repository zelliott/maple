A part of the 5'-noncoding region of echovirus type 9 isolates was sequenced, and an attempt was made for rapid virus detection in clinical samples obtained from 22 subjects hospitalized with aseptic meningitis. The sequence identity of 440-bp products amplified from the region by RT-PCR was 87.7% between the standard echovirus type 9(Hill strain) and the isolates. Specific IgM antibodies to Hill strain were positive in 45.5% by immunofluorescent antibody staining of virus-infected cells. A high detection rate of PCR products was observed in cerebrospinal fluids (CSFs; 54.5%) at admission, and in peripheral mononuclear cells (PMCs; 72.7%) at the end of hospitalization. Viral genomes were detectable for 2 days in serum samples, and for 6 days in PMC samples after onset of disease. When specific IgM antibody titers were less than 1:40, the amplification rate of viral genome from serum samples was 50.0%. These results indicate that the combination of specific IgM determination and viral genome amplification from CSFs will be a rapid and reliable method for early diagnosis.
