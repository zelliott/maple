Changes in the expression and localization of luteal mRNA for PGF(2alpha) (FP) receptors may be critical in determining the luteolytic action of PGF(2alpha) in pig corpora lutea. In this study, a full-length FP receptor (FPr) cDNA was isolated and cloned from pig corpora lutea. This isolate (GenBank accession no. U91520) contains an open reading frame of 1086 bases coding for a protein of 362 amino acids with seven potential transmembrane domains. The predicted amino acid sequence of this isolate was 83% identical to the FPr amino acid sequence of other species including sheep, cattle and humans. Northern blot analysis showed the presence of an FPr message of about 5 kb in mRNA from pig corpora lutea. Relatively weak FPr mRNA expression was detected on day 4 and day 7 of the oestrous cycle. The expression was greater (P < 0.05) on days 10, 13 and 15 than on days 4 and 7. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that mRNA for FPr was expressed predominantly in the steroidogenic large luteal subtype of cell, although there was some expression in small luteal cells, with histological appearance of steroidogenic small cells. Localization of hybridization signals of FPr was observed in luteal tissue at all stages examined. These data demonstrate that FPr is expressed in pig corpora lutea throughout the oestrous cycle and that upregulation of the FPr mRNA occurs when the corpora lutea becomes sensitive to PGF(2alpha). Direct luteal targets of PGF(2alpha) appear to be primarily large steroidogenic cells in this species.
