Natural resistance of humans to the cattle pathogen Trypanosoma brucei brucei has been attributed to the presence in human serum of nonimmune factors that lyse the parasite. Normal human serum contains two trypanosome lytic factors (TLFs). TLF1 is a 500-kDa lipoprotein, which is reported to contain apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), haptoglobin-related protein (Hpr), hemoglobin, paraoxonase, and apoA-II, whereas TLF2 is a larger, poorly characterized particle. We report here a new immunoaffinity-based purification procedure for TLF2 and TLF1, as well as further characterization of the components of each purified TLF. Immunoaffinity-purified TLF1 has a specific activity 10-fold higher than that of TLF1 purified by previously described methods. Moreover, we find that TLF1 is a lipoprotein particle that contains mainly apoA-I and Hpr, trace amounts of paraoxonase, apoA-II, and haptoglobin, but no detectable hemoglobin. Characterization of TLF2 reveals that it is a 1,000-kDa protein complex containing mainly immunoglobulin M, apoA-I, and Hpr but less than 1% detectable lipid.
