Interleukin-18 binding protein is a novel glycoprotein that we successfully cloned and expressed. First, murine interleukin-18 binding protein was purified from the sera of mice with endotoxin shock using ligand affinity chromatography. The murine interleukin-18 binding protein cDNA was cloned after RT-PCR using mixed primer pair sequences based on partial murine interleukin-18 binding protein amino acid sequence analysis. Subsequently, human interleukin-18 binding protein cDNA was cloned from cDNA libraries of normal human liver using murine interleukin-18 binding protein cDNA as a probe. Next, we transiently expressed recombinant human and murine interleukin-18 binding proteins in COS-1 cells and purified them from culture supernatants. Both recombinant interleukin-18 binding proteins did not exhibit species specificity and prevented interleukin-18 binding to its receptor. In addition, they inhibited interleukine-18 dependent IFN-gamma production from KG-1 cells effectively. These results suggest that the interleukin-18 binding protein may possess interleukine-18 antagonist activity.
