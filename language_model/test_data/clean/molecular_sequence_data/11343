This paper reviews recent data on the locations and compositions of enzyme systems catalyzing the cleavage of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and pectin polysaccharides in higher plants. The physiological functions and physicochemical properties of certain enzymes degrading pectin polymers in higher plants, fungi, and bacteria are described.
