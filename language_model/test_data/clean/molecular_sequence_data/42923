We have detected the sputa DNA with nonradioactive probe which is labelled to the specific sequence DNA, 31bp-188bp, by dig-11-dUTP. It showed that both the Sensitivity and specificity are satisfactory. The positive rate of the 80 specimens are 56.25%, and the 30 positive specimens of sputum culture are all positive when detected by the Dig-DNA probe.
