Molecular epidemiological investigation was conducted among injecting drug users (IDUs) (n = 11) and heterosexuals (n = 15) in Kunming, Yunnan Province of China. HIV-1 genotypes were determined based on the nucleotide sequences of 2.6-kb gag-RT region. The distribution of genotypes among IDUs was as follows: CRF07_BC (5/11) and CRF08_BC (5/11); subtype B' (1/11). Similarly, a majority of Kunming heterosexuals (14/15) were infected with CRF07_BC (4/15), CRF08_BC (6 /15), or subtype B' (4/15), known to predominate among IDUs in China. This contrasts with trends in the coastal regions of China and surrounding southeastern Asian countries, where CRF01_AE predominates among heterosexuals. The heterosexual HIV-1 epidemic in Kunming thus appears to derive from the local IDU epidemic. Of note, subtype B' was the most prevalent strain among heterosexuals before 1997, while CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC became predominant in 2002, indicating a transition of HIV-1 genotype distribution between the early and the more recent samples from Kunming heterosexuals.
