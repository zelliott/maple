A method is described for the highly selective modification of the alpha-amino groups at the N-termini of unprotected peptides to form stable, modified peptide intermediates which can be covalently coupled to other molecules or to a solid support. Acylation with iodoacetic anhydride at pH 6.0 occurs with 90-98% selectivity for the alpha-amino group, depending on the N-terminal residue (as shown with a series of model hexapeptides containing a competing Lys residue). Although Cys residues must be protected (reversibly or irreversibly) before the anhydride reaction, there are no detectable side reactions of the alpha-amino moiety--of the reagent or of modified peptide--with the side chains of His, Met, or Lys. The reaction works well in denaturants, so that inhibitory effects of noncovalent structure can be minimized. In a second step the iodoacetyl-peptide can be reacted with a thiol group on a protein, on a solid chromatography matrix, on a spectroscopic probe, etc. This is illustrated by reaction of a series of N alpha-iodoacetyl-peptides with murine interferon-gamma, which contains a C-terminal Cys residue. Data are presented which suggest that this iodoacetic anhydride scheme is superior in selectivity for alpha-amino groups to conventional chemical approaches to cross-linking such as use of 2-iminothiolane or N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated carboxylic acid esters. The reaction is ideally suited for modifying peptide fragments, as pure species or as mixtures, derived from proteolytic or chemical fragmentation of proteins. Furthermore, polypeptides synthesized biosynthetically, for example via recombinant DNA techniques, can be cross-linked in this way.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
