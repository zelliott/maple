The epitope of an immunogenic peptide can be partially replaced with peptide fragments from various pathogens without any detrimental effect to their anchoring within the binding groove of MHC class II molecules. Using this principle, effective peptide vaccines against influenza Aichi virus have been found to induce antibody responses that neutralize virus in vitro.
