Cytosolic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase (E.C. 4.1.3.5) is a highly regulated enzyme involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis and therefore a potential target for cholesterol-lowering drugs. Up to now, primary structure data have only been available for chicken, rat and hamster HMG-CoA synthase. Using in vitro amplification and direct sequencing, we have determined the nucleotide sequence of the coding region of the human cytosolic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthase cDNA.
