The arom gene, encoding a single polypeptide that catalyses five consecutive steps of the pre-chorismate aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway, has been cloned from the opportunistic pathogen Pneumocystis carinii. There is a single open reading frame of 4788 bp which includes an intron of 45 bp that does not introduce a stop codon into the sequence. Thus, the derived amino acid sequence consists of 1581 residues, which is highly homologous to all fungal AROM proteins studied to date. These data support the view that P. carinii is a fungus and imply that its aromatic amino acid biosynthesis is conventionally organized.
