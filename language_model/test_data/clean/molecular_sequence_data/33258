Caged aptamers represent valuable tools for the spatiotemporal control of protein function by light. Here we describe a general route starting with the de novo selection process targeting cytohesin-1 and aiming at the synthesis of caged aptamers without the prior knowledge of detailed structural determinants of aptamer-target binding.
