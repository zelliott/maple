The product of the Drosophila easter gene, a member of the trypsin family of serine proteases, must be more active ventrally than dorsally to promote normal embryonic polarity. The majority of the easter protein in the embryo is present in the unprocessed zymogen form and appears to be evenly distributed in the extracellular space, indicating that the asymmetric activity of wild-type easter must arise post-translationally. A dominant mutant form of easter that does not require cleavage of the zymogen for activity (ea delta N) is active both dorsally and ventrally. The ea delta N mutant bypasses the requirement for five other maternal effect genes, indicating that these five genes exert their effects on dorsal-ventral patterning solely by controlling the activation of the easter zymogen. We propose that dorsal-ventral asymmetry is initiated by a ventrally-localized molecule in the vitelline membrane that nucleates an easter zymogen activation complex, leading to the production of ventrally active easter enzyme.
