A novel protein expressed by entero-endocrine cells of the mouse stomach was named prepromotilin Related Peptide (ppMTLRP) since it shares sequence similarities with the prepromotilin (Tomasetto et al.). The mouse ppMTLRP was found identical to the rat precursor of ghrelin (ppghrelin), an endogenous ligand specific for the Growth Hormone Secretagogue receptor identified from rat stomach (Kojima et al.). In the present study the cDNA encoding the dog counterpart of ppMTLRP/Ghrelin has been isolated and sequenced. The dog ppMTLRP/Ghrelin cDNA showed scores of respectively 80% and 75% homology with its human and mouse counterparts. By translation of the dog ppMTLRP/Ghrelin cDNA sequences, two ORFs could be deduced encoding either a 117 amino acid ppMTLRP/Ghrelin or the deleted Gln14 ppMTLRP/Ghrelin, as it was also known in mouse, rat and man. The dog ppMTLRP/Ghrelin shared 91% similarity and 78% identity, and 89% similarity and 78% identity with the human and mouse ppMTLRP/Ghrelin proteins respectively. The best score of homology was found in the MTLRP/Ghrelin sequence itself. Indeed the dog MTLRP/Ghrelin peptide shared 100% similarity and 93% identity, and 96% identity and similarity, with the human and mouse MTLRP/Ghrelin. Using Northern blot analysis to study dog ppMTLRP/Ghrelin gene expression on dog adult gut tissues, maximal expression level was found in the stomach fundus and corpus, and no expression could be detected in the stomach antrum nor in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon or liver. In conclusion, we have identified ppMTLRP/Ghrelin from dog, and found that it is highly conserved with man, mouse or rat. The expression pattern along the gastro-intestinal tract is similar to the expression pattern previously described in mouse.
