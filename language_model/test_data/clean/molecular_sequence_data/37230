Members of the DEAD-box family of helicases, distinguished by a core characteristic sequence of Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp, are expressed in a wide range of prokaryotes and eukaryotes and exhibit diverse cellular functions, including DNA transcription, recombination and repair, RNA processing, translation, and posttranslational regulation. Although ubiquitous, the function of most DEAD-box proteins is unknown. We and others have recently cloned DP103, which harbors conserved DEAD-box, helicase, and ATPase domains in its N terminus. DP103 (also termed Gemin3 and DDX20) interacts with SF-1, SMN, EBNA2, and EBNA3C in mammalian cells. Here we demonstrate that a discrete domain within the nonconserved C-terminal region of DP103 directly interacts with SF-1. This domain exhibits an autonomous repression function and is necessary and sufficient for repressing the transcriptional activity of SF-1. Furthermore, intact DP103 exhibits helicase activity. Importantly, the C-terminal domain is obligatory but not sufficient for this unwinding activity of DP103. Together, our results support a novel paradigm for transcriptional repression and demonstrate the bifunctional role of the C-terminal domain of DP103.
