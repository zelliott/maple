Pythium apiculatum sp. nov. is a new oomycete characterized by the presence of both ornamented and smooth-walled oogonia. The ornamentations are blunt, and at times, bent. The oomycete was isolated from soil samples taken in a vineyard in the Burgundian region of France. Morphologically, it resembles some species having ornamented oogonia like Pythium radiosum, Pythium echinulatum, and resembles, also the species having smooth-walled oogonia like Pythium hypogynum and Pythium acrogynum. However, the oomycete has its own distinguishing characteristics which, when combined with molecular features, enables us to describe it as a new species. The taxonomic description of this new oomycete, its comparison with related species, and the sequence of the ITS region of its rRNA gene, are described in this article.
