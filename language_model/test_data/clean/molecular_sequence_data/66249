The genomic content of Enterobacter sakazakii strain ATCC BAA-894 was analyzed for variable-number tandem repeats (VNTRs). In this study we report the development of a multiple-locus VNTR analysis (MLVA) strategy for the subtyping of E. sakazakii. The method is based on a GeneScan analysis of four VNTR loci labeled with multiple fluorescent dyes. This approach was applied to a collection of 112 isolates representing all 16 of the currently defined E. sakazakii biogroups. MLVA successfully discriminated among these isolates and compared favorably with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The method was relatively fast and easy to perform. The potential value of MLVA as an epidemiological tool is discussed.
