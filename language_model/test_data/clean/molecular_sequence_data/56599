The SLP2 plasmid had previously been demonstrated genetically to exist in Streptomyces lividans by its ability to promote conjugation and to elicit 'pocks' on recipient (SLP2-) cultures, but it had not been physically detected. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, a 50 kb linear DNA was isolated from SLP2+ but not SLP2- strains of S. lividans, and from Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces parvulus strains to which SLP2 had been transferred by conjugation or transformation. We conclude that this linear DNA is SLP2. The terminal fragments of SLP2 were cloned. The determined sequences revealed a 44bp imperfect terminal inverted repeat. The terminal 12bp sequence of SLP2 was identical to those of two other Streptomyces linear plasmids, pSLA2 and pSCL, and similar to the terminal sequences of another Streptomyces linear plasmid, SCP1. The termini of SLP2 DNA were resistant to digestion by lambda exonuclease and ExoIII. A truncated (probably crippled) copy of Tn4811 is present on the plasmid. While the SLP2 plasmid exists as a free form in the host, a 15.7 kb sequence corresponding to the segment of SLP2 from Tn4811 to the right terminus is also present (at a copy number similar to the free form) elsewhere in the genome of S. lividans. Furthermore, SLP2 is partially homologous to a newly discovered 650 kb linear plasmid in S. parvulus.
