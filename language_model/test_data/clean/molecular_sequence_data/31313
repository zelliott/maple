Analysis of DNA-protein structures composed of nuclear matrix attached DNA and the most tightly bound proteins was performed. Although the previously described non-histone proteins (1) were present the buoyant density of the complex was the same as that of pure DNA. RNA inaccessible to RNase in 0.4 M NaCl but digestible in low ionic strength buffer was detected. This RNA is not a nascent one. It turned out to be homogeneous and represent a novel type of small nuclear RNA. Partial sequence of this RNA is presented.
