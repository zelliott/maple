The authors cloned the nearly complete cDNA of human neuronatin with the aid of an expressed sequence tag (EST) database, and analyzed its expression in various human tissues by Northern blot analysis. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the human neuronatin showed a high similarity to those of rodents. The Northern blot analysis revealed that the human neuronatin message was expressed predominantly in the fetal brain in the brain-specific manner, but only faintly in the adult brain. Among the various adult human tissues examined, the anterior pituitary gland was shown to be the only place where the neuronatin mRNA was strongly expressed. Intense neuronatin expression was also observed in several human pituitary adenomas, including ACTH-producing, GH-producing, and nonfunctioning adenomas, but hardly detected in other brain tumors.
