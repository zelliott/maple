To understand more directly the tissue defect in osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), bone matrix was analyzed from an infant with lethal OI (type II) of defined mutation (collagen alpha 2(I)Gly580-->Asp). Pepsin-solubilized alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) chains and derived CNBr-peptides migrated more slowly on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis compared with normal human controls. The peptide alpha 2(I)CB3,5, predicted to contain the mutation site, ran as a retarded doublet band and was purified by high performance liquid chromatography and digested with V8 protease. Two peptides with amino-terminal sequences beginning at residue 576 of the alpha 2(I) chain were isolated. One had the normal sequence. The other differed in that aspartic acid replaced glycine at residue 580 as predicted from cDNA analysis, and in having an unhydroxylated proline at residue 579. From yields on microsequencing and the relative intensities of the two forms of alpha 2(I)CB3,5 on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the ratio of mutant to normal alpha 2(I) chains in the infant's bone matrix was 0.7/1. Although the effects of an efficient incorporation of mutant chains on the properties of the bone matrix are unknown, it may be that in this OI case the tissue abnormalities result more from the presence of mutant protein than from an underexpression of matrix.
