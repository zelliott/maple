The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV-DNA) in serum samples of 104 chronic HBV carriers. Of 22 patients positive for both HBV surface (HBsAg) and HBVe (HBeAg) antigens, seven were positive for HBV-DNA on dot blot hybridisation, and all 22 positive in the PCR. Of 41 HBsAg positive patients who had antibodies against HBeAg (anti-HBe), only three were positive for DNA-HBV on dot blot hybridisation, however DNA was detected in 30 of them with the PCR. Similarly, of 41 individuals with antibodies against HBsAg (anti-HBs), 23 yielded positive results in the PCR technique, although dot blot hybridisation detected HBV-DNA in only one patient. These results indicate that while serological and conventional DNA hybridisation assays are not sensitive enough to determine the infectivity of HBV chronic carriers, PCR is an accurate method for establishing the status and progression of disease in these patients.
