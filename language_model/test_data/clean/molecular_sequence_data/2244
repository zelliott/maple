Platelet membrane GPIIbIIIa is a member of the family receptors named integrins that recognize RGD sequences in their ligands. GPIIbIIIa interacts with at least three different adhesive ligands: fibrinogen, fibronectin, and von Willebrand factor. These interactions are inhibited by RGD-containing peptides and by peptides corresponding to a sequence unique to fibrinogen in the COOH-terminal domain of its gamma chain (HLGGAKQAGDV). Two RGD sequences are present in fibrinogen A alpha chain: an RGDS sequence at A alpha 572-575, and an RGDF sequence at A alpha 95-98. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the RGDF sequence and the gamma COOH-terminal domain both reacted specifically with fibrinogen in solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunoprecipitated the protein in solution. The Fab fragments prepared from these antibodies inhibited fibrinogen-platelet interaction and aggregation. These results demonstrate that these two sequences are both accessible within the fibrinogen molecule and are both implicated in ligand binding and cell-cell interaction. In addition, by further examining the interaction of the gamma chain peptide with platelets, it was found that RGDF and the gamma peptide produced a similar dose-dependent inhibition of the binding of the labeled gamma peptide to ADP-stimulated platelets. These results provide evidence that the RGDF sequence present at the A alpha 95-98 constitutes with the gamma 401-411 sequence two recognition sites interacting with the same site or with mutually exclusive sites on GPIIbIIIa.
