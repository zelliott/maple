Betabellin 15D is a 64-residue, disulfide-bridged homodimer. When folded into a beta structure, the protein is predicted to have two clusters of three histidine residues, each cluster able to bind a divalent metal ion. When the protein was incubated with Cu2+, Zn2+, Co2+, or Mn2+, metal complexes of betabellin 15D were observed by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry. The relative abundances of the ionic complexes suggested an order of affinities of Cu2+ > Zn2+ > Co2+ > Mn2+, consistent with solution-phase affinities for nitrogen- or sulfur-containing ligands. Limited proteolysis of betabellin 15D by immobilized pepsin, as measured by nanoelectrospray-ionization mass spectrometry, showed that the Phe12-Ser13 peptide bond of betabellin 15D was cleaved more slowly in the presence of Cu2+ than in its absence. Because Cu2+ has little or no effect on the catalytic rate of pepsin, the slower cleavage of the Phe12-Ser13 peptide bond may be due to its decreased accessibility caused by Cu(2+)-induced folding of betabellin 15D.
