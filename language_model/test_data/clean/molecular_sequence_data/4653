Heparin/heparan-sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) binds to heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) through its heparin-binding domain (HBD), which consists of 21 amino acid residues (P21). The CD9 antigen also interacts with a membrane-anchored form of HB-EGF (proHB-EGF) and enhances its juxtacrine activity. The CD9 antigen potentiates the juxtacrine activity of both proHB-EGF and proamphiregulin, but has no effect on proTGF-alpha. While both HB-EGF and amphiregulin contain an HBD, TGF-alpha does not. This suggests that the HBD of HB-EGF is also involved in CD9 antigen binding. Mutant CHO cells which lack HSPG recovered their capacity to bind to immobilized P21 when transfected with CD9 antigen cDNA. This binding was competitively inhibited by heparin in a dose-dependent manner. The interactions between synthetic peptides corresponding to the extracellular domain of CD9 antigen and the immobilized P21 were analyzed with surface plasmon resonance. The 119VIKEVQEFYKDTYNKLKTKD138 sequence of the CD9 antigen is thought to represent the binding site for HB-EGF. The k(D) values for heparin/P21 and 119V-D138/P21 were (2.82+/-0.10) x 10(-8) M and (3.71+/-0.71) x 10(-5) M, respectively. These results suggest that the 119V-D138 sequence of the CD9 antigen is the site which interacts with the HBD and may play an essential role in the upregulation of the juxtacrine activity of proHB-EGF.
