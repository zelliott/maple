Two distinct forms of the O4 antigen (LPS) from E. coli were analysed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Both consisted of D-glucose, L-rhamnose, 2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-L-galactose (L-FucNAc), and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose. Their structures were found to be [formula: see text]. In the O4-specific polysaccharide from E. coli O4:K3, O4:K6, and O4:K12, X is alpha-D-Glcp. In the O4 specific polysaccharide from E. coli O4:K52, the rhamnose residue is not substituted (X = H).
