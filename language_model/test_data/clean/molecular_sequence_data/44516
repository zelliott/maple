Retention of some components within the nucleolus correlates with the presence of rRNA precursors found early in the rRNA processing pathway. Specifically, after most 40S, 38S and 36S pre-rRNAs have been depleted by incubation of Xenopus kidney cells in 0.05 microg/ml actinomycin D for 4 h, only 69% U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), 68% U14 snoRNA and 72% fibrillarin are retained in the nucleolus as compared with control cells. These nucleolar components are important for processing steps in the pathway that gives rise to 18S rRNA. In contrast, U8 snoRNA, which is used for 5.8S and 28S rRNA production, is fully retained in the nucleolus after actinomycin D treatment. Therefore, U8 snoRNA is in a different category than U3 and U14 snoRNA and fibrillarin. It is proposed that U3 and U14 snoRNA and fibrillarin, but not U8 snoRNA, bind to the external transcribed spacer or internal transcribed spacer 1, and when these binding sites are lost after actinomycin D treatment some of these components cannot be retained in the nucleolus. Other binding sites may also exist, which would explain why only some and not all of these components are lost from the nucleolus.
