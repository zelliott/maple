The biological activity of oligopeptide analogues of C3a is markedly increased by N-terminal attachment of a hydrophobic group as, for instance, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), either direct or via a flexible 6-aminohexanoyl (Ahx) spacer. This study presents evidence from fluorescence anisotropy decay measurements that the hydrophobic appendix mediates non-specific binding of the synthetic peptide analogues to phospholipid vesicles. According to quantitative considerations no alternative or additional rate-enhancing mechanisms other than surface diffusion are required to account for the gain in biopotency.
