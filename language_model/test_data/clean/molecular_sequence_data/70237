The past year has seen significant advances in our understanding of the structure and function of yeast ARS elements. These elements, some of which function as chromosomal origins of DNA replication, are modular in structure. An essential domain, the ARS consensus sequence, binds a multiprotein complex that might be the long-sought initiator protein. The flanking domain contains a DNA unwinding element and a binding site for a multifunctional protein that acts as a replication enhancer.
