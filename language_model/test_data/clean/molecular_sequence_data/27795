Previous genetic analysis showed that the polar effects of mutations in the hisG cistron of Salmonella typhimurium are dependent on the presence of a single putative transcription termination element within the hisG gene. In fact, all proximal mutations causing translation termination are strongly polar, whereas distal ones are not. The element was mapped by isolating mutations able to relieve the polar phenotype, and they were found to be small deletions in the region downstream of the translational stop codon (M. S. Ciampi and J. R. Roth, Genetics 118:193-202, 1988). In this study, we analyzed the his-specific RNAs synthesized in vivo in different strains harboring the polar frameshift hisG2148 mutation. The nature of the polarity effects is clearly transcriptional, since shorter RNA molecules were produced. When the hisG2148 mutation was transferred in a rho background or in strains harboring the small distal deletions, an increase in readthrough transcription was observed. The transcriptional termination element was characterized in more detail by performing high-resolution S1 nuclease mapping experiments. This analysis showed that (i) termination or exonucleolytic degradation following termination produced transcripts with heterogeneous 3' ends; (ii) this process is dependent on the transcription termination factor Rho, since relief of termination occurs in a rho background; and (iii) the element appears to function as a transcription terminator, at least to some extent, even in the course of active translation of the hisG cistron.
