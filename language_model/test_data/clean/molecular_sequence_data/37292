In characterising Mycoplasma agalactiae strains from various European countries and from Africa, a new insertion sequence (IS), ISMag1, which is related to IS of the family of IS30 insertion elements, has been identified by DNA sequence analysis and Southern blot hybridisation. ISMag1 has a size of 1515bp, and contains inverted repeats of 3bp and a gene encoding the putative transposase on a single open reading frame. ISMag1 is present only in the rarely isolated serotypes E, F, G and H of M. agalactiae, where it is found in 1 to approximately 30 copies. The different patterns obtained by hybridisation of a labelled probe of ISMag1 to genomic DNA cut with various restriction enzymes correlate to some extent to the different serotypes and to variations of the nucleotide sequences of the uvrC genes of the different strains. Based on uvrC sequences, the strains of M. agalactiae carrying ISMag1 form a cluster, separate from the other strains. IS patterns obtained with ISMag1 allow a fine subtyping of the serotypes E, F, G and H of M. agalactiae for epidemiological studies. The potential role of ISMag1 and of its copy numbers on virulence and persistence of the respective strains requests further studies.
