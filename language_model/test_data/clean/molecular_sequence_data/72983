Seed reserve storage products consisting of proteins, oil and starch are accumulated in a developmentally coordinated pattern. The control of the vacuolar storage protein expression has been shown to be transcriptionally regulated and involves a series of positive and negative regulatory as well as enhancing gene elements. We have analyzed the upstream sequence of the genes encoding the soybean oleosins, the protein that encases the oil body. We have found that soybean oleosin genes possess regulatory elements in upstream domain that are similar to those found in vacuolar storage protein genes.
