The alpha-anomer of 2'-deoxyadenosine 1 is a major adenine lesion produced by hydroxyl radicals in DNA. To assess its biochemical effects on DNA replication, 1 was site-specifically incorporated into oligonucleotide templates using phosphoramidite chemistry. The templates were purified and extensively characterized to ensure their homogeneity and nucleotide sequences.
