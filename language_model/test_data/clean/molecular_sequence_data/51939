Genetic markers with high degrees of polymorphisms are of vital importance in the construction of high resolution (2-4 cM) linkage maps of human chromosomes as specified in the short-term goals of the Human Genome Initiative. In this paper, we report on molecular and genetic characterization and physical localization of 11 new multiallele restriction fragment length polymorphism markers on human chromosome 3p. Ten of these represent three- and four-allele polymorphisms of the base substitution type probably at two adjacent restriction sites. One has been identified as a novel mini-satellite sequence comprising a variable copy number tandem repeat array of a G/T-rich 79-bp sequence. This collection of multiallele polymorphic (PIC values: 0.40-0.60) markers should prove valuable and increase the resolution power of the available chromosome 3p genetic markers.
