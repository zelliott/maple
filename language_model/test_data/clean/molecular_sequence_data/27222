Dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) consists of dentin sialoprotein (DSP) and dentin phosphoprotein (DPP). DSPP is highly expressed in mineralized tissues. However, recent studies have shown that DSPP is also expressed in several active metabolic ductal epithelial tissues and exists in a variety of sequences. We have investigated DSPP expression in various mouse tissues using RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses. To identify DSPP gene polymorphisms, we screened a mouse tooth cDNA library as well as isolated and characterized DSPP variations. Our results show that DSPP is predominantly expressed in teeth and moderately in bone tissues. We also have characterized a full-length DSPP cDNA clone with an open-reading frame of 940 codons and this polyadenylation signal. Compared to previously reported mouse DSPP cDNAs, 13 sequence variations were identified, including 8 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms and an in-frame indel (8 amino acids) at DPP domain of the mouse DSPP. These 8 amino acids are rich in aspartic acid and serine residues. Northern blot assay showed a prominent band at 4.4kb. RT-PCR demonstrated that this mouse DSPP gene was dominantly expressed in teeth. The predicted secondary structure of DPP domain of this DSPP showed differences from the previously published mouse DPPs, implying that they play different roles during tooth development and formation.
