Streptococcus thermophilus is a lactic acid bacterium widely used for the production of fermented dairy products. The two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) protein profile was obtained from three independent analyses of 2-DE gels of soluble proteins of the strain PB18. About 270 spots were detected by silver staining and the average molecular weight and isoelectric point of each protein spot were calculated to be 41 600 and 5.2, respectively. Twelve proteins were purified by chromatographic techniques because their concentration was too low for direct sequencing from blots. Eleven were located in the PB18 2-DE profile after silver staining. These preliminary results contribute to the setting up of a two-dimensional image (or reference map) of the proteins from S. thermophilus in order to identify and compare strains of various origin or to follow metabolic process such as stress. Bidimensional autoradiographs of two strains (PB18 and ST105) of S. thermophilus grown in exponential phase at 42 degrees C with [35S]methionine were compared with an image analysis system. Among the eleven located proteins in the 2-DE silver-stained profile, nine were found in PB18 and eight in ST105 autoradiographs. One protein was specific to PB18. The eight proteins could play the role of internal 2-D PAGE markers of p/ and Mr for S. thermophilus.
