Recombinant proteins from Pichia pastoris need to be fully evaluated before used as diagnostic tools.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether glycosylation by P. pastoris interferes with the specificity of diagnostic tests.

An autoantigen involved in Wegener's disease (protease 3) and 2 major inhalant allergens from grass pollen (Dac g 5) and house dust mite (Der p 1) were produced as recombinant molecules in P. pastoris. O-linked glycans on Dac g 5 were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The immune reactivity of the recombinant proteins was compared to that of their natural counterparts by ELISA and a radio-allergosorbent test (RAST) as well as by ELISA and RAST inhibition.

In contrast to the non-glycosylated natural allergen, recombinant Dac g 5 was shown to carry at least 2 small mannose-containing O-glycans. We showed that both these O-glycans and the N-linked glycans on recombinant protease 3 and recombinant Der p 1 were recognized in ELISA by IgG antibodies in sera of healthy individuals. These IgG responses were closely correlated. The natural autoantigen and allergens were not recognized by IgG antibodies from healthy subjects. The carbohydrate nature of the epitopes recognized by IgG on the recombinant proteins was confirmed by inhibition studies with mannose and yeast mannan. IgE recognition of yeast glycans was observed in 2 out of 9 positive sera from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.

Production of recombinant molecules in yeast (or moulds) can introduce IgG-binding glycans that negatively affect the specificity of diagnostic tests.
