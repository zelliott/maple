Neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase-24.11, EC 3.4.24.11) is a mammalian zinc-endopeptidase involved in the degradation of biologically active peptides. Although no atomic structure is available for this enzyme, site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that its active site resembles closely that of the bacterial zinc-endopeptidase, thermolysin (EC 3.4.24.27). One active site residue of thermolysin, Arg-203, is involved in inhibitor binding by forming hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl group of a residue in the P1 position and also participates in a hydrogen bond network involving Asp-170. Sequence alignment data shows that Arg-717 of neprilysin could play a similar role to Arg-203 of thermolysin. This was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis with Arg-203 of thermolysin and Arg-717 of neprilysin being replaced by methionine residues. This led, in both cases, to decreases in kcat/Km values, of 122-fold for neprilysin and 2300-fold for thermolysin, essentially due to changes in kcat. The Ki values of several inhibitors were also increased for the mutated enzymes. In addition, the replacement of Asp-170 of thermolysin by Ala residue resulted in a decrease in kcat/Km of 220-fold. The results, coupled with a molecular modeling study, suggest that Arg-717 of neprilysin corresponds to Arg-203 of thermolysin and that in both enzymes a hydrogen bond network exists, involving His-142, Asp-170, and Arg-203 in thermolysin and His-583, Asp-650, and Arg-717 in neprilysin, which is crucial for hydrolytic activity.
