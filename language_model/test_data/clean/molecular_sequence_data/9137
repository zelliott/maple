Here, we present the first complete genome sequence of brucellaphage Tbilisi (Tb) and compared it with that of Pr, a broad host-range brucellaphage recently isolated in Mexico. The genomes consist of 41,148 bp (Tb) and 38,253 bp (Pr), they differ mainly in the region encoding structural proteins, in which the genome of Tb shows two major insertions. Both genomes share 99.87% nucleotide identity, a high percentage of identity among phages isolated at so globally distant locations and temporally different occasions. Sequence analysis revealed 57 conserved ORFs, three transcriptional terminators and four putative transcriptional promoters. The co-occurrence of an ORF encoding a putative DnaA-like protein and a putative oriC-like origin of replication was found in both brucellaphages genomes, a feature not described in any other phage genome. These elements suggest that DNA replication in brucellaphages differs from other phages, and might resemble that of bacterial chromosomes.
