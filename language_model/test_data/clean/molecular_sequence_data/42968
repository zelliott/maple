Clivarin (reviparin-sodium) is a homogeneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as determined by the data obtained in molecular profiling studies. The limited biochemical studies carried out indicate that this LMWH has a specific potency of 124 anti-XA IU/mg and a weaker aPTT activity of approximately 30 U/mg. Assay-dependent neutralization of the in vitro effects of reviparin-sodium were noted. Protamine preparations at equigravimetric concentrations effectively neutralized the aPTT and TT effects; however, Heptest and anti-Xa effects were only partially neutralized. In contrast, heparin's effects were completely neutralized by this agent. PF 4 only partially neutralized the effects of reviparin-sodium. Assay-dependent variations were noted in this study. In comparison with heparin, the haemorrhagic effects of reviparin-sodium were much weaker. Reviparin-sodium produced a dose-dependent antithrombotic action in both the intravenous and subcutaneous studies. This agent also showed sustained activity and better bioavailability characteristics than heparin. Reviparin-sodium exhibited a distinct biochemical and pharmacological profile that may be useful in the optimization of LMWH.
