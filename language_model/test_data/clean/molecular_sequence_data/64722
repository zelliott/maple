Metallothionein (MT) has been used widely as a potential molecular marker to detect the deleterious effects of heavy metals in aquatic ecosystem. Here we exposed ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis, to zinc (Zn) and tested the distribution as well as the induction of MT in various tissues such as liver, kidney, intestine and stomach. MT induction was significant in liver tissue, followed by kidney and intestine, whereas no induction was detected in stomach. The gene encoding ayu MT was successfully cloned and characterized. Complete nucleotide sequencing and analysis of the 4.5 kb DNA fragment containing the ayu MT gene revealed that the gene has three exons interrupted by two introns, a 5'-flanking region of about 2.5 kb and about 1.6 kb of 3'-flanking region. In grouper heart and kidney cells, the 2.5 kb promoter containing eight metal responsive elements (MREs), two hepatic nuclear factor 5 responsive elements (HNF5REs) and one cAMP responsive element (CRE) had the highest reporter activity.
