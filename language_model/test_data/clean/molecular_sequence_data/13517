CDKN2 has been implicated as a melanoma susceptibility gene in some kindreds with a family history of this disease. Mutation analysis of CDKN2 in 17 familial melanoma Australian kindreds revealed a paucity of exon mutations and none of the previously described disease-related mutations. One novel germline mutation was found in exon one, Arg24Pro, which segregates with melanoma in 1/17 kindreds. Two previously described polymorphisms, Ala148Thr and a base change at nucleotide 540 were detected and one novel polymorphism in the untranslated region of exon 3 (nucleotide 580) was also found. Together with other recent reports, these findings provide support for CDKN2 as a susceptibility locus for familial melanoma but suggest that other loci are involved in some hereditary melanoma kindreds.
