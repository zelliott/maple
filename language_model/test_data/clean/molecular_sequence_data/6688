Rat skeletal muscle selenoprotein W cDNA was isolated and sequenced. The isolation strategy involved design of degenerate PCR primers from reverse translation of a partial peptide sequence. A reverse transcription-coupled PCR product from rat muscle mRNA was used to screen a muscle cDNA library prepared from selenium-supplemented rats. The cDNA sequence confirmed the known protein primary sequence, including a selenocysteine residue encoded by TGA, and identified residues needed to complete the protein sequence. RNA folding algorithms predict a stem-loop structure in the 3' untranslated region of the selenoprotein W mRNA that resembles selenocysteine insertion sequence (SE-CIS) elements identified in other selenocysteine coding cDNAs. Dietary regulation of selenoprotein W mRNA was examined in rat muscle. Dietary selenium at 0.1 ppm as selenite increased muscle mRNA 4-fold relative to a selenium-deficient diet. Higher dietary selenium produced no further increase in mRNA levels.
