A reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) system was developed using two 20-mer primers located in the potato leafroll virus (PLRV) capsid gene. A 336-bp PCR product was detected from aphids (Myzus persicae) which had been fed on PLRV-infected plants. The PCR band was specific to PLRV as determined by Southern blots and detection by a PLRV-specific probe. As little as 5 min exposure of aphids to PLRV-infected leaves resulted in the presence of PLRV-specific bands in 13% of aphids. However, the percentage of PLRV-positive aphids increased with longer exposure to infected sources and reached 90% after 3-4 days of feeding. PLRV can be detected from a single viruliferous aphid or a single viruliferous aphid combined with up to 29 non-viruliferous aphids. PLRV can be detected from freshly collected aphids, those stored at -70 degrees C, or those stored in 70% ethanol at room temperature for extended periods. This method is applicable to assess the viruliferous nature of aphids caught in yellow-pan traps during the growing season or stored for over a year.
