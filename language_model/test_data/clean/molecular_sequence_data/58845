We have isolated a novel human cDNA, designated RAB2L, that encodes a protein homologous to Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (RalGDS). The predicted sequence of 122 amino acids revealed 39.5% identity with the C-terminal region of human RalGDS. As the C-terminal region of RalGDS is considered to interact with RAS, the product of this novel gene may also play some role in the ras-mediated signal transduction pathway. Northern analysis revealed that the gene RAB2L is expressed in all human tissues examined. We assigned this gene locus to chromosome band 6p21.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
