The genetic determinant responsible for virulence in Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) induced T-cell lymphomagenesis has recently been mapped [J Virol 63:471-480, 1989] by homologous genomic fragment exchange between MoMuLV and MoMuLV-TB to the Clal/Xbal at the 3' end of the genome. This region of MoMuLV and MoMuLV-TB differs in 11 nucleotides. Of these 11 nucleotide differences, 9 are distributed within the two CORE, the two distal NF1, and the two GRE/LVa elements of the enhancer. Since both the CORE binding sites of MoMuLV-TB are mutated with respect to those of MoMuLV, we compared nuclear proteins of a thymus-bone marrow cell line and a T-lymphoma cell line (EMT), which bind to the wild-type and mutant CORE binding sites. Using both the bandshift assay and southwestern analysis with labeled synthetic deoxyoligonucleotides, we showed that a 42-kDa protein from TB and EMT cells bound specifically to the MoMuLV CORE element. The T----C transversion of nucleotide 6 of the CORE consensus, TGTGGT/CTAA, significantly reduced binding of the 42-kDa TB and EMT cell factors. However, the transversion of nucleotide 3 from T----C had little effect on the binding of the 42-kDa protein to the CORE element. In addition, the 42-kDa protein bound weakly to the CCAAT element of MoMuLV. A recombinant virus, NwtTB-6, was generated by introducing the two CORE mutations of MoMuLV-TB into the MoMuLV genome. Although the latency period of NwtTB-6 in the induction of lymphoma was not significantly different from that of MoMuLV, preliminary findings suggest that the lymphoma induced by NwtTB-6 may be more widely distributed.
