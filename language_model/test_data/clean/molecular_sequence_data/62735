We have identified 50 P element-homologous sequences in the genome of Anopheles gambiae by performing homology searches against the public genome database of A. gambiae using the canonical P element from Drosophila melanogaster as a query sequence. While most of these sequences belong to P subfamilies previously described from anopheline mosquitoes, at least four new subfamilies were identified. One of these A. gambiae P elements, which we termed AgPLS, was analysed in detail. AgPLS consists of three exons and does not have inverted terminal repeats. This element retains several of the structural features of other P-encoded peptides, such as motifs involved in DNA-protein and protein-protein interaction, and a motif involved in GTP utilization. Strong sequence and structural similarity to functional P elements, a number of nonsynonymous substitutions that is smaller than that of synonymous substitutions and the presence of putative nuclear localization signals suggest that the A. gambiae elements may retain the capacity for transposition or its repression. These sequences seem to be most closely related to P elements described from Musca domestica and Lucilia cuprina, the only P element hosts known outside the family Drosophilidae.
