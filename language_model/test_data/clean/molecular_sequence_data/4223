The arylamine N-acetyltransferases (NATs) are involved in the metabolism of a variety of different compounds that we are exposed to on a daily basis. Many drugs and chemicals found in the environment, such as those in cigarette smoke, car exhaust fumes and in foodstuffs, can be either detoxified by NATs and eliminated from the body or bioactivated to metabolites that have the potential to cause toxicity and/or cancer. NATs have been implicated in some adverse drug reactions and as risk factors for several different types of cancers. As a result, the levels of NATs in the body have important consequences with regard to an individual's susceptibility to certain drug-induced toxicities and cancers. This review focuses on recent advances in the molecular genetics of the human NATs.
