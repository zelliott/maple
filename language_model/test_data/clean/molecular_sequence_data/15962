Two bovine genomic clones that crosshybridize with HLA-DR beta cDNA have been isolated. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the beta 1, beta 2 and transmembrane (TM) exon regions for one of these clones revealed 70, 89 and 86% identity with the corresponding HLA-DR beta exons. Stop codons are present in the beta 1 and TM exons and a single base deletion toward the 3' end of the TM exon negates the consensus sequence for exon/intron splicing. Therefore, we conclude this is a bovine DR beta-like pseudogene, BoDR beta I. Exon-containing regions have been used as probes in Southern blot analyses of bovine genomic DNA digested with EcoRI. The beta 2 exon of BoDR beta I results in prominent bands of 18.9, 7.8, 7.2, 6.4, 5.6, 3.6, 3.0 and 2.7 kb. Polymorphisms were observed for all but the 18.9 kb band and at least three of these bands were identified in each of the 185 animals sampled. A probe containing the TM exon of BoDR beta I hybridizes only to the 5.6- and 3.6-kb bands, suggesting that these are allelic bands corresponding to this pseudogene. Results from hybridizations of a TM exon-containing probe of the second bovine DR beta-like clone (BoDR beta II) suggest that the 6.4- and 2.7-kb bands correspond to this second bovine gene. A nonpolymorphic 8.1-kb band results from a probe containing the BoDR beta I beta 1 exon. Major differences in frequency for the 6.4/2.7 alleles were found for the four breeds sampled.
