Giardia lamblia trophozoites, like most intestinal parasitic protozoa, undergo fundamental biological changes to survive outside the intestine of their mammalian host by differentiating into infective cysts. This complex process entails the coordinated production, processing, and transport of cyst wall constituents for assembly into a protective cyst wall. Yet, little is known about this process and the identity of cyst wall constituents. We previously identified a 26-kDa cyst wall protein, CWP1. In the present work, using monoclonal antibodies to cyst wall antigens, we cloned the gene that encodes a novel 39-kDa cyst wall protein, CWP2. Expression of CWP1 and CWP2 was induced during encystation with identical kinetics. Soon after synthesis, these two proteins combine to form a stable complex, which is concentrated within the encystation-specific secretory granules before incorporation into the cyst wall. Both proteins contain five tandem copies of a 24-residue leucine-rich repeat, a motif implicated in protein-protein interactions. Unlike CWP1, CWP2 has an extremely basic 121-residue COOH-terminal extension that might be involved in the sorting of these proteins to the secretory granules.
