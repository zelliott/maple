The U14 RNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) required for normal production of 18S rRNA. Depletion of U14 results in impaired processing of pre-rRNA, deficiency in 18S-containing intermediates and marked under-accumulation of mature 18S RNA. The present report describes results of functional mapping of U14, by a variety of mutagenic approaches. Special attention was directed at assessing the importance of sequence elements conserved between yeast and mouse U14 as well as other snoRNA species. Functionality was assessed in a test strain containing a galactose dependent U14 gene. The results show portions of three U14 conserved regions to be required for U14 accumulation or function. These regions include bases in: (i) the 5'-proximal box C region, (ii) the 3'-distal box D region, and (iii) a 13 base domain complementary to 18S rRNA. Point and multi-base substitution mutations in the snoRNA conserved box C and box D regions prevent U14 accumulation. Mutations in the essential 18S related domain do not effect U14 levels, but do disrupt synthesis of 18S RNA, indicating that this region is required for function. Taken together, the results suggest that the box C and box D regions influence U14 expression or stability and that U14 function might involve direct interaction with 18S RNA.
