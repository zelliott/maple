We have determined the structure of the allantoin permease (DAL4) gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The gene putatively encodes a hydrophobic protein with a M(r) of 71,755. It possesses the alternating hydrophobic-hydrophilic regions similar to those found in many other integral membrane proteins. The most striking feature of the allantoin permease component encoded by DAL4 is its striking similarity to the uracil permease component encoded by FUR4. Although data available indicate that these proteins do not share any overlap of function, their predicted protein sequences are 68% identical, 81% similar, and their DNA sequences are 70% identical. The upstream regulatory region of DAL4 contains all of the characterized cis-acting elements previously reported for inducible allantoin pathway genes: six sequences homologous to UASNTR, the element responsible for nitrogen catabolite repression-sensitive activation of allantoin pathway gene expression, and two sequences homologous to the cis-acting element responsible for inducer-responsiveness of the allantoin pathway genes, UIS. The finding of these homologous sequences predicted to exist on the basis of DAL4's expression characteristics, supports and strengthens the suggestion that these elements mediate the functions we have previously ascribed to them.
