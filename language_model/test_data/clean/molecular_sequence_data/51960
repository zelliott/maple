The zebrafish has drawn a great deal of attention as a developmental system because it offers the ability to combine excellent embryology and genetics. Here, we report that simple sequence repeats are abundant in the zebrafish genome and are highly polymorphic between two outbred lines, making them useful markers for the construction of a genetic map of this organism.
