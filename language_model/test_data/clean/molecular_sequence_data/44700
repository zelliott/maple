The dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1 (DMP1) gene has been mapped to human chromosome 4q21 and shown to exhibit no recombination with the autosomal dominant disorder of dentin formation, dentinogenesis imperfecta type II. In the current study, sequencing of DMP1 cDNA and genomic clones has indicated that the human gene contains an open reading frame of 1539 bp, which predicts a highly acidic, serine-rich protein of 513 amino acids. Comparison of the human DMP1-coding sequence with that of the rat, mouse, and cow indicated that the predicted protein contains a conserved hydrophobic signal peptide sequence and an Arg-Gly-Asp cell attachment sequence. The gene is encoded by six exons, the splicing phase of which is type 0, the first exon containing solely 5' untranslated sequence. Sequencing of each of the coding exons in individuals affected by dentinogenesis imperfecta type II failed to reveal any disease-specific mutations, suggesting that mutations in DMP1 are not causative of this condition at least in the two families examined in this study.
