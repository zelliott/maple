In chloroplasts, all 61 sense codons are found in chloroplast (cp) DNA sequences coding for proteins. However among the sequenced cp tRNAs or tRNA genes, tRNAs with anticodons complementary to codons CUU/C (Leu), CCU/C (Pro), GCU/C (Ala) and CGC/A/G (Arg) [or CGC/A (Arg) in Marchantia] have not been found. In this paper we show that cp tRNA(Ala)(U*GC) cp tRNA(Pro)(U*GG) and cp tRNA(Arg)(ICG) are able to decode the corresponding four-codon family. In the case of leucine codons CUU/C, we show that 'U:U and U:C wobble' mechanisms can operate to allow the reading of these codons by cp tRNA(Leu)(UAm7G).
