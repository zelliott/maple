The possibility of identification and differentiation of maize genotypes by means of RAPD-, SSR- and ISSR-methods was analyzed. DNA of 12 inbred lines and 6 corresponding hybrids of maize were used. Presented methods of the PCR-analysis have allowed unique differentiation and identification of maize genotypes. A formula that describes the results of the DNA polymorphism analysis was proposed.
