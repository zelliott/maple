Partial cDNAs of the human TYRO3 gene, encoding a putative receptor tyrosine kinase, and its processed pseudogene (TYRO3P) were cloned from human teratocarcinoma cell, bone marrow and melanocyte cDNA libraries. The tyrosine kinase homologous domains of TYRO3 and TYRO3P were sequenced and compared with each other and with the mouse TYRO3 gene. Abundant levels of the 4.2-kb TYRO3 mRNA were detected in human brain, and lower levels in other human tissues. TYRO3 and TYRO3P were both assigned to human chromosome 15q14-q25 by analysis of DNAs from somatic cell hybrids.
