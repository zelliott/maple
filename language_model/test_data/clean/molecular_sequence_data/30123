Aromatic proton and high field shifted methyl proton resonances of RNase T1 complexed with Guo, 2'GMP, 3'GMP, or 5'GMP were assigned to specific amino acid residues by analyses of the two-dimensional NMR spectra in comparison with the crystal structure of the RNase T1-2'GMP complex. These assignments were subsequently correlated to those of free RNase T1 [Hoffmann & RÃ¼terjans (1988) Eur. J. Biochem. 177, 539-560]. The spatial proximities of amino acid residues as elucidated by NOESY spectra were found to be quite similar among free RNase T1 and the inhibitor complexes, showing that large conformational changes did not occur upon complex formation. However, small but appreciable conformational changes were induced, which were reflected by the systematic chemical shift changes of some amino acid residues in the active site. Furthermore, we confirmed that RNase T1 contains two specific binding sites, one for the guanine base and the other for the phosphate moiety. The inhibitors are forced to adapt their conformations to fit the guanine base and the phosphate moiety to each binding site on the enzyme. This is consistent with our previous studies that 2'GMP and 3'GMP take the syn form as a bound conformation, while 5'GMP takes the anti conformation around glycosidic bonds [Inagaki et al. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 1013-1020]. The slow-exchange process between free and bound forms involving Tyr42 and Tyr45 was found to be specific to the recognition of the guanine base.
