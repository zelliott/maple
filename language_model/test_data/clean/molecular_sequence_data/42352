A dually HIV- and HTLV-infected ARC patient was found by serological studies in South India. These viruses were isolated and molecular study showed that the patient had both HIV-1 and HTLV-I but not HIV-2 and HTLV-II. In addition to this, 9 other dually infected persons which include another full-blown AIDS case have been identified as on July 1993 in South India. Our findings provide an opportunity to clarify geographical distribution of these human retroviruses.
