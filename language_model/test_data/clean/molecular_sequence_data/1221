The Thai isolates of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) were obtained from the Chulalongkorn University-Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (CU-VDL). Virus isolation was confirmed by immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) using SDOW-17. The virus genotype was determined using nested multiplex RT-PCR (nm RT-PCR) of ORF 1b. The nm RT-PCR was able to detect at least 10TCID50/ml of PRRSV. Of 137 Thai isolates, 66.42% belonged to the European (EU) genotype and 33.58% to the North American (US) genotype. ORF5 products of the eight US strains (00CS1, 01NP1, 01UD6, 02CB13, 02KK1, 02PB1, 02SP2 and 02SP3) and the six EU strains (01CB1, 01RB1, 02BR1, 02CB12, 02SB2 and 03RB1) were sequenced for genetic variation analysis. The US strains of the Thai isolates are clustered within the same group and are more closely related to the IAF-EXP91 from Canada (89-90% nucleotide identity), whereas the EU strains were very similar to the EU prototype, Lelystad virus (87-97.5% nucleotide identity). The ORF5 nucleotide identities within the US genotype tested in this study compared to the US prototype, VR-2332 varied from 83.7 to 85.2%, whereas 83.5-85.5% amino acid identities were found. Based on the phylogenetic tree, each pair of the Thai isolates (01NP1 and 02KK1, 00CS1 and 01UD6, and 01CB1 and 01RB1) was identical despite they were collected from different provinces. Therefore, there was no geographic influence on the spreading of PRRSV in Thailand. Interestingly, 02CB12 (EU genotype) shared over 99% similarity of the ORF5 nucleotide sequence and 98.6% of amino acid identity with the European vaccine, Porcillis (AF378819). However, modified live virus vaccines for PRRSV have not yet been used in the swine population in Thailand. The results suggested that both US and EU genotypes exist in Thailand, genetic variation does occur in both genotypes, and the sources of the viruses appear to be from Canada and Northern Europe, respectively. In addition, the spreading of PRRSV in Thailand might be due to introducing infected replacement pigs or infected semen into the farm.
