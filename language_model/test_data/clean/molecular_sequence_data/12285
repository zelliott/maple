Since plant-pathogenic fungi must penetrate through pectinaceous layers of the host cell wall, pectin-degrading enzymes are thought to be important for pathogenesis. Antibodies prepared against a pectin-inducible pectate lyase (pectate lyase A [PLA]) produced by a phytopathogenic fungus, Fusarium solani f. sp. pisi (Nectria haematococca, mating type VI), was previously found to protect the host from infection. The gene (pelA) and its cDNA were cloned and sequenced. Here we report the isolation of a new pectate lyase gene, pelB, from a genomic library of F. solani f. sp. pisi with the pelA cDNA as the probe. A 2.6-kb DNA fragment containing pelB and its flanking regions was sequenced. The coding region of pelB was amplified by reverse transcription-mediated PCR, using total RNA isolated from F. solani pisi culture grown in the presence of glucose as the sole carbon source. The predicted open reading frame of pelB would encode a 25.6-kDa protein of 244 amino acids which has 65% amino acid sequence identity with PLA from F. solani f. sp. pisi but no significant homology with other pectinolytic enzymes. The first 16 amino acid residues at the N terminus appeared to be a signal peptide. The pelB cDNA was expressed in Pichia pastoris, yielding a pectate lyase B (PLB) which was found to be a glycoprotein of 29 kDa. PLB was purified to homogeneity by using a two-step procedure involving ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by Superdex G75 gel filtration chromatography. Purified PLB showed optimal lyase activity at pH 10.0. A rapid drop in the viscosity of the substrate and Mono Q anion-exchange chromatography of the products generated by the lyase showed that PLB cleaved polygalacturonate chains in an endo fashion. Western blotting (immunoblotting) with antibodies raised against PLA showed that PLB and PLA are immunologically related to each other. The 5' flanking regions of both pelA and pelB were translationally fused to the beta-glucuronidase gene and introduced into F. solani f. sp. pisi, and beta-glucuronidase activities of the transformants were measured. Expression of the marker gene by the transformants showed that pelA expression is induced by pectin and repressed by glucose, whereas expression of pelB is constitutive and is not subject to glucose repression. Reverse transcription-mediated PCR showed that both pelA and pelB are expressed when F. solani f. sp. pisi infects pea epicotyl.
