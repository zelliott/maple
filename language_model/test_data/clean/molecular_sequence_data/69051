Colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) is required for the growth and differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes, and is also involved in modulating various activities in mature cells. We report herein that T-cell lines produce 4.6 and 1.5 kb mRNA species of CSF-1, and express the CSF-1 protein on their outer membranes, as determined by immunofluorescence staining with anti-CSF-1 antibodies. The CSF-1 protein is biologically active. Interested by the possible immunoregulatory function of CSF-1, we assessed its effect in an assay of antigen presentation to the T cell lines. We found that anti-CSF-1 antibodies inhibited T-cell stimulation. Moreover, soluble CSF-1 could not overcome this inhibition, but exerted a significant inhibitory activity on the interaction between T cells and antigen-presenting cells leading to T-cell activation and proliferation in vitro. Based on these observations we propose that T-cell CSF-1 may be involved in the interaction of these cells with CSF-1 receptor bearing antigen-presenting cells.
