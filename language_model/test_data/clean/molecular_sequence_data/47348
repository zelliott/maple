Using primers from a conserved region of the XA34 human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) family, four pol fragments originating from new members of the family were amplified from human genomic DNA. Southern blot analysis demonstrated similar hybridization patterns in human, chimpanzee and orangutan and distinct hybridization to macaque DNA. The probes also exhibited weaker hybridization to squirrel monkey DNA. Using large genomic clones, two full-length XA34-related HERVs have been identified. One of the HERVs is located downstream of a human Kr√ºppel-related zinc finger protein gene, ZNF195. Both of the newly identified long terminal repeats have potential TATA boxes, poly(A) signals and transcription factor-binding sites but they differ to a high degree, especially in the U3 region. The primer-binding sites were found to be homologous to tRNA(Phe) (TTC), and therefore these new HERVs have been given the name HERV-F. The closest relatives to the HERV-Fs are the RTVLH-RGH family. Phylogenetic analyses of the Gag, Pol and Env regions are discussed. Both of the newly identified HERV-Fs were shown to contain protease, reverse transcriptase, integrase and env regions and had characteristic deletions in the integrase and env regions. In addition, the capsid protein gene of gag and two conserved zinc-binding motifs that are characteristic of a potential nucleic acid-binding protein were also identified. Apart from an ORF spanning the protease of one HERV-F, no other longer ORFs were found.
