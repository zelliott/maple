We have assembled a molecular toolkit enabling the facile generation of C-terminal fluorescent protein fusion constructs for the construction of transgenic Drosophila lines in the form of a series of modified vectors for P-element transformation. These vectors contain one of a variety of fluorescent tags including GFP, mCherry, Venus, Cerulean, photoactivatable paGFP and the red-to-green photoconvertible protein Dendra and provide a range of options with respect to transcriptional regulation. The vectors have been extensively tested in vivo and can produce fluorescent chimeric proteins that are functional.
