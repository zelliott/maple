During fermentation, yeast cells are exposed to increasing amounts of alcohol, which is stressful and affects both growth and viability. On the molecular level, numerous aspects of alcohol stress signaling remain unresolved. We have identified a novel yeast Ring/PHD finger protein that constitutively shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm but accumulates in the nucleus upon exposure to ethanol, 2-propanol, or 1-butanol. Subcellular localization of this protein is not altered by osmotic, oxidative, or heat stress or during nitrogen or glucose starvation. Because of its exclusive sensitivity to environmental alcohol, the protein was called Asr1p for Alcohol Sensitive Ring/PHD finger 1 protein. Nuclear accumulation of Asr1p is rapid, reversible, and requires a functional Ran/Gsp1p gradient. Asr1p contains two N terminally located leucine-rich nuclear export sequences (NES) required for nuclear export. Consistently, it accumulates in the nucleus of xpo1-1 cells at restrictive temperature and forms a trimeric complex with the exportin Xpo1p and Ran-GTP. Deletion of ASR1 leads to sensitivity in growth on medium containing alcohol or detergent, consistent with a function of Asr1p in alcohol-related signaling. Asr1p is the first reported protein that changes its subcellular localization specifically upon exposure to alcohol and therefore represents a key element in the analysis of alcohol-responsive signaling.
