Trichoderma reesei is an important industrial fungus known for its ability to efficiently secrete large quantities of protein as well as its wide variety of biomass degrading enzymes. Past research on this fungus has primarily focused on extending its protein production capabilities, leaving the structure of its 33 Mb genome essentially a mystery. To begin to address these deficiencies and further our knowledge of T. reesei's secretion and cellulolytic potential, we have created a genomic framework for this fungus. We constructed a BAC library containing 9216 clones with an average insert size of 125 kb which provides a coverage of 28 genome equivalents. BAC ends were sequenced and annotated using publicly available software which identified a number of genes not seen in previously sequenced EST datasets. Little evidence was found for repetitive sequence in T. reesei with the exception of several copies of an element with similarity to the Podospora anserina transposon, PAT. Hybridization of 34 genes involved in biomass degradation revealed five groups of co-located genes in the genome. BAC clones were fingerprinted and analyzed using fingerprinted contigs (FPC) software resulting in 334 contigs covering 28 megabases of the genome. The assembly of these FPC contigs was verified by congruence with hybridization results.
