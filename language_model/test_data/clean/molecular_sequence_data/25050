The use of DNA-based vaccines is a novel and promising immunization approach for the development of flavivirus vaccines. This approach has been attempted in vaccine development for various virus species, including St. Louis encephalitis, Russian spring-summer encephalitis, Central European encephalitis, dengue serotypes 1 and 2, Murray Valley encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile viruses. However, very little is known about the factors affecting its efficacy. Recently, we demonstrated that a single intramuscular immunization of DNA vaccine of Japanese encephalitis and West Nile viruses protected mice and horses from virus challenge. Administration of these recombinant plasmid vectors resulted in endogenous expression and secretion of extracellular virus-like particles that correlated well with the induction of protective immunity. These results provided evidence that the virus-like particles composed of premembrane/membrane and envelope proteins are essential for eliciting immune responses similar to those induced by live, attenuated virus vaccines. The biosynthesis and protein processing of premembrane/membrane and envelope proteins that preserve the native conformation and glycosylation profiles identical to virion proteins could be determined by the effectiveness of the transmembrane signal sequence located at the amino-terminus of premembrane protein. The use of DNA vaccines in multivalent and/or combination vaccines designed to immunize against multiple flaviviruses is also a promising area of development.
