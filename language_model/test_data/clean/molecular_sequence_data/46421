Mitochondria are central to iron homeostasis. However, various proteins involved in iron metabolism inside the mitochondria are still to be identified. Herein we report that nuclear coded mitochondrial protein prohibitin binds to iron and involved in intracellular iron homeostasis. Like other iron regulated proteins, prohibitin mRNA contains functional iron-response element and is regulated by intracellular iron levels. Tyrosine residues involved in iron binding attribute of prohibitin are identified using site-directed mutagenesis. These data together suggest that prohibitin functions as an intracellular iron binding protein and plays a role in intracellular iron homeostasis.
