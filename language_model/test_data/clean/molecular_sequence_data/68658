A high affinity radioligand for bradykinin B2 receptors was prepared by coupling an activated ester of [125I]4-iodobenzoic acid to the amino terminus nitrogen of the potent B2 antagonist HOE 140. The ligand, [125I]para-iodophenyl HOE 140 ([125I]PIP HOE 140), bound to a homogeneous set of sites in guinea pig ileal membranes with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 15 pM and a maximal binding density of 193 fmole/mg protein. Competition studies with a number of BK-related peptides indicated that the ligand specifically labeled B2 receptors in the preparation. The results suggest that [125I]PIP HOE 140 will be a useful tool for future studies of B2 receptors.
