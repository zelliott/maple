Aspergillus fumigatus, a ubiquitous fungus, is implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of clinically different allergic diseases in man, including allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Peptide-based immunotherapy may offer an alternative treatment strategy for the management of allergic disease. The objective of this study was to alter the allergen-specific immune response using dominant T cell epitopes of a major A. fumigatus allergen, Asp f2, expressed in yeast as virus-like particles (VLP). The T cell epitopes of Asp f2, recognized in mice with an H-2d background, were determined by producing T-cell hybridomas. Two dominant T cell epitopes, aa60--71 and aa235--249, were identified and expressed in a yeast VLP system. To induce tolerance VLP-peptides were injected subcutaneously into mice previously immunized with recombinant Asp f2. The T cell immune response was abrogated totally in 3 weeks following a single injection of VLP but was restored 2 months later following intranasal antigen exposure. T-cell depletion resulted in the reduction of 20-30% of all antigen-specific immunoglobulin classes. Thus, recombinant peptides expressed in the VLP system can be used successfully in the modulation of Asp f2-induced immune response in mice, although a single administration is not sufficient to maintain a state of tolerance for a long period of time.
