A 16S rRNA gene-based culture-independent approach was used to study the bacterial and archaeal communities in a sulfide-rich wastewater. Propidium Monoazide (PMA) treatment was applied to limit the analysis to the fraction of viable cells in environment. A total of 104 and 68 clones respective from bacterial clone library and archaeal library were picked and analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). 35 RFLP patterns from bacterial clone library and 10 RFLP patterns from archaeal clone library were unique and the respective clones were selected for sequencing. BLAST analysis and RFLP analysis showed that the bacterial clone library mainly consisted of Gammaproteobacteria (73%), Anaerolineae (6%), Bacilli (5%), Deltaproteobacteria (7%), Clostridia (4%), Bacteroidetes (1%), and Chlorobia (1%); Methanomicrobia (99%) and Thermococci (1%) were the only two lineages of the archaeal domains. This study gave a first insight into the overall microbial structure in a cloth printing and dyeing wastewater treatment plant with high concentration of sulfide and increased knowledge on the applicability of the PMA treatment in combination with PCR-based molecular techniques to analyze only viable cells in microbial ecology.
