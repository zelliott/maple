The carbohydrate moieties of glycoproteins in plasma membrane are known to correlate with the induction of cell differentiation in some kinds of cells. We investigated the asparagine-linked sugar chains of neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma cell membranes. The acidic oligosaccharides were bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary complex-type sugar chains with Man alpha-->(Man alpha)Man beta-->GlcNAc beta-->(+/- Fuc alpha-->)GlcNAc as their cores. A comparative study of the oligosaccharides of these cells showed that the biantennary complex-type sugar chain with bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residues increased and high-molecular-weight oligosaccharides decreased in ganglioneuroma cells. It is suspected that asparagine-linked sugar chains correlate with the differentiation stage of neuroblastoma.
