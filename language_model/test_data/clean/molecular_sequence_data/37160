SER virus is closely related to the paramyxovirus simian virus 5 (SV5) but is defective in syncytium formation. The SER virus F protein has a long cytoplasmic tail (CT) domain that has been shown to inhibit membrane fusion, and this inhibitory effect could be eliminated by truncation of the C-terminal sequence (S. Tong, M. Li, A. Vincent, R. W. Compans, E. Fritsch, R. Beier, C. Klenk, M. Ohuchi, and H.-D. Klenk, Virology 301:322-333, 2002). To study the sequence requirements for regulation of fusion, codons for SER virus F protein residues spanning amino acids 535 to 542 and 548 were mutated singly to alanines, and the two leucine residues at positions 539 and 548 were mutated doubly to alanines. We found that leu-539 and leu-548 in the CT domain played a critical role in the inhibition of fusion, as mutation of the two leucines singly to alanines partially rescued fusion, and the double mutation L539, 548A completely rescued syncytium formation. Mutation of charged residues to alanines had little effect on the suppression of fusion activity, whereas the mutation of serine residues to alanines enhanced fusion activity significantly. The L539, 548A mutant also showed extensive syncytium formation when expressed without the SER virus HN protein. By constructing a chimeric SV5-SER virus F CT protein, we also found that the inhibitory effect of the long CT of the SER virus F protein could be partially transferred to the SV5 F protein. These results demonstrate that an elongated CT of a paramyxovirus F protein interferes with membrane fusion in a sequence-dependent manner.
