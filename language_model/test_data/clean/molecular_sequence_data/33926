The complete genome of Mycoplasma hyorhinis strain MCLD has been sequenced and annotated. This genome differs by the inversion of a 14.4-kb and a 3.7-kb fragment and the deletion of a 9.9-kb fragment from M. hyorhinis strain HUB-1, isolated from swine respiratory tract. The genome revealed 778 coding sequences (CDSs), with a limited number of vlp genes encoding variable surface lipoproteins.
