Whilst the amyloid-β (Aβ) hypothesis/centric theory continues to evolve, genetic, biochemical and pathological evidence still suggests that Aβ is central to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, Aβ-oligomers/soluble Aβ, may be an earlier determinant of Alzheimer's disease and better correlative of cognitive impairment. Whilst there are a number of Aβ-oligomeric species in existence (making therapeutic and diagnostic biomarker choice cumbersome), their existence is in equilibrium with Aβ-fibrils, the main constituent of cored plaques. Although Alzheimer's disease remains incurable, improvements to Aβ immunotherapies and strategies to target Aβ continue to evolve, with the reliance upon Aβ imaging to shed light on the outcome of therapeutics proving very useful.
