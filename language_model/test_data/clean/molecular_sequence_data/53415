The C-terminal domain of the alpha subunit of the RNA polymerase (alphaCTD) from Escherichia coli (Ec) regulates transcription by interacting with many kinds of proteins and promoter upstream (UP) elements consisting of AT-rich sequences. However, it is unclear how this system is common in all eubacteria. We investigate the structure and properties of alphaCTD from an extremely thermophilic eubacterium, Thermus thermophilus (Tt). The solution structure of Tt alphaCTD (85 amino acids) was determined by NMR, and the interaction between Tt alphaCTD and DNA with different sequences was investigated by means of chemical shift perturbation experiments. The tertiary structure of Tt alphaCTD is almost identical with that of Ec alphaCTD despite 32% sequence homology. However, Tt alphaCTD interacts with the upstream region sequence of the promoter in the Tt 16 S ribosomal protein operon rather than the Ec UP element DNA. The upstream region sequence of Tt is composed of 25 base pairs with 40% AT, unlike the Ec UP element with 80% AT. The DNA binding site in Tt alphaCTD is located on the surface composed of helix 4 and the loop preceding helix 4. The electric charges on this surface are not remarkably localized like those of Ec alphaCTD.
