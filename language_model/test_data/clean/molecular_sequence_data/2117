An RNA molecule, 340 nucleotides in length and designated H1 RNA, copurifies with RNase P activity from extracts of HeLa cells or isolated HeLa cell nuclei. When the genomic DNA of various organisms is probed with H1 cDNA in Southern hybridization assays, only mammalian DNA gives a positive signal. The gene coding for H1 RNA in human cells is present in one to three copies per cell. The nucleotide sequence of H1 RNA, which shows little homology to the known sequences of its analogs from prokaryotes and yeast, can be drawn as a two-dimensional, hydrogen-bonded structure that resembles similar structures proposed for the RNA subunit of RNase P from these other sources. Part of the hypothetical structure is virtually identical to structures that can be drawn for analogous RNAs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and S. octosporus.
