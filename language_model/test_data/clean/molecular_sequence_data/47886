The nucleotide sequence of a 2.8 kb fragment containing the ADE2 gene of the osmotolerant yeast Zygosaccharomyces rouxii has been determined. The gene was cloned from a Z. rouxii genomic DNA library by complementation of the Saccharomyces cerevisae ade2 mutant strain. The sequenced DNA fragment contains a 1710 bp open reading frame predicting a protein of 570 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence shares a high degree of homology with Ade2p homologues in five other yeast species.
