The Drosophila fat facets (faf) gene is a ubiquitin-specific protease necessary for the normal development of the eye and of the syncytial stage embryo in the fly. Using a gene trap approach in embryonic stem cells we have isolated a murine gene with extensive sequence similarity to the Drosophila faf gene and called it Fam (fat facets in mouse). The putative mouse protein shows colinearity and a high degree of sequence identity to the Drosophila protein over almost its entire length of 2554 amino acids. The two enzymatic sites characteristic of ubiquitin-specific proteases are very highly conserved between mice and Drosophila and this conservation extends to yeast. Fam is expressed in a complex pattern during postimplantation development. In situ hybridisation detected Fam transcripts in the rapidly expanding cell populations of gastrulating and neurulating embryos, in post-mitotic cells of the CNS as well as in the apoptotic regions between the digits, indicating that it is not associated with a single developmental or cellular event. The strong sequence similarity to faf and the developmentally regulated expression pattern suggest that Fam and the ubiquitin pathway may play a role in determining cell fate in mammals, as has been established for Drosophila.
