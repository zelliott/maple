Mouse mast cell protease (mMCP) 1, mMCP-2, mMCP-4, and mMCP-5 are members of a family of related serine proteases whose genes reside within an approximately 850 kilobase (kb) complex on chromosome 14 that does not readily undergo crossover events. While mapping the mMCP-1 gene, we isolated a novel gene that encodes a homologous serine protease designated mMCP-9. The mMCP-9 and mMCP-1 genes are only approximately 7 kb apart on the chromosome and are oriented back to back. The proximity of the mMCP-1 and mMCP-9 genes now suggests that the low recombination frequency of the complex is due to the closeness of some of its genes. The mMCP-9 transcript and protein were observed in the jejunal submucosa of Trichinella spiralis-infected BALB/c mice. However, in normal BALB/c mice, mMCP-9 transcript and protein were found only in those mast cells that reside in the uterus. Thus, the expression of mMCP-9 differs from that of all other chymases. The observation that BALB/c mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells developed with interleukin (IL) 10 and c-kit ligand contain mMCP-9 transcript, whereas those developed with IL-3 do not, indicates that the expression of this particular chymase is regulated by the cytokine microenvironment. Comparative protein structure modeling revealed that mMCP-9 is the only known granule protease with three positively charged regions on its surface. This property may allow mMCP-9 to form multimeric complexes with serglycin proteoglycans and other negatively charged proteins inside the granule. Although mMCP-9 exhibits a >50% overall amino acid sequence identity with its homologous chymases, it has a unique substrate-binding cleft. This finding suggests that each member of the chromosome 14 family of serine proteases evolved to degrade a distinct group of proteins.
