A novel multienzyme complex, E1C, and a free endoglucanase, E2 (GH5), from Fusarium verticillioides were purified. The E1C contained two endoglucanases (GH6 and GH10), one cellobiohydrolase (GH7) and one xylanase (GH10). Maximum activity was observed at 80 °C for both enzymes and they were thermostable at 50 and 60 °C. The activation energies for E1C and E2 were 21.3 and 27.5 kJ/mol, respectively. The KM for E1C was 10.25 g/L while for E2 was 6.58 g/L. Both E1C and E2 were activated by Mn(2+) and CoCl2 while they were inhibited by SDS, CuSO4, FeCl3, AgNO4, ZnSO4 and HgCl2. E1C and E2 presented endo-β-1,3-1,4-glucanase activity. E1C presented crescent activity towards cellopentaose, cellotetraose and cellotriose. E2 hydrolyzed the substrates cellopentaose, cellotetraose and cellotriose with the same efficiency. E1C showed a higher stability and a better hydrolysis performance than E2, suggesting advantages resulting from the physical interaction between proteins.
