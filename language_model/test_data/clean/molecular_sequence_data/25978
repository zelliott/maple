Three analogues of the tridecapeptide amide H-Leu-(Glu)5-Ala-Tyr-Gly-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2 were synthetized with alpha-deuterated glutamate residues in specific positions in order to assign unambiguously the 1H nmr spectrum of the parent peptide in water and in water-trifluoroethanol mixtures. The synthetic route is described and the assignment illustrated. A previous, tentative assignment based solely on indirect evidence [Mammi, S., Mammi, N. J. & Peggion, E. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 1374-1379] was partially modified.
