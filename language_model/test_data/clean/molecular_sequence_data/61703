Rhodococcus opacus HL PM-1 utilizes 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (picric acid) as a sole nitrogen source. The initial attack on picric acid occurs through two hydrogenation reactions. Hydride transferase II (encoded by npdI) and hydride transferase I (encoded by npdC) are responsible for the hydride transfers. Database searches with the npd genes have indicated the presence of a putative transcriptional regulator, npdR. Here, the npdR gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the protein was purified and shown to form a complex with intergenic regions between open reading frames A and B and between npdH and npdI within the npd gene cluster. A change in DNA-NpdR complex formation occurred in the presence of 2,4-dinitrophenol, picric acid, 2-chloro-4,6-dinitrophenol, and 2-methyl-4,6-dinitrophenol. By constructing a promoter-probe vector, we demonstrated that both intergenic regions caused the expression of reporter gene xylE. Hence, both of these regions contain promoters. A deletion mutant of R. opacus HL PM-1 was constructed in which part of npdR was deleted. The expression of npdI and npdC was induced by 2,4-dinitrophenol in the wild-type strain, while in the mutant these genes were constitutively expressed. Hence, NpdR is a repressor involved in picric acid degradation.
