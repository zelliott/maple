The complete nucleotide sequences of the recA genes from Escherichia coli B/r, Shigella flexneri, Erwinia carotovora and Proteus vulgaris were determined. The DNA sequence of the coding region of the E. coli B/r gene contained a single nucleotide change compared with the E. coli K12 gene sequence whereas the S. flexneri gene differed at 7 residues. In both cases, the predicted proteins were identical in primary structure to the E. coli K12 RecA protein. The DNA sequences of the recA genes from E. carotovora and P. vulgaris were 80% and 74% homologous, respectively, to the E. coli K12 gene. The predicted amino acid sequences of the E. carotovora and P. vulgaris RecA proteins were 91% and 85% identical respectively, to that of E. coli K12. The RecA proteins from both P. vulgaris and E. carotovora diverged significantly in sequence in the last 50 residues whereas they showed striking conservation throughout the first 300 amino acids which include an ATP-binding region and a subunit interaction domain. A putative LexA repressor binding site was localized upstream of each of the heterologous genes.
