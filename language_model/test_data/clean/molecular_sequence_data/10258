Certain peptides derived from the alpha1 domain of the major histocompatibility class I antigen complex (MHC-I) inhibit receptor internalization, increasing the steady-state number of active receptors on the cell surface and thereby enhancing the sensitivity to hormones and other agonists. These peptides self-assemble, and they also bind to MHC-I at the same site from which they are derived, suggesting that they could bind to receptor sites with significant sequence similarity. Receptors affected by MHC-I peptides do, indeed, have such sequence similarity, as illustrated here by insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor. A synthetic peptide with sequence identical to a certain extracellular receptor domain binds to that receptor in a ligand-dependent manner and inhibits receptor internalization. Moreover, each such peptide is selective for its cognate receptor. An antibody to the IR peptide not only binds to IR and competes with the peptide but also inhibits insulin-dependent internalization of IR. These observations, and binding studies with deletion mutants of IR, indicate that the sequence QILKELEESSF encoded by exon 10 plays a key role in IR internalization. Our results illustrate a principle for identifying receptor-specific sites of importance for receptor internalization, and for enhancing sensitivity to hormones and other agonists.
