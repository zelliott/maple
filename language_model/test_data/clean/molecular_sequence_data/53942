A useful strategy directed to the isolation of a required gene with a high GC content is reported. Using a degenerate oligonucleotide probe, deduced from the amino terminus of a protein, it is possible to obtain a fragment of DNA containing its encoding gene by PCR amplification. Furthermore, the cloning of a desired gene can be accomplished in two steps by using an oligonucleotide deduced (i) from an internal sequence, (ii) from a consensus sequence, or (iii) from a DNA sequence adjacent to a disrupting element (transposon, insertion sequence, cassette). This method, which could be applied to a bacteriophage, plasmid, or cosmid genomic library, has been successfully used for cloning several genes from different biological systems.
