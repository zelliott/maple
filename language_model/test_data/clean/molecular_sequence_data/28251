The hammerhead structural model proposed for sequences that mediate self-cleavage of certain RNAs contains base-paired three stems and 13 conserved bases. Insertion, deletion and base substitution mutations were carried out on a 58 base RNA containing the sequence of the single-hammerhead structure of the plus RNA of the virusoid of lucerne transient streak virus, and the effects on self-cleavage assessed. Results showed that there is flexibility in the sequence requirements for self-cleavage in vitro, but alterations of the conserved sequence or predicted secondary structure generally reduced the efficiency of self-cleavage.
