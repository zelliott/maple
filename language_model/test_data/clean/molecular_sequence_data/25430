Chicken liver multicatalytic proteinase is composed of multiple components with molecular masses ranging from 23 to 34 kDa and has 'chymotrypsin-like' and 'trypsin-like' activities, which were examined by using the chromogenic peptide substrates, succinyl-Phe-Leu-Phe-pNA(p-nitroanilide) and N-benzoyl-Phe-Val-Arg-pNA, respectively. Treatment of the enzyme with diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) completely abolished the 'chymotrypsin-like' activity, but had little effect on the 'trypsin-like' activity. In the experiment with radio-labeled DFP, SDS-PAGE of the modified enzyme revealed that the radioactivity was incorporated into only the smallest subunit (23 kDa). The migration of this subunit was retarded on SDS-PAGE after the treatment with DFP.
