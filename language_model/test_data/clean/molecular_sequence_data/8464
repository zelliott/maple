A 8.2 kb DNA segment from the left arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome XIV (GenBank/EMBL accession number: X83226) encompasses four open reading frames (ORFs) longer than 100 residues. The ORF N0295 is highly similar to the Aspergillus parasiticus and Schizosaccharomyces pombe nmt1 gene products, which are involved in thiamine biosynthesis and are strongly repressed by thiamine. N0300 is 76% identical to YCR107w, a hypothetical protein of yeast chromosome III, and 55% identical to a ligninolytic aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase from the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium. In addition, this fragment encodes Rpd3, a pleiotropic transcription factor (Vidal and Gaber, 1991), and part of Pas8, a protein essential for the biogenesis of peroxisomes (Voorn-Brouwer et al., 1993).
