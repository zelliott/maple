An aerobic, Gram-negative, non-motile, yellow-to-orange pigmented and rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain SM1(T), was isolated from seawater in Thailand and subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the novel isolate shared 93-95 % sequence similarity with species of the genus Myroides. The DNA-DNA relatedness values of strain SM1(T) with Myroides odoratimimus JCM 7460(T) and Myroides odoratus JCM 7458(T) were below 70 %. The DNA G+C content of strain SM1(T) was 33.6 mol%, the major menaquinone was MK-6 and the major fatty acids were C(15 : 0) iso, C(17 : 1)omega9c iso and C(17 : 0) iso 3-OH. Based on its phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, strain SM1(T) was classified as representing a novel species of the genus Myroides, for which the name Myroides pelagicus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SM1(T) (=IAM 15337(T)=KCTC 12661(T)).
