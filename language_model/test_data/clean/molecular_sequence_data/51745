The Caenorhabditis elegans and Artemia T4 globin sequences are highly homologous with other invertebrate globins. The intron/exon patterns of their genes display a single intron in the E and G helices respectively. Precoding introns in multirepeat globins are inserted in homologous positions. Comparison of the intron/exon patterns in the known globin gene sequences demonstrates that they are more diverse than first expected but nevertheless can be derived from an ancestral pattern having 3 introns and 4 exons.
