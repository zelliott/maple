Components of the translational machinery of the cell, including ribosomal proteins, are generally considered to be clear examples of housekeeping genes with a spatially ubiquitous distribution of messenger RNA during embryonic development. Here we present data based upon in situ hybridization experiments as well as RNase protection assays, demonstrating that Xenopus ribosomal protein gene S1 is differentially expressed in a complex and spatially distinct pattern during embryogenesis. We observed dramatically high levels of expression in some tissues, such as the branchial arches, otic vesicles, optic vesicles and somites and virtually no expression in other tissues, such as the cement gland, epidermis and notochord. Moreover, ribosomal protein genes S22, L1, and L5 display expression patterns nearly identical to S1. Our data is consistent with a model of ribosomal gene expression according to which ribosomal protein genes (or perhaps a subset of ribosomal protein genes) may be expressed at low levels in all tissues, but are abundantly expressed in other cell types reflecting a dynamic and complex pattern of transcriptional control throughout embryonic development.
