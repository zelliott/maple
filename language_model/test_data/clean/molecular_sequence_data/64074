Purpureotin, a novel di-dimeric C-type lectin-like protein (CLP) from Trimeresurus purpureomaculatus, was purified and sequenced. While its native molecular mass was determined to be 63kDa, purpureotin showed a single band of 30kDa on nonreducing SDS-PAGE and two polypeptide chains (16.0 and 14.5kDa) under reducing condition. These results were subsequently confirmed by mass spectrometric analyses. Based on these results, we postulate that purpureotin is a dimer of the alpha,beta-heterodimer which is held together by noncovalent interactions. Molecular modeling studies indicate that a dimer of alpha,beta-heterodimers can be formed where the alpha chains are held together by electrostatic charges and beta chains via hydrophobic interactions. Functionally, purpureotin induced platelet aggregation without any cofactor in a dose-dependent manner. However, the platelet aggregation effect was blocked by echicetin. Therefore, purpureotin is assumed to be a GPIb-binding protein which binds to the same or a closely related GPIb site on platelets as echicetin.
