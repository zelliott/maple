Pepscan hexapeptides prepared to the capsid protein amino acid sequence of potato leafroll luteovirus (PLRV) were tested against both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Twelve continuous epitopes were identified: 11 were detected by two different PLRV polyclonal antisera, but only 4 were detected by both antisera. The 12th epitope reacted with monoclonal antibody BG3. The location of most of the epitopes did not correlate well with antigenic areas predicted by computer algorithms. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of PLRV and southern bean mosaic virus capsid proteins allowed a preliminary assignment of epitopes 4-12 to different regions of the putative S domain of the PLRV subunit. Five out of 14 monoclonal antibodies and both of the polyclonal antisera reacted with epitope 1 at the N-terminus. ELISA data indicated that even though the N-terminus is hydrophobic, it is exposed at the surface of the particles.
