Promoter and silencer elements of the immediate 5' flanking region of the gene coding for human factor VII were identified and characterized. The major transcription start site, designated as +1, was determined by RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) analysis of human liver cDNA and was found to be located 50 bp upstream from the translation start site. Two minor transcription start sites were found at bp +32 bp and +37. Progressive deletions of the 5' flanking region were fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene and transient expression in HepG2 and HeLa cells was measured. Two promoter elements that were essential for hepatocyte-specific transcription were identified. The first site, FVIIP1, located at bp -19 to +1, functioned independently of orientation or position and contributed about one-third of the promoter activity of the factor VII gene. Electrophoretic mobility-shift, competition, and anti-hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) antibody supershift experiments demonstrated that this site contained an HNF-4 binding element homologous to the promoters in the genes coding for factor IX and factor X. The second site, FVIIP2, located at bp -50 to -26, also functioned independent of orientation or position and contributed about two thirds of the promoter activity in the gene for factor VII. Functional assays with mutant sequences demonstrated that a 10-bp G + C-rich core sequence which shares 90% sequence identity with the prothrombin gene enhancer was essential for the function of the second site. Mobility-shift and competition assays suggested that this site also binds hepatic-specific factors as well as the transcription factor Sp1. Two silencer elements located upstream of the promoter region spanning bp -130 to -103 (FVIIS1 site) and bp -202 to -130 (FVIIS2) were also identified by reporter gene assays.
