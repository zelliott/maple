The (betaalpha)(8)-barrel enzymes N'-[(5'-phosphoribosyl)formimino]-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide isomerase (tHisA) and imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase (tHisF) from Thermotoga maritima catalyze two successive reactions in the biosynthesis of histidine. In both enzymes, aspartate residues at the C-terminal end of beta-strand 1 (Asp8 in tHisA and Asp11 in tHisF) and beta-strand 5 (Asp127 in tHisA and Asp130 in tHisF) are essential for catalytic activity. It was demonstrated earlier that in tHisA the substitution of Asp127 by valine (tHisA-D127V) generates phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase (TrpF) activity, a related (betaalpha)(8)-barrel enzyme participating in tryptophan biosynthesis. It is shown here that in tHisF the corresponding substitution of Asp130 by valine (tHisF-D130V) also generates TrpF activity. To determine the effectiveness of individual amino acid exchanges in these conversions, each of the 20 standard amino acid residues was introduced at position 127 of tHisA and 130 of tHisF by saturation random mutagenesis. The tHisA-D127X and tHisF-D130X variants with TrpF activity were identified by selection in vivo, and the proteins purified and characterized. The results obtained show that removal of the negatively charged carboxylate side-chain at the C-terminal end of beta-strand 5 is sufficient to establish TrpF activity in tHisA and tHisF, presumably because it allows the binding of the negatively charged TrpF substrate, phosphoribosylanthranilate. In contrast, the double mutants tHisA-D8N+D127V and tHisF-D11N+D130V did not show detectable activity, demonstrating that the aspartate residues at the C-terminal end of beta-strand 1 are essential for catalysis of the TrpF reaction. The ease with which TrpF activity can be established on both the tHisA and tHisF scaffolds supports the evolutionary relationship of these three enzymes and highlights the functional plasticity of the (betaalpha)(8)-barrel enzyme fold.
