Osteopontin (OPN) is one of the major secretory phosphoproteins in both calcifying and non-calcifying tissues. Evidence has accumulated for the biological importance of the phosphoproteins and, in particular, the phosphate groups in bone formation, resorption, and calcification. The precise locations of the phosphate groups in the OPN molecule were determined by metabolically labeling OPN with 32P in cultured chicken osteoblasts, followed by purification to homogeneity. N-terminal sequencing showed a single sequence of WPVSKRQHAISA, consistent with that deduced from both cDNA, and previous amino acid sequencing of the protein isolated from chicken bone. Three 32P-labeled peptides were isolated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography of thrombin-digested, 32P-labeled OPN. The N-terminal sequencing of each of these thrombin fragments gave single sequences as follows: WPVSKSRQHAIS, SHHTHRYHQDHVD, and ASKLRKAARKL, with approximate molecular masses of 5, 30, and 20 kDa. These data demonstrate that 32P was incorporated throughout the N- to C-terminal sequence of the protein. Thrombin specifically cleaved chicken OPN at two sites: between Arg-22 and Ser-23, which generated the 5-kDa N-terminal end fragment, and another between Lys-138 and Ala-139, which generated the 30- and 20-kDa fragments. To further define the exact locations of the phosphorylated amino acids and the surrounding amino acid sequences, OPN was digested with trypsin, which generated seven major 32P-labeled peptides whose amino acid sequences were determined. The phosphorylated peptide regions of osteopontin were identified as amino acids 8-18 (QHAIS*AS*S*EEK), 39-54 (LASQQTHYS*S*EENAD), 150-171 (LIEDDAT*AEVGDSQLAGLWLPK), 179-191 (ELAQHQSVENDSR), 194-205 (FDS*PEVGGDSK), 214-219 (ES*LASR), and 239-248 (HSIENNEVTR). The phosphorylated amino acid sites are followed by an asterisk (*). Of the seven identified phosphorylated peptide regions, three were localized on the N-terminal end of the osteopontin molecule (with five phosphorylated serines) and contained the sequence motifs that were phosphorylated by casein kinase II type(s), whereas the remaining four peptides are concentrated toward the C-terminal half of the molecule (with five phosphorylated residues) and contained recognition motifs for other kinases as well as casein kinase II.
