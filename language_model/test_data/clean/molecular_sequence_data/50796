We have previously reported the cloning of cDNAs for a flavin-containing mono-oxygenase (FMO) of man, designated FMO1 [Dolphin, Shephard, Povey, Palmer, Ziegler, Ayesh, Smith & Phillips (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 12379-12385], that is the orthologue of pig and rabbit hepatic FMOs. We now describe the isolation and characterization of cDNA clones for a second human FMO, which we have designated FMO2. The polypeptide encoded by the cDNAs is 558 amino acid residues long, has a calculated M(r) of 63337, and contains putative FAD- and NADP-binding sites that align exactly with those described in other mammalian FMOs. Human FMO2 has 51-53% primary sequence identity with human FMO1, rabbit pulmonary FMO and rabbit liver FMO form 2, and thus represents a fourth, distinct, member of the mammalian FMO family. The corresponding mRNA is present in low abundance in adult human liver. Southern blot hybridization with single-exon probes demonstrated that human FMO2 and FMO1 are the products of single genes. The gene encoding FMO2 (designated FMO2) was mapped, by the polymerase chain reaction, to human chromosome 1, the same chromosome on which FMO1 is located.
