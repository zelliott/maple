Methylotrophic bacteria are widespread microbes which can use one carbon compound as their only carbon and energy sources. Here we report the finished, annotated genome sequence of the methylotrophic bacterium Methylovorus sp. strain MP688, which was isolated from soil for high-level production of pyrroloquinolone quinone (PQQ) in our lab.
