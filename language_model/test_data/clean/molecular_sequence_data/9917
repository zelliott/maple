The multicopy plasmid pFM366 was isolated from a virulent Salmonella enteritidis strain and was found to code for DNA methylase activity (Ibáñez and Rotger, 1993). The present work was aimed at characterizing the genetic organization and functional features of this 5.6 kb plasmid. We found pFM366 almost identical to the plasmid P4 isolated from Shigella sonnei, that encodes the SsoII restriction-modification system (Karyagina et al., 1993), and related to other ColE1-type plasmids. Examination of these plasmids revealed a common organization which suggests they were the result of similar recombinational events. The cytosine methylase of pFM366 is nearly identical to M. SsoII, whereas the gene encoding the restrictase homologous to R. SsoII is truncated and its product is inactive. The expression of the cytosine methylase encoded by pFM366 is strongly affected by deletion of regions located upstream and downstream of its ORF, and is negatively controlled by the rpoS gene in Escherichia coli. The methylase activity encoded by pFM366 induces the SOS response, which could be responsible for the observed delay in the growth of E. coli.
