A full length cDNA for acid phosphatase in rat liver lysosomes was isolated and sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequence comprises 423 residues (48,332 Da). A putative signal peptide of 30 residues is followed by the NH2-terminal sequence of lysosomal acid phosphatase (45,096 Da). The deduced NH2-terminal 18-residue sequence is identical with that determined directly for acid phosphatases purified from the rat liver lysosomal membranes. The primary structure deduced for acid phosphatase contains 9 potential N-glycosylation sites and a hydrophobic region which could function as a transmembrane domain. It exhibits 89% and 67% sequence similarities in amino acids and nucleic acids, respectively, to human lysosomal acid phosphatase. The amino acid sequence of the putative transmembrane segment shows a complete similarity to that of the human enzyme. Northern blot hybridization analysis identified a single species of acid phosphatase mRNA (2.2 kbp in length) in rat liver.
