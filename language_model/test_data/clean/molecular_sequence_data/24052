Bacterial virulence often depends on exported proteins. To identify genes encoding exported proteins in the neonatal pathogen, group B streptococcus, the transposon TnphoZ was constructed. Here, the coding sequence for the secretion-dependent enzyme alkaline phosphatase from Enterococcus faecalis was fused to the left terminal repeat of Tn917, generating TnphoZ. A collection of TnphoZ mutants was isolated and the DNA flanking the transposon insertion sites was sequenced. Sequence data correlated the expression of high AP activity with transposon insertion into genes encoding predicted exported proteins. It is anticipated that TnphoZ will be suitable for use in other Gram-positive hosts.
