Using as examples non-canonical features of translation initiation for some bacterial and mammalian mRNAs with unusual 5'- untranslated regions (5'-UTR) or lacking these regions (leaderless mRNAs), the authors of this review discuss similarities in mechanisms of translation initiation on prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes.
