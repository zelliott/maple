Lysinibacillus is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, and round-spore-forming bacterial genus of the family Bacillaceae. We analyzed the genome sequence of Lysinibacillus boronitolerans F1182, isolated from a traditional Korean fermented soybean product. The genome sequence contained 4.46 Mbp with a G+C content of 37.5%. This is the first report of an L. boronitolerans genome.
