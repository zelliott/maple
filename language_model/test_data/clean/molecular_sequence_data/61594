Here we present the genomic sequence, with analysis, of a canarypox virus (CNPV). The 365-kbp CNPV genome contains 328 potential genes in a central region and in 6.5-kbp inverted terminal repeats. Comparison with the previously characterized fowlpox virus (FWPV) genome revealed avipoxvirus-specific genomic features, including large genomic rearrangements relative to other chordopoxviruses and novel cellular homologues and gene families. CNPV also contains many genomic differences with FWPV, including over 75 kbp of additional sequence, 39 genes lacking FWPV homologues, and an average of 47% amino acid divergence between homologues. Differences occur primarily in terminal and, notably, localized internal genomic regions and suggest significant genomic diversity among avipoxviruses. Divergent regions contain gene families, which overall comprise over 49% of the CNPV genome and include genes encoding 51 proteins containing ankyrin repeats, 26 N1R/p28-like proteins, and potential immunomodulatory proteins, including those similar to transforming growth factor beta and beta-nerve growth factor. CNPV genes lacking homologues in FWPV encode proteins similar to ubiquitin, interleukin-10-like proteins, tumor necrosis factor receptor, PIR1 RNA phosphatase, thioredoxin binding protein, MyD116 domain proteins, circovirus Rep proteins, and the nucleotide metabolism proteins thymidylate kinase and ribonucleotide reductase small subunit. These data reveal genomic differences likely affecting differences in avipoxvirus virulence and host range, and they will likely be useful for the design of improved vaccine vectors.
