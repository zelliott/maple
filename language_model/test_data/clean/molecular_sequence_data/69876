DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) is one of several syndromes associated with deletions within the proximal long-arm of chromosome 22. The region of chromosome 22q11 responsible for the haploinsufficiency syndromes (the DiGeorge Critical Region or DGCR) has been mapped using RFLPs, quantitative Southern blotting and FISH. Similar deletions are seen in the velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS) and familial congenital heart defects. It is not known whether the phenotypic spectrum is the result of the hemizygosity of one gene or whether it is a consequence of contiguous genes being deleted. However, the majority of patients have a large (> = 2Mb deletion). In this paper we report the isolation of a gene, lab name T10, encoding a serine/threonine rich protein of unknown function which maps to the commonly deleted region of chromosome 22q11. Studies in the mouse indicate that it maps to MMU16 and is expressed during early embryogenesis. Although not mapping within the shortest region of overlap for DGS/VCFS, and therefore not the major gene involved in DGS, the expression pattern suggests that this gene may be involved in modifying the haploinsufficient phenotype of hemizygous patients.
