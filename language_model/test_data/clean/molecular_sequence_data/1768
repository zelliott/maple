At the late endosomes, cargoes destined for the interior of the vacuole are sorted into invaginating vesicles of the multivesicular body. Both PtdIns(3,5)P(2) and ubiquitin are necessary for proper sorting of some of these cargoes. We show that Ent5p, a yeast protein of the epsin family homologous to Ent3p, localizes to endosomes and specifically binds to PtdIns(3,5)P(2) via its ENTH domain. In cells lacking Ent3p and Ent5p, ubiquitin-dependent sorting of biosynthetic and endocytic cargo into the multivesicular body is disrupted, whereas other trafficking routes to the vacuole are not affected. Ent3p and Ent5p are associated with Vps27p, a FYVE domain containing protein that interacts with ubiquitinated cargoes and is required for protein sorting into the multivesicular body. Therefore, Ent3p and Ent5p are the first proteins shown to be connectors between PtdIns(3,5)P(2)- and the Vps27p-ubiquitin-driven sorting machinery at the multivesicular body.
