Allelic data from a Greek sample of unrelated individuals for the D17S30, 3'ApoB, D1S80 and DXS52 loci were obtained by the PCR and subsequent analysis with agarose gel electrophoresis. The distribution of observed genotypes is in agreement with expected values according to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. An heterozygosity of at least 76% was demonstrated with 11-13 alleles for each locus. The use of the combination of the four loci could be a powerful tool for paternity testing and individual discrimination, in combination with the fact that PCR needs a minimal amount of DNA and is a very quick and sensitive method.
