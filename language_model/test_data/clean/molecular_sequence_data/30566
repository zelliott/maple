Cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane proteins play a critical role in cellular processes involving interactions between membrane and cytosolic components. Activation of the phagocytic cell respiratory burst oxidase, the electron transport chain responsible for superoxide anion (O2-.) production, requires membrane components including cytochrome b558 and several cytosolic proteins; but the biochemical interactions of these components are poorly understood. Cytochrome b558 is an electron transport component of the oxidase. A role for cytochrome b558 in the organization or integration of other oxidase components has also been hypothesized. Antibodies binding the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal tail of the transmembrane 91-kDa subunit of cytochrome b558 specifically inhibited an amphiphile-activated cell-free O2-.-generating system that requires neutrophil membranes and cytosol. Synthetic peptides encompassing a 7-amino acid carboxyl-terminal sequence (RGVHFIF) within the same region of the 91-kDa subunit blocked activation of the oxidase by arachidonate, but did not affect activity of the assembled oxidase when added after arachidonate to the cell-free O2-.-generating system. The same peptides inhibited activation of the respiratory burst when allowed to diffuse into electrically permeabilized neutrophils before stimulation with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine or phorbol myristate acetate. These studies define a functional cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane 91-kDa subunit of cytochrome b558 which may mediate interactions with other cellular proteins essential to activation of the phagocyte respiratory burst.
