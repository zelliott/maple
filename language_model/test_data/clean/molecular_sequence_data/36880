We probed the complex between oriC and DnaA protein using two types of mutants in oriC. Base changes in the DnaA binding sites, DnaA boxes, had little effect on origin function. Mutations which change the distance between DnaA boxes R3 and R4, on the other hand, inactivated oriC unless the mutation deleted or inserted one complete helical turn. Origins with other 10 base pair insertions in the interval between DnaA boxes R2 and R3 were functional, but not insertions in the R1-R2 interval. FIS protein binds to a bipartite site in oriC between DnaA boxes R2 and R3. A model for the oriC/DnaA complex based on these results suggests an array of DnaA monomers with a 34 A spacing upon which oriC is arranged.
