The avian retrovirus FH3, which encodes a Gag-Myc fusion protein, transforms chicken macrophages but not fibroblasts. However, passage of FH3 viral stock in fibroblasts leads to emergence of a virus capable of fibroblast transformation. This virus has not acquired myc mutations; instead, it carries internal gag deletions which confer the ability to transform fibroblasts. We now demonstrate that this and similar deletion variants emerge repeatedly during selection. Sequence analysis reveals direct repeats at or near deletion junctions, suggesting that errors during reverse transcription may be involved in genesis of these viruses, which are then positively selected in fibroblast culture. By using the polymerase chain reaction, we found that such variants preexisted in original stocks even before selection, although they could not be detected by focus assay.
