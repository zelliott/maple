To investigate the functions of U6 and 7SK of Bama mini-pig and produce Bama mini-pig with silenced GGTA1 gene, the siRNA promoters U6 and 7SK were cloned, ligated into pMD18-shEGFP, and co-transfected with PEGFP- N1 into PK-15 kidney cells of pigs to be used in RNAi experiments. The functions of the two promoters in pig cells were verified using pMD18-hU6-shEGFP as the positive control, pMD18-shEGFP vector without promoter as the negative control, PEGFP-N1 as the first blank control, ddH2O in replacement of the plasmid as the second blank control. The results showed that the lengths of U6 and 7SK in Bama mini-pig were 553 bp and 437 bp, respectively. Vectors pMD18-pU6- shEGFP and pMD18-p7SK-shEGFP were constructed and transfected into PK-15 cells from pigs. Promoters pU6 and p7SK proved to express high levels of siRNA activity and can be used in the experiment of silencing Î±-1,3galactosyltransferase gene.
