This work reports the cloning and sequence determination of the horse alpha subunit of the integrin CD11c/CD18, a marker of dendritic cells. A cDNA clone of 4582 base pairs was obtained. It encodes a protein segment of 1086 amino acid residues of the extracellular domain with 10 potential sites of glycosylation, a transmembrane domain of 32 residues and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of 24 residues. A phylogenetic analysis of this integrin shows close similarity (83%) with that of Canis familiaris.
