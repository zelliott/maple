Histone acetylation modifiers have been described to participate as cofactors in mammalian transcriptional complexes involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation. The acetylation of core histone proteins is reversible and regulated by two competing enzymatic activities, histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Increasing evidence suggests a connection between histone acetylation and the development of cancer and leukemia. We have recently mapped HDAC3 to mouse chromosome 18B3, a region which is syntenic with human chromosome 5q31, where HDAC3 is imbedded in a group of potential tumor suppressor genes and which has been reported to be the smallest commonly deleted segment in malignant myeloid disease. We report herein the identification and characterization of HDAC3, a yeast RPD3 ortholog in the mouse. Studies on murine HDAC3 may yield important insights on the understanding of myeloproliferative disease in humans.
