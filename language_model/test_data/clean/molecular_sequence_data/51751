Prothymosin alpha (ProT alpha) is a 12.5 kDa acidic polypeptide that is considered to have a nuclear function related to cell proliferation. Inspection of its amino acid sequence revealed the presence of sequences that may serve as targets for phosphorylation by casein kinase-2 (CK-2). ProT alpha isolated from calf thymocytes was phosphorylated in vitro by CK-2. The phosphorylation sites are Ser and Thr residues located among the first 14 amino acid residues in the ProT alpha sequence. Another site that is theoretically suitable for phosphorylation by CK-2, at the C-terminus of the polypeptide, is not, in fact, phosphorylated. Thymosin alpha 1 (T alpha 1), a peptide whose sequence corresponds to the first 28 amino acids of ProT alpha, is also phosphorylated by CK-2 at the same phosphorylation sites as ProT alpha. In cultured splenic lymphocytes ProT alpha was phosphorylated at Thr residues located at positions 7, 12 and/or 13. Based on these observations we conclude that CK-2, or another cellular kinase with similar sequence specificity, is responsible for phosphorylation of ProT alpha in vivo.
