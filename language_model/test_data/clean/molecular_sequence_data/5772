We have isolated three rice cDNA sequences coding for divergent isotypes of alpha-tubulin. TubA1 and TubA2 are members of the plant subfamily I of alpha-tubulins whereas TubA3 belongs to subfamily II. The pattern of accumulation of TubA3 mRNA in rice flowers, roots and coleoptile segments treated with auxin differs significantly from what observed for TubA1 and TubA2 mRNAs.
