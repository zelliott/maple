A composite 1876-bp DNA encoding a putative protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) has been constructed from clones isolated from Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) genomic and cDNA libraries and the nucleotide sequence determined. As predicted from the open reading frame (ORF), the protein product has a predicted molecular size of 54 kDa and a high degree of homology to PDIs from other species.
