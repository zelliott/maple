Conformations of parallel deoxyoligonucleotides 5'd(CTATAGGGAT)3'/5'd(GATATCCCTA)3' and 5'd(TGATTGATCGATTGTTTGCATGCACACGTTTTTGTGAGCG)3'/'5'd (ACTAACTAGCTAACAAACGTACGTGTGCAAAAACACTCGC)3' were studied in solution by CD method. A cooperative change in the CD spectra is observed in trifluoroethanol (TFE) solutions at decreased water activity (relative humidity). This distinctive change is supposed to stem from a cooperative conformational transition of parallel double helix from a B-like form with C2'endo sugar conformation to a A-like form designated as Ap. The free energy difference between Ap- and B-like conformations of the parallel decaduplex is close to that for antiparallel decaduplex with the nucleotide sequence studied. A-phility of a parallel helix is dependent on its sequence.
