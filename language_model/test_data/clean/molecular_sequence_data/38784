p34cdc2 kinase-phosphorylation sites in the microtubule (MT)-binding region of MAP4 were determined by peptide sequence of phosphorylated MTB3, a fragment containing the carboxy-terminal half of human MAP4. In addition to two phosphopeptides containing Ser696 and Ser787 which were previously indicated to be in vivo phosphorylation sites, two novel phosphopeptides, containing Thr892 or Thr901 and Thr917 as possible phosphorylation sites, were isolated, though only in in vitro phosphorylation. The role of phosphorylation at Ser696 and Ser787, which were differently phosphorylated during the cell cycle (Ookata et al., (1997). Biochemistry, 36: 15873-15883), was investigated in MT-polymerization, using MAP4 Ser to Glu mutants, which mimic phosphorylation at each site. Mutation of Ser787 to Glu strikingly reduced the MAP4's MT-polymerization activity, while Glu-mutation at Ser696 did not. These results suggest that Ser787 could be the critical phosphorylation site causing MTs to be dynamic at mitosis.
