Six novel tetronic acid analogs were isolated from the fermentation broth of the actinomycete Saccharothrix aerocolongenes subsp. antibiotica SCC1886. The structures of these saccharocarcins were determined by their spectral data, and chemical degradation. All six compounds are derived from two modified tetronic acid homologs which differ from other tetronic acids by having an ethyl or propyl side chain at C-23 and a methyl group at C-16. They are all characterized by a novel sugar-amide at C-17.
