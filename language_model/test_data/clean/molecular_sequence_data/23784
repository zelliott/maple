In order to evaluate the physiological roles of the testicular endothelin (Edn) signaling via Edn receptor subtype-A (Ednra) in mammals, the localization of Ednra was investigated by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in the testis of rats, dogs, and monkeys. For in situ hybridization, a rat Ednra RNA probe which is highly homologous to the subcloned canine and monkey Ednra (88.7% and 87.9% identical, respectively) was used. Both Ednra mRNA and protein were detected in interstitial cells and cells in the basal compartment of the seminiferous tubules, mainly Sertoli cells, as well as spermatogonia and some early spermatocytes, but not spermatids. The localization pattern of Ednra was exhibited in a same manner among species, indicating that the physiological role of Edn signaling throughout Ednra was maintained in the mammalian testis.
