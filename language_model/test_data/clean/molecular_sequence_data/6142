Recently human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) has been shown to be responsible for a kind of uveitis in southwestern Japan, where HTLV-I infection is highly endemic. To investigate further the association of HTLV-I with various ocular diseases, we studied HTLV-I seroprevalence in 1,350 patients in central Japan, where HTLV-I infection is not endemic. Of 1,350 patients with various ocular diseases, 40 (2.96%) were seropositive for the retrovirus. There was no statistically significant difference in HTLV-I seroprevalence among various ocular diseases. Four of 9 (44.4%) seropositive cases from southwestern Japan developed HTLV-I associated uveitis (HAU), whereas only 2 of 26 (7.7%) seropositive cases from central Japan developed HAU. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). This suggests that the incidence of HAU could be influenced by environmental or hereditary factors. On the other hand, 3 of 7 (42.9%) patients with episcleritis showed HTLV-I infection.
