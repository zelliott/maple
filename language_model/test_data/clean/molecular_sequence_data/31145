A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on the use of multiple primers enabling the simultaneous detection of HPV-6b, -11, -16 and -18 in a single tube reaction was developed and validated on cervico-vaginal specimens, including tissues embedded in paraffin. This PCR setting proved to be specific and sensitive, allowing the detection of as few as 200 viral particles per specimen.
