This study was undertaken to estimate the relative frequencies of 13 microsatellite motifs in the rice genome as a basis for efficient development of a microsatellite map. Two dinucleotide, seven trinucleotide, and four tetranucleotide repeat motifs were end labelled and used as hybridization probes to screen genomic and cDNA libraries of rice, cv. IR36. Optimal washing temperatures for identification of clones containing specific microsatellite motifs were estimated based on washing temperatures near Td (dissociation temperature; Td = Tm - 7.6 degrees C). Sequencing of 20 putatively positive clones corresponding to each of 4 microsatellite motifs suggested that while Td provides a useful predictor of washing stringency for most of the repeats studied, those with a very high GC or AT content were most prone to error. The results from screening the rice genomic library suggest that there are an estimated 1360 poly(GA)n and 1230 poly(GT)n microsatellites in the rice genome, and that the relative frequency of different repeats decreased with increasing size of the motif. The most frequently observed microsatellites in the cDNA library were the same as for genomic library, but no poly(CGG)n, poly(ATC)n, or tetranucleotide motifs were observed among cDNA in this study.
