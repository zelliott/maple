A conserved Aeromonas salmonicida gene (abcA) affecting expression of the surface array protein gene (vapA) in Escherichia coli was identified. The 924-bp gene starts 205 bp after vapA and codes for a protein with a deduced molecular weight (M(r)) of 34,015 containing an N-terminal P-loop and significant homology to the ATP-binding cassette transport protein superfamily. AbcA was identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) by using T7 polymerase expression and DNA-directed translation and was copurified with the sarkosyl-soluble cytoplasmic membrane fraction. The protein displayed aberrant migration during SDS-PAGE. A lacZ fusion containing 128 bp of upstream sequence and 387 bases in the 5' end of abcA was constructed, and the beta-galactosidase activity of the abcA-lacZ fusion gene was shown to be similar in E. coli and A. salmonicida. The 130,000-M(r) AbcA-LacZ fusion protein was purified, and by using an ATP affinity column, the 129 AbcA N-terminal P-loop-containing residues were shown to bind ATP.
