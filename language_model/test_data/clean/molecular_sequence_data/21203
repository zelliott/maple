Phage metagenomes isolated from wastewater over a 12-month period were analyzed. The results suggested that various strains of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and other phyla are likely to participate in transduction. The patterns of 16S rRNA sequences found in phage metagenomes did not follow changes in the total bacterial community.
