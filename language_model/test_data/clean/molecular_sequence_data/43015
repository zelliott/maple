We have developed a one-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique which detects a sequence on the human Y chromosome and an autosomal sequence in one reaction. The method is very reliable for the sex determination, as the detection of the autosome-specific signal ensures the presence of DNA in the specimen even in the absence of the Y-specific signal.
