K+ plays an important role for the function of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase (SERCA), but its binding site within the molecule has remained unidentified. We have located the binding site for a K+ ion in the P-domain by means of x-ray crystallography using crystals prepared in the presence of the K+ congener Rb+. Backbone carbonyls from the loop containing residues 711-715 together with the side chain of Glu732 define the K+/Rb+ site in the Ca2+ -ATPase conformation with bound Ca2+, ADP, and AlF4-. Functional analysis of Ca2+ -ATPase mutants with alterations to Glu732 shows that this site is indeed important for the stimulatory effect of K+ on the dephosphorylation rate. Comparison with the Ca2+ -ATPase in a dephosphorylated E2 conformation suggests that the K+ site is involved in the correct movement and positioning of the A-domain during translocation and dephosphorylation.
