The bacterial cloning vector, pGreenscript A, derived from the mutated Aequorea green fluorescent protein (GFP-S65A) gene, when expressed in E. coli produced colonies that showed yellow color under daylight and strong green fluorescence under long-wave ultraviolet light. The vector was used to select for inserted foreign genes based on the loss of the yellow color/green fluorescence of E. coli cells caused by the insertional inactivation of GFP production.
