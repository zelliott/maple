The sequence of the VH gene of a monoclonal anti-biotin antibody was determined. Biotin-binding motifs, similar to those in avidin and streptavidin, were identified in complementary determining regions 2 and 3, suggesting that natural selection of functional motifs may occur in unrelated protein types.
