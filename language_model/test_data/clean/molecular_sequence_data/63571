Gene inactivation and complementation experiments showed that the tripartite AheABC efflux pump of Aeromonas hydrophila extruded at least 13 substrates, including nine antibiotics. The use of phenylalanine-arginine-beta-naphthylamide (PAbetaN) revealed an additional system(s) contributing to intrinsic resistance. This is the first analysis of the role of multidrug efflux systems in Aeromonas spp.
