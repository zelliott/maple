In order to design plasminogen activators with improved thrombolytic properties, bifunctional proteins with both plasminogen-activating and anticoagulative activity were constructed by fusing a thrombin-inhibitory moiety itself comprises four elements: linker 1, a motif directed to thrombin's active site, linker 2 and a fragment of hirudin which binds to the fibrinogen-recognition site of thrombin. In order to improve further the anticoagulative activity, the thrombin-inhibitory domain was modified by substituting linker 2. Introduction of a linker (FLLRNP) from the human thrombin receptor conferred about a 10-fold increase in anticoagulative activity in protein M37 compared with the parent molecule M23 carrying an aliphatic linker. The increase in anticoagulative activity was also reflected in the shift of the Ki value from 159 +/- 20 nM for M23 to 2.0 +/- 0.5 nM for M37. The increased thrombin-inhibitory activity of M37 may be due to the presence of an arginine in the linker from the thrombin receptor which may interact with one of two glutamic acid residues located at the exit of the thrombin substrate binding pocket. This explanation is supported by the observation that another chimera (M35) carrying a linker sequence with two acidic residues has relatively weak thrombin-inhibitory activity. The thrombin-inhibitory activity of M37 may be strong enough to substitute anticoagulative co-medication during fibrinolytic treatment.
