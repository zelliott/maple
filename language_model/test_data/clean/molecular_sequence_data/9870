Hematopoietic prostaglandin (PG) D synthase is the key enzyme for production of the D and J series of prostanoids in the immune system and mast cells. We isolated a cDNA for the rat enzyme, crystallized the recombinant enzyme, and determined the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme complexed with glutathione at 2.3 A resolution. The enzyme is the first member of the sigma class glutathione S-transferase (GST) from vertebrates and possesses a prominent cleft as the active site, which is never seen among other members of the GST family. The unique 3-D architecture of the cleft leads to the putative substrate binding mode and its catalytic mechanism, responsible for the specific isomerization from PGH2 to PGD2.
