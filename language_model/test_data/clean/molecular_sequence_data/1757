The human cytomegalovirus UL37 gene encodes at least three isoforms, which share N-terminal UL37 exon 1 (UL37x1) sequences. UL37 proteins traffic dually into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and to mitochondria. Trafficking of the UL37 glycoprotein (gpUL37) in relation to its post-translational processing was investigated. gpUL37 is internally cleaved in the ER and its products traffic differentially. Its C-terminal fragment (UL37(COOH)) is ER-localized and N-glycosylated. Unlike conventional ER signal sequences, its N-terminal fragment is stable and traffics to mitochondria. Inhibition of N-glycosylation did not block pUL37 cleavage and dramatically decreased the levels of but not of UL37(COOH). pUL37(M), which differs from gpUL37 by the lack of residues 178-262 and hence the UL37x3 consensus signal peptidase cleavage site, traffics into the ER and mitochondria, but is neither cleaved nor N-glycosylated. This finding of a relationship between ER processing and mitochondrial importation of UL37 proteins is unique for herpesvirus proteins.
