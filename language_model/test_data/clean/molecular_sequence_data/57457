The promoter region of a soybean auxin-responsive gene, GmAux28, was analyzed to identify protein-binding DNA sequences that may be involved in regulation of expression. Using DNase I footprinting and gel mobility shift assays, multiple regions of interaction, including eight major protein-binding sites, were observed in the GmAux28 gene. Two sequence motifs, TGACGACA and TCCACGTGTC, related to as-1/Hex and G-box elements, respectively, found in several plant promoters, were identified. Four distinct A/T-rich domains were identified; such A/T-rich domains appear to modulate, but not to specify, the expression of many genes. Two new sequence motifs, delta-1 (D1) and delta-4 (D4) were also identified. D1 and D4 share a very similar core sequence, TAGTxxCTGT and TAGTxCTGT, respectively. In gel mobility shift analyses, D1 and D4 elements exhibit a complex interaction of binding proteins. The GmAux22 promoter also contains D1-related elements which compete with the GmAux28 elements. Sequence comparisons have identified D1/D4-like sequences in several other auxin-responsive genes suggesting the possible importance of D1/D4 and the respective binding proteins in the regulation of expression of these genes.
