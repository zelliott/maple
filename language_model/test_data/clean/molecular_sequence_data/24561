The regulatory region of the gene for sigma32, rpoH, of Escherichia coli strains isolated from non-human hosts and different geographic regions, was sequenced and compared with that of E. coli K12. The main nucleotide changes observed are localized to the right inverted octamer motif of the CytR box. The effect of these changes was evaluated using transcriptional fusions. The results presented could guide further studies on the transcription regulation of rpoH using E. coli K12 as a model.
