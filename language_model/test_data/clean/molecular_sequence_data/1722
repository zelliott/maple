Variation in the ovine DQA2 gene was investigated in approximately 2,000 sheep from six breeds. Fragments of DNA containing the ovine DQA2 exon 2 were amplified using PCR. Single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and DNA sequence analysis were employed to detect genetic variation. Twenty-three nucleic acid sequences, encoding 22 DQA2 amino acid sequences, were identified. This increases the number of alleles identified from 10 to 23. In some cases, three or four unique sequences were isolated from individual sheep, suggesting that these DQA2 sequences may represent two loci. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that 5 of these 23 sequences were more closely related to cattle DQA3 or DQA4 sequences than to other sheep DQA2 sequences. These sequences clustered together and were called DQA2-like to differentiate them from other DQA2 sequences. There was no evidence of DQA5-like sequences in sheep. Information theory-based analysis indicated that some of the DQA2-like sequences had low information content at splice sites, suggesting that these alleles may have low functional activity. Allelic lineages were observed not only at the DQA2 locus, but also at the DQA2-like locus, supporting the trans-species mode of evolution of MHC genes. Comparison of the allelic sequences suggests that polymorphism seems to have arisen largely by point mutation and gene conversion, and a recent gene conversion event seems to have occurred between the DQA2 and DQA2-like loci. The high level of sequence polymorphism detected and varied number of loci demonstrate the extensive diversity of the ovine DQA2 gene.
