Microbial xylanolytic enzymes have a promising biotechnological potential, and are extensively applied in industries. In this study, induction of xylanolytic activity was examined in Aspergillus phoenicis. Xylanase activity induced by xylan, xylose or beta-methylxyloside was predominantly extracellular (93-97%). Addition of 1% glucose to media supplemented with xylan or xylose repressed xylanase production. Glucose repression was alleviated by addition of cAMP or dibutyryl-cAMP. These physiological observations were supported by a Northern analysis using part of the xylanase gene ApXLN as a probe. Gene transcription was shown to be induced by xylan, xylose, and beta-methylxyloside, and was repressed by the addition of 1% glucose. Glucose repression was partially relieved by addition of cAMP or dibutyryl cAMP.
