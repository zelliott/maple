We have isolated and sequenced cDNA clones encoding for preprogastrin from a canine antral cDNA library. Comparison of this sequence with those of porcine, human, and rat gastrin reveals extensive (83%) homology in the gastrin coding region as well as short regions of conserved nucleotides in the noncoding regions. The canine sequence encodes a preprogastrin of 104 amino acids which consists of a signal peptide, a 37-amino acid prosegment, and a 34-amino acid gastrin sequence, followed by a glycine (the amide donor), and flanked by pairs of arginine residues.
