Legumain (asparaginyl endopeptidase) was purified to homogeneity from bovine kidneys. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was calculated to be 34000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of beta-mercaptoethanol. The enzyme rapidly hydrolyzed the substrate Z-Ala-Ala-Asn-MCA and was strongly inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzene-sulfonic acid, Hg(2+) and Cu(2+). The amino acid sequence of the first 26 residues of the enzyme was Gly-Gly-Lys-His-Trp-Val-Val-Ile-Val-Ala-Gly-Ser-Asn-Gly-Gln-Tyr-Asn-Tyr-Arg-His-Gln-Ala-Phe-Ala-Asp-His-. This sequence is highly homologous to the sequences in the N-terminal of pig kidney legumain. We screened a bovine kidney cortex cDNA library using a DNA probe that originated from rat legumain, and we determined the bovine kidney cDNA structure and deduced the amino acid sequence. The cDNA is composed 1934 bp and encodes 433 amino acids in the coding region. The enzyme was strongly stained in the proximal tubules of the rat kidney in an immunohistochemical study. Vitamin D-binding protein which is known to be a ligand to megalin existing in the proximal tubules, was cleaved in a limited proteolytic manner by bovine kidney legumain. These results suggested that legumain contributes to the processing of macromolecules absorbed by proximal tubule cells. The enzyme also cleaved an N-terminal synthetic peptide of bovine annexin II (Gly(24)-Ser-Val-Lys-Ala-Tyr-Thr(30)-Asn-Phe-Asp-Ala-Glu(35)-Arg-Asp(37)) at a position between Asn(31) and Phe(32). The amino-terminal domain of annexin II has p11 subunit binding sites and phosphorylation sites for both pp60(src) and protein kinase C. This suggests that legumain plays an important role in inactivation and degradation of annexin II, which is abundant in the receptor-recycling compartments of endosomes/lysosomes.
