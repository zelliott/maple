The 5'-terminal region of the mink S26 ribosomal protein cDNA was cloned using polymerase chain reaction. The nucleotide sequences of the 5'-UTR (24 bp) and a 120-bp fragment of the coding region of RPS26 mRNA were determined. The homology between the coding regions of the human and mink RPS26 mRNAs proved to be 90.8%. The nucleotide sequences of the 5'-UTRs of mink, human, and rat RPS26 mRNAs, as well as mRNAs of the Drosophila S31 protein and Neurospora crp-5 protein, which are homologous to mammalian RPS26, were compared. A highly conserved 9-bp sequence located immediately upstream of the AUG codon was revealed in the 5'-UTR of the RPS26 mRNAs from different species.
