Serotonin N-acetyltransferase (arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase, AANAT, EC 2.3.1.87) is the first enzyme in the conversion of serotonin to melatonin. Large changes in AANAT activity play an important role in the daily rhythms in melatonin production. Although a single AANAT gene has been found in mammals and the chicken, we have now identified two AANAT genes in fish. These genes are designated AANAT-1 and AANAT-2; all known AANATs belong to the AANAT-1 subfamily. Pike AANAT-1 is nearly exclusively expressed in the retina and AANAT-2 in the pineal gland. The abundance of each mRNA changes on a circadian basis, with retinal AANAT-1 mRNA peaking in late afternoon and pineal AANAT-2 mRNA peaking 6 h later. The pike AANAT-1 and AANAT-2 enzymes (66% identical amino acids) exhibit marked differences in their affinity for serotonin, relative affinity for indoleethylamines versus phenylethylamines and temperature-activity relationships. Two AANAT genes also exist in another fish, the trout. The evolution of two AANATs may represent a strategy to optimally meet tissue-related requirements for synthesis of melatonin: pineal melatonin serves an endocrine role and retinal melatonin plays a paracrine role.
