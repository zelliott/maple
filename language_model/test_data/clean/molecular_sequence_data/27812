Translational frameshifts, both +1 and -1, are promoted by mutations in tufA and tufB, the two genes encoding the polypeptide chain elongation factor (EF) Tu of Escherichia coli. Strains harboring the mutant EF-Tu(Ala375----Thr) encoded by either tufA or tufB or by both, display a linear relationship between the frequency of frameshifting and the concentration of mutant EF-Tu, relative to the total amount of EF-Tu. A second mutant species, EF-TuB(Gly222----Asp), also promotes frameshifting. The frequency is strikingly enhanced by the combined action of EF-TuA(Ala375----Thr) and EF-TuB(Gly222----Asp) and exceeds by far the total contribution of the two mutant EF-Tus studied separately. These observations raise the question whether the formation of each peptide bond under conditions that no frameshifting occurs also requires the combined action of two EF-Tu molecules, in this case not differing functionally.
