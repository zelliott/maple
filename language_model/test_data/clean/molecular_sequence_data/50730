A method was developed to distinguish between genotypic variants B and C of bovine alpha s1-casein, using the allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (ASPCR). The alpha s1-casein genotype determined for 17 Jersey cows by the ASPCR method was confirmed by typing the alpha s1-casein milk proteins on isoelectric focusing gels. Using the ASPCR method described, rapid analysis of the alpha s1-casein genotype of bulls is now possible. In addition, kappa-casein genotypes can be determined from the same PCR reaction.
