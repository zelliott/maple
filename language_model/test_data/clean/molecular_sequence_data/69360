Clinical isolates of Mycobacterium spp. were identified by direct sequence determination of 16S rRNA gene fragments amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Identification was based on a hypervariable region within the 16S rRNA gene in which mycobacterial species are characterized by species-specific nucleotide sequences. A manually aligned data base including the signature sequences of 52 species of mycobacteria easily allowed rapid and correct identification. The results of this study demonstrate that polymerase chain reaction-mediated direct sequence determination can be used as a rapid and reliable method for the identification of mycobacteria in the clinical laboratory. In addition, the prompt recognition of previously undescribed species is now feasible.
