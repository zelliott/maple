A Gram-positive, spore-forming, aerobic actinomycete, strain Gsoil 519T, was isolated from soil of a ginseng field of Pocheon province in South Korea. The closest phylogenetic relatives were Streptomyces marinus Sp080513GE-26T (97.94 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Streptomyces albiaxialis NRRL B-24327T (97.84 %), Streptomyces albus subsp. albus DSM 40313T (97.84 %), Streptomyces almquistii NBRC 13015T (97.81 %), Streptomyces gibsonii NBRC 15415T (97.81 %), Streptomyces rangoonensis NBRC 13078T (97.81 %), Streptomyces sodiiphilus YIM 80305T (97.77 %) and Streptomyces flocculus NBRC 13041T (97.67 %). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 71.8 mol%. The chemotaxonomic data [MK-9(H6) and MK-9(H8) as the major menaquinones; ll-diaminopimelic acid as a component of the cell-wall peptidoglycan; ribose, xylose, mannose and glucose as the major cell-wall sugars; and anteiso-C15:0, iso-C15:0, iso-C17:0, anteiso-C17:0 and C16:0 as the major fatty acids] supported the affiliation of strain Gsoil 519T to the genus Streptomyces. The physiological and biochemical characteristics and the low level of DNA-DNA relatedness differentiated the isolate genotypically and phenotypically from recognized members of the genus Streptomyces. The isolate, therefore, represents a novel species, for which the name Streptomyces panacagri sp. nov. is proposed, with Gsoil 519T (=KCTC 19139T=DSM 41871T) as the type strain.
