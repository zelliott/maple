Trehalose is the main blood sugar of insects, and the enzyme trehalase is involved in energy metabolism and controlling trehalose levels in cells. Two forms (soluble and membrane-bound) of trehalase and the corresponding genes (NlTre-1 and NlTre-2) were identified from the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens. Both NlTre-1 and NlTre-2 contain trehalase signature motifs, and NlTre-2 contains a putative transmembrane domain. Comparison of trehalase activity and gene mRNA level at different developmental stages, or following application of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), suggests that NlTre-1 and NlTre-2 encode a soluble trehalase and a membrane-bound trehalase respectively. Soluble trehalase activity accounted for the majority of total trehalase activity in N. lugens. Only soluble trehalase activity and NlTre-1 mRNA level could be induced by 20E. Additionally, only soluble trehalase activity was significantly higher in macropterous individuals than in brachypterous morphs. These results indicate that only soluble trehalase is differentially expressed between macropterous and brachypterous individuals and is more responsive to hormone stimulus.
