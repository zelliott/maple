The human picornavirus coxsackievirus B2 (CVB2) is often linked to several infections, from mild respiratory diseases to more severe illnesses such as myocarditis. In this study, we report the complete genome sequence of CVB2 prototype strain Ohio-1. The genome sequence was determined from reverse transcribed viral RNA, amplified with long distance PCR and used for non-radioactive sequencing. The full length PCR amplicons were used for in vitro transcription and the obtained cRNA was lipofected onto green monkey kidney cells, in order to confirm that the PCR generated sequence reflects a viable virus RNA. The CVB2 genome sequence shows a typical enterovirus genome organization with a total length of 7411 nucleotides. Phylogenetic analysis, using the CVB2 polyprotein in comparison with other enterovirus polyproteins, clearly shows that CVB2 clusters with the coxsackievirus B-like enteroviruses and is more related to coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4) than any other published CVB serotype. The grouping of CVB2 and CVB4 as one subgroup has earlier been reported in connection with receptor usage and ability to replicate in different cell lines. The exposed viral capsid proteins of CVB2 (VP1-VP3) show high similarity to other CVB proteins, except in regions that are likely to be surface epitopes.
