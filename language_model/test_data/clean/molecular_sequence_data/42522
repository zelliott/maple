The gene encoding the major envelope glycoprotein of the HIV-SF2 isolate was engineered for the secretion of recombinant gp120 (rgp120SF2) from permanent Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. Cellular production methods were scaled up and a method for purification of the secreted glycoprotein was devised. Mild purification conditions were selected in order to preserve the native structure of the protein. rgp120SF2 exhibits a molecular weight of 120 kDa in reduced or nonreduced SDS gels; thus the polypeptide chain is intact. Deglycosylated rgp120SF2 has the predicted molecular weight of the polypeptide backbone, 54 kDa. Gel-filtration HPLC in a nondenaturing buffer at neutral pH yields a molecular weight estimate of approximately 120 kDa. Purified rgp120 closely resembles authentic viral gp120 by several physical, chemical, and immunochemical tests. rgp120SF2 reacts strongly with human HIV-positive sera, monoclonal antibodies reactive with HIV-SF2 and HIV-MN viral envelope, and a human virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibody that maps to a conserved discontinuous epitope on HIV-1 gp120. Purified rgp120SF2 forms a 1:1 molecular complex with soluble recombinant human CD4 (rCD4) receptor, as demonstrated by gel-filtration HPLC; binding is high affinity (Kd approximately 2 x 10(-9) M).
