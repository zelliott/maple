Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) induced by interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP) is a complex and multifaceted disease mediated by several different immunopathogenic processes. There is a temporal progression of the disease affecting the anterior and posterior segments of the eye, culminating with destruction of the photoreceptor cells. In the present study, we investigated the effects of IRBP peptide-induced EAU on different cell types within the retina. The Muller cells of the peripheral retina are damaged at the onset of EAU at day 9. There is induction of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the peripheral retinal Muller cells with concomitant reduction in the electroretinogram (ERG) b-wave. By day 12 of EAU, intensely GFAP-positive Muller cells are detected throughout the peripheral and central retina and with maximal diminution of the ERG b-wave. There is a lag in the diminution of the ERG a-wave, first detected at day 12 of EAU, and reaching its maximum at day 15. This change in the ERG is associated with destruction of the tips of the photoreceptor cells. These results indicate that during IRBP peptide-induced EAU, there is a positive correlation between the temporal changes in retinal histology, GFAP expression by Muller cells, and loss of retinal function.
