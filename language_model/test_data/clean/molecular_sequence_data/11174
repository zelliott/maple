The gene (ystB) encoding the novel subtype of the heat-stable enterotoxin (Y-STb) was cloned from the chromosome of a clinical isolate of Yersinia enterocolitica 84-50 (serotype O:5, biotype 1A) and the nucleotide sequence was determined. The ystB contained 216 base pairs that encoded a protein of 71 amino acid residues. The C-terminal 30 residues of the precursor protein exactly corresponded to the amino acid sequence of the Y-STb toxin, purified from the culture supernatant of the wild strain. Homology search revealed that there are 76.9% nucleotide sequence similarity between ystB and the Yersinia kristensenii ST gene, and 73.5% with the Y. enterocolitica prototype sequence of yst (ystA). When tested with the PCR generated ystB specific probe, 36 of 304 Y. enterocolitica strains from 18 countries hybridized with the probe. All the ystB probe positive strains belonged to biotype 1A and mostly to the so-called non-pathogenic serotype O:5, O:6, O:7,8 O:7,13 and O:10, while ystA was predominantly found among the pathogenic serotypes (78.5%). Out of 36 ystB gene positive strains, 18 were clinical origin from six countries, which were also positive in the suckling mice assay suggesting that ystB may play an important role in the pathogenesis, and the so-called non-pathogenic serotypes could be virulent for human.
