The coat protein (CP) gene of rice stripe virus was introduced into two japonica varieties of rice by electroporation of protoplasts. The resultant transgenic plants expressed the CP at high levels (up to 0.5% of total soluble protein) and exhibited a significant level of resistance to virus infection. Plants derived from selfed progeny of the primary transformants also expressed the CP and showed viral resistance, indicating stable transmission of the CP gene and the trait of resistance to the next generation. Moreover, the virally encoded strip disease-specific protein was not detected in transgenic plants expressing CP 8 weeks after inoculation, indicating protection before viral multiplication. These studies demonstrated that CP-mediated resistance to virus infection can be extended to cereals and to the viruses transmitted by an insect vector (planthopper).
