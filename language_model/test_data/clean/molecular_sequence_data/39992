Competence-stimulating peptide (CSP) and ComD of the streptococcal species are a pheromone and its receptor, respectively, involved in the regulation of competence for natural genetic transformation. We show here that these molecules have undergone positive selection. This study is the first report of positive selection due to competition among bacterial populations.
