A part of eukaryotic tRNA genes harbor an intron at one nucleotide 3' to the anticodon, so that removal of the intron is an essential processing step for tRNA maturation. While some tRNA introns have important roles in modification of certain nucleotides, essentiality of the tRNA intron in eukaryotes has not been tested extensively. This is partly because most of the eukaryotic genomes have multiple genes encoding an isoacceptor tRNA. Here, we examined whether the intron of tRNA-Trp(CCA) genes, six copies of which are scattered on the genome of yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is essential for growth or translation of the yeast in vivo. We devised a procedure to remove all of the tRNA introns from the yeast genome iteratively with marker cassettes containing both positive and negative markers. Using this procedure, we removed all the introns from the six tRNA-Trp(CCA) genes, and found that the intronless strain grew normally and expressed tRNA-Trp(CCA) in an amount similar to that of the wild-type genes. Neither incorporation of (35)S-labeled amino acids into a TCA-insoluble fraction nor the major protein pattern on SDS-PAGE/2D gel were affected by complete removal of the intron, while expression levels of some proteins were marginally affected. Therefore, the tRNA-Trp(CCA) intron is dispensable for growth and bulk translation of the yeast. This raises the possibility that some mechanism other than selective pressure from translational efficiency maintains the tRNA intron on the yeast genome.
