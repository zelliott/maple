The current AIDS pandemic represents the uneven spread of multiple genetically related subtypes (A to J) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Notably, HIV-1 E in southeast Asia and HIV-1 C in sub-Saharan Africa are expanding faster and are likely of greater global significance than the HIV-1 B subtype prevalent in the United States and Europe. While many studies have focused on genetic variation among structural genes, we chose to conduct a comparative analysis of the long terminal repeats of HIV-1 E and HIV-1 C isolates and report subtype-specific differences in enhancer copy numbers and sequences, as well as divergent activation in response to the cellular transcriptional activators Rel-p65 and NFATc and viral Tat. This study is the first to identify functional distinctions in promoter architecture between HIV-1 subtypes and raises the possibility that regulatory divergence among the subtypes of HIV-1 has occurred. Divergent transcriptional regulation may explain some of the epidemiologically observed differences in transmission and pathogenesis and underscores the need for further comparative analysis of HIV-1 regulation.
