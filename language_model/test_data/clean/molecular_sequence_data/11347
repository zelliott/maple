This first genomic Enhancer of split groucho (ESG) gene and its full length complementary DNA (cDNA) from nematode C. elegans were cloned and sequenced via homology with the corresponding Drosophila groucho cDNA. The cDNA of 2.1-Kb encodes a protein of 612 amino acids, and the nematode ESG protein is the smallest and most different in structure compared to all ESG related proteins. The gene isolated is 4,246-bp in size, including 1,219-bp promoter region. A putative TATA-box at position -1166, two consensus sequence of ACTGG, characteristic of leader binding protein-1 (LBP-1) binding motifs at position -563 and -211 and nine CAAT boxes were found in the promoter region of ESG gene. The protein-coding sequence is interrupted by five introns. The length of introns 1 to 5 is 52, 252, 87, 53 and 518 bp, respectively. The overall structural relationships of the ESG-related proteins among human, mouse, rat, Xenopus, Drosophila and nematode were also analyzed.
