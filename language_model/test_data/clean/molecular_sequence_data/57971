1. Dietary treatment of blue crabs with cadmium led to an increase of cadmium metallothionein in the hepatopancreas. 2. Utilizing a unique purification procedure, poly A+ RNA was isolated from the hepatopancreas of control and cadmium-treated blue crabs with 260/280 nm ratios of 2.0 or better. 3. Poly A+ RNA was hybridized with a series of oligonucleotide probes derived from a portion of the amino acid sequence of lobster metallothionein. A single band of approx. 300 base pairs was present in control and cadmium-treated RNA from the hepatopancreas of blue crab. 4. A four-fold induction of the band occurred following cadmium exposure.
