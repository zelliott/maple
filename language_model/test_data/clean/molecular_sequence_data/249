A yellow-pigmented, rod-shaped, Gram-staining-negative, aerobic bacterial strain, designated CJ7(T), was isolated from a freshwater lake at Chung-Ang University in Anseong, South Korea. Results from 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the isolate was phylogenetically affiliated with members of the genus Flavobacterium. Strain CJ7(T) showed sequence similarity values of 91.5-98.0 % to the type strains of recognized Flavobacterium species. The DNA-DNA relatedness between strain CJ7(T) and Flavobacterium hercynium DSM 18292(T), which showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, was 25.4 %. The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 0) (18.3 %), summed feature 3 (comprising iso-C(15 : 0) 2-OH and/or C(16 : 1)omega7c) (16.1 %), iso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH (8.9 %), iso-C(15 : 0) 3-OH (7.2 %), iso-C(17 : 1)omega9c (6.1 %) and iso-C(15 : 1) (5.9 %). Flexirubin-type pigments were absent. The major isoprenoid quinone was menaquinone-6. The DNA G+C content was 34.5 mol%. The results obtained from this study, with a polyphasic taxonomic approach, suggested that strain CJ7(T) represents a novel species of the genus Flavobacterium for which the name Flavobacterium chungangense sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CJ7(T) (=KACC 13353(T)=JCM 15651(T)).
