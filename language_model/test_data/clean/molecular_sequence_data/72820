We have sequenced the cDNA for the 23 kDa subunit of the human mitochondrial respiratory complex I. The deduced protein consists of 210 amino acids (Mr = 23705 Da) with a 34 amino acid N terminus presumably acting as a presequence for mitochondrial import. The predicted mature protein (Mr = 20290 Da) is 92% identical to the bovine mitochondrial subunit and 72% to the Rhodobacter capsulatus NUOI counterpart. Two clusters of four cysteine residues are conserved among these proteins. The gene (NDUFS8) coding for the human subunit has been mapped to chromosome 11q13.
