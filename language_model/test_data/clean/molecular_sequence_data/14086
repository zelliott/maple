The leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) regulates transcription of the many genes of the Lrp regulon, repressing some and activating others, some in response to L-leucine and some independent of it. The physiology and molecular biology of the regulon in Escherichia coli are summarized here. However, the high degree of conservation of the protein suggests that it has an important role in all enterobacteria. We suggest that this role is not only as a transcriptional regulator but also as a determinant of chromosome structure.
