An alpha-amylase gene from Micrococcus sp. 207 was cloned into Escherichia coli JM101 using the vector pHSG399. The constructed recombinant plasmid pYK63 contained a 4.8 kb chromosomal DNA fragment derived from strain 207 DNA. The cloned amylase isolated from E. coli JM101 (pYK63) produced mainly maltotetraose from starch, and exhibited temperature and pH activity profiles closely similar to those of the enzyme from the original strain. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned DNA fragment revealed one open reading frame containing the gene which consisted of 3312 bp (1104 amino acids). When compared with several other alpha-amylases, three consensus sequences were identified in the region of the active site. About 300 amino acid residues were present both upstream and downstream of the active site region.
