The budding bacterium Blastobacter natatorius belongs to the alpha-4 group of the Proteobacteria and clusters phylogenetically on a deep branch with Sphingomonas capsulata, with which it shares 93.9% 16S rRNA sequence similarity. On phylogenetic, phenotypic, and chemotaxonomic grounds a proposal is made to transfer B. natatorius to the genus Blastomonas gen. nov. as Blastomonas natatoria comb. nov.
