We studied 40 strains of the species complex formerly classified as the single species Sporothrix schenckii to identify new species within this complex and evaluate their antifungal susceptibility profiles. Based on phenotypic tests (ability to grow at 37Â°C, colony diameters, and pigmentation of the colonies, as well as assimilation of sucrose and raffinose) and molecular assays (amplification of a fragment of the calmodulin gene), here we report the identification of S. albicans, S. brasiliensis, S. luriei, and S. schenckii; two isolates of these species were detected as itraconazole-resistant strains.
