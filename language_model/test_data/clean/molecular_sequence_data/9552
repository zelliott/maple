Hordeum populations are becoming increasingly difficult to control in cropping fields. Two herbicide-resistant H. leporinum populations were identified during a random crop survey after herbicides were applied. The study aimed to determine the herbicide resistance profile of these H. leporinum biotypes to a range of herbicides used for their control.

Based on dose-response studies, one H. leporinum population was very highly resistant to sulfosulfuron and sulfometuron (both sulfonylurea herbicides) and also displayed low-level resistance to imazamox (an imidazolinone herbicide). Reduced sensitivity of the ALS enzyme was identified with in vitro activity assays. Gene sequence analysis revealed a proline-to-threonine substitution at amino acid position 197 of ALS, which is likely to be the molecular basis for resistance in this population. Herbicide screening also revealed a different H. leporinum population with resistance to the bipyridyl herbicide paraquat.

This study established the first cases of (1) sulfonylurea-to-imidazolinone cross-resistance and (2) field-evolved paraquat resistance in a Hordeum species in Western Australia.
