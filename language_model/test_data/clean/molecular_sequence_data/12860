The iron-regulated promoter involved in desferrioxamine B synthesis of Streptomyces pilosus contains a region homologous to the iron repressor (DtxR)-binding site of the diphtheria toxin gene promoter in Corynebacterium diphtheriae [GÃ¼nter et al., J. Bacteriol. 175 (1993) 3295-3302]. Here, we report the cloning and sequencing of the putative Streptomyces iron repressor gene, homologous to dtxR of C. diphtheriae. The N-terminal 139 amino acids of the deduced protein are 73% identical to DtxR.
