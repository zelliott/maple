The fission yeast ste7 mutant cannot mate and undergo meiosis, but shows no defect in vegetative growth. We cloned and characterized the ste7 gene. The deduced ste7 gene product (Ste7p) was a protein of 569 amino acids with no significant similarity to other proteins. Transcription of ste7 was induced by nutrient starvation via the function of the transcription factor Ste11p. Disruption of the ste7 gene blocked both conjugation and meiosis, showing that Ste7p plays a positive role in these two processes, probably activating the pheromone signal pathway. Unexpectedly, overexpression of ste7(+) promoted conjugation but inhibited meiosis in wild-type cells. The temperature-sensitive pat1-114 mutant underwent ectopic conjugation at the semirestrictive temperature when its genetic background was ste7(+), whereas the same mutant initiated haploid meiosis when its genetic background was ste7Delta. Two-hybrid analysis suggested that Ste7p interacts physically with both Pat1p and Mei2p, which together constitute the major switch to initiate meiosis. Ste7p tagged with green fluorescent protein accumulated in haploid cells under nutrient starvation until they completed conjugation, but this protein disappeared when they were to enter meiosis. These observations suggest that Ste7p may have a function to suppress the onset of meiosis until the conjugation process has been duly completed.
