Two unusual Actinobacillus isolates were recovered from pigs with no clinical signs, no lesions and no history of swine pleuropneumonia. Two representative strains (9953L55 and 0347) analyzed in this study were initially biochemically and antigenically identified as A. pleuropneumoniae serotypes 1 and 9, respectively, by traditional identification methods. Both strains presented, however, negative results with three A. pleuropneumoniae-specific PCR tests and revealed in particular the absence of the apxIV toxin genes. However, both strains produced and secreted ApxII toxin although they only harbored the toxin genes apxIICA, which is an uncommon feature for any of the known A. pleuropneumoniae serotypes. Upon experimental inoculation of pigs, these strains proved to be totally non-pathogenic. Animals infected with one of the strains produced antibodies that cross-react with A. pleuropneumoniae serotypes 1-9-11-specific LC-LPS ELISA. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that these strains form a separate phylogenetic group that is distinct from other Actinobacillus species and is particularly different from A. pleuropneumoniae.
