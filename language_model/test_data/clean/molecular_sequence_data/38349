Enzyme-inhibitor specificity was studied for alpha-amylases and their inhibitors. We purified and cloned the cDNAs of two different alpha-amylase inhibitors from the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and have recently cloned the cDNA of an alpha-amylase of the Mexican bean weevil (Zabrotes subfasciatus), which is inhibited by alpha-amylase inhibitor 2 but not by alpha-amylase inhibitor 1. The crystal structure of AI-1 complexed with pancreatic porcine alpha-amylase allowed us to model the structure of AI-2. The structure of Zabrotes subfasciatus alpha-amylase was modeled based on the crystal structure of Tenebrio molitor alpha-amylase. Pairwise AI-1 and AI-2 with PPA and ZSA complexes were modeled. For these complexes we first identified the interface forming residues. In addition, we identified the hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions and loss of hydrophobic surface area resulting from complex formation. The parameters we studied provide insight into the general scheme of binding, but fall short of explaining the specificity of the inhibition. We also introduce three new tools-software packages STING, HORNET and STINGPaint-which efficiently determine the interface forming residues and the ionic interaction data, the hydrogen bond net as well as aid in interpretation of multiple sequence alignment, respectively.
