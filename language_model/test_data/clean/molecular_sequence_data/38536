The complete DNA sequence of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene complex of Verticillium dahliae: Intraspecific heterogeneity within the intergenic spacer region. Fungal Genetics and Biology 29, 19-27. The complete sequence of the nuclear ribosomal DNA gene complex of the phytopathogenic fungus Verticillium dahliae has been determined. The tandemly repeated unit was 7216 bp long and appears to be the shortest rDNA cluster described so far among filamentous fungi. Primer pairs were designed for amplification of the region spanning half of the 28S subunit, the intergenic spacer (IGS), and the 5' end of 18S subunit of a number of Verticillium strains, isolated from various hosts and geographic origins. Great heterogeneity was detected in the amplified products of the IGS region resulting in fragments varying from 1.6 to 2.0 kb. The majority of Verticillium isolates were classified into two groups with 1.6- and 1.7-kb amplified products, respectively. The former group included 31 V. dahliae, 7 V. longisporum, and 1 V. albo-atrum isolates, whereas the latter included 10 V. dahliae and 1 V. albo-atrum isolates. Sequence analysis of representative PCR products of the above groups identified a "hot-spot" region harboring most of larger insertions, whereas most of the small changes were due to transitions and transversions. One V. longisporum isolate with a 2.0-kb PCR product contained 13 perfectly conserved tandem repeats of 39 bp long. The presence of similar incomplete sequences in the corresponding regions of V. dahliae, V. longisporum, and V. albo-atrum isolates revealed a particular standard motif of insertions in the IGS region of the genus and is discussed.
