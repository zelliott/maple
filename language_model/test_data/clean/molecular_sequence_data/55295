In this study, a novel 28-bp insertion-deletion (indel) polymorphism (AJ298878:g.47836-47853insCCTCAGACACTGAGTCTCCCCAACAGCA) was found in goat prion protein (PRNP) gene in 2373 goats from 13 Chinese native breeds. The frequencies of allele "ins" varied from 0.500 to 1.000 in different breeds. The establishment of association of the 28-bp indel polymorphism with production traits was performed in Inner Mongolia white cashmere (IMWC) and Xinong Sannen dairy (XNSN) breeds. Two significant associations between this polymorphism and 1-year-old body mass (P = 0.011) and average body mass (P = 0.024) were observed in IMWC breed, as well as wool thickness of 3-year-olds (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the novel 28-bp indel polymorphism was significantly associated with total solids in the evening (%) (P = 0.009) and milk yield (P = 0.016) in XNSN breed. These findings suggested that the 28-bp indel polymorphism was a potential DNA marker for eliminating or selecting preferred individuals in relation to production traits in goat marker-assisted selection breeding while carrying out preventing scrapie project.
