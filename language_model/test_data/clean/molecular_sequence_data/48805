Growing evidence supports a role for the unfolded protein response (UPR) in carcinogenesis; however, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain elusive. Herein, we identified the circadian clock PER1 mRNA as a novel substrate of the endoribonuclease activity of the UPR sensor IRE1α. Analysis of the mechanism shows that IRE1α endoribonuclease activity decreased PER1 mRNA in tumor cells without affecting PER1 gene transcription. Inhibition of IRE1α signaling using either siRNA-mediated silencing or a dominant-negative strategy prevented PER1 mRNA decay, reduced tumorigenesis, and increased survival, features that were reversed upon PER1 silencing. Clinically, patients showing reduced survival have lower levels of PER1 mRNA expression and increased splicing of XBP1, a known IRE-α substrate, thereby pointing toward an increased IRE1α activity in these patients. Hence, we describe a novel mechanism connecting the UPR and circadian clock components in tumor cells, thereby highlighting the importance of this interplay in tumor development.
