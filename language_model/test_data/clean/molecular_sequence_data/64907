Glutathione S-transferases (GST) catalyzing the conjugation of reduced glutathione to a vast range of xenobiotics including insecticides were characterized in the whitefly Bemisia tabaci. GST activities were determined in susceptible and resistant strains of B. tabaci towards artificial substrates, i.e. 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) in a photometric microplate assay and monochlorobimane (MCB) in a fluoroemtric microplate assay and characterized by their Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The inhibitory potential of ethacrynic acid was very effective with IC50-values between 0.9 and 5.8 microM depending on substrate and strain. The inhibitory effect of dicumarol was 10 times lower. Glutathione-affinity chromatography purified GST enzymes of two different B. tabaci strains appeared as a single band on SDS-PAGE and had a molecular mass of 23.5 kDa determined by MALDI mass spectrometry. The N-terminus of the purified enzyme was sequenced by Edman degradation. The nearly full-length cDNA of the enzyme was isolated by RT-PCR using a degenerate primer derived from the N-terminal amino acid sequence and contained an open reading frame encoding a 194-amino-acid protein. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with GSTs from other species revealed that the enzyme is closely related to insect class sigma GSTs.
