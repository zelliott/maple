In this study we have defined the in vitro requirements for transcriptional regulation of the HIV-2 LTR in response to the HIV-1 and HIV-2 Tat proteins and addressed potential mechanisms of Tat function. HIV-2 contains a duplicated TAR RNA stem-loop structure in contrast to the single stem-loop structure found in HIV-1 TAR RNA. We demonstrated that the HIV-2 proximal TAR RNA stem-loop structure was more important for in vitro transcriptional activation by the HIV-1 and HIV-2 Tat proteins than the distal TAR RNA stem-loop though this downstream TAR element itself was able to confer Tat-responsiveness. The role of the two HIV-2 TAR RNA stem-loop bulge sequences was less critical than the loop sequences for in vitro transcriptional activation by Tat. In addition, we demonstrated that replacing the HIV-2 TATA element with that of HIV-1 markedly reduced the overall level of Tat activation. The role of the Tat-1 and Tat-2 proteins on the synthesis of HIV-1 and HIV-2 promoter proximal and promoter distal transcripts was then investigated. In contrast to the HIV-1 promoter, the HIV-2 promoter generated abundant levels of short transcripts in vitro transcription assays likely due to the structure of its duplicated TAR element. Both Tat-1 and Tat-2 increased the level of transcripts extending to the end of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 TAR elements as well as the level of transcripts extending more than 500 nucleotides from the transcription initiation site. However, the synthesis of transcripts within 30 nucleotides of the HIV-2 LTR transcription initiation site was unchanged in either the presence or absence of Tat while the level of transcripts extending increasing distances from the HIV-2 LTR transcription initiation site were progressively stimulated in the presence of Tat. Though the HIV-1 Tat protein was a stronger inducer of HIV-1 LTR transcription than the HIV-2 Tat protein, we did not detect differences in the binding of these proteins to the HIV-1 and HIV-2 TAR RNAs. This suggested that differences in their transactivation properties may be due to alterations in their association with RNA polymerase II or associated elongation factors.
