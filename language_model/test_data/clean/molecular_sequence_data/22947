The Poisson-Boltzmann theory has been widely used in the studies of energetics and conformations of biological macromolecules. Recently, introduction of the efficient generalized Born approximation has greatly extended its applicability to areas such as protein folding simulations where highly efficient computation is crucial. However, limitations have been found in the folding simulations of a well-studied beta hairpin with several generalized Born implementations and different force fields. These studies have raised the question whether the underlining Poisson-Boltzmann theory, on which the generalized Born model is calibrated, is adequate in the treatment of polar interactions for the challenging protein folding simulations. To address the question whether the Poisson-Boltzmann theory in the current formalism might be insufficient, we directly tested our efficient numerical Poisson-Boltzmann implementation in the beta-hairpin folding simulation. Good agreement between simulation and experiment was found for the beta-hairpin equilibrium structures when the numerical Poisson-Boltzmann solvent and a recently improved generalized Born solvent were used. In addition simulated thermodynamic properties also agree well with experiment in both solvents. Finally, an overall agreement on the beta-hairpin folding mechanism was found between the current and previous studies. Thus, our simulations indicate that previously observed limitations are most likely due to imperfect calibration in previous generalized Born models but not due to the limitation of the Poisson-Boltzmann theory.
