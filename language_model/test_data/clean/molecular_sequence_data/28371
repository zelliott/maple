Some of microorganisms have been known to possess penicillin G acylase activity. The E. coli derived penicillin G acylase (PGA) can catalyze the conversion of penicillin G into phenylacetic acid and 6-amino-penicillanic acid, the latter is used as the starting compound for the industrial formation of semi-synthetic penicillins. Apart from its industrial importance, the enzyme PGA displays a number of interesting properties. Catalytically active enzyme is localized in the periplasmic space of E. coli cells and composed of two dissimilar subunits. The two subunits are apparently produced from a precursor protein, via a processing pathway hitherto unique in its features for a prokaryotic enzyme. The studies on processing of the precursor and on the relationship between structure and function of the mature enzyme are important theoretically. Previously we cloned a 3.5 kb DNA fragment from a strain (E. coli AS 1.76), which displays PGA activity. In this paper, we report a nucleotide sequence of the 3.5 kb DNA fragment containing PGA gene. After insertion of the DNA fragment into EcoR I and Hind III sites in pWR 13, pPGA 20 had been obtained. We subcloned the Hind III and Bg1 II treated fragment of 1.6 kb in length from pPGA 20 into Hind III and BamH I sites of pWR 13 to get a pPGA 1.6, and Bg1 II and EcoR I treated fragment of 1.9 kb in length into BamH I and EcoR I sites of pWR 13 to get a pPGA 1.9. The linearized pPGA 1.9 which were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes were progressively shortened from both ends respectively by digestion with Bal 31 nuclease, followed by cleavage of shortened target DNA off vector DNA molecules with appropriate restriction enzymes. The series of the DNA fragments shortened from EcoR I end were then cloned into plasmid pWR 13 which had previously digested with Hind III and Sma I enzymes (Fig. 1). The DNA fragment cloned in pWR 13 were directly sequenced on the resulted plasmids by using primer I and primer II. Thus we have obtained the complete nucleotide sequence of the 3.5 kb DNA fragment. The 3.5 kb fragment contains an intact PGA gene which is 2.6 kb.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
