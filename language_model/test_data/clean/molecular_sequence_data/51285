Acetyl CoA: deacetylcephalosporin C O-acetyltransferase, which catalyzes the final step of the biosynthetic pathway to cephalosporin C, was stabilized by a buffer solution containing 7-aminocephalosporanic acid and purified over 1300-fold from Acremonium chrysogenum. The purified enzyme has a molecular weight of 55,000 as measured by gel filtration. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed two subunit bands corresponding to molecular weights of 27,000 and 14,000. The enzyme has an isoelectoric point at pH 4.0 and optimum activity at pH 7.5.
