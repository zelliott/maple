In Drosophila the genes responsible for specifying segment identity (the homeotic genes) are transcribed in complex patterns during development. Mutations that mimic loss of homeotic gene activity identify cis-acting DNA sequences and trans-acting proteins required for transcriptional activation. Some of the trans-acting proteins may facilitate interactions between cis-regulatory elements and the promoter by bringing together distant chromosomal elements.
