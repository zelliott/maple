Genomic sequences of gonadotropin-releasing hormone genes were amplified and examined for sequence divergence among members of three different genera of the subfamily Salmoninae: rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). Sequences of GNRH3A and GNRH3B (formerly known as sGnRH1 and sGnRH2) were 97-99% similar in coding regions and 94-98% similar in non-coding regions among genera, but comparisons within species between GNRH3A and GNRH3B were only 90-92% similar in coding regions and 83-89% similar in non-coding regions. Polymorphisms in the parents of mapping families for each species allowed for linkage mapping of the GNRH3B gene in all three species and the GNRH3A gene in rainbow trout. GNRH3B maps to linkage group 6 in rainbow trout, linkage group 16 in Atlantic salmon and linkage group 25 in Arctic charr. GNRH3A mapped to linkage group 30 in rainbow trout.
