cDNAs encoding the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II were isolated from a Dictyostelium cDNA library. A total of 2.9 kilobases (kb) of cDNA was sequenced and the amino acid sequence of the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein was deduced. Similar to other eukaryotic RNA polymerases II, the largest subunit of Dictyostelium RNA polymerase II contains a unique repetitive tail domain at its carboxyl-terminal region. It consists of 24 highly conserved heptapeptide repeats, with a consensus sequence of Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser. In addition to the tail domain, five segments of the deduced primary structure show > 50% sequence identity with either yeast or mouse protein. RNA blots show that cDNA probes hybridized with a single mRNA species of approximately 6 kb and immunoblots using a monoclonal antibody raised against the tail domain lighted up a single protein band of 200 kilodaltons. Interestingly, expression of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II appears to be under developmental regulation. The accumulation of its mRNA showed a 60% increase during the first 3 h of development, followed by a steady decrease during the next 6 h. Cells began to accumulate a higher level of the RNA polymerase II mRNA after 9 h of development. When cells were treated with low concentrations of cAMP pulses to stimulate the developmental process, the pattern of mRNA accumulation moved 3 h ahead, but otherwise remained similar to that of control cells.
