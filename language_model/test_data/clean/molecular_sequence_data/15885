It is proposed that peptide T, a protein sequence found in the HIV coat, shares homology with the carboxyl-terminal extension of the gamma-3-MSH neuropeptide. Based on this observation, it is hypothesized that the N-terminal gamma-MSH sequence is probably present in the glycoprotein coat. It is concluded that many of the symptoms caused by HIV are mediated by the gamma-MSH receptor.
