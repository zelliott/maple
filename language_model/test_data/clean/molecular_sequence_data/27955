The nucleotide sequence of the Escherichia coli narK gene, which is located in the upstream region of the narCHJI operon, was determined. The narK gene encodes a very hydrophobic protein with 463 amino acid residues (Mr 49,693). A narK deletion mutant, under conditions for the induction of nitrate respiration, was unable to perform nitrate transport. Loss of transport activity was recovered by transforming the mutant with a narK+ plasmid. Thus, we conclude that the narK gene encodes a transmembrane protein participating in nitrate transport. In the narK promoter region, we defined a unique sequence that we designate as a 'nitrate box', functioning as a putative NarL-binding site, in addition to the consensus sequence of the 'anaero-box'.
