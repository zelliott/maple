Acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) added externally to cells has been proposed to enter the nucleus and stimulate DNA synthesis, but it has remained controversial whether or not exogenous aFGF has the capability of crossing cellular membranes. To test this, a novel principle to study translocation of proteins to the cytosol was developed by fusing a C-terminal farnesylation signal, a CAAX tag (C = Cys, A = an aliphatic amino acid, and X = any amino acid), onto aFGF. Farnesylation is only known to occur in the cytosol and possibly in the nucleus. When incubated with NIH3T3 cells overnight, about one-third of the cell-associated, CAAX-tagged growth factor was farnesylated, indicating that efficient translocation had taken place. Binding to specific FGF receptors was required for translocation to occur. Part of the farnesylated growth factor was found in the nuclear fraction. The data indicate that CAAX-tagged aFGF added externally to cells is able to cross cellular membranes and enter the cytosol and the nucleus.
