Chlamydophila abortus is a common cause of ruminant abortion. Here we report the genome sequence of strain LLG, which differs genotypically and phenotypically from the wild-type strain S26/3. Genome sequencing revealed differences between LLG and S26/3 to occur in pseudogene content, in transmembrane head/inc family proteins, and in biotin biosynthesis genes.
