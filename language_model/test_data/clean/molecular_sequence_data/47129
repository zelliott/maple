The complete nucleotide sequence of HN gene, the region of F gene, and intergene regions (M-F, F-HN, and HN-L) of the BOR74 and BOR82 strains of Newcastle disease virus have been determined. Based on the nucleotide and amino acid sequences, the speeds of the nucleic and amino acid changes were calculated (approximately 10(-3) nucleotides or amino acids/year). The BOR strains were grouped phylogenetically with the asymptomatic strains. These strains and the BOR strains have the same motif of the cleavage site (112GKQGR116-L117), but the HN protein of BOR strains has the 572 amino acids which differ the BOR strains from all other strains (571, 577, and 616 amino acids).
