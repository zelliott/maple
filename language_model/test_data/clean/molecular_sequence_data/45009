Multidimensional ion mobility spectrometry (IMS-IMS and IMS-IMS-IMS) techniques have been combined with mass spectrometry (MS) and investigated as a means of generating and separating peptide and protein fragment ions. When fragments are generated inside a drift tube and then dispersed by IMS prior to MS analysis, it is possible to observe many features that are not apparent from MS analysis alone. The approach is demonstrated by examining fragmentation patterns arising from electrospray ion distributions of insulin chain B and ubiquitin. The multidimensional IMS approach makes it possible to select individual components for collisional activation and to disperse fragments based on differences in mobility prior to MS analysis. Such an approach makes it possible to observe many features not apparent by MS analysis alone.
