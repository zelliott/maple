After screening a large number of clinical samples of HIV-1 subtype C in India, a subset of viral strains containing sequence insertions upstream of the viral enhancer has been identified. The sequence insertions contained binding sites for at least two different transcription factors NF-κB and RBEIII, importantly, in a mutually exclusive fashion. Furthermore, while some of the viral strains contained insertions of κB-like sites, a few others contained dual insertions of the RBEIII and κB sites together but only one of the two was intact. NF-κB acquisition appears to be the most common phenotype unique for subtype C with nearly half of the variant strains containing such insertions. Given that subtype C already contains three functional NF-κB sites in the viral enhancer, acquisition of a fourth NF-κB motif in some variant viral strains is intriguing. Further investigation is warranted to examine the significance of the sequence insertions for the replicative fitness of the variant viral strains.
