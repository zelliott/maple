Methylxanthines and methyluric acids are purine alkaloids that are synthesized in quantity in a limited number of plant species, including tea, coffee and cacao. This review summarizes the pathways, enzymes and related genes of caffeine biosynthesis. The main biosynthetic pathway is a sequence consisting of xanthosine → 7-methylxanthosine → 7-methylxanthine → theobromine → caffeine. Catabolism of caffeine starts with its conversion to theophylline. Typically, this reaction is very slow in caffeine-accumulating plants. Finally, the ecological roles of caffeine and the production of decaffeinated coffee plants are discussed.
