The choice of 98% sequence homology for immunoglobulin heavy chains to distinguish between mutated and unmutated versions of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) was arbitrary and was chosen to account for supposed polymorphisms. Some authors chose 97% or even 95%. This study examined survival curves for cohorts of patients with varying degrees of sequence homology. All patients with <97% homology behaved as if mutated. Those with 97-98% homology were more aggressive than the mutated cases, but less aggressive than those with >98% homology.
