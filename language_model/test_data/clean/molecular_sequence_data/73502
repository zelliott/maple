Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit VIIc is one of the nuclear encoded subunits of the 13-subunit holoenzyme that carries out the terminal step in the electron transport chain. We have isolated the gene for this subunit, previously shown to be ubiquitously expressed from a single copy gene in the genome, and show that 167 base pairs of DNA surrounding the transcriptional start site contain the minimal promoter of this gene. This basal promoter contains two YY1 sites and at least one site for NRF-2, which show binding to their cognate factors. Mutation of both YY1 sites eliminates most of the promoter activity. Mutation at the upstream YY1 site significantly reduces the efficiency of transcript initiation at the major start site and thus plays the dominant role in COX7C regulation. COX7C is, thus, the second nuclear gene of COX that is regulated by YY1, suggesting that it is a third common factor, along with NRF-1 and NRF-2, to be associated with COX gene regulation.
