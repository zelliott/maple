Nuclear matrix from HeLa cells was gently extracted with a high salt solution and treated with DNase I. DNA that remained associated with the nuclear matrix (N. M. DNA) and DNA fragments released into the supernatant (SN.DNA) were isolated respectively and dot hybridized to human telomere sequence (AGGGTT/TCCCAA)40 probe. As the time of DNase I treatment was extended, the amount of N. M. DNA decreased while the concentration of telomere sequence in N.M. DNA proportionally increased. These preliminary results suggest that the telomere sequence is tightly bound to nuclear matrix in HeLa cells.
