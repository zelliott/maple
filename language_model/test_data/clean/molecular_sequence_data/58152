As part of a study of the diversity of myosins, we have cloned a cDNA encoding a myosin-like protein from Arabidopsis thaliana. This is the first molecular motor of any kind to be cloned from a higher plant. The predicted polypeptide (molecular weight 131 kDa) has a motor domain (head) very similar to those of other myosins, but the remainder of the sequence is unusual. The tail contains four potential calmodulin binding sites ("IQ-motifs"), but no sequence motifs suggestive of actin or phospholipid binding, like those found in other myosins. There is also a small region of probable alpha-helical coiled-coil, which suggests that the molecule could be dimeric, though unlikely to form filaments. The N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the molecule are unique. We present a phylogenetic analysis of myosin head sequences, which suggests that this is a new type of myosin.
