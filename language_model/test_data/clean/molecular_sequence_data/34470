In conditions of fluctuating light, cyanobacteria thermally dissipate excess absorbed energy at the level of the phycobilisome, the light-collecting antenna. The photoactive Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) and Fluorescence Recovery Protein (FRP) have essential roles in this mechanism. Absorption of blue-green light converts the stable orange (inactive) OCP form found in darkness into a metastable red (active) form. Using an in vitro reconstituted system, we studied the interactions between OCP, FRP, and phycobilisomes and demonstrated that they are the only elements required for the photoprotective mechanism. In the process, we developed protocols to overcome the effect of high phosphate concentrations, which are needed to maintain the integrity of phycobilisomes, on the photoactivation of the OCP, and on protein interactions. Our experiments demonstrated that, whereas the dark-orange OCP does not bind to phycobilisomes, the binding of only one red photoactivated OCP to the core of the phycobilisome is sufficient to quench all its fluorescence. This binding, which is light independent, stabilizes the red form of OCP. Addition of FRP accelerated fluorescence recovery in darkness by interacting with the red OCP and destabilizing its binding to the phycobilisome. The presence of phycobilisome rods renders the OCP binding stronger and allows the isolation of quenched OCP-phycobilisome complexes. Using the in vitro system we developed, it will now be possible to elucidate the quenching process and the chemical nature of the quencher.
