'Retrons' are bacterial retroelements responsible for the synthesis of msDNA, a hybrid nucleic acid consisting of a single-stranded DNA that is branched out from an internal guanosine of an RNA molecule via a 2',5'-phosphodiester linkage. Retrons are found in a minor population of various bacterial species and are extensively diverse. Two important questions now demanding attention are whether retrons are mobile elements and why are they so diverse?
