Enzymatic hatching of fish embryos is caused by a sequential occurrence of many elementary processes from the commitment of the hatching gland cells to the emergence of the embryos. Molecular biological approaches to the formation, properties and function of the hatching enzyme should be required for elucidation of the enzymatic hatching, since this enzyme is a key molecule to analyze these processes. Besides them, there are some other processes indirectly related to hatching, e.g., formation and hardening of the egg envelope. The present article describes the results of our studies on some of the above-mentioned problems in the fish, Oryzias latipes, which have been obtained mostly in the early 1990s.
