We have identified a minimum functional domain of human thrombomodulin for anticoagulant activity using deletion analysis. Four mutants were constructed by site-directed deletion mutagenesis to delete one or more epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like structures from the domain of human thrombomodulin containing six repeated EGF-like structures. These deletion mutants were expressed transiently in COS-1 cells, and their protein C-activating cofactor activities in the culture medium were examined. One mutant protein, E456, which contains the fourth, fifth, and sixth EGF-like structures expresses apparent cofactor activity. However, neither E456-N24 (24 NH2-terminal-residue deletion) nor E456-C16 (16 COOH-terminal-residue deletion) have cofactor activity. E456 was partially purified and its anticoagulant effects on plasma clotting time and platelet aggregation examined. E456 expressed almost the same anticoagulant activities as D123 which contains six consecutive EGF-like structures of thrombomodulin. It was concluded that E456 is the minimum functional domain for both protein C-activating cofactor activity and anticoagulant activity.
