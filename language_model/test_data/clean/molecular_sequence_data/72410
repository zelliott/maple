Seven peptides from subunit 9 (S9) of the human 26S proteasome were sequenced and this information was used to clone a HeLa cDNA that encodes the 46 kDa subunit. Rabbit polyclonal antisera were made against a ubiquitin fusion protein containing 12 amino acids from S9 and against a full-length S9 expressed in E. coli. Western blot analysis showed that the S9-specific antibodies bound the 26S proteasome and its regulatory complex separated on non-denaturing gels. In SDS-PAGE samples of the two complexes, the S9-specific antibodies bound a single 46 kDa subunit. Thus, a cDNA encoding a novel 26S protease subunit has been isolated, sequenced, and expressed.
