In this review, we consider the relationship between the structure and function of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-HSD) purified from rat liver. The rat liver enzyme is a single domain glycoprotein with a unique active site and belongs to the short chain alcohol dehydrogenase family. Evidence supporting the presence in other tissues of 11-HSD isoforms is discussed.
