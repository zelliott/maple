The biological relevance of sulfur containing carbohydrates is gaining substantial attention. Thus the new developments, especially in the synthetic and medicinal chemistry of thio-sugars are critically important for carbohydrate drug design. New studies of biological processes including biosynthetic reactions and enzyme control mechanisms, discovered during the last few years clearly contributed to an understanding of their biological roles. These roles of carbohydrates and thio-sugars in particular through biological processes and diseases are becoming better understood now. These new trends will provide tremendous opportunities for the development of carbohydrates as new potential drugs. The main objective of this article is to address these new promising advances
