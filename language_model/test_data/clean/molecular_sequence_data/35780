The self complementary DNA dodecamers d(CGCGAATTCGCG), d(CGCGTTAACGCG), d(CGCGTATACGCG), d(CGCGATATCGCG), d(CGCAAATTTGCG), d(CGCTTTAAAGCG), d(CGCGGATCCGCG) and d(CGCGGTACCGCG) have been cloned into the Smal site of plasmid pUC19. Radiolabelled polylinker fragments containing these inserts have been digested with nucleases and chemical agents, probing the structure of the central AT base pairs. The sequences AATT and AAATTT are relatively resistant to digestion by DNase I, micrococcal nuclease and hydroxyl radicals, consistent with the suggestion that they possess a narrow minor groove. Nuclease digestion of TTAA is much more even, and comparable to that at mixed sequence DNA. TpA steps in ATAT, TATA and GTAC are cut less well by DNAse I than in TTAA. DNasel cleavage of surrounding bases, especially CpG is strongly influenced by the nature of the central sequence.
