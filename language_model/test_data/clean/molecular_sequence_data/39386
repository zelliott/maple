The principal protein component of the elastic fiber found in elastic tissues is elastin, an amorphous, cross-linked biopolymer that is assembled from a high molecular weight monomer. The hydrophobic and cross-linking domains of elastin have been considered separate and independent, such that changes to one region are not thought to affect the other. However, results from these solid-state 13C NMR experiments demonstrate that cooperativity in protein folding exists between the two domain types. The sequence of the EP20-24-24 polypeptide has three hydrophobic sequences from exons 20 and 24 of the soluble monomer tropoelastin, interspersed with cross-linking domains constructed from exons 21 and 23. In the middle of each cross-linking domain is a "hinge" sequence. When this pentapeptide is replaced with alanines, as in EP20-24-24[23U], its properties are changed. In addition to the expected increase in alpha-helical content and the resulting increase in rigidity of the cross-linking domains, changes to the organization of the hydrophobic regions are also observed. Using one-dimensional CPMAS (cross-polarization with magic angle spinning) techniques, including spectral editing and relaxation measurements, evidence for a change in dynamics to both domain types is observed. Furthermore, it is likely that the methyl groups of the leucines of the hydrophobic domains are also affected by the substitution to the hinge region of the cross-linking sequences. This cooperativity between the two domain types brings new questions to the phenomenon of coacervation in elastin polypeptides and strongly suggests that functional models for the protein must include a role for the cross-linking regions.
