We have synthesized the 24-41 fragment of the preS region of the hepatitis B (subtype ayw) envelope. The peptide was prepared by the solid phase synthesis on perfluoropoly-ethylene polymer grafted with polystyrene. The peptide chain was elongated from C-terminus using pentafluorophenyl- and p-nitrophenyl esters of Boc-amino acids. The peptide was cleaved off the solid phase by HBr in CF3COOH, purified by gel filtration, and, after conjugation with serum albumin (BSA), inoculated into mice. The resultant antibodies were shown to react with the peptide. The blood sera from patients with acute hepatitis B reacted with the peptide-BSA conjugates in the immunoenzymic solid phase assay.
