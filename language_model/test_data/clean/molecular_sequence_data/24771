We report here the synthesis, purification, and characterization of several large polypeptides related to the human activin beta(A) subunit and their cyclic counterparts. In particular, we describe for the first time the total chemical synthesis of a 105-mer polypeptide, des[1-11] activin beta(A), and related large-loop polypeptide, by an optimized solid phase synthetic protocol based on 9-flouroenylmethyoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry. These studies show that automated chemical synthesis utilizing Fmoc-based solid phase synthetic strategies provides a practical alternative to recombinant DNA technology for the production of activin-related subunits, with the opportunity to rapidly provide different analogues and structural variants for subsequent structure-function and associated biophysical investigations.
