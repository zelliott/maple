Health effects associated with poor indoor air quality have created a need for accurate, reproducible methods of monitoring the microbiological content of indoor air. Improved methods of detection may allow researchers to clarify the effect of individual species present in the indoor environment on human health. This review discusses the shortcomings of current methods of identification and detection and focuses on the potential for molecular techniques in this emerging field. Probe techniques, restriction endonuclease analysis, karyotyping, and DNA and polymerase chain reaction fingerprinting methods available to detect and identify bacteria and fungi significant in the indoor air environment are discussed. Problems that may be encountered using these techniques are also considered. The authors have included a brief discussion on current air sampling techniques as well as adapting these techniques for use with molecular detection methods.
