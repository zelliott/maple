Various surface modifications have been applied to titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) implants, in an attempt to enhance osseointegration; crucial for ideal prosthetic fixation. Despite the numerous studies demonstrating that peptide-modified surfaces influence in vitro cellular behavior, there is relatively little data reporting their effects on bone remodeling. The objective of this article was to examine the effects of chemically modifying Ti-6Al-4V surfaces with a common RGD sequence, a 15-residue peptide containing GRGDSP (glycine-arginine-glycine-aspartate-serine-proline), on the modulation of bone remodeling. The expression of proteins known to be associated with osseous matrix and bone resorption were studied during the growth of human bone-derived cells (HBDC) on these peptide-modified surfaces. HBDC grown for 7 days on RGD surfaces displayed significantly increased levels of osteocalcin, and pro-collagen Ialpha1 mRNAs, compared with the production by HBDC grown on the native Ti-6Al-4V. A pattern that was also reflected at the protein levels for osteocalcin, type I collagen, and bone sialoprotein. Moreover, HBDC grown for 7 and 14 days on RGD-modified Ti-6Al-4V expressed significantly higher level of osteoclast differentiation factors and lower levels of osteoprotegerin and IL-6 proteins compared with other surfaces tested. These results suggest that different chemical treatments of implant material (Ti-6Al-4V) surface result in differential bone responses, not only their ability to form bone but also to stimulate osteoclastic formation.
