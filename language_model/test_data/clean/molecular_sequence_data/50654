Monoclonal antibody CCH2 is commonly used for the detection of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infected cells in tissue sections as well as in cultured cells. The specificity of CCH2 was determined by screening a recombinant lambda-gt11 cDNA gene bank from HCMV-infected fibroblasts. By sequencing a reactive clone, the antigen was identified to be the non-structural DNA binding protein p52 of HCMV (UL44 reading frame). The viral insert from the lambda clone was recloned in bacterial expression vectors. For this, a new vector, pRos-RS, was constructed. The resulting clones were tested in immunoblot analyses. They were reactive with CCH2 as well as with reconvalescent sera positive for antibodies against HCMV, by this proving the specificity of CCH2. Using this monoclonal antibody in confocal microscopy, the subcellular localization of p52 in infected cells was analyzed. In these analyses, p52 was found to be nuclear and to be associated with the nuclear membrane at late times after infection.
