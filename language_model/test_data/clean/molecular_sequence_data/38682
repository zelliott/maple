An iterative in vitro splicing strategy was employed to select for optimal 3' splicing signals from a pool of pre-mRNAs containing randomized regions. Selection of functional branchpoint sequences in HeLa cell nuclear extract yielded a sequence motif that evolved from UAA after one round of splicing toward a UACUAAC consensus after seven rounds. A significant part of the selected sequences contained a conserved AAUAAAG motif that proved to be functional both as a polyadenylation signal and a branch site in a competitive manner. Characterization of the branchpoint in these clones to either the upstream or downstream adenosines of the AAUAAAG sequence revealed that the branching process proceeded efficiently but quite promiscuously. Surprisingly, the conserved guanosine, adjacent to the common AAUAAA polyadenylation motif, was found to be required only for polyadenylation. In an independent experiment, sequences surrounding an optimal branchpoint sequence were selected from two randomized 20-nt regions. The clones selected after six rounds of splicing revealed an extended polypyrimidine tract with a high frequency of UCCU motifs and a highly conserved YAG sequence in the extreme 3' end of the randomized insert. Mutating the 3' terminal guanosine of the intron strongly affects complex A formation, implying that the invariant AG is recognized early in spliceosome assembly.
