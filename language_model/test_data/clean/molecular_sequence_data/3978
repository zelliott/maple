Disruption of the sycrp1 gene encoding a cyanobacterial cAMP receptor protein makes cells of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 non-motile. Electron microscopy showed that the sycrp1-deficient strain had a reduced number of thick pili on the cell surface compared with the wild-type strain. It is suggested that cAMP-SYCRP1 complex controls the biogenesis of pili.
