Plants use specialized photoreceptors to detect the amount, quality, periodicity and direction of light and to modulate their growth and development accordingly. These regulatory light signals often interact with other environmental cues. Exposure of etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings to red (R) or far-red (FR) light causes hypocotyls to grow in random orientations with respect to the gravitational vector, thus overcoming the signal from gravity to grow upwards. This light response, mediated by either phytochrome A or phytochrome B, represents a prime example of cross-talk between environmental signalling systems. Here, we report the isolation the mutant gil1 (for gravitropic in the light) in which hypocotyls continue to grow upwards after exposure of seedlings to R or FR light. The gil1 mutant displays no other phenotypic alterations in response to gravity or light. Cloning of GIL1 has identified a novel gene that is necessary for light-dependent randomization of hypocotyl growth orientation. Using gil1, we have demonstrated that phytochrome-mediated randomization of Arabidopsis hypocotyl orientation provides a fitness advantage to seedlings developing in patchy, low-light environments.
