The 4194-bp plasmid, pRF1, from Plectonema sp. Strain PCC 6402 was completely sequenced and analyzed. Seven potential open reading frames were identified. The predicted amino acid sequence of open reading frame C (ORF C) had identities of 34, 29, and 25% with Rep B from the Staphylococcus aureus plasmid, pUB110; Rep from the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens plasmid, pFTB14; and protein A from the S. aureus plasmid, pC194, respectively. A 75-amino-acid region conserved in these proteins (Rep B, Rep, and protein A) also was highly conserved in ORF C with identities of 45, 37, and 40%, respectively. Significantly, 16 of the 21 amino acids conserved in Rep B, Rep, and protein A were found at the same positions in ORF C. This ORF may encode a replication protein that includes a region conserved in some eubacteria. Additional structural features include a 425-bp region that contains palindromes, tandem repeats, and short direct repeats which may correspond to the origin of replication. An 18-bp inverted repeat was located between two open reading frames, A and G.
