Thirty-three microsatellites have been mapped on the PiGMaP porcine genetic map. By comparison with the previously published PiGMaP maps, the maps of chromosome 2 (140 cM/70 cM) and chromosome 3 (180 cM/110 cM) were extended and new markers were mapped on the p-arm extremity of chromosome 7 and on the centromeric extremity of chromosome 15. New orders are proposed for markers on chromosomes 3 and 17. Six microsatellites isolated from cosmids were also localized on the cytogenetic map by fluorescent in situ hybridization. We tested the subcloning ligation mixture-polymerase chain reaction (SLiM-PCR) method for isolating microsatellites from cosmids. Subcloning is more effective when the cosmid harbours several microsatellites whereas SLiM-PCR is more straightforward when the cosmid contains a single microsatellite. Fifteen anonymous microsatellites were regionally assigned by using a hybrid cell panel. For map integration, the determination of a regional assignment of anonymous microsatellites by using a hybrid cell panel offers an alternative to microsatellite isolation from cosmids and their localizations by in situ hybridization.
