F-box proteins are a large family of eukaryotic proteins that are characterized by an approximately 40 amino acid motif. Some F-box proteins are critical for the controlled degradation of cellular regulatory proteins. Here we report that a novel member of F-box proteins, FBXO35 gene, was cloned and identified during the large-scale sequencing analysis from a human fetal brain cDNA library. FBXO35 gene shares amino acid similarity with several putative mouse genes not only in F-box domain but also in the rest of the sequence, which indicates that FBXO35 might also contain some other unknown conserved domain. RT-PCR analysis indicated that FBXO35 gene had a ubiquitously low expression pattern in most human adult tissues. According to bioinformatics analysis, the FBXO35 gene was found located in chromosome 3p21.
