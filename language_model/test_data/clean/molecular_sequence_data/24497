An allele specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR-SSP) assay for genotyping the mouse leptin receptor (Leprdb) mutation and its wild type (Lepr+) gene was developed using two different fluorescent dye-labeled primers. First, we determined the Leprdb and Lepr+ allele by PCR-SSP assay with usual dye-unlabeled primers. However this method requires two separate PCR reactions because the amplified products specific for each allele are almost the same size. We further developed a simple and reliable two-color PCR-SSP method that uses a color complementation strategy to distinguish the Leprdb and Lepr+ alleles. Leprdb/Leprdb, Leprdb/Lepr+ and Lepr+/Lepr+ of mice (5 each) were clearly genotyped by the two-color PCR-SSP. We also performed PCR-direct sequencing for the same samples and confirmed the accuracy of this method. This method makes it possible to reduce the number of PCR reactions because both alleles are amplified in the same reaction mixture.
