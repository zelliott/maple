A full-length cDNA clone of a human carbonic anhydrase XIV (HGMW-approved gene symbol CA14) was obtained and sequenced. The cDNA sequence was 1757 bp long and was predicted to encode a 337-amino-acid polypeptide with a molecular mass of 37.6 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of CA XIV showed an overall similarity of 29-46% to other active CA isozymes. The highest percentage similarity was with a transmembrane CA isoform, CA XII. As observed for CA XII, CA XIV has hydrophobic segments at both termini of the deduced protein for a putative signal sequence and a transmembrane domain. CA XIV showed low activity and was sensitive to acetazolamide, but not to sulfonamide. Northern blot analysis demonstrated an approximately 1.7-kb transcript in the adult human heart, brain, liver, and skeletal muscle. RNA dot-blot analysis for CA XIV mRNA expression showed a strong signal in all parts of the human brain and a weaker signal in the colon, small intestine, urinary bladder, and kidney. RT-PCR analysis showed an intense signal in the liver and spinal cord and a faint signal in the kidney. No CA XIV mRNA was seen in the salivary gland and pancreas. In contrast, CA XII mRNA was expressed in the kidney, salivary gland, and pancreas, but not in the liver or spinal cord. The CA XIV gene was localized to human chromosome 1q21. These findings indicate genetically distinct but closely related isoforms of human transmembrane CAs, CA XII and CA XIV, which have different patterns of tissue-specific expression.
