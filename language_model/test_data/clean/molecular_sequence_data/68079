We have investigated DNA synthesis and levels of H2B histone mRNA, and the binding pattern of nuclear proteins to various elements in the rat H2B histone gene upstream region with DNase I footprinting assay. Both DNA synthesis and H2B histone mRNA level were increased with maximal stimulation reached at 24 hrs and 36 hrs after partial hepatectomy, respectively. In DNase I footprinting analysis, the nuclear factors interacting with the three elements, TATA at -19 bp (site AR), site B at -29 bp, and CAAT at -69 bp (site C) were required during maximal increase of H2B histone mRNA level after partial hepatectomy. The DNase I protection pattern by nuclear extract of the cycloheximide-treated regenerating liver showed the same results with normal liver. These results suggest that transcriptional regulation of H2B histone gene during liver regeneration may be mediated by nuclear factors that are newly induced by partial hepatectomy.
