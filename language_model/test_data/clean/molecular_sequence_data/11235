Ineffective Frankia endophytes were retrieved from various wet soils by using Alnus glutinosa clones as trapping plants. No pure cultures could be isolated from these ineffective nodules. Therefore, the phylogenetic position of these endophytes was determined by sequence analysis of cloned PCR products of bacterial 16S rDNA, derived from nodules. The results showed that all nodule endophytes belong to a hitherto undescribed cluster of the Frankia phylogenetic tree. The position of these uncultured ineffective Frankia nodule endophytes is different from that of the ineffective Frankia isolates derived from A. glutinosa nodules, even when originating from the same geographical location. This suggests a bias in current isolation techniques.
