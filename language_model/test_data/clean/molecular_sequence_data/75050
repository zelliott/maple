Cloned cDNA sequences specific for prostaglandin F (PGF) synthase have been isolated from a cDNA library of bovine lung mRNA sequences. Nucleotide-sequence analyses of cloned cDNA inserts have revealed that PGF synthase consists of a 969-base pair open reading frame coding for a 323-amino acid polypeptide with a Mr of 36,666. The sequence analysis indicates that bovine lung PGF synthase shows 62% identical plus conservative substitutions compared with human liver aldehyde reductase [Wermuth, B., Omar, A., Forster, A., Francesco, C., Wolf, M., Wartburg, J.P., Bullock, B. & Gabbay, K.H. (1987) in Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism: Aldehyde Dehydrogenase, Aldo-Keto Reductase, and Alcohol Dehydrogenase, eds. Weiner, H. & Flynn, T.G. (Liss, New York), pp. 297-307], which is similar to PGF synthase in molecular weight and substrate specificity. However, comparison of the amino acid sequence of PGF synthase with the National Biomedical Research Foundation protein data base reveals that the sequences of 225 amino acids from C termini of epsilon-crystallin of the European common frog (Rana temporaria) [Tomarev, S.I., Zinovieva, R.D., Dolgilevich, S.M., Luchin, S.V., Krayev, A.S., Skryabin, K.G. & Gause, G.G. (1984) FEBS Lett. 171, 297-302] and of PGF synthase show 77% identical and conservative substitutions without deletions/additions. The result suggests that European common frog lens epsilon-crystallin is identical to bovine lung PGF synthase.
