An anion-translocating ATPase has been identified as the product of the arsenical resistance operon of resistance plasmid R773. When expressed in Escherichia coli this ATP-driven oxyanion pump catalyses extrusion of the oxyanions arsenite, antimonite and arsenate. Maintenance of a low intracellular concentration of oxyanion produces resistance to the toxic agents. The pump is composed of two polypeptides, the products of the arsA and arsB genes. This two-subunit enzyme produces resistance to arsenite and antimonite. A third gene, arsC, expands the substrate specificity to allow for arsenate pumping and resistance.
