Chromogranin A has been reported to be processed in vivo by an as yet undefined proteinase(s) suggesting that it is a precursor of biologically active peptides such as pancreastatin. In this study, plasma kallikrein was used as a model proteinase to identify the cleavage sites exposed in bovine parathyroid chromogranin A. Purified bovine parathyroid chromogranin A was digested with human plasma kallikrein. The proteolytic fragments produced were isolated by HPLC and chemically characterized by amino acid composition and sequence analysis. The combined results indicate that the enzyme has preference for specific single Arg residues, cutting C-terminal to this amino acid, although certain pairs of basic sites were also cleaved. The characterized fragments were released in a selective manner from the whole molecule with rapid production of the fragments covering positions 1-247 and 352-358.
