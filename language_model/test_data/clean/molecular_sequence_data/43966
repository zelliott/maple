A 2811 base-pair cDNA, encoding the amino-terminal part of the bovine pre-pro-von Willebrand factor, was characterized and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence shares significant homology with the human von Willebrand antigen II and the amino-terminal part of the factor VIII-binding domain of von Willebrand factor. In contrast to human, there is no RGD motif in the bovine von Willebrand antigen II. High levels of Cys, characteristic of D domains, are also found in bovine and the Cys position is markedly conserved between the two species.
