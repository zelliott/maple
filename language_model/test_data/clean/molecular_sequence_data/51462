Lactitol trihydrate, C12H24O11.3H2O, crystallises in the orthorhombic space group, P2(1)2(1)2(1) with cell dimensions a = 8.306(2), b = 10.163(1), c = 21.321(1) A, and V = 1799.8(5) A3; Z = 4, Dx = 1.47 Mg m-3, lambda(Cu-K alpha) = 1.54178 A, mu = 1.14 mm-1, F(000) = 856, and T = 23 degrees. There are one intra- and thirteen inter-molecular hydrogen bonds in the structure. The bond lengths and angles agree well with the mean values of related structures. The galactopyranosyl ring has a chair conformation.
