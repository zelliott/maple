We have previously identified a discrete hnRNP polypeptide of the A/B type, named mBx, as an abundant protein species in murine cells. The molecular characterization of this protein is now accomplished. From all evidence provided, mBx polypeptide represents a new gene product, distinct from the known members of the A/B family A1 and A2/B1. It is, instead, mostly related to a still hypothetical human protein of A/B type, as well as to the Xenopus hnRNPA3 protein species.
