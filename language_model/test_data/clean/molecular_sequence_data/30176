The rat chromosomal gene for uricase was cloned. The gene spans more than 20 kilobases and the coding region is divided into 8 exons by 7 introns. The organization of the rat uricase gene is so greatly different from that of the soybean gene that the difference may not have been caused only by the removal of some ancestral introns during the period of widely separated evolution.
