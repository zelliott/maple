We isolated a member of the facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT) gene family (GLUT11; SLC2A11 as a HGMW-approved symbol) based on the analysis of a human genomic BAC clone KB1125A3 located on band q11.2 of human chromosome 22. The gene GLUT11/SLC2A11 consists of 12 exons spanning over 29 kb in size and is located between two genes, SMARCB1 and MIF. The deduced amino acid sequence indicated the topological features of transmembrane helices and sequence motifs which are common to the GLUT protein family. The cDNA cloning revealed the presence of three types of variation in its transcripts. The first variation is caused by the existence of three distinct first exons (SLC2A11-a, -b, and -c). PCR analysis of multi-tissue-derived cDNA panels indicated the differential expression of these transcript variants. The second variation is caused by skipping over one exon (exon 6). The third variation is caused by the premature transcription termination at a site between exon 8 and exon 9. Both exon skipping and premature termination caused frameshift, resulting in the production of truncated GLUT11/SLC2A11 transcripts. These results suggested that transcription of GLUT11/SCL2A11 gene is controlled in a complex manner.
