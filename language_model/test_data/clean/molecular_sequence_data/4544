A new member of human origin recognition complex (ORC) has been cloned and identified as the human homologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORC4. HsORC4 is a 45-kDa protein encoded by a 2.2-kilobase mRNA whose amino acid sequence is 29% identical to ScORC4. HsORC4 has a putative nucleotide triphosphate binding motif that is not seen in ScORC4. HsORC4P also reveals an unsuspected homology to the ORC1-Cdc18 family of proteins. HsORC4 mRNA expression and protein levels remain constant through the cell cycle. HsORC4P is coimmunoprecipitated from cell extracts with another subunit of human ORC, HsORC2P, consistent with it being a part of the putative human origin recognition complex.
