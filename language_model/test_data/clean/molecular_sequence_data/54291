Chitin synthase catalyzes chitin synthesis in the exoskeleton, tracheal system and gut during insect development. A chitin synthase 1 (CfCHS1) cDNA was identified and cloned from the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana. The CfCHS1 cDNA is 5,300 bp in length and codes a 1,564-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 178 kDa. The deduced protein contains 16 transmembrane helixes in its domains A and C. The single copy CfCHS1 gene expressed during each of the larval molts from the 3rd to the 6th instar. The gene expressed highly and periodically in the epidermis during each of molts, whereas no transcripts were detected in the midgut and fat body. 20-hydroxyecdysone and the ecdysone agonist RH5992 suppressed CfCHS1 expression, whereas the juvenile hormone analog methoprene induced CfCHS1 expression. These results implicate that CfCHS1 is involved in the chitin synthase and new chitin formation during molting in the insect.
