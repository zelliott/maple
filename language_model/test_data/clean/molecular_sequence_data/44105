The Vibrio cholerae rpoH gene coding for the heat-shock sigma factor, sigma 32, has been cloned and shown to functionally complement Escherichia coli rpoH mutants. The nt sequence of the gene has been determined and the deduced aa sequence is more than 80% homologous to the E. coli rpoH gene product. Downstream of the V. cholerae rpoH gene, an unidentified dehydrogenase gene (udhA) is present on the opposite strand facing rpoH. The predicted secondary structure of the 5'-proximal region of V. cholerae rpoH mRNA is apparently different from the conserved secondary structures of the rpoH mRNA reported for several bacterial species. The 'RpoH box', a stretch of 9 aa (QRKLFFNLR) unique to sigma 32 factors, and the 'downstream box' sequence complementary to a part of the 16S rRNA, have been detected.
