Cercosporin, a photosensitizing perylenequinone toxin produced by the plant pathogenic Cercospora fungi, generates the highly toxic singlet oxygen (1O2) upon exposure to light. Cercosporin shows broad toxicity against a wide range of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals; however, Cercospora fungi are resistant to its effects. A novel gene, crg1 (cercosporin-resistance gene) was isolated from a wild-type strain of C. nicotianae by genetic complementation of a C. nicotianae mutant (CS10) which is cercosporin sensitive and down-regulated in cercosporin production. Sequence analysis indicated that crg1 encodes a putative protein of 550 amino acids with four putative transmembrane helical regions, however CRG1 shows no strong similarity to any other protein in sequence databases. Northern analysis identified two transcripts (4.5 and 2.6 kb) that are unaffected by the presence of light or cercosporin. Southern analysis demonstrated that crg1 is present in a single copy in the C. nicotianae genome and can be detected only in Cercospora species. Targeted disruption of crg1 resulted in mutants that, like CS10, are sensitive to cercosporin. However, unlike CS10, crg1 disruption mutants are not down-regulated in toxin production. Both CS10 and the crg1 disruption mutants are unaffected in their response to other 1O2-generating photosensitizers, suggesting that CRG1 functions specifically against cercosporin, rather than against 1O2.
