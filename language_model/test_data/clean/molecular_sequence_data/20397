Bacteriocin-producing lactococci were isolated from raw ewes' milk samples obtained from 5 different Protected Designation of Origin Zamorano cheese manufacturers. Thirteen isolates with antimicrobial activity against Lactococcus lactis HP were selected. Eleven were identified by a PCR technique as L. lactis ssp. lactis and 2 were identified as L. lactis ssp. cremoris. They were grouped under 4 different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. The presence of structural genes of both nisin and lacticin 481 was detected in 10 L. lactis ssp. lactis isolates belonging to 2 different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. Coproduction of nisin and lacticin 481 was confirmed after semipurification by using selective indicators. The production of 2 bacteriocins by the same strain is an uncommon property, with relevance in food safety. Nisin and lacticin 481 L. lactis-producing strains might be used as adjunct cultures to the commercial starter in the manufacture of dairy products.
