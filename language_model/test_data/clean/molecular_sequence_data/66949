This paper discusses the diversity of synovial sarcomas (SSs) [biphasic (BSS), monophasic fibrous (MFSS), and poorly differentiated (PDSS)] and tissue microarray (TMA) evaluation of the immunophenotypic and histological progression of SSs in nude mice using three TMAs comprising 11 primary SSs (8 MFSSs, 2 BSSs, and 1 PDSS) and their xenografts. BSS and MFSS progressively transformed to a similar undifferentiated phenotype with loss of glandular component in the xenografts. Epidermal growth factor receptor and SALL2 were expressed in primary tumors and xenografts. Enhanced bcl-2 and bax expression were noted in xenografts. Ki-67 overexpression in xenografts correlated with high mitotic index. Epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and cytokeratin AE1/AE3 were detected in all original and xenografted SSs. Hierarchical clustering differentiated original MFSS and BSS, but their xenografts clustered together due to similar immunoexpression profile. Our study demonstrates definite phenotypic variability of BSS and MFSS in the xenografts. Differences in immunoexpression for various markers existed between primary tumor and xenografts but not between subtypes. Hierarchical clustering grouped TMA immunostaining data and confirmed immunophenotypic variability; however, it failed to reveal any immunophenotypic differences between SYT-SSX1 and SYT-SSX2 type tumors. Nonetheless, reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction detected SYT-SSX transcripts in all primary SSs and their xenografts, thereby demonstrating their genetic stability.
