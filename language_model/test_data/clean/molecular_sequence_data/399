Here we identify the release of annexin A2 into the culture medium in response to low-dose X-radiation exposure and establish functional linkages to an established paracrine factor-mediated anchorage-independent growth response. Using a standard bicameral coculture model, we demonstrate that annexin A2 is secreted into the medium by irradiated cells (seeded in upper chamber) and is capable of binding to nonirradiated neighboring cells (seeded in lower chamber). The paracrine factor-mediated anchorage-independent growth response to low-dose X irradiation is reduced when irradiated annexin A2-silenced (shRNA) JB6 cells are co-cultured with nonirradiated cells relative to co-culture with irradiated annexin A2-competent vector control cells. Consistent with this observation, purified bovine annexin A2 tetramer induces anchorage-independent growth. These observations suggest that annexin A2 regulates, in part, the radiation paracrine factor-specific anchorage-independent growth response in JB6 cells.
