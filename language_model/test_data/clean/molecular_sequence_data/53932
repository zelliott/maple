Translation termination is the final step that completes the synthesis of a polypeptide. Premature translation termination by introduction of a nonsense mutation leads to the synthesis of a truncated protein. We report the identification and characterization of the product of the MTT1 gene, a helicase belonging to the Upfl-like family of helicases that is involved in modulating translation termination. MTT1 is homologous to UPF1, a factor previously shown to function in both mRNA turnover and translation termination. Overexpression of MTT1 induced a nonsense suppression phenotype in a wild-type yeast strain. Nonsense suppression is apparently not due to induction of [PSI+], even though cooverexpression of HSP104 alleviated the nonsense suppression phenotype observed in cells overexpressing MTT1, suggesting a more direct role of Hsp104p in the translation termination process. The MTT1 gene product was shown to interact with translation termination factors and is localized to polysomes. Taken together, these results indicate that at least two members of a family of RNA helicases modulate translation termination efficiency in cells.
