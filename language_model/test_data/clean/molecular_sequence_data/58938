In fission yeast, regulation of p34cdc2 plays an important role in the checkpoint coupling mitosis to completion of DNA replication. The cdc2 mutations cdc2-3w (C67Y) and cdc2-4w (C67F) abolish checkpoint control without seriously affecting normal cell proliferation. However the molecular basis of this phenotype is not known. To better understand the role of p34cdc2 in checkpoint control, we have screened for more mutations in Schizosaccharomyces pombe cdc2 with this phenotype. We have isolated cdc2-3w and cdc2-4w, as well as three new cdc2 alleles: cdc2-6w (N66I), cdc2-7w (E8V) and cdc2-8w (K9E). The altered residues map to two different regions on opposite faces of the protein, suggesting that the interaction between p34cdc2 and components of the checkpoint pathway may be complex. In contrast to cdc2-3w and cdc2-4w, the new mutations alter residues that are conserved between the fission yeast cdc2+ and other cdks, including the human CDC2 protein. Expression of the equivalent human CDC2 mutants in fission yeast abolishes checkpoint control, suggesting that these residues could be involved in checkpoint-dependent regulation of other eukaryotic cdks.
