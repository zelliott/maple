The Brevibacterium acetylicum gsk gene, which encodes guanosine kinase (ATP:guanosine 5'-phosphotransferase), a kinase that is involved in guanosine salvage pathways, has been cloned by using the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein. The cloned chromosomal fragment containing the gsk gene was sequenced and shown to encode a polypeptide of 303 amino acids with a molecular mass of 32,536 Da, which is in good agreement with the measured molecular weight of the purified enzyme. Recombinant Escherichia coli strains harboring plasmids carrying the B. acetylicum gsk gene overexpressed both guanosine and inosine kinase activities. The primary structure of the gsk gene shows similarity to amino acid sequences of sugar kinases classified in the ribokinase family stronger than to those of the E. coli gsk gene encoding guanosine kinase and other nucleoside kinases. Northern blot analysis and primer extension analysis revealed a 1.4-kb transcript and promoter sequences, like the E. coli sigma70 and B. subtilis sigmaA consensus sequences, respectively. These results, together with the nucleotide sequence of the downstream region of gsk, suggested that the organization of B. acetylicum gsk is bicistronic. The second gene, orf2, shows significant similarity to the mutT mutator genes of several organisms, although its function has not yet been identified. The gsk gene was specifically transcribed in the early exponential growth phase, which seems to correspond to the specific guanosine kinase activity profile and suggests a role in controlling the nucleoside monophosphate level by efficiently recycling guanosine when cells are in the early exponential phase.
