When the genome organizations of 30 native isolates belonging to a wine spoilage yeast, Dekkera (Brettanomyces) bruxellensis, a distant relative of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were examined, the numbers of chromosomes varied drastically, from 4 to at least 9. When single gene probes were used in Southern analysis, the corresponding genes usually mapped to at least two chromosomal bands, excluding a simple haploid organization of the genome. When different loci were sequenced, in most cases, several different haplotypes were obtained for each single isolate, and they belonged to two subtypes. Phylogenetic reconstruction using haplotypes revealed that the sequences from different isolates belonging to one subtype were more similar to each other than to the sequences belonging to the other subtype within the isolate. Reanalysis of the genome sequence also confirmed that partially sequenced strain Y879 is not a simple haploid and that its genome contains approximately 1% polymorphic sites. The present situation could be explained by (i) a hybridization event where two similar but different genomes have recently fused together or (ii) an event where the diploid progenitor of all analyzed strains lost a regular sexual cycle, and the genome started to accumulate mutations.
