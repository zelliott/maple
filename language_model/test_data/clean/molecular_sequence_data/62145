Two regulatory genes, acpA and atxA, have been reported to control expression of the Bacillus anthracis capsule biosynthesis operon capBCAD. The atxA gene is located on the virulence plasmid pXO1, while pXO2 carries acpA and the cap genes. acpA has been viewed as the major regulator of the cap operon because it is essential for capsule gene expression in a pXO1(-) pXO2(+) strain. atxA is essential for toxin gene transcription but has also been implicated in control of the cap genes. The molecular functions of the regulatory proteins are unknown. We examined cap gene expression in a genetically complete pXO1(+) pXO2(+) strain. Our results indicate that another pXO2 gene, acpB (previously called pXO2-53; accession no. NC002146.1:49418-50866), has a role in cap expression. The predicted amino acid sequence of AcpB is 62% similar to that of AcpA and 50% similar to that of AtxA. Assessment of cap gene transcription revealed that cap expression was not affected in a pXO1(+) pXO2(+) acpB-null mutant and was slightly reduced in an isogenic acpA mutant. However, cap gene expression was abolished in an acpA acpB double mutant. Microscopic examination of capsule synthesis by the mutants corroborated these findings. acpA and acpB expression is controlled by atxA; capsule synthesis and transcription of acpA and acpB were markedly reduced in an atxA mutant. The data suggest that, in a strain containing both virulence plasmids, atxA is the major regulator of capsule synthesis and controls capBCAD expression indirectly, via positive regulation of acpA and acpB.
