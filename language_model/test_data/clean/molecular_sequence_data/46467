The expression of the recombinant diphtheria toxin mutant CRM197 in bacteria other than Corynebacterium diphtheriae has proven to be difficult. Here we propose a new and alternative procedure for the production of full-length CRM197 in Escherichia coli. The present study relates specifically to the expression of an artificial sequence and to a method for the isolation and purification of the corresponding protein. In particular, a synthetic gene coding for CRM197, bearing a short histidine tag and optimized for E. coli codon usage, was cloned in the pET9a vector. Accordingly, the over-expression of the protein was simply induced with arabinose in E. coli BL21AI. The recombinant protein was insoluble and always found inside protein aggregates, which were solubilised using urea. Surprisingly, the expression of CRM197, devoid of the short tag, always failed. Following a refolding step, the his-tagged CRM197 was purified by affinity and gel-filtration chromatography and the purity of the final preparation reached 95%. Interestingly, the recombinant protein features DNase activity, indicating that the presence of the tag is not affecting its biochemical properties. However, the removal of the synthetic tag could be easily obtained by incubating the target protein with a proper quantity of a commercial enterokinase.
