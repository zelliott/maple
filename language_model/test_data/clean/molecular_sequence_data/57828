The ant(4')-IIa gene was previously cloned from Pseudomonas aeruginosa on a 1.6-kb DNA fragment (G. A. Jacoby, M. J. Blaser, P. Santanam, H. HÃ¤chler, F. H. Kayser, R. S. Hare, and G. H. Miller, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 34:2381-2386, 1990). In the current study, the ant(4')-IIa gene was localized by gamma-delta mutagenesis. A region of approximately 600 nucleotides which contained the ant(4')-IIa gene was identified, and DNA sequence analysis revealed two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) within this region. Northern (RNA) blot analysis demonstrated expression of both ORFs in P. aeruginosa; therefore, site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify the ORF which encodes the ant(4')-IIa gene. No homology was found between ant(4')-IIa and ant(4')-Ia DNA sequences. Hybridization experiments confirmed that the ant(4')-Ia probe hybridized only to gram-positive presumptive ANT(4')-I strains and that the ant(4')-IIa probe hybridized only to gram-negative strains presumed to carry ANT(4')-II. Seven gram-negative strains which had been classified as having ANT(4')-II resistance profiles did not hybridize with probes for either ant(4')-Ia or ant(4')-IIa, suggesting that at least one additional ant(4') gene may exist. The predicted amino-terminal sequences of the ANT(4')-Ia and ANT(4')-IIa proteins showed significant sequence similarity between residues 38 and 63 of the ANT(4')-Ia protein and residues 26 and 51 of the ANT(4')-IIa protein.
