Serogroups O2 and O3 of Serratia marcescens are differentiated by acidic glycans present in the aqueous phase when lipopolysaccharides are extracted from the reference strains by the aqueous-phenol method. The phenolic phases of these extracts from both strains also contain lipopolysaccharides, from which the same neutral glycan is released on milk acid hydrolysis. The neutral glycan has the disaccharide repeating-unit shown, and accounts for the cross-reactions between the two serogroups and also with serogroup O21: --> 4)-alpha-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->4)-beta-D-ManpNAc-(1--.
