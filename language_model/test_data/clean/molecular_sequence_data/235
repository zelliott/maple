The placement of 'Pseudomonas butanovora' in the genus Thauera was proposed previously, based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, upon further studies of taxonomical characteristics. In this study, physiological characteristics and DNA-DNA reassociation data are presented and the transfer of 'P. butanovora' to the genus Thauera is proposed. The original description of the strain (strain Bu-B1211) indicated that it was capable of denitrification but not anaerobic growth. 'P. butanovora' is capable of anaerobic respiration and growth, utilizing nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor during the oxidation of organic acids and alcohols, but not aromatic hydrocarbons or open-chain terpenoids. The total fatty acid composition supported the assignment of strain Bu-B1211 to the Betaproteobacteria and resembled that of members of the genus Thauera. The combination of 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic evidence, physiological and taxonomical characteristics and DNA-DNA reassociation data supported the placement of 'Pseudomonas butanovora' Bu-B1211 in the genus Thauera as representing a novel species, for which the name Thauera butanivorans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is Bu-B1211(T) (=IAM 12574(T)=ATCC 43655(T)=DSM 2080(T)).
