We present here the sequence analysis of a DNA fragment (cosmid pUOA1258) located on the right arm of chromosome XV. The 22,956 bp sequence reveals 14 open reading frames (ORFs) longer than 300 bp and the 201 bp RPS33 gene. Among the 14 large ORFs, two overlapping frames are likely to be non-expressed and one corresponds to the known GLN4 gene encoding glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase. Two ORFs, O3571 and O3620, encode putative transcriptional regulators with a Zn(2)-Cys(6) DNA binding domain characteristic of members of the GAL4 family. Among the nine remaining ORFs, five (O3568, O3575, O3590, O3615 and O3625) present significant similarity to proteins of unknown function and four (O3580, O3595, O3630 and O3635) lack homology to sequences present in the databases screened.
