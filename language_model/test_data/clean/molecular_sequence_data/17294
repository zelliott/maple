Single-chain antibodies (scFv) recognizing the VP8* fraction of rotavirus outer capsid and blocking rotavirus infection in vitro were isolated by phage display. Vectors for the extracellular expression in Lactobacillus casei of one of the scFv were constructed. L. casei was able to secrete active scFv to the growth medium, showing the potential of probiotic bacteria to be engineered to express molecules suitable for in vivo antirotavirus therapies.
