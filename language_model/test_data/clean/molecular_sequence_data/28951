Parasin I is a potent 19-residue antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin mucus of wounded catfish (Parasilurus asotus). Here we describe the mechanism of parasin I production from histone H2A in catfish skin mucosa on epidermal injury. Cathepsin D is found to exist in the mucus as an inactive proenzyme (procathepsin D), and a metalloprotease, induced on injury, cleaves procathepsin D to generate active cathepsin D. This activated form of cathepsin D then cleaves the Ser19-Arg20 bond of histone H2A to produce parasin I. Immunohistochemical analysis reveals that unacetylated histone H2A, a precursor of parasin I, and procathepsin D are present in the cytoplasm of epithelial mucous cells and that parasin I is produced on the mucosal surface on epidermal injury. Western blot analysis shows that parasin I is also present in the skin mucus of other fish species. Furthermore, parasin I shows good antimicrobial activity against fish-specific bacterial pathogens. Taken together, these results indicate that cathepsin D and a metalloprotease participate in the production of parasin I from histone H2A and that parasin I contributes to the innate host defense of the fish against invading microorganisms.
