To investigate the tissue distribution of the GLUT3 glucose transporter isoform in human tissue we produced affinity purified antibodies to the COOH terminus of the human GLUT3. Both antibodies recognize a specific GLUT3 band in oocytes injected with GLUT3 mRNA but not in those injected with H2O or GLUT1, 2, 4, 5 mRNA. This immunoreactive band in GLUT3 injected oocytes is photolabelled by cytochalasin-B in the presence of L- but not D-glucose indicating that it is a glucose transporter. A high cross reactivity between the human GLUT3 antibodies and a 43 kDa cytoskeletal actin band was identified in all oocyte lysates and many human tissues. However, the specific GLUT3 band could be distinguished from the actin band by carbonate treatment which preferentially solubilized the actin band. Using these antibodies we show that GLUT3 is present as a 45-48 kDa protein in human brain with lower levels detectable in heart, placenta, liver and a barely detectable level in kidney. No GLUT3 was detected in membranes from any of 3 skeletal muscle groups investigated. We conclude that a major role of GLUT3 in humans is as the brain neuronal glucose transporter.
