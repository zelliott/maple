Phylogenetic relationships within the Grimmiaceae/Ptychomitriaceae were studied using a plastid tRNA cluster, including four tRNAs (trnS, trnT, trnL, trnF), a fast evolving gene (rps4), four spacers separating the coding regions, as well as one group I intron. Secondary structure analyses of the spacers as well as the trnL intron P8 domain identified several homoplastic inversions. Tracing the structural evolution of P8 we were able to identify lineage specific modifications that are mainly explained by inversions often in combination with large indel events. Phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods indicate that Jaffueliobryum and Indusiella are closely related to Ptychomitrium and form the Ptychomitriaceae s. str. As Campylostelium is neither resolved within Ptychomitriaceae s. str. nor Grimmiaceae s. str., we prefer to treat it in its own family, Campylosteliaceae De Not. The systematic position of Glyphomitrium, as also found by other authors, should be considered in a broader analysis of haplolepidous mosses as our analyses indicate that it is not part of Campylosteliaceae, Grimmiaceae, or Ptychomitriaceae. Within Grimmiaceae s. str., Racomitrium is recognized as a monophyletic group sister to a clade including Dryptodon, Grimmia, and Schistidium. Coscinodon species appear disperse in Grimmia s. str. next to species sharing the same gametophyte morphology, and thus the genus is synonymized with Grimmia. Finally, Schistidium is resolved monophyletic with high statistical support, and seems to represent a rapidly evolving group of species. Our results are not fully congruent with recently published treatments splitting Grimmiaceae in a fairly high number of genera, neither with a comprehensive Grimmia including Dryptodon and Grimmia s. str.
