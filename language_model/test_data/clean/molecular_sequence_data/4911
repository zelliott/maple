The hepatitis G virus (HGV) is a newly described flavivirus that affects a high proportion of patients with chronic viral hepatitis: our objective was to determine what role HGV might play in the course of disease.

We evaluated stored serum samples from 108 patients with chronic hepatitis B and 99 patients with chronic hepatitis C who participated in trials of alpha-interferon or ribavirin for the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA by branched DNA and for the presence of HGV RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using primers from the NS5 region of the genome.

Initially, 20 (19%) patients with hepatitis B and 11 (11%) with hepatitis C had HGV RNA in their serum. Patients with and without HGV infection were similar with regard to clinical features, laboratory tests, and hepatic histology. HGV RNA levels fell during interferon therapy and became undetectable in those receiving the highest doses; however, HGV RNA levels returned to pretreatment values when therapy was stopped. With ribavirin therapy, HGV RNA levels did not change. Two- to 12-yr follow-up serum samples were available from 17 initially HGV RNA-positive patients, of whom only 10 (59%) were still positive.

HGV infection is common among patients with chronic hepatitis B and C but has little effect on the short-term course of disease or response to therapy. HGV RNA levels are suppressed but not eradicated by alpha-interferon and are unaffected by ribavirin treatment. Spontaneous loss of HGV RNA occurs over time in a proportion of patients.
