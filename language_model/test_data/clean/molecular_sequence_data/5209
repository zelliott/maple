Recently, oligoclonal T cell accumulation has been reported in affected joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. To characterize such clonally accumulating T cells, we quantitatively monitored their frequency by analyzing TCR B chains. As a result, despite a similar TCR BV usage between synovial fluid (SF) and PBL, obviously skewed TCR BJ usage was detected in SF. Subsequent DNA sequencing demonstrated that the skewed BJ gene usage in SF resulted from clonal T cell accumulation. The complementarity-determining region 3 of TCR B chains of the detected clones appeared to have homologous amino acid sequences. Further, one of the predominant TCR B chains of the clones was identical with that reported previously. In the follow-up study, most of the accumulated clones persisted; however, in some, proportions were drastically decreased or increased during the time course. In particular, one of the clones expanded sixfold, from 11 to 67%, in the BV8-BJ2S3 TCR population of SF, even though the clone was not detected in PBL. In summary, oligoclonal T cell accumulation in SF was persistent, but it appeared to fluctuate independently of the clonality in PBL. The expansion of the clones in SF may occur by antigenic stimuli within the joint.
