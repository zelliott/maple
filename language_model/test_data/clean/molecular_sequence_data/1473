Datronia caperata, a basidiomycete fungus, is one of the dominant polypore species found in neotropical mangrove forest fragments, where it is locally specialized on Laguncularia racemosa. We examined the genetic structure of D. caperata populations from four Panamanian mangrove forests using AFLP markers. Using five primer pair combinations, 145 loci were detected, 98.6% of which were polymorphic. Each of the populations showed a high degree of genetic diversity (Nei's h ranging from 0.146 to 0.223). Results from minimum spanning trees and Mantel tests showed little evidence for small-scale spatial structure within sites. A significant amount of total genetic variation was partitioned among populations (phi(ST) = 0.21) separated by 10s to 100s of km, a considerably greater amount than has been detected in other mushroom and wood-decaying fungi sampled at equal or greater geographic distances. These results suggest that despite production of copious basidiospores capable of long distance dispersal, some homobasidiomycete fungi may be susceptible to genetic isolation due to habitat fragmentation.
