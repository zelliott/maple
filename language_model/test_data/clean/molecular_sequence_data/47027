Temporal reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) expression analyses were performed on Trprx2, a new white clover peroxidase, with roots challenged with homologous rhizobia, heterologous rhizobia, and a pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae. Low levels of Trprx2 expression were evident in all rhizobial treatments but in P.syringae-treated clover background expression was dramatically reduced within 1 h and was undetectable in treatments inoculated for more than 3 h. Spraying 4 mM salicylic acid onto seedlings increased Trprx2 expression. These data suggest a defensive role for Trprx2 in white clover and indicate active defense suppression by the pathogen.
