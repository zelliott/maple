The amino acid sequences of ferredoxin isoproteins (Fd A and Fd B) from Alocasia macrorrhiza Schott in Papua New Guinea were determined. They consisted of single polypeptide chains of 97 and 98 residues, respectively, and both Fds had a molecular mass of 10,800 Da. There was an 88% identity between the sequences of the isoproteins (Fd A and Fd B). These sequences were compared with those of the closely related plant Fds and their phylogenetic relationships are discussed.
