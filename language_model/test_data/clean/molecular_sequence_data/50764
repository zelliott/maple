The human pim-1 proto-oncogene was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-fusion protein and the enzymatic properties of its kinase activity were characterized. Likewise, a Pim-1 mutant lacking intrinsic kinase activity was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (Lys67 to Met) and expressed in E. coli. In vitro assays with the mutant Pim-1 kinase showed no contaminating kinase activity. The wild-type Pim-1 kinase-GST fusion protein showed a pH optimum of 7 to 7.5 and optimal activity was observed at either 10 mM MgCl2 or 5 mM MnCl2. Higher cation concentrations were inhibitory, as was the addition of NaCl to the assays. Previous work by this laboratory assaying several proteins and peptides showed histone H1 and the peptide Kemptide to be efficiently phosphorylated by recombinant Pim-1 kinase. Here we examine the substrate sequence specificity of Pim-1 kinase in detail. Comparison of different synthetic peptide substrates showed Pim-1 to have a strong substrate preference for the peptide Lys-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser*-Gly-Pro with an almost sixfold higher specificity constant kcat/Km over that of the substrate Kemptide (Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser*-Leu-Gly). The presence of basic amino acid residues on the amino terminal side of the target Ser/Thr was shown to be essential for peptide substrate recognition. Furthermore, phosphopeptide analysis of calf thymus histone H1 phosphorylated in vitro by Pim-1 kinase resulted in fragments containing sequences similar to that of the preferred synthetic substrate peptide shown above. Therefore, under optimized in vitro conditions, the substrate recognition sequence for Pim-1 kinase is (Arg/Lys)3-X-Ser/Thr*-X', where X' is likely neither a basic nor a large hydrophobic residue.
