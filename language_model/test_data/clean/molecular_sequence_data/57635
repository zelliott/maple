The MAK3 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes an N-acetyltransferase whose acetylation of the N terminus of the L-A double-stranded RNA virus major coat protein (gag) is necessary for viral assembly. We show that the first 4 amino acids of the L-A gag protein sequence, MLRF, are a portable signal for N-terminal acetylation by MAK3. Amino acids 2, 3, and 4 are each important for acetylation by the MAK3 enzyme. In yeast cells, only three mitochondrial proteins are known to have the MAK3 acetylation signal, suggesting an explanation for the slow growth of mak3 mutants on nonfermentable carbon sources.
