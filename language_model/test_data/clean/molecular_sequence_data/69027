On the basis of spectroscopic and chemical methods, the structures of two new bisdesmosidic triterpenoid glycosides, named staunoside D and E, which were isolated from Stauntonia hexaphylla, were established as 3-O-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->2)-[beta-D- glucopyranosyl(1-->3)]-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-hederagenin-28- O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl (1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl] ester and 28-O-[alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl (1-->4)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl]ester, respectively. Three known triterpenoid glycosides were also isolated. A new proglycoside was isolated from the cleavage of the ester-glycosidic linkage and its structure characterized.
