The nucleotide sequences of the open reading frames of cDNAs for selenoprotein W from skeletal muscle of rat, mouse, sheep, rhesus monkey and human are reported. Theoretical translation of the coding sequences indicated highly similar proteins of 88 (mouse and rat) or 87 (human, monkey and sheep) amino acids. In 73 of 88 positions the specified amino acids are identical for all five proteins. TGA encoding selenocysteine is the 13th codon of all the cDNAs. The mouse, rat and sheep open reading frames terminate with TGA but the human and rhesus monkey coding regions terminate with TAA. The encoded amino acid sequences are identical for the rat and mouse proteins, and for the human and monkey proteins. The similarity of the cDNAs continues in the 3' noncoding regions through the putative selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) elements which are required for correct interpretation of the selenocysteine codon. The region between the SECIS elements and the polyadenylation signals showed much lower similarity. The cloned rat gene for selenoprotein W is 5000 bases long, with the 663 bases of the cDNA in six exons. The transcription start site was identified by nuclease protection assay to be 16 bases upstream of the longest cDNA clone. A canonical TATA box occurs 150 bases upstream, but the assay did not indicate the presence of longer mRNAs.
