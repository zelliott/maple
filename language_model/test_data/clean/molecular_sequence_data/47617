A new peptaibol, boletusin, was isolated from the methanol extract of the fruiting body of the mushroom, Boletus spp. Sequential determination by positive FAB MS/MS showed that boletusin is a peptide consisting of 19 amino acids, with one acetylated N-terminus residue, phenylalanine, and a C-terminal amino alcohol, tryptophanol. This peptide showed antimicrobial activity against several Gram-positive bacteria.
