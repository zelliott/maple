SUP35 and SUP45 encode translational release factors in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, Sup35p is related to the cytoplasmically inherited prion-like phenotype [PSI+]. The vital cellular role of Sup35p and Sup45p prompted us to study the regulation of transcription of the corresponding genes. Since the [PSI] state of the yeast strain affects the abundance of Sup35p and Sup45p, both [PSI+] and [psi-] variants were included in these analyses. It turned out that SUP35 and SUP45 transcript levels are regulated by nutritional changes and stress in a way strikingly similar to those of ribosomal protein genes. The [PSI] state did not influence the respective transcript levels nor their regulation, although HSP12 (as a monitor of general stress-responsive) gene expression appeared to differ in the two variant strains. The transcription activation sites of SUP35 and SUP45 were mapped using deletion analysis of the respective promoter-reporter fusion genes. The UAS in both cases was found to consist of an Abf1p-site and a T-rich element. Also in this respect SUP35 and SUP45 show a notable resemblance with ribosomal protein genes. Evidence was found that SUP35 in addition harbors a potential internal promoter element which became active after progressive 5'-deletion removing the first of the three in-frame ATGs.
