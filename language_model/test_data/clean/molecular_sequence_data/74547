Triculine (Gastropoda: Rissooidea: Pomatiopsidae) snails are involved in the transmission of schistosomiasis and paragonimiasis; their distributions are mainly across southeastern Asia and southern China. In the present investigation, partial sequences of COI, 16S, and 28S were examined to infer the phylogenetic relationships among the species rich and poorly understood gastropod. Samples were collected from 12 geographic locations in six provinces of southern China. Several methods such as maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and distance analysis were used in phylogenetic analyses among these taxa. The resultant phylogenetic trees showed a similar topology irrespective of the phylogenetic methods used. The taxa fell into two clades, with those from Fujian, Guangxi, and Zhejiang Provinces in one clade and those from Hunan, Sichuan and Hubei in the other. Among the taxa in Hubei Province, five formed a monophyletic clade, but Tricula sp. H-SHY fell into a sister clade of Tricula hortensis of Sichuan, whilst Tricula hongshanensis formed a single clade. Sister taxa Tricula pingi and Tricula hsiangi formed well-supported clade within almost all the trees. These results, while preliminary, represent the first attempt to reconstruct a phylogeny for Triculinae across China.
