The loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a well-developed method for replicating a targeted DNA sequence with a high specificity, but multiplex LAMP detection is difficult because LAMP amplicons are very complicated in structure. To allow simultaneous detection of multiple LAMP products, a series of target-specific barcodes were designed and tagged in LAMP amplicons by FIP primers. The targeted barcodes were decoded by pyrosequencing on nicked LAMP amplicons. To enable the nicking reaction to occur just near the barcode regions, the recognition sequence of the nicking endonuclease (NEase) was also introduced into the FIP primer. After the nicking reaction, pyrosequencing started at the nicked 3' end when the added deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) was complementary to the non-nicked strand. To efficiently encode multiple targets, the barcodes were designed with a reporter base and two stuffer bases, so that the decoding of a target-specific barcode only required a single peak in a pyrogram. We have successfully detected the four kinds of pathogens including hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and Treponema pallidum (TP), which are easily infected in blood, by a 4-plex LAMP in a single tube, indicating that barcoded LAMP coupled with NEase-mediated pyrosequencing is a simple, rapid, and reliable way in multiple target identification.
