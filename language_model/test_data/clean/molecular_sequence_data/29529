ARF-related protein 1 (ARFRP1) is a membrane-associated GTPase which inhibits the ARF/Sec7-dependent activation of phospholipase D. We have recently shown that deletion of Arfrp1 in mice results in increased apoptosis of mesodermal cells during gastrulation, leading to early embryonic lethality. Here we describe the organization of the Arfrp1 gene and of its promoter region. The Arfrp1 gene spans approximately 7 kb and contains 8 exons. The proximal 5'-flanking regions of mouse and human ARFRP1 lack a TATA box and a CAAT box, are highly GC-rich and contain potential transcription factor binding sites. Interestingly, sequence analysis of human ARFRP1 showed its 5'-flanking region contains the first exon of another gene (DJ583P15.3 in the ensembl data base; www.ensembl.org) on the opposite strand. Promoter analysis revealed that the intergenic region between both genes (54 bp) exhibits bidirectional promoter activity. However, deletion analysis demonstrated that transcription of both genes is regulated by different cis-elements. Mutational analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that two short cRel- and cEts1-like elements in the 5'-flanking region of Arfrp1 (-76 to -53 and -45 to -23) are critical for the regulation of Arfrp1 expression.
