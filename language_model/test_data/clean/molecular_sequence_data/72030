The maturation of stratified squamous epithelium of the upper gastrointestinal tract is a highly ordered process of development and differentiation. Information on the molecular basis of this process is, however, limited. Here we report the identification of the first murine forestomach regulatory element using the murine adenosine deaminase (Ada) gene as a model. In the adult mouse, Ada is highly expressed in the terminally differentiated epithelial layer of upper gastrointestinal tract tissues. The data reported here represent the identification and detailed analysis of a 1. 1-kilobase (kb) sequence located 3.4-kb upstream of the transcription initiation site of the murine Ada gene, which is sufficient to target cat reporter gene expression to the forestomach in transgenic mice. This 1.1-kb fragment is capable of directing cat reporter gene expression mainly to the forestomach of transgenic mice, with a level comparable to the endogenous Ada gene. This expression is localized to the appropriate cell types, confers copy number dependence, and shows the same developmental regulation. Mutational analysis revealed the functional importance of multiple transcription factor-binding sites.
