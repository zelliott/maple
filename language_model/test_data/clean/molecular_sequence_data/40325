Mungbean (Vigna radiata L. cv. Tainan no. 5) starch branching enzyme I (SBE, EC 2.4.1.18) cDNA, VrsbeI, was cloned, and its expression was characterized. Conserved regions of the family B SBE were used to amplify a full length cDNA of 2208 bp. Phylogeny was analyzed, and the partial 3D structure and functional features were predicted. Catalytic residues were identified in the (α/β)(8)-fold, and a unique loop from F365 to F376 between β3/α3 was located. Gene expression of VrsbeI in seeds during growth showed that the transcript appeared from week 1 and increased substantially at week 3-4. It was cloned into the pET30 vector and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells as a soluble recombinant protein. The affinity-purified recombinant VrSBEI exhibited a specific activity of 314.6 U/mg as an active enzyme with 114-fold activity enrichment from the crude extract.
