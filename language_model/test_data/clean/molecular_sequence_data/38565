Two covalently linked proteins, Kell and XK, constitute the Kell blood group system. Kell, a 93-Kd type II glycoprotein, is highly polymorphic and carries all but 1 of the known Kell antigens, and XK, which traverses the membrane 10 times, carries a single antigen, the ubiquitous Kx. The Kell/XK complex is not limited to erythroid tissues and may have multiple physiological roles. Absence of one of the component proteins, XK, is associated with abnormal red cell morphology and late-onset forms of nerve and muscle abnormalities, whereas the other protein component, Kell, is an enzyme whose principal known function is the production of a potent bioactive peptide, ET-3.
