The study of age changes of amidolytic activity of Vipera berus venom is investigated using mixtures of chromogenic peptide substrates differing by detected groups. Quantities of venom (total protein content) and its proteolytic activity from snakes of different ages were compared. The venom composition of newly born adders was shown to be considerably different from the venom composition of young (12-month) adders of the same population. The next evolution of protease activity is weakly expressed.
