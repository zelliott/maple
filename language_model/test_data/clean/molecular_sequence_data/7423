The transcription factor GATA-3 contributes to the expression of several genes critical for T-cell function and development, including the T-cell receptor alpha and beta chains. We report here the isolation of a human cDNA clone which encodes a 3' segment of a novel protein with three zinc fingers. This protein, which we termed G3B, can interact with GATA-3 in vitro. Its mRNA is expressed in T and B cells. Thus, G3B may represent a potential regulator of GATA-3 function.
