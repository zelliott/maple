An extensive analysis of genomic DNA preparations from a number of normal and malignant tissues revealed BglII site polymorphism of the human p53 gene. Approximately 10% of p53 gene alleles were found to contain an additional BglII site localized in a region of intron I. This allelic form of p53 gene was also responsible for p53 protein having altered electrophoretic mobility. Molecular cloning and sequencing of both the alleles of p53 gene revealed a base-pair change in codon 72 causing arginine----proline substitution in the allele with the additional BglII site. Both variants of the p53 gene may occur in homozygous state and are therefore functional.
