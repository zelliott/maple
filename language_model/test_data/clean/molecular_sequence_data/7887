The ability of the Hex generalized mismatch repair system to prevent recombination between partially divergent (also called homeologous) sequences during transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated. By using as donor in transformation cloned fragments 1.7-17.5% divergent in DNA sequence from the recipient, it was observed that the Hex system prevents chromosomal integration of the least and the most divergent fragments but frequently fails to do so for other fragments. In the latter case, the Hex system becomes saturated (inhibited) due to an excess of mismatches: it is unable to repair a single mismatch located elsewhere on the chromosome. Further investigation with chromosomal donor DNA, carrying only one genetically marked divergent region, revealed that a single divergent fragment can lead to saturation of the Hex system. Increase in cellular concentration of either HexA, the MutS homologue that binds mismatches, or HexB, the MutL homologue for which the essential role in repair as yet remains obscure, was shown to restore repair ability in previously saturating conditions. Investigation of heterospecific transformation by chromosomal DNA from two related streptococcal species, Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus mitis, also revealed complete saturation of the Hex system. Therefore the Hex system is not a barrier to interspecies recombination in S. pneumoniae. These results are discussed in light of those described for the Mut system of Escherichia coli.
