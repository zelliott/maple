The MMTV promoter contains a complex hormone responsive region (HRR) upstream of a binding site for the transcription factor nuclear factor I (NFI). Hormonal induction of MMTV expression requires the integrity of both the HRR and the NFI binding site. However, in vitro NFI acts as a basal transcription factor on the MMTV promoter that does not cooperate but rather competes with the hormone receptors in terms of binding to MMTV-DNA. Fragments that contain the HRR and the NFI binding site have been reconstituted into mononucleosomes. Steroid hormone receptors bind efficiently to these nucleosomes, NFI does not. Therefore it has been postulated that the chromatin structure may be responsible for the inability of NFI to bind to the chromosomally organized inactive MMTV promoter. In vivo DNaseI and methidium-propyl-EDTA-Fe(II) (MPE) digestion pattern indicate the presence of a nucleosome covering the HRR and the NFI binding site. Genomic footprinting shows that in vivo the rotational setting of the MMTV promoter DNA in this nucleosome is identical to that previously reported for reconstituted nucleosomes in which the major grooves of the NFI half palindromes are facing towards the histone octamer and appear not to be accessible to NFI. These results indicate that MMTV promoter sequences are determining nucleosome positioning in vivo and supports the concept that rotational positioning of DNA in this nucleosome constitutively represses the MMTV promoter.
