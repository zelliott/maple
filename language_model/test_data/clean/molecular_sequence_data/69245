A cDNA library from dormant potato tubers was screened for extensin (Ext)-like cDNAs (PTEL). The cDNAs recovered were partially sequenced and could be divided into two classes. One class, containing the repeating amino acid (aa) motifs, SPPPPSPKYVYK and SPPPPSPSPPPPYYYK, constitutes the potato counterpart of the tomato Ext-encoding gene previously isolated by Zhou et al. [Plant Mol. Biol. 20 (1992) 5-17]. A full-length cDNA from the second class was fully sequenced. The product of this cDNA has the repetitive sequence and proline-rich composition typical of Ext. Features worthy of note are the signal peptide sequence, which shares close homology with signal sequences of a number of Ext of diverse origin, and the presence of a novel, histidine-rich motif (SPPPHHHHPVYK) repeated within the sequence. Wounding of the potato tuber causes a marked increase in Ext-like mRNAs, although the species induced are not those present in dormant tissue.
