To isolate PQQ biosynthesis gene cluster from Gluconobacter oxydans H24 based on sorbose-dehydrogenase activity.

A library of Gluconobacter oxydans H24 genomic DNA was constructed with host strains Escherichia coli JM109s, which was integrated of sdh gene at the ptsG site on the chromosome of JM109. By detecting sorbose-dehydrogenase activity, clone of PQQ biosynthesis was isolated and subcloned.

A positive clone was isolated from Gluconobacter oxydans H24 genomic DNA library. Within the 5,400-base-pair DNA fragment five reading frames are presented, corresponding to five of the pqq genes (pqqABCDE). The nucleotide and amino acid sequence showed highly homology to pqq genes of other bacteria.

The pqqABCDE gene cluster was successfully isolated from Gluconobacter oxydans H24 by sorbose dehydrogenase activity.
