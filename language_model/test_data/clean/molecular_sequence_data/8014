Colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) causes the activation of STAT1 and STAT3 transcription factors in bone marrow macrophages (BMM), in the macrophage cell line BAC1.2F5, and in fibroblasts that express the wild-type receptor for CSF-1. Fibroblasts expressing a mutant receptor in which the tyrosine 809 is replaced with phenylalanine do not activate STAT proteins in response to CSF-1. The activation of the STAT proteins in BMM is accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2. In fibroblasts, the activation of the STAT proteins is accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 and JAK1. We propose that these JAK kinases are subjected to very rapid phosphorylation in response to CSF-1, followed by rapid dephosphorylation. Furthermore, we propose that kinases other than JAK kinase may be involved in the phosphorylation of the STAT proteins in response to CSF-1.
