The genome of Bartonella bacilliformis was shown to be a single circular DNA molecule of about 1,600 kbp having six NotI, four SfiI, and two CeuI sites. A physical map of the DNA was constructed by contour-clamped homogeneous electric field pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of DNA restriction fragments. rRNA operons, the invasion-associated locus, and a flagellin gene were located on the map by hybridization.
