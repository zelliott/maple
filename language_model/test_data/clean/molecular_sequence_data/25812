A large number of reports have demonstrated the presence of neurohypophysial hormone-like peptides in mammalian pineal glands and an antigonadotropic function has been ascribed to pineal arginine vasotocin (AVT). We have undertaken large scale purification of bovine pineal neurohypophysial hormone-like substances which demonstrate mouse mammary milk-ejection activity (ME-activity) in vitro. Peptides with ME-activity were extracted from more than 5 kg of bovine pineal glands. ME-activity containing peptides were found in both high (Mr approximately 10,000-15,000) and low (Mr approximately 500-1000) Mr species from Sephadex G-25 chromatography of 0.2 N acetic acid extracts. After ultrafiltration in 5% formic acid, the neurohypophysial hormone-like peptides were localized to an ultrafiltration Mr 500-1000 retentate. A homogeneous peptide, which shared an identical retention time (RT) and amino acid sequence with synthetic 8-arginine vasopressin (AVP), was isolated by serial semipreparative high performance liquid chromatography. On the other hand, the non-mammalian nonapeptide AVT was not identified.
