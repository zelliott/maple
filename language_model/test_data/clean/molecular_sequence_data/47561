The presence of myosin in dinoflagellates was tested using an anti-Acanthamoeba castellanii myosin II polyclonal antibody on the heterotrophic dinoflagellate Crypthecodinium cohnii Seligo. Western blots revealed the presence of a unique band of 80 kDa in total protein extracts and after immunoprecipitation. Expression of this 80 kDa protein appeared constant during the different phases of the cell cycle. In protein extracts from various other dinoflagellates, this 80 kDa protein was detected only in the autotrophic species Prorocentrum micans Ehr. Screening of a C. cohnii cDNA expression library with this antibody revealed a cDNA coding for an amino acid sequence without homology in the databases. However, particular regions were detected: - a polyglutamine repeat domain in the N-terminal part of the protein, - four peptide sequences associated with GTP-binding sites, - a sequence with slight homology to the rod tail of Caenorhabditis elegans myosin II, -a sequence with homology to a human kinesin motor domain. Immunocytolocalization performed on C. cohnii thin sections with a polyclonal antibody raised against the recombinant protein showed p80 to be present both within the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. Labelling was widespread in the nucleoplasm and more concentrated at the periphery of the permanently condensed chromosomes. In the cytoplasm, labelling appeared in a punctate region close to the nucleus and in the flagellum. Potential functions of this novel protein are discussed.
