The 5' upstream region of the Chinese hamster polyubiquitin gene CHUB2 was determined, and compared to that of the evolutionarily equivalent polyubiquitin gene UbC of humans. The 5' upstream region of the CHUB2 gene is distinct from that of the UbC gene in containing fewer recognition sequences for binding of transcription factors, which are quite sparsely distributed in this region. It seemed probable that the absence of AP-1 sites in the promoter of the CHUB2 gene was likely to be responsible for the very dissimilar regulation of the two genes by UV light and TPA, despite the fact that these genes are evolutionarily equivalent.
