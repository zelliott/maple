We present an analysis of the evolutionary rates of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I genes of primates and other mammals. Five primate genes were sequenced, and this information was combined with published data from other species. The sequences from simian primates show approximately twofold increases in their nonsynonymous substitution rate compared to those from other primates and other mammals. The species range and the overall magnitude of this rate increase are similar to those previously identified for the cytochrome c oxidase subunit II and cytochrome b genes.
