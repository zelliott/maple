The cDNA sequence encoding rabbit, mouse, and rat extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) predicts that the protein contains five cysteine residues. Human EC-SOD contains an additional cysteine residue and folds into two forms with distinct disulfide bridge patterns. One form is enzymatically active (aEC-SOD), while the other is inactive (iEC-SOD). Due to the lack of the additional cysteine residue rabbit, mouse, and rat EC-SOD are unable to generate an inactive fold identical to human iEC-SOD. The amino acid sequences predict the formation of aEC-SOD only, but other folding variants cannot be ruled out based on the heterogeneity observed for human EC-SOD. To test this, we purified EC-SOD from rabbit plasma and determined the disulfide bridge pattern. The results revealed that the disulfide bridges are homogeneous and identical to human aEC-SOD. Four cysteine residues are involved in two intra-disulfide bonds while the C-terminal cysteine residue forms an intersubunit disulfide bond. No evidence for other folding variants was detected. These findings show that rabbit EC-SOD exists as an enzymatically active form only. The absence of iEC-SOD in rabbits suggests that the structure and aspects of the physiological function of EC-SOD differs significantly between rabbit and humans. This is an important notion to take when using these animals as model systems for oxidative stress.
