We studied two genome regions, VP1 and 3D, of 48 echovirus 30 (E30) isolates from Russia and the new independent states. In VP1, most isolates were similar to European strains reported earlier, and frequent change of circulating subgroups was noticed. We also observed, in 2003-2006, the reemergence of a group of E30 strains with a VP1 region very distant from most modern E30 strains and remotely similar to E30 isolates from the 1960s and the 1970s. A study of the 3D genome region detected multiple recombination events among the studied strains. Recombination presumably occurred every few years, and therefore, the study of a single VP1 genome region cannot accurately describe the phylogenetic history of the virus or predict pathogenetic properties of an isolate. In general, a comparison of the VP1 and 3D genome region phylogenies revealed, in some instances, virtually independent circulation of enterovirus genome fragments on a scale of years.
