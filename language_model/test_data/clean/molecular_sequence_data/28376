No fewer than five peptidase enzymes are disposed on the pulmonary vascular surface and are capable of reacting with peptides (including peptide hormones and pro-hormones) within the intravascular space. The review that follows describes these enzymes and their actions and suggests how the enzymes may be assayed in vivo to improve understanding of pulmonary microvascular functions as well as aspects of endocrinology.
