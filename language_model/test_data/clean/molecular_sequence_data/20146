LPS-induced TNF-alpha factor (LITAF) is a novel transcriptional factor that was first discovered in LPS-stimulated human macrophage cell line THP-1. LITAF can bind to TNF-alpha promoter to regulate its expression. The first scallop LITAF (named as CfLITAF) was cloned from Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri by Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) techniques. The cDNA of CfLITAF was of 1240 bp and consisted of a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 112 bp, a 3' UTR of 678 bp and an open reading frame (ORF) of 450 bp encoding a polypeptide of 149 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 16.08 kDa and theoretical isoelectric point of 6.77. A typical conserved LITAF-domain was identified in CfLITAF by SMART analysis. Homology analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of CfLITAF with other known sequences by using the BLAST program revealed that CfLITAF was homologous to the LITAF from human and rat (Identity = 46%), cattle, horse, mouse and chicken (Identity = 48%), western clawed frog (Identity=42%), and zebrafish (Identity = 50%). The mRNA expression of CfLITAF in different tissues including haemocytes, muscle, mantle, heart, gill and gonad, and the temporal expression in haemocytes challenged by LPS or peptidoglycan (PGN) were measured by Real-time RT-PCR. CfLITAF mRNA transcripts could be detected in all tissues examined and be up-regulated in haemocytes after LPS challenge. No significant changes were observed after PGN stimulation. All these data indicated the existence of LITAF in scallop and also provided clue on the presence of TNF-alpha-like molecules in invertebrates.
