We have isolated the rat bone marrow stromal cell antigen 1-encoding cDNA (BST-1) from a pancreatic islet cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a 319-amino-acid (aa) protein whose aa sequence shows homology with mammalian CD38 (33%), Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclases (33%), as well as mouse (86%) and human (72%) BST-1.
