We have identified and characterized mouse, rat, and human cDNAs that encode a novel secreted protein of 448 amino acids named DANCE (developmental arteries and neural crest epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like). DANCE contains six calcium-binding EGF-like domains, one of which includes an RGD motif. Overexpression studies of recombinant DANCE protein document that DANCE is a secreted 66-kDa protein. DANCE and recently described protein S1-5 comprise a new EGF-like protein family. The human DANCE gene was mapped at chromosome 14q32.1. DANCE mRNA is mainly expressed in heart, ovary, and colon in adult human tissues. Expression profile analysis by in situ hybridization revealed prominent DANCE expression in developing arteries. DANCE is also expressed in neural crest cell derivatives, endocardial cushion tissue, and several other mesenchymal tissues. In adult vessels, DANCE expression is largely diminished but is reinduced in balloon-injured vessels and atherosclerotic lesions, notably in intimal vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells that lose their ability to proliferate in late stage of injury. DANCE protein was shown to promote adhesion of endothelial cells through interaction of integrins and the RGD motif of DANCE. DANCE is thus a novel vascular ligand for integrin receptors and may play a role in vascular development and remodeling.
