The structure of the interphase nucleus is a major area of current interest in cell biology. It is thought likely that the nucleus is organised around some form of structural matrix and that this matrix will play a role in processes as diverse as chromosome replication and the integration of gene expression. However, the structure of the matrix within the nucleus has remained elusive, largely because attempts to define it have been dogged by technical problems arising from the great complexity of this organelle. This situation is now being changed by the application of in situ analysis and of molecular genetic methodologies which are opening up this hitherto intractable field.
