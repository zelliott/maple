The crystal structure of the H. influenzae YfeU protein, was determined at 1.90 A resolution using multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction. YfeU belongs to a very large conserved family of proteins found mainly in bacteria but also in archaea and eukaryota. The protein is a homolog of eukaryotic glucokinase regulator and is predicted to be a sugar phosphate isomerase or aminotransferase. Here we describe the structure of YfeU and discuss the possible function as an etherase possibly involved in peptidoglycan recycling.
