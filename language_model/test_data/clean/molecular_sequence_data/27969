The nerve growth factor-sensitive phosphoprotein from PC12 cells, previously designated Nsp100, has been shown to be elongation factor 2 (EF-2). The criteria used for this identification include: (i) similarity of N-terminal sequence; (ii) phosphorylation by the same kinase; (iii) ADP-ribosylation mediated by diphtheria toxin; (iv) comparable function in cell-free protein synthesis. According to these criteria, Nsp100 and EF-2 are identical and the kinase that phosphorylates Nsp100 in PC12 cells is calcium/calmodulin kinase III.
