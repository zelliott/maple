The plexin family transmembrane proteins are putative receptors for semaphorins, which are implicated in the morphogenesis of animal embryos, including axonal guidance. We have generated and characterized putative null mutants of the C. elegans plexinA gene, plx-1. plx-1 mutants exhibited morphological defects: displacement of ray 1 and discontinuous alae. The epidermal precursors for the affected organs were aberrantly arranged in the mutants, and a plx-1::gfp transgene was expressed in these epidermal precursor cells as they underwent dynamic morphological changes. Suppression of C. elegans transmembrane semaphorins, Ce-Sema-1a and Ce-Sema-1b, by RNA interference caused a displacement of ray 1 similar to that of plx-1 mutants, whereas mutants for the Ce-Sema-2a/mab-20 gene, which encodes a secreted-type semaphorin, exhibited phenotypes distinct from those of plx-1 mutants. A heterologous expression system showed that Ce-Sema-1a, but not Ce-Sema-2a, physically bound to PLX-1. Our results indicate that PLX-1 functions as a receptor for transmembrane-type semaphorins, and, though Ce-Sema-2a and PLX-1 both play roles in the regulation of cellular morphology during epidermal morphogenesis, they function rather independently.
