The nucleotide sequences of the RNAs 1, 2, and 3 of the cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) Taiwan isolate NT9 were determined and compared at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels with those of CMV strains Fny, Y, O from subgroup I and strain Q from subgroup II. NT9-CMV has an unique feature at the C-terminus of the 3a protein which contains four extra-amino acids. All three RNAs and their encoded proteins, except 2b, of NT9-CMV share more than 90% identity with those of strains in subgroup I, and 72%-85% identity with Q-CMV. The results indicated the conservation of sequences of CMV derived from different geographical locations.
