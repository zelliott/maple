Macrophages were found of having a strong capacity of phagocytosing small size microcapsules (MS) and presenting microencapsulated antigens to either CD4+ and CD8- T cells. The class I-restricted presentation of microencapsulated tetanus toxoid by macrophages requires an intracellular processing which might follow the phagosome-to-cytosol route to enter the classical MHC class I presentation pathway. In contrast, presentation of microencapsulated cytotoxic peptide PbCS252-260 to specific CD8+ T cells has been observed with different APC and is not blocked by cytochalasin D, suggesting that peptide released from MS may directly bind to MHC class I molecules on the cell surface. In the case of MHC class II-restricted T cells, prefixation or treatment of macrophages with chloroquine, brefeldin A and cycloheximide inhibits the presentation of microencapsulated and soluble tetanus toxoid. These findings illustrate the capacity of microencapsulated antigens to enter different presentation pathways and should facilitate the development of subunit vaccines.
