A comparative study of the morphological, cultural, physiological, and biochemical properties of the microcinogenic strains EcS 5/98, EcS 6/98, and EcB 214/99 with the known microcin C51 producer Escherichia coli M17(p74) showed that these strains belong to the species E. coli. The strains produced microcins with molecular masses lower than 10 kDa. Microcin biosynthesis was stimulated by a deficiency of nutrients in the cultivation media. Microcins were found to be resistant to thermolysin, but were degraded by pronase, protolichetrem, and the Bacillus mesentericus metalloproteinase. This indicated that microcins are peptides or contain peptides in their molecules. The study of cross immunity to microcins and the sequence of their genetic determinants showed that the microcins of strains EcS 5/98 and EcS 6/98 are of B type, whereas the microcin of strain EcB 214/99 presumably belongs to another type, since it suppresses the growth of the producers of C-type and B-type microcins. The new microcin producers possess antibacterial activity against natural isolates belonging to the genera Escherichia and Salmonella, against a wide range of colicinogenic Escherichia strains, and against the collection Salmonella cultures.
