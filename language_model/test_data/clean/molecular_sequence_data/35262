Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) is seed and aphid transmitted and can cause significant reductions in yield and seed quality in soybean (Glycine max). The roles in seed and aphid transmission of selected SMV-encoded proteins were investigated by constructing mutants in and chimeric recombinants between SMV 413 (efficiently aphid and seed transmitted) and an isolate of SMV G2 (not aphid or seed transmitted). As previously reported, the DAG amino acid sequence motif near the amino terminus of the coat protein (CP) was the major determinant in differences in aphid transmissibility of the two SMV isolates, and helper component proteinase (HC-Pro) played a secondary role. Seed transmission of SMV was influenced by P1, HC-Pro, and CP. Replacement of the P1 coding region of SMV 413 with that of SMV G2 significantly enhanced seed transmissibility of SMV 413. Substitution in SMV 413 of the two amino acids that varied in the CPs of the two isolates with those from SMV G2, G to D in the DAG motif and Q to P near the carboxyl terminus, significantly reduced seed transmission. The Q-to-P substitution in SMV 413 also abolished virus-induced seed-coat mottling in plant introduction 68671. This is the first report associating P1, CP, and the DAG motif with seed transmission of a potyvirus and suggests that HC-Pro interactions with CP are important for multiple functions in the virus infection cycle.
