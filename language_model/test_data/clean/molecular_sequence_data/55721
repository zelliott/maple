A model of the lignin peroxidase LIII of Phlebia radiata was constructed on the basis of the structure of cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP). Because of the low percentage of amino acid identity between the CCP and the lignin peroxidase LIII of Phlebia radiata, alignment of the sequences was based on the generation of a template from a knowledge of the 3-D structure of CCP and consensus sequences of lignin peroxidases. This approach gave an alignment in which all the insertions in the lignin peroxidase were placed at loop regions of CCP, with a 21.1% identity for these two proteins. The model was constructed using this alignment and the computer program COMPOSER, which assembles the model as a series of rigid fragments derived from CCP and other proteins. Manual intervention was required for some of the longer loop regions. The alpha-helices forming the structural framework, and especially the haem environment of CCP, are conserved in the LIII model and the core is close packed without holes. A possible site of the substrate oxidation at the haem edge of LIII is discussed.
