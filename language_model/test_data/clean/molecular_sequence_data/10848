The rearrangement and repair of DNA by homologous recombination involves the creation of Holliday junctions, which are cleaved by a class of junction-specific endonucleases to generate recombinant duplex DNA products. Only two cellular junction-resolving enzymes have been identified to date: RuvC in eubacteria and CCE1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria. We have identified a protein from Schizosaccharomyces pombe which has 28% sequence identity to CCE1. The YDC2 protein has been cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant protein has been shown to be a Holliday junction-resolving enzyme. YDC2 has a high degree of specificity for the structure of the four-way junction, to which it binds as a dimer. The enzyme exhibits a sequence specificity for junction cleavage that differs from both CCE1 and RuvC, and it cleaves fixed junctions at the point of strand exchange. The conservation of the mechanism of Holliday junction cleavage between two organisms as diverse as S. cerevisiae and S. pombe suggests that there may be a common pathway for mitochondrial homologous recombination in fungi, plants, protists, and possibly higher eukaryotes.
