The study was purposed to investigate the effect of arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3))- induced p16 gene demethylation by a sensitive and specific PCR-based method (nested-methylation specific PCR, n-MSP) and DNA sequencing for rapid analysis of the promoter demethylation status, and to explore the possible mechanism of the p16 gene demethylation in human multiple myeloma U266 cells induced by As(2)O(3). The methylation status of the p16 gene in U266 cell line before and after treatment with As(2)O(3) was detected by the nested-methylation specific PCR and DNA sequencing, the mRNA of p16, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT 1, DNMT3A and 3B) gene were determined by RT-PCR, and the induced growth inhibition of U266 cell was assayed by growth curve, MTT and CFU; the DNA content of U266 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry after being exposed to As(2)O(3). The results showed that (1) all cytosines in CpG dinucleotides in untreated U266 cell not were changed, while all cytosines in treated U266 cells with As(2)O(3) had been converted to thymidine. (2) p16 gene was not expressed in U266 cell line after methylation. As compared with the beta-actin, the expression of U266 cell p16 gene mRNA was increased to (0.22 +/- 0.10), (0.59 +/- 0.11), (0.68 +/- 0.09) after exposed to 0.5 micromol/L, 1.0 micromol/L and 2.0 micromol/L As(2)O(3) for 72 hours respectively. (3) As(2)O(3) could significantly down-regulate DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT 1), DNMT3A and DNMT3B gene at mRNA level in a dose-dependent manner. (4) U266 cells line grew slowly and arrested at G(0) - G(1) phase after treatment with three different concentrations of As(2)O(3). It is concluded that As(2)O(3) can activate and up-regulate the expression of p16 gene which inhibits the proliferation of U266 cell through inducing the G(0) - G(1) arrest by demethylation or/and by inhibiting DNMT 1, DNMT3A and 3B gene.
