To develop a Rapid Flow-through assay for distinguishing replicating Tiantan vaccine-generated serological response from true HIV infection.

A Rapid Flow-through Test including gp41, gp36, sk1, sk2 and sk3 antigens was established and the performance of the assay was evaluated in clinical studies and compared with ELISA assay.

Sk1, sk2 and sk3 peptides performed at 100% specificity and slightly but not significantly different sensitivities between ELISA assay (92%, 76% and 41%) and Flow-through Test Kit (92%, 75% and 40%) in diagnosing HIV-1 infections. Of particular importance, Tiantan vaccine recipients that gave false-positive results in gp41 serodetection scored negative for sk1, sk2 and sk3 antibodies.

The Rapid Flow-through Test could be a robust tool in both diagnosing HIV-1/2 infections and differentiating between vaccines induced immunity and immunity resulting from natural exposure, thus serving as potential implementation in HIV vaccine trials.
