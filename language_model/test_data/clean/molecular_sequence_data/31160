A review of the data on the synthesis of RNA-fragments with endonuclease activity. The Haseloff and Gerlach model for design of ribozymes and the results of the synthesis of the three new ribozymes targeted against the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene transcript are considered. The possibility of the use of a shortened form of Tetrahymena self-splicing ribosomal RNA intervening sequence for the ribozyme design also are discussed.
