Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has served for several decades as the prototype rhabdovirus and a model RNA virus. Extensive studies upheld the original view of VSV genetics with simply five genes (N, P, M, G, and L), each encoding a single unique protein. We now report the first unambiguous demonstration of the existence of an additional unique protein encoded in an overlapping frame within the virus P gene. Experiments using antipeptide sera specific for the predicted second open reading frame have demonstrated the synthesis of two N-terminally nested forms of the protein in virus-infected cells. The major form is 55 amino acids in length, whereas the minor form has 10 additional N-terminal amino acids. Ribosome initiation of synthesis of these proteins appears to occur at AUG codons, 68 and 41 bases, respectively, downstream of the P protein AUG initiation codon. The proteins are found in the cytoplasm of the infected cell but are undetectable in purified virions, consistent with their being nonstructural proteins. Both the major and minor forms of the protein are highly basic and arginine rich, reminiscent of the C and C' proteins encoded in overlapping frame close to the 5' terminus of the P mRNA of several paramyxoviruses. The potential to encode small, highly basic proteins within the P mRNA 5' terminus is highly conserved among the vesiculoviruses.
