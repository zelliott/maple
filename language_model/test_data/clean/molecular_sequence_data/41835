The gene causing Huntington's disease, an autosomal dominantly inherited, neurodegenerative disorder, has been identified recently. The corresponding mutation is involving an expansion in the number of (CAG)n repeats in the coding region of the Huntington's disease gene on chromosome 4. In this report, we demonstrate the length variation of the repeat in 513 non-HD chromosomes from normal individuals and HD patients showing 23 alleles with 11 to 33 repeats. Analyzing the inheritance of the (CAG)n stretch we found meiotic instability for HD alleles ([CAG]40 to [CAG]75) with a mutation frequency of approximately 0.7, while in 431 meioses of normal alleles only two expansions were identified. The risk of expansion during spermatogenesis is enhanced compared to oogenesis explaining juvenile onset by transmission from affected fathers. Further, the number of (CAG)n copies in an affected individual in relation to the sex of the transmitting parent was evaluated and no significant differences were found. No mosaicism or differences in the repeat lengths were observed in the DNA from different tissues including brain and lymphocytes of two HD patients indicating mitotic stability of the mutation. Therefore, the determination of the repeat number in the DNA of blood lymphocytes is probably representative of all tissues in a patient.
