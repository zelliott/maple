We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of a 23 kb segment from the left arm of chromosome IV, which is carried by the cosmid 1L10. This sequence contains the 3' coding region of the STE7 and RET1 (COP1) genes, and 13 complete open reading frames longer than 300 bp, of which ten correspond to putative new genes and three (CLB3, MSH5 and RPC53) have been sequenced previously. The sequence from cosmid IL10 was obtained entirely by a combined subcloning and walking primer strategy.
