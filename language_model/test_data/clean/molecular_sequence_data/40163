Hyaluronidase (HAase) catalyzes multiple enzymatic polymerizations with controlling regio- and stereoselectivity perfectly. This behavior, that is, the single enzyme being effective for multireactions and retaining the enzyme catalytic specificity, is not usual, and hence, HAase is a supercatalyst. Various sugar oxazoline monomers prepared based on the concept "transition-state analogue substrate" were successfully polymerized and copolymerized with HAase catalysis, yielding natural and unnatural glycosaminoglycans.
