Premature initiation of cytokinesis can lead to loss of chromosomes, and 'cutting' of the nucleus. Therefore, the proper spatial and temporal co-ordination of mitosis and cytokinesis is essential for maintaining the integrity of the genome. The fission yeast cdc16 gene is implicated both in the spindle assembly checkpoint and control of septum formation. To identify other proteins involved in these controls, we have isolated multicopy suppressors of the cdc16-116 mutation, and the characterization of one of these, dma1 (defective in mitotic arrest), is presented here. dma1 is not an essential gene, but in a dma1 null background (dma1-D1) the function of the spindle assembly checkpoint is compromised. If assembly of the spindle is prevented, dma1-D1 cells do not arrest, the activity of cdc2 kinase decays and cells form a division septum without completing a normal mitosis. dma1-D1 cells also show an increased rate of chromosome loss during exponential growth. Upon ectopic expression from an inducible promoter, dma1p delays progress through mitosis and inhibits septum formation, giving rise to elongated, multinucleate cells. We propose that dma1 is a component of the spindle assembly checkpoint, required to prevent septum formation and premature exit from mitosis if spindle function is impaired.
