A novel P450 cDNA was isolated from a rat lung lambda gt11 library by hybridization with the rat P450 IIB1 cDNA probe. The cDNA-deduced amino acid sequence of this clone was 71% and 73% similar to rat IIA1 and IIA2 P450s; it was, therefore, designated IIA3 as the third member of the rat IIA subfamily. IIA3 demonstrates only 55% amino acid similarity with IIB1. Interestingly, this P450 also shared 85% and 94% amino acid similarities with human IIA3 and a mouse testosterone 15 alpha-hydroxylase P450, respectively, indicating that these P450s are orthologous counterparts to rat IIA3. Chromosome mapping, using mouse-hamster somatic cell hybrids, revealed that the IIA3 gene is localized on mouse chromosome 7. The IIA3 mRNA was detected in rat lung, and its level was induced 3-fold by treatment of rats with 3-methylcholanthrene. No IIA3 mRNA was seen in the liver, kidney, or intestine, even after long exposure of Northern blot filters to X-ray film. In contrast, the orthologous mouse and human IIA3 genes are expressed in liver.
