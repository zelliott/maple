We have identified two distinct sequence elements in the mouse alpha 1(III) collagen promoter which are protected from DNase I digestion by the binding of factors present in crude nuclear extracts of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Small substitution mutations were introduced into these promoter elements and shown by the gel retardation (gel mobility shift) and DNase I protection assays to decrease or eliminate factor binding to the mutated element but not to the remaining wild-type element, indicating that two distinct factors recognize these separate promoter regions. Region A appears to bind a factor related to the Jun/AP-1 protein, whereas the factor binding to region B remains as yet unidentified. Mutagenesis of either region decreased the activity of the alpha 1(III) collagen promoter in DNA transfection assays by about 3-fold for the A region (located between - 122 and - 106) and about 5-fold for the B region (located between -83 and -61). These results indicate that regions A and B in the mouse alpha 1(III) collagen promoter are positive cis-regulatory elements, independently binding two distinct trans-activating factors.
