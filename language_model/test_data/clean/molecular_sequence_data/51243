A cDNA clone encoding a novel zinc finger protein expressed in lymphoid cells has been isolated. This protein contains 5 repeats of the C2H2 motif previously described in the Drosophila gap gene, Kr√ºppel, which is involved in embryo segmentation. Northern blot analysis showed that the messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding this protein is expressed at high levels in a variety of T-leukemia cell lines, at lower levels in some B cells, but is not observed in nonlymphoid cells. Within the T lineage, the mRNA is found at high levels in both alpha beta and gamma delta T cells. These data suggest that this cDNA, designated Hkr-T1, represents a gene that may contribute to the determination of the differentiation and the specificity within lymphoid cells.
