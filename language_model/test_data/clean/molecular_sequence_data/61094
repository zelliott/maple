Vpr, one of the accessory molecules of HIV-1, has been demonstrated to arrest the cell cycle at the G2 phase. This Vpr-mediated cell cycle arrest is implicated to have an important role in the viral life cycle. In the present study, we quantitate the extent of Vpr-mediated cell cycle arrest with the use of a bicistronic vector consisting of a vpr gene and a green fluorescence protein sequence. Using this system, we examined the effect of several Vprs on cell cycle progression and growth of cells from different species quantitatively. We found that Vpr from the T-cell line-adapted HIV-1SF2 strain (Vpr2) could not significantly induce G2 arrest in HeLa cells but was able to induce it in 293T cells. However, strong inhibition of cell proliferation in HeLa cells as well as in 293T cells was observed by Vpr2. This ability of Vpr2 to inhibit cell proliferation without G2 arrest was also observed when expressed in monkey cell line. Analyses of chimeric Vprs revealed that this species-non-specific growth inhibitory activity of Vpr was not mediated solely by the C-terminal region of Vpr. These results indicated that the growth inhibitory activity of Vpr is independent of its G2 arresting activity. In addition, the species-non-specific nature of this activity suggests that Vpr has a novel mechanism to retard cell proliferation by influencing basic cellular functions.
