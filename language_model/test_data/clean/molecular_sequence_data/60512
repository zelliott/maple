The glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase exists in two evolutionarily unrelated forms. Vertebrates have only the 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-dependent enzyme (dPGM), whilst higher plants have only the cofactor-independent enzyme (iPGM). Certain eubacteria possess genes encoding both enzymes, and their respective metabolic roles and activities are unclear. We have over-expressed, purified and characterised the two PGMs of Escherichia coli. Both are expressed at high levels, but dPGM has a 10-fold higher specific activity than iPGM. Differential inhibition by vanadate was observed. The presence of an integral manganese ion in iPGM was confirmed by EPR spectroscopy.
