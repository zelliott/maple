A stem-loop structure, formed by a pair of inverted repeats during DNA replication, is a conserved feature at the origin of DNA replication among plant and animal viruses, bacteriophages and plasmids that replicate their genomes via the rolling-circle replication (RCR) mechanism. In this work, a head-to-tail tandem construct of porcine circovirus capable of generating unit-length genomic DNA in Escherichia coli was employed to examine the role of the stem-loop structure with respect to the RCR initiation and termination process. The advantage of using a head-to-tail tandem construct is that the initiation and termination sites for generation of the unit-length viral genomes are physically separated, which allows independent examination of the initiation/termination processes. Nucleotide substitution mutational analysis showed that a pair of inverted repeats capable of forming a stem-loop structure was essential for termination, but not for initiation. The results also demonstrated that it is the stem-loop configuration, not nucleotide sequence specificity, that is critical for terminating RCR DNA replication.
