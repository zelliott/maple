Cellular uptake of organic solutes is mediated in large part by a gene family of membrane transporters called OATPs (SLC21A). To study the structural determinants and evolutionary development of the SLC21A family, we have cloned and functionally characterized a highly expressed evolutionarily primitive Oatp from the liver of the small skate, Raja erinacea. A full-length cDNA (2.3 kb) was obtained that encodes a protein of 689 amino acids. The characteristics of this novel skate Oatp, including tissue expression, subcellular localization, substrate selectivity, Na(+) dependence, and inhibitor selectivity were generally similar to liver-specific human OATP-C and rat Oatp4. However, sequence comparisons with other OATPs indicate that this skate Oatp shares only approximately 40-50% amino acid identity with the liver-specific OATPs/Oatps and with human OATP-F. Further computer analysis revealed that the highest amino acid identities reside in the first external (78%) and internal loops (75%) and transmembrane domains 2 (76%), 3 (62%), 4 (70%), and 11 (64%). We propose that the conserved regions of the SLC21A transporter family may be critical structural determinants of substrate specificity and function.
