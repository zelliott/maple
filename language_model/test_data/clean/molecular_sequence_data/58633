Primary expression of the Rhizobium meliloti-induced peroxidase gene rip1 occurs prior to nodule morphogenesis, specifically at the site of impending rhizobial infection (D. Cook, D. Dreyer, D. Bonnet, M. Howell, E. Nony, K. VandenBosch [1995] Plant Cell 7: 43-55). We examined the distribution and structure of rip1 transcript throughout nodule development. We determined that expression of rip1 in root tips is correlated with the competence of this zone for symbiotic association, whereas after rhizobial infection rip1 transcript is specifically associated with the zone of nodule development, including nascent nodule primordia. rip1 transcripts are characterized by multiple polyadenylation sites distributed within 200 to 400 bp of the translation stop site, and a single major transcription initiation site in close proximity to the rip1 open reading frame. Thus, rip1 expression is likely to be mediated through effects on a single transcription unit. Immediately 5' of the rip1 transcription unit DNA sequence analysis identified a 377-bp DNA element containing extensive repeat structure that is widely distributed in the Medicago truncatula genome.
