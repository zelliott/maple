Root nodule formation is controlled by plant hormones such as auxin. Auxin-repressed protein (ARP) genes have been identified in various plant species but their functions are not clear. We have isolated a full-length cDNA clone (EuNOD-ARP1) showing high sequence homology to previously identified ARP genes from root nodules of Elaeagnus umbellata. Genomic Southern hybridization showed that there are at least four ARP-related genes in the genome of E. umbellata. The cDNA clone encodes a polypeptide of 120 amino acid residues with no signal peptide or organelle-targeting signals, indicating that it is a cytosolic protein. Its cytosolic location was confirmed using Arabidopsis protoplasts expressing a EuNOD-ARP1:smGFP fusion protein. Northern hybridization showed that EuNOD-ARP1 expression was higher in root nodules than in leaves or uninoculated roots. Unlike the ARP genes of strawberry and black locust, which are negatively regulated by exogenous auxin, EuNOD-ARP1 expression is induced by auxin in leaf tissue of E. umbellata. In situ hybridization revealed that EuNOD-ARP1 is mainly expressed in the fixation zone of root nodules.
