A Babesia caballi gene encoding the 134-kDa (BC134) protein was immunoscreened with B. caballi-infected horse serum. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using recombinant BC134 protein could effectively differentiate B. caballi-infected horse sera from Babesia equi-infected or noninfected control horse sera. These results suggest that the recombinant BC134 protein is a potential diagnostic antigen in the detection of B. caballi infection.
