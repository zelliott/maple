ISG15 is one of the most strongly induced genes upon viral infection, interferon (IFN) stimulation, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and only one copy has been found in mammals so far. Here two fish ISG15 genes, termed CaISG15-1 and CaISG15-2, have been cloned and sequenced from UV-inactivated GCHV (grass carp haemorrhagic virus)-infected and IFN-produced CAB cells (crucian carp Carassius auratus blastulae embryonic cells) by suppression subtractive hybridization. The full-length cDNA sequences of two crucian carp ISG15 encode a 155-amino-acid protein and a 161-amino-acid protein, both of which show 78.9% identity overall and possess the characteristic structures of mammalian ISG15 proteins including two tandem ubiquitin-like domains and the C-terminal canonical LRLRGG motif. In CAB cells treated with different stimuli including active virus, UV-inactivated GCHV and IFN containing supernatant (ICS), the expression of both CaISG15-1 and CaISG15-2 was upregulated but displayed different kinetics. Poly I:C and LPS were also able to induce an increase in mRNA for both genes. In CAB cells responsive to active GCHV, UV-inactivated GCHV, CAB ICS, Poly I:C and LPS, CaISG15-1 was upregulated more significantly than CaISG15-2. These results suggest that there are two ISG15 homologues in crucian carp, both of which might play distinct roles in innate immunity against viral and bacterial infection.
