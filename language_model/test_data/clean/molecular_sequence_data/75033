The 5' region of the rRNA operon, rrnA, of M. capricolum was cloned. Sequence analysis revealed two tRNA genes, tRNA(leu) and tRNA(lys), upstream to the promoter of the rRNA operon. The in vivo transcription start sites of the rRNA operon and of the tRNA genes were mapped. The same promoters used by M. capricolum RNA polymerase are also recognized by E. coli RNA polymerase both in vivo and in vitro. We find that high levels of ppGpp in E. coli, resulting from amino acid starvation or from spoT mutation, activate rather than repress the transcription of the mycoplasma rrnA operon.
