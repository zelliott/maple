Paratylenchus shenzhenensis n. sp. was collected from the rhizosphere soil of Anthurium andraeanum in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China. The new species is characterized by having a female with a small body (249-302 μm), well developed stylet (17-21 μm), rounded head with four submedian lobes and lip-region with a slight depression at the oral area, small post-vulval uterine sac with a few vestigial cells; male with body dorsally curved behind the cloacal opening, stylet absent, pharynx degenerate, prominent penial sheath; and juveniles with a stylet. It is morphologically similar to P. minutus. The internal transcribed spacer sequences of ribosomal DNA (ITS-rDNA) of the new species only have 72-73% identity with P. minutus, confirming its status as a separate species. The D2/D3 region of 28S ribosomal DNA (28S rDNA) and 18S small subunit ribosomal DNA (18S rDNA) from P. shenzhenensis n. sp. were also amplified and sequenced in this study.
