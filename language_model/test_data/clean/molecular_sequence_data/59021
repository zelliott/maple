We have identified three strains of the same S24-haplotype in self-incompatible B. campestris L. Two of them, S-12j and 1-1j, have been derived from Japanese populations and one, 27-1t, from Turkish one. The cDNA clones of SLG24 (S24-locus glycoprotein), which linked to the S-locus, were isolated from each strain, and sequenced. Each clone isolated from S-12j, 1-1j and 27-1t, was designated as SLG24 (S-12j), SLG24 (1-1j) and SLG24 (27-1t), respectively. Their nucleotide sequences were completely identical in coding region, 5' non-coding region, and 3' non-coding region, though the position of the polyadenylation site was slightly different among the cDNA clones. This result suggests that the origin of S24-haplotype in these three strains might be common, and that the nucleotide sequences of SLG24 of the same S24-haplotype are completely conserved among different populations. The high conservation of the SLG24 nucleotide sequences is probably essential for the recognition of self or non-self of self-incompatibility in this S24-haplotype.
