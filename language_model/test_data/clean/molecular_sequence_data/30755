In contrast with the complex series of splicing choices that generate the various membrane-associated isoforms of the neural cell-adhesion molecule alternative splicing of 5' exons does not contribute to additional molecular diversity. A single regulatory unit in genomic DNA, mapping to a 5 kb restriction-endonuclease-HindIII fragment, controls the expression of all major RNA size classes. DNA sequence analysis of a 2 kb fragment spanning the two major identified transcriptional initiation sites (194 and 188 bp from the ATG codon) and translation start codon indicates that the regulatory unit does not possess classical TATA or CCAAT motifs. The region of the putative promoter exhibits a GC-rich content and a high frequency of the dinucleotide CpG, both characteristics of a HTF(HpaII tiny fragments)-island. Introduction of deletion-mutant chimaeric-gene constructs into human and rodent N-CAM-expressing cell lines defines an active promoter region of 467 bp (-144 to -611 bp from the ATG codon). This region of genomic DNA contains consensus sites for the interaction of known transcriptional factors.
