6-Pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) is involved in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an essential cofactor for enzymes such as the hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase. BH4 deficiency causes malignant hyperphenylalaninemia. We cloned the human liver cDNA encoding PTPS. The coding region for PTPS contains 145 amino acids and predicts a polypeptide of 16'387 Da. The human amino acid sequence showed a 82% identity with the rat liver sequence. Expression of the cDNA in E. coli yielded the active enzyme and showed immunoreactivity with antibodies against the rat liver PTPS. This is the basis for the molecular understanding of BH4 deficiency in patients suffering from a defect in PTPS activity.
