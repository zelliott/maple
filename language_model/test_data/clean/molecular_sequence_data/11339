The sequencing of a 3.5 kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment located in the 236 degrees region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome revealed a 690-bp long open reading frame, partly similar in amino acid composition to flavokinases/FAD synthases from several microorganisms. The discovered sequence can be identified with the gene ribR, an auxiliary regulatory gene of the riboflavin operon of Bacillus subtilis.
