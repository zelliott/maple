Star is expressed in steroidogenic cells as 3.5- and 1.6-kb transcripts that differ only in their 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR). In mouse MA10 testis and Y-1 adrenal lines, Br-cAMP preferentially stimulates 3.5-kb mRNA. ACTH is similarly selective in primary bovine adrenocortical cells. The 3.5-kb form harbors AU-rich elements (AURE) in the extended 3'-UTR, which enhance turnover. After peak stimulation of 3.5-kb mRNA, degradation is seen. Star mRNA turnover is enhanced by the zinc finger protein ZFP36L1/TIS11b, which binds to UAUUUAUU repeats in the extended 3'-UTR. TIS11b is rapidly stimulated in each cell type in parallel with Star mRNA. Cotransfection of TIS11b selectively decreases cytomegalovirus-promoted Star mRNA and luciferase-Star 3'-UTR reporters harboring the extended 3'-UTR. Direct complex formation was demonstrated between TIS11b and the extended 3'-UTR of the 3.5-kb Star. AURE mutations revealed that TIS11b-mediated destabilization required the first two UAUUUAUU motifs. HuR, which also binds AURE, did not affect Star expression. Targeted small interfering RNA knockdown of TIS11b specifically enhanced stimulation of 3.5-kb Star mRNA in bovine adrenocortical cells, MA-10, and Y-1 cells but did not affect the reversals seen after peak stimulation. Direct transfection of Star mRNA demonstrated that Br-cAMP stimulated a selective turnover of 3.5-kb mRNA independent of AURE, which may correspond to these reversal processes. Steroidogenic acute regulatory (STAR) protein induction was halved by TIS11b knockdown, concomitant with decreased cholesterol metabolism. TIS11b suppression of 3.5-kb mRNA is therefore surprisingly coupled to enhanced Star translation leading to increased cholesterol metabolism.
