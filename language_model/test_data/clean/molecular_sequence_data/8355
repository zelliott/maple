The major outer membrane protein P1 (class 1) of Neisseria meningitidis has been produced as inclusion bodies in Bacillus subtilis with the aim to develop a vaccine based on it. The protein produced in high yield in B. subtilis contained an N-terminal extension of 11 amino acid residues which was found to be necessary for expression in the production system. In the present study we asked whether or not the removal of this extension would effect the conformation of this protein in liposomes as judged by its immunogenic properties. A methionine was engineered in front of the mature P1 protein to provide a chemical cleavage site for CNBr to remove the extension. The CNBr-cleaved protein, complexed with phospholipids, elicited high titers of antibodies binding to the meningococcal cells similarly to the noncleaved protein. This suggests that the BacP1 protein can serve as an effective vaccine component irrespective of the presence, or absence, of this N-terminal extension.
