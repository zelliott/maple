The three-dimensional solution structure is reported for omega-conotoxin GVIA, which is a potent inhibitor of presynaptic calcium channels in vertebrate neuromuscular junctions. Structures were generated by a hybrid distance geometry and restrained molecular dynamics approach using interproton distance, torsion angle, and hydrogen-bonding constraints derived from 1H NMR data. Conformations of GVIA with low constraint violations converged to a common peptide fold. The secondary structure in the peptide is an antiparallel triple-stranded beta-sheet containing a beta-hairpin and three tight turns. The NMR data are consistent with the region of the peptide from residues S9 to C16 being more dynamic than the rest of the peptide. The peptide has an amphiphilic structure with a positively charged hydrophilic side and an opposite side that contains a small hydrophobic region. Residues that are thought to be important in binding and function are located on the hydrophilic face of the peptide.
