Atrial muscles of the heart are known to produce polypeptide hormones called atrial natriuretic factors (ANF) which have potent diuretic and hypotensive action. These hormones are synthesized as a larger protein precursor called pro atrial natriuretic factor or proANF which contains the biologically active ANF sequences at its C-terminus. Rat proANF (representing amino acids -1 to 128 of the coding sequence) was expressed in a soluble form in Escherichia coli. A simple purification procedure was developed which consists of boiling E. coli cell extracts in 1 M acetic acid and subjecting the supernatant to reversed-phase HPLC. The effect of intravenous administration of the purified recombinant proANF on mean arterial blood pressure was examined. The displacement dose-response curves obtained demonstrated that proANF exhibits similar, albeit less potent, physiological activity than ANF.
