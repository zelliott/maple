When expressed in Escherichia coli, recombinant F(ab) contain a heavy-chain Fd fragment and a complete light-chain fragment. Because these F(ab) are monovalent, their avidity is significantly lower than that of a corresponding bivalent IgG antibody. In addition, when monovalent F(ab) are used in hemagglutination assays, antiglobulin reagents are required. Therefore, it would be useful to develop a system that expresses recombinant bivalent F(ab) in E. coli.

Three modified vectors were constructed. Each contained cDNA sequences encoding a peptide linked to the C terminus of a heavy-chain CH1 region: an IgG1 hinge region (Hinge), a leucine zipper (Zip), or a peptide containing the Hinge and Zip sequences in tandem (HingeZip). The vectors were used to express two cloned F(ab) recognizing human antigens M and N: NNA7 (anti-N) and 425/2B (anti-M). The recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli and were purified and evaluated by ELISA and hemagglutination.

By gel filtration chromatography, 35, 90, and 70 percent of the purified F(ab) expressing the Hinge, Zip, and HingeZip tails, respectively, were dimers. By ELISA, the avidity of F(ab) containing the Zip or HingeZip tails was six to eight times higher than that of the corresponding monovalent F(ab). In addition, the dimeric F(ab) directly agglutinated RBCs in concentrations similar to those of corresponding bivalent IgG antibodies.

An introduction of dimer-inducing peptides allowed the isolation of bacterially produced, bivalent F(ab). This approach could be useful for obtaining inexpensive, serologic reagents that may replace or complement conventional MoAbs produced by mammalian tissue culture methods.
