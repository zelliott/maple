CCAAT box/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) is a bZip transcription factor that plays crucial roles in important cellular processes such as differentiation and proliferation of specific cell types. Previously, we showed that C/EBPβ cooperates with the coactivator p300 through a novel mechanism that involves the C/EBPβ-induced phosphorylation of multiple sites in the carboxyl-terminal domain of p300 by protein kinase Hipk2. We have now examined the interaction and cooperation of C/EBPβ, p300, and Hipk2 in more detail. We show that Hipk2 and C/EBPβ are direct physical binding partners whose interaction is mediated by sequences located in the amino-terminal and central domains of Hipk2 and the amino-terminal part of C/EBPβ. In addition to phosphorylating p300 recruited to C/EBPβ, Hipk2 also phosphorylates C/EBPβ at sites that have previously been shown to plays key roles in the regulation of C/EBPβ activity. Silencing of Hipk2 expression disrupts adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, a physiological C/EBPβ-dependent differentiation process indicating that the cooperation of C/EBPβ and Hipk2 is functionally relevant. Finally, we demonstrate that C/EBPα, a related C/EBP family member whose amino-terminal sequences differ significantly from that of C/EBPβ, is unable to interact and cooperate with Hipk2. Instead, our data suggest that C/EBPα cooperates with the protein kinase Jnk to induce phosphorylation of p300. Overall, our data identify Hipk2 as a novel regulator of C/EBPβ and implicate different protein kinases in the cooperation of p300 with C/EBPβ and C/EBPα.
