We studied the evolution of alphaviruses in the Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) complex using phylogenetic analysis of RNA nucleotide sequences from limited portions of the nsP4, E1, and 3' untranslated genome regions of representative strains. The VEE complex constituted a monophyletic group of viruses (descended from a common ancestor); some serologic VEE varieties such as subtype III formed monophyletic groups while subtype I did not. Subtype II Everglades and variety ID enzootic viruses formed a monophyletic group which also included all epizootic variety IAB and IC VEE isolates. Everglades virus diverged from this ID lineage (colonized North America) ca. 100-150 years ago, followed by divergence of variety IAB and IC epizootic viruses. Variety IAB viruses probably emerged from the variety ID lineage once during the early part of this century, while variety IC viruses evolved at least two times. These results identify the source of epizootic VEE viruses as the variety ID enzootic virus lineage which occurs in northern South America and Panama. Even if variety IAB and IC viruses are extinct, recent, multiple emergences of epizootic viruses from an enzootic lineage suggests that other epizootic VEE viruses may evolve again in the future. The close genetic relationship of subtype II Everglades virus to the variety ID lineage also implies the potential for emergence of equine-virulent VEE viruses in Florida.
