1L-myo-Inositol-1-phosphate synthase catalyzes the conversion of D-glucose 6-phosphate to 1L-myo-inositol-1-phosphate, the first committed step in the production of all inositol-containing compounds, including phospholipids, either directly or by salvage. The enzyme exists in a cytoplasmic form in a wide range of plants, animals, and fungi. It has also been detected in several bacteria and a chloroplast form is observed in alga and higher plants. The enzyme has been purified from a wide range of organisms and its active form is a multimer of identical subunits ranging in molecular weight from 58,000 to 67,000. The activity of the synthase is stimulated by NH4Cl and inhibited by glucitol 6-phosphate and 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate. Structural genes (INO1) encoding the 1L-myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase subunit have been isolated from several eukaryotic microorganisms and higher plants. In baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the transcriptional regulation of the INO1 gene has been studied in detail and its expression is sensitive to the availability of phospholipid precursors as well as growth phase. The regulation of the structural gene encoding 1L-myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase has also been analyzed at the transcriptional level in the aquatic angiosperm, Spirodela polyrrhiza and the halophyte, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum.
