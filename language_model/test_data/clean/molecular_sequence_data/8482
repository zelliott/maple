We have employed a cos-like monkey kidney cell line (B4.14) transfected with plasmids pCMVgag-pol-rre-r (containing the HIV gag and pol genes) and pCMVrev (containing the HIV rev gene), as a model to investigate whether antisense constructs could interfere with specific HIV gene and protein expression. We utilized an antisense construct (GP12A) directed against a non-regulatory region of the HIV genome, to transfect cells that expressed the above-mentioned HIV genes. Our results show that GP12A was able to attenuate levels of relevant HIV mRNA and gag proteins in the absence of cytotoxic effects.
