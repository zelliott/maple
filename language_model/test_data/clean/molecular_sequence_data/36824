A diuretic peptide (Periplaneta-DP) has been isolated from extracts of whole heads of the cockroach, Periplaneta americana. The purified peptide increases cyclic AMP production and the rate of fluid secretion by isolated Malpighian tubules in vitro. In the fluid secretion assay, the response to native Periplaneta-DP is comparable to that obtained with crude extracts of cockroach corpora cardiaca, and the EC50 lies between 10(-8) and 10(-9) M. The primary structure of Periplaneta-DP was established as a 46-residue amidated peptide: T G S G P S L S I V N P L D V L R Q R L L L E I A R R R M R Q S Q D Q I Q A N R E I L Q T I-NH2. Periplaneta-DP is a further member of the recently established family of CRF-related insect diuretic peptides.
