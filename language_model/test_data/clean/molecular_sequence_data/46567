Using a random peptide library designed for the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified a peptide that binds strongly to the P3 structural protein of rice dwarf phytoreovirus (RDV). The amino acid sequence of the peptide showed a high homology to the C-terminal region of P3. C-terminally truncated P3 lost its ability to interact with authentic P3. Our observations suggest that the C-terminal region of P3 is important for the P3-P3 interaction, which forms the core shell structure of RDV.
