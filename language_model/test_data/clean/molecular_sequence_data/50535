HL-60 cells carrying the CD4 marker could be productively infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) but did not form syncytia, though 11-14 days p.i., there was a transient decrease in cell multiplication and viability. After prolonged passage, a subpopulation of HL-60 cells was selected. The virus produced differed from the initial input virus grown on CEM cells: the virions lacked knobs, were either empty or had abnormal cores, had a higher ratio p24/gp41,gp110 and were less infectious. After prolonged passage, virus was produced which was fully infectious for CEM but not for fresh HL-60 cells, and which ressembled the input virus with respect to morphology and p24/gp41,gp110 ratio.
