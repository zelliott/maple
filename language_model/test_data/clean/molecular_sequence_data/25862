This review discusses our present knowledge of the structure and activities of the mast cell degranulating peptide (MCDP). This peptide is a basic, 22 amino acid residue component of honey bee venom with striking immunological and pharmacological activities. MCDP is a potent anti-inflammatory agent, but at low concentrations it is a strong mediator of mast cell degranulation and histamine release. MCDP is also an epileptogenic neurotoxin, an avid blocker of the potassium channels and can cause a significant lowering of the blood pressure in rats. Some of the biological activities of MCDP appear to have distinct mechanisms and may represent a good illustration of the structure-function relationship.
