A specific 135-kDa protein was purified from porcine cauda epididymal fluid. Analysis of its N-terminal amino acid sequence revealed it to be a new protein. Stable clones of hybridomas that produced monoclonal antibodies against the purified 135-kDa protein were established. A clone, B-11, reacting both with epididymal fluid and with sperm plasma membranes was selected and used in this study. Immunoblotting analysis showed that B-11 reacted only with a 135-kDa protein among epididymal fluid proteins. In contrast, B-11 did not recognize a similar 135-kDa sperm protein but did strongly react with a 27-kDa protein among sperm membrane proteins, extracted by NP-40 in the presence of protease inhibitors. B-11 also reacted only with a 27-kDa protein fragment among trypsin digests of the 135-kDa epididymal protein. The 135-kDa protein was first detected, by ELISA or immunoblotting analysis, at the beginning of the corpus epididymis. Maximal levels were reached in the distal corpus and levels were slightly decreased in the cauda epididymis. On the other hand, the surface of caput sperm were found to contain small amounts of antigen(s), the concentration of which gradually increased during epididymal transit. In immunocytochemical studies, the antigen was detectable in the epithelial cells from the initial segment to the corpus of the epididymis but not in the caudal cells. In the lumen, the presence of the 135 kDa protein was apparent in the corpus (at a maximum in the middle and distal corpus) and to a lesser degree in the caudal lumen. The 27-kDa protein was distributed all over the equatorial region of the acrosome of less than 10% of caput epididymal sperm. As sperm passed through the corpus epididymis, the percentage of immunoreactive cells increased and the protein was restricted to specific domains of the sperm head. Thus, on the mature sperm, antigen was localized in a crescent-shaped area of the equatorial segment just behind the anterior part of the acrosome and on the apical rim of the sperm head. This is the first observation of a sperm surface antigen derived from an epididymal protein as a proteolytic fragment that interacts with specific regions of the sperm membrane during the process of spermatozoa maturation.
