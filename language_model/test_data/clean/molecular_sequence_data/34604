Fatty acid composition of cellular lipids of 23 Pseudomonas lupini strains (Beltjukova et Koroljova 1968) has been investigated. Cellular fatty acids which contained from C10 to C19 carbon atoms have been identified. Basic fatty acid of those Pseudomonas cells are hexadecanoic, hexadecenoic and octadecanoic acids. The 3-hydroxydecanoic (C10:0 3OH), 3-hydroxydodecanoic (C12:0 3OH), 2-hydroxydodecanoic (C12:0 2OH) and cyclopropane fatty acids which contain 17 and 19 carbon atoms have been detected in cellular lipids. The cellular fatty acids spectra of 22 P. lupini strains are similar to cellular fatty acids spectrum of the type strain Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 8511. Pathogenic isolate 2, which fatty acid content of cell lipids significantly differ from lipids of cell fatty acids from P. lupini strains and cell lipids of fatty acids of typical strains Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 8511 and Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. phaseolicola 9066 is the exception.
