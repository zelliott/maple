Currently most available HLA-A, -B and -C DNA sequences cover exons 2 and 3 with a limited number extending to include other exons and introns. We have developed a method for the accurate determination of full-length genomic DNA sequences for HLA-A, -B and -C alleles. The method involves cloning of PCR amplified full-length HLA genes to separate alleles at heterozygous loci. The approach avoids any ambiguities from sequencing heterozygous PCR products directly and also avoids ambiguities from sequencing overlapping PCR products to achieve full-length sequence. To date we have sequenced full-length genomic sequences from representatives of all the major HLA-B and -C allele groups.
