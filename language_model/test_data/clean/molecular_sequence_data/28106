Oncomodulin is a small calcium-binding protein normally found only in extra-embryonic tissues such as the placenta, but whose presence in a variety of tumors has been documented. We have isolated the oncomodulin gene from a Buffalo rat genomic library. The rat gene is approximately 9000 bases in length and consists of five exons and four introns. The introns interrupt the coding sequence of oncomodulin in positions identical with those previously reported for the parvalbumin gene, indicating that the two genes are derived from a common ancestor. Analysis of the promoter sequence of the oncomodulin gene revealed that the gene is under the control of a solo long terminal repeat element related to intracisternal-A particles, a family of endogenous retroviral elements. This represents a unique example of a mammalian gene transcribed in normal and tumor cells, from a promoter of viral origin.
