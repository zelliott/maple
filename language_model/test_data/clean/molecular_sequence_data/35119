Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), which causes adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) in humans, establishes a life-long latent infection. Current therapies are not very effective against HTLV-1-associated disorders. A novel therapeutic approach may help to combat HTLV-1 infection. A molecular therapy that targets the proviral genome is favorable because the therapeutic effect occurs specifically in HTLV-1-infected cells, regardless of whether they express viral genes. In this proof-of-concept study, we developed a therapeutic molecule based on zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) to achieve this goal. We designed a ZFN that specifically recognized conserved region of HTLV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) and introduced it into various HTLV-1-positive human T-cell lines, including HTLV-1-transformed and ATL-derived cell lines. The ZFN disrupted the promoter function of HTLV-1 LTR and specifically killed HTLV-1-infected cells. We also showed a potential approach of this therapeutic molecule to remove the proviral genome from HTLV-1-infected cells, something that has not been possible before. The therapeutic effect of ZFN was confirmed in an in vivo model of ATL. This strategy may form the basis of a therapy that can eradicate HTLV-1 infection. Similar approaches can be used to target other malignancy-associated viruses.
