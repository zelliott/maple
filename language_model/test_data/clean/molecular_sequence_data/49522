Single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was performed on genomic DNA from 97 human breast cancer samples and 10 breast cell lines to screen for mutations in the single exon C/EBPD gene. Three C --> T transitions resulting in silent mutations were detected in three individual breast cancer samples. One breast cancer sample also contained a G --> T transversion (Q253H). The SUM-52PE cell line contained an A --> T transversion (AAG --> TAG) resulting in a nonsense mutation (K180Stop). All mutations identified in genomic DNA isolates were in highly conserved regions of the C/EBPD gene. This study indicates that mutational alterations in the coding region of the C/EBPD gene are relatively uncommon in human breast cancer.
