The gene of Listeria monocytogenes that encodes a major extracellular protein (p60) was cloned in Escherichia coli. The gene was designated iap, as p60 was previously shown to represent an invasion-associated protein (M. Kuhn and W. Goebel, Infect. Immun. 57:55-61, 1989). The recombinant E. coli clone expressed p60, as shown by immunoblotting. The complete nucleotide sequence of iap was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of p60 (484 amino acids) contains a putative N-terminal signal sequence of 27 amino acids and an extended repeat region consisting of 19 threonine-asparagine units. Hybridization with the entire iap gene revealed the presence of homologous sequences in most other Listeria species. In contrast, a 400-base-pair internal iap probe which contained the whole repeat region hybridized only with genomic DNA from L. monocytogenes. Four oligonucleotides previously described as specific probes for the detection of L. monocytogenes (A. R. Datta, B. A. Wentz, D. Shook, and M. W. Trucksess, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 54:2933-2937, 1988) were shown to be part of the iap gene.
