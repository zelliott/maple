The major ethanol-active form of chicken liver alcohol dehydrogenase was characterized. The primary structure was determined by peptide analysis and, to a large part, was also deduced by cDNA analysis of a near full-length cDNA clone. The latter was detected by screening of a chicken liver cDNA library with antibodies raised against the purified dehydrogenase. The structure shows that the avian enzyme exhibits characteristics of the complex mammalian alcohol dehydrogenase system, tracing its origin and divergence, and allowing functional correlations. The chicken protein analyzed proves to be a class I alcohol dehydrogenase, with 74% residue identity to gamma chains of the human enzyme, a Km for ethanol of 0.5 mM and a Ki for 4-methyl pyrazole of 2.5 microM. Relationships to the other two classes are non-identical; residue exchanges towards the human classes increase in the order I less than III less than II, and human/chicken differences are less than inter-class differences. Consequently, the origins of the classes are more distant than the avian/mammalian separation. They reflect duplicatory events separated in time, and the lines that lead to present-day classes I and II deviate early. Integrated with the data for the quail enzyme, the structure of the chicken protein shows that within the avian enzymes the degree of variation is comparable to that within the mammalian class I enzymes, which are more variable than the class III forms. The coenzyme-binding and substrate-binding residues of this chicken alcohol dehydrogenase are largely identical to those in the mammalian class I counterparts. However, the subunit-interacting areas are more variable and suggest some relationships of the avian enzyme with both class I and III mammalian forms. One of the residues, Gly260 (mammalian class I numbering system), previously considered characteristic of all alcohol dehydrogenases, is replaced by Gln.
