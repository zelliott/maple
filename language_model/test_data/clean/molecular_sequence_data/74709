The development of fermentative yeasts secreting no organic acids is highly desirable for ethanol production coupled with membrane separation processes, because the acidic byproduct, succinic acid, significantly inhibits the membrane permeation of ethanol. Of the Pichia and Candida yeasts tested, Candida krusei IA-1 showed the highest ethanol productivity [55 g L(-1) day(-1) from 150 g L(-1) (w/v) of glucose], comparable to the strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and produced much less of the acid (0.6 g L(-1) day(-1)) than the Saccharomyces strains (1.5-1.8 g L(-1) day(-1)) under semi-aerobic conditions. Interestingly, under aerobic conditions, strain IA-1 showed no production of the acid. Stain IA-1 exhibited a good assimilation of the acid, while S. cerevisiae NBRC 0216 showed no assimilation. The activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in strain IA-1 was 37.5 mU mg(-1), and 7.8-fold higher than that in S. cerevisiae strain NBRC 0216. More significantly, SDH1 was abundantly transcribed in strain IA-1, different from that in strain NBRC 0216, regardless of the culture conditions. From these results, C. krusei IA-1 efficiently takes up succinic acid and metabolizes it in the Krebs cycle, producing an extremely low level of byproducts in the culture medium. Therefore, C. krusei is not only a promising alternative to S. cerevisiae but also a suitable model for metabolic engineering of S. cerevisiae.
