We previously reported the characterization of a rabbit uterus cDNA clone (SMHC29) which encoded part of the light meromyosin of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (Nagai, R., Larson, D.M., and Periasamy, M. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 1047-1051). We have now characterized a second cDNA clone (SMHC40) which also encodes part of the light meromyosin but differs from SMHC29 in the following respects. Nucleotide sequence analysis demonstrates that the two myosin heavy chain mRNAs are identical over 1424 nucleotides but differ in part of the 3'-carboxyl coding region and a portion of the 3'-nontranslated sequence. Specifically, SMHC40 cDNA encodes a unique stretch of 43 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus, whereas SMHC29 cDNA contains a shorter carboxyl terminus of 9 unique amino acids which is the result of a 39-nucleotide insertion. Recent peptide mapping of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain identified two isotypes with differences in the light meromyosin fragment that were designated as SM1 (204 kDa) and SM2 (200 kDa) type myosin (Eddinger, T. J., and Murphy, R.A. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 3807-3811). In this study we present direct evidence that SMHC40 and SMHC29 mRNA encode the two smooth muscle myosin heavy chain isoforms, SM1 and SM2, respectively, by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against specific carboxyl terminus sequences deduced from SMHC40 and SMHC29 cDNA clones.
