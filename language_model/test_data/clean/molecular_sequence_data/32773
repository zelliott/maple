Mycothiol (MSH) [1-D-myo-inosityl-2-(N-acetyl-l-cysteinyl)amido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranoside], isolated as the bimane derivative, was established to be the major thiol in Nocardia sp. strain NRRL 5646, a species most closely related to Nocardia brasiliensis strain DSM 43758(T). Thiol formation and detection of MSH-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase activity in cell extracts are relevant to the possible modulation of nitric oxide toxicity generated by strain NRRL 5646.
