Noroviruses (NoV) in 78 wastewater samples from Luxembourg were quantified, cloned, and sequenced in 2008-2009. The concentrations of NoV genogroup II and the relative occurrences of certain genotypes changed significantly during the winter season. NoV genogroup I was frequently detected by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), albeit at 30-fold lower concentrations than for genogroup II, hampering attempts to assess overall genetic diversity by the cloning/sequencing approach.
