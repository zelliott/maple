Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), a key signaling adaptor molecule common to the TNFR superfamily and IL-1R/TLR family, is important not only for a diverse array of physiological processes functions of the TNFR superfamily, but also is involved in adaptive immunity and innate immunity. In this report, the first bivalve TRAF6 (named as CfTRAF6) gene is identified and characterized from Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri. The full-length cDNA of CfTRAF6 is of 2510bp, consisting of a 5'-terminal untranslated region (UTR) of 337bp, a 3'-terminal UTR of 208bp with a canonical polyadenylation signal sequence AATAAA and a poly (A) tail, and an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 655 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence of CfTRAF6 comprises characteristic motifs of the TRAF proteins, including a Zinc finger of RING-type, two Zinc fingers of TRAF-type, a coiled-coil region, and a MATH (the meprin and TRAF homology) domain. The overall amino acid sequence identity between CfTRAF6 and other TRAF6s is 28-68%. Phylogenetic analyses of CfTRAF6 sequence with TRAF sequences from other organisms indicate that CfTRAF6 is a true TRAF6 orthologue. The mRNA expression of CfTRAF6 in various tissues is measured by Real-time RT-PCR. The mRNA transcripts are constitutively expressed in tissues of haemocyte, muscle, mantle, heart, gonad and gill, but the highest expression is observed in the gonad. The temporal expressions of CfTRAF6 mRNA in the mixed primary cultured haemocytes are recorded after treatment with 20 microg mL(-1) and 0.5 microg mL(-1) peptidoglycan (PGN). The expression level of CfTRAF mRNA is down-regulated from 1.5h to 3h after the treatment with 0.5 microg mL(-1) PGN, and then recovers to the original level. While the expression of CfTRAF6 is obviously decreased after treatment with 20 microg mL(-1) PGN, and reach the lowest point (only about 1/9 times to control) at 3h. The result suggests that CfTRAF6 can be greatly regulated by PGN and it may be involved in signal transduction and immune response of scallop.
