A simple method for the detection of specific RNA-polypeptide interactions using MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy is described. Instead of direct observation of the RNA-polypeptide complex, we attempted the indirect observation of the binding event by focusing on the disappearance of the free polypeptide signal upon interaction with RNA. As a result, specific binding of the Rev-response element (RRE) RNA of the HIV with two RRE-binding peptide aptamers, DLA and RLA peptides, as well as the bacteriophage lambda boxB RNA with the lambda N peptide was observed. We also show that specific RNA-binding peptides can be identified from a mixture of peptides with varying RNA-binding affinity, showing that the method could be applied to high-throughput screening from simple peptide libraries. The method described in this study provides a quick and simple method for detecting specific RNA-polypeptide interactions that avoids difficulties associated with direct observation of RNA and RNA-polypeptide complexes, which may find various applications in the analysis of RNA-polypeptide interactions and in the identification of novel RNA-binding polypeptides.
