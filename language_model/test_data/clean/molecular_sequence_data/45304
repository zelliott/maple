Insertional mutagenesis and envelope (Env)-mediated oncogenesis are hypothesized mechanisms by which Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) causes ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA). Twenty-eight JSRV integration sites in lung tumors (LTs) from four sheep with OPA were cloned and sequenced by a multiple step gene walking technique. Using nested PCR, clonal expansion of these integration sites could be detected, if at all, only in the localized regions of LT from which the integration sites were derived. One sheep had a viral integration site in a sequence with 85 and 81% identity, respectively, over 100 bp to exon 2 of the human and mouse receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase gamma genes. Clonal integration of Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus in this gene was demonstrated by nested PCR and Southern blot hybridization in the DNA sample from which the integration site was cloned, but not in other LT or kidney DNA samples from the same sheep. OPA may develop from multiple independent oncogenic events and a role for insertional mutagenesis cannot be ruled out.
