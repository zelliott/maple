Loss of DCC gene expression has now been demonstrated in a wide variety of metastatic cancers. Here we present the nucleotide sequence and predicted amino acid sequence of mouse DCC. Mouse and human DCC share 96% identity at the amino acid level. Analysis of DCC mRNA expression throughout the mid and late stages of gestation in the mouse, demonstrated that DCC mRNA is expressed at significantly higher levels in the developing mouse embryo than in any adult tissue. In addition, we show that an embryo-specific, alternatively spliced, form of DCC is expressed in day 9.5 through day 18.5 embryos. The expression of both alternatively spliced forms of DCC is developmentally regulated such that the embryonic form of DCC predominates in day 9.5 and 10.5 embryos. In the later stage embryos the expression of this alternatively spliced form of DCC is down-regulated with respect to that of the adult form. Whole-mount in situ hybridization of day 11.5 mouse embryos revealed that DCC mRNA is expressed at high levels in the developing brain and the neural tube. However, no DCC mRNA could be detected in any other embryonic tissue at this stage of development. These observations suggest that during embryogenesis DCC may play a pivotal role in the development of the central nervous system.
