The distribution of the nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1) alleles from human strain AU-1 and canine strain K9 among rotaviruses of human, feline, canine, bovine, and simian origin was studied by a dot blot hybridization assay. Human and feline strains belonging to the AU-1 genogroup had the same NSP1 allele, while canine and feline strains belonging to the canine-feline genogroup shared another NSP1 allele. This canine-feline NSP1 allele had a significant level of homology with the NSP1 of rhesus rotavirus strain MMU18006.
