The human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus that causes adult T cell leukemia and the neurological disorder tropical spastic paraparesis. Pathology apparently results from the activities of the Tax protein, which trans-activates the expression of viral and cellular genes by binding to various enhancer-binding proteins needed for transcription. This ultimately results in cell transformation, immortalization and disease.
