Several genes of Plasmodium falciparum are positively selected due to the pressure from the host immune system. This is a pattern completely opposite to that found in most housekeeping genes, which have few synonymous mutations. The discrepancy is an important topic in Plasmodium biology. We searched for unique polymorphism patterns in P. falciparum and identified a repetitive Stuttering motif in PFI1780w which was recently grouped as a gene in the PHIST family. The repeat has a position-specific polymorphism pattern in the otherwise highly conserved gene. Its mutations are limited to only one small region, and they are not consistent with replication slippage or gene conversion commonly found in low complexity regions. The repeat variation was analyzed in different strains of P. falciparum. The PFI1780w Stuttering motif can be a model to study gene diversification and used as a tool for strain typing.
