Loss of tonB1 adversely affects iron acquisition and intrinsic multidrug resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Several mutations in tonB1 compromised the protein's contribution to both processes, although TonB1 derivatives altered in residues C35, Q268, R287, Q292, R300, and R304 were compromised vis-Ã -vis their contribution to drug resistance only.
