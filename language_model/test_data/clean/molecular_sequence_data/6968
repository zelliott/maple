Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was applied to the epsilon subunit of the F1-F0 ATP synthase from E. coli. Nineteen amino acid residues were changed to alanine, either singly or in pairs, between residues 10 and 93. All mutants, when expressed in the epsilon deletion strain XH1, were able to grow on succinate minimal medium. Membranes were prepared from all mutants and assayed for ATP-driven proton translocation, ATP hydrolysis +/- lauryldiethylamine oxide, and sensitivity of ATPase activity to N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD). Most of the mutants fell into 2 distinct classes. The first group had inhibited ATPase activity, with near normal levels of membrane-bound F1, but decreased sensitivity to DCCD. The second group had stimulated ATPase activity, with a reduced level of membrane-bound F1, but normal sensitivity to DCCD. Membranes from all mutants were further characterized by immunoblotting using 2 monoclonal antibodies. A model for the secondary structure of epsilon and its role in the function of the ATP synthase has been developed. Some residues are important for the binding of epsilon to F1 and therefore for inhibition. Other residues, from Glu-59 through Glu-70, are important for the release of inhibition by epsilon that is part of the normal enzyme cycle.
