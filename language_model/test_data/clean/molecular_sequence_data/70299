Investigation of the large POU domain family of developmental regulators has revealed a molecular mechanism by which highly related transcription factors sharing common DNA-binding motifs act to functionally discriminate their cognate DNA sequences. Studies of two classes of neuron-specific POU domain factors (III and IV) indicate that functional specificity on their native response elements is achieved by accommodating different nucleotide spacing between variably oriented bipartite core DNA-binding motifs. The preferred orientation of the POU-specific domain of the neuronal factors on their native response elements appears to be opposite that of Pit-1 and Oct-1. Members of POU-III (Brn-2) class exhibit remarkable flexibility in DNA site recognition (tolerating core motifs spaced by 0, 2, or 3 nucleotides), whereas POU-IV (Brn-3) class is highly constrained (tolerating core motifs with a spacing of 3 nucleotides). The molecular determinant of the constraint in DNA site selection appears to be imparted by 3 amino acid residues in the amino-terminal basic region in concert, with helix 2 of the POU homeo domain which together are involved in minor groove and possibly phosphate backbone contacts. Similar mechanisms may underlie differential flexibility in spacing and orientation for diverse families of transcription factors.
