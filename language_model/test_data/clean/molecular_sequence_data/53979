The G (VP7) and P (VP4) serotype distribution of Brazilian porcine rotaviruses was determined using reverse transcription-PCR genotyping methods. Common porcine G types G3, G4, and G5 were detected in combination with P types [6] and [7]. The detection of nonporcine G types and unusual G-P combinations and the characterization of an atypical virus indicated that interspecies transmission may contribute to the genetic diversity of porcine rotaviruses.
