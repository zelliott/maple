Heterocysts, cells specialized in nitrogen fixation in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, lose the potential for cell division once fully differentiated. This suggests that cell division activity is differentially regulated in heterocysts and vegetative cells. FtsZ has been shown to play a crucial role in bacterial cell division. Two degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed to detect, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), an ftsZ homologue from the heterocystous cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. A PCR-amplified DNA fragment was cloned and used as a probe to isolate the entire ftsZ gene of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. The deduced amino acid sequence shares strong similarities with other FtsZ proteins, suggesting remarkable conservation of the FtsZ protein during evolution. An ORF downstream of ftsZ, which would be transcribed in the opposite direction compared to ftsZ, could encode a polypeptide with significant sequence similarity to the glutathione synthetase from Escherichia coli. Inactivation experiments in vivo for both ftsZ and the glutathione synthetase gene did not yield any double recombinants either in the presence or in the absence of combined nitrogen, suggesting that both genes are essential for cell growth under these conditions.
