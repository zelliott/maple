A rapid detection method was developed for DNA polymorphisms in the human lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene. The examined polymorphisms include an A-C transversion in the 5'-region of intron 3, a T-G transversion that occurs within a Hind III site of intron 8, and the previously described C-T transition that causes a Pvu II polymorphism in intron 6. Gene fragments encompassing each polymorphic site were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and digested with an appropriate restriction enzyme whose recognition site was either naturally affected by the polymorphism or artificially created with a mismatched PCR-primer. According to the digestion profiles, genotypes were unambiguously distinguished. With this method, respective allelic frequencies were determined for 50 or 70 normal subjects. The procedure will facilitate LPL genotyping in the large population.
