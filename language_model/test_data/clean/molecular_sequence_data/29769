We report the identification of a new serine/threonine phosphatase from Plasmodium falciparum at the DNA and protein levels. A 1.8 kb cDNA fragment encoding the protein phosphatase was identified via PCR amplification. The sequence has a coding capacity of 594 amino acids. Immunoblot analysis of P. falciparum extracts showed that antibodies generated against the His(6)-fusion protein recognise a protein of approximately 80 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence shares 55% identity with a mouse protein, identified as Protein Phosphatase 5 (PP5). We show that the P. falciparum PP5 homologue (PfPP5) has all structural and functional characteristics of this class of enzymes. It contains three tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) and a nuclear targeting sequence at its N-terminus and a highly conserved C-terminal catalytic domain. Southern blot results are compatible with the existence of PfPP5 as a single copy gene. Purified recombinant protein, like the native protein enriched from P. falciparum extracts exhibited phosphatase activity that can be enhanced by both arachidonic and oleic acids, but not by myristic or stearic acid. In addition, the activity is inhibited by okadaic acid (OA) with an IC(50) of 4 nM. Immunofluorescence microscopy has localised PfPP5 preferentially to the nucleus. The function of PfPP5 is presently unclear, but like other PP5s of many eukaryotic organisms, it may have important regulatory functions in the parasite cell cycle.
