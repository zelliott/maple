The interaction between four Crotalus atrox hemorrhagic metalloproteinases and human alpha 2-macroglobulin was investigated. The proteolytic activity of the hemorrhagic toxins Ht-c, -d, and -e against the large molecular weight protein substrates, gelatin type I and collagen type IV, was completely inhibited by alpha 2-macroglobulin. The proteolytic activity of Ht-a against the same substrates was not significantly inhibited. Each mole of alpha 2-macroglobulin bound maximally 2 mol of Ht-e and 1.1 mol of Ht-c and Ht-d. These proteinases interacted with alpha 2-macroglobulin rapidly at 22 degrees C. Rate constants based on intrinsic fluorescence measurements were 0.62 X 10(5) M-1 s-1 for interaction of alpha 2-macroglobulin with Ht-c and -d and 2.3 X 10(5) M-1 s-1 for the interaction of alpha 2-macroglobulin with Ht-e. Ht-a interacted with alpha 2-macroglobulin very slowly at 22 degrees C. Increasing the temperature to 37 degrees C and prolonging the time of interaction with alpha 2-macroglobulin resulted in the formation of Mr 90,000 fragments and high molecular weight complexes (Mr greater than 180,000), in which Ht-a is covalently bound to the carboxy-terminal fragment of alpha 2-M. The identification of the sites of specific proteolysis of alpha 2-macroglobulin shows that the cleavage sites for the four metalloproteinases are within the bait region of alpha 2-macroglobulin. Ht-c and -d cleave only at one site, the Arg696-Leu697 peptide bond, which is also the site of cleavage for plasmin, thrombin, trypsin, and thermolysin. Ht-a cleaves alpha 2-macroglobulin primarily at the same site, but a secondary cleavage site at the His694-Ala695 peptide bond was also identified.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
