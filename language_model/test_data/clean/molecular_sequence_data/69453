A unique group of large icosahedral viruses that infect a unicellular green alga (Chlorella sp. NC64A) were isolated from freshwater sources in Japan. These viruses contain a linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome with hairpin ends. A physical map was constructed for the genomic DNA of CVK1 (Chlorella virus isolated in Kyoto, no. 1) by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of restriction fragments. The nucleotide sequences around both termini of the CVK1 DNA revealed the presence of inverted terminal repeats (ITR) of approximately 1.0 kb. Adjacent to the ITR, unique sequence elements of 10 to 20 bp were directly repeated 20 to 30 times in tandem array. Several copies of these repeat elements were deleted in virus mutants that were occasionally generated from Chlorella cells that were in a putative CVK1 carrier state. These repeats might represent a hot spot of rearrangement in the CVK1 genome.
