Position 18 in a parathyroid hormone (PTH) antagonist, [Nle8,18,Tyr34]bPTH(7-34)NH2 (ii), was shown to tolerate substitutions by a range of amino acids with retention of inhibitory activity. The effects of hydrophobic substitutions at this position as a means of enhancing binding interactions with the receptor were evaluated. Substitution of Nle at position 18 with either D-Ala, D-Trp, or L-Trp in analog ii or with Trp (D or L) in the recently reported, highly potent antagonist, [Nle8,18,D-Trp12,Tyr34]bPTH(7-34)NH2 (in vitro activities; Kb = 15 nM and Ki = 125 nM), was performed. In terms of activity on renal receptors, one antagonist, [Nle8,D-Trp12,18,Tyr34]bPTH(7-34)NH2, is the most active in vitro PTH antagonist yet reported (Kb = 4 nM; Ki = 30 nM). The rationale for design of this antagonist and the conclusions regarding PTH-receptor interactions are discussed.
