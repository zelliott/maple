In the mammalian central nervous system, a diverse group of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins is involved in the determination of progenitor cells and, subsequently, in regulating neuronal differentiation. Here we report the identification of a novel subfamily of bHLH proteins, defined by two mammalian enhancer-of-split- and hairy-related proteins, termed SHARP-1 and SHARP-2. In contrast to known bHLH genes, detectable transcription of SHARP genes begins at the end of embryonic development marking differentiated neurons that have reached a final position, and increases as postnatal development proceeds. In the adult, SHARP genes are expressed in subregions of the CNS that have been associated with adult plasticity. In PC12 cells, a model system to study neurite outgrowth, SHARP genes can be induced by NGF with the kinetics of an immediate-early gene. Similarly, within 1 h after the administration of kainic acid in vivo, SHARP-2 is induced in neurons throughout the rat cerebral cortex. This suggests that neuronal bHLH proteins are also involved in the "adaptive" changes of mature CNS neurons which are coupled to glutamatergic stimulation.
