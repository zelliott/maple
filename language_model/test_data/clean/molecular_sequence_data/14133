The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the bcr/abl transcript as a marker of minimal residual disease (MRD) in 76 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) subjected to allogeneic BMT and in complete hematological remission. We examined 56 patients transplanted in chronic phase (CP) and 20 in advanced phase (AD), including 16 in accelerated phase and four in blastic transformation. A total of 135 samples collected between 4 and 105 months from BMT were analyzed and the PCR analysis was positive in 33 (24%) samples from 20 patients. The bcr/abl chimeric transcript was detected in 7/13 (54%) patients analyzed within 1 year and in 21/88 (23%) beyond 1 year from BMT. Fluctuation of the residual disease at the molecular level in individual patients was recorded. The results have been correlated with a number of clinical parameters obtained before and after BMT; among the tested variables only the phase of the disease at BMT was associated with higher frequency of PCR positivity after BMT. The probability of finding persisting disease 1 year beyond BMT was significantly higher (P = 0.00005) in patients allografted in AD (14/26, 54%) as compared to patients grafted in CP (7/62, 11%). At any interval from BMT the difference between the two groups remained statistically significant: the bcr/abl transcript was present in 5/31 patients transplanted in CP compared to 9/15 patients transplanted in AD (P = 0.003) between 12 and 36 months from BMT, and in 2/31 CP vs 5/11 AD patients (P = 0.008) beyond 36 months from BMT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
