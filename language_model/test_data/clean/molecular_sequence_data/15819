The amino-acid sequence from the bilin binding protein (BBP) of the butterfly Pieris brassicae has been determined. The apoprotein with a length of 173 amino-acid residues has a molecular mass of 19,676 Da. The sequence analysis was performed by automated Edman degradation of the intact apoprotein and of fragments as large as possible generated from different digestions. The 3-dimensional structure of BBP, determined by Huber et al. (Huber, R., Schneider, M., Epp, O., Mayr, I., Messerschmidt, A., Pflugrath, J. & Kayser, H. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 195, 423-434 and Huber, R., Schneider, M., Mayr, I., MÃ¼ller, R., Deutzmann, R., Suter, F., Zuber, H., Falk, H. & Kayser, H. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 198, 499-513) down to 2-A resolution, exhibits a similar conformation to the human retinol binding protein. Sawyer (Sawyer, L. (1987) Nature (London) 327, 659) demonstrated that proteins from a wide variety of sources can be gathered into a "superfamily". Computer searches of data banks yielded in a new member of this superfamily, namely human alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. One of the functions of the listed proteins is to bind and transport small hydrophobic molecules in serum.
