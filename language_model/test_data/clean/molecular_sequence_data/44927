The SRP54 and SR alpha subunits of the signal recognition particle (SRP) and the SRP receptor (SR) undergo a tightly coupled GTPase cycle that mediates the signal sequence-dependent attachment of ribosomes to the Sec61 complex. Here, we show that SRP54 and SR alpha are in the empty site conformation prior to contact between the SRP-ribosome complex and the membrane-bound SR. Cooperative binding of GTP to SRP54 and SR alpha stabilizes the SRP-SR complex and initiates signal sequence transfer from SRP54 to Sec61 alpha. The GTP-bound conformations of SR alpha and SRP54 perform distinct roles, with SR alpha performing a predominant role in complex stabilization. Hydrolysis by both SRP54 and SR alpha is a prerequisite for dissociation of the SRP-SR complex.
