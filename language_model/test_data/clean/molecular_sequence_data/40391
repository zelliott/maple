A Gram-stain-positive, neutrophilic, rod-shaped bacterium, strain A1g(T), was isolated from activated sludge of a bioreactor and was subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic characterization. The isolate grew in the presence of 0-17.0 % (w/v) NaCl and at pH 6.0-9.0; optimum growth was observed in the presence of 3.0-5.0 % (w/v) NaCl and at pH 7.0. Strain A1g(T) was motile, formed cream-coloured colonies, was catalase- and oxidase-positive and was able to hydrolyse aesculin, Tween 40 and Tween 60. Chemotaxonomic analysis revealed menaquinone-7 as the predominant respiratory quinone and anteiso-C₁₅:₀, anteiso-C₁₇:₀, iso-C₁₆:₀ and iso-C₁₅:₀ as major fatty acids. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain A1g(T) was 36.3 mol%. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the new isolate belonged to the genus Oceanobacillus and exhibited closest phylogenetic affinity to the type strains of Oceanobacillus oncorhynchi subsp. incaldanensis (97.9 % similarity) and O. oncorhynchi subsp. oncorhynchi (97.5 %), but less than 97 % sequence similarity with respect to the type strains of other recognized Oceanobacillus species. Levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain A1g(T) and reference strains O. oncorhynchi subsp. incaldanensis DSM 16557(T), O. oncorhynchi subsp. oncorhynchi JCM 12661(T) and Oceanobacillus iheyensis DSM 14371(T) were 29, 45 and 38 %, respectively. On the basis of phenotypic and genotypic data, strain A1g(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Oceanobacillus, for which the name Oceanobacillus neutriphilus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is A1g(T) (=CGMCC 1.7693(T) =JCM 15776(T)).
