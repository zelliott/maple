The genome of Clostridium acetobutylicum 824 contains two genes encoding NAD+, Mn2+, and dithiothreitol-dependent phospho-alpha-glucosidases that can be assigned to family 4 of the glycosylhydrolase superfamily. The two genes, designated malh (maltose 6-phosphate hydrolase) and pagl (phospho-alpha-glucosidase), respectively, reside in separate operons that also encode proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent:sugar phosphotransferase system. C. acetobutylicum grows on a variety of alpha-linked glucosides, including maltose, methyl-alpha-d-glucoside, and the five isomers of sucrose. In the presence of the requisite cofactors, extracts of these cells readily hydrolyzed the chromogenic substrate p-nitrophenyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside 6-phosphate, but whether hydrolysis reflected expression of enzymes encoded by the malh or pagl genes was not discernible by spectrophotometric analysis or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Resolution of this question required the cloning of the malh and pagl genes, and subsequent high expression, purification, and characterization of maltose-6'-phosphate hydrolase (MalH) and phospho-alpha-glucosidase (PagL), respectively. MalH and PagL exhibit 50% residue identity, and in solution are tetramers comprising similar sized ( approximately 50 kDa) subunits. The two proteins cross-react with polyclonal rabbit antibody against phospho-alpha-glucosidase from Fusobacterium mortiferum. Purified MalH and PagL cleaved p-nitrophenyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside 6-phosphate with comparable efficiency, but only MalH catalyzed the hydrolysis of disaccharide 6'-phosphates formed via the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent:sugar phosphotransferase system. Importantly, analysis of the proteome of C. acetobutylicum 824 by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry confirmed expression of MalH during growth on many alpha-glucosides tested. Site-directed changes C169S and D170N yielded full-length, but catalytically inactive MalH. Of the two putative operons, our findings suggest that only proteins encoded by the mal operon participate in the dissimilation of maltose and related O-alpha-linked glucosides by C. acetobutylicum 824.
