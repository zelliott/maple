The complete sequence of the rat immunoglobulin gamma 2c heavy chain constant region has been determined by cDNA cloning and by mRNA sequencing. Comparison with other heavy chain genes reveals a high degree of homology (87%) to mouse gamma 3 and suggests that rat and mouse gamma genes separated from a common set of three ancestral genes.
