The human carboxypeptidase M (CPM) gene was found to encompass about 112.6 kb of genomic sequence, containing 11 exons of which eight (exons 2-9) are common to all transcripts and contain the entire coding region. We have cloned several alternative variants of CPM transcripts that result from differential promoter usage and alternative splicing. Although CPM belongs to the same metallocarboxypeptidase subfamily as CPE, their intron/exon structures differ significantly. Multiple transcription start sites were found in the CPM gene that cluster in two regions separated by about 30 kb and are flanked by two unique functional promoters. One ('proximal') is immediately upstream of the coding region and contains GC-rich sequences and a typical TATA box whereas the other ('distal') consists almost entirely of repetitive elements. Luciferase reporter assays with constructs of the promoter regions showed they were both quite active in several cell lines. However, the proximal promoter was much stronger than the distal one in two of the human cell lines tested (HepG2 and HEK293) whereas both promoters were highly and equally active in the human monocytic cell line THP-1, which has high constitutive expression of CPM.
