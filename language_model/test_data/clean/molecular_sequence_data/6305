The HtrA(DegP) 48-kDa serine protease of Escherichia coli is indispensable for bacterial survival at elevated temperatures. It contains the amino-acid sequence Gly208AnsSerGlyGlyAlaLeu, which is similar to the consensus sequence GlyAspSerGlyGlyProLys surrounding the active Ser residue of trypsin-like proteases. Mutational alteration of Ser210 eliminated proteolytic activity of HtrA. An identical effect was observed when His105 was mutated. The mutated HtrA were unable to suppress thermosensitivity of the htrA bacteria. These results suggest that Ser210 and His105 may be important elements of the catalytic domain and indicate that the proteolytic activity of HtrA is essential for the survival of cells at elevated temperatures.
