cDNA surveying is a straightforward approach for identifying sequences in genomic clones expressed in specific tissues. It has been applied to a subchromosomal region of human chromosome 19 (19q13.2-q13.4), a region that contains several known expressed sequences including the locus for myotonic dystrophy (DM). Genomic clones were selected from this region by probing a human placental cosmid library with a chromosome 19q-specific minisatellite sequence, or human genomic clones were isolated from a cosmid library constructed from a human chromosome 19q13.2-q13.3 hamster hybrid cell line using human repetitive DNA as probe. Pooled cDNAs synthesized from RNA of specific tissues characteristically affected in DM were depleted in repetitive sequences and used as hybridization probes against gridded cosmid arrays. DNA from the cDNA-positive cosmid clones was transferred to nylon filters and reprobed with cDNAs to identify restriction fragments that were expressed in these tissues. Hybridizing restriction fragments were subcloned, sequenced, and demonstrated to be nonrepetitive. Primer pairs complementary to subcloned sequences were constructed and used for PCR amplification of cDNA synthesized from RNA of tissues affected in myotonic dystrophy. PCR products were sequenced to verify the identity of expressed genomic DNA and its corresponding cDNA.
