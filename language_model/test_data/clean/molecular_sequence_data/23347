Proteasomes are energy-dependent proteases that are central to the quality control and regulated turnover of proteins in eukaryotic cells. Dissection of this proteolytic pathway in archaea, however, has been hampered by the lack of substrates that are easily detected in whole cells. In the present study, we developed a convenient reporter system by functional expression of a green fluorescent protein variant with C-terminal fusions in the haloarchaeon Haloferax volcanii. The levels of this reporter protein correlated with whole-cell fluorescence that was readily detected in culture. Accumulation of the reporter protein was dependent on the sequence of the C-terminal amino acid fusion, as well as the presence of an irreversible, proteasome-specific inhibitor (clasto-lactacystin beta-lactone). This inhibitor was highly specific for H. volcanii 20S proteasomes, with a Ki of approximately 40 nM. In contrast, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride did not influence the levels of fluorescent reporter protein or inhibit 20S proteasomes. Together, these findings provide a powerful tool for the elucidation of protein substrate recognition motifs and the identification of new genes which may be involved in the proteasome pathway of archaea.
