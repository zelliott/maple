A quantitative real-time PCR assay was developed to measure the proviral load of human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The HTLV-I copy number was referred to the actual amount of cellular DNA by means of the quantitation of the albumin gene. Ten copies of HTLV-I DNA could be detected with 100% sensitivity, and the assay had a wide range of at least 5 log(10). Intra- and inter-assay reproducibility was evaluated using independent extractions of PBMCs from an HTLV-I-infected patient (coefficients of variation, 24 and 7% respectively). The performance of this TaqMan PCR assay, coupled with its high throughput, thus allows reliable routine follow-up of HTLV-I proviral load in infected patients. Preliminary results using clinical samples indicate a higher proviral load in patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis than in asymptomatic carriers, and also suggest the usefulness of this quantitative measurement to assess the etiological link between HTLV-I and adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma-like syndromes.
