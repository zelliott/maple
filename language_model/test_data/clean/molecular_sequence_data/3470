We report the isolation and expression patterns of aristaless (al), a paired-type homeobox gene, of Gryllus bimaculatus (Gb), a hemimetabola model insect. Gryllus al (Gbal) is expressed in the most distal region of developing labrum, antenna, mandible, maxilla, labium, leg, cercus, and hindgut. Gbal is also expressed in the proximal region, corresponding to the presumptive coxopodite, of the developing antenna, mandible, maxilla, labium, and leg, but not in the developing labrum, cercus, and hindgut. During development of the leg, expression of Gbal changes dynamically with the progress in leg segmentation: Gbal is expressed in order in the presumptive pretarsus, coxa, femur, tibia and tarsus before appearance of morphological segmentation.
