Bcl-2 homologues (such as Bcl-x(L)) promote survival in part through sequestration of "activator" BH3-only proteins (such as Puma), preventing them from directly activating Bax. It is thus assumed that inhibition of interactions between activators and Bcl-x(L) is a prerequisite for small molecules to antagonize Bcl-x(L) and induce cell death. The biological properties, described here of a terphenyl-based alpha-helical peptidomimetic inhibitor of Bcl-x(L) attest that displacement of Bax from Bcl-x(L) is also critical. Terphenyl 14 triggers Bax-dependent but Puma-independent cell death, disrupting Bax/Bcl-x(L) interactions without affecting Puma/Bcl-x(L) interactions. In cell-free assays, binding of inactive Bax to Bcl-x(L), followed by its displacement from Bcl-x(L) by terphenyl 14, produces mitochondrially permeabilizing Bax molecules. Moreover, the peptidomimetic kills yeast cells that express Bax and Bcl-x(L), and it uses Bax-binding Bcl-x(L) to induce mammalian cell death. Likewise, ectopic expression of Bax in yeast and mammalian cells enhances sensitivity to another Bcl-x(L) inhibitor, ABT-737, when Bcl-x(L) is present. Thus, the interaction of Bcl-x(L) with Bax paradoxically primes Bax at the same time it keeps Bax activity in check, and displacement of Bax from Bcl-x(L) triggers an apoptotic signal by itself. This mechanism might contribute to the clinical efficiency of Bcl-x(L) inhibitors.
