We have cloned an alphoid DNA fragment, pBS4D, from the DNA of a human-hamster hybrid cell line containing chromosome 2 as its only cytologically detectable human component. Under high stringency conditions, pBS4D hybridized in situ mostly to chromosome 2 and to a lesser extent to chromosomes 18 and 20. Restriction analysis using the DNA from selected somatic hybrid cell lines revealed that the genomic organization of this alphoid DNA differs on each of these three chromosomes.
