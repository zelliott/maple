XRCC4 is a generally expressed protein of 334 amino acids that is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and in V(D)J recombination, but its function is unknown. In this study, we have used a mutational approach and the yeast two-hybrid method to perform an initial characterization of this protein. We show that the XRCC4 protein is located in the nucleus. We also demonstrate that several potential phosphorylation sites are not required for XRCC4 function in a transient V(D)J recombination assay. In addition, we show that XRCC4 forms a homodimer in vivo with the homodimerization domain being located within amino acids 115-204. Finally, we define a core domain of XRCC4 that functions in V(D)J recombination and comprises amino acids 18-204. Potential functions of XRCC4 are discussed.
