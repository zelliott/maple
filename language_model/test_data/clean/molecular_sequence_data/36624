A recent systematic study of porcine motilin fragments has clearly shown that biological activity resides in the amino-terminal end. The amino-terminal tetradecapeptide retains more than 90% of the potency of the full molecule. We now examined the effect of replacement of residues 1 through 11 by either their D-isomer or by alanine in [Leu13]pMOT(1-14). Peptides were synthesized using Fmoc solid phase methodology, purified by HPLC, and assayed for their ability to displace bound motilin (rabbit antral smooth muscle homogenate) and to induce contractions (isolated rabbit duodenal segments). The negative logarithm of the concentration displacing 50% of the tracer (pIC50), or producing 50% of the maximal contractile response (pEC50), was determined. All compounds were still full agonists. A reduction in potency of more than two log units was seen for the compounds in which residues 1 (Phe), 4 (Ile), and 7 (Tyr) were replaced by Ala and residues 3 (Pro), 4 (Ile), and 6 (Thr) by their D-isomer. The largest drop was noted for the analogs substituted at position 4. For all compounds there was an almost perfect correlation between the pIC50 and the pEC50 values (r = 0.96), although the pEC50 was consistently smaller. These results show that the biological activity of motilin is mainly determined by the first seven residues. The pharmacophore consists of the aromatic rings from Phe1 and Tyr7 and the aliphatic side chains from Val2 and Ile4. Pro3, Phe5, and Thr6 may stabilize the bioactive conformation.
