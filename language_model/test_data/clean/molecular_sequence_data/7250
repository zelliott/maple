The recF gene from Azotobacter vinelandii (Av) has been cloned by complementation in an Escherichia coli (Ec) recF mutant. The sequence of 1568 bp has been determined and analyzed. It showed an open reading frame of 1092 nt coding for a 364-amino-acid (aa) polypeptide. The comparison of the deduced aa sequence of the recF of Av with those of other bacteria has elicited the presence of the four conserved domains thought to be essential for RecF function. A transcriptional fusion of a DNA fragment containing the promoter sequence of recF with the lacZ gene of Ec was constructed and 3-4-fold enhancement of promoter activity was observed upon UV induction.
