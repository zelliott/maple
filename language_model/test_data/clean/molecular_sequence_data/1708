We analyzed cell division patterns during the differentiation of unisexual flowers of the dioecious plant Silene latifolia using in situ hybridization with histone H4 and cyclin A1 genes. The gene expression patterns indicated that the activation of cell divisions in whorls 3 and 4 was reversed in young male and female flower buds. During maturation of flower buds, a remarkable reduction in cell division activity occurred in the male gynoecium primordium and female stamen primordia. Our analyses showed that differential activation and reduction of cell division strongly correlated with sex-specific promotion and cessation in the sex differentiation of unisexual flowers.
