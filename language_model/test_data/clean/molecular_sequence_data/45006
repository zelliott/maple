Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421 is a unique cyanobacterium that has no thylakoids and whose genome has been sequenced [Y. Nakamura, T. Kaneko, S. Sato, M. Mimuro, H. Miyashita, T. Tsuchiya, S. Sasamoto, A. Watanabe, K. Kawashima, Y. Kishida, C. Kiyokawa, M. Kohara, M. Matsumoto, A. Matsuno, N. Nakazaki, S. Shimpo, C. Takeuchi, M. Yamada, S. Tabata, Complete Genome Structure of Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421, a cyanobacterium that lacks thylakoids. DNA Research 10 (2003) 137-145]. Phycobilisomes of G. violaceus were isolated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by N-terminal sequencing. Three rod-linker subunits (CpeC, CpeD and CpeE) were identified as predicted from the genome sequence. The cpcC1 and cpcC2 genes at order locus named (OLN) glr0950 and gll 3219 encoding phycocyanin-associated linker proteins from G. violaceus are 56 and 55 amino acids longer at the N-terminus than the open reading frame proposed in the genome. The two amino acid extensions showed a 66% identity to one another. Also, the N-terminal extensions of these sequences were similar to domains in both the rod-capping-linker protein CpcD2 and to the C-terminus domain of the phycoerythrin-associated linker protein CpeC. These domains are not only unusual in their N-terminal location, but are unusual in that they are more closely related in sequence similarity to the C-terminus domain of the phycoerythrin-associated linker, CpeC of G. violaceus, than to the C-terminus domain of phycocyanin-associated linker CpcC in other cyanobacteria. These linker proteins with unique special domains are indicators of the unusual structure of the phycobilisomes of G. violaceus.
