This study was designed to analyze two candidate genes, myocilin (MYOC) and cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1), in a Chinese pedigree of juvenile glaucoma with goniodysgenesis.

In a three-generation family of juvenile glaucoma with goniodysgenesis (13 members), six of them were patients with glaucoma and the rest were asymptomatic. All members of the family underwent complete ophthalmologic examinations. Exons of MYOC and CYP1B1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, sequenced, and compared with a reference database.

Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and visual function impairment was found in all patients, and goniodysgenesis was noticed in five of them (nine eyes) with relatively transparent corneas. One MYOC heterozygous mutation, c.1109 C>T (P370L), in exon 3 was identified in all six patients but not in the asymptomatic family members. Two CYP1B1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), g.3947 C>G (R48G) in exon 2 and 372-12 C>T in intron 1, were identified in all six patients and but not in the asymptomatic family members except the proband's grandmother. Three SNPs were identified, 730 + 35 A>G in intron 2 of MYOC and g.8131 G>C (V432L) and g.8184 T>C (D449D) in exon 3 of CYP1B1.

The presence of a P370L mutation of MYOC in all six glaucoma patients suggests a casual association between this mutation and juvenile glaucoma with goniodysgenesis. The possible role of SNPs of CYP1B1 in the pathogenesis of the disease remains to be elucidated.
