The complete nucleotide sequence of the capsular gene cluster (cap8) responsible for the biosynthesis of the capsular polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 8 has been determined. The cap8 gene cluster, located between the genes dexB and aliA, is composed of 12 open reading frames. A 14.7-kb DNA fragment embracing the cap8 genes was sufficient to transform an unencapsulated type 3 S. pneumoniae strain to a strain with the type 8 capsule. A possible scenario for the evolution of pneumococcal types 2 and 8 is outlined.
