The promoter region driving the gene for the 170-kDa heavy subunit of the Entamoeba histolytica galactose-inhibitable lectin was analysed by transient transfection using the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene as reporter. S1 mapping confirmed our previous notion that the promoter is located within a 1.35-kb intergenic sequence preceding the structural lectin gene. Transcripts derived from the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene of transfected trophozoites were found to be polyadenylated and the transcriptional start mapped to a position similar to that of the wild-type lectin gene. By deletion analysis the entire promoter was restricted to a fragment covering about 550 bp upstream from the start of transcription. On the other hand, residual promoter activity required a sequence of about 140 bp only, encompassing a newly identified CCAAT-box like element around position -100, as well as the amebic specific TATA-box. This 140-bp fragment as well as a stretch of 15 bp, which is located some 100 nt further upstream, were found to be conserved within the 5' noncoding region of a second E. histolytica lectin gene. Point-mutation analyses indicated that the 15-bp fragment, the likely CCAAT-box, as well as the TATA-box are required for full promoter activity.
