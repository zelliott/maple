Remodeling of the plant cell surface occurs during the establishment of cell polarity, cellular differentiation, and organ development. This report demonstrates the existence of multiple glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins in the model plant Arabidopsis. Using two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), we also show that GPI-anchored proteins are a relatively abundant class of protein and that they are present at the plant plasma membrane. Furthermore, some of these proteins are released into the extracellular matrix. At least one of these is an arabinogalactan protein (AGP), a class of proteins known to be associated with cellular differentiation. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of two novel AGP-like proteins from Arabidopsis predicts that these proteins contain consensus signals for GPI-anchor addition. These findings support a model where GPI-anchored proteins are involved in the generation of specialized cell surfaces and extracellular signaling molecules.
