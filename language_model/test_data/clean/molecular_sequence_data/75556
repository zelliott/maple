The nucleotide sequences of insertion sequences IS3411L (left) and IS3411R (right), present as direct terminal repeats in the citrate utilization of citrate utilization transposon Tn3411, and of IS3411 (generated by intramolecular recombination between IS3411L and IS3411R) were determined. The three IS3411 elements (IS3411R, IS3411L, and IS3411) were 1,309 base pairs long and identical in DNA sequence. IS3411 had 27-base-pair terminal inverted repeats with three bases mismatched and one long open reading frame (240 amino acids) that was proposed to be a transposase. Three polypeptides of 29,000, 27,000, and about 10,000 molecular weight, determined by IS3411, were identified in minicells. Since Tn3411 generates a 3-base-pair repeat upon integration, the nucleotide sequences of IS3411 were compared with those of IS3.
