A highly conserved 40-nucleotide sequence was identified. Two completely conserved sequences, TAGATT and TAAACT, separated by 17 nucleotides resemble the consensus sequence recognized by the Escherichia coli major sigma factor and sequence found in other chlamydial promoters. In addition, the adenine-rich sequence present in many chlamydial promoters was also conserved upstream of the putative -35 element. These findings suggest that the conserved sequence may play a role in the regulatory function at the transcriptional level. Multiple ATG codons were found at the 5'-terminal region of the chlamydial sigA ORFs except for Chlamydia pneumoniae, although the putative Shine-Dargarno sequence was absent.
