Models of the lectin-homology domains of the human and murine low-affinity receptors for IgE (Fc epsilon RII/CD23) were built on the basis of sequence similarity with rat mannose-binding protein, the structure of which is known. The sites on Fc epsilon RII/CD23 that are possibly involved in the interaction with IgE and with another ligand, CD21/CR2, are proposed. The models may assist the design of protein engineering experiments for the study of the reactivity of these molecules.
