Desmoglein is a major adhesive component of the desmosome. It is also at least one of the antigenic targets of pathogenic antibodies circulating in the sera of patients with the blistering disease Pemphigus foliaceus. To examine the molecular basis of desmosomal adhesion and to further our understanding of its disruption in various bullous disorders we have cloned cDNAs encoding four of the extracellular domains of desmoglein. The predicted amino acid sequence of these clones shows extensive homology with the cadherin class of calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules. Desmoglein represents a novel subtype of this family.
