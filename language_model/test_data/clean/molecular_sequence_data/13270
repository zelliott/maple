In this study, a battery of oligonucleotides was directed toward the katG gene and PCR-single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was used to search for katG gene deviations in clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from different geographical regions. Since a complete deletion of the katG gene was not found, it is suggested that deletion is not a major mechanism of isoniazid (isonicotinic acid hydrazide; INH) resistance in these isolates. However, 7 of 39 isolates (4 of 25 from South Africa and 3 of 14 from other geographical regions) showed mobility shifts by SSCP analysis, suggesting aberrations in the katG gene. Direct sequence analysis confirmed that the mobility shifts were due to Thr-275-->Ala (Thr275Ala), Arg409Ala, Arg463Leu, and Asp695Ala mutations and a 12-bp deletion in the 5' region of the katG gene. Mutations at codons 275, 463, and 695 created altered restriction sites for HhaI, MspI, and HaeIII, respectively, and sequence results, supported by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, suggested that the PCR-SSCP procedure is a good indicator of mutations in PCR-amplified fragments. Identical mutations at codons 463 and 275 were found in isolates from different geographical regions. This may suggest a common evolutionary event, but one of the control isolates (susceptible to INH [3%; n = 30]) also had a mutation at codon 463. The results suggest that variations in the katG coding gene sequences of INH-resistant isolates of M. tuberculosis are infrequent and that defects in other regions of the M. tuberculosis genome are of equal or greater importance in contributing to the acquisition of resistance to INH.
