A calcium-independent phosphatidylserine specific binding protein detected on liposome blotting analysis was purified from rat brain and revealed to be identical to myristoylated, alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS). MARCKS specifically binds to phosphatidylserine but not phosphatidylcholine. The binding of MARCKS to phosphatidylserine was abolished on protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation. Since bacterially expressed MARCKS also specifically binds to phosphatidylserine, myristoylation of the N-terminal glycine seems not to be essential for the binding of MARCKS to phosphatidylserine. These data suggest that phosphatidylserine is a membranous target molecule of MARCKS.
