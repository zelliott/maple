Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) has recently been identified as a modulator of neuronal plasticity and can initiate conversion of the pro-form of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) into its mature form. BDNF also increases t-PA gene expression implicating t-PA as a downstream effector of BDNF function. Here we demonstrate that BDNF-mediated induction of t-PA mRNA requires an increase in t-PA gene transcription. Reporter constructs harboring 9.5 kb of the human t-PA promoter conferred BDNF-responsiveness in transfected mouse primary cortical neurons. This regulation was recapitulated in HEK 293 cells coexpressing the TrkB neurotrophin receptor. t-PA promoter-deletion analysis revealed the presence of two BDNF-responsive domains, one located between -3.07 and -2.5 kb and the other within the proximal promoter. The upstream region was shown to confer BDNF responsiveness in a TrkB-dependent manner when attached to a heterologous promoter. We also identify homologous regions within the murine and bovine t-PA gene promoters and demonstrate that the equivalent upstream murine sequence functions as a BDNF-responsive enhancer when inserted 5' of the human proximal t-PA promoter. Hence, BDNF-mediated induction of t-PA transcription relies on conserved modular promoter elements including a novel upstream BDNF-responsive domain and the proximal t-PA gene promoter.
