Variation in the adhesive protein gene sequences of Mytilus edulis, M. galloprovincialis, and M. trossulus collected in Delaware, Kamaishi (Japan), and Alaska, respectively, was analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using two sets of oligonucleotide primers. The first set, Me 13 and Me 14, was designed to amplify the repetitive region. The length of the amplified fragments was highly variable, even among samples of the same species. Another set, Me 15 and Me 16, was designed to amplify a part of the nonrepetitive region. The length of the amplified fragments was uniform in each species and differed interspecifically; 180, 168, and 126 bp for M. edulis, M. trossulus, and M. galloprovincialis, respectively. The amplified sequence of M. trossulus resembled that of M. edulis. Mussels from other sites were also examined by PCR using Me 15 and Me 16. Wild mussels from Troms√∂ (Norway) and cultured mussels from Brittany (France) were identified as M. edulis. Cultured mussels from the Mediterranean coast of France and wild mussels from Shimizu (Japan) were identified as M. galloprovincialis. Some wild mussels from Hiura (Japan) were identified as a hybrid between M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus. Thus, the length of this part (variable region) of the sequence is proposed as a diagnostic marker for these three morphologically similar species and their hybrids.
