Protein phosphatase 1 holoenzymes are composed of catalytic subunits in combination with various regulatory subunits. In rodents, four different catalytic isoforms are known, PP1c alpha, -delta, -gamma 1, and -gamma 2. Here we describe the genomic organization of the murine Ppp1cc gene that encodes the PP1c gamma 1 and PP1c gamma 2 isoforms. We determined that Ppp1cc maps to F1.2-G1.2 on chromosome 5 by FISH mapping. Southern hybridization and analysis of cross-hybridizing genomic clones revealed four Ppp1cc-related pseudogenes in the mouse genome. The authentic Ppp1cc gene encodes two isoforms, PP1c gamma 1 and PP1c gamma 2, that arise from alternative splicing and differ by retention of the last intron. The introns of Ppp1cc are flanked by short direct repeats, the significance of which is not clear. Both isoforms retain phosphatase function since they are able to complement the cold-sensitive PP1 defect caused by the dis2-11 mutation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
