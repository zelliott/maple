The complete amino acid sequence of the lectin from Bothrops jararacussu snake venom (BJcuL) is reported. The sequence was determined by Edman degradation and amino acid analysis of the S-carboxymethylated BJcuL derivative (RC-BJcuL) and from its peptides originated from enzymatic digestion. The sequence of amino acid residues showed that this lectin displays the invariant amino acid residues characterized in C-type lectins. Amino acids analysis revealed a high content of acidic amino acids and leucine. These findings suggest that BJcuL, like other snake venom lectins, possesses structural similarities to the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of calcium-dependent animal lectins belonging to the C-type beta-galactoside binding lectin family.
