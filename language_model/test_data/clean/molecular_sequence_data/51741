A full-length cDNA for a rat type II activin receptor was cloned by hybridization from a rat ovary cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequence (513 residues) containing a single membrane-spanning domain and an intracellular kinase domain with predicted serine/threonine specificity. The amino acid sequence is 99.8% and 99.4% identical in the coding region with the previously cloned mouse and human type II activin receptor, and only 66.7% identical in the coding region with the previously cloned rat type IIB activin receptor. We examined the effect of PMSG-hCG on the mRNA level of type II activin receptor in immature rat ovaries. Northern blot analysis of ovarian RNA revealed two mRNAs (3.0 kb and 6.0 kb).
