The gdhA gene encoding the NADP-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase activity from Penicillium chrysogenum has been isolated and characterized for its use in gene expression. The nucleotide sequence of a 2816-bp genomic fragment was determined, showing an open reading frame of 1600 bp interrupted by two introns, of 160 bp and 57 bp respectively, with fungal consensus splice-site junctions. The predicted amino acid sequence revealed a high degree of identity to glutamate dehydrogenase enzymes, especially to those from the fungi Aspergillus nidulans (82%) and Neurospora crassa (78%). The gdhA gene was found to be present in a single copy in the genome of several P. chrysogenum strains with different penicillin productivity. The use of the gdhA promoter for homologous and heterologous gene expression in fungi and Escherichia coli was analyzed. Heterologous gene expression was ascertained by the construction of gene fusions with the lacZ gene from E. coli and the bleomycin-resistance determinant (bleR) from Streptoalloteichus hindustanus. Homologous gene expression was shown through the use of the penicillin-biosynthetic genes pchC and penDE from P. chrysogenum and the cephalosporin biosynthetic genes cefEF and cefG from Acremonium chrysogenum.
