We cloned and characterized a Plasmodium vivax repeat element of 7872bp named PvRE7.8. Several internal tandem repeats were found along the sequence. The repetitive nature of the PvRE7.8 element was confirmed by hybridization of a P. vivax YAC library. Based on the data bank analysis and the presence of two contiguous putative genes that may encode proteins related to DNA metabolism, PvRE7.8 could be considered an inactivated transposon-LINE element. By using Pv79 as probe or primers derived from Pv79-flanking sequences, P. vivax DNA Could be detected from whole blood and mosquito samples. We consider that the repeat element described here has potential for P. vivax malaria diagnosis and for epidemiological analysis of P. vivax transmission areas.
