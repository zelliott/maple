The post-heparin plasma contains two lipolytic enzymes. This review deals with the lesser known, hepatic triglyceride lipase. Like lipoprotein lipase, H-TGL is a glycoprotein and has an optimal pH of 8-9. But it does not require an activator protein and its activity is not inhibited by NaCl or protamine sulfate. Synthesized by the hepatocytes, H-TGL is located at the hepatic vascular endothelium. It catalyses the hydrolysis of a wide variety of lipid substrates including triacylglycerol and phospholipids. The function of the enzyme is still not fully known. H-TGL may function in the clearance of triglyceride rich lipoprotein remnants and in the catabolism of HDL.
