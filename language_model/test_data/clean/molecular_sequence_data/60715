Dynorphin A, the endogenous agonist for the kappa opioid receptor, has been studied by NMR spectroscopy in methanol, acetonitrile, DMSO and in mixtures of hexafluoroacetone/water and DMSO/water. NMR data in the DMSO/water cryomixture at 278 K are consistent with a conformer in which the N-terminal part, like the corresponding message domain of enkephalins, is poorly ordered, whereas the C-terminal part is folded in a loop centred around Pro10. The folded structure of the C-terminal part (address moiety) may shed light on the role of the essential residues Arg7, Lys11 and Lys13.
