The gene MUC3 which codes for a mucin expressed in intestine (Gum et al. 1990) has previously been mapped, using somatic cell hybrids, to chromosome 7. We describe here the regional localization of MUC3 to chromosome 7q22 by in situ hybridization. Preliminary linkage analysis using CEPH (Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain) families supports this assignment and places MUC3 in the same linkage group as COL1A2 and CFTR.
