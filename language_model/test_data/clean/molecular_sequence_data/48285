The earliest known H+-PPase (proton-pumping inorganic pyrophosphatase), the integrally membrane-bound H+-PPi synthase (proton-pumping inorganic pyrophosphate synthase) from Rhodospirillum rubrum, is still the only alternative to H+-ATP synthase in biological electron transport phosphorylation. Cloning of several higher plant vacuolar H+-PPase genes has led to the recognition that the corresponding proteins form a family of extremely similar proton-pumping enzymes. The bacterial H+-PPi synthase and two algal vacuolar H+-PPases are homologous with this family, as deduced from their cloned genes. The prokaryotic and algal homologues differ more than the H+-PPases from higher plants, facilitating recognition of functionally significant entities. Primary structures of H+-PPases are reviewed and compared with H+-ATPases and soluble PPases.
