'Lysobacter enzymogenes ssp. cookii' was proposed by Christensen and Cook in 1978; however, this subspecies name has not been cited in the Approved Lists of Bacterial Names and therefore the nomenclature has not been validated. In our genetic approach to clarify the relationships of the designated type strain of 'L. enzymogenes ssp. cookii' PAGU 1119 (GenBank accession number ATCC29488) within the genus Lysobacter revealed that the strain was closely related to Lysobacter capsiciYC5194(T) (99.4%) rather than L. enzymogenesDSM2043(T) (97.2%). The value for whole genome DNA-DNA relatedness between strain PAGU 1119 and L. enzymogenes DSM 2043(T) or L. capsiciYC5194(T) was 20.7-26.1% or 60.9-62.0%, respectively. Although PAGU 1119 and L. capsiciYC5194(T) showed relatively high DNA relationships, the fatty acid profiles and some phenotypic characteristics were different, and we concluded that PAGU 1119 should be placed in a new species. We therefore propose a new species with the name Lysobacter cookii sp. nov. The type strain is PAGU 1119(T) (ATCC29488).
