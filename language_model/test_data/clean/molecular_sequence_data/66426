Glycolysis is the sole source of energy for the intraerythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum, making glycolytic enzymes putative therapeutic targets. Enolase, a single copy gene in P. falciparum is one such enzyme whose activity is elevated approximately 10-15 fold in infected RBC's. It holds the possibility of having multiple biological functions in the parasite and hence can be a suitable candidate for diagnostic and chemotherapeutic purposes.

We have aimed at generating parasite-specific reagents in the form of monoclonal antibodies. We have raised monoclonal antibodies against the recombinant P. falciparum enolase.

Two IgG monoclonals were obtained with 1:1000 titre and specific for P. falciparum enolase. Apicomplexan parasites including P. falciparum enolase has a plant like pentapeptide sequence (104EWGWS108) which is uniquely different from the host counterpart. A peptide spanning this pentapeptide region (ELDGSKNEWGWSKSK) coupled to BSA was used to raise parasite-specific antibody. Four monoclonals were obtained with 1:1000 titre and of IgM isotype.

All the monoclonals are specific for P. falciparum enolase and one of them display reactivity against native P. falciparum enolase signifying this pentapeptide to be surface exposed and immunogenic.
