We have cloned and sequenced the Lactobacillus casei hprK gene encoding the bifunctional enzyme HPr kinase/P-Ser-HPr phosphatase (HprK/P). Purified recombinant L. casei HprK/P catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of HPr, a phosphocarrier protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system at the regulatory Ser-46 as well as the dephosphorylation of seryl-phosphorylated HPr (P-Ser-HPr). The two opposing activities of HprK/P were regulated by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, which stimulated HPr phosphorylation, and by inorganic phosphate, which stimulated the P-Ser-HPr phosphatase activity. A mutant producing truncated HprK/P was found to be devoid of both HPr kinase and P-Ser-HPr phosphatase activities. When hprK was inactivated, carbon catabolite repression of N-acetylglucosaminidase disappeared, and the lag phase observed during diauxic growth of the wild-type strain on media containing glucose plus either lactose or maltose was strongly diminished. In addition, inducer exclusion exerted by the presence of glucose on maltose transport in the wild-type strain was abolished in the hprK mutant. However, inducer expulsion of methyl beta-D-thiogalactoside triggered by rapidly metabolizable carbon sources was still operative in ptsH mutants altered at Ser-46 of HPr and the hprK mutant, suggesting that, in contrast to the model proposed for inducer expulsion in gram-positive bacteria, P-Ser-HPr might not be involved in this regulatory process.
