A teichoic acid from the cell walls of Nocardioides luteus VKM Ac-1246T, a validly described species of the Nocardioides genus, is a 1,5-poly(ribitol phosphate) completely substituted at C-4 by alpha-D-galactopyranosyl residues carrying a 4,6-pyruvate ketal group in R-configuration. The structure of the repeating unit of the polymer is as follows: [figure]. The chain consists of approximately 18 repeating units and six beta-D-galactofuranosyl residues linked in the oligomer by 1,6-glycosidic bonds. The oligomer probably terminates the growing end of the teichoic acid. The structure of the polymer was determined by chemical methods and NMR spectroscopy. This teichoic acid has not been described so far.
