The conformational behavior of cyclic peptides of the amino acid sequence Cys-Phe/Ala-Pro-Ala-Cys has been investigated through the combined use of molecular simulation methods and NMR experiments to find models for beta-VIa turns of proteins. Both oxidized (cyclic) peptides and reduced (linear) forms were investigated. At least 95% of the cyclic peptides show a cis conformation of the Xaa-Pro bond in solution in DMSO or water, whereas all other peptide bonds are trans. Furthermore, we observed a hydrogen bond between the NH group of residue Ala4 and the C = O group of residue Cys1. Both properties are indicative of beta-VIa turns. After reduction of the disulfide bridge, the all-trans form of the peptide bonds predominates.
