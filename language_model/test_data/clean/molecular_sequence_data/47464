Cytosolic thioredoxin (Trx) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) comprise a ubiquitous system that uses the reducing power of NADPH to act as a general disulfide reductase system as well as a potent antioxidant system. Human and rat mitochondria contain a complete thioredoxin system different from the one present in the cytosol. The mitochondrial system is involved in the oxidative stress protection through a mitochondrial thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase. We report here the cDNA cloning and chromosomal localization of the mouse mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase gene (TrxR2). The mouse TrxR2 cDNA encodes for a putative protein of 527 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 57 kDa, that displays high homology with the human and rat counterparts. The N-terminus of the protein displays typical features of a mitochondrial targeting sequence with absence of acidic residues and abundance of basic residues. Mouse TrxR2 also contains a stop codon in frame at the C-terminus of the protein, necessary for the incorporation of selenocysteine that is required for enzymatic activity. The typical stem-loop structure (SECIS element) that drives the incorporation of selenocysteine is identified in the 3'-UTR. Northern analysis of the mouse TrxR2 mRNA shows a similar pattern of expression with the human homologue, with higher expression in liver, heart and kidney. Finally, we have assigned the mouse TrxR2 gene to chromosome 16 mapping at 11.2 cM from the centromer and linked to the catechol-o-methyltransferase (comt) gene.
