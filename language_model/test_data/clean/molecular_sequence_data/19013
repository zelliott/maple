Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of chronic liver diseases. Progress in the HCV field was greatly enhanced by constructing infectious cDNA clone of JFH-1. Since then, JFH-1-based intra- and intergenotypic recombinants have been developed, and this permitted the study of vaccines and antiviral inhibitors for all genotypes. Recently, highly efficient HCV culture systems have been established by using consensus sequence-based clones. We developed a novel strategy to construct infectious HCV cDNA clone by combining functional screening of sequences directly from a genotype 2a clinical isolate (PR63) and cell culture adaptation. Using JFH-1 cDNA as the starting backbone, we sequentially replaced the JFH-1 fragments with a sequence from the pools of PR63 sequences. Through engineering adaptive mutations that improve HCV infectivity, we finally established a full-length cell culture-derived infectious clone of PR63, named PR63cc, that could efficiently produce virus particles in Huh7-derived cells, with peak titers of 1.6 Ã— 10(5) focus-forming units/ml. The PR63cc could be neutralized by an anti-E2 antibody and inhibited by antiviral agents but appeared more resistant to an NS5A inhibitor than JFH-1. In summary, we developed a new approach to construct an infectious HCV cDNA clone that can produce viruses efficiently in cell culture. This approach could be applied to other viral isolates, with potential implications for individualized treatments of HCV patients.
