We have unexpectedly found that Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI) and some other similar serine protease inhibitors produced by Streptomycetes strongly inhibit Streptomyces griseus metallo-endopeptidase II (SGMP II) [Kajiwara, K. et al. (1991) J. Biochem. 110, 350-354]. In order to elucidate the mode of their unusual interaction with SGMP II in more detail, we prepared twelve kinds of SSI analogues, in which one or two amino acid residues in the peptide segment from Thr64 to Val74 of wild-type SSI had been replaced or deleted by site-directed mutagenesis, and determined the dissociation constants of their complexes with SGMP II. Six analogues among them showed dissociation constants one order of magnitude lower than that of the wild type. Three had higher values. The results suggest that at least some residues in this segment are interacting with SGMP II in the complex. We also prepared an SSI mutant in which the disulfide bridge between Cys71 and Cys101 had been eliminated by replacing the two Cys residues with Ser residues. This mutated SSI inhibited SGMP II as strongly as the wild-type SSI did. While peptide bonds in the wild-type molecule did not suffer from the hydrolytic action of SGMP II except those at the amino-terminal fragile portion, the Pro72-Met73 bond of the mutant was specifically cleaved by the enzyme. This peptide bond, therefore, seems to play the role of the reactive site in the interaction of SSI with SGMP II.
