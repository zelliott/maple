The capacity of carboxymethyl starch (CMS):Chitosan monolithic tablets to protect diamine oxidase and/or catalase therapeutic enzymes against simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and to control their delivery in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) was investigated. Enzyme formulations loaded with grass pea seedlings diamine oxidase (PSDAO) vegetal extract, catalase, or PSDAO associated to catalase, were obtained by direct compression. The CMS:Chitosan (1:1) matrix afforded a good gastric protection to PSDAO and to catalase, when each enzyme was formulated separately. Variable amounts of DAO were delivered in the SIF containing pancreatin, with maximal release reached at about 8h, a time convenient for tablets to attain the colon. Up to 50% of the initial enzymatic activity of catalase formulated with CMS:Chitosan was found after 8 h in SIF. For the CMS:Chitosan tablets of bi-enzymatic formulations containing PSDAO:Catalase, the releases of DAO and of catalase were synchronized. The hydrogen peroxide (product of DAO activity) was decomposed by the catalase liberated in the same SIF environment. The proposed formulations could allow novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases, intestinal cancers or pseudo-allergic reactions.
