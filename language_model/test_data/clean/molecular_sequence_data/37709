The propensity of isolates of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum to delete a segment of chromosome 9 has provided positional information that has allowed us to identify a gene necessary for cytoadherence. It has been termed the cytoadherence-linked asexual gene (clag9). clag9 encodes at least nine exons and is expressed in blood stages. The hydrophobicity profile of the predicted CLAG9 protein identifies up to four transmembrane domains. We show here that targeted gene disruption of clag9 ablated cytoadherence to C32 melanoma cells and purified CD36. DNA-induced antibodies to the clag9 gene product reacted with a polypeptide of 220 kDa in the parental malaria clone but not in clones with a disrupted clag9 gene.
