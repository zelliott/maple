A full-length dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODase) sequence was cloned from a Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoite cDNA library. The sequence was most similar to family 2 DHODases, and had a calculated molecular mass of 65.1 kDa. The full-length and two N-terminally truncated T. gondii DHODase sequences were expressed as recombinant proteins. One of the truncated sequences complemented a DHODase-deficient bacterial host.
