A degranulation inhibiting protein could be isolated from human plasma ultrafiltrate by a three-step purification method including ion-exchange chromatography, gelfiltration and affinity-chromatography. The protein was identified as complement factor D by means of sequence analysis. Its degranulation inhibiting activity was determined with regard to its effect on the FNLPNTL-induced lactoferrin secretion of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Complement factor D caused a dose-dependent decrease of the FNLPNTL-stimulated lactoferrin degranulation down to 34% of stimulated controls.
