We have used direct cDNA selection to isolate expressed sequences from a set of four overlapping YACs, spanning approximately 470 kb of the chromosomal interval 17q21 centromeric to BRCA1 gene. Thirty-eight nonoverlapping unique cDNA fragments were identified in this region. Twenty-two of the selected cDNAs showed complete identity with known genes and expressed sequence tags. Two of these cDNAs shared sequence homology with genes known to encode potential DNA binding motifs and hence could function in transcriptional regulation. The remaining 16 unique cDNA fragments showed no significant similarity to sequences in the databases and could potentially encode novel genes. Northern analysis of the novel cDNAs showed differential expression in various tissues, supporting the transcribed nature of these sequences. Our results place the gene for a G-protein coupled receptor (GPR2) previously mapped to 17q within a 400 kb region on 17q21.
