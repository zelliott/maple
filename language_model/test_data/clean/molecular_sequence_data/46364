Control of reproductive development in crustaceans requires neuropeptides, ecdysone and methyl farnesoate (MF). A major source of neuropeptides is the X-organ-sinus gland (XO-SG) complex located in the eyestalk ganglia of crustaceans. The other regulatory factors (either peptides or neuromodulators) are produced in the brain and thoracic ganglia (TG). Two other regulatory non-peptide compounds, the steroid ecdysone and the sesquiterpene MF, are produced by the Y-organs and the mandibular organs, respectively. In the current review, I have tried to recapitulate recent studies on the role of gonadal regulatory factors in regulating crustacean reproduction.
