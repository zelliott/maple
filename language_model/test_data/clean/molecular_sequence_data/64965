Fifty-eight outbreaks of Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) were observed in vaccinated chicken flocks in four Southwestern states of Nigeria between 1995 and 2000. Bursa samples from 40 flocks were found virus-positive in VP2-specific nested RT-PCR. Sequences of the hypervariable region of VP2 were compared to reference strains of the different IBDV variants including also 1988 isolates from Nigeria. Sequence analysis revealed that all 40 Nigerian isolates belonged to the very virulent (vv) variant. The maximum sequence diversity of 5.7% was higher than in all other vvIBDV sequences listed in Genbank (3.6%). Two clusters within Nigerian isolates are unique to this region. Serotype 1 IBDV was also detected in four symptomatic turkey flocks. The turkey isolates were found within 2 of the 3 VV-clusters of chicken isolates. Full length sequence of a turkey isolate (NIE009t) confirmed its close relation to vvIBDV strain D6948NET for both segment A (1.4% sequence diversity) and segment B (2.1%). Thus, turkeys should be considered susceptible to vvIBDV infection. The unusually high sequence diversity of vvIBDV may be an indication of a West-African origin of this virus, from where it spread to other continents.
