The structure of the O-antigenic polysaccharide (O-PS) component of the lipopolysaccharide produced by Yersinia enterocolitica serotype O:28 has been elucidated. From chemical methods involving glycose analysis, periodate oxidation, methylation and the use of one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, the O-PS was found to be a polymer of repeating branched hexasaccharide units composed of L-rhamnose (four parts), 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose (one part), and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galacturonic acid (one part) having the following structure:
