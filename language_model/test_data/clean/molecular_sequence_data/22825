Our knowledge of the gene coding for amelogenin, the major enamel protein, is mainly based on mammalian sequences. Only two sequences are available in reptiles. To know whether the snake sequence is representative of the amelogenin condition in squamates, we have studied amelogenin in two scincid lizards. Lizard amelogenin possesses numerous conserved residues in the N- and C-terminal regions, but its central region is highly variable, even when compared with the snake sequence. This rapid evolution rate indicates that a single squamate sequence was not representative, and that comparative studies of reptilian amelogenins might be useful to detect the residues which are really important for amelogenin structure and function. Reptilian and mammalian enamel structure is roughly similar, but no data support amelogenin being similarly expressed during amelogenesis. By performing in situ hybridization using a specific probe, we showed that lizard ameloblasts express amelogenin as described during mammalian amelogenesis. However, we have not found amelogenin transcripts in odontoblasts. This indicates that full-length amelogenin is specific to enamel matrix, at least in this lizard.
