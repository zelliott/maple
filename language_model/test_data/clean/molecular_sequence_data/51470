Using a monoclonal antibody directed against a synthetic pentadecapeptide corresponding to the N-terminus of the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) of Bombyx mori, we report the presence of immunoreactive molecules in a large number of median neurosecretory cells of the pars intercerebralis of the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria. These cells correspond to the A1 cell type which we show to contain also neuroparsins, a family of predominant neurohormones of the migratory locust. In contrast, PTTH-like molecules are absent from A2 cells of the pars intercerebralis which contain Locusta insulin-related peptide (LIRP). Developmental studies show the presence of PTTH-related substances in neurosecretory cells of Locusta migratoria from late embryogenesis to adult development, including ageing vitellogenic female adults.
