To investigate the genes related to the biosynthesis or accumulation of tetrodotoxin (TTX) in pufferfish, mRNA expression patterns in the liver from pufferfish, akamefugu Takifugu chrysops and kusafugu Takifugu niphobles, were compared by mRNA arbitrarily primed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RAP RT-PCR) with fish bearing different concentrations of TTX and its derivatives. RAP RT-PCR provided a 383 bp cDNA fragment and its transcripts were higher in toxic than non-toxic pufferfish liver. Its deduced amino acid sequence was similar to those of fibrinogen-like proteins reported for other vertebrates. Northern blot analysis and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) revealed that the cDNA fragment of 383 bp was composed of at least three fibrinogen-like protein (flp) genes, flp-1, flp-2 and flp-3. Relative mRNA levels of flp-1, flp-2 and flp-3 showed a linear correlation with toxicity of the liver for two pufferfish species.
