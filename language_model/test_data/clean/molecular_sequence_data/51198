The distribution coefficients of single- and double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides in a PEG 8000/phosphate two-phase system are a function of their chain length. Values of the distribution coefficients are in general agreement with a simple extension of a model for excluded volume effects (the "available volume model") which was applied previously to the distribution of proteins in this system. The current results therefore provide a second set of examples for molecules of very different geometry where the distribution added molecules is controlled by excluded volume interactions between those molecules and the PEG 8000 of the two-phase system.
