We have determined the nucleotide sequence of ribosomal 5S RNA from bovine liver. The comparison of this sequence with those from other eukaryotic sources shows that a common secondary structure model for all eukaryotic 5S rRNAs may exist. Analysis of the evolutionary conserved nucleotides in metazoan 5S rRNAs suggests that the tertiary interactions, proposed earlier for plant 5S rRNA, are also possible.
