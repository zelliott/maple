Although there is no genetic diversity in isolates of Mycobacterium leprae, the variance of tandem repeats in the rpoT gene was recently demonstrated. We have typed clinical isolates of M. leprae in Korea using difference of the tandem repeats in the rpoT gene. Among 69 patients, 65 Korean isolates (94.2%) demonstrated four copies of the 6 bp tandem repeat (GACATC) in the rpoT gene, and incidences of three copies were found in only two Koreans and two foreigners (2.9%, respectively).
