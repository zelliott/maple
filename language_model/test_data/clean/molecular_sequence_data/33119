The paper presents the results of the first isolation of the new influenza virus in Moscow and the Russian Federation, which was similar to the swine A/IIV-Moscow/01/2009(H1N1)swl strain isolated on May 24, 2009 from a Russian arrived in Moscow from the USA on May 19, 2009. The antigenic, biological, and molecular genetic properties of this virus were studied. The virus was isolated on MDCK and chick embryos, the hemagglutination titers being 1:8-1:16 AE; the infectious titers being 6.51g of the tissue cytopathogenic infective dose (TCID50) and 7.01g of the common infective dose (CID50). The virus was sensitive to arbidol, ribavirin, oseltamivir, and resistant to rimantadine. The complete virus genome was sequenced; the data were accepted to the Gen Bank on May 28, 2009 under GQ219584-GQ219590 and GQ202724. The significant gene substitution of neuraminidase Asp for Gly in position 451, which has been undetectable in any other strain published in the Gen Bank by the present time is unique only to A/IIV-Moscow/01/2009 (H1N1)swl. The virus has been deposited in the State Collection of Viruses, D. I. Ivanovsky Institute of Virology, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, under No. 2452 dated May 24, 2009.
