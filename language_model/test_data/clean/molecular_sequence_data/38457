We have determined the transcription start points (tsp) for recently identified Porphyromonas gingivalis W50 genes, kgp, rgpA, rgpB (formerly designated prtK, prtR, and prtRII respectively), fetB and the mcmAB operon. Alignment of the DNA upstream of these tsp and those from the literature has enabled us to identify consensus sequences that may represent a P. gingivalis promoter. There is a potential -10 hexamer sequence, 5'-TATATT-3' centred on average at -10/11 nt which is repeated at -19/20 nt and an upstream consensus, 5'-CAGAT(A/G)-3' which is centred at -39/40 nt.
