The highly conserved lysine residue in the putative hydrolytic ATP-binding motif of the yeast cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain was replaced with leucine. The mutation was generated by a two-stage transformation method designed for genomic site-directed mutagenesis. Preliminary observations show that the effects of this alteration on the cellular roles of dynein are indistinguishable from those of a disruption mutation in which the entire motor domain is not expressed.
