Penaeid shrimp aquaculture has suffered from many diseases, especially from viral origin such as white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). In an attempt to obtain antiviral-relevant proteins, two peptides with molecular masses at 73 and 75kDa were isolated from shrimp Penaeus monodon using affinity chromatography coupled with the purified WSSV or a fish iridovirus (Singapore grouper iridovirus, SGIV), and identified as hemocyanin by mass spectrometry. The results, using fish viruses capable of cell culture, showed for the first time that the hemocyanin had non-specific antiviral properties and no cytotoxicity against host cells.
