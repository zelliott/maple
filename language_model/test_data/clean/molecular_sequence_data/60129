We have shown that basement membrane (BM) collagen (type IV), and specifically the peptide CNYYSNSYSFWLASLNPER (a.a. 185-203), from the non-collagenous domain of the alpha3 chain inhibits PMN. We examined the role of this peptide on PMN damage to BM in a vessel wall model. The presence of the endothelial monolayer as well as treatment of PMN with the alpha3(IV) 185-203 peptide reduced damage to BM by non-activated but not by activated PMN. The damage inhibition is unique to the alpha3(IV) peptide and not exhibited by comparable alpha1(IV) and alpha2(IV) chain peptides. A shorter peptide alpha3(IV) 185-191, containing the -SNS- triplet, reduced damage, whereas the one lacking the triplet, residues 194-203, was not effective. The CD47-alphavbeta3 integrin complex is the receptor for the alpha3(IV) peptide. Incubation of PMN with CD47 reactive mAb followed by the alpha3(IV) peptide abolished its protective effect on BM damage.
