Five new ether-soluble resin glycosides (jalapins), simonins I-V, have been isolated from the roots of Ipomoea batatas and characterized on the bases of chemical and spectral data. Simonin I is the first example of resin glycoside with aromatic acid (trans-cinnamic acid) as a component organic acid.
