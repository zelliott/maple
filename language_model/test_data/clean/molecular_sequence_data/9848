In contrast to H-2d kappa light chain-deficient mice (kappa-/-), BALB/c (kappa+/+) mice fail to respond to kappa light chains (L kappa). This suggests that C kappa-specific T cells are tolerant to this self-antigen in kappa+/+ mice. To get insights into the cellular and molecular basis of this tolerance, we first characterized the presented L kappa-derived C kappa-peptidic region(s). Among a library of overlapping peptides spanning the whole C kappa sequence, only three consecutive peptides are recognized by CD4+ T cell hybridomas obtained in L kappa-immunized kappa-/- mice. This C kappa-peptidic region, which is also the only one containing the I-Ed-binding consensus motif, is immunogenic since it is able to prime lymph node cells of kappa-/- mice to subsequent in vitro proliferative response to either L kappa or kappa+/+ APC. Conversely, no kappa+/+ T cell proliferation is observed under the same conditions. Activation of our hybridomas by cells from central and peripheral lymphoid tissues reveals that this C kappa region is naturally expressed on BALB/c kappa+/+ APC. In addition to B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells are able to present this region. Taken together our data suggest that the described self-C kappa region is implicated in the C kappa-specific CD4+ T cell tolerization in BALB/c mice.
