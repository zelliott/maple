A clonal assay to determine the mutant frequency (MF) at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) locus in human lymphocytes has been used by a number of investigators to study exposure to mutagens and carcinogens in a variety of populations. We have studied hprt MF in 106 subjects (40 controls and 66 cases) enrolled in a case-control investigation of lung cancer. Epidemiological data collected included smoking history, intake of dietary micronutrients, and occupational and environmental exposures as well as medical history, all obtained from an interviewer-administered questionnaire. All subjects were also genotyped for the known polymorphism in glutathione S-transferase class mu (GST-mu). In analysis of cases and controls, hprt MF was not associated with age, smoking, the polymorphism in GST mu, dietary intake, occupational exposures, family history of cancer or usage of medications. Since MF and cloning efficiency (CE) are not independent when CE is low, further analysis in cases and controls with a CE greater than or equal to 30% (27 cases and 22 controls) was also conducted. In analysis of controls, hprt MF increased with age and was inversely associated with intake of folate and vitamins A and C. The presence of lung cancer was not associated with hprt MF. Thus, our study supports the previous observation that dietary components may affect the MF at the hprt locus.
