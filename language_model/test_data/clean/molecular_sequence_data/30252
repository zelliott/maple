A cDNA sequence homologous to the Brassica self-incompatibility locus specific glycoprotein (SLSG) sequence was isolated from stigmas of B. oleracea plants homozygous for the S5 allele. The nucleotide sequence of this cDNA was obtained and compared with the S6 allelic form of the SLSG. Evidence is presented which indicates that this sequence does not specify the self-incompatibility response of pollen.
