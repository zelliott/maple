Inflammation-mediated avidin gene expression in the chicken was studied using hybridization analysis, polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing. The results indicate the presence of avidin mRNA in the oviduct and intestine after Escherichia coli infection. The mRNA for the inflammation-induced avidin was mainly encoded by the avidin gene, but the avidin-related genes, avr2 and avr3, were also transcribed at a low level in the oviduct and intestine, respectively. Because avidin is also induced in the chicken oviduct by progesterone, our results indicate a multifactorial regulation of avidin gene expression.
