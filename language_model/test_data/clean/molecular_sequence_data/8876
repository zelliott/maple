Cathorops spixii is the most common venomous fish on the Brazilian coast. Apart from the involvement with defense against pathogens, the possible contribution of skin mucus components to the development of injuries caused by venomous fish species has not been investigated. Thus, the present study was conducted to gain a better understanding of the peptide and protein components of fish skin mucus and the sting venom from the catfish C. spixii. Our results show that sting venom and skin mucus have distinct constituents that distinguished them like structural proteins, chaperones, ion transport, carbohydrate metabolism, oxidoreductase, cell cycle and protein binding present in sting venom and like tropomyosin 3 isoform 2 and energy metabolim proteins in skin mucus. But in a group of common 13 proteins we identified and isolated a WAP65 protein. The peptide fractions caused more harmful effects, such as venular stasis, hemorrhage and changes in the arteriolar wall diameter, and the protein fractions produced a typical inflammatory process in post-capillary venules. And finally we showed for the first time the presence WAP65 in sting venom and skin mucus of C. spixii using LC/MS/MS and also we purified this protein in the sting venom. Wap65 shows inflammatory action, working at different doses inducing an increase in the number of leukocytes rolling and adhering to the endothelium.
