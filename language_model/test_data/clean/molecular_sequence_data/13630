Tetrameric carbonyl reductase of pig lung has been shown by cDNA cloning to be a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase family of enzymes. Construction of the carbonyl reductase cDNA in an expression vector yielded an abundant, enzymatically active enzyme in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity and shown to be structurally, immunologically and functionally similar to lung carbonyl reductase.
