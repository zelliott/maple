Vac8p is a multifunctional yeast protein involved in several distinct vacuolar events including vacuole inheritance, vacuole homotypic fusion, nucleus-vacuole junction formation and the cytoplasm to vacuole protein targeting pathway. Vac8p associates with the vacuole membrane via myristoylation and palmitoylation. Vac8p has three putative palmitoylation sites, at Cys 4, 5 and 7. Here, we show that each of these cysteines may serve as a palmitoylation site. Palmitoylation at Cys 7 alone provides partial function of Vac8p, whereas palmitoylation at either Cys 4 or Cys 5 alone is sufficient for Vac8p function. In the former mutant, there is a severe defect in the localization of Vac8p to the vacuole membrane, while in the latter mutants, there is a partial defect in the localization of Vac8p. In addition, our studies provide evidence that palmitoylation targets Vac8p to specific membrane subdomains.
