Canine babesiosis, caused by intra-erythrocytic Babesia, is a tick-borne disease of worldwide importance. No information on canine babesiosis has been documented in Tunisia. Detection and analysis of Babesia species from naturally infected dogs and ticks recovered from dogs were attempted by reverse line blot hybridization and nucleotide sequence analysis based on 18S rRNA gene. Out of 180 blood samples collected from domestic dogs in 4 villages situated in different bioclimatic zones, 12 were positive for Babesia canis vogeli. In addition, a total of 160 Rhipicephalus sanguineus were analysed; only one male was infected by B. canis vogeli. This is the first report on the detection of DNA belonging to B. canis vogeli in domestic dogs and in R. sanguineus in Tunisia.
