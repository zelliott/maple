Neutrophils and macrophages in cattle express a novel class of immunoglobulin Fc receptor, specific for bovine IgG2, termed boFcgamma2R. In cows, the ability of neutrophils to kill immunoglobulin-opsonized microorganisms appears to depend largely on this subclass. Although related to other mammalian FcgammaRs, boFcgamma2R belongs to a novel gene family that includes the human killer Ig-like receptor and FcalphaRI (CD89) proteins. In this study, we describe the presence and characterization of this novel class of FcgammaR in sheep. The comparative analysis of this novel FcgammaR has allowed us to begin an exploration of some immunological characteristic of ruminants.
