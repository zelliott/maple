Channel proteins are transmembrane symmetric (or pseudosymmetric) oligomers organized around a central ionic pore. We present here a molecular model of the pore forming structures of two channel proteins with different primary structures and oligomeric size: the voltage-sensitive sodium channel and the nicotinic cholinergic receptor. We report low-energy arrangements of alpha-helical bundles calculated by semiempiricial potential energy functions and optimization routines and further refined using molecular dynamics. The ion-conducting pore is considered to be a symmetric or pseudosymmetric homooligomer of 3-5 amphipathic alpha-helices arranged such that the polar residues line a central hydrophilic pathway and the apolar residues face the hydrophobic bilayer interior. The channel lining exposes either charged (Asp, Glu, Arg, Lys) or polar-neutral (Ser, Thr) residues. A bundle of four parallel helices constrained to C4 symmetry, the helix axis aligned with the symmetry axis, and the helices constrained to idealized dihedral angles, produces a structure with a pore of the size inferred for the sodium channel protein (area approximately 16 A2). Similarly, a pentameric array optimized with constraints to maintain C5 symmetry and backbone torsions characteristic of alpha-helices adopts a structure that appears well suited to form the lining of the nicotinic cholinergic receptor (pore area approximately 46 A2). Thus, bundles of amphipathic alpha-helices satisfy the structural, energetic, and dynamic requirements to be the molecular structural motif underlying the function of ionic channels.
