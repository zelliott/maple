Antisera from dengue patients and dengue virus infected rabbits recognized octapeptides corresponding to linear amino acid sequences in the envelope protein of dengue 2 (Jamaica 1409). Although no peptide was recognized by sera from all dengue infected hosts, two peptides (216LPLPWLPG223 and 448FSGVSWTM455) were recognized by sera from all dengue 2 infected rabbits. One of these 448FSGVSWTM455 was also recognized by sera from both the dengue 2 patients tested. No peptides were identified which reacted exclusively with all dengue 2 infected animals. Use of a mouse monoclonal antibody (1B7) enabled identification of two regions (50AKQPATLR57 and 127GKVVLPEN134) and possibly a third (349GRLITVNP356) in the envelope protein of dengue 2 likely to be involved in haemagglutination inhibition and virus neutralization in vitro.
