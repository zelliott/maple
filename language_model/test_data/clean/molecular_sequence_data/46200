Teleost fish store lipids among several tissues primarily as triacylglycerol (TG). Upon metabolic demand, stored TGs are hydrolyzed by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). In this study, two distinct cDNAs encoding HSL were isolated, cloned, and sequenced from adipose tissue of rainbow trout. The full-length cDNAs, designated HSL1 and HSL2, were 2562-bp and 2887-bp in length, respectively, and share 82% nucleotide identity. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the two HSLs derive from paralogous genes that may have arisen during a teleost-specific genome duplication event. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that HSL1 and HSL2 were differentially expressed, both in terms of distribution among tissues as well as in terms of abundance within selected tissues of juvenile trout. HSL1 and HSL2 mRNAs were detected in the brain, spleen, pancreas, kidney, gill, intestine, heart, and white muscle, but were most abundant in the red muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. HSL1 mRNA was more abundant than HSL2 mRNA in the adipose tissue, whereas HSL2 mRNA was more abundant than HSL1 mRNA in the liver. Short term fasting (4 weeks) increased HSL1 and HSL2 mRNA expression in the adipose tissue, but only HSL1 mRNA levels increased in the liver and the red muscle. During a prolonged fast (6 weeks), there was continued elevation of HSL1 and HSL2 mRNA levels in the liver and muscle; HSL mRNA expression in mesenteric fat declined, coincident with depletion of mesenteric fat mass. Refeeding fish reduced HSL expression to levels seen in continuously fed fish. These findings indicate that the pattern of HSL expression is consistent with the diverse lipid storage pattern of fish and suggest that distinct mechanisms serve to regulate differential expression of the two HSLs in tissues and during a progressive fast.
