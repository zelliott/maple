This study investigates whether insulin (a differentiation factor for lens epithelial cells) acts as a survival factor. In the absence of insulin, 6-day embryonic chicken lens epithelial explants undergo apoptosis as shown by changes in cell morphology, DNA fragmentation, and loss of trypan blue exclusion. Insulin inhibits these changes and promotes survival of the cells. Aurintricarboxylic acid suppresses the apoptosis of lens explants. In contrast to 6-day embryonic explants, 19-day embryonic explants survive in the absence of insulin, presumably due to an endogenous survival factor. To explore the mechanism of the action of insulin as a survival factor for 6-day embryonic lens explants, we compared the pattern of cell cycle markers (c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, p53, histone H3, thymidine kinase, and cyclin B) in both apoptotic and differentiating lens explants. In the presence of insulin, the expression of c-fos and c-jun was down-regulated after an initial induction. Expression of these genes was also induced in the absence of insulin, but mRNA levels remained elevated as the cells underwent apoptosis. In contrast, expression of c-myc, p53, histone H3, thymidine kinase, and cyclin B showed only minor differences in differentiating and apoptotic cells. Since c-fos and c-jun have been shown to play a role in apoptosis in other cell types, the ability of insulin to regulate expression of these genes may be central to its ability to act as a survival factor for lens epithelial cells.
