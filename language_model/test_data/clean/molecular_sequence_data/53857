The complete nucleotide sequence of putative glucoamylase gene gla1 from the basidiomycetous fungus Lentinula edodes strain L54 is reported. The coding region of the genomic glucoamylase sequence, which is preceded by eukaryotic promoter elements CAAT and TATA, spans 2,076 bp. The gla1 gene sequence codes for a putative polypeptide of 571 amino acids and is interrupted by seven introns. The open reading frame sequence of the gla1 gene shows strong homology with those of other fungal glucoamylase genes and encodes a protein with an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal starch-binding domain. The similarity between the Gla1 protein and other fungal glucoamylases is from 45 to 61%, with the region of highest conservation found in catalytic domains and starch-binding domains. We compared the kinetics of glucoamylase activity and levels of gene expression in L. edodes strain L54 grown on different carbon sources (glucose, starch, cellulose, and potato extract) and in various developmental stages (mycelium growth, primordium appearance, and fruiting body formation). Quantitative reverse transcription PCR utilizing pairs of primers specific for gla1 gene expression shows that expression of gla1 was induced by starch and increased during the process of fruiting body formation, which indicates that glucoamylases may play an important role in the morphogenesis of the basidiomycetous fungus.
