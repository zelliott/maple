DNA fragments of 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum', a feline heamobartonella pathogen, were detected from unfed Ixodes ovatus collected from vegetation in Hokkaido, Fukushima and Yamaguchi Prefectures, and unfed Haemaphysalis flava in Yamaguchi Prefecture. This finding suggests that ixodid tick is a possible vector of 'C. Mycoplasma haemominutum'. Spiroplasma DNA was also detected from unfed I. ovatus in Hokkaido, Fukushima and Yamaguchi Prefectures. The analysis of nucleotides sequence suggested that this Spiroplasma was distinct from registered species.
