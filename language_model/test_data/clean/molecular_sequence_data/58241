Band 3 protein is a typical polytropic membrane protein and mediates the exchange of the cellular HCO3- with CI- in plasma, which has been known as the "Chloride Shift". Owing to the "Chloride Shift", red blood cells can discriminate the metabolically active cells from inactive cells and deliver oxygen particularly to metabolically active tissues that produce carbon dioxide. Thus, band 3 protein is a sensor for metabolically active tissues and no excess oxygen is supplied to tissues as far as oxygen is delivered by red blood cells. In this chapter, we review the physiological role of the anion exchange mediated by band 3 protein and our work concerning the structure and function relationship in band 3 protein, that, is, affinity labeling of the active center for the anion exchange with pyridoxal phosphate, conformational change during the anion exchange process, examination of fidelity of hydropathy prediction on band 3 protein, and phosphoenolpyruvate transport mediated by band 3 protein and its clinical application.
