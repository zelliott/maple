Latency-associated nuclear antigen 1 (LANA1) of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is implicated in the persistence of the viral genome during latent infection. It has been suggested that LANA1 tethers the viral genome to the host chromosome and also participates actively in DNA replication from the terminal repeat of KSHV. Here we show by mutational analysis that the mitotic chromosome-binding activity of LANA1 is tightly coupled to its replication activity. Thus, KSHV appears to have evolved a unique tactic for its stable maintenance.
