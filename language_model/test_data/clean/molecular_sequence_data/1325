Some myotoxic or neurotoxic PLA2s (phospholipases A2) from pit viper venoms contain characteristic N6 substitutions. Our survey of the venoms of more than ten pit viper genera revealed that N6-PLA2s exist only in limited Asian pit vipers of two genera, Protobothrops and Gloydius, and exist as either monomers or the basic subunits of heterodimers in some New World pit vipers. For the newly identified N6-PLA2s, the neuromuscular blocking activities were assayed with the chick biventer cervicis neuromuscular tissue, whereas the increased serum creatine kinase level assessed their myotoxicities. The purified N6-PLA2s from Protobothrops mangshanensis and Gloydius intermedius saxatilis were found to be presynaptic neurotoxins. In contrast, all N6-PLA2s from the venoms of Sistrurus miliarius strackeri, S. m. barbouri, Crotalus viridis viridis, C. lepidus lepidus, Cerrophidion godmani and Bothreichis schlegelii were myotoxins without neurotoxicity even in the presence of crotoxin A. Crotoxin-like complexes were for the first time purified from the venoms of Sitrurus catenatus tergeminus, C. mitchelli mitchelli, C. horridus atricaudatus, C. basiliscus and C. durissus cumanensis. The cDNAs encoding six novel N6-PLA2s and subunits of the crotoxin-like complex from S. c. tergeminus were cloned and fully sequenced. Phylogeny analysis showed that two structural subtypes of N6-PLA2s with either F24 or S24 substitution have been evolved in parallel, possibly descended respectively from species related to present-day Protobothrops and Gloydius. Calmodulin binds all the N6-PLA2s but crotoxin A may inhibit its binding to crotoxin B and to other neurotoxic N6-PLA2s. Structure-activity relationships at various regions of the PLA2 molecules were extensively discussed.
