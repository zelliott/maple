The cytochrome oxidase subunit III gene (COIII) of the Badidiomycete S. commune has been identified, cloned, and sequenced. The gene contains no introns, is AT-rich (69%) and exhibits a high degree of similarity to sequences from Ascomycetes. While most mitochondrial genes use both TGA and TGG to specify tryptophan, the COIII gene of Schizophyllum uses TGG exclusively. Translation requires no deviation from the universal code.
