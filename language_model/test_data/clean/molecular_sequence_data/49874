Convergent and stereoselective synthetic routes to Man9GlcNAc2 (1b), alpha-Glc1M9GlcNAc2 (2b), and its stereoisomer beta-Glc1M9GlcNAc2 (3) were established. Interaction analysis of 2b with CRT was measured by 1H NMR spectroscopy, and the first NMR-based evidence for the specific binding of CRT to 2b was obtained.
