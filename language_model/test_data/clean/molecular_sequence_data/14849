Several protostomian molecules that structurally resemble chordate gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) have been identified through cloning, biochemical purification or data mining. These molecules share considerable sequence and structural similarities with chordate GnRH, leading to the current belief that protostomian and chordate forms of GnRH share a common ancestor. However, the physiological significance of these protostomian GnRH-like molecules remains poorly understood. This knowledge gap hampers our understanding of how GnRH has evolved functionally over time. This review provides a summary of our recent functional characterization of a GnRH-like molecule (ap-GnRH) in a gastropod mollusk, Aplysia californica, and presents preliminary proof for a cognate ap-GnRH receptor (ap-GnRHR). Our data reveal that ap-GnRH is a general neural regulator capable of exerting diverse central and motor effects, but plays little or no role in reproductive activation. This notion is supported by the abundance of a putative ap-GnRHR transcript in the central nervous system and the foot. Comparing these results to the available functional data from a cephalopod mollusk, Octopus vulgaris, we surmise that protostomian GnRH-like molecules are likely to assume a wide range of physiological roles, and reproductive activation is not an evolutionarily conserved role of these molecules. Future functional studies using suitable protostomian models are required to identify functional changes in protostomian GnRH-like molecules that accompany major taxa-level transitions.
