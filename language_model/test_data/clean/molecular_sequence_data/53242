DNA sequencing and operon disruption experiments indicate that the genes glgBI and glgBII, which code for the two developmentally specific glycogen branching enzymes of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) each form part of larger duplicated operons consisting of at least four genes in the order pep1-treS-pep2-glgB. The sequences of the TreS proteins are 73% identical (93% similar) to that of an enzyme that converts maltose into trehalose in Pinmelobacter, a distantly related actinomycete; and the Pep1 proteins show relatedness to the alpha-amylase superfamily. Disruptions of each operon have spatially specific effects on the nature of glycogen deposits, as assessed by electron microscopy. Upstream of the glgBI operon, and diverging from it, is a gene (glgP) that encodes a protein resembling glycogen phosphorylase from Thermatoga maritima and a homologue in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These three proteins form a distinctive subgroup compared with glycogen phosphorylases from most other bacteria, which more closely resemble the enzymes from eukaryotes. Diverging from the glgBII operon, and separated from the pep1 gene by two very small ORFs, is a gene (glgX) encoding a probable glycogen debranching enzyme. It is suggested that most of these gene products participate in the developmentally modulated interconversion of immobile, inert glycogen reservoirs, and diffusible forms of carbon, both metabolically active (e.g. glucose-1-phosphate generated by glycogen phosphorylase) and metabolically inert but physiologically significant (trehalose).
