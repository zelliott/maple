In prokaryotes and eukaryotes mobile genetic elements frequently disrupt the highly conservative structures of chromosomes, which are responsible for storage of genetic information. The factors determining the site for integration of such elements are still unknown. Transfer RNA (tRNA) genes are associated in a highly significant manner with different putative mobile genetic elements in the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. These results suggest that tRNA genes in D. discoideum, and probably tRNA genes generally in lower eukaryotes, may function as genomic landmarks for the integration of different transposable elements in a strictly position-specific manner.
