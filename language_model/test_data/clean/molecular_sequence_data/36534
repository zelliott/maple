Previous studies have shown that the actions of IGF-II in bone are determined not only by its concentration, but also by the concentration of IGFBP-4 as well as other IGFBPs. In this study, we sought to determine by Western ligand blotting the effects of growth hormone, IGF-I and IGF-II on the production of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-4 in TE89 human osteosarcoma cells and in untransformed normal human bone cells derived from rib. Human growth hormone at 10 micrograms/l decreased the amount of IGFBP-4 but had no effect on the IGFBP-3 level in the conditioned medium of low density cultures of TE89 cells and human bone cells derived from rib. Human growth hormone had no effect on IGFBP-3 or IGFBP-4 levels in the conditioned medium of high density human bone cell cultures. IGF-I and IGF-II, which increased human bone cell proliferation, decreased the level of IGFBP-4 (30% of control at 100 micrograms/l IGF-I and IGF-II) but increased the level of IGFBP-3 (3-10 fold at 100 micrograms/l IGF-I and IGF-II) after 48 h of treatment in the conditioned medium of both low and high density TE89 cell cultures. Similar changes in IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-4 levels were also seen in the conditioned medium of human bone cells derived from rib after treatment with IGF-I and IGF-II. Studies to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms by which IGF-II decreased the amount of IGFBP-4 in the conditioned medium revealed that IGF-II decreased the IGFBP-4 mRNA abundance and increased the IGFBP-3 mRNA abundance in human bone cells. Based on the above findings, we conclude that the production of both IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-4 is regulated in bone cells and that local and systemic agents may modulate the responsiveness of bone cells to IGFs by regulated secretion of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-4.
