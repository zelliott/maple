Tumor suppressors of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene family regulate cell growth and differentiation. Polyomavirus large T antigens (large T) bind Rb family members and block their function. Mutations of large T sequences conserved with the DnaJ family affect large T binding to a cellular DnaK, heat shock protein 70. The same mutations abolish large T activation of E2F-containing promoters and Rb binding-dependent large T activation of cell cycle progression. Cotransfection of a cellular DnaJ domain blocks wild-type large T action, showing that the connection between the chaperone system and tumor suppressors is direct. Although they are inactive in assays dependent on Rb family binding, mutants in the J region retain the ability to associate with pRb, p107, and p130. This suggests that binding of Rb family members by large T is not sufficient for their inactivation and that a functional J domain is required as well. This work connects the DnaJ and DnaK molecular chaperones to regulation of tumor suppressors by polyomavirus large T.
