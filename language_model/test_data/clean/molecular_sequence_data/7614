BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice were immunized with recombinant vaccines consisting of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus CD8+ T-lymphocyte epitopes and a carrier protein. During challenge infection with WE strain lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, mutants with alterations in distinct amino acid residues of the epitopic nonapeptides appeared and multiplied. Splenocytes from WE-infected BALB/c mice lysed cells coated with the WE-type epitope; lysis was considerably less effective when the epitopic nonapeptide with which the syngeneic cells had been sensitized was the mutated form. Neither target was lysed by splenocytes from BALB/c mice infected with the variant virus. Mutants were not detected in F1 hybrid mice immunized with two viral epitopes that were restricted by class I molecules of both parents.
