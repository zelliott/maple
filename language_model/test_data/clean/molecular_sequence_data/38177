A family of negative regulators of JAK signaling pathway referred to as suppressor of cytokines signaling (SOCS) or cytokine-inducible SH2 protein (CIS) has been recently identified. In order to find additional members of this family, we have used a consensus amino acid sequence contained in the well-conserved central SH2 domain to search DNA databases. We isolated cDNA coding for the human homologue of SOCS-5, referred to as CIS6. Northern blot analysis revealed CIS6 mRNA expression in various tissues such as heart, muscle, spleen, and thymus and in all myeloma cell lines examined. The gene was assigned to human chromosome bands 2p21 and 3p22 by in situ hybridization. CIS6 is structurally related to other members of the CIS family and therefore could act as a negative regulator of signal transduction.
