We have performed an exhaustive unbiased yeast two-hybrid analysis to identify interaction partners of two human Raf kinase isoforms, A-Raf and C-Raf, using their N-terminal regulatory domain as "bait." A total of 20 different human proteins were found to interact with Raf isoforms. Several of these interactions were novel and an extensive bioinformatics evaluation was performed for each. The novel putative interactions include a signalosome component, TOPK/PBK kinase, and two new putative protein phosphatases. The cysteine-rich zinc-binding domain (CRD) of Raf was found to interact with all 20 proteins and to achieve isoform-specific interactions. Since similar putative CRDs are present in a variety of protein serine-threonine kinases, the data suggest that the CRD may function as a major protein-protein interaction domain of these kinases. We propose possible functional consequences of these novel Raf interactions.
