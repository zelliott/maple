C-type lectin is one of the pattern-recognition proteins of the non-self innate immune system in the invertebrates. In this study, a lectin-like cDNA (LvLT) of Litopenaeus vannamei was cloned and characterized. LvLT cDNA consists of 1035 nt encoding for a protein with 345 amino acid residues. The deduced LvLT consists of two putative carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) as found in most C-type lectins. The first CRD consists of an amino acid motif (QPD) for the binding of galactose and the other CRDs consist of amino acid motifs (EPN) for the binding of mannose. Except for some conserved amino acid residues, the CRD of LvLT shared an overall low amino acid sequence identity with CRDs of other lectins. Unlike other shrimp lectins, LvLT is expressed only in the hepatopancreas but not in the hemocytes as revealed by RT-PCR. When juvenile shrimp were challenged with shrimp extracts containing white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), the expression levels of LvLT decreased initially in the first 2 h and then increased to a much higher level after 4 h. The results suggest that the initial reduction in LvLT transcript level may be related to the WSSV infection in shrimp.
