The p53 protein is one of the major factors involved in cell cycle control, DNA repair, and induction of apoptosis. We determined the secondary structure of the 5'-terminal region of p53 mRNA that includes two major translation initiation codons AUG1 and AUG2, responsible for the synthesis of p53 and its N-truncated isoform Î”N-p53. It turned out that a part of the coding sequence was involved in the folding of the 5' untranslated region for p53. The most characteristic structural elements in the 5'-terminal region of p53 mRNA were two hairpin motifs. In one of them, the initiation codon AUG1 was embedded while the other hairpin has been earlier shown to bind the Mdm2 protein. Alternative mechanisms of p53 mRNA translation initiation were investigated in vitro using model mRNA templates. The results confirmed that initiation from AUG1 was mostly cap-dependent. The process was stimulated by a cap structure and strongly inhibited by a stable hairpin at the template 5' end. Upon inhibition, the remaining protein fraction was synthesized in a cap-independent process, which was strongly stimulated by the addition of a cap analogue. The translation initiation from AUG2 showed a largely cap-independent character. The 5' cap structure actually decreased initiation from this site which argues against a leaky scanning mechanism but might suggest the presence of an IRES. Moreover, blocking cap-dependent translation from AUG1 by the stable hairpin did not change the level of initiation from AUG2. Upon addition of the cap analogue, translation from this site was even increased.
