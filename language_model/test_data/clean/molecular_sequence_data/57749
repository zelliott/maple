Within the conserved 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the pestivirus genome three highly variable regions were identified. Preceding the polyprotein start codon, multiple cryptic AUG codons and several small open reading frames are characteristic for all the five pestiviruses. Inspection of the context of AUGs revealed that the polyprotein initiation AUG of pestivirus has a weak context for efficient translation initiation. The most favorable context was found in two of the cryptic AUGs. Two oligopyrimidine-rich tracts upstream to the conserved either cryptic or authentic AUG in the 5'-UTR of pestivirus were identified and 83.3% of their nucleotide sequences are complementary to the consensus sequence at the 3' terminus of eucaryotic 18S rRNA. A secondary structure model for the 5'-UTR of pestivirus was predicted. Nucleotide sequence comparison among five pestiviruses led to the identification of a variable region and a conserved region in the 3'-UTR. A deletion of 41 nucleotides was found within the variable region in Osloss. A secondary structure model for the 3'-UTR was also predicted. The structural similarity of the 5'-UTR between pestiviruses and picornaviruses and hepatitis C viruses was demonstrated and the possible implications of features of the 5' and 3'-UTR of pestiviruses are discussed.
