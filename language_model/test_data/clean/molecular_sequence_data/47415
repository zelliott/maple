Three new partially acetylated derivatives of 1-O-dodecanyl-alpha-L- rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->3)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->3)-alpha-L- rhamnopyranoside and three partially acetylated derivatives of 1-O-dodecanyl-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->3)- alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->3)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->4)- alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside, one of them new, have been isolated from the mature leaves of Cleistopholis patens (Annonaceae). Their structures, elucidated by using COSY, COSY-LR, TOCSY and FAB mass spectrometry, have been characterised as cleistrioside-2, -3, -4 and cleistetroside-1, -2 and -6. From the same source, shikimic acid was also isolated.
