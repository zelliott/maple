The N-linked oligosaccharides, from Saccharomyces cerevisiae mnn1 mnn9 mutant mannoprotein extracted from the cells in hot citrate buffer, were separated by ion exchange into a monophosphate diester, a monophosphate monoester, a diphosphate diester, and a diphosphate monoester diester. The structures of the major components with diesterified phosphate were assigned as follows (where M = mannose), according to a recently revised oligosaccharide structure for the mnn mutants (Hernandez, L. M., Ballou, L., Alvarado, E., Gillece-Castro, B. L., Burlingame, A. L., and Ballou, C. E. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 11849-11856). formula; see text The monoester derivatives were mixtures of the possible isomers produced by removal of one or the other phosphoglycosyl-linked mannose units, and they were shown to arise by chemical degradation during isolation. The mnn1 mnn2 mnn10 acidic oligosaccharide fraction contained a mono- and a diphosphate ester. The monophosphate consisted predominantly of a single isomer with a mannosyl phosphate unit located at the end of the outer chain in an oligosaccharide with the following structure, where x may range from 2 to 12. The diphosphate had a mannosyl phosphate in this formula; see text position as well as one on the terminal alpha 1----6-linked mannose in the core. The presence in the mnn1 mnn9 or mnn1 mnn2 mnn10 background of the mnn4 or mnn6 mutations, which are known to regulate phosphorylation in yeast, reduced phosphorylation by 90% but did not eliminate it.
