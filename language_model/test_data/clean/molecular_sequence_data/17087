We investigated the effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on the expression of ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCH) mRNA in the testis and brain of the Japanese common goby, Acanthogobius flavimanus. The cDNA sequence of goby UCH contained an open reading frame encoding 220 amino acid residues (M(r)=24,223) with 51.3% overall sequence identity with human and mouse UCHL1. A competitive PCR assay was used to quantify the levels of UCH mRNA in the testis and brain of male gobies after exposure to bisphenol A, nonylphenol, or estradiol-17beta for 3 weeks. Exposure to estradiol-17beta at a nominal concentration of 100 ng/L induced significant increase in UCH mRNA levels in both testis and brain (P<0.05), whereas exposure to nonylphenol induced a significant decrease in UCH mRNA levels in the testis (P<0.01). These results suggest that EDCs can either positively or negatively regulate UCH mRNA levels.
