Human erythrocyte glycophorin C plays a functionally important role in maintaining erythrocyte shape and regulating membrane mechanical stability. We report here the characterization of the glycophorins C and D deficiency in erythrocytes of the Leach phenotype. Glycophorin C gene is encoded by 4 exons. Amplification of reticulocyte cDNA from Leach phenotype and normal individuals generated a 140-bp fragment when using primers spanning exons 1 and 2. However, no polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were detected in the Leach phenotype using primers flanking either exons 1 and 3 or exons 1 and 4, suggesting that the 3' end of the mRNA was missing or altered. Exon 4 also appeared to be missing from Leach genomic DNA, based on both Southern hybridization and PCR. These results indicate that an absence of glycophorin C and glycophorin D in erythrocytes from these Leach phenotype individuals is a consequence of a deletion or marked alteration of exon 3 and exon 4 of their glycophorin C gene. Surprisingly, the mutant gene encodes an mRNA stable enough to be detected in circulating reticulocytes. Although this mRNA could encode an N-terminal fragment of glycophorin C, these protein isoform(s) would not be expressed in the membrane because they lack the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains.
