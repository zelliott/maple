Lacazia loboi is a geographically restricted, uncultivated fungal pathogen of humans and dolphins. Previous investigations using 18S small unit rDNA, chitin synthase 2 and gp43 DNA sequences positioned L. loboi as a close relative of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. However, given the few individuals of L. loboi studied and the high degree of genetic variation observed in P. brasiliensis, the existence of L. loboi as an independent species has been questioned. To investigate the phylogenetic position of this species, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis using 20 L. loboi collections (L. loboi was obtained from proven cases of lacaziosis and 14 collections were maintained in mice, the others were analyzed from DNA taken directly from infected human tissue.). L. loboi DNA sequence was compared to that from 17 P. brasiliensis strains that represented the known variation in this species, and outgroup taxa in the Onygenales (Ajellomyces and Coccidioides species). Our analyses used DNA sequence from ITS rRNA, and partial coding sequences of chitin synthase 4, ADP-ribosylation factor, and gp43. Nucleotide variation among strains of L. loboi was minor but numerous nucleotide mismatches and multiple gaps were found for these gene regions among members in the Ajellomycetaceae, including P. brasiliensis. Phylogenies inferred using neighbor-joining, maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses showed no significant conflict and depicted L. loboi as a well-supported, monophyletic group that was sister to the Paracoccidioides clade. These results argue for maintaining L. loboi as a taxon independent from Paracoccidioides within the Ajellomycetaceae.
