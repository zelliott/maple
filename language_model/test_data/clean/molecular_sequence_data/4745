We have previously reported that particles resembling retroviral particles and possessing an RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity can be prepared from platelets. Furthermore, we and others have shown that these particles are present at higher levels in patients with essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera. We show here that these particles package RNA molecules that encode HERV-K-related pol genes. A subset of the RNA molecules that are packaged are likely to encode the RNA directed DNA polymerase activity and, because these RNAs possess long/full-length open reading frames for the reverse transcriptase and RNaseH (also for part of the integrase domains in genomic clones) of HERV-K, we propose that these transcripts are indeed strong candidates for encoding the enzyme activity found in these particles. Moreover, by using a modification of the polymerase chain reaction-based reverse transcriptase assay in which activated DNA is added during cDNA synthesis to suppress DNA polymerase-mediated RNA-directed DNA synthesis, we have found that the particle-associated enzyme behaves like a retroviral reverse transcriptase, further supporting the conclusion that retrovirus-like, perhaps HERV-K sequences, encode this enzyme activity.
