The nucleotide sequences of the mouse pro alpha 1(I) gene regions coding for the N- and C-propeptides is reported. The exon-intron structure was highly homologous to human COL1A1 and the deduced amino acid sequences of the N- and C-propeptides showed 67% and 91% identity with the human sequence. This gene sequence information will allow the production of specific gene mutations by site-directed mutagenesis to study the structure and function of these important propeptide domains.
