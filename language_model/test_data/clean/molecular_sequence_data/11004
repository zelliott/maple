The mechanism of bacterial gliding motility (active movement over surfaces without the aid of flagella) is not known. A large number of nonmotile mutants of the gliding bacterium Flavobacterium johnsoniae (Cytophaga johnsonae) have been previously isolated, and genetic techniques to analyze these mutants have recently been developed. We complemented a nonmotile mutant of F. johnsoniae (UW102-09) with a library of wild-type DNA by using the shuttle cosmid pCP17. The complementing plasmid (pCP100) contained an insert of 13 kbp, and restored motility to 4 of 61 independently isolated nonmotile mutants. A 1.3-kbp fragment that encompassed a single ORF, gldA, complemented all four mutants. Disruption of the chromosomal copy of gldA in wild-type F. johnsoniae UW101 eliminated gliding motility. The predicted protein produced by gldA has strong sequence similarity to ATP binding cassette transport proteins.
