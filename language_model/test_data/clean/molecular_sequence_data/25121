A cDNA library was prepared from cytoplasmic poly(A)RNA from mouse NIH-3T3 cells carrying a transfected human tre oncogene. Screening with tre gene probes identified a tre cDNA clone 11-4 and a co-purifying weakly hybridizing cDNA clone 11-5. The 11-5-specific RNA was expressed in both nontransfected and tre-transfected NIH-3T3 cells, showing it is of mouse rather than tre gene origin. Its nucleotide sequence was 717 bp long and contained, starting from the first nucleotide, an open reading frame of 588 bp followed by a 3' noncoding region and 26 A residues at the 3' terminus. Comparison with the GenBank data base revealed 93.7% homology with cDNA encoding the rat L19 ribosomal protein. Furthermore, the 196-amino-acid polypeptide deduced from 11-5 was of the same length and contained only one amino acid difference compared with the rat L19 protein. Comparison with the weakly hybridizing tre gene probe showed stretches of homology that were, however, too short to be taken into consideration. We conclude that the 11-5 sequence encodes the mouse L19 ribosomal protein.
