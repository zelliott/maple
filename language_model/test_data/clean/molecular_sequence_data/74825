A water-soluble polysaccharide, isolated from the hot aqueous extract of an edible mushroom, Volvariella bombycina, consists of d-glucose, d-mannose, and d-galactose in a molar ratio 2:1:1. On the basis of total hydrolysis, methylation analysis, periodate oxidation, and NMR studies ((1)H, (13)C, TOCSY, DQF-COSY, NOESY, ROESY, HMQC, and HMBC), and MALDI-TOFMS analysis, the repeating unit of the polysaccharide is established as [table in text].
