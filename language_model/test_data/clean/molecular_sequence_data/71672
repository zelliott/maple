In this work we examine the role of three genetic control components in the regulation of HTLV-1 transcription: cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB), the HTLV-1 trans-activator Tax, and the three Tax-responsive elements (TREs). We demonstrate that the in vivo efficiency of the HTLV-1 promoter basal expression in cell culture depends on the spacing between the three TRE elements, located at the HTLV-1 LTR (long terminal repeat), whereas the level of transcription activation mediated by Tax is affected by the number of TREs. In the presence of only one TRE, the enhancement of expression by Tax is affected by the distance between the single TRE and the transcription start site. Following CREB binding to the LTR, additional DNase I hypersensitive sites are generated in the region between the two distal TREs (I and II), while in the presence of Tax, such sites are generated also in the region between TREs II and III. Neither cooperative binding of CREB to the TREs nor preferential binding of CREB to a particular TRE was observed. Tax binding to the CREB/TRE complex does not change the DNase I protection pattern. Taken together, these results suggest that the basal CREB-mediated transcription is determined by the number and the position of the viral TREs relative to each other. Tax protein stabilizes the protein/DNA complex and suppresses the spacing limitations, probably by bridging between the CREB/TRE complexes and the basal initiation transcription complex.
