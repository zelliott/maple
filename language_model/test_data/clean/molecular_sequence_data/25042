Two novel genes of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), FREP3 and FREP7, are reported from the snail Biomphalaria glabrata, a prominent intermediate host of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni. They resemble other B. glabrata genes that encode fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs), but differ in that they encode proteins with two tandemly arranged IgSF domains followed by a C-terminal fibrinogen domain. FREPs are hemolymph proteins that increase in abundance following exposure to a digenetic trematode, Echinostoma paraensei, and that bind to and precipitate parasite antigens. Within each gene, the two IgSF-coding regions are dissimilar from one another: the N-terminal IgSF1 domain is encoded by a single exon whereas the downstream IgSF2 domain is encoded by three exons. For both FREPs 3 and 7, the IgSF2 domain belongs to the variable (V) type, whereas the IgSF1 domain is not easily classified with respect to IgSF type. The fibrinogen-encoding region in both genes is relatively conserved and lacks introns. FREP3 exhibits extensive variation in the IgSF1 region. A ratio of nonsynonymous versus synonymous substitutions of 2.56 suggests that this region is under positive selection. A genomic fragment identifiable as FREP7 but lacking an exon was also found, further suggestive of variability within FREP IgSF-encoding regions. Insofar as FREPs are hypothesized to function in nonself recognition, the identification of additional novel FREP genes as part of a growing gene family in B. glabrata is of interest. Such genes, particularly given their variable nature, serve as a model to study the complexity of invertebrate defense responses.
