We are the first to have isolated a protein (186 amino acid residues) encoded by the open reading frame adjacent to the end of the BspD6I nickase (N.BspD6I) gene. Cleavage of both DNA strands near the sequence recognized by nickase (5 -GAGTC/5 -GACTC) occurs when this protein is added to the reaction mixture containing N.BspD6I. The protein encoded by the open reading frame and the nickase are suggested to be subunits of heterodimeric restriction endonuclease R.BspD6I.
