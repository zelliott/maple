Fluorescence measurements of the homologous proteins, notexin and PLA2 enzymes from Naja naja atra, Naja nigricollis, and Hemachatus haemachatus venoms, showed that the wave-length of maximum emission and the quantum yield of their intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra were different. To verify the factors which affected their fluorescence characteristics, the dynamics of tryptophan residues in those homologous proteins were studied by quenching with acrylamide, iodide, and cesium. The degrees of exposure of tryptophanyl groups in notexin and PLA2 enzymes assessed by acrylamide quenching were found to be the major factor that determined their fluorescence characteristics. However, the positively charged groups surrounding tryptophan residues of PLA2 enzymes from N. naja atra and N. nigricollis venoms might affect the quantum yield of their fluorophores. Tryptophan residues of notexin were in an environment with less fluctuation, which did not allow free diffusion of ionic quencher. This might render its tryptophan residues to fluoresce at a shorter wavelength. These results suggested that the structural determinants affecting the intrinsic fluorescence emission of homologous proteins can be easily assessed by quenching studies.
