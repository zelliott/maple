Glycoproteins I and E of the Varicella-zoster virus, encoded by the neighbouring open reading frames 67 and 68, are transcribed into several transcript species that differ in size. From gI, three transcripts of 1.65, 2.7, and 3.6 kb are known, and from gE, two transcripts of 2.15 and 3.6 kb in size are known. Here, we demonstrate that these various transcript species appear in different amounts at different times post infection. At 12 hr post infection, the transcripts of 1.65 (gI) and 2.15 (gE) were clearly detectable, whereas the other transcripts appeared later on. RT-PCR studies using a set of different primers provided clear evidence that gI and gE are transcribed both, mono- and bicistronically, with predominance on the respective monocistronic transcript. Additional evidence for monocistronic transcription was found in the fact that both glycoproteins contain their own transcriptional start sites. Both promoter regions have their own basal transcription activity and include active TATA-boxes that were recognized by the TATA-box binding protein.
