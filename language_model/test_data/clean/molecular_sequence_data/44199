Genes of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) gene cluster localized on chromosome 2q13 are implicated in many physiological and pathophysiological processes. We present here a high-resolution physical map of this region between markers D2S2008 and D2S4/PAX8. An integrated YAC/PAC contig and a partial transcriptional map were constructed by STS-constent mapping using the CEPH YAC library and three PAC libraries. A total of 3 YACs, 34 PACs, and 56 STSs were integrated: 33 newly generated probes to PAC end sequences, 9 polymorphic and 4 nonpolymorphic markers, 5 known genes, 4 expressed sequence tags, and 1 pseudogene. Within the map, a complete PAC contig of > 1 Mb encompasses the IL-1 gene cluster and PAX8, a paired-box-containing gene. This allowed us to define the transcriptional orientation of GLVR1, IL1B, and IL1RN and to show that PAX8 is localized outside the IL-1 gene cluster. FISH analysis localized PAC clones containing the IL-1 gene cluster to 2q12-q13. The data provide the basis for further characterization of the IL-1 gene cluster and for the construction of a sequence-ready PAC contig of this region.
