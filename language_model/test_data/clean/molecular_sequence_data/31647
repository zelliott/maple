Aquaporins channel water and other neutral molecules through cell membranes. Aquaporin gene expression is subject to transcriptional control and can be modulated by factors affecting water balance such as salt, abscisic acid and drought. During infestation of maize by southern corn rootworm (SCR), an insect that chews into and significantly damages maize roots, three maize aquaporins were differentially expressed upon prolonged infestation. Using a brief infestation of maize roots ZmNIP1;1 transcript abundance again increased under infestation while expression of a new aquaporin, ZmPIP2;8 and ZmTIP2;2 expression did not change. Since ZmPIP2;8 has not been described previously, the deduced protein sequence was analyzed in silico and found to contain the hallmarks of plant aquaporins, with a predicted protein structure similar to other functionally characterized PIP2s. NIPs characterized to date have been implicated in facilitating the movement of a variety of small molecules, while TIPs and PIPs often have the capacity to facilitate trans-membrane movement of water. Functional assays (using heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes) of ZmTIP2;2 and ZmPIP2;8 confirmed that these aquaporins demonstrate water channel capacity.
