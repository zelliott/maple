We have previously isolated a protein from mouse liver nuclei that specifically binds to single stranded (TTAGGG)n repeats. TTAGGG is the telomeric repeats of mammals and we therefore named the new protein single stranded telomere binding protein (sTBP). Further studies now identify sTBP as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2/B1 on the basis of amino acid sequence determination and antibody reactivity. A2 and B1 form a major part of the protein component of hnRNP particles and are abundant nuclear proteins. Unexpectedly, A2/B1 has a high specificity for binding to the RNA equivalent of TTAGGG, UUAGGG, but under the same conditions does not appear to have a strong affinity for a number of other RNA species.
