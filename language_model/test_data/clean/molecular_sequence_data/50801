The structure of the gene encoding the bovine type B endothelin receptor (ETB) has been established and compared with those of other heptahelical receptors. The gene is present as a single copy in the bovine genome, as demonstrated by Southern blot analysis, and spans at least 36 kb. The coding region is divided into 7 exons separated by 6 introns, one of which is more than 23 kb in length. The exons correspond well to the structural domains of the receptor: the first exon encodes the first and second transmembrane domains, and each of the following transmembrane domains is encoded by a separate exon. The portion of the ETB protein sequence encoded by exon 3 is quite different from the corresponding ETA sequence, suggesting that this region is responsible for the distinct ligand specificities of the two receptor subtypes. The second intron interrupts the canonical Asp-Arg-Tyr sequence, which is located at the end of the third transmembrane domain of the heptahelical receptors, as with the substance P, substance K, dopamine D2 and dopamine D3 receptor genes. To map the 5' region of the gene and determine the start of transcription, primer-extended cDNAs were cloned and sequenced: multiple start sites were deduced with no apparent TATA box in the expected upstream region. Similar results were obtained by ribonuclease protection analysis.
