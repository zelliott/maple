The growth of the majority of prostate tumors is androgen-dependent, for which the presence of a functional androgen receptor is a prerequisite. Tumor growth can be inhibited by blockade of androgen receptor action. However, this inhibition is transient. To study the role of the androgen receptor in androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate tumor cell growth, androgen receptor mRNA expression was monitored in six different human prostate tumor cell lines and tumors, which were grown either in vitro or by transplantation on (male) nude mice. Androgen receptor mRNA was clearly detectable in three androgen-dependent (sensitive) tumors and absent or low in three androgen-independent tumors. Growth of the LNCaP prostate tumor cell line can be stimulated both by androgens and by fetal calf serum. In the former situation androgen receptor mRNA expression is downregulated, whereas in the latter no effect on androgen receptor mRNA levels can be demonstrated. Sequence analysis showed that the androgen receptor gene from LNCaP cells contains a point mutation in the region encoding the steroid-binding domain, which confers an ACT codon encoding a threonine residue to GCT, encoding alanine.
