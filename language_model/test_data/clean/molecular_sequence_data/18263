We present a brief overview of the present knowledge on the structural and molecular properties of angiotensin II receptors and the various attempts to determine their primary structures, with special reference to our strategy for receptor purification. The strategy involves covalent labeling of the receptor with synthetic biotinylated photoactivatable probes, followed by indirect affinity chromatography on immobilized streptavidin. The various applications of these probes to the study of structural and molecular properties and to the cell biology of angiotensin II receptors are discussed.
