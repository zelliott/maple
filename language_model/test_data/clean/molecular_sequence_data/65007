The annexins are a family of calcium- and phospholipid-binding proteins that have been widely studied in animals. Investigation of annexins in the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus identified a novel annexin-like gene (ANXC4) as well as two conventional annexins (ANXC3.1 and ANXC3.2). The genes were initially identified by bioinformatics, and sequences were then determined experimentally. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction indicated that all three genes were expressed. ANXC4 lacked calcium-binding consensus sequences and had a 553 residue N-terminal tail. However, bioinformatics indicated that ANXC4 is an annexin and homologues were identified in other filamentous fungi. ANXC4 therefore represents a new grouping within the annexin family.
