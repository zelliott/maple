A novel gene, Xerl (Xenopus EGF-like repeat with laminin-G domain protein) was isolated from a Xenopus head cDNA library prepared from tailbud. This gene encoded 779 amino acids including a potential signal sequence, twelve EGF-like repeats, a laminin-G domain, a RGD sequence and a VWF motif. In the EGF-like repeat and the laminin-G domain, Xerl showed similarity to those of Drosophila Crumbs, respectively. Zygotic expression of Xerl began at late gastrula, and increased through neurula up to the tailbud stage. In adult organs, Xerl was detected in brain and eye. Whole-mount in situ hybridization showed that Xerl expression occurred first in the anterior bilateral region of neurula and gradually localized to retina and forebrain and boundaries of midbrain and hindbrain.
