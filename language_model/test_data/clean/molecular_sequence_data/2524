N2O reductase (N2O----N2) is the terminal enzyme in the energy-conserving denitrification pathway of soil and marine denitrifying bacteria. The protein is composed of two identical subunits and contains eight copper ions per enzyme molecule. The magnetic circular dichroism spectrum of resting (oxidized) N2O reductase is strikingly similar to the magnetic circular dichroism spectrum of the CuA site in mammalian cytochrome c oxidase [Greenwood, C., Hull, B. C., Barber, D., Eglinton, D. G. & Thomson, A. J. (1983) Biochem. J. 215, 303-316] and is unlike the magnetic circular dichroism spectra of all other biological copper chromophores obtained to date. Sulfur (or chlorine) scatterers are required to fit the copper extended x-ray absorption fine structure data of both the oxidized and reduced forms of N2O reductase. Satisfactory fits require a Cu-N or Cu-O [denoted Cu-(N, O)] interaction at 2.0 A, a Cu-(S, Cl) interaction at 2.3 A and an additional Cu(S, Cl) interaction at approximately 2.6 A (oxidized) or approximately 2.7 A (reduced). Approximately eight sulfur ions (per eight copper ions) at approximately 2.3 A are required to fit the extended x-ray absorption fine structure data for both the oxidized and reduced N2O reductase. The 2.3-A Cu-(S, Cl) distance is nearly identical to that previously determined for the CuA site in cytochrome c oxidase. A 2.6-2.7 A Cu-(S, Cl) interaction is also present in resting and fully reduced cytochrome c oxidase. Comparison of the N2O reductase sequence, determined by translating the structural NosZ gene, with cytochrome c oxidase subunit II sequences from several sources indicates that a Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Ser-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-His stretch is highly conserved. This sequence contains three of the probable ligands (two cysteines and one histidine) in a CuA-type site. Collectively these data establish that Pseudomonas stutzeri N2O reductase contains CuA-type sites.
