Among the several multigene families codified by the genome of T. cruzi, the TcTASV family was the latest discovered. The TcTASV (Trypomastigote, Alanine, Serine, Valine) family is composed of âˆ¼40 members, with conserved carboxi- and amino-termini but with a variable central core. According to the length and sequence of the central region the family is split into 3 subfamilies. The TcTASV family is conserved in the genomes of - at least - lineages TcI and TcVI and has no orthologues in other trypanosomatids. In the present work we focus on the study of the TcTASV-C subfamily, composed by 16 genes in the CL Brener strain. We determined that TcTASV-C is preferentially expressed in trypomastigotes, but it is not a major component of the parasite. Both immunoflourescence and flow cytometry experiments indicated that TcTASV-C has a clonal expression, i.e. it is not expressed by all the parasites of a certain population at the same time. We also determined that TcTASV-C is phosphorylated and glycosylated. TASV-C is attached to the parasite surface by a GPI anchor and is shed spontaneously into the medium. About 30% of sera from infected hosts reacted with TcTASV-C, confirming its exposition to the immune system. Its superficial localization and secretory nature suggest a possible role in host-parasite interactions.
