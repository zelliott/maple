A genomic DNA sequence (fad2-1) encoding seed specific microsomal 0-6 desaturase was isolated from soybean (Glycine max. L cv. Pusa-9702). A positive genomic clone of 1852 nucleotides containing a single uninterrupted 3' end exonic region with an ORF of 1140 bp encoding a peptide of 379 amino acids, a complete 3' UTR of 206 bp and 86 bp of 5' UTR interrupted by a single intron of 420 bp was obtained on screening the sub-genomic library of soybean. Southern blots revealed at least two copies of the gene per haploid genome. Analysis of the translated product showed the presence of three histidine boxes, with the general sequence HXXXH and five probable transmembrane segments reported to be involved in substrate specificity.
