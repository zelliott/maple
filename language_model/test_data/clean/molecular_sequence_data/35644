In Escherichia coli, iron assimilation by means of the siderophore enterobactin requires two hydrophobic cytoplasmic membrane proteins, FepD and FepG, which are essential components of a binding-protein-dependent transport system. Such components are typically difficult to detect. Here we report observation of the fepD and fepG gene products in polyacrylamide gels; they appeared as diffuse bands at positions consistent with smaller sizes than those predicted by sequence analysis. Translational coupling was suggested by the lack of a detectable product from the fepG message in the absence of translation of the upstream fepD message. The orientation of FepD/FepG in the membrane was predicted based on their similarities in sequence and hydrophobicity to FhuB.
