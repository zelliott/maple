The high molecular mass protein complex (RhopH) in the rhoptries of the malaria parasite consists of three distinct polypeptides with estimated sizes in Plasmodium falciparum of 155kDa (PfRhopH1), 140kDa (PfRhopH2) and 110kDa (PfRhopH3). Using a number of reagents, including a new mAb 4E10 that is specific for the PfRhopH complex, it was shown that the RhopH complex is synthesised during schizogony and transferred intact to the ring stage in newly invaded erythrocytes. The genes encoding RhopH1 and RhopH3 have already been identified and characterised in both P. falciparum and Plasmodium yoelii. In this report, we describe the identification of the gene for RhopH2 in both these parasite species. Peptide sequences were obtained from purified RhopH2 proteins and used to generate oligonucleotide primers and search malaria sequence databases. In a parallel approach, mAb 4E10 was used to identify a clone coding for RhopH2 from a P. falciparum cDNA library. The sequences of both P. falciparum and P. yoelii genes for RhopH2 were completed and compared. They both contain nine introns and there is a high degree of similarity between the deduced amino acid sequences of the two proteins. The P. falciparum gene is a single copy gene located on chromosome 9, and is transcribed in schizonts.
