The class II MHC gene DPA is inducible by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), whereas the DQB gene is not inducible in most cell types. To investigate the DNA region specifically responsible for inducibility or its lack that may be required (in addition to the elements required for constitutive expression of class II genes), hybrid promoters were constructed between the proximal 5' regions of the DPA promoter up to -148 bp, which is IFN-gamma inducible, and of the DQB promoter up to -160 bp, which is not inducible. As a result of these and previous studies [9, 10], the region of the DPA gene required for its IFN-gamma inducibility was localized to 27 bp between -55 and -81, including the Y-box element and its flanking nucleotides.
