We identified two conserved polar amino acids within different membrane domains (MD) of Streptococcus equisimilis hyaluronan synthase (seHAS), Lys48 in MD2 and Glu327 in MD4. In eukaryotic HASs, the position of the Glu is very similar and the Lys is replaced by a conserved polar Gln. To assess whether Lys48 and Glu327 interact or influence seHAS activity, we investigated the effects of changing Lys48 to Arg or Glu and Glu327 to Lys, Asp, or Gln. Mutants, including a double switch variant with Lys48 and Glu327 exchanged, were expressed and assayed in Escherichia coli membranes. SeHASE327Q and seHASE327K were expressed at low levels, whereas seHASE327D and the Lys48 mutants were expressed well. The specific enzyme activities (relative to wild type) were 17 and 7% for the K48R and K48E mutants and 26 and 38% for the E327Q and E327D mutants, respectively. In contrast, seHAS(E327K) showed only 0.16% of wild-type activity but was rescued over 46-fold by changing Lys48 to Glu. Expression of the seHASE327K,K48E protein was also rescued to near wild-type levels. Based on size exclusion chromatography coupled to multiangle laser light scattering analysis, all the variants synthesized hyaluronan (HA) of smaller weight-average molar mass than wild-type enzyme (3.6 MDa); the smallest HA (approximately 0.6 MDa) was made by seHASE327K,K48E and seHASK48E. The results indicate that Glu327 within MD4 is a critical residue for the stability of seHAS, that it may interact with Lys48 within MD2, and that these residues are involved in the ability of HAS to synthesize very large HA.
