Two new phenethyl alcohol glycosides, darendoside A and B (= deacyl martynoside) were isolated from the methanolic extract of the aerial parts of Scutellaria orientalis subsp. pinnatifida, along with four known glycosides, syringin, martynoside, leucosceptoside A and verbascoside. On the basis of chemical and spectral evidence the structures of darendoside A and B were determined as beta-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl O-beta-D-apiofuranosyl-(1-->2)-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and beta-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->3)-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (= deacyl martynoside), respectively.
