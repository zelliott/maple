Members of the caspase family play a central and evolutionary role in programmed cell death (PCD), which removes unwanted, damaged and dangerous cells during development to maintain homeostasis. In this paper, we describe the cloning and characterization of a caspase from the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, named Hearm caspase-1. The 1,350 bp full-length cDNA contains an 885 bp open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a Hearm caspase-1 proenzyme of 294 amino acids. The deduced protein is highly homologous to Spodoptera frugiperda Sf caspase-1 and Drosophila melanogaster ICE and has the highly conserved pentapeptide QACQG, the recognized catalytic site of caspases, suggesting that it is an effector caspase of the cotton bollworm. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses demonstrate that Hearm caspase-1 is expressed in embryos and the fat body, midgut and haemocytes of feeding and wandering larvae. Expression of Hearm caspase-1 in the haemocytes appears to be correlated with the pulse of ecdysone, and it is up-regulated by ecdysone agonist RH-2485, implying that Hearm caspase-1 activation is regulated by ecdysone.
