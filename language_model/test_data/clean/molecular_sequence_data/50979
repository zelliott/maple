Bovine alpha-lactalbumin (b alpha LA) gene prepared by polymerase chain reaction was introduced into rat genomes by microinjection. Out of 17 transgenic rat lines, 11 secreted b alpha LA into their milk at concentrations higher than 0.2 micrograms/ml. Of these, three lines secreted b alpha LA at concentrations higher than those in bovine milk. The highest concentration of b alpha LA secreted into rat milk was 2,400 micrograms/ml.
