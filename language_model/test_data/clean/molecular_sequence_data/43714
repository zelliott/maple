We have isolated a full-length cDNA clone encoding a Xenopus laevis immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP; also called glucose-regulated protein or grp78). The Bip cDNA sequence includes an open reading frame of 1,965 bp encoding a 655 amino acid protein with an N-terminal hydrophobic leader sequence and a C-terminal KDEL tetrapeptide which has been found in other lumenal proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum. The 3' untranslated region contains a polyadenylation and an adenylation control element (ACE) as well as a putative mRNA instability sequence. The Xenopus BiP amino acid sequence displayed high identity with BiP from other vertebrates including chicken (91.3%), rat (90.7%), and human (89.9%). Northern hybridization analysis demonstrated that BiP mRNA was present constitutively in the Xenopus A6 kidney epithelial cell line and that BiP mRNA levels could be enhanced by treatment of the cells with galactose-free media, 2-deoxyglucose, 2-deoxygalactose, glucosamine, tunicamycin, heat shock, dithiothreitol, and the calcium ionophore, A23187. Finally, while BiP mRNA was detected in all of the adult tissues examined, the relative level of BiP mRNA differed dramatically between organs. For example, relatively high levels of BiP mRNA were detected in liver with moderate levels in testis, ovary and heart and reduced levels in eye and muscle tissue.
