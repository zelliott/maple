Expression of the MAGE genes encoding tumor-rejection antigens on HLA-A1 and -Cw1601 recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes was investigated in esophageal carcinomas at the mRNA level by the semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method. MAGE-1 and -2 genes, but not MAGE-3, -3/-6 and -4a/-4b genes, were expressed in substantial proportions of the primary esophageal carcinomas and their metastatic lymph nodes. The proportion of MAGE-positive samples in the primary esophageal carcinomas correlated with the T factor of the TNM classification (pT1: 2 of 12 tumors, pT2: 1 of 6, pT3: 12 of 29, and pT4: 7 of 18). These results have important implications for specific immunotherapy of esophageal carcinomas using MAGE-1 gene product.
