NEDD8 is a novel ubiquitin-like protein that has been shown to conjugate to nuclear proteins in a manner analogous to ubiquitination and sentrinization. Recently, human cullin-4A was reported to be conjugated by a single molecule of NEDD8. Here, we show that human cullin-2 is also conjugated by a single molecule of the NEDD8. The C-terminal 171-amino-acid residues in human cullin-2 are sufficient for NEDD8-conjugation. In addition, the equivalent C-terminal fragments of other cullins have been shown to be conjugated by NEDD8. Mapping of the NEDD8-conjugation site revealed that Lys-689 in human cullin-2 is conjugated by NEDD8. Interestingly, the Lys residue at position 689 in cullin-2 is conserved in all cullin family members, including human cullin-1, -2, -3, -4A, -4B, and -5 and yeast cullin (Cdc53), suggesting the possibility that other cullin family members are conjugated by NEDD8/Rub1 at a Lys residue of equivalent position.
