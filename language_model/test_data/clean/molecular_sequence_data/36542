We have used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify exon VII of the bovine beta-casein gene. The mutations responsible for the B variant were identified by direct sequencing of the amplification products. A bidirectional allele-specific PCR method (BAS-PCR) has been developed using oligonucleotides overlapping the mutation site at their 3' ends. This new procedure allows a rapid and reliable discrimination between the B and non-B alleles of beta-casein.
