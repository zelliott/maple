The nudA1 mutation in the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain gene inhibits nuclear migration, colony growth and asexual sporulation (conidiation) in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. It also alters the location of the first cell division event (septation) and prevents nucleation of tip cells. We showed previously that a suppressor of nudA1, snaD290, partially reversed the nuclear migration defect and partially restored colony growth. We have now demonstrated that the snaD290 mutation also delays septation and restores the septum to its normal position, allowing tip cells to be nucleated. Although snaD290 does not affect nuclear migration or vegetative hyphal growth, it almost completely inhibits conidiation. We propose that the SNAD protein participates in septation, and is essential for asexual spore formation. SnaD encodes a novel 76-kDa coiled-coil protein (SNAD) that is located at the spindle pole body throughout the cell cycle. Therefore, our results suggest that proteins at the spindle pole body are likely to be involved in temporal regulation of septation in A. nidulans.
