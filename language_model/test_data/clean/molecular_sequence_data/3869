The lytic salmonella phage SP6 encodes a tail protein with a high degree of sequence similarity to the tail protein of the biologically unrelated lysogenic salmonella phage P22. The SP6 tail gene is flanked by an upstream region that contains a promoter and a downstream region that contains a putative Rho-independent transcription terminator, giving it a cassette or modular structure almost identical to the structure of the tail genes of coliphages K1E, K5, and K1-5. It now appears that SP6, K1-5, K5, and K1E are very closely related but have different tail fiber proteins, giving them different host specificities.
