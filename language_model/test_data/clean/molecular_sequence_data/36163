The blood group ABO(H) determinants are major allogenic antigens in both erythrocytes and tissue of man. These antigens and related carbohydrates are markers of cellular maturation and differentiation in many epithelial tissues and have recently attracted great interest as tumor-associated antigens. Previous studies of endometrial tissues have indicated that glycosylation in this tissue may be related to hormonal stimulation. We have investigated the immunohistochemical distribution of type-2 chain histo-blood group-related carbohydrates in specimens of normal, cycling endometria obtained from hysterectomies on women with known ABO/Lewis erythrocyte type and saliva secretor status. N-acetyllactosamine and Le(x) were demonstrated to be uninfluenced by the genetic background. A and Ale(y) antigens were exclusively demonstrated in endometria from blood group A individuals, while Le(y) was expressed in endometria from blood group 0 individuals mainly. The precursor N-acetyllactosamine as well as the terminal H, A, and ALe(y) antigens were shown in only a few cells. In contrast, N-acetyllactosamine substituted by sialic acid and/or fucose residues (Le(x), sialosyl-Le(x), Le(y)) were demonstrated in epithelial cells of normal, cycling endometrium, but with both quantitative and qualitative differences in staining relating to the menstrual cycle, indicating that type-2 chain antigens are expressed under both genetic and hormonal influence in human cycling endometrium.
