Cryptosporidium spp. has been found in more than 150 species of mammals, but there has been no report in mongooses. In this study, we report the isolation of Cryptosporidium sp. in a banded mongoose Mungos mungo, which was brought from Tanzania to Japan; the isolate was analyzed genetically to validate the occurrence of a new, host-adapted genotype. Cryptosporidium diagnostic fragments of 18S ribosomal RNA and 70-kDa heat shock protein genes were amplified from this isolate and compared with the other Cryptosporidium species and genotypes reported previously. Analyses showed that the mongoose isolate represents a new genotype, closely related to that of bears.
