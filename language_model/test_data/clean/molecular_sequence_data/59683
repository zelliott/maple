Coronafacic acid (CFA) is the polyketide component of coronatine (COR), a phytotoxin produced by the plant pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae. In the present study we have determined the nucleotide sequence of a 3.92-kb DNA fragment involved in CFA biosynthesis. Analysis of the sequence revealed four complete open reading frames (ORFs) designated cfa1 to cfa4 and one incomplete ORF (cfa5), all transcribed in the same direction. The predicted translation products of cfa1, cfa2 and cfa3 showed relatedness to acyl carrier proteins, fatty acid dehydrases and beta-ketoacylsynthases, respectively, which are required for polyketide synthesis. cfa1 was subcloned, its sequence was confirmed, and it was overexpressed in E. coli to yield a peptide with an apparent molecular mass of 6 kDa.
