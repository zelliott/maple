Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins are predominantly nuclear RNA-binding proteins that function in a variety of cellular activities. The objective of these experiments was to clone a cDNA for a chicken protein similar to other previously reported heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins for other species. The 5' and 3' ends of the chicken mRNA were cloned using Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE). Subsequently, the expression of the mRNA sequence was confirmed via Northern analysis. The deduced amino acid sequence was approximately 86% identical to corresponding regions of human, mouse, or zebrafish proteins similar to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1. The expression data confirmed the size of the predicted mRNA sequence. The newly identified sequence may be employed in future studies aimed at understanding the role of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins in avian species.
