The isolation and the characterization of two tobacco cDNAs, Nt-ERabp1 and Nt-ERabp2, homologous to Zm-ERabp1, encoding the major auxin-binding protein from maize coleoptiles, are described. Their predicted amino acid sequences correspond to proteins of ca. 21 kDa, in which the characteristic regions common to ABP1-related polypeptides are well-conserved. Southern analysis indicates that the genes corresponding to Nt-ERabp1 cDNA and Nt-ERabp2 cDNA derive respectively from Nicotiana tomentosiformis and Nicotiana sylvestris, the diploid progenitors of Nicotiana tabacum. Analysis of mRNA distribution in tobacco plants indicates that these two genes are preferentially expressed in flowers and growing seedlings. Whatever the tissue tested, Nt-ERabp1 mRNA is more abundant than Nt-ERabp2 mRNA. Furthermore, RT-PCR reveals developmental and organ-specific expression of these two genes in flower parts of tobacco plants. In particular, regulation of Nt-ERabp1 mRNA accumulation appears to be correlated with elongation growth of each floral organ. Recombinant Nt-ERabp1, produced in Escherichia coli, is recognized by antibodies raised against Zm-ERabp1.
