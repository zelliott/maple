The prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen was significantly higher in urban (12.9%) than in rural (7.6%) populations (P = 0.003), but no difference was found in the prevalence of hepatitis delta virus (HDV), which was high in both populations. Phylogenetic analysis showed the circulation of HBV-A3 and -E genotypes and the presence of HDV-1, HDV-7, and HDV-8 clades.
