Two native betagamma dimers, beta(1)gamma(1) and beta(1)gamma(2), display very different affinities for receptors. Since these gamma subunits differ in both primary structure and isoprenoid modification, we examined the relative contributions of each to Gbetagamma interaction with receptors. We constructed baculoviruses encoding gamma(1) and gamma(2) subunits with altered CAAX (where A is an aliphatic amino acid) motifs to direct alternate or no prenylation of the gamma chains and a set of gamma(1) and gamma(2) chimeras with the gamma(2) CAAX motif at the carboxyl terminus. All the gamma constructs coexpressed with beta(1) in Sf9 cells yielded beta(1)gamma dimers, which were purified to near homogeneity, and their affinities for receptors and Galpha were quantitatively determined. Whereas alteration of the isoprenoid of gamma(1) from farnesyl to geranylgeranyl and of gamma(2) from geranylgeranyl to farnesyl had no impact on the affinities of beta(1)gamma dimers for Galpha(t), the non-prenylated beta(1)gamma(2) dimer had significantly diminished affinity. Altered prenylation resulted in a <2-fold decrease in affinity of the beta(1)gamma(2) dimer for rhodopsin and a <3-fold change for the beta(1)gamma(1) dimer. In each case with identical isoprenylation, the beta(1)gamma(2) dimer displayed significantly greater affinity for rhodopsin compared with the beta(1)gamma(1) dimer. Furthermore, dimers containing chimeric Ggamma chains with identical geranylgeranyl modification displayed rhodopsin affinities largely determined by the carboxyl-terminal one-third of the protein. These results indicate that isoprenoid modification of the Ggamma subunit is essential for binding to both Galpha and receptors. The isoprenoid type influences the binding affinity for receptors, but not for Galpha. Finally, the primary structure of the Ggamma subunit provides a major contribution to receptor binding of Gbetagamma, with the carboxyl-terminal sequence conferring receptor selectivity.
