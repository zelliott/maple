The c-myb gene is primarily expressed in immature hematopoietic cells, and it is overexpressed in many leukemias. We have investigated the role of negative regulatory sites in the c-myb promoter in the Molt-4 T cell line and in the DHL-9 B cell line. A potential binding site for either the EGR-1 or WT1 protein was identified by in vivo footprinting in the 5'-flanking region of c-myb in a region of negative regulatory activity in T cells. We showed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay Western that WT1, EGR-1, and Sp1 bound to this site. A mutation of this site which prevented protein binding increased the activity of the c-myb promoter by 2.5-fold. In the DHL-9 B cell line, this site was nonfunctional; however, we found a potential EGF-1/WT1 site located more 3' in a region of negative regulatory activity. We showed that WT1, EGR-1, and Sp1 bound to this site, and that mutation of this site increased the activity of the c-myb promoter by 3.2-fold. Cotransfection of a WT1 expression vector repressed the activity of the c-myb promoter in both cell lines, and this repression was relieved when the EGR-1/WT1 sites were removed. Cotransfection of either an EGR-1 or Sp1 expression vector had no significant effect on the activity of the c-myb promoter. We conclude that WT1 is a negative regulator of c-myb expression in both T and B cell lines.
