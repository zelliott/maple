The rapidity with which molecular sequence data are gathered continues to grow. The result is that, for many workers, it is increasingly difficult to keep abreast of the current state of play of molecular cloning, even for those genes that encode proteins of special interest. The clear success of the various worldwide genome projects has made this even more apparent, and by the end of 1996 the complete determination of the nucleotide sequences of the genomes of two eukaryotes, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans, will have either been completed or will be nearing completion. This article is an attempt to provide, in an easily accessible format, a compilation of genes and cDNAs that have been sequenced and deposited in GenBank that encode transferase enzymes involved in eukaryotic glycoprotein or glycolipid biosynthesis. The full sequence information can be easily retrieved from a databank, e.g. GenBank, using the relevant accession number(s).
