The bifunctional alkylating agent 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane forms interstrand DNA-DNA cross-links between the N7 positions of deoxyguanosine residues on opposite strands of the duplex. For racemic diepoxybutane, these cross-links predominate within 5'-GNC/3'CNG sequences, where N is any nucleotide. We used denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (dPAGE) to examine the role of stereochemistry in the cross-linking reaction, subjecting a restriction fragment to cross-linking with S,S-DEB, R,R-DEB, or meso-DEB. DNA cross-links generated by each isomer were isolated by dPAGE, and the sites of cross-linking were identified by sequencing gel analysis of DNA fragments generated by hot piperidine cleavage. We found that the 5'-GNC consensus sequence of racemic DEB is conserved, but the efficiencies of cross-linking vary, with S,S- > R,R- > meso-DEB. These results help explain the observed differences between the biological activities of DEB stereoisomers.
