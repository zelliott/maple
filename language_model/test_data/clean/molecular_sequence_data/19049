SQUAMOSA promoter binding protein-likes (SPLs) are plant-specific transcription factors playing vital regulatory roles in plant growth and development. There is no information about SPLs in Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen), a significant medicinal plant widely used in Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for >1,700 years and an emerging model plant for TCM studies. Through genome-wide identification and subsequent molecular cloning, we identified a total 15 SmSPLs with divergent sequence features, gene structures, and motifs. Comparative analysis showed sequence conservation between SmSPLs and their Arabidopsis counterparts. A phylogenetic tree clusters SmSPLs into six groups. Many of the motifs identified commonly exist in a group/subgroup, implying their functional redundancy. Eight SmSPLs were predicted and experimentally validated to be targets of miR156/157. SmSPLs were differentially expressed in various tissues of S. milltiorrhiza. The expression of miR156/157-targeted SmSPLs was increased with the maturation of S. miltiorrhiza, whereas the expression of miR156/157 was decreased, confirming the regulatory roles of miR156/157 in SmSPLs and suggesting the functions of SmSPLs in S. miltiorrhiza development. The expression of miR156/157 was negatively correlated with miR172 during the maturation of S. miltiorrhiza. The results indicate the significance and complexity of SmSPL-, miR156-, and miR172-mediated regulation of developmental timing in S. miltiorrhiza.
