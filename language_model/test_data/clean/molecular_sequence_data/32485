HIV-1 CRF01_AE is the main prevalent HIV-1 recombinant strain in China and the dominant strain in Fujian as well; therefore, obtaining and understanding the genetic characterization of this clade become important. To date only a few full-length HIV-1 CRF01_AE genomes from China have been sequenced. We reported 13 full-length HIV-1 CRF01_AE isolate sequences from Fujian, China. DNA was extracted, the 5' and 3' halves of each genome were separately amplified, and the PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The phylogenetic analysis of the 13 sequences showed that they clustered with HIV-1 CRF01_AE isolates; these isolates were separated into a few distinct subgroups and were dispersed among the Thailand isolates, and the intersample diversity among Fujian isolates was significantly high. The high gene diversity among Fujian HIV-1 CRF01_AE isolates indicates that the HIV-1 CRF01_AE viruses in Fujian may be transmitted from multiple introductions. The work is essential for the design and development of an effective AIDS vaccine for China.
