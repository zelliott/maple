The synthesis of a substrate for the endothelin converting enzyme using the continuous flow FMOC solid phase method has been accomplished. The allyl group, employed to protect Glu side chain, was cleanly removed during the synthesis in the presence of tert.-butyl based protecting groups to enable the introduction of the Edans moiety. The substrate was obtained in 31% yield after reverse phase hplc purification.
