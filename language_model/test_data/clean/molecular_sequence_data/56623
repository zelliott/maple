Using oligonucleotide probes, sequences containing the Mbcr locus involved in chromosome translocation t(9:22) were cloned form the library of human genes in the Charon 4A vector. The recombinant clone lambda BCR 1.1 obtained contained Mbcr sequences, but the 3' region of the Mbcr locus in lambda BCR 1.1 clone was strongly altered. Subcloning of a fragment of the altered region and blot hybridization analysis using it as a DNA probe revealed recombination in the 3' region of the Mbcr locus in clone lambda BCR 1.1 which resulted in insertion of unknown sequences into the region. A modified system is suggested for chromosome 22 breakpoint identification using restriction analysis of genome DNA with four restriction endonucleases and one 5'-DNA probe.
