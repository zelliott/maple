We have identified a novel, maternally expressed imprinted gene encoding a C/D-box small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) called MBII-343, which may regulate RNA editing or alternative splicing of an as yet unknown target gene. This gene is closely linked to an imprinted gene, Meg3, on mouse distal chromosome 12, which is syntenic to human chromosome 14. The paternal duplication of mouse distal chromosome 12 leads to late embryonal/neonatal lethality, growth promotion, and cardiomyopathy, whereas maternal duplication leads to late embryonal lethality and growth retardation. Human paternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 14 leads to musculoskeletal problems and mental retardation, whereas maternal uniparental disomy leads to intrauterine growth retardation, motor developmental delay, premature puberty, hypotonia, joint laxity, macrocephaly, short statue, neonatal poor sucking, skill with jigsaw puzzles, skin picking, obesity, and maturity onset diabetes of the young.
