A cloned cDNA has been isolated by probing a sheep blastocyst cDNA library using a synthetic oligonucleotide representing the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the antiluteolytic protein, ovine trophoblast protein-1. Sequence analysis of the cDNA confirms the 70% homology between the antiluteolysin and the interferon-alpha family of proteins; however, the sequence reported here differs at several points from previously reported amino acid and cDNA sequences for the antiluteolysin. In-vitro translation of day-16 poly(A)+ RNA indicated that antiluteolysin mRNA is a major constituent of total mRNA at this stage of blastocyst development, and Northern blotting confirmed that antiluteolysin mRNA production occurred between days 13 and 22 after oestrus. This is consistent with the stage at which embryonic extracts are antiluteolytic on administration in vivo. These and other data confirm that the ovine trophoblast antiluteolysin is an interferon, and suggest that at least five isoforms of this protein may exist.
