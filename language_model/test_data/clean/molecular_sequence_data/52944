Based upon the nucleotide sequence of the relA gene from Escherichia coli, a gene fragment corresponding to the homologous gene from the pathogenic oral bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis 381 was isolated by PCR and utilized to construct a relA mutant. The mutant, KS7, was defective in ribosome-mediated ppGpp formation and also in the stringent response.
