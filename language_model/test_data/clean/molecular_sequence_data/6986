Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.
