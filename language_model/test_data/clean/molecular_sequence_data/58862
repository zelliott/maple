Internal eliminated segments (IESs) are sequences that interrupt coding and noncoding regions of germline (micronuclear) genes of ciliated protozoa. IESs are flanked by short, unique repeat sequences, which are presumably required for precise IES excision during macronuclear development. Coding and noncoding segments of genes separated by IESs are called macronuclear-destined segments, or MDSs. We have compiled the characteristics of 89 individual IESs in 12 micronuclear genes in the Oxytricha and Stylonychia genera to define the IES phenomenon precisely, a first step in determining the origin, function and significance of IESs. Although all 89 IESs among the 12 different genes are AT-rich, they show no other similarity in sequence, length, position or number. Two main types of IESs are present. IESs that separate scrambled MDSs are significantly shorter and more frequent and have longer flanking repeat sequences than IESs that intervene between nonscrambled MDSs. A comparison of the nonscrambled gene encoding beta-telomere binding protein in three species of hypotrichs shows that even in the same gene IESs are not conserved in sequence, length, position, or number from species to species. A comparison of IESs in the scrambled gene encoding actin I in the three species shows that the evolutionary behavior of IESs in a scrambled gene may be more constrained. However, IESs in the scrambled actin I gene have shifted along the DNA molecule during evolution. In total, the various studies show that IESs are hypermutable in sequence and length. They insert, excise, and shift along DNA molecules more or less randomly during evolution, with no discernible function or consequences.
