The three-dimensional structure of ferredoxin, purified from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, was determined in aqueous solution by two-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance. In addition to the 946 distance constraints from nuclear Overhauser effect connectivities, we added 241 distance constraints derived from the crystal structure of Spirulina platensis ferredoxin to the 19 residues close to the [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur center, where crosspeaks disappeared due to paramagnetic effects. The atomic root-mean-square difference of the ten converged structures from the mean structure was 0.61(+/-0.12) A for backbone atoms (N, C(alpha), C'). The main-chain structure was almost the same as the crystal structures of other mesophile ferredoxins, but comparison of the side-chain structures revealed an extension of the hydrophobic core, a unique hydrophobic patch on the surface of the large beta-sheet, and two unique charge networks in this thermostable ferredoxin structure, some of which might contribute to thermostability.
