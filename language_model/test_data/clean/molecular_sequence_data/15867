The lipase gene from Pseudomonas fragi IFO-12049 was isolated using the expression library and the primary structure of lipase deduced from the nucleotide sequence was determined. It is composed of 277 amino acid residues and a protein of Mr 29,966, which was close to the value of the lipase expressed in E. coli.
