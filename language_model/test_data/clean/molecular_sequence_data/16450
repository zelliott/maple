Six kinds of new insertion sequences (ISs), IS667 to IS672, a group II intron (Oi.Int), and an incomplete transposon (Tn852loi) were identified in the 3,630,528-bp genome of the extremely halotolerant and alkaliphilic Oceanobacillus iheyensis HTE831. Of 19 ISs identified in the HTE831 genome, 7 were truncated, indicating the occurrence of internal rearrangement of the genome. All ISs except IS669 generated a 4- to 8-bp duplication of the target site sequence, and these ISs carried 23- to 28-bp inverted repeats (IRs). Sequence analysis revealed that four ISs (IS669, IS670, IS671, and IS672) were newly identified as belonging to separate IS families (IS200/IS605, IS30, IS5, and IS3, respectively). IS667 and IS668 were also characterized as new members of the ISL3 family. Tn8521oi, which belongs to the Tn3 family as a new member, generated a 5-bp duplication of the target site sequence and carried complete 38-bp IRs. Of the eight protein-coding sequences (CDSs) identified in Tn8521oi, three CDSs (OB481, OB482, and OB483) formed a ger gene cluster, and two other paralogous gene clusters were found in the HTE831 genome. Most of the ISs and the group II intron widely distributed throughout the genome were inserted in noncoding regions, while two ISs (IS667-08 and IS668-02) and Oi.Int-04 were inserted in the coding regions.
