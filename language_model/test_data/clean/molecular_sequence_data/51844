Red deer growth hormone (cGH; 3.3 mg) was purified from an aqueous extract of seven pituitary glands (4.01 g wet weight) by preparative gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 SF, and anion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B. Purified cGH gave a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a molecular weight under reducing conditions of 20,000 Da and gave a single peak on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. N-Terminal amino acid determination of 42 residues gave a sequence identical with those published for bovine and ovine GH. In a radioreceptor assay based on binding of iodinated recombinant bovine GH (rbGH) to liver microsomes prepared from a pregnant ewe, cGH was equipotent with an ovine GH (oGH) standard. In an oGH radioimmunoassay, cGH diluted in parallel with oGH and rbGH. Using this assay plasma GH concentrations were determined in adult nonpregnant red deer hinds over a 12-month period. There was a significant seasonality in plasma GH concentrations with concentrations consistently low between mid-May and mid-September. This is the period when voluntary food intake and liveweight gain are greatest. It is suggested that in the presence of low plasma GH concentrations nutrients may be diverted toward lipogenesis and hence promote fat deposition.
