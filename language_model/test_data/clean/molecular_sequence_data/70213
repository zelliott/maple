An enzyme with the specificity of a prolyl endopeptidase was purified approximately 329-fold from rat skin. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 70,000 as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a pH optimum of 5.8 as checked with 7-(Succinyl-Gly-Pro)-4- methylcoumarinamide (Suc-Gly-Pro-MCA) as the substrate. The optimal temperature for the enzyme activity was 40 degrees C. The Km and Vmax values for Suc-Gly-Pro-MCA were 0.7 mM and 68 nmol/min per mg protein, respectively. The enzyme activity was markedly inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, N-ethylmaleimide, Zn2+ and Cu2+, while it was partially inhibited by phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride. The purified enzyme was shown to release the N-terminal tetrapeptide, Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro, from substance P producing the C-terminal heptapeptide, Gln-Gln-Phe-Phe-Gly-Met- CONH2. In the skin, this enzyme might be related to the inactivation of substance P.
