Full proton, 13C and 31P NMR assignments for the capsular polysaccharide from Streptococcus pneumoniae Type 17F are reported, and a revised structure differing in the anomeric configuration of the sidechain beta-Galp residue proposed. This polysaccharide is a component of the current 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine. The implications of this revised structure for published work are discussed.
