The inner core of neisserial lipooligosaccharide (LOS) contains heptose residues that can be decorated by phosphoethanolamine (PEA). PEA modification of heptose II (HepII) can occur at the 3, 6, or 7 position(s). We used a genomic DNA sequence of lpt3, derived from Neisseria meningitidis MC58, to search the genomic sequence of N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 and identified a homolog of lpt3 in N. gonorrhoeae. A PCR amplicon containing lpt3 was amplified from F62DeltaLgtA, cloned, mutagenized, and inserted into the chromosome of N. gonorrhoeae strain F62DeltaLgtA, producing strain F62DeltaLgtAlpt3::Tn5. LOS isolated from this strain lost the ability to bind monoclonal antibody (MAb) 2-1-L8. Complementation of this mutation by genetic removal of the transposon insertion restored MAb 2-1-L8 binding. Mass spectrometry analysis of LOS isolated from the F62DeltaLgtA indicated that this strain contained two PEA modifications on its LOS. F62DeltaLgtAlpt3::Tn5 lacked a PEA modification on its LOS, a finding consistent with the hypothesis that lpt3 encodes a protein mediating PEA addition onto gonococcal LOS. The DNA encoding lpt3 was cloned into an expression vector and Lpt3 was purified. Purified Lpt3 was able to mediate the addition of PEA to LOS isolated from F62DeltaLgtAlpt3::Tn5.
