We describe the isolation and characterization of the murine gene encoding RHAMM, a hyaluronan receptor which regulates focal adhesion turnover, is required for cell locomotion and is a critical downstream regulator of ras transformation. The RHAMM gene spans at least 20 kb and comprises 14 exons ranging in size from 75 to 1099 bp. Primer extension studies indicate that the major transcription start point is in position -31, relative to the start Met. Northern blot analysis of mouse fibroblast RNA identified two hybridizing species of 4.2 and 1.7 kb. Comparison of cDNA clones and RT-PCR products with the genomic clones identified alternately spliced exons in both the coding and 5' noncoding regions of RHAMM. In the coding region exon 4 is alternately spliced. The major RHAMM transcript (RHAMM1) in 3T3 fibroblasts does not contain exon 4 and encodes a protein of 70 kDa. A minor transcript containing exon 4, namely RHAMM v4, encodes a 73-kDa protein, as demonstrated by isoform-specific antibodies. Western analysis demonstrated both a major 70-kDa (RHAMM 1) and minor 73-kDa RHAMM protein (v4) in 3T3 murine fibroblast cell lysates. The functional significance of these two isoforms is currently being investigated.
