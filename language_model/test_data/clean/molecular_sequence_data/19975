Laboratory detection of Pseudomonas spp., particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is an important assay in the nosocomial control. The study was designed firstly to establish a new assay-applied LightCycler polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology with melting curve analysis (MCA). A total of 224 Gram-negative isolates were used to verify the assay system. The PCR with MCA method using the P. aeruginosa-specific gyrase B gene primers was rapid and accurate; the total run is approximately 3 h, and the sensitivity and specificity relative to the Vitek (bioMerieux, Hazelwood, MO) results were 98.1% and 100%, respectively. Vitek identification system was not able to identify the isolates from the new Pseudomonas otitidis spp. opposite to the real-time PCR. This assay was validated to be accurate with an overall sensitivity and specificity of 98.7% and 98.9%, respectively. Conclusively, this rapid and accurate PCR assay with MCA will help to manage and control infections with P. aeruginosa.
