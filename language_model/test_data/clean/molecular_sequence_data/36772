Lamb pregastric lipase was purified from a commercial source using delipidation, solubilization with KSCN, acid-precipitation, pepsin-digestion, affinity chromatography with agarose-Cibacron Blue F3GA, gel filtration, and elution from a native 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. The enzyme had a single subunit of 68,000 Da with maximum esterase activity when measured at pH 6.0 and 30 degrees C. The enzyme preferentially hydrolyzed short- and medium-chain (C4, C6, and C8) synthetic esters and short-chain (C4 and C6) monoacid triglycerides. The NH2-terminal sequence demonstrated high homology with gastric and lingual lipases.
