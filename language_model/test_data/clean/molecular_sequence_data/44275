We have used circular permutation assays to determine the extent and location of the DNA bend induced by the DNA binding domain of human wild type p53 (p53DBD) upon binding to several naturally occurring DNA response elements. We have found that p53DBD binding induces axial bending in all of the response elements investigated. In particular, response elements having a d(CATG) sequence at the junction of two consensus pentamers in each half-site favor highly bent complexes (bending angle is approximately 50 degrees ), whereas response elements having d(CTTG) bases at this position are less bent (bending angles from approximately 37 to approximately 25 degrees ). Quantitative electrophoretic mobility shift assays of different complexes show a direct correlation between the DNA bending angle and the binding affinity of the p53DBD with the response elements, i.e. the greater the stability of the complex, the more the DNA is bent by p53DBD binding. The study provides evidence that the energetics of DNA bending, as determined by the presence or absence of flexible sites in the response elements, may contribute significantly to the overall binding affinity of the p53DBD for different sequences. The results therefore suggest that both the structure and the stability of the p53-DNA complex may vary with different response elements. This variability may be correlated with variability in p53 function.
