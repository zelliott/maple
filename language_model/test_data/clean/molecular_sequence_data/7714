Streptococcus bovis is commonly present in the rumen, but strains of S. bovis have also occasionally been isolated from human blood or fecal samples. Studies were undertaken with 16s rRNA gene sequences and DNA hybridizations to define the genetic relationships between these two groups of strains. Ruminal strains were found to yield genomic DNA restriction endonuclease digest patterns different from human strains when either the 16s rRNA gene amplified from ruminal S. bovis strain JB1 or a conserved universal 23s rRNA fragment was used as probes. A DNA probe based on the V1 region of the 16s rRNA of S. bovis JB1 was found to hybridize to DNAs of other ruminal S. bovis strains (K27FF4, 21-09-6C, five new ruminal isolates, and weak hybridization was found with DNAs from S. bovis 33317 (type strain), S. equinus 9812, and six other ruminal isolates. No hybridization occurred with strains representing different major human biotypes/homology groups (43143, 43144, 27960, V1387). All ruminal S. bovis strains had a guanosine plus cytosine DNA content of 37.4-38.8 mol% and, based on DNA-DNA genomic hybridizations, could be separated into two homology groups, one of which included S. equinus 9812 and S. bovis 33317. Both ruminal groups had less than 38% DNA homology to the human strains, indicating ruminal strains are clearly two separate species distinct from the human strains.
