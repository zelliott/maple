Single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS-1) was characterized for 58 isolates of Pythium, representing 41 species from the five groups of Plaats-Niterink. Thirty-one species each produced a distinct SSCP pattern. Three species produced more than one unique pattern, corresponding to morphological subgrouping. The remaining seven species produced three distinct patterns with two or three morphologically similar species sharing a pattern. A successful blind test with four samples and the identification of eight previously unknown isolates from irrigation water demonstrated the reliability of this technique for species identification. Each SSCP pattern was defined and described by the positions of the top and bottom bands and the number of bands in between, which allows laboratories to use this technique without need to access the type isolates of Pythium species.
