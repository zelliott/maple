For the evaluation of immunomodulators by in vitro assays, agents working reproducibly are difficult to obtain; conventional preparations of bacterial immunomodulators tend to vary for different preparations. Here we suggest that synthetic lipopeptide analogues derived from bacterial lipoprotein can be used as standards for various in vitro assays: studying B lymphocyte activation, lipopeptides act as potent mitogens and polyclonal activators inducing immunoglobulin synthesis. In monocytes/macrophages, lipopeptide stimulate the secretion of IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and nitrogen oxide (NO); they also induce tumor cytotoxicity. Lipopeptides also constitute potent immuno-adjuvants in vitro and in vivo, either in combination with or covalently bound to antigen. These activities are displayed in various species; in mice they are found in LPS non-responder and responder strains. The novel synthetic lipopeptides described here can be synthesized readily in gram amounts with high purity and reproducibility; they are non-toxic and can be stored for a long time even at room temperature. Thus, lipopeptides meet the requirements to serve as effective standards for a multitude of relevant biological assays.
