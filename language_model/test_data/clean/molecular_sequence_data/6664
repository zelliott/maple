A novel method for the identification of hepatitis B virus (HBV) variants was developed. The ligase chain reaction (LCR) distinguished the sequences of two isolates from the Gambia showing a change at nucleotide 421 within the region coding for the surface protein a antigenic determinant. One sequence was derived from a child previously immunized with HBV vaccine, while the other, reported here for the first time, was from a chronic carrier. Nucleotide variations within the target sequence at, or up to 3 bases from the point of ligation inhibited the reaction. The LCR recognised variations in as little as 0.9 fmol DNA and will permit the rapid detection of HBV variants in molecular epidemiological studies.
