Infections caused by human enteroviruses (EVs) are often asymptomatic or mild, although they may cause more severe illnesses as meningitis and acute flaccid paralysis. EVs have globally posed a threat to children, and outbreaks of aseptic meningitis and hand, foot and mouth disease are frequently reported.

To identify EV strains circulating among healthy children in a small community in Limbe, Cameroon two years apart.

Species and EV types were obtained by partial 5'UTR-VP4 and VP1 sequencing of RNA from stool samples collected in October 2009 and September 2011 from 150 children in Cameroon.

In all, 74 children (49%) were infected with 28 different types of EV. There were 29 (54%) infected children in 2009, and 45 (47%) in 2011. There was a significant difference between detected species of EV, with 15 (47%) children infected with EV-A in 2009, and 22 (71%) with EV-B in 2011 (p=0.0001). In 2009, one child was infected by a divergent EV, which was most similar to EV-A90. Based on the complete VP1 sequence, it was shown to be a new EV designated EV-A119.

The current study shows a high heterogeneity of circulating EV types among children in Limbe, Cameroon, and a previously not described shift in predominating EV species.
