The 5' flanking region of the mig gene, a member of the chemokine family of small m.w. chemoattractant and growth regulatory factors, contains an IFN-gamma-responsive enhancer, gamma RE-1, consisting of an extended imperfect palindrome. In this report we show that a novel factor, gamma RF-1, which binds to the gamma RE-1 element, is rapidly activated in a variety of primary cell types and tumor cell lines treated with IFN-gamma. Our data indicate that gamma RF-1 is present in a latent form in unstimulated cells and its DNA-binding activity is dependent upon tyrosine phosphorylation. UV cross-linking studies revealed that gamma RF-1 consists of at least two proteins of approximately 95 and 130 kDa, which interact with the gamma RE-1 element. A comparison of gamma RF-1 and GAF, an IFN-gamma-activated transcription factor containing the p91/Stat1 alpha protein (Stat, signal transducer and activator of transcription), showed that these two factors exhibited differences in electrophoretic mobility, responsiveness to IFN-alpha, and kinetics of activation. Using anti-Stat Ab, however, we found that one or more subunits of gamma RF-1 are antigenically related to p91/Stat1 alpha. Our results indicate, therefore, that gamma RF-1 and GAF are distinct IFN-gamma-responsive transcription factors and probably contain closely related members of the Stat protein family.
