Antibodies directed to the A2 domain of factor VIII (fVIII) are usually an important component of the polyclonal response in patients who have clinically significant inhibitory antibodies to fVIII. A major determinant of the A2 epitope has been located by homolog scanning mutagenesis using recombinant hybrid human/porcine fVIII molecules to a sequence bounded by Arg484-Ile508 (Healey, J. F. , Lubin, I. M., Nakai, H., Saenko, E. L., Hoyer, L. W., Scandella, D. , and Lollar, P. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 14505-14509). Within this region, human residues Arg484, Pro485, Tyr487, Ser488, Arg489, Pro492, Val495, Phe501, and Ile508 differ from porcine fVIII. We stably expressed in mammalian cells nine active B-domainless human fVIII molecules containing single alanine substitutions at these sites. Their inhibition by a murine anti-A2 monoclonal antibody, monoclonal antibody (mAb) 413, and by three A2-specific alloimmune and two A2-specific autoimmune human inhibitor plasmas was measured by the Bethesda assay. The inhibition of Arg484 --> Ala, Tyr487 --> Ala, Arg489 --> Ala, and Arg492 --> Ala by mAb413 was reduced by greater than 90% compared with wild-type, B-domainless human fVIII. mAb413 inhibited the most severely affected mutant, Arg489 --> Ala, 0.01% as well as wild-type fVIII. For all five patient plasmas, the Tyr487 --> Ala mutant displayed the greatest reduction in inhibition. The inhibition of the Tyr487 --> Ala mutant by these antibodies ranged from 10% to 20% that of wild-type fVIII. The inhibition of the Ser488 --> Ala, Arg489 --> Ala, Pro492 --> Ala, Val495 --> Ala, Phe501 --> Ala, and Ile508 --> Ala mutants by most of the plasmas also was significantly reduced. In contrast, the Arg484 --> Ala and Pro485 --> Ala mutants were relatively unaffected. Thus, although mAb413 binds to the same region as human A2 inhibitors, it recognizes a different set of amino acid side chains. The side chains recognized by human A2 inhibitors appear to be similar, despite the differing immune settings that give rise to fVIII alloantibodies and autoantibodies.
