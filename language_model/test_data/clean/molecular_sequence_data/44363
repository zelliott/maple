2-Oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase, an enzyme involved in quinoline degradation by Pseudomonas putida 86, had been identified as a class IB two-component nonheme iron oxygenase based on its biochemical and biophysical properties (B. Rosche, B. Tshisuaka, S. Fetzner, and F. Lingens, J. Biol. Chem. 270:17836-17842, 1995). The genes oxoR and oxoO, encoding the reductase and the oxygenase components of the enzyme, were sequenced and analyzed. oxoR was localized approximately 15 kb downstream of oxoO. Expression of both genes was detected in a recombinant Pseudomonas strain. In the deduced amino acid sequence of the NADH:(acceptor) reductase component (OxoR, 342 amino acids), putative binding sites for a chloroplast-type [2Fe-2S] center, for flavin adenine dinucleotide, and for NAD were identified. The arrangement of these cofactor binding sites is conserved in all known class IB reductases. A dendrogram of reductases confirmed the similarity of OxoR to other class IB reductases. The oxygenase component (OxoO, 446 amino acids) harbors the conserved amino acid motifs proposed to bind the Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster and the mononuclear iron. In contrast to known class IB oxygenase components, which are composed of differing subunits, OxoO is a homomultimer, which is typical for class IA oxygenases. Sequence comparison of oxygenases indeed revealed that OxoO is more related to class IA than to class IB oxygenases. Thus, 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase consists of a class IB-like reductase and a class IA-like oxygenase. These results support the hypothesis that multicomponent enzymes may be composed of modular elements having different phylogenetic origins.
