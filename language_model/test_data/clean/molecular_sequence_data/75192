The complete amino acid sequence of the catalytic domain of rat brain hexokinase (ATP:D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.1) has been deduced from the nucleotide sequence of cloned cDNA. Extensive similarity in sequence, taken to indicate similarity in secondary and tertiary structure, is seen between the mammalian enzyme and yeast hexokinase isozymes A and B. All residues critical for binding glucose to the yeast enzyme are conserved in brain hexokinase. A location for the substrate ATP binding site is proposed based on relation of structural features in the yeast enzyme to characteristics commonly observed in other nucleotide binding enzymes; sequences in regions proposed to be important for binding of ATP to the yeast enzyme are highly conserved in brain hexokinase.
