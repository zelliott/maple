We have sequenced the 0.7-kb-long fragment of Drosophila DNA which ensures the autonomous replication of plasmids in yeast. Deletion mapping has shown the ARS element to consist of at least two domains: the core having the consensus 11-bp sequence TAAATATAAAT and the enhancer which is no more than 90 bp long and is located at the 3'-end of the A-rich core strand. Neither domain per se ensures plasmid replication in yeast. A comparison of the enhancer sequence with the sequences of 14 different ARS elements failed to reveal significant homology areas. Most probably the ARS flanks that are adjacent to the core and act as enhancer do not carry any consensus. They may determine a peculiar structural feature of DNA (for example bends) which are necessary for the protein-ARS interaction.
