A bacterial strain designated Npb-07(T) was isolated from a freshwater river in Taiwan and characterized using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Strain Npb-07(T) was Gram-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped and motile by means of a single polar flagellum. Growth occurred at 10-37 °C (optimum, 20-30 °C), at pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum, pH 6.0-7.0) and with 0-1 % NaCl (optimum, 0.5 %). Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain Npb-07(T) belonged to the genus Vogesella and its most closely related neighbour was Vogesella indigofera ATCC 19706(T) with sequence similarity of 98.4 %. The major fatty acids were summed feature 3 (comprising C16 : 1ω7c and/or C16 : 1ω6c, 44.4 %) and C16 : 0 (31.9 %). The major respiratory quinone was Q-8. The DNA G+C content of the genomic DNA was 65.3 mol%. The polar lipid profile consisted of a mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, two uncharacterized aminophospholipids and an uncharacterized phospholipid. The DNA-DNA relatedness of strain Npb-07(T) with respect to V. indigofera ATCC 19706(T) was less than 70 %. On the basis of the genotypic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic data, strain Npb-07(T) represents a novel species in the genus Vogesella, for which the name Vogesella fluminis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is Npb-07(T) ( = LMG 26669(T) = BCRC 80377(T) = KCTC 23713(T)).
