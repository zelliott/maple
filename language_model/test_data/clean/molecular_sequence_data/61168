Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are involved in the deacetylation of core histones, which is an important event in transcription regulation in eukaryotes through alterations in the chromatin structure. We cloned cDNAs and genomic DNAs encoding two chicken HDACs (chHDAC-1 and -2), which are preferentially localized in nuclei. Treatment with trichostatin A reduced the HDAC activities in immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-chHDAC-1 and -2 antisera. Using gene targeting techniques, we generated homozygous DT40 mutants, DeltachHDAC-1 and -2, devoid of two alleles of the chHDAC-1 and -2 genes, respectively. The protein patterns on two-dimensional PAGE definitely changed for DeltachHDAC-2, and the amounts of the IgM H- and L-chains increased in it. Of the two IgM H-chain forms, the secreted form mu(s) increased in DeltachHDAC-2, but the membrane-bound form mu(m) decreased. The IgM H-chain gene was transcribed more in DeltachHDAC-2 than in DT40 cells. In the mutant, the alternative processing of IgM H-chain pre-mRNA preferentially occurred, resulting in an increase in the amount of mu(s) mRNA, whereas the stability of the two types of mRNA, mu(s) and mu(m), was unchanged. In DT40 cells, treatment with trichostatin A increased both the amounts of IgM H-chain mRNAs and the switch from mu(m) to mu(s) mRNAs. Based on these results, we propose a model for a role of chHDAC-2 in both the transcription and alternative processing steps, resulting in control of the amount of the mu(s) IgM H-chain in the DT40 cell line.
