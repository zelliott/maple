The hydrolysis of Ac-(Ala)2-Lys-Nph-(Ala)2-amide (II) by penicillopepsin is characterized by a solvent isotope effect of 2.11, whereas the hydrolysis of Ac-Lys-Nph-amide (I) shows no solvent isotope effect. The dependence of the isotope effect on the concentration of D2O in H2O for substrate II is not linear and suggests that two or more protons are involved in its rate-determining step. We propose that for substrate I the rate-determining step is the distortion of the scissile bond towards a tetrahedral configuration, and for substrate II a conformational change induced by the occupation of the S3 pocket in the enzyme.
