A 2.3-kb genomic clone has been isolated from the region where the tissue-specific puff, Balbiani ring a (BRa), is found on chromosome IV of the special lobe of Chironomus thummi salivary gland cells. The clone was characterized by nucleotide sequence analysis. Two clusters of direct tandem repeats were identified, as well as large and small open reading frames (ORFs). The large ORF was fused to an Escherichia coli lacZ gene. Antibodies against the beta-galactosidase/ORF fusion protein reacted selectively on Western blots with a 67-kDa protein. Western-blot analysis and immunoelectron microscopy showed that this protein was distributed in the cells of all larval tissues examined. We concluded that BRa, a tissue-specific puff, whose activity correlates with the synthesis of 160-kDa secretory protein [Kolesnikov et al., Chromosoma 83 (1981) 661-677], may also contain a gene which is not expressed in a tissue-specific manner.
