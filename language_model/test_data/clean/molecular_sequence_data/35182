Iron-rich flocs often occur where anoxic water containing ferrous iron encounters oxygenated environments. Culture-independent molecular analyses have revealed the presence of 16S rRNA gene sequences related to diverse bacteria, including autotrophic iron oxidizers and methanotrophs in iron-rich flocs; however, the metabolic functions of the microbial communities remain poorly characterized, particularly regarding carbon cycling. In the present study, we cultivated iron-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) and performed clone library analyses of functional genes related to carbon fixation and methane oxidization (cbbM and pmoA, respectively), in addition to bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes, in freshwater iron-rich flocs at groundwater discharge points. The analyses of 16S rRNA, cbbM, and pmoA genes strongly suggested the coexistence of autotrophic iron oxidizers and methanotrophs in the flocs. Furthermore, a novel stalk-forming microaerophilic FeOB, strain OYT1, was isolated and characterized phylogenetically and physiologically. The 16S rRNA and cbbM gene sequences of OYT1 are related to those of other microaerophilic FeOB in the family Gallionellaceae, of the Betaproteobacteria, isolated from freshwater environments at circumneutral pH. The physiological characteristics of OYT1 will help elucidate the ecophysiology of microaerophilic FeOB. Overall, this study demonstrates functional roles of microorganisms in iron flocs, suggesting several possible linkages between Fe and C cycling.
