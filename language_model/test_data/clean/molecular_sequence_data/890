CD155 (poliovirus receptor) localizes in cell-matrix adhesions and cell-cell junctions, but its role in the regulation of cell adhesion and cell motility has not been investigated. We identified a conserved immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in the cytoplasmic domain of human CD155alpha. The ITIM was tyrosine-phosphorylated upon binding of anti-CD155 monoclonal antibody D171, poliovirus, and DNAM-1 (CD226) to human CD155alpha, and recruited SH2-domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP-2). After CD155alpha stimulation with its ligands, cell adhesion was inhibited and cell motility was enhanced, effects that were associated with the phosphorylation of ITIM by Src kinases and accompanied by dephosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin. These effects were abolished by introducing a point-mutation in Y398F into the ITIM of CD155alpha and by coexpression of a dominant negative SHP-2 mutant with CD155alpha. These results suggest that CD155alpha plays a role in the regulation of cell adhesion and cell motility.
