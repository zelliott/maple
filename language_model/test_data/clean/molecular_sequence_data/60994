Phylogenetic relationships among 55 species of Lilium, Cardiocrinum giganteum, and Nomocharis saluenensis were inferred from nucleotide sequence variations in the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of 18S-25S nuclear ribosomal DNA. The phylogeny derived from ITS sequences estimated using maximum-likelihood methods indicated that (1) most of the species construct their own clade according to the classification based on morphological features at the section level; (2) section Daurolirion is not independent of Sinomartagon, and it is appropriate to integrate two sections as Sinomartagon; (3) it is appropriate that L. henryi and L. bulbiferum are classified into subsection 6a and Sinomartagon-Daurolirion, respectively; (4) subsection 6b is much closer to Sinomartagon than subsection 6a and Archelirion, and it arose directly from Sinomartagon; and (5) Lilium is much closer to Nomocharis than Cardiocrinum. Phylogenetic estimation using sequences of the ITS region is suitable at the levels of genus, section, and most of subsection.
