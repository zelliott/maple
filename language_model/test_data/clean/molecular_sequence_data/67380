Aeromonas hydrophila is one of the major pathogenic bacteria for fish and people. To develop an effective antimicrobial agent, we isolated a bacteriophage from sewage, named CC2, and sequenced its genome. Comparative genome analysis of phage CC2 with its relatives revealed that phage CC2 has higher sequence homology to A. salmonicida phage 65 than to A. hydrophila phage Aeh1. Here, we announce the complete genome sequence of CC2 and report major findings from the genomic analysis.
