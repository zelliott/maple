The HIV-1 Tat protein is a potent trans-activator essential for virus replication. We reported previously that HIV-1 Tat peptides containing residues 37-48 (mainly region II), a possible activating region, and residues 49-57 (region III), a nuclear targeting and putative nucleic acid binding region, possess minimal but distinct trans-activator activity. The presence of residues 58-72 (region IV) greatly enhances trans-activation. We postulate that Tat mutant peptides with an inactive region II and a functional region III can behave as dominant negative mutants. We synthesized minimal domain peptides containing single amino substitutions for amino acid residues within region II that are conserved among different HIV isolates. We identify four amino acid residues whose substitution within Tat minimal domain peptides leads to defects in transactivation. Some of these mutants are trans-dominant in several peptide backbones, since they strongly inhibit trans-activation by wild-type Tat protein added to cells or expressed from microinjected plasmid. Significantly, trans-activation of integrated HIV-LTRCAT is blocked by some trans-dominant mutant peptides. These results suggest an attractive approach for the development of an AIDS therapy.
