To determine the distribution and frequency of cystic fibrosis (CF) mutations in the Israeli population, we have screened 96 patients for 11 relatively common mutations. Five mutations--delta F508, G542X, W1282X, N1303K, and 3849 + 10kb C-->T--were found to account for 97% of the CF alleles in the Ashkenazi Jews. In contrast, of the 11 mutations tested, only delta F508 was detected in Jewish patients of Sephardic or Oriental origin, accounting for 43% of the CF alleles. Four mutations--delta F508, G542X, W1282X, and N1303K--accounted for 55% of the CF alleles in Arab patients. In a pilot screening study, a random sample of 424 Ashkenazi individuals was analyzed for three mutations--delta F508, W1282X, and G542X. Thirteen individuals were detected as heterozygotes (six for delta F508 and seven for W1282X), predicting a heterozygote frequency of 1:29. This is similar to the frequency of carriers in the Caucasian population of northern European ancestry. On the basis of these data, the Ashkenazi population is considered to be a candidate for CF heterozygote screening.
