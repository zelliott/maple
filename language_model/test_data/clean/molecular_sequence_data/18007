RNA consisting 43 nucleotides bearing cap structure was synthesized (Figure). In the first place, 9 mer of a leader sequence with the cap structure (F-1) was synthesized by the phosphotriester method and followed by the capping reaction. Next, 32 mer of a cistron was divided into two fragments and each was synthesized by the phosphoramidite method. The 3'-end nucleotide of the RNA, a modified guanosine 5'-phosphate, was introduced to F-3 by use of P1-2',3'-O-methoxymethylene guanosine-5'-yl P2-adenosine-5'-yl diphosphate (A5' ppGmM) with T4 RNA ligase. The chemically synthesized RNA fragments were ligated with T4 RNA ligase to afford the desired RNA.
