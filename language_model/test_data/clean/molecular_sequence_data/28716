The nucleocapsid (N) protein genes from 24 Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates representing various pathotypes with different geographical and chronological origins were cloned and sequenced. The N-terminal region of the N protein to residue 401 was highly conserved among isolates with several conservative substitutions occurring that correlated with phylogenetic relationships. Variability of the N protein was detected in the C-terminal portion similar to what has been reported for other members of the Paramyxovirinae. Amino acids previously identified as invariant or highly conserved in N proteins of other paramyxoviruses were also present in the NDV protein. Phylogenetic analysis of N gene coding sequences among NDV isolates again demonstrated the existence of two major groups. One clade contained viruses that included vaccine and virulent strains isolated in the USA prior to 1970 while a second clade included vaccine and virulent viruses isolated worldwide. Comparison of N protein amino acid sequences among members of the Paramyxoviridae resulted in NDV and avian paramyxovirus 6 separating as a cluster distinct from the Rubulavirus genus. This provides further support for avian paramyxoviruses being considered for their own genus among the Paramyxovirinae.
