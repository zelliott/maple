To understand the relationship between zinc and prostaglandin (PG) metabolisms in inducing colon cancer incidence in human and animals.

Human colonic tumor and normal cells were obtained from Departments of Surgery and Pathology at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA and US VA Medical Center, North Hills, CA. Rat colonic tumor and normal cells were isolated from the rats that received two injections of 50 mg/kg of Azoxymethan (AOM) in 2 weeks and then kept 30 weeks in the animal facility. Then, the effects of zinc on the PGE2 synthesis and PGE2 on zinc metabolism in tumor and normal cells were determined.

PGE2 concentrations in both human and AOM-induced rat colonic tumor cells increased compared to those in adjacent normal colonocytes, whereas PGF2 alpha concentrations did not change. Gene expression of inducible form of prostaglandin synthase (PGS-2) is stimulated in rat colonocytes by epidermal growth factor and by tetradecanoyl 13-phorbol acetate (a tumor promoter and mitogen) only in the presence of zinc. PGE2 binding activity of rat enterocytes was maximum at 15 microM of zinc (normal plasma zinc concentration), but PGE2 synthesis activity increased for the first 15 minutes when extracellular zinc concentrations were either higher or lower than the normal extracellular zinc concentration. However, variations in extracellular zinc concentrations did not change the rate of PGF2 alpha synthesis in the normal rat enterocytes. PGE2 significantly increased zinc uptake rates of colonic tumor cells but PGF2 alpha showed only moderate effect.

These results suggest that zinc is required for PGS-2 gene expression, that maintaining an optimal zinc nutriture is important for normal PG synthesis of intestinal cells, and that only PGE2 synthesis mechanisms rather than PGS-2 gene expression are altered in colonic tumor cells resulting in the abnormal zinc nutriture of these cells.
