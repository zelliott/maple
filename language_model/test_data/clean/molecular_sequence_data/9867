The molecular components of mammalian circadian clocks are elusive. We have isolated a human gene termed RIGUI that encodes a bHLH/PAS protein 44% homologous to Drosophila period. The highly conserved mouse homolog (m-rigui) is expressed in a circadian pattern in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master regulator of circadian clocks in mammals. Circadian expression in the SCN continues in constant darkness, and a shift in the light/dark cycle evokes a proportional shift of m-rigui expression in the SCN. m-rigui transcripts also appear in a periodic pattern in Purkinje neurons, pars tuberalis, and retina, but with a timing of oscillation different from that seen in the SCN. Sequence homology and circadian patterns of expression suggest that RIGUI is a mammalian ortholog of the Drosophila period gene, raising the possibility that a regulator of circadian clocks is conserved.
