The complete amino acid sequence of the BSC-1 cell growth inhibitor, including its precursor polypeptide, is reported. The sequence was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the mature bioactive BSC-1 cell growth inhibitor is identical with the N-terminal sequences of the factors that have been called type beta 2 transforming growth factor and cartilage-inducing factor B, suggesting that these are identical. The complete amino acid sequence of the mature BSC-1 cell growth inhibitor differs from that of human type beta transforming growth factor in 32 of the 112 amino acids. Polyergin is proposed as the name for the BSC-1 cell growth inhibitor.
