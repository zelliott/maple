To provide tools for breeders to control the steroidal glycoalkaloid (SGA) pathway in potato, we have investigated the steroidal alkaloid glycosyltransferase (Sgt) gene family. The committed step in the SGA pathway is the glycosylation of solanidine by either UDP-glucose or UDP-galactose leading to alpha-chaconine or alpha-solanine, respectively. The Sgt2 gene was identified by deduced protein sequence homology to the previously identified Sgt1 gene. SGT1 has glucosyltransferase activity in vitro, but in vivo serves as the UDP-galactose:solanidine galactosyltransferase. Two alleles of the Sgt2 gene were isolated and its function was established with antisense transgenic lines and in vitro assays of recombinant protein. In tubers of transgenic potato (Solanum tuberosum) cvs. Lenape and Desir√©e expressing an antisense Sgt2 gene construct, accumulation of alpha-solanine was increased and alpha-chaconine was reduced. Studies with recombinant SGT2 protein purified from yeast show that SGT2 glycosylation activity is highly specific for UDP-glucose as a sugar donor. This data establishes the function of the gene product (SGT2), as the primary UDP-glucose:solanidine glucosyltransferase in vivo.
