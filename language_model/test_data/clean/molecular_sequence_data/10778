Two mutations in the cystatin B gene, a 3' splice mutation and a stop codon mutation, were previously found in patients with progressive myoclonus epilepsy of Unverricht-Lundborg type [Pennacchio et al. (1996): Science 271:1731-1734]. We present here a new mutation 2404deltaTC: a 2-bp deletion within the third exon of the cystatin B gene in an Unverricht-Lundborg patient. This mutation results in a frameshift and consequently premature termination of protein synthesis. Complete sequencing of the coding region and splice junctions of the cystatin B gene showed that neither of the two previously known mutations was present in this patient. The level of cystatin B mRNA in an immortalized cell line was found to be decreased, as had been reported for other Unverricht-Lundborg patients. The new mutation further supports the argument that defects in the cystatin B gene cause the Unverricht-Lundborg form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy. We describe a simple PCR method which can detect the 2404deltaTC deletion. This assay, together with previously described PCR assays for the other two known mutations, should prove useful in confirming clinically difficult diagnoses of Unverricht-Lundborg disease.
