Reverse transcriptase sequencing of 16S rRNA of Streptococcus saccharolyticus was performed in order to determine the phylogenetic position of this organism. On the basis of the sequence data Streptococcus saccharolyticus formed a distinct group with Enterococcus faecalis (type species of the genus Enterococcus) and other enterococcal species. Streptococcus saccharolyticus was found to be only distantly related to members of the genus Streptococcus sensu stricto. It is therefore proposed that Streptococcus saccharolyticus be reclassified in the genus Enterococcus, as Enterococcus saccharolyticus comb. nov.
