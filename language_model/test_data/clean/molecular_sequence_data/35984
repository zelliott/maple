K12G0S32 is a 57-kDa recombinant single-chain chimeric plasminogen activator consisting of scFv-K12Go, a single-chain variable-region antigen-binding fragment (Fv) of the monoclonal antibody MA-15C5, which is specific for fragment D-dimer of human cross-linked fibrin, and a low-molecular-mass (33 kDa) urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA-33k) containing amino acids Ala132-Leu411 (Holvoet, P., Laroche, Y., Lijnen, H. R., Van Cauwenberghe, R., Demarsin, E., Brouwers, E., Matthyssens, G. & Collen D. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 19717-19724). In addition, the Arg156-Phe157 thrombin-cleavage site in the u-PA moiety of K12G0S32 is removed by substitution of Phe157 with Asp. In the present study, the fibrinolytic potency of K12G0S32, determined in a system composed of a 125I-fibrin-labeled human plasma clot submerged in citrated plasma, was found to be only twofold higher than that of intact single-chain u-Pa (rscu-PA), but 17-fold higher than that of rscu-PA(M), a variant of rscu-PA in which the thrombin-cleavage site was removed by substitution of Phe157 with Asp. The fibrinolytic potency of K12G0S32T, with an intact thrombin-cleavage site, was 6-15-fold higher than that of rscu-PA. Conversion of 1 microM single-chain K12G0S32 or rscu-PA(M) into their two-chain derivatives with plasmin occurred at a rate of 1.0 +/- 0.15 nmol.min-1.nmol plasmin-1 and 0.85 +/- 0.074 nmol.min-1.nmol plasmin-1, compared to 14 +/- 2.3 nmol.min-1.nmol plasmin-1 and 18 +/- 2.6 nM.min-1.nmol plasmin-1 for K12G0S32T and rscu-PA, respectively. Purified fragment D-dimer of human cross-linked fibrin inhibited the fibrinolytic potency of single-chain K12G0S32T, but not of two-chain K12G0S32T, in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the fibrinolytic potencies of two-chain K12G0S32 and K12G0S32T were not significantly higher than those of recombinant two-chain u-PA (rtcu-PA) or of rtcu-PA(M). These findings suggest that the 59-fold increase in fibrinolytic potency of K12G0S32T, relative to that of rscu-PA(M), is due both to targeting of the activator to the clot via the single-chain Fv fragment (sixfold increase) and to a more efficient conversion of single-chain K12G0S32T to its two-chain derivative (eightfold increase). Thus, targeting to clots by means of fibrin-specific antibodies results in a significant increase of the fibrinolytic potency of single-chain but not of two-chain u-PA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
