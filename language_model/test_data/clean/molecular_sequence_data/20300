The olfactory organ of the Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus maintains lifelong proliferation and turnover of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Towards examining the molecular basis of this adult neurogenesis, we search for expression of homologs of proneural, neurogenic, and pre-pattern genes in this olfactory organ. We report here a homolog of the proneural Achaete-Scute family, called splash (spiny lobster achaete-scute homolog), and a homolog of the pre-pattern and neurogenic hairy-enhancer of split family, called splhairy (spiny lobster hairy). Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) indicates a molt stage dependence of the levels of expression of splash and splhairy mRNA in the olfactory organ, with higher expression in premolt than in postmolt or intermolt animals, which is positively correlated with rates of neurogenesis. splash and splhairy mRNA are expressed not only in the olfactory organ but also in other tissues, albeit at lower levels, irrespective of molt stage. We conclude that the expression of achaete-scute and hairy-enhancer of split in the proliferation zone of the olfactory organ of spiny lobsters and their enhanced expression in premolt animals suggest that they play a role in the proliferation of ORNs and that their expression in regions of the olfactory organ populated by mature ORNs and in other tissues suggests that they have additional functions.
