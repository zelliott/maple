By RT-PCR, we isolated a partial cDNA clone for the chick Semaphorin7A (Sema7A) gene. We further analyzed its expression patterns and compared them with those of the Sema3D gene, in chick embryonic development. Sema3D and Sema7A appeared to be expressed in distinct cell populations. In mesoderm-derived structures, Sema7A expression was detected in the newly formed somites, whereas Sema3D expression was found in the notochord. In ectoderm-derived tissues, Sema3D is expressed broadly in the surface ectoderm, lens and nasal placodes. Sema3D is also expressed in the developing nervous system including diencephalon, dorsal neural tube, optical and otic vesicles. In the limb bud, Sema3D expression was found throughout the ectoderm excluding the apical ectoderm ridge (AER), where Sema7A is concentrated. Although both genes appeared to be expressed in the migrating neural crest cells, Sema3D expression is limited to neural crest cells migrating out of the midbrain/hindbrain regions, while Sema7A expression is widespread in both cranial and trunk neural crest cells.
