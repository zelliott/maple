It has been shown for the first time by transmission electron microscopy that the hydrated fullerene C60 inhibited the fibrillization of amyloid-beta25-35 peptide. The fullerene affected the amyloid-beta25-35 assembly, manifesting its anti-amyloidogenic capacity. Our in vivo investigations demonstrated also that a single intracerebroventricular injection of the C60 hydrated fullerene at a dose of 7.2 nmol/ventricle significantly improved the performance of the cognitive task in control rats. The intracerebroventricular injection of the C60 hydrated fullerene (3.6 nmol/ventricle) prevented the impairment of performance of the cognitive task induced by amyloid-beta25-35 (22.5 nmol/ventricle). The results obtained may be useful in the development of therapy of Alzheimer's disease.
