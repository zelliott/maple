The natriuretic peptide (NP) system may play a crucial role in development of essential hypertension (EH). C-type NP dilates arteries and lowers blood pressure and inhibits proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells via the type B NP receptor (NPR-B). However, the association of the human NPR-B gene with EH has not been studied, because little is known about the genomic organization of this gene. We designed oligonucleotide primers based on the cDNA sequence of the human NPR-B gene, and long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed. The amplified fragments were sequenced directly, and the exon/intron organization of the human NPR-B gene was determined. The gene, which spans approximately 16.5 kbp, is composed of 22 exons, and the intron-exon junctions follow the GT-AG rule. Seven hundred fifty base pairs of the 5'-flanking region were sequenced using a thermal asymmetric interlaced-PCR (TAIL-PCR) method. This region contains 10 potential Sp1 binding sites and lacks a TATA box. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) revealed the transcriptional start site at -14 bp. A CA/GT microsatellite repeat was identified with a hybridization-based method and was converted to a sequence-tagged site (STS). The GT microsatellite repeat was localized to intron 2 approximately 150 bp downstream of the exon-intron junction. Two alleles, (GT)10 and (GT)11, were detected in both EH patients and age-matched normotensive (NT) controls. Multiple logistic linear regression analysis indicated that the NPR-B genotype is associated significantly with EH (odds ratio 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 2.35). The (GT)11 frequency was 0.316 (65/206) for the EH group and 0.218 (44/202) for the NT group and differed significantly between the EH and NT groups (chi2=4.97, P=0.026). The structural organization of the human NPR-B gene was determined, and a novel GT repeat polymorphism, which associated with EH, was identified. These results suggest that one cause of EH is a mutation in this gene or a closely related gene or region.
