Mastoparan B, a tetradecapeptide toxin (LKLKSIVSWAKKVL) isolated from the hornet (Vespa basalis) venom, was synthesized chemically. The physical and biological properties of both the native and synthetic peptides were studied and proved to be identical. Mastoparan B was found to have a potent antibacterial activity to both Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria.
