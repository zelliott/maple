Rhizobium meliloti C4-dicarboxylic acid transport protein D (DCTD) activates transcription by a form of RNA polymerase holoenzyme that has sigma 54 as its sigma factor (referred to as E sigma 54). DCTD catalyzes the ATP-dependent isomerization of closed complexes between E sigma 54 and the dctA promoter to transcriptionally productive open complexes. Transcriptional activation probably involves specific protein-protein interactions between DCTD and E sigma 54. Interactions between sigma 54-dependent activators and E sigma 54 are transient, and there has been no report of a biochemical assay for contact between E sigma 54 and any activator to date. Heterobifunctional crosslinking reagents were used to examine protein-protein interactions between the various subunits of E sigma 54 and DCTD. DCTD was crosslinked to Salmonella typhimurium sigma 54 with the crosslinking reagents succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidyl-4-azidobenzoate. Cys-307 of sigma 54 was identified by site-directed mutagenesis as the residue that was crosslinked to DCTD. DCTD was also crosslinked to the beta subunit of Escherichia coli core RNA polymerase with succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, but not with N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidyl-4-azidobenzoate. These data suggest that interactions of DCTD with sigma 54 and the beta subunit may be important for transcriptional activation and offer evidence for interactions between a sigma 54-dependent activator and sigma 54, as well as the beta subunit of RNA polymerase.
