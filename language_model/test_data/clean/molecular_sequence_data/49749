Thrombomodulin (TM) functions as a cofactor to enhance the rate of protein C activation by thrombin approximately 1000-fold. The molecular mechanism by which TM improves the catalytic efficiency of thrombin toward protein C is not known. Molecular modeling of the protein C activation based on the crystal structure of thrombin in complex with the epidermal growth factor-like domains 4, 5, and 6 of TM (TM456) predicts that the binding of TM56 to exosite 1 of thrombin positions TM4 so that a negatively charged region on this domain juxtaposes a positively charged region of protein C. It has been hypothesized that electrostatic interactions between these oppositely charged residues of TM4 and protein C facilitate a proper docking of the substrate into the catalytic pocket of thrombin. To test this hypothesis, we have constructed several mutants of TM456 and protein C in which charges of the putative interacting residues on both TM4 (Asp/Glu) and protein C (Lys/Arg) have been reversed. Results of TM-dependent protein C activation studies by such a compensatory mutagenesis approach support the molecular model that TM4 interacts with the basic exosite of protein C.
