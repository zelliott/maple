Mast cells play pivotal roles in IgE-mediated airway inflammation and other mast cell-mediated inflammation by activation and chemoattraction of inflammatory cells.

We investigated the intracellular signaling mechanisms regulating chemokine release from human mast cell line-1 (HMC-1) cells activated by stem cell factor (SCF) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha.

Chemokine gene expressions were assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, while the releases of chemokines were determined by flow cytometry or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To elucidate the intracellular signal transduction regulating the chemokine expression, phosphorylated-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphorylated-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear translocated nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-DNA binding were quantitatively assessed by ELISA.

Either SCF or TNF-alpha could induce release from HMC-1 cells of interleukin (IL)-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), and I-309, while SCF and TNF-alpha induced release of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1beta and interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), respectively. Using various selective inhibitors for signaling molecules, we found that the inductions of IL-8, MCP-1, and I-309 were mediated by either SCF-activated ERK or TNF-alpha-activated p38 MAPK, while the induction of IP-10 by TNF-alpha was mediated by both activated p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB. The induction of RANTES by SCF or TNF-alpha was mediated by ERK and NF-kappaB, respectively, and SCF induced MIP-1beta release was mediated by ERK.

The above results therefore elucidated the different intracellular signaling pathways regulating the release of different chemokines from SCF and TNF-alpha-activated mast cells, thereby shedding light for the immunopathological mechanisms of mast cell-mediated diseases.
