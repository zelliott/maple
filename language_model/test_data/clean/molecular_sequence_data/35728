Human neutrophil collagenase (HNC) has been purified from extracts of fresh and outdated buffy coats and from the exudates of phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated neutrophils. The HNC present in the starting material from such preparations can be either latent or active, or have an approximate molecular weight of 75 or 58 kDa, depending upon whether the extraction buffer contains protease inhibitors and/or antioxidants. The purification of these different forms of HNC is described and is made possible by taking appropriate precautions to stabilize the HNC. For example, a purification protocol is described that allows the purification to homogeneity of the active and PCMB-active latent 58 kDa forms of HNC in high yield with specific collagenase activities that greatly exceed that of trypsin-activated human fibroblast collagenase (HFC). The pattern of activation of the latent 58 and 75 kDa species by trypsin, organomercurials and oxidants has been investigated. HNC is shown to preferentially hydrolyze type I over types II and III collagens in solution. The specificity of HNC toward the hydrolysis of 60 octapeptides has been examined and compared with HFC. HNC is shown to be a glycoprotein that contains complex N-linked oligosaccharides.
