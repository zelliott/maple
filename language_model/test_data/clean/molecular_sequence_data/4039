Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominantly inherited colorectal cancer predisposition syndrome caused by germ line mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC). For prophylactic colectomy, timely identification of patients at risk is urgent. Here, matrix assisted laser desorption ionization - time of flight - mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) genotyping is offered for an efficient molecular diagnosis of APC germline mutations.

The four most frequent APC germ line mutations (three deletions, one point mutation) were genotyped by allele specific elongation and termination of extension primers. The extension products generated were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS.

Following PCR amplification and allele specific primer extension reactions MALDI-TOF-MS allowed the unambiguous identification of informative nucleic acid fragments corresponding to distinct genotypes or mutants even in duplex assays. Results were confirmed by DNA-sequencing.

Due to its high molecular resolution and accuracy, this method is highly suitable as an alternative for clinical APC genotyping.
