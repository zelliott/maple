Incubation of beta-lactoglobulin with immobilized trypsin at 5-10 degrees C results in a time-dependent release of several fragments of the core domain in yields approaching 15%. Digests were fractionated by ion-exchange chromatography with a Mono Q HR 5/5 column and analyzed after disulfide reduction by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecylsulfate. Three fragments with approximate molecular weights of 13.8, 9.6, and 6.7 kD were identified. The fraction from ion-exchange chromatography yielding the 6.7 kD fraction after disulfide reduction was further characterized because it was most homogeneous and gave the highest yield. The C-terminal cleavage site of the 6.7 kD core fragment appeared to be Lys100 or Lys101 as determined by C-terminal amino acid analysis. The exact masses, after reduction with dithiothreitol, are 6195 and 6926 as determined by laser desorption mass spectrometry, corresponding to residues 48-101 and 41-100. Prior to reduction, beta-lactoglobulin C-terminal residues 149-162 are connected to these core domain fragments as shown by C-terminal analysis and mass spectrometry. Structural studies indicate that these 7.9 and 8.6 kD core domain fragments released by immobilized trypsin retain much of their native structure. CD spectra indicate the presence of antiparallel beta-sheet structure similar to the native protein but the alpha-helix is lost. Spectra in the aromatic region indicate the existence of tertiary structure. Moreover, structural transitions in urea are completely reversible as measured by CD spectra, although the extrapolated delta GDH20 and the urea concentration at the transition midpoint are lower than for the native protein. The core domain fragments also display a pH-dependent binding to immobilized trans-retinal as does intact protein. A single endotherm is obtained for both core domain fragments and native protein upon differential scanning calorimetry, but again, the domain is less stable as indicated by a transition peak maxima of 56.9 degrees C as compared with 81.1 degrees C for native protein.
