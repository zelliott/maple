The sfa determinant codes for S fimbrial adhesins which constitute adherence factors of pathogenic Escherichia coli strains. We have recently shown that the sfa determinant is transcribed from three promoters, pA, pB, and pC. In comparison with the promoters pB and pC, promoter pA, which is located in front of the structural gene sfaA, showed very weak activity. Here we have determined the exact positions of the mRNA start points by primer extension studies. We have also shown that mRNAs of 500, 700 and 1400 bases can be detected using oligonucleotide probes specific for the genes sfaB, sfaC and sfaA. SfaB and SfaC are positive regulators influencing fimbriation and the production of the S-specific adhesin which is encoded by the gene sfaS located in the distal half of the determinant. In addition, it is demonstrated that SfaB and SfaC interfere with the regulatory effect of the histone-like protein H-NS, encoded by a locus termed drdX or osmZ. In a drdX+ strain the regulators are necessary for transcription of the sfa determinant. In contrast, sfa expression is activator-independent in a drdX- strain. In this latter genetic background, a substantial fraction of the sfa transcripts is initiated from promoter pA. On the basis of these data we discuss a model for the regulation of this adhesin-specific determinant.
