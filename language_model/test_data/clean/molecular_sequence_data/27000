A phenol-degrading actinomycete, strain NP8-5T, was isolated from a polluted stream in Gumi, Korea. The strain was aerobic, Gram-positive-staining, non-motile and non-spore-forming, displayed a rod-coccus growth cycle, exhibited white opaque colonies on complex media and showed chemotaxonomic markers that were consistent with its classification in the genus Gordonia. Phylogenetic analysis, based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, also showed that strain NP8-5T belonged to the genus Gordonia, sharing the highest levels of sequence similarity with Gordonia araii IFM 10211T, G. hydrophobica DSM 44015T and G. sinesedis NCIMB 13802T (96.4, 96.0 and 95.9%, respectively) and forming a separate lineage within this genus. Combined phylogenetic and phenotypic data supported the conclusion that strain NP8-5T represents a novel species of the genus Gordonia, for which the name Gordonia kroppenstedtii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NP8-5T (=KCTC 19360T=DSM 45133T).
