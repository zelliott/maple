The beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) isolate NM was isolated from sugarbeet infected with rhizomania in Inner Mongolia of China. The cDNA of BNYVV coat protein (CP) gene was amplified from the extracted RNA of BNYVV isolate NM by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into pGEM-7zf(+). Its complete nucleotide sequence was determined by means of Sanger's dideoxy-mediated chain-termination method. The result shows that CP gene of BNYVV isolate has 567 nucleotides. It shares 98.8% and 96.7% identity with the CP gene of isolate F13 (report in reference [1]) in terms of amino acid and nucleotide sequence, respectively.
