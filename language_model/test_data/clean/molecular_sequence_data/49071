BAG-1 is multifunctional protein which interacts with a wide range of cellular targets to regulate growth control pathways important for normal and malignant cells, including apoptosis, signaling, proliferation, transcription and cell motility. Of particular relevance to tumour cells, BAG-1 interacts with the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein, various nuclear hormone receptors and the 70 kDa heat shock proteins, Hsc70 and Hsp70. Interaction with chaperones may account for many of the pleiotropic effects associated with BAG-1 overexpression. Recent studies have shown that BAG-1 expression is frequently altered in malignant cells, and BAG-1 expression may have clinical value as a prognostic/predictive marker. This review summarises current understanding of molecular mechanisms of BAG-1 expression and function.
