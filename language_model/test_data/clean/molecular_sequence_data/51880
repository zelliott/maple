With a view to determine a minimal sequence length of homology necessary for RecE-dependent homologous recombination in Bacillus subtilis cells, we developed a system, based on interaction between plasmid replicon and bacterial chromosome. Recombination frequencies were measured between ts plasmid pE194 derivatives carrying chromosomal beta-glucuronidase gene (bglS) fragments of various length, and a bacterial chromosome. The homologous recombination events resulted in bglS gene disruption. Approx. 70 bp of homology were found to be necessary for detectable homologous recombination. Homologous recombination was not detected when homology was equal 25 bp. These data indicate that homology requirement for recombination in B. subtilis differs from that in Escherichia coli.
