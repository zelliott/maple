An erythrocyte isoenzyme of acylphosphatase was purified from bovine red cells. The protein was characterized as regards the kinetic parameters and amino acid sequence. A simple and rapid sequencing strategy, based on a few experiments, was used for reconstructing the primary structure of the enzyme, since the purification procedure gave a very low yield. The length of the polypeptide chain is 100 residues. Comparison with the analogous human isoenzyme indicates that the primary structure is about 90% conserved. The presence of two additional residues at the acetylated N-terminus confirms the hypervariability for this region found in other acylphosphatases.
