Cytochrome b(5) (cyt-b(5)) is a ubiquitous hemoprotein also associated with microsomal cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase (CYP17A1). In the steroidogenic pathway CYP17A1 catalyses the metabolism of pregnenolone, yielding both glucocorticoid and androgen precursors. While not affecting the 17α-hydroxylation of pregnenolone, cyt-b(5) augments the 17,20 lyase reaction of 17-hydroxypregnenolone, catalyzing the formation of DHEA, through direct protein-protein interactions. In this study, multimeric complex formation of cyt-b(5) and the possible regulatory role of these complexes were investigated. Cyt-b(5) was isolated from ovine liver and used to raise anti-sheep cyt-b(5) immunoglobulins. Immunochemical studies revealed that, in vivo, cyt-b(5) is primarily found in the tetrameric form. Subsequent fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies in COS-1 cells confirmed the formation of homomeric complexes by cyt-b(5) in live cells. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the C-terminal linker domain of cyt-b(5) is vital for complex formation. The 17,20-lyase activity of CYP17 was augmented by truncated cyt-b(5), which is unable to form complexes when co-expressed in COS-1 cells, thereby implicating the monomeric form of cyt-b(5) as the active species. This study has shown for the first time that cyt-b(5) forms homomeric complexes in vivo, implicating complex formation as a possible regulatory mechanism in steroidogenesis.
