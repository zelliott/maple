We present the sequence of a wheat mitochondrial (mt) lysine tRNA gene (trnK-UUU). This gene more closely resembles its E. coli counterpart than it does the corresponding gene in fungal or mammalian mtDNA. Hybridization experiments with a trnK-specific probe suggest that at least two copies of this tRNALys gene are present in the wheat mitochondrial genome.
