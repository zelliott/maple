A cDNA containing the complete coding sequence of rabbit brown adipose tissue uncoupling protein was isolated and sequenced. The coding region is 80.6% identical to rat UCP cDNA and the protein is about 86% identical to the rat and hamster proteins. Despite the presence of 2 AATAAA polyadenylation consensus sequences in rabbit UCP cDNA, only one rabbit UCP mRNA was detected indicating that only the 3'-downstream signal is used in contrast to rat and mouse where both are used.
