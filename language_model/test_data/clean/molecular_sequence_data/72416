A 3.2 kb EcoRI fragment carrying genes for Na(+)-F1F0 ATPase was cloned from chromosomal DNA of Acetobacterium woodii. DNA sequence analysis revealed the presence of an open reading frame which was identified by data base searches and comparison with the experimentally derived N-terminal amino acid sequence to code for subunit c of Na(+)-F1F0 ATPase. A comparison of the primary sequences of the two well established Na(+)-translocating F1F0 ATPases from Acetobacterium woodii and Propionigenium modestum with H(+)-translocating enzymes indicates the length of the C-terminus as well as specific residues located in the cytoplasmic membrane to be important for Na+ transport.
