We isolated a cDNA clone which shows a similarity with human butyrophilin from a human colon mucosa cDNA library. The cDNA is 1964 bases long, with one open reading frame encoding a protein of 433 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence shows an overall homology of 36.5% with the human butyrophilin protein. This gene is mainly expressed in small intestine, colon, testis, and leukocytes. The chromosomal location of the gene was determined on the chromosome 5q35 region by polymerase chain reaction-based analysis with both a human/rodent monochromosomal hybrid cell panel and a radiation hybrid mapping panel.
