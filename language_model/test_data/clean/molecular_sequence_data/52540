One-carbon metabolism is essential to provide activated one-carbon units in the biosynthesis of methionine, purines, and thymidylate. The major forms of folates in vivo are polyglutamylated derivatives. In organisms that synthesize folate coenzymes de novo, the addition of the glutamyl side chains is achieved by the action of two enzymes, dihydrofolate synthetase and folylpolyglutamate synthetase. We report here the characterization and molecular analysis of the two glutamate-adding enzymes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that dihydrofolate synthetase catalyzing the binding of the first glutamyl side chain to dihydropteroate yielding dihydrofolate is encoded by the YMR113w gene that we propose to rename FOL3. Mutant cells bearing a fol3 mutation require folinic acid for growth and have no dihydrofolate synthetase activity. We show also that folylpolyglutamate synthetase, which catalyzes the extension of the glutamate chains of the folate coenzymes, is encoded by the MET7 gene. Folylpolyglutamate synthetase activity is required for methionine synthesis and for maintenance of mitochondrial DNA. We have tested whether two folylpolyglutamate synthetases could be encoded by the MET7 gene, by the use of alternative initiation codons. Our results show that the loss of mitochondrial functions in met7 mutant cells is not because of the absence of a mitochondrial folylpolyglutamate synthetase.
