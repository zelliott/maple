The carbohydrate chains linked to human kappa-casein from mature milk were released by alkaline borohydride treatment as reduced oligosaccharides. The neutral oligosaccharides of lower molecular weight were fractionated and purified by gel filtration and preparative thin layer chromatographies. Seven neutral oligosaccharides (a di- (0.5%), two tetra- (30.5%), two penta- (5.4%) and two hexasaccharide alditols (10.9%] were obtained in homogeneity, and followed by methylation analysis with gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and by anomer analysis with 13C nuclear magnetic resonance. Their chemical structures were identified to be Gal beta 1----3GalNAc-ol (I), Gal beta 1----3[Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6]GalNAc-ol (II), Gal beta 1----3[Fuc alpha 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6]GalNAc-ol (III), GlcNAc beta 1----3/6Gal beta 1----3[Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6]GalNAc-ol (IV), GlcNAc beta 1----3/6Gal beta 1----3[Fuc alpha 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6]GalNAc-ol (V), Fuc alpha 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----3/6Gal beta 1----3[Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6]GalNAc-ol (VI) and Fuc alpha 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----3/6Gal beta 1----3[Fuc alpha 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6]GalNAc-ol (VII). Five oligosaccharide alditols (III-VII) were the novel carbohydrate chains of kappa-casein from mammalian milk.
