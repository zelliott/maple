Soybean nodule cDNA clones encoding glycinamide ribonucleotide (GAR) synthetase (GMpurD) and GAR transformylase (GMpurN) were isolated by complementation of corresponding Escherichia coli mutants. GAR synthetase and GAR transformylase catalyse the second and the third steps in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, respectively. One class of GAR synthetase and three classes of GAR transformylase cDNA clones were identified. Northern blot analysis clearly shows that these purine biosynthetic genes are highly expressed in young and mature nodules but weakly expressed in roots and leaves. Expression levels of GMpurD and GMpurN mRNAs were not enhanced when ammonia was provided to non-nodulated roots.
