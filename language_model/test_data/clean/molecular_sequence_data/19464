An artificial gene encoding oxyntomodulin was obtained using chemical and enzymatic methods and cloned into Escherichia coli. A recombinant plasmid was constructed containing a hybrid oxyntomodulin gene and Ssp dnaB intein from Synechocystis sp. The expression of the resulting hybrid gene in E. coli, its properties, and the conditions of its autocatalytic cleavage to oxyntomodulin were studied.
