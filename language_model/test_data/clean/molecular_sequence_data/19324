A strictly aerobic, Gram-negative, gliding, dull-orange-pigmented, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain Shu-F-UV2-2(T), was isolated from sediment (Carp Island, Republic of Palau) and was the focus of a polyphasic taxonomic study. Phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the novel isolate was affiliated to the family 'Flammeovirgaceae' of the phylum Bacteroidetes and that it showed highest sequence similarity (85.5 %) to Flammeovirga yaeyamensis NBRC 100898(T). The novel isolate could be differentiated phenotypically and physiologically from recognized members of the family 'Flammeovirgaceae'. The G+C content of the DNA was 43.0 mol%, MK-7 was the major menaquinone and iso-C(15 : 0), C(16 : 1)omega7c and C(16 : 1)omega5c were the major fatty acids. On the basis of this polyphasic evidence, it was concluded that strain Shu-F-UV2-2(T) represents a novel species in a new genus of the family 'Flammeovirgaceae', for which the name Perexilibacter aurantiacus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is Shu-F-UV2-2(T) (=MBIC06993(T)=IAM 15413(T)=KCTC 12867(T)).
