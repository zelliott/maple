The gene encoding the BmalphaTX14 (alpha-neurotoxin TX14) protein, derived from the cDNA library of the Chinese scorpion Buthus martensii Karsch, was expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant protein was purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography and gel filtration chromatography. Using patch-clamp technique, electrophysiological activity of rBmalphaTX14 was identified. In the neurons isolated from mice trigeminal root ganglion, the Na+ current amplitude was reduced by 80% under whole cell patch-clamp recording. There were no apparent modifications to the gating mechanism in the presence of rBmalphaTX14. Although BmalphaTX14 shared a high amino acid sequence similarity with other typical alpha-toxins, it has different effects on neurons. Further electrophysiological analysis suggested that rBmalphaTX14 selectively blocked Na+ channels and is a member of a new group of scorpion toxins.
