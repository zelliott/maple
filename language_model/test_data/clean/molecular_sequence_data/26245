The enteropathogenic Escherichia coli adherence factor (EAF) probe detects isolates of enteropathogenic E. coli that exhibit localized adherence to HEp-2 cells. A 21-base oligonucleotide probe was constructed on the basis of a sequence from within the 1-kb EAF probe and was shown to have greater sensitivity and specificity than the EAF fragment probe in detecting localized adherent E. coli.
