Lactobacillus curvatus L442, isolated from Greek traditional fermented sausage prepared without the addition of starters, produces a bacteriocin, curvaticin L442, which is active against the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. The bacteriocin was purified by 50% ammonium sulphate precipitation, cation exchange, reverse phase and gel filtration chromatography. Partial N-terminal sequence analysis using Edman degradation revealed 30 amino acid residues, revealing high homology with the amino acid sequence of sakacin P. Curvaticin L442 is active at pH values between 4.0 and 9.0 and it retains activity even after incubation for 5 min at 121 degrees C with 1 atm of overpressure. Proteolytic enzymes and alpha-amylase inactivated this curvaticin, while the effect of lipase was not severe.
