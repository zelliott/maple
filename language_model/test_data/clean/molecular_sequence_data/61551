A novel cDNA has been isolated from pig parotid glands by 3' and 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends and designated parotid secretory protein (PSP). The open reading frame of this cDNA covers 714 bases, encoding 238 amino acids, which show 56% identity with human PSP at the level of the primary protein structure. The PSP genomic sequence comprises eight exons and seven introns, is approximately 22 kb in size, determined by sequencing, and maps to pig chromosome 17q21-q23. RT-PCR, dot blot, and Northern blot analyses demonstrated that PSP is strongly expressed in parotid glands, but is not present in heart, liver, lung, kidney, muscle, or stomach. A search for functionally significant protein motifs revealed consensus sequences for casein kinase II phosphorylation and N-myristoylation. We observed a unique amino acid sequence pattern consisting of the residues Leu-X(6)-Leu-X(6)-Leu-X(7)-Leu-X(6)-Leu-X(6)-Leu near the amino-terminal portion of the protein, which is similar to the leucine zipper.
