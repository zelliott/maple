Recently we identified a novel 250 kDa protein in adipocytes that is a substrate for the insulin-activated protein kinase Akt. We refer to this protein as AS250 for Akt substrate of 250 kDa. AS250 has a predicted GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain at its carboxy terminus. This domain shows some homology to the GAP domains for Rheb at the carboxy terminus of the protein tuberin and for Rap1 in the protein Rap1 GAP. The present study further characterizes AS250. The cDNA sequence for human AS250 is reported, and the sites that undergo phosphorylation upon insulin treatment of adipocytes have been identified by tandem mass spectrometry. We have found that in adipocytes AS250 exists as a complex with a novel protein of 1484 amino acids known as KIAA1219. The complex of AS250 with KIAA1219 is notably similar to the important regulatory complex of the protein tuberin with hamartin (the tuberous sclerosis complex), in the size of its subunits, the location of the GAP domain, and its phosphorylation by Akt. In an effort to detect the cellular role of the AS250/KIAA1219 complex, we generated 3T3-L1 adipocytes that largely lack AS250 by shRNA knockdown and examined several insulin-dependent effects. The knockdown of AS250 had no effect on insulin activation of the kinases, Akt, 70 kDa S6 kinase, or ERK1/2, or on insulin-stimulated actin bundling, and it had only a slight effect on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation.
