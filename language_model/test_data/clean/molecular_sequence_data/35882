Microinjection experiments suggested previously that protein binding to the DNA nucleotide sequence GTCACATG, identical to the CDEI element of the yeast centromere, plays an important role in the early development of the mouse. We established from a series of overlapping mouse cDNA clones the sequence of a candidate CDEI-binding protein. Synthesis in Escherichia coli of a fusion protein which binds specifically the CDEI box in vitro confirmed its identification. On the other hand, the translated 511 amino acid sequence shows two regions with high degrees of similarity to the protein precursor (APP) of the beta-protein (amyloid) that accumulates in the brain and blood vessels of Alzheimer patients. A continuous stretch of 195 amino acids includes 133 residues identical to part of the extracellular domain of APP, and 48 of the 70 C-terminal residues of the open reading frame are identical to the APP transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains.
