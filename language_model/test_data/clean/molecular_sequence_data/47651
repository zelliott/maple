The expression of the natural killer (NK) cell antigen, CD56, in hematological malignancies is rare. However, there are several reports that some hematological malignancies, such as T/NK cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma (MM) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), express this molecule. In B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), however, very limited number of cases have been reported to express CD56 molecule. Although one study has recently described that half of microvillous B cell lymphoma (MVL), an uncommon subset of large cell lymphoma, expressed CD56, there have been no reports about most common type of B-NHL, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBL) other than a mention of weak CD56 expression in one of 83 DLBL. We herein presented the first case of diffuse large B cell lymphoma expressing CD56 clearly. The immunophenotype determined by immunostaining and flow cytometric analysis was CD10+, CD19+, CD20+, CD45RO-, CD3- and CD56+. On immunohistochemical study, neither bcl-2 nor TIA-1 was positive for tumor cell. Monoclonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement was detected, and the sequence analysis of the variable region of IgH (VH) suggested that this tumor was derived from antigen selected post germinal center B cell. Conventional combination chemotherapy (CHOP) was administered, and the patient has still been in complete remission for 10 months.
