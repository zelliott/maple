We mapped expressed tagged sequences (ESTs) corresponding to two human dynein heavy chain genes: beta heavy chain of the outer dynein arm and heavy chain isotype 1B (DYH1B), by using somatic cell hybrids and radiation hybrid panels. The EST for the beta heavy chain of the outer dynein arm mapped to chromosome region 7p15, and the EST for DYH1B mapped to 11q13.5. Two loci for nonsyndromic forms of deafness, DFNA5 and DFNA11, have previously been mapped to these two chromosomal regions. Including the gene for the axonemal light chain, hp28, we have mapped three different dynein genes near loci for different forms of nonsyndromic deafness. The hypothesis that mutations in some dynein genes are associated with nonsyndromic deafness should now be tested.
