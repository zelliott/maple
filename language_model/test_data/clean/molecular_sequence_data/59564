An analysis based on population data (approximately 600 individuals) of variability of functional elements (API-like element, termination-associated sequence TAS and direct repeats TAGTACATAAA) and non-functional hypervariable fragment of the left domain of the human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region is presented. It was shown that in the evolutionary respect these elements are relatively conservative structures. The possible role of these structures for the termination of 7S DNA synthesis in D-loop of the mtDNA as well as for the initiation of the replication of the human mitochondrial genome full-length chains is discussed. The lack of race-specificity in respect to functional elements of mtDNA is represented as evidence of absence of differentiation of human races for the organizations of the mitochondrial genome regulatory systems.
