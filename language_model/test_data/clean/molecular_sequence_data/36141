Adhesive interactions between tumor cells and host tissue occur at several stages of metastasis. Such interactions might be inhibited by microbial metabolites resembling the binding regions of matrix molecules. Certain metabolite sequences including Gly, Asp, Arg, and Ser (GAAS) proved to be critical for cell interactions, e.g. with fibronectin. In vitro, the rosette formation of murine pulmonary cells and sarcoma L-1 cells decreased significantly in the presence of Propionibacterium acnes-metabolites rich in GAAS. In vivo, coinjection of Propionibacterium acnes-metabolites and sarcoma L-1 cells significantly inhibited the formation of lung colonies in BALB/c mice. The inhibition of lung colonization by these metabolites appeared to be noncytotoxic and obviously did not result from impairment of cellular tumorigenicity.
