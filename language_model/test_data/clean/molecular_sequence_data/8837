The cyclic AMP (cAMP)-inducible promoter from the rat lactate dehydrogenase A subunit gene (LDH A) is associated with a distal negative regulatory element (LDH-NRE) that represses inherent basal and cAMP-inducible promoter activity. The element is of dyad symmetry, consisting of a palindromic sequence with two half-sites, 5'-TCTTG-3'. It represses the expression of an LDH A/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene in a dose-dependent, orientation- and position-independent fashion, suggesting that it is a true silencer element. Uniquely, it selectively represses cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-dependent transcription but has no effect on promoters lacking a CRE sequence. The repressing action of LDH-NRE could be overcome by cotransfection with LDH A/CAT vector oligonucleotides containing either the LDH-NRE or CRE sequence. This suggests that the reversal of repression was caused by the removal of functional active, limiting transacting factors which associate with LDH-NRE as well as with CRE. Gel mobility shift, footprinting, and Southwestern blotting assays demonstrated the presence of a 69-kDa protein with specific binding activity for LDH-NRE. Additionally, gel supershift assays with anti-CREB and anti-Fos antibodies indicate the presence of CREB and Fos or antigenically closely related proteins with the LDH-NRE/protein complex. We suggest that the LDH-NRE and CRE modules functionally interact to achieve negative modulation of cAMP-responsive LDH A transcriptional activity.
