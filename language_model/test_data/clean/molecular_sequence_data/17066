Horizontal transfer of genes encoding phenol degradation (pheBA) in the environment has been previously described. Complete or partial phe-operon was redetected in plasmids of several indigenous Pseudomonas strains isolated from the river water. The sequences of up- and downstream regions of the acquired phe-DNA in eight different plasmids were analyzed. In all cases, miniature insertional elements or putative transposase genes were found suggesting transposase dependent pheBA integration into plasmids. In three cases, an open reading frame encoding homologue to the transcription regulator protein (CatR) of the pheBA operon was determined.
