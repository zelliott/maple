Nuclear-matrix proteins were prepared from different rat and human cells and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. By computer-assisted analysis of the images, two of the proteins were identified as ubiquitously occurring (common) nuclear-matrix proteins, which appeared in tissue-dependent concentrations. The two proteins that originated from human blood mononuclear cells were analyzed further. Tryptic digests of the blotted proteins were analyzed by partial peptide sequencing and matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The two human common nuclear-matrix proteins were identified as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) H and H' or their variants. Furthermore, mass analysis revealed details on the N terminus of hnRNP H.
