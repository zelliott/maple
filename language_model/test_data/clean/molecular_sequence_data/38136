We examined the diversity of HIV-1 subtypes in 11 adults from Hungary, using the heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) and DNA sequencing. HMA results showed that HIV-1 gp120 sequences from 10 patients were of subtype B, whereas 1 patient, infected in Africa, carried a subtype C strain. DNA sequencing confirmed the HMA results and revealed a high intrasubtype diversity in the C2V3 region of env in different clade B isolates, which suggests multiple introduction of subtype B to Hungary. This study shows that subtype B is the predominant HIV-1 clade in Hungary.
