Rabbit 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LO-1) oxygenates arachidonic acid (AA) into 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, which is then converted to the vasodilatory 15-hydroxy-11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (HEETA) and 11,12,15-trihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (THETA). We studied the age-dependent expression of the 15-LO-1 in rabbit aorta and its effects on the synthesis of THETA, HEETA, and vasoactivity. Aortas of 1-wk-old rabbits express greater amounts of 15-LO-1 mRNA and protein compared with aortas of 4-, 8-, or 16-wk-old rabbits. The synthesis of THETA and HEETA in the rabbit aorta was also reduced with age. THETA synthesis was maximal in 1-wk-old aortas but decreased in aortas of 4- (42%), 8- (4%), and 16-wk-old (1%) rabbits. Similarly, THETA and HEETA synthesis decreased with age in mesenteric arteries from 1-, 4-, 8-, and 16-wk-old rabbits. The maximum vasorelaxation response to acetylcholine (10(-6) M) in the presence of indomethacin and nitro-l-arginine decreased in the order of 1 wk (64.5 +/- 6.9%), 4 wk (52.6 +/- 8.9%), 8 wk (53.0 +/- 9.4%), and 16 wk (33.3 +/- 6.6%). Similarly, the maximum relaxation to AA (3 x 10(-4) M) decreased with age in the order of 1 wk (60.4 +/- 8.9%), 4 wk (56.3 +/- 5.8%), 8 wk (41.8 +/- 12.3%), and 16 wk (28.9 +/- 1.6%). In contrast, the vasorelaxation to sodium nitroprusside was not significantly altered by age. These data indicate that aortic 15-LO-1 expression and activity are downregulated with aging in rabbits. This decrease is paralleled by the reduced synthesis of vasoactive THETA and HEETA and aortic relaxations to acetylcholine and AA.
