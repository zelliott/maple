Using the indirect immunohistochemical approach, the occurrence of gamma-melanocyte stimulating hormone (gamma-MSH)-like immunoreactivity in human normal keratinocytes is described. The positive cells were observed in each layer of the epidermis (except stratum corneum) and often, at the level of the stratum spinosum, also around the orifices of cutaneous accessory organs, such as sweat glands and sebaceous glands/hair follicles. Combining these data with our previous investigations, the results support the possibility that locally produced gamma-MSH could be involved in cutaneous immune response, pigmentation and epithelial proliferation, as well as neuromodulation.
