The presence of a [Fe]-hydrogenase in the hydrogenosomes of the anaerobic chytridiomycete fungus Neocallimastix sp. L2 has been demonstrated by immunocytochemistry, subcellular fractionation, Western-blotting and measurements of hydrogenase activity in the presence of various concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO). Since the hydrogenosomal hydrogenase activity can be inhibited nearly completely by low concentrations of CO, it is likely that the [Fe]-hydrogenase is responsible for at least 90% of the hydrogen production in isolated hydrogenosomes. Most likely, this hydrogenase is encoded by the gene hydL2 that exhibits all the motifs that are characteristic of [Fe]-hydrogenases. The open reading frame starts with an N-terminal extension of 38 amino acids that has the potential to function as a hydrogenosomal targeting signal. The downstream sequences encode an enzyme of a calculated molecular mass of 66.4 kDa that perfectly matches the molecular mass of the mature hydrogenase in the hydrogenosome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the hydrogenase of Neocallimastix sp. L2. clusters together with similar ('long-type') [Fe]-hydrogenases from Trichomonas vaginalis, Nyctotherus ovalis, Desulfovibrio vulgaris and Thermotoga maritima. Phylogenetic analysis based on the H-cluster - the only module of [Fe]-hydrogenases that is shared by all types of [Fe]-hydrogenases and hydrogenase-like proteins - revealed a monophyly of all hydrogenase-like proteins of the aerobic eukaryotes. Our analysis suggests that the evolution of the various [Fe]-hydrogenases and hydrogenase-like proteins occurred by a differential loss of Fe-S clusters in the N-terminal part of the [Fe]-hydrogenase.
