The soybean light-harvesting complex II (LHC II) was composed of one major and three minor chlorophyll a/b (Cab) binding proteins. This study demonstrated that the soybean genome contained at least 11 genes that code for these Cab proteins. Three members of the soybean Cab gene family were characterized. Cab 3 coded for a 25.7 kD mature apoprotein with a 32 amino acid transit peptide. Comparisons with previously published Cab protein sequences indicated that Cab 3 coded for the major Cab protein of LHC II. Cab 2 coded for a novel Cab protein with an apparent molecular weight of 24.6 kD. Cab 2 retained a high degree of similarity with Cab 3, but distinguished itself from previously reported minor photosystem II type II Cab genes and products. Finally, Cab 1 was determined to be a pseudogene that had two deletions relative to Cab 2 and Cab 3.
