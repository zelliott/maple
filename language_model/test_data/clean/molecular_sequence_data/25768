Mutants in putative helix VIII of lactose permease that retain the ability to accumulate lactose were created by cassette mutagenesis. A mutagenic insert encoding amino acid residues 259-278 was synthesized chemically by using reagents contaminated with 1% each of the other three bases and ligated into a KpnI/BclI site in the lacY gene in plasmid pGEM-4. Mutants that retain transport activity were selected by transforming a strain of Escherichia coli containing a wild-type lacZ gene, but deleted in lacY, with the mutant library and identifying colonies that transport lactose on indicator plates. Sequencing of the mutated region in lacY in 129 positive colonies reveals 43 single amino acid mutations at 26 sites and 26 multiple mutations. The variable amino acid positions are largely on one side of the putative alpha-helix, a stripe opposite Glu269. This mutable stripe of low information content is probably in contact with the membrane phospholipids.
