Tetrapeptides, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS), Arg-Gly-Asp-Val (RGDV), and Arg-Gly-Asp-Thr (RGDT), respectively, appearing in the cell-attachment domains of fibronectin, vitronectin, and collagen, and pentapeptide Tyr-Ile-Gly-Ser-Arg (YIGSR) appearing in B1 chain of laminin, were synthesized by liquid-phase procedure. Bioactivities of RGD, RGDX (X = S, V and T), YIGSR, and YIGSR-NH2 as cell recognition determinants were investigated by cell-attachment test using these oligopeptides immobilized to ethylene-acrylic acid copolymer (PEA) film. The cell lines used were A431, NRK, CHO-K1, HeLa.S3, and RLC-16 cells. It was found that the residue X in RGDX plays an important role for cell-attachment activity of RGDX, and, regarding YIGSR, introduction of NH2 residue at the C-terminal of the pentapeptide enhances the cell-attachment activity.
