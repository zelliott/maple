The NH2 and COOH propieces of fibril-forming collagens are cleaved off extracellularly and have been implicated in feedback regulation of their own synthesis. Recently, we showed that a subfragment of the carboxyl-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (residues 197-241) dramatically augments extracellular matrix production in subconfluent fibroblasts. This stimulation of type I collagen, type III collagen, and fibronectin production occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner with no effect on total protein synthesis or on the ratio of secreted proteins to cell-associated proteins (Katayama, K., Seyer, J.M., Raghow, R., and Kang, A.H. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 7097-7104). In the present report, we have extensively dissected this subfragment of the propeptide and found that the pentapeptide Lys-Thr-Thr-Lys-Ser (residues 212-216) is the minimum sequence necessary for potent stimulation of collagen and fibronectin production in a variety of mesenchymal cells. We postulate that the extracellular matrix production in fibroblasts may be subject to either positive or negative feedback regulation depending on the repertoire of specific proteases during postinflammatory tissue regeneration and fibrosis.
