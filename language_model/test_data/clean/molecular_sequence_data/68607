The pentapeptide fragment of ANF, Asn-Ser-Phe-Arg-Tyr-NH2, coordinates to Cu(II) using the same four nitrogen donor centers as simple pentapeptides such as pentaalanine yet the complexes are of much higher stability as a result of a highly organized side-chain structure which is present in the complex but absent from the free ligand.
