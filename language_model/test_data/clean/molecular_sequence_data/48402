This study was undertaken to evaluate the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) variants in cervical samples. L1 genetic variable region was studied in 10 HPV types: HPV 11, 16, 18, 33, 53, 54, 56, 61, 66 and 81. A total of 116 isolates were examined, including 47 HPVs isolated from women with normal cytology and 69 with abnormal cytology of different grades. HPV sequences were detected using MY09/MY11 consensus primers. Fifty silent and 65 missense mutations were detected. Two missense mutations were detected in HPV18, 3 in HPV56 and 17 in HPV61. The number of missense mutations per isolate ranged from 1 to 3, except in HPV54 and HPV61, where 7 and 11 missense mutations were found, respectively. Most of the isolates (52.3Â %) with missense mutations were isolated from women with abnormal cervical samples. Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cytology diagnosis dominated all cervical abnormalities. This study is the first on the identification of molecular variants in the Middle East and suggests the circulation of new HPV subtypes and variants in Kuwait, which needs to be confirmed by further analysis of the complete HPV genome.
