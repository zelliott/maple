A novel halotolerant psychrotrophic gram-negative bacterium, strain 2pS, was isolated from lenses of water brine in Arctic permafrost (cryopeg). The optimal growth of the new strain was observed at 16-18 degrees C; the maximal and minimal growth temperatures were 37 degrees C and -2 degrees C, respectively. The pH growth range was 5.8 to 8.5 (optimum 6.5-7.5) and the range of medium salinity was 0 to 100 g/l (optimum 3-8 g/l NaCl). The strain 2pS did not produce acid from carbohydrates and utilized acetate, yeast extract, pyruvate, glutarate, fumarate, caproate, heptanoate, butyrate, malate, DL-lactate, citrate, L-proline, L-tyrosine, butanol, and dulcitol as the sole carbon and energy sources. The major fatty acids of the cell wall at optimal growth temperature were C18:1(omega 7) and C18:1(omega 9). The G + C DNA content was 46.0 mol.%. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the studied strain was the closest (97% similarity) to Psychrobacter nivimaris DSM 16093T, a halotolerant psychrotrophic bacterium isolated from the Arctic sea's ice. Genotypic and phenotypic differences of the new bacterium from closely related species lead to the conclusion that strain 2pS belongs to a novel species of the genus Psychrobacter: Psychrobacter muriicola sp. nov.
