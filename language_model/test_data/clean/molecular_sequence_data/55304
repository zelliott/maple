In this study, the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) genes in spotted halibut were cloned and sequenced by isolating their cDNAs. The species expressed three molecular forms of GnRH in the brain: chicken-type GnRH-II (cGnRH-II), seabream-type GnRH (sbGnRH), and salmon-type GnRH (sGnRH). Phylogenetic analysis divided the molecular forms of GnRHs into three branches: cGnRH-II branch, sGnRH branch, and fish-specific GnRH branch. The spatial expression showed that they had the highest expression levels in the brain. cGnRH-II was exclusively detected in the brain, while sbGnRH had a global expression pattern in all examined organs. sGnRH was detected in the brain, pituitary, and ovary. The temporal changes of brain GnRH mRNA expression levels were examined during ovarian maturation and postspawning, and the serum steroid hormones and gonadosomatic index (GSI) were recorded. Amounts of sbGnRH mRNA substantially elevated (P < 0.05) during ovarian maturation, which concomitant with considerable elevation of GSI and serum steroids levels. On the contrary, neither sGnRH nor cGnRH-II mRNA levels showed significant changes during ovarian maturation in this study. These results suggested that these three GnRH genes are the important regulators for the differential expression of GnRH in spotted halibut, and would help us better understand the reproductive endocrine mechanism of spotted halibut.
