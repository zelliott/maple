A gene named calB was cloned and characterized in Dictyostelium. A relationship to calmodulin (CaM) is suggested by sequence identity (50%), similar exon-intron structure and cross-reactivity with anti-CaM sera. The level of calB mRNA is developmentally regulated with maxima during aggregation and in spores. CalB null cells grow normally, develop and produce viable spores. We demonstrated the capacity of tagged CalB to bind Ca(2+) using the (45)Ca(2+) overlay assay and showed that its mobility on SDS-PAGE is dependent on Ca(2+)/EGTA pretreatment.
