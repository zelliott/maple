It has long been possible to analyse small molecules accurately and reproducibly by mass-spectrometric techniques. Two new techniques extend the application of mass spectrometry to proteins and other biopolymers of high molecular mass. The accuracy, sensitivity and resolving power of these new methods permits the detection of minor, but biologically significant protein modifications.
