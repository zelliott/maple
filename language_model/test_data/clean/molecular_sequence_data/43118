The DNA sequence encoding the spike gene from the DF2 strain of Type II feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), a temperature sensitive FIPV virus (TS-DF2) and an isolate of feline enteric coronavirus (FECV 1683) were determined. Comparison of the published WSU 1146 and DF2 FIPV S genes showed that the viruses shared a high degree of homology (99.6%). Likewise, the S gene of the virulent DF2 FIPV virus was closely conserved to that isolated from the vaccine virus strain, TS-DF2 FIPV. In contrast, the FECV S gene had numerous DNA and amino acid differences when compared to the virulent FIPV sequences. Sequence differences among the feline coronavirus isolates were localized to the amino-terminus region of the S gene.
