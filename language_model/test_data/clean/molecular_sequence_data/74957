The murine dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene gives rise to multiple polyadenylated mRNAs displaying heterogeneity in the length of the 3' untranslated region. These species are present in the cytoplasm at levels that vary over 2 orders of magnitude, suggesting that certain poly(A) sites are preferred over others. Previous observations have shown that three out of the four major sites of polyadenylation do not display consensus hexanucleotide (AATAAA, ATTAAA) signals. We have further analyzed the sequences involved in directing multiple polyadenylation events on the DHFR gene by focusing our attention on the 4.1- and 5.6-kilobase mRNAs, the lowest abundance DHFR species observed on RNA blot analysis. Identification and sequence analysis of the poly(A) addition sites corresponding to these species revealed appropriately positioned consensus hexanucleotide signals; additional nearby poly(A) sites were also detected which apparently do not use consensus hexanucleotides to direct poly(A) addition to DHFR mRNAs of relatively lower abundance. We have also identified polyadenylation sites downstream of the 4.1- and 5.6-kilobase sites which display consensus hexanucleotide signals and correspond to messenger species too rare for detection by routine RNA blot analysis. Our data bring to 11 the number of known functional poly(A) addition sites associated with the DHFR gene.
