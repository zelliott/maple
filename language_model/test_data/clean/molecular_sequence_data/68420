To evaluate the potential of the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to promote efficient expression of foreign genes in the yeast, S. cerevisiae, we have constructed E. coli-yeast shuttle vectors in which the EMCV 5' non-coding region was fused to the reporter gene, human prothymosin alpha. Efficiency of translation of corresponding RNA transcripts in mammalian cell-free systems was highly dependent on the sequence context and/or position of the initiation codon. No translation of these IRES-dependent mRNAs occurred in S. cerevisiae.
