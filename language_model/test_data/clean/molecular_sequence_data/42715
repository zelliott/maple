The effect of the peptide FMRF-amide on the electrical activity of the leech Retzius (R) cell was investigated using electrophysiological techniques. FMRF-amide and six structurally related analogs increased the excitability of the R cell in several distinct ways that could act in concert to modulate transmitter release. 'Puffs' of FMRF-amide transiently depolarized the cell leading to a barrage of action potentials. This depolarization was followed by a phase of rhythmical bursting that appeared intrinsic to the neuron. FMRF-amide also broadened the plateau of the Ca(2+)-dependent action potential. The results suggest that the terminal Phe and Arg as well as the C-terminal amide are critical for the activity of these peptides.
