Increasing evidence indicates an involvement of B cells in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, little is known about antigenic targets recognized by antibodies present in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients. This study was therefore aimed at identifying the antigen reactivity of antibodies present in CSF and compares the identified antibody profile with that of the serum of the same patient using cDNA phage display. Selection rounds on paired CSF and serum of this patient identified 13 antigenic targets of which 5 were enriched by serum antibodies and 2 were identified by CSF antibodies. Interestingly, the six remaining antigenic targets were shown to be recognized by both CSF and serum antibodies. These findings point towards both common as well as distinct antibody profiles in CSF and serum of MS patients.
