A clinical strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae carried the bla(SHV-49) gene, encoding a novel inhibitor-resistant beta-lactamase of pI 7.6, derived from SHV-1 by the single substitution M69I. It also harbored a gene differing from bla(SHV-11) by four silent mutations and coding for a penicillinase. Both genes were chromosome located and might represent either a species-specific gene or an acquired resistance gene.
