The review is mainly devoted to snake venom alpha-neurotoxins which target different muscle-type and neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The primary and spatial structures of other snake venom proteins as well as mammalian proteins of the Ly-6 family, which structurally resemble the 'three-finger' snake proteins, are also briefly discussed. The main emphasis is placed on recent data characterizing the alpha-neurotoxin interactions with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.
