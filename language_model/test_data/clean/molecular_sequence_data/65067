A new bacterial strain capable of producing cellulose was isolated from a hot spring. The isolate was Gram-negative, aerobic, and rod-shaped. The optimum temperature for growth was 40-45 degrees C. Methanol, glucose and other common carbohydrates were not utilized as sole growth substrates. Thiosulfate was not oxidized. The G+C content of the DNA was determined to be 64.0 mol%. Comparative 16S rDNA analysis indicated that Bosea thiooxidans and some strains of the genus Methylobacterium were the nearest relatives. The isolate can be distinguished from these relatives by its defectiveness in methanol utilization and thiosulfate oxidation. On the basis of its phenotypic properties and phylogeny, it is proposed that the isolate be designated Balneomonas flocculans gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain is TFBT (= JCM 11936T, = KCTC 12101T, = IAM 15034T, = ATCC BAA-817T).
