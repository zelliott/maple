An insertion sequence (IS) element of Brucella ovis, named IS6501, was isolated and its complete nucleotide sequence determined. IS6501 is 836 bp in length and occurs 20-35 times in the B. ovis genome and 5-15 times in other Brucella species. Analysis of the junctions at the sites of insertion revealed a small target site duplication of four bases and inverted repeats of 17 bp with one mismatch. IS6501 presents significant similarity (53.4%) with IS427 identified in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, suggesting a common ancestral sequence. A long ORF of 708 bp was identified encoding a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 26 kDa and sharing sequence identity with the hypothetical protein 1 of A. tumefaciens and with the transposase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. IS6501 is present in all Brucella strains we have tested. Restriction fragment length polymorphism of reference and field strains of two species (B. melitensis and B. ovis) was studied using either pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) on XbaI-digested DNA or hybridization of EcoRI-digested DNA using IS6501 as a probe. The genome of B. melitensis biovar 3 contains about 10 IS copies per genome and field strains of the same species could not be distinguished either by IS hybridization or by XbaI (PFGE) restriction patterns. In contrast, the number of IS copies in the B. ovis genome is around 30 and the different field strains can be differentiated by both methods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
