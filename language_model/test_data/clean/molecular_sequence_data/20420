The interaction of DNA topology modifying enzymes with eukaryotic DNA replication origins can be detected with nucleotide precision exploiting the action of enzyme poisons specific for type I or type II DNA topoisomerases. Using the topoisomerase I poison camptothecin and the topoisomerase II poison VP16, the precise sites of interaction of these enzymes around the lamin B2 origin have been identified at different points in the cell cycle. The procedure can be applied to any origin for which the sequence has been identified within approximately 1 kb.
