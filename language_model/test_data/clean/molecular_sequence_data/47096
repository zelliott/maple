Lactate transport across cell membranes is mediated by a family of proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) expresses a unique member of this family, MCT3. A portion of the human MCT3 gene was cloned by polymerase chain reaction using primers designed from rat RPE MCT3 cDNA sequence. The human genomic sequence was used to design primers to clone human MCT3 cDNA and to identify a bacterial artificial chromosome clone containing the human MCT3 gene. The human MCT3 cDNA contained a 1512-nucleotide open reading frame with a deduced amino sequence 85% identical to rat MCT3. Comparison of the cDNA and genomic sequences revealed that the MCT3 gene was composed of five exons distributed over 5 kb of DNA. The exon-intron borders were conserved between the human and the chicken MCT3 genes. Using radiation hybrid mapping, the MCT3 gene was mapped to chromosome 22 between markers WI11639 and SGC30687. A search of chromosome 22 in the Sanger Centre database confirmed the location of the human MCT3 gene at 22q12.3-q13.2.
