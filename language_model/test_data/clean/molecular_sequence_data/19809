The chloroplast (cp) DNA sequence of Jasminum nudiflorum (Oleaceae-Jasmineae) is completed and compared with the large single-copy region sequences from 6 related species. The cp genomes of the tribe Jasmineae (Jasminum and Menodora) show several distinctive rearrangements, including inversions, gene duplications, insertions, inverted repeat expansions, and gene and intron losses. The ycf4-psaI region in Jasminum section Primulina was relocated as a result of 2 overlapping inversions of 21,169 and 18,414 bp. The 1st, larger inversion is shared by all members of the Jasmineae indicating that it occurred in the common ancestor of the tribe. Similar rearrangements were also identified in the cp genome of Menodora. In this case, 2 fragments including ycf4 and rps4-trnS-ycf3 genes were moved by 2 additional inversions of 14 and 59 kb that are unique to Menodora. Other rearrangements in the Oleaceae are confined to certain regions of the Jasminum and Menodora cp genomes, including the presence of highly repeated sequences and duplications of coding and noncoding sequences that are inserted into clpP and between rbcL and psaI. These insertions are correlated with the loss of 2 introns in clpP and a serial loss of segments of accD. The loss of the accD gene and clpP introns in both the monocot family Poaceae and the eudicot family Oleaceae are clearly independent evolutionary events. However, their genome organization is surprisingly similar despite the distant relationship of these 2 angiosperm families.
