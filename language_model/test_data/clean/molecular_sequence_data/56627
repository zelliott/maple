Recombinant plasmids were constructed for the efficient expression in E. coli cells of the human interleukin-2 (HIL-2) gene and two its mutant analogues obtained by of chemical-enzymic synthesis and polymerase chain reaction (deletion of 14 C-terminal amino acids and a change of the codon for Trp121 to Phe). The recombinant HIL-2 but not the mutant analogues were shown to be biologically active. Both analogues obtained were weak antagonists to HIL-2.
