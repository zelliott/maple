The paper presents the results of molecular virological monitoring of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) by reverse-polymerase chain reaction (followed by sequence of F-gene fragment 374 p.n.) and chick embryo isolation of samples from the avian cloacal swabs collected in the south of the Primorye Territory in September-October 2001-2004. It shows that before 2004, there were only slightly pathogenic variants of NDV of genotype 1 in this region and in 2004 they were added by highly pathogenic variants of subtypes 3a and 5b. The impact of landscaping features of the south of the Primorye Territory on the environment of NDV is discussed.
