Triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) are generally designed to inhibit transcription or DNA replication but can be used for more diverse purposes. Here we have designed a chimera peptide-TFO able to activate transcription from a target gene. The designed hybrid molecule contains a triplex-forming sequence, linked through a phosphoroamidate bond to several minimal transcriptional activation domains derived from Herpes simplex virus protein 16 (VP16). We show here that this TFO-peptide chimera (TFO-P) can specifically recognise its DNA target at physiological salt and pH conditions. Bound to the double-stranded target DNA in a promoter region, the TFO-P is able to activate gene expression. Our results suggest that this type of molecule may prove useful in the design of new tools for artificial modulation of gene expression.
