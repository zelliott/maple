We present DNA sequences flanking cloned hypervariable human minisatellites. In addition to providing confirmatory evidence that minisatellites cluster with other tandem repeats, these flanking sequences contain a high frequency of interspersed repetitive elements. These elements include a retroviral LTR-like sequence, from which one of the minisatellites appears to have expanded, and a recently described short interspersed repeat. We present our own findings concerning this element, in particular that those examples studied do not show significant evolutionary conservation, despite suggestions that the element may have a cis-acting function.
