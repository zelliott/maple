Twenty-three polypeptides secreted in response to a deficiency of inorganic phosphate (Pi) were previously found by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis in mycelia of Pholiota nameko strain N2. In this study, N-terminal sequencing revealed three of them to be identical to known acid phosphatases of P. nameko strain N114. Two cDNAs and the corresponding genomic DNAs of genes PNAP1 and PNAP2 which encode two of the three acid phosphatases were cloned. The deduced amino acid sequences of PNAP1 and PNAP2 showed high similarity to other fungal acid phosphatases and contained a putative catalytic active site of acid phosphatase. PNAP1 and PNAP2 are comprised of five and seven exons interrupted by four and six introns, respectively. Their promoter regions include two cis-acting elements found in Pi deficiency-inducible genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, together with several known functional elements such as a TATA box. Northern blot analysis showed that PNAP1 and PNAP2 are expressed in response to a deficiency of Pi.
