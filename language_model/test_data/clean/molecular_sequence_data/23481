The caspase-associated ring proteins (CARP1 and CARP2) are distinguished from other caspase regulators by the presence of a FYVE-type zinc finger domain. FYVE-type domains are divided into two known classes: FYVE domains that specifically bind to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate in lipid bilayers and FYVE-related domains of undetermined function. Here, we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal region of CARP2 (44-139) including the FYVE-type domain and its associated helical bundle at 1.7 A resolution. The structure reveals a cramped phosphoinositide binding pocket and a blunted membrane insertion loop. These structural features indicate that the domain is not optimized to bind to phosphoinositides or insert into lipid bilayers. The CARP2 FYVE-like domain thus defines a third subfamily of FYVE-type domains that are functionally and structurally distinct. Structural analyses provide insights into the possible function of this unique subfamily of FYVE-type domains.
