Pesticides based on the s-triazine ring structure are widely used in cultivation of food crops. Cleavage of the s-triazine ring is an important step in the mineralization of s-triazine compounds and hence in their complete removal from the environment. Cyanuric acid amidohydrolase cleaves cyanuric acid (2,4,6-trihydroxy-s-triazine), which yields carbon dioxide and biuret; the biuret is subject to further metabolism, which yields CO(2) and ammonia. The trzD gene encoding cyanuric acid amidohydrolase was cloned into pMMB277 from Pseudomonas sp. strain NRRLB-12227, a strain that is capable of utilizing s-triazines as nitrogen sources. Hydrolysis of cyanuric acid was detected in crude extracts of Escherichia coli containing the cloned gene by monitoring the disappearance of cyanuric acid and the appearance of biuret by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). DEAE and hydrophobic interaction HPLC were used to purify cyanuric acid amidohydrolase to homogeneity, and a spectrophotometric assay for the purified enzyme was developed. The purified enzyme had an apparent K(m) of 0.05 mM for cyanuric acid at pH 8.0. The enzyme did not cleave any other s-triazine or hydroxypyrimidine compound, although barbituric acid (2,4, 6-trihydroxypyrimidine) was found to be a strong competitive inhibitor. Neither the nucleotide sequence of trzD nor the amino acid sequence of the gene product exhibited a significant level of similarity to any known gene or protein.
