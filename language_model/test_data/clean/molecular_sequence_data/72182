We examined the effect of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS ODNs) directed against v-Ki-ras on the anchorage-independent growth of v-Ki-ras-transformed rat fibroblasts using plates coated with an antiadhesive polymer, poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (polyHEMA). Among AS ODNs tested, 17mer AS ODN centered around codon 12 of v-Ki-ras inhibited the v-Ki-Ras expression and v-Ki-Ras-induced anchorage-independent growth, while its sense sequence did not affect it. Using polyHEMA plates, the direct addition of AS ODNs to the cells growing anchorage-independently and various treatment schedules of AS ODNs are now available to identify the most desirable conditions for AS ODNs treatment.
