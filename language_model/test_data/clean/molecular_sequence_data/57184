Synthesis of the 86-kDa FatA outer membrane protein is repressed under iron-rich conditions. Complementation of transposition mutants derived from clones containing the pJM1 iron uptake region revealed the existence of an antisense RNA, RNA alpha. This RNA is only expressed under iron-rich conditions and acts as a negative regulator of FatA synthesis, with slight but discernible decrease in the steady-state level of fatA mRNA determined by RNase protection and by Northern blot analysis. Primer extension experiments revealed that the level of several possible fatA transcripts was reduced in the presence of RNA alpha. In addition, we found that fatA mRNA expression is slightly reduced in the presence of Escherichia coli Fur. We have identified and cloned a chromosomally encoded fur-like gene in Vibrio anguillarum.
