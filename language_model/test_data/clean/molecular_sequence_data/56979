Fifteen new phage lambda vectors are discussed: lambda SK4, lambda SK6, lambda SK10, lambda SK16, lambda SK17, lambda SK20, lambda SK21, lambda SK22, lambda SK23, lambda SK24, lambda SK25, lambda SK27, lambda SK28, lambda SK40 and lambda SK41. Their structural and functional features facilitate the implementation of a number of new strategies and cloning procedures which simplify, economize and vastly improve the utility and efficiency of library construction in lambda vectors. Such improved strategies and examples of their application, with particular reference to jumping and linking libraries, are presented.
