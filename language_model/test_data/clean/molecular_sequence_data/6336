Asymmetric acetylcholinesterase (AChE) contains three tetrameric sets of catalytic subunits disulfide-linked to structural subunits of a collagenic tail. This form is localized in the basement membrane zone of the neuromuscular junction, where it interacts with proteoglycans. It has been described that heparin-binding domains of many proteins contains clusters of basic residues. Here we show that protamine--a highly basic protein--specifically solubilizes asymmetric AChE from the rat neuromuscular junction, starting at 25 micrograms/ml and reaching a plateau at 250 micrograms/ml protamine. We also show that protamine was able to displace AChE bound to heparin-agarose. Two synthetic peptides corresponding to the sequence of the collagenic tail polypeptide also release the enzyme. Finally, we propose that two heparin-binding consensus sequences (-B-B-X-B-) are present in the tail of AChE. Our results indicate that clusters of basic residues are responsible for the interaction of the collagen-tailed AChE with proteoglycans.
