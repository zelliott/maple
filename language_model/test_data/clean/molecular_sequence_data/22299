We report the use of representational difference analysis to identify genes that have up-regulated expression in the amastigote life-cycle stage of Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis. This simultaneous process of selection and amplification allowed the cloning of several specific DNA fragments. One of them shows a high percentage of similarity with histone H1 genes from other Trypanosomatids and, as expected, is up-regulated in the amastigote life-cycle stage. The gene is present in two copies that are expressed at different levels in promastigotes and also in amastigotes, which seems to be a consequence of their different 3' untranslated regions.
