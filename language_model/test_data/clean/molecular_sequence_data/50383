We have determined the H-2 class II allele-specific amino acid motif of the agretope (the site of contact between the peptide antigen and the major histocompatibility complex) for a synthetic peptide composed of residues 43-58 of pigeon cytochrome c (p43-58). Residues 46 and 54 functioned as the agretope, and residues 50 and 52 functioned as the epitope (the site for contact between the peptide antigen and the T-cell antigen receptor). In general, agretopes and epitopes function independently. Thus, substitution of amino acids in the epitope does not significantly affect binding of the peptide antigen to a class II molecule. On the basis of these findings, synthetic peptide vaccines against influenza Aichi (H3N2) virus were prepared by introducing seven residues of the influenza virus hemagglutinin into the frame component residues 43-46 and 54-58 of p43-58 analogues including the agretopes for Ak or Ab previously determined on the p43-58 segment. These peptide vaccines induced both helper T-cell responses and production of antibodies that were specific for influenza Aichi hemagglutinin but not for the major histocompatibility complex binding frame in mice bearing Ak or Ab. The antibodies produced neutralize the infectivity of influenza Aichi in vitro. The present findings should provide a basis for preparing potent peptide vaccines that function without producing side effects.
