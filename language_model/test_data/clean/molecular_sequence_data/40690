The phylogeny and taxonomy of Phytophthora cryptogea and Phytophthora drechsleri has long been a matter of controversy. To re-evaluate this, a worldwide collection of 117 isolates assigned to either P. cryptogea, P. drechsleri or their sister taxon, Phytophthora erythroseptica were assessed for morphological, physiological (pathological, cultural, temperature relations, mating) and molecular traits. Multiple gene phylogenetic analysis was performed on DNA sequences of nuclear (internal transcribed spacers (ITS), ß-tubulin, translation elongation factor 1α, elicitin) and mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) genes. Congruence was observed between the different phylogenetic data sets and established that P. drechsleri and P. cryptogea are distinct species. Isolates of P. drechsleri form a monophyletic grouping with low levels of intraspecific diversity whereas P. cryptogea is more variable. Three distinct phylogenetic groups were noted within P. cryptogea with an intermediate group providing strong evidence for introgression of previously isolated lineages. This evidence suggests that P. cryptogea is an operational taxonomic unit and should remain a single species. Of all the morphological and physiological traits only growth rate at higher temperatures reliably discriminated isolates of P. drechsleri and P. cryptogea. As a homothallic taxon, P. erythroseptica, considered the cause of potato pink rot, is clearly different in mating behaviour from the other two species. Pathogenicity, however, was not a reliable characteristic as all isolates of the three species formed pink rot in potato tubers. The phylogenetic evidence suggests P. erythroseptica has evolved from P. cryptogea more recently than the split from the most recent common ancestor of all three species. However, more data and more isolates of authentic P. erythroseptica are needed to fully evaluate the taxonomic position of this species.
