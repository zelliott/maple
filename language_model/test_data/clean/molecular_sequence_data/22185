In many complexes formed by serine proteinases and their inhibitors, the hydroxyl group provided by water molecule or by the inhibitor Ser residue is located close to the inhibitor P1-P1' reactive site. In order to investigate the role of this group, we synthesized analogues of trypsin inhibitor SFTI-1 isolated from the seeds of sunflower modified in P1 by alpha-hydroxymethylserine (HmSer) and both enantiomers of alpha-hydroxymethylvaline (HmVal). All the synthesized analogues inhibited bovine beta-trypsin and human leukocyte elastase. SFTI-1 analogues with HmVal and HmSer appear to be potent inhibitors of bovine beta-trypsin, whereas [Val5]SFTI-1 is practically inactive. Also trypsin inhibitory activity of [Ser5]SFTI-1 is significantly lower. Since the electrostatic interaction between protonated epsilon-NH2 group of the inhibitor P1 position and beta-carboxylate of trypsin Asp189 is the main driving force for interaction of both molecules, the results obtained are very interesting. We believe that these SFTI-1 analogues belong to a novel class of serine proteinase inhibitors.
