Nucleotide sequences minimally containing adenosine, cytosine or guanosine are sufficient to form intrastrand oligonucleotide quinone methide self-adducts reversibly for subsequent alkylation of complementary DNA. The general lack of sequence restrictions should now allow for alkylation of most any target of interest although reaction is most efficient when the self-adducts contain guanine residues and do not form hairpin structures.
