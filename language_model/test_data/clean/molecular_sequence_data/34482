To analyze and predict the structure and function correlated to interferon sensitivity of HCV Core protein in different genotypes.

Using different bioinformafics software respectively to comparatively analyze and predict the secondary structure, tertiary structure, modification site and main functional motifs of HCV Core protein.

There were diversities in secondary structure and tertiary structure of different genotypes. HCV Core protein would exist some modification sites about amidation, cAMP, PKC, TYR, and interact with amphiphysin SH3 domain, ERK, PKC.

Differences in structure and function of HCV Core protein of different genotypes affected interferon sensitivity.
