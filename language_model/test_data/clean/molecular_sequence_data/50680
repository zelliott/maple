A total of 103 beta thalassemia genes from 78 children (45 with Hb E/beta thalassemia, 8 with beta thalassemia heterozygotes, and 25 with homozygous beta thalassemia) were analyzed using dot-blot hybridization of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA and direct DNA sequencing. Nine mutations were characterized in 98/103 (95%) of beta thalassemia alleles, of which six (a 4 bp deletion in codons 41-42, a G-C transition at position 5 of IVS-1, A-G transition at codon 19, an A-T transition at codon 17, an A-G transition at position -28 upstream of the beta globin gene, a G-T transition at position 1 of IVS-1), accounted for 92%. The spectrum of beta thalassemia mutations in Chinese Thai is similar to that reported among the Chinese from other parts of the world. The distribution of beta thalassemia mutations in Muslim Thai is similar to that reported among Malaysians. The most common beta thalassemia mutation in Thai and Chinese Thai patients is the frameshift mutation at codons 41-42, in comparison with the Muslim Thai in whom the G-C transition at position 5 of the IVS-1 mutation predominates. The heterogeneity of molecular defects causing beta thalassemia should aid in the planning of a prenatal diagnosis program for beta thalassemia in the South of Thailand.
