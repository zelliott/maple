Novel photoactivatable antagonists of human/rat corticotropin-releasing factor (h/rCRF) have been synthesized and characterized. The N-terminal amino acid D-phenylalanine in astressin ¿cyclo(30-33) [D-Phe12, Nle21,38, Glu30, Lys33]h/rCRF-(12-41)¿, a potent CRF peptide antagonist, was replaced by a phenyldiazirine, the 4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl (ATB) residue. Additionally, His32 of astressin was substituted by either alanine or tyrosine for specific radioactive labeling with 125I at either His13 or Tyr32, respectively. The photoactivatable CRF antagonists were tested for their ability to displace 125I-labeled Tyr0 ovine CRF ([125I-labeled Tyr0]oCRF) in binding experiments and to inhibit oCRF-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, permanently transfected with cDNA coding for rat CRF receptor, type 1 (rCRFR1) or human Y-79 retinoblastoma cells known to carry endogenous functional human CRFR1 (hCRFR1). ATB-cyclo(30-33)[Nle21,38, Glu30, Ala32, Lys33]h/rCRF-(13-41) (compound 1) was found to bind with higher affinity to rat or human CRFR1 when compared with ATB-cyclo(30-33)[Nle21,38, Glu30, Tyr32, Lys33]h/rCRF-(13-41) (compound 2) and exhibited higher inhibition of oCRF-stimulated cAMP accumulation in HEK 293 cells stably transfected with cDNA coding for rCRFR1 (HEK-rCRFR1 cells) or Y-79 cells. A highly glycosylated, 66-kDa protein was identified with SDS/PAGE, when the radioactively iodinated compounds 1 or 2 were covalently linked to rCRFR1. The specificity of the photoactivatable 125I-labeled CRF antagonists was demonstrated with SDS/PAGE by the finding that these analogs could be displaced from the receptor by their corresponding nonlabeled form, but not other unrelated peptides such as vasoactive intestinal peptide. The observed molecular size of the receptor was in agreement with the size of CRFR1 found in rat pituitary (66 kDa), but was significantly larger than the size of CRFR1 found in rat cerebellum and olfactory bulb (53 kDa).
