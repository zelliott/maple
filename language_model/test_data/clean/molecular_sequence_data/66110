The identification of biomarkers (both molecules and profiles) in patient sera offers enormous interest for the diagnosis of cancers. In this context, the detection of antibodies to tumor cell autologous antigens possesses great potential. The humoral immune response represents a form of biological amplification of signals that are otherwise weak because of very low concentrations of antigen, especially in the early stages of cancers. Herein we present the use of integral microarrays spotted with tumor-derived proteins to investigate the antibody repertoire in the sera of lung cancer patients and controls. The use of two-dimensional liquid chromatography allowed us to separate proteins from the lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 into 1760 fractions, which were printed in duplicate, along with various controls, onto nitrocellulose coated slides. The sensitivity and specificity of the microarrays to detect singular antibodies in fluids were first validated through the recognition of fractions containing a lung marker antigen by antibody probing. Twenty fractions were initially selected as highly reactive against the anti-PGP9.5 antibody, and subsequent mass spectrometry analyses confirmed the identity of PGP9.5 protein in four of them. As a result, the importance of neighboring fractions in microarray detection was revealed due to the spreading of proteins during the separation process. Next, the microarrays were individually incubated with 14 serum samples from patients with lung cancer patients, 14 sera from colon cancer patients, and 14 control sera from normal subjects. The reactivity of the selected fractions was analyzed, and the level of immunoglobulin bound to each fraction by each serum sample was quantified. Eight of the 20 fractions offered p values < 0.01 and were recognized by an average of four reacting patients, whereas no serum from normal individuals was positive for those fractions. Protein microarrays from tumor-derived fractions hold the diagnostic potential of uncovering antigens that induce an immune response in patients with certain types of cancers.
