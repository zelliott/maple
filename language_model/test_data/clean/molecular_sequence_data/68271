We have determined the major sites responsible for isoaspartate formation during in vitro aging of bovine brain calmodulin under mild conditions. Protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.77) was used to quantify isoaspartate by the transfer of methyl-3H from S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine to the isoaspartyl (alpha-carboxyl) side chain. More than 1.2 mol of methyl-acceptor sites per mol of calmodulin accumulated during a 2-week incubation without calcium at pH 7.4, 37 degrees C. Analysis of proteolytic peptides of aged calmodulin revealed that > 95% of the methylation capacity is restricted to residues in the four calcium-binding domains, which are predicted to be highly flexible in the absence of calcium. We estimate that domains III, IV, and II accumulated 0.72, 0.60, and 0.13 mol of isoaspartate per mol of calmodulin, respectively. The Asn-97-Gly-98 sequence (domain III) is the greatest contributor to isoaspartate formation. Other major sites of isoaspartate formation are Asp-131-Gly-132 and Asp-133-Gly-134 in domain IV, and Asn-60-Gly-61 in domain II. Significant isoaspartate formation was also localized to Asp-20, Asp-22, and/or Asp-24 in domain I, to Asp-56 and/or Asp-58 in domain II, and to Asp-93 and/or Asp-95 in domain III. All of these residues are calcium ligands in the highly conserved EF-hand calcium-binding motif. Thus, other EF-hand proteins may also be subject to isoaspartate formation at these ligands. The results support the idea that isoaspartate formation in structured proteins is strongly influenced by both the C-flanking residue and by local flexibility.
