A liquid chromatographic/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometric method for the determination of tert-butyloxycarbonyl-Tyr-Leu-Val-CH2Cl (Boc-YLV-CH2Cl) was investigated. Boc-YLV-CH2Cl was eluted from a Cosmosil 5C8 column in a solvent system of 0.1% acetic acid-methanol (30: 70, v/v). The positive ion spectrum of Boc-YLV-CH2Cl showed a quasi-molecular ion at m/z 526 with fragment ions which provided structural information. Boc-YLV-CH2Cl was purified from blood and tissue samples with Sep-Pak C18 cartridges. The analysis in biological samples was performed by focusing the characteristic ion at m/z 526. The calibration graphs were linear over the concentration range studied (injected amounts of 9.5-190 pmol). The method was applied to the determination of Boc-YLV-CH2Cl in biological samples.
