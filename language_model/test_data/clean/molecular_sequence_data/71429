A novel form of congenital growth hormone insensitivity syndrome (GHIS), which lacks the classic phenotype associated with this condition, is described. Dominant inheritance is shown to result from a heterozygous 876-1 G to C transversion of the 3' splice acceptor site preceding exon 9 in the growth hormone receptor (GHR) gene. The result of this mutation is a severely truncated cytoplasmic domain of the GHR, which is incapable of transmitting a signal. The mutant receptor is shown to form a heterodimer with the wild-type GHR, the activity of which is inhibited in a dominant-negative manner.
