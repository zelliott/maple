Mutants with oxazolidinone MICs, 2- to 16-fold higher than those of parents, were selected from two of five clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis during exposure to AZD2563, but only at frequencies of ca. 10(-8). Resistance was not selected in Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). Mutants of one E. faecalis isolate had a G2576-->U 23S rRNA mutation; mutants derived from the second E. faecalis isolate lacked this mutation.
