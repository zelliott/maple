A new furostanol glycoside was isolated from the rhizomes of Costus spicatus. Its structure was established as (3 beta,22 alpha,25R)-26-(beta -D-glucopyranosyloxy)-22-methoxyfurost-5-en-3-yl O-D-apio-beta-D-furanosyl-(1-->2)-O-[6-deoxy-alpha-L-mannopyranosy l-(1-->4)]- beta-D-glucopyranoside. The structural identification was performed using detailed analysis of 1H and 13C NMR spectra including 2D NMR spectroscopic techniques (COSY, HETCOR and COLOC) and chemical conversions.
