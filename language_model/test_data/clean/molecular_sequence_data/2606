A human placental lambda gt11 expression cDNA library was screened for nidogen cDNAs by hybridizations with a heterologous mouse nidogen cDNA. A total of four positive overlapping clones were identified, and the sizes of the inserts were shown to vary from 0.8 to 2.8 kb. Nucleotide sequencing of the human cDNAs revealed that the largest clone, cHPN-16, contained both a 5' open reading frame encoding 582 amino acids and a 3' untranslated region of 1,063 nucleotides. Comparison of human cDNA sequences with mouse nidogen sequences revealed 84% identity on the nucleotide level and 88% identity with the deduced amino acid sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence of the human cDNAs revealed the presence of cysteine-rich epidermal growth factor-like repeats and the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), a potential cell binding site, two features previously identified in mouse nidogen. The sequence Asn-Pro-Ser, a consensus sequence for N-linked glycosylation, was also noted. The newly isolated human cDNAs were utilized to analyze the expression of the nidogen gene by cultured human cells. Northern hybridizations revealed a single mRNA transcript of approximately 6.0 kb in human skin fibroblast and in HT 1080 fibrosarcoma cell cultures. However, the human choriocarcinoma cell line JEG-3, which expressed laminin genes, did not contain detectable levels of nidogen mRNAs. Quantitation of the relative nidogen mRNA abundance in HT 1080 fibrosarcoma cells indicated that nidogen mRNA levels were approximately the same as those for the laminin B2 chain. Finally, one of the nidogen cDNAs was used to map the nidogen gene onto locus q43 of chromosome 1.
