The production and germination of asexual spores in a diverse group of fungi play a crucial role in their infection cycles. These processes are regulated by a set of genes, namely, conidiation-related genes, involved in the production, morphological characteristics, and differentiation of conidia. In this study, we identified and characterized the PsCon1 gene, which is the first conidiation-related gene identified in Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). Sequence analysis revealed that PsCON1 has two conserved conidiation-specific protein 6 domains. Single nucleotide polymorphisms and insertion/deletion variations were detected in the coding region of PsCon1 among five Pst races. Quantitative RT-PCR assays revealed that PsCon1 was expressed at the highest level in resting urediospores of Pst, and gradually decreased after germination and infection. However, at 312â€‰hpi, at the stage of forming large amounts of urediospores on leaves, the amount of PsCon1 mRNA was sharply increased but only 0.1-fold that of resting urediospores. Subcellular localization assays indicated PsCon1 heterologously expressed in Fusarium graminearum was located in the cytoplasm of conidia. The results suggest that PsCon1 may play a role in formation or survival of Pst urediospores.
