The 16S rRNA gene from the Thermococcus New Zealand isolate AN1 was cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the gene revealed the presence of signature sequences, indicating that strain AN1 represents a new species of the genus Thermococcus. Since the isolate AN1 differed from other thermococci in both its lower optimal NaCl concentration and generally lower optimal temperature for growth, in its unusual lipid membrane composition, and in its sensitivity to antibiotics, we propose that strain AN1 represents a new species of Thermococcus. The proposed name is Thermococcus zilligii, and the type strain is DSM 2770.
