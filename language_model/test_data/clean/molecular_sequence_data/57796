Both small and large diameter of CARP immunoreactive neurons could be observed in the different ganglia of CNS of Helix but not in the foot musculature. The immunoreactivity is the strongest in the varicose segments of immunoreactive fibers. The present findings suggest a transmitter or modulatory role of CARP in both central and peripheral regulatory processes.
