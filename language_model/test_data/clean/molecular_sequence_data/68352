The PEL1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is essential for the cell viability of mitochondrial petite mutants, for the ability to utilize glycerol and ethanol on synthetic medium, and for cell growth at higher temperatures. By tetrad analysis the gene was assigned to chromosome III, centromere proximal of LEU2. The PEL1 gene has been isolated and cloned by the complementation of a pel1 mutation. The molecular analysis of the chromosomal insert carrying PEL1 revealed that this gene corresponds to the YCL4W open reading frame on the complete DNA sequence of chromosome III. The putative Pel1 protein is characterized by a low molecular weight of approximately 17 kDa, a low codon adaptation index, and a high leucine content.
