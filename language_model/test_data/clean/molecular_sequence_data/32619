DFprot is a web-based server for predicting main-chain deformability from a single protein conformation. The server automatically performs a normal-mode analysis (NMA) of the uploaded structure and calculates its capability to deform at each of its residues. Non-specialists can easily and rapidly obtain a quantitative first approximation of the flexibility of their structures with a simple and efficient interface.
