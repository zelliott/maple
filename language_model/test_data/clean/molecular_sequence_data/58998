We have isolated a novel human cDNA that encodes a protein highly homologous to NHP2, a nuclear protein of yeast, that is thought to have an essential physiological function for cell viability. The 1,493-bp cDNA sequence includes an open reading frame of 384 bp. This gene (NHP2L1) was expressed in all human tissues examined, and was localized to chromosome hand 12q24.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
