The nucleotide sequence of the sulfate and thiosulfate transport gene cluster has been determined and located 3' to the gene (cysP) encoding the thiosulfate-binding protein. Four open reading frames, designated cysT, cysW, cysA, and cysM, have been identified. Similarities in primary structure were observed between (i) the deduced amino acid sequences of CysT and CysW with membrane-bound components of other binding protein-dependent transport systems, (ii) that of the CysA sequence with the "conserved" component of such systems, and (iii) that of the CysM sequence with O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase A (cysK gene product) and the beta-subunit of tryptophan synthase (coded by trpB). Expression of the four genes was analyzed in the T7 promoter-polymerase system.
