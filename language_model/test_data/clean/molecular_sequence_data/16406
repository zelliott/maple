Present work reported the cloning and characterization of a human novel RNA binding gene Partner of NOB1 (PNO1), with a length of 1637bp and a putative open reading frame of 759 bp, isolated from human kidney. It is composed of seven exons and is localized on chromosome 2p14. Western blot showed that the molecular weight of PNO1 is about 35kDa. RT-PCR results in 16 human tissues indicated that PNO1 is expressed mainly in liver, lung, spleen and kidney, slightly in thymus, testis, ovary, respectively, but not in heart, brain, skeletal muscle, placenta, pancreas, prostate, small intestine, colon and peripheral blood leukocytes. GFP fusion expression in mammalian cells exhibited its localization in the nucleus, especially in nucleoli. Subcellular localization of thirteen GFP fusion PNO1 deletion proteins showed that the region of 92-230 aa is solely responsible for its nucleolar retention, and KH domain alone is not sufficient for nucleolar retention. The PNO1 family shows significant conservation in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
