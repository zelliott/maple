An important unsolved question regarding the bacterial SsrA system is the fate of target mRNAs replaced by SsrA RNA during trans-translation. The aim of the present study is to address the potential role of SsrA system in mRNA quality control, focusing on truncated mRNAs that are expected to arise from 3'-to-5' exonucleolytic attack. We found that significant amounts of truncated mRNAs and polypeptides were produced from genes lacking a rho-independent terminator in SsrA-deficient cells. These truncated mRNAs, hence truncated polypeptides, were no longer observed in the presence of SsrA RNA. The data indicate that the SsrA system facilitates degradation of "nonstop" mRNAs by presumably removing the stalled ribosomes. Furthermore, analysis of affinity-purified proteins indicated that truncated polypeptides could be produced even from a gene with an intact rho-independent terminator, although less efficiently, implying that C-terminally truncated proteins and 3'-truncated mRNA may be produced from virtually all protein-coding genes. We conclude that the SsrA system not only promotes the degradation of incomplete polypeptides but also minimizes the synthesis of incomplete polypeptides by facilitating the degradation of truncated mRNAs that are produced in cells.
