A small cryptic plasmid designated pPB1 was isolated from Lactobacillus plantarum BIFI-38 and its complete 2899 bp nucleotide sequence was determined. Sequence analysis revealed four putative open reading frames. Based on sequence analysis two modules could be identified. First, the replication module consisted of a sequence coding for a replication protein (RepB) and its corresponding target site, and two putative repressor proteins (RepA and RepC). Sequence analysis indicated the possible synthesis of an antisense RNA that might regulate RepB production. A putative lagging-strand initiation site was also found, suggesting that pPB1 replicates via a rolling circle mechanism. The second module of pPB1 consisted of a sequence coding for a putative mobilization protein and its corresponding oriT site. Since the nucleotide sequence of the replication module showed 94.5% identity to the similar region on the Leuconostoc lactis plasmid pCI411, and the nucleotide sequence of the mobilization module had 97.5% identity to L. plantarum plasmid pLB4, it is concluded that pPB1 originated by modular exchange between two such plasmids by homologous recombination. Putative recombination sites where crossover might have taken place were also identified.
