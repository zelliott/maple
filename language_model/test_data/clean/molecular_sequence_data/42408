In human epidermis, expression of CD1a is confined to Langerhans cells (LC), whereas CD1c expression has been observed in dendritic cells of the dermis, as well as the epidermis. In transfected fibroblasts, expression of CD1c at the cell surface appears to exclude expression of either CD1b or CD1a, despite continued transcription of the latter genes. In order to determine whether this mechanism might be operative in human skin, we have compared the expression of CD1a and CD1c on the surface of dermal and epidermal dendritic cells to their expression at the level of mRNA using a combination of dual-label immunofluorescence microscopy, northern blot hybridization, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). By both immunofluorescence and Northern blotting, CD1c expression was observed in both dermal and epidermal cells, whereas expression of CD1a was confined largely to the epidermis. Moreover, as shown by immunomagnetic bead selection and RT-PCR, CD1a and CD1c were both expressed on epidermal LC, but were absent from other epidermal cell types. These results argue against cell surface exclusion as a mechanism for selective expression of CD1c in human dermis.
