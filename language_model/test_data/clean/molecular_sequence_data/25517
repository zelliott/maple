The negative regulatory genes, PHO80 and PHO85, involved in transcriptional regulation of the yeast repressible acid-phosphatase-encoding gene, PHO5, have been cloned. Expression of PHO80 and PHO85 has been studied by means of lacZ fusions. We show here that these expressions are inorganic phosphate (Pi) independent and that they are controlled by the PHO80 gene product; moreover, PHO80 expression is controlled by PHO85. We also present genetic evidence for an interaction between the PHO80 and PHO85 proteins: increased PHO85 gene dosage partially compensates for the pho80-1 mutation and this effect is allele-specific. The pho80-1 allele has been cloned and sequenced. The mutation changes Gly229 to Asp. This region was shown to be essential for PHO80 function by C-terminal deletion analysis.
