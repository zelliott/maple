The occurrence and nature of repeated DNA sequences has been analysed within an 850 kb YAC contig on Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 4. Hybridization analysis with seven RFLP markers, six cosmid contigs, 29 YAC end probes and eight YAC clones showed that a least 585 kb of the 850 kb contained only low-copy sequences. One YAC end probe, EG15C8LE, hybridized to multiple genomic fragments and contained a sequence with predicted protein homology to cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. Another one, EG11B7RE, was found to be non-contiguous with the other YAC clones and contained a dispersed repetitive sequence associated with centromeric regions.
