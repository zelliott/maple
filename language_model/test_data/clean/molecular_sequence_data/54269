We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of Stenodactylus geckos using mitochondrial and three nuclear genes in order to understand the divergence within this genus. Stenodactylus is a complex with deep divergences that date to at least the Miocene; these patterns are seen in several other complexes in this region, indicating important and shared biogeographic processes affecting several taxonomic groups. Divergence between disjunct populations from three species in the Arabian Peninsula may have arisen because of Pliocene and Pleistocene restructuring of sand dunes. As currently recognized, Stenodactylus is not a monophyletic genus with respect to Tropiocolotes. We resurrect the monotypic genus Pseudoceramodactylus to address this problem of monophyly.
