The nucleotide sequence of human Go alpha was determined from a partial human brain cDNA clone and the sequence of the first two 5' coding exons of a human genomic Go alpha clone. Comparison of this sequence with bovine and rat Go alpha shows greater than 90% homology at the nucleotide and deduced amino acid level. There is 100% identity at the amino acid level for the cholera and pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP ribosylation sites, the putative guanine nucleotide binding, and the GTP hydrolysis sites.
