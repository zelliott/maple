Using conserved primers and the PCR reaction, the growth hormone (GH) gene and the 3'-UTR of the large yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea) were amplified and sequenced. The gene structure was analyzed and compared to the GH genes of 5 other percoid fish downloaded from Genbank. Also the GH gene of the large yellow croaker and the genes from 14 Percoidei and 2 Labroidei species were aligned using Clustal X. A matrix of 564 bp was used to construct the phylogenetic tree using maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining methods. Phylogenetic trees by the two methods are identical in most of the clades with high bootstrap support. The results are also identical to those from morphological data. In general, this analysis does not support the monophyll of the families Centropomidae and Carangidae. But our GH gene tree indicates that the representative species of the families Sparidae and Sciaenidae are a monophyletic group.
