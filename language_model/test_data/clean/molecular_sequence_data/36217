The formation of histamine from its precursor histidine is catalyzed by histidine decarboxylase (HDC), a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent decarboxylase. The knowledge of sequence similarities between various rodent HDCs permitted us to prepare a rat brain HDC cDNA probe. After reverse transcription of rat brain polyA + mRNA, the HDC cDNA obtained was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using two specific primers. The resulting 1019-bp DNA was cloned in the p-MAL vector. Its sequence corresponds to the published data on rat fetal liver HDC. This 1019-bp rat probe detected two BamHI sequences in man; these were assigned to chromosome 15 by somatic hybrid cell analysis. According to the well-known homology between human chromosome 15 and mouse chromosome 2, the result obtained is in agreement with the published localization of HDC on mouse chromosome 2. The mapping of the human HDC gene on chromosome 15 is an original contribution to the chromosomal assignment of related PLP-dependent decarboxylases.
