The identification of proteins mediating Ras effects, such as the serine/threonine kinases of the Raf family, has advanced our understanding of how signals are transmitted from the extracellular milieu to the nucleus. The modified two-hybrid system has proved to be a powerful tool for identifying specific protein interactions, such as those between Ras and Raf. We hope that the insight gained from the Ras screen, as well as insights from other two hybrid screens, will prove valuable in the application of this system to other enigmatic questions in biology.
