We have isolated and sequenced cDNA clones encoding the poly(A)-binding protein of Xenopus laevis oocytes. Polyclonal antiserum was raised against a fusion protein encoding 185 amino acids of the Xenopus poly(A)-binding protein. This antiserum localizes the poly(A)-binding protein to subcellular sites associated with protein synthesis; in the retina, immunoreactive protein is detected in the synthetically active inner segment of the photoreceptor but not in the transductive outer segment. Transcripts encoding the poly(A)-binding protein are present in oocytes, although no protein is detected on protein blots. In contrast, the levels of both transcripts and protein increase in development, which correlates with the observed increase in total poly(A) during Xenopus embryogenesis (N. Sagata, K. Shiokawa, and K. Yamana, Dev. Biol. 77:431-448, 1980).
