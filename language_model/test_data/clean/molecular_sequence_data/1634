In the current study, a group of 17 "Aeromonas eucrenophila-like" isolates from clinical and environmental origins was subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic characterization including ribotyping, 16S rDNA sequencing, FAFLP fingerprinting, and biochemical testing. Genotypic, phylogenetic, and phenotypic results were consistent with the conclusion that this group of 17 isolates may represent a currently undescribed Aeromonas taxon most closely related to A. eucrenophila HG6. In addition, comparison of newly obtained 16S rDNA sequencing data with published sequences demonstrated a high phylogenetic heterogeneity among isolates currently classified in the species A. encheleia.
