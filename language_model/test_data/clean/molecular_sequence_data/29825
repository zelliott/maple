Theileria buffeli, generally a benign parasite of cattle, has been reported in animals from Texas, Missouri and North Carolina. To date, there have been no reports of the parasite in cattle residing in northern portions of the US. An 8-year-old cow (Maine Anjou x Angus cross-bred) in Michigan presented with hemoglobinuria and a packed cell volume of 9. Blood films stained with Giemsa showed numerous intraerythrocytic parasites morphologically consistent with T. buffeli. The parasite was confirmed to be T. buffeli by SSU rRNA gene sequence analysis (SSU rRNA sequence, Type A). This represents the first report of this parasite in an animal in Michigan.
