Recently, isolates of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) that possess nucleotide sequences similar to European isolates have been reported in United States herds. The origin, diversity and prevalence of European-like North American PRRSV isolates in the U.S. remain unknown. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 12kb ORF1 of a North American isolate, SDPRRS 01-08 (01-08), showed 93.7% identity with Lelystad virus (LV), the prototypic European isolate, but only 58% identity with VR-2332, the prototypic North American isolate. Comparisons between LV and 01-08 at the peptide sequence level of the predicted non-structural proteins (Nsp) showed that Nsp9 (98.9% amino acid identity) was the most conserved and the least conserved was Nsp2 at 90.6% identity. For the purpose of comparison, GP5, the principal envelope structural protein, showed a 93.5% identity between 01-08 and LV. The most dramatic differences between the Nsp2 proteins of LV and 01-08 were a single 17 amino acid deletion between residues 734 and 750, as well as several amino acid differences. The same deletion was identified in the Nsp2 in five of seven other EuroPRRSV isolates submitted to the South Dakota Animal Disease Research and Diagnostic Laboratory. The remaining two isolates contained small deletions, but in other regions of Nsp2. Peptide sequence diversity in the form of hypervariability and deletions in Nsp2 demonstrate that European-like PRRSV isolates in the USA represent a heterogeneous group. Furthermore, areas in Nsp2 with deletions and amino acid hypervariability localize to regions that are predicted to be immunologically important.
