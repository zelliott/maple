The neuron-specific K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter KCC2 plays a crucial role in determining intracellular chloride activity and thus the neuronal response to gamma-aminobutyric acid and glycine. Of the four KCCs, KCC2 is unique in mediating constitutive K(+)-Cl(-) cotransport under isotonic conditions; the other three KCCs are exclusively swelling-activated, with no isotonic activity. We have utilized a series of chimeric cDNAs to localize the determinant of isotonic transport in KCC2. Two generations of chimeric KCC4-KCC2 cDNAs initially localized this characteristic to within a KCC2-specific expansion of the cytoplasmic C terminus, between residues 929 and 1043. This region of KCC2 is rich in prolines, serines, and charged residues and encompasses two predicted PEST sequences. Substitution of this region in KCC2 with the equivalent sequence of KCC4 resulted in a chimeric KCC that was devoid of isotonic activity, with intact swelling-activated transport. A third generation of chimeras demonstrated that a domain just distal to the PEST sequences confers isotonic transport on KCC4. Mutagenesis of this region revealed that residues 1021-1035 of KCC2 are sufficient for isotonic transport. Swelling-activated K(+)-Cl(-) cotransport is abrogated by calyculin A, whereas isotonic transport mediated by KCC chimeras and KCC2 is completely resistant to this serine-threonine phosphatase inhibitor. In summary, a 15-residue C-terminal domain in KCC2 is both necessary and sufficient for constitutive K(+)-Cl(-) cotransport under isotonic conditions. Furthermore, unlike swelling-activated transport, constitutive K(+)-Cl(-) cotransport mediated by KCC2 is completely independent of serine-threonine phosphatase activity, suggesting that these two modes of transport are activated by distinct mechanisms.
