We report the isolation of the mouse Kin17 gene, located on chromosome 2, coding a nuclear Zn-finger protein that has a 39-residue region homologous to Escherichia coli RecA protein and that is recognized by anti-RecA antibodies. Kin17 protein preferentially binds to curved DNA in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a role in illegitimate recombination and in regulation of gene expression. We have shown that the Kin17 gene is about 8 kb in length and displays three exons and two introns. The 5' flanking region lacks a canonical TATAA box but presents several putative regulatory domains. A major transcription initiation site is located 322 nucleotides upstream of the translation start site. The 1.7-kb transcript of the Kin17 gene is weakly and ubiquitously expressed in murine tissues and cell lines as determined by Northern analysis. The cross-hybridization of Kin17 cDNA with the genomic DNA of other species in Southern analysis indicates the conservation of the gene among mammals and suggests that the Kin17 gene plays a conserved role in DNA metabolism.
