Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) is a neurodegenerative disorder in humans and animals. Polymorphisms and mutations in the prion protein (PRNP) gene have been associated with the incidence of natural and experimental TSE and the incubation period length. In this study, we determined PRNP polymorphisms in Chinese ovine, caprine and bovine breeds using 400 samples from 13 ovine and caprine breeds and 250 samples from nine bovine breeds. In the ovine and caprine PRNP gene, we found five previously unreported amino acid polymorphisms and two silent nucleotide alterations. In bovine PRNP, we found eight previously unreported amino acid polymorphisms and six silent nucleotide alterations.
