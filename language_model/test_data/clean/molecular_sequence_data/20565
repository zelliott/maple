Previously, we have established an epsilon library and selected out a series of RNA aptamers with higher affinity to P protein based on the in vitro Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) in duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) system. In order to study the structural elements within the epsilon that is essential for initiating priming of HBV reverse transcriptase (P protein), all selected aptamers were subjected to in vitro priming assay and RNA secondary structure probing. We found that all those aptamers supporting priming had an undamaged bulge, while those lacking of the bulge no more support priming. Our results suggest an undamaged bulge within Depsilon is indispensable for initiating priming of P protein.
