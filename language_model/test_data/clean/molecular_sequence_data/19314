Two moderately halophilic strains, SL014B-69(T) and SL014B-62A2, were isolated from a saline soil contaminated with crude oil in Gudao in the coastal Shengli oilfield in China; the isolates were Gram-negative, rod-shaped and carried lateral flagella. Growth occurred at NaCl concentrations of 1-20 % (w/v), at temperatures of 10-42 degrees C and at pH 8.0-9.0. Strain SL014B-69(T) had C(18 : 1)omega7c (28.61 %), C(19 : 1) cyclo omega7c (27.97 %), C(16 : 0) (19.66 %) and C(12 : 0) 3-OH (8.87 %) as the predominant fatty acids and Q9 as the major ubiquinone, with the G+C content of genomic DNA being 64.0 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the two strains belonged to genus of Halomonas in the Gammaproteobacteria, with the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 96.4 % with Halomonas campisalis ATCC 700597(T) and 96.0 % with Halomonas desiderata FB2(T). DNA-DNA relatedness of strain SL014B-69(T) with strain SL014B-62A2, H. campisalis ATCC 700597(T) and H. desiderata DSM 9502(T) was 97.4, 42.9 and 36.8 %, respectively. On the basis of these data, a novel species of the genus Halomonas, Halomonas gudaonensis sp. nov., is proposed for strain SL014B-69(T) and SL014B-62A2. The type strain is SL014B-69(T) (=LMG 23610(T)=CGMCC 1.6133(T)).
