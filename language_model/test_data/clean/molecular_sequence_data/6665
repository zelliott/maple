A 66-kDa protein (p66) associated with the outer membrane of Lyme disease Borrelia was analysed at the molecular level. The chromosomal genes encoding p66 in B. burgdorferi B31, B. afzelii ACAI, and B. garinii Ip90 were sequenced. Database searches revealed that the p66 gene sequences were homologous to a previously reported gene fragment of unknown function. The deduced amino acid sequences of p66 in different Lyme disease borreliae were 92-94% identical and had no homologs in the databases. Proteolytic cleavage patterns of p66 and a computer-predicted single trans-membrane helix suggested the presence of surface-exposed epitopes on the C-terminus.
