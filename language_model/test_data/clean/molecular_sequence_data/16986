A humanized monoclonal antibody against parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) was generated from the mouse monoclonal antibody raised against the peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 34 amino acids of the human PTHrP [(PTHrP(1-34)]. The humanized antibody interacted with the PTHrP(1-34) with a kD value of 1.90 x 10(-10) M, and the epitope resides between the amino acids 20 and 30 of the PTHrP. PTHrP(1-34) significantly increased the intracellular cAMP levels in the rat osteosarcoma cells that expressed PTHR1, and the 5 microg/mL or higher concentrations of the humanized antibody almost completely blocked the PTHrP-induced cAMP production even in the presence of 2 microg/mL PTHrP(1-34), demonstrating its ability to fully neutralize PTHrP function. There was no significant difference in the potency of the mouse, chimera, or the humanized antibodies to suppress the PTHrP-induced increase in the intracellular cAMP in ROS cells. Furthermore, at the same doses, the administration of the chimera or the humanized antibody was equally effective in reducing the blood ionized calcium levels of hypercalcemic mice bearing the PAN-7-JCK human pancreatic cancer xenograft or the LC-6-JCK human lung cancer xenograft that secreted PTHrP. Thus, humanized anti-PTHrP may be useful for the treatment of the humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy in humans.
