The initiation of adaptive immune responses requires the direct interaction of dendritic cells (DCs) with naive T lymphocytes. It is well established that the maturation state of DCs has a critical impact on the outcome of the response. We show here that mature DCs form stable conjugates with naive T cells and induce the formation of organized immune synapses. Immature DCs, in contrast, form few stable conjugates with no organized immune synapses. A dynamic analysis revealed that mature DCs can form long-lasting interactions with naive T cells, even in the absence of Ag. Immature DCs, in contrast, established only short intermittent contacts, suggesting that the premature termination of the interaction prevents the formation of organized immune synapses and full T cell activation.
