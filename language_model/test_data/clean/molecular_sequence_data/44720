Peptomers are polymers composed of peptides that are specifically cross-linked in a head-to-tail fashion. Recently, a peptomer composed of an amphipathic peptide from the C4 domain of HIV-1MN gp120 was shown to display a prominent alpha-helical conformation that, as an immunogen, elicited rabbit antibodies recognizing native and recombinant gp120 [Robey et al. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 23918-23921]. For the present study, we synthesized a conjugate composed of the C4 peptomer covalently linked to calcinated aluminum oxide nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were first reacted with (3-aminopropy])-triethoxysilane to provide an amine load of 15.9 mmol of R-NH2/g of solid. The amine-modified aluminum oxide nanoparticles then were reacted with N-acetylhomocysteine thiolactone at pH 10 to place a reactive thiol on the nanoparticles. A bromoacetylated C4 peptomer, modified at the epsilon-amines of lysine residues, then was reacted with the thiolated nanoparticles to give the peptomer covalently linked to aluminum oxide via a thioether bond. The peptomer load was determined to be 16 mg of peptomer/g of particles, a 55% theoretical yield. Particle shape and size of the peptomer-conjugated alumina were analyzed by electron microscopy and displayed a mean maximum diameter of 355 nm and a mean minimum diameter of 113 nm, well within the desired size range of 300 nm believed to be optimal for mucosal immunization purposes. Experimentally determined values of mean particle diameters, specific surface area, and specific peptomer load provided the information necessary to calculate the mean antigen load, which was determined to be 53000 +/- 42000 peptomer epitopes per particle. Peptomer-alumina conjugates, such as that described here, could form the basis of a new class of biomaterial that combines a chemically defined organic immunogen with a nontoxic chemically defined inorganic adjuvant.
