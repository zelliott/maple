Fusarium is a filamentous fungus widely distributed in nature, which is an important opportunistic pathogen and could cause fusariosis both in plants and animals. In human, Fusarium could cause local and disseminated infections both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. We describe here a case of a male patient suffered from multiple organ injury, whose blood fungal culture was positive. The isolate was confirmed as "Fusarium solani" according to the morphology of the fungus and the results of phenotypic and molecular identification.
