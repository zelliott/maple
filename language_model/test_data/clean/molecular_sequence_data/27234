Autophagy is a conserved degradation pathway that is involved in the maintenance of normal cell differentiation and development. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATG5 gene is an important component of the autophagy process. In this study, we identified MgATG5 as an autophagy-related gene in Magnaporthe oryzae that is homologous to ATG5. Using targeted gene replacement, an Mgatg5Delta mutant was generated and fungal autophagy was blocked. Cytological analysis revealed that the mutant had poor fungal morphogenic development, including a shortened aerial hyphae lifespan, decreased conidiation and perithecia formation, delayed conidial germination and appressorial formation, postponement of conidial cytoplasm transfer during appressorium formation, and reduction in formation of the penetration peg. Turnover of endogenous matter in the Mgatg5 mutant was also affected, as demonstrated by defects in the formation of conidial lipid droplets, and in the degradation of conidial glycogen deposits during appressorium formation. Lipid droplets and glycogen are necessary to generate adequate turgor in appressoria for invading the host surface. As a result of the decreased appressorium turgor and differentiation in the penetration peg, Mgatg5Delta pathogenicity was deficient in two host plants tested. The developmental and pathogenic phenotypes were restored by the introduction of an intact copy of MgATG5 into Mgatg5Delta, demonstrating that the MgATG5 deletion was responsible for the cellular defects. Taken together, these findings suggest that autophagy promotes cell differentiation through turnover of endogenous matter during fungal development, and is thus essential for the pathogenicity of the rice blast fungus.
