The Escherichia coli prophage N15 exists as a linear DNA molecule with covalently closed ends. Purified N15 protelomerase TelN is the only protein required to convert circular DNA substrates to the linear form with hairpin termini. Within the center of the telomerase occupancy site tos, the target for TelN is the 56-bp telRL consisting of the central 22-bp palindrome telO and two 14-bp flanking inverted sequence repetitions. DNase I footprinting of TelN-telRL complexes shows a segment of approximately 50 bp protected by TelN. Surface plasmon resonance studies demonstrate that this extended footprint is caused by two TelN molecules bound to telRL. Stable TelN-target DNA complexes are achieved with telRL; however, the additional sequences of tos stabilize the TelN-target complexes. TelO alone is not sufficient for specific stable complex formation. However, processing can occur, i.e. generation of the linear covalently closed DNA. Within the context of telRL, sequences of telO are involved in specific TelN-telRL complex formation, in processing itself, and/or in recognition of the processing site. The sequence of the central (CG)(3) within telO that is part of a 14-bp stretch proposed to have Z-DNA conformation is essential for processing but not for formation of specific TelN-telRL complexes. The concerted action of both TelN molecules at the target site is the basis for telomere resolution. Capturing of reaction intermediates demonstrates that TelN binds covalently to the 3'-phosphoryl of the cleaved strands.
