Sequencing of the E5 open reading frame (ORF) of human papillomavirus type 16 revealed an additional nucleotide, a thymidine residue, at position 3903 compared with the original sequence (Seedorf et al., Virology 145:181-185, 1985). The additional T had two effects; first, in reading frame 2, in which the original E5 ORF was predicted, the additional T changed the reading frame downstream of position 3903 to create an ORF, which we designated E5, that terminated at position 4018 and potentially encoded a 52-amino-acid polypeptide. Secondly, in reading frame 3, a new ORF was created (positions 3807 to 4097), which we propose is the authentic papillomavirus type 16 E5 ORF. It contained a methionine residue and encoded an additional 82 amino acids. Both ORFs have been cloned into bacterial expression vectors (pATH), and the fusion proteins have been used to generate polyclonal antibodies in rabbits.
