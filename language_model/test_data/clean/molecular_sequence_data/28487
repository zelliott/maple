Proteomic methods are required for the study of many different aspects of plant function. Important issues in proteomics include the molecular complexity of proteins, given that there are hundreds of thousands of chemically and physically distinct proteins in plants, and the context of protein functions with respect to both genomes and the environment. Available genomic and gene sequences greatly simplify the identification of proteins using improved techniques of mass spectrometry. This improved capability has led to much discussion on proteomes, and some experimentation using proteomic methodologies aimed at modest numbers of proteins. The scale of proteomics is open, for the number of proteins and genes considered at any one time is as dependent on the nature of the scientific question posed as on technical resources and capabilities. We know just enough about plant proteomes to imagine the breathtaking scope of our ignorance. There are tremendous opportunities for new molecular biologists to define the nature of the protein machines that transduce genetic and environmental information, and transform simple energy and matter, to give plants.
