During B lymphopoiesis, cells undergo successive rounds of division and growth arrest coupled to intermittent selection on the basis of Ig expression. It is unresolved whether differentiation requires specific signaling or is merely the consequence of sustained cell survival. Transgenic expression of the cell death antagonist, Bcl-2, promoted accumulation of B lymphoid cells in mice deficient in antigen receptor rearrangement (scid or rag-1-/-) and in mice lacking the IgM transmembrane domain (microMT). Continued differentiation occurred, however, only in the bcl-2/scid and bcl-2/microMT mice. The appearance of B lineage cells expressing CD21, CD22 and CD23 was associated with DHJH rearrangements which encode a truncated C mu-containing protein called D mu in bcl-2/scid mice and with expression of Ig heavy chain classes other than IgM in the bcl-2/ microMT mice. In neither case, however, were proliferating cells observed in the more mature B lineage compartments in the bone marrow. Thus, continued B cell development requires signaling via Ig heavy chain-containing receptors and is not simply a consequence of blocking apoptosis.
