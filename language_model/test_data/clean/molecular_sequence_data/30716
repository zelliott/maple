The antagonistic effects of [D-Phe25]gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)(18-27) and [D-Arg1,D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P (SP) on the stimulation of insulin release by GRP(18-27) from isolated canine pancreas were compared with that of [Ala23]GRP(18-27). The stimulation of insulin release by 1 nM GRP(18-27) was reduced to 24.1% and 15.4% by the prior infusion of 1 microM of [D-Arg1,D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9,Leu11]SP and 10 microM of [D-Phe25]GRP(18-27), respectively. Glucagon release by GRP(18-27) was not affected by these peptides using the above concentrations. The results indicate that these peptides are antagonists of bombesin-like peptide receptors on pancreatic B-cells, although the inhibitory activities are lower than that of [Ala23]GRP(18-27).
