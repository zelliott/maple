Genes encoding pre-protein and prepro-protein of wheat germ agglutinin isolectin 2 (WGA2) were chemically synthesized and expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the control of the ENO1 promoter. Yeast harboring either a pre-WGA2 or a prepro-WGA2 gene expression plasmid secreted a mature form of WGA2 into the culture medium. The amount of WGA2 secreted by the strain KS58-2Ddel, which has a ssl1 mutation causing a supersecretion of human lysozyme [Suzuki, K., Ichikawa, K. & Jigami, Y. (1989) Mol. Gen. Genet. 219, 58-64], was 20-fold greater than that secreted by the wild-type strain KK4. The recombinant WGA2 from the cells containing the prepro-WGA2 gene expression plasmid was purified to homogeneity by a three-step ion-exchange chromatography scheme. As in wheat, the N-terminal signal peptide of recombinant WGA2 purified from yeast culture was processed to form an N-terminal 5-oxoprolyl (pyroglutamyl) residue. Likewise, we found that the C-terminal pro-region of recombinant WGA2 had also been processed in yeast. Using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, we found the processed C-terminus to be heterogeneous in both recombinant WGA2 purified from yeast and in authentic WGA2. The major component of the recombinant WGA2 contained two additional amino acids at its C-terminus compared to that of authentic WGA2. In spite of this difference in the C-terminus, the recombinant WGA2 exhibited a sugar binding activity that was indistinguishable from that of authentic WGA2.
