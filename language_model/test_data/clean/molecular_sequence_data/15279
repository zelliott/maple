We present a high-throughput method for investigating the transcriptional starting sites of genes of interest, which we named Deep-RACE (Deep-rapid amplification of cDNA ends). Taking advantage of the latest sequencing technology, it allows the parallel analysis of multiple genes and is free of time-consuming cloning steps. In comparison to the sequencing of RACE PCR products, our approach is more precise and more cost-effective even for batches as small as 17.
