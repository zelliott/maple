We isolated rockfish Sebastes schlegeli mitochondrial DNA by long-polymerase chain reaction (Long-PCR) with conserved primers, and sequenced it by primer walking using flanking sequences as sequencing primers. S. schlegeli mitochondrial DNA consists of 16,526 bp and its structural organization is conserved in comparison with other fish. Using mitochondrial control region sequences, we compared related species from the genus Sebastes (Scorpaeniformes, Scorpaenidae), showing the similarity of S. schlegeli isolated from Korean and Japanese waters. In this paper, we report the basic characteristics of the S. schlegeli mitochondrial genome including structural organization, base composition of rRNAs and the tRNAs and protein-encoding genes, and characteristics of mitochondrial tRNAs. These findings are applicable to aquaculture and to molecular phylogenetics in the genus Sebastes.
