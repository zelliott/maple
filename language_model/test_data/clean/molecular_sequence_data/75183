Exposure of the purified Ca2+ pump of human erythrocytes to chymotrypsin led to the rapid loss of calmodulin activation. A fragment of about 12 kDa was removed from the ATPase in 1-2 min. Blotting experiments with 125I-labeled calmodulin showed that this fragment contains the calmodulin binding region. The remainder of the ATPase molecule was degraded to a number of fragments ranging from 3 to 120 kDa; none of them bound calmodulin. To isolate the calmodulin binding domain, calmodulin which had been coupled to the Denny-Jaffe reagent (a cleavable radioactive photoaffinity cross-linker) was allowed to bind to the Ca2+ pump. After illumination to couple the cross-linker to the pump, the cleavable bond was split and the calmodulin removed, leaving the pump radioactively labeled. This pump was digested with chymotrypsin, and the products were separated by gel permeation chromatography. The only radioactive peak (migrating at about 12 kDa) was further purified on reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Amino acid analysis showed the fragment to have a minimal molecular mass of 12.4 kDa and to contain a single methionine. After attempts to sequence the peptide directly failed. CNBr digestion was carried out on the labeled ATPase, producing both soluble and insoluble labeled material. After reverse-phase HPLC purification of the soluble material, a single radioactive peak was collected. Its sequence was (Formula: see text). A portion of this peak was passed through a microcalmodulin column; it bound in the presence of Ca2+ and was eluted by EDTA, and by a mixture of EDTA and urea. Staphylococcal V8 protease digestion of the eluted peak produced the same sequence as shown above, but starting at Leu-2 and ending at Glu-32. Structural analysis of this peptide showed that it shares features with the calmodulin binding domains of other enzymes which are regulated by calmodulin.
