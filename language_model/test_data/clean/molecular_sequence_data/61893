Large-scale annotation of sets of proteins is a frequently occurring task in association with genome sequencing projects. Here, we present an automated platform for the functional annotation of large sets of protein sequences. Various bioinformatics tools are used to achieve a comprehensive description of protein sequences and to link these results to standard Gene Ontology descriptors for molecular function, biological processes and cellular components. Access to the annotation is provided via a web-interface and database queries. These interfaces allow to formulate proteome wide queries as well as the investigation of details of individual results. WILMA annotations of the proteomes of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Arabidopsis thaliana and Caenorhabditis elegans are accessible at http://www.came.sbg.ac.at/wilma/
