In the mouse, there is a large family of paralogous genes closely related to PRL. The objective of this report was to investigate the organization of the mouse PRL gene family locus. PRL family genes reside on chromosome 13 of the mouse genome. The PRL gene family members were localized to a series of overlapping bacterial artificial chromosome clones and arranged based on structural relationships. Additionally, several new members of the PRL gene family were identified. Placental lactogen I (PL-I) was found to be encoded by three closely related (>98% exon sequence identity) contiguous genes (termed: PL-Ialpha, PL-Ibeta, and PL-Igamma). Two previously unidentified mouse orthologs for members of the rat PRL family, PRL-like protein-I (PLP-I) and PLP-K were discovered, as were two new members of the PLP-C subfamily, PLP-Cgamma and PLP-Cdelta, and two new entirely unique members of the PRL family, PLP-N and PLP-O. Amino acid sequences predicted from the latter two genes most closely resembled proliferin-related protein. Each of the nine newly discovered genes is expressed in trophoblast cells of the mouse placenta in a gestationally specific pattern. In summary, elucidation of the mouse PRL gene family locus provides new insights into the expansion of the mouse PRL family and new tools for studying the genetics and biology of its members.
