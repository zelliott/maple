cDNA clones presumably containing a transforming gene were isolated from transformed NIH3T3 cells, which were obtained by the transfection of DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes of a familial adenomatous polyposis patient. Sequence analysis of the cDNA clones showed that the gene contained an activated B-raf, the 5' half of which was replaced by the human small nuclear ribonucleoprotein E protein gene and an unknown gene. A partial genomic physical map of the transforming gene was made on the basis of the physical map of the cDNA clones, indicating that rearrangements had occurred during the transfection. The human B-raf gene was shown to be located on chromosome 7 by Southern blotting analysis of rodent-human somatic cell hybrid DNA using the B-raf cDNA as a probe.
