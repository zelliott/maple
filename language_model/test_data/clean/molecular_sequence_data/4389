Prolyl oligopeptidase (EC 3.4.21.26, prolyl endopeptidase) cDNA from bovine brain was cloned by PCR, and the amplified fragment was used as a probe to screen the cDNA library from bovine brain. The obtained clone contained a 2.7 kb DNA fragment with an open reading frame of 2130 nucleotides, and encoded a protein of 710 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 80640 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence is 95, 94, 51 and 48% homologous to those of human T-cell, porcine brain, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Flavobacterium meningosepticum prolyl endopeptidases, respectively. The bovine brain prolyl endopeptidase-encoding cDNA was expressed using an expression vector bearing a tac promoter, with an approximate yield of 20 micrograms/ml of cell culture.
