Cortisol is one of the central hormones in osmoregulation in fish, especially in seawater adaptation. A cDNA of 453 bp was cloned from liver mRNA of freshwater-reared tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus), by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with primers designed for the hormone-binding domain of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) in mammals and rainbow trout. The sequence of PCR product has 83% homology to the trout GR at the nucleotide level and 92% at the amino acid level. The PCR product of tilapia showed highest homology (74% at the amino acid level) to GR among human steroid hormone receptors, including mineralocorticoid receptor. The length of the receptor mRNA of tilapia was about 6.5 kb as determined by Northern blot hybridization. The mRNA concentration in the gills was relatively higher among various organs, the highest concentration being observed in blood cells. Signal intensity of the receptor message in the gills was stronger in fish reared in freshwater than in those reared in seawater or in concentrated (160%) seawater. During early development of tilapia, the highest concentration of receptor mRNA in the total RNA extracted from the whole egg was found just after fertilization, and its concentration decreased steadily toward hatching. The absolute amount of receptor mRNA per egg increased gradually before the initiation of cortisol production by the embryo. When embryos were transferred from fresh water to seawater 2 days before hatching, no difference was observed in the signal intensity of the receptor mRNA among embryos after 1, 2 (the day of hatching), 4, and 7 days.
