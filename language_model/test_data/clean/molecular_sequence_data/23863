The proteasome is responsible for most intracellular protein degradation and is essential for cell survival. Previous research has shown that the proteasome can be inhibited by a number of oxidants, including 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). The present study demonstrates that HNE rapidly inhibits the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20S proteasome purified from liver. Subunits containing HNE-adducts were identified following 2D gel electrophoresis, Western immunoblotting, and analysis by MALDI-TOF MS. At a time when only the chymotrypsin-like activity was inhibited, the alpha 6/C2 subunit was uniquely modified. These results provide important molecular details regarding the catalytic site-specific inhibition of proteasome by HNE.
