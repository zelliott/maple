The phylum Acidobacteria is broadly represented in a variety of environments as reported during microbial molecular surveys. This study represents the first attempt to analyze the diversity of Acidobacteria in Roman Catacombs (Rome, Italy). Both 16S and 23S rRNA gene sequences were used to confirm the affiliation within different acidobacterial subgroups. The results showed Acidobacteria belonging to subgroups 3, 4, 6, 9, and 10 in the analyzed samples. The presence of acidobacterial sequences in biodeteriorating biofilms in Roman Catacombs suggest they could participate in this negative process, most likely in cooperation with other microbial groups.
