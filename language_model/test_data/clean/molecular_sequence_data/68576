Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology was employed to examine peripheral blood and synovial T cells in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for biased utilization of T cell receptor (TCR) variable region (V) genes. Oligonucleotide primers specific for individual TCR V beta gene families were used to amplify TCR gene products in a semiquantitative assay of their relative utilization in unselected T cell populations. Mean V beta expression in 24 RA peripheral blood samples was very similar to that in a panel of 15 normal subjects, except for a slight decrease in V beta 13.2 expression. V beta utilization in 8 RA synovial tissue samples and 13 synovial fluid samples was compared to simultaneously obtained blood samples. Although heterogeneous patterns of skewed V beta utilization were observed, several significant trends emerged. By a number of approaches to data analysis, a statistically significant increase in expression of V beta 6 and V beta 15 in synovial T cells was documented. In addition, increased synovial expression of V beta 14 was found, but only in the synovial fluid samples. Reduced expression of V beta 1, V beta 4, V beta 5.1, V beta 10, V beta 16, and V beta 19 was also observed in synovial T cells. These results indicate that biased V beta gene utilization in different peripheral compartments of RA patients can be observed in unselected T cell populations, and are consistent with the conclusion that populations of T cells expressing these V beta gene products may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.
