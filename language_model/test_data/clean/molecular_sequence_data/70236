Most genes in the germline genome of hypotrichous ciliates are crippled by the presence of interrupting sequences. Some genes are additionally impaired because their sequences are in disorder. These gene defects are corrected when germline chromosomal DNA sequences are amplified, cut, spliced, reordered, and eliminated to produce somatic DNA.
