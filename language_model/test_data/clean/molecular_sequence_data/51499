The nine tandem zinc finger repeats in the 5S gene-specific transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA) from Xenopus mediate specific binding to 5S DNA as well as to 5S ribosomal RNA. A comparative functional analysis of a systematic set of TFIIIA zinc finger combinations reveals that most, if not all, participate in both DNA and RNA binding. Minimal sets of fingers sufficient for DNA and RNA recognition are different. In RNA binding, most finger elements are found to be functionally equivalent. However, the nonessential finger 6 exhibits RNA binding characteristics distinct from the other eight modules. The secondary/tertiary structure of the central domain in 5S RNA, not its primary sequence, is found to carry the essential structural information for TFIIIA binding in Xenopus oocytes. Taken together, our findings suggest that RNA and DNA binding are overlapping, though separable functions of the nine zinc finger elements in TFIIIA, occurring via fundamentally different molecular mechanisms.
