Monoclonal and conventional antibodies against the 'self' decapeptide LHRH produced by azo-LHRH-TT and azo-LHRH-BSA conjugates were studied for immunoreactivity with native LHRH, azo-LHRH, LHRH (OH) and its fragments of sequence 1-10, 7-10, 4-10 and 4-6. The CoAb reacted 8-20% to azo-LHRH, 2-6% to LHRH-Lys, 1-3% LHRH-LYS-MDP and 0.5-1.68% to LHRH-Ala-Ala-Tuftsin but failed to react to LHRH free acid and its fragments. On the other hand MoAb reacted 4-6% to azo-LHRH and 10-18% to LHRH-Lys, 3-5% to LHRH-Ala-Ala-Tuftsin. These results indicate that the azotization drastically inhibited immunoreactivity but that the azo-LHRH-carrier conjugate preserved the immunogenic epitope responsible for the induction of an effective anti-LHRH antibody response.
