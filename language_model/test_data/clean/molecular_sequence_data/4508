The complete sequence of the bovine butyrophilin gene (BTN) is described and compared with the mouse gene (Btn). Both genes contain seven exons separated by six introns, and the organisation of exons is closely associated with structural domains of the protein. Individual exons of BTN and Btn are 68-87% similar in sequence. There are no canonical TATA or CCAAT boxes associated with the transcription initiation sites in the genes of either species. However, a number of potential binding sites for transcription factors were identified in the 5'-flanking DNA, some of which may function in regulating expression of the gene in mammary tissue. Conservation of a 110-bp region in the promoters of BTN and Btn may have some functional significance. Cloning and sequencing of BTN provides an additional mammary-specific gene promoter that may be used for driving the expression of transgenes in the lactating mammary gland, and for determining the basis for tissue-specific gene expression. In addition, the sequence of BTN may be used to map intragenic polymorphisms and identify quantitative trait loci in commercial livestock.
