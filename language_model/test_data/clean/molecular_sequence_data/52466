Fibronectin (FN) plays a key role in cell attachment, embryonic development, and wound healing. In this respect, it is known that FN promotes keratinocyte migration. The aim of this study was to examine specific FN domains (120-kD cell-binding fragment, 45-kD collagen fragment, and 40-kD heparin fragment) and a biologically active peptide within the molecule (RGDS) for their ability to influence human keratinocyte (HK) locomotion. HKs were plated on gold salts coated with different substrates (type IV collagen, FN with or without the RGDS peptide, and the three FN fragments). After 20 h, locomotion tracks were quantified by computer-assisted image analysis that determines the area of each microscopic field occupied by migration tracks, a so-called migration index (MI). MIs on type IV collagen and FN were 39.14 +/- 2.8% and 30 +/- 0.4%, respectively. The maximal MIs on the collagen-binding domain and heparin-binding domain of FN were similar to our negative controls (plastic and albumin): 3 +/- 1%. In contrast, the maximal MI on the cell-binding fragment of FN was 18.45 +/- 2.1%. The effect of the cell-binding domain on keratinocyte motility was found to be dose dependent. Moreover, we could specifically inhibit the FN-driven locomotion using the RGDS sequence contained in the cell-binding fragment. We did not observe a synergistic effect (i.e., a higher MI) when we added the three fragments in a same dish. These results suggest i) that the cell-binding fragment of FN partially supports HK locomotion, ii) that other untested FN domain(s) should act in synergy with the cell-binding fragment to promote keratinocyte locomotion, or alternatively iii) that the FN function of promoting cell migration resides within the FN cell-binding domain, but the proper presentation of this domain to the cell requires an intact, native FN molecule, and iv) that the RGDS sequence is essential for HK movement.
