Bacteria belonging to the Staphylococcus genus reside in various natural environments; however, only disease-associated Staphylococcus strains have received attention while ecological function and physiologies of non-pathogenic strains were often neglected. Because high level of tolerance against NaCl is a common trait of Staphylococcus, we investigated the characteristics of halotolerance in Staphylococcus sp. OJ82 isolated from fermented seafood containing a high concentration of NaCl. Among the 292 isolates screened, OJ82 showed the highest β-galactosidase and extracellular protease activities under high-salt conditions. Comparative genomic analysis with other Staphylococcus strains showed that (a) replication origins are highly conserved, (b) the OJ82 strain has a high number of amino acid transport- and metabolism-related genes, and (c) OJ82 has many unique proteins (15 %) and 12 prophage-related genomic islands. RNA-seq analysis under high-salt conditions showed that genes involved in cell membranes, transport, osmotic stress, ATP synthesis, and translation are highly expressed. OJ82 may use the ribulose monophosphate pathway to detoxify some toxic intermediates under high-salt conditions. Six new and three known non-coding small RNAs of the OJ82 strain were also found in the RNA-seq analysis. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses identified target β-galactosidase and extracellular protease. Interestingly, the OJ82 strain became resistant to bacteriocin produced by the Bacillus strain only under high-salt conditions. Our data showed that the OJ82 strain adapted to high-salt conditions by expressing core cellular processes (translation, ATP production) and defense genes (membrane synthesis, compatible solute transports, ribulose monophosphate pathway) could survive bacteriocin exposure under high-salt conditions.
