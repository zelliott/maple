Grapevine virus B (GVB) has been found associated with corky bark-diseased vines. Although the sequence of a 7.6-kb cDNA clone from a GVB isolate from Italy has been described, striking differences in sequences between GVB isolates prompted us to construct an additional full-length GVB clone from the isolate 94/971 and to determine its complete sequence. The cDNA of GVB 94/971 shared a nucleotide sequence identity of only 77% with the GVB isolate from Italy. The cDNA of GVB 94/971 was infectious on Nicotiana plants as demonstrated by symptoms and by means of Northern blot, Western blot and electron microscopic analyses.
