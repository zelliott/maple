Chloroplast DNA sequences and microsatellites are useful tools for phylogenetic as well as population genetic analyses of plants. Chloroplast microsatellites tend to be less variable than nuclear microsatellites and therefore they may not be as powerful as nuclear microsatellites for within-species population analysis. However, chloroplast microsatellites may be useful for phylogenetic analysis between closely related taxa when more conventional loci, such as ITS or chloroplast sequence data, are not variable enough to resolve phylogenetic relationships in all clades. To determine the limits of chloroplast microsatellites as tools in phylogenetic analyses, we need to understand their evolution. Thus, we examined and compared phylogenetic relationships of species within the genus Clusia, using both chloroplast sequence data and variation at seven chloroplast microsatellite loci. Neither ITS nor chloroplast sequences were variable enough to resolve relationships within some sections of the genus, yet chloroplast microsatellite loci were too variable to provide any useful phylogenetic information. Size homoplasy was apparent, caused by base substitutions within the microsatellite, base substitutions in the flanking regions, indels in the flanking regions, multiple microsatellites within a fragment, and forward/reverse mutations of repeat length resulting in microsatellites of identical base composition that were not identical by descent.
