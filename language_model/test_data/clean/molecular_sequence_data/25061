The loss of one copy of two 9-bp repeats in mtDNA non-coding region V is often found in Asia and Pacific populations. Two hundred and ten samples from Rongcheng county, Shandong province were detected with the deletion frequency of 12.4%. A distribution map of frequencies of mtDNA 9-bp deletion among Asian and Pacific population was made with reference to other published data. Further discussion was made for the hypotheses of affinity and original model of those populations. PCR-RFLP was conducted to obtain the mtDNA polymorphism information in five other mtDNA regions except the 9-bp deletion in 95 samples. Twenty-seven different mtDNA haplotypes were found, and the relationships among these haplotypes have been analyzed by using MEGA2.0 and PHYLIP 3.57. Two new RFLP sites caused by point mutation were also found, which have not been reported in Chinese populations.
