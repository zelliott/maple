The gene of ribosomal protein S8 from the extreme thermophile Thermus thermophilus was expressed in E. coli using the strain BL21(DE3) and vector pET3-1. A method of isolating this protein from the super producing strain was developed, which makes it possible to obtain 8-12 mg of product from 11 of culture. The secondary structure of protein S8 was determined by using CD spectroscopy. The protein was shown to be highly resistant to denaturants.
