The release of peptides immunoreactive for a synthetic peptide (V-9-M) contained in the amino-terminal of pro-CCK was examined. The potassium-evoked release of V-9-M immunoreactive peptides from rat cerebral cortical slices in vitro was calcium dependent. Cholecystokinin-secreting rat medullary thyroid carcinoma cells also secreted significant quantities of these peptides. Sephadex column chromatography of the release media from slices and cells showed two V-9-M immunoreactive peptides, one larger and one smaller than V-9-M itself. Previous behavioral studies have suggested that V-9-M has a distinct neuropharmacological profile. These results demonstrate that V-9-M-like peptides are released along with CCK-8 and are consistent with the hypothesis that V-9-M-like peptides may be neurotransmitters or neuromodulators or may be involved in the sorting or transport of CCK-8.
