1. This gene completely lacks the intervening sequences. 2. This gene is truncated at the 5' end peptide encoding region by 433 base pairs (bp). 3. The 502 bp of this gene containing poly(A) signal are completely identical to the 3' half of mRNA encoding region of functional gene. 4. This gene has a poly(A) tail and is flanked by direct repeat of 6 bp. 5. Here we report for the first time the complete sequence of a human pseudogene for phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase and this is the first report of cloning of pseudogene for catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes.
