The Candida glabrata (Cg) TRP1 and HIS3 genes have been isolated by complementation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) trp1 and his3 mutants, respectively. Cg TRP1 encodes a polypeptide of 217 amino acids (aa), whose aa sequence is 58% identical to that of Sc TRP1. Cg HIS3 encodes a polypeptide of 210 aa, whose aa sequence is 73% identical to that of the Sc HIS3. Both Cg TRP1 and HIS3 were disrupted by sequential integrative transformation where the Sc URA3 was used as a selection marker for transformation. The resulting auxotrophic strain of his3- and trp1- was used to examine the ability of the Sc genes to complement the Cg mutations; Sc HIS3 and TRP1 complemented the Cg his3- and trp1- mutations, respectively.
