We have identified a simple tandem repeat DNA polymorphism in the human glycogen synthase gene of the form (TG)n. This DNA polymorphism has 10 alleles and a heterozygosity of 0.82 and can be easily typed using the polymerase chain reaction. It has been localized within the framework genetic map of chromosome 19 and is located in the region of the apolipoprotein C-II and histidine-rich calcium-binding protein genes. This DNA polymorphism will facilitate genetic studies of the role of the glycogen synthase gene in the development of insulin resistance and NIDDM.
