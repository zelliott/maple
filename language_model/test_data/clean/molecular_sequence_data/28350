The isolation of yeast centromeres has provided the opportunity to describe the molecular structure of chromosome attachments to the mitotic spindle. Nucleolytic probes of chromatin structure and construction of conditional mutants in centromere function have been used to study the regulation and assembly of centromeres throughout the cell cycle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
