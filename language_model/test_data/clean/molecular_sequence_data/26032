A 1330 base-pair fragment of a 16S rRNA gene has been amplified, cloned and sequenced. Comparison to other 16S rRNA sequences of eubacteria showed that P. niger represents a deep branch within the subdivision "Gram-positive with Gram-negative cell walls". It is not related to peptostreptococci, representatives of this genus studied so far are more closely related to clostridia.
