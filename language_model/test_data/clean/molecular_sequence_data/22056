Stoichiometric targeting and site-specific cleavage of HIV RRE RNA is demonstrated under physiologically relevant conditions by use of a metallopeptide that combines a specific RNA recognition sequence with a metal binding domain. Mass spectrometric analysis of cleavage products following treatment of target RNA with the metallopeptide, ascorbate, and dioxygen are consistent with C-1'H or C-4'H oxidative cleavage paths with an apparent second-order rate constant k2 approximately 700 M-1 min-1.
