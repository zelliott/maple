BTB/POZ protein family plays a key role in many biological processes both in Drosophila and vertebrates through regulating the transcriptional activities of some downstream genes. Here, we obtained a novel member of human BTB/POZ protein family, named as ZBTB34 (Zinc finger and BTB domain containing 34), which encodes 504 amino acid residues with a BTB/POZ domain at its N-terminus that is similar to the same domain of other known transcription regulators. RT-PCR analysis indicated that ZBTB34 was expressed ubiquitously in most adult human tissues, and whilst immunofluorescence assays showed that ZBTB34 was mainly localized to nucleus. Interestingly, the reporter assay in mammalian cells suggested that ZBTB34 might function as a transcriptional repressor. This present work as the first report about the functional exploration of the novel ZBTB34 gene would be contributed to profound understanding of the transcriptional regulation via BTB/POZ protein family.
