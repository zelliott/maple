A cDNA fragment of mouse 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase was isolated and used as the probe for Northern blot analysis. The mRNA bands in normal mice became detectable at 10 days after birth, reached the maximum at the period of active myelination and then decreased gradually. At all stages of development studied, the mRNA bands in quaking mice were markedly reduced as compared with those in normal mice.
