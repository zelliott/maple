Group B rotaviruses detected in Bangladesh in 2000 and 2001 were analyzed genetically to clarify relatedness to human group B rotaviruses reported previously in China and India, and to animal group B rotaviruses. VP7 gene sequences of the Bangladeshi group B rotaviruses (Bang373, Bang544, Bang334, and Bang402) were almost identical to each other and also showed high sequence identity to the Indian strain CAL-1 (98%) and Chinese strain adult diarrhea rotavirus (ADRV) (92%), while identities to bovine and murine viruses were considerably low (60-63%). Other genes of Bang373 and Bang544 encoding VP2, VP4, VP6, and NSP1 through NSP5 also showed much higher sequence identities to those of CAL-1 (97.7-99.4%) than to those of ADRV (89.9-93.9%). Characterization of nucleotide substitutions among Bang373, CAL-1, and ADRV suggested that all the gene segments might have evolved neutrally at similar mutation rates, while some of the gene segments (e.g., VP2 gene) were suggested to be more conserved than others. In conclusion, group B rotaviruses detected in Bangladesh represented by Bang373 and the Indian virus CAL-1 were considered as virtually identical viruses which are distinct genetically from ADRV, and it was suggested that Bang373 (CAL-1)-like group B rotavirus (Bengali strains) might be distributed primarily in an area around the Bay of Bengal.
