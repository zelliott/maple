A method for purifying DNA-specific catalytic antibodies based on affinity chromatography on protein A Sepharose and on both modified and non-modified DNA-cellulose as well as HPLC has been developed. The elution conditions with high yields of DNA-hydrolyzing activity of antibodies have been optimized. The biochemical and immunological properties of catalytic antibodies have been examined. The kinetic parameters of the enzyme interaction with an oligonucleotide substrate have been determined. The influence of effectors on DNA hydrolysis by antibodies has been investigated.
