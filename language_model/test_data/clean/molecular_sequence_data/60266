We previously suggested that the degree of polyamine stimulation of oligopeptide-binding protein (OppA) synthesis is dependent on the secondary structure and position of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence of OppA mRNA. To study the structural change of OppA mRNA induced by polyamines and polyamine stimulation of initiation complex formation, four different 130-mer OppA mRNAs containing the initiation region were synthesized in vitro. The structural change of these mRNAs induced by polyamines was examined by measuring their sensitivity to RNase T(1), specific for single-stranded RNA, and RNase V(1), which recognizes double-stranded or stacked RNA. In parallel, the effect of spermidine on mRNA-dependent fMet-tRNA binding to ribosomes was examined. Our results indicate that the secondary structure of the SD sequence and initiation codon AUG is important for the efficiency of initiation complex formation and that spermidine relaxes the structure of the SD sequence and the initiation codon AUG. The existence of a GC-rich double-stranded region close to the SD sequence is important for spermidine stimulation of fMet-tRNA binding to ribosomes. Spermidine apparently binds to this GC-rich stem and causes a structural change of the SD sequence and the initiation codon, facilitating an interaction with 30 S ribosomal subunits.
