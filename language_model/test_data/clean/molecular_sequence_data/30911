Degradation of a synthetic oligodeoxynucleoside phosphorothioate was studied in six systems used for antisense inhibition experiments. Oligodeoxynucleoside phosphorothioates were degraded very slowly at 37 degrees C in all of the systems studied. Measured half-lives of pentadecamers were 12 +/- 1 h in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 7 +/- 1 h in HeLa cell postmitochondrial extract, 14 +/- 2 h in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 8 +/- 1 h in undiluted fetal bovine serum, 9 +/- 1 h in adult human serum, and 19 +/- 7 h in rat cerebrospinal fluid.
