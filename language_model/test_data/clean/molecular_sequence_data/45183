The early phase of leptospiral infection is characterized by the presence of live organisms in the blood. Pathogenic Leptospira interrogans is resistant to the alternative pathway of complement mediated-killing, while nonpathogenic members of the genus are not. Consistent with that observation, only pathogenic leptospires bound factor H, a host fluid-phase regulator of the alternative complement pathway. Ligand affinity blot analyses revealed that pathogenic L. interrogans produces at least two factor H-binding proteins. Through screening of a lambda phage expression library, we identified one of these as the novel membrane protein LfhA. Ligand affinity assays and surface plasmon resonance analyses of recombinant LfhA revealed specific binding of both factor H and factor H-related protein 1. Serological examination of infected humans and horses demonstrated that LfhA is expressed by L. interrogans during mammalian infection. LfhA may therefore contribute to the resistance of pathogenic leptospires to complement-mediated killing during leptospiremic phases of the disease.
