A GTPase gene adjacent to the Ca(2+)-ATPase gene from Synechocystis PCC 6803 has been sequenced. It encodes for a protein of 456 amino acids revealing high homology to so-called 50K proteins of Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas putida. Cotranscription of GTPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase genes has been shown by reverse transcription PCR.
