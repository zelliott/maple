Five aspartate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.1; AAT) isozymes were identified in soybean seedling extracts and designated AAT1 to AAT5 based on their rate of migration on non-denaturing electrophoretic gels. AAT1 was detected only in extracts of cotyledons from dark-grown seedlings. AAT3 and AAT4 were detected in crude extracts of leaves and in cotyledons of seedlings grown in the light. AAT2 and AAT5 were detected in all tissues examined. A soybean leaf cDNA clone, pSAT17, was identified by hybridization to a carrot AAT cDNA clone at low stringency. pSAT17 had an open reading frame which could encode a 50,581 Da protein. Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence from the pSAT17 open reading frame with mature AAT protein sequences from rat disclosed a 60 amino acid N-terminal extension in the pSAT17 protein. This extension had characteristics of a plastid transit peptide. A plasmid, pEXAT17, was constructed which encoded the mature protein lacking the putative chloroplast transit polypeptide. Transformed Escherichia coli expressed a functional soybean AAT isozyme, which comigrated with the soybean AAT5 isozyme during agarose gel electrophoresis. Differential sucrose gradient sedimentation of soybean extracts indicated that AAT5 specifically cofractionated with chloroplasts. Antibodies raised against the pEXAT17-encoded AAT protein specifically reacted with the AAT5 isozyme of soybean and not with any of the other isozymes, indicating that the soybean cDNA clone, pSAT17, encodes the chloroplast isozyme, AAT5.
