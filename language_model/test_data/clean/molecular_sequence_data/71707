We assessed the efficacy and safety of Shanvac-B, a new recombinant hepatitis B vaccine developed in India. Eighty-one healthy volunteers (75 women, 6 men; aged 18-40 yr), negative for markers for hepatitis B and HIV, received 20 microg of the vaccine intramuscularly at 0, 1 and 2 months. Forty-three (53%) seroconverted at one month after dose 1; of these, 26% were seroprotected (anti-HBs> 10 mIU/mL). Seroprotection at one month after doses 2 and 3 was 99% and 100%, respectively. Geometric mean titres of anti-HBs in subjects who seroconverted were 11 (range 2-366), 266 (8-7469) and 2246 (102-23680) mIU/mL, respectively. One subject developed urticarial rash after the second dose; there was no other adverse event. We conclude that this vaccine is safe and efficacious, providing significant protection even after two doses.
