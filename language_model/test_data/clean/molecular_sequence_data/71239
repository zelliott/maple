Three muscle type-specific troponin T (TnT) genes are present in vertebrate to encode a number of protein isoforms via alternative mRNA splicing. While the genomic structures of cardiac and fast skeletal muscle TnT genes have been documented, this study cloned and characterized the slow skeletal muscle TnT (sTnT) gene. Complete nucleotide sequence and genomic organization revealed that the mouse sTnT gene spans 11.1kb and contains 14 exons, which is smaller and simpler than the fast skeletal muscle and cardiac TnT genes. Potentially representing a prototype of the TnT gene family, the 5'-region of the sTnT gene contains fewer unsplit large exons, among which two alternatively spliced exons are responsible for the NH2-terminal variation of three sTnT isoforms. The sTnT gene structure shows that the alternatively spliced central segment found in human sTnT cDNAs may be a result from splicing using an alternative acceptor site at the intron 11-exon 12 boundary. Together with the well-conserved protein structure, the highly specific expression of sTnT in slow skeletal muscles indicates a differentiated function of this member of the TnT gene family. The determination of genomic structure and alternative splicing pathways of sTnT gene lays a foundation to further understand the TnT structure-function evolution as well as contractile characteristics of different types of muscle fiber.
