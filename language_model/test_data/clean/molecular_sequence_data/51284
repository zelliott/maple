A transglycosylation reaction with moranoline (1-deoxynojirimycin) was done with soluble starch as the glucosyl donor and Bacillus macerans amylase as a cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase [EC 2.4.1.19]. The resultant transglycosylation products with moranoline, obtained by treating the reaction mixture with a strong cation exchange resin, were hydrolyzed by beta-amylase [EC 3.2.1.2] from sweet potatoes. The hydrolysate was treated with a strong cation exchange resin, and high purity maltose was obtained.
