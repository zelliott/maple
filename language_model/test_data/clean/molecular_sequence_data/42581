Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and blot hybridization by probe labelled with digoxin were used to detect human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA in 31 patients with acute leukemia and 20 controls. The positive rate detected by PCR in acute leukemia was 74.2% and 15.0% in the controls. The difference was statistically significant. The results suggest that acute leukemia patients are the high risk population with high infection rate of HCMV. The positive rate detected by digoxin method in acute leukemia was 58.1%. Six patients showed negative results by digoxin method, but positive by PCR. It was demonstrated that PCR was superior to digoxin method in sensitivity. Anti-HCMV IgM in serum of patients was detected at the same time, the positive rate was 16.1%. Only 6 of the 23 PCR positive patients showed positive anti-HCMV IgM. It suggests that the immune response is weak in acute leukemia patients and HCMV recently infected could not be excluded in the anti-HCMV IgM negative cases.
