Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe zoonosis with a high fatality rate. In Russia, local CCHF outbreaks have occurred in the Stavropol Territory, and the Volgograd and Astrakhan Regions during 2000 and 2001. Seven strains of CCHF virus (CCHFV) were isolated from infected patients and collected ticks. Two fragments of the CCHF virus M genome segment were PCR amplified and their nucleotide sequences were determined. All these virus strains appear to be closely related (up to 5.8% nucleotide sequence differences) and form a distinct clade on the CCHFV phylogenetic tree. Within this clade, CCHFV strains from Stavropol and Astrakhan cluster together, whereas those from Volgograd form a separate subgroup.
