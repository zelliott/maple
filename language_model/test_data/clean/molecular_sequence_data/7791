The gene coding the N-acyl-D-glutamate amidohydrolase of Alcaligenes xylosoxydans subsp. xylosoxydans A-6 (Alcaligenes A-6) was cloned and its complete DNA sequence was determined. The N-acyl-D-glutamate amidohydrolase structural gene consists of 1,464 nucleotides and encodes 488 amino acid residues. The molecular weight of the enzyme was calculated to be 51,490. This value is close to the apparent molecular weight of 59,000 determined for the purified enzyme from Alcaligenes A-6 by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the recombinant protein exactly matches the amino acid sequence derived from the DNA sequence and that determined from the Alcaligenes A-6 enzyme (NH2-MQEKLDLVIEGGWVIDGLGG). The deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned N-acyl-D-glutamate amidohydrolase showed high sequence homology with those of N-acyl-D-aspartate amidohydrolase (46%) and D-aminoacylase (47%) from Alcaligenes A-6. This fact strongly suggests that these three enzymes have evolved from a common ancestral gene.
