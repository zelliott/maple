The cellular rate of anticoagulant heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPGact) generation is determined by the level of a kinetically limiting microsomal activity, HSact conversion activity, which is predominantly composed of the long sought heparan sulfate D-glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase (3-OST) (Shworak, N. W., Fritze, L. M. S., Liu, J., Butler, L. D., and Rosenberg, R. D. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 27063-27071; Liu, J., Shworak, N. W., Fritze, L. M. S., Edelberg, J. M., and Rosenberg, R. D. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 27072-27082). Mouse 3-OST cDNAs were isolated by proteolyzing the purified enzyme with Lys-C, sequencing the resultant peptides as well as the existing amino terminus, employing degenerate polymerase chain reaction primers corresponding to the sequences of the peptides as well as the amino terminus to amplify a fragment from LTA cDNA, and utilizing the resultant probe to obtain full-length enzyme cDNAs from a lambda Zap Express LTA cDNA library. Human 3-OST cDNAs were isolated by searching the expressed sequence tag data bank with the mouse sequence, identifying a partial-length human cDNA and utilizing the clone as a probe to isolate a full-length enzyme cDNA from a lambda TriplEx human brain cDNA library. The expression of wild-type mouse 3-OST as well as protein A-tagged mouse enzyme by transient transfection of COS-7 cells and the expression of both wild-type mouse and human 3-OST by in vitro transcription/translation demonstrate that the two cDNAs directly encode both HSact conversion and 3-OST activities. The mouse 3-OST cDNAs exhibit three different size classes because of a 5'-untranslated region of variable length, which results from the insertion of 0-1629 base pairs (bp) between residues 216 and 217; however, all cDNAs contain the same open reading frame of 933 bp. The length of the 3'-untranslated region ranges from 301 to 430 bp. The nucleic acid sequence of mouse and human 3-OST cDNAs are approximately 85% similar, encoding novel 311- and 307-amino acid proteins of 35,876 and 35,750 daltons, respectively, that are 93% similar. The encoded enzymes are predicted to be intraluminal Golgi residents, presumably interacting via their C-terminal regions with an integral membrane protein. Both 3-OST species exhibit five potential N-glycosylation sites, which account for the apparent discrepancy between the molecular masses of the encoded enzyme (approximately 34 kDa) and the previously purified enzyme (approximately 46 kDa). The two 3-OST species also exhibit approximately 50% similarity with all previously identified forms of the heparan biosynthetic enzyme N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase, which suggests that heparan biosynthetic enzymes share a common sulfotransferase domain.
