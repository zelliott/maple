A Gram-stain-positive, catalase-negative and rod-shaped bacterium was isolated from a brewery environment. Its phylogenetic affiliation was determined by using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. It was found that strain TMW 1.1424(T) belongs to the genus Lactobacillus, with the three nearest neighbours Lactobacillus parabrevis LMG 11984(T) (97 %), Lactobacillus brevis DSM 20054(T) (95.9 %) and Lactobacillus hammesii DSM 16381(T) (96.2 %). Comparative sequencing of additional phylogenetic marker genes tuf and pheS confirmed the 16S rRNA gene sequence tree topology. The DNA G+C content of strain TMW 1.1424(T) is 46.6 mol%. Genomic DNA-DNA relatedness values with L. brevis DSM 20054(T), L. parabrevis LMG 11984(T) and L. hammesii DSM 16381(T) do not exceed 52.8 %, revealing that the novel isolate represents a separate genomic species. The strain can be distinguished from other related species of the genus Lactobacillus by physiological and biochemical tests. Based on biochemical, physiological and phylogenetic data, it is proposed that the new isolate be classified as a novel species of the genus Lactobacillus, Lactobacillus paucivorans sp. nov. The type strain is TMW 1.1424(T) (=DSM 22467(T) =LMG 25291(T)).
