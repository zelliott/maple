Genes encoding 16S rRNA were sequenced from 16 species of Staphylococcus. Sequence analysis highlighted a potential Staph. aureus-specific region and a complementary oligonucleotide probe was synthesized and its specificity tested. Northern blotting indicated molecular specificity, and dot blots to RNA from Staph. aureus, Staph. capitis, Staph. caprae, Staph. carnosus, Staph. caseolyticus, Staph. cohnii, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. gallinarum, Staph. haemolyticus, Staph. hominis, Staph. hyicus, Staph. saprophyticus, Staph. sciuri, Staph. simulans, Staph. warneri and Staph. xylosus indicated species-specificity.
