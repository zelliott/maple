Nineteen recombinant phages containing DNA from the region of Balbiani ring a (BRa), which develops on chromosome IV in cells of the special lobe of the Chironomus thummi salivary gland, were isolated from a Chironomus thummi genomic library. Three of the clones contained transposable element sequences that hybridized to more than 100 sites on all four Chironomus chromosomes, including constant and variable sites. Two handogous clones, lambda 24 (which lacks the transposable element) and lambda 43 (which contains this insertion) were investigated by nucleotide sequence analysis. The complete nucleotide sequence of the 4.8 kb transposable element from Chironomus thummi (NLR1Cth) is reported here. This element contains two overlapping open reading frames of 1887 (ORF1) and 2649 bp (ORF2). Three cysteine motifs are found in the sequence of ORF1. Sequence similarity was found between ORF2 and known genes of viruses and transposable elements which encode reverse transcriptase. The NLR1Cth element has no long terminal repeats and is flanked by short direct repeats of the sequence TATCACTGACAAC. A 24 bp poly(dA) sequence was found at the 3' end of the element. Based upon its structural organization and comparative analysis of its nucleotide sequence we suggest that this NLR1Cth element belongs to the class of non-LTR retrotransposons. The genomic clone pC6.10 was previously obtained by microdissection and cloning of DNA from polytene chromosome IV of Chironomus thummi. A 2.4 kb insertion contained part of the 3' terminal region of the NLR1Cth element, but this differed in sequence from the first copy by several nucleotide substitutions and a shorter poly (dA) tract at the 3' end.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
