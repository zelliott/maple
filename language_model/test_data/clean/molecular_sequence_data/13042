A novel sulfotransferase was purified from the rat liver cytosol to electrophoretic homogeneity via five column chromatography steps (hydroxylapatite I, DEAE Bio-Gel, ATP-agarose I, hydroxylapatite II, and ATP-agarose II). The minimum molecular weight of the purified enzyme was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be approximately 33,000. Gel filtration chromatography revealed a native molecular weight of approximately 34,000, indicating the enzyme being present in the monomeric form. The purified sulfotransferase displayed enzymatic activities, with a pH optimum of 9.25, toward various tyrosine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa) isomers, except DL-ortho-tyrosine. Thyroid hormones, as well as dopamine and p-nitrophenol, could also be used as substrates. The apparent Km value of the enzyme (designated the Dopa/tyrosine sulfotransferase) for L-Dopa, determined at a constant 14 microM of 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate, was 0.76 mM. The intact enzyme was found to be N-blocked when subjected to N-terminal sequencing. Three internal partial amino acid sequences, obtained by analyzing its proteolytic fragments, were found to be distinct from the homologous sequences of other known rat liver sulfotransferases. The deduced amino acid sequence of a full-length cDNA isolated from a rat liver cDNA library confirmed the identity of the Dopa/tyrosine sulfotransferase as a new type of aryl sulfotransferase. Upon transfection of COS-7 cells with an expression vector (pMSG-CMV) harboring the full-length cDNA, a 33-kDa protein displaying enzymatic and immunological properties similar to those of the purified Dopa/tyrosine sulfotransferase was expressed.
