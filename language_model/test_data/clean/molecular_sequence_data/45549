A new splicing site substitution (c.985-1G>C) in the glucose-6-phosphate translocase (G6PT1) gene was detected in both alleles of an Argentinean patient. This mutation was associated with an unusual GSD-Ib phenotype without neutropenia. A PCR-based cDNA analysis showed that the c.985-1G>C mutation produced two abnormal spliced G6PT1 transcripts both encoding hypothetical truncated proteins.
