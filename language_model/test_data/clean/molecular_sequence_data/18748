Two marine bacteria, designated strains MBE#61(T) and MBE#74(T), were isolated from a piece of sunken bamboo in the marine environment in Japan. Both of these strains were Gram-stain-negative, but had different cell shapes: MBE#61(T) was spiral, whereas MBE#74(T) was rod-shaped. The temperature, pH and salt concentration ranges for growth of strain MBE#61(T) were 4-38 °C (optimal at 32 °C), pH 4.5-11.0 (optimal at pH 7.0-8.0) and 1-11 % (optimal at 2 %) NaCl, whereas those of strain MBE#74(T) were 4-36 °C (optimal at 30 °C), pH 4.0-10.5 (optimal at pH 7.0-8.0) and 1-12 % (optimal at 4 %) NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that both strains belong to the genus Thalassospira within the class Alphaproteobacteria. Similarity between the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain MBE#61(T) and those of the type strains of species of the genus Thalassospira was 97.5-99.0 %, and that of strain MBE#74(T) was 96.9-98.6 %; these two isolates were most closely related to Thalassospira lucentensis QMT2(T). However, the DNA-DNA hybridization values between T. lucentensis QMT2(T) and strain MBE#61(T) or MBE#74(T) were only 16.0 % and 7.1 %, respectively. The DNA G+C content of strain MBE#61(T) was 54.4 mol%, and that of strain MBE#74(T) was 55.9 mol%. The predominant isoprenoid quinone of the two strains was Q-10 (MBE#61(T), 97.3 %; MBE#74(T), 93.5 %). The major cellular fatty acids of strain MBE#61(T) were C18 : 1ω7c (31.1 %), summed feature 3 comprising C16 : 0ω7c/iso-C15 : 0 2-OH (26.1 %) and C16 : 0 (20.9 %); those of strain MBE#74(T) were C16 : 0 (26.2 %), C17 : 0 cyclo (19.9 %) and C18 : 1ω7c (12.1 %). On the basis of these results, strain MBE#61(T) and strain MBE#74(T) are considered to represent novel species of the genus Thalassospira, for which names Thalassospira alkalitolerans sp. nov. and Thalassospira mesophila sp. nov. are proposed. The type strains are MBE#61(T) ( = JCM 18968(T) = CECT 8273(T)) and MBE#74(T) ( = JCM 18969(T) = CECT 8274(T)), respectively. An emended description of the genus Thalassospira is also proposed.
