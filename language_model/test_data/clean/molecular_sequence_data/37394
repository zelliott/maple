We have cloned and characterized the kex1 gene of Pneumocystis jiroveci. Unlike the case for Pneumocystis carinii, in which the homologous PRT-1 genes are multicopy, kex1 is a single-copy gene encoding a protein homologous to fungal serine endoproteases, which localize to the Golgi apparatus. Thus, substantial biological differences can be seen among Pneumocystis species.
