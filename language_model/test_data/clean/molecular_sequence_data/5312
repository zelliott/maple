Spontaneous cleavage of the less abundant form of tobacco ringspot virus satellite RNA is readily reversible. Capitalizing on earlier observations by Feldstein and Bruening that small 'mini-monomer' RNAs derived from this molecule and containing little more than covalently attached ribozyme and substrate cleavage products are able to efficiently circularize, we have constructed a series of self-circularizing RNAs of precisely known size. Mixtures of linear and circular RNAs synthesized in vitro and containing 225-1132 nt could be completely resolved using a novel two-dimensional denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system. Similar analyses of a complex mixture of coconut cadang-cadang viroid RNAs revealed the presence of relatively large amounts of a previously undescribed 'fast-slow' heterodimeric RNA species in infected palms. Only a single DNA template is required to prepare each pair of circular and linear RNA markers.
