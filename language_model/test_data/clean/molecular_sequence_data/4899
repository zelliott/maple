An in vitro protein synthesizing system that employs rabbit reticulocyte lysates has been employed for protein production from mRNAs containing nonsense (UAG) codons in the presence of misacylated suppressor tRNAs.The system includes a misacylated Escherichia coli tRNAAlaCUA that functions at least as efficiently as any suppressor tRNA transcript reported to date and which has been shown not to be a substrate for (re)activation by alanyl-tRNA synthetase. Application of the optimized system for preparation of dihydrofolate analogs has also permitted analysis of competing mechanisms that control the sites(s) of translation initiation.
