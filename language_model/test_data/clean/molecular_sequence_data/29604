A 3' terminal RNA uridylyltransferase was purified from mitochondria of Leishmania tarentolae and the gene cloned and expressed from this species and from Trypanosoma brucei. The enzyme is specific for 3' U-addition in the presence of Mg(2+). TUTase is present in vivo in at least two stable configurations: one contains a approximately 500 kDa TUTase oligomer and the other a approximately 700 kDa TUTase complex. Anti-TUTase antiserum specifically coprecipitates a small portion of the p45 and p50 RNA ligases and approximately 40% of the guide RNAs. Inhibition of TUTase expression in procyclic T. brucei by RNAi downregulates RNA editing and appears to affect parasite viability.
