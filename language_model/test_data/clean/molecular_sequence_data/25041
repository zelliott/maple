We have identified three novel chicken CC chemokine genes among cDNA clones derived from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells of the chicken macrophage cell line HD11. Two of these chemokines show DNA sequence homology to the mammalian genes SCYA20 (MIP-3alpha) and SCYA5 (RANTES), while the third shows similar levels of homology to several mammalian CC chemokines. Sequencing of genomic DNA showed that all three chicken chemokines possess the three-exon structure and conserved intron positions typical of mammalian CC chemokines. Genetic mapping of the three chicken chemokines locates them in three chromosomal regions which correspond to regions containing homologous chemokines in humans. Phylogenetic analysis of the currently known chicken and human chemokines suggests that individual chicken and human chemokines derive from common ancestral genes in patterns that reflect their genomic positions, indicating that the diversity of chemokine genes pre-dated avian-mammalian divergence. Since the function of the chemokines is principally to act as intermediates between stimulated cells and specific subsets of responding immune cells, this suggests that the complex organization of the immune system and diversity of responding cells were largely in place at that time.
