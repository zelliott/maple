Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-G and -C molecules bear ligands to natural killer immunoglobulin receptors (KIR). MHC-G evolution in primates shows some anomalies. In New World monkeys MHC-G molecules show a high polymorphism and most likely are classical antigen presenters; they also cluster closer to MHC-E in a relatedness dendrogram. Their genes lack intron 2 deletion, which is typical of all other primates in regard to MHC-G. Medium-sized Eurasian-African monkeys (Cercopithecinae) show stop codons in exon 3: only MHC-G isoforms without exon 3 are possible. Big apes such as the orangutan, gorilla, and chimpanzee as well as human beings show limited HLA-G polymorphism. HLA-C has not been found in medium-size Eurasian-African monkeys, but we have found MHC-C DNA sequences in more evolutionary ancient New World monkeys. Taking into account that the KIR inhibitory receptors signal is dominated by MHC-C in human beings, this suggests that both MHC-C molecules and their ligands within natural killer lymphocyte KIR also exist in the most evolutionary ancient apes (New World monkeys were present on Earth before 40 million years ago), as KIR receptors also appeared before 130 million years ago in evolution. Indeed, KIR receptor genes have recently been found in a New World monkey.
