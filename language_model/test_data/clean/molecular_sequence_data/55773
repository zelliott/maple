A potential new approach for gene therapy against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is the design of a nonstructural gene-based virion-specific inhibitory molecule that is packaged with virus to destroy its infectivity. We tested this approach for HIV-1 by using Vpx, a virion-associated protein of HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus. Vpx was incorporated into HIV-1 virions and the resulting cell-free virus lost infectivity in CD4+ human T cells. This demonstrates the therapeutic potential of an accessory gene-based virion-specific inhibitory molecule. Vpx and its derivatives can be regarded as a new class of anti-HIV-1 molecule.
