The most potent, physiologic activator of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene transcription is corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and increased intracellular cAMP is critical for this effect. The 5'-flanking region of the murine POMC gene has several potential binding sites for regulatory proteins. To characterize the region between nucleotides -141 and -106, which includes a TRE-like site and an adjacent AP-2 consensus sequence, and to study its role in signal-transcription coupling, gel mobility shift assays and transient expression of CAT chimeras were performed. In transient transfections of AtT-20 cells with pCATp-141/-106, CRH treatment led to significant increases in CAT expression compared with CRH treatment of cells transfected with the enhancerless vector. However, no response to direct activation of cAMP dependent protein kinase or protein kinase C was detected. Despite the high homology of the sequence -137/-131 to the consensus AP-1 binding site (TRE), the nuclear factor(s) in AtT-20 cells binding to this region appears to be different than authentic AP-1 since neither a competitor oligonucleotide having the authentic TRE sequence nor antibodies against Jun or Fos affected the gel shift pattern of a probe having the -137/-131 sequence. We conclude that the -141 to -106 region of the murine POMC gene contains a functional CRH responsive element and that second messenger systems that transduce the CRH signal to this element do not exert their actions solely through activation of PKA or PKC.
