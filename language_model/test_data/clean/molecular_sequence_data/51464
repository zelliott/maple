The 2-, 3-, 6-, 2'-, 3'-, 4'-, and 6'-deoxy derivatives and the 3-O-methyl derivative of methyl beta-lactoside have been synthesised and their binding to the galactose-specific agglutinin from Ricinus communis (RCA-120) has been investigated. The results indicate that HO-3,4,6 of the beta-D-galactopyranose moiety are the key polar groups. The main difference from the closely related ricin lectin RCA-60 involves HO-6 of the D-glucopyranose moiety, which seems to contribute to the binding of the carbohydrate to RCA-60 but not to RCA-120.
