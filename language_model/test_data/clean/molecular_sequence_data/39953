Transcriptional factors bearing a Cys(2)His(2) zinc finger were thought to be confined to eukaryotes, but recent studies have suggested their presence also in prokaryotes. In this paper, we report the first complete functional characterization of the DNA binding domain present in the putative Cys(2)His(2) zinc finger-containing prokaryotic transcriptional regulator Ros from Agrobacterium tumefaciens. We demonstrate that in the single zinc binding motif present in the Ros protein the metal ion is coordinated by two cysteines (Cys79 and Cys82) and two histidines (His92 and His97), separated by a shorter spacer with respect to the eukaryotic classical Cys(2)His(2) domains. The Cys(2)His(2) zinc finger motif is essential for Ros DNA binding and is part of a larger DNA binding domain which includes four basic regions located on either side of the finger, one at the N-terminus and three at the C-terminus. The one described here is a novel type of DNA binding domain containing a noncanonical Cys(2)His(2) zinc finger motif which, by sequence alignment, seems to be conserved in all the bacterial putative zinc finger proteins identified so far. Interestingly, basic amino acids have been shown to be important in stabilizing the DNA binding of eukaryotic single Cys(2)His(2) zinc finger domains, confirming that the modality of DNA binding using a single zinc finger motif flanked by basic residues is widespread throughout the living kingdom from eukaryotic, both animal and plant, to prokaryotic, even if in each kingdom it presents its peculiarity.
