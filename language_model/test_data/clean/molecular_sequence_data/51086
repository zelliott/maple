A new guanosine nucleotide has been synthesized and characterized: guanosine 5'-O-[S-(3-bromo-2-oxopropyl)]thiophosphate (GMPSBOP), with a reactive functional group which can be placed at a position equivalent to the pyrophosphate region of GTP. This new analog is negatively charged at neutral pH and is similar in size to GTP. GMPSBOP has been shown to react with bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase with an incorporation of 2 mol of reagent/mol of subunit. The modification reaction desensitizes the enzyme to inhibition by GTP, activation by ADP, and inhibition by high concentrations of NADH, but does not affect the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The rate constant for reaction of GMPSBOP with the enzyme exhibits a nonlinear dependence on reagent concentration with KD = 75 microM. The addition to the reaction mixture of alpha-ketoglutarate, GTP, ADP, or NADH alone results in little decrease in the rate constant, but the combined addition of 5 mM NADH with 0.4 mM GTP or with 10 mM alpha-ketoglutarate reduces the reaction rate approximately 6-fold. GMPSBOP modifies peptides containing Met-169 and Tyr-262, of which Tyr-262 is not critical for the decreased sensitivity of the enzyme toward allosteric ligands. The presence of 0.4 mM GTP plus 5 mM NADH protects the enzyme against reaction at both Met-169 and Tyr-262, but yields enzyme with 1 mol of reagent incorporated/mol of subunit which is modified at an alternate site, Met-469. In the presence of 0.2 mM GTP + 0.1 mM NADH, protection against modification of Tyr-262, but only partial protection against labeling of Met-169, is observed. In contrast, the presence of 10 mM alpha-ketoglutarate + 5 mM NADH protect only against reaction with Met-169. The results suggest that GMPSBOP reacts at the GTP-dependent NADH regulatory site [Lark, R. H., & Colman, R. F. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 10659-10666] of bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase, which markedly affects the sensitivity of the enzyme to GTP inhibition. The reaction of GMPSBOP with Met-169 is primarily responsible for the altered allosteric properties of the enzyme.
