A Ciona intestinalis cDNA clone that encodes a protein highly homologous to other tyrosinases was isolated. Northern blot analysis showed that expression of Ciona tyrosinase starts at the early neurula stage and continues throughout the tail-bud and tadpole larval stages. The earliest tyrosinase expression was detected, by in situ hybridization, at the neural plate stage, in pigment precursor cells located along the two neural folds, in the animal region of the embryo. In the course of embryonic development the strong hybridization signal was always localized, within the rostral part of the developing brain, in the pigment precursor cells and was later detected in the otolith and ocellus. These results are discussed in relation to tyrosinase as an early marker of neural induction.
