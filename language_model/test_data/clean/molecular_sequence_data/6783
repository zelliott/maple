This is the first demonstration that Gal4 DNA-binding domain (1-94) itself has the ability to trans-activate an eukaryotic promoter in vivo. It significantly activated a wheat histone H3 core promoter, but slightly activated a CaMV 35S core promoter in transiently transfected tobacco cells when the Gal4-recognition sequences were put upstream of the core promoters.
