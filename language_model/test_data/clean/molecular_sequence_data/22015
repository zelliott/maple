A novel Colwellia-like bacterial strain, SMK-10T, was isolated from a tidal flat sediment in Korea and subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic analysis. Cells of strain SMK-10T were Gram-negative, motile, greyish yellow-pigmented, curved rods. Optimal growth occurred at 25-30 degrees C and in the presence of 2-3 % (w/v) NaCl. Strain SMK-10T contained Q-8 as the predominant ubiquinone and C(16 : 1)omega7c and/or iso-C(15 : 0) 2-OH, C(17 : 1), C(15 : 1) and iso-C(16 : 0) as major fatty acids. The DNA G+C content was 39.3 mol%. Phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain SMK-10T belonged to the genus Colwellia. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values (94.7-96.7 %) to the type strains of all other Colwellia species and various differential phenotypic properties were sufficient to distinguish strain SMK-10T from recognized Colwellia species. On the basis of its phenotypic properties and phylogenetic distinctiveness, strain SMK-10T (= KCTC 12480T = DSM 17314T) is classified as the type strain of a novel Colwellia species, for which the name Colwellia aestuarii sp. nov. is proposed.
