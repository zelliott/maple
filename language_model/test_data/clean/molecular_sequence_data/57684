Using stable cell lines containing a series of deletions of the myelin basic protein (MBP) promoter directing the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene in a peripheral neurinoma cell line, we have studied the sequences in the MBP promoter needed for induction by cyclic AMP. Stimulation of expression from the MBP promoter by cyclic AMP is not a rapid response. Expression begins after 24 h and reaches a maximum at approximately 72 h. The results from the stable transformants indicate at least one region that appears to be essential to the induction of transcription directed by the MBP promoter. The region that is necessary for induction does not contain a consensus cyclic AMP response element. A specific binding site involved in the induction by cyclic AMP was localized to an NFI binding site.
