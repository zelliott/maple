The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-II genes are described as the genes that encode the antigen-presenting molecule. In particular, functional alleles of MHC class-II genes in nonhuman primates have been analyzed as part of the study of infectious and immune-mediated diseases in animal models and as part of efforts to understand the molecular evolution of human leukocyte antigen. The polymorphisms and sequence analysis of MHC class-II genes in a large number of subjects is necessary for the group management of nonhuman primates. In the present study, we attempted to analyze the DQB1 polymorphism in the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) by exon 2 sequencing. For exact typing of Patr-DQB1 alleles, we carried out polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequence analysis. In the genomic DNA of 25 chimpanzees, 6 Patr-DQB1 alleles, including 2 new alleles, were detected. Identification and analysis of Patr-DQB1 alleles using this method may contribute to our understanding of Patr-DQB1 allelic diversity in individual chimpanzees and should be useful in facilitating colony management of chimpanzee groups in Japan.
