We have developed a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for rapid detection of Langat (LGT) virus, a flavivirus that is closely related to the highly pathogenic tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) viruses. Unlike TBE viruses, LGT virus exhibits a significantly lower virulence for man. The assay serves as a safe alternative for the development and optimization of specific assays for the highly pathogenic subtypes of TBE viruses that are endemic throughout much of Europe, the former Soviet Union, and China.
