The nicotinic receptor (AChR) is a pentamer of homologous subunits with an alpha(2)betaepsilondelta composition in adult muscle. Each subunit contains four transmembrane domains (M1-M4). Position 15' of the M1 domain is phenylalanine in alpha subunits while it is isoleucine in non-alpha subunits. Given this peculiar conservation pattern, we studied its contribution to muscle AChR activation by combining mutagenesis with single-channel kinetic analysis. AChRs containing the mutant alpha subunit (alphaF15'I) as well as those containing the reverse mutations in the non-alpha subunits (betaI15'F, deltaI15'F, and epsilonI15'F) show prolonged lifetimes of the diliganded open channel resulting from a slower closing rate with respect to wild-type AChRs. The kinetic changes are not equivalent among subunits, the beta subunit, being the one that produces the most significant stabilization of the open state. Kinetic analysis of betaI15'F of AChR channels activated by the low-efficacious agonist choline revealed a 10-fold decrease in the closing rate, a 2.5-fold increase in the opening rate, a 28-fold increase in the gating equilibrium constant in the diliganded receptor, and a significant increase opening in the absence of agonist. Mutations at betaI15' showed that the structural bases of its contribution to gating is complex. Rate-equilibrium linear free-energy relationships suggest an approximately 70% closed-state-like environment for the beta15' position at the transition state of gating. The overall results identify position 15' as a subunit-selective determinant of channel gating and add new experimental evidence that gives support to the involvement of the M1 domain in the operation of the channel gating apparatus.
