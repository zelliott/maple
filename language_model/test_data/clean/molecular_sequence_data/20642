The identification of antigenic epitopes is important for the optimization of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) intended as therapeutic agents. MS has proven to be a powerful tool for the study of noncovalent molecular interactions such as those involved in antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) binding. In this work, we described a novel methodology for mapping a linear epitope based on direct mass spectrometric measurement of Ab-Ag complexes. To demonstrate the utility of our methodology, we employed two approaches, epitope excision and epitope extraction, to study a model system consisting of a Fab antibody fragment with specificity toward the peptide abeta(1-40). In epitope excision, the Fab and abeta(1-40) complex was treated with proteolytic enzymes and the digested complexes were directly monitored by MS under native conditions. Mass differences between the Fab-abeta complex and the Fab control revealed the size of epitope peptides that were bound to the Fab. Using the epitope extraction approach, abeta(1-40) was first digested by Lys-C, and the fragment containing the epitope was selected by Fab binding. Data analysis allowed mapping of the epitope to abeta(16-27) which is in good agreement with previously unpublished data. The utility of the methodology was demonstrated by elucidating the binding epitopes for two full-length anti-abeta(1-40) mAbs.
