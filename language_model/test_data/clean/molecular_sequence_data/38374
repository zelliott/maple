WNT receptors encoded by the Frizzled genes are implicated in carcinogenesis as well as in embryonic development. Human Frizzled-3 (FZD3) gene, encoding seven-transmembrane receptor with the N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, has been cloned and characterized. Expression of the FZD3 mRNAs was investigated by using three FZD3 specific probes: HF3S1, corresponding to the 5'-UTR and a part of the coding region; HF3S2, corresponding to a part of the coding region; HF3S3, corresponding to the 3'-UTR. HF3S1 and HF3S2 hybridized to the 14.0-, 9.0-, 4.0- and 1.8-kb FZD3 mRNA, while HF3S3 hybridized to the 14.0-, 9.0-, and 4.0-kb FZD3 mRNA. The 14. 0-kb FZD3 mRNA was the major transcript in fetal brain and adult cerebellum, while the 1.8-kb FZD3 mRNA was the major transcript in adult pancreas, and many cancer cell lines examined. The 1.8-kb FZD3 mRNA, alternatively polyadenylated by the internal AATAAA signal in the coding region, is predicted to encode the truncated FZD3 protein lacking the region through the second extracellular loop to the C-terminal tail, and might function as the transmembrane-type antagonist for WNTs. The FZD3 gene consists of 8 exons, and has been mapped to human chromosome 8p21.
