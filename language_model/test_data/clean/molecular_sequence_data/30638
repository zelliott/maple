Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) histone mRNA synthesis is tightly regulated to the S phase of the cell division cycle as a result of both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. We focused on the role of posttranscriptional control in histone H2B1 gene (HTB1) regulation and studied a portion of the HTB1 message required for cell-cycle-specific accumulation. The 3' end of the HTB1 gene containing a 17-amino-acid coding sequence and entire noncoding sequence was fused to the bacterial neomycin phosphotransferase II gene (neo) under control of the GAL1 promoter. The expression of the endogenous and chimeric HTB1 genes was analyzed during the yeast cell cycle. As yeast cells entered a synchronous cell cycle following release from alpha-factor arrest, the level of GAL1-promoter-controlled neo-HTB1 message increased approximately 12-fold during S phase and dropped to basal level when the cells left S phase. This indicates that the 3' end of the HTB1 mRNA is capable of conferring cycle-specific regulation on a heterologous message. Deletion analysis of the 3' end showed that the signal for cell cycle control of HTB1 mRNA includes contiguous coding and noncoding sequences surrounding the stop codon. This differs from the situation in mammalian cells, whose posttranscriptional regulation of histone genes is mediated through a short sequence containing a stem-loop structure near the very terminus of the untranslated 3' end.
