It became clear that mRNA can be stabilized in a cell-free translation system of Escherichia coli by hybridization with a small DNA fragment at its 3' terminus. The stability increased when a small DNA fragment containing a stable hairpin structure with a GAAA loop was used. The enhancement of stabilization was brought about because the hairpin structure is resistant towards the nucleases contained in the translation system. The hairpin structure is effective by stabilizing the added DNA fragment itself towards the nucleases.
