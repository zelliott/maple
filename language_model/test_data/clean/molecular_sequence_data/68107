In this report we demonstrate that an alpha-3 acetylcholine receptor subunit transcriptional variant originates through alternative splicing of a complementary sequence of the right arm of an Alu element. This element is located within the 5.1 Kb intron found between exons 5 and 6 of the alpha-3 acetylcholine receptor subunit gene. The transcriptional variant originates from the normal splicing process and carries an in-frame stop codon. If translated, it should encode for a peptide lacking the 4th transmembrane domain of the normal subunit.
