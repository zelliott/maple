Two genomic fragments capable of driving the expression of the hygromycin B resistance gene (hph) were isolated from the phytopathogenic ascomycete Gibberella pulicaris (anamorph Fusarium sambucinum) using a "promoter-probe library" strategy. Two libraries consisting of random, 0.5-2.0-kb fragments of genomic DNA inserted 5' of a promoterless hph gene were constructed and used for transformation of G. pulicaris. Both libraries transformed G. pulicaris at a low frequency. Transformants tolerated up to 800 micrograms/ml of hygromycin B, while untransformed colonies were inhibited completely by 50 micrograms/ml of the antibiotic. Plasmids were re-isolated from transformants by simply digesting, the genomic DNA with KpnI, which cuts once in the polylinker 5' to the insert, and transforming E. coli with the re-ligated DNA. The recovered plasmids transformed G. pulicaris with a frequency of up to 4.4 transformants/micrograms of DNA. Both promoter fragments were sequenced and found to contain TATA and CAAT boxes as well as CT-rich sequences. This method makes it possible to easily isolate many fragments with promoter activity from filamentous fungi, and should facilitate the investigation of the promoter structures necessary for the expression of fungal genes.
