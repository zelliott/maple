The nucleotide sequence of the probe BS674E-D defining the genetic locus D4S95 was assessed, and used for designing PCR-primers amplifying a 175 bp fragment containing a polymorphic MboI site. With the described conditions it is now possible to use PCR followed by digestion for rapid determination of genotype in this marker system.
