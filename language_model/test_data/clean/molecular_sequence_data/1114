Heparin is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan isolated from animal organs that has been used clinically as an antithrombotic agent since the 1940s. In the early 1980s it was discovered that a unique pentasaccharide domain in some heparin chains activates antithrombin III (AT-III), a serine protease inhibitor that blocks thrombin and factor Xa in the coagulation cascade. Sanofi-Synth√©labo and Organon developed a synthetic analogue of this pentasaccharide. The resulting antithrombotic drug arixtra, which went on the market in the USA and Europe in 2002, shows superior antithrombotic activity and brings about AT-III-mediated activity against factor Xa exclusively. Structure-based design has subsequently led to analogues with longer-lasting activity, such as idraparinux, as well as novel conjugates and long oligosaccharides with specific anti-Xa and antithrombin activities. The new drug candidates are more selective in their mode of action than heparin and less likely to induce thrombocytopenia.
