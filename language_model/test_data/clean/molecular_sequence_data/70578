To explore the role of a hydrophobic domain of actin in the interaction with a myosin chain we have synthesized a peptide corresponding to residues 75-106 of native actin monomer and studied by fluorescence and ELISA the interaction (13+/-2.6x10(-6) M) with both S-1 and (27 kDa-50 kDa-20 kDa) S-1 trypsin derivative of myosin. The loop corresponding to 96-103 actin residues binds to the S-1 only in the absence of Mg-ATP and under similar conditions but not to the trypsin derivative S-1. Biotinylated C74-K95 and I85-K95 peptide fragments were purified after actin proteolysis with trypsin. The C74-K95 peptide interacted with both S-1 and the S-1 trypsin derivative with an apparent Kd(app) of 6+/-1.2x10(-6) M in the presence or absence of nucleotides. Although peptide fragment I85-K95 binds to S-1 with a Kd(app) of 12+/-2.4x10(-6) M, this fragment did not bind to the trypsin S-1 derivative. We concluded that the actin 85-95 sequence should be a potential binding site to S-1 depending of the conformational state of the intact 70 kDa segment of S-1.
