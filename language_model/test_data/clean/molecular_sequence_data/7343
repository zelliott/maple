Phylogenetic analysis of the small subunit ribosomal DNA of a broad range of representative microsporidia including five species from humans (Enterocytozoon bieneusi, Nosema corneum, Septata intestinalis, Encephalitozoon hellem and Encephalitozoon cuniculi), reveals that human microsporidia are polyphyletic in origin. Septata intestinalis and E. hellem are very similar to the mammalian parasite E. cuniculi. Based on the results of our phylogenetic analysis, we suggest that S. intestinalis be designated Encephalitozoon intestinalis. Furthermore, analysis of our data indicates that N. corneum is much more closely related to the insect parasite Endoreticulatus schubergi than it is to other Nosema species. This finding is supported by recent studies which have shown a similarity between E. schubergi and N. corneum based on the origin and development of the parasitophorous vacuole. Thus these opportunistic microsporidian parasites can originate from hosts closely or distantly related to humans. Finally, the phylogeny based on small subunit ribosomal DNA sequences is highly inconsistent with traditional classifications based on morphological characters. Many of the important morphological characters (diplokaryon, sporophorous vesicle, and meiosis) appear to have multiple-origins.
