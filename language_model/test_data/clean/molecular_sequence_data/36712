Shuttle vectors expressing resistance to hygromycin B in both E. coli and in mammalian cells were constructed. A combination of the simian virus 40 early promoter upstream of the native bacterial promoter of the neo gene from transposon Tn5 was found to express hygromycin B resistance better in both types of host cells than a combination of the Tn5 promoter followed by the promoter of the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene. Hygromycin phosphotransferase fusion proteins with extensions at the carboxyterminus were also tested and found to be marginally less effective as selection markers in eukaryotic cells but virtually inactive in E. coli.
