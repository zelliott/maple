Palladium(II) complexes promote hydrolysis of natural and synthetic oligopeptides with unprecedented regioselectivity; the only cleavage site is the second peptide bond upstream from a methionine or a histidine side chain, that is, the bond involving the amino group of the residue that precedes this side chain. We investigate this regioselectivity with four N-acetylated peptides as substrates: neurotransmitter methionine enkephalin (Ac-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met) and synthetic peptides termed Met-peptide (Ac-Ala-Lys-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Met-Ala-Ala-Arg-Ala), His-peptide (Ac-Val-Lys-Gly-Gly-His-Ala-Lys-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Met(OX)-Ala-Ala-Arg-Ala), in which a Met is oxidized to sulfone, and HisMet-peptide (Ac-Val-Lys-Gly-Gly-His-Ala-Lys-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Met-Ala-Ala-Arg-Ala). While maintaining protein-like properties, these substrates are suitable for quantitative study since their coordination to Pd(II) ion can be determined (by NMR spectroscopy), and the cleavage fragments can be separated (by HPLC methods) and identified (by MALDI mass spectrometry). The only peptide bonds cleaved were the Gly3-Phe4 bond in methionine enkephalin, Gly4-Gly5 bond in Met-peptide, Gly3-Gly4 in His-peptide, and Gly3-Gly4 and Gly9-Gly10 bonds in HisMet-peptide. We explain this consistent regioselectivity of cleavage by studying the modes of Met-peptide coordination to the Pd(II) ion in [Pd(H(2)O)(4)](2+) complex. In acidic solution, the rapid attachment of the Pd(II) complex to the methionine side chain is followed by the interaction of the Pd(II) ion with the peptide backbone upstream from the anchor. In the hydrolytically active complex, Met-peptide is coordinated to Pd(II) ion as a bidentate ligand - via sulfur atom in the methionine side chain and the first peptide nitrogen upstream from this anchor - so that the Pd(II) complex approaches the scissile peptide bond. Because the increased acidity favors this hydrolytically active complex, the rate of cleavage guided by either histidine or methionine anchor increased as pH was lowered from 4.5 to 0.5. The unwanted additional cleavage of the first peptide bond upstream from the anchor is suppressed if pH is kept above 1.2. Four Pd(II) complexes cleave Met-peptide with the same regioselectivity but at somewhat different rates. Complexes in which Pd(II) ion carries labile ligands, such as [Pd(H(2)O)(4)](2+) and [Pd(NH(3))(4)](2+), are more reactive than those containing anionic ligands, such as [PdCl(4)](2)(-), or a bidentate ligand, such as cis-[Pd(en)(H(2)O)(2)](2+). When both methionine and histidine residues are present in the same substrate, as in HisMet-peptide, 1 molar equivalent of the Pd(II) complex distributes itself evenly at both anchors and provides partial cleavage, whereas 2 molar equivalents of the promoter completely cleave the second peptide bond upstream from each of the anchors. The results of this study bode well for growing use of palladium(II) reagents in biochemical and bioanalytical practice.
