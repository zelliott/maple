We report a novel mutant of the luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) in a case of familial Leydig cell hypoplasia and pseudohermaphrotidism. The proband was homozygous for two missense mutations, T1121C and C1175T, causing substitutions I374T and T3921. The molecular effects of the mutations were investigated by heterologous expression of the WT LHR, the double mutant LHR, or receptors with either the I374T or the T392I mutation, and measuring hormone binding and cAMP signaling. All mutant LHRs exhibited severe defects, including loss of ligand binding and cAMP production. Immunoblots showed little difference in protein levels between the WT and mutant receptors.
