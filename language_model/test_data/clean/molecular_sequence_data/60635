Studying the genetic polymorphism of the major histocompatibility complex class II genes in cattle, we identified a sequence (KUH1) which resembles those encoding class II beta chains. The gene was shown to be transcribed in peripheral blood leukocytes. Sequence comparisons, Southern blot, and phylogenetic analyses indicate that (1) KUH1 represents a distinct DQB locus, which we propose to designate BoLA-DQB5, (2) DQB5 constitutes an ancient DQB locus which diverged from a common ancestor gene prior to the duplication resulting in DQB1 and DQB2, (3) DQB5 is associated with haplotypes which contain DQA5 and a duplicated DQ region.
