The steroid 21-hydroxylase gene, CYP21B, encodes cytochrome P450c21, which mediates 21-hydroxylation. The gene is located about 30 kb downstream from pseudogene CYP21A. The CYP21A gene is homologous to the CYP21B gene but contains some mutations, including a C----T change which leads a termination codon, TAG, in the eighth exon. We found the same change in a mutant CYP21B gene isolated from a patient with 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Furthermore, a reciprocal change--i.e., a T----C change in the eighth exon of the CYP21A gene--was observed in the Japanese population and was associated with the two HLA haplotypes, HLA-B44-DRw13 and HLA-Bw46-DRw8. These changes may be considered the result of gene conversion-like events.
