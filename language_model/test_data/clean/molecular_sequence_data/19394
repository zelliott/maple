The C-terminal "CaaX"-motif-containing proteins usually undergo three sequential post-translational processing steps: (1) attachment of a prenyl group to the cysteine residue; (2) proteolytic removal of the last three amino acids "aaX"; (3) methyl esterification of the exposed alpha-carboxyl group of the prenyl-cysteine residue. The Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major Ras converting enzyme 1 (RCE1) orthologs of 302 and 285 amino acids-proteins, respectively, have only 13-20% sequence identity to those from other species but contain the critical residues for the activity found in other orthologs. The Trypanosoma brucei a-factor converting enzyme 1 (AFC1) ortholog consists of 427 amino acids with 29-33% sequence identity to those of other species and contains the consensus HExxH zinc-binding motif. The trypanosomatid RCE1 and AFC1 orthologs contain predicted transmembrane regions like other species. Membranes from Sf9 cells expressing the RCE1 ortholog of T. brucei or L. major showed proteolytic activity against farnesylated RAS-CVIM, whereas membranes containing T. brucei AFC1 ortholog were inactive. The results suggest that RCE1 is responsible for proteolytic removal of the C-terminal aaX from prenyl-CaaX proteins in these parasites. All the three enzymatic post-translational processes are thought to be required for proper cellular functioning of CaaX-proteins in eukaryotic cells. We carried out RNA interference experiments in Trypanosoma brucei of the enzymes involved in farnesyl protein post-translational modification to evaluate their importance in cell proliferation. Knockdown of T. brucei PFT beta subunit and RCE1 mRNAs resulted in >20-fold suppression of cell growth and dramatic morphologic changes. Knockdown of PPMT mRNA caused less dramatic effects on growth but induced noticeable changes in cell morphology.
