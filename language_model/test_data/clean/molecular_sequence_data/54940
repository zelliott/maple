The requirements to transform a short disintegrin of the RGD clade into an RTS disintegrin, were investigated through the generation of recombinant mutants of ocellatusin in which the RGD tripeptide was substituted for RTS in different positions along the integrin-specificity loop. Any attempt to create an active integrin α(1)β(1) inhibitory motif within the specificity loop of ocellatusin was unsuccessful. Replacing the whole RGD-loop of ocellatusin by the RTS-loop of jerdostatin was neither sufficient for confering α(1)β(1) binding specificity to this ocellatusin-RTS Frankenstein(2) mutant. Factors other than the integrin-binding loop sequence per se are thus required to transform a disintegrin scaffold from the RGD clade into another scaffold from the RTS/KTS clade. Moreover, our results provide evidences, that the RTS/KTS short disintegrins have potentially been recruited into the venom gland of Eurasian vipers independently from the canonical neofunctionalization pathway of the RGD disintegrins. PCR-amplifications of jerdostatin-like sequences from a number of taxa across reptiles, including snakes (Crotalinae, Viperinae, and Elapidae taxa) and lizards (Lacertidae and Iguanidae) clearly showed that genes coding for RTS/KTS disintegrins existed long before the split of Lacertidae and Iguania, thus predating the recruitment of the SVMP precursors of disintegrins, providing strong support for the view of an independent evolutionary history of the RTS/KTS and the RGD clades of short disintegrins.
