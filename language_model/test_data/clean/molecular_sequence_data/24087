A rubber particle protein with apparent molecular mass of 43 kD as determined by SDS-PAGE was purified. A degenerate oligonucleotide primer based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of this purified protein was used to amplify a 1385 bp cDNA by 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3'RACE). The cDNA contains five repeats in a head-to-tail arrangement without intervening sequences, each encoding a ubiquitin unit of 76 amino acids. The last ubiquitin unit is followed by an extraphenylanaline residue at the carboxyl-terminal end. The structure of the cDNA is consistent with the structure of other known polyubiquitin genes. Western blot demonstrated that 43 kD rubber particle protein might be a polyubiquitin. Southern blot analysis revealed that there were multiple copies of gene encoding 43 kD rubber particle protein in Hevea brasiliensis. The results of Northern blot analysis indicated that the gene was expressed in latex, young leaves and bark tissue.
