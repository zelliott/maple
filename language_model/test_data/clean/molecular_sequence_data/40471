To elucidate clinical and molecular characteristics of chikungunya fever (CHIK fever) from the 2008-2009 outbreak caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in southern Thailand.

Three hundred and eighty-one sera from 332 patients with acute febrile illness were tested for anti-CHIKV IgM antibody by ELISA. A molecular analysis of these sera was performed using a semi-nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), followed by direct sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.

One hundred and seventy-nine patients were diagnosed with CHIK fever by molecular analysis and/or anti-CHIKV IgM antibody detection. Patients diagnosed with CHIK fever were significantly older than controls (mean age 38.8±19 vs. 28.7±18 years, p<0.0001) and presented with arthralgia more often than controls. One hundred percent of the sera were positive by RT-PCR, whereas only 10% were positive in serological tests for anti-CHIKV IgM antibody by ELISA if the serum was obtained during the first 4 days of fever. In contrast, CHIKV-specific IgM antibody by ELISA was found in 100% of patients, whereas 15% of patients were positive by RT-PCR if the serum was obtained more than 9 days after the onset of fever. RT-PCR for CHIKV should be performed if the patients present within the first 4 days of fever. Patients presenting after at least 9 days of fever should be tested for IgM antibody. Based on phylogenetic analysis, the CHIKV strains isolated belong to African genotypes harboring the E1 A226V mutation, indicating a single origin of the 2004-2009 CHIKV outbreaks.

The novel CHIKV mutation could potentially modify the epidemiological presentation of CHIK fever. Early diagnosis of CHIK fever is essential for preventing further massive outbreaks.
