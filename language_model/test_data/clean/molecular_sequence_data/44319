In vitro growth properties of three CNS-derived cell lines were compared under a variety of culture conditions. The M213-20 and J30a cell lines were each derived from embryonic CNS culture with the temperature-sensitive (ts) allele of SV40 large T antigen, tsA58, while the A7 cell line was immortalized using wild-type SV40 large T antigen. Cells immortalized with tsA58 SV40 large T proliferate at the permissive temperature, 33 degrees C, while growth is expected to be suppressed at the nonpermissive temperature, 39.5 degrees C. Both the M213-20 and J30a cell lines were capable of proliferating at 39.5 degrees C continuously for up to 6 mo. All three cell lines showed no appreciable differences in growth rates related to temperature over a 7-day period in either serum-containing or defined serum-free media. The percentage of cells in S-phase of the cell cycle did not decrease or was elevated at 39.5 degrees C for all three cell lines. After 3 wk at 39.5 degrees C, the three cell lines also showed positive immunostaining using two monoclonal antibodies reacting with different epitopes of SV40 large T antigen. Double strand DNA sequence analyses of a 300 base pair (bp) fragment of the large T gene from each cell line, which included the ts locus, revealed mutations in both the J30a and M213-20 cell lines. The J30a cell line ts mutation had reverted to wild type, and two additional loci with bp substitutions with predicted amino acid changes were also found. While the ts mutation of the M213-20 cells was retained, an additional bp substitution with a predicted amino acid change was found. The A7 cell line sequence was identical to the reference wild-type sequence. These findings suggest that (a) nucleic acid sequences in the temperature-sensitive region of the tsA58 allele of SV40 large T are not necessarily stable, and (b) temperature sensitivity of cell lines immortalized with tsA58 is not necessarily retained.
