The gene for BstF5I-1 DNA-methyltransferase (MTase) from Bacillus stearothermophilus F5 (a FokI isoschizomer, recognizing 5'-GGATG-3') was cloned and its nucleotide (nt) sequence was determined. Analysis of deduced amino acid (aa) sequence shows that M x BstF5I-1 belongs to D21 class of MTases and has a little homology with M x FokI. M x BstF5I-1 modifies only the upper strand of recognition sequence (5'-GGATG-3').
