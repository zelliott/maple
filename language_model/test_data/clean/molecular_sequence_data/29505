We examined the ability of the ovine mammary gland to synthesize leptin throughout pregnancy and lactation. Leptin gene expression was assayed by real-time reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction in mammary gland from ewes at 15, 80, 106, 112, or 141 d of pregnancy and at 0 (30 min after parturition), 3, 48, or 70 d of lactation. Leptin mRNA level was high at the beginning (the first 80 d) and at the end of pregnancy and was lower at mid-pregnancy and throughout lactation. Furthermore, during these periods of mammary leptin expression, the location of leptin protein, as determined by immunohistochemical analysis, changed within mammary tissue. It was located in adipose cells during early stages of pregnancy, in epithelial cells after full cell differentiation just before parturition, and in myoepithelial cells after parturition. These data, compared with published data on leptin receptor gene expression, provide evidence that leptin could be produced by different cell types of the mammary gland and could act as a paracrine factor on mammary cell growth and differentiation via adipose-epithelial cells and myoepithelial-epithelial cell interactions.
