Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM-kinase) kinase a, which is known to activate CaM-kinases IV and I by phosphorylation of Thr196 and Thr177, respectively, can only phosphorylate Thr196 among many phosphorylation sites of CaM-kinase IV [Kitani, T., Okuno, S., and Fujisawa, H. (1997) J. Biochem. 121, 804-810], indicating its high degree of substrate specificity. In the present study, the substrate specificity of CaM-kinase kinase a was examined using various proteins and synthetic peptides as substrates as a means to address its physiological function. Among a number of proteins and synthetic peptides, including several known as good substrates for various protein kinases, only CaM-kinases IV and I and peptides containing the sequence surrounding Thr196 of CaM-kinase IV or Thr177 of CaM-kinase I were significantly phosphorylated by CaM-kinase kinase alpha, while the heat-denatured (at 60 degrees C for 5 min) CaM-kinases IV and I were not phosphorylated. Peptides containing the phosphorylation site of CaM-kinase IV or I were far less active as substrates for CaM-kinase kinase a than were native CaM-kinase IV or I. Thus, CaM-kinase kinase a showed a high degree of substrate specificity, recognizing not only specific amino acid sequences but also the native conformation of CaM-kinases IV and I.
