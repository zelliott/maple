Using a gel retardation assay it was shown that the 87 bp DNA fragment (UAS87) containing the upstream activating sequence (UAS) of S. cerevisiae EN01 gene and a nuclear extract gave rise to three migration-retarded species specific to UAS87. Heat- or proteinase-treatment of the nuclear extract revealed that these species were protein-DNA complexes. The precise binding region of the protein identified by DNaseI protection analysis was found to include a CCAAACA sequence which forms a dyad-symmetrical structure. The amount of one of the three migration-retarded species significantly increased when cells were grown in medium containing a gluconeogenic carbon source. The introduction of pGCR8, a multicopy plasmid containing GCR1 gene, a regulatory gene controlling the expression of several glycolytic enzymes, showed no effect on the amount of three migration-retarded species.
