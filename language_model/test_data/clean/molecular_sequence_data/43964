The three-dimensional structure of glutathione S-transferase from Arabidopsis thaliana has been solved at 2.2 A resolution (Reinemer et al., 1996). The enzyme forms a dimer of two identical subunits. The structure shows a new G-site architecture and a novel and unique dimer interface. Each monomer of the protein forms a separate G-site. Therefore, the requirements on the dimer interface are reduced. As a consequence, the interactions between the monomers are weaker and residues at the dimer interface are more variable. Thus, the dimer interface looses its relevance for a classification of plant glutathione S-transferases and the formation of heterodimers becomes even more difficult to predict.
