Natural variants of cerato-platanin (CP), a pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) protein produced by Ceratocystis platani (the causal agent of the plane canker stain), have been found to be produced by other four species of the genus Ceratocystis, including five clones of Ceratocystis fimbriata isolated from different hosts. All these fungal strains were known to be pathogenic to plants with considerable importance in agriculture, forestry, and as ornamental plants. The putative premature proteins were deduced on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of genes orthologous to the cp gene of C. platani; the deduced premature proteins of Ceratocystis populicola and Ceratocystis variospora reduced the total identity of all the others from 87.3% to 60.3%. Cerato-populin (Pop1), the CP-orthologous protein produced by C. populicola, was purified and characterized. Pop1 was a well-structured alpha/beta protein with a different percentage of the alpha-helix than CP, and it self-assembled in vitro in ordered aggregates. Moreover, Pop1 behaved as PAMP, since it stimulated poplar leaf tissues to activate defence responses able to reduce consistently the C. populicola growth.
