Metal implants are in general not compatible with the tissues of the human body, and in particular, blood exhibits a severe hemostatic response. Herein we present results of a technique to mask the surface of metals with a natural biopolymer, hyaluronan (HA). HA has minimal adverse interactions with blood and other tissues, but attachment of bioactive peptides can promote specific biological interactions. In this study, stainless steel was cleaned and then surface-modified by covalent attachment of an epoxy silane. The epoxy was subsequently converted to an aldehyde functional group and reacted with hyaluronan through an adipic dihydrazide linkage, thus covalently immobilizing the HA onto the steel surface. Fluorescent labeling of the HA showed that the surface had a fairly uniform covering of HA. When human platelet rich plasma was placed on the HA-coated surface, there was no observable adhesion of platelets. HA derivatized with a peptide containing the RGD peptide sequence was also bound to the stainless steel. The RGD-containing peptide was bioactive as exemplified by the attachment and spreading of platelets on this surface. Furthermore, when the RGD peptide was replaced with the nonsense RDG sequence, minimal adhesion of platelets was observed. This type of controlled biological activity on a metal surface has potential for modulating cell growth and cellular interactions with metallic implants, such as vascular stents, orthopedic implants, heart valve cages, and more.
