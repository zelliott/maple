This paper reports the biochemical characterization of a purified and reconstituted two-component 3-ketosteroid 9alpha-hydroxylase (KSH). KSH of Rhodococcus rhodochrous DSM 43269, consisting of a ferredoxin reductase (KshB) and a terminal oxygenase (KshA), was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. E. coli cell cultures, expressing both KshA and KshB, converted 4-androstene-3,17-dione (AD) into 9alpha-hydroxy-4-AD (9OHAD) with a >60% molar yield over 48 h of incubation. Coexpression and copurification were critical to successfully obtain pure and active KSH. Biochemical analysis revealed that the flavoprotein KshB is an NADH-dependent reductase using flavin adenine dinucleotide as a cofactor. Reconstitution experiments confirmed that KshA, KshB, and NADH are essential for KSH activity with steroid substrates. KSH hydroxylation activity was inhibited by several divalent metal ions, especially by zinc. The reconstituted KSH displayed subtle steroid substrate specificity; a range of 3-ketosteroids, i.e., 5alpha-Eta, 5beta-Eta, Delta1, and Delta4 steroids, could act as KSH substrates, provided that they had a short side chain. The formation of 9OHAD from AD by KSH was confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis and by the specific enzymatic conversion of 9OHAD into 3-hydroxy-9,10-secoandrost-1,3,5(10)-triene-9,17-dione using 3-ketosteroid Delta1-dehydrogenase. Only a single KSH is encoded in the genome of the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, shown to be important for survival in macrophages. Since no human KSH homolog exists, the M. tuberculosis enzyme may provide a novel target for treatment of tuberculosis. Detailed knowledge about the biochemical properties of KSH thus is highly relevant in the research fields of biotechnology and medicine.
