The polymerase chain reaction-restricted fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method was used for both examining compatibility at the HLA-DQB1 gene locus and determining HLA-DQ antigen polymorphism in spouses of unexplained recurrent abortions. Genomic DNA samples were prepared from peripheral mononuclear cells from patient and control couples. Two hundred and thirty base pair fragments of the second exon of the HLA-DQB genes were selectively amplified. Amplified DNAs were digested with the restriction endonucleases, Fok I, Hae III, Hha I, Rsa I and Sau3A I, and subjected to electrophoresis in a polyacrylamide gel. The RFLPs showed that habitual aborters and their husbands had neither significantly frequent alleles nor shared common alleles at the HLA-DQB locus when compared to the control group. Since significant HLA-DQB compatibility was not observed between the spouses and unexplained recurrent aborters, in order to determine whether or not HLA compatibility is responsible for the genesis of unexplained recurrent abortions, it is imperative to further examine the compatibility between other HLA gene loci.
