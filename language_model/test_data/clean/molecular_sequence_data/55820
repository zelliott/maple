Keratin filament are characteristically present in epithelial cells and tumors, but have also been detected in many normal and neoplastic non-epithelial cell types using immunohistochemical techniques. To investigate the validity of this seemingly aberrant protein expression, we applied the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to study keratin gene expression in a variety of non-epithelial tissues. Total RNA was extracted from nine samples of leiomyosarcoma, four non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, seven normal bone marrows, normal lymph node, normal peripheral blood cells, freshly isolated and cultured endothelial cells, cultured skin fibroblasts, and the myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60. Amplification primers and probes for the three most primitive keratin types (8, 18, and 19) were synthesized using published gene sequences. RNA from the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, known to be rich in all three keratins, was used as positive control. Concurrently run actin primers were used to confirm RNA integrity. After an initial cycle with reverse transcriptase, PCR amplification was performed for 30 cycles. Southern blots of the PCR products showed variably intense bands corresponding to keratin 8 and 18 gene products in all samples, offering conclusive evidence of keratin gene expression in cells of both stromal and hematopoietic derivation. However, keratin 19 gene transcription was not nearly so ubiquitous, being detected in normal fibroblasts and endothelial cells, two of four non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and four of nine leiomyosarcoma, but not in normal lymph node, peripheral blood cells, HL-60 cells, or any of the seven normal bone marrows examined. Dilutional experiments showed PCR to be highly sensitive in the detection of keratin 19 gene expression, capable of registering one MCF-7 cell in 10(6) HL-60 cells. These studies show that variable levels of keratin 8 and 18 gene expression may be detected by PCR in a wide variety of non-epithelial tissues, supporting previous immunohistochemical and phylogenetic studies. However, keratin 19 gene expression appears to be more restricted and was not evident in any hematopoietic cells devoid of contaminating stromal elements. These findings suggest a role for PCR in the detection of epithelial micrometastasis in certain sites, particularly bone marrow.
