We have isolated a 2.5-kb DNA fragment from plasmid pST5R7 encoding a sucrose utilization system from Escherichia coli B-62 which confers a sucrose-fermenting phenotype to transformed E. coli K-12 strains. DNA-sequence determination revealed one full-length open reading frame 98% identical to cscA, the sucrose-hydrolase (invertase) gene of the csc regulon from E. coli EC3132. Functional characterization indicates that high-level expression and limited periplasmic release of invertase is responsible for the sucrose-fermenting capacity of transformed E. coli K-12 strains carrying cscA.
