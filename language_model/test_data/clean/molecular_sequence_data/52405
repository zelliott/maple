Argentine hemorrhagic fever is an often fatal human disease caused by Junin virus, an RNA-containing virus and member of the Arenavirus family. This virus was detected in vitro by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure. A pair of Junin virus-specific PCR DNA oligonucleotide primers and an oligonucleotide probe were designed from a known portion of the viral RNA sequence. RNA was isolated from Junin virus-infected monkey kidney cells and used to produce complementary DNA (cDNA) by reverse transcription. A DNA segment, 151 +/- 24 bp long, was amplified from this cDNA and characterized by agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern blot hybridization with the Junin virus-specific DNA probe. Sensitivity experiments showed that Junin virus could be detected with nanogram quantities of RNA isolated from virus-infected cells. The rapid and sensitive assay described here may contribute towards the development of a procedure for the early diagnosis of Argentine hemorrhagic fever.
