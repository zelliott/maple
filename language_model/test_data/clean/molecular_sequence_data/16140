Diarrhoea is a common event during typhoid fever; nevertheless, the possible participation of a diarrhoea-inducing enterotoxin has not been described (Roy et al., 1985). Recombinant bacteriophage lambda FDC1 was isolated from a genomic library of Salmonella typhi, the causal agent of typhoid fever, by screening with a probe for the B subunit gene of the heat-labile, cholera-like, Escherichia coli enterotoxin (LT). Lambda FDC1 codes for an enterotoxin that causes secretion in rat ileal loops, that elongates Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, that is recognized by antibodies against LT, and does not bind in vitro to ganglioside GM1. These results should allow further studies towards elucidating a possible role for the S. typhi enterotoxin in the pathogenesis of typhoid fever.
