The requirements for the DNA replication of the human papovavirus JC were analyzed using JC T-antigen as well as the T-antigens of the related viruses SV40 and BK. With all three T-antigens, the boundary of the core origin mapped on the early side to position 5093 of the viral genome. In conjunction with earlier studies, the core origin of DNA replication was therefore defined as a 68-bp region which, similar to the SV40 core origin, contains three major structural elements, early palindrome, T-antigen binding site II, and A/T-rich tract. Replication was stimulated by sequences flanking the core origin on the early side. Specifically, the stimulating sequences on the early side were identified as T-antigen binding site I. The degree to which flanking sequences were able to stimulate viral DNA replication was dependent on the T-antigen used in the experiment, with JC T-antigen relying most and BK T-antigen relying least on the flanking sequences. SV40 T-antigen showed an intermediate dependence. The same hierarchy was observed when replication activities were compared. BK T-antigen was more active in replicating DNA than SV40 T-antigen, which in turn was more effective than JC T-antigen. Dependence on flanking sequences is, thus, inversely correlated to the replicating activity of the respective T-antigen, showing that, in addition to the origin, the T-antigen contributes to the characteristics of JC virus DNA replication.
