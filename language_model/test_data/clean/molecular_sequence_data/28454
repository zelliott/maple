Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a 36 amino acid peptide amide isolated from porcine brain. The NPY analog, 4-norleucine-NPY was synthesized by a solid-phase method and purified to homogeneity in 20% yield by reverse-phase chromatography. Investigation of the biological properties indicated that the analog is an agonist of NPY. Secondary structural analyses revealed that NPY and the analog exhibited predominantly alpha-helical and beta-sheet structures, respectively; however, experiments in trifluoroethanol indicated that the analog has the potential of assuming an alpha-helical structure. Based on circular dichroism (CD), Raman spectroscopy and Chou-Fasman analyses, a model has been proposed for the secondary structure of NPY.
