Tomato cultivation in Brazil is threatened by a number of tomato-infecting viruses belonging to the genus Begomovirus of the family Geminiviridae. Here, we report the full DNA-A sequences of three Brazilian begomoviruses: a potentially new tomato-infecting viruses, tomato interveinal chlorosis virus (ToICV), and two previously proposed begomoviruses for which only partial DNA-A sequences are available in the databases: tomato mottle leaf curl virus (TMoLCV) and tomato golden vein virus (TGVV). The complete sequences of the DNA-B components of TMoLCV and TGVV and the DNA-A components of a number of tomato severe rugose virus variants are also presented. Collectively, all of the analyzed sequences were phylogenetically clustered within the two major groups of Brazilian tomato-infecting begomoviruses.
