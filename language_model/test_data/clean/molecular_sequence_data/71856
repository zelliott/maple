Two fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolases from the acido- and thermophilic red alga Galdieria sulphuraria were purified to apparent homogeneity and N-terminally microsequenced. Both aldolases had similar biochemical properties such as Km (FBP) (5.6-5.8 microM) and molecular masses of the native enzymes (165kDa) as determined by size exclusion chromatography. The subunit size of the purified aldolases, as determined by SDS-PAGE, was 42kDa for both aldolases. The isoenzymes were not inhibited by EDTA or affected by cysteine or potassium ions, implying that they belong to the class I group of aldolases, while other red algae are known to have one class I and one class II aldolase inhibited by EDTA. cDNA clones of the cytosolic and plastidic aldolases were isolated and sequenced. The gene for the cytosolic isoenzyme contained a 303bp untranslated leader sequence, while the gene for the plastidic isoenzyme exhibited a transit sequence of 56 amino-acid residues. Both isoenzymes showed about 48% homology in the deduced amino-acid sequences. A gene tree relates both aldolases to the basis of early eukaryotic class I aldolases. The phylogenetic relationship to other aldolases, particularly to cyanobacterial class II aldolases, is discussed.
