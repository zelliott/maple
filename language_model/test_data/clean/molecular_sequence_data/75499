Two cDNAs (pLM3c 4.1 and pLM3c 6.1) coding for rabbit cytochrome P450 3c were sequenced. cDNA 4.1 (1768 bp) exhibits an open reading frame from nucleotides 74 to 1576 encoding the 501 amino acid residues of the entire protein. cDNA 6.1 (189 bp) appears to encode the last 24 amino acids. Comparative amino acid sequence analysis indicated that P450 PCN1, PCN2, and HLp from rat and man, were 70, 67, and 73% homologous, respectively, to P450 3c. According to the cytochrome P450 nomenclature, the P450 3c gene is termed P450IIIA4. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences indicated that cDNA 6.1 was 100% homologous to cDNA 4.1. However, whereas a poly(A) tract started 23 nucleotides after the AATAAA consensus sequence in cDNA 6.1, cDNA 4.1 had a 3' untranslated region extending 101 bp beyond the polyadenylation signal, which lacked poly(A). This observation is consistent with the previous finding that both cDNA 4.1 and 6.1 hybridized with two distinct species of poly(A)RNA (1700 and 1850 bases) from rabbit liver. The extreme 3'-end 79-bp fragment of cDNA 4.1 therefore was isolated by subcloning in pUC12 (clone p18-Rsa I) and used to probe Northern blots of poly(A)RNA from control and rifampicin-treated rabbit liver. In contrast to cDNA 4.1 and 6.1, p18-Rsa I cDNA hybridized only with the largest (1850 bases) mRNA species. We conclude that rabbit liver contains two P450 3c mRNA species differing in the length of their 3' untranslated region.
