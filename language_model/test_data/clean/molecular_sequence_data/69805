CD spectra and melting curves were collected for a 28 base-pair DNA fragment in the form of a DNA dumbbell (linked on both ends by T4 single-strand loops) and the same DNA sequence in the linear form (without end loops). The central 16 base pairs (bp) of the 28-bp duplex region is the poly(pu) sequence: 5'-AGGAAGGAGGAAAGAG-3'. Mixtures of the dumbbell and linear DNAs with the 16-base single-strand sequence 5'-TCCTTCCTCCTTTCTC-3' were also prepared and studied. At 22 degrees C, CD measurements of the mixtures in 950 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 5.5, at a duplex concentration of 1.8 microM, provided evidence for triplex formation. Spectroscopic features of the triplexes formed with either a dumbbell or linear substrate were quite similar. Melting curves of the duplex molecules alone and in mixtures with the third strand were collected as a function of duplex concentration from 0.16 to 2.15 microM. Melting curves of the dumbbell alone and mixtures with the third strand were entirely independent of DNA concentration. In contrast, melting curves of the linear duplex alone or mixed with the third strand were concentration dependent. At identical duplex concentrations, the dumbbell alone melts approximately 20 degrees C higher than the linear duplex. The curve of the linear duplex displayed a significant pretransition probably due to end fraying. On melting curves of mixtures of the dumbbell or linear duplex with the third strand, a low temperature transition with much lower relative hyperchromicity change (approximately 5%) was observed. This transition was attributed to the melting of a new molecular species, e.g., the triplex formed between the duplex and single-strand DNA molecules. In the case of the dumbbell/single-strand mixture, these melting transitions of the triplex and the dumbbell were entirely resolvable. In contrast, the melting transitions of the linear duplex and the triplex overlapped, thereby preventing their clear distinction. To analyze the data, a three-state equilibrium model is presented. The analysis utilizes differences in relative absorbance vs temperature curves of dumbbells (or linear molecules) alone and in mixtures with the third strand.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
