Echovirus 18 (EV18) is one of the echovirus serotypes associated with human diseases and in particular aseptic meningitis. To facilitate studies of the molecular epidemiology of EV18 and the evolution of enteroviruses in general, the complete nucleotide (nt) sequence was determined for the echovirus 18 prototype strain (Metcalf, EV18M). Excluding the poly A sequence, the genome consists of 7410 nt divided into a 740 nt 5' untranslated region (5' UTR), a 6567 nt long open reading frame coding for a 2189 amino acid (aa) polyprotein and a 103 nt 3' UTR. Molecular analysis of the EV18M genome showed a typical enterovirus-like organization. Phylogenetic analysis of the structural and non-structural genes revealed a pattern of different relationships to other echo- and coxsackieviruses. Similarity analysis demonstrated that the Hill strain of echovirus 9 is most likely the result of a previous recombination event between ancestors of the echovirus 9 strain Barty (5' half of the genome) and EV18M (3' half). Using a maximum likelihood approach, the recombination point was mapped to the 2C gene.
