Phosphoribulokinase (PRK) was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from Synechococcus PCC7942 with high specific activity. Molecular masses of the native enzyme and its subunit were 178 and 42 kDa, respectively. Cys-17 and Cys-38 were conserved in the cyanobacterial PRK, but 18 amino acid residues between them were missing among the 40 residues found in higher plant PRKs.
