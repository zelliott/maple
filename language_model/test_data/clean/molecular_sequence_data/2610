The very limited development of antiparasitic agents targeting protein synthesis stems in part from the belief that parasite and host ribosomes are sufficiently similar to preclude selective toxicity. However, recent studies have revealed that Giardia lamblia rRNA has an unusual size and sequence; consequently, this organism and its homogeneous rRNA provide a useful model for the development of protein synthesis inhibitors with antiparasitic activity. In this study, I determined the sequence and secondary structure of the 3' end of the small-subunit RNA, the target for aminoglycoside inhibitory activity. The primary structure of these 140 nucleotides includes two blocks of sequence highly conserved among other organisms; the remaining sequence, although not conserved, can be folded into a secondary structure common to all rRNAs. The presence of U-1495 within one of the conserved blocks predicts hygromycin susceptibility. Also, a specific base pair (C-1409.G-1491) implicated in paromomycin susceptibility is present; whereas all procaryotes have this base pair, it is absent in many eucaryotes (including mammals). Conversely, kanamycin and apramycin resistance can be predicted from substitution of A-1408 with G. A growth inhibition assay was used to test the susceptibility of G. lamblia to a variety of aminoglycosides. After 48 h, 8 of 11 aminoglycosides tested failed to inhibit growth at a concentration of 200 micrograms/ml. Paromomycin and hygromycin, however, inhibited growth of three strains tested by 50% at 50 to 60 micrograms/ml and by close to 90% at 120 micrograms/ml. These results correlate well with the sequence and secondary-structure analyses. Paromomycin may be clinically useful when the toxicity of standard antigiardial drugs is of concern.
