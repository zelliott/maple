The rifampin resistance of Mycobacterium leprae is due to missense mutations in the rpoB gene encoding the beta-subunit of the essential enzyme RNA polymerase. A rapid and very simple method has been developed to detect rifampin resistance in small numbers of M. leprae present in biopsies. It involves polymerase chain reaction amplification of a defined region of the rpoB gene followed by single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis (PCR-SSCP). The reliability of the method has been tested on a sample of known drug-resistant and susceptible isolates of M. leprae.
