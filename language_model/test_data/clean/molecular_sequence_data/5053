The membrane lipids of free living and bacteroid forms of Bradyrhizobium japonicum, obtained from nodules occupied by both typed and untyped bacteria, were isolated and characterized by a combination of NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and other chemical and physical methods. These studies indicated that both the free living and bacteroid forms of this organism contain glycolipids almost exclusively of the type found in plant cells. In the bacteroid forms, there was a dramatic shift towards the synthesis of digalactosyl diacylglycerol as the major lipid. This glycolipid has rarely been found outside of the plant kingdom and photosynthetic bacteria, and its occurrence in the bacteroid form of a plant symbiont is therefore remarkable. The presence of plant cell and organelle contaminants in the bacteroid preparations was ruled out by scanning electron microscopy, Southern blot analyses for plant DNA using specific gene probes, and chemical analyses for plant marker steroids, steroid glycosides, and cerebrosides. Digalactosyl diacylglycerol is not found in the plasma membrane of plant cells (of which the peribacteroid membrane is an extension) but is thought to be restricted to plastids. This result follows our earlier finding that the other predominant plant glycolipid, sulfoquinivosyl diacylglycerol, is a membrane component of fast growing Rhizobia and is found even when cells are cultivated in free culture where there is no question of plant contamination. The near absence of these lipids in the membranes of bacteria outside of this special group of organisms and photosynthetic bacteria suggests that the trait could have been passed on through gene transfer from plants to the bacteria at some point during the development of their symbiotic relationship. In the case of digalactosyl diacylglycerol, there is also the possibility that some common biosynthetic intermediates are used by both the plant and the bacteria. This is a striking parallel with some host-pathogen interactions.
