IFN-gamma is a key immunoregulatory cytokine that plays a predominant role in innate immunity. By employing PCR-Select to search for genes differentially expressed in IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha stimulated macrophages, we identified a novel IFN-gamma-induced transcript designated PUMA-G (protein up-regulated in macrophages by IFN-gamma). PUMA-G codes for a protein with seven transmembrane helices, a feature commonly shared with the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily (GPCR). The PUMA-G protein is most similar to the human orphan GPCR HM74 (73 % identity) and GPR31 (30 % identity). PUMA-G mRNA was readily induced in macrophages after stimulation with IFN-gamma, LPS, polyIC and CpG oligonucleotides. In vivo PUMA-G was up-regulated in mice suffering from microbial sepsis or from Listeria monocytogenes infection. Characterization of the genomic locus revealed an intronless PUMA-G open reading frame. Genomic Southern blot analysis indicates that PUMA-G is a single-copy gene. PUMA-G maps to mouse chromosome 5F. Confocal microscopy of transiently transfected 264.7 RAW macrophages and 293T cells with a PUMA-G-EGFP fusion construct showed predominant fluorescence at the cell surface, suggesting a localization at the cell membrane. Taken together, our data indicate that PUMA-G is a new inducible representative of GPCR, with potential importance in macrophage functions.
