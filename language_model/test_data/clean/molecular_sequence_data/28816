A cDNA clone exclusively induced by aluminum (Al) was isolated from root apices of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by the differential display method. The predicted amino acid sequence exhibited homology to the multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins that is known as a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein superfamily. Thus this gene was named TaMDR1 (Triticum aestivum MDR). TaMDR1 was induced as a function of Al concentration in the range from 5 to 50 microM, which is in the range of Al content in natural acid soil environment. The concentration required for the induction was lower in the Al-sensitive cultivar than in the Al-tolerant cultivar, indicating that the accumulation of TaMDR1 mRNA was associated with the events caused by Al toxicity rather than Al tolerance. TaMDR1 was significantly induced by the exposure to lanthanum, gadolinium and ruthenium red, which are known as inhibitors of calcium channels. Furthermore, decreasing of calcium ion in growth medium caused stimulation of the gene expression. These results suggested that the induction of TaMDR1 is caused by the breaking of calcium homeostasis which occurred at early stage of Al toxicity.
