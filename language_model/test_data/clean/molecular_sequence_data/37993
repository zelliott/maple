Genetic relationships between 35 clinical isolates of coxsackievirus A9 (CAV9), collected during the last five decades from different geographical regions, were investigated by partial sequencing. Analysis of a 150 nucleotide sequence at the VP1/2A junction region identified 12 CAV9 genotypes. While most of the strains within each genotype showed geographical clustering, the analysis also provided evidence for long-range importation of virus strains. Phylogenetic analysis of a longer region around the VP1/2A junction (approximately 390 nucleotides) revealed that the designated genotypes actually represented phylogenetic lineages. The phylogenetic grouping pattern of the isolates in the analysis of the VP4/VP2 region was similar to that obtained in the VP1/2A region whereas analysis of the 3D region indicated a strikingly different grouping, which suggests that recombination events may occur in the region encoding the nonstructural proteins. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of the VP1 polypeptide demonstrated that the RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid) motif, implicated in the interaction of the virus with integrin, was fully conserved among the isolates.
