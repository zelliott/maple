We have determined the complete nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the Polish Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) isolate marked as PepMV-PK. The PepMV-PK genome consists of a single positive-sense RNA strand of 6412-nucleotide-long that contains five open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes the putative viral polymerase (RdRp), ORFs 2-4 the triple gene block (TGB 1-3), and ORF5-coat protein CP. Two short untranslated regions flank the coding ones and there is a poly (A) tail at the 3' end of the genomic RNA. Thus, the genome organization of PepMV-PK is that of a typical member of the genus Potexvirus. Phylogenetic analysis based on full-length genomes of PepMV sequences showed that PepMV-PK was most closely related to the Ch2 isolate from Chile. Comparison of PepMV-PK and Ch2 showed the following nucleotide identities: 98% for the RdRp, 99% for the CP genes, and 98, 99, and 98% for the TGB1, TGB2, and TBG3, respectively. This high level of nucleotide sequence identity between the Chilean and Polish PepMV-PK isolates suggest their common origin.
