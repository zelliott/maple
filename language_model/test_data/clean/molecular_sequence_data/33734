The terminal complement components (TCCs) of mammals, C6, C7, C8alpha, C8beta, and C9, are a group of serum proteins involved in the cytolytic killing of microbial pathogens. The mammalian TCCs share a unique core domain structure and were probably generated by the duplication of the ancestral TCC gene and subsequent addition and/or deletion of the N- and C-terminal domains. Proteins and genes for all the TCCs have been identified from bony fish. In contrast, no TCC gene has been identified from cyclostome lamprey using whole-genome shotgun-sequence analysis and liver EST analysis. To clarify the evolutionary origin of TCCs, we performed degenerate RT-PCR and RACE analyses of the cartilaginous fish liver and identified the C6 gene from a shark, Mustelus manazo, and the C8B gene from a chimaera, Chimaera phantasma. The presence of the C6 gene in shark suggests that one of the most crucial steps in the establishment of the cytolytic complement pathway, the addition of the FIM and CCP domains to the primitive TCC, occurred in a common ancestor of the jawed vertebrates. These results also indicate that the gene duplications among TCCs occurred at an early stage of the jawed vertebrate evolution.
