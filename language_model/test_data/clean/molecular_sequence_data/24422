As an important cytokine of the immune system, interleukin-2 (IL-2) can induce the expression of various genes, one of which is the tumor necrosis factor-beta (TNF-beta). However, the induction mechanism of TNF-beta remains to be fully explored. We have previously shown JAK-STAT pathway mediates TNF-beta gene induction upon IL-2 stimulation through an upstream -200GAS element. In this study, we further demonstrated that there is another essential -130EBS element in TNF-beta gene promoter region. Using IL-2-dependent cell line BAF/BO3beta, we found that this -130EBS element can form a specific complex with nuclear protein, which contained a novel ETS transcription factor. Furthermore, using kinase inhibitors, we revealed that p38 MAP kinase is involved in the formation of -130EBS-protein complex and the subsequent transcriptional activation of TNF-beta gene in response to IL-2 stimulation. Taken together, our results suggested that the complicated IL-2 induction of TNF-beta gene expression requires not only the activation of JAK-STAT pathway on the -200GAS element, but also the cooperation of another signal pathway on the -130EBS element.
