We have recently shown that mutations in oligophrenin-1 (OPHN1) are responsible for non-specific X-linked mental retardation (MRX). The structure of the gene encoding the OPHN1 protein was determined by isolation of genomic DNA clones from the human cosmid library. Genomic fragments containing exons were sequenced, and the sequences of the exons and flanking introns were defined. Knowledge of the genomic structure of the OPHN1 gene, which spans at least 500 kb and consists of 25 exons, will facilitate the search for additional mutations in OPHN1. OPHN1 was screened for mutations in 164 subjects with non-specific mental retardation. Three nucleotide substitutions were identified, one of which was a silent mutation in the codon threonine 301 at position 903 (G-->C). The other substitutions were located in exon 2, a G-->A substitution at position 133 (A45T), and in exon 10, a C-->T substitution at position 902 (T301M), but these are common polymorphisms rather than disease-causing mutations.
