Tol2 is a transposable element of the terminal-inverted-repeat class, residing in the genome of the medaka fish Oryzias latipes. The genus Oryzias contains more than 10 species for which phylogenetic relationships have previously been estimated. To infer the history of Tol2 in this genus we performed genomic Southern blots and PCR analyses of 10 of the species. It was revealed that Tol2 occurs in 2 of the 10 species (O. curvinotus and O. latipes) and that the length and the restriction map structure of Tol2 are identical in the two cases. Further, sequencing analysis revealed an extremely low level of divergence compared with that in a nuclear gene. These results suggest recent incorporation of Tol2 into one or both of the two species, implying horizontal transfer of Tol2 from one species to the other or into them both from a common source.
