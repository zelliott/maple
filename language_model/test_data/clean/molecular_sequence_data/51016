Animals bearing a cachexia-inducing tumour, the MAC16 adenocarcinoma, showed a progressive decrease in blood glucose levels with increasing weight loss, while animals bearing a histologically similar tumour, the MAC13 adenocarcinoma, showed no change in either body weight or blood glucose levels with growth of the tumour. The effect of the MAC16 tumour on blood glucose levels appeared to be unrelated to food intake, glucose consumption by the tumour, or to the production of increased levels of IGF-I and IGF-II mRNA by the tumour cells. The relationship between the induction of cachexia and alteration in blood glucose levels remains unknown.
