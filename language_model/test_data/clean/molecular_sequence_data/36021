Eight new analogs of cecropin A, two new analogs of melittin and 30 hybrid peptides containing sequences from cecropins and melittin have been synthesized. The lengths of the peptides have varied from 37 residues (the length of cecropin A) to 18 residues. The peptides have been assayed for lysis of sheep red blood cells and for antibacterial activity against two Gram negative and three Gram positive bacteria. The best analogs of cecropin A maintained the anti-Escherichia coli activity of the parental peptide, and were not lytic for red blood cells. Melittin and its replacement analogs were all lytic for red blood cells, but an analog with transposed segments was not. Several of the hybrid peptides were found to be both non-hemolytic and highly active against all test bacteria. The data were used to define the structural requirements for antibacterial activity.
