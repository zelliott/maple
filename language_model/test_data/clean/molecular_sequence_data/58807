Fibromodulin has been isolated from bovine and equine articular cartilage and the attached keratan sulphate chains subjected to digestion by keratanase II. The oligosaccharides generated have been reduced and subsequently isolated by strong anion-exchange chromatography. Their structures have been determined by high-field 1H-NMR spectroscopy and high-pH anion-exchange chromatography. Both alpha(2-6)- and alpha(2-3)-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid have been found in the capping oligosaccharides, and, fucose which is alpha(1-3)-linked to N-acetylglucosamine has been found as a branch in both repeat region and capping oligosaccharides. These data demonstrate that there are fundamental differences between the structures present in the N-linked keratan sulphate chains attached to fibromodulin from articular cartilage and those from tracheal cartilage, which lack both alpha(2-6)-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid and alpha(1-3)-linked fucose. It has been confirmed that the keratan sulphate chains are short, being only eight or nine disaccharides in length. Very significant differences in the levels of galactose sulphation have been identified at the non-reducing end of the chain. The galactose residue adjacent to the non-reducing cap is sulphated in only 1-3% of chains, compared with a sulphation level of over 40% closer to the reducing end. This highlights the difference between the chain termini and the repeat region in terms of structure and points to the potential for functional importance. The repeat region and capping fragments of the N-linked keratan sulphates from bovine and equine articular cartilage fibromodulin have been found to have the following general structure: NeuAc-(alpha 2-3/6)Gal[6SO3-](beta 1-4)GlcNAc6SO3-(beta 1-3)Gal[6SO3-] (beta 1-4)¿[Fuc(alpha 1-3)]0-1GlcNAc6SO3-(beta 1-3)Gal-[6SO3-](beta 1-4)¿ 6-7GlcNAc6SO3-.
