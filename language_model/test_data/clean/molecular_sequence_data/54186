Two unchlorinated drinking water supplies were investigated to assess the potential of water treatment and distribution systems to support the growth of Legionella spp. The treatment plant for supply A distributed treated groundwater with a low concentration (<0.5 ppm of C) of natural organic matter (NOM), and the treatment plant for supply B distributed treated groundwater with a high NOM concentration (8 ppm of C). In both supplies, the water temperature ranged from about 10°C after treatment to 18°C during distribution. The concentrations of Legionella spp. in distributed water, analyzed with quantitative PCR (Q-PCR), averaged 2.9 (± 1.9) × 10(2) cells liter(-1) in supply A and 2.5 (± 1.6) × 10(3) cells liter(-1) in supply B. No Legionella was observed with the culture method. A total of 346 clones (96 operational taxonomical units [OTUs] with ≥97% sequence similarity) were retrieved from water and biofilms of supply A and 251 (43 OTUs) from supply B. The estimation of the average value of total species richness (Chao1) in supply A (153) was clearly higher than that for supply B (58). In each supply, about 77% of the sequences showed <97% similarity to described species. Sequences related to L. pneumophila were only incidentally observed. The Legionella populations of the two supplies are divided into two distinct clusters based on distances in the phylogenetic tree as fractions of the branch length. Thus, a large variety of mostly yet-undescribed Legionella spp. proliferates in unchlorinated water supplies at temperatures below 18°C. The lowest concentration and greatest diversity were observed in the supply with the low NOM concentration.
