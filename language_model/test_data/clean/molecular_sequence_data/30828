Peptide synthesis catalysed by papain was studied using thio-alpha-amino acids (S-acids) as a carboxyl component. It was found, for example, that with Z-AlaSH (pK 2.70) the maximal yield of the peptide Z-AlaValNH2 was obtained at pH 8-8.5. A two-fold excess of Z-AlaSH furnished peptides with yields close to 100%. Thio-amino acids with bulky side groups, for example, Z-IleSH, Z-Asp(OBu')SH, gave peptides with a low yield. Papain interacts with Z-AlaSH better than do bromelain or ficin.
