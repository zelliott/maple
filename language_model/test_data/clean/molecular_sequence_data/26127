A set of 5' promoter deletions from Zmg13, a genomic clone of a pollen-specific gene of maize, has been transcriptionally fused to a beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in the binary vector pBI101. Tobacco leaf disks were transformed and mature plants analyzed for GUS activity directed by the Zmg13 promoter constructs. Transgenic plants containing the 375 bp Zmg13 sequence from -314 to +61 relative to the transcription start site transcribed GUS RNA and expressed active GUS enzyme in mature pollen but not in leaves. Plants transformed with a 35S CaMV promoter-GUS transcriptional fusion expressed GUS RNA in leaves but not in pollen. Neither GUS RNA or active enzyme could be detected in pollen or leaves from plants containing a 124 bp Zmg13-GUS transcriptional fusion missing the putative Zmg13 TATA box. No GUS RNA or enzyme expression was not detected in non-transformed tobacco. RNA and GUS histochemical analysis of the T1 generation confirmed that the temporal expression pattern of Zmg13-GUS transcription in tobacco followed that of the native gene in maize and that the Zmg13 promoter sequences from the maize gene are able correctly to direct genetically stable, tissue-specific gene expression in transgenic tobacco plants.
