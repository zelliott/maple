Activation of the ERK mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway has been implicated in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and senescence. In this pathway, the MAP kinases ERK1/ERK2 are phosphorylated and activated by the dual-specificity kinases MEK1 and MEK2, which in turn are activated by serine phosphorylation by a number of MAP kinase kinase kinases. We report here the chromosomal localization of the human genes encoding the MAP kinase kinase isoforms MEK1 and MEK2. Using a combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization, somatic cell hybrid analysis, DNA sequencing and yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clone analysis, we have mapped the MEK1 gene (MAP2K1) to chromosome 15q21. We also present evidence for the presence of a MEK1 pseudogene on chromosome 8p21. The MEK2 gene (MAP2K2) was mapped to chromosome 7q32 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and YAC clone analysis.
