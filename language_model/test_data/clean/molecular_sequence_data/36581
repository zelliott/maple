The short segments of cDNA encoding glycoprotein (GP)Ib alpha, GPIIb, GPIIIa and platelet factor (PF) 4 were amplified using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in order to characterize various types of megakaryoblasts. Cell lines with megakaryocytic features (K562, CMK and HEL) were tested. GPIb alpha, GPIIb and GPIIIa mRNAs were found to be present in K562, CMK and HEL cells, while only HEL cells expressed PF4 or mRNA. These results suggested that megakaryoblastic cell lines could be categorized into two groups, one with the PF4 transcript and the other without it. PF4 mRNA was present in the cells obtained from one Down's syndrome patient with transient myeloproliferative disorder and in one patient with primary myelofibrosis and megakaryoblastosis. On the other hand, one patient with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia transformed from refractory anemia had a poor prognosis with megakaryoblastic leukemia cells which expressed no PF4 mRNA. These observations suggested that the expression of PF4 mRNA in peripheral blood megakaryoblasts may indicate the absence of a true leukemic process.
