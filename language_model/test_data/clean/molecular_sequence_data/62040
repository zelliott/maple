The Hox genes are a family of homeodomain-containing transcription factors that confer positional identity during development. Although their regulation and function have been extensively studied, very little is known of their downstream target genes. Here we show that Hoxb4 directly induces the expression of FLASH in the notochord of embryos after neurulation. FLASH is a component of the FAS-CAPSASE8 apoptotic pathway, and blocking its activity, or that of Hoxb4, prevents apoptosis in the notochord.
