Two yellow-pigmented bacterial strains, JS6-6(T) and JS17-8(T), isolated from soil samples from Jeju, Republic of Korea, were studied to determine their taxonomic positions. The cells of the two bacteria were aerobic, Gram-negative, non-motile, straight rods. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that both isolates should be placed in the genus Chryseobacterium of the family Flavobacteriaceae. Their 16S rRNA gene sequences showed similarities of 93.7-97.5 % to those of type strains of the genus Chryseobacterium. The values for DNA-DNA relatedness between both strains and type strains of closely related Chryseobacterium species were below 34 %. The fatty acids of the novel strains were similar to those of species of the genus Chryseobacterium. Both strains had MK-6 as the predominant respiratory quinone. The DNA G+C contents of strains JS6-6(T) and JS17-8(T) were 39.9 and 41.4 mol%, respectively. Phylogenetic evidence, together with the DNA-DNA relatedness values and phenotypic characteristics, indicated that strains JS6-6(T) and JS17-8(T) represent two novel species of the genus Chryseobacterium, for which the names Chryseobacterium soli sp. nov. and Chryseobacterium jejuense sp. nov., respectively, are proposed. The type strains of Chryseobacterium soli sp. nov. and Chryseobacterium jejuense sp. nov. are JS6-6(T) (=KACC 12502(T)=DSM 19298(T)) and JS17-8(T) (=KACC 12501(T)=DSM 19299(T)), respectively.
