A pentasaccharide repeating unit of the O-antigen of Hafnia alvei has been synthesized in a concise manner. High yielding glycosylation steps and minimum number of protecting group manipulation steps are the key features of this synthesis. A two-step, one-pot phase transfer oxidation protocol has been applied for the preparation of D-galacturonic acid.
