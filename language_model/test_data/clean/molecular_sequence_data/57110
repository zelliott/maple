The structural protein ankyrin functions in red blood cells to link the spectrin-based membrane skeleton to the plasma membrane. Ankyrin proteins are now known to occur in most cell types, and two distinct ankyrin genes have been identified (erythroid (Ank-1) and brain (Ank-2)). We have characterized transcripts of the mouse erythroid ankyrin gene by cDNA cloning and DNA sequencing. Ank-1 transcripts of 7.5 and 9.0 kilobases are found in erythroid tissues, and a 9.0-kilobase transcript is found in cerebellum. RNA hybridization blot analysis of 13 additional mouse tissues has detected four novel Ank-1 transcripts (5.0, 3.5, 2.0, and 1.6 kilobases in size). Sequencing of Ank-1 cDNA clones isolated from mouse reticulocyte, spleen, and cerebellar libraries has identified (i) multiple 5' ends that indicate possible multiple promoters; (ii) alternative polyadenylation sites that probably account for the 7.5- and 9.0-kilobase size difference; (iii) a variety of small insertions and deletions that could produce transcripts (and ultimately proteins) of nearly identical size, but different functions; and (iv) clones with large deletions of coding sequence that account for the smaller transcripts seen in spleen, skeletal muscle, and heart.
