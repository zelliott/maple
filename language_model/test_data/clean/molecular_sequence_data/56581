The E2A/PBX1 and the BCR/ABL fusion genes result from the t(1;19)(q23;p13) and the t(9;22)(q34;q11), respectively, and encode oncoproteins which are thought to play an important role in the development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) subtypes associated with adverse prognosis. The use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of these genetic rearrangements may offer advantages over cytogenetic techniques which are often unsatisfactory in patients with ALL and, furthermore, provide a useful tool for monitoring of residual disease. However, it has not yet been evaluated whether the employment of PCR at the time of diagnosis improves the detection rate of these clinically relevant genetic anomalies. We have developed a multiprimer-PCR protocol which facilitates the detection of each of the four chimeric E2A/PBX1 and BCR/ABL mRNAs in a single reaction. This protocol was used for the evaluation of bone-marrow or blood samples from 251 children with ALL in whom cytogenetic analyses had been performed. Of the 251 patients, 221 had a B-cell precursor immunophenotype. In this group, 21 patients (9.5%) carrying the E2A/PBX1 rearrangement and three patients (1.4%) with BCR/ABL transcripts were detected by PCR. Twelve of these cases had escaped the detection by conventional cytogenetic analysis. In two of 12 patients with a typical t(1;19)(q23;p13), no E2A/PBX1 transcripts were identified by PCR, thus suggesting the presence of different molecular rearrangements. Residual leukemic cells were detected by PCR in five of eight patients who were followed during complete clinical remission. The frontline use of PCR has an important impact on the timely diagnosis, therapeutic decisions, and monitoring of high-risk patients with B-cell precursor leukemia who carry the E2A/PBX1 or BCR/ABL fusion genes.
