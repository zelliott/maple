In Toxoplasma gondii, lactate dehydrogenase is encoded by two independent and developmentally regulated genes LDH1 and LDH2. These genes and their products have been implicated in the control of a metabolic flux during parasite differentiation. To investigate the significance of LDH1 and LDH2 in this process, we generated stable transgenic parasite lines in which the expression of these two expressed isoforms of lactate dehydrogenase was knocked down in a stage-specific manner. These LDH knockdown parasites exhibited variable growth rates in either the tachyzoite or the bradyzoite stage, as compared with the parental parasites. Their differentiation processes were impaired when the parasites were grown under in vitro conditions. In vivo studies in a murine model system revealed that tachyzoites of these parasite lines were unable to form significant numbers of tissue cysts and to establish a chronic infection. Most importantly, all mice that were initially infected with tachyzoites of either of the four LDH knockdown lines survived a subsequent challenge with tachyzoites of the parental parasites (10(4)), a dose that usually causes 100% mortality, suggesting that live vaccination of mice with the LDH knockdown tachyzoites can confer protection against T. gondii. Thus, we conclude that LDH expression is essential for parasite differentiation. The knockdown of LDH1 and LDH2 expression gave rise to virulence-attenuated parasites that were unable to exhibit a significant brain cyst burden in a murine model of chronic infection.
