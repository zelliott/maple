Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha) is secreted into the medium of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus-transformed 3T3 cell line, 3B11-1C. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we have amplified, cloned and sequenced a cDNA fragment from this cell line which encodes the full protein-coding region of the mouse TGF alpha precursor. The deduced amino acid sequence (159 residues) differs from that of human TGF alpha at 13 sites and from that of rat at 3 sites. In the mouse, TGF alpha transcripts were detected in a variety of normal adult tissues including two previously unreported sites: the preputial glands and the bladder.
