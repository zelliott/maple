Factor H is a major regulatory protein of the complement system. The complete cDNA coding sequence has been derived from overlapping clones, and a polymorphism at base 1277 has been characterized. In four clones there is a T at nucleotide 1277 and in two others there is a C. This T/C change represents a tyrosine/histidine polymorphism at position 384 in the derived amino acid sequence. Protein sequence studies on peptides generated by trypsin digestion of factor H, purified from pooled plasma from 12 donors, confirmed the presence of both tyrosine and histidine at this position. Tyrosine and histidine were observed in a ratio of 2:1, respectively, and therefore this polymorphism is likely to represent a sequence difference between the two most abundant charge variants, FH1 and FH2, of factor H.
