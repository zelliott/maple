A clone MA2C4 encoding the murine homologue of adrenoceptor alpha 2C4 was identified, amplified and purified from a mouse genomic library (EMBL-3). The Pstl-EcoRl digested fragment (2409 base pairs) of the clone contains the nucleotide sequence encoding a putative receptor protein (458 amino acids), which is highly homologous in the transmembrane and G protein-coupling domains to the human and rat isoceptors. The 5' untranslated region (0.4kb) is characterized by high GC content and CpG island count whereas a polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) is located 481 base pairs downstream from the termination codon in the 3' untranslated region (0.6kb).
