The crystal structure of the 2:1 complex of cyclomaltohexaose (alpha-cyclodextrin, alpha-CD) with isosorbide dinitrate was determined by single-crystal X-ray analysis. In the crystal with the space group C2, two cyclomaltohexaose molecules form a head-to-head dimer with the secondary hydroxy-group sides facing each other. The dimer unit is stacked along the crystallographic c-axis to form a channel-type structure. The isosorbide dinitrate molecule is encapsulated in the cylindrical cavity of the cyclomaltohexaose dimer. The dimeric structure exhibits pseudo twofold symmetry, and the guest molecule is disordered on the local symmetry axis. The isosorbide moiety is located at the center of the dimer cavity, and the nitrate groups penetrate into the cyclomaltohexaose rings. The guest molecule modulates the dimer structure to attain the most stable accommodation into the cavity. The cyclomaltohexaose molecules are laterally shifted away from each other to create the cavity fitted to the shape of the guest molecule. As the result, the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between secondary hydroxy-groups are not fully formed, but the dimeric structure is stabilized by the interaction with the guest molecule.
