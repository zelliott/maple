The PCR-RFLP method previously reported by Inoko is a powerful technique for HLA class II typing. The reliability of RFLP interpretation depends on complete digestion by restriction endonucleases using a modified primer with restriction sites as an internal digestion control. The use of restriction enzymes which recognize specific HLA DQB allelic variations makes HLA DQB genotyping possible.
