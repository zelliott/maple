Adenovirus (Ad) vectors for gene therapy are made replication defective by deletion of E1 region genes. For isolation, propagation, and large-scale production of such vectors, E1 functions are supplied in trans from a stable cell line. Virtually all Ad vectors used for clinical studies are produced in the 293 cell, a human embryonic kidney cell line expressing E1 functions from an integrated segment of the left end of the Ad type 5 (Ad5) genome. Replication-competent vector variants that have regained E1 sequences have been observed within populations of Ad vectors grown on 293 cells. These replication-competent variants presumably result from recombination between vector and 293 cell Ad5 sequences. We have developed Ad2-based vectors and have characterized at the molecular level examples of replication-competent variants. All such variants analyzed are Ad2-Ad5 chimeras in which the 293 cell Ad5 E1 sequences have become incorporated into the viral genome by legitimate recombination events. A map of Ad5 sequences within the 293 cell genome developed in parallel is consistent with the proposed recombination events. To provide a convenient vector production system that circumvents the generation of replication-competent variants, we have modified the Ad2 vector backbone by deleting or rearranging the protein IX coding region normally present downstream from the E1 region such that the frequency of recombination between vector and 293 cell Ad5 sequences is greatly reduced. Twelve serial passages of an Ad2 vector lacking the protein IX gene were carried out without generating replication-competent variants. In the course of producing and testing more than 30 large-scale preparations of vectors lacking the protein IX gene or having a rearranged protein IX gene, only three examples of replication-competent variants were observed. Use of these genome modifications allows use of conventional 293 cells for production of large-scale preparations of Ad-based vectors lacking replication-competent variants.
