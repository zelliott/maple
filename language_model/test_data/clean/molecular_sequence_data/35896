Rat pituitary cDNAs encoding the full peptide coding sequence of the rat gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor were isolated and characterized. The deduced amino acid sequence encodes a protein of 327 residues with seven putative transmembrane domains characteristic of the family of G-protein coupled receptors. It is 95% identical at the amino acid level with the mouse gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor. An mRNA of 4.5 Kb was identified in the rat pituitary, ovary, and testis, and in murine alpha T3 cells. In addition, a larger mRNA species of 5.0-5.5 Kb was present in these rat tissues, and a smaller mRNA species of 1.8 Kb was present in the rat pituitary and ovary, and in alpha T3 cells. The receptor mRNA levels were increased in the female rat pituitary after ovariectomy compared to levels in intact female rats.
