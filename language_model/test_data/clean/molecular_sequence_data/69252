The nucleotide sequence of the swine apoA-I gene (encoding apolipoprotein) has been determined. The structure of the gene is similar to that of the human gene, and the exons exhibit a high degree of homology with those of the human gene. The porcine apoA-I gene is located adjacent to the apoC-III gene, as in humans.
