A gene (egl1) encoding an endoglucanase (EGL1) from Trichoderma longibrachiatum has been cloned and sequenced. This gene, homologous to the T. reesei egl1 gene, differs from it in the length of the introns (particularly the first one) and encoded protein. A cDNA fragment obtained by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends method, which takes advantage of the polymerase chain reaction, has been expressed in yeast under control of the cyc-gal inducible promoter and yeast clones able to secrete active enzyme have been obtained.
