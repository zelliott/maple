Based on the experimental evidence that gp120 subunit vaccine did not protect individuals from HIV-1 infection, we suggested that epitope-vaccines of HIV-1 gp41 may be a new strategy to induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1, and characterised immunogenicity of epitope-vaccines. Two epitopes, RILAVERYLKD-epitope (aa586-596) on the N-domain and ELDKWA-epitope (aa669-674) on the C-domain of gp41, were demonstrated by us and others to induce protective activity. After vaccination course, the RILAVERYLKD-dimer epitope-vaccine [C(RILAVERYLKDG)2-BSA] induced strong epitope-specific antibody response by about 1:25,600 dilution, and the ELDKWA-tetramer epitope-vaccine [C-(ELDKWAG)4-BSA] could yet induce strong antibody response to ELDKWA-epitope by 1:12,800-25,600 dilution of antisera in mice, while rgp41 subunit vaccine induced very weak antibody response to both epitopes (1:400). In rabbit experiments, the titres of ELDKWA-epitope-specific antibody induced by ELDKWA-epitope-vaccine [C-(ELDKWAG)4-BSA] reached to 1:6,400, while rgp41 subunit vaccine induced very weak antibody response to this epitope and to P1 and P2 peptides (1:400). Moreover, the ELDKWA-epitope-specific antibodies in mice and rabbit antisera induced by epitope-vaccine could very strongly interact with P2 peptide sequence-corresponding to the C-domain of gp41 (dilution by 1:25,600), and the RILAVERYLKD-epitope-specific antibodies in mice antisera induced by epitope-vaccine could also very strongly interact with P1 peptide sequence-corresponding to the N-domain of gp41 (dilution by 1:102,400). All these results provided experimental evidence that epitope-vaccine may be a new general strategy to induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 or other viruses.
