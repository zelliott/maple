Overexpression and point mutation of the p53 protein/gene was investigated in a series of chondrosarcoma by an immunohistochemical approach, and direct sequencing of the genomic DNA, respectively. In 2 of the 16 cases studied, both of which were high grade chondrosarcomas (grade III), immunodetectable p53 was identified. Histologically, one was ordinary type and the other a clear cell variant. However, no positivity was observed in the other cases including nine of low grade, ordinary type, three of low grade, clear cell type, and two of extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma. Direct sequencing, following polymerase chain reaction amplification of exons 5-9 of the p53 gene in 14 cases, in which fresh materials were available, successfully demonstrated base substitution mutations in only two cases with detectable p53 overexpression on immunohistochemistry. Their details were GTC (valine) to TTC (phenylalanine) at codon 157 in exon 5, and CGT (arginine) to CAT (histidine) at codon 273 in exon 8. No mutation was detected in the other 12 cases which were negative for p53 immunostaining. These findings strongly suggest that p53 mutation plays a crucial role in the biologically aggressive subtype, and possibly in the process of tumor progression in human chondrosarcoma.
