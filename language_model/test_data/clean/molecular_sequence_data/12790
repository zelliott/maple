We isolated 12 groups of genomic clones that contained SLG-homologous regions from a genomic library constructed from an S9 homozygote of self-incompatible Brassica campestris. Both SLG9 and SRK9 genomic clones, which are located within the self-incompatibility (S) locus, were included in these groups. The promoter regions of SLG9 and SRK9 were completely identical for at least 200 bp upstream from their respective initiation codons (ATG). The five sequence elements (boxes I to V) that are conserved in the promoters of SLG and SRK genes were also found in the SLG9 and SRK9 clones. However, one conserved element (box III) unexpectedly lacked 7 of 11 bp, although box III has been considered necessary for expression in pistil. The other ten groups of genomic clones were classified into six SRK-like groups and four SLG-like groups. These results indicate that SLG, SRK, SLG-like, and SRK-like genes form a large S-multigene family in B. campestris.
