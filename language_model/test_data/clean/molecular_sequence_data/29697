The beta-lactamase gene blaA(BPS) in Burkholderia pseudomallei was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. BPS-1 is a cephalosporinase with an isoelectric point of 7.7. Sequence analysis of BPS-1 revealed conserved motifs typical of class A beta-lactamases and a relationship to the PenA (in B. cepacia) and BlaI (in Yersinia enterocolitica) lineages.
