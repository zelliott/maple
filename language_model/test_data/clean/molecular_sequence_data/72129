The rbp gene family of the cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis strain M3 consists of eight members that encode small RNA-binding proteins containing a single RNA recognition motif (RRM). Similar genes are found in the genomes of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, Helicobacter pylori and Treponema pallidum, but are absent from the other completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes. The expression of the rbp genes of Anabaena is induced by low temperature, with the exception of the rbpD gene. We found four stretches of conserved sequences in the 5'-untranslated region of the cyanobacterial rbp genes that are known to be induced by low temperature. The cold-regulated Rbp proteins contain a short C-terminal glycine-rich domain. In this respect, these proteins are similar to plant and mammalian glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins (GRPs), which also contain a single RRM domain with a C-terminal glycine-rich domain and are highly expressed at low temperature. Detailed phylogenetic analysis showed, however, that the cyanobacterial Rbp proteins and the eukaryotic GRPs do not belong to a single lineage, but that the glycine-rich domains are likely to have been added independently. The cold-regulation of both types of proteins is also likely to have evolved independently. Furthermore, the chloroplast RNA-binding proteins are not likely to have originated from the Rbp proteins of endosymbiont cyanobacterium, but are supposed to have diverged from the GRPs. These results suggest that the cyanobacterial Rbp proteins and the eukaryotic GRPs are similar in both structure and regulation, but that this apparent similarity has resulted from convergent evolution.
