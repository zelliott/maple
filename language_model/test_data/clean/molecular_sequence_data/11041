In Leghorn (laying) chickens, susceptibility to a number of infectious diseases is strongly associated with the major histocompatibility (B) complex. Nucleotide sequence data have been published for six class I (B-F) alleles and for class II (B-L beta) alleles or isotypes from 17 Leghorn haplotypes. It is not known if classical B-L or B-F alleles in broilers are identical, at the sequence level, to any Leghorn alleles. This report describes molecular and immunogenetic characterization of two haplotypes from commercial broiler breeder chickens that were originally identified by serology as a single haplotype, but were differentiated serologically in the present work. The two haplotypes, designated BA4 and BA4variant, shared identical B-G restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns, but differed in one B-L beta fragment that cosegregated with the serological B haplotype. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequences of the highly variable exons of an expressed B-L beta II family gene and B-F gene from the two haplotypes were markedly different from each other. Both the B-L beta II family and B-F gene sequences from the BA4 haplotype were identical to the sequences obtained from the reference B21 haplotype in Leghorns; however, in the BA4 haplotype the B-L beta 21 and B-F21 alleles were in linkage with B-G alleles that were not G21. The nucleotide sequences from BA4variant were unique among the reported chicken B-L beta II family and B-F alleles.
