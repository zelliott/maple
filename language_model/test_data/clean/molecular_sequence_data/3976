The psbO gene encoding the extrinsic 33 kDa protein of oxygen-evolving photosystem II (PSII) complex was cloned and sequenced from a red alga, Cyanidium caldarium. The gene encodes a polypeptide of 333 residues, of which the first 76 residues served as transit peptides for transfer across the chloroplast envelope and thylakoid membrane. The mature protein consists of 257 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 28,290 Da. The sequence homology of the mature 33 kDa protein was 42.9-50.8% between the red alga and cyanobacteria, and 44.7-48.6% between the red alga and higher plants. The cloned gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein was purified, subjected to protease-treatments. The cleavage sites of the 33 kDa protein by chymotrypsin or V8 protease were determined and compared among a cyanobacterium (Synechococcus elongatus), a euglena (Euglena gracilis), a green alga (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) and two higher plants (Spinacia oleracea and Oryza sativa). The cleavage sites by chymotrypsin were at 156F and 190F for the cyanobacterium, 159M, 160F and 192L for red alga, 11Y and 151F for euglena, 10Yand 150F for green alga, and 16Y for spinach, respectively. The cleavage sites by V8 protease were at 181E (cyanobacterium), 182E and 195E (red alga), 13E, 67E, 69E, 153D and 181E (euglena), 176E and 180E (green alga), and 18E or 19E (higher plants). Since most of the residues at these cleavage sites were conserved among the six organisms, the results indicate that the structure of the 33 kDa protein, at least the structure based on the accessibility by proteases, is different among these organisms. In terms of the cleavage sites, the structure of the 33 kDa protein can be divided into three major groups: cyanobacterial and red algal-type has cleavage sites at residues around 156-195, higher plant-type at residues 16-19, and euglena and green algal-type at residues of both cyanobacterial and higher plant-types.
