The nucleotide sequence of two variants of coconut tinangaja viroid (CTiV) were obtained. Both sequence variants are 254 nucleotide residues in size but differ in sequence at two positions. In comparisons with other viroids, the sequences and proposed secondary structure of CTiV show most homology with the 246 nucleotide residue variant of coconut cadang-cadang viroid (CCCV (246]. Several regions throughout the rod-like molecules of CTiV show significant structural and sequence homology with other RNAs related to potato spindle tuber viroid. These homologies include a centrally positioned uridine bulged G:C helix and a 17 nucleotide residue sequence found in common with hop stunt viroid in the left-hand end loop of both viroids.
