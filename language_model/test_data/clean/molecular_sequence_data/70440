The primary structure of TsTX-IV, a neurotoxin isolated from Tityrus serrulatus scorpion venom, is reported. Its amino acid sequence was determined by automated Edman sequential degradation of the reduced and carboxymethylated toxin and of relevant peptides obtained by digestion with Staphylococcus aureus strain V8 protease or trypsin and cleavage by CNBr. The complete sequence showed 41 amino acid residues, which account for an estimated molecular weight of 4520, and eight half-cystine residues which cross-link the toxin molecule with four disulfide bonds. The molecular weight determined by mass spectrometry was 4518. Comparison of this sequence with those from other scorpion toxins showed a resemblance with toxins which act on different types of K+ channels. TsTx-IV was able to block Ca2+-activated K+ channels of high conductance. TsTX-IV is the first four-disulfide-bridged short toxin from T. serrulatus so far completely sequenced.
