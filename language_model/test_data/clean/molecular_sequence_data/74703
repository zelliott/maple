A novel PCR-RFLP method has been developed for the identification of six commercially relevant penaeid shrimp species in raw and processed food products. The method can be completed within 8 h. To implement the method, PCR amplification with the crustF/crustR primers, targeted to the amplification of a ca. 181 bp region of the cytochrome b (cytb) mitochondrial gene in penaeid shrimps, was coupled to restriction analysis with CviJI, DdeI and NlaIV. The method was also applied successfully to the identification of shrimp species in complex processed foods, including this type of shellfish as an added-value food ingredient. The small size of this molecular target facilitates amplification from fresh, frozen, or precooked samples, where DNA fragmentation may be relevant and fragment size critical. We also report the first cytb mitochondrial sequences described to date for the species Farfantepenaeus notialis, Parapenaeus longirostris and Pleoticus muelleri, and these nearly triplicate current knowledge of reference nucleotide sequences in this mitochondrial region for this group of species. The cytb mitochondrial gene may also be considered as a molecular marker for identification and phylogenetic purposes in penaeid shrimp species.
