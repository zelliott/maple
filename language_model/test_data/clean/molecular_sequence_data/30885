Three members of the myb gene family have been identified in human cDNA libraries c-myb, A-myb, and B-myb. We compared the DNA binding properties of the B-myb and c-myb proteins (B-MYB and c-MYB) using bacterially synthesized B-MYB and c-MYB in DNase I footprinting. B-MYB bound to most of the c-MYB binding sites examined, including the c-MYB binding site, MBS-I, in the simian virus (SV) 40 enhancer, in which the most frequent sequence was CCTAACTG. The MBS-I site was an enhancer element dependent on B-MYB and c-MYB in a co-transfection assay that used the B-myb or c-myb expression plasmid. Some sites in the SV40 genome, including the MBS-BI site, had high affinity with B-MYB but little or no affinity with c-MYB, in which the most frequent sequence was AGAAANPyrG. The MBS-BI site was an enhancer element dependent on B-MYB and a very weakly dependent on c-MYB. Our results showed that B-MYB is a transcriptional activator, like c-MYB, and that although B-MYB and c-MYB have similar sequence specificity for DNA binding some sequences were recognized by B-MYB preferentially.
