Simian Virus 40 (SV40)-encoded large T antigen has an intrinsic ATP-dependent DNA-unwinding activity which is necessary for an early step in the activation of the viral origin of replication. Isolated T antigen unwinds any double-stranded DNA, regardless of whether it is linear or circularly closed. However, initiation of DNA replication depends on an intact origin of replication, and even minor deviations from the wild-type origin sequence abolish the template activity of an origin-bearing plasmid. This discrepancy suggests that T antigen may not be sufficient for origin activation and that other, probably cellular, functions are involved. We have isolated a cellular protein, the LOB protein, which specifically interacts with the AT-rich region of the SV40 origin and which induces a pronounced bending of the bound DNA.
