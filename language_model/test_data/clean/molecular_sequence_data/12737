127 isolates of the genus Thermus, from neutral and alkaline hot water springs on four continents, have been screened for the presence of restriction endonuclease activity. An isolate (YS52) from Yellowstone National Park, USA, showed a high level of restriction endonuclease activity when a cell free extract was incubated with lambda phage DNA at 65 degrees C. A Type II restriction endonuclease (Taq52 I) has been partially purified from this isolate and the recognition and cleavage site determined. Taq52 I has a novel interrupted palindromic tetranucleotide recognition sequence GCWGC, where W can be either adenine (A) or thymine (T). It hydrolyses the phosphodiester bond in both strands of the substrate between the first and second bases of the recognition sequence: 5'G decreased or reduced CWGC3', producing three-base 5'-OH overhangs (sticky ends). The enzyme has a pH optimum of 7.0, requires 8 mM MgCl2 for maximum activity and is thermally stable, retaining full enzyme activity following incubation at 79 degrees C for 10 min. Taq52 I not only represents a new addition to the Type II restriction endonucleases, but also increases the small list of thermostable restriction endonucleases.
