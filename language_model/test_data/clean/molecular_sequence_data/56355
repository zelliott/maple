Three hundred and ninety-one consecutive heptapeptides derived from the VP6 protein of bovine rotavirus (397 AA) were synthesized using the "pepscan" method and were assayed on the synthesis pins with monoclonal antibodies to VP6. Heptapeptides reactive with MAbs were located in four main regions: regions AA 32-64, AA 155-167, AA 208-274, and a fourth region at the C-terminal, from AA 380 to AA 397. Among these regions, two sequences were also reactive with the MAbs when longer peptides were assayed. The sequence located between AA 58 and AA 62 (NWNFD), recognized by MAbs RV-1026, RV-50, and RV-443, was previously reported. A new site was defined in the region essential for trimerization, between AA 159 and AA 165 (PYSASFT), which was recognized by MAbs RV-133 and RV-138.
