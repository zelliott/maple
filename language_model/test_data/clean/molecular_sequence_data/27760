Luciferases of Japanese and North American fireflies act on a common substrate (luciferin) but the resulting lights emitted are of different colors. As a step toward an understanding of the molecular mechanism of the luciferase reaction, a cDNA clone (pGLf1) was isolated from a cDNA library of lantern poly(A)+RNA of the Japanese firefly, Luciola cruciata ('Genji-botaru' in Japanese), using a cDNA of North American firefly luciferase. The isolated 2-kb cDNA sequence was able to direct the synthesis of active luciferase in Escherichia coli under the control of the lac promoter. The primary structure of Genji firefly luciferase deduced from the nucleotide sequence was shown to consist of 548 amino acids (aa) with an Mr of 60,024. Homology between the amino acid sequences of the Genji and North American firefly luciferases was 67%, but a number of amino acid changes were found in the first 200 aa from the N terminus.
