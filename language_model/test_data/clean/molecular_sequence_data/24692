We isolated cDNA encoding turkey inhibin-alpha (tINH-alpha) and -betaA (tINH-betaA) subunits from the turkey ovary using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The isolated alpha subunit and betaA subunit included the entire open reading frames encoding 329 and 424 amino acids, respectively. The amino acid sequences of mature tINH-alpha subunit and tINH-betaA subunit (12.6 and 12.9 kDa proteins, respectively), established via DNA sequence analysis, were highly conserved between the chicken and various mammals. Northern blot analysis revealed that the transcripts of tINH-alpha and tINH-betaA subunits were approximately 1.7 and 8.4 kb, respectively. In various stages of follicular development, tINH-alpha mRNA was highly expressed in small white follicles as compared to postovulatory and regressed follicles, whereas tINH-betaA mRNA was predominately expressed in preovulatory F5 follicles.
