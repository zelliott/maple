A Gram-positive strain designated as MSL-14T isolated from a soil sample collected from Bigeum Island, Korea, was subjected to polyphasic taxonomy. The isolate was strictly aerobic. Cells were short rods and motile. Optimum growth temperature and pH was 28 degrees C and 7.0, respectively. It was characterized chemotaxonomically as having a cell-wall peptidoglycan type based on LL-2,6-diaminopimelic acid and MK-8(H4) as the predominant menaquinone. The major fatty acids were iso-C16:0, C17:1 omega8c, and C18:1 omega9c. The G+C content was 67.6 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain MSL-14T is affiliated to the genus Nocardioides and formed a distinct lineage within the genus. MSL-14T showed highest sequence similarity to Nocardioides aestuarii JCM 12125T, having a similarity of 96.5%. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence divergence and phenotypic characteristics, it is proposed that strain MSL-14T should be classified as representing a novel member of the genus Nocardioides, for which we propose the name Nocardioides tritolerans sp. nov. The type strain is strain MSL-14T (=KCTC 19289T= DSM 19320T).
