Leukocyte elastase and leukocyte cathepsin G degrade porcine plasminogen primarily by hydrolysis of the A447-I448 bond between kringle4 and kringle5. The rate of formation of des-kringle1-4-plasminogen is faster with elastase (k"obs greater than 10(5) mol-1 s-1) than with cathepsin G (kobs less than 300 mol-1 s-1). In contrast to elastase, leukocyte cathepsin G does not inactivate alpha 2-antiplasmin. Consequently, plasminogen activation by urokinase in the presence of alpha 2-antiplasmin is elastase-dependent, but cathepsin G does not overcome the action of alpha 2-antiplasmin. The rate-enhancing effect of fibrin(ogen) fragments in plasminogen activation by tissue-type plasminogen activator is also disabled efficiently by these proteases. It is concluded that enhancement of plasmin expression by neutrophil proteases is accounted for primarily by the action of elastase.
