A chimeric peptide, 32 amino acids long, bearing two active sites, one inhibiting trypsin (Kd = 1.8 10(-9) M), one carboxypeptidase A (Kd = 3 10(-9) M), was designed and synthesized. It is a "squash inhibitor" (EETI II, 28 amino acids) elongated with the 4 amino acids from the C-terminus of the potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor. It has 3 disulfide bridges assembled in the particular knotted topology shared by the two inhibitors, by conotoxin omega, and possibly by E. coli enterotoxin ST1b.
