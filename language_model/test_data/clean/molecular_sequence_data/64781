The photoreceptor phytochromes, encoded by a small gene family, are responsible for controlling the expression of a number of light-responsive genes and photomorphogenic events, including agronomically important phenotypes such as flowering time and shade-avoidance behavior. The understanding and control of flowering time are particularly important goals in sorghum cultivar development for diverse environments, and naturally occurring variation in the phytochrome genes might prove useful in breeding programs. Also of interest is whether variation observed at the phytochrome loci in domesticated sorghum, or in particular races, is a result of human selection. Population genetic studies can reveal evidence of such selection in patterns of polymorphism and divergence. In this study we report a population genetic analysis of the PHY gene family in Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench in a diverse panel including both cultivated and wild accessions. We show that the level of nucleotide variation in all gene family members is about half the average for this species, consistent with purifying selection acting on these loci. However, the rate of amino acid substitution is accelerated at PHYC compared to the other two loci. In comparisons to a closely related sorghum species, PHYC shows a pattern of intermediate frequency amino acid changes that differ from the patterns observed in comparisons across longer evolutionary distances. There is also a departure from expected patterns of polymorphism and divergence at synonymous sites in PHYC, although the data do not fit a simple model of directional or diversifying selection. Cultivated sorghum has a level of variation similar to that of wild relatives (ssp. verticilliflorum), but many polymorphisms are subspecies-specific, including several amino acid variants.
