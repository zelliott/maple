5S rRNA sequences were determined for the myxobacteria Cystobacter fuscus, Myxococcus coralloides, Sorangium cellulosum, and Nannocystis exedens and for the radioresistant bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans and Deinococcus radiophilus. A dendrogram was constructed by using weighted pairwise grouping based on these and all other previously known eubacterial 5S rRNA sequences, and this dendrogram showed differences as well as similarities compared with results derived from 16S rRNA analyses. In the dendrogram, Deinococcus 5S rRNA sequences clustered with 5S rRNA sequences of the genus Thermus, as suggested by the results of 16S rRNA analyses. However, in contrast to the 16S rRNA results, the Deinococcus-Thermus cluster divided the 5S rRNA sequences of the alpha subdivision of the class Proteobacteria from the 5S rRNA sequences of the beta and gamma subgroups of the Proteobacteria. The myxobacterial 5S rRNA sequence data failed to confirm the existence of a delta subgroup of the class Proteobacteria, which was suggested by the results of 16S rRNA analyses.
