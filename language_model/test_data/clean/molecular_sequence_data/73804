We have identified a new member, csbX, of the general stress regulon controlled by sigmaB in Bacillus subtilis. As with other members of the sigmaB regulon csbX is expressed during the stationary phase of cell growth and inactivation of this gene produces no obvious phenotype during cell growth or early development. csbX lies uspstream from the sporulation gene bofC which is co-transcribed during stationary phase.
