Four new resin-glycosides, named mammosides A (10), B (11), H1 (12), and H2 (13), were isolated from the tuber of Merremia mammosa (Convolvulaceae), a Jamu raw material. Their chemical structures have been elucidated on the bases of chemical and physicochemical evidence, including synthesis of a glycosidic acid designated as mammoside I.
