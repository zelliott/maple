Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is targeted to the cell membrane via interactions of its extended PDZ domain with PDZ domains of membrane-associated proteins including PSD-95 and alpha1-syntrophin. The formation of heterodimers between the nNOS PDZ domain and the PDZ domains of nNOS-binding proteins requires a stretch of continuous amino-acid residues C-terminal to the canonical nNOS PDZ domain. In this work, we show that a 27-residue peptide comprising the C-terminal extension of the extended nNOS PDZ domain is capable of binding to PSD-95. The structure of the 27-residue peptide in aqueous solution was determined using multidimensional NMR-spectroscopic techniques. The free peptide adopts a native-like beta-hairpin finger structure in aqueous solution. The results indicate that the C-terminal extension peptide of the nNOS PDZ domain may represent a relatively independent structural unit in the mediation of the interaction between nNOS and PDZ domain-containing proteins including PSD-95 and alpha1-syntrophin.
