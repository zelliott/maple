A Gram-negative, non-motile, non-spore-forming and rod-shaped bacterial strain, DSW-6T, was isolated from sea water and subjected to a polyphasic study. Strain DSW-6T grew optimally at 25 degrees C, in the presence of 2 % (w/v) NaCl and at pH 7.0-8.0. It was characterized chemotaxonomically as having MK-6 as the predominant menaquinone and iso-C(15 : 0), anteiso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH and C(15 : 0) as the major fatty acids (>10 % of total fatty acids). Major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, unidentified phospholipids and amino-group-containing lipids that are ninhydrin-positive. The DNA G+C content was 36.9 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain DSW-6(T) forms an independent line of descent within the family Flavobacteriaceae. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain DSW-6T exhibited similarity values of less than 94.7 % to the sequences of other members of the family Flavobacteriaceae. Strain DSW-6T could be distinguished from other phylogenetically related genera by differences in several phenotypic properties. Therefore, in view of the combined phenotypic and phylogenetic data, it is proposed that strain DSW-6T (= KCTC 12402T = DSM 17205T) represents a novel genus and species, Donghaeana dokdonensis gen. nov., sp. nov.
