Synectin, a PDZ2 protein, binds to a number of plasma membrane receptors. We characterized synectin promoter and carried out a detailed expression survey. The protein is widely distributed in adult cells and tissues. Expression in the mouse embryo is apparent at day 4.5, peaks at day 12.5 and declines to its adult levels by day 18.5. The level of synectin transcription was minimally affected by exposure to cytokines, growth factors or hypoxia. In summary, synectin's early appearance, constant nature, and ubiquitous distribution suggest that it may be a key structural protein involved in mediation of outside-in signaling.
