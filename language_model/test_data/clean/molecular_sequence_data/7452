We tested the hypothesis that adrenomedullin (ADM), a recently isolated hypotensive peptide, is an autocrine transmitter in renal arterial smooth muscle cells (RASMCs). Fura-2 fluorometry revealed that ADM decreases both the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and tension induced by 0.3 microM phenylephrine (PE) in porcine RASMCs. The expression of ADM mRNA in RASMCs was assessed by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), using the total RNA from the RASMCs and the specific primers for the porcine ADM mRNA. A band with an expected size could be detected only when the reverse transcriptase was added, thus indicating that the porcine RASMCs express ADM mRNA. These results therefore suggested that ADM plays an important role in the regulation of the renal vascular tone, not only as a circulating hormone, but also as an autocrine transmitter.
