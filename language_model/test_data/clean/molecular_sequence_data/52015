A genetic linkage map of human chromosome 9q, spanning a sex-equal distance of 125 cM, has been developed by genotyping 26 loci in the Venezuelan Reference Pedigree. The loci include 12 anonymous microsatellite markers reported by Kwiatkowski et al. (1992), several classical systems previously assigned to chromosome 9q, and polymorphisms for the genes tenacin (HXB), gelsolin (GSN), adenylate kinase 1 (AK1), arginosuccinate synthetase (ASS), ABL oncogene (ABL1), ABO blood group (ABO), and dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH). Only a marginally significant sex difference is found along the entire length of the map and results from one interval, between D9S58 and D9S59, that displays an excess of female recombination. A comparison of the genetic map to the existing physical data suggests that there is increased recombination in the 9q34 region with a recombination event occurring every 125-400 kb. This map should be useful in further characterizing the relationship between physical distance and genetic distance, as well as for genetic linkage studies of diseases that map to chromosome 9q, including multiple self-healing squamous epithelioma (MSSE), Gorlin syndrome (NBCCS), xeroderma pigmentosum (XPA), nail-patella syndrome (NPS1), torsion dystonia (DYT1), and tuberous sclerosis (TSC1).
