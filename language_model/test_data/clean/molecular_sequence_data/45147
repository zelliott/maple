The polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbon 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is an ubiquitously distributed environmental pollutant which can induce a broad spectrum of toxic responses in animals, including birds. In this study, we investigated the impact of 0 or 20 ng TCDD injections into the yolk of chicken eggs before start of development, on liver and ovarian protein expression in hatchlings using fluorescent two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2-D-DIGE) under a pH range of 4-7, combined with MS. Despite considerable interindividual variability, exposure to TCDD prior to the start of embryonic development resulted in significant changes in expression of a small set of proteins. Expression of fibrinogen gamma chain precursor in the liver and 60 kDa heat shock protein in the ovary were significantly higher as a result of the very early exposure to TCDD. NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase (42 kDa subunit) and regucalcin expression was decreased by early TCDD treatment in the liver and ovary, respectively. These proteins could not be directly linked with drug metabolism per se but are involved in blood clotting, oxidative stress, electron transport, and calcium regulation. It remains to be elucidated how these changes in the hatchling might be linked to the observed long-term consequences during posthatch life of the chicken.
