Two 1.5-kb macronuclear chromosomes bearing histone H2B genes from the ciliated protozoan Euplotes crassus were cloned and sequenced. Although the noncoding sequences on these macronuclear chromosomes are very different, the genes encode an identical 113-aa histone H2B protein that has a shortened N-terminus and a highly conserved C-terminus relative to histone H2B proteins in other organisms. Primer extension was used to determine the transcription start points. Northern analysis shows that the abundance of H2B mRNA changes relative to DNA replication periods during the sexual phase of the life cycle. Analysis of 3' RACE products indicates that the H2B genes are coexpressed.
