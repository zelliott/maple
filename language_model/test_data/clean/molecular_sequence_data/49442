It has been established that sialyl Lewis x in core 2 branched O-glycans serves as an E- and P-selectin ligand. Recently, it was discovered that 6-sulfosialyl Lewis x in extended core 1 O-glycans, NeuNAcalpha2-->3Galbeta1-->4(Fucalpha1-->3(sulfo-->6))GlcNAcbeta1--> 3Galbeta1-->3GalNAcalpha1-->Ser/Thr, functions as an L-selectin ligand in high endothelial venules. Extended core 1 O-glycans can be synthesized when a core 1 extension enzyme is present. In this study, we first show that beta1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-3 (beta3GlcNAcT-3) is almost exclusively responsible for core 1 extension among seven different beta3GlcNAcTs and thus acts on core 1 O-glycans attached to PSGL-1. We found that transcripts encoding beta3GlcNAcT-3 were expressed in human neutrophils and lymphocytes but that their levels were lower than those of transcripts encoding core 2 beta1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (Core2GlcNAcT-I). Neutrophils also expressed transcripts encoding fucosyltransferase VII (FucT-VII) and Core2GlcNAcT-I, whereas lymphocytes expressed only small amounts of transcripts encoding FucT-VII. To determine the roles of sialyl Lewis x in extended core 1 O-glycans, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were stably transfected to express PSGL-1, FucT-VII, and either beta3GlcNAcT-3 or Core2GlcNAcT-I. Glycan structural analyses disclosed that PSGL-1 expressed in these transfected cells carried comparable amounts of sialyl Lewis x in extended core 1 and core 2 branched O-glycans. In a rolling assay, CHO cells expressing sialyl Lewis x in extended core 1 O-glycans supported a significant degree of shear-dependent tethering and rolling of neutrophils and lymphocytes, although less than CHO cells expressing sialyl Lewis x in core 2 branched O-glycans. These results indicate that sialyl Lewis x in extended core 1 O-glycans can function as an L-selectin ligand and is potentially involved in neutrophil adhesion on neutrophils bound to activated endothelial cells.
