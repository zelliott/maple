Our laboratory has described a method for introducing site-specific mutations into the genome of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) by RNA recombination between cotransfected genomic RNA and a synthetic subgenomic mRNA. By using a thermolabile N protein mutant of MHV as the recipient virus and synthetic RNA7 (the mRNA for the nucleocapsid protein N) as the donor, engineered recombinant viruses were selected as heat-stable progeny resulting from cotransfection. We have recently reported an optimization of the efficiency of targeted recombination in this process by using a synthetic defective interfering (DI) RNA in place of RNA7. The frequency of recombination is sufficiently high that recombinants can often be directly identified without employing a thermal selection. We present here a progress report on our use of this system to map MHV mutants and to construct N gene mutants which include (1) a mutant in which the internal open reading frame within the N gene (the I gene) has been disrupted, and (2) a series of recombinants in which portions of the MHV N gene have been replaced by the homologous regions from the N gene of bovine coronavirus. We also report on some mutants we have not been able to construct.
