Whole-genome sequencing, transcriptomic analyses, and metabolic reconstruction were used to investigate Gordonia sp. strain KTR9's ability to catabolize a range of compounds, including explosives and steroids. Aspects of this mycolic acid-containing actinobacterium's catabolic potential were experimentally verified and compared with those of rhodococci and mycobacteria.
