In recent years an apparent increase in the frequency of detection of G3P[8] rotaviruses has been observed worldwide. Similarly, in Italy G3P[8] strains have been detected sporadically and in a scattered fashion over 20 years, whereas in 2003 and 2005 G3P[8] rotavirus activity increased markedly. By analysis of the VP7, VP4, VP6, and NSP4 genes of a selection of G3P[8] rotaviruses detected between 1993 and 2005, a remarkable sequence conservation was observed in the VP7, VP4, and VP6 genes. By converse, after 2002 the Italian G3P[8] strains were found to possess unique mutations in significant regions of the NSP4 protein.
