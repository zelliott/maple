Most monoclonal antibodies to mouse antigens have been derived from rat spleen-mouse myeloma fusions. Many resultant hybridomas express one of several myeloma kappa chain transcripts, even though the parent myeloma may have been ascribed as not expressing light chain protein. Previous reports have only differentiated against one of these mouse light chains. We have found at least three different myeloma kappa transcripts in the panel of nine hybridomas that were derived from four different myeloma parents. We have designed an amplification strategy that differentiates the rearranged rat kappa chain from all mouse light chains. Moreover, this method is expedient as it requires minimal downstream manipulation.
