Escherichia coli lacZ strains CC107-CC111, which detect specific frameshift mutations, were used to study the mutational specificities of 2-nitro-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f] quinoline (NO2-IQ) and rat hepatic S9-activated 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ). New constructs were made in which UvrABC-dependent excision repair was eliminated (strains DJ3107-DJ3111), followed by introduction of plasmid pYG219 conferring acetyl CoA:arylamine N-acetyltransferase/acetyl CoA:arylhydroxylamine O-acetyltransferase (NAT/OAT) activity (strains DJ3207-DJ3211). Sensitivity to mutagens was greatly enhanced. The mutational specificity of NO2-IQ was identical to that of the corresponding amine, IQ. The most prominent mutations caused by the two compounds were -2(CGGC) and 1(CG) frameshifts. +1(AT) Frameshifts play a minor role in the pattern of mutational specificity. Induction of all three mutations was similarly influenced by NAT/OAT activation and UvrABC-dependent excision repair. These new tester strains provide an effective tool for the study of aromatic amine mutational specificity and the influences of excision repair and NAT/OAT activation.
