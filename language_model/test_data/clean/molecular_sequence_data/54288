The main objective of this study was to identify the genes causing etiolation in a rice mutant, the thylakoids of which were scattered. Three populations were employed to map the genes for etiolation using bulked segregant analysis. Genetic analysis confirmed that etiolation was controlled by two recessive genes, et11 and et12, which were fine mapped to an approximately 147-kb region and an approximately 209-kb region on the short arms of chromosomes 11 and 12, respectively. Both regions were within the duplicated segments on chromosomes 11 and 12. They possessed a highly similar sequence of 38 kb at the locations of a pair of duplicated genes with protein sequences very similar to that of HCF152 in Arabidopsis that are required for the processing of chloroplast RNA. These genes are likely the candidates for et11 and et12. Expression profiling was used to compare the expression patterns of paralogs in the duplicated segments. Expression profiling indicated that the duplicated segments had been undergone concerted evolution, and a large number of the paralogs within the duplicated segments were functionally redundant like et11 and et12.
