A 21 kDa protein purified from bovine brain cytosol was previously described as a hydrophobic ligand binding protein; however, its accurate biological function remained still uncertain. In order to get further information about its potential biological role, an extended prediction of its secondary and three dimensional structures was undertaken. We describe here a process which permitted us to discover a structural homology between the 21 kDa protein and the N-domain of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). This process is based on comparing the 21 kDa protein with all the proteins presenting a slight homology, by using the Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis (HCA) method. According to the observed similarity between the N-domain of yeast PGK and the 21 kDa protein, we built a model which was shown to possess a potential binding site for nucleotides. Moreover, the model obtained presents three-dimensional (3D) structure similarity with adenylate kinase. These results suggest two main hypotheses: (i) the 21 kDa protein may belong to the kinase family; (ii) the binding of a nucleotide could imply a modification of the 3D structure of the 21 kDa protein that can promote the transfer of hydrophobic ligands to the plasma membrane. Meanwhile, verification of these hypotheses has been in part performed experimentally: the 21 kDa protein binds MgATP as well as, to a lesser extent, phosphoglycerate.
