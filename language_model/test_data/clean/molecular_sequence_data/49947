The model legume Medicago truncatula contains at least six apyrase-like genes, five of which (MtAPY1;1, MtAPY1;2, MtAPY1;3, MtAPY1;4, and MtAPY1;5) are members of a legume-specific family, whereas a single gene (MtAPY2) has closer homologs in Arabidopsis. Phylogenetic analysis has revealed that the proteins encoded by these two plant gene families are more similar to yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) GDA1 and to two proteins encoded by newly described mammalian genes (ENP5 and 6) than they are to mammalian CD39- and CD39-like proteins. Northern analyses and analyses of the frequencies of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in different cDNA libraries suggest that in roots, leaves, and flowers, the more highly expressed genes are MtAPY1;3/MtAPY2, MtAPY1;3/MtAPY1;5 and MtAPY1;2/MtAPY1;3 respectively. In roots, at least four of the MtAPY1 genes are induced transiently within 3 to 6 h by a stress response that seems to be ethylene independent because it occurs after treatment with an ethylene synthesis inhibitor and also in the skl ethylene-insensitive mutant. This response also occurs in roots of the following symbiotic mutants: dmi1, dmi2, dmi3, nsp, hcl, pdl, lin, and skl. No evidence was obtained for a rapid, transient, and specific induction of the MtAPY genes in roots in response to rhizobia or rhizobial lipochitooligosaccharidic Nod factors. Thus, our data suggest that the apyrase-like genes, which in several legumes have been implicated to play a role in the legume-rhizobia symbiosis (with some members being described as early nodulin genes), are not regulated symbiotically by rhizobia in M. truncatula.
