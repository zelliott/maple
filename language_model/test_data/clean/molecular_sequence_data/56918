Boophilus microplus contains a nucleotidase-like enzyme which is able to hydrolyze a range of nucleoside 5'-mono-, di- and triphosphates to the nucleoside. Its relationship to several other nucleotide hydrolyzing enzymes has been explored. Limited peptide sequencing shows similarities to both mammalian nucleotidases and the Escherichia coli uridine diphosphate sugar hydrolase. The tick enzyme also hydrolyzes UDP-glucose, though by a mechanism different to that of the bacterial enzyme. On the other hand, it resembles the mammalian nucleotidases in that there is evidence that it is attached to the cell membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor.
