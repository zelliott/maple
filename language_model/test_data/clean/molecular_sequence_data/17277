A number of actinomycetes isolates were recovered from coastal sediments in Aberystwyth (Wales, United Kingdom) with standard isolation techniques. Most of them were putatively assigned to the genera Streptomyces and Micromonospora on the basis of their morphological characteristics, and there appeared to be no difference whether the isolation media contained distilled water or seawater. A group of 20 Micromonospora isolates was selected to undergo further polyphasic taxonomic investigation. Three approaches were used to analyze the diversity of these isolates, 16S rDNA sequencing, fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The 16S rDNA sequence analysis confirmed that all of these isolates should be classified to the genus Micromonospora, and they were analyzed with a group of other Micromonospora 16S rDNA sequences available from the Ribosomal Database Project. The relationships of the 20 isolates were observed after hierarchical clustering, and almost identical clusters were obtained with these three techniques. This has obvious implications for high-throughput screening for novel actinomycetes because FT-IR spectroscopy, which is a rapid and reliable whole-organism fingerprinting method, can be applied as a very useful dereplication tool to indicate which environmental isolates have been cultured previously.
