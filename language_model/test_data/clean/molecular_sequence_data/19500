As one of the major cellular chaperones, Hsp90 plays diverse roles in supporting and regulating wild-type and oncogenic signal transduction proteins. Hsp90 function itself is regulated by its various nonsubstrate subunits. To define Hsp90's predominant in vivo functions and the mechanisms for regulating this function, the human Hsp90 interactome was characterized using gel-based proteomics techniques. Results show that Hsp90's most prominent association is its previously described interaction with Hsp70, a primary chaperone capable of recognizing and binding hydrophobic peptide segments. Additionally, novel human proteins discovered in this study reveal that several newly described Hsp90 associations in yeast are conserved in the human cytoplasm. Additionally, other new Hsp90 subunits imply that a great deal of Hsp90 function may be directed to the assembly, regulation, or exploitation of the tubulin-based cytoskeleton network, particularly the mitotic spindle.
