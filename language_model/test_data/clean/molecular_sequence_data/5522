A high rate of human T-lymphotropic virus type II (HTLV-II) infection has been documented in intravenous drug abusers (IVDAs) in South Vietnam. We have investigated the molecular characteristics of the virus and have shown that one HTLV-II subtype is predominant in Ho Chi Minh City. This molecular subtype, HTLV-IIb, was identified in a number of South Vietnamese by nucleotide sequence analysis of the long terminal repeat (LTR) region. HTLV-IIa was not found. These findings suggest that HTLV-IIb is endemic in IVDAs in South Vietnam, although IVDAs in urban areas in North America are predominantly infected with HTLV-IIa.
