A multigene family encoding male specific serum polypeptides (MSSPs) that show significant structural similarity to the family of insect odourant binding proteins, has been characterized in the medfly Ceratitis capitata. This family comprises seven members classified in three subgroups, MSSP-alpha, MSSP-beta and MSSP-gamma. The genes of subgroups alpha and beta are clustered in tandem in a 35-kb genomic region, and present an exceptionally high degree of similarity not only in their coding but also in the surrounding regions, while the genes of the gamma subgroup are drastically divergent. Although MSSPs are predominantly expressed in the male fat body, detailed expression studies suggest that individual members of this family are expressed in a distinct sex- and tissue-specific manner.
