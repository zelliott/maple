We report the cloning and sequencing of group III phospholipaseA(2) from Heterometrus fulvipes (HfPLA(2)), Indian black scorpion. The cDNA sequence codes for the mature portion of the group PLA(2) of 103 amino acids. The sequence has 85% identity with Mesobuthus tamulus (Indian red scorpion) PLA(2) and a 40% identity with bee venom PLA(2) and human group III PLA(2). Most of the essential features of group III PLA(2) like Ca(2+) binding loop and catalytic residues are conserved. Homology modeling was done with the known structure of group III bee venom PLA(2). All the secondary structural motifs and the disulfide bridges are as predicted. The variation like the replacement of aspartic acid residue with glutamic acid in the well known histidine-aspartic acid dyad is a rare feature. This is the first structural model report of an Indian black scorpion PLA(2).
