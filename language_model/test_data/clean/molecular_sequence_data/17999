We have developed a convenient procedure to measure the activity of Ricin A-chain and other enzymes with RNA N-glycosidase activity. The method is based on the use of a tritiated oligoribonucleotide as a substrate. The enzymatic activity is directly determined by measuring the release of adenine from the substrate. This method should prove useful in the study of the molecular mechanism of action of Ricin A and other RNA N-glycosidases.
