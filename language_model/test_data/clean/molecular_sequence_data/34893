The apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) mediates ileal bile acid reabsorption. The transcription factors, liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1:mouse) and fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF:human), are presumably orthologues. Bile-acid induced negative feedback regulation of mouse (m) and human (h) ASBT occurs via LRH-1 and RAR/RXR, respectively. hASBT has a potential FTF cis-element, although its functional role is unknown. hASBT and mASBT promoter constructs and an FTF cis-element mutated hASBT (hASBT/FTFmu) were assessed in human Caco-2 cells treated with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and/or co-transfected with hFTF, mLRH-1, or specific small interfering FTF or LRH-1 RNA (siFTF or siLRH). Basal promoter activity was reduced in hASBT/FTFmu, although bile acid response persisted. hFTF activated hASBT but not mASBT, while mLRH-1 activated mASBT but not hASBT. siFTF reduced hASBT but not mASBT activity; siLRH reduced mASBT but not hASBT activity. siLRH but not siFTF abrogated bile acid responsiveness. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated distinct and specific binding of the mLRH-1 or hFTF cis-elements. In conclusion, FTF and LRH-1 are two related but different transcription factors in human Caco-2 cells, suggesting that they may be homologues and not orthologues. FTF is not involved directly in bile acid mediated negative feedback regulation of the ASBT.
