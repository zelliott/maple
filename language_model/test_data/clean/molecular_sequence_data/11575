A species-specific PCR for the identification of Naegleria fowleri was developed. In sensitivity studies, 10 trophozoites or cysts and 1 trophozoite or cyst could be detected after 35 and 45 cycles, respectively. In conjunction with a rapid DNA isolation method, this PCR was used to identify N. fowleri directly from primary cultures of environmental samples.
