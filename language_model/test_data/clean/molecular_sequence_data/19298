Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a promising vehicle for gene therapy, which will rely on the generation of high-titer, high-purity recombinant vectors. However, numerous purification protocols can involve challenging optimization or scalability issues, and most AAV serotypes do not bind heparin or sialic acid, used for AAV2/3 or AAV4/5 purification, requiring the development of new chromatography strategies. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) allows for robust protein purification via affinity tags such as the hexahistidine (His(6)) sequence. Through the combination of a diverse AAV2 library and rational peptide insertions, we have located an optimal His(6) tag insertion site within the viral capsid. This mutant and a related AAV8 variant can be purified from clarified cell lysate in a single gravity column step at infectious particle yields exceeding 90%. Furthermore, injection of IMAC-purified vector into the brain demonstrates that it mediates high-efficiency gene delivery in vivo, equivalent to that of wild-type capsid, with minimal immune cell activation. This affinity chromatography method may offer advantages in ease of purification, final vector purity, and process scalability. Moreover, a combined rational design and high-throughput library selection approach can aid in the design of enhanced viral gene delivery vectors.
