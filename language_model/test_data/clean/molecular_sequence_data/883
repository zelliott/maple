To assess the relationship of the variation of exon 20 of leptin receptor (LEPR) gene to the lipid metabolism and fat distribution of the children with obesity.

Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism(RFLP) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were used to analyze the variation of exon 20 of the LEPR gene of the obesity group(72 obesity children) and the control group(60 healthy children). At the same time, all childrens' serum triglyceride(TG),total cholesterol(TC),high density lipoprotein cholesterol(HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol(LDL-C), height and weight were measured, and their body mass index(BMI) and fat percent(%fat) were calculated.

Three genotypes of exon 20 of LEPR gene were detected in this study. Compared with the control, the frequency of gene variation at 3057 nucleotide G-->A transversion was higher(P<0.05). The concentration of serum TG and the BMI and %fat of the A/A genotype obesity children were higher than those of the G/G genotype ones(P<0.01) but the level of serum HDL of the A/A children were lower than that of the G/G children (P<0.01). As to the G/A genotype children, only their serum TG level was higher than that of the G/G genotype ones(P<0.05).

The above findings indicated there were polymorphisms in the children with obesity, and those polymorphisms might remarkably affect their lipid metabolism and fat distribution.
