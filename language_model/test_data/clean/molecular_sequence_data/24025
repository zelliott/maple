A collection of Yersinia pestis strains was investigated by the multi-locus VNTR analysis. All 9 used locuses were diverse, although they differed between themselves by the quantity of genotypes displaying 4 to 13 variations in the sample. The diversity index (DI) ranged from 0.18 (ms21) to 0.86 (ms46); 8 locuses had DI > 0.5. The statistical processing showed 55 individual genotypes in a group of 81 examined strains, which denoted a high discriminative potentiality of the typing system (DP = 0.98). On the basis of the cluster analysis, the genotypes were shared between 11 main groups. The strains belonging to one genotype group were found to originate, as a rule, from one natural focus. The suggested scheme of typing and of creating the databases of genotypes of plaque agent can be used to establish, with a high probability degree, the source of strains.
