The myoactive neuropeptide NGIWYamide was originally isolated from the holothurian (sea cucumber) Apostichopus japonicus but there is evidence that NGIWYamide-like peptides also occur in other echinoderms. Here we report the discovery of a gene in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus that encodes two copies of an NGIWYamide-like peptide: Asn-Gly-Phe-Phe-Phe-(NH(2)) or NGFFFamide. Interestingly, the C-terminal region of the NGFFFamide precursor shares sequence similarity with neurophysins, carrier proteins hitherto uniquely associated with precursors of vasopressin/oxytocin-like neuropeptides. Thus, the NGFFFamide precursor is the first neurophysin-containing neuropeptide precursor to be discovered that does not contain a vasopressin/oxytocin-like peptide. However, it remains to be determined whether neurophysin acts as a carrier protein for NGFFFamide. The S. purpuratus genome also contains a gene encoding a precursor comprising a neurophysin polypeptide and 'echinotocin' (CFISNCPKGamide) - the first vasopressin/oxytocin-like peptide to be identified in an echinoderm. Therefore, in S. purpuratus there are two genes encoding precursors that have a neurophysin domain but which encode neuropeptides that are structurally unrelated. Furthermore, both NGFFFamide and echinotocin cause contraction of tube foot and oesophagus preparations from the sea urchin Echinus esculentus, consistent with the myoactivity of NGIWYamide in sea cucumbers and the myoactivity of vasopressin/oxytocin-like peptides in other animal phyla. Presumably the NGFFFamide precursor acquired its neurophysin domain following partial or complete duplication of a gene encoding a vasopressin/oxytocin-like peptide, but it remains to be determined when in evolutionary history this occurred.
