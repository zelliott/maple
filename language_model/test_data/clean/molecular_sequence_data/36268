The spo-87 mutation is one of two sporulation mutations originally used to define the spo0J locus of Bacillus subtilis. We now show that it blocks sporulation after completion of prespore engulfment (stage III). Surprisingly, the operon is expressed vegetatively, probably from a sigma A-dependent promoter, and its expression is shut down at the transcriptional level at about the onset of sporulation. DNA sequencing reveals that the locus defined by spo-87, which we now designate spoIIIJ, consists of a bicistronic operon. However, only the first gene is essential for sporulation; the function of the second cistron is cryptic. The predicted SpoIIIJ product has an M(r) of 29,409. It probably forms a lipoprotein and is rich in basic and hydrophobic amino acids. Mutations in spoIIIJ abolish the transcription of prespore-specific genes transcribed by the sigma G form of RNA polymerase but not transcription of the spoIIIG gene encoding sigma G. The SpoIIIJ product could be involved in a signal transduction pathway coupling gene expression in the prespore to events in the mother cell, or it could be necessary for essential metabolic interactions between the two cells.
