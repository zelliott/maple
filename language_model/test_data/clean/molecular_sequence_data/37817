The genome of the radiation-resistant eubacterium Deinococcus radiodurans contains an ortholog of an RNA-binding protein known as the Ro 60-kD autoantigen. This protein, which was previously identified only in higher eukaryotes, is normally bound to small RNAs known as Y RNAs. We show that the Ro protein ortholog Rsr contributes to the resistance of D. radiodurans to UV irradiation. Rsr binds several small RNAs, encoded upstream of rsr, that accumulate following UV irradiation. One of these RNAs resembles a Y RNA. These results suggest that Ro RNPs could similarly contribute to the recovery of higher cells following UV irradiation.
