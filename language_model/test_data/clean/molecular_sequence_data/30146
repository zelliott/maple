Alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide (alpha-hANP) was synthesized by assembling six peptide fragments in solution followed by deprotection with HF and subsequent air-oxidation. The trimethylbenzyl group was employed as an S-protecting group of cysteine. The HF-dimethylselenide-m-cresol system was employed as a final deprotecting reagent and, at the same time, as a reducing reagent of Met(O). Synthetic alpha-hANP elicited potent diuretic and natriuretic activity in rats.
