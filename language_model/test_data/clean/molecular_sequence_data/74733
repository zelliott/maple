A bacterial strain designated GSPC1 T was isolated from root nodules of Phaseolus coccineus in Segovia (Spain). The 16S rRNA gene sequence of this strain showed 95.9 and 94.7 % sequence similarity, respectively, with those of the type strains of Cohnella hongkongensis and Cohnella thermotolerans. Strain GSPC1 T presented phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and molecular differences with respect to Cohnella species which indicated that it belonged to a different species. The isolate was a Gram-positive, aerobic, sporulated rod, motile by means of peritrichous flagella. The strain was catalase-positive and showed weak oxidase activity. It grew in the presence of 2 % NaCl. MK-7 was the predominant menaquinone. anteiso-C15:0, iso-C15:0, iso-C16: 0 and C16:0 were the major fatty acids. Major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. The G+C content was 60.3 mol%. The results of this study suggest that isolate GSPC1 T should be classified within a novel Cohnella species, for which the name Cohnella phaseoli sp. nov. is proposed, with strain GSPC1T (=LMG 24086T =DSM 19269T) as the type strain.
