Bombyxin is an insect neurohormone with an insulin-like structure. The N-terminal A chain helix, a region which is considered part of the active site in insulin, is almost identical between the two hormones. Bombyxin analogues with modifications at the N-terminus of the A-chain were synthesized and investigated for their ability to bind to bombyxin-specific receptors. While N-acetylation reduced the affinity to the bombyxin receptor to 18% the removal of glycine (A1) inactivated the hormone completely. Replacement of glycine (A1) by L-amino acids caused a significant loss in activity (11%) while its replacement by D-amino acid resulted in active bombyxin analogues (55%). Comparative CD spectroscopy indicated a change in structure for desGly(A1)bombyxin. Although the insect hormone does not have an insulin-like function it exhibits mammalian insulin-like structural sensitivity for A chain modifications.
