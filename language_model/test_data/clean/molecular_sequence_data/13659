The mouse Htf9-a gene encodes a small hydrophilic protein, named Ran-binding protein 1 (RanBP-1), for its interaction with the Ras-related Ran protein; RanBP-1 binds the biologically active form of Ran. Ran has been implicated in a variety of nuclear events including DNA replication, RNA export and protein import, and monitoring completion of DNA synthesis before the onset of mitosis; it biological activity is thought to be regulated in S phase. We have investigated whether expression of the Htf9-a/RanBP-1 gene is linked to cell proliferation. Expression of the Htf9-a/RanBP-1 transcript appeared to be dependent on the proliferating state of the cells and peaked in S phase. We have identified a promoter region required for Htf9-a cell cycle-dependent expression and for responsiveness to cell cycle regulators. An E2F-binding site was identified within the cell cycle-regulated promoter region. Expression of the E1A oncoprotein prevented Htf9-a down-regulation in quiescent cells; in addition, both pRb and its relative p107 inhibited transcription from the Htf9-a promoter. These results link the control of Htf9-a/RanBP-1 expression to the cell cycle progression.
