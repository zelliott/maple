Based on the amino acid alignment, Caenorhabditis elegans F32D1.1 was identified to be a homologue of the mammalian fidgetin. We produced and purified the F32D1.1 protein by using a baculovirus-expression system. F32D1.1 has an ATPase activity, which is sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide. Km and Vmax for the ATPase activity of F32D1.1 were estimated to be 0.44 mM and 225 nmol/mg/min, respectively. When the cysteine at the position of 368 was mutated to alanine, the ATPase activity was greatly decreased; Vmax was decreased to one-sixth, while Km remained similar. These results suggest that the unique position of cysteine 368, located immediately downstream of the Walker A motif, plays an important role in the ATP hydrolysis process of C. elegans F32D1.1 protein.
