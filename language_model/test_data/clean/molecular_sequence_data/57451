Partial cDNAs encoding for myosin-like proteins from Anemia phyllitidis and Arabidopsis thaliana have been isolated using PCR technology. The deduced amino acid sequences show an average similarity up to 62% with known myosin heavy chain genes. From northern blot analysis we were able to estimate that transcripts of ca. 6.1 kb size are expressed in A. phyllitidis.
