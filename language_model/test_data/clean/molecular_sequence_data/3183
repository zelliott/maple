Recently, a poplar phloem peroxiredoxin (Prx) was found to accept both glutaredoxin (Grx) and thioredoxin (Trx) as proton donors. To investigate the catalytic mechanism of the Grx-dependent reduction of hydroperoxides catalyzed by Prx, a series of cysteinic mutants was constructed. Mutation of the most N-terminal conserved cysteine of Prx (Cys-51) demonstrates that it is the catalytic one. The second cysteine (Cys-76) is not essential for peroxiredoxin activity because the C76A mutant retained approximately 25% of the wild type Prx activity. Only one cysteine of the Grx active site (Cys-27) is essential for peroxiredoxin catalysis, indicating that Grx can act in this reaction either via a dithiol or a monothiol pathway. The creation of covalent heterodimers between Prx and Grx mutants confirms that Prx Cys-51 and Grx Cys-27 are the two residues involved in the catalytic mechanism. The integration of a third cysteine in position 152 of the Prx, making it similar in sequence to the Trx-dependent human Prx V, resulted in a protein that had no detectable activity with Grx but kept activity with Trx. Based on these experimental results, a catalytic mechanism is proposed to explain the Grx- and Trx-dependent activities of poplar Prx.
