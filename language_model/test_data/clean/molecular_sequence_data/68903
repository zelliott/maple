The frequency of beta-thalassemia alleles among Filipinos is estimated to be 0.02, although little is known about the actual mutations represented in this population. Here, we describe a Filipino family in which a child has severe beta-thalassemia major. Molecular studies of the family revealed that the proband is a compound heterozygote for two previously unreported beta zero-thalassemia alleles: a frameshift mutation (-TG) at codon 67 and a deletion of the entire beta-globin gene. The 5' endpoint of this novel deletion is located approximately 3.9 kb to approximately 4.3 kb upstream of beta-globin gene, and the deletion extends 3' beyond the beta-globin gene for an undetermined distance. The occurrence of two novel beta-thalassemia alleles in a single family suggests that the Filipino population may have a unique spectrum of beta-thalassemia alleles.
