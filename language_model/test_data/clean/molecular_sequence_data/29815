Here, we report isolation and developmental expression pattern of the zebrafish lysozyme C gene. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that the zebrafish lysozyme C protein shared approximately 37-80% identities with the mouse, human, chicken, and carp counterparts. Whole-mount in situ hybridization showed that the lysozyme C gene was expressed in macrophages, as its expression was co-localized with the known myeloid lineage markers L-plastin and PU.1. At 20 hours postfertilization (hpf), most of the lysozyme C positive cells were localized in the yolksac and head mesenchyme but not in the intermediate cell mass, supporting the notion that the primitive macrophage originated from the yolksac (Development 126 (1999) 3735). At 36hpf, the lysozyme C positive cells scattered within the head and yolksac, and began to appear in the caudal part of axial vein. By 6 days postfertilization (dpf), the lysozyme C positive cells accumulated in the kidney where hematopoiesis had been indicated to take place after 4dpf (Dev. Dyn. 214 (1999) 323). Taken together, our results demonstrate that the lysozyme C gene is specifically expressed in myeloid lineage, suggesting that it could serve as an excellent marker for genetic screening of both primitive and definitive myeloid lineage development in zebrafish.
