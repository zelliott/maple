ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) multidrug transporters confer multidrug resistance to pathogenic microorganisms and human tumour cells by mediating the extrusion of structurally unrelated chemotherapeutic drugs from the cell. The molecular basis by which ABC multidrug transporters bind and transport drugs is far from clear. Genetic analyses during the past 14 years reveal that the replacement of many individual amino acids in mammalian multidrug resistance P-glycoproteins can affect cellular resistance to drugs, but these studies have failed to identify specific regions in the primary amino acid sequence that are part of a defined drug-binding pocket. The recent publication of an X-ray crystallographic structure of the bacterial P-glycoprotein homologue MsbA and an MsbA-based homology model of human P-glycoprotein creates an opportunity to compare the original mutagenesis data with the three-dimensional structures of transporters. Our comparisons reveal that mutations that alter specificity are present in three-dimensional 'hotspot' regions in the membrane domains of P-glycoprotein.
