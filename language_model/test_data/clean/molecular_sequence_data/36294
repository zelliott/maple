The PTP-2 cDNA encoding an intracellular protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase-2) was isolated and sequenced from mouse testis and T-cell cDNA libraries. This PTP-2 cDNA was found to be homologous to human PTP-TC and rat PTP-S, and contained 1,551 nucleotides, including 1,146 nucleotides encoding 382 amino acids as well as 5' (61 nucleotides) and 3' (344 nucleotides) non-coding regions. Northern blot analysis indicated that PTP-2 mRNA of 1.9 Kb was most abundant in testis and kidney, although it was also present in spleen, muscle, liver, heart and brain.
