A gene bank was created from Prevotella intermedia strain 27 chromosomal DNA, and a clone was isolated that conferred the expression of two separate modes of hemolytic activity in recombinant Escherichia coli. The original recombinant hemolytic strain (EB34) contained plasmid, pEB34, with a 5.6-kb insert from Sau 3 AI-digested P. intermedia strain 27 chromosomal DNA cloned into the Bam HI site of pUC18. EB34 and deletion subclones were tested for expression of hemolytic activity in a standard tube assay, measuring lysis of erythrocytes spectrophotometrically as a function of hemoglobin release. Cell suspensions of EB34 demonstrated a dose-dependent hemolytic activity, inhibitable by proteases, and heat treatment but not dependent on calcium ions, and not inhibitable by osmoprotectants. Cell-free lysates also demonstrated a heat inhibitable, dose dependent hemolytic activity. Sub-cloning experiments localized the hemolytic region of the insert to a 3.9-kb fragment under direction of the lac promoter. Sequence analysis of the entire insert revealed the presence of multiple open reading frames (1 to 3) in this region which correlated to different forms of hemolytic expression, such that subclones containing all open reading frames 1 to 3 demonstrated strong hemolytic phenotype on blood plates and in the tube assay. Subclones containing only ORF1 demonstrated hemolysis on plates, but not in the tube assay. Subclones containing only open reading frames 2 and 3, but not ORF1 demonstrated hemolysis in the tube assay but not on plates. Homology searches of DNA and protein databases have not revealed significant homologies with reported hemolysins or proteins in any of the open reading frames.
