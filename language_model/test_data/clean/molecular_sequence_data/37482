The exopolysaccharide (EPS) from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus EU23 was perdeuteriomethylated and the perdeuteriomethylated EPS (pdm-EPS) purified by elution from a C(18) Sep-Pak cartridge. Both 1D and 2D NMR spectra were recorded for the pdm-EPS and these were interpreted to provide assignments for the individual 1H and 13C resonances of the sugar residues of the repeating unit. Using a combination of the results from monomer analysis and linkage analysis of the native EPS and the ROESY and HMBC NMR spectra of the pdm-EPS the following structure has been determined for the repeating unit:A process for characterising polysaccharides having low solubility in aqueous solution is reported.
