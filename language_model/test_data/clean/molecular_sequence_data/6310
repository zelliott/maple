The complete DNA sequence of the Streptomyces scabies (Ss) secY homolog and partial sequences of adjacent upstream and downstream open reading frames (ORFs) have been determined. The nucleotide sequence of a 2-kb region predicts a polypeptide of 437 amino acids in length with homology to the SecY protein family. The Ss secY homolog lies upstream from a sequence that has homology to the adenylate kinase gene (adk) family. The translational stop codon of the putative SecY ORF overlaps the predicted start codon for the Adk ORF. Another ORF that lies upstream from the secY homolog has sequence similarity to the genes that code for the L15 r-protein. Within the 243-bp intergenic region between the L15 and SecY coding sequences, the presence of a streptomycete-like promoter sequence and an 18-bp inverted repeat suggests that the secY homolog and the adjacent downstream sequences may be transcribed independently of the L15 coding sequence. Transcript analysis indicates that the secY homolog is expressed in both Ss and Streptomyces lividans. The proposed gene and transcript organization of the L15-SecY-Adk coding regions in the Ss clone resembles that of Micrococcus luteus which, like the streptomycetes, has a G+C-rich genome.
