Polymorphonuclear leukocytes contain well-defined proteolytic enzymes in their azurophilic granules that can be released into tissues during inflammation, producing a localized excess of proteases that causes a protease-antiprotease imbalance with subsequent tissue destruction. The antiproteolytic compounds of the epidermis, such as the protease inhibitors elafin and antileukoprotease, are thought to counteract the proteolytic tissue damage. We investigated the urine of patients suffering from inflammatory skin conditions (e.g., erysipelas, psoriasis) for the presence of urinary antiprotease activities. Purification of elastase-inhibitory activities from pooled urine samples by cation exchange high-performance liquid chromatography and preparative and analytical reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography yielded two different types of inhibitors. One was a cationic, acid-stable, and elastase-specific inhibitor of M(r) 6,000 by size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the first 28 residues showed identity with elafin, an elastase-specific inhibitor recently isolated from psoriatic scales. The second anti-protease activity was due to two forms of urinary bikunin, the inhibitory subunit of inter-alpha-inhibitor. Both bikunin fragments, with M(r) 4,000 and 16,000, were identified by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the first 10 residues and were characterized by an antiproteolytic profile against human leukocyte elastase, cathepsin G, and trypsin. Urinary protease inhibitors may serve as diagnostic markers of inflammatory diseases.
