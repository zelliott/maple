A fragment of cDNA and an intron-containing fragment of the human L19 ribosomal protein (RPL19) gene, and introns of the human ribosomal proteins S26 (RPS26) and L32 (RPL32) genes were cloned and sequenced. The intron-containing genes of these ribosomal proteins were mapped to human chromosomes by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a human/rodent hybrid DNA panel.
