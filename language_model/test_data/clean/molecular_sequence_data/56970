Two oligonucleotide primers were used in a polymerase chain reaction-protocol to amplify a region (approx. 850 bp) of the 16S rRNA gene of Aeromonas schubertii and Aeromonas jandaei. Hybridization of the polymerase chain reaction products to specific internal probes provided a highly specific method for the identification of these two species.
