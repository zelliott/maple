Sponges, the simplest and most ancient phylum of Metazoa, encode in their genome complex and highly sophisticated proteins that evolved together with multicellularity and are found only in metazoan animals. We report here the finding of a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK)-like protein in the marine sponge Suberites domuncula (Demospongiae). The nucleotide sequence of one sponge cDNA predicts a 700-aa-long protein, which contains all of the characteristic domains for the Tec family of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs). The highest homology (38% identity, 55% overall similarity) was found with human BTK and TEC PTKs. Sponge PTK was therefore named BtkSD. Human BTK is involved in the maturation of B cells and mutations in the BTK gene cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Kinases from the Tec family are not present in Caenorhabditis elegans and, until now, they were found only in insects and higher animal taxa. Our finding implies that the BTK/TEC genes are of a very ancient origin.
