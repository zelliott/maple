Spontaneous polymyxin-resistant mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. The mutations responsible for this phenotype were mapped to a two-component signal transduction system similar to PmrAB of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Lipid A of these mutants contained aminoarabinose, an inducible modification that is associated with polymyxin resistance. Thus, P. aeruginosa possesses a mechanism that induces resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides in response to environmental conditions.
