The measles virus induces a life-long immune response associated with antibodies specific for the fusion protein. To map the linear immunodominant recognition sites of the fusion (F) protein of the measles virus, we have reacted a complete set of 108 overlapping pentadecapeptides with purified IgG obtained from donor sera with elevated anti-measles titers. The antibodies recognized about 20% of the peptides and generated a characteristic binding pattern, defining about 6 or 7 distinctive regions (31-75; 111-145; 151-165; 191-215; 271-320; 421-440; 481-530) which include the major hydrophobic segment (111-145) of the intersubunit region and the C-terminal Cys-cluster region. The binding sites were located in close proximity of the few experimentally defined T cell epitopes. This pairing of T and B cell epitopes was corroborated by computer-assisted T cell prediction. The significance of a non-random association of T and B cell epitopes for processing and presentation is discussed. It is speculated that in long-term immunity against measles (F protein), B cells of the same sIg specificity play an important role both as antigen presenting cells and as antibody producing cells. In contrast to human sera from late convalescent donors, mouse and rabbit MV antisera with high neutralizing titers as well as neutralizing MV-F specific monoclonal antibodies did not react with the peptides.
