A new family of immunoadjuvants, long-chain stearyl esters of amino acids and peptides, are described and examined with bacterial and viral vaccines. The parent compound, stearyl tyrosine, displayed significant adjuvant activity with these vaccines. Stearyl glycyl glycine displayed superior activity with viral vaccines. A number of analogues of stearyl tyrosine were adjuvant-active. Further, these adjuvants were able to elicit a neutralizing antibody response. Stearyl tyrosine and stearyl ester analogues represent promising adjuvants for human vaccines.
