Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of matrix metalloproteinase3 (MMP3) promoter in the development and progression of gastric cancer of whole stomach has never been investigated in any population. We conducted a hospital-based case-control study to explore the MMP3 SNPs and their haplotypes with the risk of gastric cancer for the first time in eastern Indian population. A total of 218 gastric cancer patients and 175 healthy controls were genotyped for MMP3-1612 5A/6A (rs3025058) by PCR-RFLP and rechecked 10% by DNA sequencing. MMP3-707 A/G (rs522616) and MMP3-375 C/G (rs617819) were genotyped by DNA sequencing among 209 patients and 154 controls. MMP3-1612 5A6A genotype (P = 0.026, odds ratio (OR) = 1.756, confidence interval (CI) = 1.070-2.883), combined 5A5A and 5A6A genotype (P = 0.015, OR = 1.791, CI = 1.122-2.858) and 5A allele (P = 0.002, OR = 1.75, CI = 1.21-2.53) and; MMP3-707 GG genotype (P = < 0.0001; OR = 9.612; 95% CI = 3.403-27.147), combined GG and AG genotype (P = 0.001, OR = 2.201, CI = 1.385-3.498) and G allele (P = <0.0001, OR = 2.189, CI = 1.582-3.033) conferred significant risk for gastric cancer development. Also, tobacco addicted individuals with combined 5A5A and 5A6A genotype (P = 0.005, OR = 2.952, CI = 1.377-6.327) at -1612 position of MMP3 promoter displayed a higher risk to gastric cancer development. The genotypic combinations of all three MMP3 promoter polymorphisms and their haplotypes with increasing risk allele in a dose-dependent manner showed a potential risk for developing gastric cancer. The analyses suggested that the MMP3-707 G/G and MMP3-1612 5A/6A polymorphisms are potential independent predictors of gastric cancer risk development.
