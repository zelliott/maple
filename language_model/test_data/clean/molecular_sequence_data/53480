Mutations in CCR5 and CCR2b have been recently shown to affect disease progression towards AIDS. A role for these host genotypes in AIDS dementia complex (ADC) has also been postulated but remains unclear. Additionally, brain-derived envelope sequences from HIV-1 have been associated with ADC but their specific contribution to pathogenesis remains uncertain. This study demonstrates the successful use of PCR techniques to isolate host CCR5 and CCR2b, and HIV-1 V3 sequences from paraffin embedded tissues from patients with and without ADC. PCR amplification from archival tissue offers a novel approach for studying the interactions between potential neuroprotective elements in the host and virulence determinants in HIV that may contribute to differences in susceptibility to ADC.
