Cryptococcus adeliensis sp. nov. (CBS 8351) is described based on phenotypic characteristics and molecular sequence analysis of the D1/D2 large subunit and internal transcribed spacer regions of the ribosomal DNA. Molecular comparisons include species closely related to Cryptococcus albidus and several species isolated from the Antarctic. C. adeliensis, which has a cold-adapted xylanase, was isolated from Terre Adelie, Antarctica. ATCC 34633, which has a mesophilic xylanase, was identified as Cryptococcus albidosimilis.
