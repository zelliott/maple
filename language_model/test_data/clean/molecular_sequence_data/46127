Rhodnius prolixus undergoes a period of rapid diuresis after ingesting large blood meals. Neurohormones with either diuretic or anti-diuretic activity control diuresis by acting on several tissues including the Malpighian tubules. One of the neurohormones that potentially plays a role in diuresis is diuretic hormone 31 (DH(31)) which belongs to the insect calcitonin-like family of diuretic hormones. Here we determine the complete cDNA sequences of three Rhopr-DH(31) splice variants (Rhopr-DH(31)-A, Rhopr-DH(31)-B and Rhopr-DH(31)-C) and characterize their expression in unfed fifth-instar R. prolixus. Reverse transcriptase-PCR demonstrates that Rhopr-DH(31) is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) of unfed fifth-instars. However, the expression of the three splice variants differs with Rhopr-DH(31)-B expression being the highest followed by Rhopr-DH(31)-A and Rhopr-DH(31)-C, as determined using semi-quantitative Southern blot analysis. Fluorescent in situ hybridization reveals that Rhopr-DH(31) is expressed in a variety of cells in the CNS, including some neurosecretory cells.
