Computer analyses of amino acid sequences in the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein revealed that antigenic domains in the viral protein can be predicted on the basis of the physical properties of amino acids in the polypeptide chain. Relatively high values of surface probability, flexibility, and hydrophilicity were used as markers for domains of putative antigenicity. Comparison of the computer-predicted antigenic domains in the HIV-1 envelope with those reported experimentally indicate that computer analyses are able to predict antigenic domains. This study shows the usefulness of computer programs for the prediction of the antigenic domains in the HIV-1 envelope protein.
