The gene dak1 encoding a dihydroxyacetone kinase (DHAK) isoenzyme I, one of two isoenzymes in the Schizosaccharomyces pombe IFO 0354 strain, was cloned and sequenced. The dak1 gene comprises 1743 bp and encodes a protein of 62,245 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence showed a similarity to a putative DHAK of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and DHAK of Citrobacter freundii. The dak1 gene was expressed at a high level in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity and characterized. The acetone powder of recombinant E. coli cells was used to produce dihydroxyacetone phosphate.
