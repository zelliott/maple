Enhancer sequences of human papilloma virus (HPV) type 18 were used for screening of HeLa cells cDNA library in lambda gt11 using the protein binding method. Clones with YB I gene homology sequences were isolated. This gene is coding the protein which binds the regulatory region of Y gene of main histocompatibility complex (HLA 11). The YB I transcripts were revealed in all tested samples of cervical carcinomas. To analyze the protein the rabbit antibodies were produced to synthetic peptide, which corresponds to the most hydrophilic region of the protein. This antipeptide serum allowed to identify the nuclear 42K protein in HeLa cells as well as in normal fibroblasts.
