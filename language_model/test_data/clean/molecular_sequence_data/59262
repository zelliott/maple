We have isolated a full length cDNA clone (designated PTGRP) encoding a proline-rich protein from leaves of Lycopersicon chilense. Sequence analysis of the 552-bp insert revealed that the open reading frame encodes a 12.6-kDa protein. The deduced amino acid sequence of PTGRP consists of a C-terminal proline-rich domain with two identical repeat motifs Phe-Pro-Met-Pro-Thr-Thr-Pro-Ser-Thr-Gly-Gly-Gly-Phe-Pro-Ser. The N terminus lacks proline and is hydrophobic. Unlike other proline-rich proteins this protein contains five glycine-rich repeat motifs (Gly-X)n representative of glycine-rich proteins. Southern blot analysis showed that PTGRP is a member of a small gene family within the L. chilense genome. Northern blot experiments revealed that the PTGRP gene is significantly down regulated by water stress. PTGRP mRNA transcription decreased 5- to 10-fold in leaves and stems after 4-8 days of water stress. The mRNA reaccumulated when the drought-stressed plants were rewatered. The in situ hybridization experiments also revealed that PTGRP mRNAs were more abundant in leaf sections of plants watered regularly compared with those of plants submitted to water stress. Down regulation of the PTGRP gene was also observed in desiccated cell suspensions of L. chilense and in those treated with abscisic acid, mannitol, and NaCl. Based on the common features of proline-rich proteins (high proline content, repeated motifs, and a putative signal peptide) and their involvement in the cell wall, it is likely that the PTGRP protein is targeted to the cell wall. Its down regulation by drought could be correlated with the remodeling of the plant cell wall in response to water stress.
