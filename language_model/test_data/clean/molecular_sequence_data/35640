The nucleotide sequence of the Escherichia coli envM gene was determined. It codes for a protein of 262 amino acids. The sequences of the E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium EnvM proteins are 98% identical. Gene envM is preceded in E. coli by a 43-nucleotide-long structural element, termed 'box c', which occurs in several E. coli operons between structural genes. This sequence element is totally absent in S. typhimurium. Gene envM was mapped at coordinate position 1366.8 kb of the physical map of Kohara et al. (Cell, 1987, 50, 495-508). As in S. typhimurium, a Gly for Ser exchange at position 93 of the amino acid sequence leads to a diazaborine-resistant E. coli phenotype. A Ser for Phe exchange at position 241 of the EnvM protein results in a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype. Comparison of the EnvM amino acid sequence with sequences available in databases showed significant homology with the family of short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases.
