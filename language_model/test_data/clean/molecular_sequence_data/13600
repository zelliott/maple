The use of antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides as tools for modulating gene expression represents a novel strategy for designing drugs to treat a variety of diseases. Several factors, including cellular uptake and internalization of the phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide, are important parameters in determining the effectiveness of antisense agents as therapies. We have used cyclodextrin and its analogs as carriers to increase cellular uptake of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides. The studies were carried out using 35S-labeled and fluorescent-labeled phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide in human T cell leukemia H9 cell line. Cellular uptake of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide in the presence of cyclodextrin was found to be concentration and time dependent. Using various cyclodextrin analogs, e.g., 2-hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin (HPCD), hydroxyethyl beta-cyclodextrin (HECD), and a mixture of various hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrins (Encapsin), we observed increases in phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide uptake, up to twofold to threefold in 48 hours. Confocal microscopy studies confirmed that oligonucleotide was present intracellularly. Cyclodextrin itself was not toxic at the concentration used. Cyclodextrins did not seem to affect the efflux of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide from cells. Stability of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide against endogenous cellular nucleases remained unchanged in the presence of cyclodextrins. These studies suggest that cyclodextrin and its analogs might be used successfully as carriers for oligonucleotide and analogs.
