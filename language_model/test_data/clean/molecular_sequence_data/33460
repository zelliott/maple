Endophytic microorganisms reside asymptomatically within plants and are a source of new bioactive products for use in medicine, agriculture, and industry. Colletotrichum (teleomorph Glomerella) is a fungus widely cited in the literature as a producer of antimicrobial substances. Identification at the species level, however, has been a problem in this type of study. Several authors have reported the presence of endophytic fungi from the medicinal plant Maytenus ilicifolia ("espinheira-santa") in Brazil that has antimicrobial activity against various pathogens. Therefore, Colletotrichum strains were isolated from M. ilicifolia and identified based on morphology, RAPD markers, sequence data of the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS-1 and ITS-2), the 5.8S gene, and species-specific PCR. The analyses suggested the presence of 2 species, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Colletotrichum boninense. Two morphological markers were characterized to allow C. gloeosporioides and C. boninense to be distinguished quickly and accurately. The molecular diagnosis of C. boninense was confirmed by using Col1 and ITS4 primers. This species of Colletotrichum is reported for the first time in M. ilicifolia.
