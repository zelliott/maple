Deletions are the most common molecular defect in steroid sulfatase (STS) deficiency. We describe the application of multiplex DNA amplification, by polymerase chain reaction, for deletion screening in patients with STS deficiency (STS-PCR). Genomic DNA from 38 unrelated patients was amplified using two sets of primers, corresponding to the 5' and the 3' ends of the STS gene. The analysis of the amplified products was always consistent with the results obtained by Southern analysis. This method represents a sensitive fast non-radioactive test for detecting STS gene deletions.
