Although the gene (cna) encoding the Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) collagen adhesin is not present in all strains, the DNA both upstream and downstream of cna is present in all Sa strains. Using oligo primers corresponding to the conserved nt flanking cna and template DNA from Sa strains that do not encode cna, we amplified a 372-bp fragment. These results illustrate that the conserved regions upstream and downstream of cna are contiguous in strains that do not encode cna. Using primers corresponding to the conserved flanking DNA together with primers corresponding to the 5' and 3' ends of cna, we also amplified DNA fragments containing the junctions between the cna genetic element and the conserved flanking sequences. Sequence comparisons of the amplification products from four cna negative and four cna positive strains revealed that cna is within a discrete genetic element that extends 202 bp upstream from the cna start codon and 100 bp downstream of the cna stop codon. Sequence analysis of the ends of the cna element did not reveal any of the repeats characteristic of transposable elements. These results suggest that cna may be part of a larger element (e.g., a phage) that may or may not contain cna. Alternatively, cna may be a subject to a precise excision event resulting in its deletion from the chromosome. Based on sequence analysis of the flanking DNA amplified from strains that do not encode cna, the presence of a cna genetic element does not disrupt an ORF.
