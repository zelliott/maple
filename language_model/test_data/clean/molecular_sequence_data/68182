A DNA-based method was developed to genotype donors for the human platelet antigens HPA-1a and -1b. Sequence-specific primers (SSP) were used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which allowed the HPA-1a/1a, -1b/1b and -1a/1b genotypes to be determined by PCR alone, no second analytical stage was required. 10 donors were tested by PCR-SSP and the results were concordant with serological phenotyping and independent DNA analysis.
