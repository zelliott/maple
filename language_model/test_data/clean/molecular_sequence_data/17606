The amino acid sequences of various endo-N-acetyl-glucosaminidases (chitinases) have been subjected to hydrophobic cluster analysis. A domain of approximately 145 residues was found to be weakly conserved in chitinase A and B from the bacterium Serriata marcescens, in a chitinase from cucumber (Cucumis sativis) and in the endo-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase H of Streptomyces plicatus. A prediction of the putative active site region was made upon analysis of invariant acidic amino acids. On the basis of primary structure homologies, a classification into families of structurally related proteins is proposed for the enzymes hydrolyzing beta-1,4-N-acetyl-glucosamine linkages.
