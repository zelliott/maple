Human papillomavirus type 5 (HPV 5) induces cutaneous lesions and persists in skin carcinomas of patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV). We investigated the expression pattern of HPV 5 in biopsies from benign skin lesions of EV patients by cDNA analysis and in situ hybridization. Nine different cDNAs could be generated from total RNA of one of these lesions by reverse transcription and PCR amplification with HPV 5-specific primers. We could identify two major splice donors: one was found in the E6-proximal part of the noncoding region (NCR), and the other just downstream of the first ATG codon of ORF E1. Each of the characterized transcripts was processed at one or the other donor site and the two corresponding leader exons were found in combination with both 3'-early and late exons. Two transcripts appear to be specific for EV-associated papillomaviruses: one species might encode an E1--E2C fusion protein, and the other mRNA (NCR/E2) is probably encoding for the full-length E2 protein. According to the results of the cDNA analysis, riboprobes were designed for in situ hybridization experiments to study the cell differentiation-dependent expression of the different exons. Only the E7/E1 and E4 probes led to strong signals almost throughout the epithelium. The signals generated by the 5'-E2 and E1 probe increased with cell differentiation and were mainly confined to the nucleus. The NCR, E6, E7, L2, and L1 probes yielded more or less strong signals in the terminally differentiated epidermal layers. The difference in the cell differentiation-dependent expression of the 5'-early region exon (probe E7/1) and L2/L1 exons may point to a differentiation-dependent processing of transcripts.
