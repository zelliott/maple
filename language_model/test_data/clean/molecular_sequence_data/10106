Juvenile nephronophthisis (NPH), an autosomal recessive cystic kidney disease, is the primary genetic cause of chronic renal failure in children. About two thirds of patients with NPH carry a large homozygous deletion at the gene locus NPH1 on 2q13. We here identify a novel gene. NPHP1, which extends over most of this common deletion. The 4.5-kb transcript encodes a protein with an SH3 domain, which is highly conserved throughout evolution. The 11-kb interval between the 3' end of NPHP1 and an inverted repeat containing the distal deletion breakpoint was found to contain the first exon of a second gene, MALL. In patients with a hemizygous deletion of the NPH1 region, additional point mutations were found in NPHP1 but not in MALL.
