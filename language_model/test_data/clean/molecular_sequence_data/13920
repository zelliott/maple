Enterococcus faecalis blood isolates were probed for the serine protease activator of cytolysin (cylA) and aggregation substance (asa1), traits that generally reside on pheromone-responsive plasmids, to determine how commonly these genotypes were associated with disease. In dot blot assays, no significant difference was found in the frequency of asa1 for blood isolates [55 of 103 (54%)] and isolates recovered from stool [9 of 14 (60%); P > 0.1, chi 2 test]. In contrast, cylA occurred more frequently among bacteremia isolates [34 of 68 (50%)] than endocarditis [4 of 35 (11%)] or stool isolates (0 of 14; P < 0.001; chi 2 test). However, when the clonality of isolates was accounted for, the frequency of asa1 and cylA among unrelated strains was not significantly different among the three sets of strains (P > 0.2, chi 2 test). The lack of enrichment for asa1 or cylA among clonally unrelated E. faecalis bloodstream isolates fails to support a role for plasmid-encoded aggregation substance or cytolysin in the transition from bacteremia to endocarditis. Clonally related, cytolytic strains, however, demonstrated an increased propensity to cause bloodstream infection.
