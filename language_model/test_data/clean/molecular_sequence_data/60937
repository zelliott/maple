Deregulation of the cytokine network is an important adaptation of pathogenic bacteria to modulate and evade a host immune response. Here we describe that IL-6 is rapidly and efficiently cleaved and inactivated by the arginine- and lysine-specific proteinases from Porphyromonas gingivalis, referred to as RGP-A, RGP-B, and KGP. One of the primary cleavage sites for RGPs has been mapped between R18 and Q19 within the N-terminal region of the IL-6 polypeptide chain; however, both KGP and RGPs cleave IL-6 within the C-terminal region of the polypeptide chain. After these initial proteolytic cleavages, IL-6 is further degraded by each of the enzymes tested. Although KGP is the most potent IL-6-degrading proteinase, the initial C-terminal cleavage of IL-6 mediated by all gingipains is already sufficient to inactivate this cytokine. Our data are consistent with the observation that in periodontitis the IL-6 concentration is lowest in the gingival tissue adjacent to bacterial plaque, whereas significantly elevated concentrations of this cytokine are detected around the infected area. Degradation of IL-6 by gingipains may, therefore, represent an additional mechanism which influences the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory reactions at distal versus proximal sites from the periodontal plaque.
