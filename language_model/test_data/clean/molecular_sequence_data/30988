Computer analysis of rabies virus glycoprotein G provides a means for identification of functional domains in the viral glycoprotein. The computer analysis suggested 22 putative antigenic domains, of which three are RG-containing amino acid sequences that might be involved in the binding of rabies virions to cellular receptors. Synthetic RG peptides may be able to interfere with rabies virus adsorption to cellular receptors.
