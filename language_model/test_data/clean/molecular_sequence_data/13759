A single mapping resource, a mouse/human somatic cell panel with average distance between breakpoints of 1.2 Mb and a potential resolution of 1 Mb, has been utilized to integrate the genetic map and a transcript map of human chromosome 16. This map includes 141 genetic markers and 200 genes and transcripts. The localization of four genes (CHEL3, TK2, TRG1, and MMP9) reported to map to chromosome 16 could not be confirmed, and for three of these localizations to other human chromosomes are reported. A correlation between genetic and physical distance over a region estimated to be 23 Mb on the short arm of chromosome 16 identified an interval demonstrating a greatly increased rate of recombination where, in females, 1 cM is equivalent to a physical distance of 100 kb.
