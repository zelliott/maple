Two copies of the gene atp9, encoding subunit 9 of the mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase, have been cloned from the Tokumasu radish (Raphanus sativus L.) cytoplasm. The genomic DNA and the corresponding cDNA sequences of the coding regions were determined. Both alleles contain a 222 bp long and well conserved atp9 reading frame, coding for a 74 amino acid polypeptide. The Tokumasu atp9-1 gene may have a unique N-terminal extension of 11 amino acid residue relative to other plant atp9 genes. In comparison of cDNA and genomic sequences four RNA editing events were found in both atp9 genes. Northern experiments indicate different transcription patterns for the two genes.
