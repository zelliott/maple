A taxonomic study employing a polyphasic approach was performed on a novel anaerobic bacterium isolated from natural gas production-water. The bacterium stained Gram-negative and consisted of non-motile, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped cells. Products of glucose or starch fermentation were ethanol, CO2, formate, acetate and H2. The predominant fatty acids were C16 : 0 ALDE and summed feature 3 comprising C16 : 1ω7c and/or C16 : 1ω6c. The DNA G+C content was 45.5 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis demonstrated that the nearest phylogenetic neighbours of the novel strain were Acetivibrio multivorans DSM 6139(T) (98.5 %) and Proteiniclasticum ruminis JCM 14817(T) (95.4 %). The DNA-DNA hybridization value between the novel organism and Acetivibrio multivorans PeC1 DSM 6139(T) was determined to be only 30.2 %, demonstrating the separateness of the two species. Based on phylogenetic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic evidence that clearly distinguished strain 232.1(T) from Proteiniclasticum ruminis and other close relatives, it is proposed that the novel isolate be classified as representing a novel species of a new genus within the family Clostridiaceae, Youngiibacter fragilis gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of the type species is 232.1(T) ( = ATCC BAA-2257(T) = DSM 24749(T)). In addition, Acetivibrio multivorans is proposed to be reclassified as Youngiibacter multivorans comb. nov.
