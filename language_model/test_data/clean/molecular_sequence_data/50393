We have utilized a PCR-based analysis of single-strand conformation polymorphisms to identify polymorphisms that can be used for mapping cloned DNA sequences in the mouse. We have found that single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of sequences that are potentially less subject to conservation (i.e., intron and 3' untranslated regions) is a relatively efficient means of detecting polymorphisms between inbred strains. Fifty percent of the tested primer pairs were polymorphic between inbred strains and 90% were polymorphic between mouse species, which is a frequency comparable to that found for microsatellite repeat sequences. We have found that this technique can be readily used to determine the strain distribution pattern in a recombinant inbred series and is a simple and rapid means to obtain a map position for cloned sequences. When this strategy was tested on a number of previously mapped cloned genes, the strain distribution patterns obtained were consistent with that to be expected on the basis of the known map position. We also tested the utility of this approach for characterizing genes that have not been previously mapped. Dvl, the mouse homolog of the putative Drosophila dishevelled gene, and Adfp, encoding an adipocyte differentiation-related protein, were found to map to chromosome 4. These results were confirmed using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of an interspecific backcross.
