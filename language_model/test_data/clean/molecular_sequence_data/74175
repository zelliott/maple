The serotonin transporter, SERT, is reported as a key molecule that regulates serotonergic neurotransmission. In the present study, we analyzed the localization of Lymnaea SERT (LymSERT) mRNA-containing neurons by in situ hybridization using frozen sections of the central nervous system (CNS) of Lymnaea. To precisely demonstrate the distribution of LymSERT mRNA-containing neurons, colocalization with serotonin immunoreactivity was also examined. The results showed that LymSERT mRNA was constitutively expressed and localized in the serotonin-containing neurons in the CNS.
