Some Bence-Jones proteins have been found to be capable of hydrolyzing DNA, chromogenic amide substrates, such as benzoylarginine p-nitroanilide, and natural oligopeptides, such as arginine vasopressin. Patients who excrete Bence-Jones protein with the DNA-nicking activity have shown moderately severe symptoms. When incubated with LLC-PK1 (porcine kidney proximal tubule) cells, some Bence Jones proteins penetrated the cytoplasm, and entered the nucleus with little or no degradation of epitopes. Intranuclear Bence Jones proteins ultimately induced DNA fragmentation in situ and cell death. This cytocidal activity was not directly associated with the DNA-nicking activity, since Bence Jones proteins with no detectable DNase activity also produced cell death. These results, however, suggest that the biological activities of Bence Jones proteins described here makes a significant contribution to the development and/or deterioration of multiple myeloma.
