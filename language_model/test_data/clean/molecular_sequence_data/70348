The immunohistochemical occurrence of sarafotoxin (SRTX), a snake venom peptide under strong evolutionary control, was investigated in the pulmonary diffuse neuroendocrine system (PDNES) of newborn cats and rats. By applying the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method on serial lung sections, we have demonstrated its distribution and colocalization with different endothelin (ET) isoforms. A light microscopic study revealed apparent immunostaining for SRTX in neuronal components and smooth muscle tissue and in neuroepithelial bodies (NEB), while isolated neuroendocrine cells (NEC) remain unlabelled. Comparison of the SRTX reactivity pattern with that of different ET peptides on adjacent lung sections showed colocalization of SRTX-b with ET-3 in NEB, intrapulmonary ganglion cells and nerve fibres, on the one hand, and with ET-1 in airway and vascular smooth muscle cells, on the other. These findings, in addition to the remarkable functional and structural similarities between SRTX and ET peptides, suggest a common evolutionary origin and biological significance of sarafotoxin and endothelins. Moreover, this is the first time that a toxic peptide has been demonstrated in the PDNES.
