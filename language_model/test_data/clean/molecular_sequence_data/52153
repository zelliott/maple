A restriction map of the genome of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a small human pathogenic bacterium, was constructed by means of an ordered cosmid library which spans the complete bacterial chromosome. The positions of 143 endonuclease EcoRI restriction fragments were determined and aligned with the physical map. In addition, restriction sites for the rare-cutting enzymes XhoI (25 sites), ApaI (13 sites), NotI (2 sites), and SfiI (2 sites) were included. The resulting map consists of 185 restriction sites, has a mean resolution of 4.4 kbp, and predicts a genome size of 809 kbp. In addition, several genes were identified and mapped to their respective genomic EcoRI restriction fragments.
