We describe the isolation and preliminary characterization of a new G alpha gene (dgq) in Drosophila. The dgq gene is differentially spliced, yielding two putative proteins, both of which contain guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis domains and share 50% identity with transducins and other G proteins. These proteins represent a new class of G alpha subunits because they lack both high amino acid identity with other G alpha proteins and the pertussis toxin ADP ribosylation site. The dgq mRNA is detected by RNA-RNA Northern hybridization in wild-type heads but not in wild-type bodies or in the mutant eyes absent heads. Tissue in situ hybridization detects dgq expression only in the retina and ocellus of the adult head, making it a prime candidate for encoding the Drosophila transducin analog, the G protein required for phototransduction.
