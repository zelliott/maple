The compact genome of the Japanese pufferfish, Fugu rubripes, about 7.5 times smaller than the human genome, facilitates the isolation of vertebrate genes. We have used this genome to isolate and characterize members of the vertebrate serine/threonine protein phosphatase gene family. Our data reveal the presence of two isoforms of PP2A, alpha and beta, and PPX, as previously found in mammals.
