We isolated two similar, but distinct, cDNA classes that encode Xenopus double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) adenosine deaminase. The longest, full-length open reading frame (ORF) predicts a 1,270-amino acid protein of 138,754 Da that is similar in size and about 50% identical to proteins encoded by mammalian cDNAs, yet larger than the 120-kDa protein purified from Xenopus eggs. Alignments of the Xenopus and mammalian ORFs show N-terminal heterogeneity, three conserved dsRNA binding motifs (dsRBMs), and strongly conserved carboxyl termini. Consistent with the observation of two cDNA classes, northern analyses of Xenopus oocyte poly A+ RNA show at least three mRNA species. Multiple nuclear polyadenylation hexamers and putative cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements were found in the 3' UTRs of cDNAs corresponding to the largest mRNA. In vitro translation experiments show that the cDNAs encode active deaminases and that the entire N-terminus and first dsRBM are dispensable for deaminase activity. Importantly, an analysis of the C-termini of five known dsRNA adenosine deaminases, and two putative deaminases, reveals motifs that are strikingly similar to the conserved motifs of the DNA-(adenine-N6alpha)-aminomethyltransferases and the DNA-(cytosine-5)-methyltransferases.
