Regulatory proteases modulate proteomic dynamics with a spectrum of specificities against substrate proteins. Substrate phage display is one of the key methodologies in producing substrate sequence information in vitro. Factor Xa, a key regulatory protease in the blood coagulation system, is used as a model system to demonstrate a high-throughput procedure to quantitatively characterize substrate sequences and their susceptibilities for enzymatic cleavage. This methodology can be generalized to proteases for which the active forms (not necessarily purified forms) are available for the in vitro experiments.
