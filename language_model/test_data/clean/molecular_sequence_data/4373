A reducing glucose-carrying polymer, called poly [3-O-(4'-vinylbenzyl)-D-glucose] (PVG), interacted with erythrocytes carrying the type-1 glucose transporter (GLUT-1) on the cell membrane. The cooperative interaction between a number of GLUT-1s and a number of reducing 3-O-methyl-D-glucose moieties on a PVG polymer chain is responsible for the increase in the interaction with erythrocytes. In contrast to the PVG homopolymer, other sugar-carrying polymers showed lower interaction with erythrocytes. The affinity of erythrocytes and PVG was studied using FITC-labeled glycopolymers. The fluorescence intensity significantly changed, whereas a small change in fluorescence intensity was observed for other homopolymers. The specific interaction between GLUT-1 on erythrocytes and the PVG polymer carrying reducing glucose was suppressed by the inhibitors, phloretin, phloridzin, and cytochalasin B, and a monoclonal antibody to GLUT-1. Direct observation by confocal laser microscopy with the use of FITC-labeled PVG demonstrated that erythrocytes interacted with the soluble form of the PVG polymer via GLUT-1, while fluorescence labeling of the cell surface was prevented on pretreatment with the monoclonal antibody to GLUT-1.
