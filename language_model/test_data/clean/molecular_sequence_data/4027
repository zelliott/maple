The interaction of a variety of aspartic proteinases with a recombinant tomato protein produced in Pichia pastoris was investigated. Only human cathepsin D and, even more potently, proteinase A from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were inhibited. The tomato polypeptide has >80% sequence identity to a previously reported potato inhibitor of cathepsin D. Re-evaluation of the potato inhibitor revealed that it too was more potent (>20-fold) towards yeast proteinase A than cathepsin D and so might be renamed the potato inhibitor of proteinase A. The potency towards yeast proteinase A may reflect a similarity between this fungal enzyme and aspartic proteinases produced by fungal pathogens which attack tomato and/or potatoes.
