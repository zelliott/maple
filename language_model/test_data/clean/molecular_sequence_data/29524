Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a group of metabolic disorders with multisystemic involvement characterized by abnormalities in the synthesis of N-linked oligosaccharides. The most common form, CDG-Ia, resulting from mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme phosphomannomutase (PMM2), manifests with severe abnormalities in psychomotor development, dysmorphic features and visceral involvement. While this disorder is panethnic, we present the first cases of CDG-Ia identified in an African American family with two affected sisters. The proband had failure to thrive in infancy, hypotonia, ataxia, cerebellar hypoplasia and developmental delay. On examination, she also exhibited strabismus, inverted nipples and an atypical perineal fat distribution, all features characteristic of CDG-Ia. Direct sequencing demonstrated that the patient had a unique genotype, T237M/c.565-571 delAGAGAT insGTGGATTTCC. The novel deletion-insertion mutation, which was confirmed by subcloning and sequencing of each allele, introduces a stop codon 11 amino acids downstream from the site of the deletion. The presence of this deletion-insertion mutation at cDNA position 565 suggests that this site in the PMM2 gene may be a hotspot for chromosomal breakage.
