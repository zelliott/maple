Prodynorphin (ProDYN) in the anterior pituitary gland appears to be processed differently from the brain, and the ProDYN-derived peptides may function differently in the anterior pituitary than in the brain. To further investigate the roles of ProDYN-derived peptides in the anterior pituitary, we have determined the nucleotide (nt) sequence of the cDNA encoding bovine ProDYN. This is the first time a complete cDNA sequence for ProDYN has been reported. The nt and deduced amino acid (aa) sequences were compared to the known ProDYN of other species. Northern blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) combined with Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the expression of ProDYN in both the anterior and posterior pituitary glands was much lower than that in the neural tissues of the striatum and hypothalamus.
