A cDNA clone which contains the near-complete open reading frame (ORF) encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, EC 1.2.1.12) was obtained by screening a muscle cDNA library of jerboa (Jaculus orientalis), a true hibernating rodent, with a PCR-amplified 0.5-kb genomic DNA probe from an internal region of the gene. The 1.1-kb cDNA clone consists of a 927-bp ORF which codifies for 309 aa, about 93% of the original GapC gene encoding the 36-kDa protein, and a 3'-noncoding region of 167 bp. The full-length aa sequence of GAPDH was achieved by sequencing the N-terminal region of the purified protein completing the missing part in the cDNA clone. Both nt and aa sequences exhibit a high degree of homology to other mammalian GAPDHs. The expression of the GapC gene was studied in skeletal muscle and liver of euthermic and hibernating jerboas both on the mRNA level by Northern blot hybridization using the cDNA clone as a probe and on the protein level by Western blot immunodetection using an antibody raised against muscle GAPDH. A clear decrease (about threefold) in the amount of GapC mRNA, a single 1.2-kb transcript, was observed in muscle of hibernating jerboa when compared with the same tissue from the euthermic animal. This mRNA level decrease directly correlates with a reduction in both protein amount and specific activity in crude protein extracts. In contrast, both GAPDH protein and GapC mRNA levels remained unchanged in liver from euthermic and hibernating jerboas although the enzymatic activity was also about threefold lower in the hibernating tissue. These result, together with previous data obtained from protein studies [Soukri et al. (1995) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1243, 161-168 and (1996) 1292, 177-187] indicate that jerboa GAPDH is regulated by different mechanisms during hibernation in these tissues, that is, at transcriptional level in muscle and at posttranslational level in liver. The reduced GAPDH activity should result in both cases in a decrease of the glycolytic flux that would eventually contribute to the dramatic metabolic depression of this dormant state.
