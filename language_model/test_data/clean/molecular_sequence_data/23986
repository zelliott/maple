N-Glycosylation of cellobiohydrolase I from the fungus Trichoderma reesei (strain Rut-C30) is studied using a combination of electrophoretic, chromatographic and mass spectrometric techniques. As four potential N-glycosylation sites and several uncharged and phosphorylated high-mannose glycans are present, a large number of glycoforms and phospho-isoforms can be expected. Isoelectric focusing both in gel and in capillary format was successfully applied for the separation of the phospho-isoforms. They were extracted in their intact form from the gel and subsequently analysed by nanospray-Q-TOF-MS, thereby making use of a powerful two-dimensional technique. Nano-LC/MS/MS on a Q-Trap MS further allowed the determination of the glycosylation sites. As a novel approach, an oxonium ion was used in precursor ion scanning for selective detection of glycopeptides containing phosphorylated high-mannose glycans.
