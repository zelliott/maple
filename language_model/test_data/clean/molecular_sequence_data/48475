Enantioselective oxidation of racemic phenyl-1,2-ethanediol into (R)-(-)-mandelic acid by a newly isolated Brevibacterium lutescens CCZU12-1 was demonstrated. It was found that optically active (R)-(-)-mandelic acid (e.e.p > 99.9 %) is produced leaving the other enantiomer (S)-(+)-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol intact. Using fed-batch method, a total of 172.9 mM (R)-(-)-mandelic acid accumulated in the reaction mixture after the seventh feed. Moreover, oxidation of phenyl-1,2-ethanediol using calcium alginate-entrapped resting cells was carried out in the aqueous system, and efficient biocatalyst recycling was achieved as a result of cell immobilization in calcium alginate, with a product-to-biocatalyst ratio of 27.94 g (R)-(-)-mandelic acid g⁻¹ dry cell weight cell after 16 cycles of repeated use.
