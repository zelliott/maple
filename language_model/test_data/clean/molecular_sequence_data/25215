The traC gene of the F plasmid tra operon is required for the assembly of mature F-pilin subunits into extended F pili. The nucleotide sequence of traC was determined with a determined with a deduced coding region of 875 amino acids (aa) and 99066 Da. The traC1044 mutant allele, which allows filamentous phage infection in the absence of piliation, contains a C-to-T transition leading to an Arg----Cys substitution. Confirmation of the translational start came from the direct N-terminal aa sequencing of a TraC-alkaline phosphatase fusion protein.
