Segments of a cDNA encoding human plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) were subcloned into a highly regulated and inducible Escherichia coli expression system. A plasmid encoding the mature form of human endothelial PAI-1 produced a functional recombinant molecule, as indicated by its ability to inhibit tissue plasminogen activator's enzymatic activity. In contrast to PAI-1 isolated from human fibrosarcoma cells, the biological activity of the recombinant PAI-1 was not dependent on pretreatment with denaturing agents. A construct encoding a polypeptide lacking the first 80 amino acids of PAI-1 also produced elevated levels of the truncated recombinant protein. However, this truncated product was functionally inactive, indicating that an intact N terminus is required for activity.
