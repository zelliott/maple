The gene of Marek's disease virus serotype 2 (MDV2) homologous to the UL52 gene of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) was identified and characterized. The MDV2 UL52 homologous gene encodes 1,071 amino acids with a molecular weight of 118.7 kDa, which includes putative metal-binding site and overlapping region with the UL53 homologous gene. Although a putative polyadenylation signal sequence was found in the downstream of the MDV2 UL52 gene, a MDV2 UL52 DNA probe reacted only with the polycistronic 6.3 kb transcript, representing the UL52 and the downstream genes of UL53 and UL54. Transcriptional pattern of this region of MDV2 was somewhat different from corresponding regions of HSV-1 and infectious laryngotracheitis virus.
