The 4.2-kb cryptic plasmid pVA380-1 has been used as a vector for the cloning of antibiotic resistance genes directly in streptococci, and in the construction of Escherichia coli/Streptococcus shuttle vectors. The results of subcloning experiments located the basic replicon of pVA380-1 within a 2.5-kb region. The nucleotide base sequence of this region was determined and contained a single complete open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 237-amino-acid peptide with a predicted size of 29 kDa. This peptide and a region of the DNA molecule 5' to the ORF encoding it shared homology with the replication protein and plus origin, respectively, of the Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pUB110. Data from Tn5 mutagenesis and complementation studies indicated that the protein product of the ORF was required for pVA380-1 replication in streptococci. Deletion of a region of the basic replicon distal to the plus origin and ORF produced an unstable derivative, and resulted in the accumulation of single-stranded replicative intermediates, consistent with the loss of a minus origin. All of these results suggest that pVA380-1 replicates by a rolling circle mode, and is most closely related to the pC194 family of single-stranded DNA plasmids.
