Capillary electrophoresis is a rapid and versatile electrophoretic technique that has found several applications in the field of peptide synthesis. The high resolution and charge-based separation capabilities make it very complementary to RP-HPLC. In addition, both are essentially quantitative, which makes them ideal as purity assessment techniques. Capillary electrophoresis can be used to monitor any charge-related changes in synthetic peptides such as incomplete deprotection or chemical modifications. Capillary electrophoresis can also be very sensitive to changes in the shape or size of a peptide. However, its greatest value for the characterization of synthetic peptides is when it is used in combination with other analytical techniques such as mass spectrometry, HPLC, and amino acid analysis.
