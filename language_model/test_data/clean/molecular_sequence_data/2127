The nucleotide sequence of the F plasmid transfer gene traH, which is involved in F-pilus assembly in Escherichia coli K-12, has been determined. From the sequence data, it would appear that traH encodes a 38,897-dalton precursor polypeptide which is processed to give a periplasmic protein. Furthermore, a new gene, trbF, has been located immediately upstream of traH and shown to be expressed by means of a translational fusion to lacZ. Using galK fusion and S1 nuclease protection studies, a weak traJ-dependent promoter, P trbF, has been mapped upstream and adjacent to trbF. Transcription of trbF and traH from P trbF may well serve to complement transcription from the major tra operon promoter PY located some 16 kb upstream of these genes.
