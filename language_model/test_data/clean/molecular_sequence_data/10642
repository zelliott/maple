We studied two coryneform strains from clinical specimens. These strains had type IV and corynemycolic acids in their cell walls and also had phenotypic characteristics, such as urease activity and fermentation of glucose and sucrose but not trehalose, which did not permit assignment to any previously recognized taxon. According to DNA-DNA hybridization data, these two strains are members of the same species (level of DNA similarity, 86%). Phylogenetic analysis based on comparisons of almost complete small-subunit ribosomal DNA sequences revealed that these strains are closely related to Corynebacterium minutissimum, but DNA relatedness experiments clearly showed that they constitute a distinct new species with a level of DNA relatedness to the C. minutissimum type strain of less than 40%. This new species can be differentiated from C. minutissimum strains by its enzymatic activities and carbon source utilization, and the name Corynebacterium singulare is proposed for it. The type strain is strain IBS B52218 (= CCUG 37330), which was isolated from a semen specimen.
