A Gram-negative, motile, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped strain, TF-27(T) (=KCCM 41648(T)=JCM 11814(T)), was isolated from a tidal flat in Korea. This organism grew well at 25-35 degrees C, with optimum growth at 30 degrees C. Strain TF-27(T) grew optimally in the presence of 2 % NaCl; it did not grow without NaCl or in the presence of >8 % NaCl. Strain TF-27(T) simultaneously contained both menaquinones and ubiquinones as isoprenoid quinones. The predominant menaquinone was MK-7 and the predominant ubiquinones were Q-7 and Q-8. The major fatty acids in strain TF-27(T) were iso-C(15 : 0) (20.6 %) and iso-C(15 : 0) 2-OH and/or C(16 : 1)omega7c (21.1 %). The DNA G+C content of strain TF-27(T) was 42 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rDNA sequences showed that strain TF-27(T) falls within the radiation of the cluster that is encompassed by the genus Shewanella. Levels of 16S rDNA sequence similarity between strain TF-27(T) and the type strains of Shewanella species were 93.2-96.8 %. On the basis of phenotypic properties and phylogenetic data, strain TF-27(T) should be placed in the genus Shewanella as a novel species, for which the name Shewanella gaetbuli sp. nov. is proposed.
