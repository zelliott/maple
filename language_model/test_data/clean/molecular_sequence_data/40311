Cj0859c variants fspA1 and fspA2 from 669 human, poultry, and bovine Campylobacter jejuni strains were associated with certain hosts and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) types. Among the human and poultry strains, fspA1 was significantly (P < 0.001) more common than fspA2. FspA2 amino acid sequences were the most diverse and were often truncated.
