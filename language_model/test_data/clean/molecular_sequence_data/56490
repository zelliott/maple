The human platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor gene exists as a single copy on chromosome 1. We identified two 5'-noncoding exons, each of which has distinct transcriptional initiation sites. These exons are alternatively spliced to a common splice acceptor site on a third exon that contains the total open reading frame to yield two different species of functional mRNA (Transcript 1 and 2). Transcript 1 has consensus sequences for transcription factor NF-kappa B and Sp-1, and the Initiator (Inr) sequence homologous to the murine terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase gene. Transcript 2 also contains consensus sequences for transcription factor AP-1, AP-2, and Sp-1. Transcripts 1 and 2 were both detected in heart, lung, spleen, and kidney, whereas only Transcript 1 was found in peripheral leukocytes, a differentiated human eosinophilic cell line (EoL-1 cells), and brain. Existence of distinct promoters was thus suggested to play a role in the regulatory control of PAF receptor gene expression in different human tissues and cells.
