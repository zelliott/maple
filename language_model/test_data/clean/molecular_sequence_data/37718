A whole genome cattle-hamster radiation hybrid cell panel was used to construct a map of 54 markers located on bovine chromosome 5 (BTA5). Of the 54 markers, 34 are microsatellites selected from the cattle linkage map and 20 are genes. Among the 20 mapped genes, 10 are new assignments that were made by using the comparative mapping by annotation and sequence similarity strategy. A LOD-3 radiation hybrid framework map consisting of 21 markers was constructed. The relatively low retention frequency of markers on this chromosome (19%) prevented unambiguous ordering of the other 33 markers. The length of the map is 398.7 cR, corresponding to a ratio of approximately 2.8 cR(5,000)/cM. Type I genes were binned for comparison of gene order among cattle, humans, and mice. Multiple internal rearrangements within conserved syntenic groups were apparent upon comparison of gene order on BTA5 and HSA12 and HSA22. A similarly high number of rearrangements were observed between BTA5 and MMU6, MMU10, and MMU15. The detailed comparative map of BTA5 should facilitate identification of genes affecting economically important traits that have been mapped to this chromosome and should contribute to our understanding of mammalian chromosome evolution.
