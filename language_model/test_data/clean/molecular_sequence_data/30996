We have previously reported that novel beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m) is a metabolite derived from beta 2m in ultrafiltrate of patients on long-term hemodialysis (LT-HD). Chromatofocusing showed the presence of at least two major novel beta 2m's with isoelectric points of 5.38 and 5.22. In the present study we purified one of major novel beta 2m's and determined the complete amino acid sequence. We demonstrate herein that the novel beta 2m has the same sequence as native beta 2m except for the 17th residue from the N-terminus which was identified as Asp instead of Asn in native beta 2m, suggesting a possible deamidation during LT-HD.
