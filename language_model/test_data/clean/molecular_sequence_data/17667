The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the precursor to the major merozoite surface antigens of Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi strain IP-PC1 has been determined. A single open reading frame was detected, that coded for a protein of 199 kDa. The encoded protein (p199) contains putative signal and membrane anchor sequences and shows a clustering of Cys residues in the last 120 amino acids. Incompletely conserved tandem repeat oligopeptides are present at different positions in the molecule. P199 shows 69% overall homology to the analogous antigen in Plasmodium yoelii yoelii strain YM. The divergence between these antigens is largely confined to 4 areas where a number of insertions and/or deletions have occurred. All repeats occur in these divergent regions. The overall homology with both alleles of Plasmodium falciparum PMMSA is 33%.
