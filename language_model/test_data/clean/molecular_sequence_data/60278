The molecular basis of exocytotic membrane fusion in the pancreatic acinar cell was investigated using an in vitro assay that measures both zymogen granule-plasma membrane fusion and granule-granule fusion. These two fusion events were differentially sensitive to Ca(2+), suggesting that they are controlled by different Ca(2+)-sensing mechanisms. Botulinum neurotoxin C (BoNT/C) treatment of the plasma membranes caused cleavage of syntaxin 2, the apical isoform of this Q-SNARE, but did not affect syntaxin 4, the basolateral isoform. BoNT/C also cleaved syntaxin 3, the zymogen granule isoform. BoNT/C treatment of plasma membranes abolished granule-plasma membrane fusion, whereas toxin treatment of the granules reduced granule-plasma membrane fusion and abolished granule-granule fusion. Tetanus toxin cleaved granule-associated synaptobrevin 2 but caused only a small reduction in both granule-plasma membrane fusion and granule-granule fusion. Our results indicate that syntaxin 2 is the isoform that mediates fusion between zymogen granules and the apical plasma membrane of the acinar cell. Syntaxin 3 mediates granule-granule fusion, which might be involved in compound exocytosis. In contrast, the major R-SNARE on the zymogen granule remains to be identified.
