A Theileria annulata protein (TaD) exhibiting an N-terminal signal sequence for endoplasmic reticulum membrane translocation and a conserved cysteine-rich region was isolated by screening the mRNA of a T. annulata-infected bovine lymphoblastoid cell line with degenerated primers directed against T. annulata-targeting sequences. The TaD-coding sequence was found to be most closely related to the genomic DNA sequence of T. parva (TIGR database, 72%) and the amino acid sequence of Plasmodium falciparum (41%), P. yoelii yoelii (38%) and Cryptosporidium parvum (36%). The TaD mRNA is expressed within the sporozoite, schizont and merozoite stages of the parasite, implying that it is constitutively transcribed throughout the parasite's life cycle. Allelic variants were found between isolates originating from different geographical regions, however not affecting conserved cysteines. The open reading frame encoded a protein of 19.5 kDa and non-reducing SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated a homodimeric protein. Using confocal microscopy, the protein was found to be both located in the parasite cytoplasm and to colocalize with a transmembrane protein of the schizonts within infected cells.
