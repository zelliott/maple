A 2.4-kb EcoRI fragment including the replication and origin of transfer regions of the Klebsiella pneumoniae multiresistance plasmid pJHCMW1 has been cloned and sequenced. The isolated replication region was sufficient for stable maintenance of the plasmid and shares homology with RNA-regulated replicons. Homology was highest with the replication region of the plasmid p15A. Incompatibility experiments, however, determined that pJHCMW1 is compatible with pACYC177, a plasmid harboring the p15A replicon. Differences in their RNA I nucleotide sequences may account for their compatibility. A mobilization origin was also found in the 2.4-kb EcoRI pJHCMW1 DNA fragment analyzed. Conjugation experiments showed that although non-self-transmissible, the recombinant clone including the 2.4-kb EcoRI pJHCMW1 fragment could be mobilized in the presence of the helper plasmid pRK2073.
