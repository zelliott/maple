The significance of the maternal humoral immune response in relation to vertical transmission of HIV-1 was investigated in 123 mothers infected with subtype E from Thailand. Antibody binding titers to HIV-1 env domains (monomeric gp120, the CD4/gp120 binding site [BS], V3 loop, and gp41) and antibody-mediated neutralization of primary and T-cell line-adapted (TCLA) subtypes B and E HIV-1 isolates were investigated. No correlation between maternal anti HIV-1 antibodies at delivery and vertical transmission of HIV-1 subtype E was found. However, a trend to higher titer antibody-mediated cross-neutralization of a heterologous subtype B TCLA isolate, HIV-1MN, was observed in nontransmitting mothers postpartum. The HIV-1-specific antibody titers in these infected mothers increased significantly from delivery to 6 months postpartum (p < .05), but this was only partially attributable to hemodilution and an additional factor or factors appear to affect humoral immunity to HIV-1 during late pregnancy.
