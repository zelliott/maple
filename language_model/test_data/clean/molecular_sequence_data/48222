A series of indolequinones including derivatives of EO9 bearing various functional groups and related indole-2-carboxamides have been studied with a view to identifying molecular features which confer substrate specificity for purified human NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (DT-diaphorase), bioreductive activation to DNA-damaging species, and selectivity for DT-diaphorase-rich cells in vitro. A broad spectrum of substrate specificity exists, but minor changes to the indolequinone nucleus have a significant effect upon substrate specificity. Modifications at the 2-position are favorable in terms of substrate specificity as these positions are located at the binding site entrance as determined by molecular modeling studies. In contrast, substitutions at the (indol-3-yl)methyl position with bulky leaving groups or a group containing a chlorine atom result in compounds which are poor substrates, some of which inactivate DT-diaphorase. Modeling studies demonstrate that these groups sit close to the mechanistically important amino acids Tyr 156 and His 162 possibly resulting in either alkylation within the active site or disruption of charge-relay mechanisms. An aziridinyl group at the 5-position is essential for potency and selectivity to DT-diaphorase-rich cells under aerobic conditions. The most efficient substrates induced qualitatively greater single-strand DNA breaks in cell-free assays via a redox mechanism involving the production of hydrogen peroxide (catalase inhibitable). This damage is unlikely to form a major part of their mechanism of action in cells since potency does not correlate with extent of DNA damage. In terms of hypoxia selectivity, modifications at the 3-position generate compounds which are poor substrates for DT-diaphorase but have high hypoxic cytotoxicity ratios.
