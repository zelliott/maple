The nucleotide (nt) sequence of an Ustilago maydis (Um) gene that complemented a partially osmotic-remedial temperature-sensitive (or-ts) mutant defective in apical extension growth has been determined. It contained a continuous open reading frame (OFR) predicted to encode a protein of 853 amino acids (aa). The deduced aa sequence was homologous to gamma-adaptin, a component of clathrin-coated vesicles derived from the Golgi.
