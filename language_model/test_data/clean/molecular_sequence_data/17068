Four novel bioactive peptides were isolated from the red-bellied newt, Cynops pyrrhogaster, using a bioassay system monitoring the rectum contraction of the Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica. As these peptides are structurally related to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), we termed these peptides newt VIP-related peptides 1, 2, 3, and 4 (NVRP-1, -2, -3, and -4). The primary sequences of these peptides were determined to be HSDAVFTDNYSRLLGKTALKNYLDGALKKE (NVRP-1), HSDAVFTDNYSRLLAKTALKNYLDGALKKE (NVRP-2), HSDAVFT-DNYSRLLGKIALKNYLDEALKKE (NVRP-3), and HSDAVFTDNYSRLLGKT-ALKNYLDSALKKE (NVRP-4). The N-terminal regions of these NVRPs possessed homology at the amino-acid level to various VIP, while the NVRP C-termini differed from VIPs significantly. All of the VIP consist of 28 amino-acid residues with amidated forms at the C-termini, whereas NVRPs possess 30 amino-acid residues and have free forms at the C-termini. NVRPs exert relaxant activities on isolated quail rectums in a dose-dependent manner, with threshold concentrations between 1 x 10(-8) and 3 x 10(-8) M. NVRPs also exhibited potent relaxant activities acting on the newt duodenum at 3 x 10(-8) M. As yet, this is the first isolation of biologically active VIP-related peptides from urodele.
