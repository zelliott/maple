Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is a common neurological disorder that results in short uncontrolled muscle contractions and sometimes more severe seizures. Genetic studies have suggested that JME may be caused by mutations in EFHC1. The Efhc1 protein consists of three DM10 domains and a C-terminal region containing a potential Ca2+ -binding motif. In Chlamydomonas, a protein (Rib72) of almost identical domain structure is a component of the protofilament ribbons within the doublet microtubules of the flagellar axoneme. Here I discuss recent work that supports assignment of human Efhc1 as a ciliary component and the resulting implications for the mechanism of disease causation.
