Paracoccidioides brasiliensis genome has been reported as having a size of about 30 Mb. By digestion of genomic DNA from strain IVICPb 73 (ATCC 32071), we have constructed a DNA library with an insert size average of 8 kb in Escherichia coli XL1 Blue. We have fully sequenced 7 clones comprising 51,022 bp which represent 20 putative protein-coding sequences (seven of them, partial) and one tRNA. The 20 coding sequences cover 46% of the total 51,022 bp with introns present in 10 out of the 20 sequences. Database similarity analysis reveals the presence of genes conserved in other fungal species and higher organisms, including humans.
