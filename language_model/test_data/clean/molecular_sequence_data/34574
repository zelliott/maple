'Lindström' wheat (AABBDD+rye B chromosomes) was used to study the effects of alien chromatin introgressed into a wheat genetic background, subjecting the wheat genome to a new and transient allopolyploidisation episode. Using this experimental material, we have previously demonstrated that no large-scale chromosomal translocations occurred as a result of the genomic constitution of the addition line. However, we have shown that the presence of a number of rye B chromosomes is associated with changes in the interphase organization and expression patterns of wheat rDNA loci. We have now extended our studies to focus on a further characterization of 'Lindström' 5S rDNA loci and also on high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) patterns. In the process, we have uncovered an unusually large variant of the 5S rDNA locus on wheat chromosome 1B (not to be confused with rye B chromosomes) and 2 novel HMW glutenin y-type alleles. These changes are not directly related to variation in rye B chromosome number in the present material, but the fact that a new, and still segregating, 1Dy HMW-GS gene was identified indicates a recent timescale for its origin. Strikingly, the 'Lindström' 5S rDNA 1B locus integrates a unit sharing 94% homology with a rye 5S rDNA sequence, suggesting the possibility that the wheat locus was colonized by highly homologous rye sequences during the breeding of 'Lindström', when the rye and wheat genomes were together, albeit briefly, in the same nucleus.
