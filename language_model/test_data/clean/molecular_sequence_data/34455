Giardia is the most common enteric protozoan that can be pathogenic to both humans and animals. Transmission can be direct through the faecal-oral route, or through ingestion of contaminated water or food. Genetic characterization of Giardia duodenalis isolates has demonstrated the existence of seven groups (assemblages A to G) which differ in their host distribution. Assemblages A and B are present in humans and other primates, dogs, cats, rodents, and other species of wild mammals, but the role of the different host animals in the epidemiology of human infection remains unclear. With this preliminary data, we can infer that nonhuman primates (NHP) might be a potential reservoir for zoonotic transmission. This research paper discusses the presence of Giardia in nonhuman primates housed in two Spanish zoological gardens (located in Valencia and Madrid). Twenty faecal samples obtained from 16 different species of NHP were studied; 70% were positives to Giardia, and genetic analyses were performed by sequencing of four genes (SSrRNA, glutamate dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, and beta-giardin). The assemblage A was the most frequent (63.4%) in the species studied. A sequence from a red ruffed lemur (corresponding to genotype AI) was obtained, and this is the first reported sequence of a gdh gene obtained from this species. The multi-locus sequence analysis was also performed on the samples positive to nested PCR belonging to assemblage B. After amplification using the GDHeF, GDHiF, and GDHiR gdh primers; AL3543, AL3546, AL3544, and AL3545 tpi primers; G7, G759, GBF, and GBR bg primers, amplicons of 432, 500, and 511Â bp respectively were obtained. Amplification products were sequenced and the sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that genotype IV like was the most frequent in the samples belonging to this assemblage.
