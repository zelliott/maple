T cell activation is initiated by recognition of antigenic peptide presented in complex with MHC molecules on the surface of APCs. The mechanism by which this recognition occurs is still unclear, and many models exist in the literature. CD4 T cells have been shown to respond to soluble oligomers of activating class II MHC-peptide complexes, but not to soluble monomers. In determining the reactivity of CD8 T cells to soluble activating class I MHC-peptide complexes, a complicating phenomenon had been observed whereby peptide from soluble complexes was loaded onto cell surface MHCs on the T cells and re-presented to other T cells, clouding the true valency requirement for activation. This study uses soluble allogeneic class I MHC-peptide monomers and oligomers to stimulate murine CD8 T cells without the possible complication of peptide re-presentation. The results show that MHC class I monomers bind to, but do not activate, CD8 T cells whether the cells are in solution or adhered to a surface. Monomeric MHC class I binding can antagonize the stimulation triggered by soluble oligomers, a phenomenon also observed for CD4 T cells. Dimeric engagement is necessary and sufficient to stimulate downstream activation processes including TCR down-regulation, Zap70 phosphorylation, and CD25 and CD69 up-regulation, even in T cells that do not express the MHC coreceptor CD8. Thus, the valency dependence of the response of CD8 T cells to soluble MHC-peptide reagents is the same as previously observed for CD4 T cells.
