A novel thermophilic, hydrogen-oxidizing bacterium, designated strain CP.B2(T), was isolated from a terrestrial hot spring in Waiotapu, New Zealand. Cells were motile, slightly rod-shaped, non-spore-forming and Gram-negative. Isolate CP.B2(T) was an obligate chemolithotroph, growing by utilizing H(2) as electron donor and O(2) as corresponding electron acceptor. Elemental sulfur (S(0)) or thiosulfate ( ) was essential for growth. Microbial growth occurred under microaerophilic conditions in 1.0-10.0 % (v/v) O(2) [optimum 4-8 % (v/v) O(2)], between 45 and 75 degrees C (optimum 70 degrees C) and at pH values of 4.8-5.8 (optimum pH 5.4). The DNA G+C content was 29.3 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis demonstrated that strain CP.B2(T) belonged to the order Aquificales, with a close phylogenetic relationship to Sulfurihydrogenibium azorense (94 % sequence similarity to the type strain). However, genotypic and metabolic characteristics differentiated the novel isolate from previously described genera of the Aquificales. Therefore, CP.B2(T) represents a novel species in a new genus, for which the name Venenivibrio stagnispumantis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Venenivibrio stagnispumantis is CP.B2(T) (=JCM 14244(T) =DSM 18763(T)).
