As reported previously [Parsonage, D., Luba, J., Mallett, T. C., and Claiborne, A. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 23812-23822], the flavoprotein alpha-glycerophosphate oxidases (GlpOs) from a number of enterococcal and streptococcal sources contain a conserved 50-52 residue insert that is completely absent in the homologous alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenases. On limited proteolysis with trypsin, the GlpO from Streptococcus sp. (m = 67.6 kDa) is readily converted to two major fragments corresponding to masses of approximately 40 and 23 kDa. The combined application of sequence and mass spectrometric analyses demonstrates that the 40-kDa fragment represents the N-terminus of intact GlpO (Met1-Lys368; 40.5 kDa), while the 23-kDa band represents a C-terminal fragment (Ala405-Lys607; 22.9 kDa). Hence, limited proteolysis in effect excises most of the GlpO insert (Ser355-Lys404), indicating that this represents a flexible region on the protein surface. The active-site and other spectroscopic properties of the enzyme, including both flavin and tryptophan fluorescence spectra, titration behavior with both dithionite and sulfite, and preferential binding of the anionic form of the oxidized flavin, were largely unaffected by proteolysis. Enzyme-monitored turnover analyses of the intact and nicked streptococcal GlpOs (at [GlpO] approximately 10 microM) demonstrate that the single major catalytic defect in the nicked enzyme corresponds to a 20-fold increase in K(m)(Glp); the basis for this altered kinetic behavior is derived from an 8-fold decrease in the second-order rate constant for reduction of the nicked enzyme, as measured in anaerobic stopped-flow experiments. These results indicate that the flexible surface region represented by elements of the GlpO insert plays an important role in mediating efficient flavin reduction.
