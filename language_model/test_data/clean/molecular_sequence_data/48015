A proteinase inhibitor (designated as TMI) was isolated and purified from the snake serum of Taiwan habu (Trimeresurus mucrosquamatus) by using successive chromatographies which included Sephadex G-100, DEAE-Sephacel chromatographies, and C(4) reverse-phase HPLC. The purified inhibitor was shown to be a homogeneous protein with a molecular mass of about 47 or 36 kDa in the presence or absence of a reducing agent, beta-mercaptoethanol. The inhibitor decreases in molecular mass by about 23% with N-linked neuraminidase treatment, suggesting that it is a glycoprotein. Further enzymatic analyses indicated that this inhibitor possesses strong inhibitory activities toward three zinc-dependent metalloproteinases and not fibrinogenolytic serine proteases previously isolated from the venom of the same snake species with an IC(50) of about 0.2-1.1 microM. Its IC(50) value was approximately three orders of magnitude more effective than those of the tripeptide inhibitors we previously purified from the crude venom of the same snake (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 248, 562-568 (1998)). The purified inhibitor showed stronger inhibitory action against caseinolytic activities of crude venoms from closely related species of Taiwan habu than those from unrelated species. N-terminal sequence analysis showed that its sequence is distinctly different from sequences of those serum inhibitors reported for other snake species in the literature. Based on inhibition susceptibility and primary structures of various snake protease inhibitors, it is suggested that this novel inhibitor isolated from the serum of Taiwan habu may be a unique self-defense protein factor mainly for protection against envenomation from snakes of the same genus.
