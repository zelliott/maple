We cloned a new polyketide gene cluster, aur2, in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM3239. Sequence analysis of the 9531-bp DNA fragment revealed 10 open reading frames, majority of which showed high similarity to the previously characterized type II polyketide synthase (PKS) genes. An unusual feature of the aur2 cluster is a disconnected organization of minimal PKS genes; ACP is located apart from the genes for ketosynthases KSalpha and KSbeta. The aur2 gene cluster was disrupted in S. aureofaciens CCM3239 by a homologous recombination, replacing the four genes (aur2A, E, F, G) including ketosynthase KSalpha, with antibiotic resistance marker gene. The disruption did not affect growth and differentiation, and disrupted strain produced spores with wild-type grey-pink pigmentation. The biochromatographic analysis of the culture extracts from S. aureofaciens wild type and aur2-disrupted strains did not reveal any difference in the pattern of antibacterial compounds.
