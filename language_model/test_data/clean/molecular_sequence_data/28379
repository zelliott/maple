A wobbled 14-mer oligonucleotide was derived from the amino acid sequence of the 34-residue propeptide of the lantibiotic Pep5 (Kellner et al. 1989). Using this hybridization probe, the structural gene of Pep5, pepA, was located on the 18.6 kbp plasmid pED503. The nucleotide sequence of pepA codes for a prepeptide with 60 residues and proves that Pep5 is ribosomally synthesized. The N-terminus of the prepeptide has a high alpha-helix probability and a characteristic proteolytic cleavage site precedes the C-terminal 34-residue propeptide. Our present theory is that maturation of Pep5 involves (a) enzymic conversion of Thr, Ser and Cys into dehydrated amino acids and sulfide bridges, (b) membrane translocation and cleavage of the modified prepeptide.
