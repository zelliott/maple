Although gamma delta T lymphocytes were identified several years ago, the functional importance of these cells remains to be established. gamma delta T cells of ruminants are unique in two respects. First, they are present at much higher levels compared to man and rodents. Second, ruminant CD4-CD8- gamma delta T cells uniquely express a 220 kD surface Ag recognized by a panel of mAb, recently clustered as WC1. WC1 has been most extensively studied in sheep with the use of the mAb T19. Here, we report on the isolation of a full length cDNA clone, encoding the WC1 Ag, from a COS cell cDNA expression library prepared from a bovine gamma delta T cell line. The protein encoded by the pWC1 cDNA clone was reactive with the bovine mAb CC15 and IL.A29, and with T19. The cDNA clone consisted of 4475 bp and contained a single long open reading frame of 1436 amino acids. The pWC1 cDNA clone encoded a type 1 integral membrane protein with an extracellular domain consisting of 11 scavenger receptor cysteine-rich-repeats with homology to CD5 and CD6. Southern blotting suggested that the bovine genome contained multiple sequences highly related to the isolated WC1 cDNA. Furthermore, WC1-like sequences were present in the genomes of all mammals tested including mouse and man. The molecular characterization of the WC1 Ag as reported here provides a starting point for the definition of its role in gamma delta T cell biology.
