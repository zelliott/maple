A stage-specific expressed gene has been isolated from a cDNA expression library of Echinococcus granulosus protoscolices. The isolated clone contains the complete coding sequence. The corresponding protein (EgDf1) has a molecular weight of 15.5 kDa and is expressed at the tegumental level in the protoscolices, being undetectable in the germinal layer of the metacestode. This protein shares an important homology with a family of low-molecular weight proteins involved in the binding of hydrophobic ligands. This family includes a protein of Schistosoma mansoni (Sm 14) that has immunoprotective activity in rodents. Histochemical and metabolic data already reported for E. granulosus suggest that EgDf1 could be a molecular marker for early events in the process of protoscolex differentiation.
