The nucleotide sequence was determined for the fusion (F) protein-coding mRNA of the bovine respiratory syncytial virus (strain RB 94) and the amino acid sequence of the F protein was deduced for comparison with the sequence of human respiratory syncytial virus subtypes A and B (RSS-2 and 18537 strains). The human and bovine RS virus F proteins (excluding the cleaved signal peptide) share 83 to 84% homology. The greatest divergence occurred within the F2 subunit in the region preceding the cleavage activation site.
