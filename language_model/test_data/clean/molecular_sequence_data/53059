Exposure of isolated retinas to 30 microM D-aspartate, which is a substrate for all high affinity glutamate transporters, for 30 min, resulted in the accumulation of such D-aspartate into Müller glial cells but not glutamatergic neurons as evinced by immunocytochemistry for D-aspartate. Further incubation of such loaded retinas in physiological media, in the absence of D-aspartate, resulted in the slow release of accumulated D-aspartate from the Müller cells and its accumulation into populations of photoreceptors and bipolar cells. This result indicates that after initial transport into Müller cells, reversal of direction of transport of D-aspartate, and thus by inference glutamate, by GLAST, readily occurs. D-aspartate released by Müller cells was strongly accumulated into cone photoreceptors which are known to express GLT-1, and into rod photoreceptors which we demonstrate here to express the retina specific glutamate transporter EAAT5 (excitatory amino transporter 5). Populations of glutamatergic bipolar cells, which express GLT-1 also exhibited avid uptake of D-aspartate. We conclude that the Müller cell glutamate transporter GLAST is responsible for most of the initial glutamate clearance in the retina after its release from neurones. However, some glutamate is also returned from Müller cells, to neurons expressing GLT-1 and EAAT5, albeit at a slow rate. These data suggest that the role of neuronal glutamate transporters in the retina may be to facilitate a slow process of recycling glutamate back from Müller cells to neurons after its initial clearance from perisynaptic regions by GLAST.
