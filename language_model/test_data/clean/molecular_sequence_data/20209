Kunitz proteinase inhibitors in legumes have mainly been described as defence and storage proteins. Here, we report a Kunitz trypsin inhibitor, encoded by the CaTPI-1 gene from Cicer arietinum. The transcription of this gene mainly occurs in seedling vegetative organs, and is affected by the light and growth stages. The recombinant TPI-1 protein expressed in E. coli was seen to be an efficient inhibitor of trypsin. After the generation of polyclonal antibodies against recombinant TPI-1 protein, the protein was located in the cell wall of elongating epicotyls and radicles by Western-blot experiments, in agreement with the transcription pattern. These results, together with the fact that both CaTPI-1 mRNA and protein levels decreased with epicotyl growth, suggest a possible role in the elongation of seedling epicotyls and radicles. Immunolocalization analyses of the TPI-1 protein indicated that it is abundant in the cell walls of both immature primary xylem cells and surrounding parenchyma cells. This location has led us to explore potential functions for TPI-1 protein in vascular tissue during seedling elongation.
