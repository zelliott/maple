The complete nucleotide sequence of cDNA clones representing the L2 dsRNA from Japan isolate of epizootic hemorrhagic disease serotype 2 (EHDV-2JPN) was determined. The EHDV-2JPN L2 gene is 3002 base pairs long with a single open reading frame of 2949 bp which predicts a polypeptide of 982 amino acid residues. Comparison of VP2 sequence between Japan and North American Isolates of EHDV-2 showed a 72% homology in spite of the same serotype, although those among the North American isolates showed a high genetic identity (>97%).
