Aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) synthetase (PurM) catalyzes the conversion of formylglycinamide ribonucleotide (FGAM) and ATP to AIR, ADP, and P(i), the fifth step in de novo purine biosynthesis. The ATP binding domain of the E. coli enzyme has been investigated using the affinity label [(14)C]-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine (FSBA). This compound results in time-dependent inactivation of the enzyme which is accelerated by the presence of FGAM, and gives a K(i) = 25 microM and a k(inact) = 5.6 x 10(-)(2) min(-)(1). The inactivation is inhibited by ADP and is stoichiometric with respect to AIR synthetase. After trypsin digestion of the labeled enzyme, a single labeled peptide has been isolated, I-X-G-V-V-K, where X is Lys27 modified by FSBA. Site-directed mutants of AIR synthetase were prepared in which this Lys27 was replaced with a Gln, a Leu, and an Arg and the kinetic parameters of the mutant proteins were measured. All three mutants gave k(cat)s similar to the wild-type enzyme and K(m)s for ATP less than that determined for the wild-type enzyme. Efforts to inactivate the chicken liver trifunctional AIR synthetase with FSBA were unsuccessful, despite the presence of a Lys27 equivalent. The role of Lys27 in ATP binding appears to be associated with the methylene linker rather than its epsilon-amino group. The specific labeling of the active site by FSBA has helped to define the active site in the recently determined structure of AIR synthetase [Li, C., Kappock, T. J., Stubbe, J., Weaver, T. M., and Ealick, S. E. (1999) Structure (in press)], and suggests additional flexibility in the ATP binding region.
