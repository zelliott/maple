Cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase (CA4H) is the second enzyme involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and is a member of the cytochrome P-450 superfamily. Three CA4H homologous genes, cyp73A, cyp73b, and cyp73c, and a cDNA clone of cyp73a were isolated from a genomic library and a cDNA library of a hybrid aspen; Populus kitakamiensis, and were characterized. They might be interrupted by two introns each. cyp73a and cyp73b were very similar to each other not only in coding regions but also in non-coding regions. Southern blot analysis showed that four homologous genes for CA4H constructed a small gene family in the diploid genome of P. kitakamiensis. In the promoter regions, there were many common cis-element-like sequences in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis genes.
