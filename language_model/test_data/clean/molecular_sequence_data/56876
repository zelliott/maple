We isolated a fission yeast putative protein serine/threonine phosphatase gene designated ppe1+ by hybridization. The predicted amino acid sequence is similar to those of the fission yeast ppa2 (53% identity) and dis2 (39%) phosphatases, and highly similar to those of the budding yeast SIT4 (72%), Drosophila PPV (68%) and rabbit PPX (61%) phosphatases. Antibodies against ppe1 protein identified a 37-kd polypeptide in fission yeast. A gene disruption (designated delta ppe1) caused cold-sensitive lethality and short, pear-shaped cells. These phenotypes were fully suppressed by a plasmid carrying ppe1+. Three classes of multicopy suppressor genes for delta ppe1 were identified as follows: 1) ppa1+ and ppa2+ encoding type 2A-like phosphatases, 2) mitotically essential dis3+ similar to the budding yeast SSD1/SRK1, a suppressor for sit4, and 3) pck1+ coding for a protein kinase C-like kinase. Consistently, the budding yeast SIT4 gene was also a multicopy suppressor for delta ppe1. Phosphatase ppe1 may play a role in cell morphogenesis and mitosis by either regulating or being regulated by these multicopy suppressor gene products. Consistent with this hypothesis, double mutants ppe1-ppa2 and ppe1-pck1 are lethal at the permissive temperature.
