Sucrose non-fermenting 1 (SNF1) protein kinase complex is a heterotrimer that functions in energy homeostasis in eukaryotes by regulating transcription of glucose-repressible genes. Our previous study revealed that SNF1 of the homothallic ascomycete fungus Fusarium graminearum plays important roles in vegetative growth, sexual development, and virulence. In this study, we further identified the components of the SNF1 complex in F. graminearum and characterized their functions. We found that the SNF1 complex in F. graminearum consists of one alpha subunit (FgSNF1), one beta subunit (FgGAL83), and one gamma subunit (FgSNF4). Deletion of Fggal83 and Fgsnf4 resulted in alleviated phenotype changes in vegetative growth and sexual development as compared to those of the Fgsnf1 deletion mutant. However, all of the single, double, and triple deletion mutants among Fgsnf1, Fggal83, and Fgsnf4 had similar levels of decreased virulence. In addition, there was no synergistic effect of the mutant (single, double, or triple deletions of SNF1 complex component genes) phenotypes except for sucrose utilization. In this study, we revealed that FgSNF1 is mainly required for SNF1 complex functions, and the other two SNF1 complex components have adjunctive roles with FgSNF1 in sexual development and vegetative growth but have a major role in virulence in F. graminearum.
