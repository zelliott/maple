A new polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method employing type-specific primers and probes was applied to 114 clinical specimens obtained from 58 female patients with genital lesions or who had a history of genital herpes. Ten and 15 specimens, respectively, were positive for herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and HSV-2 by cell culture. All of 10 culture-confirmed HSV-1 cases and 11 of 15 (73%) culture-confirmed HSV-2 cases were identified by PCR. Although there were several cases with discrepancy between cell culture and PCR for HSV-2, the results suggest that this PCR procedure could be applied to clinical specimens from the female genital tract.
