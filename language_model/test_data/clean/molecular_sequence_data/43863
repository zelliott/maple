Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we cloned and sequenced full-length mouse cDNAs for the two homologous subunits of the proteasome activator PA28 (PA28alpha and PA28beta), as well as for the related protein Ki. These proteins are highly conserved among species. Northern blot analysis of PA28a, PA28b, and Ki mRNA demonstrated broad tissue distribution. Although single transcripts were detected for PA28a and PA28b, two different sized transcripts were detected for mouse Ki, suggesting either alternative splicing or alternate polyadenylation sites. The levels of these transcripts increased in response to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) treatment in mouse H6 hepatoma cells, although PA28a and PA28b were induced to a greater extent than Ki, and the effect of IFN-gamma stimulation on Ki expression was transient. Southern blot analysis suggests that both PA28a and PA28b are multiple-copy genes, while Ki is a single-copy gene.
