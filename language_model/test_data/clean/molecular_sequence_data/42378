A simple rapid fluorescent method for the detection of plasminogen activator activity of urokinase type (u-PA) in the tear fluid is described. Small filter paper punches were soaked in the substrate solution (Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-trifluoromethylcoumarinyl-7-amide, 1 mg/1 ml) and aprotinin 100 micrograms/1 ml) dissolved in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2 and dried. The dried punches were soaked with tears (by direct contact of the punch with the site where the activity should be assessed or by dropping of 3-5 microliters of tears collected by a glass micropipette). The punches were incubated in a thermostat (37 degrees C) together with punches containing a known u-PA activity (calibrated punches) in preheated (37 degrees C) Petri dishes. In 1 min intervals (during the first 15 min) and in 5 min intervals thereafter the probes were exposed to UV light, and the time of the first appearance of a bright yellow fluorescence was recorded. In punches containing 5 IU u-PA activity fluorescence appeared after 2 min incubation; 2.5 IU were detected after 5 min, 1.25 IU after 15 min, 0.625 IU after 30 min, 0.313 IU after 60 min, 0.156 IU after 90 min, and 0.078 IU after 120 min incubation. This simple method is recommended for use particularly in clinical laboratories. It enables e.g. to obtain a rather quick information about the urokinase activity in the tear fluid and to start the treatment with an appropriate inhibitor, if necessary.
