Ammonia oxidization is the first and a rate-limiting step of nitrification, which is often a critical process in nitrogen removal from estuarine and coastal environments. To clarify the correlation of environmental conditions with the distribution of ammonia oxidizers in organic matter-rich coastal sediments, ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) ammonia monooxygenase alpha subunit gene (amoA) abundance was determined in sediments of Matsushima Bay located in northeast Japan. The AOA and AOB amoA copy numbers ranged from 1.1×10(6) to 1.7×10(7) and from 7.1×10(5) to 7.6×10(6) copies g(-1) sediment, respectively. AOA and AOB amoA abundance was negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen levels in the bottom water. AOA amoA abundance was also correlated with total phosphorus levels in the sediments. On the other hand, no significant relationship was observed between the amoA abundance and ammonium, organic matter (ignition loss), or acid volatile sulfide-sulfur levels in the sediments. These results show the heterogeneous distribution of ammonia oxidizers by the difference in environmental conditions within the bay. Moreover, AOA amoA diversity was relatively low in the area of high AOA amoA abundance, suggesting the variability of AOA community composition.
