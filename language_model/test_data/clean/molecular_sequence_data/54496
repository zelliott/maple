Recent identification of the modular CLS motifs responsible for cyclins A and E localization on centrosomes has revealed a tight linkage between the nuclear and centrosomal cycles. These G1/S cyclins must localize on the centrosome in order for DNA replication to occur in the nucleus, whereas essential DNA replication factors also function on the centrosome to prevent centrosome overduplication. Both events are dependent on the presence of an intact CLS within each cyclin. Here we compare the cyclins A and E CLSs at the structural and functional levels and identify a new cyclin A CLS mutant that disrupts all CLS functions and reduces the affinity of cyclin A for Cdk2. Analysis of interactions of the CLS motif within the cyclin molecules highlights the importance of the cyclin CBOX1 region for Cdk2 binding.
