The in vivo metabolism of the newly identified endogenous ligand for the ORL1 receptor, the opioid-like peptide nociceptin (orphanin FQ) in rat hippocampus was studied using size-exclusion chromatography linked to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The results show that nociceptin is metabolized step-wise in vivo into fragments (1-13) and (14-17) as well as (1-9) and (10-13), respectively. Interestingly, the (1-13) and (1-9) fragments have the same C-terminus, Arg-Ala-Lys, suggesting that this is a motif recognized by an enzyme which fragments the peptide in two consecutive steps. Injection of the (1-13) fragment into rat hippocampus had no effect on spatial learning or motor function under conditions where nociceptin is active, showing that this metabolic conversion reduces affinity for the ORL-1-receptor.
