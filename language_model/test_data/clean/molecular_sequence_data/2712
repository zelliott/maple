Nucleotide differences in the histone H3 gene family in Drosophila melanogaster were studied on three levels: (1) within a chromosome, (2) within a population and (3) between species (D. melanogaster and Drosophila simulans). The average difference within the H3 gene within a chromosome was 0.0040 per nucleotide site, about 52% of that within a population (0.0077). The proportion of divergent sites between the two species was 0.0575, which is about 8.5 times the difference within a species. The distribution of divergence between species was similar to that of variation within a species. Divergence and variation were noted to be greatest in the 3' noncoding region and least in the coding region. Values intermediate between these were found for the 5' noncoding region. Divergence and variation in silent sites exceeded those in the total coding region, thus indicating possible purifying selection for amino-acid-altering change. Phylogenetic relations among H3 genes and genetic differences on these three levels are evidence for the concerted evolution of the histone gene family. The molecular mechanism by which variation is produced and maintained is discussed.
