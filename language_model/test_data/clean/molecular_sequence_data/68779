The retinoid X receptor alpha is one of a number of retinoic acid receptors which are members of the steroid/thyroid hormone superfamily. Localization of RXRA was achieved using the polymerase chain reaction on a panel of somatic cell hybrids. A cosmid clone was isolated using the RXRA PCR product, and this was used to further localize the gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization to chromosome 9q34 distal to the dopamine beta hydroxylase gene (DBH). This mapping position was confirmed by PCR on a panel of translocation hybrids.
