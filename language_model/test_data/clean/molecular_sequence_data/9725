To investigate the role of the carboxyl-terminal region (52 amino acids) of the monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 receptor (CCR2B) in chemotaxis, we created a series of mutants and expressed them in a murine pre-B lymphocyte cell line. Truncation of the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail to 20 amino acids had little or no effect on chemotaxis or signal transduction, but further truncation resulted in marked functional defects. Upon incubation with monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, CCR2B underwent rapid and extensive internalization, and this was impaired progressively as the carboxyl tail was truncated from 52 to 8 amino acids. Mutation of all of the serine and threonine residues in the carboxyl tail to alanine also resulted in markedly impaired receptor internalization but did not affect signaling or chemotaxis. We conclude that the membrane-proximal portion of the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail of CCR2B is critically involved in chemotaxis and signal transduction, but neither phosphorylation of carboxyl serines or threonines nor internalization of the receptor is required for robust chemotaxis.
