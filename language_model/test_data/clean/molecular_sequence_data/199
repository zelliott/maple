We previously identified a new bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) trans-activator factor of transcription (Tat236) that was derived from a variant of BIV. Here, we report a new BIV long terminal repeat (LTR) sequence (LTRn) that was obtained by PCR from the DNA of cells infected with the BIV variant mentioned above. Sequence analysis indicated that the LTRn U3 region harbors three nucleic acid mutations at residue positions -194, -135 and -114 when compared to the original (wild-type) LTR sequence. Reporter gene assays indicated that LTRn promotes basal and Tat-mediated transactivation activity to levels significantly higher than those obtained with the wild-type LTR. Restoration experiments to the wild-type genotype indicated that both the -135 and -114 nucleic acid substitutions were responsible for the enhanced promoter activity of BIV LTRn.
