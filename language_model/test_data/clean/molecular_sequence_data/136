The Golgi of the kinetoplastid parasite Trypanosoma brucei is closely apposed to a bilobe structure containing TbCentrin2 and TbCentrin4 in procyclic cells. However, both are additionally localized to the basal bodies. Here we report the characterization of a membrane occupation and recognition nexus (MORN)-repeat protein, TbMORN1, present at the bilobe but not at the basal body. The anterior part of the TbMORN1 structure partially overlapped with the flagellar attachment zone while the posterior part overlapped with the flagellar pocket. Depletion studies using RNAi showed that there was a modest growth inhibition in procyclic cells but lethality in bloodstream cells, showing that it is an essential protein in the bloodstream form of the organism. TbMORN1 appears to be a useful marker for the bilobe in T. brucei.
