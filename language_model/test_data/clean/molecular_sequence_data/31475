A Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, motile and rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated WT-RY4(T), was isolated from wood falls in the South Sea, South Korea, and its taxonomic position was investigated using a polyphasic approach. Strain WT-RY4(T) grew optimally at 25 °C, at pH 7.0-7.5 and in the absence of NaCl. A neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain WT-RY4(T) clustered with the type strain of Paraperlucidibaca baekdonensis with a bootstrap resampling value of 100 %. Strain WT-RY4(T) exhibited 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values of 98.8 % and 96.3 % to Paraperlucidibaca baekdonensis RL-2(T) and Perlucidibaca piscinae IMCC 1704(T), respectively and less than 91.5 % to the type strains of other species used in the phylogenetic analysis. The DNA G+C content of strain WT-RY4(T) was 52.4 mol% and the mean DNA-DNA relatedness value with Paraperlucidibaca baekdonensis RL-2(T) was 25 %. Strain WT-RY4(T) contained Q-11 as the predominant ubiquinone and summed feature 3 (C16 : 1ω7c and/or C16 : 1ω6c), C16 : 0 and C12 : 0 3-OH as the major fatty acids. Differential phenotypic properties, together with the phylogenetic and genetic distinctiveness, demonstrated that strain WT-RY4(T) was distinguishable from Paraperlucidibaca baekdonensis RL-2(T). On the basis of the data presented, strain WT-RY4(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Paraperlucidibaca, for which the name Paraperlucidibaca wandonensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is WT-RY4(T) ( = KCTC 32216(T) = CCUG 63419(T)). An emended description of the genus Paraperlucidibaca is also provided.
