Familial isolated GH deficiency type 1A (IGHD1A) results from deletion of both GH alleles. To facilitate detection of cases of IGHD1A, we have developed a rapid method that uses polymerase chain reaction amplification of small amounts of genomic DNA, digestion with a single restriction endonuclease, and visualization of DNA fragments after gel electrophoresis. Employing this method we have identified two subjects with IGHD1A among a cohort of seven Chinese subjects with severe growth retardation due to GHD.
