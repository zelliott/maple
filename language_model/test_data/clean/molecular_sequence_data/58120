Although the pathogenesis of psoriasis is still a matter of debate, there are several lines of evidence supporting the concept of this disease being immunologically mediated with T cells playing a crucial role. Because a considerable portion of the cellular infiltrate in psoriasis consists of activated T-helper cells, expression of HLA class II antigens might be of particular importance for the understanding of its pathogenesis. Therefore, we investigated the HLA type of patients with type I (early onset, positive family history) and type II (late onset, no family history) psoriasis by means of serology (n = 89) and genotyping using sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (n = 64). Serologic analysis of class I documented the association of type I psoriasis with HLA-Cw6, -B13, and -B57, whereas type II psoriasis showed a weaker correlation with HLA-Cw2 and -B27. Genotyping using SSO for class II detected the elevation of the HLA-DRB1*0701/2 allele frequency from 13% in normal population to 36% in type I, but only to 15% in type II psoriatics. Moreover, positive correlations with type I psoriasis were detected for HLA-DQA1*0201 and HLA-DQB1*0303. The HLA-DRB1*0701/2, -DQA1*0201, -DQB1*0303 extended haplotype was found exclusively in type I psoriasis. This is the first report documenting the association of distinct HLA class II alleles with type I psoriasis as detected on the DNA level, an approach both more specific and more sensitive when compared to serology.
