We analyzed the sequences required for promoter activity and high-light responsiveness of the psbDII gene in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 by using transcriptional fusions to a lacZ reporter gene. The basal promoter drives high constitutive expression, although no canonical -35 element is evident. The smallest fragment that showed clear light-responsive expression extends from -38 to +160, which includes 52 bp of the psbDII open reading frame. Sequences downstream from the promoter, within the untranslated leader region from +11 to +24, were required for high-light induction.
