Even though more than 200 three-dimensional structures of HIV-1 protease complexed to a variety of inhibitors are available in the Protein Data Bank; very few structures of unliganded protein have been determined. We have recently solved structures of unliganded HIV-1 protease tethered dimer mutants to resolutions of 1.9 A and 2.1 A, and have found that the flaps assume closed-flap conformation even in the absence of any bound ligand. We report comparison of the unliganded closed-flap structure with structures of HIV-1 protease inhibitor complexes with a view to accurately identifying structural changes that the ligand can induce on binding to HIV-1 protease in the crystal. These studies reveal that the least flexible region present in the active site of HIV-1 protease need not also be the least adaptable to external stress, thus highlighting the conceptual difference between flexibility and adaptability of proteins in general.
