The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family comprises to date 12 members, which are involved in various physiological processes throughout embryogenesis and adult life. Two novel members of the family have been identified recently (FGF11 and FGF12). Using in situ hybridization on metaphasic chromosomes, we have been able to assign FGF11 to band p12-p13 of human chromosome 17 and FGF12 to band q28 of human chromosome 3.
