A fungus with the ability to utilize a metalcyano compound, tetracyanonickelate (II) ¿K2[Ni (CN)4]; TCN¿, as its sole source of nitrogen was isolated from soil and identified as Fusarium oxysporum N-10. Both intact mycelia and cell-free extract of the strain catalyzed hydrolysis of TCN to formate and ammonia and produced formamide as an intermediate, thereby indicating that a hydratase and an amidase sequentially participated in the degradation of TCN. The enzyme catalyzing the hydration of TCN was purified approximately ten-fold from the cell-free extract of strain N-10 with a yield of 29%. The molecular mass of the active enzyme was estimated to be 160 kDa. The enzyme appears to exist as a homotetramer, each subunit having a molecular mass of 40 kDa. The enzyme also catalyzed the hydration of KCN, with a cyanide-hydrating activity 2 x 10(4) times greater than for TCN. The kinetic parameters for TCN and KCN indicated that hydratase isolated from F. oxysporum was a cyanide hydratase able to utilize a broad range of cyano compounds and nitriles as substrates.
