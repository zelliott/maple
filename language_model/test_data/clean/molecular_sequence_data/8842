A detailed analysis of structural and functional aspects of G-protein-coupled receptors, as well as discovery of novel pharmacophores that exert their effects on members of this class of receptors, will be facilitated by development of a yeast-based bioassay. To that end, yeast strains that functionally express the rat somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) were constructed. High-affinity binding sites for somatostatin ([125I-Tyr-11]S-14) comparable to those in native tissues were detected in yeast membrane extracts at levels equivalent to the alpha-mating pheromone receptor (Ste2p). Somatostatin-dependent growth of strains modified by deletion of genes encoding components of the pheromone response pathway was detected through induction of a pheromone-responsive HIS3 reporter gene, enabling cells to grow on medium lacking histidine. Dose-dependent growth responses to S-14 and related SSTR2 subtype-selective agonists that were proportional to the affinity of the ligands for SSTR2 were observed. The growth response required SSTR2, G alpha proteins, and an intact signal transduction pathway. The sensitivity of the bioassay was affected by intracellular levels of the G alpha protein. A mutation in the SST2 gene, which confers supersensitivity to pheromone, was found to significantly enhance the growth response to S-14. In sst2 delta cells, SSTR2 functionally interacted with both a chimeric yeast/mammalian G alpha protein and the yeast G alpha protein, Gpa1p; to promote growth. These yeast strains should serve as a useful in vivo reconstitution system for examination of molecular interactions of the G-protein-coupled receptors and G proteins.
