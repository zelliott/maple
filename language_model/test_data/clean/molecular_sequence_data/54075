Gene therapy applications of retroviral vectors derived from C-type retroviruses have been limited to introducing genes into dividing target cells. Here, we report genetically engineered C-type retroviral vectors derived from spleen necrosis virus (SNV), which are capable of infecting nondividing cells. This has been achieved by introducing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence into the matrix protein (MA) of SNV by site-directed mutagenesis. This increased the efficiency of infecting nondividing cells and was sufficient to endow the virus with the capability to efficiently infect growth-arrested human T lymphocytes and quiescent primary monocyte-derived macrophages. We demonstrate that this vector actively penetrates the nucleus of a target cell, and has potential use as a gene therapy vector to transfer genes into nondividing cells.
