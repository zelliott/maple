Opium and its derivatives are potent analgesics that also have many other pharmacological effects in the nervous system. These agents and the endogenous opioid peptides exert their effects by interacting with high-affinity receptors. Complementary DNAs encoding the delta, kappa and mu opioid receptors have been isolated and characterized. These receptors, which are members of the superfamily of seven-transmembrane spanning receptors, share a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity with approximately 50% of the residues being identical. The cloned opioid receptors mediate agonist inhibition of cyclic AMP formation and have pharmacological properties similar to the endogenous proteins. The cloning of these receptors will facilitate the development of new clinically useful compounds as well as studies of the molecular basis of tolerance and drug addiction.
