Superoxide dismutases are metalloenzymes involved in protecting cells from oxidative damage arising from superoxide radical or reactive oxygen species produced from superoxide. Examples of enzymes containing Cu, Mn, and Fe as the redox-active metal have been characterized. Recently, a SOD containing one Ni atom per subunit was reported. The amino acid sequence of the NiSOD deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the structural gene sodN from Streptomyces seoulensis is reported and has no homology with other SODs. X-ray absorption spectroscopic studies coupled with EPR of the Ni center show that the Ni in the oxidized (as isolated) enzyme is in a five-coordinate site composed of three S-donor ligands, one N-donor, and one other O- or N-donor. This unique coordination environment is modified by the loss of one N- (or O-) donor ligand in the dithionite-reduced enzyme. The NiSOD activity was determined by pulse radiolysis, and a value of kcat = 1.3 x 10(9) M-1 s-1 per Ni was obtained. The rate is pH sensitive and drops off rapidly above pH 8. The results characterize a novel class of metal center active in catalyzing the redox chemistry of superoxide and, when placed in context with other nickel enzymes, suggest that thiolate ligation is a prerequisite for redox-active nickel sites in metalloenzymes.
