An outer membrane protein from Moraxella catarrhalis with a mass of 74-kDa was isolated and evaluated as a vaccine candidate. The 74-kDa protein binds transferrin, and appears to be related to the other proteins from the organism that are reported to bind transferrin. The 74-kDa protein possessed conserved epitopes exposed on the bacterial surface. This is based on the reactivity with whole bacterial cells as well as complement dependent bactericidal activity of sera from mice immunized with the isolated proteins from the O35E and TTA24 isolates. However, there was divergence in the degree of antibody cross-reactivity with the protein from one strain to another. This serotypic divergence was reflected in both the complement-dependent bactericidal activities of the antibodies elicited in mice and the capacity of immune mice to clear the bacteria in a murine pulmonary model. Antibodies affinity purified from human plasma lacked bactericidal activity even though they were reactive with all the tested isolates. The 74-kDa protein appears to be a good vaccine candidate, but more studies are needed to understand its antigenic variability and whether antibodies toward it are protective.
