The gene encoding the epsilon subunit (atpE) of the chloroplast ATP synthase of Spinacia oleracea has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein can be solubilized in 8 M urea and directly diluted into buffer containing ethanol and glycerol to obtain epsilon that is as biologically active as epsilon purified from chloroplast-coupling factor 1 (CF1). Recombinant epsilon folded in this manner inhibits the ATPase activity of soluble and membrane-bound CF1 deficient in epsilon and restores proton impermeability to thylakoid membranes reconstituted with CF1 deficient in epsilon. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate truncations and single amino acid substitutions in the primary structure of epsilon. In the five mutants tested, alterations that weaken ATPase inhibition by recombinant epsilon affect its ability to restore proton impermeability to a similar extent, with one exception. Substitution of histidine-37 with arginine appears to uncouple ATPase inhibition and the restoration of proton impermeability. As in the case of E. coli, it appears that N-terminal truncations of the epsilon subunit have more profound effects than C-terminal deletions on the function of epsilon. Recombinant epsilon with six amino acids deleted from the C terminus, which is the only region of significant mismatch between the epsilon of spinach and the epsilon of Pisum sativum, inhibits ATPase activity with a reduced potency similar to that of purified pea epsilon. Four of the six amino acids are serine or threonine. These hydroxylated amino acids may be important in epsilon-CF1 interactions.
