Bioaugmentation of bioreactors focuses on the removal of xenobiotics, with little attention typically paid to the recovery of disrupted reactor functions such as ammonium-nitrogen removal. Chloroanilines are widely used in industry as a precursor to a variety of products and are occasionally released into wastewater streams. This work evaluated the effects on activated-sludge reactor functions of a 3-chloroaniline (3-CA) pulse and bioaugmentation by inoculation with the 3-CA-degrading strain Comamonas testosteroni I2 gfp. Changes in functions such as nitrification, carbon removal, and sludge compaction were studied in relation to the sludge community structure, in particular the nitrifying populations. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), real-time PCR, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to characterize and enumerate the ammonia-oxidizing microbial community immediately after a 3-CA shock load. Two days after the 3-CA shock, ammonium accumulated, and the nitrification activity did not recover over a 12-day period in the nonbioaugmented reactors. In contrast, nitrification in the bioaugmented reactor started to recover on day 4. The DGGE patterns and the FISH and real-time PCR data showed that the ammonia-oxidizing microbial community of the bioaugmented reactor recovered in structure, activity, and abundance, while the number of ribosomes of the ammonia oxidizers in the nonbioaugmented reactor decreased drastically and the community composition changed and did not recover. The settleability of the activated sludge was negatively influenced by the 3-CA addition, with the sludge volume index increasing by a factor of 2.3. Two days after the 3-CA shock in the nonbioaugmented reactor, chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency decreased by 36% but recovered fully by day 4. In contrast, in the bioaugmented reactor, no decrease of the COD removal efficiency was observed. This study demonstrates that bioaugmentation of wastewater reactors to accelerate the degradation of toxic chlorinated organics such as 3-CA protected the nitrifying bacterial community, thereby allowing faster recovery from toxic shocks.
