We have utilized the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify a transcribed Taq1 polymorphism in the ribonucleotide reductase M1 subunit (RRM1) gene at chromosome 11p15.5, to investigate whether this locus is subjected to imprinting in embryonal tumours. The polymorphism was amplified from cDNA from 6 Wilms' tumours, one hepatoblastoma and corresponding samples of adjacent kidney or liver from individuals who were constitutionally heterozygous for the polymorphism. Taq1 digestion of PCR products revealed that both alleles were transcribed in all samples where both were present at the genomic level, indicating that the RRM1 locus is not subjected to imprinting in Wilms' tumour or hepatoblastoma.
