Booroola Merino sheep are characterized by a high ovulation rate attributable to the presence of the FecB allele of the FEC gene. This gene, which has been assigned to sheep chromosome 6, is linked to the gene for EGF, which in man is located on the long arm of chromosome 4 (HSA 4q). To increase the number of known markers on sheep chromosome 6, we used comparative mapping data from sheep, man, and cattle. In our study, we show a synteny between EGF and the genes PDHA2 and FGF5 (from HSA 4q) and microsatellites ILSTS018, ILSTS090, and ILSTS093 (from bovine chromosome 6) in sheep. We also show that the conservation between HSA 4q and sheep chromosome 6 is disrupted between EGF and FGF2.
