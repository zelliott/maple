The spotted wolffish Anarhichas minor is a promising new species for cold-water aquaculture. The broad host-range of piscine nodavirus (NV) and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) makes them potentially pathogenic to new fish species in aquaculture. IPNV and NV strains highly pathogenic in farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and halibut Hippoglossus hippoglassus, respectively, in Norway were used for the challenge of spotted wolffish. In general, water-borne infection with IPNV and NV resulted in significant mortality among juveniles <1 g. Cumulative mortality after bath-challenge and cohabitation was 60 to 75% in the smallest juveniles (0.3 g). Intramuscular and intraperitoneal injection of NV was 100% lethal to wolffish of 10 g, and the groups at 12 degrees C died before those at 7 degrees C. No cohabitants of this size died, but NV was still detectable in these individuals after 10 wk. A persistent IPNV infection with low mortality developed in bath-challenged juveniles of 0.7 g, in which IPNV was still detectable 4 mo later. This study comprises a demonstration of experimental viral infections in cultured spotted wolffish, although to date no natural outbreaks of viral diseases have been reported in this species.
