The molecular events associated with the development of common myeloid progenitor (CMP) remain largely unknown. This study reports that a novel glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored lactoferrin CSP82 on uninitiated mouse bone marrow cells (BMC) may be involved in inducing pro-DC from CMP. By peptide mass fingerprinting, CSP82 has been identified as the mouse lactoferrin precursor, but unlike the latter, it occurs as a GPI-linked cell-surface protein. The GPI-linkage was demonstrated on BMC-derived immunoprecipitates and by other techniques. Furthermore, BMC and hematopoietic stem BM cells following incubation with either CSP82 peptide antibody or purified Reagent A yielded CMP-like progenitors (BM4 cells). These progenitors expressed a previously reported cytosolic phosphoprotein DP58 (AnkRD 34B protein). Continued cultivation of BMC in media containing only anti-CSP82 antibody led to DC-like cells, that bore phenotypic and endocytic resemblance with those obtained using GM-CSF. The results suggest that a receptor lactoferrin on BMC may be an important non-cytokine mechanism for early promyeloid progenitor differentiation.
