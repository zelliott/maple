A unique coryneform bacterium was isolated from a patient with bacterial vaginosis. Chemotaxonomical investigations demonstrated that the unknown bacterium belonged to the genus Corynebacterium. The yellow-pigmented, slightly lipophilic, oxidative, urea-hydrolyzing bacterium could be phenotypically readily differentiated from the other members of the genus Corynebacterium. Comparative 16S rRNA gene analysis revealed that the bacterium represented a new subline within the genus Corynebacterium for which the name Corynebacterium lipophiloflavum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CCUG 37336 (DSM 44291).
