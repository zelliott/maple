The alpha-(1-->6)-linked and the alpha-(1-->2)-linked linear mannotetraose glycosides and, respectively, and the branched mannopentaoside [R=CH2(CH2)2CH2Cl] were synthesised by conventional methods in solution, using trichloroacetimidate donors, and the products were obtained in 39%, 42% and 40% overall yield, respectively. For comparative purposes, the same two linear tetrasaccharides were prepared by use of MPEG as a soluble polymer support, the yields being 34% and 14%, respectively. An attempted MPEG-supported synthesis of the branched pentasaccharide was unsuccessful. The merits and shortcomings of oligosaccharide syntheses on MPEG are discussed.
