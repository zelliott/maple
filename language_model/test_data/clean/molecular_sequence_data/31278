The amino acid sequences of the large proteins of potexviruses and tymoviruses were aligned. It was shown that three domains of these proteins display significant similarity between the two virus groups. In contrast to central (putative NTPase-helicase) and C-terminal (putative polymerase) domains, the conservative N-terminal domain of the potexvirus/tymovirus large protein displayed no obvious similarity to the respective regions of the large proteins of other Sindbis-like viruses.
