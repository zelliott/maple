Genes encoding the 2 subunits of tryptophan synthase in Pseudomonas putida have been identified and cloned by their similarity to the corresponding genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The deduced amino acid sequences were confirmed by comparison with regions ascertained earlier by protein sequencing. The Pseudomonas amino acid sequences are 85% identical for the beta subunit and 70% identical for the alpha subunit. These sequences are compared to those of Salmonella typhimurium, where the structure is known from X-ray crystallography. Although amino acid conservation drops to 54% and 36% for the beta and alpha subunits, only 3 single residue gaps are required to maintain alignment throughout and most of the residues identified as important for catalysis or cofactor binding are conserved. The 23 residues surrounding the beta chain lysine that enters into a Schiff base linkage with the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor are compared in 13 species, including representatives from the eukaryotic and both prokaryotic kingdoms; appreciable conservation is apparent. The approximately 100 base pairs separating the trpB gene from its divergently transcribed activator gene are similar in the 2 pseudomonads, but do not resemble those of any other bacterium or fungus studied to date.
