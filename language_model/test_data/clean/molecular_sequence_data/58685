A composite 1458-bp cDNA that encodes cytochrome P450 (P450) Cyp4e2 has been constructed from clones isolated from two Drosophila embryonic cDNA libraries. The Drosophila cDNA open reading frame encodes a protein of 486 amino acids that is 40% identical and 61% similar to Cyp4d1 from Drosophila. The predicted protein is unusual in that it appears to lack the hydrophobic N-terminus typical of microsomal P450s and also contains a small insertion at its C-terminus.
