Tilted peptides are short hydrophobic protein fragments characterized by an asymmetric distribution of their hydrophobic residues when helical. They are able to interact with a hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface (such as a lipid membrane) and to destabilize the organized system into which they insert. They were detected in viral fusion proteins and in proteins involved in different biological processes involving membrane insertion or translocation of the protein in which they are found. In this paper, we have analysed different protein domains related to membrane insertion with regard to their tilted properties. They are the N-terminal signal peptide of the filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA), a Bordetella pertussis protein secreted in high amount and the hydrophobic domain from proteins forming pores (i.e. ColIa, Bax and Bcl-2). From the predictions and the experimental approaches, we suggest that tilted peptides found in those proteins could have a more general role in the mechanism of insertion/translocation of proteins into/across membranes. For the signal sequences, they could help the protein machinery involved in protein secretion to be more active. In the case of toroidal pore formation, they could disturb the lipids, facilitating the insertion of the other more hydrophilic helices.
