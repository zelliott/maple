relA and spoT are designations for two unlinked Escherichia coli genes whose products function in the synthesis and degradation of guanosine 3',5'-bispyrophosphate during the stringent regulatory response to amino acid deprivation. The RelA protein catalyzes an ATP:GTP 3'-pyrophosphoryl group transfer reaction, and the SpoT protein has a guanosine 3',5'-bispyrophosphate 3'-pyrophosphohydrolyase activity. Both genes have been sequenced recently; the relA gene produces an 84-kDa protein, and the spoT gene is deduced to encode a 79-kDa protein. We report here that the protein sequences of the relA and spoT genes are extensively interrelated.
