Single-molecule studies of RNA folding and unfolding are providing impressive details of the intermediates that occur and their rates of interconversion. The folding and unfolding of RNA are controlled by varying the concentration of magnesium ions and measuring fluorescence energy transfer, or by applying force to the RNA and measuring the end-to-end distance. The hierarchical nature of RNA folding - first secondary structure, then tertiary structure - makes the process susceptible to analysis and prediction.
