Three new glycosides, 7-deoxyloganic acid beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester (1), (3R)-hydrangenol 8,4'-di-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (2), and (6R,7E,9R)-megastigma-4,7-dien-3-one 9,13-di-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (3), have been isolated from the leaves of Hydrangea macrophylla subsp. serrata (THUNB.) MAKINO (Saxifragaceae). The structures of 1-3 were elucidated on the basis of spectral data and chemical evidence.
