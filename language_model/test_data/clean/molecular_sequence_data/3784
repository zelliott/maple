The multisubunit microtubule motor, cytoplasmic dynein, targets to various subcellular locations in eukaryotic cells for various functions. The cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain (HC) contains the microtubule binding and ATP binding sites for motor function, whereas the intermediate chain (IC) is implicated in the in vivo targeting of the HC. Concerning any targeting event, it is not known whether the IC has to form a complex with the HC for targeting or whether the IC can target to a site independently of the HC. In the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, the dynein HC is localized to the ends of microtubules near the hyphal tip. In this study, we demonstrate that our newly identified dynein IC in A. nidulans is also localized to microtubule ends and is required for HC's localization to microtubule ends in living cells. With the combination of two reagents, an HC loss-of function mutant and the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused IC that retains its function, we show that the IC's localization to microtubule ends also requires HC, suggesting that cytoplasmic dynein HC-IC complex formation is important for microtubule end targeting. In addition, we show that the HC localization is not apparently altered in the deletion mutant of NUDF, a LIS1-like protein that interacts directly with the ATP-binding domain of the HC. Our study suggests that, although HC-IC association is important for the targeting of dynein to microtubule ends, other essential components, such as NUDF, may interact with the targeted dynein complex to produce full motor activities in vivo.
