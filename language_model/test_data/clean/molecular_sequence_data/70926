This paper describes a new enzyme-linked ligand sorbent assay (ELLSA) to quantify free apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)). The new test immobilizes free apo(a) utilizing a specific peptide that carries the amino acid sequence of a non-covalent apo(a) binding site on apoB3375-3405 (ligand-peptide). The ligand-peptide coupled to Sepharose was used in affinity chromatography to separate free apo(a) from whole serum. Isolated free apo(a) consisted of full length apo(a) and smaller apo(a). Additionally, free apo(a) levels determined by ELLSA as well as by electroimmunodiffusion correlated moderately well. Significantly increased serum concentrations of free apo(a) were found in coronary artery disease. The mean value of free apo(a) was three times higher in patients than in controls while the lipoprotein(a) (Lpla)) concentration was doubled. Utilizing receiver operating characteristic diagrams, it was shown that the free apo(a)-ELLSA had a better diagnostic test performance in atherosclerotic risk assessment than the Lp(a)-test: specificity free apo(a)-ELLSA 0.77, Lp(a)-test 0.81 [with (a:a)-enzyme immunoassay (EIA)] to 0.83 [with (a:B)-EIA]; sensitivity free apo(a)-ELLSA 0.57, Lp(a)-test 0.36 to 0.40. In conclusion, the new free apo(a)-ELLSA allows for the specific quantification of free apo(a). This provides an interesting indicator for atherosclerotic risk assessment.
