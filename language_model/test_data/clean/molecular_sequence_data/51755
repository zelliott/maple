The main feature of cellular senescence is cessation of cell proliferation. Protooncogene c-fos, which is required for the cell to enter into DNA synthesis, is repressed in senescent fibroblasts. Diminished expression of c-fos and impaired formation of AP-1, which is a complex of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins acting as a transcription factor, was found in lymphocytes derived from old (> 18 months) mice and stimulated with Con A. There were no differences in c-jun expression and formation of other transcription factors (AP-2 and AP-3) between lymphocytes isolated from old and young mice.
