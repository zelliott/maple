A human antibody library constructed by utilizing a phage display system was used for the isolation of human antibodies with neutralizing activity specific for human rotavirus. In the library, the Fab form of an antibody fused to truncated cp3 is expressed on the phage surface. Purified virions of strain KU (G1 serotype and P[8] genotype) were used as antigen. Twelve different clones were isolated. Based on their amino acid sequences, they were classified into three groups. Three representative clones-1-2H, 2-3E, and 2-11G-were characterized. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with virus-like particles (VLP-VP2/6 and VLP-VP2/6/7) and recombinant VP4 protein produced from baculovirus recombinants indicated that 1-2H and 2-3E bind to VP4 and that 2-11G binds to VP7. The neutralization epitope recognized by each of the three human antibodies might be human specific, since all of the antigenic mutants resistant to mouse monoclonal neutralizing antibodies previously prepared were neutralized by the human antibodies obtained here. After conversion from the Fab form of an antibody into immunoglobulin G1, the neutralizing activities of these three clones toward various human rotavirus strains were examined. The 1-2H antibody exhibited neutralizing activity toward human rotaviruses with either the P[4] or P[8] genotype. Similarly, the 2-3E antibody showed cross-reactivity against HRVs with the P[6], as well as the P[8] genotype. In contrast, the 2-11G antibody neutralized only human rotaviruses with the G1 serotype. The concentration of antibodies required for 50% neutralization ranged from 0.8 to 20 micro g/ml.
