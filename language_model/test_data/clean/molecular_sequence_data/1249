Sequencing of porcine cDNAs identified a novel EST with high frequency in placenta tissue. Full-length PLET1 (placenta-expressed transcript 1, also called C11orf34) matched a mouse cDNA and many bovine and mouse ESTs but no human transcripts or ESTs. However, the porcine cDNA matched several putative exons within a human genomic DNA fragment on chromosome 11. This human locus is in a region of conserved synteny with pig chromosome 9, to which the porcine gene was subsequently mapped. RNA blot hybridization showed that this gene had high expression in porcine and mouse conceptus and throughout placenta development. In situ hybridization using mouse placenta showed PLET1 expression in trophoblast cells of the labyrinth, as well as in spongiotrophoblast and glycogen trophoblast cells. However, no expression of PLET1 was detected by RNA blot analysis of human placenta, although RT-PCR analysis detected very small amounts of partially spliced RNA that were significantly less abundant than the RNA levels in mouse placenta. Donor and acceptor splicing site sequences in the exons of the human gene are poorly conserved and may be the cause of inefficient splicing found specifically in human tissue. Our data correct GenomeScan annotation of this region of the human genome and describe functional gene discovery in mammals not recognized in human EST projects.
