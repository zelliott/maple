Pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins are expressed by virtually all plants in response to pathogen infection and, in many cases, in response to abiotic stresses as well and include the PR10 family. However, the precise roles of the PR10 protein family in abiotic stress responses are not clear. In this paper we report, for the first time, that the constitutive expression of a pea PR10 gene in Brassica napus enhances their germination and growth in the presence of NaCl. Our findings are discussed within the context of PR10 protein function and their utility in engineering stress tolerant crops.
