We report the sequence of the subgenomic RNA of human astrovirus serotype 2. This 2,484-nucleotide RNA contains a single open reading frame, which encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 88 kDa. We propose that this protein is the 90-kDa capsid precursor observed in infected cells. The deduced protein sequence does not contain conserved amino acid patterns reported for the capsid proteins of picornaviruses or caliciviruses, consistent with the classification of astroviruses as a new family of RNA viruses, designated Astroviridae.
