During the menstrual cycle, the endometrium undergoes characteristic changes in response to circulating sex steroids. Intense mitotic activity of glands and stroma occurs in the proliferative (estradiol-dominant) phase, and glandular secretion and stromal differentiation in the secretory (progesterone-dominant) phase. The insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) promote cellular growth and differentiation and have been proposed to participate in these cyclic endometrial events, acting as mediators of steroid hormones. The objective of this study was to determine whether the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding the IGF peptides and the type I and type II IGF receptors are differentially expressed in human endometrium during the menstrual cycle and in early pregnancy. A solution hybridization ribonuclease protection assay, using 32P-labeled riboprobes for IGF-I, IGF-II, and beta-actin (control), revealed IGF-I gene expression primarily in proliferative and early secretory endometrium and abundant IGF-II gene expression in mid-late secretory endometrium and early pregnancy decidua. Northern analysis, using IGF-I and IGF-II complementary DNA probes, revealed multiple IGF-I mRNAs [2-7.6 kilobase (kb)], expressed primarily in proliferative and early secretory endometrium, and IGF-II mRNAs (1.4-6.0 kb), expressed primarily in secretory endometrium and in early pregnancy decidua. The 7.6-kb IGF-I mRNA and the 6.0-kb IGF-II mRNA were most abundantly expressed. IGF-IEa and IGF-IEb mRNA splicing variants were present in a ratio of about 9:1, respectively. Type I and type II IGF receptor gene expression in endometrium was investigated using specific riboprobes and the ribonuclease protection assay. Messenger RNAs encoding both receptors were more abundantly expressed in the secretory phase and during early pregnancy, compared to the proliferative phase. These results show that mRNAs encoding the IGF peptides and their receptors are differentially expressed in human endometrium, depending on the steroid hormone milieu. The preferential expression of IGF-I mRNA in the proliferative phase supports the hypothesis that IGF-I is an estromedin in human endometrium. The expression of endometrial IGF-II mRNA in the mid to late secretory phase and in early pregnancy supports a role for IGF-II in differentiative functions of the endometrium, perhaps including endometrial tissue shedding in the menstrual cycle or remodeling during early pregnancy.
