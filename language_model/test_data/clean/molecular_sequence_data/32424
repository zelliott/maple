Skophammer et al. [Skophammer, RG, Herbold, CW, Rivera, MC, Servin, JA, Lake, JA. 2006. Evidence that the root of the tree of life is not within the Archaea. Mol Biol Evol, 23, 1648-1651] report evidence suggesting that the tree of life cannot be rooted within the Archaea domain. I have observed that an alignment used in their analysis is not reliable and that, therefore, their conclusions are unjustified.
