Sequencing studies of HLA class II molecules have been focused almost exclusively on the highly polymorphic exon 2. In this study the complete cDNA sequence of four alleles of the DR14 lineage (DR52 group) are reported for the first time. The HLA-DRB1*1402 and *1403 sequences were shown to be identical to the previously determined DRB1*13011 sequence, also of the DR52 group, in exons 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6. HLA-DRB1*14011 and *1404 were identical to DRB1*13011 in exons 1, 4, 5 and 6 sequences while they showed specific features within their exon 3 sequence. Both alleles showed a synonymous substitution at the third base of codon 114. However, DRB1*14011 also has a non-synonymous substitution at the first base of codon 112 which results in a histidine to tyrosine substitution. This is a novel substitution as Histidine 112 is conserved in all known HLA class II B genes.
