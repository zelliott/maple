The present detailed analysis of the sequence of the extremely long (967 bp) 5'-noncoding region of a rat brain argininosuccinate lyase cDNA clone, reveals several features of interest. Multiple copies of partial and inverted (antisense) B1 repeats and multiple upstream ATG codons are present in the region, which suggests a possibility of translational control of the argininosuccinate lyase gene expression in rat brain.
