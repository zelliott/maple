Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays an important role in embryonic patterning and adult stem cell renewal but has recently been found also to be involved in certain stem cell cancers. One of the first steps in Hh signaling is the autoprocessing of Hh protein, in which the C-terminal domain (Hh-C) catalyzes a cholesterol-dependent autocleavage reaction that leads to the production of the cholesterol ester of the N-terminal Hh domain (Hh-N), thereby yielding a signaling molecule that activates the Hh pathway by binding to the Patched receptor. This article describes an in vitro, homogeneous assay system that measures changes in fluorescence polarization that accompany the cholesterol-dependent autocleavage of Hh protein. The assay system makes use of a modified Hh protein in which Hh-N, which is not essential for autocleavage, is replaced by a 25-residue peptide containing a tetracysteine motif, complexed with a bisarsenical fluorophore. The assay is quite robust and easily adapted to high-throughput screening in 384-well plates with Z' factors above 0.8. It has been used to screen the National Institutes of Health Clinical Collection, which has led to the identification of 2 compounds that inhibit the cholesterol-dependent autocleavage of Hh protein at micromolar concentrations.
