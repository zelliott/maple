The three large RNA segments of influenza C virus C/JJ/50 were cloned and sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequences were compared with those of the polymerase (P) proteins of influenza A and B viruses. The coding strategy of the C virus RNA segments is the same as that for the large A and B virus segments as one long open reading frame is present in each segment. RNA segment 1 of influenza C virus encodes the equivalent of the PB2 protein; it has an approximate 25% sequence identity with the corresponding (cap binding) influenza A and B virus PB2 proteins. The PB1 protein of influenza C virus, coded for by segment 2, has an approximate 40% sequence identity with the corresponding proteins of influenza A and B viruses including the Asp-Asp sequence motif found in many RNA polymerase molecules. The PB1 polymerase is thus the most highly conserved protein among the influenza A, B, and C viruses. Although the protein coded for by RNA 3 of influenza C virus shows an approximate 25% sequence identity with the acid polymerase (PA) proteins of the A and B viruses, its sequence does not display any acid charge features at neutral pH. This protein is thus referred to as the P3 (rather than the PA) protein of influenza C virus.
