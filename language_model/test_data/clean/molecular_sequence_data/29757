As higher density formats become more and more common in HTS labs, the expectations for maintaining faster, lower cost screens puts great pressure on traditional 96-well screens. In some cases higher density formats are not compatible with the assay. This seems especially true in cell-based assays. In our case, the nature of the cells' response forced us to remain in 96-well plates. In this paper, we describe the development of a luminescence reporter assay and its performance in two detection modes, flash and glow. The advantages in cost and throughput for each technique are explored, along with automation considerations. An additional new technology, the use of pins for low-volume transfers, is also briefly described because of its dramatic effect on our screen's throughput. However, it will be more thoroughly presented in a future publication. Comparing the technologies available for HTS aids in designing automated systems that meet the unique needs of each assay.
