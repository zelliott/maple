Two strains of anaerobic, Gram-stain-negative bacilli isolated from the human oral cavity (D033B-12-2(T) and D080A-01) were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests and were found to be distinct from any previously described species. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the strains were related most closely to the type strain of Prevotella marshii (93.5 % sequence identity). The novel strains were saccharolytic and produced acetic acid and succinic acid as end products of fermentation. The principal cellular long-chain fatty acids were C₁₆ :₀), iso-C₁₄:₀, C₁₄:₀, anteiso-C₁₅:₀, iso-C₁₆ :₀ and C₁₆:₀) 3-OH. The G+C content of the DNA of strain D033B-12-2(T) was 44 mol%. Strains D033B-12-2(T) and D080A-01 are considered to represent a single novel species of the genus Prevotella, for which the name Prevotella saccharolytica sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is D033B-12-2(T) (=DSM 22473(T) =CCUG 57944(T)).
