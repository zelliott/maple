B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a cardiac hormone that regulates hemodynamic equilibrium. In the circulation, its activity is controlled by proteolytic factors. Accurate measurement of BNP in a patient's plasma may be affected by degradation due to proteolysis.

We report on the identification and performance of classes of protease inhibitors that stabilize BNP in plasma.

Using the Bayer ADVIA Centaur BNP assay, we measured the effect of arginine, serine and/or specific kallikrein protease inhibitors (PIs) on exogenous spiked or endogenous BNP in patient plasma.

Compared to controls without inhibitor, all PIs were capable, to varying degrees, of retarding the rate of proteolytic degradation. The kallikrein-specific inhibitor, D-Phe-Phe-Arg-chloromethylketone (PPACK II) was most effective as a single constituent and was able to eliminate BNP degradation in patient samples for up to 6-10 days when stored at 2-8 degrees C.

The stability of BNP was markedly increased in the presence of kallikrein-specific PPACK II and a broad spectrum of serine PIs. Use of these compounds offers a simple method of extending sample handling and storage of plasma samples containing BNP.
