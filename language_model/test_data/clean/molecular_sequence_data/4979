The phylogenetic relationships of gibbons are still open questions. We have sequenced a mitochondrial cytochrome b gene fragment from Hylobates hoolock, H. concolor, H. lar and H. syndactylus. Combined with the sequences from Garza and Woodruff (1992), we have constructed a comprehensive phylogenetic tree of the gibbons using the maximum-parsimony analysis. Our results suggested that the gibbons should be divided into four groups: (1) hoolock, (2) syndactylus, (3) agilis, lar, muelleri and klossi, and (4) concolor, which correspond to the four morphological subgenera. There are at least four distinct clades in the concolor population, which indicates that the concolor may be divided into at least four species. Therefore, those four clades should be managed separately with the same conservation effort.
