A novel human cDNA encoding a cysteine protease of the papain family named cathepsin F is reported. The mature part of the predicted protease precursor displays between 26% and 42% identity to other human cysteine proteases while the proregion is unique by means of length and sequence. The very long proregion of the cathepsin F precursor (251 amino acid residues) can be divided into three regions: a C-terminal domain similar to the pro-segment of cathepsin L-like enzymes, a 50 residue flexible linker peptide, and an N-terminal domain predicted to adopt a cystatin-like fold. Cathepsin F would therefore be the first cysteine protease zymogen containing a cystatin-like domain.
