We report the isolation of the mouse JNK/SAPKalpha gene, the determination of its exon/intron organization and the characterization of its promoter region. The mouse JNK/SAPKalpha gene spans a region of 36 kbp and contains 13 exons, which represent about 8% of the gene sequence. Major JNK/SAPKalpha splice variants (I and II) are generated by alternative splicing of exons 7 and 8, respectively, whereas minor variants (III and IV) are generated using cryptic sites located inside exon 9. The regulatory elements of the JNK/SAPKalpha gene are located in a 400-bp region placed upstream of the first exon. The gene lacks a TATA element and the initiation of transcription is located inside a 1-kbp CG island. Two regulatory regions located at -98/-69 and -69/-30 were defined by deletion analysis of the promoter.
