Bovine enteroviruses are currently classified into two serotypes within the species Bovine enterovirus (BEV). Comparison of the sequences of six American and eleven German BEV isolates with published BEV sequences revealed the necessity to revise the taxonomy of these viruses. Molecular data indicate that the bovine enteroviruses are composed of two clusters (designated BEV-A and -B) each with two and three geno-/serotypes, respectively. Whereas low amino acid identity of the capsid proteins 1C (VP3) and 1D (VP1) is the main criterion for the discrimination of geno-/serotypes, the BEV clusters, presumably representing species, differ in sequence identity of all viral proteins. In addition, characteristic lengths of (i) the capsid proteins 1B, 1C and 1D, (ii) the 2C protein, and (iii) the 3'-non-translated region are observed. The BEVs can be distinguished from the other enteroviruses by sequence identity and unique features of the 5'-non-translated region, i.e. a conserved second cloverleaf and characteristic RNA structures of the internal ribosome entry site. Phylogenetically, the closest relatives of the bovine enteroviruses are the porcine enteroviruses. Incongruent phylogenies of the 5'-non-translated region, the capsid proteins and the 3D polymerase indicate frequent intraserotypic and interserotypic recombination within the non-capsid and the capsid region of the BEV genome.
