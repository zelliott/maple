Nitric oxide has attracted considerable interest from plant pathologists due its established role in regulating mammalian anti-microbial defences, particularly via programmed cell death (PCD). Although NO plays a major role in plant PCD elicited in response to certain types of pathogenic challenge, the race-specific hypersensitive response (HR), it is now evident that NO also acts in the regulation of non-specific, papilla-based resistance to penetration by plant cells that survive attack and, possibly, in systemic acquired resistance. Equally, the potential roles of NO signalling/scavenging within the pathogen are being recognized. This review will consider key defensive roles played by NO in living cells during plant-pathogen interactions, as well as in those undergoing PCD.
