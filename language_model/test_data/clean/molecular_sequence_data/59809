Two nodule cDNA clones representing genes involved in Alnus glutinosa nitrogen metabolism were analysed. ag11 encoded glutamine synthetase (GS), the enzyme responsible for ammonium assimilation, while ag118 encoded acetylornithine transaminase (AOTA), an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of citrulline, the nitrogen transport form in Alnus. GS mRNA was found at highest levels in root nodules, where it was present in the infected cells as well as in the cells of the pericycle of the vascular system. AOTA transcripts were found at high levels in nodules, confined to the infected cells, suggesting that in nodules of A. glutinosa, citrulline biosynthesis takes place mainly in the infected cells.
