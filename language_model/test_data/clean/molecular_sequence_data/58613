We have isolated 48 yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones from a 4 cM/27 cR region of human chromosome 9q22.3 encompassed by the markers cen-D9S196-D9S173-tel. Within this region, we have assembled a 4.3-Mb YAC contig across the interval cen-FACC-D9S173-tel containing 42 clones. As a first step toward completing the detailed transcription map of the region, we have mapped 9 gene sequences and 10 expressed sequence tags. Fifteen polymorphic microsatellite repeat markers and 17 novel sequence-tagged sites from the region are also described. The mapping of polymorphic simple tandem repeat markers has permitted the integration of existing genetic and physical maps of the region. Together these maps provide a valuable resource for fine structure mapping and DNA sequencing across the region as well as for the identification of disease gene loci and the isolation of novel coding sequences.
