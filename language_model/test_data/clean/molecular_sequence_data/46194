E7 is the major oncoprotein of high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) which causes cervical cancer. To date E7 oncoproteins have not been investigated in cervical adenocarcinoma. In this study we generated a rabbit monoclonal anti-HPV-16 E7 antibody, RabMab42-3, which recognizes a conformational epitope in the E7 carboxy-terminal zinc-finger resulting in a strong increase in the sensitivity for the detection of cell-associated HPV-16 E7 protein relative to conventional polyclonal anti-HPV-16 E7 antibodies. Using RabMab42-3, we show that the subcellular localization of endogenous HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein varies during the cell cycle in cervical cancer cells. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein is abundantly expressed in cervical adenocarcinoma in situ and adenocarcinoma, suggesting an important role of HPV-16 E7 for the development of these tumors. Our findings suggest that the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein could be a useful marker for the detection of cervical adenocarcinoma and their precursors.
