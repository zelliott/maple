Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques based on amplification and identification of leukemia-specific DNA sequences provide a sensitive diagnostic method for detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) with a detection limit of 10(-5) to 10(-6) (1-10 malignant cells in 10(6) normal cells). To date, the main leukemia-specific DNA sequences used as PCR targets in detection of MRD are breakpoint fusion regions of chromosome translocations and junctional regions of rearranged immunoglobulin (Ig) or T-cell receptor (TcR) genes. The recently identified tal-1 deletions involving the sil and tal-1 genes, provide a potential MRD-PCR target. tal-1 deletions are site-specific because they are mediated via recombination signal sequences homologous to Ig/TcR genes. In line with this homology, tal-1 deletions also show random insertion and deletion of nucleotides at their breakpoints, resulting in highly variable breakpoint fusion regions. The fusion region diversity can be applied to design patient-specific oligonucleotide probes. Our Southern blot analyses of a large series of 313 acute leukemias with a specific tal-1 deletion probe (SILDB) demonstrated that tal-1 deletions exclusively occur in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and not in precursor B-ALL or acute non-lymphocytic leukemias. In addition, we did not detect tal-1 deletions in normal blood cells and normal thymocytes by PCR analysis. The diversity observed in tal-1 deletion fusion regions with an average insertion and deletion of approximately 7 and approximately 6 nucleotides, respectively, allowed us to design fusion-region-specific probes. The specificity of the fusion-region probes was proven and the detection limit of the MRD-PCR technique was tested in a series of dilution experiments. The observed detection limit of 10(-5) indicates that tal-1 deletions in T-ALL represent ideal leukemia-specific PCR targets for detection of MRD.
