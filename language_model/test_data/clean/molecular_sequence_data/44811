The HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope is characteristically expressed on a series of cell adhesion molecules and also on some glycolipids in the nervous system over a wide range of species from insect to mammal. The HNK-1 epitope is involved in cell-cell and/or cell-substrate interaction and recognition during the development of the nervous system. In this study, we isolated a novel glucuronyltransferase from rat brain, which is a key enzyme of the biosynthesis of the HNK-1 epitope on glycoproteins. Based on the partial amino acid sequences, we isolated cDNA encoding the glucuronyltransferase. The primary structure deduced from the cDNA sequence predicted a type II transmembrane protein with 347 amino acids and had no detectable similarity with any other proteins of known functions, including glucuronyltransferases of the liver and olfactory epithelium. Expression of a soluble recombinant form of the enzyme in COS-1 cells produced an active glucuronyltransferase. The selective expression of the glucuronyltransferase gene in the nervous system was consistent with the almost exclusive localization of the HNK-1 epitope in the nervous system. Transfection of the glucuronyltransferase cDNA into COS-1 cells induced not only expression of the HNK-1 epitope on the cell surface but also marked morphological changes of the cells, suggesting that the HNK-1 epitope associates with the cell-substratum interaction.
