The plasmid pBINS1, containing the promoter, SD and leader peptide sequences of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase gene and 267 bp long sequence coding for human proinsulin directs the efficient synthesis of hybrid preproinsulin, as well as quantitative secretion of proinsulin outside of protease-deficient Bacillus subtilis AJ73 cells. The recombinant proinsulin has been isolated from the culture medium and its N-terminal sequence shown to be identical with that of natural human prohormone.
