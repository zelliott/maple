A rhodamine B derivative 4 containing a highly electron-rich S atom has been synthesized as a fluorescence turn-on chemodosimeter for Cu(2+). Following Cu(2+)-promoted ring-opening, redox and hydrolysis reactions, comparable amplifications of absorption and fluorescence signals were observed upon addition of Cu(2+); this suggests that chemodosimeter 4 effectively avoided the fluorescence quenching caused by the paramagnetic nature of Cu(2+). Importantly, 4 can selectively recognize Cu(2+) in aqueous media in the presence of other trace metal ions in organisms (such as Fe(3+), Fe(2+), Cu(+), Zn(2+), Cr(3+), Mn(2+), Co(2+), and Ni(2+)), abundant cellular cations (such as Na(+), K(+), Mg(2+), and Ca(2+)), and the prevalent toxic metal ions in the environment (such as Pb(2+) and Cd(2+)) with high sensitivity (detection limit < or =10 ppb) and a rapid response time (< or =1 min). Moreover, by virtue of the chemodosimeter as fluorescent probe for Cu(2+), confocal and two-photon microscopy experiments revealed a significant increase of intracellular Cu(2+) concentration and the subcellular distribution of Cu(2+), which was internalized into the living HeLa cells upon incubation in growth medium supplemented with 50 muM CuCl(2) for 20 h.
