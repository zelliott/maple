T lymphocyte responses to the MHC of an evolutionarily distant species are known to be weak compared with responses against allogeneic MHC products within a species. This fact was used to examine the regions of human MHC class II molecules required for the stimulation of strong primary immune responses against MHC alloantigens. A panel of mouse DAP.3 transfectants expressing the products of wild-type and recombinant DR1/H-2Ek MHC class II genes paired to either DR alpha or H-2E alpha genes was generated, and tested as stimulator cells for purified human T cells. A strong proliferative response to DAP.3 transfectants expressing allogeneic HLA-DR molecules was seen. In contrast, weak or absent responses were recorded against DAP.3 cells expressing H-2E molecules. Substitution of the DR1 beta chain with H-2E beta k led to a dramatic loss of recognition; alpha chain substitution had a less marked effect. Furthermore, replacement of the beta 2 domain of DR1 with H-2E sequence caused 90% inhibition, whereas introduction of the beta 2 domain of DR1 into H-2Ek led to a 10-fold increase in T cell response. These results are most readily explained if the beta 2 domain contributes to the interaction site for the CD4 molecule. Substitution of either half of the beta 1 domain led to a marked loss of response. This was more impressive following substitution of the TCR-contacting alpha-helical region of the domain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
