A marine Streptomyces sp. SNG9 was characterized by its ability to utilize poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and its copolymer poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate P (3HB-co-HV). The bacterium grew efficiently in a simple mineral liquid medium enriched with 0.1 % poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) powder as the sole carbon source. Cells excreted PHB depolymerase and degraded the polymer particles to complete clarity in 4 days. The degradation activity was detectable by the formation of a clear zone around the colony (petri plates) or a clear depth under the colony (test tubes). The expression of PHB depolymerase was repressed by the presence of simple soluble carbon sources. Bacterial degradation of the naturally occurring sheets of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) and its copolymer poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Morphological alterations of the polymers sheets were evidence for bacterial hydrolysis.
