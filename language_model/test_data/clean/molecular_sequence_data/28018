We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene for the cell envelope-located proteinase of Lactococcus lactis SK11. The gene contains a very AT-rich promoter region followed by the coding sequence of a protein of 1962 amino acids. Comparison of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the mature proteinase and the expected primary translation product of the proteinase gene indicates that the enzyme is probably synthesized as a pre-pro-protein. This is confirmed by expression studies of the proteinase gene in Escherichia coli. The amino acid sequence of the proteinase shows significant homology to a number of serine proteinases of the subtilisin family. Compared with the related proteinase of L. lactis Wg2, the proteinase of L. lactis SK11 contains a 60-amino acids duplication and a total of 44-amino acid substitutions, some of which may account for the different cleavage specificity of both enzymes. Furthermore, a region was identified in the Lactococcus proteinase, which shows homology to the membrane-anchoring domains of a number of proteins from other Gram-positive bacteria.
