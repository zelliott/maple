The site-specific endonuclease R . BspIS4I and methylase M . BspIS4I have been isolated and purified to functional purity from the thermophilic strain of Bacillus species IS4. R . BspIS4I recognizes sequence [sequence: see text] on the DNA and cleaves it as indicated by the arrows to form single-stranded 4-nucleotide 5'-protruding termini. The enzyme is an isoschizomer of BbvII. M . BspIS4I is related to adenine-specific methylase.
