A native bovine calcium-modulated rod outer segment membrane guanylate cyclase (ROS-GC) has been cloned and reconstituted to show its linkage consistent to the process of phototransduction. In the present study, a second form of the membrane guanylate cyclase has been cloned from the bovine retina. This cyclase shares a high sequence identity with ROS-GC, is specifically expressed in the bovine retina, and, like ROS-GC, is modulated in low Ca2+ by a calmodulin-like Ca2+-binding protein, termed GCAP2. For this reason, this cyclase has now been named ROS-GC2 and the previously described ROS-GC as ROS-GC1. The tail end of ROS-GC2 contains a stretch of five amino acids, a structural feature unique to itself. These findings support the existence of a calcium-modulated subfamily of ROS-GC and indicate that ROS-GC2 embodies a five amino acid signature element at its tail end.
