Sclerotinia stem rot, caused by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, is a serious disease of canola (Brassica napus L.). To increase the understanding of the B. napus- S. sclerotiorum interaction, proteins potentially involved in mediating this interaction were identified and characterized. Upon infection of canola leaves by S. sclerotiorum, necrosis of host leaves was observed by 12 h and rapidly progressed during the later time points. These morphological observations were supported by microscopic study performed at different time points after pathogen challenge. Leaf proteins were extracted and analyzed by 2-DE, which revealed the modulation of 32 proteins (12 down- and 20 up-regulated). The identities of these proteins were established by ESI-q-TOF MS/MS and included proteins involved in photosynthesis and metabolic pathways, protein folding and modifications, hormone signaling, and antioxidant defense. Gene expression analysis of selected genes was performed by qRT-PCR, whereas the elevated levels of the antioxidant enzymes peroxidase and superoxide dismutase were validated by enzyme assays. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first proteomics-based investigation of B. napus-S. sclerotiorum interaction, and the roles of many of the proteins identified are discussed within the context of this pathosystem.
