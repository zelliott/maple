A novel yellow-pigmented bacterial strain, designated ARSA-19(T), was isolated from a freshwater reservoir in Cheonan, Korea. Cells were Gram-staining-negative, rod-shaped, strictly aerobic and positive for catalase and oxidase. The phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain ARSA-19(T) belonged to the genus Flavobacterium and was related to Flavobacterium macrobrachii an-8(T) (96.5% sequence similarity), F. koreense KACC 14969(T) (96.2%), F. chungnamense KACC 14971(T) (96.1%), F. cheonanense KACC 14972(T) (96.4%) and F. aquatile ATCC 11947(T) (95.6%). The isolate contained MK-6 as the predominant menaquinone and iso-C(15:0) (21.8%), iso-C(16:0) 3-OH (10.4%), iso-C(15:1) G (9.3%), summed feature 3 (iso-C(15:0) 2-OH and/or C(16:1)ω7c; 8.2%), iso-C(15:0) 3-OH (7.7%) and iso-C(16:0) (7.3%) as the major fatty acids. The polar lipids of strain ARSA-19(T) were phosphatidylethanolamine, four unknown aminolipids and two unidentified polar lipids. The DNA G+C content of strain ARSA-19(T) was 33.3 mol%. Based on its phenotypic and genotypic characteristics and on the phylogenetic evidence presented, strain ARSA-19(T) is considered to represent a novel species in the genus Flavobacterium, for which the name Flavobacterium dankookense sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is ARSA-19(T) ( = KCTC 23179(T)  = JCM 17065(T)  = KACC 14968(T)). Emended descriptions of Flavobacterium cheonanense, Flavobacterium chungnamense, Flavobacterium koreense and Flavobacterium aquatile are also proposed.
