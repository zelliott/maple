Studies on parasite species with a wide geographic and ecological range may be confounded by still equivocal taxonomic identification. Here, we investigated genetic polymorphism and behavioural changes induced in a common intermediate host, in two different forms of Pomphorhynchus laevis based on the morphology of the larval infective stage (cystacanth). A 'smooth type' (S) and a 'wrinkled type' (W) of cystacanth were distinguished based on their surface and shape. We analysed sequence divergence at both nuclear (ribosomal gene 18S rDNA, and ribosomal internal transcribed spacers, ITS1/ITS2) and mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1) genes of P. laevis cystacanths and adults at various geographical scales. A high level of sequence divergence at ITS1, ITS2 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (11, 8 and 20%, respectively) was found between these two forms. The divergence pattern consistently discriminated two groups independently of geographic origin or host, and was congruent with larval morphology. The two forms also strongly differed in the intensity of behavioural change induced in their common intermediate host, Gammarus pulex, with the S-type parasite inducing a positive phototactism, whereas W-type infected gammarids were as photophylic as uninfected ones. Overall, our data strongly support the specific status of these two forms. We suggest that smooth cystacanths correspond to P. laevis, whereas wrinkled cystacanths might correspond to the previously described and poorly documented, Pomphorhynchus tereticollis, considered a synonym of P. laevis. This study also confirms the value of a joint analysis of internal transcribed spacers and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 genes to biogeographic studies on these species. Finally, we emphasize the importance of linking morphological and biological characteristics of acanthocephalan cystacanths to molecular data, in the study of the evolutionary ecology and systematics of this group.
