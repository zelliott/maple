Baculovirus-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) have been described in Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus; however, most of their functions remain unclear. Here we report the identification and characterization of an miRNA encoded by Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus. The identified miRNA, AcMNPV-miR-1, perfectly matched a segment in the coding sequence of the viral gene ODV-E25 and downregulated ODV-E25 mRNA expression, which likely resulted in a reduction of infectious budded virions and accelerated the formation of occlusion-derived virions.
