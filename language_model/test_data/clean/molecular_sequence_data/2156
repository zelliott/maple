A gene encoding a flagellin protein of Campylobacter coli VC167 has been cloned and sequenced. The gene was identified in a pBR322 library by hybridization to a synthetic oligonucleotide probe corresponding to amino acids 4 to 9 of the N-terminal sequence obtained by direct chemical analysis (S. M. Logan, L. A. Harris, and T. J. Trust, J. Bacteriol. 169:5072-5077, 1987). The DNA was sequenced and shown to contain an open reading frame encoding a protein with a molecular weight of 58,945 and a length of 572 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence was identical to the published N-terminal amino acid sequence of VC167 flagellin and to four internal regions whose partial sequences were obtained by direct chemical analysis of two tryptic and two cyanogen bromide peptides of VC167 flagellin. The C. coli flagellin protein contains posttranslationally modified serine residues, most of which occur within a region containing two 9-amino-acid repeating peptides separated by 34 unique amino acids. Comparisons with the sequences of flagellins from other bacterial species revealed conserved residues at the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions. Hybridization data suggest the presence of a second flagellin copy located adjacent to the first on the VC167 chromosome.
