The CD1 family of MHC class I-related proteins present foreign and self-lipid antigens for specific recognition by T cells. Based on previous experience with MHC class I and II molecules, it seems likely that a thorough knowledge of the intracellular trafficking and localization of CD1 proteins will be essential to fully understand their functions in antigen presentation and immune responses. Two studies in this issue of Immunity take a detailed look at factors affecting the localization of mouse CD1 proteins to the endocytic system of antigen-presenting cells. Their results provide intriguing evidence for the involvement of two critical components of the MHC class II endosomal processing pathway, cathepsin S and the invariant chain, in the normal functioning of CD1.
