National Institute of Virology, India has instituted molecular surveillance of measles strains in the country. In phased manner, three major cities Pune, Chennai and Bangalore were covered. Throat swab and urine from suspected measles cases from Chennai and Pune and freshly frozen brain tissues, CSF from suspected SSPE case from Bangalore were subjected to RNA extraction and Measles N&H gene RT-PCR as per WHO standard protocols. PCR positive products were sequenced. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis was carried out using WHO standard reference sequences. Virus isolation was attempted using B95a cell line. Measles genotype D7 was detected from two classical measles cases (Chennai and Pune) and in a fulminant SSPE case (Bangalore). This is the first detection of measles genotype D7 from India.
