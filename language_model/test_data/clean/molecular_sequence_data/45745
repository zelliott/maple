Fluorescent proteins are versatile tools for live cell imaging studies. In particular, recent progress was achieved in the development of monomeric red fluorescent proteins (mRFPs) that show improved properties in respect to maturation and intracellular fluorescence. mRFPmars, a red fluorescent protein designed especially for the use in Dictyostelium, proved to be a brilliant label for different cytoskeletal elements. Here we report on the synthesis of a humanized version of a monomeric RFP, mRFPruby, which differs in sequence from mRFPmars in four amino acids and has a codon usage that is optimized for the application in mammalian cells. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of this new mRFP variant, mRFPruby fused to beta-actin was expressed in different mouse cell lines and used to visualize actin cytoskeleton dynamics by live cell microscopy.
