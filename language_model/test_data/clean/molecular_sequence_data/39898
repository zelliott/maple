Traditionally fermented dairy products are still a very important part of the daily food in Romania, especially for people living in the countryside. To study the biodiversity of lactic acid bacterium strains of these products, 110 samples (raw and fermented milk, sour cream, and cheese) were collected from farm houses, monasteries, and local markets throughout Romania. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated using six different cultivation conditions. All 599 isolates were tested for their Gram reaction, catalase activity, and morphology. A rep-PCR fingerprinting technique with the (GTG)5 primer and, in some cases SDS-PAGE of total cell proteins and 16S rRNA gene sequencing were used to cluster and/or identify the LAB. The biodiversity of the isolated strains was correlated with the type of product and/or technology applied. The most frequent LAB found in Romanian raw milk and fermented dairy products were Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc spp., and Enterococcus spp. Among the latter, a new species E. saccharominimus was found.
