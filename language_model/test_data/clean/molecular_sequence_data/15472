Two marine heterotrophic bacteria, A5K-61(T) and A5K-106(T), were isolated from marine animals. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis data showed that the isolates were affiliated with the genus Thalassomonas; highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values were found with Thalassomonas viridans DSM 13754(T) (97.5 and 98.1 %, respectively). DNA-DNA hybridization values of strains A5K-61(T) and A5K-106(T) with T. viridans DSM 13754(T) (22.2-49.1 %) were clearly below 70 %, the generally accepted limit for species delineation. The isolates produced a brown diffusible pigment. The major respiratory quinone was Q-8 and the predominant cellular fatty acids were C(16 : 1)omega7c and C(16 : 0). Based on DNA-DNA hybridization data, some biochemical characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison, the isolates represent two novel species of the genus Thalassomonas, for which the names Thalassomonas actiniarum sp. nov. (type strain A5K-106(T) =MBIC08328(T) =NCIMB 14418(T) =NBRC 104231(T)) and Thalassomonas haliotis sp. nov. (type strain A5K-61(T) =MBIC08329(T) =NCIMB 14417(T) =NBRC 104232(T)) are proposed.
