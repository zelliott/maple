Self-tolerance is mainly established through clonal deletion of autoreactive T cells during thymic differentiation. The mechanisms by which deletion is achieved are poorly understood. Here we use a specific polymerase chain reaction-based system to characterize DNA fragmentation and show that after in vivo treatment of neonatal mice with staphylococcus enterotoxin B, selective apoptosis of V beta 8+ thymocytes occurs. This process precedes detectable deletion of V beta 8+ cells as determined by phenotypic analysis. Moreover, in vivo administration of cycloheximide and, to a lesser extent, actinomycin D, inhibits apoptosis of staphylococcus enterotoxin B specific thymocytes. Thus, macromolecular synthesis is a requirement for negative selection.
