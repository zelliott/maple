We have isolated a gene coding for a fourth human somatostatin (somatotropin release-inhibiting factor) receptor. This additional somatostatin receptor (hSSTR4) is specifically expressed in human fetal and adult brain and lung tissue. The deduced amino acid sequence of the receptor displays both sequence and structural homology to three cloned somatostatin receptors as well as to other members of the family of GTP-binding-protein-coupled seven-helix transmembrane-spanning receptors. Pharmacological characterization of the expressed receptor reveals specific, high-affinity binding of somatostatin 14 and somatostatin 28. Surprisingly, several well-characterized synthetic somatostatin analogs fail to exhibit high-affinity binding to hSSTR4, indicating the existence of pharmacologically different receptor subtypes. Our data suggest that the diverse biological effects exerted by somatostatin are mediated by a family of receptors with discrete patterns of expression and different pharmacological properties.
