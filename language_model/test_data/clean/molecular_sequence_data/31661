We isolated myxobacteria and explored their diversity from the rhizosphere soils of some medicinal plants.

We used the helper bacteria baiting technique to isolate myxobacteria from the rhizosphere soils collected in South China Botanical Garden and Nanling National Forest Park. The myxobacteria were identified by morphological characteristics and 16S rDNA gene sequences analysis.

A total of 50 strains were isolated from 22 soil samples, which were identified into 7 genera, Myxococcus (18), Corallococcus (11), Cystobacter (7), Archangium (8), Stigmatella (1), Chondromyces (4) and Pyxidicoccus (1). The dominant genera were Myxococcus and Corallococcus.

Environmental factors were associated with the diversity of myxobactria. Myxobacteria better adapt in high organic matter content and neutral pH environments. The strains of Myxococcus and Corallococcus had a good adaptability for different pH. Meanwhile, the dependence of the strains of Myxococcus and Cystobacter on organic carbon content was not too obvious, and they can also be found in the poor soils. Our findings provided an important scientific base for the development and utilization of myxobacteria resources.
