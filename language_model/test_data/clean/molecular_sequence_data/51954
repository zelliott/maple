We have isolated and sequenced complementary DNA (cDNA) for the human 80K-L protein, a major substrate for protein kinase C and the human homologue of an 80- to 87-kDa bovine protein named MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate). The human 80K-L cDNA encodes a protein of 332 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 31,534. Homology comparisons of the nucleotide sequences of the cDNAs indicated that their 3'-untranslated regions are more homologous than the coding regions. Spot blot hybridization using flow-sorted human chromosomes indicated that the gene encoding the 80K-L protein, designated MACS, maps to the q15----qter region of human chromosome 6, and it also suggested that a genomic region with a sequence homologous to the 3'-untranslated region of the 80K-L mRNA exists on chromosome 21.
