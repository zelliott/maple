We identified inhibitory peptide analogs (IPAs), capable of immunomodulating experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), induced in B10.RIII mice by immunization with the retinal antigen interphotoreceptor-binding protein in CFA. Alanine-substituted peptides of the major pathogenic epitope, residues 161-180, were synthesized. They were tested for immunogenicity, cross-reactivity with the native 161-180 epitope, pathogenicity, and ability to prevent EAU when given in IFA before EAU challenge with native murine (m)161-180. Two peptides, 169A and 171A, were unable to elicit disease but cross-reacted with m161-180 by lymphocyte proliferation. Mice pretreated with either of the substituted peptides failed to develop EAU after challenge with the native epitope, m161-180, and had reduced cellular responses by lymphocyte proliferation and by delayed hypersensitivity. Their cytokine response profile to m161-180 showed reduced antigen-specific IFN-gamma and IL-17, whereas IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 from IPA-protected mice were increased, and serum antibody titers to m161-180 revealed reduced IgG2a and elevated IgG1 isotypes, suggesting a Th2 shift in the response. Protection was transferable with lymphoid cells from protected donors to na√Øve recipients, who were subsequently immunized for EAU. Thus, IPA pretreatment prevents induction of EAU by skewing the response to a subsequent uveitogenic challenge with the native peptide to a nonpathogenic phenotype, as well as by eliciting transferable regulatory cells.
