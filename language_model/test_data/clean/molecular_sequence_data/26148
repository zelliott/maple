The Sulfolobus isolate B12 and its endogenous virus-like element SSV1 have provided a fruitful system for detailed analysis of certain aspects of archaebacterial molecular biology, especially those concerning gene expression. In the course of clarifying this isolate's taxonomic position, we determined DNA base composition, ability to grow autotrophically, nucleotide sequence of 16S ribosomal RNA, and level of total genomic homology to other Sulfolobus strains. Although the results generally demonstrate a similarity to S. solfataricus, DNA-DNA hybridisation and 16S rRNA sequence data indicate that isolate B12 in fact represents a distinct species.
