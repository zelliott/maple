Nitric oxide (NO), a potent and versatile free radical, is synthesized in leukocytes by the inducible form of NO synthase (iNOS). In this study, leukocytes in pregnant mouse uterus were investigated for expression of the iNOS gene. Inducible NOS mRNA, which was identified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, was high relative to an invariant mRNA, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, in midgestation uteri (gestation days [g.d.] 10, 12, and 14) but was low in late-gestation uteri (g.d. 16 and 18). Inducible NOS protein, identified immunohistochemically in paraformaldehyde-fixed uteri taken from g.d. 6 through 18 using rabbit antibodies generated to mouse carboxyl terminus iNOS peptides, was prominent in a few myometrial mast cells at early stages and was strongly expressed from g.d. 6 through g.d. 14 in myometrial macrophage-like cells. Inducible NOS protein was first detected in uterine (u) natural killer (NK) cells at g.d. 8. Signals peaked in this lineage at g.d. 10 and declined thereafter. Uterine leukocytes cultured in vitro expressed the iNOS gene; a hybridoma cell line derived from mouse uNK cells (GWM1-2) contained iNOS mRNA, and cells migrating from mouse metrial gland explants included iNOS/ leukocytes. Large, granular iNOS + uNK cells were absent from the uteri of homologously mated pregnant TgE26 mice, an NK cell-deficient transgenic mouse strain, but immunoreactive iNOS was detectable in trophoblast, a cell lineage that did not contain immunoreactive iNOS in NK cell-competent Swiss-Webster mice. In TgE26 mothers gestating normal embryos, the same pattern was observed. Collectively, the results of this study demonstrate that iNOS is present in mouse uterine leukocytes including mast cells, macrophage-like cells, and uNK cells, and suggest that in the absence of uNK cells, the placenta synthesizes iNOS. These findings are consistent with the postulate that leukocyte NO contributes importantly to events associated with successful pregnancy that are likely to include relaxation of vascular smooth muscle.
