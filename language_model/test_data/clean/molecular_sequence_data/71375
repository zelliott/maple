Endothelin (ET) is one of the most potent vasoconstrictors known. Recently, ET has been implicated in various diseases, e.g., acute renal failure and congestive heart failure, which present the possibility of treating such diseases with endothelin receptor antagonists. However, establishing the dosages for these antagonists may be difficult because no convenient physiologic indicator of action exists, and because of complexities in receptor function. Two receptor subtypes have been identified for which selective antagonists have been reported (e.g., BQ-123 for the ETA receptor and BQ-788 for the ETB receptor). Of the three natural peptide hormones (ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3), ET-1 exhibits high affinity for both subtypes of receptor. Using the selective peptide antagonists, and a nonpeptide antagonist with relatively balanced affinity for the two subtypes (L-749,329), we have characterized the interactions of [125I]ET-1 with its receptors in vivo (in rat). BQ-123, BQ-788, and L-749,329 inhibited binding consistent with binding to a single receptor site. However, the sum of inhibition by the selective antagonist was greater than 100% (as defined by inhibition with L-749,329), which suggests (a) lower in vivo selectivity than determined in vitro and/or (b) receptor subtype interactions. The latter explanation is supported, in part, by in vitro autoradiographic studies as well as studies in isolated tissues and cells. We synthesized ET-1 labeled with I-123 and obtained images of receptor distribution in both rat and rhesus monkey and have demonstrated our ability to visualize, via planar, noninvasive imaging, the occupancy of endothelin receptor by antagonists in both kidney and lung. [123I]ET-1 can therefore be used to determine clinical dosages of antagonist needed for receptor saturation.
