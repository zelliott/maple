1. The effects of forskolin, prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), dibutyryl cyclic AMP (db cyclic AMP), dibutyryl cyclic GMP (db cyclic GMP) and 3-isobutyl-l-methyl-xanthine (IBMX) were investigated on the expression of tissue factor and thrombomodulin activities on the surface of human saphenous vein endothelial cells (HSVEC) in culture. 2. Forskolin (10(-6) to 10(-4) M), PGE1 (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) and db cyclic AMP (10(-4) to 10(-3) M) caused a concentration-dependent decrease of cytokine-induced tissue factor activity. 3. Similar concentrations of forskolin, PGE1 and db cyclic AMP enhanced significantly constitutive thrombomodulin activity and reversed the decrease of this activity caused by interleukin-1 (IL-1). 4. IBMX (10(-4) M) decreased tissue factor activity and enhanced the effect of forskolin on tissue factor and thrombomodulin activities. 5. Forskolin (10(-4) M) decreased the IL-1-induced tissue factor mRNA and increased the thrombomodulin mRNA level. IL-1 did not change the thrombomodulin mRNA level after 2 h of incubation with HSVEC in culture. 6. Dibutyryl cyclic GMP (10(-4) M to 10(-3) M) did not influence tissue factor or thrombomodulin activity. 7. Our data suggest that elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP levels may participate in the regulation of tissue factor and thrombomodulin expression, thus contributing to promote or restore antithrombotic properties of the endothelium.
