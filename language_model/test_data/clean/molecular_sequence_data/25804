The gene encoding a hemolysin similar to the thermostable direct hemolysin (TDH) of Vibrio parahaemolyticus was previously cloned from the chromosome of Vibrio mimicus. The nucleotide sequence of the hemolysin gene was determined in this study. The gene proved to be a variant of the thermostable direct hemolysin gene (tdh gene) and was designated as Vm-tdh because the sequence divergences between the Vm-tdh gene and four tdh genes of V. parahaemolyticus were 2.1-3.0%, while the sequence divergences among the four tdh genes of V. parahaemolyticus ranged between 1.4 and 3.3%. Analysis of these five tdh genes revealed that they evolved from a common ancestor in discrete and understandable order by sporadic base substitutions.
