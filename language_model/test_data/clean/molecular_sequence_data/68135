Unilateral lesions by a cholinotoxin, receptor autoradiography, and in situ hybridization techniques were employed to determine if dopaminergic receptors are located on cholinergic interneurons in the caudate-putamen (CPu). Lesion of the CPu with small amounts of the cholinotoxin AF64A resulted in a significant decrease in D2 receptor mRNA and D2 receptor binding. The loss was more pronounced in lateral and central portions of the CPu. Results obtained using [3H] SCH23390 binding to D1 receptors indicated that there was no change in this dopamine receptor subtype in the AF64A-lesioned CPu. A decrease in D2 receptor mRNA and receptor binding in AF64A-lesioned animals indicates that a population of postsynaptic D2 receptors is associated with the cholinergic interneurons. Lack of any change in [3H]SCH23390 binding in the AF64A-lesioned animals suggests that D1 receptors are not located on cholinergic neurons. These results provide evidence to support the selectivity of the lesion when used as indicated.
