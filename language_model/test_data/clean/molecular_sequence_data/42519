The principal neutralization determinant (PND) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is located within the variable V3 region of the external envelope protein gp120. Although it is recognized that V3 sequences induce antibody response with restricted neutralization activity in vitro, we observed that the V3 consensus sequences representing North American/European and African isolates were highly cross-reactive, binding 94 and 77%, respectively, of sera collected from HIV-1 individuals originating from various parts of the world. Even HIV-1-positive sera from some East African residents, infected by strains whose V3 loop sequences are undoubtedly distinct from the North American/European consensus V3 loop sequence, reacted better to the V3 North American/European consensus peptide than to African-specific V3 sequences. Results indicate that the V3 consensus sequences represent the best candidates for optimal cross-reactivity with a wide variety of strains. Furthermore, using immunoassays for antibodies to prototype-specific V3 sequences, it is shown that HIV-1 strains related to the MN group are prevalent in West Africa, indicating either a West African origin of the MN-related viruses or more probably an introduction of this group of viruses through European/North American contacts.
