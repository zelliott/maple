We have identified an unusual 0.55-kb DNA repeat element specific to Entamoeba histolytica (Eh) which we call interspersed element (IE). The IE is a common feature in independently isolated genomic and cDNA fragments. Hybridization of labeled IE sequences to trophozoite DNA, RNA and first-strand cDNA prepared from poly(A)-enriched mRNA indicate that the IE are reiterated about 500 times per Eh trophozoite and that one or more can be found as RNA transcripts. These features and the degree of conservation of IE suggest a possible role for these sequences.
