The pro-inflammatory cytokine, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), has not yet been fully characterised in the model macropod, Macropus eugenii, due to incomplete sequence information in publically available genome databases. Using a Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends strategy we have confirmed the expression and complete nucleotide sequence for this molecule in lymph node tissue and activated leukocytes. Structural conservation of the mature wallaby IL-6 molecule was high when compared with human IL-6, although there was only 34% amino acid sequence identity with the human IL-6 peptide, consistent with reports of the evolutionary divergence of this cytokine. We also report the discovery of MeIL-6Î”2, a splice variant missing exon 2, which directly translates to a truncated non-functional peptide, but which may also code for an alternative peptide that is translated downstream of the canonical IL-6 start site. This putative gene product is predicted to maintain some, if not all, of the functions of macropod IL-6 and is the first IL-6 isoform reported outside of eutherian mammals.
