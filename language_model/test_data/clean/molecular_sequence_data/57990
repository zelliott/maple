The expression of the DBP (vitamin D binding protein) gene was investigated in monocytes and in peripheral blood lymphocytes. DBP message was amplified through 35 cycles of PCR amplification using specific oligonucleotide primers. PCR products of the expected size were further identified by Southern blotting using a specific DBP probe. No expression of the DBP gene could be detected in peripheral blood lymphocytes, nor in the monocyte-derived U 937 cell line. In contrast, message for DBP was identified in monocytes activated with lipopolysaccharide when analyzed between 6 and 10 h following stimulation. These results suggest that the temporal expression of the DBP gene could play a major role in the activation of monocytes by 1-25(OH)2D3.
