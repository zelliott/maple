In an effort to identify novel mRNAs modulated during the course of adipose conversion, we have used a simplified differential display technique and have isolated a cDNA encoding an amine oxidase tremendously expressed in the adipocyte, the semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO). The predicted amino acid sequence (765 amino acids) is likely to be the homologue of the human placental amine oxidase and of the partially known sequence of the rat adipocyte membrane amine oxidase. SSAO mRNAs are present in several tissues, but strikingly, the highest levels of gene expression are found in adipose tissue and aorta. Enzyme transcript levels are barely detectable in preadipocytes but are induced several hundred-fold during the adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 or 3T3-F442A cells and of rat precursor primary cultures. These changes in transcript levels parallel a sharp increase in SSAO enzyme activity. The biochemical properties of the SSAO present in 3T3-L1 or 3T3-F442A adipocytes closely resemble the features of the SSAO activity previously described in white and brown adipose tissues. Interestingly, SSAO mRNA levels and enzyme activity drop in response to effectors of the cAMP pathway and to the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha, indicating that two major signaling molecules of adipose tissue development and metabolism can control SSAO function. Moreover, the expression of SSAO transcripts and activity are clearly down-regulated in white adipose tissue from obese ZÃ¼cker rats. Because of its known stimulatory effect on glucose transport, its biochemical properties and its pattern of expression and regulation, SSAO could play an important role in the regulation of adipocyte homeostasis.
