Recently we reported that CHB11-1-3, a Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant defective in glycosylation of asparagine-linked proteins, is defective in the synthesis of dolichol [Quellhorst et al., 343:19-26, 1997: Arch Biochem Biophys]. CHB11-1-3 was found to be in the Lec9 complementation group, which synthesizes polyprenol rather than dolichol. In this paper, levels of various polyprenyl derivatives in CHB11-1-3 are compared to levels of the corresponding dolichyl derivatives in parental cells. CHB11-1-3 was found to maintain near normal levels of Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-polyprenol and mannosylphosphorylpolyprenol, despite reduced rates of synthesis, by utilizing those intermediates at a reduced rate. The Man5GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide attached to prenol in CHB11-1-3 cells and to dolichol in parental cells is the same structure, as determined by acetolysis. Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-polyprenol and Man5GlcNAc5-P-P-dolichol both appeared to be translocated efficiently in an in vitro reaction. Glycosylation of G protein was compared in vesicular stomatitus virus (VSV)-infected parent and mutant; although a portion of G protein was compared in vesicular stomatitus virus (VSV)-infected parent and mutant; although a portion of G protein was normally glycosylated in CHB11-1-3 cells, a large portion of G was underglycosylated, resulting in the addition of either one or no oligosaccharide to G. Addition of a single oligosaccharide occurred randomly rather than preferentially at one of the two sites.
