Major group HRVs bind intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and minor group HRVs bind members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family for cell entry. Whereas the former share common sequence motives in their viral capsid proteins (VPs), in the latter only a lysine residue within the binding epitope in VP1 is conserved; this lysine is also present in "K-type" major group HRVs that fail to use LDLR for infection. By using the available sequences three-dimensional models of VP1 of all HRVs were built and binding energies, with respect to module 3 of the very-low-density lipoprotein receptor, were calculated. Based on the predicted affinities K-type HRVs and minor group HRVs were correctly classified.
