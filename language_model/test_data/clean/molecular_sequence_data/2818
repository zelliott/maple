The complete nucleotide sequence of the genome of the enterovirus swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV; H/3 '76) isolated from a healthy pig has been determined using molecular cloning and DNA sequencing techniques. The RNA genome was 7400 nucleotides long, excluding the poly(A) tract, and appeared to encode a single polyprotein of 2185 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence of the polyprotein showed close homology (around 90%) to that of the previously sequenced coxsackieviruses B1, B3 and B4, and also showed homology (around 60%) to that of poliovirus. This homology allows us to predict the possible cleavage sites of the polyprotein and to identify other features of structural and functional significance, which seem to be important to the biological integrity of the virus. A detailed analysis of homology between SVDV and coxsackieviruses shows that non-structural proteins are highly conserved whereas the structural proteins are less well conserved. The 5' and 3' non-coding regions are also conserved, although there are several divergent nucleotide stretches. These stretches may differentiate SVDV from coxsackieviruses.
