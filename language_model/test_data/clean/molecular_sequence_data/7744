The cDNA for mouse long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acadl, gene symbol; LCAD, enzyme) was cloned and characterized. The cDNA was obtained by library screening and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The deduced amino acid sequence showed a high degree of homology to both the rat and the human LCAD sequence. Northern analysis of multiple tissues using the mouse Acadl cDNA as a probe showed two bands in all tissues examined. We found a total of three distinct mRNAs for Acadl. These three mRNAs were encoded by a single gene that we mapped to mouse chromosome 1. The three transcripts differed in the 3' untranslated region due to use of alternative polyadenylation sites. Quantitative evaluation of a multitissue Northern blot showed a varied ratio of the larger transcript as compared with the smaller transcripts.
