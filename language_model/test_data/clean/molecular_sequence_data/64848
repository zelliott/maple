The core (C) protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) appears to be a multifunctional protein that is involved in many viral and cellular processes. Although its effects on host cells have been extensively discussed in the literature, little is known about its main function, the assembly and packaging of the viral genome. We have studied the in vitro assembly of several deleted versions of recombinant HCV C protein expressed in E. coli. We demonstrated that the 75 N-terminal residues of the C protein were sufficient to assemble and generate nucleocapsid-like particles (NLPs) in vitro. However, homogeneous particles of regular size and shape were observed only when NLPs were produced from at least the first 79 N-terminal amino acids of the C protein. This small protein unit fused to the endoplasmic reticulum-anchoring domain also generated NLPs in yeast cells. These data suggest that the N-terminal half of the C protein is important for formation of NLPs. Similarities between the HCV C protein and C proteins of other members of the Flaviviridae are discussed.
