We have cloned and sequenced cDNAs for three isoforms of the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel beta subunit isolated from a normal human heart cDNA library. One of these subunits, designated beta a, hybridized with a 3.4-kb message, and the other two, designated beta b and beta c, hybridized with a message of approximately 1.9 kb. The presence of both of these latter two messages in human heart was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction methodology. Considering the differences between beta a and beta b/beta c, we find it likely that these messages may be encoded by two different gene sequences, beta a and beta b/beta c, and that the beta b/beta c sequence can be alternatively spliced in the 209-260 region. The data suggest that the human heart presents a different pattern of beta subunit expression from that found in the rat and rabbit heart.
