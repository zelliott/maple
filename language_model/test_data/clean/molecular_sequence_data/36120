Direct detection of chicken anemia virus (CAV) DNA in tissues and sera was investigated by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Using a pair of primers constructed to amplify the coding sequence of the CAV DNA genome, the PCR assay was shown to be extremely sensitive, being able to detect 1 fg of CAV replicative form DNA. The oligonucleotide primers used for the PCR yielded 583 base-pair (bp) amplified product, which was sized by ethidium bromide-agarose gel electrophoresis. Tissue samples from seven cases of suspected chicken infectious anemia were obtained for CAV isolation. DNA extracted from the homogenized suspension of pooled tissues of each case was analyzed by the PCR assay. Results showed that five of the seven cases were positive for CAV DNA by PCR, whereas CAV was isolated from four cases only. The PCR assay also detected CAV DNA in two of 37 serum samples from disease-free chickens. The specificity of PCR was confirmed by chemiluminescence dot-blot analysis of the amplified products.
