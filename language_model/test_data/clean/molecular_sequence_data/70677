Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, human 14-3-3 epsilon protein was found to interact with human calmodulin. In vitro binding assay between human 14-3-3 epsilon protein/peptide and calmodulin was demonstrated by native gel electrophoresis, and the interaction was shown to be calcium dependent. Our results, along with the association of the 14-3-3 epsilon protein with other signaling proteins, suggest that the 14-3-3 protein could provide a link between signal transduction and cell proliferation.
