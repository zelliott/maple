A cDNA clone, representing the mouse homologue of the recently described gene encoding the human calcium signal-modulating ligand, was isolated from a mouse thymus library. This clone exhibits extensive conservation of the primary nucleotide and deduced amino-acid sequences that, when considered with a similar secondary protein structure, transcript size and distribution of expression, suggests a similarity in function.
