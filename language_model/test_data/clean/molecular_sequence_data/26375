Cytochemical localization of blood group ABH antigens was examined in secretory cells of human cervical glands by application of a post-embedding lectin-gold as well as immuno-gold labeling procedure using monoclonal antibodies. Blood group specific lectins such as Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA), Griffonia simplicifolia agglutinin I-B4 (GSAI-B4) and Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I (UEA-I) reacted with secretory granules but not with other cytoplasmic organellae such as nucleus and cell membrane. The reactivity of secretory granules with these lectins showed strict dependence on the blood group and secretor status of tissue donors. The binding patterns with these lectins were not homogeneous, but exhibited marked cellular and subcellular heterogeneity. Thus, for example, in blood group A individuals, some granules were stained strongly with DBA and others were weakly or not at all with the lectin. Such a heterogenous labeling with the lectin was observed even in the same cells. Similar results were obtained with UEA-I and GSAI-B4 staining in blood group O and B secretor individuals, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies likewise reacted specifically with the granules but they occasionally bound to some nucleus. The labeling pattern of the antibodies with the granules was essentially the same as those of lectins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
