Corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 2beta (CRF R2beta) is a member of the Class B heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors. This receptor is positively coupled to adenylate cyclase and is bound preferentially by the CRF-related peptides, urocortin (Ucn), Ucn II and Ucn III. In the rodent, CRF R2beta messenger RNA (mRNA) is expressed in the cardiovascular system, where its levels can be modulated by Ucn. In the present study, we investigated regulation of CRF R2beta levels by Ucn in A7r5 aortic smooth muscle cells. Ribonuclease protection assays show that A7r5 cells expressed the CRF R2beta subtype, which had two isoforms differing in one codon at the junction of exons 3 and 4. Ucn induced accumulation of intracellular cAMP via CRF R2beta in this cell line. In addition to the treatment with Ucn, cAMP agonists or analogues themselves caused a significant decrease in CRF R2beta mRNA levels. Blockade of Ucn- or cAMP-induced decreases in CRF R2beta mRNA levels by H7, a broad protein kinase inhibitor, suggested that a protein kinase pathway might be involved in this regulation. H89, a protein kinase A inhibitor, partially blocked Ucn- or cAMP-induced decreases in CRF R2beta mRNA levels. Thus, Ucn induces intracellular cAMP to downregulate CRF R2beta mRNA expression in A7r5 cells.
