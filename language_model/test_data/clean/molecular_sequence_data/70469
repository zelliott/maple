Proper peptide presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-encoded class II antigens is dependent on the products of the MHC DM loci. We identified the rabbit orthologues (RLA-DMA and -DMB) of human HLA-DMA and -DMB and found that they have 76.9% and 78.8% identity with HLA-DMA and -DMB, respectively. Like classical class II MHC genes, RLA-DM genes are more closely related to human HLA-DM genes than to mouse H2-DM. Among the DM family, there is a high degree of variability at the amino terminus of the DMa chains, and length variability in the cytoplasmic tails of both DMalpha and DMbeta. The rabbit DM genes are coexpressed with class II genes in lymphoid tissues, as are the DM genes of other mammals. The RLA-DM locus maps to the class II region of the rabbit MHC, and is flanked by the DP and DOB loci. Despite having some similarities to class II genes of bony fishes, the DM family represents a separate branch of the MHC class II family.
