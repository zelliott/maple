The taxonomic relationship between [Flexibacter] aggregans IAM 14894(T) and Flexithrix dorotheae NBRC 15987(T) was investigated by means of DNA-DNA hybridization and phenotypic characteristics. On the basis of these results, it is proposed that Flexibacter aggregans (Lewin 1969) Leadbetter 1974 be considered a later heterotypic synonym of Flexithrix dorotheae Lewin 1970. Emended descriptions of the species Flexithrix dorotheae and the genus Flexithrix are also given.
