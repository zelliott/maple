Stable and potent fibrinolytic enzymes (six homogeneous proteins) were purified to homogeneity from extracts of the lyophilized powder of an earthworm, Lumbricus rubellus. The molecular weight of each enzyme estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was different from those by gel filtration chromatography in the six purified proteins. The exact molecular weight of each enzyme (F-III-2, F-III-1, F-II, F-I-2, F-I-1, and F-I-0) measured by ion-spray MS analysis was 29,662, 29,667, 24,664, 24,220, 24,196, and 23,013, respectively. The isoelectric point (pI) of each enzyme was 3.40, 3.60, 4.20, 4.00, 4.30, and 4.85, respectively. The enzymes were single polypeptide chains. They had a very strong fibrinolytic activity and the maximum reactivity for chromogenic substrates from pH 9-11. The enzymes, acidic proteins that had abundant asparagine and aspartic acid, and low lysine in their amino acid composition, did not contain component sugars. The enzymes were stable at from pH 1-11 and up to 60 degrees C. Studies on substrate specificity and inhibition indicated that these enzymes were alkaline trypsin-like serine proteases. N-Terminal amino acid sequences of the enzymes had local similarities to those of trypsin-like enzymes such as elastase and coagulation factor IX. From the results of amino acid sequence, amino acid composition analyses and immunological analyses, it was suggested that these six enzyme proteins were derived as isozyme(s) from at least four different genes.
