We compared the effect of the rice storage protein glutelin B-1 (GluB-1) terminator with the nopaline synthase (Nos) terminator on the accumulation of the modified house dust mite allergen mDer f 2 driven by the maize ubiquitin promoter in transgenic rice. Accumulation of mDer f 2 in transgenic seed and leaf using the GluB-1 terminator was greater than when using the Nos terminator construct. The mDer f 2 mRNA containing the GluB-1 3'UTR was processed and polyadenylated at the same sites as the native GluB-1 mRNA in the seeds but diverged in leaves of the transgenic plants. In contrast, the poly(A) sites of mDer f 2 containing Nos 3'UTR were more divergent in both seed and leaf. These results suggest that GluB-1 3'UTR functions as a faithful terminator and that termination at the specific sites may play an important role in mRNA stability and/or translatability, resulting in higher levels of protein accumulation.
