The effect of human interleukin-4 (hIL-4) on mineralization in human osteoblast-like cells was investigated. Confluent cells were incubated with hIL-4 for 16 or 30 days in the presence or absence, respectively, of alpha-glycerophosphate (alpha-GP), which accelerates the mineralization process. hIL-4 (0.3 ng/ml) induced mineralization with 1.9-, 26- and 37-fold increases of hydroxyproline, calcium, and osteocalcin content, respectively, in the presence of alpha-GP. Mineralization was not induced with other cytokines, hIL-1, hIL-2, hIL-6, or mIL-4. hIL-4 also induced mineralization in the absence of alpha-GP in a manner different from that of 1 alpha, 25(OH)2 vitaminD3 (1,25(OH)2VD3). These findings suggest that IL-4 may play an important role in bone formation.
