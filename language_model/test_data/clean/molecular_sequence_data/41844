Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type 1 (ADCA1) is a clinical and genetic heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder which leads to progressive cerebellar ataxia. One defective gene responsible for the disease was first localised to 6p (SCA1, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1) and the mutation has been more recently characterised. We have analysed the CAG-repeat mutation responsible for the SCA1 phenotype in a large Spanish kindred with 41 affected members, in which positive linkage with D6S89 was previously shown. All (10) clinically affected members analysed were heterozygous with one disease allele being between 41 to 57 CAG repeats, and the other in the normal range, from 6 to 39 repeats. Nine clinically unaffected individuals who were between the ages of 18 and 40, were found to have expansions of the CAG repeat (41 to 59), and 22 other 'at risk' individuals were found to have inherited the SCA1 gene with copies of the CAG repeat in the normal range. We have also observed that affected fathers passed on the mutated SCA1 gene with larger increases in the number of CAG repeats than affected mothers did. In one case a decrease in the number of CAG repeats (51 to 50) was detected in the transmission from the affected mother, and in two cases no change was observed in the transmission of a 41 allele repeat by a mother. As in the other disorders in which knowledge of the mutation has been obtained, analysis of the repeat expansion dramatically changes diagnosis of SCA1.
