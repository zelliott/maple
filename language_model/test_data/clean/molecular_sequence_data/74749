A Gram-positive, motile, mesophilic bacterium that formed yellowish-white, circular, convex, glistening colonies, strain MSL-27T, was isolated from a soil sample from Bigeum Island, Korea, and its taxonomic position was investigated by a polyphasic approach. Cells of strain MSL-27T are non-spore-forming, irregular rods, usually fragmenting into shorter rods or coccoid elements. The growth temperature and pH ranges are 20-37 degrees C and pH 6.0-12.0, with optimum growth at 28 degrees C and pH 8.0. MK-11 is the major menaquinone and dl-2,4-diaminobutyric acid is found in the cell-wall peptidoglycan. The major fatty acids are i-C16:0 (39 %), ai-C15:0 (36 %), ai-C17:0 (18 %) and i-C15:0 (2 %). The G+C content is 69.0 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain MSL-27T should be placed in the genus Leifsonia. Levels of similarity between the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain MSL-27T and those of the type strains of the other members of the genus Leifsonia ranged from 95.8 to 96.7 %. Based on phenotypic characteristics, biochemical properties and chemotaxonomic features, strain MSL-27T (=KCTC 19268T =DSM 19322T) represents the type strain of a novel species of Leifsonia, for which the name Leifsonia bigeumensis sp. nov. is proposed.
