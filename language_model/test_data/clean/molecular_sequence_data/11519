As part of a systematic search for a major genetic locus for schizophrenia we have examined chromosome 22 using 14 highly polymorphic markers in 23 disease pedigrees. The markers were distributed at an average distance of 6.6 cM, covering 70-80% of the chromosome. We analyzed the data by the lod score method using five plausible genetic models ranging from dominant to recessive, after testing the power of our sample under the same genetic parameters. The most positive lod score found was 1.51 under a recessive model for the marker D22S278, which is insufficient to conclude linkage. However, an excess of shared alleles in affected siblings (P < .01) was found for both D22S278 and D22S283. For D22S278, the A statistic was equal to the lod score (1.51) and therefore did not provide additional evidence for linkage allowing for heterogeneity, but the Liang statistic was more significant (P = .002). Our results suggest the possibility that the region around D22S278 and D22S283 contains a gene which contributes to the aetiology of schizophrenia.
