We have performed haplotype analysis at the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) locus in order to investigate the molecular genetics of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) in Norway. Haplotypes were constructed using 7 restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in 194 subjects from 48 unrelated Norwegian FH families. Hypercholesterolemia co-segregated with haplotypes at the LDLR locus in all 48 families. Unambiguous haplotypes could be established for 190 independent chromosomes from 51 FH heterozygotes and 44 healthy normal subjects. A total of 20 different haplotypes was found. The most frequent haplotype was haplotype 3, which accounted for 32.4% or 43.1% of the normal and defective haplotypes, respectively. Haplotype 2 was significantly more frequent among the defective alleles than among the normal alleles (33.3% and 5.8%, respectively, p < 0.0001). Thus, haplotypes 2 and 3 accounted for 76.4% of the defective haplotypes. More data are needed to determine the possible existence of founder genes in the Norwegian population. Haplotypes 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 accounted for 88.2% of the normal haplotypes. Based upon the cumulative heterozygosity index, the SphI, NcoI and 3' ApaLI RFLPs are the most informative markers in the Norwegian population.
