The four members of the Fos gene family give rise to proteins that are part of the AP-1 transcription factor complex. When studying cAMP-induced apoptosis in a leukemia cell line from rat, we found that the Fra-2 gene (coding for the Fos-related antigen-2) became strongly upregulated as the leukemia cells started to die. It was therefore of interest to determine the cytogenetic localization of the human Fra-2 gene (FRA2), including a comparison to chromosomal aberrations observed in leukemia patients. Based on sequence information from the rat and chicken Fra-2 homologs, we were able to PCR-amplify a 4.5-kb genomic fragment covering exon 4 of FRA2. This fragment was employed as probe for both radioactive and fluorescence in situ hybridization to human metaphase chromosomes, allowing us to assign FRA2 to 2p22-p23. The localization of the gene to chromosome 2 was independently verified by PCR amplification of a FRA2-specific fragment from a panel of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids.
