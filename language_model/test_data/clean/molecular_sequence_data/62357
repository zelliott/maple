Polyclonal antibodies have been generated by immunization of rabbits with a chemically synthesized C-terminal part of divercin V41 (DvnCt) conjugated to the carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). The sensitivity and reactivity of the DvnCt-KLH-generated antibodies were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using supernatant from cultures of 13 representative lactic acid bacterium strains, and specificity was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Anti-DvnCt-KLH antibodies were able to recognize not only divercin V41 but also enterocin P and piscicocin V1b, two other members of the class IIa bacteriocins. Production and activity of DvnV41 were evaluated by ELISA and activity tests during the growth of Carnobacterium divergens V41 in MRS medium containing or not containing Tween 80. Divercin V41, enterocin P, and piscicocin V1b were therefore purified by a single-step immunoaffinity chromatography method using a Sepharose matrix CNBr-activated directed binding of anti-DvnCt-KLH polyclonal antibodies.
