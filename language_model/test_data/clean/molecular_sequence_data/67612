This study aims to compare the influence of different genes to the results of HIV-1 subtype B' phylogenetic analyses. We first split 47 near full-length genome sequences of subtype B' into different regions (gag, pol, vif, vpr, vpu, env, nef), which derived from various risk populations and geographic regions from Thailand, Myanmar and China from published studies. Phylogenetic analyses were performed to each region obtained. The phylogenetic results of different regions were compared to that of the near full-length genome sequences. The pol gene was found to have the lowest diversity and evolutionary rate, and could repeat the phylogenetic results by using near full-length genome sequences. Although the env gene has the highest diversity and evolutionary rate, it could not achieve the similar results. This study compared the influence to the results of HIV-1 subtype B' phylogenetic analyses by using different genes and laid foundation for further molecular survey and analyses of the transmission of subtype B' in China.
