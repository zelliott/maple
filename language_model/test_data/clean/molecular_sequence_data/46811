The rpoH gene encoding the heat-shock sigma factor of Pseudomonas putida was cloned by using its ability to complement the temperature-sensitive growth of the Escherichia coli rpoH mutant. The cloned DNA contained an open reading frame for a 284 amino acid sequence exhibiting high homology to the sigmaH proteins of P. aeruginosa and E. coli. Moreover, homologs to the cell division genes ftsX and ftsE were found immediately upstream of the rpoH gene.
