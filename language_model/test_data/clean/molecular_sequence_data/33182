A Gram-variable-staining, motile and coccoid-, ovoid- or rod-shaped bacterium, strain ISL-25(T), was isolated from a marine solar saltern of the Yellow Sea, Korea, and its taxonomic position was investigated by means of a polyphasic study. Strain ISL-25(T) grew optimally at pH 7.0-8.0 and 30-37 degrees C. Strain ISL-25(T) contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the cell-wall peptidoglycan, MK-7 as the predominant menaquinone and anteiso-C(15 : 0), anteiso-C(17 : 0) and iso-C(16 : 0) as the major fatty acids. The DNA G+C content was 49.3 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain ISL-25(T) belongs to the genus Salimicrobium. The similarity values between the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain ISL-25(T) and those of the type strains of the three currently recognized Salimicrobium species were 97.6-98.3 %. Mean DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain ISL-25(T) and the type strains of the genus Salimicrobium were 9-15 %. Differential phenotypic properties of strain ISL-25(T), together with the phylogenetic and genetic distinctiveness, revealed that this strain could be differentiated from other Salimicrobium species. Therefore, strain ISL-25(T) represents a novel species within the genus Salimicrobium, for which the name Salimicrobium flavidum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is ISL-25(T) (=KCTC 13260(T)=CCUG 56755(T)).
