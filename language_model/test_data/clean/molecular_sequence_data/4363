Vaccinations against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) has dramatically reduced the number of disease outbreaks. Nevertheless, there are still many outbreaks in different regions around the world. In an effort to find new ways to control the disease, ribozymes able to cleave FMDV were designed and tested. In this work we tested the ability of FRZ4, a ribozyme targeted to the viral polymerase gene, to cleave polymerase sequences of several FMDV. Homology analysis was used to choose target sequences which consist of two conserved GUC which lie 15 bases apart and, their flanking sequences. These were the basis for the FRZ4 ribozyme gene sequence that contains two catalytic domains. We show that polymerase sequences from A, Asia 1, C and two different O1 Israeli isolates could be specifically cleaved by FRZ4. It is suggested that FRZ4 can cleave polymerase gene sequences from any FMDV serotype.
