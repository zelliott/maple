Streptococcus suis is an emerging zoonotic pathogen causing severe infections in pigs and humans. Thirty-three serotypes of S. suis have been identified using serum agglutination. The capsular polysaccharides synthesis (cps) locus is usually conserved among different strains of the same serotype. The cps loci of 15 serotypes have been sequenced, while the loci of the other serotypes remain unknown. In the present study, two to six serotype-specific genes of each of eight serotypes, i.e., serotypes 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 19, 23, and 25, were identified using cross-hybridization with 93 nucleic acid probes specific to genes in the cps locus, and serotype-specific PCR assays for rapid and sensitive detection of the eight serotypes were then developed. The PCR typing results of the 148 serologically typeable isolates were completely consistent with agglutination results. Furthermore, some autoagglutinating, acapsular, and multiagglutinating strains which could not be differentiated by traditional serum agglutination assays were positive in the PCR assays. Use of the PCR assays with clinical tonsillar specimens showed that the assays are sensitive and able to identify samples with autoagglutinating isolates. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify the serotype-specific genes of the eight Streptococcus suis serotypes and develop rapid and sensitive PCR assays for the eight serotypes which can be identified only by serum agglutination.
