Molecular weights of heparin-derived oligosaccharides ranging from disaccharides to hexadecasaccharides have been determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. While these compounds ionize poorly or not at all when used as such, a strong signal can be obtained of their ionic complexes formed with a basic peptide or protein. The molecular weight of the sulfated oligosaccharide is determined by subtracting the mass of the basic component from that of the complex. Optimization of the experimental conditions resulted in sub-picomole sensitivity, in the elimination of sulfate loss and of the interference from attachment of inorganic cations. Synthetic peptides (Arg-Gly)10 and (Arg-Gly)15 were specifically designed as complexing agents for synthetic and natural heparin fragments up to decasaccharides. Accurate molecular weight determination on chemically homogeneous oligosaccharides (+/- 0.05%) unambiguously identified the number of saccharide units, and the number of O,N-sulfate and N-acetyl groups. For oligosaccharides larger than decasaccharides, a small basic protein, angiogenin (M(r) = 14,120), was used to form the complex (an inhomogeneous hexadecasaccharide fraction was the largest available for this study). For inhomogeneous samples larger than decasaccharides, the mass accuracy is lower (+/- 0.2-0.3%) but still suffices to determine the number of saccharide units present and to estimate the number of sulfate groups, except it is no longer possible to differentiate one sulfate from two N-acetyl groups (delta = 4 Da). However, taking into account known regularities of sulfation and acetylation, the specificity of heparin lyases and chemical degradation steps, the method promises to contribute significantly to the determination of the primary structure of heparin and other sulfated glycosaminoglycans.
