Epithelial cells lining the adult human colon do not normally express gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) or its receptor (GRPR), but both can be up regulated post malignant transformation. However, controversy exists as to the contribution these proteins make to tumor cell behavior once present. Since GRPR activation promotes proliferation, it has been assumed that their aberrant expression promotes colon cancer (CC) growth and progression. Yet we have contended that when expressed, GRP/GRPR benefits the host since in vitro studies demonstrate they enhance tumor cell attachment to the extracellular matrix and promote CC cytolysis by natural killer lymphocytes. Thus the aim of this study was to ascertain the effect of aberrant GRP/GRPR expression on patient survival. To do this we identified all CC diagnosed at a single institution from 1998 to 2002 that were classified as AJCC stage II or III (n = 88); of these 50 (57%) had sufficient tissues remaining for study. GRP/GRPR expression and natural killer cell density were determined immunohistochemically at the leading edge of each CC, and survival assessed by Kaplan Meier analysis. Expression of high levels of GRPR alone, or both GRP and GRPR, was associated with delayed CC recurrence (14.1-17.0 months, respectfully; P = 0.005) and increased survival (10.1-13.1 months, respectfully; P = 0.0124). CC expressing GRP/GRPR were associated with significantly fewer lymph node metastases than tumors not expressing these proteins, and contained significantly more CD16 + natural killer cells, than tumors not expressing these proteins. These findings demonstrate that patients whose CC express GRPR are associated with a survival advantage as compared to those whose CC do not express these proteins.
