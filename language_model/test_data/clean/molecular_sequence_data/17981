The complete nucleotide sequence of Citrus limon 26S rDNA has been determined. The sequence has been aligned with large ribosomal RNA (L-rRNA) sequences of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Oryza sativa. Nine extensive expansion segments in dicot 26S rRNA relative to E. coli 23S rRNA have been identified and compared with analogous segments of monocot, yeast, amphibian and human L-rRNAs. A secondary structure model for lemon 26S rRNA has been derived based on the refined model of E. coli 23S rRNA. It has been compared with other eukaryotic L-rRNAs models in terms of location of functionally important regions. Origin and evolution of L-rRNA expansion segments are discussed.
