Uptake of cadmium into cultured cells and its effects on cell growth and DNA synthesis are measured over a range of Cd concentrations of seven orders of magnitude. Cd uptake is found to be proportional to the external Cd concentration and to incubation time over a very broad range of concentrations. At least 200 mmol cadmium per kg dry weight of cells can be accumulated in this way, leading to exhaustion of the major intracellular Cd binding sites before cell death. On the other hand, very low cadmium concentrations down to 100 pM stimulate cell growth and DNA synthesis significantly. Stimulation is found in all three mammalian cell types examined: namely L6J1, a rat permanent myoblast cell line, LLC-PK1 porcine renal epithelial cells, and a primary rat chondrocyte culture. Cd acts as a cofactor with serum in L6J1 cultures, but is stimulatory only in serum-free cultures of chondrocytes. Stimulation occurs at Cd concentrations too low to result in a measurable induction of metallothionein. This might implicate the action of response amplifiers in the chain of events leading to Cd-stimulated DNA replication and cell growth.
