We clarified the evolutionary position of Candida maltosa, an n-alkane-assimilating yeast, by sequencing the nucleotides of the small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene. Phylogenetic analyses showed the close evolutionary relationships of C. maltosa with C. tropicalis, C. viswanathii, C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. guilliermondii, forming a sub-group within this genus.
