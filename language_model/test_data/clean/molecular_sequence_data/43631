Certain receptors belonging to the LDL receptor (LDLR) gene family appear to constitute a newly identified branch whose members are expressed in brain, in addition to other tissues. In support of this concept, we have now discovered the expression and delineated the molecular structures of a representative of this emerging branch from two such diverse species as human and chicken. This membrane receptor, called LR11 and thus far only known to exist in the rabbit, is a complex seven-domain mosaic protein containing, among other structural elements, a cluster of 11 LDLR ligand-binding repeats and a domain with homology to VPS10, a yeast receptor for vacuolar protein sorting. Cytoplasmic signature sequences define the receptor as competent for endocytosis. The most striking properties of LR11s are their (1) high degree of structural conservation (>80% identity among mammals and birds), with 100% identity in the membrane-spanning and cytoplasmic domains of rabbit and human; (2) lack of regulation by cholesterol and estrogen; and (3) expression in brain. The features of LR11 suggest important roles in intercellular and intracellular ligand transport processes, some of which it may share with other brain-specific LDLR family members.
