Virtually all cell surface proteins and many cell membrane lipids are glycosylated, creating a cell surface glycocalyx. The glycan chains attached to cell surface glycoproteins and glycolipids are complex structures with specific additions that determine functions of the glycans in cell-cell communication and cell sensing of the environment. One type of specific modification of cell surface glycans is decoration of glycan termini by sialic acids. On T cells, these terminal sialic acid residues are involved in almost every aspect of T cell fate and function, from cell maturation, differentiation, and migration to cell survival and cell death. The roles that sialylated glycans play in T cell development and function, including binding to specific sialic acid-binding lectins, are reviewed here.
