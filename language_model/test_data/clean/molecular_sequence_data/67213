RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process that changes individual nucleotides in transcripts, and usually occurs in the plastids of land plants. The number of RNA editing sites in a plastid is significantly divergent in bryophytes, ranging from zero in liverworts to almost 1,000 sites in hornworts. In this study, we identified 132 RNA editing sites in the transcripts of six genes from the psbB operon and the rpoA of the moss Takakia lepidozioides. This is the highest number of RNA editing sites known in this region among land plant species. All were cytidine-to-uridine conversions. More than 91% of RNA editing occurred at the first or second codon positions, and it altered amino acid identity. Six editing sites created new translation initiation codons or stop codons. Thirty-two sites were commonly observed in the hornwort Anthoceros angustus. This finding suggests that the enigmatic bryophyte Takakia is closely related to hornworts with respect to RNA editing events.
