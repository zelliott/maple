Digestive alpha-amylases play an essential role in insect carbohydrate metabolism. These enzymes belong to an endo-type group. They catalyse starch hydrolysis, and are involved in energy production. Larvae of Zabrotes subfasciatus, the Mexican bean weevil, are able to infest stored common beans Phaseolus vulgaris, causing severe crop losses in Latin America and Africa. Their alpha-amylase (ZSA) is a well-studied but not completely understood enzyme, having specific characteristics when compared to other insect alpha-amylases. This report provides more knowledge about its chemical nature, including a description of its optimum pH (6.0 to 7.0) and temperature (20-30 degrees C). Furthermore, ion effects on ZSA activity were also determined, showing that three divalent ions (Mn2+, Ca2+, and Ba2+) were able to enhance starch hydrolysis. Fe2+ appeared to decrease alpha-amylase activity by half. ZSA kinetic parameters were also determined and compared to other insect alpha-amylases. A three-dimensional model is proposed in order to indicate probable residues involved in catalysis (Asp204, Glu240, and Asp305) as well other important residues related to starch binding (His118, Ala206, Lys207, and His304).
