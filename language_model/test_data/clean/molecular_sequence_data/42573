Several sialylated and fucosylated oligosaccharides, based upon the N-acetyllactosaminyl core structure, have been synthesized from a single trisaccharide glycoside, beta-D-GlcNAc-(1-->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1-->4)-beta-D-GlcNAc-OCH2(CH2)++ +7CO2CH3, by the sequential use of several glycosyltransferases and one sialidase. In these chemoenzymic syntheses, selective internal monofucosylation of a dimeric N-acetyl-lactosaminyl tetrasaccharide is achieved via two routes. It is demonstrated that the pentasaccharide beta-D-Gal-(1-->4)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1-->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1-->4)-[alpha- L-Fuc-(1-->3)]-beta-D-GlcNAc-OCH2(CH2)7-CO2CH3 is an acceptor for the rat liver beta-D-Gal-(1-->3/4)-D-Glc-NAc alpha 2,3- and beta-D-Gal-(1-->4)-D-GlcNAc alpha 2,6-sialyltransferases. Among the structures obtained is the terminal hexasaccharide of the CD-65/VIM-2 epitope.
