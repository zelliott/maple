When comparing two subsequent stages of melanocytic tumor progression we identified calcyclin as a new potential progression marker, the expression of which was correlated with metastatic behavior of various human melanoma cell lines in nude mice. In this study, we describe a good correlation between RNA and protein levels in the xenografts of these cell lines and extended these experiments to a panel of 120 routinely processed human melanocytic cutaneous lesions. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that calcyclin RNA expression was elevated in melanoma metastases as compared to several types of nevocellular nevi. Calcyclin staining using a specific polyclonal antiserum showed a more complex pattern. A stronger staining in a higher percentage of positive cells was observed in thick primary melanoma (> or = 1.5 mm) as compared to thin primary melanoma (< 1.5 mm). Calcyclin expression was also present in a higher percentage of cells showing a stronger staining in melanomas with higher Clark levels (> II) corresponding to the vertical growth phase of primary melanomas. Protein expression in nevocellular nevi was confined to the dermal part and was highest in the lower parts of the dermis. Remarkably, dysplastic nevi (atypical moles), potential precursors of melanoma, did not show any expression at all, either in junctional or dermal parts. Confinement of the expression to the dermal part of nondysplastic nevi and primary melanomas may reflect interactions with the microenvironment of the reticular dermis that occurs with vertical growth.
