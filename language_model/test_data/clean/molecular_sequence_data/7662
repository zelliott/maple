We report a highly polymorphic, sequence-tagged microsatellite site (STMS) at the D5S99 locus that was previously identified by a less informative restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). This marker, which was also localized to the physical map of chromosome 5q by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), should assist in the precision mapping of genes in the area 5q33-34.
