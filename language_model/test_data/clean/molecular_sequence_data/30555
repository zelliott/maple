A cDNA library was prepared from mRNA isolated from the lepidopteran Trichoplusia ni during larval-pupal metamorphosis. Differential probing was used to identify clones for mRNAs which are suppressible by exogenous juvenile hormone treatment. In vitro transcribed cRNAs from these clones were translated in vitro and challenged with antiserum specific for a known acidic, juvenile hormone-suppressible hemolymph protein (AJSP-1) that is associated with larval metamorphosis. Three clones were found which encoded immunoreactive translation products; their identity was confirmed by comparison of the N-terminal sequence of the mature AJSP-1 protein with the cDNA sequence. As inferred from the cDNA sequence, the protein encompasses 704 amino acid residues, including a N-terminal signal peptide; widely distributed as well as more localized stronger sequence similarities indicate that the protein is distantly related to hemocyanins and hemocyanin-like insect proteins. However, on the basis of amino acid sequence and composition, immunological reactivity, and hormonal sensitivity, the protein is distinct from previously described insect proteins. Its juvenile hormone suppressibility can be ascribed to suppression of the mRNA. RNA blot analysis using the cloned cDNA as a probe demonstrated that the transcript (approximately 2.8 kilobases) is of very low abundance during the penultimate stadium but becomes very abundant during the last larval stadium, when juvenile hormone rapidly declines. Furthermore, treatment of larvae with a juvenile hormone analog strongly suppresses the abundance of the message.
