Based on the hypothesis that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) sG protein causes allergy in patients, it is suggested that treatment of RSV patients with antagonists of IL-4 and FKN early in infection will prevent the increased level of IL-4 in the serum. Together with CpG ODNs that induce Toll-like receptor 9(+) (TLR9(+)) plasmacytoid dendritic cells to release type I IFN-alpha and -beta will reactivate the inhibited Th1 cells and the antiviral cytotoxic T leukocytes. In addition, binding of CpG ODNs to TLR9(+) B cells will stop IgE synthesis and antiviral IgG and IgA will continue. Together, the IL-4 and FKN antagonists and CpG ODNs reactivate the adaptive immune response to clear the virus and protect the patient from a second RSV infection. It is also suggested that the less-pathogenic RSV strain Long may be a candidate for vaccine development after deletion of the FKN and superantigen domains from the G gene.
