Biochemical interactions between the pollen and the pistil allow plants fine control over fertilization. S-RNase-based pollen rejection is among the most widespread and best understood of these interactions. At least three plant families have S-RNase-based self-incompatibility (SI) systems, and S-RNases have also been implicated in interspecific pollen rejection. Although S-RNases determine the specificity of SI, other genes are required for the pollen rejection system to function. Progress is being made toward identifying these non-S-RNase factors. HT-protein, first identified as a non-S-RNase factor that was required for SI in Nicotiana alata, has now been implicated in other species as well. In addition, several pistil proteins bind to S-RNase in vitro. One hypothesis is that S-RNase forms a complex with these proteins in vivo that is the active form of S-RNase in pollen rejection.
