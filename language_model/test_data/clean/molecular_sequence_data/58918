The heat shock response is a universal and highly conserved cellular response to stress. We describe here the effect of elevated temperature on the capacity of B cells to present antigen. Heat shock markedly affects the ability of these cells to process and present tetanus toxin to class II-restricted T cell clones. Inhibition of antigen presentation is due neither to a modification of antigen capture nor to a variation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule synthesis and cell surface expression. Stressed and nonstressed B cells are able to present peptides loaded at the cell surface with the same efficiency. Nevertheless, heat shock leads to an increase of antigen peptide generation in subcellular compartments; an enhancement of cathepsin B activity is also observed. These data suggest that such a stress induces a failure in the intracellular peptide loading onto MHC class II molecules.
