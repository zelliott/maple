Previous analysis of the microbiology of advanced caries by culture and real-time PCR emphasized the high incidence and abundance of gram-negative anaerobic species, particularly Prevotella-like bacteria. The diversity of Prevotella-like bacteria was further explored by analyzing pooled bacterial DNA from lesions of carious dentine. This was achieved by amplification of a region of the 16S ribosomal DNA with a Prevotella genus-specific forward primer and a universal bacterial reverse primer, followed by cloning and sequencing. Cultured Prevotella species commonly associated with oral tissues constituted only 12% of the Prevotella clones isolated from advanced carious lesions. The remaining 88% consisted of a diverse range of phylotypes. These included five clusters of previously recognized but uncultured oral Prevotella spp. and a major cluster containing Prevotella-like bacteria most closely related to uncharacterized rumen bacteria. Cluster-specific primers were designed, and the numbers of bacteria within clusters were quantified by real-time PCR, confirming the abundance of these organisms. The data indicated that advanced dental caries provides a unique environment for a complex array of novel and uncultured Prevotella and Prevotella-like bacteria which, in some cases, may dominate the diverse polymicrobial community associated with the disease.
