While conventional calpains, m- and mu-calpains named according to their calcium-dependence, are expressed in almost every tissues, mRNA of newly identified p94, which has a significant sequence similarity to the conventional calpain large subunits, is abundantly expressed only in skeletal muscle. In addition to this specific expression, p94 is distinct from conventional calpains in that it contains three unique regions showing no similarity to conventional calpain subunits. When rat and human p94 are compared, overall sequence similarity is 94.0%, which is close to those for m- and mu-calpain large subunits; 93.1% and 95.4% between human and rabbit, respectively, suggesting the evolutionary importance of p94. These calpain large subunit proteins, p94, m- and mu-types, can be considered to constitute a super family, whose p94, m- and mu-types represent the three major types. Sequences of the calpain large-subunit family members, including the recently reported Schistosoma calpain, are compared. Their evolutionary correlation and function are discussed on the basis of the results thus far obtained.
