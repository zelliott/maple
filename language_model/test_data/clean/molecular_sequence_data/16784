A phylogenetic tree of aquabirnaviruses, including marine birnaviruses (MABV) and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), was developed based on the nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences of the polyprotein and VP5 genes of genomic segment A. In the polyprotein of MABV strains, the amino acid sequences were very similar, with identities of 98.3-99.7%. Twenty-one unique amino acid residues were found in the deduced amino acid sequences of the polyprotein gene of MABV strains. The phylogenetic tree based on the nucleotide sequence of genomic segment A and polyprotein sequences showed that 31 aquabirnavirus strains were clustered into seven genogroups. All MABV strains isolated in Japan and Korea were clustered into one genogroup which was distinct from other aquabirnaviruses. The seventh genogroup containing all MABV strains showed amino acid sequence similarities of 80.7-90.6% with other genogroups. In VP5, four unique residues were found in MABV strains when compared with IPNV strains. The MABV strains exhibited amino acid sequence similarities of 63.9-86.4% with IPNV strains. The amino acid sequences of VP5 were conserved among MABV strains, but differed from those of IPNV strains. The MABV strains isolated from different host species and different geographical areas were very similar to each other, suggesting that the MABV are distinct from the other genogroups.
