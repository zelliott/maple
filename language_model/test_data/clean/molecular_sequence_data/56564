Chemical investigation of the EtOH-soluble portion of Symphytum officinale roots has resulted in the isolation of a new pentacyclic triterpene glycoside of oleanolic acid. Its structure was elucidated by spectroscopic studies, including 2D nmr, and chemical evidences as 3-O-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->4)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->4)-alpha-L -arabinopyranosyl]-oleanolic acid [1].
