Though antibodies against HIV-1 appearing in the course of infection are successfully used for the diagnostic purposes, their accumulation on the earlier step leads to: firstly, to the rapid generation of the immunodeficiency by different mechanisms and secondly, to inefficiency of immunotherapy. One of the causes for immunodeficiency seems to be antibodies which are induced in the HIV-infected person by the HIV peptides homologous to the MHC class II molecules by their amino acid sequences. 73% of HIV-1 positive sera are shown to react with human B-lymphoma cells expressing surface class II molecule. The binding is caused by the antibodies preventing the murine monoclonal anti-HLA.DR Ab interaction with B-lymphoma. Three amino acid sequences are identified in both alpha- and beta-chain of the HLA.DR antigen, these sequences being homologous to HIV-1 gp120 or gp42 molecules for 50 to 70%. Using synthetic peptides it was shown that HIV-1-infected persons contain antibodies which cross-react to the homologous peptides of the HIV-1 and of the MHC class II. It is supposed that such antibodies shield the class II molecule on the surface of their own antigen-presenting cell which may lead to immunodeficiency caused by the anti-HIV-1 antibody.
