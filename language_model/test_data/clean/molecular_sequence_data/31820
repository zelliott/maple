The senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) strain exhibits age-related learning and memory deficits (LMD) at 2 months of age. Combined linkage analysis of 264 F2 intercross SAMP8 Ã— JF1 mice and RNA-seq analysis identified Hcn1 gene out of 29 genes in the LMD region on chromosome 13. Hcn1 in SAMP8 strain showed 15 times less polyglutamine repetition compared to Japanese fancy mouse 1 (JF1). Whole cell patch clamp analysis showed that Hcn1 ion conductivity was significantly lower in SAMP8 compared to that of JF1, which may be associated with learning and memory deficiency.
