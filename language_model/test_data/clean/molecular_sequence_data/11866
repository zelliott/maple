Virtually all cells respond to heat stress by increased expression or induction of one or more of the highly conserved cellular stress response proteins, heat shock proteins (HSPs). Here, we report the unusual property of rat Nb2-11 cells, a prolactin-dependent pre-T-cell line, to display reduced HSP expression following exposure to elevated temperature. After heat stress (41 degrees C, 1 h), there was no evidence of inducible members of the 70 kDa HSP family, a response common to other cell culture and tissue systems. Moreover, expression of constitutive members of the HSP70 and HSP90 families decreased during the heat stress, apparently reflecting a decrease in mRNA stability. Gel shift assays revealed that heat shock factor (HSF) was activated in spite of the lack of expression of inducible HSP70 transcripts, although its DNA binding rapidly deteriorated. Immunoblotting, using an antibody specific to HSF1, indicated that proteolysis of HSF1 may be responsible for this rapid termination of heat shock element binding. CCAAT binding, a component of constitutive HSP70 expression, was also reduced by heat stress in Nb2-11 cells and may account for the decline in constitutive HSP70 expression. Prolactin pretreatment prevented the fragmentation of HSF1, protected heat shock element and CCAAT binding, prevented the decline in constitutive HSP70 and HSP90 expression, and restored a modest expression of inducible HSP70 following heat treatment. Results of this study describe a unique regulatory defect in HSP expression in Nb2-11 cells, possibly a common characteristic of other hormone-dependent tumors.
