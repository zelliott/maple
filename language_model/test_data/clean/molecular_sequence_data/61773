Gene therapy still awaits a broader application, since safe and efficient gene delivery is a major problem. Also for the investigation of signal transduction and intracellular trafficking, delivery systems for hydrophilic macromolecules that are easy to use are needed. Several peptide-based delivery systems have been developed during the last years. We present here a novel carrier peptide derived from human calcitonin that is capable of transfecting human neuroblastoma cells by complex formation with a plasmid. Because of the peptide's physiological origin, cytotoxic effects are not expected.
