We have localized 38 human brain cDNA sequences to individual human chromosomes. PCR primers were designed from expressed sequence tags and tested for specific amplification from human genomic DNA. The sizes of amplification products from DNA of somatic cell hybrid mapping panels were determined electrophoretically using an automated fluorescence detection system. Chromosomal assignments were made by discordancy analysis.
