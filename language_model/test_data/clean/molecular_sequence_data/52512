Although lactoferrin is known as a basic soluble glycoprotein, the presence of the membrane-bound form of this protein has also been demonstrated in human milk. Membrane-bound lactoferrin was extracted from the human milk fat globule membrane with a detergent mixture of 1% Tween-20, 0.5% C12E8, and 0.5 M KCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Lactoferrin in the detergent-soluble fraction was purified by affinity chromatography with Concanavalin A and by hydrophobic chromatography with phenyl-Superose. The purified protein gave a single band of 80 kDa by SDS-PAGE. Its N-terminal amino acid sequence was consistent with that of human lactoferrin.
