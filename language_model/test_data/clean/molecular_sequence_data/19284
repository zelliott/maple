The structure of a new monomeric peptidoglycan-related compound with hypotensive and diuretic activities, cymbidine A (1) isolated from the orchid Cymbidium goeringii, was elucidated mainly by spectroscopic analysis. The structure of 1 was shown to involve four amino acids (D-alanin, meso-diaminopimelic acid, D-gultamic acid, and L-valine) and two amino sugars (N-acetylglucosamine and 1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid). The sequence of the amino acids and amino sugars was determined by the analysis of 2D NMR data. The absolute stereochemistries of the three amino acids (D-Ala, D-Glu and L-Val) were determined by the modified Marfey's method, and the (6S,10R) configurations of meso-diaminopimelic acid in 1 were indicated on the basis of the CD analysis. The absolute stereochemistry of 1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid was also determined by CD data.
