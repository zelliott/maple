Two novel violet-pigmented, Gram-negative, rod-shaped, non-motile bacteria, designated strains M4-16(T) and M4-9, were isolated from sediment from an Arctic glacier. The predominant fatty acids of both strains were C16 : 1ω7c and/or C16 : 1ω6c (summed feature 3), C16 : 0, C14 : 0 and C18 : 1ω7c and/or C18 : 1ω6c (summed feature 8) and both strains contained ubiquinone-8 as the respiratory quinone. The polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified phospholipids and one unidentified aminolipid. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strains M4-16(T) and M4-9 were members of the genus Iodobacter and closely related to Iodobacter fluviatilis ATCC 33051(T) with pairwise sequence similarity of 98.9 %. The DNA-DNA relatedness between strains M4-9 and M4-16(T) was 92.5 %, while strains M4-9 and M4-16(T) had DNA-DNA relatedness values of 21.5 and 18.2 %, respectively, with Iodobacter fluviatilis JCM 9044(T). The RAPD-PCR banding patterns of strains M4-9 and M4-16(T) were similar but differed from that of Iodobacter fluviatilis JCM 9044(T). Based on data from the current polyphasic study, strains M4-16(T) and M4-9 represent a novel species of the genus Iodobacter, for which the name Iodobacter arcticus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Iodobacter arcticus is M4-16(T) ( = CIP 1103011(T) = MTCC 11351(T)).
