Since the identification of the HIV virus, important advances have been achieved in the definition of potential subunit vaccines. We investigated the immunogenicity of a recombinant gp160 antigen and of two gp41 peptides from HIV-1LAI associated with seven different adjuvant formulations in squirrel monkeys. All animals were immunized twice with gp160 and then with a gp41 peptide using the same formulation. All adjuvants used led to a subsequent antibody response against gp160, and 55% of the animals immunized developed anti-gp160 antibodies that could neutralize the virus in vitro. Specific anti-gp41 antibody response was also observed. Results obtained underlined the key role of the adjuvant formulation in the antibody response against a given part of the immunogen, and indicate that such immunogenicity-related investigation can be carried out conveniently in the squirrel monkey Saimiri sciureus.
