Varicella-zoster virus strains of European genotypes have developed a high variability of open reading frame (ORF) 62 during their occurrence over many years in Germany. M1 strains in Germany display a uniform ORF 62 pattern, suggesting that these strains were introduced from Africa and/or Asia via few sources during the last years.
