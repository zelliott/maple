Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Despite tremendous efforts to diagnose and institute new treatment regimens, the prognosis is still extremely poor. Therefore, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms governing the initiation, maintenance and progression of HCC is urgently needed. Recently, several groups have attributed an important role for c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) in the pathogenesis of human HCC and its close association with the expression of HCC signature genes. In this review the various associations between JNK1 and HCC are discussed with the hope that targeting this pivotal kinase may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for this fatal disease.
