Tumor necrosis factor alpha and beta (TNF-alpha and TNF-beta) bind surface receptors on a variety of cell types to mediate a wide range of immunological responses, inflammatory reactions, and anti-tumor effects. A cDNA clone encoding an integral membrane protein of 461 amino acids was isolated from a human lung fibroblast library by direct expression screening with radiolabeled TNF-alpha. The encoded receptor was also able to bind TNF-beta. The predicted cysteine-rich extracellular domain has extensive sequence similarity with five proteins, including nerve growth factor receptor and a transcriptionally active open reading frame from Shope fibroma virus, and thus defines a family of receptors.
