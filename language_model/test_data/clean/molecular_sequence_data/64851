Within a mixture of proteins, minor polymorphic components are difficult to identify using a conventional proteomic approach. Their identification generally requires multi-dimensional separation steps, before or after proteolytic cleavage, followed by sequence analysis of the proteolytic products. In this study, we investigated the potential of tandem mass spectrometry for protein characterization by identifying the delta-beta hybrid human hemoglobin variant Lepore-Boston-Washington using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Hemoglobin Lepore-Boston-Washington occurs mainly in heterozygotes, where it comprises approximately 10% of the total non-alpha-chains, the dominant non-alpha-chain being the normal beta (approximately 90%). Furthermore, Hemoglobin Lepore-Boston-Washington has an average molecular mass (15,865.23 Da) that is only 2 Da lower than that of the normal beta-chain (15,867.24 Da). Consequently, it cannot be resolved from the normal beta-chain by mass spectrometry. Here we show how Hemoglobin Lepore-Boston-Washington was identified directly from the diluted blood of a heterozygote by analyzing the product ions from the Lepore-Boston-Washington and normal beta-chain ions without prior separation of the individual chains. This study shows the potential of the tandem mass spectrometry for identifying a minor component in an unseparated mixture of proteins.
