The adenovirus precursor to the terminal protein (pTP), expressed in a vaccinia virus expression system or in native adenovirus, was assayed for its ability to interact with the nuclear matrix. Biochemical function was measured by determining the relative amount of pTP protein or of adenovirus DNA that remained associated with the nuclear matrix after extensive washing. pTP was retained on the matrix whereas beta-galactosidase was not, as assayed by quantitative immunoblot analysis. Nuclear matrix isolated from adenovirus-infected HeLa cells retained bound adenovirus DNA even when washed with 1 M guanidine hydrochloride; this interaction could be inhibited by added purified pTP protein. Analogous experiments with matrix isolated from HeLa cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus that expressed pTP showed a similar retention of pTP protein; this association could also be inhibited by added pTP protein. Binding of pTP to nuclear matrix isolated from uninfected cells was saturable, with an apparent Kd of 250 nM and an estimated 2.8 x 10(6) sites for pTP binding per cell nucleus. The association of pTP with matrix is postulated to help direct adenovirus replication complexes to the appropriate locale within the nucleus.
