A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for the detection of the glmM gene, selected as Helicobacter pylori target sequence, was improved. While performing pathogenicity island cagA gene detection to discriminate pathogenic strains in atherosclerotic carotid samples, several cagA-positive but glmM-negative samples were found. Polymorphisms present in the region amplified in the nested PCR reaction could explain this result; primers were therefore designed to perform a seminested reaction; this modification optimized sensitivity while maintaining specificity. A real-time PCR for Helicobacter DNA detection was also setup. The combination of all 4 PCR reactions detected 83% of H. pylori DNA-positive samples in atherosclerotic carotid tissue, 64% of which were cagA gene positive.
