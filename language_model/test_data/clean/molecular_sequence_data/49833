This study uses multiple enzyme digests to increase the sequence coverage of proteins identified by the shotgun sequencing approach to proteomic analysis. The enzymes used were trypsin, Lys-C, and Asp-N, which cleave at arginine and lysine residues, lysine, and aspartic acid residues, respectively. This approach was evaluated with the glycoprotein, tissue plasminogen activator, t-PA and gave enhanced sequence coverage, compared with a single enzymatic digest. The approach was then evaluated with a complex proteomic sample, namely plasma. It was found that trypsin and Lys-C were able to detect overlapping but distinct sets of proteins and a digital recombination of the data gave a significant increase in both the number of protein identifications as well as an increase in the number of peptides identified per protein (which improves the certainty of the assignment).
