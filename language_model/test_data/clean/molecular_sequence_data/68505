In cytochrome c oxidase the C-terminal part of subunit II is outside the membrane and contains a copper center called CuA. We have expressed this domain of the Paracoccus denitrificans oxidase in a soluble form. Data obtained by quantitative copper-to-protein measurements, electrospray mass spectrometry, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy show that the center contains two copper atoms probably in a mixed valence configuration. Its absorbance spectrum is similar to that of the copper center A in nitrous oxide reductase. The EPR spectrum suggests that the center in the soluble protein is closely related to the native CuA site in the cytochrome oxidase complex. However, it seems likely that the copper center in the soluble domain is more exposed to the aqueous milieu than in the intact complex because its absorbance and EPR spectra are sensitive to pH. At alkaline pH one of the coppers in the site acquires type-2 character, indicating that it may be coordinated to a new ligand. The pK of this reversible change is about 8.2. The CuA-binding fragment is able to oxidize cytochrome c.
