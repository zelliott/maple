The mechanism that regulates the plasticity of bone marrow cells (BMCs) into hepatocytes is poorly understood. We developed a green fluorescent protein/carbon tetrachloride model to find that BMC transplantation recovered liver damage. Serum albumin level and liver fibrosis were recovered by BMC transplantation. To understand the mechanism, we used DNA-chip technology to profile the change of transient gene expression before and after BMC transplantation. On the basis of gene expression with self-organizing map using specific equation, genes were classified into 153 clusters. The information is useful to understand the dramatic gene activation during the process of the plasticity of BMC.
