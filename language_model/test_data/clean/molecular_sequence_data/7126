The turnover of a CNS-specific cell adhesion glycoprotein, ependymin, has earlier been found to increase during periods of neuronal plasticity. Here, ependymin mRNA expression was analyzed by semiquantitative in situ hybridization in goldfish. Learning of an active avoidance response resulted in a significant increase in ependymin mRNA expression 20 min to 4 h after acquisition of the task. In contrast, yoked control animals that were exposed to the same numbers of conditioned and unconditioned stimuli in a random, unpaired manner exhibited a strong down-regulation of ependymin mRNA. Hybridization signals were also increased by injection of anti-ependymin antiserum into brain ventricles. Ependymin mRNA was exclusively localized to reticular-shaped fibroblasts of the inner endomeningeal cell layer. Immunoelectron microscopic investigation, however, revealed ependymin also in distinct neuronal and glial cell populations in which no ependymin mRNA had been detected. Uptake of meningeal protein factors into glial and neuronal cells may therefore be of functional importance for plastic adaptations of the CNS.
