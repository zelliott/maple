Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the Rd1P- mutant strain R7 of Salmonella minnesota were serologically characterized using R7 LPS, dephosphorylated LPS, deacylated LPS, deacylated, dephosphorylated and reduced LPS, and synthetic partial structures. The latter comprised partial structures of the core region of Rd1P- LPS bound to the beta 1-->6-linked glucosamine dissacharide with two amide-linked 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid residues or artificial glycoconjugates comprised of the synthetic oligosaccharides coupled to bovine serum albumin. Using a passive hemolysis and an enzyme immunoassay, absorption and inhibition experiments, the antibody specificites present could be determined. One group of antibodies required components of the core region and the phosphorylated glucosamine disaccharide of the lipid A moiety for binding. The majority of phosphate-independent antibodies was directed against the trisaccharide L-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptopyranose(1-->3)- L-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptopyranose(1-->5)3-deoxy-D-manno-oct ulo sonic acid. Antibodies against the 1-->3- and 1-->7-linked heptose disaccharides and against a single heptose were also detected, however, with low titers. No antibodies were found which required the presence of fatty acids.
