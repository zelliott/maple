We transformed haploid mycelium of Hebeloma cylindrosporum via Agrobacterium tumefaciens and optimised the procedure to develop a new tool for insertional mutagenesis in this fungus. Southern blot analysis of 83 randomly selected transformants showed that they all contained plasmid inserts. Each of them showed a unique hybridisation pattern, suggesting that integration was random in the fungal genome. Sixty percent of transformants obtained in the presence of bacteria pre-treated with acetosyringone integrated a single transferred DNA copy. Thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction allowed us to recover the left border and the right border junctions in 85% and 15% of transformants analysed, respectively. Results show that A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation may be a powerful tool for insertional mutagenesis in H. cylindrosporum.
