Clinical, epidemiological and experimental data indicate that inhaled metal dust containing cobalt may produce an interstitial lung disease termed "hard metal disease" (HMD). Some aspects of this pathology such as the lack of correlation with dose exposure, the low frequency of the disease and the presence of T cells in the inflammation site, all suggest the existence of a genetic susceptibility, possibly to an immunological response to cobalt or to self proteins modified by cobalt. Here we report that HMD is strongly associated with residue Glu-69 of the HLA-DP beta chain. All patients, except for one with a rare genotype, possessed this marker as compared to 17 out of 35 exposed unaffected individuals (p = 0.0014). These data allow us to genetically distinguish a subgroup of cobalt-exposed individuals at risk for HMD, independently from the more common allergic reaction.
