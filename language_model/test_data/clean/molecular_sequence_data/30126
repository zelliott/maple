The dynamics of three synthetic oligonucleotides d(CG)4, d(CG)6, and d(CGCGTTGTTCGCG) of different length and shape were studied in solution by depolarized dynamic light scattering (DDLS) and time-resolved nuclear Overhauser effect cross-relaxation measurements. For cylindrically symmetric molecules the DDLS spectrum is dominated by the rotation of the main symmetry axis of the cylinder. The experimental correlation times describe the rotation of the oligonucleotides under hydrodynamic stick boundary conditions. It is shown that the hydrodynamic theory of Tirado and Garcia de la Torre gives good predictions of the rotational diffusion coefficients of cylindrically symmetric molecules of the small axial ratios studied here. These relations are used to calculate the solution dimensions of the DNA fragments from measured correlation times. The hydrodynamic diameter of the octamer and dodecamer is 20.5 +/- 1.0 A, assuming a rise per base of 3.4 A. The tridecamer, d(CGCGTTGTTCGCG), adopts a hairpin structure with nearly spherical dimensions and a diameter of 23.0 +/- 2.0 A. The DDLS relaxation measurements provide a powerful method for distinguishing between different conformations of the oligonucleotides (e.g., DNA double-helix versus hairpin structure). Furthermore, the rotational correlation times are a very sensitive probe of the length of different fragments. The NMR results reflect the anisotropic motion of the molecules as well as the amount of local internal motion present. The experimental correlation time from NMR is determined by the rotation of both the short and long axes of the oligonucleotide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
