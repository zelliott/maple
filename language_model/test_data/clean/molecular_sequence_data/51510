The DNA binding activity of p53 is required for its tumor suppressor function; we show here that this activity is cryptic but can be activated by cellular factors acting on a C-terminal regulatory domain of p53. A gel mobility shift assay demonstrated that recombinant wild-type human p53 binds DNA sequence specifically only weakly, but a monoclonal antibody binding near the C terminus activated the cryptic DNA binding activity stoichiometrically. p53 DNA binding could be activated by a C-terminal deletion of p53, mild proteolysis of full-length p53, E. coli dnaK (which disrupts protein-protein complexes), or casein kinase II (and coincident phosphorylation of a C-terminal site on p53). Activation of p53 DNA binding may be critical in regulation of its ability to arrest cell growth and thus its tumor suppressor function.
