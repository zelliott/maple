To determine whether mutations in the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 DR) gene are associated with schizophrenia, the coding sequence was examined in 106 Caucasian, 11 African-American, 8 Asian, and 6 Native American patients. Approximately 350 kb of genomic sequence was screened by dideoxy fingerprinting, a method related to single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis that detects virtually 100% of sequence changes [Sarkar et al., 1992: Genomics 13:441-443; Liu and Sommer, 1994: PCR Methods and Applications 4:97-108]. One polymorphism was identified in Asians and one in Caucasians, but neither altered the amino acid sequence (Leu66, and Ser421, respectively). In addition, a previously reported polymorphism in the 5' untranslated region of exon 2 at bp -48 was found to be common, with an allele frequency of approximately 40% in Caucasians of Western European descent. Based on the fact that no sequence changes of likely functional significance were identified, these data suggest that mutations affecting the structure of the D1 dopamine receptor protein are uncommon and are unlikely to contribute significantly to the genetic predisposition to schizophrenia. The D1 DR gene also was examined in eight alcoholics, including 3 African-Americans and 1 Native American, but no sequence changes were identified.
