PERB11 (MIC) is a gene family possessing multiple copies located within the MHC. Structurally, PERB11 is related to the MHC class I, neonatal IgG Fc receptor (FcRn) and Zn-alpha 2-glycoprotein molecules. The MHC class I family is complex in terms of its genomic arrangement, expression and function, and available evidence suggests that the PERB11 family may be similarly complex. We have adopted an approach to study the expression of such complex gene families by immunizing with multiple peptides and by screening the resulting antibodies against a large range of tissues. The amino acid sequences of PERB11.1 and PERB11.2 as well as those of other related molecules were analysed and compared. Peptides were chosen for immunization based upon (i) loop formation within the equivalent known structure of the MHC class I molecules; (ii) immunogenicity by computer analysis; and (iii) evolutionary relationships. Antibodies in serum from immunized rabbits bound to three out of six peptides used for immunization. ELISA and immunoprecipitation demonstrated binding both to the peptides and to the PERB11.2 recombinant protein. By immunofluorescent staining of various tissues of several species, the three antisera generated overlapping profiles of activity. These included reactions with kidney, small and large intestine, oesophagus, testis, ovary and human neutrophils. This is the first description of antibodies induced by the PERB11 peptides. The extreme complexity of these profiles requires further investigation, but may be explained in terms of antibodies against diverse products of the PERB11 gene family and/or related molecules.
