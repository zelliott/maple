Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is considered to be an autoimmune disease. Various human leukocyte antigen (HLA) associations for different subgroups of this heterogeneous disease have been found. For early-onset pauciarticular arthritis (now oligoarthritic JIA), a strong association with the HLA class II haplotype DQA1*0401/DQB1*0402 (DQ4) has been described. We determined the peptide-binding specificities of this HLA-DQ molecule by screening a synthetic acetylated nonapeptide amide library with one defined and eight random sequence positions. A characteristic binding motif could be deduced. By use of these data, we designed defined specific nonapeptides and identified high-affinity ligands binding to HLA-DQ4. The peptide binding motif of HLA-DQ4 is very similar to the motif of HLA-DQ7, also associated with oligoarthritic JIA. It is, however, different from binding motifs of neutral or protective HLA-DQ molecules. Our results further support the idea of differential peptide presentation in the pathogenesis of oligoarthritic JIA.
