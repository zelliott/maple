Using a human cDNA probe, we have isolated murine genomic and cDNA clones corresponding to the nuclear enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (ADPRP). Northern analysis with the mouse cDNA clones reveals transcripts of 3.7-3.8 kb corresponding in size to the human ADPRP transcript. DNA sequence comparisons between mouse and human clones reveals extensive amino acid sequence conservation within regions harboring DNA binding, NAD+ binding or automodification domains. A survey among mouse inbred strains for restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) reveals at least three distinct ADPRP alleles. The segregation of alleles among mouse genetic recombinants positions ADPRP on mouse chromosome 1 between the complement receptor-related gene At-3 and the Fc receptor locus FcR. Furthermore, ADPRP is closely associated with the autoimmune locus gld (generalized lymphadenopathy).
