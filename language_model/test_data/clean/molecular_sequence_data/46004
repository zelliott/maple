The cDNA and genomic structure of a putative lipophorin receptor from the silkworm, Bombyx mori (BmLpR), indicated the presence of four isoforms, designated LpR1, LpR2, LpR3, and LpR4. The deduced amino acid sequence of each isoform showed five functional domains that are homologous to vertebrate very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR). All four isoforms seem to have originated from a single gene by alternative splicing and were differentially expressed in a tissue- and stage-specific manner. BmLpR1 harbored an additional 27 amino acids in the O-linked sugar domain, resulting in an extra exon. The silkworm BmLpR gene consisted of 16 exons separated by 15 introns spanning >122 kb and was at least three times larger than the human VLDLR gene. Surprisingly, one of the isoforms, LpR4, was expressed specifically in the brain and central nervous system. Additionally, it had a unique cytoplasmic tail, leading to the proposition that it represents a new candidate LpR for possible brain-related function(s). This is the first report on the genomic characterization of an arthropod lipoprotein receptor gene and the identification of a brain-specific receptor variant from a core member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family in invertebrates.
