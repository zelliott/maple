A novel sapelovirus-like virus was isolated from a wild boar (Sus scrofa). In this study, partial viral genomic nucleotide sequences were determined using the rapid determination system of viral nucleic acid sequences (RDV) ver. 3.1, which we recently developed for discovering novel viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of VP1 and 3A proteins and their encoding nucleotide sequences of enteroviruses and sapeloviruses indicated that the isolated virus was closely related to porcine sapelovirus. RT-PCR detected viral sequences in six of 48 wild boar fecal samples.
