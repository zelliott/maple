Marine sponges frequently contain a complex mixture of bacteria, fungi, unicellular algae and cyanobacteria. Epifluorescent microscopy showed that Mycale (Carmia) hentscheli contained coccoid cyanobacteria. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified, fragments cloned and analysed using amplified rRNA gene restriction analysis. The nearly complete 16S rRNA gene of distinct clones was sequenced and aligned using ARB. The phylogenetic analysis indicated the presence of four closely related clones which have a high (8%) sequence divergence from known cyanobacteria, Cyanobacterium stanieri being the closest, followed by Prochloron sp. and Synechocystis sp. All belong to the order Chroococcales. The lack of non-molecular evidence prevents us from proposing a new genus.
