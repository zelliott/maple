The nifL gene product of Klebsiella pneumoniae inhibits the activity of the positive activator protein NifA in response to increased levels either of fixed nitrogen or of oxygen in the medium. In order to demonstrate that the responses to these two effectors are discrete we have subjected nifL to hydroxylamine mutagenesis and isolated nifL mutants that are impaired in their ability to respond to oxygen but not to fixed nitrogen. Two such mutations were sequenced and shown to be single base pair changes located in different parts of nifL. The amino acid sequence of NifL shows limited homology to the histidine protein kinases which comprise the sensing component of bacterial two-component regulatory systems. In the light of the location of one of the oxygen-insensitive mutations (Leu294Phe) we have reassessed this homology and we suggest that the Gln273-Leu317 region of NifL may facilitate interactions between NifL and NifA.
