1. Individual blood samples from 144 Bali (Banteng) cattle [Bos (Bibos) javanicus] in the Northern Territory of Australia and from 61 Bali cross cattle, were examined by zone electrophoresis to determine the variants of haemoglobin, serum albumin and transferrin that are present. 2. Of the common cattle haemoglobin variants (A and B) only variant B occurs in the Bali cattle samples. A second variant, designated CBali, occurs in Bali cattle either as the heterozygote (B CBali) or as the homozygote, the frequencies of occurrence indicating a two-allele system of inheritance without dominance. The CBali cross samples may exhibit the homozygous or heterozygous A variant. 3. The CBali variant has an electrophoretic mobility intermediate between those of the A and B variants at pH 8.6 and 9.1 but closer to B than to A (B greater than C greater than A). It appears to be similar in mobility to the C variants found in Indian Khillan (CKhillan) by Naik, Sukumaran and Sanghvi (Anim. Prodn, 1965 I, 275-277), and in Asian cattle by Oishi, Abe and Namikama (Immunogenet. Lett., 1968 5, 170-173) and Abe, Mogi, Oishi, Tanaka and Suzuki (Proc. XIIth Europ. Conf. Anim. Blood Groups Biochem. Polymorphisms 1972, pp. 225-228), but appreciably different from those in Kenyan and Rhodesian cattle (CRhodesia) found by Braend (Anim. Blood Grps Biochem. Genet., 1971 2, 15-21) and Carr (Rhod. J. agric. Res., 1964 3, 62-62A), respectively. It is also different in mobility from the C variant found by Winter, Mayr, Schleger, Dworak, Krutzler and Burger (Res. vet. Sci., 1984 36, 276-283) in the mithun.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
