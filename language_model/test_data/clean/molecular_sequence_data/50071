EST microsatellite markers were developed in apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) and grape (Vitis vinifera L.). cDNA libraries from either apricot leaves or grape roots were used in an enrichment procedure for GA and CA repeats. The transferability of EST simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers from apricot and grapevine to other related and unrelated species was examined. Overall, grape primers amplified products in most of the Vitaceae accessions while the apricot primers amplified polymorphic alleles only in closely related species of the Rosaceae. In this taxonomic family, ten EST SSR loci were tested, and one single primer pair, PacB22, was amplified across species and sections in the Prunoideae and Maloideae. Sequencing of EST SSR loci in other species and genera confirmed a higher level of conservation in the microsatellite motif and flanking regions in the Vitaceae compared to the Rosaceae. Two distinct fragments of the PacB22 locus amplified across the Malus and Pyrus genera; however, while the coding region was highly conserved, the microsatellite repeat motif was no longer present. The banding pattern was explained by base substitution and insertion/deletion events in the intronic region of PacB22. This study includes the determination of the degree of polymorphism detected among species and genera in two unrelated taxonomic families and the evaluation of the information provided by the microsatellite repeats and the flanking regions.
