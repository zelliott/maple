Three recombinant phage lambda L47 clones containing 4 alpha interferon (IFN) genes have been isolated from a newly constructed human genomic library. Each gene is an allele of a previously described IFN gene, three being only minor variants. The fourth gene SMTIII.1A is a functional allele of the psi LeIF-L gene which previously has been described only as a pseudogene. Therefore, it appears likely that other variant alleles may remain to be described and that the IFN system may be able to tolerate some degeneracy as a consequence of the large number of members of the family.
