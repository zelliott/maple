The [Arg15,Glu52]aprotinin gene has been constructed from a synthetic [Glu52]-aprotinin gene via an exchange of the appropriate DNA cassette. The gene has been fused to the N-terminal part of the bacteriophage MS-2 polymerase and expressed in a temperature inducible E. coli expression system. The produced fusion protein is deposited as inclusion bodies. Pure and functionally active [Arg15,Glu52]aprotinin has been obtained after cleavage of the purified fusion protein and renaturation of the aprotinin homologue. Recombinant [Arg15,Glu52]aprotinin shows good inhibition of human anionic and cationic trypsin (Ki less than or equal to 10(-11)M) and of human plasma kallikrein (Ki = 3.2 x 10(-10)M). The inhibition constants for human plasmin are Ki = 1.3 x 10(-10)M and for human urinary kallikrein Ki = 10(-11)M. No inhibition was found with the human proteinases thrombin, coagulation factor Xa, urokinase, tissue plasminogen activator, cathepsin G, leukocyte elastase and pancreatic elastase.
