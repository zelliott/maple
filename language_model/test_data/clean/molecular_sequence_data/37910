A growing number of medical research teams have begun to explore the experimental advantages of using a genetic animal model, the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, with a view to enhancing our understanding of genes underlying human congenital disorders. In this study, we have compared sequences of positionally cloned human disease genes with the C.elegans database of predicted genes. Drawing on examples from spinal muscular atrophy, polycystic kidney disease, muscular dystrophy and Alzheimer's disease, we illustrate how data from C.elegans can yield new insights into the function and interactions of human disease genes.
