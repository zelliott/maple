New improvements in the chemical synthesis of oligoribonucleotides are reported and they are applied to the first total chemical synthesis of a natural RNA. This E. coli K12 alanine tRNA contains in its sequence dihydrouridine, ribothymidine and pseudo-uridine. The synthetic tRNA was fully sequenced and showed a 42% aminoacyl acceptance activity. When tRNA was used as a template, reverse transcriptase directed the incorporation of adenine opposite dihydrouridine, ribothymidine and pseudouridine.
