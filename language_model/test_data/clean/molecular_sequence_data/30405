TGF-beta 2 and -beta 5 have been purified from medium conditioned by Xenopus cultured cells (XTC) and identified based on their N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis and biological activity. When applied in high concentrations, Xenopus TGF-beta 2, like porcine TGF-beta 2, induces expression of mesodermal markers from cultured Xenopus ectodermal explants, whereas TGF-beta 5 is inactive in this assay. However, the TGF-beta 's could be separated from the major mesoderm-inducing activity present in XTC medium. Xenopus TGF-beta 2 and -beta 5 are approximately equivalent to TGF-beta 1 in their abilities to inhibit the growth of mink lung CCL-64 cells, induce anchorage-independent growth of rat NRK cells, inhibit the proliferation and antibody secretion of human B-lymphocytes, and stimulate chemotaxis of human monocytes. These data establish the functional activity of TGF-beta 5 and suggest that more complex multicellular systems, in contrast to most isolated cells, discriminate between the different TGF-beta s.
