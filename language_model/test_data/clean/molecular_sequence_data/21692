The tung tree is valuable for tung oil, which is derived from the oilseeds of the tree. Microsatellite markers were developed in tung trees (Vernicia montanaand V. fordii) for use in population genetic studies and, particularly, analyses of genetic relationships among germplasms.

A total of 20 microsatellite markers were developed and characterized in V. montanaand tested for cross-amplification in V. fordii, using the Fast Isolation by AFLP of Sequences COntaining Repeats protocol. These markers showed rich polymorphism when assessed in 120 samples of V. montanaand six samples of V. fordii.

The developed microsatellite markers will be of great use for investigating genetic diversity of germplasms, analyzing population structure, and facilitating molecular breeding in tung trees.
