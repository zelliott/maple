The diabetogenic variant PV2 of encephalomyocarditis virus was cloned, and three recombinants differing in their 5' poly(C) tracts were analyzed. It is shown that the poly(C) region is not essential for infectivity in mice but does influence the virus load and degree of pathological lesions within the Langerhans' islets but not in the myocardium.
