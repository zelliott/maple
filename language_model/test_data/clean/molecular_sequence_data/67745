Positive-strand RNA viruses require host intracellular membranes for replicating their genomic RNAs. In this study, we determined the domains and critical amino acids in p27 of Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) required for its association with and targeting of ER membranes in Nicotiana benthamiana plants using a C-terminally GFP-fused and biologically functional p27. Confocal microscopy and membrane-flotation assays using an Agrobacterium-mediated expression system showed that a stretch of 20 amino acids in the N-terminal region of p27 is essential for the association of p27 with membranes. We identified the amino acids in this domain required for the association of p27 with membranes using alanine-scanning mutagenesis. We also found that this domain contains amino acids not critical for the membrane association but required for the formation of viral RNA replication complexes and negative-strand RNA synthesis. Our results extend our understanding of the multifunctional role of p27 in RCNMV replication.
