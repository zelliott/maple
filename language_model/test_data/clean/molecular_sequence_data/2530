The retroviral protease-encoding region, PR, situated between the gag and pol genes, underwent gene duplication in the lineage now represented by simian retrovirus type 1; the sequence of the duplicated segment has diverged considerably from the present PR sequence [Power, M.D., Marx, P.A., Bryant, M.L., Gardner, M.B., Barr, P.J. & Luciw, P.A. (1986) Science 231, 1567-1572]. The PR-like duplicated gene segment was at some point translocated to a new site within the pol gene of a lentivirus (subsequent to the divergence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1), where it has been maintained. We have identified in the vaccinia virus genome a sequence that is homologous to the PR-like duplicated gene segment of both types of retrovirus in an open reading frame whose product is predicted to be a 16.2-kDa protein. The vaccinia PR-like gene is located in the HindIII F fragment, and its product displays 31-34% amino acid identity to the two types of retroviral duplicated protease sequences over a region encompassing 125 amino acid residues. Sequences flanking the vaccinia gene showed no significant homology at either the DNA or amino acid level to the retroviruses. Nuclease S1 and primer extension analyses determined that the vaccinia gene is transcribed early in infection.
