Unlike most proteases, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is not synthesized as an inactive precursor or zymogen. Instead, the single-chain "proenzyme" form of t-PA possesses very significant catalytic activity. Recent investigations of the molecular basis of the unusually high enzymatic activity of single-chain t-PA have focused attention upon Asp-194, a residue that is invariant among chymotrypsin-like enzymes. The critical role of this residue in securing the active conformation of mature chymotrypsin-like enzymes has been discussed extensively. Subsequent work, however, has indicated that this conserved residue can also form interactions that dramatically influence the catalytic activity of serine protease zymogens. While Asp-194 forms interactions that suppress the activity of the zymogen chymotrypsinogen, it may, by contrast, directly promote the catalytically active conformation of single-chain t-PA. To test the hypothesis that Asp-194 promotes the activity of both single- and two-chain t-PA and therefore plays opposing roles in single-chain t-PA and chymotrypsinogen, and also to examine whether this invariant residue plays an essential role in the stimulation of t-PA by fibrin, we used site-directed mutagenesis to construct the following variants of t-PA: t-PA/D194E, t-PA/D194N, t-PA/R15E,D194E, and t-PA/R15E,D194N. In the absence of fibrin, the activity of enzymes carrying a mutation at position 194 was reduced by factors of 1000-2000 compared to wild type t-PA. Similar reductions of activity were observed for both single- and two-chain variants, suggesting an important role for Asp-194 in both forms of the enzyme. The mutated enzymes, however, displayed a dramatically enhanced response to fibrin monomers. While the activity of wild type t-PA was stimulated by fibrin monomers by a factor of 960, the corresponding stimulation factor for the mutated enzymes varied from 498,000-1,050,000.
