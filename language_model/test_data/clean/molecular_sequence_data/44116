In polarized epithelial cell lines, enveloped viruses are directionally released by asymmetric viral budding at specific plasma membrane domains. Previous studies have shown that HIV-1 budding and gp160 expression occur on basolateral membranes whereas the release of HIV-1 Gag particles, in the absence of the Env glycoproteins, is nonpolarized. We have examined the directional transport and surface expression of HIV-2 and SIV envelope glycoproteins using vaccinia virus recombinants in Vero C1008 polarized epithelial cells. Analogous to HIV-1 gp160, both HIV-2 and SIV surface glycoproteins were preferentially directed to basolateral membranes. Hence basolateral expression appears to be a common property of the glycoproteins of primate lentiviruses. To explore the role of the cytoplasmic domain in directing the HIV-2 and SIV Env glycoproteins to the basolateral surface, stop codons were introduced to mimic the natural cytoplasmic truncations observed following repeated passage of these viruses in culture. These truncated glycoproteins also were sorted to the basolateral domain, but at a lower efficiency than the full-length protein product. In contrast, when the entire cytoplasmic domain of the SIV Env glycoprotein was deleted, the tailless SIV mutant was preferentially expressed on the apical surface. These data indicate the presence of a basolateral sorting signal in the cytoplasmic domain of primate lentiviral glycoproteins.
