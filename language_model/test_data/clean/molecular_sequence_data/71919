The roles of HS2 and HS3 from the human beta-globin locus control region and of the TATA, CACCC, and stage selector elements of the gamma-globin promoter, in competitive inhibition of beta-globin gene expression in early development, were tested using stable transfections of HEL and K562 cells. Cells with an HS3gamma beta construct demonstrate that HS3 exhibits enhancing activity, but compared with HS2, this site participates less consistently in the inhibition of embryonic/fetal beta-globin expression. In cells with HS3HS2gamma beta constructs, the two HS sites act in concert to more effectively enhance gamma-globin gene expression and to drive stage-specific expression of the gamma- and beta-globin genes. A gamma-globin gene with a -161 promoter can competitively inhibit beta-globin gene expression. HS3HS2gamma beta constructs were used to determine the effects of gamma-globin promoter mutations within this region on competition. The CACCC and TATA elements, but not the stage selector element, inhibit inappropriate embryonic/fetal stage expression of the beta-globin gene. The mutation in the gamma-globin TATA element results in the use of two major alternative transcription start sites. The data suggest that proteins binding to the gamma-globin CACCC and TATA elements interact with those binding to HS2 and/or HS3 to preclude beta-globin transcription in early development.
