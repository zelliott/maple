Peptide-nucleic acids (PNAs) including pyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-2,4,5,7-(1H,3H,6H,8H)-tetraone (PPT) as a nucleobase were synthesized, and their binding affinity for the complementary oligodeoxyribonucleotides was investigated. We found that PNAs with one or two PPT(s) and natural nucleobases (i.e., adenine, cytosine, guanine, or thymine) have excellent binding affinity for oligodeoxyribonucleotides with complementary bases at the positions facing the natural nucleobases, and with adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine at the positions opposite PPT in PNAs. The binding affinity of the PPT-containing PNA is higher than or comparable to that of a PNA consisting of all complementary natural nucleobases, viz. a PNA with a suitable natural nucleobase in place of PPT in the PPT-containing PNA. Consequently, it was concluded that PPT serves as a useful universal base that can recognize all natural nucleobases.
