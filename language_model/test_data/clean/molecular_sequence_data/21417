Transglutaminase type 2 (TG2) catalyzes the formation of an ε-(γ-glutamyl)-lysine isopeptide bond between adjacent peptides or proteins including those of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Elevated extracellular TG2 leads to accelerated ECM deposition and reduced clearance that underlie tissue scarring and fibrosis. The extracellular trafficking of TG2 is crucial to its role in ECM homeostasis; however, the mechanism by which TG2 escapes the cell is unknown as it has no signal leader peptide and therefore cannot be transported classically. Understanding TG2 transport may highlight novel mechanisms to interfere with the extracellular function of TG2 as isoform-specific TG2 inhibitors remain elusive. Mammalian expression vectors were constructed containing domain deletions of TG2. These were transfected into three kidney tubular epithelial cell lines, and TG2 export was assessed to identify critical domains. Point mutation was then used to highlight specific sequences within the domain required for TG2 export. The removal of β-sandwich domain prevented all TG2 export. Mutations of Asp(94) and Asp(97) within the N-terminal β-sandwich domain were identified as crucial for TG2 externalization. These form part of a previously identified fibronectin binding domain ((88)WTATVVDQQDCTLSLQLTT(106)). However, siRNA knockdown of fibronectin failed to affect TG2 export. The sequence (88)WTATVVDQQDCTLSLQLTT(106) within the β-sandwich domain of TG2 is critical to its export in tubular epithelial cell lines. The extracellular trafficking of TG2 is independent of fibronectin.
