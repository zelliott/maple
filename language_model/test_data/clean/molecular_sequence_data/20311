2B is a 99 amino acid membrane protein encoded by enteroviruses such as polio and coxsackie viruses with two transmembrane domains. The protein is found to make membranes of infected cells permeable. Using a computational approach which positions the models and assesses stability by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations a putative tetrameric bundle model of 2B is generated. The bundles show a pore lining motif of three lysines followed by a serine. The bundle is discussed in terms of different possible orientations of the helices in the membrane and the consequences this has on the in vivo activity of 2B.
