Archaea are forming one of the three kingdoms defining the universal phylogenetic tree of living organisms. Within itself this kingdom is heterogenous regarding the mechanisms for deriving energy from the environment for support of cellular functions. These comprise fermentative and chemolithotrophic pathways as well as light driven and respiratory energy conservation. Due to their extreme growth conditions access to the molecular machineries of energy transduction in archaea can be experimentally limited. Among the aerobic, extreme thermoacidophilic archaea, the genus Sulfolobus has been studied in greater detail than many others and provides a comprehensive picture of bioenergetics on the level of substrate metabolism, formation and utilization of high energy phosphate bonds, and primary energy conservation in respiratory electron transport. A number of novel metabolic reactions as well as unusual structures of respiratory enzyme complexes have been detected. Since their genomic organization and many other primary structures could be determined, these studies shed light on the evolution of various bioenergetic modules. It is the aim of this comprehensive review to bring the different aspects of Sulfolobus bioenergetics into focus as a representative example of, and point of comparison for closely related, aerobic archaea.
