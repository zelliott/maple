3'(2')-O-(4-Benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP (Bz2ATP) was used as a photoaffinity label of the ATP binding site of unphosphorylated chicken gizzard myosin. Specific photolabeling of the active site of 6 S myosin was assured by forming a stable myosin.Co(II)Bz2ADP.orthovanadate complex (termed trapping) prior to irradiation. Co2+ was used in place of Mg2+ to prevent the known photoreaction of vanadate with myosin which destabilizes the trapped complex. [3H] Bz2ADP.Pi was also stably trapped on gizzard myosin by forming the 10 S folded conformation of the protein in the presence of [3H]Bz2ATP and Mg2+. Irradiation of 6 S myosin containing orthovanadate trapped [3H] Bz2ADP or 10 S trapped [3H]Bz2ADP.Pi gave 32 and 30% covalent incorporation, respectively. The 50-kDa and precursor 68-kDa tryptic peptides of the subfragment-1 heavy chain derived from both forms of myosin were found to contain essentially all of the covalently attached [3H]Bz2ADP. Parallel experiments with untrapped [3H]Bz2ADP showed extensive nonspecific labeling of all of the major tryptic peptides and the light chains. Eight labeled peptides, isolated from 6 and 10 S photolabeled myosin, contained the sequence G319-H-V-P-I-X-A-Q326, where X corresponds to labeled proline 324. [14C]Bz2ADP was previously shown to label serine 324 in skeletal subfragment-1 (Mahmood, R., Elzinga, M., and Yount, R. G. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 3989-3995), which corresponds to alanine 325 in the gizzard sequence. Thus, this region of the 50-kDa tryptic fragment, near the nucleotide binding site, in both skeletal and smooth muscle myosins, must fold in essentially the same manner.
