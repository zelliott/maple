Morphine is the most commonly used and most effective analgesic in the clinic. However, its use is limited by the tolerance. Evidence indicates that the delta-opioid receptor (DOR) is essential for morphine antinociceptive tolerance; however, their underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), activated in morphine antinociceptive tolerance, directly phosphorylates DOR at Thr-161 in DRG neurons. Cdk5 was found to phosphorylate Thr-161 in the second loop of DOR, but not the corresponding residue in the mu-opioid receptor (MOR). Phosphorylation at Thr-161 is required for normal cell surface expression of DOR, and the formation of DOR-MOR heterodimers. Our studies indicated that inhibition of Cdk5 activity or overexpression of a DOR mutant lacking the Cdk5 phosphorylation site displayed relatively low cell surface expression and relatively low abilities to form heterodimers of DOR and MOR; intrathecal delivery of a construct expressing the T161A mutant of DOR attenuated morphine antinociceptive tolerance in rats, suggesting that Thr-161 phosphorylation of DOR contributed to Cdk5-mediated morphine antinociceptive tolerance. Furthermore, an engineered Tat fusion-interfering peptide corresponding to the second intracellular loop of DOR (Tat-DOR-2L), reduced the cell surface expression of DOR, disrupted the formation of DOR-MOR heterodimers, and significantly attenuated the development of morphine antinociceptive tolerance after intrathecal injection. The present study indicates that Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of DOR at Thr-161 plays a crucial role in the development of morphine tolerance and suggests the possibility of targeting DOR phosphorylation at Thr-161 to attenuate morphine antinociceptive tolerance during pain management.
