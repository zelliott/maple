Leuconostoc mesenteroides Y105, previously described for production of mesentericin Y105, an anti-Listeria bacteriocin, was shown to secrete a second bacteriocin. The latter was purified, and its molecular mass of 3446 Da, obtained by mass spectrometric analysis, indicates that this bacteriocin should be identical to mesenterocin 52B [Revol-Junelles et al., Lett Appl Microbiol 23:120, 1996]. This second bacteriocin produced by L. mesenteroides Y105 was named mesentericin B105. Its structural gene, mesB, was then localized by a reverse genetic approach, cloned, and sequenced. MesB was found on the pHY30 plasmid, next to mesY gene clusters. Curing experiments led to isolation of two L. mesenteroides Y105 derivatives, named L. mesenteroides Y29 and Y30. The latter had lost pHY30 plasmid, encoding bacteriocin determinants, therefore explaining its phenotype (MesY-, MesB-). On the contrary, Y29 derivative still harbors the pHY30 but did not produce any bacteriocin. Thus, its phenotype could likely result from a point mutation within a gene, probably encoding a protein involved in production of both mesentericin Y105 and mesentericin B105.
