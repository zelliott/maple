Nitric oxide (NO) is essential for normal physiology, but excessive production of NO during inflammatory processes can damage the neighboring tissues. Reactive nitrogen oxide species (RNOx), including peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)), are powerful nitrating agents. Biological protein nitration is involved in several disease states, including inflammatory diseases, and it is evident by detection of 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT) in inflamed tissues. In this study, we identified peroxynitrite-induced post-translational modifications (PTMs) in human hemoglobin by accurate mass measurement as well as by the MS(2) and MS(3) spectra. Nitration on Tyr-24, Tyr-42 (α-globin), and Tyr-130 (β-globin) as well as nitrosation on Tyr-24 (α-globin) were identified. Also characterized were oxidation of all three methionine residues, α-Met-32, α-Met-76, and β-Met-55 to the sulfoxide, as well as cysteine oxidation determined as sulfinic acid on α-Cys-104 and sulfonic acid on α-Cys-104, β-Cys-93, and β-Cys-112. These modifications are detected in hemoglobin freshly isolated from human blood and the extents of modifications were semiquantified relative to the reference peptides by nanoflow liquid chromatography-nanospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-NSI/MS/MS) under the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. The results showed a statistically significant positive correlation between cigarette smoking and the extents of tyrosine nitration at α-Tyr-24 and at α-Tyr-42. To our knowledge, this is the first report on identification and quantification of multiple PTMs in hemoglobin from human blood and association of a specific 3NT-containing peptide with cigarette smoking. This highly sensitive and specific assay only requires hemoglobin isolated from one drop (∼10 μL) of blood. Thus, measurement of these PTMs in hemoglobin might be feasible for assessing nitrative stress in vivo.
