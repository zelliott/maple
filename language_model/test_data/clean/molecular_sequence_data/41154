A Gram-positive, rod-shaped, endospore-forming bacterium, designated strain BLB-1(T), was isolated from samples of tidal flat sediment from the Yellow Sea. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis demonstrated that the isolate belonged to the Bacillus rRNA group 2 and was closely related to Bacillus massiliensis CIP 108446(T) (97.4%), Bacillus odysseyi ATCC PTA-4993(T) (96.7%), Lysinibacillus fusiformis DSM 2898(T) (96.2%) and Lysinibacillus boronitolerans DSM 17140(T) (95.9%). Sequence similarities with related species in other genera, including Caryophanon, Sporosarcina and Solibacillus, were <96.1%. Chemotaxonomic data supported the affiliation of strain BLB-1(T) with the genus Lysinibacillus. The major menaquinone was MK-7, the cell-wall sugars were glucose and xylose, the cell-wall peptidoglycan type was A4α (L-Lys-D-Asp), the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and several unknown phospholipids, and the major fatty acids were anteiso-C(15:0) (35.6%), iso-C(15:0) (25.6%) and anteiso-C(17:0) (16.5%). The most closely related species, Bacillus massiliensis and Bacillus odysseyi, were also assigned to this genus based on phylogenetic analysis and phenotypic data. The results of DNA-DNA hybridizations and phenotypic tests supported the differentiation of all three taxa from species of the genus Lysinibacillus with validly published names. Thus, strain BLB-1(T) ( = KCTC 13296(T)  = JCM 15800(T)) represents a novel species, for which the name Lysinibacillus sinduriensis sp. nov. is proposed. It is also proposed that Bacillus massiliensis CIP 108446(T) ( =4400831(T) = CCUG49529(T)  =KCTC 13178(T)) and Bacillus odysseyi NBRC 100172(T) ( =34hs-1(T)  =ATCC PTA-4993(T)  =NRRL B-30641(T)  =DSM 18869(T)  =CIP 108263(T)  =KCTC 3961(T)) be transferred to the genus Lysinibacillus as Lysinibacillus massiliensis comb. nov. and Lysinibacillus odysseyi comb. nov., respectively.
