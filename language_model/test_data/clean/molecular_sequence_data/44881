To identify immunologically important domains on filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), a Bordetella pertussis protein included in new acellular pertussis vaccines (ACPVs), a series of monoclonal antibodies, sera from infants vaccinated with ACPVs or whole cell pertussis vaccine (WCPV), and sera from patients with pertussis were analyzed by immunoblots containing FHA fragments and recombinant FHA proteins. Immunodominant domains located at the COOH-terminus of FHA (type I domain) and near the NH2-terminus (type II domain) were defined by the reactivity with monoclonal antibodies. The sera from patients with pertussis and sera from infants vaccinated with WCPV or with 6 different investigational ACPVs specifically recognized well-defined regions within the type I and type II domains. Identification of these prominent immunologic epitopes on FHA should be useful for the construction of more well-defined pertussis vaccines and for the interpretation of human serologic responses, which may correlate with efficacy of pertussis vaccines.
