Two major caseins have been isolated from the milk of the common brushtailed possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). These have been identified as alpha- and beta-casein on the basis of the similarity of their N-terminal sequences to those of the caseins of another marsupial (Macropus eugenii). Both proteins appear to exist in multiple forms. Possum alpha-casein is glycosylated mainly in the form of sialic acid residues and was shown by electrospray mass spectrometry to have multiply phosphorylated forms of three families with molecular masses 22700 and 23200 Da that may represent genetic variants. Two-dimensional electrophoresis showed that beta-casein exists as a complex of five or six proteins of identical N-terminal sequence but differing pI. Electrospray mass spectrometry indicated that the beta-caseins also are multiply phosphorylated with masses between 32300 and 32600 Da. A subfamily with mass values 1530 greater was also detected. The patterns were not affected by stage of lactation and quantitative analysis of two-dimensional gels of whole milk shows that alpha- and beta-caseins are present at a constant ratio throughout lactation. cDNA clones for the possum alpha- and beta-caseins have been isolated from an early lactation mammary cDNA library and sequenced.
