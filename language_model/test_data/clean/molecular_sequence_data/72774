A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol was developed for specific detection of Trichomonas tenax by using a pair of primers designed for its 18S rRNA gene. The detection was specific for T. tenax, since no amplification was detected with DNAs from Trichomonas vaginalis, which belongs to the same genus as T. tenax, in addition to various species of oral protists, fungi and bacteria, and human leukocytes. This method had a detection limit of 100 fg for T. tenax genomic DNA and could detect T. tenax cells in dental plaque at a concentration of as low as 5 cells per PCR mixture. Direct detection from clinical dental plaque samples was also possible; therefore, the present PCR procedure could provide a simple and rapid detection method of T. tenax in dental plaque.
