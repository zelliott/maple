Annexins are a family of calcium/phospholipid binding proteins sharing strong sequence similarities. A site-directed affinity-purified antibody was produced against the consensus peptide, K A M K G L G T D E. This antibody recognizes all six annexin proteins in the purified state and in total-protein tissue extracts. The antibody should prove useful in identifying functional domains of this protein family.
