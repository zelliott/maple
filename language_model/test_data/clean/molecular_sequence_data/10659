The 16S rRNA gene sequences of Salmonella typhi and Salmonella typhimurium were amplified by PCR, cloned, and sequenced. These sequences were analyzed by comparison with reference organisms from the family Enterobacteriaceae. Both S. typhi and S. typhimurium belong to the gamma subdivision of the class Proteobacteria.
