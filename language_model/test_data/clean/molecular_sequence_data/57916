The structural polymorphism of free lipid A and deep rough mutant lipopolysaccharide (LPS Re) from Salmonella minnesota strain R595 and Escherichia coli strain F515 was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (IR) spectroscopy. For this, the beta <--> alpha phase states and the three-dimensional supramolecular structures, the latter deduced from small-angle synchrotron radiation x-ray diffraction, were investigated at different water contents, Mg2+ concentrations, and temperatures. The analysis of the IR data for vibrations originating from the hydrophobic moiety shows that the beta <--> alpha acyl chain melting is strongly expressed only for the stretching and scissoring modes of the methylene groups. Vibrational groups originating from the interface region sense the acyl chain melting well (ester carbonyl bands) or only weakly (amide bands), and those resulting from the pure polar moiety not at all. From the x-ray data, the existence of lamellar (L), different cubic, and, for lipid A and LPS R595, also inverted hexagonal (HII) structures could be proven in the temperature range 20-80 degrees C with cubic <--> cubic and cubic <--> HII transitions for the Mg(2+)-free and L <--> HII transitions for the Mg(2+)-containing samples. These structural transitions can be characterized most readily by specific changes of the vibrational bands resulting from the interface region: the ester carbonyl and the amide bands. The magnitude of the changes corresponds to that of the structural rearrangement, i.e., is highest for the L <--> HII, lower for the cubic <--> HII, and lowest for the cubic <--> cubic transitions. The structural transitions are only marginally expressed for vibrational bands of the hydrophobic moiety. Similarly, the band contours of vibrations from the hydrophilic region are no indicators of the structural reorientations except for the carboxylate bands of LPS Re. Particularly the stretching vibrations of the phosphate groups are nearly completely invariant; the absolute values of their half bandwidths, however, differ significantly for lipid A and LPS Re, which seems to be of biological relevance. The ability of IR spectroscopy to detect supramolecular changes also beyond the measurability by x-ray diffraction, i.e., at water contents > 95 to 99.5%, is demonstrated.
