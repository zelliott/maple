Studying the activity of T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase) on open circular DNAs, we observed virtually complete termination within potential triplex-forming sequences. Mutations destroying the triplex potential of the sequences prevented termination, while compensatory mutations restoring triplex potential restored it. We hypothesize that strand displacement during DNA polymerization of double-helical templates brings three DNA strands (duplex DNA downstream of the polymerase plus a displaced overhang) into close proximity, provoking triplex formation, which in turn prevents further DNA synthesis. Supporting this idea, we found that Sequenase is unable to propagate through short triple-helical stretches within single-stranded DNA templates. Thus, DNA polymerase, by inducing triplex formation at specific sequences in front of the replication fork, causes self-termination. Possible biological implications of such 'conformational suicide' are discussed. Our data also provide a novel way to target DNA polymerases at specific sequences using triplex-forming oligonucleotides.
