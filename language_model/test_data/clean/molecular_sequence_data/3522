Development of aminoglycoside-nucleic acid conjugates is presented. Synthesis of a DNA dimer covalently linked to kanamycin and neomycin isothiocyanates has been carried out. The development of such conjugates will help couple the sequence specificity of nucleic acids to the electrostatic/shape complementarity of aminoglycoside antibiotics in binding nucleic acid targets.
