The gene encoding the soluble pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase (STH) of Pseudomonas fluorescens was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. STH is related to the flavoprotein disulfide oxidoreductases but lacks one of the conserved redox-active cysteine residues. The gene is highly similar to an E. coli gene of unknown function.
