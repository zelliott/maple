An unusual heteroxylan composed of galactosyl, 4-O-methyl-glucuronosyl and xylosyl residues with molar ratio 1:3:30 was isolated from the wood of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. The results of linkage analysis, supported by data of 1H, 2D 1H-1H COSY and 13C NMR spectroscopy, revealed that the polysaccharide is a (2-O-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-4-O-methyl-alpha-D- glucurono)-D-xylan with a (1-->4)-linked beta-D-xylopyranosyl backbone branched at O-2 by short side chains composed of terminal 4-O-methyl-alpha-D-glucuronic acid and of 4-O-methyl-alpha-D-glucuronic acid substituted at O-2 with alpha-D-galactose.
