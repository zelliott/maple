We cloned the era gene of Francisella tularensis from a plasmid library by heterologous genetic complementation of an Escherichia coli mutant conditionally defective for the production of Era, an essential protein for cell growth. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that, in F. tularensis, era constitutes a single gene operon. ORFs aspC and mdh encoding aspartate aminotransferase and malate dehydrogenase, respectively, flank era in F. tularensis. Although classified as Gram-, the flanking regions and the relative location of era in F. tularensis are distinctly different from those of typical Gram- and Gram+ bacteria. Computer analysis of bacterial Era protein sequences identified conserved domains in addition to the common G domains of most GTP-binding proteins.
