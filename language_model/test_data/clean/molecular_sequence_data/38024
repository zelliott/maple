The novobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces spheroides NCIB 11891 was cloned by using homologous deoxynucleoside diphosphate (dNDP)-glucose 4,6-dehydratase gene fragments as probes. Double-stranded sequencing of 25.6 kb revealed the presence of 23 putative open reading frames (ORFs), including the gene for novobiocin resistance, gyrB(r), and at least 11 further ORFs to which a possible role in novobiocin biosynthesis could be assigned. An insertional inactivation experiment with a dNDP-glucose 4, 6-dehydratase fragment resulted in abolishment of novobiocin production, since biosynthesis of the deoxysugar moiety of novobiocin was blocked. Heterologous expression of a key enzyme of novobiocin biosynthesis, i.e., novobiocic acid synthetase, in Streptomyces lividans TK24 further confirmed the involvement of the analyzed genes in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic.
