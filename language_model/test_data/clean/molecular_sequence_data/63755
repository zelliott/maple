Aprotinin, the most studied serine proteinase inhibitor, was isolated from porcine lung for the first time. The purified porcine aprotinin had an Mr value of approximately 7 kDa. It cross-reacted with polyclonal serum anti-commercial aprotinin. About 1 microg porcine aprotinin inhibited 6 microg trypsin whereas 1 microg commercial soybean inhibitor inhibited only 1 microg trypsin. The aprotinin gene was also isolated from porcine lung: the deduced amino acid sequence showed 74% identity to bovine aprotinin.
