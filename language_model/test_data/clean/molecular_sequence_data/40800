Plant profilins have been reported as minor allergens. They are a well-known pan-allergen family responsible for cross-reactivity between plant-derived foods and pollens. Watermelon profilin has been reported to be a major allergen in watermelon (Citrullus lanatus).The aim of this study was to characterize recombinant watermelon profilin, confirming its reactivity for diagnostic purposes and the development of immunotherapy.

Native profilin was purified from watermelon extract by affinity chromatography using poly-L-proline. Recombinant His-tagged profilin was produced in Pichia pastoris yeast using pPICZÎ±A vector and purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography. ELISA and immunoblot were carried out with sera from 17 watermelon-allergic patients. Biological activity was tested by the basophil activation test.

Native profilin and recombinant profilin were purified and identified by mass spectrometry. Both show similar IgE reactivity in vitro and are biologically active.

Similarities were found in the IgE-binding patterns and biological activity of recombinant profilin and native profilin. Recombinant profilin may be a powerful tool for specific diagnosis.
