Using Phl p V-depleted timothy grass pollen extract (Phleum pratense) as immunogen, we obtained a monoclonal antibody, QG 4, which recognized proteins of 33, 35, and 37 kd as determined by Western blotting. The antibody cross-reacted with pollen proteins of other grass species in the molecular weight range of 30 to 37 kd. By means of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis blot of timothy grass pollen extract, we demonstrated at least seven protein spots: two of 37 kd with isoelectric points of 6.4 and 6.6; four of 35 kd with isoelectric points of 6.5, 6.8, 7.1, and 7.3; and one of 33 kd with an isoelectric point of 8.5. These protein spots were also detected by patients' pooled serum. Microsequencing of the 20 N-terminal amino acid residues revealed structures with sequence identities up to 90% to the well-established allergen, Lol p I of ryegrass (Lolium perenne). Therefore we assume that the monoclonal antibody QG 4 recognized the corresponding allergen Phl p I in timothy grass pollen.
