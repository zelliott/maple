Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection has been discovered recently in people of Amerindian descent living in coastal areas of British Columbia, Canada. DNA sequencing combined with phylogenetic analysis and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing of HTLV-1 strains recovered from these British Columbia Indians (BCI) was conducted. Sequence-based phylogenetic trees distributed the BCI isolates among the Japanese subcluster (subcluster B) and the geographically widely distributed subcluster (subcluster A) of the large HTLV-1 cosmopolitan cluster. Long terminal repeat (LTR) RFLP typing revealed three distinct, equally frequent LTR cleavage patterns, two of which were of previously recognized Japanese and widely dispersed cosmopolitan types. A third, new cleavage pattern was detected which may have arisen by recombination between two other HTLV-1 genotypes. Our results suggest multiple origins for HTLV-1 in BCI, which are equally consistent with (i) a cluster of recent sporadic infections, (ii) ancient endemic vertical transmission through Amerindian lineages, or (iii) both.
