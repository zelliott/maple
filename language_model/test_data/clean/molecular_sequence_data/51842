The primary structures of growth hormone (GH) of three cyprinid species, bighead carp, silver carp, and grass carp, were determined by a chemical method and/or by molecular cloning. The bighead carp GH was extracted from pituitary tissue by use of an alkaline medium, then successively purified by gel filtration, hydrophobic interaction column chromatography, and reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. The primary structure of bighead carp GH determined chemically is identical to that deduced from the cDNA nucleotide sequence. By molecular cloning, the primary structures of silver carp and grass carp GHs were also determined. The GHs of these three cyprinid species all contain 188 amino acid residues and their sequences are identical. When four of the five cysteines of cyprinid GHs were arranged to match the same positions of cysteines of other vertebrate GHs, a maximally matched alignment was achieved. Among fishes, GHs are relatively conserved within the same order (82 to 100% identity) but they are more diversified between orders (49 to 68% identity). In further comparison, fish GHs are even more different from tetrapod GHs (37 to 58% identity). Although the primary structures of vertebrate GHs are relatively variable, four homologous sequences, notably one located at the C-terminal, are found.
