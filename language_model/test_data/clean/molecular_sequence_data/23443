The extracellular polysaccharide capsules of Pasteurella multocida types A, D, and F are composed of hyaluronan, N-acetylheparosan (heparosan or unsulfated, unepimerized heparin), and unsulfated chondroitin, respectively. Previously, a type D heparosan synthase, a glycosyltransferase that forms the repeating disaccharide heparosan backbone, was identified. Here, a approximately 73% identical gene product that is encoded outside of the capsule biosynthesis locus was also shown to be a functional heparosan synthase. Unlike PmHS1, the PmHS2 enzyme was not stimulated greatly by the addition of an exogenous polymer acceptor and yielded smaller- molecular-weight-product size distributions. Virtually identical hssB genes are found in most type A, D, and F isolates. The occurrence of multiple polysaccharide synthases in a single strain invokes the potential for capsular variation.
