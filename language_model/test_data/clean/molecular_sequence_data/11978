The renal kallikrein-kinin system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension. The expression level of the renal kallikrein gene in the kidney is significantly lower in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) as compared with that of normotensive (SD and WKY) rats. Deletion analysis showed that the fragment -356/-188 of the promoter contains a transcriptional silencer(s) and the GC rich region located between -77 and -187 is the minimal essential element for directing the expression of the CAT reporter gene in mouse L cells. In the kidney of normotensive vs hypertensive rats, the nuclear protein factors NF1/CTF and SP1 bind differently to the renal kallikrein promoter, but similarly in the salivary gland. The differential transcriptional regulation of the rat renal kallikrein gene in the kidney may be responsible for the genetic difference between normotensive and hypertensive rats.
