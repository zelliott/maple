Elevated levels of circulating monokines (IL-6, IL-1, and TNF alpha) have been seen in HIV-1 infection, and the overproduction of these cytokines could contribute to AIDS pathogenesis in various ways. In previous work, we had seen that exposure of human monocytes to HIV-1, including inactivated, noninfectious HIV, led to rapid IL-6 gene expression and secretion. To investigate cytokine production in response to components of HIV by monocytes/macrophages, production of IL-6 and IL-10 were examined in a human monocytic cell line, THP-1, stimulated by HIV proteins. IL-6 production was induced in THP-1 cells by a detergent lysate of HIV, particularly fractions at molecular weight of 25-50 kDa. Recombinant HIV envelope glycoprotein 41 (gp41), but not gp120 or p24, also was seen to induce significant IL-6 production by THP-1 cells. These results suggest that gp41, transmembrane protein, is the primary HIV-encoded protein involved in inducing IL-6 production. IL-10 was also produced with delayed kinetics, following IL-6 production in THP-1 cells stimulated by gp41. To investigate a possible regulatory role for IL-10 in HIV-induced monokine production, recombinant IL-10 was added to gp41-exposed THP-1 cells. IL-10 inhibited gp41-induced IL-6 production and reduced the expression of IL-6 mRNA. When anti-human IL-10 neutralizing antibody was added to THP-1 cells, IL-6 production was enhanced. These results suggest that the IL-6 production may be downregulated by endogenously produced IL-10 and that IL-10 may downregulate cytokine production by HIV-activated monocytes via an autoregulatory mechanism.
