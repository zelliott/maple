In the majority of cases of fulminant "viral" hepatitis in Australia, no known aetiological agent can be isolated. We have examined the possible role of the recently discovered hepatitis G virus (HGV) in such cases.

An HGV specific reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on pre- and post-liver transplant serum from 14 patients who were referred for transplantation at our unit between 1989 and 1995 for unexplained fulminant hepatic failure. Eleven patients successfully underwent transplantation and three died while waiting for a suitable donor organ. Hepatitis viruses A-E were excluded by standard serological and PCR based testing. HGV RT-PCR was also performed on 21 other, randomly selected, liver transplant recipients ("controls").

The 14 fulminant cases were HGV RT-PCR negative prior to transplantation while five of 21 controls were positive. Post-transplant, eight of the 11 fulminant patients were found to be HGV RT-PCR positive and the same five controls remained HGV RT-PCR positive. In three of the eight fulminant patients the HGV infection resolved.

Our data indicate that HGV infection is unlikely to be responsible for fulminant hepatitis and that it is probably acquired from blood and/or blood products during the transplantation process. Furthermore, long-term carriage of HGV post-transplant is not associated with clinically apparent liver disease.
