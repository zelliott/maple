The Bradyrhizobium japonicum hupT gene was sequenced, and its gene product was found to be homologous to NtrB-like histidine kinases. A hupT mutant expresses higher levels of hydrogenase activity than the wild-type strain under hydrogenase-inducing conditions (i.e., microaerobiosis plus hydrogen, or symbiosis), whereas in noninduced hupT cells, hupSL expression is derepressed but does not lead to hydrogenase activity. We conclude that HupT is involved in the repression of HupSL synthesis at the transcriptional level but that enzymatic activation requires inducing conditions.
