Arylsulfatase B (ARSB) is the lysosomal enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of 4-sulfate groups from N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate moieties on the glycosaminoglycans, dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate A. In man, a deficiency of this enzymatic activity causes the lysosomal storage disorder, Maroteaux-Lamy disease (mucopolysaccharidosis Type VI; MPS VI). MPS VI in Siamese cats also has been described, and the comparative pathologic and biochemical abnormalities of the human and feline disorders have been well characterized. The present study describes the isolation and expression of cDNAs encoding feline ARSB and the assignment of the feline ARSB gene to feline chromosome A1. The full-length feline ARSB cDNA sequence is 1939 bp, including 3 and 328 bp of 5' and 3' untranslated sequences, respectively, and a 1608-bp open reading frame encoding 535 amino acids. The predicted human and feline ARSB proteins are 91% identical and 94% similar. However, despite this high homology, the predicted feline ARSB polypeptide has nine cysteine residues, while the human enzyme has eight. The presence of the extra cysteine residue at position 451 in the feline enzyme may explain why feline ARSB is a homodimer and the human enzyme is a monomer. To facilitate comparative structure/function studies of the human and feline enzymes and to initiate somatic gene therapy trials in the MPS VI cats, a full-length feline ARSB cDNA was reconstructed from a 1440-bp partial cDNA and an ARSB fragment amplified from feline first-strand cDNA by the polymerase chain reaction. The functional integrity of this cDNA was demonstrated by transient expression in human embryonic kidney cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
