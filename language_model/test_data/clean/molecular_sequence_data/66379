Rett syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by mutations in the X-linked gene, methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2). The majority of cases are sporadic, but rarely germline mosaicism can lead to familial cases. Here, we report the first case where germline mosaicism for a MECP2 mutation has been shown in a man. He has two affected daughters who are half sisters, and both have the c.808delC mutation. We show that this mutation is present at a low level in DNA extracted from the patient's semen. This case has implications for genetic counseling, and pre-natal testing should be offered for the partners of men who have a daughter with Rett syndrome.
