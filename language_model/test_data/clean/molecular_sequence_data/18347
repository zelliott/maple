We have isolated and characterized human genomic clones containing an alpha enolase pseudogene which lacks introns and has the hallmarks of having been generated by reverse transcription. Two in-frame termination codons renders its coding region incapable of producing a functional protein. An Alu-like sequence is present in the region homologous to the 3' untranslated of the alpha enolase mRNA. Comparison of the two sequences shows that the pseudogene diverged from its functional counterpart about 14 million years ago and interestingly it is the only alpha enolase pseudogene present in the human genome. Chromosomal mapping locates the processed pseudogene to human chromosome 1, the same chromosome where the functional gene has been mapped.
