A DNA fragment containing the aroA(G) gene of Bacillus subtilis 168, encoding 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase-chorismate mutase, was cloned and sequenced. The N-terminus of the protein encoded by aroA(G) showed homology with chorismate mutase encoded by aroH of B. subtilis and with the chorismate mutase parts of proteins encoded by the pheA and tyrA genes of Escherichia coli. The C-terminus of the aroA(G) product has sequence similarity with 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate synthase of E. coli. It was shown that the proteins encoded by the aroA(G) gene of B. subtilis 168 and the aroA gene of B. subtilis ATCC 6051 Marburg strain are identical, so the observed differences in DAHP synthase activity from these two strains must result from other changes.
