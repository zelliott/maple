An H1N2 influenza virus was isolated from a pig during an outbreak of respiratory disease and abortion on an Indiana farm in November 1999. Results of phylogenetic analyses indicate that this virus is a reassortant between a recent classical H1 swine virus and the reassortant H3N2 viruses that have emerged among American pigs since 1998.
