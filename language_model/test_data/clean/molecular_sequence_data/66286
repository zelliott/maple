A representative set of amino acids with aliphatic 19F-labels has been characterized here, following up our previous compilation of NMR parameters for single 19F-substituents on aromatic side chains. Their isotropic chemical shifts, chemical shift tensor parameters, intra-molecular 19F dipole-dipole couplings and temperature-dependent T1 and T2 relaxation times were determined by solid state NMR on twelve polycrystalline amino acid samples, and the corresponding isotropic 19F chemical shifts and scalar couplings were obtained in solution. Of particular interest are amino acids carrying a trifluoromethyl-group, because not only the 19F chemical shift but also the intra-CF3 homonuclear dipolar coupling can be used for structural studies of 19F-labeled peptides and proteins. The CF3-groups are further compared with CH2F-, CD2F-, and CD3-groups, using both 19F and 2H NMR to describe their motional behavior and to examine the respective linebroadening effects of the protonated and deuterated neighbors. We have also characterized two unnatural amino acids in which a CF3-label is rigidly connected to the backbone by a phenyl or bicyclopentyl moiety, and which are particularly well suited for structure analysis of membrane-bound polypeptides. The 19F NMR parameters of the polycrystalline amino acids are compared with data from the correspondingly labeled side chains in synthetic peptides.
