RepA protein, essential for replication of plasmid Rts1, was found to bind in vivo immediately upstream of the repA promoter in studies with mini-Rts1 derivatives with deletions in the upstream region of repA. We constructed another series of repA mutants that would encode RepA derivatives containing oligopeptide substitutions in place of the carboxyl-terminal six amino acids. These modified RepA proteins could not activate ori (Rts1) at all and showed various degrees of incompatibility, or no incompatibility, toward a mini-Rts1 plasmid. These results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal six (or fewer) amino acids of RepA are important for exerting replication and incompatibility functions. One of the RepA derivatives, which showed an evident incompatibility without initiating replication, was examined for its ability to repress the repA gene.
