The 5' end including the start AUG codon has been defined for the human E1 alpha subunit of the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Considering conservative substitutions the amino acid sequence in the mitochondrial targeting sequence for the human clone is 73% identical to this sequence in rat and 84% identical to the bovine sequence. This peptide also shows similarity to the targeting sequence for the human beta subunit but not with targeting sequence for the other subunits of the complex.
