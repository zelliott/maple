The protooncogene src encodes two proteins, designated pp60c-src+ and pp60c-src.pp60c-src+ is expressed only in neurons, whereas pp60c-src is expressed in neuronal and nonneuronal cells. pp60c-src+ differs from pp60c-src in that it contains an insert of 6 amino acids. To study the evolutionary conservation of the 6-amino acid insert, the expression of pp60c-src+ in the brain of animals from different classes was assayed by using pp60c-src+-specific antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the insert. pp60c-src+ was detected only in the brain of mammals, birds, and reptiles, but not amphibians and fish, whereas pp60c-src was present in the brain of all animals tested, including lobster (invertebrate). These findings indicate that pp60c-src+ may play a role in events associated with higher brain function, such as neuronal plasticity.
