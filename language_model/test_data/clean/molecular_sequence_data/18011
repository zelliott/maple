In the RNA directed cell-free protein synthesizing system from E. coli, there is a problem of contaminating 3'-exonucleases which attack the mRNAs. Thus, we tried the following two methods to stabilize mRNAs against nucleases: (A) To use mRNAs having hairpin structures at their termini and (B) To hybridize mRNAs with small DNA fragments to the 3'-termini of mRNAs. It was found that degradation of a mRNA was inhibited by the method B rather than the method A in the translation system.
