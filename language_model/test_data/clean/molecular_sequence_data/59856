Milk lipid globules from humans, cows and rats contained a protein identified as adipocyte differentiation-related protein (ADRP) associated with the globule surface membrane material. This protein, previously believed to be specific to adipocytes, was a major constituent of the globule surface and was present in a detergent-insoluble complex that contained stoichiometric amounts of butyrophilin and xanthine oxidase. Identification of ADRP was by sequence similarity of tryptic peptides from cow and human proteins with the sequence inferred from the cDNA for mouse ADRP. The putative ADRP of lipid globules from cow, human and rat milk was recognized specifically by antisera raised against a peptide synthesized to duplicate the N-terminal 26 residues of the mouse protein. In homogenates of lactating mammary gland, ADRP was found only in endoplasmic reticulum and in lipid droplet fractions. ADRP was modified, apparently post-translationally, and one modification apparently was acylation, primarily with C14, C16 and C18 fatty acids. Two isoelectric variants of ADRP were present in cow globule membrane material. In vitro, ADRP served as a substrate for protein kinases associated with milk lipid globule membrane, but this protein did not seem to become phosphorylated intracellularly.
