Atrial and B-type natriuretic peptide (ANP and BNP) are cardiac hormones synthesized and secreted by the myoendocrine cells of the heart. They exert potent actions on body fluid balance. Since various body organs including the heart are under high physiological stress during water and food deprivation in the desert nomads, we intended to perform molecular biological and histological studies of ANP in the heart of the dromedary camel Camelus dromedarius. Initially, we isolated cDNAs encoding ANP from the atrium and BNP from the atrium and ventricle of the dromedary camel. Putative mature ANP, deduced from the cDNA sequence, was identical to that of human and pig ANP, but the putative mature BNP was more diverse and was most similar to pig BNP (94% identity). Thus, we used antisera raised against human ANP that did not cross-react with pig BNP in the subsequent immunohistochemical studies. The ANP-expressing myoendocrine cells are most concentrated in the right atrium, to a lesser extent in the left atrium, and almost absent in the left ventricle. The immuno-positive cells are scattered uniformly in each region and are characterized by the presence of immunoreactive granular deposits around the nucleus. The left atrium comprises some ramifications of conductive cells (Purkinje fibers), some of which also contained ANP-immunoreactive granules. At the electron microscopic level, myoendocrine cells possessed secretory granules primarily in the perinuclear zone and a well-developed Golgi apparatus. The present study is the first comprehensive report dealing with the molecular cloning and immunohistochemical localization of ANP in the heart of a desert dwelling mammal.
