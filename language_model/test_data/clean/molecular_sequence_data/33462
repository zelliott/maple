We examined the methanotrophs in the Trail Road Landfill soils, Ottawa, Ontario, through cultivation-independent molecular assay and the culturing approach. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of amplified methanotroph-specific 16S rDNA gene fragments revealed a more diverse type I (RuMP pathway) methanotrophic community than type II (serine pathway) in 17 soil samples taken along a 50 m transect. The type II methanotrophic community was less diverse, with the dominance of Methylocystis in almost all samples, and clustering with high similarity (85%-88%). Also, the results showed that the C/N ratio of soil organic matter could significantly affect the methanotrophic community structures. The DGGE results were supported by sequence analysis of cloned pmoA. Members of the genera Methylobacter (type I), Methylocaldum (type X), and Methylocystis (type II) appeared to be the dominant methanotrophs. From methanotrophic enrichments, we isolated type I Methylobacter sp., and 3 type II Methylocystis spp.,which appeared to be one of the dominant bacteria species in the soil sample from which isolates were obtained.
