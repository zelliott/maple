The utilization of maltose by Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was investigated. Glucose was used preferentially to maltose, when both substrates were present in the medium. Maltose phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) activity was detected in extracts prepared from cultures grown on maltose, but not glucose or sucrose, as the sole carbon source. Extract fractionation and PTS reconstitution experiments revealed that the specificity for maltose is contained entirely within the membrane in this organism. A putative gene system for the maltose PTS was identified (from the C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 genome sequence), encoding an enzyme II(Mal) and a maltose 6-phosphate hydrolase.
