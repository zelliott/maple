PNPase is a major exoribonuclease that plays an important role in the degradation, processing, and polyadenylation of RNA in prokaryotes and organelles. This phosphorolytic processive enzyme uses inorganic phosphate and nucleotide diphosphate for degradation and polymerization activities, respectively. Its structure and activities are similar to the archaeal exosome complex. The human PNPase was recently localized to the intermembrane space (IMS) of the mitochondria, and is, therefore, most likely not directly involved in RNA metabolism, unlike in bacteria and other organelles. In this work, the degradation, polymerization, and RNA-binding properties of the human PNPase were analyzed and compared to its bacterial and organellar counterparts. Phosphorolytic activity was displayed at lower optimum concentrations of inorganic phosphate. Also, the RNA-binding properties to ribohomopolymers varied significantly from those of its bacterial and organellar enzymes. The purified enzyme did not preferentially bind RNA harboring a poly(A) tail at the 3' end, compared to a molecule lacking this tail. Several site-directed mutations at conserved amino acid positions either eliminated or modified degradation/polymerization activity in different manners than observed for the Escherichia coli PNPase and the archaeal and human exosomes. In light of these results, a possible function of the human PNPase in the mitochondrial IMS is discussed.
