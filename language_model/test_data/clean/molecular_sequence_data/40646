The activity of the human enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) varies greatly between individuals because of genetic polymorphism. TPMT is involved in the detoxification and activation of thiopurines such as 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, and azathioprine. These drugs are used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and inflammatory bowel disease. A total of 29 sequence variants have been identified so far in the TPMT gene. However, most of these variants are rare and not fully characterized.

In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel TPMT sequence variant, originally found in a Swedish man of Italian origin. Sequencing of the variable number tandem repeats region of the TPMT promoter and exons III-X revealed a T-to-C transition at nucleotide 611, causing an amino acid substitution from isoleucine to threonine at amino acid 204, positioned in an α-helix, approximately 16 Å from the active site. This new variant was found in the patient and in his son. Both had intermediate enzyme activity (8.1 U/ml packed red blood cells and 8.8 U/ml packed red blood cells, respectively) and neither carried other variants in the coding region of the gene. To be able to study this variant in more detail, the TPMT*28 variant was expressed in Escherichia coli, and an in-vitro characterization of the variant revealed that the protein was destabilized and showed a stronger tendency towards degradation at 37°C than the wild-type protein. The individuals carrying the TPMT*28 variant had less TPMT protein and lower TPMT activity in both red and white blood cells compared with a wild-type control.

We present a detailed in-vivo and in-vitro characterization of a novel TPMT sequence variant (TPMT*28) causing decreased TPMT activity. Individuals carrying TPMT*28 might have an increased risk for developing severe side effects if treated with conventional doses of thiopurines.
