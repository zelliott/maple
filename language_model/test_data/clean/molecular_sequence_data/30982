Comparative nucleotide sequence analyses of the genome of Sendai virus (strain Z) and two host range mutants, ts-f1 and F1-R, previously described revealed that the ts defect of ts-f1 can be attributed to two nucleotide exchanges in the NP gene. These exchanges lead to a single amino acid substitution. A single base pair change was found in both the P and L genes of F1-R, but not of ts-f1. Both host range mutants have the two same exchanges in the M gene. These additional mutations are discussed concerning their significance in the pantropic properties of the host range mutants.
