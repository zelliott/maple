Here we report the sequence of 569,202 base pairs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome V. Analysis of the sequence revealed a centromere, two telomeres and 271 open reading frames (ORFs) plus 13 tRNAs and four small nuclear RNAs. There are two Tyl transposable elements, each of which contains an ORF (included in the count of 271). Of the ORFs, 78 (29%) are new, 81 (30%) have potential homologues in the public databases, and 112 (41%) are previously characterized yeast genes.
