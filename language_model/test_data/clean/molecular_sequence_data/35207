To clone an A3IP gene and investigate its cellular and histological localization based on previous research which has identified part of A3IP sequence interacting with carboxyl-terminal of ataxin-3.

Bioinformatic and Northern blotting were applied to clone the A3IP gene and detect the expression of its transcripts in various human tissues and brain regions. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were applied to detect expression of A3IP protein in cultured cells. Immunohistochemistry staining was applied to study the expression of A3IP protein in various human tissues and brain regions.

cDNA cloning of A3IP gene's reading frame and its sequence assembly were completed. Three transcripts (1 kb, 1.35 kb and 6 kb, respectively) of A3IP were found to express in various human tissues and brain regions. A3IP pEGFP expresses in cytoplasm of cultured COS-7 cells and various human tissues and brain regions including cerebral cortex, cerebellum, muscle, peripheral nerve, liver and kidney.

The cloned A3IP gene encodes A3IP, a novel ataxin-3 interacting protein. Three transcripts of A3IP are expressed in various human tissues and brain regions. A3IP is a cytosolic protein.
