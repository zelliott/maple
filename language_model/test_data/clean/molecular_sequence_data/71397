In the T(1:2)dor(var7) multibreak rearrangement the distal 1A-2B segment of the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster is juxtaposed to an inverted portion of the heterochromatin of chromosome 2. Analysis of mitotic chromosomes by a series of banding techniques has permitted us precisely to locate the heterochromatic breakpoint of this translocation in the h42 region of 2R. Cloning and sequencing of the eu-heterochromatic junction revealed that the translocated 1A-2B fragment is joined to (AACAC)n repeats, which represent a previously undescribed satellite DNA in D. melanogaster. These repeated sequences have been estimated to account for about 1 Mb of the D. melanogaster genome. The repeats are located mainly in the Y chromosome and in the heterochromatin of the right arm of chromosome 2 (2Rh), where they are colocalized with the Stalker retrotransposon.
