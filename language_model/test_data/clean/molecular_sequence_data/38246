This paper describes our finding on overlapping genes in Methanococcus jannaschii genome. We found that one of the open reading frames (ORFs) within the M. jannaschii genome contains the nucleotide sequence of tRNA(Ser), which raises a serious question of the correctness of the initiation codon assignment for that ORF. We suggest that there are two other possible AUG initiation codons downstream from the TTG triplet, which was initially considered as a translation start site. Only one of the AUG triplets is preceded by the Shine-Dalgarno sequence that seems to be required for binding the ribosome and initiation of translation.
