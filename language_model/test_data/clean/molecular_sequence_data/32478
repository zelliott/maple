Here we have tested the inhibitory activity of the late untranslated region (UTR) of nine different human papillomavirus (HPV) types representing three different genera and six different species. These HPVs include both low-risk and high-risk types. We found that the late UTR of the various HPVs all displayed inhibitory activity, although they inhibited gene expression to various extent. The late UTR from the two distantly related HPV types 1 and 16, which are two different species that belong to different genera, each interacted with a 55 kDa protein. This protein cross-linked specifically to both HPV-1 and HPV-16 late UTR, although it bound more strongly to HPV-16 than to HPV-1, which correlated with the higher inhibitory activity of the HPV-16 late UTR. Mutagenesis experiments revealed that inactivation of two UGUUUGU motifs in the HPV-16 late UTR or two UAUUUAU motifs in the HPV-1 late UTR resulted in loss of binding of p55. In summary, these results demonstrate that the presence inhibitory elements encoding PuU(3-5)Pu-motifs in the HPV late UTR is a conserved property of different HPV types, species and genera, and suggest that these elements play an important role in the viral life cycle.
