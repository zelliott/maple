Nectins are members of the Ig superfamily that mediate cell-cell adhesion through homophilic and heterophilic interactions. We have determined the crystal structure of the nectin-2 homodimer at 1.3 Ã… resolution. Structural analysis and complementary mutagenesis studies reveal the basis for recognition and selectivity among the nectin family members. Notably, the close proximity of charged residues at the dimer interface is a major determinant of the binding affinities associated with homophilic and heterophilic interactions within the nectin family. Our structural and biochemical data provide a mechanistic basis to explain stronger heterophilic versus weaker homophilic interactions among these family members and also offer insights into nectin-mediated transinteractions between engaging cells.
