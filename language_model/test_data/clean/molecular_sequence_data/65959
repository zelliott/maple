We cloned a full-length cDNA encoding vitellogenin (VTG) from a marine teleost, the Japanese sillago Sillago japonica. The cloned sillago VTG contained signal peptide, lipovitellin heavy chain, phosvitin, lipovitellin light chain, and beta'-component in the order from the N-terminus. An exposure to 17beta-estradiol significantly increased the levels of plasma VTG, but not hepatic VTG mRNA in males. Neither plasma VTG nor hepatic VTG mRNA levels were affected by the exposure to 4-tert-octylphenol. Hepatic VTG mRNA levels in males increased at 1 day after intraperitoneal administration of 17beta-estradiol but decreased in the subsequent 5 days. However, plasma VTG levels remained high for 5 days after administration, suggesting that the accumulation period of plasma VTG is longer than that of hepatic VTG mRNA in males. Therefore, VTG mRNA may be a suitable indicator of temporal exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the environment, whereas plasma VTG is useful to detect consecutive exposure.
