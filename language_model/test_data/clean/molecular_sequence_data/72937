The deduced amino acid sequence of Leishmania major sw3 cDNA reveals the presence of characteristic histone H1 amino acid motifs. However, the open reading frame is of an unusually small size for histone H1 (105 amino acids) because it lacks the coding potential for the central hydrophobic globular domain of linker histones present in other eukaryotes. Here, we provide biochemical evidence that the SW3 protein is indeed a L. major nuclear histone H1, and that it is differentially expressed during the life cycle of the parasite. Due to its high lysine content, the SW3 protein can be purified to a high degree from L. major nuclear lysates with 5% perchloric acid, a histone H1 preparative method. Using an anti-SW3 antibody, this protein is detected as a 17 kDa or as a 17/19 kDa doublet in the nuclear subfraction in different L. major strains. The nuclear localization of the SW3 protein is further supported by immunofluorescence studies. During in vitro promastigote growth, both the sw3 cytoplasmic mRNA and its protein progressively accumulate within parasites from early log phase to stationary phase. Within amastigotes, the high level of H1 expression is maintained but decreases when amastigotes differentiate into promastigotes. Together, these observations suggest that the different levels of this histone H1 protein could influence the varying degrees of chromatin condensation during the life-cycle of the parasite, and provide us with tools to study this mechanism.
