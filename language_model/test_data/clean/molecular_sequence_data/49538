The solid phase synthesis of a 59 amino acid human salivary protein IB7 has been accomplished using Fmoc strategy. Because the protein contains 25 proline, 13 glycine and 9 glutamine residues the coupling time, piperidine delivery and acetic anhydride reaction time were increased. Yield after HPLC purification was 35%. Circular dichroism studies revealed that about one third of IB7 residues adopted a type II helix secondary structure, as found in collagen helices. The rest of the sequence adopts a random coil secondary structure.
