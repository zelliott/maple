Sexual communication between male and female fireflies involves the visual detection of bioluminescence. In the present study, we isolated two different types of opsin cDNAs from an adult of the Japanese firefly, Luciola cruciata. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these genes correspond to long wavelength-sensitive and ultraviolet-sensitive opsins. This is in agreement with the prior findings, in which the spectral sensitivity of the L. cruciata eye showed two peaks, UV and long wavelength, and the latter substantially matched the bioluminescent spectrum of lambdamax=560 nm. Diel changes in both opsins mRNA levels were determined by quantitative PCR analysis. In adult females, the mRNA level of long wavelength-sensitive opsin was higher at night than in the day, and peaked at 20:00, the time when the luminescence behavior was most active. On the other hand, the expression level of ultraviolet-sensitive opsin was not significantly changed during the day. In adult males, diel changes in the expression of both opsins were not significant. The results suggest that the expression level of "bioluminescence-sensitive" opsins in female L. cruciata is linked to their mating behavior.
