Two novel bioactive peptides were purified from skin secretions of the toad Bombina maxima. The partial N-terminal sequences of these two peptides were determined by automated Edman degradation. This allowed the cloning of full-length cDNAs encoding these two peptides from a cDNA library prepared from the toad skin. The deduced complete amino acid sequences indicate that both peptides are composed of 77 amino acids. A FASTA search in the databanks revealed that they exhibit 86-91% sequence identity with Bv8, a peptide originally isolated from skin secretions of Bombina variegata. They were thus named as Bv8-like peptide 1 (Bv8-LP1) and Bv8-like peptide 2 (Bv8-LP2), respectively. Sequence differences between Bv8-LP1 and 2 were due to six amino acid substitutions at positions 6, 11, 23, 24, 62 and 63. Bv8-LP1 and 2 differed from Bv8 with eleven and seven amino acid substitutions, respectively. Like Bv8, Bv8-LP1 and 2 possessed contractile activity on isolated guinea pig ileum. Additionally, they stimulated contraction of rabbit aortic rings in a dose-dependent manner at nanomolar concentrations.
