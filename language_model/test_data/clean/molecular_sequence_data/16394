We describe here two additional DRB1 alleles found in two Caucasoid recipient candidates for organ transplant and a new DRB3 allele found in a Caucasoid unrelated bone marrow donor from the German file. HLA-DRB generic and allele typing were performed using commercial kits, subsequently exon 2 was sequenced. We found a DRB1*010101 with a silent mutation at codon 68 and a DRB1*0306 with a mutation at codon 38 (T-C) which causes an amino acid substitution from Val to Ala. DRB3*0219 differs from DRB3*020201 by two-point mutations at codons 60 and 74 (A/C and A/G, respectively). These mutations at positions 266 and 308 were responsible for two amino acid substitutions (Tyr to Ser and Gln to Arg).
