9-[2-(phosphonomethylcarbonylamino)ethyl]adenine, 9-[(2-phosphonoethyl)aminocarbonylmethyl]adenine, 9-[2-[(2-phosphonoethyl)carbonylamino]ethyl]adenine, and their diphosphates were synthesized. All three diphosphates were shown to incorporate into the 3'-terminus of the DNA chain during the synthesis of the avian myeloblastosis virus catalyzed by reverse transcriptase. However, they do not serve as substrates for DNA polymerase alpha from human placenta, polymerase beta from calf thymus, or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase from calf thymus.
