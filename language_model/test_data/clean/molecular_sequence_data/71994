Two cDNAs clones (Cel1 and Cel2) encoding divergent endo-beta-1, 4-glucanases (EGases) have been isolated from a cDNA library obtained from ripe strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch) fruit. The analysis of the amino acid sequence suggests that Cel1 and Cel2 EGases have different secondary and tertiary structures and that they differ in the presence of potential N-glycosylation sites. By in vitro translation we show that Cel1 and Cel2 bear a functional signal peptide, the cleavage of which yields mature proteins of 52 and 60 kD, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Cel2 EGase diverged early in evolution from other plant EGases. Northern analysis showed that both EGases are highly expressed in fruit and that they have different temporal patterns of accumulation. The Cel2 EGase was expressed in green fruit, accumulating as the fruit turned from green to white and remaining at an elevated, constant level throughout fruit ripening. In contrast, the Cel1 transcript was not detected in green fruit and only a low level of expression was observed in white fruit. The level of Cel1 mRNA increased gradually during ripening, reaching a maximum in fully ripe fruit. The high levels of Cel1 and Cel2 mRNA in ripe fruit and their overlapping patterns of expression suggest that these EGases play an important role in softening during ripening. In addition, the early expression of Cel2 in green fruit, well before significant softening begins, suggests that the product of this gene may also be involved in processes other than fruit softening, e.g. cell wall expansion.
