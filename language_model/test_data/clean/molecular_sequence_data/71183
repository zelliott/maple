A salmonid olfactory system-specific protein (N24) that has been identified in lacustrine sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) was characterized by biochemical and molecular biological techniques. N24 is a homodimer, and the intact molecular mass is estimated as approximately 43.3 kDa by gel filtration. Furthermore, N24 was located only in the cytosolic fraction of the olfactory tissues as determined by subcellular fractionation. cDNA encoding the lacustrine sockeye salmon N24 was isolated and sequenced. This cDNA contained a coding region encoding 216 amino acid residues and the molecular mass of this protein is calculated to be 242,224.77. The protein and nucleotide sequencing demonstrates the existence of a remarkable homology between N24 and glutathione S-transferase (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) class pi enzymes. Northern analysis showed that N24 mRNA with a length of 950 bases is expressed in lacustrine sockeye salmon olfactory epithelium. Olfactory receptor cells showed strong hybridization signals for N24 mRNA in the olfactory epithelium. N24 demonstrated glutathione binding activity in affinity-purified GST column experiments. The present study describes for the first time cDNA cloning of GST in fish olfactory epithelium.
