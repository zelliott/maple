The discovery of a novel, cap-independent mechanism of translation used by picornavirus mRNAs has led to new advances in the engineering of mammalian expression vectors. It is now possible to express several proteins in a coordinate fashion from a single mRNA. Improved expression vectors suitable for virus-mediated transfer and direct DNA transfer are described.
