There is today a blatant need for new antifungal agents, because of the recent increase in life-threatening infections involving an ever-greater number of fungal strains. Fungi make extensive use of kinases in the regulation of essential processes, in particular the cell cycle. Most fungal kinases, however, are shared with higher eukaryotes. Only the kinases which have no human homologs, such as the histidine kinases, can be used as targets for antifungal drugs design. This review describes efforts directed towards the discovery of drugs active against a novel target, the atypical cell cycle kinase, Civ1.
