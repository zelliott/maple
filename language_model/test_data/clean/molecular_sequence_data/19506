With manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD) expressed in silkworm larvae, Bomby mori L, we investigated the effects of silkworm larvae powder containing SOD on the immune system of mouse and employed a proteomics approach to examine this phenomenon. Our data on the effects of continuous treatment with SOD-containing silkworm larvae powder showed that the ConA-stimulated splenocyte proliferation of all three treated groups was higher than that of the control. The results of PFC assay also revealed that antibody production was higher in all three treated groups than controlled mice. We investigated the phagocytosis of mouse macrophages. The SOD treatment led to a dose-dependent increase of phagocytic activity. We identified six proteins that related to immunity of mice. The data showed all these six matched proteins related immunity presented the increase of expression level in plasma of mouse administrated with silkworm powder including SOD compared to that of control. These findings demonstrate that administration of silkworm larvae powder containing SOD results in enhancement of immunity activities in the mouse. The results also suggested that the SOD expressed in silkworm maybe have potential application in medicine.
