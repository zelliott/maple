To gain insight into the regulation of hmi-er1 expression, we cloned a human genomic DNA fragment containing one of the two hmi-er1 promoters and consisting of 1460 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon of hMI-ER1. Computer-assisted sequence analysis revealed that the hmi-er1 promoter region contains a CpG island but lacks an identifiable TATA element, initiator sequence and downstream promoter element. This genomic DNA was able to direct transcription of a luciferase reporter gene in a variety of human cell lines, and the minimal promoter was shown to be located within-68/+144 bp. Several putative Sp1 binding sites were identified, and we show that Sp1 can bind to the hmi-er1 minimal promoter and increase transcription, suggesting that the level of hmi-er1 expression may depend on the availability of Sp1 protein. Functional analysis revealed that hMI-ER1 represses Sp1-activated transcription from the minimal promoter by a histone deacetylase-independent mechanism. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that both Sp1 and hMI-ER1 are associated with the chromatin of the hmi-er1 promoter and that overexpression of hMI-ER1 in cell lines that allow Tet-On-inducible expression resulted in loss of detectable Sp1 from the endogenous hmi-er1 promoter. The mechanism by which this occurs does not involve binding of hMI-ER1 to cis-acting elements. Instead, we show that hMI-ER1 physically associates with Sp1 and that endogenous complexes containing the two proteins could be detected in vivo. Furthermore, hMI-ER1 specifically interferes with binding of Sp1 to the hmi-er1 minimal promoter as well as to an Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide. Deletion analysis revealed that this interaction occurs through a region containing the SANT domain of hMI-ER1. Together, these data reveal a functional role for the SANT domain in the action of co-repressor regulatory factors and suggest that the association of hMI-ER1 with Sp1 represents a novel mechanism for the negative regulation of Sp1 target promoters.
