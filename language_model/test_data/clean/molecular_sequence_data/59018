The Na+/H+ exchanger is a widely distributed integral membrane protein that is responsible for pH regulation in mammalian tissues. We have cloned and analyzed the NHE1 isoform of the mouse genomic Na+/H+ exchanger. A clone from a mouse genomic library contained the NHE1 promoter region and the 5'-untranslated region. It also contained the first 121 amino acids of the coding region of the Na+/H+ exchanger. A splice site occurred after amino acid 121, at the same region as in the human NHE1 gene. The deduced amino terminal coding sequence was 76 and 88% identical to the human and rat NHE1 sequences respectively. The 5'-untranslated region was highly homologous to that of other species and two minicistrons contained in the human Na+/H+ exchanger were present in the mouse sequence. The results show that the deduced protein sequence of the mouse NHE1 gene has a high level of homology with other species and that the splice site of the first intron is conserved. These results suggest that the first large intron may play an important role in the NHE1 gene expression.
