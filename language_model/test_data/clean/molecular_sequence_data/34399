The aim of the present study was to characterize 24 isolates of group C rotavirus (RV-C) by analysis of DNA sequences of the VP4, VP6, VP7 and NSP4 genes of several Brazilian states.

All RV-C strains were confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were characterized by sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the genes encoding NSP4, VP6, VP4, and VP7 proteins.

Analysis of the NSP4 gene from Brazilian strains revealed that the isolates are more closely related to each other than to those of other strains previously published. The VP6 gene showed high homology to Indian strains. The sequences of VP4 and VP7 genes showed two lineages circulating in Brazil in the same region and at the same time.

These results confirm the transmission of RV-C in Brazil. RV-C infection appears to occur occasionally despite the low detection rate of the virus.
