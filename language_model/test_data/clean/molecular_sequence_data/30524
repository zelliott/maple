A basic protein (pI 10.3), named basic protein II, was purified to homogeneity from the venom of Trimeresurus flavoviridis (Habu snake) after four chromatographic steps. The amino acid sequence of this protein was determined by sequencing the S-pyridylethylated derivative and its peptides produced by chemical (cyanogen bromide) and enzymatic (chymotrypsin, clostripain, and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease) cleavages. The protein consisted of 122 amino acid residues and was found to be identical in sequence to basic protein I from the same source except that Asp-58 of basic protein I is replaced by asparagine. Like basic protein I, the structural feature of basic protein II is that Tyr-28 and Asp-49 common in phospholipases A2 from snake venoms and mammalian pancreas are replaced by asparagine and lysine, respectively. Thus, basic protein II belongs to the category of lysine-49-phospholipase A2. The action of basic protein II on 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine released only oleic acid, indicating that it has phospholipase A2 activity. Its molar activity toward 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine, however, was only 1.7% of that of T. flavoviridis phospholipase A2 isolated previously. Affinity for Ca2+ and reactivity toward p-bromophenacyl bromide of basic protein II were 8 and 5.3 times, respectively, smaller than those of phospholipase A2 from the same source, substantiating the low phospholipase A2 activity of basic protein II.
