Amino acid sequence variations have possible influences on the allergenicity of allergens and may be important factors in allergen standardization. This study was undertaken to investigate the sequence polymorphisms of group 1 and 2 allergens from Korean isolates of the house dust mites Dermatophagoides farinae and D. pteronyssinus. cDNA sequences encoding group 1 and 2 allergens were amplified by RT-PCR and compared the deduced amino acid sequences. Der f 1.0101, which appeared in 64.0 % of the 50 sequences analyzed, was found to be predominant. Among the Der p 1 sequences, Der p 1.0102 and 1.0105 were predominant (58 %). Among the Der f 2 sequences, Der f 2.0102 (40.7 %) and a new variant with Gly at position 42 (27.8 %) were predominant. The deduced amino acid sequences of 60 Der p 2 clones were examined, and 28 variants with 1-5 amino acid substitutions were found. Interestingly, all of the Der p 2 sequences had Thr instead of Lys at position 49. Two variants (Leu40, Thr49, and Asn114 (26.6 %); Val40, Thr49, and Asn114 (20.0 %)) were found to be the most predominant forms of Der p 2. Der p 1 has a high rate of sporadic substitutions and the group 2 allergens show a more regular pattern with orderly associations of amino acid substitutions. Der f 1 and Der p 2 from Korean mite isolates have unique amino acid sequence polymorphisms. These findings provide important data for house dust mite allergen standardization.
