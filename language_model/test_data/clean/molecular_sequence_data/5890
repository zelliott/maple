Rf8 is a newly described nuclear gene that can substitute for Rf1 to partially restore pollen fertility to male-sterile, T-cytoplasm maize. Families segregating for Rf8 were used to investigate the mechanism of this fertility restoration and to compare it to the restoration conditioned by Rf1. Although Rf8 is unlinked to the rf1 locus, it also alters T-urf13 mitochondrial transcript accumulation and reduces the accumulation of the URF13 protein. Like the 1.6- and 0.6-kilobase (kb) T-urf13 transcripts that accumulate in T-cytoplasm plants carrying Rf1, 1.42- and 0.42-kb transcripts accumulate in plants that are partially restored by Rf8. A survey of T-cytoplasm maize lines, inbreds, and F1 hybrids by mitochondrial RNA gel blot analyses revealed that Rf8 is rare in maize germplasm. These surveys revealed the presence of another rare, weak restorer factor, Rf*, which is uniquely associated with the accumulation of 1.4- and 0.4-kb T-urf13 transcripts. Primer extension analyses position the 5' termini of the 1.42/0.42-kb and 1.4/0.4-kb transcripts at +137 and +159 nucleotides, respectively, 3' of the AUG initiation codon of the T-urf13 reading frame. The conserved motif, 5'-CNACNNU-3', overlaps the 5' termini of the Rf1-, Rf8-, and Rf*-associated transcripts and the 380 nucleotide, Rf3-associated orf107 transcript from cytoplasmic male sterility sorghum. These results demonstrate that multiple unlinked, nuclear genes can have similar but distinct effects on the expression of the unique T-urf13 mitochondrial coding sequence to restore pollen fertility to T-cytoplasm maize.
