Haptoglobin is an acute-phase protein and its plasma levels increase consistently in response to infection and inflammation. Some evidence has demonstrated that haptoglobin is involved in the immune responses. In this study, we established a novel high-performance liquid chromatographic purification procedure for porcine plasma haptoglobin. The procedure required an ammonium sulfate fractionation and a HPLC Superose 12 gel-permeation chromatography. Purified porcine haptoglobin possessed one heavy (beta) and light chain (alpha) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, under reducing conditions, with a M(r) (molecular mass) of about 42,000 and 14,000 for heavy (beta) and light chains (alpha), respectively. Although the N-terminal amino acid sequence of porcine heavy chain of haptoglobin has never been reported previously, the analyses of N-terminal amino acid sequence showed a great sequence similarity to that of human and other animal species. In addition, Western blot using our specific antibody prepared against porcine M(r) 42,000 chain did react with human haptoglobin and likewise, the antibody against human haptoglobin also cross-reacted with purified porcine M(r) 42,000 chain. Thus, it confirmed that the identity of the porcine protein purified from our procedures was as haptoglobin.
