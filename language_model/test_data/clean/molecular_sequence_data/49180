Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is the canonical member of the PARP family of enzymes and modulates many crucial nuclear functions. PARP-1 is involved in apoptosis and is the substrate of caspase-3, a protease that cleaves PARP-1 at the conserved sequence 211DEVD214. To generate a caspase-3-uncleavable PARP-1, we introduced an amino acid substitution D214-->A214 at the site of cleavage. We observed that following over-expression in bacteria, the mutant protein HIS-PARP-1D214A was expressed several-fold more than a unmutated copy, HIS-PARP-1. The specific activity of HIS-PARP-1 enzyme in total bacterial extracts was 6.94 U/mg and 4.61 U/mg for HIS-PARP-1D214A. This approach should provide new avenues for crystallographic study of PARP-1 as well as new information for drug design targeting PARP-1.
