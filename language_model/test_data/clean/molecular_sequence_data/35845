The abundant multifunctional protein ABF1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae binds to the upstream region of several genes, including some ribosomal protein genes like the one encoding protein S33. Deletion of the ABF1-binding sequence lowers the transcription of these genes three- to more than ten-fold. We have isolated the S33 genes of two related yeast species, Kluyveromyces lactis and Kluyveromyces marxianus. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of these S33 genes with their counterpart from S. cerevisiae shows a strong sequence similarity covering the whole of the coding regions. In contrast, little or no sequence similarity is found in the 5'-flanking regions of the three genes. Also the trailer regions differ considerably in both length and sequence from one species to another. An ABF1-binding site is present in the upstream region of the S33 gene of K. marxianus. Retardation analyses showed that this sequence is able to bind a protein present in Kluyveromyces cells with a molecular mass somewhat lower than that of S. cerevisiae ABF1. Functional analyses, using a beta-glucuronidase reporter system, showed that the ABF1-binding site is indeed involved in transcription activation of the K. marxianus S33 gene in Kluyveromyces cells. A S. cerevisiae ABF1-gene-specific probe showed only weak hybridization with Kluyveromyces DNA and Northern blots did not show a signal. These results indicate that S. cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces contain functionally related but structurally dissimilar ABF1-type proteins.
