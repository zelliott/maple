Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2 (MEF2) proteins are a small family of transcription factors that play pivotal role in morphogenesis and myogenesis of skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells. In vertebrates, there are four MEF2 genes, referred to as MEF2A, -B, -C, and -D, that are located on different chromosomes. After birth MEF2A, MEF2B, MEF2D transcriptions are expressed ubiquitously, whereas MEF2C transcripts are restricted to skeletal muscle, brain, and spleen. In this study, on the basis of the sequences of the bovine chromosome 7 genomic contig, available in the GenBank database, sets of PCR primers were designed and to amplify the bovine MEF2C gene promoter region, exon 1 (5'UTR) and part sequence of the intron 1. Seven overlapping fragments of the bovine MEF2C gene were amplified and then sequenced. Altogether, these fragments were composed in the 3,120-bp sequence which was deposited in the GenBank database under accession no. GU211007. The sequence fragment included the putative site of the promoter region and transcription start of the exon 1. The sequence analysis of these fragments in individual animals representing different Bos taurus breeds revealed four variations in promoter region: g.-1606C>T, g.-1336_-1335DelG, g.-818C>T, g.-613_-612DelA and four SNPs within intron 1: g.2711A>G, g. 2913A>G, g.2962G>T and g.3014A>G. No polymorphism was found within sequence of the exon 1 (5'UTR). These polymorphisms were identified for first time using these sequences and were confirmed by RFLP or MSSCP methods.
