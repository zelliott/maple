Mutacin-producing strains have been classified into 24 groups (designated by letters A to X) by similarity in activity spectra and cross-immunity. Similarity in primary structure among these groups can be revealed using DNA hybridization. The amino acid sequences of four mutacins (B-Ny266, 1140/mutacin III and mutacin II) were used to design two DNA probes in order to detect similar genes among groups of Streptococcus mutans strains demonstrating inhibitory activity. In addition to the appropriate parent strain, each probe hybridized with the total DNA from only two out of the 24 mutacin group type strains. Thus, the remaining 18 groups of strains produce mutacins that differ from the mutacins sequenced to date. In order to explore the similarity between genes coding for mutacins B-Ny266 and JH1140, the group B specific probe was utilized to detect a DNA fragment of 1.9 kb in the genome of S. mutans strain Ny266. The sequence of the cloned fragment codes for three open reading frames (lanA, lanA' and lanB) similar to those of strains JH1140 and UA787. The gene lanA' is strongly similar to the structural gene lanA (67%), but only one RNA transcript of about 300 bases was detected by Northern hybridization using the lanA-lanA' probe. Transcription of lanA alone was verified by RT-PCR.
