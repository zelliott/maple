With one quarter of the population of the Western world now considered obese, it is essential that we understand the factors giving rise to elevated fat deposition. This review summarizes the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing the volume of white adipose tissue (WAT), and outlines the physiological signals that regulate these processes. Particular attention is given to the role of the gastric hormone, ghrelin, describing its actions in general and presenting detailed evidence of its role in regulating adipocyte biology. Combining this evidence with an analysis of the factors governing ghrelin secretion, leads to the hypothesis that during periods of food deprivation ghrelin acts as an energy deficit signal, defending the fat stored in responsive WAT against the forces of utilization. This scenario has clear implications for programmes of sustainable weight loss.
