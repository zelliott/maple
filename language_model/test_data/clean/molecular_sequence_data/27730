We have isolated four lambda-phages covering the complete pig aminopeptidase N/CD13 gene. The sequence of 2.85 kbp encompasses 1.18 kbp of the 5' upstream region and 1.67 kbp of the structural gene. In the promoter region we find a TATA box and potential binding sites for CTF-1/NF-1 and AP-2. By sequence comparisons we have found three domains showing similarity to promoter regions of the genes encoding human alpha 1-antitrypsin and human intestinal alkaline phosphatase. The gene sequence includes the first three exons and two introns. It shows that a single exon encodes the cytoplasmic tail, the membrane anchor and the junctional peptide.
