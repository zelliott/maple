Precursor forms of the alpha-subunit of inhibin are abundant in human follicular fluid and possibly plasma, although their function is uncertain. We now describe the development of a new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure inhibin forms containing both the pro and alpha C regions of the alpha-subunit. The assay has a detection limit for purified human pro-alpha C of 0.5 pg/mL and less than 0.02% cross-reaction with recombinant forms of inhibin, activin, and follistatin. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting of follicular fluid extracts demonstrated that the assay is likely to detect pro-containing precursor forms of both the free alpha-subunit and intact dimeric inhibin. The serum concentration was measured in normal men (446 +/- 28 pg/mL), postmenopausal women (45.8 +/- 3.8 pg/mL), and women treated with FSH before in vitro fertilization (1827 pg/mL). Pooled human follicular fluid contained 488 ng/mL. The mean serum concentration in the female menstrual cycle rose from 150.6 +/- 26.1 pg/mL in the early follicular phase to 692.2 +/- 113 pg/mL in the midluteal phase. This assay offers a useful tool for investigation of the role of inhibin-related proteins in human reproduction. There may be particular clinical value under circumstances in which other assays for inhibin forms have insufficient sensitivity.
