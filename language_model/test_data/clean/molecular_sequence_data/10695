The binding of iron by transferrin leads to a significant conformational change in each lobe of the protein. Numerous studies have shown that the transferrin receptor discriminates between iron-saturated and iron-free transferrin and that it modulates the release of iron. Given these observations, it seems likely that there is contact between each lobe of transferrin and the receptor. This is the case with chicken transferrin, in which it has been demonstrated unambiguously that both lobes are required for binding and iron donation to occur [Brown-Mason and Woodworth (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 1866-1873]. Further support to this contention is added by the ability of both N- and C-domain-specific monoclonal antibodies to block the binding of a solution containing both lobes [Mason, Brown and Church (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9011-9015]. In the present study a similar conclusion is reached for the binding of human serum transferrin to the transferrin receptor. With the use of recombinant N- and C-lobes of human transferrin produced in a mammalian expression system, we show that both lobes are required to achieve full binding. (Production of recombinant C-lobe in the baby hamster kidney cell system is reported here for the first time.) Each lobe is able to donate iron to transferrin receptors on HeLa S3 cells in the presence of the contralateral lobe. The results are not identical with the chicken system, because the C-lobe alone shows a limited ability to bind to receptors and to donate iron. Further complications arise from the relatively weak re-association between the two lobes of human transferrin compared with the re-association of the ovotransferrin lobes. However, domain-specific monoclonal antibodies to either lobe block the binding of N- and C-lobe mixtures in the human system, thus substantiating the need for both.
