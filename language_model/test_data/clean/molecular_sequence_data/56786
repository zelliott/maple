We present the full-length cDNA sequence of human T-protein of the glycine cleavage system. Overlapping cDNA clones were isolated by screening human liver cDNA libraries with bovine T-protein cDNA. The 1209 base pair open reading frame encodes 403 amino acid precursor protein, and the deduced amino acid sequence of the mature peptide shows 90 and 68% homology to that of bovine and chicken counterpart, respectively. RNA blot analysis of human liver transcripts and Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA confirm that human T-protein is encoded by a single gene.
