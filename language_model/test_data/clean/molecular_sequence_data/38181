We investigated subinterval 6E on the human Y chromosome, a region frequently deleted in infertile males. YAC yOX17, mapped within subinterval 6E by STS-PCR, was analyzed for the presence of new genes. TSPYq1, a member of the TSPY multi-copy gene family, was isolated and characterized from a yOX17 cosmid subclone. PCR and FISH analysis performed on normal subjects and on patients with microdeletions of Yq suggested the presence of multiple copies of TSPY in Yq.
