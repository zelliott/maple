We previously identified perchloric acid-soluble protein (PSP) in the rat liver, kidney, brain and lung, and reported that it appeared to be related to repression of cell proliferation. In the present study, we clarified that PSP was expressed in the intestine, and found that the amino acid sequence of the intestinal PSP was consistent with those of other PSPs present in other tissues. An immunohistochemical study revealed that PSP was expressed in enterocytes and goblet cells, but not in other cell types among the lamina propria epithelial cells. A comparison of the expressions of PSP and proliferating cell nuclear antigen demonstrated that the proliferating cells did not express PSP. Intestinal PSP expression was induced by approximately 3-fold by oral administration of dietary fat. These findings indicate that the proliferation repression activity may be related to renewal of the intestinal epithelium, and that PSP is one of the fatty acid-inducible proteins.
