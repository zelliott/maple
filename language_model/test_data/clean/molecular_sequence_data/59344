Bacterial integration host factors (IHFs) play central roles in the cellular processes of recombination, DNA replication, transcription, and bacterial pathogenesis. We describe here a novel mycobacterial IHF (mIHF) of Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis that stimulates integration of mycobacteriophage L5. mIHF is the product of a single gene and is unrelated at the sequence level to other integration host factors. By itself, mIHF does not bind preferentially to attP DNA, although it significantly alters the pattern of integrase (Int) binding, promoting the formation of specific integrase-mIHF-attP intasome complexes.
