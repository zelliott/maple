Recently, we have reported the identification of several genes that exhibit genetic interactions with the U5 snRNA. Two of these genes, SLU4 and SLU7 (SLU: synergistic lethal with U5 snRNA), encode products required for the second catalytic step of splicing. To analyze the specific roles of SLU4 and SLU7, we have determined how mutants influence the relative usage of competing 3' splice sites. We find that mutations in SLU7 eliminate the normal 20-fold preference for 3' splice sites located > 22 nucleotides downstream of the branchpoint. In contrast, mutations in SLU4 inhibit usage of all 3' splice sites, regardless of their location. This suggests that SLU7 is involved in the process of 3' splice site choice, whereas SLU4 fulfills a generic requirement for the second step. We show that SLU7 is an essential gene that contains a small motif with striking similarity to the cysteine-rich zinc knuckle of retroviral nucleocapsid proteins, which has been implicated in RNA binding. Mutational analysis of SLU7 indicates that this motif influences the efficiency, but not the sequence specificity, of 3' splice site selection. The identification of a component of the constitutive splicing machinery that can promote 3' splice site choice has potentially important implications for alternative splicing.
