Two polymorphic blood group systems (E and M) of the pig Sus scrofa L. and one blood group system (D) of the horse Equus caballus L. have been studied. On the basis of phenogroup analysis, models describing the formation of the complex allele spectra of these systems and reflecting the contributions of mutations and recombinations have been constructed. The complementary relationships between the antigens determined by the variants of supergenes within the systems, as ell as the probable number and relative positions of the subloci encoding individual groups of antigens in them, have been determined.
