In this research 26 Shigella isolates were examined by PCR and direct nucleotide sequencing for genetic alterations in the quinolone-resistance determining regions (QRDRs). We tested for the presence of qnr genes by PCR in 91 strains, but no qnr genes were found. The results did show, however, some novel mutations at codon 83 of gyrA (Ser-->Ile) and codon 64 of parC (Ala64-->Cys, Ala64-->Asp), which were related to fluroquinolone resistance.
