Chemical syntheses are reported for prostate specific antigen (PSA) N-linked glycopeptide fragments consisting of an uneicosapeptide (residues 27-47 of PSA) with di-, tri-, and tetrabranched N-acetyllactosamine-type glycans. The syntheses involve simultaneous, multiple glycosylations of the corresponding pentasaccharide acceptors prepared from a common trisaccharide precursor. Globally deprotected glycans are aminated and then aspartylated with a hexapeptide, which is then extended using native chemical ligation (NCL). The glycopeptides will be used for the generation of antibodies that may form the basis for a new prostate cancer diagnostic assay.
