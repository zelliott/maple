Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a pluripotent cytokine with its receptors distributed throughout many different cell types. Because of the diverse effects of the cytokine, it is difficult to clearly define its role in infection and immunity, and appreciate its clinical therapeutic value. We have identified peptides derived from the primary amino acid sequence of human TNF-alpha that have neutrophil-stimulating activity, as measured by enhanced chemiluminescence and superoxide production, and peptides which are both directly cytotoxic for tumour cells (WEHI-164) in vitro and also prevent TNF binding to tumour cells. However, only one of these neutrophil-stimulating peptides was toxic for tumour cells in vitro. Our results indicate that the region of amino acids 54-94 of human TNF-alpha has previously undescribed human neutrophil-stimulatory activity, while peptides encompassing the regions 43-68 and 132-150, which are in close proximity, as indicated in the recently determined three-dimensional structure of human TNF-alpha, have in vitro anti-tumour activity. These peptides also slowed tumour growth or induced tumour regression in WEHI-164 tumour-bearing mice. The peptide 73-94, which activated neutrophils but which was not cytotoxic for tumour cells in vitro, also caused in vivo tumour regression, presumably by activating neutrophils with the consequent release of free radicals at the tumour site. Peptide 63-83, which was able to activate neutrophils in vitro, did not possess tumour regression activity in vivo. The TNF peptides described in this report did not elicit procoagulant activity in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells and as such are devoid of at least one of the potentially lethal side-effects of elevated TNF levels in vivo.
