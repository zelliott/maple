The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the gene 4 of bovine rotavirus strain B223 is described. The open reading frame is predicted to encode a VP4 of 772 amino acids, shorter than described for any other rotavirus strain sequenced to date. B223 VP4 shows 70 to 73% similarity to other rotavirus VP4 proteins, demonstrating the presence of a unique VP4 type, and confirming a third VP4 allele in the bovine rotavirus population. Multiple sequence alignment with several other rotavirus strains created gaps in the sequence to account for a shorter VP4. The alignment shows a two contiguous amino acid deletions within the trypsin cleavage region of B223 VP4. Comparisons of two regions flanking the trypsin cleavage site, (aa 224 to 235, and aa 257 to 271) which show high homologies between strains, demonstrate that the region 5' to the trypsin cut site has a low homology (66%) to other rotavirus strains, although the region 3' to the trypsin cleavage site shows high homologies (86 to 93%) with other rotavirus strains. The lack of a conserved proline residue within the 5' flanking region suggests a possible altered local conformation of this site in B223 VP4. A second gap inserted into the VP4 of B223 on multiple sequence alignment is a three contiguous amino acid deletion at position 613-615 in the VP5* subunit. Previously defined biologic properties of this strain in relation to the determination of the amino acid composition of VP4 are discussed.
