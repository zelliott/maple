A Gram-negative, non-motile and rod-, oval- or coccoid-shaped bacterial strain, SD-15(T), was isolated from a tidal flat of the Yellow Sea, Korea. The novel strain, which was phylogenetically closely related to the genera Phaeobacter, Leisingera and Marinovum, was studied using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Strain SD-15(T) grew optimally at pH 7.0-8.0 and 30 degrees C in the presence of 2 % (w/v) NaCl. It contained Q-10 as the predominant ubiquinone and C(18 : 1)omega7c and 11-methyl C(18 : 1)omega7c as the major fatty acids. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and an unidentified lipid. The DNA G+C content was 63.4 mol%. Strain SD-15(T) exhibited the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values (95.1-96.4 %) to the type strains of species of the genus Phaeobacter, Leisingera methylohalidivorans MB2(T) and Marinovum algicola ATCC 51440(T). Strain SD-15(T) could be differentiated from members of the genera Phaeobacter, Leisingera and Marinovum by differences in the contents of some fatty acids, by the absence of aminolipid and by differences in some phenotypic properties. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data, strain SD-15(T) represents a new genus and novel species, for which the name Seohaeicola saemankumensis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of the type species is Seohaeicola saemankumensis SD-15(T) (=KCTC 22175(T)=CCUG 55328(T)).
