Novel thermophilic bacteria, designated strains VW1 and MM1(T), were isolated from hydrothermal fluid and microbial mat samples, respectively, collected from a shallow marine hydrothermal system (water depth 22 m) occurring in coral reefs off Taketomi Island, Okinawa, Japan. Cells of the two novel strains were motile rods with a single polar flagellum in the exponential growth phase. In a medium that included elemental sulfur, cells of the two strains became non-motile with oval to spherical cell shapes. For both strains, growth occurred at between 30 and 60 degrees C (optimum temperature of 50-55 degrees C; 60-80 min doubling time) and between pH 5.5 and 7.1 (optimum pH 6.0). The isolates were microaerobic chemolithoautotrophs capable of using thiosulfate or tetrathionate as the sole energy source, O(2) as the sole electron acceptor and CO(2) as the sole carbon source. Organic substrates, such as yeast extract and tryptone, inhibited growth of both strains. The G+C contents of genomic DNA were 51.3 and 49.5 mol% for strains VW1 and MM1(T), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the two strains were closely related to each other (99.9 % sequence similarity) and were distantly related to other previously described genera within the Gammaproteobacteria. The novel isolates could also be differentiated from other gammaproteobacterial genera on the basis of their physiological properties. It is suggested that the novel isolates represent the type species of a new genus, for which the name Sulfurivirga caldicuralii gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain MM1(T)=JCM 13439(T)=DSM 17737(T)) is proposed.
