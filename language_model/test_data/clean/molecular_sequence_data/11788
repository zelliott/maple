We report the DNA sequence of a segment located on the right arm of chromosome II from Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C near the subtelomeric sequences. The sequence was determined using a random cloning strategy followed by an oligonucleotide-directed sequencing. The segment contains four non-overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) YBR297w, YBR298c, YBR299w and YBR301c, and two overlapping ones (YBR300c and YBR300w). Three of them--YBR297w, YBR298c and YBR299w--are the MAL3R (transcriptional regulatory protein), MAL3T (maltose permease) and MAL3S (maltase) genes of the MAL3 locus previously localized. The three other ORFs are unidentified. Another MAL locus (MALl) has been localized on chromosome VII. The Mal- phenotype of strain S288c cannot be explained by telomeric silencing.
