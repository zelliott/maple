Mitochondrion plays the key functions in mammalian cells. It is believed that mitochondrion exerts the common biologic functions in many tissues, but also performs some specific functions correspondent with tissues where it is localized. To identify the tissue-specific mitochondrial proteins, we carried out a systematic survey towards mitochondrial proteins in the tissues of C57BL/6J mouse, such as liver, kidney and heart. The mitochondrial proteins were separated by 2DE and identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. Total of 87 unique proteins were identified as the tissue-specific ones, and some representatives were further verified through ICPL quantification and Western blot. Because these issue-specific proteins are coded from nuclear genes, real-time PCR was employed to examine the mRNA status of six typical genes found in the tissues.With combining of the expression data and the co-localization images obtained from confocal microscope, we came to the conclusion that the tissue-specifically mitochondrial proteins were widely distributed among the mouse tissues. Our investigation, therefore, indeed provides a solid base to further explore the biological significance of the mitochondrial proteins with tissue-orientation.
