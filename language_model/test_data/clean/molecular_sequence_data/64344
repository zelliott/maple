Three marine, heterotrophic, aerobic, agarolytic, pigmented and gliding bacteria were isolated in June 2000 from a sea water sample that was collected in the Gulf of Peter the Great, Sea of Japan, and analysed in a polyphasic taxonomic study. 16S rDNA sequence analysis indicated that strains KMM 3664(T), KMM 3669 and KMM 3915 were members of the family Flavobacteriaceae. Based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, genotypic and phylogenetic data, the isolates were classified in the genus Cellulophaga as members of a novel species, Cellulophaga pacifica sp. nov. The type strain is KMM 3664(T) (=JCM 11735(T)=LMG 21938(T)).
