Mice bearing the H-2w7 haplotype have five C4-related genes and constitutively express the Slp antigen. To understand the structure and evolution of the five C4-related genes of the C3H.W7 mouse, we have determined nucleotide sequences of the 5' end region of these genes. A C4/Slp hybrid nature was confirmed for three of five C4-related genes as predicted previously by restriction enzyme analysis. The nucleotide sequences of the 5' flanking regions of these three hybrid genes showed close similarity to that of the C4 gene, while the 3' side of the ninth exon of the three hybrid genes showed close similarity to that of the Slp gene. In contrast, the regions between the first exon and the middle of the ninth exon of the three hybrid genes showed a mosaic structure of C4-like and Slp-like sequences. Moreover, the boundaries of the C4-like and Slp-like sequences were quite different among the three hybrid genes. The pattern of nucleotide sequence diversity in this region among the five C4-related sequences could be mainly explained not by point mutations but by gene conversions or unequal crossovers. These results suggest that multiple genetic recombinational events between two homologous sequences played an important role in the generation and diversification of the extra copies of the C4/Slp gene in the H-2w7 mouse.
