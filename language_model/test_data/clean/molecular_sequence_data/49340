The angiopoietins are an important family of growth factors specific for vascular endothelium. Most of them bind to the TIE2 receptor and are related to regulation of angiogenesis. During large-scale DNA sequencing of the human fetal brain cDNA library, we cloned a novel human angiopoietin-like cDNA and termed it human angiopoietin-like 5 ( ANGPTL5). Like other members of the angiopoietin family, ANGPTL5-deduced protein also has an N-terminal cleavable signal peptide, a predicted coiled-coil domain, and a fibrinogen-like domain. The search against the human genome database indicated that ANGPTL5 maps to 11q22. Expression analysis of ANGPTL5 shows that it is mainly expressed in adult human heart.
