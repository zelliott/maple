Centralspindlin, which is composed of MgcRacGAP and MKLP1, is essential for central spindle formation and cytokinetic furrow ingression. MgcRacGAP utilizes its GAP domain to inactivate Rac1 and induce furrow ingression in mammalian cells. In this report, we present a novel regulatory mechanism for furrowing that is mediated by the phosphorylation of SHC SH2-domain binding protein 1 (SHCBP1), a binding partner of centralspindlin, by Aurora B (AurB). AurB phosphorylates Ser634 of SHCBP1 during mitosis. We generated a phosphorylation site mutant, S634A-SHCBP1, which was prematurely recruited to the central spindle during anaphase and inhibited furrowing. An in vitro GAP assay demonstrated that SHCBP1 can suppress the MgcRacGAP-mediated inactivation of Rac1. In addition, the inhibition of Rac1 activity rescued the furrowing defect induced by S634A-SHCBP1 expression. Thus, AurB phosphorylates SHCBP1 to prevent the premature localization of SHCBP1 to the central spindle and ensures that MgcRacGAP inactivates Rac1 to promote the ingression of the cytokinetic furrow.
