The complete genomic sequence of Lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage ФPYB5 was determined. The phage possesses a linear, double-stranded DNA genome of 32,847 bp with a G+C content of 45.21%. A total of 46 putative open reading frames (ORFs) were identified. On the basis of homology comparisons, 25 ORFs could be assigned putative functions. The genome of bacteriophage ФPYB5 is highly modular with functionally related genes clustered together. Genome DNA of temperate bacteriophage ФPYB5, induced from heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria, showed to be closely related to that of the prophage of heterofermentative Lactobacillus reuteri 100-23 and heterofermetative Leuconostoc oenos bacteriophage 10MC in an evolutionary aspect.
