The DNA sequence of a truncated cry1C gene encoding the active fragment of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) delta-endotoxin was fully reconstructed by introduction of silent mutations. Each of the truncated wild type and the synthetic genes encoding the active fragment of the protoxin was introduced into haploid tobacco plants under the control of the rbcS promoter. To facilitate selection of transgenic tobacco plants with high insecticidal activity, a fusion gene encoding both rat CYP1A1 cytochrome P450 and yeast NADPH-P450 oxidoreductase was cotransformed with the wild type cry1C gene. The synthetic gene elevated the levels of Cry1C protein and the mRNA in transgenic tobacco plants as well as mortality in Spodoptera litura larvae. The Cry1C protein was accumulated mainly in the leaf tissues of the transgenic tobacco plants. The results reported here imply that the green-tissue-specific expression of the synthetic cry1C gene is useful for the control of S. litura which was rather resistant to the other types of Bt toxins.
