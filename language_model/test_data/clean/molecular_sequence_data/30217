Coupling of peptides to immunogenic protein carriers is required for the generation of anti-peptide antibody responses. Carbodiimides are hetero bi-functional coupling reagents that are utilized for coupling reactions through carboxyl and amino groups. The procedures generally used for carbodiimide coupling of peptides and proteins result in conjugates which generate immunodominant antibody responses directed against the neodeterminants on the carrier protein. These determinants are induced by the reaction of carrier and/or peptide with the coupling agent. We have investigated the potential inhibiting effect of an imidazole intermediary on the formation of unwanted neodeterminants during carbodiimide coupling. The serum antibody responses elicited with the peptide-protein conjugates produced were evaluated in ELISA. We have modified and improved the coupling with a watersoluble carbodiimide (EDC) in such a way that a high response to the coupled peptide is obtained in association with negligible levels of anti-neodeterminant antibodies.
