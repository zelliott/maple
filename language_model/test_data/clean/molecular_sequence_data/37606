We isolated a quail class III POU domain gene, qBrain-2, which was cloned from a cDNA library of E5 embryos. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses showed that qBrain-2 was expressed in developing central nervous system and adult brain. Moreover, qBrain-2 transcripts showed a dynamic distribution in embryonic central nervous system. Its transcripts were dominantly detected in the ventricular zone of the developing brain and spinal cord, but rarely in the differentiated region of mantle zone as well as the non-neuronal roof plate and floor plate. This suggests that qBrain-2 is involved in proliferation and differentiation of the neuroepithelial cells of quail central nervous system.
