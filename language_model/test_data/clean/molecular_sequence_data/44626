A cDNA clone, MdMADS1, containing MADS domain was isolated from the Fuji apple. The gene was expressed in all floral organs and young fruits but not in leaves. The expression was higher at the early stages of flower and fruit developments, suggesting that MdMADS1 plays a major role in the initiation of reproductive organ developments.
