We have cloned and sequenced mouse utrophin cDNA, and successfully expressed full length utrophin (400 kDa) in both muscle and non-muscle cells. The expression of recombinant utrophin is compared with that of its homologue, dystrophin (427 kDa). We demonstrate that recombinant utrophin is targeted into agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters, while recombinant dystrophin is evenly distributed along cell membranes in cultured Sol 8 muscle cells. This observation suggests that utrophin and dystrophin may interact with different cytoskeletal proteins. The C-terminal domains are found to be responsible for the association of utrophin with AChR clusters.
