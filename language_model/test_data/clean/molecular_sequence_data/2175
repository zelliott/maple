Between 59 and 60 min on the Escherichia coli genetic map, there is a highly conserved sequence of 29 base pairs, containing an inverted repeat of seven base pairs that appears 14 times, 32 or 33 base pairs apart, downstream of the iap gene coding region. About 24 kilobase pairs downstream of the 14 repeats, a similar 29-base-pair sequence with a spacing of 32 base pairs appears seven times. Nucleotide sequences hybridizing with the 29-base-pair fragment were also detected in Shigella dysenteriae and Salmonella typhimurium but not in Klebsiella pneumoniae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
