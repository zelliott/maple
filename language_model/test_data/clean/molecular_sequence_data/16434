Electron transfer between plant-type [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin (Fd) and ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) depends on the physical interaction between both proteins. We have applied a random mutagenesis approach with subsequent in vivo selection using the yeast two-hybrid system to obtain mutants of Toxoplasma gondii FNR with higher affinity for Fd. One mutant showed a 10-fold enhanced binding using affinity chromatography on immobilized Fd. A single serine-to-arginine exchange in the active site was responsible for its increased affinity. The mutant reductase was also enzymatically inactive. Homology modeling of the mutant FNR-Fd complex predicts substantial alterations of protein-FAD interactions in the active site of the enzyme with subsequent structural changes. Collectively, for the first time a point mutation in this important class of enzymes is described which leads to greatly enhanced affinity for its protein ligand.
