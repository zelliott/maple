We have used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify cDNA from expressed bovine major histocompatibility complex class I genes. Sequences obtained from transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains were used to identify the number of expressed alleles. Data from three animals suggest that there are four major expressed alleles, representing the products of two (or more) loci. We have also demonstrated the presence of an alternatively spliced mRNA, which has been observed in five animals. The alternative splicing removes exon 7 (the major site of class I phosphorylation), which predicts a truncated molecule with a cytoplasmic portion 16 amino acids shorter than usual. This phenomenon was detected for only a single class I allele within each individual.
