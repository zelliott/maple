The cDNA sequence coding for the coat protein of cucumber mosaic virus (Japanese Y strain) was cloned, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The sequence contains an open reading frame that encodes the coat protein composed of 218 amino acids. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the coat protein of this strain were compared with those of the Q strain; the homologies of the sequences were 78% and 81%, respectively. Further study of the sequences gave an insight into the genome organization and the molecular features of the coat protein. The coding region can be divided into three characteristic regions. The N-terminal region has conserved features in the positively charged structure, the hydropathy pattern and the predicted secondary structure, although the amino acid sequence is varied mainly due to frameshift mutations. It is noteworthy that the positions of arginine residues in this region are highly conserved. Both the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the central region are well conserved. The amino acid sequence of the C-terminal region is not conserved, because of frameshift mutations, however, the total number of amino acids is conserved. The nucleotide sequence of the 3'-noncoding region is divergent, but it could form a tRNA-like structure similar to those reported for other viruses. Detailed investigation suggests that the Y and Q strains are evolutionarily distant.
