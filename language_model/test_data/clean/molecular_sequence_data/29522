The heavy and light chain immunoglobulin variable region nucleotide sequences for 219 mAbs to human red blood cells were collected from workshop participants, published reports, and Genbank. Information regarding antigen specificity, species of origin, method of cloning, and other relevant serological properties was correlated with the sequence data. Immunoglobulin sequences were analyzed to determine the heavy- and light-chain immunoglobulin genes used and the overall extent of somatic mutation from germline configuration. Approximately 50% of the sequences encoded antibodies with Rh(D) specificity with the remaining sequences encoding mAbs to other Rh-related antigens, antigens of the ABO, MNS, and Kell blood group systems, and several others. Surprisingly, no sequence data were available for mAbs with specificity for a number of common Rh antigens, common Kell antigens, or antigens of the Lewis, Kidd, or Duffy blood group systems. The majority of mAbs were of human origin but included a significant number of macaque mAbs, murine mAbs, and a small number of synthetically-designed recombinant antibodies. Both cellular (EBV-transformation, cell fusion) and molecular (phage display) approaches were used for antibody cloning. Analysis of certain groups of sequences demonstrated patterns of immunoglobulin gene restriction, repertoire shift, and somatic mutation. Analysis of other mAbs demonstrated the value of antibody sequence data for the design and production of novel reagents useful in blood group serology.
