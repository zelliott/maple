Using the lambda gt11 expression library of murine teratocarcinoma cells, we isolated cDNA clones encoding a core protein carrying a developmentally regulated carbohydrate marker, namely the binding site for Dolichos biflorus agglutinin. The deduced amino acid sequence of the polypeptide (molecular weight, 37,102) revealed a leader sequence, nine potential asparagine glycosylation sites, and a transmembrane region. Sequence homology to variable domain of immunoglobulin kappa chain has been detected in a domain; homologous amino acids near cysteine residues are those conserved in many members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. In contrast to other members of the superfamily, the core protein gene was significantly expressed in embryonal carcinoma cells, which are similar to undifferentiated cells of early embryos.
