The gene encoding levansucrase (LVS) from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (sacB[BamP]) was isolated, sequenced and expressed in Bacillus subtilis. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of sacB[BamP] reveals extensive homology with that of the B. subtilis LVS-encoding gene in the promoter and coding region. The sacB[BamP] gene cloned in a multicopy plasmid is induced by sucrose in B. subtilis.
