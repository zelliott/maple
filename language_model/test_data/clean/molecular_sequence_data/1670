Temporal order ("chronology") of appearance of amino acids and their respective codons on evolutionary scene is reconstructed. A consensus chronology of amino acids is built on the basis of 60 different criteria each offering certain temporal order. After several steps of filtering the chronology vectors are averaged resulting in the consensus order: G, A, D, V, P, S, E, (L, T), R, (I, Q, N), H, K, C, F, Y, M, W. It reveals two important features: the amino acids synthesized in imitation experiments of S. Miller appeared first, while the amino acids associated with codon capture events came last. The reconstruction of codon chronology is based on the above consensus temporal order of amino acids, supplemented by the stability and complementarity rules first suggested by M. Eigen and P. Schuster, and on the earlier established processivity rule. At no point in the reconstruction the consensus amino-acid chronology was in conflict with these three rules. The derived genealogy of all 64 codons suggested several important predictions that are confirmed. The reconstruction of the origin and evolutionary history of the triplet code becomes, thus, a powerful research tool for molecular evolution studies, especially in its early stages.
