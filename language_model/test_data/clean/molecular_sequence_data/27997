The complete amino acid sequence of a high mobility group (HMG) nonhistone chromosomal protein of the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena pyriformis (GL strain) was determined. This protein was extracted with 0.5 M HClO4 together with histone H1 (molar ratio 1:1) from the whole histone extract, then purified by gel filtration and reverse-phase HPLC. The HMG protein showed a single electrophoretic band on SDS gel electrophoresis. The amino acid sequence was determined by Edman degradation of intact protein, BrCN fragments, and their staphylococcal protease and tryptic peptides. Thus the total sequence, consisting of 99 amino acid residues and having a molecular weight of 11,626, was completely determined. Phosphorus analysis of the tryptic peptides, containing serine or threonine, showed that this HMG protein was phosphorylated at two positions, each 6-7%, and contained 0.15 mol phosphate/mol protein. This Tetrahymena HMG is rather similar to the central part of vertebrate HMG 1 in terms of the amino acid sequence and the hydropathy profile.
