Tor tambroides, a common and appreciated cyprinid fish of the Tasik Kenyir water reservoir in Malaysia, is one of the species selected for propagation. This fish was first successfully propagated in Malaysia by the Department of Agriculture, Sarawak, Malaysia, and the breeding program continued throughout the country. The gills were frequently infected by a Myxobolus species to be described as Myxobolus tambroides sp. n. The small, 50 to 70 μm, round plasmodia of this species is located intralamellarly. Plasmodia were filled with pyriform myxospores, 9.9 and 7.4 μm wide. In sutural view, the caudal end of the myxospores had a distinctive valvular groove, parallel with the suture. Plasmodia caused deformations on the affected and the neighbouring gill lamellae. The 18S rDNA sequence of M. tambroides sp.n. did not show a close relationship with any other Myxobolus spp., represented in the GenBank. This might be an emerging parasite likely to impact the propagation of this fish.
