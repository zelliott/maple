The barley sdw1/denso gene not only controls plant height but also yield and quality. The sdw1/denso gene was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 3H. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the sdw1/denso gene was located in the syntenic region of the rice semidwarf gene sd1 on chromosome 1. The sd1 gene encodes a gibberellic acid (GA)-20 oxidase enzyme. The gene ortholog of rice sd1 was isolated from barley using polymerase chain reaction. The barley and rice genes showed a similar gene structure consisting of three exons and two introns. Both genes share 88.3% genomic sequence similarity and 89% amino acid sequence identity. A single nucleotide polymorphism was identified in intron 2 between barley varieties Baudin and AC Metcalfe with Baudin known to contain the denso semidwarf gene. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker was mapped to chromosome 3H in a doubled haploid population of Baudin x AC Metcalfe with 178 DH lines. Quantitative trait locus analysis revealed that plant height cosegregated with the SNP. The sdw1/denso gene in barley is the most likely ortholog of the sd1 in rice. The result will facilitate understanding of the molecular mechanism controlling semidwarf phenotype and provide a diagnostic marker for selection of semidwarf gene in barley.
