An open reading frame with the characteristics of a glycoprotein-coding sequence was identified by nucleotide sequencing of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genomic DNA. The predicted amino acid sequence was homologous with glycoprotein H of herpes simplex virus type 1 and the homologous protein of Epstein-Barr virus (BXLF2 gene product) and varicella-zoster virus (gpIII). Recombinant vaccinia viruses that expressed this gene were constructed. A glycoprotein of approximately 86 kilodaltons was immunoprecipitated from cells infected with the recombinant viruses and from HCMV-infected cells with a monoclonal antibody that efficiently neutralized HCMV infectivity. In HCMV-infected MRC5 cells, this glycoprotein was present on nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes, but in recombinant vaccinia virus-infected cells it accumulated predominantly on the nuclear membrane.
