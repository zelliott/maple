The osRACD gene correlated with fertility transformation in the photoperiod sensitive genic male sterile rice (PGMR), Nongken 58S, encoded a rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica) small GTPase belonging to the Rac/Rho family. Inverse PCR was performed to amplify a fragment about 1.4 kb in 5' upstream region of the osRACD promoter. Deletion mutation and gel mobility shift assay characterized two fragments (-799 to -686 nt, and -686 to -431 nt) in the osRACD promoter that could be involved in its transcriptional regulation. When these two deletion fragments were used as probe respectively, a retarded band appeared in the nuclear extracts of fertile 58S rice under short day (58S-SD). Whereas no retarded band was shown in the nuclear extracts of sterile 58S rice under long day (58S-LD). Competition assay indicated that the factors in the retarded bands binding to these two fragments were the same trans-acting factor (termed rice factor, RF). The binding affinity of RF was affected by phosphorylation and was higher in SD-growth rice than that of LD-growth rice.
