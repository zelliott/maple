The nucleotide sequence of a mitochondrial plasmid (2234 bp) in a diseased isolate of Ophiostoma novo-ulmi, and sequences of the mitochondrial DNA that overlap and flank the plasmid end-points, have been determined. The plasmid was shown to be derived from the O. novo-ulmi mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA gene and contained most of intron 1, the whole of exon 2, and probably the first part of intron 2. Within intron 1 there is an open reading frame with the potential to encode a 323 amino-acid polypeptide which contained dodecapeptide sequences typical of RNA maturases and DNA endonucleases. The endpoints of the plasmid in the mtDNA were located within two 90-bp direct imperfect repeat sequences, one of which comprised the last 7 bp of exon 1 and the first 83 bp of intron 1 whilst the other comprised the last 7 bp of exon 2 and the first 83 bp of intron 2. It is proposed that the Ld plasmid was generated by intramolecular recombination between these two repeats with the crossover point probably within the last 15 bp.
