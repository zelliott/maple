The maize (Zea mays) opaque5 (o5) locus was shown to encode the monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase MGD1. Null and point mutations of o5 that affect the vitreous nature of mature endosperm engendered an allelic series of lines with stepwise reductions in gene function. C(18:3)/C(18:2) galactolipid abundance in seedling leaves was reduced proportionally, without significant effects on total galactolipid content. This alteration in polar lipid composition disrupted the organization of thylakoid membranes into granal stacks. Total galactolipid abundance in endosperm was strongly reduced in o5(-) mutants, causing developmental defects and changes in starch production such that the normal simple granules were replaced with compound granules separated by amyloplast membrane. Complete loss of MGD1 function in a null mutant caused kernel lethality owing to failure in both endosperm and embryo development. The data demonstrate that low-abundance galactolipids with five double bonds serve functions in plastid membranes that are not replaced by the predominant species with six double bonds. Furthermore, the data identify a function of amyloplast membranes in the development of starch granules. Finally, the specific changes in lipid composition suggest that MGD1 can distinguish the constituency of acyl groups on its diacylglycerol substrate based upon the degree of desaturation.
