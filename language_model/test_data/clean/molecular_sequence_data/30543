Most peptide hormones and neurotransmitters are synthesized as larger precursor proteins, which are post-translationally processed to mature bioactive products. An early event in prohormone maturation is endoproteolytic cleavage, occurring usually at pairs of basic amino acids (e.g. Lys-Arg). Since many of the characteristics of a prohormone endoprotease are unknown, distinguishing these enzymes from other cellular proteases in vitro has been difficult. In this report, the substrate specificity of a model prohormone processing system, the insulinoma cell line Rin m5F, was characterized in vivo to establish a set of criteria by which putative proinsulin endoproteases may be assessed. To determine the role of composition of the paired basic amino acid site in directing cleavage, a series of mutant prohormones containing altered cleavage sites was constructed and expressed in Rin m5F cells. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) was used as a substrate since this prohormone was previously shown to be processed by these cells. To control for positional effects, all four permutations of lysine and arginine (Lys-Arg, Arg-Arg, Arg-Lys, and Lys-Lys) were introduced at both the efficiently processed cleavage site separating the ACTH and beta-lipotropin (beta-LPH) domains of POMC and at the inefficiently processed site in the beta-endorphin sequence near the COOH-terminus of the precursor. His-Arg and Met-Arg sites were also introduced at the ACTH/beta-LPH junction to assess the requirement for paired lysines and arginines. Identification of POMC-derived peptides demonstrated efficient processing of Lys-Arg and inefficient processing of Lys-Lys and Arg-Lys sites at both positions in the prohormone. The Arg-Arg sequence, however, was processed in a position-dependent manner, being efficiently cleaved between ACTH and beta-LPH but only about 50% processed within beta-endorphin. His-Arg was not cleaved in Rin m5F cells, although surprisingly Met-Arg was partially processed. These results indicate a strict preference of the insulinoma prohormone endoprotease(s) for paired basic amino acids ending in arginine, but that processing efficiency of some sequences may be modulated by location within the precursor molecule.
