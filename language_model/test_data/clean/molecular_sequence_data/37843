The mitochondrial citrate transport protein (CTP) has been investigated by replacing 22 consecutive residues within transmembrane domain IV, one at a time, with cysteine. A cysteine-less CTP retaining wild-type functional properties served as the starting template. The single Cys CTP variants were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, isolated, and functionally reconstituted in a liposomal system. The accessibility of each single Cys mutant to three methanethiosulfonate reagents was evaluated by determining the pseudo first order rate constants for inhibition of CTP function. These rate constants varied by seven orders of magnitude. With three independent data sets we observed peaks and troughs in the rate constant data at identical amino acid positions and a periodicity of four was observed from residues 177-193. Based on the pattern of accessibility we conclude that residues 177-193 exist as an alpha-helix. Furthermore, a water-accessible face of the helix has been defined consisting of Pro-177, Val-178, Arg-181, Gln-182, Asn-185, Gln-186, Arg-189, Leu-190, and Tyr-193, and a water-inaccessible face has been delineated consisting of Ser-179, Met-180, Ala-183, Ala-184, Ala-187, Val-188, Gly-191, and Ser-192. We infer that the water-accessible face comprises a portion of the substrate translocation pathway through the CTP, whereas the water-inaccessible surface faces the lipid bilayer.
