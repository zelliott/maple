The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel that is activated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation. CFTR channel activity is also stimulated by cGMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C.

Here, we show that CFTR channel activation by cGMP may also occur directly. In oocytes from one-third of Xenopus donors, the activation of CFTR by cGMP averaged 87% of the level achieved by cAMP. The currents activated by either cyclic nucleotide displayed similar current-voltage relationships, kinetics, pharmacology and halide selectivity. Sequential stimulation by cAMP and cGMP was not additive, suggesting that both cyclic nucleotides activate the same channel; cGMP was one order of magnitude more potent than cAMP, and its action was insensitive to protein kinase inhibitors. Analysis of the amino-acid sequence of CFTR revealed a domain in the amino-terminal portion of the third cytoplasmic loop that resembles a class of cyclic-nucleotide-binding domains related to that of the catabolite-gene activator protein, CAP. Two CFTR residues in this domain--Val397 and Lys420--were identified which, when changed to alanine, altered the response to cGMP independently of the response to cAMP.

We conclude that direct cyclic nucleotide binding may play a role in channel gating of CFTR. The cGMP-binding domain may provide a useful target for pharmacologic intervention in cystic fibrosis.
