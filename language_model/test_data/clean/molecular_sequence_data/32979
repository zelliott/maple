The amphiphilic alpha-helical peptide, Td3717, is a bi-functional synthetic peptide that acts as both a polycation for DNA binding and a ligand for targeted delivery to tumor cells. Td3717 forms a stable complex with plasmid DNA, and the complex maintained high transfection efficiency after storage at 4 degrees C for six months and after four freeze/thaw cycles. During the storage and freeze/thaw cycling, the particle size of the DNA/Td3717 complex remained less than 100nm. The size of the complex is an important factor for its internalization into cells via the endocytosis pathway; therefore, the stability of the particles will strongly contribute to high transfection efficiencies after storage and repeated freezing/thawing.
