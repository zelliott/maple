The mediator complexes transduce regulatory information from upstream regulatory elements to the transcription machinery in organisms ranging from yeasts to humans. By a genome-wide search we identified 14 ORFs and genes in the genome of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe that encode putative homologues of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mediator subunits. The Sch. pombe proteins are smaller and appear to form a mediator of lower complexity, which is consistent with the hypothesized ancient origin of fission yeasts.
