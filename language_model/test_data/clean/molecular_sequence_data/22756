Recombinant Cu,Zn Superoxide Dismutase from Caulobacter crescentus has been expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized. The corresponding recombinant protein has a molecular weight typical of a homodimeric Cu,ZnSODs and an activity comparable to that of other prokaryotic enzymes. The copper active site is characterized by a peculiar axial geometry as evidenced by its electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum, moreover, the copper atom displays a low accessibility toward external chelating agents indicating a lower solvent accessibility when compared to other prokaryotic enzymes. Investigation of the enzyme thermal stability through differential scanning calorimetry indicates the occurrence of two transitions at low and higher temperature that are found to be due to the apo and holo protein, respectively, confirming that the metals have a crucial role in the stabilization of this class of enzymes.
