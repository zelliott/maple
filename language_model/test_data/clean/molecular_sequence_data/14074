The protein conformation of a mouse seminal vesicle autoantigen was studied by circular dichroism spectroscopy. At pH 7.4, the spectrum in the UV region appears as one negative band at 217 nm and one positive band at 200 nm. This together with the predicted secondary structures indicates no helices but a mixture of beta form, beta turn, and unordered form in the protein molecule. The conformation is stable even at pH 10.5 or 3.0. The spectrum in the near-UV region consists of fine structures that are disturbed in acidic or alkaline solution. The environments around Trp2 and Trp82 of this protein were studied by intrinsic fluorescence and solute quenching. They give an emission peak at 345 nm, and about 87% of them are accessible to quenching by acrylamide. Correlating the quenching effect of CsCl and Kl on the protein fluorescence to the charged groups along the polypeptide chain suggests the difference in the "local charge" around the two tryptophan residues. The presence of ZnCl2 in the protein solution effects no change in the circular dichroism but perturbs the fluorescence due to Trp82. Analysis of the fluorescence data suggests a Zn(2+)-binding site on the protein, which cannot coordinate with both Ca2+ and Mg2+. The association constant for the complex formation is 1.35 x 10(5) +/- 0.04 x 10(5) M-1 at pH 7.4.
