T3 and T7 phages package homologous DNA more efficiently than heterologous DNA and recombinant plasmids carrying DNA sequences necessary for DNA packaging (pac sequence). The pac sequence contains a promoter for phage RNA polymerase and transcription from the promoter is necessary for DNA packaging. T3 and T7 RNA polymerases are stringently specific for their own promoters. To examine the relationship between DNA packaging and transcription, we constructed a cleared in vitro system for packaging T3 or T7 DNA containing an ammonium sulfate fractionate of a high-speed supernatant of phage-infected cells. In the system, DNA packaging required GTP and was inhibited by the 3'-deoxy analog of GTP, ATP, or CTP. The DNA packaging activity paralleled the transcriptional activity, assayed by incorporation of [32P]UTP into acid-insoluble material. In the system, homologous DNA was packaged more efficiently than heterologous DNA, but heterologous DNA was packaged as efficiently as homologous DNA by the addition of heterologous phage RNA polymerase, demonstrating that the transcriptional specificity determines the DNA packaging specificity of T3 and T7.
