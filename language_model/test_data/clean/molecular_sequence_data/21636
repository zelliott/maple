Oligoarabinofuranoside-containing glycolipids relevant to mycobacterial cell wall components were synthesized in order to understand the functional roles of such glycolipids. A series of linear tetra-, hexa-, octa- and a branched heptasaccharide oligoarabinofuranosides, with 1 → 2 and 1 → 5 α-linkages between the furanoside residues, were synthesized by chemical methods from readily available monomer building blocks. Upon the synthesis of glycolipids, constituted with a double alkyl chain-substituted sn-glycerol core and oligosaccharide fragments, biological studies were performed to identify the effect of synthetic glycolipids on the biofilm formation and sliding motilities of Mycobacterium smegmatis. Synthetic glycolipids and arabinofuranosides displayed an inhibitory effect on the growth profile, but mostly on the biofilm formation and maturation. Similarly, synthetic compounds also influenced the sliding motility of the bacteria. Further, biophysical studies were undertaken, so as to identify the interactions of the glycolipids with a pulmonary surfactant protein, namely surfactant protein A (SP-A), with the aid of the surface plasmon resonance technique. Specificities of each glycolipid interacting with SP-A were thus evaluated. From this study, glycolipids were found to exhibit higher apparent association constants than the corresponding oligosaccharide portion alone, without the double alkyl group-substituted glycerol core.
