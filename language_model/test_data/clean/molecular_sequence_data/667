Two cDNAs encoding taxoid-O-acetyl transferases (TAX 9 and TAX 14) were obtained from a previously isolated family of Taxus acyl/aroyl transferase cDNA clones. The recombinant enzymes catalyze the acetylation of taxadien-5alpha,13alpha-diacetoxy-9alpha,10beta-diol to generate taxadien-5alpha,10beta,13alpha-tri-acetoxy-9alpha-ol and taxadien-5alpha,9alpha,13alpha-triacetoxy-10beta-ol, respectively, both of which then serve as substrates for a final acetylation step to yield taxusin, a prominent side-route metabolite of Taxus. Neither enzyme acetylate the 5alpha- or the 13alpha-hydroxyls of taxoid polyols, indicating that prior acylations is required for efficient peracetylation to taxusin. Both enzymes were kinetically characterized, and the regioselectivity of acetylation was shown to vary with pH. Sequence comparison with other taxoid acyl transferases confirmed that primary structure of this enzyme type reveals little about function in taxoid metabolism. Unlike previously identified acetyl transferases involved in Taxol production, these two enzymes appear to act exclusively on partially acetylated taxoid polyols to divert the Taxol pathway to side-route metabolites.
