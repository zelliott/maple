Apoptosis was monitored in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) cultured under mildly acidic, neutral, and alkaline conditions. Within 3 h, 9.0% of the PMNs underwent apoptosis at pH 6.7, as did 12% at pH 7.2, 38% at pH 7.7, and 60% at pH 8.2. Inhibitors of serine proteases, caspase-1, or caspase-3 significantly inhibited PMN apoptosis at pH 8.2, suggesting an involvement by these enzymes.
