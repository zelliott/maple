Most of the successful vaccines developed to date induce protective immunity resembling that produced by natural infection. HIV infection does not induce protective immunity. Thus, previously successful approaches based on live- or killed-virus preparations may not yield an effective and safe AIDS vaccine and many feel that a more highly engineered vaccine will be required. Synthetic peptides represent extremely powerful tools for vaccine research and construct optimization. The theory and practice of vaccine engineering using synthetic peptide components is reviewed with special emphasis on progress towards development of a vaccine for AIDS.
