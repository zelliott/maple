In order to identify markers of the two neuronal populations which are successively involved in forebrain ontogenesis, we performed a differential screening of a murine cDNA library with two radiolabelled probes corresponding to striatal mRNAs extracted at embryonic day (E) 17 and E20, i.e. before and after the invasion of the striatum by the late-born matrix neurons. One of the selected clones, the 3.1 cDNA, corresponds to a very abundant embryonic neuronal transcript enriched in the germinal zones at E17 and in superficial cortical layers and striatum at E20, suggesting that it is expressed mainly in neurons belonging to a late migration wave. During adulthood, it persists at a high level in the granular layer of the cerebellum, the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb, which are the sites of postnatal neurogenesis and intense synaptic plasticity. This 2000 base RNA is enriched in polysomal fractions and encodes a small putative 68 amino acid polypeptide which is conserved in mouse and man.
