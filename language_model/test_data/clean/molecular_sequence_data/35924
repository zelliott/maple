We have isolated a gene, AAT1, encoding an aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) from a Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic library. AAT1 encodes a 451 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 51,687, which is likely to be the yeast mitochondrial AspAT. Sequence comparison of this yeast AspAT with AspATs from other organisms shows a high degree of homology in regions previously shown to be important for catalysis. However, the yeast mitochondrial AspAT contains four obvious insertions with respect to all other known AspATs, suggesting that the AAT1-encoded protein represents a distinct AspAT.
