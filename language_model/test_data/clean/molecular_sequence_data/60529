Previous work has shown that chicken strains selected for growth (broilers) degrade muscle proteins less rapidly than those selected for egg laying. They also have decreased calpain and increased calpastatin content in breast muscle. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that these differences correlate with changes in the ATP- and ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system. Chickens of a broiler strain (Ross 1) and a layer strain (ISABrown) were reared to the age of 4 wk under identical conditions with ad libitum access to feed and water. Mean fractional growth rates were 10.4%/d for broilers and 7.4%/d for layers. Feed intake measured in the last week of the trial was slightly greater in layer birds (.11 and .12 g x g body weight(-1) x d(-1) for broilers and layers respectively; P < .006). Polyubiquitin (UbI) messenger RNA was abundant in the muscles of these well-fed birds, but it showed little difference between strains. Muscle did not significantly express the UbII polyubiquitin gene. The ATP-dependent system conjugating ubiquitin to endogenous proteins had greatest activity in the gastrocnemius muscle of broiler birds but was not significantly different between breeds. Proteins cross-reactive with antisera to recombinant human proteasome regulatory subunits MSS1 (multicopy suppressor of SUG 1; S7) and TBP1 (tat binding protein 1; S6') were present in muscle homogenates from both strains of bird. The chick equivalent of TBP1 was more abundant in breast muscle of broiler birds than in leg muscle, or in either muscle of layers. Antiserum to recombinant yeast subunit mts2 (mitosis temperature sensitive gene 2; S4) did not react with any protein of the expected size but detected a 30-kDa peptide that was not associated with the 26S proteasome; this was found only in muscle from the layer strain. Hence, during normal growth of chickens, rates of protein degradation are not controlled by the expression of ubiquitin mRNA or the conjugation of ubiquitin. However, the composition of the 26S proteasome may be a regulatory factor.
