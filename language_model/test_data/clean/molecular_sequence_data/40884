The paper reports a study on the role of ion-pairing behind peak deformations, e.g. peak splitting and even peak disappearance, during the elution of a peptide at highly overloaded conditions in reversed-phase chromatography. Deformation of component peaks is not uncommon in chromatography. There are reports which discuss their occurrence, but mostly at analytical scale, while their occurrence is quite common also in the preparative scale, as in the case discussed in this work. This paper first describes the conditions leading to peak splitting and peak disappearance of an industrial peptide, then explains the plausible reasons behind such behaviour, and finally with experimental analysis demonstrates the role of ion-pairing in causing such behaviour.
