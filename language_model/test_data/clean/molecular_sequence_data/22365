Polyadenylation of B19 pre-mRNAs at the major internal site, (pA)p1, is programmed by the nonconsensus core cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor-binding hexanucleotide AUUAAA. Efficient use of this element requires both downstream and upstream cis-acting elements and is further influenced by an adjacent AAUAAC motif. The primary hexanucleotide element must be nonconsensus to allow efficient readthrough of P6-generated pre-mRNAs into the capsid-coding region. An additional cleavage and polyadenylation site, (pA)p2, 296 nucleotides downstream of (pA)p1 was shown to be used following both B19 infection and transfection of a genomic clone. RNAs polyadenylated at (pA)p2 comprise approximately 10% of B19 RNAs that are polyadenylated internally.
