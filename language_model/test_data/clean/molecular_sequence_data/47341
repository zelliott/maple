Phosphorylation of the glutamate receptor is an important mechanism of synaptic plasticity. Here, we show that the C terminus of GluR2 of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptor is phosphorylated by protein kinase C and that serine-880 is the major phosphorylation site. This phosphorylation also occurs in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells by addition of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. Our immunoprecipitation experiment revealed that the phosphorylation of serine-880 in GluR2 drastically reduced the affinity for glutamate receptor-interacting protein (GRIP), a synaptic PDZ domain-containing protein, in vitro and in HEK cells. This result suggests that modulation of serine-880 phosphorylation in GluR2 controls the clustering of AMPA receptors at excitatory synapses and consequently contributes to synaptic plasticity.
