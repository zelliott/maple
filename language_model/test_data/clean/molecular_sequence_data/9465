Collagen type I is an abundant component of the extracellular matrix and due to its longevity, constitutes a prominent target of non-enzymatic post-translational in vivo modifications such as carbamylation and glycation. These protein modifications involved in aging, renal diseases and diabetes, are linked to elevated cancer risk. In this in vitro study, we investigated the impact of carbamylated and glycated collagen type I on the migratory behavior of the highly invasive HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells. The proliferation of HT1080 on modified collagens did not differ from that on native form. The glycated collagen delayed the cell adhesion time whereas the carbamylated one had no effect. The migration ability of HT1080 was studied by quantifying single cell speed using videomicroscopy. Glycation strongly inhibited mean cell speed by 47% whereas carbamylation moderately affected it by 12%. In addition, the influence of these collagen modifications on actin and vinculin organization was studied. On the glycated collagen, 63% of cells revealed a dramatic loss of actin stress fibers vs. 28% on the carbamylated one. In these cells, disorganized F-actin was accompanied with a disturbance of vinculin and both proteins were localized at the rim of the cells. Concerning the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) expression, glycated collagen only induced a significant inhibition. Whereas, both collagen modifications provoked a differential inhibition of FAK phosphorylation state by 25% for carbamylation and 60% for glycation. In conclusion, our data suggest that, in vivo, collagen glycation and carbamylation may affect tumor cell metastasis. This suggestion is supported by clinical studies reporting less aggressive tumors in diabetic or uremic patients. Consequently, the impact of such post-translational modifications has to be taken into account in order to better understand the link between aging, diabetes or uremia and cancer progression.
