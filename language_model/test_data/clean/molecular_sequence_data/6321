A gene (hag) encoding the flagellin (Fla) protein was cloned from Serratia marcescens (Sm) 8000, the wild-type strain of Sr41. The hag gene codes for a 348-amino-acid (aa) protein of 36.7 kDa. The predicted aa sequence showed 79% homology compared with the Fla of Sm 274 which has been reported previously [Harshey et al., Gene 79 (1989) 1-8]. Dot-matrix analysis of the Sm 8000 Fla showed that the N- and C-terminal regions of this protein were highly similar to those of other bacterial Fla. However, the aa sequence of the middle portion was quite different from that of a variant strain of the same species, Sm 274.
