The sequences and predicted secondary structures of the four catalytic group-I introns in the psbA gene of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Cr.psbA-1-Cr.psbA-4, have been determined. Cr.psbA-1 and Cr.psbA-4 are subgroup-IA1 introns and have similar secondary structures, except at the 3' end where Cr.psbA-1 contains a large inverted-repeat domain. Cr.psbA-4 is closely related to intron 1 of the Chlamydomonas moewusii psbA gene, with which it shares the same location, high nucleotide identity in the core, and an identically placed ORF that shows 58% amino-acid identity. Cr.psbA-2 is a subgroup-IA3 intron, and shows similarities to the Chlamydomonas eugametos rRNA intron, Ce.LSU-1. Cr.psbA-3 is a subgroup-IA2 intron, and is remarkably similar to the T4 phage intron, sunY. Interestingly, a degenerate version of Cr.psbA-3 is located in the intergenic region between the chloroplast petA and petD genes. All four introns contain ORFs, which potentially code for basic proteins of 11-38 kDa. The ORFs in introns 2 and 3 contain variants of the GIY-YIG motif; however, the Cr.psbA-2 ORF is free-standing, whereas the Cr.psbA-3 ORF is contiguous and in-frame with the upstream exon. The Cr.psbA-4 ORF contains an H-N-H motif, and possibly a GIY-YIG motif. These data indicate that the C. reinhardtiipsbA introns have multiple origins, and illustrate some of the evolutionary DNA dynamics associated with group-I introns in Chlamydomonas.
