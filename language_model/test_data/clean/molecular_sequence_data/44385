The nth and nei genes of Escherichia coli affect the production of endonuclease III and endonuclease VIII, respectively, glycosylases/apurinic lyases that attack DNA damaged by oxidizing agents. Here, we provide evidence that oxidative lethal lesions are repaired by both endonuclease III and endonuclease VIII and that spontaneous mutagenic lesions are repaired mainly by endonuclease III.
