Moving past the discovery phase of proteomics, the term targeted proteomics combines multiple approaches investigating a certain set of proteins in more detail. One such targeted proteomics approach is the combination of liquid chromatography and selected or multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (SRM, MRM). SRM-MS requires prior knowledge of the fragmentation pattern of peptides, as the presence of the analyte in a sample is determined by measuring the m/z values of predefined precursor and fragment ions. Using scheduled SRM-MS, many analytes can robustly be monitored allowing for high-throughput sample analysis of the same set of proteins over many conditions. In this chapter, fundaments of SRM-MS are explained as well as an optimized SRM pipeline from assay generation to data analyzed.
