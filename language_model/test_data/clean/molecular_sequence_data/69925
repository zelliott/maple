GNRH plays a pivotal role in the neurohormonal control of reproduction by promoting hte secretion of pituitary gonadotrophins, LH and FSH. GnRH also stimulates the synthesis of constitutive gonadotrophin subunits alpha and beta and its own receptor number. Gonadotrophin synthesis appears to be regulated by GnRH through various molecular mechanisms that include, in a complementary and in some cases differential manner, enhanced transcriptional activity of subunit genes and polyadenylation of transcripts. The latter is known to result in increased stability and/or translational activity of mRNAs. These effects of GnRH are mimicked by the direct activation of protein kinases A and C, two different but possibly interconnected signalling pathways that may account for the pleiotropic and concerted alterations of both synthesis and release of gonadotrophins. GnRH operates on the gonadotropic cell level via a transmembrane, G-protein coupled receptor, the structure of which has recently been determined by molecular cloning. This receptor differs from the other members of hte super-family essentially by a rather short length (only 327-328 amino acids) and a truncated carboxyterminus. Recent experiments suggest a genomic control of the GnRH receptor synthesis, especially by GnRH itself, the importance, and role of which remains to be established for the pituitary gonadotropic function.
