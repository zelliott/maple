Trehalose is the main sugar in the haemolymph of insects and is a key nutrient source for an insect pathogenic fungus. Secretion of trehalose-hydrolysing enzymes may be a prerequisite for successful exploitation of this resource by the pathogen. An acid trehalase [EC 3.2.1.28] was purified to homogeneity from a culture of a locust-specific pathogen, Metarhizium anisopliae, and its properties were characterized. The gene (ATM1) of this acid trehalase was also isolated. The pure enzyme can efficiently hydrolyze haemolymph trehalose into glucose in vitro. The new acid trehalase appearing in the haemolymph of Locusta migratoria infected with M. anisopliae had the same pI and substrate specificity as the purified fungal acid trehalase, and the concentration of trehalose in the haemolymph decreased sharply after infection. RT-PCR also revealed the ATM1 gene's expression in the haemolymph of the infected insects. Our results indicated that the acid trehalase may serve as an "energy scavenger" and deplete blood trehalose during fungal pathogenesis.
