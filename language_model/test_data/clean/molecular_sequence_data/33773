With the goal of identifying hitherto unknown surface exosites of streptokinase involved in substrate human plasminogen recognition and catalytic turnover, synthetic peptides encompassing the 170 loop (CQFTPLNPDDDFRPGLKDTKLLC) in the beta-domain were tested for selective inhibition of substrate human plasminogen activation by the streptokinase-plasmin activator complex. Although a disulfide-constrained peptide exhibited strong inhibition, a linear peptide with the same sequence, or a disulfide-constrained variant with a single lysine to alanine mutation showed significantly reduced capabilities of inhibition. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the 170 loop of the beta-domain of streptokinase was then performed to elucidate its importance in streptokinase-mediated plasminogen activation. Some of the 170 loop mutants showed a remarkable decline in k(cat) without any alteration in apparent substrate affinity (K(m)) as compared with wild-type streptokinase and identified the importance of Lys(180) as well as Pro(177) in the functioning of this loop. Remarkably, these mutants were able to generate amidolytic activity and non-proteolytic activation in "partner" plasminogen as wild-type streptokinase. Moreover, cofactor activities of the 170 loop mutants, pre-complexed with plasmin, against microplasminogen as the substrate showed a similar pattern of decline in k(cat) as that observed in the case of full-length plasminogen, with no concomitant change in K(m). These results strongly suggest that the 170 loop of the beta-domain of streptokinase is important for catalysis by the streptokinase-plasmin(ogen) activator complex, particularly in catalytic processing/turnover of substrate, although it does not seem to contribute significantly toward enzyme-substrate affinity per se.
