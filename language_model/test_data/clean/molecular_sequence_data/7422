A 1917-bp cDNA clone encoding phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (PC-TP) was identified by screening a bovine liver library. Northern blot analysis demonstrated a 2-kb mRNA transcript in bovine liver, and Southern blotting was consistent with a single bovine PC-TP gene which was shown to be present in a diverse group of vertebrates, but not in yeast. Database comparisons revealed the nucleotide sequence of the clone to be unique and unrelated to other cytosolic lipid TP.
