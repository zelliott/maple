A BamHI-EcoRV DNA fragment, containing tandemly arranged genes for the Bacillus cereus VKM-B164 phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C and sphingomyelinase, has been cloned and sequenced in pUC19 plasmid (EMBL accession No X64141). The obtained gene sequences have been compared with those the B. cereus strains SE-1, IAM-1208 and GP-4 reported previously. Both phospholipase C and sphingomyelinase gene sequences of the VKM-B164 strain were found to be identical to those of the strain SE-1 and to differ from the sequences of GP-4 and IAM-1208 strains, containing another version of the gene sequences.
