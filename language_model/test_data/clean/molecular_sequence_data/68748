We have cloned a full length complementary DNA (cDNA) of the porcine tumor necrosis factor alpha (pTNF-alpha) gene and expressed it in porcine and murine cells. Total RNA obtained from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells was reverse transcribed with a specific antisense pTNF-alpha primer to generate a single stranded cDNA which was subsequently amplified by the polymerase chain reaction utilizing an additional pTNF-alpha specific sense primer. The resulting double stranded cDNA was introduced into the pBMGNeo expression vector and transfected by electroporation in porcine (PK(15)) and murine (L929) cell lines. TNF-alpha bioactivity was detected in the supernatant of the transfected cells using a standard L929 bioassay or a PK(15) bioassay. The activity was zinc inducible as expected for a gene controlled by a metallothionein promoter. The bioactivity was not lowered by an anti-mouse TNF-alpha antiserum neutralizing murine, but not human TNF-alpha and a broad immunoreactive band of 17-19 kD was detected using an anti-mouse TNF-alpha serum suitable for immunoblotting. This newly developed tool will allow us to investigate the role of TNF-alpha in pathogenesis of viral infections and gram-negative sepsis.
