The nucleotide sequence of cDNA encoding human erythrocyte AMP deaminase has been determined by screening of human spleen cDNA library and by utilizing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. The 3.7 kb cDNA contains an open reading frame of 2301 bp which encodes 767 amino acids chain resulting in 89 kDa protein. The polyadenylation consensus signal (5'-AATAAA) located at 1212 bp 3' downstream from the stop codon. The homologies to human and rat muscle-specific AMP deaminases showed 64.1% and 65.2% identities, respectively, at the nucleotide level in the area of open reading frame, and 60.2% and 59.8% similarities at the deduced amino acid level.
