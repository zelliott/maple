The function of the p53 tumor suppressor protein is regulated by interaction with Mdm2, which targets p53 for ubiquitin dependent degradation. We show here that like p53, p73 alpha forms an interaction with Mdm2, both in vitro and in cells, but this does not result in the degradation of the p73 alpha protein. The human papillomavirus E6 protein also fails to degrade p73 alpha, suggesting that the mechanisms governing p73 alpha stability are distinct from those known to regulate p53 stability. However, the interaction of Mdm2 with 73 alpha is sufficient to impede p73 alpha transcriptional function, despite the lack of degradation.
