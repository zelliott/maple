Sea bass nervous necrosis virus is the causative agent of viral nervous necrosis, a disease responsible of high economic losses in larval and juvenile stages of cultured sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). To identify genes potentially involved in antiviral immune defense, gene expression profiles in response to nodavirus infection were investigated in sea bass head kidney using the suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) technique. A total of 8.7% of the expressed sequence tags found in the SSH library showed significant similarities with immune genes, of which a prototype galectin (Sbgalectin-1), two C-type lectins (SbCLA and SbCLB) from groups II and VII, respectively, and a short pentraxin (Sbpentraxin) were selected for further characterization. Results of SSH were validated by in vivo up-regulation of expression of Sbgalectin-1, SbCLA, and SbCLB in response to nodavirus infection. To examine the potential role(s) of Sbgalectin-1 in response to nodavirus infection in further detail, the recombinant protein (rSbgalectin-1) was produced, and selected functional assays were conducted. A dose-dependent decrease of respiratory burst was observed in sea bass head kidney leukocytes after incubation with increasing concentrations of rSbgalectin-1. A decrease in IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and Mx expression was observed in the brain of sea bass simultaneously injected with nodavirus and rSbgalectin-1 compared with those infected with nodavirus alone. Moreover, the protein was detected in the brain from infected fish, which is the main target of the virus. These results suggest a potential anti-inflammatory, protective role of Sbgalectin-1 during viral infection.
