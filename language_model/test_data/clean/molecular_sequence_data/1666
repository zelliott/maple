The relationship between resistance to rifampicin and rifabutin and genetic alterations in the rpoB gene of 41 rifampicin-resistant isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was evaluated. Although 35 isolates with rifampicin MICs > or = 32 mg/L were also rifabutin-resistant, six isolates with rifampicin MICs of 2-16 mg/L were susceptible to rifabutin (MIC < or = 0.5 mg/L). Mutations Asp516Val, Asp516Tyr, Leu533Pro and the double mutation Met515Ile and Leu533Pro influenced susceptibility to rifampicin, but not to rifabutin. All mutations at codons 531 and 526, except one isolate with a His526Cys mutation, correlated with resistance to both compounds.
