A moderately halophilic, Gram-positive-staining, endospore-forming, rod-shaped and strictly aerobic bacterium, designated strain NHBX5(T), was isolated from Lake Nanhuobuxun in China. Strain NHBX5(T) was able to grow at NaCl concentrations of 0-22 % (w/v) (optimally at 7 %, w/v), at pH 6.0-9.0 (optimally at pH 7.5) and at temperatures of 10-45 degrees C (optimally at 37 degrees C). The cell-wall peptidoglycan of strain NHBX5(T) contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid. The predominant isoprenoid quinone was MK-7. The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C(15 : 0) and anteiso-C(17 : 0). The polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and a glycolipid. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain NHBX5(T) was 44.9 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons revealed that strain NHBX5(T) was most closely related to Sediminibacillus halophilus EN8d(T) (98.6 % gene sequence similarity). The level of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain NHBX5(T) and S. halophilus CGMCC 1.6199(T) was 34.6 %. Based on the data presented, strain NHBX5(T) represents a novel species of the genus Sediminibacillus, for which the name Sediminibacillus albus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NHBX5(T) (=DSM 19340(T) =CGMCC 1.6502(T)). In addition, an emended description of the genus Sediminibacillus is presented.
