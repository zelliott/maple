Deficiency of uridine monophosphate synthase (DUMPS) is a monogenic autosomal recessive disorder in cattle, resulting in early embryonic death of homozygous offspring. To identify the mutation responsible for DUMPS, liver RNA from identified, DUMPS heterozygous animals from the Holstein and Red Holstein breeds was reverse transcribed. Amplification of cDNA with sequence-specific primers and subsequent sequencing of the PCR products revealed a mutation (C-->T) with the loss of an AvaI site at codon 405, resulting in a premature stop codon with a truncated C-terminal catalytic subunit of the protein. A direct DNA test based on PCR was developed and subsequently tested on 102 animals. Complete concurrence of deficiency of UMPS and the presence of the described point mutation in heterozygous animals was observed, thus confirming this point mutation as the basic defect in DUMPS cattle.
