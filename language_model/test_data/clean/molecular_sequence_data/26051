We determined the distribution of cis-regulatory sites, previously identified in the control domain of the CyIIIa gene, in three other genes displaying diverse spatial patterns of expression in the sea urchin embryo. Competitive gel-shift reactions were carried out using probes from the CyIIIa gene, with competitor fragments isolated from the previously defined control domains of the other genes. CyIIIa is expressed only in aboral ectoderm lineages; the other genes studied were Spec1, also expressed in aboral ectoderm; CyI, expressed in many different cell types; and SM50, expressed only in skeletogenic mesenchyme. All four genes are activated at about the same time in late cleavage. Where competitive interactions indicated a functionally comparable binding site (in vitro), a sequence homology was sought, and in most cases could be identified. An interesting pattern of putative regulatory site usage emerges: Of 10 CyIIIa interactions tested, three only were unique to the CyIIIa gene with respect to the set of four genes tested; one believed on previous evidence to be a temporal regulator was shared by all four genes, and the remainder were shared in various subsets of the four genes.
