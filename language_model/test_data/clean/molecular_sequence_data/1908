A safe and effective group A rotavirus vaccine that could prevent severe diarrhea or ameliorate its symptoms in infants and young children is urgently needed in both developing and developed countries. Rotavirus VP7 serotypes G1, G2, G3, and G4 have been well established to be of epidemiologic importance worldwide. Recently, serotype G9 has emerged as the fifth globally common type of rotavirus of clinical importance. Sequence analysis of the VP7 gene of various G9 isolates has demonstrated the existence of at least three phylogenetic lineages. The goal of our study was to determine the relationship of the phylogenetic lineages to the neutralization specificity of various G9 strains. We generated eight single VP7 gene substitution reassortants, each of which bore a single VP7 gene encoding G9 specificity of one of the eight G9 strains (two lineage 1, one lineage 2 and five lineage 3 strains) and the remaining 10 genes of bovine rotavirus strain UK, and two hyperimmune guinea pig antisera to each reassortant, and we then analyzed VP7 neutralization characteristics of the eight G9 strains as well as an additional G9 strain belonging to lineage 1; the nine strains were isolated in five countries. Antisera to lineage 1 viruses neutralized lineage 2 and 3 strains to at least within eightfold of the homotypic lineage viruses. Antisera to lineage 2 virus neutralized lineage 3 viruses to at least twofold of the homotypic lineage 2 virus; however, neutralization of lineage 1 viruses was fourfold (F45 and AU32) to 16- to 64-fold (WI61) less efficient. Antisera to lineage 3 viruses neutralized the lineage 2 strain 16- to 64-fold less efficiently, the lineage 1 strains F45 and AU32 8- to 128-fold less efficiently, and WI61 (prototype G9 strain) 128- to 1024-fold less efficiently than the homotypic lineage 3 viruses. These findings may have important implications for the development of G9 rotavirus vaccine candidates, as the strain with the broadest reactivity (i.e., a prime strain) would certainly be the ideal strain for inclusion in a vaccine.
