Kidneys are the mammalian organs with widest range of oxidative status ranging from the well-perfused cortex to the relatively anoxic medulla. This organ is of key interest from the perspective of hypertension, an important contributor to human mortality, and there has been growing use of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) as a model to explore oxidative stress in hypertensive kidney. Nitrosative stress is often associated with oxidative stress and, like oxidative stress, can lead to covalent modification of protein side-chains. It is especially relevant to kidney because of high levels of both nitrite/nitrate and nitric oxide synthase in medulla. Because of their relatively low abundance and their well-known role in signal transduction, nitration of tyrosines to 3-nitrotyrosines (3NT) is of particular interest in this regard. This modification has the potential to contribute to changes in regulation, in protein activity and may provide a means of specific targeting of key proteins. Mass spectrometry (MS) offers a promising route to detecting this modification. This review surveys protein nitration in kidney disease and highlights opportunities for MS detection of nitrated residues in the SHR.
