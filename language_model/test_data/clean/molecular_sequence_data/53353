Chemokines direct leukocyte recruitment into sites of tissue inflammation and may facilitate recruitment of leukocytes into allografts following transplantation. Although the expression of chemokines during rejection of MHC-disparate allografts has been examined, chemokine expression in MHC-matched/multiple minor histocompatibility Ag-disparate allografts has not been tested. The intraallograft RNA expression of several C-X-C and C-C chemokines was tested during rejection of full thickness skin grafts from B10. D2 donors on control Ig-, anti-CD4 mAb-, and anti-CD8 mAb-treated BALB/c recipients. In all recipients, two patterns of intragraft chemokine expression were observed during rejection of these grafts: 1) macrophage-inflammatory protein-1alpha, macrophage-inflammatory protein-1beta, GRO-alpha (KC), JE, and IFN-gamma-inducible protein (IP-10) were expressed at equivalent levels in allo- and isografts for 2-4 days posttransplant and then returned to low or undetectable levels; and 2) IP-10 and monokine induced by IFN-gamma (Mig) were expressed in the allografts 3 days before rejection was completed, suggesting a possible role in recruiting primed T cells into the allograft. Three days before completion of rejection, intraallograft IP-10 protein was restricted to the epidermis, whereas Mig was located in the lower dermis and associated with the intense infiltration of mononuclear cells. Treatment of B10.D2 recipients with rabbit antiserum to Mig, but not to IP-10, delayed rejection of the allografts 3-4 days. The results suggest that Mig mediates optimal recruitment of T cells into MHC-matched/multiple minor histocompatibility Ag-disparate allografts during rejection.
