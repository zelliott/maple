We have isolated and characterized genomic clones of the 5' region of the human PDGF A-chain gene. The putative "TATAA" box was identified 876 bp upstream of the translation initiation site. A significant number of potential regulatory elements were identified in DNA sequences upstream of the "TATAA" box and were also found within the introns sequenced. The DNA sequence results differ significantly from those reported for the PDGF B-chain gene, suggesting a basis for the expression of the PDGF A-chain gene and the B-chain gene under very different conditions.
