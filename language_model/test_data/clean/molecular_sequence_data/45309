A novel human gene TSARG7 (GenBank accession No. AY513610) was identified from a human testis cDNA library by using the mTSARG7 gene (GenBank accession No. AY489184) as an electronic probe. The gene whose full cDNA length is 2,463 bp containing 12 exons and 11 introns is located in the human chromosome 8p11.21. The predicted protein encoded by this gene contains 456 amino acids with a theoretical molecular weight of 56,295 dalton and isoelectric point of 9.13. It is a new member of the acyltransferase family since its sequence possesses the highly conserved PlsC domain existing in all acyltransferase-like proteins. Two groups, the TSARG7 and mTSARG7, the TSARG7 and Au041707, share 97% identity in the 456 amino acids. Expression of the TSARG7 gene is restricted to the testis. Subcellular localization studies show that the EGFP-tagged TSARG7 protein was localized in the cytoplasm of GC-1 cells. The TSARG7 mRNA expression was initiated in the testis of a 13-year-old boy, and its level increased steadily along with spermatogenesis and sexual maturation of the human. The results of heat stress experiment demonstrate that TSARG7 expression has a relation with temperature. In conclusion, our study suggests that we have cloned a novel human gene and this gene may play an important role in human spermatogenesis and sexual maturation.
