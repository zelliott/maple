Although it is now well established that a substantial proportion of wild-living primates in sub-Saharan Africa harbor SIV, no study to date has examined to what extent the various species are naturally infected. In this study, we first describe the development and validation of sensitive and specific SIV antibody detection assays representing all major known primate lentiviral lineages on a panel of 207 sera from 11 different primate species with known infection status. The newly developed assays were then used to determine SIV prevalence rates in nine primate species native to Cameroon. Analysis of 722 sera revealed widely varying prevalence rates, ranging from an apparent absence of SIV infection in crested mona (0/70), grey cheeked (0/36) and agile mangabeys (0/92), to prevalence rates of 3%, 4%, 11%, 27%, 39% and 52% for mustached (6/203), greater spot-nosed (8/193), northern talapoin (3/26), mantled guereza (14/52), De Brazza's (9/23) and mandrill (14/27) monkeys, respectively. The epidemiology of naturally occurring SIV infections is thus more complex than previously appreciated and the various non-human primate hosts seem to differ in their susceptibility to SIV infection. The newly developed assays should now permit to define with greater accuracy existing SIV reservoirs and associated human zoonotic risk.
