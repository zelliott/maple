The molecular interaction of the Fab fragment of the human monoclonal antibody 3D6, directed against the transmembrane protein gp41 of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1, with its peptide epitope is characterized by a panel of overlapping peptides, a peptide epitope library and molecular modeling techniques. The sequence CSGKLICTTAVPW, corresponding to amino acids 605-617 of gp41, was identified as the best binding peptide (KD = 1 x 10(-8) mol/l). This peptide served as a starting point to prepare a cellulose-bound peptide epitope library in which each residue of the epitope is substituted by all L- and D-amino acids, resulting in 494 epitope peptide variants which were subsequently analyzed for binding 3D6. The library was synthesized to identify residues critical for binding and to obtain information about the molecular environment of the epitope peptide bound to 3D6. Both cysteine residues, as well as isoleucine 6, threonine 8 and proline 12, of the epitope were highly sensitive to substitution. Using the data obtained from the epitope characterization, as well as a low-resolution electron density map of a 3D6 Fab-peptide complex, a 3-D model of the Fab-peptide complex was generated by molecular modeling. The modeling experiments predict binding of the peptide, which is cyclized via the two cysteine residues, to a pocket formed dominantly by the hypervariable loops complementarity determining regions CDR3L, CDR2H and CDR3H.
