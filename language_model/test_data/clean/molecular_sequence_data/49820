Hantavirus infections are a major public health concern worldwide. Their widespread geographical distribution and their ability to produce serious, often fatal, human disease underline the need for a system that allows manipulation of these viruses. We describe here the first successful establishment of a reverse genetics technology for Hantaan virus, the prototype of the genus Hantavirus. The system offers a unique opportunity to study the biology of hantaviruses, the pathogenesis of the diseases, and the efficacy of antiviral and prophylactic measures against hantavirus infections.
