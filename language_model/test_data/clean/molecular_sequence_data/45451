RNA helicases of the DEAD-box family are involved in essentially all RNA-dependent cellular processes. In this issue of Cell, Sengoku et al. (2006) solve the structure of the DEAD-box protein Vasa in the presence of RNA and a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog and provide important insights into how this family of helicases unwinds RNA.
