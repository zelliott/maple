In this communication we present the results obtained by the use of magnetic beads in diagnosis, for the identification of genetic variants at the molecular level by sequencing, in comparison with the more laborious method of the production of ssDNA with asymmetric PCR. We compared the two techniques studying variants of beta globin gene: Hb Abruzzo [beta 143 (H21) His -> Arg] and Hb D Los Angeles [beta 121 (GH4) Glu -> Gln].
