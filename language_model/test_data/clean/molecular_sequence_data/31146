A rapid, non-radioactive assay for the detection of proviral Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in tissue-culture cells is described. The assay is based on the co-amplification of the SIV env and gag genes by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). When the gag PCR product is blotted onto a nylon membrane and hybridised to a radioactive oligonucleotide probe, the assay can also be used to detect the SIV gag gene in DNA isolated directly from experimentally infected cynomolgus macaque lymphocytes. This provides a valuable assay for the presence of proviral SIV during animal trials of AIDS vaccines and chemotherapeutics.
