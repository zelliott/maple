A Gram-negative, pleomorphic, extremely halophilic archaeon, designated strain XH-70(T), was isolated from the saline Lake Xilinhot, in Inner Mongolia, China. It formed small (0.9-1.5 mm), red-pigmented, elevated colonies on agar medium. The strain required at least 2.5 M NaCl and 5 mM Mg(2+) for growth. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain XH-70(T) belongs to the family Halobacteriaceae, showing 99.5 % similarity to the type strain of Halovivax asiaticus and 94.7 and 94.6 % similarity, respectively, to the type strains of Natronococcus amylolyticus and Natronococcus occultus. Polar lipid analysis supported the placement of strain XH-70(T) in the genus Halovivax. DNA-DNA hybridization studies (32 % with Halovivax asiaticus CGMCC 1.4248(T)), as well as biochemical and physiological characterization, allowed strain XH-70(T) to be differentiated from Halovivax asiaticus. A novel species, Halovivax ruber sp. nov., is therefore proposed to accommodate this strain. The type strain is XH-70(T) (=CGMCC 1.6204(T)=DSM 18193(T)=JCM 13892(T)).
