On the basis of the recently determined genome sequence of Listeria monocytogenes, we performed a global analysis of the surface-protein-encoding genes. Only proteins displaying a signal peptide were taken into account. Forty-one genes encoding LPXTG proteins, including the previously known internalin gene family, were detected. Several genes encoding proteins that, like InlB and Ami, possess GW modules that attach them to lipoteichoic acids were also identified. Additionally, the completed genome sequence revealed genes encoding proteins potentially anchored in the cell membrane by a hydrophobic tail as well as genes encoding P60-like proteins and lipoproteins. We describe these families and discuss their putative implications for host-pathogen interactions.
