A structural region of the hepatitis C virus genome was molecularly cloned. A protein expressed in vitro by transcription followed by translation was precipitated immunologically by sera from patients with chronic hepatitis or hepatocellular carcinoma that were positive for antibody against the non-structural protein, C100, of hepatitis C virus, but not by sera from healthy persons. Thus, this structural protein should be useful for detection of infection with this virus.
