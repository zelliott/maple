Recent studies have suggested that frameshift mutations in the attachment protein gene of respiratory syncytial (RS) virus may contribute to its variability. Many pathogens use several mechanisms for antigenic variation to elude their hosts' immune responses, and the frameshift mechanism is not unique to RS virus. Indeed, it may turn out to be a widespread genetic phenomenon among pathogens.
