The hematopoietic-specific DNA-binding protein B1 binds to the DNA consensus sequence AAAGRGGAARYG located twice in intervening sequence 2 of both of the mouse beta-globin genes (D. L. Galson and D.E. Housman, Mol. Cell. Biol. 8:381-392, 1988). B1 was cloned by expression of a murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell cDNA library in transfected COS cells and screening by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. B1 is identical to the proto-oncogene Spi-1/PU.1 (Spi-1), an ets family member. Protein-DNA contacts are shown to resemble those of the helix-turn-helix homeodomain proteins. By Northern (RNA) analysis, we found that Spi-1 mRNA is present at low levels during murine CFU-E maturation and is at least 20-fold higher in uninduced MEL, a transformed proerythroblast-like cell line which contains an activating/transforming insertion of spleen focus-forming virus at the Spi-1 locus. Dimethyl sulfoxide-induced MEL cell differentiation decreases Spi-1 mRNA to approximately 20% of the uninduced level before commitment occurs. In addition to erythroid cells, Spi-1 mRNA is present in B cells, myelomonocytes, and mast cells but not in T cells and nonhematopoietic cell types. In situ hybridization demonstrated Spi-1 mRNA expression in bone marrow, spleen, interstitial nonhepatocytes of the liver, and interstitial nontubular cells of the testis. The Spi-1 locus was mapped on human chromosome 11 to the same interval as ACP2 (lysosomal acid phosphatase), between the anonymous DNA markers D11S33 and D11S14. This region has not yet been found to be associated with a human malignancy.
