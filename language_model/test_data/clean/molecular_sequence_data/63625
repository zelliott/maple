The transcriptional regulators RamA, RamB and GlxR were detected to bind to the promoter region of the resuscitation promoting factor 2 (rpf2) gene involved in growth and culturability of Corynebacterium glutamicum. DNA-binding sites were identified by bioinformatic analysis and verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays with purified hexahistidyl-tagged proteins. Carbon source-dependent deregulation of rpf2 expression was demonstrated in vivo in ramA and ramB mutants and in a C. glutamicum strain overexpressing glxR. The deduced network of regulatory interactions provided insights into the complex regulation pattern of rpf2 expression in C. glutamicum.
