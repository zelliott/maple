The human kallikrein (KLK) family consists of 15 genes located on human chromosome 19q13.4. KLK11/hippostasinis a member of the kallikrein family and is expressed in various tissues. Two types of KLK11 isoforms, isoform 1 and isoform 2, have been predicted from cDNA sequences. Isoform 1 has been isolated from human hippocampus, whereas isoform 2 has been isolated from prostate. However, the regulation and characteristics of these isoforms are unknown. We identified the first three exons (1a, 1b, and 1c) by determining their transcription initiation sites. Exon 1b contained the initiation codon of isoform 2, and noncoding exons 1a and 1c contributed to isoform 1 mRNA. The dual luciferase promoter assay revealed three promoter regions, corresponding to the first exon of each isoform. Reverse transcription and PCR showed that exon 1a was expressed in the hippocampus, thalamus, and non-central nervous system (CNS) tissues, whereas exon 1b was detected only in non-CNS tissues. Exon 1c was observed in both CNS and non-CNS tissues, except for salivary glands. In vitro mutagenesis revealed that the initiation codon for isoform 2 in exon 1b was functional. Isoform 2 had additional hydrophilic amino acids at the amino terminal and was secreted from the neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2a. Isoform 1 fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) was distributed to cellular processes, whereas isoform 2-GFP was retained in the Golgi apparatus. We suggest that not only alternative splicing but also tissue-specific use of multiple promoters regulate the expression and intracellular trafficking of KLK11/hippostasin isoforms.
