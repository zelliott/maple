The 3'-terminal part of RNA1 genome segment of Radish mosaic virus (RaMV) including complete RNA polymerase gene was sequenced. The 207 amino acids long polymerase is matured from a polyprotein precursor by cleavage at putative Q/H site by viral protease. The alignment of available amino acid sequences of RNA polymerase genes of comoviruses revealed a closest (55%) identity of RaMV to Red clover mottle virus (RCMV).
