To investigate the DNA homology between the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated from the wounds caused by earthquake and those from the patients from non-earthquake-stricken areas.

Five MRSA isolates were obtained from the wounds caused by earthquake of 5 in-patients admitted into the West China Hospital, and 6 MRSA isolates were obtained from the inpatient of the same hospital during the same period. DNA fingerprint alas was obtained by repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based PCR (Rep-PCR) and homolog analysis was conducted with the help of Rep-based DiversiLab Microbial Typing system.

Five different patterns (A-E) were found among the 11 MRSA strains. The 5 strains isolated from the wounds caused by earthquake included subtype A (n = 1), subtype B (n = 2), subtype C (n = 1), and subtype E (n = 1). And the 6 stains isolated from the patient that come from non-earthquake-stricken areas included A (n = 3), subtype B (n = 1), subtype C (n = 1), and subtype D (n = 1).

The MRSA stains isolated from the wounds caused by earthquake are highly homologous with those isolated from the patient from non-disastrous areas during the same period.
