In Bacillus subtilis, the DNA binding protein Spo0A activates transcription from two classes of promoters, those used by RNA polymerase containing the primary sigma factor, sigma(A) (e.g., spoIIG), and those used by RNA polymerase containing the secondary sigma factor, sigma(H) (e.g., spoIIA). Several single amino acid substitutions in region 4 of sigma(A) define positions in sigma(A) that are specifically required for Spo0A-dependent promoter activation. Similarly, several single amino acid substitutions in Spo0A define positions in Spo0A that are required for sigma(A)-dependent promoter activation but not for other functions of Spo0A. It is unknown whether these amino acids in Spo0A interact directly with those in region 4 of sigma(A) or whether they interact with another subunit of RNA polymerase to effect promoter activation. Here we report the identification of a new amino acid in region 4 of sigma(A), arginine at position 355 (R355), that is involved in Spo0A-dependent promoter activation. To further investigate the role of R355, we used the coordinates of Spo0A and sigma region 4, each in complex with DNA, to build a model for the interaction of sigma(A) and Spo0A at the spoIIG promoter. We tested the model by examining the effects of amino acid substitutions in the putative interacting surfaces of these molecules. As predicted by the model, we found genetic evidence for interaction of R355 of sigma(A) with glutamine at position 221 of Spo0A. These results appear to define the surfaces of Spo0A and sigma(A) that directly interact during activation of the spoIIG promoter.
