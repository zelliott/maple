A Ugandan isolate of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), designated U455, was adapted to growth in U937 cells, the provirus cloned into the lambda L47.1 vector, and its DNA sequence determined. The sequences of some of the U455 genes showed a marked divergence from those of North American and other African isolates. The sequenced clone was defective with single in-phase stop codons in the vpr and env genes and frame shift, resulting in a stop codon, within the vpu gene.
