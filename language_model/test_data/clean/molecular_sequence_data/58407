A stretch of DNA approximately 27 kb in length, adjacent to the nprE gene of Bacillus subtilis, has been sequenced. The sequenced fragment carries a total of 23 ORFs. Of these, 15 could be assigned probable functions based on homologies to characterized genes either in B. subtilis or in other organisms. The sequencing of this region has also allowed us to assign to this area adeC and strB, previously located on the other side of nprE, between nprE and the pyr operon.
