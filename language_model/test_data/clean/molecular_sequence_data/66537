We sequenced VP3 gene of four rotavirus strains and examined the diversity of VP3 and its other genetic characteristics in a total of 22 Group A rotaviruses. The 22 rotavirus strains were derived from six different host species (human, avian, bovine, equine, simian and porcine). Comparison of the partial VP3 peptide sequences (aa 141-294) showed identities ranging from 49 to 99% among different species. The phylogenetic analysis of VP3 sequences revealed segregation according to the species origin. This was further confirmed by identification of three host specific domains within the VP3 peptide. Thus, the host range restriction or attenuation previously shown to associate with VP3 may be attributed to the species-specific nature of the gene.
