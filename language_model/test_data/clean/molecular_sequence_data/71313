15-Lipoxygenases and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidases (PH-GPx) are counterparts in the metabolism of hydroperoxy lipids and a balanced regulation of both enzymes appears to be important for the cellular peroxide tone regulating the expression of redox sensitive genes. In contrast to lipoxygenases the molecular biology of PH-GPx is less well investigated. In this study we cloned the PH-GPx cDNA from a mouse fibroblast cDNA library and the PH-GPx gene from a mouse genomic library. The gene spans approximately 4 kb which includes 1 kb of 5'-flanking region and consists of seven exons and six introns. The immediate promoter region does not contain a TATA box but there are binding sites for several transcription factors which also occur in the porcine gene. Our investigations provide useful tools for future targeted gene disruption studies.
