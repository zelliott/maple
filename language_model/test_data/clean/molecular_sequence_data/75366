The nucleotide sequence of gene 18 of bacteriophage T4 was determined by the Maxam-Gilbert method, partially aided by the dideoxy method. To confirm the deduced amino acid sequence of the tail sheath protein (gp18) that is encoded by gene 18, gp18 was extensively digested by trypsin or lysyl endopeptidase and subjected to reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Approximately 40 peptides, which cover 88% of the primary structure, were fractionated, the amino acid compositions were determined, and the corresponding sequences in DNA were identified. Furthermore, the amino acid sequences of 10 of the 40 peptides were determined by a gas phase protein sequencer, including N- and C-terminal sequences. Thus, the complete amino acid sequence of gp18, which consists of 658 amino acids with a molecular weight of 71,160, was determined.
