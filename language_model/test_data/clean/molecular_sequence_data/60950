Overexpression in Escherichia coli of the fdx4 gene from Aquifex aeolicus has allowed isolation and characterization of the first hyperthermophilic [2Fe-2S](Scys)(4) protein, a homodimer of M = 2 x 12.4 kDa with one [2Fe-2S] cluster per subunit. This protein is undamaged by heating to 100 degrees C for at least three hours. The primary structure, in particular the characteristic distribution of the four cysteine ligands of the metal site, and the spectroscopic properties of the A. aeolicus protein relate it to well characterized [2Fe-2S] proteins from Clostridium pasteurianum and Azotobacter vinelandii. These proteins are also homologous to subunits or domains of hydrogenases and NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I) of respiratory chains. The A. aeolicus [2Fe-2S] protein is thus representative of a presumably novel protein fold involved in a variety of functions in very diverse cellular backgrounds.
