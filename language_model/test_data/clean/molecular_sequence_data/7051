The construction of a two-dimensional protein database of the human heart is presented. The database contains information on about 300 abundant proteins of human myocardial tissue, including approximately 40 proteins that were identified by different methods. Each protein was characterized according to several parameters, including molecular weight, isoelectric point, name, partial sequence, subcellular localization, and genetic as well as embryonic changes.
