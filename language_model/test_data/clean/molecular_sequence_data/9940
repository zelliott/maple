Recently a second estrogen receptor termed estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) has been cloned and characterized, and shown to be expressed at the highest levels in ovarian granulosa cells and prostatic epithelium. In the course of amplifying a region of the ligand-binding domain of the rat ERbeta cDNA we identified a second, larger transcript which appears to arise through differential splicing. The second isoform has 54 nucleotides inserted after position 1372 encoding 18 additional amino acids. Both isoforms are expressed at similar relative abundance in a range of tissues.
