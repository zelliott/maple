The 16S rRNA primary structure of Eubacterium fossor was determined by sequencing in vitro amplified rDNA. Sequence comparisons indicated that E. fossor has a specific phylogenetic association with the Atopobium species and is far from E. limosum, the type species of the genus Eubacterium. Phenotypic characters of E. fossor resemble those of the genus Atopobium. Therefore, we propose that E. fossor should be transferred to the genus Atopobium as Atopobium fossor comb. nov.
