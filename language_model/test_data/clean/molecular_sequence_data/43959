Focusing of the serine protease urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) to the cell surface via interaction with its specific receptor (uPAR, CD87) is an important step for tumor cell invasion and metastasis. The ability of a synthetic peptide derived from the uPAR-binding region of uPA (comprising amino acids 16-32 of uPA; uPA(16-32)) to inhibit binding of fluorescently labeled uPA to uPAR on human promyeloid U937 cells was assessed by quantitative flow cytofluorometric analysis (FACS) and compared to the inhibitory capacities of other synthetic peptides known to interfere with uPA/uPAR-interaction. An about 3000-fold molar excess of uPA(16-32) resulted in 50% inhibition of pro-uPA binding to cell surface-associated uPAR. Using a solid-phase uPA-ligand binding assay employing recombinant soluble uPAR coated to microtiter plates, the minimal binding region of wild-type uPA was determined. The linear peptide uPA(19-31) and its more stable disulfide-bridged cyclic form (cyclo(19,31)uPA(19-31)) displayed uPAR-binding activity whereas other peptides such as uPA(18-30), uPA(20-32) or uPA(20-30) did not react with uPAR. Cyclic peptide derivatives of cyclo(19,31)uPA(19-31) in which certain amino acids were deleted and/or replaced by other amino acids as well as uPAR-derived wild-type peptides did also not inhibit uPA/uPAR-interaction. Therefore, the present investigations identified cyclo(19,31)uPA(19-31) as a potential lead structure for the development of uPA-peptide analogues to block uPA/uPAR-interaction.
