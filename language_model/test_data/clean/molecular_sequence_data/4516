We report the molecular cloning, chromosome mapping and developmental transcription pattern of a putative serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C), DPP2C1, from Drosophila melanogaster. The 6-kb transcript of this first Drosophila PP2C gene encodes a 1428-aa deduced protein. The DPP2C1 protein contains a approximately 330-aa PP2C-like catalytic domain flanked by extensive N- and C-terminal sequences showing no similarities to other PP2Cs. The dpp2c1 gene maps to 4E1-2 on the X chromosome, 1.5 kb upstream of the ddlc1 gene. Northern blot analyses showed that dpp2c1 transcription is developmentally regulated, accumulating maximally during early (0-6 h) and late (12-24 h) embryogensis. The presented molecular characterisation provides the basis for a genetic dissection of DPP2C1 function.
