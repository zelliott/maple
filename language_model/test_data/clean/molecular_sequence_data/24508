Promoter variants differing in potential cis-acting elements and showing impaired binding of corresponding transcription factors are described in the inducible porcine hsp70.2 gene (GC box; initiator-like region, InR) and in its bovine homologue (AP2 site), respectively. Interestingly, all these promoter variants are stable established in the analysed populations in spite of significant negative effects on transcriptional activity and indications of not neutral behaviour in response to breeding selection. Moreover, in pigs they are likely to be evolutionary fixed as suggested by their presence in recent breeds and in wild boars as well. Compensation of the effect of the observed 'down'-mutations by further yet unknown gene variants is assumed.
