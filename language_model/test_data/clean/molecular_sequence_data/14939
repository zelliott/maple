Given that the intensive application of sulfonamides in aquaculture, animal husbandry and malaria treatment has lead to an increase in sulfonamide discharge into the environment, there is an increasing need to find a way to remediate sulfonamide-contaminated sites. The bacterial strain DX7 was isolated from a marine environment and is capable of degrading sulfadoxine. DX7 was identified as a Pseudomonas sp. based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Approximately 30% of sulfadoxine was degraded after Pseudomonas sp. DX7 was inoculated into mineral salt plus tryptone media containing 10 mg l(-1) sulfadoxine for 2 days. The degradation efficiency under different environmental conditions was characterized using HPLC. The optimal temperature and pH for sulfadoxine biodegradation were around 30°C and 6.0, respectively. The optimal concentrations of sulfadoxine and tryptone for sulfadoxine biodegradation were determined to be approximately 30 mg l(-1) and between 2.0 and 8.0 g l(-1), respectively. Cytotoxicity analysis indicated that the metabolites of sulfadoxine generated by Pseudomonas sp. DX7 showed significantly reduced cytotoxicity to Hela cells. These results suggest that Pseudomonas sp. DX7 is a new bacterial resource for degrading sulfadoxine and indicate the potential of the isolated strain in the bioremediation of sulfadoxine-contaminated environments.
