The leuX gene of Escherichia coli codes for a suppressor tRNA and forms a single gene operon containing its own promoter and Q-independent terminator. An analysis of the in vitro processing of leuX precursor revealed that the processing of the 5' end took place in a single-step reaction catalysed by RNase P while the 3' processing involved two successive reactions. The endonucleolytic cleavage activity of the 3' precursor sequence was found to copurify with RNase P. Heat inactivation of thermosensitive RNase P from two independent E. coli mutants abolished the cleavage activity of both the 5' and 3' ends. These results altogether suggest that RNase P carries the activity of 3' end cleavage as well as that of 5' processing. In the presence of Mg2+ alone, the leuX precursor was found to be self-cleaved at a site approximately 13 nt inside from the 5' end of mature tRNA. The self-cleaved precursor tRNA was no longer processed by the 3' endonuclease, suggesting that the 3' endonuclease recognizes a specific conformation of the precursor tRNA for action.
