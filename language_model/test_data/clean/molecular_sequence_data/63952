The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins play an important role in drug resistance and detoxification in various organisms. Here we isolated LaMDR2, a new member of the multidrug resistance (MDR) subfamily of ABC proteins in Leishmania amazonensis. LaMDR2 exhibited 47% amino acid identity to its most closely related protein, LaMDR1, which was previously isolated from the same species. Promastigotes that overexpressed LaMDR2 showed significant resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), but not to LaMDR1 substrates. Expression of LaMDR2 in the transfectants was relatively higher in the log phase than the stationary phase, and a lower accumulation of [(3)H]5-FU was observed in the log-phase cells. These results suggest that LaMDR2 is involved in extrusion of xenobiotics, but functionally different from LaMDR1.
