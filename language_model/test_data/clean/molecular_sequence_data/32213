Vibrio cholerae NRT36S is a non-cholera toxin-producing, non-O1 strain that causes diarrhea in volunteers. The genome of NRT36S was sequenced to create a draft containing 174 contigs plus the superintegron region. Our analysis of the draft genome revealed several putative toxin genes and colonization factors. Besides confirming the existence of nonagglutinable heat-stable toxin, we also identified the genes for a type three secretion system, a putative exotoxin, two different RTX toxins, and four pilus systems.
