Another method has been developed to attach synthetic peptides to solid supports for use in enzyme immunoassays. The method is based on passively adsorbing a synthetic peptide to a solid-phase support, then further attaching more of the same peptide by means of cross-linking to the previously adsorbed peptide. This method results in highly enhanced peptide immunoreactivity compared with that obtained with standard methodologies.
