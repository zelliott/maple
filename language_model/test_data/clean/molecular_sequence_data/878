We report here a novel DRB1 allele (DRB1*1147) identified by sequence-based typing. The DRB1*1147 allele was detected during routine human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-typing of a patient and his family prior to bone marrow transplantation. This allele was found in the patient and his two sisters and five brothers. The new allele is identical to DRB1*110601 at exon 2 except for a single-nucleotide substitution at codon 37 (TAC-->TCC), changing the encoded tyrosine to serine.
