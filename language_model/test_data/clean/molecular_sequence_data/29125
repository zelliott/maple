Automated fluorescence sequencing depends on high-quality plasmid DNA, which is conveniently prepared by minipreparation procedures. While those procedures are effective for high-copy number plasmids, purity and yields of low-copy number plasmids are often not sufficient to achieve reasonable sequencing results. Here, we describe a reproducible and cheap procedure for the small-scale preparation of plasmid DNA, which is based on the original Holmes and Quigley protocol, comprising a boiling and two selective precipitation steps. Besides various other modifications, this procedure utilizes polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation as a key step to further purify plasmid DNA tailored to automated fluorescence sequencing. Independent of the plasmid size and copy number, the modified procedure yields plasmid DNA, which gives average reading lengths of 800 and more bases with a standard fluorescence cycle sequencing protocol. To demonstrate the efficiency and reproducibility of the method, sequencing data of various human interleukin-6 gene variants cloned in different vectors are presented. This procedure offers an economical alternative to commercial miniprep kits, utilizing silica resins or anion-exchanger matrices and, moreover, is more reliable and consistent with respect to reading lengths and accuracy in automated fluorescence sequencing.
