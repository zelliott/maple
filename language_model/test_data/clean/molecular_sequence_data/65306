A Gram-negative, heterotrophic, aerobic, reddish-orange-pigmented, non-spore-forming, non-motile bacterial strain, designated 7-UAH(T), was isolated from salty water from the athalassohaline lagoon at El Hito, located in central Spain. The strain grew optimally at 37 degrees C and pH 7.0 and in the presence of 2.5 % NaCl. A polyphasic taxonomic study was carried out in order to characterize the strain in detail. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons indicated that strain 7-UAH(T) clustered within the branch constituted by species of the genus Hongiella, which were recently transferred to the genus Algoriphagus. Analysis of the polar lipid profile and DNA G+C content also supported placement of strain 7-UAH(T) within the genus Algoriphagus. On the basis of its phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic distinctiveness, strain 7-UAH(T) represents a novel species of the genus Algoriphagus, for which the name Algoriphagus hitonicola sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 7-UAH(T) (=CECT 7267(T) =CCM 7449(T)).
