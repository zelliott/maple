Two formally C-xylosylated analogs to 2-naphthyl beta-D-xylopyranoside, which is known to initiate priming of glucosaminoglycan chains, were synthesized by a position inversion of glucose (i.e., position 1 becomes position 5). The D-C-xyloside showed priming, while the L-C-xyloside did not initiate priming.
