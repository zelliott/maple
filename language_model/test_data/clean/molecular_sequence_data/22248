The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) system serves to export fully folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. In many bacteria, three major components, TatA, TatB and TatC, are the functionally essential constituents of the Tat system. A Myxococcus xanthus tatB-tatC deletion mutant could aggregate and form mounds, but was unable to form fruiting bodies under nutritionally limiting conditions. When tatB-tatC mutant vegetative cells were cultured with 0.5 M glycerol, the cell morphology changed to spore-like spherical cells, but the spores were not resistant to heat and sonication treatments. In contrast to the wild-type strain, the tatB-tatC mutant also showed a decreased cell growth rate and a lower maximum cell concentration. These results suggest possibility that the Tat system may contribute to export of various important proteins for development and growth for M. xanthus.
