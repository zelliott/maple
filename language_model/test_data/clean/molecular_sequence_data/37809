We determined the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences (1140 bp) of one subspecies of the European red deer (Cervus elaphus in Europe), three subspecies of the wapiti (C. elaphus in Asia and North America), and six subspecies of the sika deer (C. nippon in Japan). Our phylogenetic analysis revealed the monophyly of the European red deer, that of the wapiti, and that of the sika deer. The wapiti, however, was shown to be more closely related to the sika deer than to the European red deer. This is in conflict with traditional morphological results, which suggest a close sister group relationship between the wapiti and the European red deer. The divergence time between the European red deer and the wapiti plus the sika deer was estimated to be approximately 0.80 Ma, and that between the wapiti and the sika deer was estimated to be 0.57 Ma. The sika deer was subdivided into two subspecies groups, and the wapiti was also found to consist of an Asian group and a North American group.
