Lipoprotein-(a) [Lp(a)] is a highly atherogenic lipoprotein with unknown function, consisting of a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) core and the apo(a) glycoprotein. The characteristic structural feature of apo(a) is the presence of multiple so called "kringle' repeats which are in part identical and in part exhibit slight sequence differences. The assembly of apo(a) and LDL, which is determinant for plasma Lp(a) levels, takes place extracellularly and requires specific structural motifs in apo(a) and apoB. Here we studied the structural features in apo(a) necessary for high-efficient assembly. Thirteen recombinant apo(a) glycoproteins, which differed in the set of kringle-IV (K-IV) motifs, were expressed in COS-7 cells and incubated with LDL. The rate of total and disulfide-stabilized Lp(a) complex formation was measured by an immunochemical assay. Constructs containing K-IV T(type)5-T10 yielded almost 100% total and 80% stable complexes, respectively. Deletion or replacement of the different kringles revealed that K-IV T6 and T7 were responsible for the high-yield assembly and that K-IV T5 had an amplifying effect. Increasing the absolute number of K-IV repeats had an additional amplifying effect. The rate of Lp(a) assembly correlated strongly with the affinity of these constructs to Lys-Sepharose. Our results have implications for understanding the metabolism of Lp(a) and may help to design strategies for searching natural apo(a) mutants with aberrant plasma Lp(a) levels.
