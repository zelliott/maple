Transhydrogenase couples the stereospecific and reversible transfer of hydride equivalents from NADH to NADP(+) to the translocation of proton across the inner membrane in mitochondria and the cytoplasmic membrane in bacteria. Like all transhydrogenases, the Escherichia coli enzyme is composed of three domains. Domains I and III protrude from the membrane and contain the binding site for NAD(H) and NADP(H), respectively. Domain II spans the membrane and constitutes at least partly the proton translocating pathway. Three-dimensional models of the hydrophilic domains I and III deduced from crystallographic and NMR data and a new topology of domain II are presented. The new information obtained from the structures and the numerous mutation studies strengthen the proposition of a binding change mechanism, as a way to couple the reduction of NADP(+) by NADH to proton translocation and occurring mainly at the level of the NADP(H) binding site.
