To find protein-protein interactive sites in complement component C3, we examined regions of C3 that are proximal to sites of length polymorphism or indels in the C345 protein family. We reasoned that indels probably mark protein interactive sites because they usually involve residues at protein surfaces. To test for the involvement of individual indels, we examined the effects on complement function of synthetic peptides corresponding to indel-proximal segments of C3. We inferred that if such a segment made direct contact with a C3 binding protein, then the corresponding peptide might also bind to that protein and inhibit binding to C3. Twenty-one peptides were tested; four of these inhibited complement-mediated erythrocyte lysis at < or =100 microM and complement-mediated killing of Escherichia coli at about threefold higher levels. These results indicate that the four peptides act as specific inhibitors of complement. They also suggest that indels can be effective guides for locating interactive sites in C3 and in any protein that is a member of a protein family. Because only a linear sequence is required, a focus on indels may be particularly useful for identifying interactive sites in proteins for which a three-dimensional structure is unavailable.
