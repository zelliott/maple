Cultured endothelial cells have been shown to produce insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs); however, the identity of these BPs has not been defined. We now demonstrate that cultured bovine endothelial cells produce IGFBP2, IGFBP3, and IGFBP4 and have mRNA specific for IGFBP2, -3, -4, -5 and -6. DNA probes for bovine IGFBP2-6 were obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of cDNA from bovine large vessel pulmonary artery and aortic endothelial cells as well as omental and periaortic fat microvessel cells, using oligonucleotide primers whose sequences were based on the reported cDNA sequences of IGFBP2-6. The PCR-derived probes were labeled with 32P and used for Northern blot analysis of RNAs obtained from the four bovine endothelial cell types. Transcripts corresponding to IGFBP2-6 were found in RNA from large vessel endothelial cells (bovine pulmonary artery and bovine aorta) and microvessel cells (periaortic and omental fat). The PCR-derived probe for IGFBP4 was used to screen a bovine pulmonary artery cDNA library for a full-length bovine IGFBP4 cDNA clone. One positive clone, containing a single EcoRI insert of approximately 2.0 kilobases, was selected for further characterization by DNA sequence analysis. This clone contained an open reading frame encoding a 258-amino acid protein that was 97% identical to human IGFBP4, 268 basepairs of 5'-untranslated region, and a longer 1044 basepairs of 3'-untranslated region. IGFBP4 protein was purified from bovine pulmonary artery-conditioned medium, shown to have N-terminal amino acid sequence DEAIHCPPCSEEKLARCR (identical to human IGFBP4) and to be secreted in glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms. Immunoblots further demonstrated that microvessel cells, at early passage, secrete predominantly IGFBP2 and IGFBP3, while large vessel cells, at early and late passages, secrete IGFBP3 and IGFBP4. Thus, cultured bovine endothelial cells synthesize and secrete IGFBP2, IGFBP3, and IGFBP4 and have mRNA encoding IGFBP2-6. The production of specific IGFBPs by endothelial cells raises the interesting possibility that the vascular endothelium contributes to circulating and tissue levels of specific IGFBPs in vivo.
