cDNAs encoding the rat liver regulatory protein of glucokinase were cloned and sequenced. The deduced protein contains 568 amino acids for a molecular mass of 62,867 Da. Northern blot analysis showed the presence of a major RNA species of 2.35 kb in rat liver. No signal was observed with muscle, brain, heart, testis, intestine or spleen RNA. Recombinant regulatory protein expressed in Escherichia coli was insoluble and inactive, and was presumably contained in inclusion bodies. Western blot analysis showed that the recombinant protein was recognized by antibodies raised against regulatory protein purified from rat liver.
