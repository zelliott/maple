Expansins are a family of proteins that catalyze pH-dependent long-term extension of isolated plant cell walls. They are divided into two groups, alpha and beta, the latter consisting of the grass group I pollen allergens and their vegetative homologs. Expansins are suggested to mediate plant cell growth by interfering with either structural proteins or the polysaccharide network in the cell wall. Our group reported papain-like properties of beta-expansin of Timothy grass (Phleum pratense) pollen, Phl p 1, and suggested that cleavage of cell wall structural proteins may be the underlying mechanism of expansin-mediated wall extension. Here, we report additional data showing that beta-expansins resemble ancient and modern cathepsin B, which is a member of the papain (C1) family of cysteine proteinases. Using the Pichia pastoris expression system, we show that cleavage of inhibitory prosequences from the recombinant allergen is facilitated by its N-glycosylation and that the truncated, activated allergen shows proteolytic activity, resulting in very low stability of the protein. We also show that deglycosylated, full-length allergen is not activated efficiently and therefore is relatively stable. Motif and homology search tools detected significant similarity between beta-expansins and cathepsins of modern animals as well as the archezoa Giardia lamblia, confirming the presence of inhibitory prosequences, active site and other functional amino-acid residues, as well as a conserved location of these features within these molecules. Lastly, we demonstrate by site-directed mutagenesis that the conserved His104 residue is involved in the catalytic activity of beta-expansins. These results indicate a common origin of cathepsin B and beta-expansins, especially if taken together with their previously known biochemical properties.
