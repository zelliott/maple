Molecular phylogenetic analyses using mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) gene sequences representing all 15 species and the majority of subspecies or races of the Ohomopterus ground beetles from all over the Japanese archipelago have uncovered a remarkable evolutionary history. Clustering of the species in the molecular phylogenetic tree is linked to their geographic distribution and does not correlate with morphological characters. Taxonomically the "same" species or the members belonging to the same species-group fall out in more than two different places on the ND5 tree. Evidence has been presented against a possible participation of ancestral polymorphism and random lineage sorting or of hybrid individuals for the observed distribution of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes. The most plausible explanation of our results is that parallel evolution took place in different lineages. Most notably, O. dehaanii, O. yaconinus, and O. japonicus in a lineage reveal almost identical morphology with those of the "same" species (or subspecies) but belonging to the phylogenetically remote lineages.
