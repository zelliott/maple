Two of the nucleosomal histone families, H3 and H2A, have highly conserved variants with specialized functions. Recent studies have begun to elucidate the roles of two of the H2A variants, H2AX and H2AZ. H2AX is phosphorylated on a serine four residues from the carboxyl terminus in response to the introduction of DNA double-strand breaks, whether these breaks are a result of environmental insult, metabolic mistake, or programmed process. H2AZ appears to alter nucleosome stability, is partially redundant with nucleosome remodeling complexes, and is involved in transcriptional control.
