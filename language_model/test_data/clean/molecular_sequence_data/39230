The complete nucleotide sequence of a tospovirus isolated from Lycopersicum esculentum in Thailand was determined. The L RNA comprises of 8912 nt and codes for the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) (2877 aa). Two ORFs are located on the M RNA (4823 nt) encoding the non-structural (NSm) protein (308 aa) and the viral glycoprotein precursors (Gn/Gc) (1121 aa) separated by an intergenic region of 433 nt. ORFs coding for the non-structural (NSs) and nucleocapsid (N) protein, 439 aa and 275 aa, respectively, were identified on the S RNA (3477 nt) separated by an intergenic region of 1202 nt. The N protein of the Thailand isolate was most closely related to that of capsicum chlorosis virus (CaCV), sharing an amino acid sequence identity of 92.7%. Additionally, multiple sequence analyses revealed significant similarities to tospoviruses of the species Watermelon silver mottle virus and to several putative tospovirus entries in GenBank. Based on these alignments it is proposed to refer to all these different viruses as isolates of CaCV.
