The leukocyte cell surface glycoprotein CD45 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase and is involved in signal transduction mediated by the T cell antigen receptor. The asparagine-linked sugar chains were released as oligosaccharides from purified CD45 by hydrazinolysis. Approximately 6 mol of sugar chains was released from 1 mol of CD45. These sugar chains were converted to radioactive oligosaccharides by reduction with NaB3H4 and separated into neutral and acidic fractions by paper electrophoresis. All of the acidic oligosaccharides were converted to neutral ones by digestion with sialidase, indicating that they are sialyl derivatives. Binding of the sialylated oligosaccharides to an SNA-agarose column as well as methylation analysis revealed that the oligosaccharides have only alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid residues. The neutral and sialidase-treated acidic oligosaccharides were fractionated by serial lectin column chromatography followed by Bio-Gel P-4 column chromatography. Structural studies of each oligosaccharide by sequential exo- and endoglycosidase digestion and by methylation analysis revealed that CD45 contains mainly bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary complex-type sugar chains. About 46% of the tetraantennary complex-type sugar chains had the poly(N-acetyllactosamine) groups and 18% of the 2,4-branched triantennary complex-type sugar chains had the fucosyl N-acetyllactosamine group. A portion of the bi- and 2,4-branched triantennary complex-type sugar chains were bisected. In addition to these sugar chains, a small amount of high mannose-type and hybrid-type sugar chains were detected.
