The bicyclams represent a new entity of low-molecular weight molecules that inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection through a specific blockade of CXCR4 (fusin), the receptor for the CXC chemokine SDF-1 (soluble-derived factor), which is also used as coreceptor by T-lymphotropic HIV strains to enter their target cells. The bicyclam AMD3100 or 1,1'-[1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)]-bis-1,4, 8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane octahydrochloride dihydrate, is able to block the CXCR4 receptor and to inhibit HIV replication at nanomolar concentrations while not being toxic to the host cells at 100,000-fold higher concentrations. It is the most specific and most potent CXCR4 antagonist that has been described to date.
