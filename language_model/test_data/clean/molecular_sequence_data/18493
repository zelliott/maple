A novel bacterial strain, designated SGD-1123(T) was isolated from Chorao Island, in Goa Province, India. The strain was found to be able to grow at 15-42 °C, pH 5-12 and 0-12 % (w/v) NaCl. The whole cell hydrolysates were found to contain meso-diaminopimelic acid, galactose and arabinose. The major fatty acids were identified as iso-C15:0 and anteiso-C15:0, MK-7 was identified as the predominant menaquinone and the predominant polar lipids were identified as diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and an unidentified aminolipid. The genomic DNA G+C content was determined to be 44.6 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences placed the isolate within the genus Bacillus and further revealed that strain SGD-1123(T) had highest sequence similarity with Bacillus aquimaris, and forms a separate clade with its closest relatives i.e. B. aquimaris, Bacillus vietnamensis and Bacillus marisflavi, with which it shares 94.5, 94.1 and 94.1 % similarity respectively. The phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic analyses indicated that strain SGD-1123(T) represents a novel species within the genus Bacillus, for which the name Bacillus enclensis is proposed. The type strain is SGD-1123(T) (NCIM 5450(T)=CCTCC AB 2011125(T)).
