Four yeast strains (APSS 805, APSS 806, APSS 815 and AP-18) belonging to a novel Torulaspora species were isolated from coal mine soils of Singareni in Andhra Pradesh state, India. Another strain (PBA-22) was isolated from agricultural field soil from Gujarat state, India. The vegetative cells of all these strains were round, haploid and produced asci by conjugation between independent cells or mother cell and bud, with rough ascospores, suggesting their possible relation to ascomycetous yeast genus Torulaspora. Phylogenetic analysis of the D1/D2 domain of the large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) regions revealed that, among the five strains, three viz. APSS 805, APSS 806 and APSS 815 have identical sequences. The other two strains (AP-18 and PBA-22) differed from the other three strains in less than 1% nucleotide substitutions in the combined D1/D2 domain and ITS sequences, indicating that all of them (five strains) may belong to the same species. These five strains were closely related to Torulaspora globosa, but showed more than 3-7% sequence divergence from T. globosa and all other species in the genus Torulaspora in the combined sequence analysis of D1/D2 domain and ITS region of rRNA gene. In addition, these strains also showed distinct microsatellite finger-printing pattern from related species and differed in several physiological responses suggesting that these strains belong to a novel species of Torulaspora. We propose to name these strains as Torulaspora indica sp. nov., and designate APSS 805(T) = MTCC 9772 (T) = CBS 12408 (T) as the type strain of this novel species. The Mycobank number of the novel species is MB 563738.
