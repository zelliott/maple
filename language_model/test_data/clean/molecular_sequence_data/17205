Infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) is the type species of the genus Isavirus belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae, and causes serious disease in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). This study presents the expression and functional analysis of the ISAV genome segment 3, and provides further evidence that it encodes the viral nucleoprotein (NP). The encoded protein was expressed in a baculovirus system, and Western blot analysis showed that it corresponds to the 66-71 kDa structural protein previously found in purified ISAV preparations. RNA-binding activity was established by the interaction of viral and recombinant NP with single-stranded RNA transcribed in vitro. Immunofluorescence studies of infected cells showed the ISAV NP to be an early protein. It locates to the nucleus of infected cells before it is transported to the cytoplasm prior to virus assembly. A similar localization pattern was observed in cells transfected with the NP gene, confirming that the encoded protein has an intrinsic ability to be imported into the nucleus. Two monopartite nuclear localization signals (NLS) at amino acids (230)RPKR(233) and (473)KPKK(476) were identified by computer analysis, and validated by site-directed mutagenesis. In contrast to other orthomyxovirus-NPs, that have several NLSs that function independent of each other, both NLSs had to be present for the ISAV NP protein to be transported into the nucleus, indicating that these motifs cooperate to target the protein to the nucleus.
