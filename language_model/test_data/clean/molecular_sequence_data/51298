The human transferrin receptor is a glycoprotein containing three N-linked and one O-linked glycosylation sites. Tryptic digestion of the receptor, followed by chromatography on BioGel P-2 and reverse-phase HPLC, yields a glycopeptide (amino acids 101-120) containing the O-linked site. Amino acid sequence analysis reveals that the site of O-glycosylation is Thr-104. Mass spectral analysis is consistent with the presence of a Gal-GalNAc core with predominantly two sialic acid residues.
