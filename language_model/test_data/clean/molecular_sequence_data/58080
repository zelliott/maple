The amplification of the 468 bp fragment of the BHV-1 genome by PCR is described. The 22 bp oligomers from the BHV-1 gI gene were used as primers. For successful amplification the thermal denaturation (100 degrees C/8 min, ice) of the DNA sample was carried out prior to the cycling (95 degrees C for 1 min, 56 degrees C for 1 min, 73 degrees C for 1 min). The presence of glycerol markedly enhances the PCR.
