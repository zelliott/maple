The satellite DNA of ants Messor bouvieri, M. barbarus and M. structor, studied in a previous paper, is organized as tandemly repeated 79-bp monomers in the three species showing high sequence similarity. In the present paper, a mariner-like element (Mboumar) and a new MITE (miniature inverted-repeat transposable element) called IRE-130, inserted into satellite DNA from M. bouvieri, are analyzed. The study of Mboumar element, of its transcription and the putative transposase that it would encode, suggests that it could be an active element. Mboumar elements inserted into IRE-130 elements have also been detected. It is the first time, to our knowledge, that a MITE has been described in Hymenoptera and it is also the first time that a mariner-like element inserted into a MITE has been detected. A mariner-like element, inserted into satellite DNA from M. structor and in M. barbarus, also has been found. The results seem to indicate that transposition events have participated in the satellite DNA mobilization and evolution.
