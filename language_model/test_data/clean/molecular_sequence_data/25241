Amino acids in three highly conserved segments of the Ca2(+)-ATPase. Asp-Pro-Pro-Arg604, Thr-Gly-Asp627, Thr-Gly-Asp703 as well as Asp707, have been proposed to participate in formation of the nucleotide binding site. We have tested this hypothesis by investigating the properties of mutants with alterations to amino acids within these segments. Most of the mutants were found to be defective in Ca2+ transport function. The inactive mutants could be separated into two classes on the basis of the kinetics of phosphoenzyme intermediate formation and decomposition. One group, Asp601----Asn, Pro603----Leu, Asp627----Glu, and Asp703----Asn, formed phosphoenzyme intermediates with ATP in the presence of Ca2+ and with inorganic phosphate only in the absence of Ca2+, indicating that both the high affinity Ca2+ binding sites and the nucleotide binding sites were intact. In each of these mutants, however, the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate (E1P) decayed to the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate very slowly, relative to the wild-type enzyme. Thus the inability of these mutants to transport Ca2+ was accounted for by an apparent block of the transport reaction at the E1P to E2P conformational transition. Another group, Asp601----Glu, Pro603----Gly, Asp707----Glu, and Asp707----Asn, did not form detectable phosphoenzyme intermediates from either ATP or Pi. Although we have demonstrated an effect on Ca2+ transport of mutations in each of the highly conserved regions predicted to be involved in ATP binding, we cannot yet define their roles in ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport.
