To clarify the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in vulvar carcinogenesis in relation to the mutated p53 gene.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify DNA sequences of the viruses and PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis to screen for p53 gene mutations in exons 5-8 from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks including 10 undifferentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) specimens.

HPV and EBV DNA was found in 75% (6/8) and 0% (0/10) of VIN tissues, respectively. Oncogenic HPV 16 was the predominant type. HPV DNA extraction was not possible in 2 VIN specimens. p53 Gene mutation was shown in 20% (2/10) of VIN lesions. No correlation was found between p53 gene mutation the presence of viral HPV or EBV DNA. Mutated p53 was equally distributed between HPV-positive and -negative VIN cases.

Our results suggest that although most undifferentiated VIN lesions are associated with HPV infection, p53 mutations may occur independent of viral infection even in the presence of oncogenic HPV. HPV, but not EBV or p53 gene mutation, can play a role in the pathogenesis of undifferentiated VIN.
