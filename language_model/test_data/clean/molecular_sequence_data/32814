The genes nepAB of a small multidrug resistance (SMR) pump were identified as part of the pAO1-encoded nicotine regulon responsible for nicotine catabolism in Arthrobacter nicotinovorans. When [(14)C]nicotine was added to the growth medium the bacteria exported the (14)C-labelled end product of nicotine catabolism, methylamine. In the presence of the proton-motive force inhibitors 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) or the proton ionophore nigericin, export of methylamine was inhibited and radioactivity accumulated inside the bacteria. Efflux of [(14)C]nicotine-derived radioactivity from bacteria was also inhibited in a pmfR : cmx strain with downregulated nepAB expression. Because of low amine oxidase levels in the pmfR : cmx strain, gamma-N-methylaminobutyrate, the methylamine precursor, accumulated. Complementation of this strain with the nepAB genes, carried on a plasmid, restored the efflux of nicotine breakdown products. Both NepA and NepB were required for full export activity, indicating that they form a two-component efflux pump. NepAB may function as a metabolic valve by exporting methylamine, the end product of nicotine catabolism, and, in conditions under which it accumulates, the intermediate gamma-N-methylaminobutyrate.
