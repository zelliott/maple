Previously we identified a protein of apparent M(r) = 26,000 as the major calsequestrin binding protein in junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles isolated from cardiac and skeletal muscle (Mitchell, R. D., Simmerman, H. K. B., and Jones, L. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 1376-1381). Here we describe the purification and primary structure of the 26-kDa calsequestrin binding protein. The protein was purified 164-fold from cardiac microsomes and shown by immunoblotting to be highly enriched in junctional membrane subfractions. It ran as a closely spaced doublet on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and bound 125I-calsequestrin intensely. Cloning of the cDNA predicted a protein of 210 amino acids containing a single transmembrane domain. The protein has a short N-terminal region located in the cytoplasm, and the bulk of the molecule, which is highly charged and basic, projects into the sarcoplasmic reticulum lumen. Significant homologies were found with triadin and aspartyl beta-hydroxylase, suggesting that all three proteins are members of a family of single membrane-spanning endoplasmic reticulum proteins. Immunocytochemical labeling localized the 26-kDa protein to junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiac and skeletal muscle. The same gene product was expressed in these two tissues. The calsequestrin binding activity of the 26-kDa protein combined with its codistribution with calsequestrin and ryanodine receptors strongly suggests that the protein plays an important role in the organization and/or function of the Ca2+ release complex. Because the 26-kDa calsequestrin binding protein is an integral component of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane in cardiac and skeletal muscle, we have named it Junctin.
