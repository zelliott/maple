Wee1 is a protein kinase that negatively regulates p34cdc2 kinase activity. We have identified a Saccharomyces cerevisiae wee1 homolog encoded by the SWE1 gene. SWE1 overexpression arrests cells in G2 with short spindles whereas deletion of SWE1 did not alter the cell cycle but did eliminate the G2 delay observed in mih1- mutants. Swe1 immunoprecipitates were capable of tyrosine phosphorylating and inactivating p34CDC28 complexed with Clb2, a G2-type cyclin, but not p34CDC28 complexed with Cln2, a G1-type cyclin, consistent with the inability of Swe1 overexpression to inhibit the G1/S transition. These results suggest that specific cyclin subunits target p34CDC28 for distinct regulatory controls which may be important for ensuring proper p34CDC28 function during the cell cycle.
