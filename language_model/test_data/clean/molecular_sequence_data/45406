Pseudocyphellaria crocata, P. neglecta and P. perpetua specimens were examined to investigate links between genetic variation and morphology, geographical distribution and cyanobiont specificity. Fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS), beta-tubulin and cyanobacterial tRNA(Leu) (UAA) intron sequences were used to investigate symbiont diversity in these lichens. Specimens were morphologically distinct but could not be distinguished by ITS sequences. Phylogenetic analyses split the P. crocata specimens into two clades, the larger of which contained P. neglecta and P. perpetua. Five cyanobionts were identified; two of these were in a number of specimens, while three were each restricted to a single lichen thallus. Fungus-specific molecular markers indicated that all specimens belonged to a single phylogenetic species. However, this may contain a cryptic species. Geography was linked to genetic diversity with Canadian specimens forming a monophyletic group, and most Southern Hemisphere specimens grouping together, although Chile represented a hot spot of genetic diversity. There was no connection between fungal genetic diversity and cyanobiont choice, consistent with the presence of a common pool of cyanobionts.
