Ig-like inhibitory receptors have been the focus of intensive research particularly in mouse and human. We report the cloning and characterization of three novel inhibitory chicken Ig-like receptors (CHIR) that display a two Ig-domain extracellular structure, a transmembrane region lacking charged residues and a cytoplasmic domain containing two ITIM. The localization of all receptors to a small genomic region and the hybridization pattern indicated that they belong to a multigene family. The genomic structure of the extracellular domain with two exons encoding the signal peptide and single exons for each Ig domain resembled that of all human leukocyte Ig-like receptors and killer cell Ig-like receptors, whereas the exons encoding the C terminus displayed a structure closely resembling killer cell Ig-like receptor genes. A mAb generated against one receptor designated CHIR-B2 reacted with all B cells and a small T cell subset, but not with monocytes, thrombocytes, or various leukocyte-derived cell lines. The mAb immunoprecipitated a 46-kDa protein from bursal cells and transfected cells. The Src homology 2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)-2 bound to CHIR-B2 even in unstimulated cells, whereas pervanadate treatment induced the tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of several CHIR-B2-associated proteins including SHP-1 and increased levels of SHP-2. Moreover, mAb cross-linking of CHIR-B2 reduced the proliferation of a stable transfected cell line. Together, we have identified a multigene family containing multiple CHIR including one receptor designated CHIR-B2 that is mainly expressed on B lymphocytes and inhibits cellular proliferation by recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2.
