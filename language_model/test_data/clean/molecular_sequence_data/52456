The first part of this work presents the sequence of the first 20 NH2 terminus residues obtained from P30, the major surface Ag of Toxoplasma gondii, purified by HPLC. A synthetic peptide (P30 48-67) has been prepared both in linear form and as a multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) construct. Immunization of mice and rats with the P30 48-67 MAP in the presence of IFA induces high levels of IgG antibodies that recognize both the linear peptide and the MAP construct in ELISA, and P30 in Western blots of NP-40-extracted tachyzoite Ag. Because these sera are negative in immunofluorescence assays with whole tachyzoites, it seems that IgG antibodies induced by P30 48-67 MAP, although recognizing the denatured structure, are unable to recognize the native protein. However, the protective effect of both constructs has then been studied in mice and nude rats. Whereas immunization of mice with the monomeric peptide does not confer any protection against oral infection with 1200 cysts of T. gondii 76K strain (mortality within 11 days), 40% of mice immunized with the MAP construct survived up to 75 days after infection. Nude rats were passively transferred with 5 x 10(4) T lymphocytes from P30 48-67 MAP-immunized Fischer rats before infection with 5 x 10(4) RH strain tachyzoites. They survived up to 40 days after infection and raised an intense IgG antibody response against P30, whereas nude rats transferred with control lymphocytes died within 21 days. This shows that immunization with P30 48-67 MAP also induces an efficient T cell immune response. The present work confirms the recently demonstrated role of P30 in protective immunity and shows the interest of peptide octameric constructions as inducers of partially protective immune responses in toxoplasmosis, as already demonstrated in schistosomiasis.
