We characterized the MHC-related 1 ( MR1) locus in two nonhuman primates species, Pongo pygmaeus and Pan troglodytes. MR1 cDNA sequences encoding several isoforms generated through alternative splicing were observed in both species. Amino acid alignment between the five species in which MR1 has been characterized to date - human, chimpanzee, orangutan, mouse, and rat - reveals a very high degree of conservation specially in the alpha1 and alpha2 domains of the molecule. The main differences concentrate in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. In the three primates species there is a lysine residue inside the putative transmembrane domain which is not present in rodents. Furthermore, the MR1 cytoplasmic region is longer in rodents, with a conserved serine-containing motif that could be involved in endocytosis; remarkably, this motif is absent in the three primate species. We also describe the presence in the chimpanzee of a sequence homologous to the MR1P1 pseudogene previously found in humans.
