The design and development of specific substrates for proteolytic enzymes is reviewed. Particular attention is given to substrates containing the leaving groups 4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide (MNA) and 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (AFC). The MNA substrates are used for histochemical and cytochemical purposes, and they yield a coloured final reaction product when azo-coupled with a diazonium salt, an osmiophilic product for electron microscopy when coupled with hexazotized Pararosaniline, or a fluorescent final reaction product when coupled with 5-nitrosalicylaldehyde. AFC substrates are considerably more sensitive, and they yield the fluorescent product AFC after enzymatic cleavage of the substrate. AFC is not sufficiently water-insoluble to allow (intra)cellular localization, but AFC substrates are successfully used for incubations in microwells (Immu-Probe technique) and for the demonstration of banding patterns after gel electrophoresis (enzyme-directed overlay membrane technique). The methods are discussed with the example of the elucidation of the role of dipeptidylpeptidase IV in autoimmune diseases.
