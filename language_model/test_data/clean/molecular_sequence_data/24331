Heat-induced (90 degrees C, 30 min) beta-elimination of a cystine residue leads to cleavage of a disulfide bond and produces a set of three peptides with a cysteine residue, a thiocysteine residue (+32Da), and a dehydroalanine residue (-34Da). This characteristic feature was observed from somatostatin and insulin by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometric observation of this triplet is useful in identifying the presence of a cystine residue in a peptide, and could assist mass spectrometric identification of the peptide from a database.
