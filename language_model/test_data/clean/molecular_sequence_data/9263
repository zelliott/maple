Interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 play central roles in the regulation of distinct helper T-cell subsets, i.e. Th1 and Th17, respectively. Although IL-12 and IL-23 have been well studied in human and rodent systems, little is known about their significance in other animals, including livestock mammals such as cattle and pigs. In this study, we performed molecular cloning and genetic characterization of a small component of swine IL-23, i.e., IL-23p19; in addition, we identified and performed chromosomal assignment of the genes encoding its receptor (R) subunits IL-23Rα and IL-12Rβ1. These results provide genetic information about both swine IL-23/IL-23R and IL-12/IL-12R systems, which allows for better understanding of IL-12/IL-23 systems involved in pig immunity.
