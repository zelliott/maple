While the C-terminal repeat region of Pf155/RESA, a Plasmodium falciparum vaccine candidate has been extensively studied for B- and T-cell reactivities, little is so far known about the non-repeat region in this respect. The present study aimed at investigating the non-repeat sequence 171-227 of Pf155/RESA for T- and B-cell epitopes. Eight overlapping peptides were synthesised and assayed for their ability to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from P. falciparum-immune donors to proliferate and to induce secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and/or interleukin 4 (IL-4) using the ELISPOT assay. The plasmas of the corresponding donors were tested for antibody reactivity with the same peptides in ELISA. The individual cellular responses to the different peptides varied and in general they were not correlated, emphasising the importance of including several parameters for T-cell activation. The most frequent T-cell responses (proliferation, IFN-gamma and/or IL-4) were seen with two partially overlapping peptides corresponding to the sequences 171-185 and 181-195 that induced responses in 71 and 62% of the donors, respectively. Although, the frequency of responders was high, the magnitude of the responses was generally low. Two overlapping peptides corresponding to the sequence 186-206 bound antibodies from a large number of plasma samples. IL-4 producing cells were frequently found in donors whose sera contained antibodies to the corresponding peptide. However, there was no absolute correlation and many donors having anti-peptide antibodies could also be induced to produce IFN-gamma. In conclusion, the non-repeat region of Pf155/RESA contains several epitopes inducing functionally distinct T-cell responses. The sequence 171-206 was found to contain both B- and T-cell epitopes recognised by almost all individuals naturally primed to malaria. Thus, this sequence should be a useful tool in future immuno-epidemiological studies and/or for inclusion into a subunit vaccine against the asexual blood stages of the P. falciparum parasite.
