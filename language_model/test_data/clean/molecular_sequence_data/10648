A mesophilic, gram-negative, vibrio-shaped, marine, acetate-oxidizing sulfate reducer (strain B54) was isolated from a water-oil separation system on a North Sea oil platform. The optimum conditions for growth were 33 degrees C, pH 6.8 to 7.0, and concentrations of NaCl and MgCl2.6H2O of at least 1 and 0.3%, respectively. Of various organic acids tested, only acetate was used as an electron and carbon source. The presence of 2-oxoglutarate:dye oxidoreductase suggests acetate oxidation via an operative citric acid cycle. Even though growth of most Desulfobacter strains (including strain B54) did not occur on hydrogen, hydrogenase was detected at low activity. The growth yields were 4.6, 13.1, and 9.6 g of (dry weight) cells per mol of acetate oxidized with sulfate, sulfite, and thiosulfate, respectively, as electron acceptors. Strain B54 was able to fix dinitrogen. Desulforubidin and cytochromes of the c and b types were present. The G+C content of the DNA was 47 mol%. Strain B54 is most closely related to Desulfobacter latus, with a 16S rDNA sequence similarity of 98.1%. The DNA-DNA relatedness between them was 40.5%. On the basis of differences in genotypic, phenotypic, and immunological characteristics, we propose that strain B54 is a member of a new species, D. vibrioformis. It can be easily identified and distinguished from other Desulfobacter species by its large, vibrioshaped cells.
