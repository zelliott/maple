We have mapped AFX1 and p54nrb to a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig of Xq13.1 that harbors the X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP) locus DYT3. AFX1 is flanked by loci DXS7116 and Il2R gamma, and p54nrb by loci DXS6673E and DXS7120. The exon-intron structure of both genes was analyzed. AFX1 is composed of three exons with most of exon 3 being untraslated. p54nrb is made up of 12 exons ranging in size from 40 bp to 1227 bp. The start codon is in exon 3 and the stop codon in exon 12. Both genes are expressed in the brain, among other tissues. AFX1 and p54nrb were excluded as candidates of DYT3 by sequencing of the exons and the flanking intronic sequences in an XDP patient and a control, and by Northern blot analysis.
