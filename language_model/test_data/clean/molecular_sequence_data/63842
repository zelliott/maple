Three peroxidase (POD) cDNAs were isolated from dehydration-treated fibrous roots of sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas) plant via the screening of a cDNA library, and their expressions were assessed to characterize functions of each POD in relation to environmental stress. Three PODs were divided into two groups, designated the basic PODs (swpb4, swpb5) and the anionic PODs (swpa7), on the basis of the pI values of mature proteins. Fluorescence microscope analysis indicated that three PODs are secreted into the extracellular space. RTPCR analysis revealed that POD genes have diverse expression patterns in a variety of plant tissues. Swpb4 was abundantly expressed in stem tissues, whereas the expression levels of swpb5 and swpa7 transcripts were high in fibrous and thick pigmented roots. Swpb4 and swpa7 showed abundant expression levels in suspension cultured cells. Three POD genes responded differently in the leaf and fibrous roots in response to a variety of stresses including dehydration, temperature stress, stress-associated chemicals, and pathogenic bacteria.
