There has been interest in the literature in the possible existence of a gene that predisposes to both breast cancer (BC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). We describe the detailed characterisation of one kindred, MON1080, with 10 cases of BC or CRC invasive cancer among 26 first-, second- or third-degree relatives. Linkage analysis suggested that a mutation was present in BRCA2. DNA sequencing from III: 22 (diagnosed with lobular BC) identified a BRCA2 exon 3 542G>T (L105X) mutation. Her sister (III: 25) had BC and endometrial cancer and carries the same mutation. Following immunohistochemical and microsatellite instability studies, mutation analysis by protein truncation test, cDNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR revealed a deletion of MSH2 exon 8 in III: 25, confirming her as a double heterozygote for truncating mutations in both BRCA2 and MSH2. The exon 8 deletion was identified as a 14.9 kb deletion occurring between two Alu sequences. The breakpoint lies within a sequence of 45 bp that is identical in both Alu sequences. In this large BC/CRC kindred, MON1080, disease-causing truncating mutations are present in both MSH2 and BRCA2. There appeared to be no increased susceptibility to the development of colorectal tumours in BRCA2 mutation carriers or to the development of breast tumours in MSH2 mutation carriers. Additionally, two double heterozygotes did not appear to have a different phenotype than would be expected from the presence of a mutation in each gene alone.
