The Drosophila gene jim was identified by an enhancer trap line showing asymmetric dorso-ventral expression in the follicular epithelium. It gives rise to the jim-1 and jim-2 transcripts that contain distinct 5'-UTRs but encode the same nine C(2)H(2) zinc finger protein. From stage 10A onward, jim-1 RNA is transcribed in squamous cells while jim-2 RNA is specific to all non-antero-dorsal columnar cells as the result of repression in antero-dorsal cells by the DER pathway.
