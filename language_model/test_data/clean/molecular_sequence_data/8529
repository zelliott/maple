Adeno-associated virus vector (AAV), a non-pathogenic integrating vector, can integrate on chromosome 19 in humans. But its gene transfer efficiency is quite low. In this study we combined adenovirus (Adv-5) capsid protein or the Fiber protein of Adv with liposome, termed adenosome (adenovirus protein-cationic liposome complex). This complex can bring AAV/CMV-LacZ to the endothelial cells, and improve the efficiency of gene transfer. It may be a novel, specific, stable and safe gene delivery system and will be widely used in human gene therapy.
