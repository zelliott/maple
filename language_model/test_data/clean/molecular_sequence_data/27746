The revised sequence of a bacteriophage P1 DNA fragment containing the 5' end of the tail-fibre gene, gene 19, revealed that this gene is closely preceded by another open reading frame (ORF) of 432 bp. We have designated this ORF as gene R. The tail-fibre gene and gene R are transcriptionally and translationally coupled. Thus, the tail-fibre operon of bacteriophage P1 consists of three genes: gene R, gene 19 (or gene S) and gene U.
