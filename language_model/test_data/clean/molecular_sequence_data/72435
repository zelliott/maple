We have isolated and investigated an esterase/phospholipase A (EC 3.1.1) which is an intrinsic protein of the small-intestine brush border membrane of adult but not of preweaning rabbits. This enzyme had been referred to previously as AdRabB [Boll, W., Schmid-Chanda, T., Semenza, G., & Mantei, N. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 12901-12911]. Its amino acid sequence shows four extensive, homologous repeats between the signal sequence and a hydrophobic stretch in the C-terminal region. We have identified a serine residue (Ser400) in the (unexpectedly) single catalytic site and indicate that this esterase is likely to operate by way of a Ser-His-Asp/Glu triad. This esterase/phospholipase A is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain of 170-180 kDa, agreeing well with the size deduced from its cognate cDNA sequence [Boll, W., et al. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 12901-12911], and it undergoes (at least) N-glycosylation. Once it has reached the brush border membrane, it is subjected in vivo to two types of proteolytic processing, presumably by pancreatic protease(s): a split after Arg263, with loss of the first N-terminal repeat, and two or more cleavages much farther downstream but still located in the luminal bulk of the protein; these splits lead to multiple bands of approximately 140, 125, 100, and 90 kDa.
