In this paper we describe the first complete structure of a fish vitellogenin gene. A 22 kb genomic region from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was cloned and analysed. This region was shown to contain two tandemly arranged vitellogenin genes. Both genes are 98.7% similar, indicating that they result from a recent local duplication. The complete sequence encoding one of the two genes was determined and the gene organization was established. The gene is 10.3 kb long and has 34 exons, it lacks one exon compared to amphibian and avian vitellogenin genes. Exons 22 and 23 of the Xenopus and chicken genes were shown to be merged into a single exon in the trout genome. Other splicing sites appeared highly conserved between the three vertebrate genes. In contrast, little similarity between invertebrate and vertebrate vitellogenin genes was observed with respect to the number and organization of introns. The comparison of 17 independent invertebrate splicing sites with the 34 vertebrate sites indicated that a few sites are probably ancient. However, most of the splicing junctions compared appeared unrelated. Results suggest that vitellogenin genes have been reshaped through multiple insertions and deletions of intervening sequences during evolution.
