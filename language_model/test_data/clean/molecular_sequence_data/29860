The ganglioside fraction of human gastric mucosa was analyzed with a newly established anti-GM2 monoclonal antibody KM531. Using this antibody, accumulation of GM2 was observed in all of four cases of gastric carcinoma. In all ganglioside fractions extracted from normal gastric mucosa obtained from eight cases of peptic ulcer GM2 itself was not detected, but three kinds of glycolipid showing slower mobility than GM2 on thin-layer plates were detected by immunostaining with KM531. These glycolipids were assigned as NGM-1, -2, and -3. They were completely lost in all carcinoma tissues and in non-cancerous gastric mucosa from two cases of gastric cancer, and they were also not detected in the ganglioside fraction of small or large intestine. Of these glycolipids, the major one, NGM-1, was isolated from the pooled ganglioside fraction of normal gastric mucosa obtained from cases of peptic ulcer. The structure was determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance, negative ion fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and treatment with exoglycosidases and mild acid hydrolysis. The structure was GalNAc beta 1----4(NeuAc alpha 2----3) Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----3 Gal beta 1----4Glc beta 1----1Cer, which has the same terminal sequence as GM2 but has internal neolacto series structure. This epitope was previously identified as Cad blood group antigen. The decrease of this glycolipid and the increase of GM2 was considered to be a cancer-associated change in gastric mucosa.
