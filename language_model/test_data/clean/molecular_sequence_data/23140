HER-2 codon 655 polymorphism together with human papillomavirus (HPV) types were examined in a total of 279 cervical smear samples. Forty-nine patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion had higher frequency of high-risk HPV than 167 patients with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and 63 controls. There was no statistical difference in the frequencies of HER-2 Ile/Ile, Ile/Val, and Val/Val genotypes between squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) and controls. When the Ile/Ile genotype was compared to the Ile/Val + Val/Val genotypes, there was also no statistical difference in the genotype prevalence between SILs and controls either in 91 or 188 patients with or without high-risk HPV, respectively. These results suggest that the HER-2 polymorphism at codon 655 in cervical cell samples is unlikely to be associated with HPV status and the onset of cervical cancer in a Japanese population.
