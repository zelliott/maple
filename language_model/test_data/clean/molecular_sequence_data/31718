A novel Gram-negative, aerobic, non-motile and rod-shaped bacterium was isolated from Qurugöl Lake near Tabriz city. The bacterium grew chemoorganolheterotrophically and chemolithoautotrophically. However, photo-organoheterotrophic, photo-lithoautotrophic and fermentative growth could not be demonstrated. The presence of photosynthesis genes pufL and pufM was not shown and photosynthesis pigments were not formed. Strain RCRI19(T) grew without NaCl and tolerated up to 3 % NaCl. Growth occurred at pH 6-9 (optimum, pH 7) and 15-55 °C (optimum 40-45 °C). Vitamins were not required for growth. The major fatty acids are C18:1 ω7C, 11-methyl C18:1 ω7C, C18:0 3-OH. The predominant respiratory quinone is ubiquinone Q-10. The G+C content of genomic DNA is 65.9 mol%. Analysis of 16S rRNA sequences showed that strain RCRI19(T) has the highest similarities with uncultured environmental sequences followed by members of the genera Rhodobacter (≤95.75 %), Haematobacter (≤95.53 %), Gemmobacter (≤95.17 %) and Falsirhodobacter (94.60 %) in the family Rhodobacteraceae. DNA-DNA relatedness between strain RCRI19(T) and the closest phylogenetically related strain, Rhodobacter blasticus LMG 4305(T), was 20 %. Based on its phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics and considering that it does not form photosynthetic pigments and is unable to grow phototrophically, it is concluded that strain RCRI19(T) cannot be included into the genus Rhodobacter and any of the other related genera. Therefore, we propose to place the new bacterium into a new genus and species for which the name Tabrizicola aquatica gen. nov. and sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is RCRI19(T) (=BCCM/LMG 25773(T )= JCM 17277(T )= KCTC 23724(T)).
