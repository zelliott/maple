Polyglutamylation is an original posttranslational modification, discovered on tubulin, consisting in side chains composed of several glutamyl units and leading to a very unusual protein structure. A monoclonal antibody directed against glutamylated tubulin (GT335) was found to react with other proteins present in HeLa cells. After immunopurification on a GT335 affinity column, two prominent proteins of approximately 50 kDa were observed. They were identified by microsequencing and mass spectrometry as NAP-1 and NAP-2, two members of the nucleosome assembly protein family that are implicated in the deposition of core histone complexes onto chromatin. Strikingly, NAP-1 and NAP-2 were found to be substrates of an ATP-dependent glutamylation enzyme co-purifying on the same column. We took advantage of this property to specifically label and purify the polyglutamylated peptides. NAP-1 and NAP-2 are modified in their C-terminal domain by the addition of up to 9 and 10 glutamyl units, respectively. Two putative glutamylation sites were localized for NAP-1 at Glu-356 and Glu-357 and, for NAP-2, at Glu-347 and Glu-348. These results demonstrate for the first time that proteins other than tubulin are polyglutamylated and open new perspectives for studying NAP function.
