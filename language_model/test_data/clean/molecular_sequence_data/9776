In the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni a functionally active, monomeric, phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx) has been purified and characterized. This enzyme contains a catalytically active selenocysteine. The protein has been shown to be the product of a cloned gene, previously referred to as a glutathione peroxidase gene. S. mansoni PHGPx has been found 5 times more abundant in female than in male worm extract. As in vertebrate PHGPx, homology alignment indicates that the residues involved in the glutathione binding by the tetrametric cellular glutathione peroxidase are mutated in the S. mansoni enzyme. Thus, this aspect appears a landmark of the PHGPx-type of glutathione peroxidases, which might be of functional relevance.
