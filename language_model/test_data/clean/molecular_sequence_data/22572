The genomic RNA of the severe stem pitting Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) isolate T318A from Spain (19252 nt) was completely sequenced. It showed strong sequence similarities with the severe isolates SY568 from California and NUagA from Japan, and distant relationships with mild non-stem pitting isolates T385 from Spain and T30 from Florida. Contrasting with other severe CTV isolates, T318A had a predominant sequence variant even in the highly variable 5'-terminal untranslated region, in which a unique sequence variant (type II) previously associated with severe stem pitting isolates was detected. The high homogeneity of the T318A population suggests that the sequence obtained is probably responsible for the symptoms induced and makes it a useful tool to delimit pathogenicity determinants.
