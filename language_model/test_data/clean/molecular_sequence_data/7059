The intracerebroventricular administration of interleukin-1 beta (12.5 ng/kg) in rabbits caused a prompt rise of prostaglandin E2 concentration (+ 632.6 +/- 243.9%) in the cerebrospinal fluid followed by hyperthermia (+ 1.61 +/- 0.14 delta degrees C). The intracerebroventricular administration of an anti-inflammatory nonapeptide (amino acids 204-212, SHLRKVFDK) derived from lipocortin 5, thereafter referred to as lipocortin 5-(204-212)-peptide, inhibited in a significant manner both the increase in cerebrospinal fluid [prostaglandin E2] and the febrile response induced by the cytokine. This inhibitory effect is probably due to interference by the peptide with phospholipase A2 activity. A control peptide (FKRVHDLKS) formed by the same amino acids in a randomly shuffled sequence had no effect. These results show that, in addition to the anti-inflammatory effect previously reported, the peptide 204-212 of lipocortin 5 possesses, like glucocorticoids, anti-pyretic activity. The research on lipocortin-derived peptides may lead to the development of novel anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic compounds.
