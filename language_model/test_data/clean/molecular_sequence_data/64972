To evaluate the variation of Potato yellow vein virus from potato fields, 12 isolates were collected from Colombia and one was collected from Peru. Double-stranded RNA was extracted from the plants and used as a template for RT-PCR amplification of the coat protein ( CP) gene and, in separate reactions the C-terminal region of the heat shock protein 70 homologue ( Hsp70h) gene and the N-terminal region of the p60 open reading frame. The CP amplicons were subjected to single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and, together with the other amplicon, nucleotide sequence analysis. These analyses suggested that there is low genetic diversity in the PYVV isolates examined and that the Peruvian isolate of PYVV may have originated in Colombia.
