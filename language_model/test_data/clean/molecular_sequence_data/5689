Dictyostelium discoideum utilizes G-protein-regulated transmembrane signaling systems to implement its developmental program. This report describes the Dictyostelium G-protein alpha-subunit, G alpha3, and demonstrates that it is required for normal development. G alpha3 is the largest of the four completely sequenced Dictyostelium G-protein alpha-subunits. The difference in size is due to variability in the N-terminal regions. The regions which are affected by the increased size of G alpha3 are the Gbeta gamma binding region and the helical domain that protects the guanine nucleotide cleft. g alpha3- mutants created by gene disruption fail to aggregate. However, when treated with exogenous pulses of cAMP that mimic the endogenous cAMP oscillations, they are able to aggregate, but development arrests at the tipped mound stage. This conditional developmental phenotype suggests that G alpha3 is required for production of the cAMP signal.
