To test a previously coined "charge balance hypothesis" of human hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsid stability, we established an in vitro disassembly and reassembly system using bacterially expressed HBV capsids. Capsid disassembly can be induced by micrococcal nuclease digestion of encapsidated RNA. HBV core protein (HBc) mutants containing various amounts of arginine were constructed by serial truncations at the C terminus. Capsids containing smaller amounts of arginine (HBc 149, 154, and 157) remained intact after micrococcal nuclease digestion by native gel electrophoresis. Capsids containing larger amounts of arginine (HBc 159, 164, 169, and 171) exhibited reduced and more diffuse banding intensity and slightly upshifted mobility (HBc 159 and 164). Capsids containing the largest amounts of arginine (HBc 173, 175, and 183), as well as HBc 167, exhibited no detectable banding signal, indicating loss of capsid integrity or stability. Interestingly, capsid reassembly can be induced by polyanions, including oligonucleotides, poly-glutamic acid, and nonbiological polymer (polyacrylic acid). In contrast, polycations (polylysine and polyethylenimine) and low-molecular-weight anions (inositol triphosphate) induced no capsid reassembly. Results obtained by gel assay were confirmed by electron microscopy. Reassembled capsids comigrated with undigested parental capsids on agarose gels and cosedimented with undigested capsids by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Taken together, the results indicate that HBV capsid assembly and integrity depend on polyanions, which probably can help minimize intersubunit charge repulsion caused mainly by arginine-rich domain III or IV in close contact. The exact structure of polyanions is not important for in vitro capsid reassembly. A large amount of independent experimental evidence for this newly coined "electrostatic interaction hypothesis" is discussed.
