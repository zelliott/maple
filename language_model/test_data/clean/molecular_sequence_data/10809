The 10A1 murine leukemia virus (MuLV) is a recombinant type C retrovirus isolated from a mouse infected with amphotropic MuLV (A-MuLV). 10A1 and A-MuLV have 91% amino acid identity in their envelope proteins yet display different host ranges. For example, CHO-K1 cells are resistant to A-MuLV but susceptible to infection by 10A1. We have now determined that retroviral vectors bearing altered A-MuLV envelope proteins containing 10A1-derived residues at positions 71 (A71G), 74 (Q74K), and 139 (V139M) transduce CHO-K1 cells at efficiencies similar to those achieved with 10A1 enveloped vectors. A-MuLV enveloped retroviral vectors with these three 10A1 residues were also able to transduce A-MuLV-infected NIH 3T3 cells. This observation is consistent with the ability of vectors bearing this altered A-MuLV envelope protein to recognize the 10A1-specific receptor present on NIH 3T3 cells and supports the possibility that residues at positions 71, 74, and 139 of the 10A1 envelope SU protein account for the expanded host range of 10A1.
