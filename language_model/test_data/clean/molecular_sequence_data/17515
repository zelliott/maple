Reactivity of a murine monoclonal anti-Sm B antibody was localized to a cDNA clone T3/2 encompassing codons 177-221 of Sm N and to a series of 10-residue synthetic peptides containing a proline-rich motif. Human sera containing anti-B antibodies also bound to this proline-rich motif in the form of a heptamer, PPGMRPP, and could distinguish the N/B sequence from similar sequences present in the RNP A and C polypeptides in a number of cases. Monoclonal antibodies binding to either this peptide or to a determinant present on both B and D polypeptides inhibited the majority of anti-B binding in 50% of anti-B sera. The region of N/B containing PPGMRPP also bears a second epitope, sterically blocked by monoclonal antibody KSm 5. This hotspot binds 40-60% of anti-B activity in 30% of anti-B sera. These data suggest that the anti-Sm B epitope recognition repertoire is restricted in SLE patients.
