Amino-acid sequencing of the purified major nucleoprotein (NP), VP35 and VP40 from purified Ebola virus proved that they are the protein products of the first three genes, and that the open reading frame (ORF) of the NP begins at nucleotide 470. Because of the many unusual features of the ORFs of Ebola virus, we thought that our conclusions should be substantiated. Comparisons of in vitro-translation products to purified viral proteins were used to demonstrate conclusively that the NP, VP35 and VP40 were the protein products of genes one, two, and three, respectively. Studies using antibodies to synthetic peptides matching the N- and C-termini of the deduced sequences from these genes confirmed these conclusions and that the ORF for the NP begins at nucleotide 470. Subsequent studies confirmed that VP30 is encoded by the fifth gene.
