In this study, we investigated the activating role of Mcm1p at ARG1 during arginine starvation. Our results showed that two Mcm1p binding sites positively contribute to ARG1 transcription and cell growth. Especially, we provide strong evidence that the Mcm1p binding sites play a positive role in ARG1 transcription to overcome arginine starvation in the absence of Gcn4p. In addition, we found that the Mcm1p binding sites are not only regulated by the presence or absence of arginine but also in the presence or absence of other amino acids. These findings suggest that the ARG1 promoter utilizes different DNA elements to control transcription, depending on which amino acids are detected in the medium.
