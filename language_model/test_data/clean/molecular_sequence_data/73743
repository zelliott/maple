Diaminopimelate (DAP) is used by bacteria for the synthesis of lysine. In many species of bacteria, including mycobacteria, DAP is also used for peptidoglycan biosynthesis. In this report we describe the cloning of the dapB gene encoding dihydrodipicolinate reductase (DHPR), which catalyzes a key branch point reaction in the bacterial DAP biosynthetic pathway, from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Analyses of the DapB proteins from different bacterial species suggest that two different classes of DHPR enzymes may exist in bacteria.
