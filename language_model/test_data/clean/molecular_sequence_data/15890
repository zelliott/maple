The murine c-fes protein is encoded by an mRNA of 2.8 kb which is expressed predominantly in haemopoietic cell lines of the myeloid lineage. We have isolated over-lapping cDNA clones encompassing the entire coding region of murine c-fes. The predicted translation product of the c-fes mRNA is an 820 amino acid protein with 89% overall similarity to feline and human c-fes sequences, and 66% similarity to the chicken c-fps sequence. The murine c-fes proto-oncogene is related to other members of the protein tyrosine kinase family of oncogenes, although it is structurally distinct from both the receptor type, and the src family of tyrosine kinases. A comparison of the predicted protein sequence of murine, feline, human and chicken c-fps/fes proteins highlights several domains of possible functional significance in the molecule.
