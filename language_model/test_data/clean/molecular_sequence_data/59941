For the EP3 subtype of prostaglandin E receptors, different C-terminal splice variants are known, which are coupled to distinct heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins). To test the hypothesis that the C-terminal domain is essential for the G-protein-coupling specificity of the EP3 receptor, we exchanged the carboxyl-terminal tail of a porcine Gi-coupled EP3 receptor isoform for the corresponding C-terminal part of a Gs-coupled prostaglandin receptor. The porcine EP3 receptor was truncated at a lysine (K350) residue at the end of the seventh transmembrane region, representing the splicing site of the different EP3 receptor isoforms. The wild-type C-terminus (37 amino acids) was substituted by the C-terminal tail (89 amino acids) of the human I-type prostaglandin receptor (hIP-R). The G-protein coupling of the resulting chimeric receptor protein was studied in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Stimulation of the chimeric receptor protein with the EP3 receptor-specific agonist M&B 28.767 did not increase adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) formation but did reduce the forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation, indicating Gi coupling. Furthermore, the chimeric receptor did not show constitutive activity as demonstrated for the C-terminally truncated EP3 receptor. Thus, coupling specificity of the EP3 receptor is not exclusively mediated by the carboxyl-terminal tail, and constitutive activity of a C-terminally truncated EP3 receptor can be suppressed by the hIP-R C-terminus.
