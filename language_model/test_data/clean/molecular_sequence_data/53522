Phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium isolated from the uterus of a porpoise. Biochemical and physiological studies indicated that the bacterium was related to the family Pasteurellaceae. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies confirmed these findings and demonstrated that the bacterium represents a hitherto unknown subline within this family of organisms. Based on the results of the phylogenetic analysis and phenotypic criteria, it is proposed that the bacterium be assigned to a new genus, Phocoenobacter uteri gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Phocoenobacter uteri sp. nov. is NCTC 12872T.
