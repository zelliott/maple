Polymerase chain reaction amplification of DNA from 112 Pseudomonas solanacearum strains with the tRNA consensus primers T3A and T5A divided the species into three fingerprint groups. These groups correspond well with previous divisions made by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. This polymerase chain reaction test is a facile method for rapidly classifying P. solanacearum strains.
