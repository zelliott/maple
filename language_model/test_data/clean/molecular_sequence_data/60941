The gene encoding rat cystatin S (Cys S), a salivary gland-specific secretory protein, has CAAT and TATA boxes upstream of the inititation codon (Cox and Shaw, 1992), and contains regions that resemble those of other hormonally responsive eukaryotic genes. The 5'-flanking sequence of the rat Cys S gene has a potential CREB/AP-1 binding site (Rupp et al., 1990; Trejo et al., 1992), two potential glucocorticoid responsive elements (GREs, Drouin et al., 1989), and a possible GR/PR (glucocorticoid/progesterone) responsive element (Forman and Samuels, 1990). One of these potential GREs is adjacent to a potential AP-2 binding site, and another is typical of the glucocorticoid and progesterone receptor binding site. In this report, we have identified three regions in the 5'-flanking region of the Cys S gene that are found in salivary gland-specific genes (Ting et al., 1992) with a GT-rich region located between conserved elements II and III. Transfection experiments described in this paper suggest that a 281-bp DNA fragment from the Cys S gene promoter region with conserved elements II and III, the GT-rich region, and a possible GR/PR responsive element contains a negative regulatory element. In addition, our experiments suggest that the GT-rich region by itself is acting as a positive regulatory element.
