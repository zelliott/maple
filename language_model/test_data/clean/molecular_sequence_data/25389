A cDNA clone for mink growth hormone (GH) was isolated from a mink pituitary cDNA library, employing a part of rat growth hormone cDNA sequence as a probe. According to the nucleotide sequence, mature mink GH consists of 190 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 21,720. The amino acid sequence homology between the mature region of mink GH and those of pig GH, rat GH, bovine GH and human GH was 98.4%, 93.7%, 89.0% and 66.7%, respectively.
