Echistatin is a 49-amino-acid protein from Echis carinatus venom. It contains four disulfide bonds. Since the disulfide bonding is critical for biological activity; it is very important to assign the disulfide linkage in this protein. Echistatin was incubated in 250 mM oxalic acid at 100 degrees C for 4 hr under nitrogen. Under these conditions, many overlapping disulfide-containing peptides were identified by ionspray mass spectrometry. Ionspray MS/MS data indicate that the four disulfide bonds are Cys 2-Cys 11, Cys 7-Cys 32, Cys 8-Cys 37, and Cys 20-Cys 39. To our knowledge, this is the first time all four disulfide bonds in echistatin have been assigned in one experiment without disulfide bond exchange. This approach, which combines oxalic acid hydrolysis and ionspray MS/MS, may be very useful for assigning disulfide bridges in other proteins from the disintegrin family.
