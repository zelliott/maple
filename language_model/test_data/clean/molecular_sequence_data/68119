Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a potent mediator in many human tissues, that is recognized by three distinct subtypes of receptors, designated EP1, EP2 and EP3. A cDNA from a human lung library encodes a 53 kDa protein of 88% homology with the mouse EP2 receptor. Human EP2 receptors in COS-7 cell transfectants bound [3H]-PGE2 with a mean Kd of 2.2 nM and native specificity, and transduced increases in the intra-cellular concentration of cyclic AMP, but not of Ca++. That most EP2 receptor mRNA is in lung, kidney, intestinal, glandular and immune tissues, is consistent with functional responses.
