The ntrBC genes coding for the bacterial signal-transducing protein NtrB and the bacterial enhancer-binding protein NtrC of deep-sea piezophilic Shewanella violacea were cloned and their nucleotide sequences were analyzed. The conserved regions of NtrB and those of NtrC are well conserved in the case of the ntrBC products of S. violacea.
