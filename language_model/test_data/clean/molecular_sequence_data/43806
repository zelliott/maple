The genomic clones of Sat gene encoding serine acetyltransferase (SATase), a key enzyme in cysteine biosynthesis in plants, were isolated from the genomic library of Citrullus vulgaris (watermelon). The determination of nucleotide sequence of 5.7 kilobase pair (kbp) length revealed the presence of two introns of 1939 basepair (bp) and 515 bp length in the gene. The transcription start point was determined by primer extension experiments. Southern blot analysis indicated the presence of a single copy of the Sat gene and a couple of additional related sequences in the genome of C. vulgaris. The expression of Sat was analyzed in watermelon plants growth under sulfur- and/or nitrogen-starved conditions and in the presence of pyrazole, O-acetylserine and N-acetylserine. Only slight increment (ca. 1.5-2-fold) of Sat gene expression was observed upon sulfur starvation for 48 h. Interestingly, the addition of pyrazole, which is a precursor of beta-pyrazolealanine (beta-PA) synthesized by SATase and cysteine/beta-PA synthase, enhanced the expression of Sat by ca. 2-fold.
