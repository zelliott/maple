A gasoline-degrading consortium, originating from a Mexican soil, was used to study its hexane-degradation kinetics in liquid culture and in a biofilter with mineral support. The biodiversity of the consortium depending on the culture conditions and electron and energy source (gasoline, hexane in liquid or hexane in the biofilter) was analyzed using a 16S rRNA-based approach. Significant differences between the populations were observed, indicating a probable adaptation to the substrate. Two strains, named SP2B and SP72-3, isolated from the consortium, belonged to Actinomycetes and demonstrated a high metabolic potential in hexane degradation. Even though the SP2B strain was related to Rhodococcus ruber DSM 43338(T) by phylogenetic studies, it displayed enlarged metabolic properties in hexane and other short-alkane degradation compared with the collection strain.
