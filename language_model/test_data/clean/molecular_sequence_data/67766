A litter of pups: The synthesis and in vitro evaluation of new Pup-based fluorogenic substrates for Dop, the mycobacterial depupylase, are described. A full-length Pup-amidomethylcoumarin conjugate as well as an amino-terminus-truncated analogue exhibited high sensitivity and specificity towards hydrolysis by Dop. The substrates developed here might find application as high-throughput screening assay reagents for the identification of Dop inhibitors.
