Saccharomyces Sac3 required for actin assembly was shown to be involved in DNA replication. Here, we studied the function of a mammalian homologue SHD1 in cell cycle progression. SHD1 is localized on centrosomes at interphase and at spindle poles and mitotic spindles, similar to alpha-tubulin, at M phase. RNA interference suppression of endogenous shd1 caused defects in centrosome duplication and spindle formation displaying cells with a single apparent centrosome and down-regulated Mad2 expression, generating increased micronuclei. Conversely, increased expression of SHD1 by DNA transfection with shd1-green fluorescent protein (gfp) vector for a fusion protein of SHD1 and GFP caused abnormalities in centrosome duplication displaying cells with multiple centrosomes and deregulated spindle assembly with up-regulated Mad2 expression until anaphase, generating polyploidy cells. These results demonstrated that shd1 is involved in cell cycle progression, in particular centrosome duplication and a spindle assembly checkpoint function.
