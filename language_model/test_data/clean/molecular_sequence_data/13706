A simple method is described for the application onto HPLC columns of very crude or alternatively poorly soluble polypeptide samples prior to their chromatographic purification. The procedure involves the batch pre-adsorption of the crude polypeptide mixture from a dilute solution onto an appropriate preparative-grade chromatographic adsorbent, removal of the solvent by rotary evaporation or lyophilisation and then dry-packing the pre-adsorbed chromatographic material into guard column cartridges of suitable dimensions. The polypeptide products can then be eluted either by isocratic or gradient elution methods through the cartridge coupled in tandem with prepacked semi-preparative HPLC columns. This method has been successfully utilised for the routine RP-HPLC purification of polar and hydrophobic polypeptides prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) methods as well as peptide derivatives and intermediates used as part of SPPS procedures.
