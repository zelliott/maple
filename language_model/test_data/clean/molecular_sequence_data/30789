The expression of the gene encoding the neuroendocrine peptides neurotensin (NT) and neuromedin N is strictly dependent on simultaneous exposure to multiple inducers in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. NT peptide and NT/N mRNA levels are synergistically induced by combinations of NGF, dexamethasone, activators of adenylate cyclase, and lithium ion. We have used transient transfection assays to delineate the rat NT/N gene sequences necessary for this complex regulation. Progressive deletions of the 5' flanking region revealed that sequences between -216 and +56 are sufficient to confer the full spectrum of responses exhibited by the endogenous gene to a reporter gene. Detailed mutational analysis of this region indicates that it is composed of an array of inducible cis-regulatory sequences, including AP-1, cAMP response, and glucocorticoid response elements. Specific mutation of either the AP-1 site or each of two cAMP response elements indicates that they are functionally interdependent. This array of response elements serves to integrate multiple environmental stimuli into a unified transcriptional response.
