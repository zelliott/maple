Tea production in North-East India hit a record loss due to the widespread severe outbreak of a mixed brood of three species of looper caterpillar pests of geometrid moths (Lepidoptera) in 2008-2010. In addition to Buzura suppressaria, two newly recorded geometrids, viz., Hyposidra infixaria and Hyposidra talaca have caused widespread severe damage in recent years. In the present study we report the nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPV) isolated from the tea looper caterpillar from North-East India. We identified and characterized the NPV by cloning and sequencing a partial segment of polyhedrin gene of virus infected larvae of B. suppressaria, H. talaca and H. infixaria. A comparison of deduced amino acids of polyhedrin gene among H. talaca, H. infixaria and B. suppressaria showed that same strain was found to infect all the three loopers in India, which show high sequence identity with B. suppressaria Chinese isolates. Based on the polyhedrin sequence homology, it is predicted that a variant of B. suppressaria Chinese isolate of NPV found to infect H. talaca, H. infixaria and B. suppressaria in India.
