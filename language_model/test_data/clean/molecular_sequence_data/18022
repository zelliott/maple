Two genes from Arabidopsis thaliana related to the auxin-inducible Aux28 and Aux22 genes of soybean have been isolated. These genes belong to a small multi-gene family and are similar to the soybean Aux gene family in the sequence of the predicted proteins, intron/exon locations, and auxin-enhanced expression of their transcripts. Application of auxin to 8-day old Arabidopsis plants, 4-day old etiolated seedlings, and suspension culture cells all resulted in enhanced Aux transcript levels. Comparison of the promoter sequences from the soybean and Arabidopsis genes yielded no significant sequence conservation; however, three regions of near sequence identity are present between the two Arabidopsis Aux genes.
