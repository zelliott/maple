A synthetic bovine trypsinogen (sbTrypsinogen) was synthesized on the basis of rice-optimized codon usage via an overlap PCR strategy, prior to being expressed under the control of the sucrose starvation-inducible rice Î±-amylase 3D (RAmy3D) promoter. Secretion of trypsin into the culture medium was achieved by using the existing signal peptide. The plant expression vector was introduced into rice calli (Oryza sativa L. cv. Dongjin), mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The integration of the sbTrypsinogen gene into the chromosome of the transgenic rice callus was verified via genomic DNA PCR amplification, and sbTrypsin expression in transgenic rice suspension cells was confirmed via Northern blot analysis. Western blot analysis detected glycosylated proteins in the culture medium, having masses from 24 to 26 kDa, following induction by sugar starvation. Proteolytic activity of the rice-derived trypsin was confirmed by gelatin zymogram, and was similar to that of the commercial bovine-produced trypsin. The yields of sbTrypsin that accumulated in the transgenic rice cell suspension medium were 15 mg/L at 5 days after sugar starvation.
