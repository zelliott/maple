A new xylanase gene, xynBM4, was cloned from Streptomyces megasporus DSM 41476 and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The full-length gene consists of 1,443 bp and encodes 480 amino acids including a putative 49-residue signal peptide. The deduced amino acid sequence of xynBM4 shows the highest identity of 66.3% to the xylanase Xys1L from Streptomyces halstedii JM8. The purified recombinant XYNBM4 had a high specific activity of 350.7 U mg(-1) towards soluble wheat arabinoxylan, exhibited optimal activity at pH 6.0 and 57°C, showed broad pH adaptability (>75% of the maximum activity at pH 2.5-9.0), was resistant to neutral proteases and most chemicals, and produced simple products. The hydrolysis products of birchwood xylan and corncob xylan were predominantly xylobiose (76.9 and 90.8%, respectively) and no xylose. These characteristics suggest that XYNBM4 has potential in various applications, especially in the food industry.
