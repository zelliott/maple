We have investigated the effect on phospholipidic bilayers of LEW-10, a synthetic flavonoid, derivative of diosmin. Two optical techniques, Quasi-elastic Light Scattering (QLS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) were used. The results show that in the presence of LEW-10, the phase transition of the bilayers is lowered and that the elastic modulus is decreased. The FT-IR results indicate interactions in the aqueous interface regions of the bilayers. We also discuss LEW-10 comparatively with another derivative, LEW-7/S1, whose effect has been previously studied.
