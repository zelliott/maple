A cDNA encoding sugar beet alpha-glucosidase was cloned from a library constructed from mRNA of suspension-cultured cells. The cDNA, 3056 bp in length, had an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 913 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 102,078 Da, included only one of four regions which were conserved in the alpha-amylase family of enzymes. The deduced amino acid sequence from the analysis of the cDNA contained the sequences of the proteolysis peptides and the active site region peptide of sugar beet alpha-glucosidase. The primary structure indicated relatively high homology in the range of 28.2 to 54.3% to those for other alpha-glucosidases. The highest homology was found in barley alpha-glucosidase.
