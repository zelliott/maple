Glycopeptides are important clinical emergency antibiotics consisting of a glycosylated and chlorinated heptapeptide backbone. The understanding of the biosynthesis is crucial for development of new glycopeptides. With balhimycin as a model system, this work focuses on the investigation of the putative halogenase gene (bhaA) and the putative haloperoxidase/perhydrolase gene (bhp) of the balhimycin biosynthesis gene cluster. An in-frame deletion mutant in the haloperoxidase/perhydrolase gene bhp (OP696) did not produce balhimycin. Feeding experiments revealed that bhp is involved in the biosynthesis of beta-hydroxytyrosine, a precursor of balhimycin. A bhaA in-frame deletion mutant (PH4) accumulated glycosylated but nonchlorinated balhimycin variants. The mutants indicated that only the halogenase BhaA is required for chlorination of balhimycin. Nonglycosylated and/or nonhalogenated metabolites can serve as starting points for combinatorial approaches for novel glycopeptides.
