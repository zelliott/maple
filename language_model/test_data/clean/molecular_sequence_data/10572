N-formyl peptides, such as fMet-Leu-Phe, are one of the most potent chemoattractants for phagocytic leukocytes. The interaction of N-formyl peptides with their specific cell surface receptors has been studied extensively and used as a model system for the characterization of G-protein-coupled signal transduction in phagocytes. The cloning of the N-formyl peptide receptor cDNA from several species and the identification of homologous genes have allowed detailed studies of structural and functional aspects of the receptor. Recent findings that the receptor is expressed in nonhematopoietic cells and that nonformylated peptides can activate the receptor suggest potentially novel functions and the existence of additional ligands for this receptor.
