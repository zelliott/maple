DNA sequence analysis of genes encoding 5S rRNA in the human parasitic nematode Brugia malayi (B. malayi) indicates a surprising degree of heterogeneity. This variation in coding sequence is not accompanied by corresponding heterogeneity in flanking regions which are highly conserved. Six out of eight potential 5S coding regions differed; of these sequence variants, two were abundant in the B. malayi genome. Direct RNA sequence analysis indicated that one of these abundant variants accounts for most if not all of expressed 5S RNA at two stages of development.
