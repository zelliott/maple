Despite the importance of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) for homing migration, the expression of olfactory marker protein (OMP) is not well understood in ORNs of Pacific salmon (genus Oncorhynchus). In this study, salmon OMP was characterized in the olfactory epithelia of lacustrine sockeye salmon (O. nerka) by molecular biological and histochemical techniques. Two cDNAs encoding salmon OMP were isolated and sequenced. These cDNAs both contained a coding region encoding 173 amino acid residues, and the molecular mass of the two proteins was calculated to be 19,581.17 and 19,387.11Da, respectively. Both amino acid sequences showed marked homology (90%). The protein and nucleotide sequencing demonstrates the existence of high-level homology between salmon OMPs and those of other teleosts. By in situ hybridization using a digoxigenin-labeled salmon OMP cRNA probe, signals for salmon OMP mRNA were observed preferentially in the perinuclear regions of the ORNs. By immunohistochemistry using a specific antibody to salmon OMP, OMP-immunoreactivities were noted in the cytosol of those neurons. The present study is the first to describe cDNA cloning of OMP in salmon olfactory epithelium, and indicate that OMP is a useful molecular marker for the detection of the ORNs in Pacific salmon.
