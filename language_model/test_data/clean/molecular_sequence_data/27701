Synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences 46-62 and 51-62 of mouse lysozyme and 46-61 of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) were used as competitors in a variety of T cell responses. The competitors, according to their binding specificity for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) were expected to inhibit T cell responses restricted to I-Ak, but not those restricted to I-Ad, I-Ek molecules. In competition experiments with T cell hybridomas, the poor binder I-Ed molecule required 10- to 15-fold higher competitor concentrations than the good binder I-Ak molecule to achieve 50% inhibition of antigen presentation. Similarly, the nonresponder state of H-2d mice to HEL peptide 46-61 could be overcome by increasing the immunizing dose, and proliferative T cell responses to different antigens in association with a variety of class II MHC molecules could be blocked by the mouse lysozyme and HEL peptides. Thus, the capability of some and failure of other MHC molecules to bind certain peptides appeared quantitative, rather than of an all or none nature, in these experimental systems. The susceptibility of uncloned T cell lines to peptide competitors was found to decrease with time. Lines maintained by repeated restimulation with antigen and APC, but without exogenous interleukin 2, acquired resistance within weeks. In contrast, T cell clones retained their susceptibility to peptide competitors over a long period of time. The latter data raise the possibility that a competition between ubiquitous (self) peptides and foreign antigen may result in the selection of T cells that have high avidity for the activating antigen-MHC complex, and are thus relatively resistant to competition at the level of antigen presentation.
