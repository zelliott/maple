Measles virus (MV) inserts one guanosine (G) residue at a specific site in a subpopulation of the mRNA transcribed from the phosphoprotein (P) gene to produce V mRNA. Using an antiserum against the unique carboxyl-terminal region of the predicted V protein, we found that a phosphorylated V protein was expressed in two acute MV strains (Edmonston and Nagahata) and three SSPE virus strains (Biken, Yamagata, and Niigata). The V protein of Biken strain SSPE virus was electrophoretically and antigenically indistinguishable from the V protein of Nagahata strain acute MV, the likely progenitor of the Biken strain. The V protein of these two viruses was not present in the intracellular viral nucleocapsids, but was found only in the cytosolic free protein pool. Pulse-chase experiments failed to show transport of the V protein to the plasma membrane. The V protein was also absent in the extracellular virions. The P protein synthesized from the cloned gene associated with the MV nucleocapsids in vitro, but the V protein had no affinity to the MV nucleocapsids. These results suggest that expression and properties of the V protein are conserved in chronic MV infection.
