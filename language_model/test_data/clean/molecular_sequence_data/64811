The coordination of chromatin remodeling with chromatin modification is a central topic in gene regulation. The yeast chromatin remodeling complex RSC bears multiple bromodomains, motifs for acetyl-lysine and histone tail interaction. Here, we identify and characterize Rsc4 and show that it bears tandem essential bromodomains. Conditional rsc4 bromodomain mutations were isolated, and were lethal in combination with gcn5Delta, whereas combinations with esa1 grew well. Replacements involving Lys14 of histone H3 (the main target of Gcn5), but not other H3 or H4 lysine residues, also conferred severe growth defects to rsc4 mutant strains. Importantly, wild-type Rsc4 bound an H3 tail peptide acetylated at Lys14, whereas a bromodomain mutant derivative did not. Loss of particular histone deacetylases suppressed rsc4 bromodomain mutations, suggesting that Rsc4 promotes gene activation. Furthermore, rsc4 mutants displayed defects in the activation of genes involved in nicotinic acid biosynthesis, cell wall integrity, and other pathways. Taken together, Rsc4 bears essential tandem bromodomains that rely on H3 Lys14 acetylation to assist RSC complex for gene activation.
