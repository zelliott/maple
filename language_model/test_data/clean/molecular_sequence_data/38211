IkappaBbeta is a member of the IkappaB family of structurally related proteins that are important regulators of the inducible transcription factor NF-kappaB. In the present study, the mouse IkappaBbeta gene was cloned and sequenced, and its structure determined. The mouse IkappaBbeta gene contains six exons and five introns that span 7435 nucleotides. A single major transcription initiation site is located 59 nucleotides upstream of the initiating methionine. A translation termination codon and a single polyadenylation signal are found within exon 6. The exon/intron structure of IkappaBbeta and IkappaBalpha genes were compared and found to be very similar, with individual ankyrin repeats being maintained on corresponding exons. This suggests a close evolutionary relationship between these two IkappaB isoforms. The significance of this evolutionary relationship is discussed.
