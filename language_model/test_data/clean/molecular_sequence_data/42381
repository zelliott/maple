Genetic heterogeneity within the most common genetic neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) results in about 70% slow nerve conduction CMT1 and 30% normal nerve conduction CMT2. Autosomal dominant CMT1A on chromosome 17p11.2 represents about 70% of CMT1 cases and about 50% of all CMT cases. Three different size CMT1A duplications with variable flanking breakpoints were characterized by multicolor in situ hybridization and confirmed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. These different size duplications result in the same CMT1A phenotype confirming that trisomy of a normal gene region results in CMT1A. The smallest duplication does not include the 409 locus used previously to screen for CMT1A duplications. Direct analysis of interphase nuclei from fetuses and at-risk patients by multicolor in situ hybridization to a commonly duplicated CMT1A probe is informative more often than polymorphic PCR analysis, faster than pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and faster, more informative, and more reliable than restriction enzyme analysis. CMT1B restriction enzyme analysis of CMT pedigrees without CMT1A is expected to diagnose another 8% of at-risk CMT1 patients (total: 78%).
