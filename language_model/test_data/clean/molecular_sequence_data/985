Nipah virus (NiV), a new member of the Paramyxoviridae, codes for a fusion (F) protein with five potential N-glycosylation sites. Because glycans are known to be important structural components affecting the conformation and function of viral glycoproteins, we analyzed the effect of the deletion of N-linked oligosaccharides on cell surface transport, proteolytic cleavage, and the biological activity of the NiV F protein. Each of the five potential glycosylation sites was removed either individually or in combination, revealing that four sites are actually utilized (g2 and g3 in the F(2) subunit and g4 and g5 in the F(1) subunit). While the removal of g2 and/or g3 had no or little effect on cleavage, surface transport, and fusion activity, the elimination of g4 or g5 reduced the surface expression by more than 80%. Similar to a mutant lacking all N-glycans, g4 deletion mutants in which the potential glycosylation site was destroyed by introducing a glycine residue were neither cleaved nor transported to the cell surface and consequently were not able to mediate cell-to-cell fusion. This finding indicates that in the absence of g4, the amino acid sequence around position 414 is important for folding and transport.
