The C1 repressor of bacteriophage P1 acts via 14 or more distinct operators. This repressor represses its own synthesis as well as the synthesis of other gene products. Previously, mutation of an auxiliary regulatory gene, bof, has been shown to increase expression of some C1-regulated P1 genes (e.g., ref) but to decrease expression of others (e.g., ban). In this study the bof gene was isolated on the basis of its ability to depress stimulation of Escherichia coli chromosomal recombination by the P1 ref gene, if and only if a source of C1 was present. C1 alone, but not Bof alone, was partially effective. The bofDNA sequence encodes an 82-codon reading frame that begins with a TTG codon and includes the sites of the bof-1(Am) mutation and a bof::Tn5 null mutation. Expression of ref::lacZ and cl::lacZ fusion genes was partially repressed in trans by a P1 bof-1 prophage or by plasmid-encoded C1 alone, which was in agreement with effects on Ref-stimulated recombination and with previous indirect evidence for c1 autoregulation. Repression of both fusion genes by plasmid-encoded C1 plus Bof or by a P1 bof+ prophage was more complete. When the C1 source also included a 0.7-kilobase region upstream from C1 which encodes the coi gene, repression of both c1::lacZ and ref::lacZ by C1 alone or by C1 plus Bof was much less effective, as if Coi interfered with C1 repressor function.
