This prospective study examined the persistence and transition of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive subjects with and without oral hairy leukoplakia, a replicative EBV-associated epithelial disease. The intrahost molecular epidemiology of EBV infection was characterized in subjects treated with valacyclovir to suppress EBV replication. Tongue epithelial tissues of HIV-seropositive subjects were found to support not only EBV replication but also persistent, nonproductive EBV infection. EBV appeared to enter the tongue from the blood reservoir of infection and, possibly, from exogenous sources as well. EBV transition from the blood to the tongue appeared to occur even during valacyclovir-mediated suppression of EBV replication, suggesting EBV entry into tongue epithelial tissue as a cell-associated latent infection. In conclusion, these results describe the persistence and transition of EBV as a dynamic interaction between the blood and epithelial reservoirs of EBV infection and suggest a role for entry, persistence, and reactivation of oral epithelial EBV in the pathogenesis of oral hairy leukoplakia.
