The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) transmembrane glycoprotein has a 24-amino-acid cytoplasmic domain whose function in the viral life cycle is poorly understood. We introduced premature-stop mutations and 18 single-amino-acid substitutions into this domain and studied their effects on cell-to-cell transmission of the virus. The results show that the cytoplasmic domain is absolutely required for cell-to-cell transmission of HTLV-1, through amino acids which cluster in a Y-S-L-I tyrosine-based motif. The transmission defect in two motif mutants did not result from a defect in glycoprotein incorporation or fusion. It appears that the Y-S-L-I tyrosine-based motif of the HTLV-1 glycoprotein cytoplasmic domain has multiple functions, including involvement in virus transmission at a postfusion step.
