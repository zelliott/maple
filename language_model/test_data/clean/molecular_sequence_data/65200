RNA-coat protein interactions in turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) have been shown to involve low pK proton-donating groups. Two different types of interaction have been proposed. In the so-called type I interaction, protonated C-residues interact with acidic amino acids at low pH, thereby providing a rationale for the high C-content (38%) of the genomic RNA. The type II interaction involves charged histidines interacting with phosphates of the RNA backbone. Site-directed mutagenesis of the TYMV coat protein and subsequent in vivo analysis were performed to distinguish between these two types of RNA-protein interaction. The results reveal a prominent role for the histidines H68 and H180, since mutation to an alanine residue inhibits symptom development on secondary leaves, indicating that spreading of the virus in the plant is blocked. Viral RNA and coat protein synthesis are not altered, showing that these two histidines may play a role in the process of RNA encapsidation. Overexpression of the TYMV coat protein in Escherichia coli leads to the formation of bona fide capsids, showing that the two histidines are not critical in capsid assembly. Mutagenesis of the acidic amino acids D11, E135, and D143 to alanine apparently did not interfere with virus viability. The functional role of the histidines during the infection cycle is discussed in terms of the structure of the coat protein, both at the level of amino acid sequence conservation among the members of the Tymoviridae family and as the three-dimensional structure of the coat protein.
