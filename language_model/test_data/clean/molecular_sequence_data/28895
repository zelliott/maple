To identify the DAZL transcript and protein location in human spermatozoa.

In vitro experiment.

University-based reproductive genetics laboratory.

A fertile volunteer.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot, and immunostaining for DAZL.

Expression of DAZL in human spermatozoa.

The DAZL-specific primers yield a 128 bp product in ejaculate. A protein of approximately 33.5 kDa was detected by Western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence staining showed strong homogeneous staining in the midpiece of spermatozoa and weak staining in the principal piece. A speckled-type distribution was found in the head region.

The DAZL transcript and protein are present in human spermatozoa. The roles of DAZL protein in sperm motility and in the sperm-oocyte interaction await further investigation.
