A mutant human insulin receptor with a carboxyl-terminal deletion of 69 amino acids (proreceptor residues 1287-1355) is expressed as a stable protein in transiently transfected COS cells. We find that in intact cells this mutant is phosphorylated in an insulin-dependent manner on core tyrosines 1158, 1163 and 1163. As expected, the carboxyl-terminal beta-subunit phosphorylation sites (serines 1305/6, tyrosines 1328/34 and threonine 1348) are absent from this mutant. However, the two major insulin-stimulated serine phosphopeptides remain. In intact cells, insulin stimulates exogenous substrate phosphorylation by the truncated receptor only approximately 1.9-fold (cf. approximately 9-fold for the wild-type receptor in these cells), a consequence of a approximately 4.8-fold elevation in basal insulin-independent kinase activity.
