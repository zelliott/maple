A model for the structure of the cytokine interleukin-3 (IL-3) is presented based on the structural homology of the hematopoietic cytokines and utilizing the crystal structures of interleukin-5 and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In addition, models of the receptor complexes of GM-CSF and IL-3 are presented based on the structural homology of the hematopoietic receptors to growth hormone. Several key interactions between the ligands and their receptors are discovered, some in agreement with previous mutagenesis studies and others that have not yet been the subject of mutagenesis studies. The models provide insights into the binding of GM-CSF and IL-3 to their receptors.
