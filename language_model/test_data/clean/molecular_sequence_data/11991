The expression of growth hormone receptor (GHR) mRNA in an ovine choroid plexus cell line (SCP) was studied. RNA isolated from SCP cells was subjected to reverse transcription followed by PCR using a set of primers, designed on the basis of the ovine liver GHR sequence. A specific product with expected size of 1204 bp was obtained and the nucleotide sequence was found to be identical to that of ovine liver GHR. When the PCR product was used as a probe for Northern blot analysis, a transcript of 4.4 kb was detected in mRNA isolated from the SCP cells. This is the first report demonstrating the presence of mRNA for GHR in the choroid plexus.
