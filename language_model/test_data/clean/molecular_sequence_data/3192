The three members of the serpin family, corticosteroid binding globulin, alpha1-antitrypsin, and C1 inhibitor are secreted apically from Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, whereas two homologous family members, antithrombin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, are secreted in a nonpolarized fashion. cDNAs coding for chimeras composed of complementary portions of an apically targeted serpin and a nonsorted serpin were generated, expressed in MDCK cells, and the ratio between apical and basolateral secretion was analyzed. These experiments identified an amino-terminal sequence of corticosteroid binding globulin (residues 1-19) that is sufficient to direct a chimera with antithrombin mainly to the apical side. A deletion/mutagenesis analysis showed that no individual amino acid is absolutely required for the apical targeting ability of amino acids 1-30 of corticosteroid binding globulin. The corresponding amino-terminal sequences of alpha1-antitrypsin and C1 inhibitor were also sufficient to confer apical sorting. Based on our results we suggest that the apical targeting ability is encoded in the conformation of the protein.
