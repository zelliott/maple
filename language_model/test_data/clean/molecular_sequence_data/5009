The solution structure of the major form of the reduced soluble fragment of rat microsomal cytochrome b5 has been solved through 1H-NMR spectroscopy. The protein contains 98 amino acids. Proton assignment was available for residues 1-94, except 90 [Guiles, R. D., Basus, V. J., Kuntz, I. D. & Waskell, L. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 11,365-11,375] and has been confirmed. From 1722 NOEs, of which 1203 were found to be meaningful, a family of 40 energy-minimized structures has been obtained with average backbone rmsd (for residues 5-89) of 0.078 +/- 0.018 nm and average target function of 0.0045 nm2, no distance violations being larger than 0.029 nm. The structure has been compared with the X-ray structure of the oxidized rat mitochondrial isoenzyme and with that of the highly similar bovine microsomal isoenzyme in the oxidized form. The analysis of the elements of secondary structure is instructive in terms of their stability and of their occurrence in related structures, and of the capability of NMR and X-ray spectroscopy to observe them. Some detailed structural variations are noticed among the solved structures of the various isoenzymes and between solid and solution. The structural features in solution of the residues proposed to be involved in protein-protein recognition are found to be largely conserved with respect to the solid state.
