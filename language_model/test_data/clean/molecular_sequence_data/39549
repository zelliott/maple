A variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism based on a 30-bp unit have been reported in the promoter region of the human monoamine oxidase A gene (MAOA). Human VNTRs have been shown to affect transcriptional activity, and some reports suggest that VNTR polymorphisms are associated with psychoneurological disorders. VNTR polymorphism has also been reported in the ape MAOA promoter but the transcriptional activities of the alleles remain to be determined. In the present study, we sequenced the 1.3-kb promoter region of ape MAOA and compared the transcriptional activities of ape MAOA promoter sequences with those of humans. All apes examined were polymorphic in the region corresponding to the human VNTR and two, four, three, and two alleles were found in chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and gibbons, respectively. VNTR repeat structures in gorillas, orangutans, and gibbons were considerably different from those in humans and chimpanzees. In a human neuroblastoma cell line, most of the ape sequences that had a short repeat length (12bp or 18bp) exhibited higher promoter activity than a human 3-repeat sequence with a 30-bp repeat length. However, an intra-species difference dependent on the repeat number was not observed among the ape alleles examined.
