A 3.4 kilobase cDNA complementary to rat transferrin receptor mRNA has been isolated from an adult rat testis cDNA library. The rat transferrin receptor nucleotide sequence was shown to be 82% similar to the human transferrin receptor sequence over the amino acid coding region and over 90% similar in the sequences known to be responsible for iron regulation in the human mRNA. The mRNA was shown by Northern blot analysis to be regulated by iron levels in Sertoli cells in culture. Iron depletion resulted in at least a 5-fold increase in receptor message in Sertoli cells, as well as in an actively growing testicular cell line (S10-7). The level of transferrin receptor mRNA in cultured Sertoli cells was not influenced by hormones; however, chronic administration of testosterone or FSH to hypophysectomized rats resulted in increased transferrin receptor mRNA levels in the testis. Northern blot analysis of mRNAs from testes of rats synchronized at various stages of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium showed that transferrin receptor mRNA was differentially regulated throughout the cycle. Northern blots of mRNA from germinal cell populations derived from synchronized tests showed that the message was regulated in the nongerminal cell components of the tubule, most likely the Sertoli cell. The comparison of transferrin receptor mRNA levels in normal testes and testes from hypophysectomized rats, as well as in isolated germinal cells and cultured Sertoli cells, suggested that transferrin receptor mRNA levels were considerably higher in Sertoli cells than in other cell types of the seminiferous tubules.
