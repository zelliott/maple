The early replicative nature of avian myeloblastosis virus core-bound 7 S DNA (AMV DNA), indicated by our preceding findings (RÃ­man et al., 1993), has been confirmed using various experimental approaches. It has been shown by agarose and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that this DNA represents actually a collection of molecules the size of which is strongly reminiscent of the minute early replicative structures found in DNA of sea urchin embryos (Baldari et al., 1978). With such a characteristic correspond, the sequence properties of the individual AMV DNA clones, the majority of which were found to be AT-rich with ARS-like motifs and stretches of A-residues carrying conformational requirements for bending. In comparative hybridization experiments, AMV DNA exhibited the highest homology with chicken leukaemic myeloblast scaffold-bound DNA. Compatible with high replicative activity of AMV DNA was also found its specific [methyl-3H]thymidine radioactivity. The constancy of the virus content of this DNA and its virus age-dependent cleavage changes taking place inside the virus core structure open the question of possible significance of this special host DNA for the reaction machinery represented by the retroviral nucleoprotein core complex.
