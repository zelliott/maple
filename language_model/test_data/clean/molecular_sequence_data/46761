Wild-type and 35 mutant formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) were stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. All cell surface-expressed mutant receptors bound N-formyl peptide with similar affinities as wild-type FPR, suggesting that the mutations did not affect the ligand-binding site. G protein coupling was examined by quantitative analysis of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-induced increase in binding of (35)S-labeled guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPgammaS) to membranes. The most prominent uncoupled FPR mutants were located in the N-terminal part of the second transmembrane domain (S63W and D71A) and the C-terminal interface of the third transmembrane domain (R123A and C124S/C126S). In addition, less pronounced uncoupling was detected with deletion mutations in the third cytoplasmic loop and in the cytoplasmic tail. Further analysis of some of the mutants that were judged to be uncoupled based on the [(35)S]GTPgammaS membrane-binding assay were found to transduce a signal, as evidenced by intracellular calcium mobilization and activation of p42/44 MAPK. Thus, these single point mutations in FPR did not completely abolish the interaction with G protein, emphasizing that the coupling site is coordinated by several different regions of the receptor. Mutations located in the putative fifth and sixth transmembrane domains near the N- and C-terminal parts of the third cytoplasmic loop did not result in uncoupling. These regions have previously been shown to be critical for G protein coupling to many other G protein-coupled receptors. Thus, FPR appears to have a G protein-interacting site distinct from the adrenergic receptors, the muscarinic receptors, and the angiotensin receptors.
