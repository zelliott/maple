Activation of neutrophils by various inflammatory stimuli has been shown to play a pivotal role in septic and posttraumatic tissue injury. To further elucidate the mechanisms modulating the oxidative metabolism, we assessed superoxide production induced by N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) and phorbol myristate acetate and the expression of FMLP receptors of human neutrophils on several days during sepsis and after trauma. Neutrophils of septic patients isolated on days 0-4 after the diagnosis of sepsis showed a significant, more than twofold increase in specific binding of [3H]FMLP at 1, 120, and 240 nM. Scatchard plot analyses revealed that this increase in specific binding was due to an increase in the number of low- and high-affinity FMLP receptors with no changes in receptor affinity. On days 5-10 after the onset of sepsis the up-regulation of FMLP receptors on circulating neutrophils was followed by receptor down-regulation. Likewise, neutrophils from patients with trauma that was not complicated by sepsis bound significantly more [3H]FMLP than neutrophils from volunteers. However, the increase in FMLP receptors was less than that in septic neutrophils and returned earlier to normal. In accordance with the up-regulation of FMLP receptors, neutrophils obtained from patients with sepsis or after trauma on days 1-4 and days 1-2, respectively, produced significantly more superoxide anion upon stimulation with FMLP. However, after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate, a receptor-independent activator of protein kinase C, these cells released less superoxide anion than controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
