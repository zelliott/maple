The hexapeptide dimer (H-Hcy-Glu-His-Phe-D-Lys-Phe-OH)2 was synthesized using solution methods and characterized. Its conversion into H-Met(O2)-Glu-His-Phe-D-Lys-Phe-OH, Org 2766, was studied on a small scale in as short a time as possible; reduction of the disulfide bond using Na/NH3, reaction with CH3I, oxidation with H2O2 and catalyst and purification by HPLC were carried out starting with 2 mg of the dimer in a total preparation time of approximately 22 min, starting with the addition of CH3I. The preparation of the 11C-labelled analogue was carried out by methylation with 11CH3I. Restrictions imposed by working with carbon-11 will be discussed.
