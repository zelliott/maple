A cDNA of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I mRNA was obtained from a rat liver cDNA library. This cDNA contained a 5' terminal sequence of 48 base pairs complementary to a sequence in the 3' terminal region (an inverted repeat sequence) except for one nucleotide insertion in the 3' region. Base sequence analysis of this cDNA, northern blot analysis of rat liver mRNA using a probe specific to 5' region of cDNA, base sequence studies of the 5' upstream region of a clone of the rat IGF-I gene, and some other studies suggested strongly that the inverted repeat sequence of the IGF-I cDNA used was introduced artificially during preparation of the cDNA library.
