Although the liver is the primary site of cytokine-mediated expression of acute-phase serum amyloid A (SAA) protein, extrahepatic production has also been reported. Besides its role in amyloidosis and lipid homeostasis during the acute-phase, SAA has recently been assumed to contribute to bone and cartilage destruction. However, expression of SAA in human osteogenic tissue has not been studied. Therefore, we first show that SAA1 (coding for the major SAA isoform) but not SAA2 transcripts are expressed in human trabecular and cortical bone fractions and bone marrow. Next, we show expression of (i) IL-1, IL-6, and TNF receptor transcripts; (ii) the human homolog of SAA-activating factor-1 (SAF-1, a transcription factor involved in cytokine-mediated induction of SAA genes); and (iii) SAA1/2 transcripts in non-differentiated and, to a higher extent, in osteoblast-like differentiated human mesenchymal stem cells. Third, we provide evidence that human osteoblast-like cells of tumor origin (MG-63 and SAOS-2) express SAF-1 under basal conditions. SAA1/2 transcripts are expressed under basal conditions (SAOS-2) and cytokine-mediated conditions (MG-63 and SAOS-2). RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence technique confirmed cytokine-mediated expression of SAA on RNA and protein level in osteosarcoma cell lines while SAA4, a protein of unknown function, is constitutively expressed in all osteogenic tissues investigated.
