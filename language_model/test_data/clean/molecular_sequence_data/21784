SNARE proteins mediate membrane fusion between synaptic vesicles and the plasma membrane. A minimized peptide SNARE model system with reduced complexity was introduced combining the native SNARE transmembrane (TMD) and linker domains with artificial coiled-coil forming peptides. Specific membrane fusion initiated by coiled-coil recognition was shown by lipid and content mixing vesicle assays.
