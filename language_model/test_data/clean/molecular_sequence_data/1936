To study the diversity of Cryptosporidium spp. in various hosts, we used the variability of the small-subunit rRNA gene and the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein genes. Oocysts from humans, cattle, horses, dogs, field mice, chickens, reptiles, deer, goat, cat, antelope and from a sample of water reservoir were assayed. The zoonotic C. parvum bovine genotype sequence was found to be present in the most of isolates. This study shows a complex epidemiology pattern for C. parvum bovine genotype infections. The identification of cattle, horse, and deer isolates emphasizes a transmission route for C. parvum via these hosts, and identifies a potential source for human infection in the Czech Republic. Furthermore, C. andersoni from a cow, C. baileyi from a chicken, C. felis from a cat, C. meleagridis from a dog, and C. saurophilum and C. serpentis from reptiles were also identified in the isolates from the Czech Republic.
