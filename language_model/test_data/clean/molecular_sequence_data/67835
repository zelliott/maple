Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are present in a wide range of taxonomic groups and played a crucial role in host adaptation to a diverse array of ever-changing pathogens. Crustin, a cysteine-rich cationic AMP, is known to exhibit antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in decapods. Given their important role in host-immune defense, a large proportion of amino acid substitutions in crustin AMPs are expected to be fixed by natural selection. Utilizing the complete coding nucleotide sequence data of crustin, the present study revealed the pervasive role of positive Darwinian selection in the evolution and divergence of crustin AMPs in decapods. Approximately, 20-35Â % of codons in two phylogenetically distinct groups of closely related crustins in Penaeid shrimps are shown to have evolved under positive selection. Interestingly, several of these positively selected sites are located at the carboxyl-terminal region, the region that directly interacts with the invading pathogens. Pathogen-mediated selection pressure could be the likely cause for such an accelerated rate of amino acid substitutions and could have contributed to the structural and functional diversification of crustin AMPs in several taxa.
