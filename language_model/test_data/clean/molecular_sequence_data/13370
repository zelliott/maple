The nucleotide sequence of region 2 of the Escherichia coli K5 capsule gene cluster has been determined. This region, essential for the biosynthesis of the K5 polysaccharide, contained four genes, termed kfiA-D. The G + C ratio was 33.4%, which was lower than the typical G + C ratio for E. coli and that of the flanking regions 1 and 3 in the K5 capsule gene cluster. Three major RNA transcripts were detected within region 2 by Northern blotting and three promoters located by transcript mapping. Promoter activity was confirmed by promoter-probe analysis. The predicted amino acid sequence of KfiC had homology to a number of glycosyl transferase enzymes and overexpression of the KfiC gene resulted in increased K5 transferase activity. The predicted amino acid sequence of KfiD had homology to a number of NAD-dependent dehydrogenase enzymes and was demonstrated to be a UDP-glucose dehydrogenase that catalyses the information of UDP-glucuronic acid from UDP-glucose.
