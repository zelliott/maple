To explore how to improve the immunogenicity of HBcAg CTL epitope based polypeptides and to trigger an HBV-specific HLA I-restricted CD8+ T cell response in vitro.

A new panel of mimetic therapeutic peptides based on the immunodominant B cell epitope of HBV PreS2 18-24 region, the CTL epitope of HBcAg18-27 and the universal T helper epitope of tetanus toxoid (TT) 830-843 was designed using computerized molecular design method and synthesized by Merrifield's solid-phase peptide synthesis. Their immunological properties of stimulating activation and proliferation of lymphocytes, of inducing T( H1) polarization, CD8+ T cell magnification and HBV-specific CD8+ CTL mediated cytotoxicity were investigated in vitro using HLA-A2+ human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors and chronic hepatitis B patients.

Results demonstrated that the therapeutic polypeptides based on immunodominant HBcAg18-27 CTL, PreS2 B- and universal T(H) epitopes could stimulate the activation and proliferation of lymphocytes, induce specifically and effectively CD8+ T cell expansion and vigorous HBV-specific CTL-mediated cytotoxicity in human PBMCs.

It indicated that the introduction of immunodominant T helper plus B-epitopes with short and flexible linkers could dramatically improve the immunogenicity of short CTL epitopes in vitro.
