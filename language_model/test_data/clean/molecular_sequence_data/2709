The activity and cell-type specificity of the promoter of the MF alpha 1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were examined by measuring expression of an MF alpha 1-SUC2 gene fusion in MATa, MAT alpha, and MATa/MAT alpha cells. A high level of invertase activity was observed only in MAT alpha cells. Weak expression occurred in MATa cells when the hybrid gene was carried on a multicopy plasmid or on a centromere-containing plasmid, but not when the hybrid gene was integrated at the normal MF alpha 1 locus. Analysis of a set of 5'-deletions of the promoter region of the MF alpha 1-SUC2 gene on the multicopy plasmid indicated that sequences from -354 to -274 upstream of the translational start site were required for high level expression in MAT alpha cells. Smaller internal deletions and insertions within the promoter region of the MF alpha 1-SUC2 gene were inserted into the genome at the normal MF alpha 1 locus. These mutations further delineated four promoter domains important for expression: (1) two 26 bp elements (-365 to -340 and -312 to -287) with imperfect dyad symmetry; (2) a 40 bp segment (-264 to -226) that lies about 120 bp upstream of the TATA box; and (3) the TATA box itself (-128 to -122). The transcriptional start sites of the normal MF alpha 1 promoter and of a mutant lacking the TATA box were determined. The MF alpha 1 locus was mapped to the left arm of chromosome XVI, about 22 cM centromere-proximal to the PEP4 gene.
