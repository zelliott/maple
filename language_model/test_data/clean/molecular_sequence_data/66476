Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 Slr1471p, an Oxa1p/Alb3/YidC homolog, is an essential protein for cell viability for which functions in thylakoid membrane biogenesis and cell division have been proposed. Using a fusion of green fluorescent protein to the C terminus of Slr1471p, we found that the mutant slr1471-gfp is photochemically inhibited when light intensities increase to 80 micromol x m(-2) x s(-1). We show that photoinhibition correlates with an increased redox potential of the reaction center quinone Q(A)(-) and a decreased redox potential of Q(B)(-). Analysis reveals that membrane integration of the D1 precursor protein is affected, leading to the accumulation of pD1 in the membrane phase. We show that Slr1471p interacts directly with the D1 protein and discuss why the accumulation of pD1 in two reaction center assembly intermediates is dependent on Slr1471p.
