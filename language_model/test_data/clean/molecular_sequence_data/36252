Brown adipocytes are thermogenic cells which play an important role in energy balance. Their thermogenic activity is due to the presence of a mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP). Until recently, it was admitted that in rodents brown adipocytes were mainly located in classical brown adipose tissue (BAT). In the present study, we have investigated the presence of UCP protein or mRNA in white adipose tissue (WAT) of rats. Using polymerase chain reaction or Northern blot hybridization, UCP mRNA was detected in mesenteric, epidydimal, retroperitoneal, inguinal and particularly in periovarian adipose depots. The uncoupling protein was detected by Western blotting in mitochondria from periovarian adipose tissue. When rats were submitted to cold or to treatment with a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, UCP expression was increased in this tissue as in typical brown fat. Moreover, the expression was decreased in obese fa/fa rats compared to lean controls. Morphological studies showed that periovarian adipose tissue of rats kept at 24 degrees C contained cells with numerous typical BAT mitochondria with or without multilocular lipid droplets. Immunocytochemistry confirmed that multilocular cells expressed mitochondrial UCP. Furthermore, the number of brown adipocytes and the density of mitochondrial cristae increased in parallel with exposure to cold. These results demonstrate that adipocytes expressing UCP are present in adipose deposits considered as white fat. They suggest the existence of a continuum in rodents between BAT and WAT, and a great plasticity between adipose tissue phenotypes. The physiological importance of brown adipocytes in WAT and the regulation of UCP expression remain open questions.
