In this study, cDNA for a somatostatin receptor variant (somatostatin receptor subtype 2, SSTR 2) was isolated, cloned, and sequenced from rainbow trout. A 1821-nt cDNA was isolated and found to contain a single initiation site 387-nt from the most 5' end, an open reading frame of 1116-nt, and a single putative polyadenylation site 189-nt from the most 3' end. The encoded protein contains 372 amino acids and contains seven membrane-spanning domains. Based on structural analysis, the protein was identified as a subtype 2 SSTR. These data support the emergence of a multigenic SSTR family early in the course of vertebrate evolution, concomitant with or perhaps prior to the divergence of boney fish. The distribution of SSTR 2 mRNA in tissues was determined by quantitative real time-PCR (QRT-PCR). SSTR 2 was most abundant in the brain (where it was detected in the telencephalon, optic tectum, and hypothalamus), skeletal muscle, and liver, but it also was present in the endocrine pancreas (Brockmann body) and various regions of the gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach, intestine). SSTR 2 mRNA was most abundant in the brain, muscle, and liver. In vitro the Brockmann body and liver with increasing concentrations of glucose (1, 4, 10mM) resulted in increased expression of SSTR 2 mRNA. These findings contribute to the understanding of the evolution of the SSTR family and provide insight into the roles of SSTR 2 in fish.
