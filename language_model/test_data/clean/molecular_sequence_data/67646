This report describes a rare case of neuroinfection due to Prototheca wickerhamii in a child with severe, congenital hydrocephalus. The infection resolved completely after the patient was treated with oral ketoconazole, followed by intravenous fluconazole and amphotericin B. A probable source of infection was contamination during ventriculoperitoneal drain care procedures.
