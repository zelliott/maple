Isolates of Alternaria alternata collected from a field site which had previously been treated with the dicarboximide fungicide iprodione were found to demonstrate a high level of resistance to iprodione and the phenylpyrrole fungicide, fludioxonil in plate assays. In order to determine the genetic basis for this fungicide resistance a partial length clone of a two-component histidine kinase (HK) was isolated from genomic DNA of a fungicide-sensitive A. alternata isolate using degenerate primers by PCR. Analysis of the AaHK1 gene structure indicates the presence of six 90 amino acid repeat domains upstream of a kinase domain as found in the homologous HK genes from other fungal species. Comparison of nucleic acid sequences from the fungicide-sensitive and fungicide-resistant A. alternata isolates confirmed the presence of mutations leading to premature termination of the translated HK protein. The possible role of the two-component HK in the development of dicarboximide resistance in A. alternata is discussed.
