Different kinds of mutations, mostly point mutations, in the coagulation factor IX (FIX) gene F9 result in a recessive X-linked bleeding disorder known as haemophilia B. In this study, molecular analysis of 76 unrelated Iranian haemophilia B patients was performed by PCR, single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) on important functional regions of the F9 gene followed by sequencing on samples with different migration pattern. Using this approach we found mutation in 52 out of 76 patients. Our data showed that the pathologic mechanisms are heterogeneous as recorded for patients in haemophilia B mutation database and seven of the mutations are previously undescribed.
