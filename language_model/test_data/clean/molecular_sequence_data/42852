Jurkat J76 clone, LYON L12.37 clone and L12.37 cells transfected with J76-alpha cDNA or J76 Tcr-alpha mutated cDNA (J79) were analysed for membrane expression of Tcr/CD3 complex using WT31 mAb (Tcr-alpha, beta) or Tcr-delta 1 mAb (Tcr-gamma, delta): LYON cells express V beta 9 bearing Tcr-beta chains. J76 Tcr-alpha cDNA transfected LYON cells have intracellular Tcr-gamma, delta chains and J79 Tcr-alpha cDNA transfected LYON cells have intracellular Tcr-alpha (M), beta chains.
