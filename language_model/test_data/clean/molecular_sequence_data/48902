Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious bacterial disease that causes morbidity and mortality, especially in developing countries. Although its efficacy against TB has displayed a high degree of variability (0%-80%) in different trials, Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) has been recognized as an important weapon for preventing TB worldwide for over 80 years. Because secreted proteins often play vital roles in the interaction between bacteria and host cells, the secretome of mycobacteria is considered to be an attractive reservoir of potential candidate antigens for the development of novel vaccines and diagnostic reagents. In this study, we performed a proteomic analysis of BCG culture filtrate proteins using SDS-PAGE and high-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry. In total, 239 proteins (1555 unique peptides) were identified, including 185 secreted proteins or lipoproteins. Furthermore, 17 novel protein products not annotated in the BCG database were detected and validated by means of RT-PCR at the transcriptional level. Additionally, the translational start sites of 52 proteins were confirmed, and 22 proteins were validated through extension of the translational start sites based on N-terminus-derived peptides. There are 103 secreted proteins that have not been reported in previous studies on BCG [corrected] secretome and are unique to our study. The physicochemical characteristics of the secreted proteins were determined. Major components from the culture supernatant, including low-molecular-weight antigens, lipoproteins, Pro-Glu and Pro-Pro-Glu family proteins, and Mce family proteins, are discussed; some components represent potential predominant antigens in the humoral and cellular immune responses.
