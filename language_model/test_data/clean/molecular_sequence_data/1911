In an effort to identify host proteins involved in herpes simplex virus type 1 replication, monkey and human cellular protein activities (called OF-1) that bind the viral replication origin, oriS, have been described. We show by mass spectrometry that the DNA-binding component of human OF-1 contains Ku70 and Ku80 proteins.
