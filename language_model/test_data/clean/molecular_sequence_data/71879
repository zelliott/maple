Although we are currently unaware of its biological function, the fibril-like surface structure is a prominent characteristic of the rough (Rg) genotype of the gram-positive periodontal pathogen Peptostreptococcus micros. The smooth (Sm) type of this species as well as the smooth variant of the Rg type (RgSm) lack these structures on their surface. A fibril-specific serum, as determined by immunogold electron microscopy, was obtained through adsorption of a rabbit anti-Rg type serum with excess bacteria of the RgSm type. This serum recognized a 42-kDa protein, which was subjected to N-terminal sequencing. Both clones of a lambdaTriplEx expression library that were selected by immunoscreening with the fibril-specific serum contained an open reading frame, designated fibA, encoding a 393-amino-acid protein (FibA). The 15-residue N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 42-kDa antigen was present at positions 39 to 53 in FibA; from this we conclude that the mature FibA protein contains 355 amino acids, resulting in a predicted molecular mass of 41,368 Da. The putative 38-residue signal sequence of FibA strongly resembles other gram-positive secretion signal sequences. The C termini of FibA and two open reading frames directly upstream and downstream of fibA exhibited significant sequence homology to the C termini of a group of secreted and surface-located proteins of other gram-positive cocci that are all presumably involved in anchoring of the protein to carbohydrate structures. We conclude that FibA is a secreted and surface-located protein and as such is part of the fibril-like structures.
