Agrobacterium sp. ATCC 31749 is an industrial strain for the commercial production of curdlan, an important exopolysaccharide with food and medical applications. Here we report the genome sequence of the curdlan-producing strain ATCC 31749. Genome sequencing is the first step toward the understanding of regulation of curdlan biosynthesis.
