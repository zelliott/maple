The enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK) is a defining activity of the highly conserved glycolytic pathway, and is present in the domains Bacteria, Eukarya, and Archaea. PFK subtypes are now known that utilize either ATP, ADP, or pyrophosphate as the primary phosphoryl donor and share the ability to catalyze the transfer of phosphate to the 1-position of fructose-6-phosphate. Because of the crucial position in the glycolytic pathway of PFKs, their biochemical characteristics and phylogenies may play a significant role in elucidating the origins of glycolysis and, indeed, of metabolism itself. Despite the shared ability to phosphorylate fructose-6-phosphate, PFKs that have been characterized to date now fall into three sequence families: the PFKA family, consisting of the well-known higher eukaryotic ATP-dependent PFKs together with their ATP- and pyrophosphate-dependent bacterial cousins (including the crenarchaeal pyrophosphate-dependent PFK of Thermoprotetus tenax) and plant pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinases; the PFKB family, exemplified by the minor ATP-dependent PFK activity of Escherichia coli (PFK 2), but which also includes at least one crenarchaeal enzyme in Aeropyrum pernix; and the tentatively named PFKC family, which contains the unique ADP-dependent PFKs from the euryarchaeal genera of Pyrococcus and Thermococcus, which are indicated by sequence analysis to be present also in the methanogenic species Methanococcus jannaschii and Methanosarcina mazei.
