The lectin from Bowringia mildbraedii seeds crystallizes in the presence of the disaccharide Man(alpha1-2)Man. The best crystals grow at 293 K within four weeks after a pre-incubation at 277 K to induce nucleation. A complete data set was collected to a resolution of 1.90 A using synchrotron radiation. The crystals belong to space group I222, with unit-cell parameters a = 66.06, b = 86.35, c = 91.76 A, and contain one lectin monomer in the asymmetric unit.
