Bacterial collagenase from aerobic non-pathogenic Vibrio alginolyticus chemovar iophagus ("Achromobacter" collagenase, EC 3.4.24.08) is an inducible extracellular metallo-proteinase. Production of Vibrio collagenase is induced specifically by collagen or by its macromolecular fragments. On the cell surface is expressed a specific receptor recognizing collagen structure. The study of natural inducers led to synthetic peptides with inducing properties. Vibrio collagenase cleaves collagen helical chains preferentially at 3/4 from the N-terminal. Its specific activity on synthetic substrate, 180,000 ukat/mg, represents the highest value for known collagenases. Its specificity differs from that of Clostridium: The enzyme cleaves preferentially sequences with Gly or Ala in position P'1 and Pro in position P2 or P'2. Highly specific cleavages were obtained in beta-casein, prolactin, myosin, adenylate kinase and fibronectin. Autolysis yields partially degraded forms still active on native collagen and peptide substrate. The determination of the sequence of Vibrio collagenase is nearly achieved; the enzyme was not yet obtained in crystalline form. On basis of the already known sequence and structure of Hypoderma collagenase (EC 3.4.21.49), a hypothesis is advanced on the character of collagen binding site loops. Vibrio collagenase can be produced in kilogram quantities at low cost. It was found highly efficient in debridement of necrotic burns, ulcers and decubitus.
