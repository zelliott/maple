Supercoiled pHXBc2 DNA (containing the genome of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and human sequences) migrated more slowly than linear DNA in native and ethidium bromide agarose gel electrophoresis at 4.5 volts/cm, suggesting the presence of unusual DNA structures. S1 nuclease analysis of pHXBc2 revealed two S1 hypersensitive sites. Site I was located within a 25 bp direct repeat in host DNA 0.6 kB upstream from the 5' LTR. Site II was mapped 0.2 kB upstream from the vif gene start site. Sequence analysis showed that Site I sequences could assume different unusual DNA structures, whereas sequences at Site II could assume either slipped or H-DNA forms. Unusual DNA structures in host DNA may be associated with active chromatin regions and may favor proviral integration.
