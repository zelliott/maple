Two families of fungal mitochondrial introns that include all known sequences have been recognized. These families are now extended to incorporate a plant mitochondrial intron and several introns in chloroplast- and nuclear-encoded rRNA and tRNA precursors. Members of the same family share distinctive sequence stretches and a number of potential RNA secondary structures that would bring these stretches and the intron-exon junctions into relatively close proximity. Using several of these introns which have been extensively studied by either biochemical or genetic means, an attempt is made to integrate the available data into a common picture.
