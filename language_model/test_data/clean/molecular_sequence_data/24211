Plant genes that are induced during the formation and function of a root nodule are called nodulin genes. Cloning and functional analysis of nodule-specific gene products are of valuable help in establishing the role and requirements of the host plant for the specificity and effectiveness of the symbiosis. A cDNA clone (nod22) was isolated from Phaseolus vulgaris L. (common bean) cDNA library derived from Rhizobium-infected roots. Nodulin 22 (Nod22) transcripts are accumulated from early to late stages in root nodule development. RT-PCR in situ studies indicated that Nod22 transcripts are highly accumulated in cortical, vascular bundle and infected cells. The deduced Nod22 protein contains a highly hydrophobic N-terminus, with signal peptide characteristics, and a C-terminal extension with high identity to the alpha-crystallin domains found in alpha-crystallin lens chaperone, and other small heat-shock proteins. These domains have not been previously described in other known nodulins, but have been observed in small heat-shock proteins found in plant tissues exposed to elevated temperature and oxidative stress. Nod22, when it is over-expressed in Escherichia coli, cells confers protection against oxidative stress suggesting its possible role in plant host protection from oxidative toxicity during the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis.
