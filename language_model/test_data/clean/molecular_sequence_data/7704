We have cloned and characterized a genetic element (1187 bp) that is responsible for the induction of thermotolerance as well as ompC expression in E. coli. This element (ISLtaq1) was isolated from Thermus aquaticus. DNA and protein data bases were searched with this element (ISLtaq1), which suggested it to be very similar to IS150 belonging to the IS3 family. ORF1, found on ISLtaq1, which encodes 100 amino acids (aa), had a DNA-binding motif: a helix-turn-helix and a leucine zipper. In fact, when the ORF1 protein was overproduced in E. coli, thermotolerance as well as ompC expression was induced.
