A 35-nucleotide pseudoknot that binds vitamin B12 been isolated using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). Affinity chromatography was used to purify functional, properly folded molecules and the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method was used to crystallize this aptamer. Two crystal forms have been obtained and the preliminary crystallographic characterization is reported here. Both crystal forms (space groups I222 or I212121 and C2221) diffract to 2.9 A and should prove sufficient for structure determination.
