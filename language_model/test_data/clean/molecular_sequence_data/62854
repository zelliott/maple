The ND4L subunit of mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is an integral membrane protein that contains two highly conserved glutamates within putative trans-membrane helices. We employed complex I from Escherichia coli (NDH-1) to study the role of these residues by site-directed mutagenesis. The conserved glutamates of the NuoK subunit, E36 and E72, were replaced by either Asp or Gln residues, and the effects of the mutations on cell growth and catalysis of electron transfer from deamino-NADH to ubiquinone analogues were examined. Additional mutants that carried acidic residues at selected positions within this domain were also prepared and analyzed. The results indicated that two closely located membrane-embedded acidic residues in NuoK are essential for high rates of ubiquinone reduction, a prerequisite for the growth of cytochrome bo-deficient E. coli cells on malate as the main carbon source. The two acidic residues do not have to be on adjacent helices, and mutual location on the same helix, either helix 2 or 3, at an interval of three amino acids (about one turn of the putative helix), resulted in high activity and good growth phenotypes. Nevertheless, shifting only one of them, either E36 or E72, toward the periplasmic side of the membrane by about one turn of the helix severely hampered activity and growth, whereas moving both acidic residues together to that deeper membrane position stimulated the ubiquinone reductase activity of the enzyme but not cell growth on malate, suggesting impaired energy conservation in this mutant.
