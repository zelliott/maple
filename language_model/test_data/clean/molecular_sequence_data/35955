In fission yeast p34cdc2/cyclin is activated at the G2/M boundary by dephosphorylation of Tyr15 of the p34cdc2 subunit. Two protein phosphatases carry out this dephosphorylation event. The major activity is encoded by cdc25, which is a distantly related member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family. A minor activity is provided by a newly identified fission yeast protein tyrosine phosphatase.
