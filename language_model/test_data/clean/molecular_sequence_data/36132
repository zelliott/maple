We have analysed the molecular basis of beta-thalassaemia in 22 Anglo-Saxon individuals, all of whom were heterozygous for beta-thalassaemia except for one, who was a compound heterozygote. Using a combination of allele-specific priming of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing of genomic DNA amplified by the PCR, 20/23 beta-thalassaemic genes were characterized. Nine different mutations were identified; four are commonly found in the Mediterranean, one in Asia, one has been described previously in both Europe and Asia, and three are rare mutations associated with a dominant beta-thalassaemia phenotype. In three individuals the mutation remains uncharacterized despite sequence analysis of the beta-globin gene and its immediate flanking regions. We report our findings and discuss the diversity of these mutations.
