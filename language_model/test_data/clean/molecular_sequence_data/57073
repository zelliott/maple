A deletion mutant in the low density lipoprotein receptor gene of a Japanese patient with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia was analyzed. Genomic Southern blotting showed abnormal size restriction fragments with BamHI (7.8 kb), EcoRI (3.8 kb), BglII (17 kb), KpnI (> 23 kb), EcoRV (13 kb), and XbaI (14 kb). The abnormal EcoRI fragment, 3.8 kb, was cloned into lambda phage vector, and the deleted region of 10 kb including exons 2 and 3 was identified. The nucleotide sequence around the deletion joint was determined. The sequence of the eight nucleotides in the deletion-joint region of the mutant gene was identical to the corresponding sequences of both introns 1 and 3 of the normal gene. The deletion seemed to occur by an unequal recombination between the Alu-like sequences in the same direction in introns 1 and 3.
