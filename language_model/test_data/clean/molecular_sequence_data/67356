Limited protection of current vaccines and antiviral drugs against influenza A virus infection underscores the urgent need for development of novel anti-influenza virus interventions. While short interfering RNA (siRNA) has been shown to be able to inhibit influenza virus infection in a gene-specific manner, activation of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I protein (RIG-I) pathway has an antiviral effect in a non-gene-specific mode. In this study, we designed and tested the anti-influenza virus effect of a short double-stranded RNA, designated 3p-mNP1496-siRNA, that possesses dual functions: an siRNA-targeting influenza NP gene and an agonist for RIG-I activation. This double-stranded siRNA possesses a triphosphate group at the 5' end of the sense strand and is blunt ended. Our study showed that 3p-mNP1496-siRNA could potently inhibit influenza A virus infection both in cell culture and in mice. The strong inhibition effect was attributed to its siRNA function as well as its ability to activate the RIG-I pathway. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that the combination of siRNA and RIG-I pathway activation can synergistically inhibit influenza A virus infection. The development of such dual functional RNA molecules will greatly contribute to the arsenal of tools to combat not only influenza viruses but also other important viral pathogens.
