Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) establishes latent infections in hematopoietic cells such as granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GM-Ps). During latency the virus is sequestered in a nonreplicating state, although limited transcriptional activity has been previously reported. In this study we sought to further examine viral gene expression during the latent phase of infection. Using an experimental model of latency, primary human GM-Ps were latently infected with CMV strain Toledo and extracted RNA subjected to reverse transcription-PCR by using CMV gene-specific primers. Using this approach, we detected transcription from the UL111.5A region of the viral genome. This transcription was also detected in GM-Ps latently infected with AD169 and Towne strains, indicating that expression was CMV strain independent. Significantly, we detected UL111.5A-region transcripts in mononuclear cells from healthy bone marrow and mobilized peripheral blood allograft donors, demonstrating expression during natural latent infection. Mapping experiments with RNA extracted from latently infected GM-Ps revealed the expression of a novel UL111.5A region transcript with a splicing pattern that differed from that reported during productive infection of permissive cells. This UL111.5A region transcript expressed during latent infection is predicted to encode a 139-amino-acid protein with homology to the potent immunosuppressor interleukin-10 (IL-10) and to the viral IL-10 homolog that is expressed during productive CMV infection. Expression of a latency-associated cmvIL-10 may confer upon the virus an ability to avoid immune recognition and clearance during the latent phase of infection.
