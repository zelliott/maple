Adenovirus strains of a new type were isolated from patients with epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. They were not completely neutralized by any antiserum against adenovirus prototypes. PCR followed by restriction endonuclease analysis demonstrated that they were type 8. PCR followed by sequencing revealed a high homology rate between them and type 9.
