A new version of a two-dimensional electrophoretic catalog of proteins of the human kidney and of various morphological and functional structures of the human kidney is presented; it contains information about 179 polypeptides. The following proteins were identified: crystallin, albumin, mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, actin, fatty acid-binding protein, alpha-ATP-synthase, and transferrin. Some protein groups are specific for certain morphological structures.
