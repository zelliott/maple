Lectins have been used for the determination of the oligosaccharide structures expressed by two monoclonal IgG antibodies, MN12 and RIV6. Dot blot experiments revealed the presence of terminal Fuc alpha (1-->6)GlcNAc, Gal beta (1-->3)GalNAc, Gal beta (1-->4)GlcNAc, Man alpha (1-->6, 1-->3)Man, NeuAc alpha (2-->6)Gal and NeuAc alpha (2-->6)GalNAc on both monoclonal antibodies. MN12 was shown to contain a carbohydrate moiety within the Fc region only. RIV6 contained carbohydrate moieties within both the Fc and Fab regions. Additional O-glycosidic linked carbohydrate chains were detected within the Fc region of both monoclonal antibodies. High mannose structures were also detected on both Mabs.
