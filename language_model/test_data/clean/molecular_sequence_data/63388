In the present study, we analyzed differential composition of blood serum from Ehrlich carcinoma-bearing and healthy male C57Bl/6 mice by isolating complexes of hemoglobin and other serum proteins by a proteomic approach (gel filtration, gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry). The hemoglobin fractions isolated from the serum of mice- bearing tumors contained several proteins with molecular weights of 15, 65, 68, and 100 kDa, while hemoglobin fractions isolated from the serum of healthy mice did not contain additional protein bands. These bands were identified by MALDI-TOF as haptoglobin, serum albumin, a homologue of alpha-fetoprotein, and hemoglobin-alpha. Ion exchange chromatography indicated complex formation of these proteins. Injection of hemoglobin-associated blood serum proteins (HAP) isolated from tumor-bearing animals, leads to tumor regression. Intraperitoneally injected HAP-induced apoptosis in Ehrlich carcinoma cells but not normal peritoneal cells and led to a complete regression of the ascitic or solid Ehrlich carcinoma. A one-year follow up of the animals did not reveal any signs of tumor growth. In conclusion, HAP might be a novel principle of tumor regression. The clinical relevance of these findings with Ehrlich carcinoma should be investigated in the future.
