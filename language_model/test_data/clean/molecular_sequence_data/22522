An aerobic bacterium (BCc6), isolated from nonylphenol polyethoxylates (NPEOs)-contaminated sludge, was shown to be capable of degrading low-ethoxylated NPEO mixtures. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene (rDNA) showed that it clustered with Stenotrophomonas nitritireducens. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), performed on BCc6 strain and on the previously isolated Stenotrophomonas BCaL2, also involved in NPEO degradation but clustering with S. maltophilia, showed that strain BCc6 did not hybridize with the S. maltophilia-specific probe, and neither of the two strains hybridized with probes targeted to the Gammaproteobacteria site, rDNA analyses performed on the two strains evidenced two new polymorphisms, the first one at the 23S rRNA Gammaproteobacteria site, characterizing the known members of the Stenotrophomonas genus, and the other one at the 16S rRNA level, characteristic of S. nitritireducens. Two new FISH probes were designed accordingly, tested on control bacterial cultures, and employed for in situ monitoring of Stenotrophomonas representatives.
