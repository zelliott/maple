To determine the effect of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) on left gastric artery (LGA) flow and to unveil the structural or functional important sites that may be critical for discrimination of different receptor subtypes.

Peptides, including PACAP-27, PACAP-38, amino acid substituted PACAP-27 and C-terminus truncated analogues PACAP (27-38), were synthesized by a simultaneous multiple solid-phase peptide synthesizer. Flow probes of an ultrasound transit-time blood flowmeter were placed around the LGA of beagle dogs. When peptides were infused intravenously, the blood flow was measured.

[Ala4, Val5]-PACAP-27 caused a concentration-dependent vasodepressor action which was similar to that caused by PACAP-27. The LGA blood flow response to [Ala4, Val5]-PACAP-27 was significantly higher than that to PACAP-27, which was similar to that to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) at the same dose. [Ala6]-PACAP-27 did not increase the peak LGA flow. [Gly8]-PACAP-27 showed a similar activity to VIP. [Asn24, Ser25, Ile26]-PACAP-27 did not change the activity of peptides at all doses.

NH2 terminus is more important to biological activity of peptides and specific receptor recognition than COOH-terminus.
