Mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) proteins in parasitic protozoa like Trypanosoma brucei are poorly characterized. In fungi and higher eukaryotes, Tob55 is responsible for the assembly of β-barrel proteins in the MOM. Here we show that T. brucei Tob55 (TbTob55) has considerable similarity in its primary and secondary structure to Tob55 from other species. TbTob55 is localized in T. brucei MOM and is essential for procyclic cell survival. Induction of Tob55 RNAi decreased the level of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) within 48 h. Although the primary effect is on VDAC, induction of TbTob55 RNAi for 96 h or more also decreased the levels of other nucleus encoded mitochondrial proteins. In addition, the mitochondrial membrane potential was reduced at this later time point possibly due to a reduction in the level of the proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation. However, mitochondrial structure was not altered due to depletion of Tob55. In vitro protein import of VDAC into mitochondria with a 50-60% reduction of TbTob55 was reduced about 40% in comparison to uninduced control. In addition, the import of presequence-containing proteins such as, cytochrome oxidase subunit 4 (COIV) and trypanosome alternative oxidase (TAO) was affected by about 20% under this condition. Depletion of VDAC levels by RNAi did not affect the import of either COIV or TAO. Furthermore, TbTob55 over expression increased the steady state level of VDAC as well as the level of the assembled protein complex of VDAC, suggesting that similar to other eukaryotes TbTob55 is involved in assembly of MOM β-barrel proteins and plays an indirect role in the biogenesis of mitochondrial preproteins destined for the mitochondrial inner membrane.
