In a microbial fuel cell (MFC), exoelectrogens, which transfer electrons to the electrode, have been regarded as a key factor for electricity generation. In this study, U-tube MFC and plating methods were used to isolate exoelectrogens from the anode of an MFC. Disparate microorganisms were identified depending on isolation methods, despite the use of an identical source. Denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis showed that certain microorganisms became dominant in the U-tube MFC. The predominant bacterium was similar to Ochrobactrum sp., belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria, which was shown to be able to function as an exoelectrogen in a previous study. Three isolates, one affiliated with Bacillus sp. and two with Paenibacillus sp., were identified using the plating method, which belonged to the Gram-positive bacteria, the Firmicutes. The U-tube MFCs were inoculated with the three isolates using the plating method, operated in the batch mode and the current was monitored. All of the U-tube MFCs inoculated with each isolate after isolation from plates produced lower current (peak current density: 3.6-16.3 mA/m(2)) than those in U-tube MFCs with mixed culture (48.3-62.6 mA/m(2)). Although the isolates produced low currents, various bacterial groups were found to be involved in current production.
