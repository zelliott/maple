We analyze the recombinant structures and phylogenetic relationships of nine near full-length genome sequences of HIV-1 BF intersubtype recombinant viruses from Brazil, eight of them newly derived. These were obtained by PCR amplification from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) DNA or PBMCs culture supernantant RNA. The recombinants exhibited unique mosaic structures, except two viruses with a single near coincident breakpoint. Comparison with CRF12_BF revealed only two coincident breakpoints in two recombinants. Phylogenetic analyses failed to support a common ancestry of Brazilian recombinants or their relationship to CRF12_BF, which widely circulates in Argentina. Intersubtype breakpoint distribution along the genome was uneven, with the highest mean frequency in the polymerase domain of reverse transcriptase, and the lowest in env. These results indicate that HIV-1 BF recombinants from Brazil have independent origins and are unrelated to CRF12_BF, and that intersubtype breakpoints are frequent in pol segments analyzed for drug resistance detection.
