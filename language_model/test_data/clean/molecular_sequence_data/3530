Molecular dynamics calculations demonstrated the conformational change in the prion protein due to Ala(117)-->Val mutation, which is related to Gerstmann-Str√§ussler-Sheinker disease, one of the familial prion diseases. Three kinds of model structures of human and mouse prion proteins were examined: (model 1) nuclear magnetic resonance structures of human prion protein HuPrP (125-228) and mouse prion protein MoPrP (124-224), each having a globular domain consisting of three alpha-helices and an antiparallel beta-sheet; (model 2) extra peptides including Ala(117) (109-124 in HuPrP and 109-123 in MoPrP) plus the nuclear magnetic resonance structures of model 1; and (model 3) extra peptides including Val(117) (109-124 in HuPrP and 109-123 in MoPrP) plus the nuclear magnetic resonance structures of model 1. The results of molecular dynamics calculations indicated that the globular domains of models 1 and 2 were stable and that the extra peptide in model 2 tended to form a new alpha-helix. On the other hand, the globular domain of model 3 was unstable, and the beta-sheet region increased especially in HuPrP.
