The nucleotide sequences of genes homologous to the Klebsiella pneumoniae nifEN genes have been determined in Bradyrhizobium japonicum 110. The coding regions for the nifE and nifN consist, respectively, of 1641 and 1407 nucleotides. The nifD gene (coding for the beta-subunit of dinitrogenase) and nifE are linked, and separated by 95 nucleotides. In the region of 12 nucleotides that separates nifE from nifN the stop codon for nifE overlaps the putative ribosome binding site for nifN. In contrast to Klebsiella and Azotobacter vinelandii, the B. japonicum nifEN genes are linked to the nifDK genes in the same operon. Comparison of dinitrogenase polypeptides (nifDK products) and the polypeptides of the nifE and nifN genes reveals considerable homology between nifD and nifE, and between nifK and nifN. Several protein domains, containing highly conserved cysteine residues, are conserved among the gene products of nifD, nifK, nifE and nifN. This result allows us to propose a probable evolutionary pathway for the common origin of these genes.
