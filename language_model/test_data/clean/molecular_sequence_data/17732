The gene coding for the ATCGAT specific BanIII DNA methyltransferase (M-BanIII) of Bacillus aneurinolyticus was cloned and its nucleotides sequenced. The coding region was assigned on the nucleotide sequence on the basis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence and molecular weight of the enzyme. The M-BanIII gene coded for a protein of 580 amino acid residues (MW 66,344). Comparison with other methylases indicated that the M-BanIII sequence contained a segment of tetra-amino acids, NPPY, characteristic of N6-adenine methylases. In addition, some homologous regions were found in the sequences of type II adenine methylases PaeR7I(CTCGAG), TaqI(TCGA) and PstI(CTGCAG), containing TCGA within the recognition sequences.
