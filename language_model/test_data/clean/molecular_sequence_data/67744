The adenovirus IVa2 protein has been implicated as a transcriptional activator of the viral major late promoter (MLP) and a key component in the packaging of the viral genome. IVa2 functions in packaging through its ability to form a complex with the viral L1 52/55kDa protein, which is required for encapsidation. IVa2, alone and in conjunction with another viral protein, the L4 22K protein, binds to the packaging sequence on the viral genome and to specific elements in the promoter. To define the DNA binding domain on IVa2 and determine its contribution to the viral life cycle, we created a mutant protein that lacks a putative helix-turn-helix motif at the extreme C-terminus. Characterization of this mutant protein showed that while MLP activity is relatively unaffected, it is unable to bind to and package DNA.
