The taxonomic position of Rhodococcus strain RHA1, an effective degrader of polychlorinated biphenyls with a large linear chromosome, was established using a polyphasic approach. The morphological and chemotaxonomic properties of the strain were typical of members of the genus Rhodococcus. The strain shared a high level of 16S rRNA sequence similarity (99.9Â %) with the type strain of Rhodococcus jostii, a member of the Rhodococcus erythropolis subclade. The two strains shared a DNA:DNA relatedness value well above the cut-off point recommended for the circumscription of genomic species and had a broad range of phenotypic properties in common. The combination of genomic and phenotypic data show strain RHA1 to be a bona fide member of the species Rhodococcus jostii.
