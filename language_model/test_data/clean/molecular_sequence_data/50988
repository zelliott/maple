Proton pumps that belong to the families of F-ATPases and V-ATPases operate without the formation of a phosphorylated intermediate and contain several subunits grouped into distinct catalytic and membrane sectors. Recent studies on the structure and molecular biology of V-ATPases shed light not only on the structure-function relations between the two families, but also on their evolution in all organisms.
