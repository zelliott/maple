The investigated cell wall polysaccharide of Arthrobacter sp. VKM Ac-2576 (phylum Actinobacteria) is a (1→6)-linked β-D-galactofuranan with the α-D-GlcpNAc3NAc residues that glycosylate virtually all (~90%) hydroxyl groups at C-2 of galactose. Its repeating unit has the following structure: →6)D-β-Galf-(1→2) ↑ α-D-GlcpNAc3NAc-(1 (90%). The structure of the polysaccharide was established by chemical and NMR spectroscopic methods; it is identified for the first time.
