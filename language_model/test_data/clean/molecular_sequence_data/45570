Acinetobacter baumannii is a multiresistant opportunistic nosocomial pathogen. A protein fraction was purified and analyzed by 2-DE. Twenty-nine major protein spots were selected for protein identification using trypsin digestion and MS analysis. As the A. baumannii genome has not yet been described, protein identification was performed by homology with other Acinetobacter species in the NCBi database. We identified ribosomal proteins, chaperones, elongation factors and outer membrane proteins (Omp), such as OmpA and the 33-36-kDa OMP. Proteomic analysis of A. baumannii provides a platform for further studies in antimicrobial resistance.
