1. Following the recent demonstration of a glutaminyl cyclase activity localized in adrenomedullary chromaffin vesicles, an assay was developed to isolate and characterize posttranslationally modified peptides from this tissue which contain pyroglutamate. This assay consisted of spectrometric identification of peptides before and after enzymatic removal of pyroglutamyl residues. 2. Using this procedure, a pyroglutamyl peptide (BAM-1745) was isolated and sequenced and was shown to be a significant component of adrenomedullary secretory vesicles. 3. A computer search through the Swiss-Prot protein sequence database revealed a 93% identity of BAM-1745 and a fragment of human chromogranin B (Gln580-Tyr593).
