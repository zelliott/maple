The genome of a novel classical swine fever virus (CSFV), SWH/CA/2004, isolated from a hog pen in Henan Province, central China, is 12,296 nucleotides (nt) in length. It is composed of a 373-nt 5' terminal non-translated region (NTR), a 11,697-nt open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polyprotein of 3,898 amino acids (aa), and a 226-nt 3'-NTR. Genome comparison of the SWH/CA/2004 isolate (GenBank Accession: DQ127910) with other known CSFV isolates was performed and analyzed. Corresponding segments from SWH/CA/2004 and other reported strains shared 80.4-99.8% identity at the nucleotide level and 89.5-99.8% identity at the amino acid level. From an evolutionary point of view, isolate SWH/CA/2004 is closely related to the highly virulent isolate cF114/CA/2001, with a pairwise distance of 0.013; and distantly related to the moderately virulent isolate GXWZ02/CA/2003, with pairwise distance 0.170. The phylogenetic trees of the full-length genome and the following region E(rns), E1, E2, and NS5B-based neighbor-joining (NJ) method were constructed and approximately divided into different genetic groups according to avirulence, moderate virulence and high virulence, while other region-based NJ trees demonstrated sequence conservation between these groups. The four genomic regions may constitute important criteria for genetic typing of diverse CSFV isolates. Based on these analyses, isolate SWH/CA/2004 was deduced to belong to the highly virulent isolate group. However, SWH/CA/2004 also contains a 14-U deletion in the 3'-NTR that is characteristic of avirulent isolates. These analyses constitute a comprehensive study of the phylogenetics of CSF based on distinct regions of the genome and may provide the basis for future molecular epidemiology research to identify virulent strain outbreaks and trigger implementation of appropriate control measures.
