The Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) encompasses important pathogens in both animals and humans, yet little information is available on the factors required for MAC virulence. An animal isolate, M. avium strain 724 was found to be considerably more virulent in Balb/c mice than a human isolate, M. avium strain A5. To identify the genetic basis of this difference subtractive hybridization was applied, which resulted in the isolation of six DNA fragments unique to strain 724. BLAST searches showed that three sequences belonged to a large gene cluster responsible for biosynthesis of M. avium glycopeptidolipids (GPLs). To reveal the nature of variation between strains in the GPL cluster 27.5kb of a clone containing the A5 serotype-specific GPL (ssGPL) cluster was isolated, sequenced and compared to the corresponding region in other M. avium strains. The ssGPL cluster was highly conserved in the 5' region between all strains and serotypes tested; the 3' region reflects extensive divergence among serotypes including whole gene deletions and insertions of sequences containing open reading frames but lacking identity to any known genes.
