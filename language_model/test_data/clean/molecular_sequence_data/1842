Cyanobacteria contain several genes, annotated ndh, whose products show sequence similarities to subunits found in complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of eubacteria and mitochondria. However, it is still unclear whether the cyanobacterial ndh gene products actually form a single large protein complex or exist as smaller independent complexes. To address this, we have constructed a strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in which the C terminus of the NdhJ subunit was fused to an His(6) tag to aid isolation. Three major NdhJ-containing complexes were resolved by blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with approximate apparent molecular masses of 460, 330, and 110 kDa. N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry revealed that the 460-kDa complex contained ten annotated ndh gene products. Detergent-induced fragmentation experiments indicated that the 460-kDa complex was composed of hydrophobic (150 kDa) and hydrophilic (110-130 kDa) modules similar to that found in the minimal form of complex I found in Escherichia coli, except that the electron input module was not conserved. The difference in size between the 460- and 330-kDa complexes is attributed to differences in the stoichiometry of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic modules in the complex, either 2:1 or 1:1, respectively. We have also detected the presence of two new Ndh subunits (slr1623 and sll1262) that are unrelated to subunits in the eubacterial complex I but which have homologues in the closely related chloroplast Ndh complex of maize (Funk, E., Schäfer, E., and Steinmüller, K. (1999) J. Plant Physiol. 154, 16-23). The presence of these additional subunits might reflect the use by the NDH-1 and Ndh complexes of a different, so far unidentified, electron input module.
