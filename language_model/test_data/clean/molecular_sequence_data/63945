Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) was identified as an immunodominant antigen by screening a Wuchereria bancrofti (Wb) microfilarial cDNA library with pooled Wb-infected sera, with 28% of the immunopositive clones coding for Wb-HSP70. The deduced amino acid sequence showed greater than 97 and 85% identity with HSP70 from filarial nematodes and humans, respectively. Recombinant HSP70 (74 kDa) and a recombinant protein from the C-terminal portion (43 kDa) also reacted with pooled Wb-infected sera, suggesting that the C-terminal region of HSP70 contains at least one antibody epitope. Brugia malayi L3 larvae showed increasing levels of HSP70 with increasing temperatures. Further, a polyclonal mouse anti-Wb-HSP70 antibody had reactivity to the HSP70 of cattle filarial parasite Settaria digitata and to human HSP70 derived from a Hep-2 cell line. Immune reactivity to Wb-HSP70 was strong, with uninfected non-endemic normal sera showing significantly greater reactions than sera from filaria-infected individuals. Both immunodominant self-HSP70 and HSP70 from other microbial infections may be primary targets for developing autoantibodies naturally.
