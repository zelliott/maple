Methylating agents modify DNA at many different sites, thereby producing lethal and mutagenic lesions. To remove all the main harmful base lesions, at least three types of DNA-repair activities can be used, each of which involves a different reaction mechanism. These activities include DNA-glycosylases, DNA-methyltransferases and the recently characterized DNA-dioxygenases. The Escherichia coli AlkB dioxygenase and the two human homologues, ABH2 and ABH3, represent a novel mechanism of DNA repair. They use iron-oxo intermediates to oxidize stable methylated bases in DNA and directly revert them to the unmodified form.
