A new method for isolation and characterization of peptides presented in the context of the nonclassical human leukocytes antigen (HLA) class I molecule HLA-E was developed. A combination of different chromatographic steps coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry allowed us to detect the presence of small amounts of a naturally processed human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-derived peptide isolated from the HEK-293T/HLA-E+/UL40+ transfected cells of from HELA cell line. The peptide sequence was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). This approach provides a versatile and sensitive method for direct identification of MHC class I-binding peptides that might be derive from different pathogen or tumor-associated proteins.
