We have previously reported new Mtv loci, Mtv-48 and -51, in the Japanese laboratory mouse strains CS and NC. Here we show by backcross analysis that both Mtv-48 and -51 cosegregate with very slow deletion of T cells bearing V beta 2. The nucleotide sequences of the open reading frames in the 3' long terminal repeats of Mtv-48 and -51 were very similar to those of Mtv-DDO, mouse mammary tumor virus C4 [MMTV(C4)], and MMTV(BALB/cV), which encode V beta 2-specific superantigens. Furthermore, backcross female mice carrying Mtv-48 but not Mtv-51 were found to be able to produce milk-borne MMTV(CS), which can vigorously stimulate V beta 2-expressing T cells after local injection in vivo in an I-E-dependent manner. On the other hand, mice carrying Mtv-51 but not Mtv-48 could not produce such an MMTV in milk. The nucleotide sequences of MMTV(CS) open reading frame were completely matched with those of Mtv-48. These results indicate that the provirus Mtv-48 but not Mtv-51 is capable of producing a milk-borne virus of which the superantigen stimulates V beta 2-expressing T cells.
