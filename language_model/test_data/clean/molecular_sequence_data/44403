The protein sequence of ATP/CTP:tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (cca) from Sulfolobus shibatae was used to search open reading frames in the genome of Methanococcus jannaschii. Translations of two unidentified open reading frames showed significant sequence similarity to portions of the Sulfolobus cca protein. When the two open reading frames were joined together, the expanded open reading frame was similar in sequence to the entire Sulfolobus cca protein and displayed features of the active site signature sequence proposed for members of class I enzymes within the superfamily of nucleotidyltransferases (Yue et al., 1996, RNA 2, 895-908). A possible UUG start codon was identified based on significant sequence similarity of the resulting amino-terminal region to that of Sulfolobus, and on a six-base complementarity between an adjacent upstream sequence and Methanococcus 16S rRNA.
