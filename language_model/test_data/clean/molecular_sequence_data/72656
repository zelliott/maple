The tomato mutant chloronerva exhibits a defect in iron-uptake regulation. Despite high apoplastic and symplastic iron concentrations, the mutant shows characteristic symptoms of iron deficiency. Using a subtractive-hybridisation approach, we have screened for cDNA clones specific for genes with altered expression in wild-type versus mutant root tissue. Based on this clone collection, we have isolated and characterised a 2075-bp full-length cDNA encoding a lysyl-tRNA-synthetase-like protein. The corresponding gene is localised as a single copy on chromosome 10. Its expression is strongly induced by changes in the iron status of the plant. This iron-dependent regulation is superimposed upon a strict root specificity of gene expression. Possible functions of the gene product other than in protein biosynthesis will be discussed.
