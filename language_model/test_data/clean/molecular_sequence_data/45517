The cysteine-rich N and C-terminal domains of minicollagen-1 from Hydra nematocysts fold with excesses of oxidized/reduced glutathione (10:1) into globular structures with distinct cystine frameworks despite their identical cysteine sequence pattern. An additional main difference is the cis conformation of a conserved proline residue in the N-terminal and the trans conformation of this residue in the C-terminal domain. Comparative analysis of the oxidative folding revealed for the C-terminal domain a fast and highly cooperative formation of a single disulfide isomer. Conversely, oxidation of the N-terminal domain proceeds mainly via an intermediate that results from the fast quasi-stochastic disulfide formation according to the proximity rule. The rate of conversion of the bead-like isomer into the globular end-product is largely dominated by the trans-to-cis isomerization of the critical proline residue as well assessed by its replacement with (4R)- and (4S)-fluoroproline known to exhibit distinct propensities for the trans and cis conformation, respectively. Independently, whether the trans or cis conformation is favored by these substitutions, both analogues retain sufficient sequence-encoded information to fold almost quantitatively into the identical cystine framework and thus spatial structure of the parent peptide with the critical proline residue as cis isomer, but at rates significantly lower for the (4R) than for the (4S)-fluoroproline analogue. Correspondingly, other sequence-encoded structural elements have to act as a driving force for these unidirectional folding pathways despite the rather simple sequence composition consisting only of aliphatic residues, some proline and only one aromatic residue (tyrosine) in the core parts of the C and N-terminal domains. The two cysteine-rich domains of minicollagen-1 may well represent ideal targets for ab initio structure calculations in order to learn more about the elementary information encoded in such primordial molecules.
