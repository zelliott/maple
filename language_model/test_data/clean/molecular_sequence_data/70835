The centrifugation-facilitated inoculation method was used to test 51 human and non-human cell lines for ability to support HCV replication. As determined by nested RT-PCR, one fifth of the cell lines tested were virus positive 15 days post inoculation suggesting that the centrifugation-facilitated inoculation is an efficient method for cell infection with HCV. However, virus production by infected cultures remained of low grade, thus showing that the unknown factors which limit HCV replication in vitro are not overcome by the procedure.
