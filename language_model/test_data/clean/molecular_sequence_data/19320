A Gram-negative, rod-shaped, Flavobacterium-like bacterial strain, DS-20(T), was isolated from soil from the island of Dokdo, Korea, and subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. Strain DS-20(T) grew optimally at pH 6.5-7.0 and 25 degrees C. It contained MK-6 as the predominant menaquinone and iso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH and iso-C(17 : 1)omega9c as the major fatty acids. The DNA G+C content was 38.2 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain DS-20(T) belonged to the genus Flavobacterium. Levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strain DS-20(T) and the type strains of recognized Flavobacterium species were below 94.9 %. Strain DS-20(T) differed from phylogenetically related Flavobacterium species in several phenotypic characteristics. On the basis of its phenotypic and phylogenetic distinctiveness, strain DS-20(T) was classified in the genus Flavobacterium as representing a novel species, for which the name Flavobacterium terrigena sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is DS-20(T) (=KCTC 12761(T)=DSM 17934(T)).
