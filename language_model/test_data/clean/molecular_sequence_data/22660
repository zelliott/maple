The SAM domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae post-transcriptional regulator Vts1 has a high affinity towards RNA hairpins containing a CUGGC pentaloop. We present the 1.6 Angstroms X-ray crystal structure of the Vts1 SAM domain in its unliganded state, and the NMR solution structure of this domain in its RNA-bound state. Both structures reveal a canonical five helix SAM domain flanked by additional secondary structural elements at the N and C termini. The two structures are essentially identical, implying that no major structural rearrangements occur upon RNA binding. Amide chemical shift changes map the RNA-binding site to a shallow, basic patch at the junction of helix alpha5 and the loop connecting helices alpha1 and alpha2.
