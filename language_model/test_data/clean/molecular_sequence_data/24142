To establish a system to study differentiation therapy drugs, we used the androgen-independent human prostate PC-3 tumor cell line as a target and mycophenolic acid (MPA), tiazofurin, or ribavirin, which are inhibitors of IMP dehydrogenase, as inducers. These inhibitors evoked replication arrest, caused an increase in cell size, and triggered vacuolization of the cytoplasm. By Northern and Western blotting and immunostaining, we demonstrated MPA-induced expression of 12 proteins reported to reside in prostasomes, organelles released by secretory luminal prostate cells. Additional MPA-induced proteins were identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Among these was keratin 17, a prostate cell differentiation marker. By Northern blotting, we also demonstrated the constitutive expression of keratins 8 and 18 and induced expression of keratin 19, three other prostate cell differentiation markers. In addition, we established that cells were committed to differentiate after the 2nd day of MPA treatment using guanosine, which can abrogate the effects of MPA. Based on the expression patterns of prostasomal proteins and keratins and the presence of tentative secretory vacuoles, we hypothesize that IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors induce androgen-independent PC-3 cells to mature into cells with a phenotype that resembles normal prostate luminal cells, but at their intermediate state of differentiation.
