Epoxide hydrolase from Agrobacterium radiobacter catalyzes the hydrolysis of epoxides to their diols via an alkyl-enzyme intermediate. The recently solved X-ray structure of the enzyme shows that two tyrosine residues (Tyr152 and Tyr215) are positioned close to the nucleophile Asp107 in such a way that they can serve as proton donor in the alkylation reaction step. The role of these tyrosines, which are conserved in other epoxide hydrolases, was studied by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation of Tyr215 to Phe and Ala and mutation of Tyr152 to Phe resulted in mutant enzymes of which the k(cat) values were only 2-4-fold lower than for wild-type enzyme, whereas the K(m) values for the (R)-enantiomers of styrene oxide and p-nitrostyrene oxide were 3 orders of magnitude higher than the K(m) values of wild-type enzyme, showing that the alkylation half-reaction is severely affected by the mutations. Pre-steady-state analysis of the conversion of (R)-styrene oxide by the Y215F and Y215A mutants showed that the 1000-fold elevated K(m) values were mainly caused by a 15-40-fold increase in K(S) and a 20-fold reduction in the rate of alkylation. The rates of hydrolysis of the alkyl-enzyme intermediates were not significantly affected by the mutations. The double mutant Y152F+Y215F showed only a low residual activity for (R)-styrene oxide, with a k(cat)/K(m) value that was 6 orders of magnitude lower than with wild-type enzyme and 3 orders of magnitude lower than with the single tyrosine mutants. This indicates that the effects of the mutations were cumulative. The side chain of Gln134 is positioned in the active site of the X-ray structure of epoxide hydrolase. Mutation of Gln134 to Ala resulted in an active enzyme with slightly altered steady-state kinetic parameters compared to wild-type enzyme, indicating that Gln134 is not essential for catalysis and that the side chain of Gln134 mimics bound substrate. Based upon this observation, the inhibitory potential of various unsubstituted amides was tested, resulting in the identification of phenylacetamide as a competitive inhibitor with an inhibition constant of 30 microM.
