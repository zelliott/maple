Two clinical cases of infection with Ralstonia mannitolilytica are described: a recurrent meningitis on an implanted intraventricular catheter and an infected hemoperitoneum as a complication of a cholangiocarcinoma. The strains were first misidentified as Pseudomonas fluorescens and Burkholderia cepacia. Further testing lead to the identification as Ralstonia pickettii biovar 3/"thomasii," which was recently shown to represent a separate species, R. mannitolilytica (List editor N. Weiss, Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 51:795-796, 2001), originally described as R. mannitolytica (De Baere et al., Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 51:547-558, 2001). R. mannitolilytica can be distinguished from all described Ralstonia species by its acidification of D-arabitol and mannitol and by its lack of nitrate reduction and of alkalinization of tartrate. In order to determine the true prevalence of infections with this species, colistin-resistant "P. fluorescens" strains and strains growing on B. cepacia selective medium deserve further attention.
