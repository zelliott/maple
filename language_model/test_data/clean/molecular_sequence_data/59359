The great advances in human healthcare that are presaged by the Human Genome Project can be realized by the pharmaceutical industry. A prerequisite for this will be the successful integration of bioinformatics into most aspects of drug discovery. Although, from a scientific viewpoint, this is not a difficult problem, there are formidable technological obstacles. Once these are overcome, rapid progress can be expected.
