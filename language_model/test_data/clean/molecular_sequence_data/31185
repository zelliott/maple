An octathymidylate covalently linked via its 3'-end to an acridine derivative inhibited the cytopathic effect of Simian Virus SV40 on CV-1 cells in culture. Control experiments revealed that this effect was virus-specific and did not arise as a result of oligonucleotide degradation by nucleases. A photoactive probe was covalently attached to the 5'-end of the oligonucleotide-acridine conjugate. Upon UV-irradiation, photocrosslinking was shown to occur at the A. T-rich region within the viral origin of replication. A local triple helix can form at moderate salt concentrations with two octathymidylate-acridine conjugates bound to the octaadenylate sequence. Alternatively the octathymidylate-acridine conjugate can bind to the major groove of duplex DNA forming a local triple helix. Different mechanisms are discussed to explain the inhibition of viral DNA replication.
