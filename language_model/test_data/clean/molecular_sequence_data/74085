Nucleotide sequences of the VP2 gene of eight infectious bursal disease viruses isolated from vaccinated chicken flocks in the northeast of China were determined. The sequence analysis showed that all of the isolates were also characterized by the vvIBDV conserved amino acid residues: 222A, 256I, 294I, and 299S. Four of them had one amino acid change (D-->N) at position 212 in VP2 major hydrophilic peak A, while two of the four isolates had another one (A-->V) at position 321 in major hydrophilic peak B. The other isolates were similar to the UK661 strain. Our findings demonstrated that the vvlBDV strains in the northeast of China could be diverse.
