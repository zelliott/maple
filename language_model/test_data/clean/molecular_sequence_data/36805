To examine the effect of the 5'-leader region of mRNAs in regulating translation efficiency, chimeric mRNAs which have various sequences of the 5'-leader were synthesized by the SP6 in vitro transcription system, and translated in the wheat germ in vitro translation system. Translation efficiency was affected by the length of the 5'-leader and the number of the codon A-U-G at the translation initiation site.
