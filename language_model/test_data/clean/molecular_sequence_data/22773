Three types of GRP (glycine-rich proteins) cDNAs were identified in the EST database of Bombyx mori. These came from 21 ESTs in the W3-stage wing disc EST library. We named them BmGRP1, BmGRP2 and BmGRP3. BmGRP1 and BmGRP2 had 57% identity in deduced amino acid sequences. Expression of all BmGRPs was observed in the epidermis at the fourth molting stage, and in the wing at pupation and mid-pupal stage. It is suggested that BmGRPs contribute to larval, pupal and adult cuticles together with other cuticle proteins. Transcripts of BmGRP2 increased after 7 days of pupal stage. BmGRP2 is suggested to construct adult trachea in the wing. Hormonal response of BmGRPs was compared with that of another group of cuticular protein genes, BMWCPs. BmGRPs were induced by a pulse of 20E. Induction of BmGRP3 was observed in W1 wing discs in the presence of JHA which was added with 20E, whereas that of BMWCP2 was inhibited in the presence of JHA. Induction of BmGRPs was observed in the wing discs of V3 and W1 stages, while that of BMWCP2 was not observed in the V3 wing discs. These differences between BMWCPs and BmGRPs in response to hormones at different developmental stages are discussed.
