An Achromobacter xylosoxidans strain from the Tripoli central hospital produced a unique metallo-β-lactamase, designated TMB-1, which is related to DIM-1 (62%) and GIM-1 (51%). bla(TMB-1) was embedded in a class 1 integron and located on the chromosome. The TMB-1 β-lactamase has lower k(cat) values than both DIM-1 and GIM-1 with cephalosporins and carbapenems. The K(m) values were more similar to those of GIM-1 than those of DIM-1, with the overall k(cat)/K(m) values being lower than those for GIM-1 and DIM-1.
