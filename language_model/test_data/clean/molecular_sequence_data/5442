Developmental and seasonal changes in the production of androgens and estrogens seem to control sex-specific differentiation and seasonal changes in sexual behaviors such as singing of songbirds. These steroids affect the brain by binding to intracellular located receptors. Here we analyze whether the expression of androgen receptors (AR) and estrogen receptors (ER) is a limiting factor for differentiation of the vocal pattern and the vocal control system of zebra finches and canaries. AR and ER are localised in the brain using in situ hybridizations with cRNA probes of the AR and ER of the zebra finch. AR are widely expressed in the vocal control system and allow androgen-dependent alterations of the development and function of most vocal control areas. The expression of AR in some vocal control areas such as NIF, DLM, and AVT differs between individuals. This individual variability suggests genetic differences or transient steroid-independent expression of AR. ER are found only in the HVC and thus restrict estrogen-dependent developmental and functional changes of the singing to the HVC area. AR- and ER-mRNA expression per cell in the HVC of adult canaries undergoes seasonal changes so that ER are higher expressed from fall to the early breeding season. During ontogeny, ER start to occur in the zebra finch HVC at posthatching day 15 and in the canary HVC at posthatching day 30. As the HVC is already sexual dimorphic in size at these times, HVC-based estrogen-ER-dependent mechanisms seem not to be important for the initial sexual dimorphic development of the HVC.
