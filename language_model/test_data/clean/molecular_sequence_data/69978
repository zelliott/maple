The expanded gene was first identified by a spontaneous mutation that causes broad wings. We have identified an enhancer-trap insertion within expanded and used it to generate additional mutations, including one null allele. expanded is an essential gene, necessary for proper growth control of imaginal discs and, when mutant, causes either hyperplasia or degeneration depending on the disc. Wing overgrowth in expanded hypermorphs is limited to specific regions along the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axis. expanded encodes a novel 1429 amino acid protein that is localized to the apical surface of disc cells and contains three potential SH3-binding sites. Together, these observations suggest that the Expanded protein engages in protein-protein interactions regulating cell proliferation in discs.
