The detection of antibody to the hepatitis C virus C100-3 antigen from the nonstructural region (NS3/NS4) of the viral genome was the first useful marker developed to detect past or potentially active infection with the hepatitis C virus. A systematic epitope survey of the nonstructural region has uncovered other immunogenic antigens. In order to assess the possible diagnostic utility of these antigens, their reactivity against a limited panel of sera from patients with chronic liver disease due to hepatitis C virus and other etiologies was tested. Antibody assays were performed using an immunoblot plaque assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In a study of 16 C100-3-reactive individuals, all 16 patients were reactive using the plaque assay for the NS3 3' (409-1-1) and NS3 5' (C33u). In this same group of patients, antibodies by ELISA were reactive to NS3 3' in 12 of 16 patients (75%), NS3 5' in 15 of 16 patients (93%), and a capsid antigen (NC450) in 14 of 16 patients. In a group of five patients who were diagnosed with cryptogenic liver disease (C100-3 negative), 4 of 5 patients were reactive for antibody to all of the above epitopes. In a survey of 23 patients with other forms of chronic liver disease (nonviral liver disease, hepatitis B, alcoholic liver disease, cholestatic liver disease, and autoimmune hepatitis), only 1 of 23 patients was reactive for antibody to the C100-3 and 4 of 23 patients were reactive for antibodies to structural and nonstructural regions of the virus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
