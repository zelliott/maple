We have isolated and characterized Mpp10p, a novel protein component of the U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The MPP10 protein was first identified in human cells by its reactivity with an antibody that recognizes specific sites of mitotic phosphorylation. To study the functional role of MPP10 in pre-rRNA processing, we identified the yeast protein by performing a GenBank search. The yeast Mpp10p homolog is 30% identical to the human protein over its length. Antibodies to the purified yeast protein recognize a 110-kDa polypeptide in yeast extracts and immunoprecipitate the U3 snoRNA, indicating that Mpp10p is a specific protein component of the U3 snoRNP in yeast. As a first step in the genetic analysis of Mpp10p function, diploid S. cerevisiae cells were transformed with a null allele. Sporulation and tetrad analysis indicate that MPP10 is an essential gene. A strain was constructed where Mpp10p is expressed from a galactose-inducible, glucose- repressible promoter. After depletion of Mpp10p by growth in glucose, cell growth is arrested and levels of 18S and its 20S precursor are reduced or absent while the 23S and 35S precursors accumulate. This pattern of accumulation of rRNA precursors suggests that Mpp10p is required for cleavage at sites A0, A1, and A2. Pulse-chase analysis of newly synthesized pre-rRNAs in Mpp10p-depleted yeast confirms that little mature 18S rRNA formed. These results reveal a novel protein essential for ribosome biogenesis and further elucidate the composition of the U3 snoRNP.
