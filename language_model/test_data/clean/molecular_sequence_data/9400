We report an efficient approach for the chemical synthesis of Rhesus Î¸-defensin-1 (RTD-1) using Fmoc-based solid-phase peptide synthesis in combination with an intramolecular version of native chemical ligation. The corresponding linear thioester precursor was cyclized and folded in a one-pot reaction using reduced glutathione. The reaction was extremely efficiently yielding natively folded RTD-1 with minimal or no purification at all. This approach is fully compatible with the high throughput production of chemical libraries using this peptide scaffold.
