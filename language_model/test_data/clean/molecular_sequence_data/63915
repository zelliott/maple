Peptide array consisting of hundreds of peptides spatially addressed and synthesized on a cellulose membrane support was used to screen ligand-inhibitory peptides. As a model, angiotensin II (Ang II), a significant peptide related to the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, was chosen as the target ligand. Peptide arrays covering the Ang II receptor type 1 sequence were prepared, and peptide domains with high affinity to the Ang II fluorescein conjugate were investigated. The peptide (VVIVIY) within the first transmembrane region exhibited the highest affinity to Ang II. The synthesized soluble VVIVIY peptide had an 84% inhibitory effect on Ang II-induced aorta contraction. These results indicate that our screening strategy utilizing peptide array is an effective approach for the peptide drug development.
