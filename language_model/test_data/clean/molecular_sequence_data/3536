Death effector domain-containing proteins are involved in important cellular processes such as death-receptor induced apoptosis, NF-kappaB activation and ERK activation. Here we report the identification of a novel nuclear DED-containing protein, FLAME-3. FLAME-3 shares significant sequence (46.6% identical) and structural homology to another DED-containing protein, DEDD. FLAME-3 interacts with DEDD and c-FLIP (FLAME-1) but not with the other DED-containing proteins FADD, caspase-8 or caspase-10. FLAME-3 translocates to, and sequesters c-FLIP in the nucleus upon overexpression in human cell lines. Using the yeast two-hybrid system to identify DEDD-interacting proteins, the TFIIIC102 subunit of human transcription factor TFIIIC was identified as a DEDD- and FLAME-3-specific interacting protein. Co-expression of either DEDD or FLAME-3 with hTFIIIC102 in MCF-7 cells induces the translocation from the cytoplasm and sequestration of hTFIIIC102 in the nucleus, indicating that DEDD and FLAME-3 form strong heterocomplexes with hTFIIIC102 and might be important regulators of the activity of the hTFIIIC transcriptional complex. Consistent with this, overexpression of DEDD or FLAME-3 in 293 cells inhibited the expression of a luciferase-reporter gene under the control of the NF-kappaB promoter. Our data provide the first direct evidence for the involvement of DED-containing proteins in the regulation of components of the general transcription machinery in the nucleus.
