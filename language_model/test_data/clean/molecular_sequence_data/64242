Isolates of Fasciola (Platyhelminthes: Trematoda: Digenea) from different host species and geographical locations in Mainland China were characterised genetically. The second internal transcribed spacer (ITS-2) of nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) was amplified from individual trematodes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the representative amplicons were cloned and sequenced. The length of the ITS-2 sequences was 361-362bp for all Chinese Fasciola specimens sequenced. While there was no variation in length or composition of the ITS-2 sequences among multiple specimens from France, Sichuan and Guangxi, sequence difference of 1.7% (6/362) was detected between specimens from France and Sichuan, and those from Guangxi. Based on ITS-2 sequence data, it was concluded that the Fasciola from Sichuan represented Fasciola hepatica, the one from Guangxi represented Fasciola gigantica and the one from sheep from Heilongjiang may represent an "intermediate genotype", as its ITS-2 sequences were unique in that two different ITS-2 sequences exist in the rDNA array within a single Fasciola worm. One of the sequences is identical to that of F. hepatica, and the other is almost identical to that of F. gigantica in that nucleotides at five of the six polymorphic positions represent F. gigantica. This microheterogeneity is possibly due to sequence polymorphism among copies of the ITS-2 array within the same worm. Based on the sequence differences, a PCR-linked restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay was established for the unequivocal delineation of the Fasciola spp. from Mainland China using restriction endonuclease Hsp92II or RcaI. This assay should provide a valuable tool for the molecular identification and for studying the ecology and population genetic structures of Fasciola spp. from Mainland China and elsewhere.
