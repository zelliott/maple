We have isolated a Candida albicans gene, coding for a putative peroxisomal carnitine acetyl transferase (CTN) protein, which is up-regulated during macrophage infection. In the present study, we describe the disruption of CTN3 gene (previously called CAT3) to gain insight into its potential role during infection. The ability of disrupted Candida mutants to filament was affected by several solid media. Northern blot analysis revealed that CTN3 gene may be involved not only in conditions of cell starvation but also during the process of germination. In agreement with the putative peroxisomal localization of the corresponding protein, we observed a strong glucose repression of CTN3 gene and, on the contrary, high level of transcription by carbon sources that induce the formation of peroxisomal proteins. Furthermore, we showed the existence of two additional C. albicans CTN encoding sequences, which are also induced during macrophage infection.
