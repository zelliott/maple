Suppressors of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins play important roles in the negative regulation of cytokine signal. We first searched for polymorphisms in SOCS-1, SOCS-3 and SOCS-5 genes, and examined the association of the polymorphisms with type 1 diabetes (T1D). As a result, we did not find any significant associations between SOCS genes and T1D.
