Two Kluyveromyces lactis genes encoding acetyl co-enzyme A synthetase isoenzymes were isolated. One we named KlACS1, as it has high similarity to the ACS1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The other gene, KlACS2, showed more similarity to S. cerevisiae ACS2 than to KlACS1 or ScACS1. This suggests that divergence of the two isogenes occurred before the evolutionary separation of the species and that the different functions have been conserved. In line with this idea is the regulation of transcription of the genes. The mode of regulation appeared to be maintained between ScACS1 and KlACS1 and between ScACS2 and KlACS2. The KlACS1 transcript was absent in glucose-grown cells, whereas transcription levels in ethanol- and acetate-grown cells were high. Disruption of the KlACS1 gene did not result in growth defects on glucose or ethanol. The growth rate on acetate, however, was reduced by a factor of two. KlACS2 was expressed at similar levels during growth on glucose and acetate, whereas expression on ethanol was slightly higher. A null mutant in this gene showed a reduced growth rate on all three carbon sources. Taken together, these data suggest that KlACS2 is used during growth on glucose and that KlACS1 is most dominant during growth on acetate. Strains in which both ACS genes are deleted could only be retrieved when a plasmid containing the ACS2 gene was present, suggesting that the double mutant is lethal. Tetrad analysis confirmed that non-viable spores with a deduced Klacs1Klacs2 genotype germinated but could not divide further. It therefore appears that, as in S. cerevisiae, the pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass formed by the enzymes pyruvate decarboxylase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and acetyl co-enzyme A synthetase is essential for growth. These results are in apparent contradiction with the growth on glucose of a strain with a disruption in the only structural pyruvate decarboxylase gene of K. lactis. Residual enzyme activity might, however, account for this discrepancy, or Acs fulfils an additional as yet unknown function, separate from its enzymatic activity.
