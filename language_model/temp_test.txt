Until 20 years ago the only chronic viral diseases known were those considered to be confined to the nervous system
 As a result of recent advances in epidemiology, molecular biology and immunology, new viral diseases have been recognized and their clinical features and pathogenesis elucidated
 Chronic disease may result from infection with the hepatitis B and D viruses and whatever agent or agents cause hepatitis non-A, non-B, the herpesviruses, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and human T-lymphotropic virus type III
 These diseases have common features, including long-term or even lifetime asymptomatic carriage, viremia, with virus free in the plasma or attached to circulating mononuclear cells, presence of virus in body secretions, irreversible tissue injury in target organs and oncogenic potential
 New information on these diseases is reviewed
 Other chronic diseases for which the cause is currently unknown may eventually prove to be due to viral infection
 In addition, vaccines may be developed for prophylaxis of some chronic viral diseases and associated malignant diseases
