59.61 68.76 A: uh [mn] two thousand and one yeah yeah i've been there a bunch of times it's amazing actually actually how much [noise] sh- shit has changed 

62.37 63.19 B: yeah 

65.60 66.39 B: yeah 

68.61 70.44 B: yeah it's really weird do 

70.52 71.73 A: (( [noise] um )) 

70.54 72.03 B: you feel safer though 

72.48 74.21 A: [noise] come again 

73.76 77.95 B: (( do you feel safer like with all the security or do you think it's just a hassle )) 

76.33 84.68 A: [noise] um hm [noise] with the security i i mean it never hurts 

84.35 85.77 B: (( yeah it never hurts )) 

85.41 86.63 A: (( um )) 

86.16 90.24 B: unless you miss a flight which i almost did actually which kinda bothered me one time 

88.64 90.51 A: (( [noise] because i )) 

90.60 94.12 A: yeah well you have to prepare for that come a little earlier 

93.47 98.84 B: pardon oh no i got there too earl- two hours before my domestic flight and that's ridiculous 

96.88 101.35 A: [noise] [noise] and you still missed the flight [noise] 

98.96 99.74 B: (( you know )) 

100.43 107.30 B: no i almost missed it i the the they were like holding it for like five minutes and like we got there right at the very end 

106.33 108.78 A: (( [noise] why what was what was uh they're just )) 

108.64 117.83 B: well like uh i put my uh we were right at the last security check and like i had i had this little like shower bag thing and i had a a nail nail cutter in it a nail file 

109.31 110.19 A: (( [mn] just [noise] )) 

112.48 113.21 A: (( mm )) 

117.46 119.03 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

118.33 127.38 B: and so inside a side zipper pocket right and the lady was like i'm going to have to take it and i'm like all right and she's looking for it and looking for it and like i'm standing on the side and i didn't know if she was still looking for it 

127.47 140.07 B: and uh she's like you know i can't let you go and i'm like it's right there and then she's like i'm going to have to keep looking and then she finds like some other stuff and she starts commenting on it and i'm just like it's none of your business like why are you commenting on that stuff 

136.01 137.34 A: (( [noise] )) 

139.68 141.35 A: (( [noise] [noise] [laughter] )) 

140.23 143.48 B: and then luckily like right behind me was this guy who um 

143.54 147.29 B: he was getting really tested um because they made him take off his shoes and stuff 

147.20 148.37 A: (( [noise] right )) 

147.68 152.52 B: so uh he like he smacked his shoes down on the guy's hands who he was giving them to 

152.23 153.47 A: (( [noise] right )) 

152.68 161.64 B: so the lady turned her attention towards him and let me go and this guy was this guy was really pissed he was like what the fuck are they i'm going to miss my flight blah blah [mn] 

156.31 157.32 A: [laughter] 

161.63 163.42 A: right 

162.29 164.60 B: (( so i was just lucky i mean that that was like )) 

164.63 171.59 B: that was uh i guess the may after that september but then i went last year again and they were fine there was no problem flying [mn] 

171.93 173.80 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah um )) 

173.89 174.52 A: (( [mn] )) 

174.56 183.48 A: trying to think when when it sort of first happened actually it was really i think intense i mean it it was a crazy atmosphere in the airports and uh 

177.87 178.76 B: yeah 

179.71 181.21 B: yeah yeah definitely 

182.75 185.36 B: i think everybody welcomed the security right then 

185.04 188.04 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] and i still [noise] )) 

185.67 186.53 B: (( you know )) 

186.54 188.56 B: but it's just becoming a nuisance right now 

188.90 191.53 A: but still uh i i feel uh 

192.03 197.85 A: i don't know i i i put up with it because you know it's a small price to pay [noise] [noise] 

196.91 202.27 B: no it definitely is i think it's a good thing that they're still like enforcing the security 'cause like in the past like you know 

202.11 212.27 B: things like this happen and then you know security is heightened at that time but then it lessens over time you know it's just it's sad but it takes something of this scale like to make things change 

205.77 206.65 A: right 

207.67 208.65 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

212.05 220.18 A: [noise] [noise] yeah it's true and uh and people unfortunately like let their guard down like you say uh after a while and uh that's when you know we 

212.64 213.45 B: (( you know )) 

216.50 217.40 B: yeah 

218.47 221.30 B: (( i don't think they're going to let their guard down anymore [laughter] )) 

220.66 229.39 A: yeah and and that's when like things happen again and uh hopefully like i don't know it'll stay constant in some respects [noise] and we'll just get [noise] 

223.95 224.87 B: (( yes )) 

227.94 233.20 B: [noise] but i think i think no matter what like terrorists are going to find a way like to get around things you know 

233.04 234.94 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

234.18 240.04 B: i mean no matter how tight security is there's always going to be a little loophole and someone's going to find a way to exploit it or 

239.56 243.40 A: [noise] [noise] yeah unfortunately that's just the way our world is and uh 

242.34 243.71 B: yeah definitely 

243.67 253.87 A: uh it's just it's a shame in that but i don't know that's a whole bigger issue again 

246.93 248.06 B: (( yeah definitely )) 

248.30 249.03 B: (( definitely )) 

252.72 253.62 B: yeah 

253.93 260.96 A: uh i i don't know yeah i'm for uh airport security i'm always any any time that i've ever been through uh 

260.97 274.19 A: and i've been held up like you said and and similar things have happened to me i i never like really missed the actually one thing that did happen though after uh that whole sit situation i had uh this uh african stool 

262.76 263.71 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

273.36 274.15 B: uh-huh 

274.02 278.93 A: it's ca- carved from one piece of wood it's really nice called a bugah 

276.67 277.44 B: uh-huh 

279.10 293.72 A: and uh and i was in the airport and before you know any of this happened you know you could take anything on a plane right and uh unfortunately i wasn't really thinking about it but the the bugah 

282.33 283.20 B: yeah 

286.48 287.60 B: yeah yeah 

293.78 301.56 A: uh it's like almost could be a weapon it's like it's really strong piece of wood and uh i was going to take it on the plane 

296.13 297.14 B: (( [mn] uh-huh )) 

298.00 298.76 B: uh-huh 

301.34 313.11 A: so i didn't think i needed to check in or anything and i got to the front [mn] they let me past you know like all the way up to security and security was like you can't take this and i had like 

307.50 308.66 B: yeah 

313.05 315.51 A: [cough] ten minutes to get on the plane and 

314.67 315.80 B: jeeze 

315.44 326.61 A: i'm like well what am i supposed to do with it and there there was no time to check it and and if i threw it in something like they they weren't going to like perhaps give me a box or something like that but it would have been broken but 

318.21 319.14 B: right 

325.67 327.03 B: (( right right mhm )) 

326.40 334.08 A: i don't think they even gave me that option they were just like well you have to leave it and i'm like god and uh 

327.78 328.95 B: (( mm )) 

334.34 342.31 A: i didn't know what to do so i was like talking to them about like a lost and found if they would like hold it for me and like i can like have someone pick it up 

341.48 345.01 B: (( mm )) 

342.15 350.14 A: but they wouldn't do anything but ev- eventually what i just had to do was i just had to leave it and i lost it because of that which sucks [laughter] 

348.80 354.84 B: that sucks man that sucks [laughter] did you ever write to the airport to like try and reclaim it or anything or not 

350.74 352.47 A: yeah it does it 

354.45 359.34 A: no they they wouldn't hold it or anything they would they were like very unaccommodating 

358.05 359.82 B: they just threw it out right on the spot 

359.91 361.31 A: yeah they're just like 

361.32 375.21 A: sir you can't take it and my plane was like i i eventually got to the gate and they're like waiting for me at the gate and i just had to like run i was running and shit and the but whenever you know like like i said i and and still i think it's a small price to pay 

374.87 376.00 B: definitely yeah 

375.22 383.48 A: but i mean it's just a material thing that uh i liked actually and uh [laughter] haven't found one since but uh 

382.65 383.61 B: that's true 

383.78 386.76 A: (( but uh [cough] i was i was )) 

385.13 395.53 B: i mean they have to like they have to draw a line between like okay a stool and like a knife you know they can't like classify everything as a weapon and i think i think with the increased security like with the like you know the 

390.03 390.89 A: yeah 

391.93 393.13 A: (( well it [noise] [noise] )) 

395.48 400.42 B: the new door that they have for like airplanes and stuff like that like it's impossible for people to get in 

400.54 401.35 B: (( you know )) 

401.27 403.70 A: (( uh hm [mn] )) 

403.85 407.60 A: almost [laughter] there's always a way though there's always some like 

406.62 409.73 B: oh yeah that's what i was saying there's always a way but like [laughter] 

408.98 416.24 A: there's always that way when you hear on the news like oh and they're like you're just like it's so simple and then like the next you know like that won't happen again but it already did happen 

415.13 417.41 B: yeah yeah it did happen right 

416.74 418.68 A: but uh 

417.68 423.68 B: but i mean they have to understand that someone with a stool's not going to be like all right i'm hijacking a plane with my stool you know 

421.82 422.84 A: well 

422.95 425.63 A: (( to be honest with you uh [noise] one of the legs )) 

425.89 430.28 A: was held in by like a nail i guess for support 

427.93 428.71 B: (( okay )) 

429.16 433.22 B: mm right 

430.41 433.07 A: like a big long metal nail 

433.11 443.71 A: which like i mean i don't know just a metal piece a metal rod but it was like connecting one of the legs uh just to keep it intact and uh 

439.85 440.60 B: (( yeah )) 

442.68 443.52 B: right 

443.68 456.39 A: i guess they looked at that and they might and that how heavy and like strong this thing was and they they might have looked at me like you know this might be a a covert weapon or why why even risk it i don't know 

448.69 449.57 B: right 

453.40 454.41 B: right right 

455.69 464.40 B: i don't know that that's just weird 'cause um how do you draw the line like say i have a cologne bottle right say i break the bottle then i have a a piece of sharp sharp glass isn't that a weapon you know 

464.30 465.34 A: [noise] sure [noise] 

465.12 467.41 B: like something like that that's just like how do you 

466.18 468.88 A: (( that's actually not a bad idea )) 

468.34 471.18 B: but i didn't say that for the record [laughter] 

470.71 476.93 A: [laughter] no i'm just saying that's like that's uh a thing to think about they shouldn't even have glass bottles on planes 

472.17 473.82 B: okay yeah 

476.47 478.66 B: yeah they shouldn't i mean they they should just 

478.99 489.26 B: i don't know but then how do you get around that like you know and then one day they're going to be oh dental floss can be used as a weapon [laughter] you know it's just like what what the hell [laughter] so 

486.08 487.93 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

488.18 493.71 A: i you know the uh and maybe the best thing is to have good security on the plane 

493.29 495.33 B: (( yeah i think that's what they should just do have )) 

494.16 499.83 A: so whenever someone does dental floss you can you know someone who has like a a scissor to cut 

495.48 496.49 B: (( it on the plane )) 

498.55 505.69 B: but the the bad thing is that with that is that you know what if they put someone on a plane with a gun [laughter] you know some security person 

505.44 506.85 A: (( it right )) 

505.99 510.47 B: and then somehow someone on that plane gets the gun then they have more power than they ever did before you know 

509.62 512.17 A: [noise] yeah it's true 

512.15 513.07 B: so 

512.53 513.59 A: uh 

513.14 519.56 B: i don't think that's necessarily the best idea i mean so globally they have those federal marshalls which are on planes at times like random flights 

515.06 516.10 A: (( yeah i do )) 

519.19 521.20 A: yeah 

520.23 522.54 B: but uh i don't know whatever happened to that program 

522.49 525.51 A: (( well yeah i remember when they were talking earlier when when )) 

525.36 528.93 A: right after it happened that that uh guns on planes 

528.46 529.53 B: (( mhm yeah [mn] )) 

528.80 542.19 A: having people with guns on planes and i've always been like very gu- like really against that because like when you think about it that could be that's all you need he just got get the guy with the gun and like get the gun from him 

541.75 542.86 B: right right 

542.66 549.00 A: and there's no need for a gun on a plane anyhow because no one should be shooting guns in planes uh even at terrorists you know 

548.84 549.90 B: right that's true 

550.14 551.22 A: um 

551.36 555.74 A: so uh that that's one thing that i always been really against uh 

555.15 555.86 B: yeah 

556.18 570.87 A: i don't know it seems it always seemed like the stupidest [noise] idea to me and my roommate actually at the time he was so into it i didn't understand it he's like yeah yeah we they should get guns on the planes and uh kill all the terrorists and you know like 

567.00 568.00 B: (( [laughter] )) 

569.72 570.96 B: (( oh god )) 

570.70 583.06 A: i to me it was like a stupid thing like the you know the guy with the gun is is not paying attention for a second or or maybe he is and maybe just the the terrorist is like better at fighting and gets the gun from him then 

582.13 589.81 B: [noise] what if the terrorist like picks someone out and like starts holding them hostage and like put your gun down you know or give me your gun and then it's like oh shit what do you do you know 

586.81 587.69 A: (( the )) 

588.79 592.88 A: yeah yeah there's just no need for it but 

590.77 596.05 B: yeah exactly there's just that that can lead to too many complications and it's complicated enough as it is you know 

595.71 599.95 A: yeah and and even if the guy himself [noise] is shooting the gun at that terr- or at
