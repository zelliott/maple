18.33 19.49 B: um 

19.65 24.25 B: okay we're doing what do you call it strikes by professional athletes 

23.94 26.17 A: mhm yeah 

25.50 26.50 B: um 

26.96 33.08 B: let's see i just i did this the microphone cut off i was with somebody else but i'll start over um 

33.77 40.61 B: let's see what do you think about the um salaries that professional athletes receive in this country 

40.80 43.95 A: i didn't actually understand this topic fully i mean what do 

44.06 45.69 A: (( what what is it ah )) 

46.01 50.54 B: um basically it's it's dealing probably with um 

51.50 57.64 B: the salaries that like baseball players and basketball players and the n._b._a. and the um 

55.41 56.25 A: mhm 

57.38 58.84 A: yeah 

58.28 60.03 B: and all those leagues make 

59.79 60.65 A: uh-huh 

60.58 65.01 B: you know they all make like a million a year usually at least 

63.07 65.13 A: yeah yeah i'm sure 

65.12 75.70 B: and then they strike they go on strike for because of their ego usually their salaries like they go on strike sometimes there's another reason that they use in order to do so 

75.56 76.81 A: mhm yeah 

76.12 81.82 B: um that's the extent of it that i understand i'm not i'm not a huge sports person so 

81.57 83.66 A: (( [laughter] yeah me either )) 

83.51 85.27 B: no um 

85.57 89.23 B: but i can definitely say that i think um it's 

89.39 103.08 B: just like it's just like celebrities um these these people that make you know millions of dollars a year for doing a job that um while in the spotlight isn't necessarily any harder than 

96.13 97.61 A: yeah mhm 

103.27 110.59 B: what me or you are doing but they're you know they're they're the value of their careers is just like through the roof 

104.87 106.02 A: yeah 

110.55 111.50 A: yeah 

110.59 122.56 B: and then they have the nerve to um either demand more money or demand more rights or demand anything you know what i mean when you're making that much money i feel like your demands should be cut overall you know 

113.01 114.12 A: mhm 

116.73 117.59 A: yeah 

118.98 120.20 A: yeah 

122.53 135.71 A: yeah that's right i think it that ah it's just ah that's the difficulty i mean they've it's not that they are more skilled but i mean they are skillful but it's more of celebrity values just just because the media 

135.54 150.05 A: i mean there are so many games like baseball and ah these ah these games are so famous now but other games there would be some other games but they're not famous so the media has not given them that much of value so it's just because of the people that they are getting so much money right 

149.91 154.16 A: because of the audience they're getting so much money so it's 

154.49 166.69 A: it's kind of unfair to those i mean if you if you if you go on strike if you say that i i demand so much of money and that's not fair to those who watch the game and right 

165.56 166.61 B: (( all right )) 

166.67 167.81 B: um 

168.60 172.63 B: yeah i where are you from am- um united states originally 

172.53 177.26 A: no i'm not from america i'm from a different country i'm from india actually 

176.64 186.80 B: um yeah i was just talking about the sports in different parts of the world um i don't know about india i don't know if what 

182.45 183.56 A: mhm 

185.98 190.08 A: ah we have a different game cricket you heard about 

189.36 191.08 B: okay yeah 

190.34 195.83 A: it ah it it's it's kind of it's more famous than football here [laughter] 

195.32 196.69 B: yeah 

196.05 198.83 A: it's kind of a passion there you know it's [laughter] 

198.54 199.82 B: yeah 

199.12 201.71 A: (( it has become a re- religion there )) 

201.77 207.69 A: no no matter what religion or order you are but everybody is a huge fan of cricket so 

207.19 211.99 B: yeah is it do they do you have huge gatherings for games and stuff out there 

210.88 213.67 A: yeah huge gatherings i mean 

213.54 215.43 B: you can make a lot of money at all 

215.17 228.62 A: yeah they they make a huge money but the thing is that ah the other games i mean ah other games like basketball these games are also played there but those guys who play basketball there they're not that famous because 

228.46 231.98 A: that game is not ah that much of of value there 

232.14 233.18 B: yeah 

233.01 242.66 A: so the players there are also skilled but i mean it's just that they're not getting that ah that much of a reputation that would have ah you know publicity so 

241.94 244.25 B: yeah um 

242.89 253.36 A: so that that that's why they're not making money so it's i think it's ah all this celebrity all these games there that is more dependent on the media what is more 

253.48 256.27 A: getting getting more value right 

255.89 257.17 B: right 

257.50 258.85 B: um 

258.55 266.40 A: like soccer is not all that famous here but if you go to say europe it it it's like everybody's crazy about it 

264.18 268.59 B: or south america yeah or mexico even 

269.13 270.01 A: yeah 

269.30 278.18 B: or or like hockey in canada if if you've been up to canada um they actually have like hockey players on their money [laughter] so 

278.13 291.66 B: it depends where you go but it seems like everywhere has this sort of i wouldn't have said problem because it's like it is a perfect example of a mis- um appropriation of wealth because 

290.13 292.30 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

291.77 292.67 B: i mean 

292.77 294.09 B: you know i i 

294.22 304.15 B: i'm not sports oriented but i could play sports you know what i mean and like i don't really i you know i work out i don't think it would be that hard to just devote your whole career 

304.07 316.10 B: to that i mean it is a game it is i mean it's supposed to be fun i suppose to the the degree to which they take it seriously makes it you know something else but it's still 

305.03 306.03 A: yeah 

306.28 307.50 A: yeah 

316.06 320.69 B: just baseball or it's still just soccer it's still just cricket you know what i mean 

319.17 325.53 A: yeah mhm yeah that's right because if you if you can devote your 

325.95 332.44 A: everything to that game you can also play something i mean it's not that hard but the thing is that ah 

332.62 345.33 A: if you if you see the soccer players here soccer players they're not famous nobody would know the so- soccer players here right the american players and they they could reach the sem- semifinals i guess and the 

340.91 341.76 B: yeah 

346.27 356.81 A: world cup this ah this world cup football world cup soccer which happened some time back right they reached the sem- semifinals that was wonderful 

357.18 358.84 A: do you do you watch soccer 

358.65 361.98 B: um i did watch the world cup last summer 

362.31 371.32 B: a little bit um i don't like i said i don't follow [laughter] i don't really follow it but and i also remember i'm from chicago originally and i remember um 

371.61 373.84 B: the world cup came there at one point 

371.66 372.33 A: mhm 

373.27 375.08 A: mhm yeah 

374.46 375.58 B: but um 

375.90 379.82 B: i don't know what is out tucson i have my aunt lives in tucson 

379.74 381.10 A: oh really 

380.49 385.23 B: what is i don't even know what you guys have out there phoenix doesn't have any teams with tucson either 

385.16 386.50 A: mhm yeah 

385.82 387.96 B: do they or they have hockey or something 

386.92 387.88 A: ah 

387.99 389.99 A: (( they have hockey because )) 

390.34 395.18 A: hockey the the ice hockey's not here because there is no decent ice so 

394.77 395.79 B: (( all right )) 

395.66 406.15 A: no ice hockey but there is a different kind of hockey which is called field hockey so ah people do play field hockey but that's not that's like very limited so 

399.99 401.07 B: right 

405.40 406.79 B: mhm 

406.66 412.33 A: but hockey's not here because there's no snow no ice it's so hot here 

412.30 423.34 B: yeah well i one of the things i was wondering about how they make so much money and like the companies that pay these players who are getting these huge salaries 

423.40 424.47 A: (( mhm )) 

423.53 426.09 B: i i sometimes have to wonder where 

426.22 429.91 B: like where's the money for them like it it has to be 

430.20 433.81 B: such a huge business for them to be able to dispense 

431.88 432.83 A: yeah 

433.20 434.76 A: yeah that's right it's 

434.15 444.96 B: that much on each player because even the lowest player on every team gets paid more than four times me and you combined probably make or chances are so 

434.81 436.20 A: (( just huge )) 

442.63 446.12 A: [laughter] yeah that's right 

445.64 446.73 B: um 

449.12 453.10 B: i i guess it would be from advertising i guess it would be from 

453.15 457.19 B: you know fans and merchandising and stuff 

453.45 465.43 A: yeah it's more advertising yeah yeah it's they have these grand am- ambassadors so they make huge money i mean every player is nowadays to some company big com- big shot 

465.35 466.66 B: yeah 

466.33 474.46 A: i mean if you see that ah if there had been no not that much of money most of the players wouldn't played you know 

474.48 478.72 A: everybody would have gone to some different [laughter] so 

478.91 488.25 B: i guess it's a hard obviously it's a hard in- um industry to infiltrate though i mean the people that make it are only one of many like they're one of a kind if you make 

483.41 484.36 A: yeah 

488.46 490.34 B: it [laughter] into like the big leagues 

490.26 504.10 B: so i g- i mean in a way you have to work hard at it but it's just like it's just like acting i have friends that are actors and chances are they're just not they're not going to make it that's the odds and that's the same with sports like the odds are really really against you there's 

495.95 496.84 A: mhm 

500.52 501.40 A: yeah 

503.73 505.02 A: mhm yeah 

503.90 508.49 B: millions and millions of people that play basketball and that want to do that as a living 

506.96 507.77 A: yeah 

508.72 511.94 B: but only so many can and 

511.48 512.70 A: yeah 

512.11 524.38 B: you have to sort of be like i i the reward is almost just like overwhelming i mean come on you made it but still like me or you could work to be the best lawyer in the world and still never make as much money as that it's just like 

519.10 519.89 A: yeah 

524.49 526.02 B: (( it's like it's )) 

526.12 528.94 B: like i don't know an of wealth 

529.72 538.92 A: that's right you have to be you know very very good at the games that that's the only way you can get in you can make it mhm 

536.35 537.13 B: (( i )) 

538.22 540.28 B: (( guess ahem um )) 

539.25 540.35 A: (( what do you do ))
