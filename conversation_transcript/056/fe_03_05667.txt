0.00 2.71 A: hey i'm scott glazier from newton massachusetts 

2.80 5.59 B: i'm stan miller from lexington in kentucky 

5.40 6.69 A: oh nice to meet you 

6.52 7.69 B: nice to meet you 

7.61 9.60 A: so what's your opinion 

9.65 11.11 B: (( ah well i )) 

11.96 17.73 B: kind of go back and forth on it i agree with what's going on sometimes and other times i don't you know 

18.03 22.34 B: just ah i feel like it's going to be a long drawn out process 

22.06 25.46 A: yeah u- unfortunately i feel as though i mean 

25.73 33.07 A: they're so different i mean betwee- i don't know when i think of peace in the middle east i think between ah ah usually israel and palestine 

33.03 34.00 B: uh-huh 

33.46 40.64 A: and after all these years it seems as though there's no hope that whoever obtains peace 

38.51 39.27 B: no 

40.91 47.16 B: yeah i agree i don't think i don't think there's a-a shot of it at all just ah seems like a lost cause 

44.41 45.42 A: yeah 

47.43 50.23 B: i kind of agreed with the iraq thing until ah 

51.12 54.63 B: you know they just still haven't come up with any proof of what we went over there for 

54.26 66.39 A: right exactly um it seems that like a lot of iraqi citizens were happy originally because now they're quote unquote free of saddam hussein's reign 

66.21 67.02 B: yeah 

66.39 79.48 A: but i mean as you said like actually the um c._i._a. made an accusation um telling th- the united states government not to actually go through with it and that there was not enough proof and then i think they were right 

75.57 76.36 B: yeah 

79.04 82.56 B: yeah i agree with you there i don't think they had e- e- enough ah 

82.33 95.98 B: evidence of any ah weapons of mass destruction and my opinion we didn't go over there to free these people we went over there to to rid um iraq of weapons of mass destruction that was my whole reason for agreeing with it 

95.36 100.38 A: right but i think their main reason was for it to co- to contain and to control all the oil 

100.31 104.35 B: yeah i agree with you there i think you're right 

100.86 101.57 A: um 

101.87 102.54 A: (( um )) 

103.31 108.50 A: and which is a perfect explanation of the stuff with president bush 

108.70 119.32 A: i really think i mean that the only way he could think of to fix the economy was if he somehow not only went to war which causes people to spend more on defenses 

119.08 126.90 A: but also if he obtained more oil which would bring the which would bring down oil prices and then also cause people to spend more 

126.80 128.51 B: right i think it's a in 

128.55 130.40 B: my opinion it's a ah 

130.79 140.04 B: republican thing as far as war it seems like all republican presidents are nothing but warmongers and that's what i give president bush any more 

140.51 142.47 A: yeah now do you 

141.17 143.45 B: it just seems like it's never ending 

142.87 144.76 A: are you a fan of president bush 

145.28 146.47 B: i'm sorry 

145.90 147.85 A: are you a fan of president bush 

148.04 154.14 B: i agreed i liked the way he handled the the nine eleven issues 

154.36 163.58 B: but and i well like i said i agreed with ah the weapons of mass destruction issue as far as ah going to the middle east and iraq but ah 

163.61 168.84 B: you know i'm not a fan of president bush otherwise i think he's done a real bad job of handling the economy 

168.39 183.04 A: i agree with you and it seems that i don't know when president clinton was in power he was trying to control the middle east in terms of israel but now that with both bushes both senior and junior they've all been going towards ah iraq and iran 

176.19 177.84 B: yeah 

182.98 184.63 A: which has to do with oil 

183.05 186.95 B: yeah i think i think he's try to finish what his dad started 

186.08 192.55 A: right and like i don't know because of this thing with iraq it's been no one's really focused on 

192.68 196.35 A: israel and palestine and how that conflict is still 

194.43 196.15 B: right 

196.56 197.46 A: you know 

197.60 201.44 A: it's still present but honestly i really don't know what the united states can do 

201.57 203.62 B: yeah yeah i don't 

202.48 203.46 A: because 

203.39 218.12 A: i'm really against the fact that they're trying to be a superpower and trying to control everything yet at the same time i'm kind of i'm very pro israel i'm trying to think of some way the united states could help but there's no way they can pick sides without angering the other 

208.71 209.85 B: yeah 

218.29 220.56 B: right i agree you know i think ah 

220.82 228.11 B: there's got to be some way we can help out without trying to control the whole situation 'cause we got our own problems to worry about over here 

225.01 225.86 A: right 

228.45 238.55 A: agreed yeah exactly that's another thing with all like trying to control like the foreign countries we have so many problems in the united states that no one even focuses about even 

238.37 244.67 A: mentions one being the economy like the the like um unemployment rate 

244.71 252.38 A: i mean there's all this all this not really controversy but like problems that exist in our own nation that no one cares about 

244.73 245.54 B: uh-huh 

252.05 260.29 B: exactly i mean you you that's that's an issue we could sit and talk about all day long the problems we've got and we're worried it seems we're worried about everybody else 

256.16 257.06 A: right 

259.86 264.32 A: exactly and then i don't know like 

264.62 268.80 A: i'm i'm kind of curious to see what's going to happen for next year's election 

268.91 269.96 A: because 

269.31 270.96 B: yeah 

270.04 284.38 A: i mean whoever becomes president whether it's bush again or a democrat is going to have i think it's going to he or she should focus strongly on the internal problems i think that's going to be a main part of their campaign 

284.87 289.97 B: definitely i mean we've just watched unemploy- the unemployment rate skyrocket 

289.35 290.84 A: right exactly 

290.30 297.19 B: and i mean it's taken three years to c- comple- completely destroy what clinton accomplished i mean i'm not saying he was ah 

298.16 305.76 B: the greatest president we've ever had but he had his problems but you know he he accomplished a lot and as far as the deficit and everything 

302.60 304.14 A: he did a great job 

305.18 317.66 A: i think he is one of the best presidents we've had and the fact that he i mean he [mn] when he was in president going back to the middle east and peace um israel signed a treaty with not only egypt but also with um jordan 

317.60 318.43 B: uh-huh 

318.10 331.04 A: so i mean that was like a huge accomplishment and then people you know in ninety five ninety six you know people were were starting to gain hope with yitzhak rabin as ah the um 

331.19 339.41 A: the prime minister of israel and then once he was assassinated and then i don't know ever since bush has been president it's just been 

333.01 333.85 B: uh-huh 

339.50 341.07 A: hopeless no one's 

341.10 342.41 A: had any 

342.72 344.88 A: possibility of it happening 

345.38 360.06 B: i mean well he he it seems like he's just been focused on war and nothing but war it's not enough he fig- i think he figures that war is going to bring about peace in the middle east and you know it's just not going to happen it's just making things worse it seems like 

349.07 350.11 A: right 

358.76 367.38 A: well like and like having the united states trying to control the middle east like that's one of the reasons why i think september eleventh happened 

366.81 368.03 B: definitely 

367.41 376.86 A: i mean we go into like the united states news doesn't even show half of it but like how we tried to tell other countries what to do 

376.82 387.25 A: you know we try to say freedom we try to say we fight for freedom and democracy when we are specifically telling them what to do and not letting them try to do their own type of governmental system 

387.28 388.94 B: yep definitely 

387.69 394.19 A: and and that's one of the reasons why september eleventh happened and why peace in the middle east is going to be difficult because 

394.19 395.24 A: i mean 

395.16 406.81 A: they're we're the bully and they're just trying to protect themselves i mean granted it was a terrible thing to happen and i remember that day i was like i can't wait to attack i attack the taliban or 

398.61 399.45 B: uh-huh 

401.56 402.63 B: right 

406.72 412.44 A: or what not but like i don't know there's reasons for their actions with us being the main reason 

412.46 414.94 B: right i agree 

414.97 416.14 B: yeah um 

417.70 418.72 B: (( the ah )) 

418.85 423.64 B: yeah like you said september eleventh was awful but you know you can't really blame them for 

423.88 427.54 B: feeling i i mean th- they're feeling the pressure from us 

427.17 428.45 A: right 

427.87 430.29 B: and we can't push our government off on other people 

430.05 431.43 A: agreed 

431.61 434.70 B: i mean that's what we're that's what our whole country was founded on 

435.24 437.82 B: was we wanted to break away from 

439.31 441.37 B: what was being pushed off on us 

440.93 444.22 A: right and it's kind of hard to forget that 

441.67 442.54 B: so 

443.75 445.53 B: yeah i mean 

444.46 446.58 A: i mean to remember that sorry 

445.84 453.14 B: yeah yeah people people just ah i guess we just take for granted what we've got and we think that ah you know we just should rule the world 

453.22 454.49 A: right 

453.93 457.14 B: but we've seen countries fall throughout history 

457.59 459.28 B: for doing the same things 

458.95 459.92 A: mhm 

459.29 468.32 B: try to take over the world and you get you get too big and you just think you can run the whole thing run the whole show and somebody comes along and knocks you down 

468.21 478.80 A: yeah and then just i don't know soon it's going to you know what goes around comes around soon and i don't know i get worried that like sometimes we'll pick with the wrong person 

478.84 481.64 A: or we won't be as victorious as we have been 

481.86 483.03 B: definitely 

482.45 485.25 A: and and some- and who knows i mean 

485.47 495.82 A: but like i don't know things have quieted down though since then so i have to give bush credit on that that i know the nation of the united states has felt a lot safer 

495.95 500.39 A: after september eleventh but but 

496.40 497.18 B: yeah 

497.94 498.73 B: yeah 

500.57 502.13 A: (( still i don't know )) 

502.14 504.31 B: yeah i mean here iraq's 

504.64 510.06 B: not come to a close but it's quieted down like you said but here we go with ah liberia now 

510.04 511.41 A: right right 

510.45 512.56 B: and when does it stop 

511.98 513.78 A: and yeah it's 

513.86 517.08 A: and like it's and again it's all for oil 

517.02 519.59 B: yeah you can't help everybody 

517.66 519.03 A: all for oil 

519.01 524.33 A: and then like what are you going to do when the oil's done like when it's all gone 

523.76 524.57 B: uh-huh 

524.12 537.15 A: you know instead of trying to attack instead of putting all this money into defenses into attacking other countries put the money into like the en- environmental studies or scientific studies which will then create some other means of power 

537.22 539.31 B: definitely 

537.98 539.95 A: like so i mean i don't know 

539.97 554.66 A: now i don't know if i'm so like angered at our country because of bush or because of just his staff or because of what the events have been recently i just don't remember being this like upset at our country when clinton was the president 

553.81 555.55 B: i don't either i 

554.99 556.07 A: (( so i )) 

556.28 558.38 A: (( don't know as as a repub- )) 

556.88 560.53 B: mean you know like i said he done some things that wasn't you know 

560.54 566.14 B: typical of your great presidents but he i i agree with you when you said he's one of our better presidents 

565.69 568.41 A: now do you think bush will get reelected 

568.49 570.73 B: uh unfortunately yes 

570.24 571.59 A: yeah see that's 

570.99 573.88 B: i won't vote for him but yes i think he will be 

573.41 587.34 A: yeah i- it's unfortunate because i don't know like i'm really surprised that someone from i don't know i consider kentucky relatively south and like republican this is so it's so i guess against bush it's kind of nice to hear 

588.61 592.28 B: yeah i just ah you know i voted democrat last time 

591.71 593.17 A: oh really 

592.70 596.90 B: yeah i and i [mn] voted for clinton in mm both elections before that i 

596.94 599.89 B: there was never really a strong republican candidate for me i don't
