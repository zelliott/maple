0.05 1.22 A: (( hello )) 

0.20 2.61 B: hi how're you doing this is cole 

2.46 3.77 A: hi this is joan 

3.76 12.54 B: hi how's it going um so the topic i guess is ah if sports players are overpaid 

4.81 6.40 A: oh pretty good 

11.24 12.96 A: yes i think that yes 

13.53 15.14 B: y- you think so 

14.73 15.96 A: well i 

16.14 23.76 A: [cough] you know i i'd rather see the sports players get it than the than the owners and the and the advertisers and so forth 

23.98 27.09 B: yeah but i i i honestly i think that ah 

27.06 32.03 B: for the most part they're overpaid they just do something that um 

31.89 37.62 B: basically it's like skilled trades you know like they devoted so much time to it i think they 

34.08 36.05 A: mhm 

37.43 49.25 B: deserve a certain amount of money but i think you know some some sports players get paid millions [laughter] you know and i think that's that's just ridiculous what's that 

43.81 47.27 A: it does really affect the ticket price too 

47.92 50.01 A: it really affects the ticket price too 

49.96 52.42 B: what do you mean by that 

51.17 58.36 A: ah well you know when you pay athletes so much then ah if you go to a football game what it's like thirty five bucks now to go to a football game 

53.97 56.18 B: oh yeah 

57.88 66.37 B: yeah i i mean it's just it's way over rated i think it also has to do with the american culture a lot of it i mean you 

64.64 66.36 A: yes yeah i agree 

66.20 74.47 B: you you go to other countries and they don't have they don't pay sports stars you know the same price that they're paid over here 

73.89 80.32 A: i think part of it too may be because ah we're such a big country and have a lot of people so we have a lot of money here 

80.37 82.63 B: yeah well i mean 

80.38 83.38 A: but ah it makes a big market 

83.44 87.81 B: well i mean in population terms we're actually not that big 

87.83 96.46 B: i mean we're actually we grow like the actually the least of any other country i mean the l._d._c.'s and ah 

96.56 107.25 B: you know less developed countries and things like that they actually have a lot more ah people than over here but i mean i i think it has more to do with wealth 

107.48 113.00 B: things like that are that our our culture is more towards entertainment 

108.72 110.75 A: yeah 

112.56 115.47 A: i think wealth has a lot to do with it because we have a lot of money here 

115.28 122.52 B: yeah yeah we're definitely one of the richer countries i i definitely agree with you on that that um 

115.55 118.29 A: (( a lot of disposable income )) 

122.63 134.91 B: and i i i honestly think that i mean if i was playing baseball or whatever and i'd been doing it all my life it's something you love anyway i mean why else are you doing it so 

133.57 144.19 A: yeah well some people will just do anything for the money i think some of them are are like teachers who get burnt out on teaching but they do it for the money now 

136.61 139.25 B: [laughter] do you really think so 

144.06 151.07 B: yeah i i can see that like getting tired of it but they had to they had to like it in the beginning right 

149.75 151.95 A: yeah i would think so to be into it 

151.41 156.39 B: i mean yeah i mean to get good at something like that what's that 

151.96 154.30 A: unless they just had a natural talent 

155.10 157.64 A: unless they just had a natural talent for it 

157.19 163.27 B: yeah but i think you i think you still need to practice even with natural talent i mean i've played ah 

163.21 174.55 B: hockey and things like that and people have said that i've had really good eye hand coordination and stuff but you still have to work at it like you know constantly in order to get good 

172.53 174.55 A: yeah it does take a lot of practice mm 

174.49 180.76 B: yeah and i mean if you don't love the sport and you're doing it you know six hours a day 

180.86 184.06 B: you gotta ask yourself why you're doing it you know 

181.63 182.75 A: (( yep )) 

184.65 186.60 B: so i mean i i i think it's 

186.80 198.75 B: i mean in a way the way that our country perceives ah you know sports and entertainment and stuff like that they're not overpaid just because people are willing to pay it 

197.77 203.63 A: mhm you know i guess where a lot of it comes from is the t._v. advertising that's like a huge revenue 

201.84 203.56 B: yeah 

203.77 208.72 B: but it it's also something that's built up over over time you know 

205.37 207.17 A: (( mhm )) 

208.65 214.89 B: sports stars didn't get paid this much back in you know the fifties and sixties and things like that 

214.45 216.04 A: (( yeah )) 

214.90 216.17 B: i think it's 

216.18 224.38 B: over generations of time it kind of becomes almost like a tradition like let's sit down with a beer and you know watch the baseball game 

224.39 232.35 B: or the football game so it's just i i think for the most part it it almost is a part of our tradition 

231.77 232.97 A: yes 

232.37 239.54 B: so if you're saying that these players are overpaid and things like that you're almost criticizing 

239.59 247.42 B: um our tradition and our society societal values you know at the same time so it's kind of like a 

247.74 249.14 B: it's kind of ah 

249.12 250.78 B: a contradiction 

250.79 266.72 B: like to say that they're overpaid like if you're so like a patriot and stuff like that but just because of the way that our country works but at the same time you gotta say that it's got to end at you know some point there's got to be some cut off 

257.71 258.58 A: (( mhm )) 

266.13 273.18 A: well you know if they they capped the salaries of the of the players the advertisers on t._v. are still going to pay the same amount 

268.42 271.61 B: mhm 

273.30 284.28 A: and so all the extra money that would have gone to the players will now go to the owners and to the big managers and so forth so i think if they were to cap the players salaries 

284.36 292.34 A: maybe it'd be a good idea then to use some of that money to co- to to subsidize tickets for stadiums so you don't have to pay 'em 

292.60 294.16 B: but then it takes away 

292.66 295.01 A: you know a week's wages to go to the game 

294.84 297.59 B: yeah but then if you do that then 

297.50 303.57 B: you know it takes incentives for you know the people who are trying to market it 

303.35 313.56 B: you know then then it just kind of degrades the sport you know the field will maybe get you know not as much care and stuff like that they'll say you know we're not getting that much money out of this 

313.81 315.00 B: (( you know so )) 

313.85 315.03 A: (( well if they )) 

315.04 319.89 A: well if they capped the players salaries as i see it they'll have all this extra money 

319.88 322.80 B: yeah and just made the tickets cheaper 

322.45 329.86 A: yeah make the tickets cheaper to the stadium to make up for that because the players you know that's all these millions of dollars that are now floating around 

328.37 333.18 B: but then also the thing is would the tickets be cheaper 

332.61 338.69 A: yeah see i don't think it would be i think the managers not the managers but the owners would pocket that 

337.15 341.71 B: but but also it's supply and demand 

341.33 344.73 A: well if none of the players are playing and the the the supply'll 

344.93 347.72 A: will be there that's the main thing mhm 

346.05 351.23 B: right but that's the problem if you have like dollar tickets everyone wants to go 

351.70 356.10 B: and then so how do you limit you know just have a big 

354.62 362.55 A: i guess it'd be like a a concert where you pay you know if concert tickets start at like you know forty five bucks but then by the time you buy 'em on line they're two hundred 

362.36 374.12 B: yeah yeah that's exactly like how they get their costs is supply and demand it's like how everything you know has a cost i mean i work at a brokerage right now 

362.95 365.55 A: (( i can see it ending up being like that )) 

374.15 387.46 B: and that's exactly what the stock market is it's supply and demand like half those stocks are you know they're not worth what people pay for 'em so it's the same concept with sports you know 

377.98 378.87 A: yes 

384.08 384.85 A: yes 

387.59 398.12 A: i guess that's what the the players are then supply and demand there's only so many that are really really good and the teams are willing to pay it because that brings the revenue in to them when you've got you know 

392.68 394.77 B: (( yeah )) 

395.85 397.78 B: yeah exactly i 

397.97 399.91 B: (( agree with that thoroughly )) 

398.34 400.31 A: kurt evert on your hm 

400.24 403.01 B: i agree with that thoroughly 

401.73 404.57 A: yeah if you've got evert on you team then people are going to watch you know 

404.11 406.41 B: what's that 

404.72 408.31 A: if you have you know kurt evert on your team people are going to watch your team you know 

407.89 415.28 B: yeah exactly i mean you have a phenomenal player everyone knows them i mean and then it goes into advertising too 

414.62 418.12 A: that goes in advertising yeah because then you got a good t._v. market on it 

416.00 429.76 B: yeah and everyone you know they respect him and they they see him do all these like moves and then all the kids are saying you know in the neighborhood they're like oh man i wish i could play like him and then you know coca cola 

427.27 428.58 A: yeah 

429.90 440.95 B: you know buys him out and has him drinking a coke on the street and that's you know that's the closest they can get to be like him you know it's kind of like ah 

434.93 437.55 A: [laughter] 

438.22 440.20 A: mhm 

441.33 446.16 B: i mean it's it's pathetic in some ways but at the same time it also 

446.17 454.90 B: i could see it as being like dreams and having hopes for people you know like rather than some kids just being like you know 

450.64 451.53 A: yes 

455.01 467.97 B: i don't have anywhere to go here at least he can idolize someone for those people who are you know a little bit lost don't know what they're doing in their life and stuff it almost gives them a little bit of direction even though 

467.97 470.74 B: it's kind of falsified direction 

470.64 475.19 A: well you know sporting figures are not that bad to idolize either generally 

474.88 483.56 B: yeah i mean i whoa i mean it depends who you're talking about [laughter] that's always the case there's always the rotten apple you know 

477.92 479.51 A: [laughter] that's true 

483.15 484.32 A: yes 

483.74 490.02 B: i mean ah there there's a lot of foul play i think in sports as well like drugs and 

487.44 493.75 A: well there wasn't when i was in school there was i used to do water polo and gosh the things that went on underneath the water 

494.08 497.50 A: the refs never saw where it was very 

495.76 502.74 B: [laughter] yeah yeah i mean it's it depends on the person it's just like you know there are 

502.78 510.77 B: some people who who enjoy selling drugs and killing people and then some people who who enjoy you know 

510.54 515.47 B: ah working hard and have good values and things like that it's the same i think 

514.08 514.88 A: yeah 

515.25 523.63 B: with anything but um i mean that i don't think it's almost i think a a player would get more 

523.52 530.77 B: if they were obnoxious and kind of like the rude like bad type of personality 

528.87 531.72 A: mhm yes sometimes that is the case 

531.64 544.55 B: yeah it it also like it's more entertaining people don't want to see someone saying hi how are you you know if someone like you know all of a sudden has a tantrum it's dramatic you know 

544.36 556.24 B: like oh look at that what's that yeah exactly i mean look at how much advertising that got and then from there there're like jokes and stuff like that it's just like 

544.42 545.87 A: (( yeah like mike tyson )) 

546.58 548.01 A: kinda like mike tyson 

548.91 549.86 A: uh-huh 

551.82 552.73 A: (( yeah )) 

556.03 559.91 B: how much entertainment can we juice out of these guys 

559.93 563.27 B: i think that's what it's all about and that's where the money comes from 

563.12 566.38 A: you know i think you're right there i think entertainment's a lot of it um 

566.28 569.38 B: yeah i i i think that you know 

569.26 574.69 B: it's just that's what it's all about for a lot of people in america i mean 

574.66 584.77 B: they make a ton of money and they have nothing to do with their money i mean they're so bored they're bored out of their minds a lot of them you know i mean it's also it's 

584.75 595.65 B: rich it's all classes that get into sports and things like that but it's the rich people that i think really pay for it i mean 

594.58 597.29 A: mhm yeah they're the ones who can afford to 

597.78 599.37 A: to do all the things 

597.79 599.89 B: yeah whatever it is you know like
