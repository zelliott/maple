0.70 2.37 B: hi my name's jason 

2.24 4.39 A: hi my name's jerry 

5.05 10.32 B: so uh what what's uh your first response to the uh to the question of the day here 

10.17 18.31 A: well actually i'm kinda glad that um i'm able to actually talk to somebody because i tried to do this last night and um person hung up on me 

18.31 19.67 B: oh no fun 

19.55 26.08 A: yeah no fun well actually i come from a kind of a different background because i was a flight attendant at one time 

25.69 26.69 B: oh 

26.90 36.97 A: [sigh] so with that um i was actually it was actually back in september two thousand and one um actually back before the um september eleventh 

36.84 37.70 B: mhm 

36.96 40.08 A: it it was actually in two thousand and um 

40.01 53.19 A: they had heightened security measures then but it's kinda like with anything um i'm i'm glad they have this in place but if you know if you get someone who's really who really wants to do this if you get someone who's not scared of dying something's going to happen 

53.29 54.48 B: mhm 

53.82 63.16 A: so it's like you know we can have all the security measures in place but if some you know you get somebody that that really wants to wreak harm and havoc and they don't care about dying then 

63.24 67.32 A: you know someone's going to get hurt or killed what do you think [noise] 

65.90 67.16 B: gee that 

67.30 76.48 B: i i i'm inclined to agree with you i mean that when you when you get in a situation where someone's willing to to throw away their life in pursuit of what they're trying to do then 

76.75 85.05 B: you know a lot of what you can do is you know a lot of the a lot of the things we do in our society are sort of based on the idea that people really don't want to die 

85.43 86.61 B: (( and that's you know )) 

85.65 86.97 A: right 

88.16 92.19 B: [noise] so if something's a threat to someone then they're going to try to not do it 

92.61 93.37 B: (( but )) 

93.46 97.85 A: [noise] yeah i don't think you'll ever have again someone hijacking a plane 

98.16 102.11 B: i don't think we're going to see anything quite like what we saw then i mean 

98.36 99.10 A: be 

101.82 115.54 A: no because you're going to have people because i'm just thinking from a flight attendant's response i'm thinking um the training they gave us was you know to cooperate with them and do what they say but i'm um likely thinking um coffee 

115.47 128.78 A: um the coffee filter to be able because if if they have box you know if they have a box cutters or whatever they have i'm thinking coffee you know use the big coffee mug luggage fire extinguishers so but [noise] 

117.59 118.22 B: (( mhm )) 

126.01 127.01 B: oh yeah 

127.41 128.66 B: i i i 

128.90 136.12 B: i think i mean just sort of sort of listening to you here one of the things i'd thought of is that you know a lot of the way it went because 

136.14 147.29 B: it it went the way it went on september eleventh in part because people really you know hijackings to date had been you cooperate with the hijackers they land the plane they make their demands they use you as hostages but you usually live 

147.51 150.20 A: exactly i agree yeah 

148.68 160.05 B: and yeah and i think people are more willing to sort of be a hero if they know that you know some of these hijackers are not planning to just sort of take the plane down somewhere and use you to negotiate they're uh 

160.61 162.36 B: planning on killing everyone 

162.50 165.38 A: oh yeah because it's just like that guy who um 

165.56 171.49 A: you know that unabomber guy the guy not the unabomber but um the guy who had the shoe bomb 

167.29 168.75 B: yeah ted kaczynski 

171.68 173.10 B: oh yeah yeah 

172.34 177.11 A: people just jumped on him i mean he was beat i mean did you see [laughter] the pictures 

176.70 179.83 B: i didn't actually i didn't but i heard the story no 

178.12 189.27 A: oh you didn't oh he was beat up i mean the accounts was that people just jumped on him i mean and then you had another flight it was actually i was watching the o'reilly fa- do you ever watch the o'reilly factor 

189.24 191.96 B: actually i i don't have t._v. surprisingly uh 

191.63 193.00 A: oh you don't 

192.38 194.74 B: i i get all my news off the net um 

195.21 202.57 B: i uh i had to choose had enough money to pay for either internet or t._v. so i paid for internet so i i read you know uh the canon dot com 

202.28 208.77 A: oh okay yeah well the o'reilly factor they were just talking about how a senator was actually on a flight this was after september eleventh 

208.56 209.43 B: mhm 

208.84 214.65 A: and somebody was like rushing the for some reason they were rushing up there to the pilots 

214.50 215.51 B: mhm 

214.84 222.42 A: to the pil- to the fr- to the front of the plane and people just jumped on him i mean some people saw it happen they just jumped on him 

219.06 219.91 B: yeah 

222.25 230.59 A: and and people these days you know you can't do anything stupid because you know now people's lives are in danger and they're not going to stand for it and it's like 

230.53 241.26 A: it's kinda like you know you may you you may hurt me a little bit or you may take me down but there's going to be you know anywhere from a hundred and fifty to two hundred other people on this plane that you're going to have to try to get through 

241.03 243.14 B: yeah you you can't take everybody 

242.65 243.95 A: right 

244.12 246.67 B: that that makes that makes a lot of sense i mean 

246.49 251.73 A: [sigh] so have you experienced the new air for have you have you done a lot of flying lately 

247.23 248.02 B: but 

251.09 260.38 B: i haven't but my um my mother does so i'm uh i'm with her in the terminal all the time so i mean i i saw i've seen it all though i haven't been through it very much 

261.22 263.22 B: it's uh it's pretty hard core 

263.22 267.08 A: yeah i went through actually um i'm out in l._a. 

267.20 277.21 A: and i actually went through i usually just go l._a. to um tallahassee florida because that's where my parents live my parents live outside tallahassee over on the georgia line 

273.90 274.98 B: makes sense 

277.26 289.52 A: and um l._a. isn't that bad um you go through and you go through security and everything and i never check i've learned being a flight i never check anything because i carry everything on board 

286.97 288.00 B: mhm 

289.39 295.69 A: and um i actually had to stopover in atlanta and i had a wedding to go to in atlanta um about a month ago 

295.56 305.10 A: and i can't believe [mn] the line to be able to get in was just you know long and forever 'cause now it's it's almost worth it if you if you have some place four hours away 

306.05 312.40 A: you know anything probably six hours away it's it's worth it it's much better just to drive there 

312.57 313.50 B: yeah 

312.93 323.61 A: than just to pay the money because now it's it's gotten so bad now where it's you know it's gotten so where you have to go two hours early and this and that that it's it's easier 

323.89 327.05 A: if it's six hours away it's just to drive 

326.43 330.36 B: yeah the the short hop flights haven't really been become convenient anymore 

329.98 330.90 A: no 

330.92 333.62 B: but i i don't know i mean i think 

333.92 339.04 B: i guess it makes sense it seems to me like uh the uh the whole 

339.48 344.75 B: the the heightened airport security seems less important than the the change in the attitude of the passengers 

344.30 348.47 A: oh huge i'd i'd have to agree with you on that jason that would be the um 

348.41 362.55 A: people more have to put up with delays now because see people don't realize like we had a i remember when i was flying um i was deadheading that means i was um i was coming back and i wasn't working i had worked a flight 

362.23 363.19 B: mhm 

362.86 367.17 A: um i worked just going say for example i worked a flight up to dallas 

367.05 378.31 A: and then i was coming back from dallas well i heard that there was a mechanical and people and people were like oh oh you know people were all mad you know they'd say oh i can't believe this 

378.46 389.22 A: but then now when you hear people hear something like that's no big deal because people don't realize man anything can go there's several things that can go wrong with that plane and it's just like your car 

382.21 383.09 B: yeah 

389.08 396.16 A: if your car has a flat tyre or your check engine light comes on you don't go getting in that car and you're not going to drive across country 

396.23 407.57 B: and more importantly i mean if your car goes and something seizes up on your car you can try to sort of coast off the side of the road and call triple a but uh something seizes up on your plane you don't really want to try coasting 

407.17 413.87 A: (( [laughter] oh definitely it's like it's like you know it don't work in fact uh )) 

407.70 408.94 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

412.81 414.32 B: it doesn't work too well 

414.57 416.43 A: go ahead 

415.60 418.33 B: no i was just saying doesn't work too well [laughter] 

417.51 429.09 A: no in fact we had uh one time i was in flight when i was in flight training it was kind of funny with the you know heightened security one thing was that you had to be honest with the passengers 

429.10 432.47 A: and i was told to be irate 

429.16 429.86 B: (( mhm )) 

432.46 434.71 A: and um to be an irate passenger 

434.69 446.08 A: and what happened was i kept asking where the scenario was going to be ditching and i kept asking are you know has there ever been a successful ditching and they would never answer me finally they said no and i calmed down 

446.03 448.76 A: and i think a big thing is is if you're just 

448.69 461.75 A: um with even with all the the airport security and everything you're just honest with the passengers and just say hey we gotta do this we gotta do that you know i i can see a lot more people now are um 

454.54 455.39 B: mhm 

461.67 467.78 A: they're not as angry as they used to be by having to have delays or having to wait or this or that 

467.81 469.62 B: yeah that that makes 

469.74 475.31 B: makes a lot of sense i think the one thing that i'm sort of concerned about with the the heightened airport security 

474.79 475.71 A: okay 

475.50 477.51 B: is that it seems to me like uh 

478.21 487.67 B: you know some people think oh well we've heightened security in the airports nothing bad can happen now and i think they're they're not taking into account that you know things can happen that don't involve planes 

487.62 489.34 A: yeah 

488.46 493.73 B: i i don't think we're going to see anything happen that involves a plane again just 'cause everyone's paying attention to planes now 

494.72 504.21 A: yeah so you're saying more so in the um in the terminals itself where people where you have large gatherings of people before they pass the security checkpoints 

499.35 500.41 B: [mn] i 

503.93 507.92 B: yeah or even i mean or even you know not on airports i mean 

507.98 512.39 B: you know there's there isn't half as much kind of security on amtrak i mean someone 

512.42 523.81 B: admittedly you know you can't fly amtrak into a building but you can you know you can do a lot of damage if you if you were to you know take out a train on the rails passing another train 

515.48 517.09 A: right 

525.05 527.31 B: i mean you know that would that could shut a a 

527.45 531.94 B: travel corridor you know they they don't they pass through major cities 

532.40 538.56 B: i mean all all that sort of stuff but we don't see any kind of you know you know severe bomb screenings for like when you're getting on amtrak 

538.20 543.47 A: [noise] [noise] right well the you know the biggest thing is that a lot of people do think that after the fact 

543.27 544.12 B: yeah 

543.44 545.95 A: it's just like after september eleventh 

545.80 549.46 A: people that's when it's we're not 

549.25 563.71 A: that's one thing about americans we're not very proactive we wait we wait until something happens like you know the reason a an overpass [noise] you know they won't build an overpass until like in my town they didn't build an overpass 

553.00 553.84 B: yeah 

563.59 571.90 A: until like i think like a senator or someone you know a politician ended up dying on the way to the hospital because 

571.88 582.01 A: the train was in the way and the senator died because the train took the underpass and so they finally built a they finally excuse me they built a underpass for it 

582.05 593.78 A: and so with the heightened airport security people are kinda like oh nothing can happen uh this that and so it's kinda like we're very we're um we're very reactive and not proactive 

582.32 583.54 B: right yeah 

593.65 594.88 B: mhm 

595.08 599.89 B: that i i'd certainly i'd agree with that sentiment just seems to be sort of in the
