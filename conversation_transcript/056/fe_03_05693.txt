0.21 1.62 B: hi i'm aaron 

1.36 2.92 A: hi i'm a._j. 

2.76 4.14 B: hi nice to meet you 

3.87 5.34 A: nice to meet you too aaron 

5.53 7.48 A: have you done this before 

5.68 6.50 B: (( hi )) 

6.76 7.92 B: yes 

7.57 9.53 A: (( okay so are we just supposed )) 

8.29 9.59 B: just one have you 

9.79 11.44 A: no this is my first one 

11.24 17.82 B: yeah you just want to start talking about ah what was the topic foreign relations and if we think anything's a threat to us 

17.73 20.08 A: yeah by other specific countries 

19.74 25.99 B: yeah um i would say you know based on what i read in the media that there's definitely 

26.25 39.27 B: you know some threats out there to us from other countries specifically i think you know i think the korea situation and some of the countries that you know you don't even hear about in the news now 

39.65 42.89 B: um are probably the countries that we have to worry about the most 

43.45 44.35 B: ah 

45.69 54.89 A: yeah it's funny i gue- i mean to a certain degree i kind of agree with korea because it is such a wild card and you know the political you know structure right now 

45.75 46.53 B: (( you know )) 

54.79 67.13 A: is an interesting form of like dicta- you know [laughter] comm- old style communism thrown in with a wacky dictator um and a completely you know poor ah country but 

67.31 80.62 A: i don't know when it's kind of hard to say like specifically countries because most of the you know the threats we're dealing with now are organizations i believe i mean there is always you know the problems dealing with china 

80.56 87.33 A: and it would be nice to get rid of france i think but i don't think they'll let us get away with that um 

83.94 85.26 B: [laughter] 

85.47 86.54 B: [laughter] 

89.12 90.26 A: i think [mn] 

90.27 101.74 A: you know looking at what's going on out there i'm more worried about like what's happening from economic destabilization and growing health care problems are going to cause problems for the united states 

102.10 110.21 A: i don't know like what do you thi- i mean do you really think that when we look at like some of these you know teeny african countries that like we're going to liberia now 

110.35 118.76 A: you know that they could actually pose pose a threat to us or do you think it's just because of the situation that organizations can use that situation 

118.78 120.10 A: against us 

119.83 131.79 B: i don't know see my biggest worry with all of this is that i i think you're right i don't think in actual you know korea or x. country hates us so therefore you still there 

131.56 132.70 A: yeah 

132.09 134.05 B: okay so therefore 

134.17 141.53 B: you know we should be worried about all korea i think it's like these individual groups and i think you know the biggest thing that worries me is 

142.36 144.33 B: i don't think it's that hard 

144.64 154.43 B: to create a single nuclear weapon that can have substantial destructive capabilities and to protect against all these little 

151.30 152.19 A: (( mhm )) 

155.38 167.61 B: little groups that may have the capabilities to actually launch a nuclear weapon at the u._s. is you know something that poses a real threat because you know 

167.88 179.92 B: i don't think [mn] you know i don't think iraq as a country saddam hussein would have ever have launched any major chemical warfare against the u._s. because i you know once you do that you basically have the entire world 

179.81 181.98 A: (( yeah it narrows the excuse )) 

179.99 186.68 B: you know every- nobody would have nobody would have been safe and everybody would have came up against you but if you're 

185.42 192.36 A: and now it seems that they didn't even have [laughter] the chemical weapons we were so worried about which is the funniest part [laughter] so gosh 

189.63 190.83 B: yeah 

191.70 193.63 B: but you know after 

193.99 195.08 B: um 

195.90 199.87 B: if but if like a little group has it in some foreign 

199.66 214.00 B: [mn] you know crazy place off in the middle of nowhere and they do it you know the country itself that was harboring them can say well listen you know w- we'll go ahead and change our policies but you know who you are you going to go after and who how can you police that 

199.89 200.92 A: yeah 

214.10 220.78 A: yeah it's weird because i mean you look at like well vari- the last time there was a terrorist attack using 

220.75 230.20 A: um chemical weapons was in japan with the sarin attacks back in what was it the mid nineties where that like weird cult released sarin 

230.64 233.59 A: in the um subway system in tokyo 

233.80 244.27 A: and only six people died and yet you know they've had fires that have killed you know it's it's a weird you know when we get worried i almost wonder if like we're almost looking 

244.52 254.14 A: at a boogieman rather than a real problem 'cause yeah i mean i [laughter] i live in new york city a nuclear bomb going off you know that's it 

250.89 251.91 B: oh me too 

254.25 255.17 B: yeah 

254.59 267.17 A: end of the story yet at the same time it's like you look at the problems that are going on in the world it's like all right terrorist attacks are bad but even with nine eleven and what's going on in israel and other places 

267.24 277.20 A: it's a fraction compared to health problems you know various you know from ill nutrition to you know tuberculosis to aids to other things and it's like okay 

277.95 287.42 A: i'm almost worried that we're concentrating too much on these problems that yeah it would be horrible and the worst thing in the world to be in the middle of one happening 

287.22 293.76 A: but they really don't cause that much damage in reality to what's going on 

293.99 295.59 A: around the world and 

294.89 295.82 B: true 

296.23 297.10 B: true 

296.31 298.21 A: yeah so i think to me that 

298.32 311.18 A: you know when we look at what's going on in other countries that we're dealing with i mean i look and it's like liberia yeah is a great example since we're now looking like we're going to send soldiers into you know see not only did we f- you know 

310.96 317.03 A: provide for their founding back in the mid you know [mn] after the civil war if you look 

315.96 320.62 B: now did you read that article in ah the village voice on that is that 

319.63 320.55 A: which one 

320.86 322.41 B: the one about ah 

322.83 328.18 B: i think it was the village voice about liberia and it's finding and how it was basically came about 

328.22 334.35 A: well i mean i've i've read about it the history of it but i didn't see the village voice article what were they saying in it 

333.87 346.86 B: just ba- you know they were basically talking about you know how we basically created liberia and put everything in control and now all of a sudden it's falling apart and you know we we suddenly feel like we have to be the ones that protect it 

339.02 340.01 A: yeah 

346.92 361.10 A: well it's kind of interesting because as long as the cold war was going on liberia you know they had enough money to kind of you know from our backing to keep everything stable but once you know that fell apart it you know they kind of haven't been it's 

361.20 362.95 A: (( like i don't know )) 

361.90 363.47 B: oh is that what happened 

363.12 364.43 A: (( i mean )) 

364.66 376.30 A: they were stable up until you know the past like six seven years when they've been having a lot of you know problems internally and so all of a sudden it's like oh if we were more involved [laughter] 

376.46 377.32 A: (( ah )) 

377.56 378.79 B: right 

377.59 386.20 A: yeah i wonder if you know when you look at it i mean i'd be more worried with what's going on in nigeria with you know the north being so muslim 

386.35 390.96 A: oriented you know if they ever get control of you know 

391.08 396.32 A: all of nigeria they're very con- you know the north ah yeah the north has a very conservative 

396.62 397.94 A: muslim 

398.32 405.32 A: you know outlook [mn] orthodox or conservative look to it you know and that could be difficult for us 

404.70 408.66 B: hey i'm going to throw you on hold for one second do you mind if you just keep talking 

406.38 407.25 A: sure 

408.08 409.20 A: yeah sure 

409.45 414.13 A: [laughter] i guess what it comes down to i'm more worried about like what would 

414.99 416.49 A: (( become with )) 

417.06 422.46 A: dealing with orthodox either through north korean style or through 

422.99 425.39 A: you know looking at what's going on 

425.62 426.76 A: (( in )) 

426.85 429.98 A: from the con- more conservative muslim movements 

429.16 429.88 B: (( ah )) 

430.31 431.14 B: sorry 

431.31 440.29 A: yeah i i guess i was trying to bring it back more to their question of like countries [mn] and and saying i guess more my fear is 

440.71 443.59 A: how in the face of 

444.01 448.16 A: [mn] i guess almost the term increasing complexity in the world scene 

448.10 460.40 A: what we're seeing is a return towards you know orthodoxy either in like north korea's case of a dictatorship or you know the conservative muslim movement you know or even 

459.24 460.54 B: mhm 

460.30 474.54 A: you know what israel itself is you know facing where there's a movement towards more conservative you know orthodox jewish you know leadership i'm wondering if that's going to be more of a problem over time that we're going to end up facing 

474.73 480.00 A: including our own internal conservative you know orthodox movement 

479.51 494.37 B: you think though if we ever reduce our dependency upon oil that we'll basically a lot of these problems themselves will work out 'cause it seems to me like a lot of the problems that we have with a lot of these foreign countries as a whole 

494.79 496.54 B: a lot of it has to do 

497.14 500.03 B: a lot of it behind it there's a lot of economics 

499.92 508.17 A: [mn] well yeah you know [mn] the world i mean it's all i think it's related to economics and the thing is it's like all right 

509.15 516.00 A: there's been movements from time to time to kind of wean down our oil dependency but you know 

516.18 518.84 A: none of it ever seems to gain traction 

518.95 521.78 A: and i'd be curious to see if like 

522.04 523.39 A: [sigh] if 

523.51 527.76 A: we were to go to a more you know sustainable you know 

528.17 530.90 A: i guess you know everything from 

531.28 536.93 A: hopefully a little bit safer nuclear power to solar to wind to other forms 

537.04 541.45 A: you know what that would do in our relations and you look at i mean 

541.72 550.88 A: look what happened when japan got strong economically and we got all scared of them and they became this arch enemy in the eighties before collapsing you know themselves it's 

551.54 552.46 B: (( yeah )) 

551.91 561.20 A: like [mn] you know we i guess we will turn around and keep making you know monsters out of the people that we're worried about you know financially 

561.99 567.15 B: my problem is and you know where i where i kind of come on to the political side of things 

567.57 573.84 B: is like if if your responsibility's to manage this entire country and to make the decisions between 

574.21 577.97 B: which threats are real and what aren't you know i i 

578.45 582.43 B: it's easy to say without sitting in the hot seat that you know 

582.67 587.24 B: i'd get out of iraq and i'd get out of africa and leave them to be 

587.15 588.08 A: yeah 

587.68 591.13 B: but sometimes you know i think these guys have to make some pretty tough 

591.42 596.42 B: decisions in terms of what to do and i think you know one of the things i was speaking about 

596.43 599.89 B: with a friend of mine a while ago when this whole iraq was coming is that
