0.36 2.12 A: hi my name's shane 

1.96 4.76 B: hey shane my name is ward 

4.18 5.58 A: (( what's your name ward )) 

5.40 7.39 B: ward yeah 

6.22 8.01 A: hey what's up my man 

8.04 8.98 B: (( how's it going )) 

8.96 11.50 A: oh [laughter] it's going all right 

11.12 17.46 B: yeah i guess our our topic is ah does airport security make a difference 

11.86 12.94 A: (( so so )) 

18.27 19.80 B: was that correct 

19.45 24.81 A: yeah yeah that that that is that is that is the topic at hand so so 

22.94 26.67 B: [laughter] what do you think about that what do you think on that subject 

26.65 29.25 A: well you know ward funny you should ask 

29.51 31.87 A: [laughter] yeah um 

32.01 42.09 A: thoughts on airport security does it really make a difference i don't know if it really does um you know i've read i've read the newspaper articles saying that you know they're having these 

41.99 56.60 A: undercover ah undercover tests where they you know have people sneak past airport security like you know three times out of ten and so maybe it doesn't work i don't know whoa what would you have to say about it 

56.39 59.77 B: [laughter] well you know after nine eleven they 

59.95 65.67 B: they started beefing up airport security and the sad thing was all the changes they had made 

65.85 74.47 B: ah really wouldn't have prevented what happened you know i mean these guys were bringing on they brought on these really low tech weapons box cutters 

74.80 82.89 B: and ah they could have easily done it with like a plastic shiv you know or something like that i i don't i think if people want to 

79.73 80.84 A: yeah 

83.34 95.97 B: bring that kind of violence on to a airplane i don't you know i don't think it's going to make a whole lot of difference i think you need the the basics like obviously you don't want people bringing fire fire power on on a plane or or 

95.00 96.59 A: absolutely 

96.03 107.91 B: yeah but i mean but it's it's kind of a personal thing i mean if people want to get around it and cause violence and havoc on an airplane they are going to find a way to do it 

107.93 111.58 B: you know so so making us go through all these 

109.12 110.49 A: yeah there's the 

111.65 112.67 B: crazy 

113.09 118.98 B: ah invasions of our privacy is not really going to benefit ah us at all i don't think 

118.79 133.64 A: no i i i i see what you're saying there's i mean there's easily a thousand and one ways you know alternative ways beyond you know what is tested for that airport security to hijack an airplane or to cause a disturbance or ah some kind of damage aboard an airplane 

133.46 134.57 B: right 

133.52 136.94 A: you're you're absolutely right um 

137.75 150.72 A: yeah i mean out of my personal experience i don't i don't think it has been at all successful and if anything takes up more time and takes up more money and ah you know just causes more ah bureaucratic work for the f._a._a. 

150.61 157.38 B: mhm mhm now they're talking about the last thing i heard it hasn't been in the news really that much lately i don't think but the last thing i heard was 

157.99 167.92 B: ah they were going to start doing background checks they wanted to have a huge computer system where everything was linked together so they could immediately run a background check on you every time you took a flight somewhere 

168.17 169.48 A: really 

168.82 171.58 B: yeah that seems pretty invasive it 

170.83 173.41 A: well when when did you hear about that 

173.00 175.22 B: was a while ago it was like 

175.84 183.47 B: i'd heard about it actually right before i took a flight and that was like last year was the last time i took a flight so it was like last summer 

184.22 189.34 A: yeah i i i mean i never heard of that at all and i don't think that 

187.95 192.10 B: i don't know if they went ahead with it or what but that's what they were proposing 

191.95 199.16 A: yeah i don't know i don't think i don't think things like that can really fly ah people people will create enough of a stir when 

192.73 193.74 B: (( mhm )) 

199.47 200.87 A: (( you know when )) 

200.93 205.89 A: you know personal security is protected at such a high cost 

205.48 211.82 B: i would hope so but i mean they've passed some crazy stuff the patriot act went through it's like we had no say it was all 

211.67 221.61 B: it was all the law makers you know the senators and and and those guys just passed it right on through and and went back later now they're making a big deal out of it saying what did we pass and 

220.98 229.77 A: yeah yeah granted i mean but i mean it was it was it was passed at an extremely vulnerable time and you know it's been well it's almost been two years now since 

229.67 237.97 A: since all that happened and so people people are being a little more thoughtful and not you know running on their gut reaction these days so much 

237.85 239.18 B: right 

238.88 251.85 A: and so i mean there there's there's some kind of ah ridiculous regulations that are passed with with all the airport security thing you know you know somebody sneaks a bomb in on their shoes and now everybody takes off their shoes i mean it's always kind of 

250.65 252.39 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

251.85 264.74 A: it's like it's like kind of like toys you get in cereal boxes have you ever noticed how whenever you get something in a cereal box it's like it was last year's trend or something like that i remember getting pogs in a box of cookie crisp like 

264.50 273.23 A: six months after pogs went out of style you know went out of went out of vogue and that's kind of how the same thing airport security functions it's like well you know 

264.57 265.78 B: (( oh really mhm )) 

267.11 269.20 B: [laughter] 

273.01 281.34 A: somebody tried to put a bomb in their shoes so now everybody has to take off their shoes and while everybody's taking off their shoes you know somebody's doing something else hiding i don't know 

279.41 282.07 B: right yeah 

281.84 290.00 A: hiding hiding you know separate amounts of chemicals that put together could create an explosive reaction or something like that i don't know [laughter] 

289.74 301.17 B: yeah that makes a lot of sense what you're saying though i mean it's like they they're they're doing a hindsight protection you know once somebody once somebody does something then we'll protect against it instead of i don't 

296.48 297.66 A: pretty much 

300.87 313.18 A: yeah i i think i think also i think also a lot of it is just very ah is very symbolic too i mean it crea- it creates an air of security which makes people themselves feel more secure 

312.22 321.76 B: know oh totally spin control tactics advertising it's like advertising in government kind of thing you know ah influencing your consumer your citizen 

314.47 316.62 A: (( yeah )) 

322.08 323.69 A: absolutely 

322.22 325.06 B: make them think they're safe yeah mhm 

324.08 326.74 A: well see something like that happened ah at the 

326.61 340.73 A: at the school i was going to they had ah for a long time they didn't check i._d. cards to get into buildings and stuff and then some guy went running around in a black mask and tried to attacking some girl like on the eighth floor of a building so then after the fact you know everybody starts having to show 

340.63 354.65 A: ah you know our student i._d. cards to get into the building which really doesn't you know create that much that much more security by any means because anybody can go into the bathroom and put on a black mask and go chase a girl down on the eighth floor but it just makes it just makes people feel safer 

351.76 352.69 B: right 

354.30 355.37 B: mhm 

354.57 361.73 A: if that i mean i don't know i mean if that has any kind of value whatsoever i i mean i suppose it does 

361.16 365.26 B: they want to be seen as responding to as being responsive to the threat or whatever 

364.64 379.14 A: yeah yeah exactly so maybe it's not so much that i mean of course you know there's going to be there's going to be an infinite num- number of loopholes in airport in any kind of you know security as you know high profile airport security 

376.57 377.52 B: yeah but the 

378.51 388.91 B: crazy thing though is that they keep i mean like we said people are going to get around it and get around it and get around it but if they keep implementing new new ah ways to ah 

389.02 393.68 B: to investigate you or to screen you or to you know search you i mean 

393.73 402.06 B: what's it going to be like twenty years down the road are you going to be taking your shoes off are they going to be shoving a probe up your you know what you know i mean 

402.11 410.56 B: if if they keep going forward another step that's kind of like i don't know it's kind of like they they're baby stepping us into a big brother culture i think 

410.57 411.63 A: mm 

410.74 412.63 B: could be a possibility mhm 

412.02 422.61 A: well per- perhaps i don't know i mean the way the way i've seen kind of the whole the whole airport security thing functioning in the last couple of years is not so much that it becomes you know 

422.48 432.54 A: increasingly more difficult to get past check points but it's almost like they they cycle through different procedures i mean i haven't had to take my shoes off the last like three or four times i've flown a 

432.43 435.13 A: commercial airline within the united states 

434.99 446.61 A: you know that would that would you know that was that was like last that was like last year's fashion you know for airport security you know so now they're into you know now they're proposing proposing different things you know 

440.78 442.21 B: (( mhm right )) 

446.45 454.25 A: it's kind of it's kind of you know it's always kind of shifting and changing to to fit that the needs of the specific time 

453.60 455.10 B: that's true yeah 

454.64 455.83 A: i mean i 

456.05 470.78 A: mean i don't see overall like airport security becoming that much more problematic it's it's a little bit more of a pain in the ass and you have to get to the airport a little earlier wait in line a little longer but i mean i don't think it's growing exponentially by any rate 

470.78 482.18 B: right [noise] well i mean if you look back though i mean you can go back a certain amount of time and if you look at the trend over time it's toward increasing security and increasing invasion of our privacy 

482.19 487.08 B: so i mean if you kind of go if you move forward what's the natural progression going to be it's going to be 

487.33 489.74 B: you know it's going to continue to increase 

489.86 495.03 B: i don't know i think if they do things slow enough then people don't tend to notice 

495.08 500.04 B: and once they get you used to one thing then they can slowly you know keep moving in that direction 

501.62 508.42 B: we'll see i think it will be a big there will be a a big change if another terrorist attack happens in this country 

501.67 502.87 A: yeah 

507.18 516.62 A: you know see yeah i think i think i think that's going to be the really determining factor you know ah right now people i mean people 

512.54 513.30 B: mhm 

516.68 520.83 A: aren't being directed by fear so much as they were like two years ago 

520.62 521.84 B: (( right mhm )) 

521.12 523.05 A: you know pretty much i mean 

522.99 533.86 A: you know when something as terrible as like nine eleven happens people you know don't i mean they're not thinking in the long term they're thinking in the short term and you know the short term passes something like the patriot act and you know 

525.27 526.51 B: mhm 

533.65 538.62 A: delays flights for like two hours and you know people feel better because of that but people are starting to get 

538.43 550.52 A: used to things again and you know once once they start feeling a little more comfortable and in their element you know they start ah they start thinking a little they start thinking a little more instead of acting on impulse or instincts or out of fear 

551.21 556.91 B: mhm i wonder if i wonder if the terrorists are actually going to i mean is this just going to be an increasing trend as 

551.57 552.63 A: (( so )) 

557.03 558.41 B: we move forward 

558.78 572.65 B: or is it going to you know is this ever going to die out now that it's at i mean after it happened a little people a lot of people said that this is just something we are going to have to de- deal with this is a new era and you know in world history this is how 

572.86 574.65 B: wars were going to be fought 

575.00 581.29 B: on a terrorist basis rather than you know small extremist groups and that kind of thing it's just going to continue to pro- proliferate 

577.18 578.39 A: yeah 

581.26 593.31 B: so i kind of wonder if that's true and you know i mean that's if it does go that route then i guess we could be living in a very different world and dealing with a lot of [noise] different issues 

592.97 594.62 A: yeah absolutely 

594.57 599.89 B: and i i do think the technology thing like the computer things i can't believe they haven't linked all the computers together yet 

594.64 595.50 A: um
