16.28 17.24 B: uh-huh 

20.72 24.85 B: okay [laughter] okay [laughter] it's nice meeting you matt 

24.33 25.74 A: yeah nice to meet you too 

25.26 33.30 B: yeah okay [laughter] so what you do think about airport security that whether it really uh lessens the chance of terrorist attacks in the air 

26.29 27.28 A: [laughter] 

33.08 34.15 A: um 

34.32 34.90 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

35.27 38.45 A: uh i mean probably not [laughter] 

37.61 39.95 B: oh well okay go ahead 

39.23 40.69 A: yeah well i mean like 

41.23 51.20 A: like supposedly like they the the guys who hijacked the planes on september eleventh like i mean obviously like we don't really know what happened i don't even know how they know that they had box cutters but um 

49.97 51.03 B: okay 

51.21 60.36 A: so like i mean you could sneak some like plastic knife through like i've seen like places that sell like stuff that you could totally get through like airport security like 

55.62 56.77 B: mhm 

60.13 61.17 B: okay 

60.93 67.17 A: you know it doesn't really seem like they're doing that much more i mean i haven't been flying that much lately but um 

65.36 66.61 B: mhm 

67.50 72.56 A: i don't know it just seems like they make you take your shoes off that's about it [laughter] [noise] 

70.46 71.35 B: (( uh-huh )) 

71.60 72.71 B: okay 

73.01 74.10 B: uh-huh 

75.01 76.87 A: i don't know what do you think 

76.04 82.00 B: well i've also been not been flying uh too much lately but uh i do think that the increased uh 

82.15 89.30 B: uh security measures that they do like at least would make the prospective terrorist thinks think once or twice 

88.92 90.47 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

89.47 93.79 B: you know before they decide to carry stuff along with them into the plane 

94.04 108.65 A: yeah like i definitely think they've improved like um at least like identification stuff where like you have to they have to like know exactly who you are you know for you to be able to get on the plane like you have to have all this i._d. and like the ticket has to match up 

94.94 96.36 B: mhm 

103.15 104.07 B: mhm 

104.81 106.12 B: mhm 

106.41 107.33 B: okay 

108.25 109.29 B: (( okay mm )) 

109.29 112.65 A: so i think that's good that's definitely an improvement 

110.72 121.34 B: uh-huh okay well because like i'm not from this country and uh when i came here like three four years back i was surprised to see that uh they let me in just near the gate 

114.68 115.72 A: (( yes mhm )) 

121.43 134.06 B: even though i didn't have like a proper i._d. i i just had my uh driving license for my country and i i didn't have any other identification document from the united states say like the driving license or any i._d. card or something like that 

126.30 127.18 A: uh-huh 

130.52 131.34 A: (( oh huh )) 

134.40 144.08 B: so i had to send see my friend off and um i they let me get into the airport and they they just let me get in too close to the gate 

144.32 157.70 B: and that kind of thing never happens in my country you know like [laughter] you need to produce the proper documents even to get into the you know passenger area in the airport this is just thinking like how how come the security is so lax 

147.74 149.00 A: (( [laughter] )) 

152.50 154.15 A: (( wow [laughter] )) 

157.41 159.02 A: [laughter] 

158.13 159.13 B: (( uh )) 

159.13 167.06 A: yeah i mean i i think like a lot part of it is like the people that work at the airport like i don't know i think now it's like um 

159.60 160.91 B: yeah 

162.32 163.71 B: mhm 

166.84 176.40 A: they're all like se- uh hired by the the government but it used to just be like private companies and like yeah like um like the security guards were just like um 

171.33 172.87 B: mhm the contracts 

174.90 175.81 B: mhm 

176.33 189.39 A: they were like the same security guards that work in like well at least in philadelphia it was i think it was like spectre guard was doing it and they're like shopping mall security guards do like they're they're not like professional like airport security people you know 

179.56 180.87 B: mhm 

184.97 186.02 B: mhm 

188.90 190.77 B: yeah i know mhm 

189.83 192.43 A: (( they don't really know what they're doing [laughter] )) 

191.48 194.97 B: okay [laughter] yeah 

195.76 205.16 B: and uh and like um i i've actually not been flown lately and since like i'm from a different country like i don't know how it used to be before uh travel 

205.49 211.11 B: so do you really think there like value there are like more delays coming up in the flights in these days 

210.55 212.45 A: mm yeah um 

212.84 215.25 A: it definitely takes a lot longer to get on the plane 

215.02 216.09 B: mhm 

215.53 216.61 A: like um 

218.36 224.72 A: you pretty much have to get there like at least two hours before your flight if you want to if you want to make it on time so 

220.99 222.05 B: yeah 

223.05 224.32 B: mhm 

224.74 230.63 A: like uh i mean it always took a while but now it's like ridiculous 'cause like they're always doing like 

228.61 229.72 B: [laughter] 

230.45 243.40 A: like they do a lot more of the um like random searches like it's happened to me a couple of times where like you'll walk through the metal detector and like you won't even set it off but they'll like pull you aside and um use like the thing like the uh handheld thing on you 

236.02 237.42 B: mhm 

239.63 240.78 B: yeah 

242.92 244.94 B: yeah [laughter] 

243.60 246.40 A: so that that's happened to me a bunch of times 

245.43 258.25 B: yeah i just once carried my laptop into the security uh stuff they totally i was supposed to put my laptop in the basket and pass it along which i didn't know like had i done that i would have gotten out in like just thirty seconds 

253.02 254.04 A: oh okay 

257.95 259.07 A: mhm 

258.28 262.68 B: and i forgot to do that and uh i just carried my laptop in the backpack 

262.51 263.54 A: uh-huh 

262.92 273.61 B: so it made a beep sound that something and they called me over and uh they did something with my laptop you know [laughter] they brought some scanner close by and like you know 

273.81 275.76 B: (( did i )) 

276.86 279.13 B: don't know [laughter] 

278.55 279.50 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

279.23 289.22 B: (( they put the scanner all along the laptop on the sides and stuff and like looked at my shoes and my valet and which i don't think they would have done like had i )) 

284.86 285.97 A: [laughter] 

289.28 291.28 B: (( passed my laptop through the belt )) 

291.02 292.92 A: yeah [laughter] 

291.69 292.72 B: (( yeah mm )) 

293.82 294.84 A: um 

295.23 303.28 A: you do i guess i don't know if you've have you flown since um like they have like army guys in the airport now 

303.41 313.27 B: oh army no no you mean like no i haven't seen them actually the last time i flew was in february yeah i haven't flown since uh 

304.83 306.59 A: (( you haven't seen them )) 

309.75 310.74 A: oh okay 

313.83 318.11 B: so that time like i didn't see any uh army guys in the airport what about them 

317.74 328.33 A: oh i was just going to ask like do you does that make you feel any safer when you see like soldiers with machine guns standing in the airport [laughter] i don't know like like 

321.64 323.08 B: mhm 

323.20 326.00 B: yeah yeah 

327.35 330.60 B: i mean sometimes i also get a bit uneasy you know 

330.75 331.97 B: (( [laughter] mm )) 

331.38 333.05 A: yeah 

334.13 335.15 B: yeah 

334.33 339.63 A: i don't know i just feel like uh there's like an occupying army like in our country when i see like 

337.33 338.03 B: (( [noise] )) 

339.38 341.15 B: mhm 

339.43 349.77 A: soldiers with sub machine guns in like train stations and like airports you know like kinda it's kind of unnerving to me i don't like i don't like it 

346.18 357.50 B: mhm yeah i believe there are people have like two different views uh few people think that such measures aren't necessary and like you know they only introduce long delays 

350.91 352.10 A: yeah 

357.33 358.46 A: (( [noise] )) 

357.79 365.62 B: and like the reason they are putting forward is like you never used to do this before and why do we need to do it now 

365.60 366.40 A: yeah 

365.71 369.59 B: and there are other people who are saying that well we 

369.69 372.84 B: never did this before and that's why we need to do it now 

373.91 378.75 B: we took all these things for granted and that's the other side of the view 

379.09 380.39 A: yeah 

382.18 383.25 B: (( [mn] mhm so )) 

383.26 385.07 B: how many minutes are left 

384.52 389.65 A: [laughter] i don't know this is only the second one i've done [laughter] 

387.77 391.04 B: [laughter] uh-huh oh this is the first uh call or 

391.37 397.02 A: what's that uh this this is this is the second time they've called me the last time i had to talk about uh september eleventh 

396.78 399.79 B: okay so when when was that like today or 

399.61 401.20 A: oh that was yesterday [noise] 

400.69 402.43 B: oh okay uh-huh 

401.51 403.43 A: yeah i just signed up [laughter] 

403.07 404.02 B: okay 

403.81 405.66 A: but um 

406.47 418.64 A: yeah i don't know i guess like i kinda think that there's pretty much like no way to like guarantee that you're going to be safe like you know there's always like ways around everything [noise] like no matter what they do like 

414.83 415.79 B: mhm 

416.00 417.04 B: mhm 

419.06 422.06 A: i don't know there's always like loopholes and like 

421.89 434.18 A: supposedly like there's like evidence that shows that like there were like inside men um that like planted stuff on the planes and like i don't know i just don't think you can like take all that into account so [noise] [noise] 

426.73 428.07 B: mhm 

428.96 430.30 B: mhm 

431.96 433.23 B: (( uh okay )) 

434.38 441.28 B: mhm well actually you think about this like the guy who got caught on the plane from britain or france like from europe to the united states 

441.53 443.54 B: reid john reid 

443.23 444.83 A: oh yeah yeah 

443.73 453.17 B: yeah they they got the bombs in his shoe like when he was flying and i think like one of the reason that could have been possible was because of the increased security measures nobody knows 

453.08 462.37 A: yeah yeah 'cause i mean no one like had suspected like people were going to like put shit in their shoes [laughter] and then he did it and now like we look in the shoes but now like 

453.60 454.45 B: (( yeah )) 

462.15 476.29 A: you know we might not think that someone would like eat a bomb and like now they're going to start like eating bombs and like have it in their stomach and like how are we going to what are we going to do about that you know i don't know [noise] [laughter] it's like un i just think that like there's always going to be ways around it [laughter] 

467.35 468.42 B: mhm mhm 

470.58 471.92 B: okay [laughter] 

475.51 477.41 B: [laughter] okay 

477.68 482.69 B: yeah like whenever like i fly i think i would wear sneakers instead of those leather shoes 

483.96 487.26 B: i don't know leather shoes have some metallic component inside i guess 

487.53 497.37 B: so like whenever i cross it beeps and like i have to take them off [laughter] with all the baggage by my side and it's funny you know 

501.42 505.59 A: (( [laughter] oh yeah i don't know though i mean like )) 

505.26 506.19 B: (( mm uh-huh )) 

506.20 512.92 A: uh like it it's kinda weird though like it they've like done all this stuff to airport security but i i guess it's 'cause like 

512.75 525.89 A: you know you can't really like drive a train into a building but [laughter] like like i ride trains and buses all the time and it is so easy to like get stuff on those like if you wanted to like there's no security on like 

515.96 517.33 B: mhm 

523.40 524.40 B: yeah 

525.48 526.49 B: mhm 

525.91 529.67 A: on trains or buses [noise] like it's ridiculous 

527.30 528.36 B: okay 

529.85 536.70 A: so i don't know like i mean say like a a guy just wanted to like transport something you know like a bomb like [noise] 

536.32 537.34 B: (( mm mhm )) 

536.75 546.97 A: he could easily get it from like one city to another just by taking it like on a bus or a train and that kinda makes me a little nervous [laughter] 

542.39 543.85 B: (( okay i )) 

545.49 552.75 B: yeah i think like still if they had have concentrated more on like air flight i mean planes and you know and the air space 

552.53 553.87 A: yeah 

552.75 564.62 B: because it involves more than one country it's much more complicated economic costs are high and you can block them from the united states but if you're not able to block from the other country where the flight commutes to 

556.99 558.73 A: mhm 

565.46 572.08 B: a lot of complications are there and i think like they should they should at least like keep doing these steps for some more time 

572.84 577.20 B: while like making sure that um they are not uh 

577.44 581.89 B: uh introducing a lot of time delays and inconvenience for the passengers mhm 

581.24 583.11 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

584.45 587.79 A: i mean do you think it would help if they just had like more screeners 

588.10 599.19 B: i uh don't know you know what interesting thing is like one of the reports that i read it says that out of uh the cargo shipments that come into the united states through the shipyards 

592.53 593.28 A: (( mhm )) 

598.65 599.71 A: mhm 

599.36 599.89 B: (( only ))
