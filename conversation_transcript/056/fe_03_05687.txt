28.10 29.15 B: me neither

41.66 42.64 A: um

46.73 48.75 A: yeah i don't know man um we 

50.41 52.62 A: could probably talk about the past and ah

58.00 60.16 A: (( i don't know i guess america's uh uh )) 

63.25 65.40 A: america's way of dealing with um 

66.19 68.90 A: our fear of other countries how that started 

70.35 71.87 B: i guess um 

72.40 74.70 B: i feel what we do is that we 

74.73 77.63 B: create all these distractions so that we don't 

78.00 81.04 B: aren't able to think about what our what we're doing 

80.99 82.79 A: right you mean in in america 

82.73 84.21 B: yeah 

83.62 85.57 A: right 

85.18 86.11 B: um 

87.05 88.92 B: uh i guess 

88.97 89.76 B: it's 

89.86 95.94 B: in some way good that we help israelis just from a biblical standpoint but 

95.69 97.24 A: right 

96.74 101.00 B: sometimes that seems exaggerated and 

99.36 100.91 A: mhm 

101.42 107.31 B: when you look back at the nineteen fifties and the cold war and the russians nothing really ever happened [laughter] 

107.09 114.36 A: right i was actually i was actually going to talk about that i think a lot of the fears that are based on um you know 

115.06 119.39 A: our thinking of oth- oth- other countries as threats i think stems from the cold war 

120.33 121.70 A: i think it's part of 

120.54 127.03 B: well just war in general you know al- there's always been all these seems like every generation has this 

128.81 132.00 B: big enemy that never is the enemy 

132.06 132.92 A: right 

133.48 137.69 A: yeah i just i just started reading about the cold war recently i'm i'm a history major so 

137.51 139.08 B: mhm 

138.41 146.87 A: i've been getting into it and it's it seems like pretty much even that was exaggerated with the cold war you know um stalin and ah 

147.62 149.54 A: everything after world war two 

149.61 152.02 A: just everything was exaggerated 

152.24 154.58 B: right and if you apply 

155.03 163.15 B: what happened fifty years ago to how we're bombarded with all these stories of fear and ah 

163.30 166.63 B: that it's actually is used to control us 

166.58 173.45 A: right probably half the people you talk to too i think most people would agree with us saying that you know 

168.31 169.47 B: and 

173.59 175.52 A: most of the fear is exaggerated 

175.65 180.64 A: um i haven't met a lot of people who really feel that you know ah 

181.11 184.22 A: any of the arab states um iraq 

184.25 186.58 A: none no- nobody i know 

186.61 189.67 A: can actually truly say that you know they're a big threat 

190.12 191.21 B: no i know 

190.20 192.53 A: (( i-i haven't spoken with anybody )) 

192.53 195.11 B: up here in new york people 

192.71 193.78 A: (( who can say that )) 

196.02 200.20 B: are very wary because of nine eleven 

199.85 201.18 A: right 

201.43 208.26 B: but now more and more people are really wondering how much did the government really know and um 

208.59 211.28 B: you look at america's economy 

212.78 218.86 B: and it seems quite clear that we're leveling the playing field and no one has any money and as we move towards 

218.96 221.09 B: a globalized marketplace 

221.03 221.73 A: (( yes )) 

221.55 227.53 B: everyone's there's going to be no middle class and there's hardly any entrepreneurs really left 

227.37 228.23 A: right 

227.86 236.38 B: and it's just going to be ninety eight percent people just getting by every day and then two percent has all the wealth 

236.63 238.39 A: right 

237.95 240.71 B: you know and um 

240.79 244.89 B: so that's why i say our greatest enemy is ourselves 

245.74 250.88 B: and there's so much secrecy in the government we don't really know hardly anything 

250.61 251.70 A: right 

252.50 255.54 B: and this has become 

255.97 262.37 B: a pet project for governments now is to keep their own constituency 

262.45 264.28 B: um at bay 

264.07 266.52 A: mhm 

267.02 271.46 B: you know and i don't see any difference between democrats and republicans either i think that's another 

271.77 273.17 A: yeah it's 

272.72 281.76 B: big falsehood you know we have all these romantic visions of our government but i don't think they have romantic visions of us [laughter] 

281.12 283.32 A: (( right right )) 

284.41 285.82 B: and uh 

286.20 287.10 B: so 

287.57 292.78 B: i don't really know about how much more we can say about ah enemies 

293.46 297.81 A: (( yeah um i don't know ten minutes )) 

298.50 300.58 A: (( seems maybe like five or six right now )) 

300.70 301.37 B: [laughter] 

302.68 303.72 A: um 

304.65 309.03 A: we could we could try to ramble try to stay on course with what's going on 

309.53 310.58 A: um 

311.51 314.65 A: (( as far as secrecy uh )) 

316.00 318.61 A: how much do you think the government should be telling us 

319.35 321.07 B: everything 

320.47 321.66 A: yeah 

322.16 332.52 B: yeah i mean the population of america collectively is just as intelligent as the com- as the collection of all the people who work for the government [laughter] 

331.95 333.14 A: right 

332.38 341.99 B: you know i don't find the people who work for the united states government are brilliant intelligent and in some cases they're not even loyal you know i mean 

341.27 342.94 A: right 

342.27 343.24 B: there's 

343.59 344.57 B: (( you know )) 

344.83 347.26 B: more than just the rosenbergs who 

347.32 348.20 B: (( ah )) 

348.60 350.83 B: have the ability to be traitors 

350.99 355.83 B: but even with the rosenbergs who did they who were they traitors to and what ever happened nothing 

356.41 358.09 B: i think 

357.19 359.66 A: [mn] [laughter] i'm sorry who who were the rosenbergs 

360.12 366.21 B: ira and julian rosenberg they were a jewish couple who 

366.74 368.33 B: were ah 

368.36 371.04 B: convicted of giving 

371.08 374.32 B: secrets to the russians in the height of the cold war 

374.38 376.25 B: i'm pretty sure that's what it was 

374.55 375.32 A: right 

376.50 378.99 A: (( right i'll have to read up on that )) 

378.22 380.02 B: yeah um 

381.36 383.10 B: but even still 

384.49 392.31 B: what do all these secrets and everything else prove people go through their whole generations and then they die and 

392.58 394.61 B: in the final analysis 

394.74 398.04 B: the government has a lot of your money that you made 

398.12 402.11 B: and you don't even see where it goes [laughter] 

402.47 403.45 A: that's true 

404.73 407.99 B: it's sure not going under i ninety five [laughter] 

407.36 408.34 A: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

408.55 411.39 B: it's sure not repairing the bridges and infrastructure 

414.14 415.05 B: and i 

416.40 421.36 B: guess that you know we're using all this technology really to spy on our own people 

422.71 425.23 B: because we're going to 

425.83 433.82 B: apparently if we haven't already done it proceed with the star wars thing that reagan wanted to do which was never proven to work 

432.33 433.12 A: right 

434.31 437.69 A: (( yeah i know i know bush ah got that started when he came into office [mn] )) 

436.88 438.03 B: pardon me 

437.77 441.16 A: i'm sorry i know bush started that when he came into office 

442.73 444.63 B: this bush or daddy bush 

445.29 446.41 A: george bush 

446.78 448.79 A: no th- the bush that's in office now 

449.38 450.32 B: pardon me 

450.39 453.59 A: he wanted to enact that plan the star wars plan right 

453.29 456.24 B: no ronald reagan wanted to do that in the eighties 

456.33 461.36 A: oh but i thought when bush came in he actually got it started i didn't think reagan started it yet 

461.01 463.37 B: no it was reagan's pet project 

463.29 464.95 A: (( right right )) 

464.35 465.32 B: um 

466.43 469.29 B: so many of these things begin with reagan 

469.56 471.18 A: (( mhm right )) 

470.36 471.61 B: which of course 

471.98 473.62 B: you know is 

473.91 477.47 B: five hundred people behind him it's not just ronald reagan alone 

480.62 486.69 B: but yeah they want to do this tracking system where they can basically know where anybody is 

486.70 488.97 B: all the time 

488.17 488.78 A: (( mhm )) 

489.43 497.78 B: and sure it sounds like something with this big scary terrorist idea 

499.27 501.49 B: but in reality um 

502.31 514.00 B: it can track every american and even follow your car and everything you know so it's a big satellite system and 

509.20 510.06 A: (( right )) 

514.89 517.21 B: then the star wars system 

517.37 521.94 B: is based on the idea that if anyone tries to send an inter ballistic missile 

522.64 523.86 B: and attack 

522.80 523.82 A: (( take it out exactly )) 

524.27 525.87 B: america that it'll 

526.63 534.11 B: sit there on our ah coastlines and destroy the missile before it comes to anyone else 

533.89 535.05 A: right 

535.13 538.48 B: that's the star wars idea 

538.83 543.85 B: and i've actually seen tests of it it is it can work 

543.60 545.28 A: mhm 

545.31 550.36 A: yeah i i've heard about the star wars idea where you could take out any type any missile any distance 

551.13 554.78 A: the satellite i didn't know the satellite system was a part of the star wars plan 

555.17 561.46 A: i just i've i've heard of satellites you know having that type of power but i didn't think it was part of the star wars plan 

560.78 562.56 B: the tracking system 

562.26 563.26 A: yeah 

562.69 566.64 B: i think they clump it on to the same thing you know stuff in the sky 

567.14 570.47 B: there was a big story about it in the new york times last week 

569.88 571.12 A: (( really )) 

570.68 571.45 B: mhm 

571.99 572.94 B: um 

574.84 576.37 B: trying to think what else 

577.47 580.01 B: i could mention about 

580.04 581.16 B: enemies 

583.48 584.45 B: um 

585.35 588.42 B: i think it's very interesting though that overseas 

588.46 590.81 B: the european union 

591.90 594.34 B: basically the united states of europe 

594.35 595.44 A: (( uh-huh )) 

594.50 599.95 B: is voting on their own constitution and their own little flag and their own little song and their own little
