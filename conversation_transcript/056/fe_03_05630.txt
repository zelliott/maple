0.11 1.99 B: hi this is andrew 

2.00 4.03 A: hi my name is gary 

4.94 7.09 A: and i live near dayton ohio 

7.71 10.99 B: great are we talking now i guess ah without the machine 

10.80 12.04 A: i think so 

11.48 19.15 B: [laughter] all right gary well so i guess they got us on a topic here about athletes and their and ah 

19.04 32.36 B: whether they strike and you know how we feel about that and ah you know i guess how we feel about athletes with getting paid their high salaries and such and ah so what do you think about that 

32.51 39.00 A: well basically you know i would expect them to make pretty good money but 

37.62 38.53 B: mhm 

39.05 46.58 A: the biggest problem i see with the the really high salaries that they're running right now is that it drives ticket prices up 

45.92 47.36 B: yeah that's true 

47.06 53.14 A: and i mean if you want to go to a baseball game and take a family you're you're looking at a hundred dollar bill 

52.47 54.16 B: right right right 

53.39 56.89 A: and just a matter for myself i have two boys 

56.65 57.61 B: sure 

57.29 60.00 A: and you know it's just not an option 

59.67 61.58 B: yeah yeah it it 

60.62 64.74 A: i watch it on t._v. if it's on if not well i have a nice day 

64.33 70.21 B: yeah no no that's that's totally true i i also agree that like to a point 

70.02 80.00 B: that you know they should get paid the high salaries but on top of which ah these folks get endorsement deals that make their salaries 

79.81 90.67 B: look like chump change so it's just kind of like well you know i mean if they're going to get paid for paid such huge amounts of money for endorsement deals 

90.48 99.55 B: you know and even on the lowest end of endorsement deals you know i mean in one one decent endorsement deal well that's say that's like you know 

99.67 112.67 B: you know thirty thousand dollars for an endorsement deal and then on the high end you're talking about you know maybe several million dollars just to do a t._v. or radio spot i mean you know it just gets to be like okay 

112.51 125.95 B: you know if you're if you're talking about a ah twenty or thirty million dollar um sports contract and then on top of that you add endorsements contracts they're getting away with highway murder that's for sure you know 

125.94 132.69 B: but what you're saying about um you know it driving up the ticket costs then yeah i totally see that 

132.41 134.28 A: (( oh absolutely and of )) 

134.74 140.95 A: course they have a limited time frame to make their money but but then again i i 

138.68 140.36 B: yeah well 

141.08 147.73 A: work long hours and and years and years and years to make a very small salary 

144.67 145.45 B: [laughter] 

147.32 148.73 B: right yeah 

147.85 152.93 A: and so i you know one of these guys make more in one year than i make in a lifetime so 

152.12 153.56 B: absolutely 

152.95 157.25 A: when you say they've got a really short time frame that's partially true 

157.00 158.23 B: yeah 

157.86 166.20 A: but ah of course with the ah trading situation in a lot of the leagues where they can pretty much hold a gun to the head of the ah 

166.34 171.98 A: managers and owners as to what their salaries are going to be it's a it's a pretty tough game 

171.65 174.32 B: yeah no it's really it's really true 

174.38 177.66 B: i just think it's a but still you know even 

177.65 190.91 B: even at the high cost of salary okay um even if let's say let's say the guy has a has a a five year run of of working as a professional athlete 

190.79 199.88 B: you know five years and it's a and it's a twenty million dollar contract you and i will never see that kind of money in our lifetimes [laughter] 

199.14 201.10 A: not at all 

199.80 207.26 B: so i mean these guys are it's just it's it's nuts you know i mean i think that you know maybe there should be some sort of 

207.18 210.57 B: reasonable cap on it you know i mean 

210.46 217.54 B: yeah i mean i don't mind if they make a if they make a couple of million dollars you know but when it starts getting to be 

217.41 219.06 B: like you know 

218.90 229.55 B: ten twenty thirty million dollars for a contract or what that's just insane that's just that's just like okay you know you guys are taking advantage of the situation 

229.37 237.67 B: and and in turn you're also you know hurting the regular guy like you who wants to go with his boys 

237.43 248.87 B: to the ah to see the ball game or whatever and the cost of tickets you know before you turn round it's ah you know over a hundred dollars for just an afternoon you know 

248.81 252.63 B: and it's just it's just wrong you know 

252.12 260.27 A: well right now i was i was reading something on the internet that eight of the professional baseball teams are looking at going under 

260.35 262.29 A: in the next five years 

261.42 263.46 B: and the reason being [laughter] 

263.24 264.42 A: salaries 

263.80 265.75 B: yeah they can't do it 

265.26 267.06 A: and your idea of a cap 

267.08 272.90 A: and i i really think that salaries should be tied to a performance um bonus structure 

272.27 273.85 B: (( absolutely ab- )) 

272.96 277.16 A: if you don't produce hey charlie you don't make that much money 

276.52 284.89 B: absolutely yeah that's i mean you know that's that's regular that's just regular business one on one that you know i mean even in the regular business world you know if you 

284.68 294.62 B: if you show performance and goo- and good work and everything well you know the boss is going to give you throw you a bonus or he's going to throw you ah you know 

294.39 301.12 B: ah a higher salary or whatever you know and it shouldn't just be based on popularity or you know 

300.99 311.64 B: who ah who puts fans in the seats because ultimately if you're doing a good job you're going to put fans in the seats and therefore you should get paid a higher salary 

311.22 313.65 A: (( absolutely right )) 

311.80 326.31 B: you know um but you know i mean just just based on popularity right out of the box of of college you're just right out of college and you sign this huge mondo deal that's you know it's just like 

326.27 339.24 B: you know it it's just ludicrous it's ludicrous and these people haven't play- haven't played one real ah you know quarter of football or one inning of baseball or whatever and they're just 

339.07 352.00 B: i shouldn't say that about baseball baseball you know some of those guys they have to work at it and they have to they really have to come up through the through the minors and stuff like that and that that's a good thing that's that's a good thing you know 

350.02 354.12 A: right i think basketball's probably the worst 

353.54 364.62 B: yeah basketball is is totally the worst some of those some of those kids are just some there there's there was that one case of that one kid just recently this past year 

364.39 377.91 B: he didn't he he decided opted out of h- out of college altogether and just went straight to the pros i forgot who it was exactly but it's a recent case and that's just nuts you know 

377.19 379.47 A: well toby bryant did 

378.87 381.56 B: yeah well you know i mean 

380.79 383.75 A: he's perhaps a special case but 

383.07 392.93 B: perhaps perhaps you know i mean but then again toby bryant wouldn't be anything without without shaquille o'neal you know you put the two of them together and it's like they're unstoppable 

392.82 394.22 A: absolutely 

393.57 399.97 B: but you know i mean without toby bryant you know um you know shaquille o'neal would be nothing and without 

399.86 412.33 B: ah shaquille o'neal toby bryant wouldn't be anything so it kind of goes bo- both ways on that on that but still in all you know just in general you know these these kids 

412.49 414.21 B: [noise] are whoops 

414.75 426.80 B: just ah in in all um you know it's wrong you know they're cheating themselves as well as ah as cheating the general public as far as driving up prices and such 

426.41 432.15 A: oh absolutely you you read historically what people like babe ruth made in their lifetime 

432.17 439.54 A: which was pretty good money at the time but but proportionately they didn't make anything close to what these guys do 

434.24 435.35 B: yeah 

439.11 442.78 B: they did- they didn't have endorsement contracts either [laughter] 

441.94 448.57 A: oh absolutely and and ninety percent of these guys are jerks because they make so much money 

447.64 453.45 B: yeah it's it's it's wrong but you know it's i i don't know i don't know how 

453.36 463.04 B: how you stop it it it's such a spiraling thing that i i don't know you know i mean they they what do we need legislation to stop it i i don't know 

462.28 470.11 A: well what'll stop it is is what we were talking about earlier when the price of tickets gets to the point where they can't fill the seats 

469.66 470.92 B: right 

470.42 472.09 A: that'll slow it down 

472.17 474.29 B: well when it slows it down enough 

472.51 479.31 A: um supply and demand bit if if we're stupid enough to pay that much money to go and see it [cough] 

479.38 481.51 A: then they'll keep getting it 

480.67 495.58 B: yeah i suppose so i suppose so i'm just ah i'm kind of interested to kn- i mean you know if maybe um basketball adopts more of ah what baseball has done with a with a farm kind of league 

495.49 501.08 B: that'll be good and um the with with football now 

500.87 512.29 B: ah you see the one you see the football players that aren't able to get drafted right away right out of college they're going to the arena football league 

511.91 512.75 A: right 

512.08 516.50 B: so that's kind of serving as a farm system 

516.27 518.05 B: as well i don't know 

517.84 531.48 B: what the percentage of players are coming out of that system to go up into the um the n._f._l. but it's certainly there certainly is a proportion of ah 

531.27 533.92 B: players that are coming out of that so 

533.17 535.66 A: it it's really starting to happen 

534.99 536.24 B: yeah yeah 

536.15 544.28 A: well that quarterback for st louis i can't think of his name offhand that won ah superbowl what the heck was his name 

539.84 541.11 B: um 

543.69 547.88 B: i i know who you're talking about but again i i don't i don't recall 

546.88 549.99 A: but he was he was a superstar in the arena league 

549.61 551.67 B: right right right 

550.20 554.00 A: and um i i've seen two or three 

554.02 557.35 A: you know big time stars come out of that and i think you're right 

557.44 567.92 A: and they don't make big bucks in the arena league and quite frankly it it's pretty interesting to watch i this year was the first year that i actually watched arena football and i i thought it was pretty neat 

566.98 580.89 B: yeah it it's fa- it's fast paced and stuff and and those guys tho- a lot of those guys you know are well you know if you say okay there's only a couple of them that that made it out of that league and into 

580.74 582.45 B: the um 

582.40 597.33 B: ah into the n._f._l. the majority of them are just working guys that just hap- they they were good in college or they were good in high school and they just want to keep on doing it but they they hold a regular day job [laughter] 

597.00 598.00 A: right 

597.32 599.96 B: these guys hold and so they're they're they're
