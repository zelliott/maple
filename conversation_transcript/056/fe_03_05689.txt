15.62 17.15 A: (( ah )) 

17.38 21.02 A: (( i would say probably yes )) 

21.07 22.15 B: probably yes 

21.31 30.85 A: i i'd have to include probably um libya's probably not going to be i i think iraq a threat to us 

31.57 35.51 B: what do you what about ah north korea what do you think about north korea 

34.17 39.25 A: north korea absolutely absolutely north korea absolutely 

38.11 43.46 B: then 'cause they're doing their nuclear proliferation and i don't any other countries that you think are 

44.14 47.43 A: that i can think of right off the top of my head um 

48.74 51.81 A: possibly iran but i'm not sure 

51.80 56.69 B: yeah i think actually i- iraq and iran i think they go together in the same category 

54.89 55.85 A: yeah 

56.05 67.22 A: yeah you know they were fighting for a a you know a long period of time and now they've they've kind of gotten together ah with each other and yeah they i think they like you said i think they're kind of together now 

67.35 73.32 B: right so the thing is just iraq iran north korea i guess uh 

73.84 76.15 B: i don't know a- afghanistan's still there 

74.53 85.94 A: and li- li- and libya yeah because of yeah what what libya's done for iraq you know letting the people come in there first of all and then for some of them they were supplying them during the war and stuff 

76.73 78.38 B: libya yeah 

85.88 88.14 B: how about ah saudi arabia 

88.09 91.07 A: no i'm sorry it's syria syria's what i'm thinking of 

90.44 92.74 B: syria right oh yeah 

91.92 94.75 A: syria syria that's what i was thinking of i'm sorry 

93.91 96.08 B: yeah those syrians [laughter] 

95.81 96.75 A: yeah 

96.29 102.21 B: this presumably had saddam in syria for a while and then they kicked him out that's what they were saying on the news 

100.11 100.96 A: that's 

101.67 103.80 A: that's right that's what they have said yes 

103.48 105.75 B: yeah then uh 

105.81 109.70 B: the saudi arabians too they're supposed to be allies of the u._s. and then now they're 

109.89 116.74 B: potentially you know they're a lot of their backers are the al qaeda and all those iraqi and iranian people too 

114.73 122.80 A: yeah yeah i don't think the country itself is is a threat to us but maybe some of the people that are in the country are a threat to us 

122.90 124.52 B: they must have a lot of money 

123.48 124.88 A: in my opinion 

124.85 127.85 B: yeah they have to have a to have a lot of money to fund the ah 

124.97 125.93 A: what's that 

128.02 131.82 B: these fundamentalist movements this al qaeda [mn] yeah 

129.10 133.17 A: oh absolutely absolutely one of the richest countries in the world right there 

132.96 135.75 B: yeah it's 

136.21 140.63 B: i don't know what else we can discuss but is there any other countries that you think 

141.26 152.39 A: not that i can think of i would we discuss ah north korea i think you know like you you'd mentioned it and i think that ah north korea is a a very big threat right now 

152.72 156.60 B: or yeah yeah maybe the south koreans should just invade north korea 

156.55 157.66 A: (( yeah maybe )) 

157.73 160.36 A: (( they tried to once they didn't actually invade )) 

160.78 163.49 A: (( so i don't know i don't )) 

162.71 167.56 B: (( [laughter] yeah i know but but ah let's see )) 

168.81 172.03 B: i guess that i don't know if there's anything anything else ah 

172.26 176.59 A: know 'cause well you know they they're talking about that they've got the nukes now 

176.38 187.40 A: but i guess they don't have the the capabilities of ah um of getting them over to the united states yet but once they actually have the capabilities of getting the long range missiles 

187.28 195.06 A: ah with the nukes on it then then we could be ah you know a re- in a lot of threat you know from ah ah north korea 

194.88 203.92 B: you know that might not not be such a so big of a deal any more y- you people might not be using uh i._c._b._m.s to launch nuclear warheads any more you see the 

202.93 205.93 A: (( they might not they may well be bringing them in in suitcases now )) 

205.66 210.01 B: yeah suitcase arms like like the movie the sum of all fears did you see that 

210.08 211.22 A: see which one 

211.02 212.66 B: the sum of all fears 

213.32 215.91 A: no i did not 

214.80 222.68 B: um the other recent movie that uh presumably a nuclear weapon mounted in like a vending machine that they launched through it that they imported it in 

222.66 223.66 A: okay 

223.36 232.43 B: into ah i think the wa- the d._c. area and then they blew up the whole city which was pretty quite interesting i suppose 'cause it's quite a reality what these things can happen 

231.04 232.52 A: [sigh] sure yeah 

233.24 235.08 A: d- definite reality to that 

233.43 234.16 B: so 

235.19 246.02 B: yeah so it's definitely the the old dogma of people using i._c._b._m.s to launch missiles into the united states that's definitely not a factor any more and you have to worry more about importing these 

240.31 241.23 A: right 

243.92 245.06 A: right 

246.58 254.41 B: these ah weapons in and the possibility of launching dirty bombs s- within the united states so i you have to consider all the other countries that are more ah 

255.17 257.51 B: sneaky that you don't have 

255.51 269.31 A: exactly exactly and now you've now you've got the dirty bombs too where they're using the ah the waste material from the nuclear facilities and making bombs out of those too so that's that's going to be ano- another threat that we have to worry about 

268.51 277.78 B: exactly but um i'm sure all these countries will support all these because the united states as the only superpower left in the world it's on the top of everybody's list 

276.15 277.18 A: (( right )) 

277.72 280.28 A: right right 

280.43 281.40 B: so 

282.18 283.27 B: (( um oh )) 

283.06 285.10 A: this is actually my first phone call 

284.91 287.39 B: yeah actually this is my first phone call too [laughter] 

286.89 289.94 A: (( is it my my wife had her first one yesterday [laughter] )) 

289.33 290.72 B: oh really [laughter] 

290.06 291.75 A: (( yeah )) 

291.44 293.77 B: it's quite quite interesting but 

293.18 293.97 A: yeah 

294.63 298.99 B: [mn] but i guess that there's not much to talk about in ten minutes and [laughter] 

298.50 302.31 A: yeah i can't really think of anything else i don't know [laughter] 

301.45 303.26 B: yeah 

303.87 306.20 B: what else can we discuss 

306.58 307.75 A: um 

308.43 313.26 A: i think i think the soviets are pretty much out of the picture now they're they're pretty much a poor country now 

313.60 316.68 B: yeah they're poor but they still have all the remnants of the ah 

317.00 318.80 B: the cold war and 

318.20 319.91 A: (( yeah yeah yeah )) 

318.97 322.43 B: they've still got a whole bunch of nuclear weapons left over too 

320.13 321.19 A: i think 

321.81 327.26 A: that the the worst thing with them is them trying to sell that stuff to other countries 

327.17 333.98 B: yeah they're not all accounted for so any of these countries could ah [mn] very well just buy one of from them 

328.82 330.63 A: (( yeah )) 

332.93 334.52 A: exactly 

335.35 345.30 A: all it takes is one person that wants to get you know ahead in life and want that extra money and access to a nuclear warhead and all it all it takes is just one person 

345.58 349.94 B: yeah that's all just one little person with a little vendetta 

349.41 351.39 A: yes you got it 

350.97 352.79 B: yeah 

353.61 355.28 B: but 

356.11 357.09 B: let's see 

358.85 365.69 B: actually um just just thinking about that that movie sum of all fears y- you should take a you should see it it's really a 

365.64 374.12 B: good movie to see it brings up a lot of topics about other other countries and just single persons in other countries who might be able to launch an attack on the u._s. 

373.94 376.88 A: i'll take a look at that 'cause i haven't seen that yet 

376.13 381.54 B: yeah it's pretty recent it's not it came out la- last year i believe with ah i 

378.46 379.61 A: is it 

381.61 382.52 A: okay 

382.15 383.63 B: can't remember who was in it 

383.82 385.87 A: so it'll definitely be on video by now 

386.08 388.75 B: yeah it is it's on it's on d._v._d. now 

388.69 389.58 A: okay 

389.68 391.41 B: but um 

392.99 398.92 B: i don't know it's 'cause it's all it is is one country iraq iran syria 

399.22 402.14 B: [mn] practically everything in the middle east so 

401.18 409.93 A: yeah yep yeah that's where the the i think that's where the root of the the major problems are is in the the the middle east 

403.45 404.44 B: yeah 

410.65 418.28 B: you know israel the only ally that we have real ally is israel over there a- a- little tiny country that [laughter] 

415.32 416.38 A: yeah 

417.75 420.32 A: right yeah what good what can they do for us 

420.13 421.65 B: yeah it's surprising 

420.64 422.24 A: not a whole lot 

421.79 424.70 B: yeah it's just surprising that they haven't been taken over yet 

424.43 428.32 A: yeah exactly and they don't even have their own money to to help us out 

428.37 430.13 B: right 

434.87 439.06 B: [mn] i don't think saudi arabia as much and 

439.19 442.91 B: then there's the india pakistan thing that's going on 

442.92 444.24 A: yeah 

443.67 446.32 B: yeah they're they're having nuclear weapons also 

446.61 448.45 A: yep yep 

449.85 451.59 A: oops that's a bad thing 

451.66 452.73 B: (( yeah [laughter] yeah )) 

452.21 453.73 A: that's just a bad thing 

453.83 455.63 A: no matter how you look at it 

455.21 459.81 B: yeah it's going to get worse 'cause people as long as people know how to make them then 

460.41 461.62 B: (( it's always going to be )) 

460.63 465.55 A: oh absolutely it's it's definitely going to get worse before it gets any better i have no doubts about that i 

467.02 470.55 A: mean they must find saddam hussein they have to find him 

470.94 475.29 A: you know 'cause th- they- they can't stop looking for him until they find him 

471.00 471.56 B: (( yeah )) 

474.39 476.90 B: they they can't even find ah osama 

476.74 491.56 A: no i know that i know that but he and i think they need find him as well but saddam hussein i think is is more of a threat to the united states and and our our allies i think that they they must continue looking for him until they find him 

478.53 479.18 B: mm 

491.72 499.14 B: yeah but what do you think about him not having any known nuclear weapons no ah weapons of mass destruction you know they couldn't find any any of those 

497.90 498.80 A: well 

498.94 507.52 A: that's interesting that's interesting 'cause they haven't really found anything yet t- to show that um i don't know i don't know i don't know what to think about that i truly don't 

508.82 513.14 B: mm do you think he could be hiding that down s- down in one of his bunkers somewhere also 

513.08 527.98 A: could be could be [mn] i think i'd i would trust um that our c._i._a. moles that he's got it they're just having trouble finding it i think they i think they're right and he's got it somewhere they're just having pr- having problems finding it 

520.70 521.49 B: (( but )) 

528.08 533.61 B: you figure you know with the c._i._a. with all that information that they have they should be able to find something 

532.65 535.20 A: right exactly 

536.25 538.00 A: i imagine they will eventually 

538.12 539.42 B: eventually mm 

539.65 543.30 A: maybe it'll take finding saddam hussein first 

542.50 548.98 B: yeah they'll be a while looking for him though i think he's probably still going to be in control have a lot of influence over other countries from there too 

545.23 546.10 A: (( right )) 

548.90 551.08 A: right right 

552.53 555.75 B: there was a supposed link between saddam and osama also 

555.85 558.90 A: ah yeah i think you're right i think so 

562.03 562.94 B: (( yeah i don't know i )) 

564.12 568.86 A: that's a long ten minutes [laughter] 

565.78 567.30 B: it is a long ten minutes 

567.65 569.27 B: yeah 

570.14 574.61 B: um an- anything else i could any other countries 

573.17 575.00 A: i can't think of anything else 

574.82 575.57 B: (( no )) 

575.51 579.53 A: no i can't think of anything else um i think for the most for everything else is 

579.98 582.52 A: the rest of the countries is looking pretty good 

581.96 588.19 B: yeah russian republics like chechnya that that might be a pr- problem but that they're 

588.49 590.22 B: they're more 

590.35 592.20 B: toward the russians 

591.74 593.42 A: yeah yeah 

593.71 594.71 B: um 

597.97 599.89 B: i don't know of anything else offhand nothing
