0.46 1.66 B: (( hello )) 

0.78 2.06 A: hello 

2.23 4.83 B: hi my name is perry 

4.38 6.31 A: (( hey what's going on man my name is john )) 

6.28 7.29 B: hey john 

7.48 8.77 B: where are you calling from 

9.02 12.39 A: (( ah i'm calling from the san fernando valley )) 

11.36 14.02 B: oh okay cool i'm in san jose 

14.25 17.58 A: oh right what was the question now 

15.96 17.10 B: so ah 

17.26 23.48 B: ah [laughter] airport security do you think it ah do you think it makes ah everything more secure 

19.11 20.51 A: airport security 

24.17 27.32 A: that's the question do i think it makes ah 

25.47 27.11 B: yeah 

28.20 37.21 A: ah it's hard to say with all that because they were there airports there's always been airport security i guess for the last maybe twenty years there's been airport security 

37.05 38.61 B: mhm 

37.88 48.61 A: you know so it's hard to say if somebody's really trying to do something and make something happen on an airplane or at a airport they could probably do it 

45.84 47.58 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

48.00 50.18 B: yeah yeah i think so too 

50.74 56.55 B: ah i mean you know they they make it harder but if someone's determined like say the shoe bomber [laughter] 

56.53 59.47 A: right right i mean it's 

58.09 60.71 B: they can get something in there 

59.89 67.79 A: i mean it's good too because um just the fact that they say that they heighten it up kind of puts you puts a doubt in the individual you know what i'm saying 

67.64 69.36 B: mhm 

68.31 81.99 A: [mn] so that so that person won't sit there and just move directly and think he he or she can do it but if he or she really wants to do it it can really be done 'cause it's been done and i'm sure it's going to be done again you know 

81.22 83.55 B: mhm yeah 

83.33 89.12 A: so that's how i look at airport security for an- as as far as that aspect of it you know 

89.03 90.81 B: mhm 

89.51 93.03 A: i mean i think it's good for like people like um recently um 

93.13 94.09 A: a few days 

94.30 98.69 A: (( earlier this week um davis he plays for the portland trailblazers )) 

99.01 100.49 A: he tried to um 

99.19 100.77 B: yeah 

100.77 105.43 A: he tried to smuggle a like a ounce of weed in some aluminum foil 

104.87 107.04 B: [laughter] 

105.75 108.82 A: you know what i'm saying dumbass you know what i'm saying 

107.05 107.98 B: okay 

108.85 110.15 B: oh yeah 

108.88 116.55 A: and he got caught so i guess security is good for stupid ass things like that you know i don't know why he would do that but um it 

113.10 114.82 B: [laughter] 

117.72 120.32 A: is good for things like that 

119.95 124.05 B: yeah i don't know if that's the point of it though [laughter] 

123.00 127.31 A: well i'm that is the point is airport security right 

126.58 138.29 B: yeah that's you know someone bringing weed on a plane is not like going to be a real security problem i don't think [laughter] i think they're more concerned about planes f- going into buildings and things like that 

134.52 135.19 A: (( mm )) 

138.43 142.32 A: right right well 

138.60 139.40 B: (( you know )) 

140.56 142.54 B: um i mean 

142.85 144.58 B: from where i stand ah 

144.78 150.30 B: they've shut off one avenue that's commercial [mn] aviation but um 

150.65 156.31 B: i saw this thing on c._n._n. where they said a lot of people a lot of the stories believe now 

156.41 159.48 B: the main security risk from the air is going to be from private jets 

160.09 162.73 A: oh yeah mm 

160.85 163.95 B: yeah not a commercial airliner [laughter] 

164.59 174.04 A: right right i don't know i've never been on a private jet and i doubt if i'll ever get on one you know so i've never thought about security as far as they go 

170.15 173.00 B: (( mhm )) 

173.99 174.71 B: (( mm )) 

174.57 177.79 A: i kind of just look at it as like commercial flights you know 

177.09 179.44 B: mhm mhm 

177.85 182.04 A: 'cause those are the those are the flights that people frequent the most 

182.29 183.96 B: yeah 

182.33 184.60 A: and i i would think with um 

184.81 193.16 A: really we seem like with with ah because of because of the traffic because it's always constantly a different sort of people that it would be easier to do something 

193.00 203.30 A: on a commercial flight than it would on a private flight you know what i'm saying because it's constant flow there's a constant flow of people back and forth back and forth back and forth 

199.37 200.41 B: yeah yeah 

202.16 204.79 B: mhm 

203.87 207.21 A: so it's hard to catch every little thing you know 

207.01 213.22 B: yeah well i guess it makes i guess it makes commercial aviation a lot more safer for everyone 

207.82 208.76 A: i don't know 

213.17 215.56 A: mhm 

213.39 214.28 B: (( you know )) 

214.78 216.89 B: which is a good thing 

216.13 221.18 A: yeah it is good you know we got to still got to use them i remember when ah 

219.77 221.42 B: mhm 

221.31 226.89 A: when that incident happened you know i knew a lot of people that were talking about they won't fly planes any more but 

227.02 232.75 A: i can't see myself jumping on a greyhound to go to somewhere like new york or somewhere like that you know what i'm saying 

232.46 235.26 B: people were saying they didn't want to fly planes 

235.13 241.21 A: yeah like they didn't want to they they now they're leery about jumping on a airplane because of the nine eleven incident you 

241.16 241.87 B: (( mm )) 

241.34 243.32 A: (( know but it's like )) 

243.68 251.00 A: sometimes you got to travel to get far places you know i'm not going to sit there and jump on a greyhound or a train and try to get back east somewhere 

250.79 252.54 B: yeah 

251.04 251.95 A: you know 

252.40 254.78 A: that's ridiculous 

253.81 254.54 B: (( mm )) 

255.37 270.19 A: so ultimately i guess it has it has helped out somewhat because we haven't heard about any other incident happening but prior to that i hadn't heard about any incident happening like that before you know what i'm saying so 

263.63 265.32 B: yeah 

268.97 270.22 B: sure sure 

271.06 274.20 B: just regular hijackings and stuff like that 

271.26 272.24 A: who knows 

273.01 278.72 A: yeah you know regular small things like that that can pretty much be handled but ah 

276.44 278.46 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

278.91 279.82 B: huh 

280.25 286.60 A: we'll see you know in the coming days if somebody uh has the balls enough to try something like that again 

286.91 297.06 B: well yeah i i get the feeling it's going to i don't know ah about you but i i get the feeling there's people out there plotting some more stuff 

297.23 298.46 B: like nine eleven 

297.34 306.43 A: well yeah yeah of course of course i mean there're a lot of thi- a lot of things are going to go down i mean that wasn't the the last by any means 

305.55 308.13 B: right right 

306.28 312.95 A: lot lot of different things are going to happen but whether it's going to be done with airplanes or not you know who knows 

308.70 310.65 B: yeah 

313.25 318.65 B: well probably not any more i don't think i mean i'm pretty sure it's 

313.54 314.62 A: but as far 

316.48 317.30 A: (( mm )) 

318.93 322.66 B: you would take quite a bit to get something going nowadays 

322.19 330.37 A: right as long as i'm not in the plane as long as the plane isn't flying into my house into my apartment building or something i'm straight you know what i'm saying 

324.30 325.37 B: [laughter] 

327.93 329.58 B: [laughter] 

329.99 331.74 B: mhm 

330.31 338.75 A: that's pretty much all i can hope for so i hope the security does stay up [mn] i don't want to look out my walk out on my patio and then see a plane coming my way 

333.93 335.74 B: mhm 

338.66 340.44 B: (( [laughter] )) 

339.02 341.41 A: not too much i could do after that you know 

341.24 343.03 B: mhm 

343.92 345.56 B: yeah 

344.16 345.03 A: (( so )) 

345.93 352.36 A: ah i guess that's really all i can speak on as far as airplane security that's th- that wasn't a good topic whoever chose this 

352.18 353.93 B: mhm 

352.89 355.32 A: there's not really a lot you can speak on 

355.29 357.92 B: yeah i mean 

359.21 366.12 B: yeah to me it's like one of the easier things that got shut off to you i guess terrorists but still there's 

366.72 370.75 B: you know if they're determined that they're going to do other things not just with planes 

367.11 367.91 A: yep 

370.84 374.08 A: yeah it would seem like it would be the easy thing you know 

373.15 375.72 B: mhm 

374.39 380.07 A: just sitting back looking at it like it shouldn't be too hard to handle but hey 

380.08 382.49 A: that shit happens we saw it 

382.47 384.10 B: yeah 

384.35 385.94 B: yeah 

386.79 391.17 B: so [mn] i don't know any other security concerns you have with ah 

391.05 394.42 A: (( as far as the ah as far as airport security um )) 

396.56 403.27 A: no not really you know they have metal detectors so i don't really have to worry about guns being brought on board 

401.92 406.60 B: mhm well they've always had metal detectors seems like 

405.73 409.03 A: yeah that's what i'm saying so that's all 

409.76 413.06 B: i remember before yeah before nine eleven i used to 

409.95 411.34 A: anything else 

413.34 417.59 B: go to the airport and i had this like um 

418.65 421.21 B: what is it you know swiss army knife 

421.32 429.64 B: you know regular size and my brother was telling me hey i can't believe you could take that through the airport [laughter] first time i did that you know the 

422.82 423.71 A: uh-huh 

429.73 438.68 B: person at the metal detector looked at it turned around looked at it all over the place and just handed it back to me [laughter] now they don't even allow that 

438.00 445.42 A: [mn] maybe they should let like the like the airplane airplane pli- pilots have guns something like that 

444.28 445.67 B: i think they do now 

445.59 447.43 A: oh yeah 

446.31 448.08 B: yeah 

447.54 450.79 A: (( oh okay what do you know what kind of guns they let them have )) 

450.22 451.92 B: i i don't know 

451.97 453.89 B: just guns handguns 

453.86 464.03 A: right right well maybe something like that will work but then if somebody really just starts shooting on the plane then everybody on the plane is assed out 

459.29 460.03 B: (( mm )) 

463.48 467.27 B: (( [laughter] sure yeah yeah )) 

464.19 466.38 A: you know what i'm saying so it's like 

467.20 468.99 A: (( a-a trap in itself )) 

468.84 470.55 B: mhm 

470.52 481.33 A: but as far as security goes for them i can't really um 'cause i don't fly that often to even really um maybe i i don't fly like maybe once a year maybe so 

474.76 476.57 B: mhm 

480.09 480.86 B: (( mm )) 

482.49 488.70 A: flying never really put too much i really never put too much thought into airplane security airport security at all 

486.54 488.34 B: mhm 

488.54 490.22 B: yeah 

489.32 490.23 A: you know 

491.36 494.16 B: yeah i'd be more concerned about other things now 

491.47 492.52 A: so 

493.97 507.01 A: yeah yeah there's a lot of different other things i worry about that's kind of like the last thing i worry about the people who these crazy ass drivers out here you know what i'm saying that scares me more than anything people who do not know how to drive 

502.87 503.78 B: [laughter] 

507.09 510.00 B: [laughter] even in the valley [laughter] 

509.20 511.87 A: yeah oh they can't drive out here for shit 

512.05 513.02 A: you know 

512.08 519.61 B: that's funny i had a roommate from new york and he was complaining about california he said when it rains people here don't slow down 

519.78 521.93 A: no no nothing stops 

520.41 522.78 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

521.96 523.45 A: nothing stops 

523.04 528.98 B: he was saying oh back in new york it's like everybody knows you slow down when it rains [laughter] 

529.34 530.31 A: so 

529.57 531.75 B: i just had to laugh [laughter] 

531.68 545.42 A: yeah as for airport security that's kind of like that's pretty much like the on the at the the bottom of the list of things that i concern myself with you know but hopefully it it'll be handled you know so 

540.19 540.92 B: (( mm )) 

545.25 551.13 A: when i do the next time i do need to jump on a plane i don't need to have too many fears too many worries 

551.25 557.06 B: [mn] yeah yeah it sounds like ah it's been pretty much handled uh airport security i guess 

551.33 552.36 A: (( you know )) 

557.21 562.74 A: well we haven't heard about anything else happening but 

557.33 558.30 B: (( i mean )) 

559.87 568.31 B: but then it's pretty inconvenient to fly nowadays [laughter] i mean i haven't flown since nine eleven but you know 

564.55 566.97 A: right right 

572.77 575.33 A: so is the ten minutes up 

574.68 576.62 B: oh no they'll 

577.05 578.08 B: (( ah )) 

578.39 582.22 B: they'll have a message come on is this your first call 

582.53 590.94 A: no this is like the second one i mean i'm beginning to um this is been calling me all week but i i work at night i'm working at night 

589.40 590.32 B: oh 

591.01 599.91 A: um this whole week so i haven't been able to just really sit there and get on the phone so i kind of just like let the phone ring i see it on the uh on the caller i._d. and i 

596.54 597.48 B: (( [laughter] oh )) 

599.11 599.91 B: mhm
