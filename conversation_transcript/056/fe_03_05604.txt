7.36 10.54 A: wow yeah i bet are you from right in the city 

9.94 12.94 B: um no i'm from brooklyn i live close to it though 

12.83 15.68 A: yeah did you know anybody involved in that 

14.24 17.69 B: yeah i do uh one person in my building he was a fire fighter 

17.56 20.29 A: oh wow sorry to hear about that 

18.87 20.89 B: oh thank you yeah 

20.53 32.47 A: uh i'm from um springfield mass area so um it doesn't directly directly affect me and i fortunately i didn't know anybody who was involved with that so but uh 

26.28 27.21 B: yeah 

32.75 34.75 A: yeah it's pretty serious stuff 

33.63 44.75 B: [noise] yeah mm it's affected really bad 'cause like they have like everything locked down now for new york like once the holiday comes they make sure they are like all secured and everything now 

44.51 49.51 A: yeah i go into the city every so often um you know to catch a show or whatever but uh 

49.59 51.05 A: i guess you'd know 

51.13 53.84 A: more about that than i would um 

54.03 56.91 A: i don't know so what was the question what changes have we made 

56.11 57.26 B: (( yes [mn] )) 

57.58 60.34 A: i haven't really made any changes 

60.14 70.75 B: like i would like be careful as i nothing really changed really for me because i got i just knew like that person who was a good friend but like there's not like like my parents 

70.71 79.41 B: like that affected us because we know like we live a building not not close to them like we but i mean like my city has made a very a lot of changes and 

78.79 81.05 A: mhm mhm 

79.83 91.48 B: uh it's very hard like now i mean like th- the airplanes are like so secure now i probably more than anybody now because like you have to take off your shoes they're going on a 

90.39 93.93 A: yeah i flew a little while ago and it was just intense how much 

93.97 95.48 A: security they put on it 

95.01 106.77 B: yeah i see i was i was just used it like a couple like two weeks ago i had to came back for las vegas and they had like all you had to take off your shoes they take they like and if you have like a thing they check you and everything 

106.20 108.79 A: yeah well that that's good i guess 

106.80 109.66 B: it's very secure now yeah it is 

109.09 112.52 A: i'm surprised they don't do that like on trains or buses you know 

112.12 113.43 B: yeah 

113.41 118.87 A: 'cause that'd be just as much a place for anyone to do something like that um [lipsmack] 

116.74 118.38 B: yeah 

119.20 121.60 A: do you think though that like people are 

121.93 125.30 A: still still making a big deal about it 

124.71 136.96 B: well not really anymore i mean like some people like yeah it's very sad like i knew like the mother the kid 'cause she lived in the building too the mother you know they all lived in the building and she got over 

133.66 135.40 A: mhm 

137.00 138.85 B: it that's hard you 

137.66 142.14 A: yeah yeah it's like the worst attack in our history huh 

139.04 139.76 B: (( know )) 

141.22 144.26 B: yeah killed the most people 

144.35 152.20 A: right then like even worse than pearl harbour i guess although i don't know too much about history um 

147.67 148.73 B: yes 

152.56 156.25 A: hopefully there won't be anything like that again i don't i don't know do you think there will 

155.76 166.66 B: no i don't really think so because uh i think they i don't i don't know but i think bin laden i don't know where he is he's probably still alive but he knows that he can't do it anymore 

166.71 168.79 A: that's good 

167.67 170.96 B: 'cause all his weapons uh don't they have they found all his uh 

171.56 177.01 B: they have they only have like two more security weapons he doesn't have that much back up with him 

176.68 182.30 A: i don't watch a lot of the news but whatever happened to him it's like they're they're searching for him and then they start looking for saddam all of a sudden 

181.52 184.25 B: (( yeah like i like i )) 

183.59 186.14 A: do you know why they gave up on looking for him 

185.58 191.39 B: probably because like they probably know where he is but they're gonna do it like when it's least expected 

191.06 192.99 A: oh yeah 

191.50 199.74 B: that's what i think's gonna happen like i don't watch the news that much but like i'll hear about it is i see the paper sometimes but i know like they're going after saddam now 

199.91 200.83 B: but i 

200.16 201.93 A: are you a fire fighter too 

201.74 203.13 B: who me no 

202.62 204.17 A: like the guy in your building no 

203.81 206.62 B: no the guy in my building was i'm only sixteen

417.30 424.83 A: no i mean i i called the bank and they gave me the money back and they're gonna conduct an investigation but it was pretty scary at the time 

421.69 423.49 B: yeah 

424.10 425.25 B: yeah 

426.80 434.54 A: [lipsmack] so anyway getting back to september eleventh i didn't know anybody that was involved my my father did and i who was one of the planes i think that's the 

433.12 434.90 B: she was on one of the planes 

434.66 436.78 A: on one of the planes yeah 

436.20 437.80 B: where in uh

442.62 450.22 A: oh yeah but not not my father my father had a friend who was on the plane yeah yeah yeah that's what i meant and uh 

444.51 445.37 B: oh 

445.90 446.99 B: oh 

450.22 457.86 A: that would just like i can't even imagine that knowing that you're going to die like that at least in the world trade center you might not know it 

454.89 455.86 B: yeah they knew 

457.55 458.81 B: yeah 

458.28 459.84 A: what just happened but 

458.91 462.43 B: but i saw people like there was th- they had uh 

462.48 468.21 B: some shows on it i mean it was really harsh when you saw the shows like if you would see the shows they had they had

468.64 471.36 B: (( yeah it was crazy )) 

470.72 473.29 A: yeah insane 

473.32 480.38 A: but the and then something that pisses me off a little bit is just because of that everybody's gotten so patriotic 

479.79 480.93 B: yeah 

480.40 487.68 A: you know i mean it it's good that they're getting patriotic for the country but but that had to happen for them to do it that had to be the wake up 

485.97 492.25 B: yeah everybody everybody's just doing it 'cause 'cause 'cause of the world trade center i mean if you were patriotic before that 

491.74 498.19 A: exactly exactly but a lot of people just say oh this is really bad so they're gonna put a bumper sticker on their car 

492.49 493.37 B: yeah
