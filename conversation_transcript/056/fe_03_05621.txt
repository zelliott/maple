3.55 4.74 B: pleased to meet you 

4.44 8.54 A: nice to meet you too what what a subject for today 

8.14 10.82 B: (( [laughter] )) 

8.73 11.29 A: sports people 

10.89 12.85 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

11.76 15.57 A: well i'll let you go first how about 

14.52 16.44 B: yeah sure um 

17.32 28.19 B: i'm not that much into sports [laughter] actually but ah i i do believe that it's okay for athletes to go on strike i believe it's fine that they can 

19.02 20.58 A: (( that yeah )) 

28.27 33.29 B: use the the capitalist system to get what whatever they can get 

33.13 34.39 A: yeah 

33.80 38.18 B: ah that being said i do think they're paid too much [laughter] ah 

36.77 38.98 A: yeah 

38.09 42.78 B: um i think what's going on it it's a weird vicious circle that 

42.58 53.26 B: the athletes strike to get more money they they get more money the ticket prices are raised the ah owners get more money [laughter] and ah what happens is the fans pay for it all 

53.15 57.72 B: and i think the fans are too willing to go ahead and pay for it all so 

57.62 58.48 A: (( ah [laughter] )) 

58.28 65.04 B: i think we as fans should pay less and ah [laughter] hopefully try and get some kind of handle on it how about you 

64.19 78.57 A: right i ah that you you bring up some interesting angles on that i i think that they they go through a lot of hard work to get where they're at i would agree with that and ah i think they're way over paid i think it's ah 

73.72 74.54 B: yeah 

74.57 75.36 B: right 

77.41 78.36 B: mhm 

79.03 86.69 A: i think them and ah and ah musicians [laughter] are way over paid only the ones that make it i should say [laughter] 

82.95 85.16 B: [laughter] 

85.27 89.05 B: yeah only the ones that make it right [laughter] 

86.73 97.11 A: yeah but they're so overpaid that gosh they could they in one year's time they could make as much you know as as ah what other people dream for a life time 

93.03 94.29 B: oh yeah 

95.26 96.38 B: oh yeah 

96.67 97.59 B: sure 

97.28 101.71 A: and i think that's just ri- ridiculous going on strike ah 

101.94 110.31 A: ah like you said the system you know it it is it goes along with the system and and that's a good thing ah 

110.31 121.01 A: i'd like to say you know that they shouldn't be able to but then ah you know you have to be able to allow people to have the freedoms for both ways you know whether you like it not whether you agree with it or not 

113.62 114.48 B: mhm 

117.67 118.97 B: right 

120.82 121.68 B: mhm 

120.90 129.54 A: freedom's not based on your own opinion so [laughter] you know so so you made a valid point when you said that and that and that's cool that you said it like that because 

123.71 124.87 B: mhm 

129.56 136.82 A: a lot of times people get so opinionated that they don't they don't allow for the freedoms for everybody because they hate what they're doing 

134.77 136.35 B: (( yeah )) 

136.44 139.25 B: [laughter] yeah 

136.94 138.11 A: you know 

138.20 141.43 A: (( and all of the people seem to want to do that too you know )) 

141.17 142.45 B: yeah 

142.14 152.51 A: but ah i always i'm amazed at how they give you ten minutes to talk about something like this and it's like you can pretty much sum it up in in a couple of minutes 

148.22 149.84 B: yeah 

150.28 153.84 B: (( [laughter] i know )) 

152.83 154.77 A: where are you from

162.63 165.71 A: the last guy was from ah new york [laughter] 

165.41 168.42 B: i don't know where my last one was from [laughter] 

167.35 169.51 A: (( yeah how long have you been doing this )) 

169.28 173.91 B: um oh i don't know two months i think they've been calling me 

172.19 181.55 A: yeah because this guy was telling me from new york that they gave an email that he could only do three of 'em no you can do i didn't think so 

178.59 179.58 B: oh 

181.14 182.22 B: i don't know 

182.30 183.96 B: this is only my second one 

183.77 184.89 A: oh it is 

184.48 185.78 B: yeah 

185.11 196.98 A: oh i didn't i didn't receive that this is my second one also i've been receiving calls but ah i didn't know what it was at first because and i thought who keeps calling fisher what 

188.60 189.42 B: yeah 

193.08 198.17 B: (( [laughter] )) 

197.31 206.38 A: i was tripping out my room mates are going who is this that keeps calling twice a day you know and then i finally figured it out and i was like oh my gosh 

206.08 208.25 B: [laughter] 

206.61 213.41 A: see yesterday was my first real call [laughter] that i took so 

208.94 210.55 B: (( yeah )) 

213.41 220.34 B: so um what sports are you watching at the moment ah what was the latest strike i don't have you heard of any strikes lately 

218.88 228.18 A: you know i'm not familiar i i'm not that much of a sports watcher myself i used to like to play a lot but i've never been much of a of a of a fan 

223.31 224.22 B: yeah 

227.00 229.36 B: did you ever go on strike 

229.09 232.55 A: [laughter] have i ever been on strike [laughter] 

230.38 234.03 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

232.53 245.61 A: ah no i don't think i ever have it it's funny because unions don't seem to have the clout that they used to have and and there's so many ah people that would just walk through you know the the picket line so 

234.45 235.85 B: (( yeah no )) 

239.86 241.20 B: no they don't 

245.51 253.55 B: i've heard that the baseball union is like one of the strongest they don't have to what was it that there was something about drug testing i think that that they can 

248.93 250.58 A: yeah 

253.70 264.61 B: that that they've been circumventing for a long time and all the other sports have to go through these rigorous drug testing and it's a lot more lax for the baseball players 

256.12 257.53 A: really 

263.53 265.29 A: (( you learn something )) 

265.49 266.76 B: (( hm )) 

265.59 270.01 A: i don't know that that would be a good subject for them to have oh they did have drug testing didn't 

270.26 272.00 B: i don't know i haven't heard that one 

270.41 271.06 A: (( they )) 

272.02 276.13 A: i think i think i think i i answered one one one of them oh i didn't 

276.13 290.08 A: actually take the call but i heard that the subject was drug testing i think i didn't hear what the question was exactly because i hung up at the time that was the one that gave me the clue of what was going on and the next call i was like ooh [laughter] whoops 

279.15 280.04 B: (( no )) 

282.34 283.05 B: (( oh )) 

283.47 284.49 B: mhm 

289.86 300.40 A: i mean because i did this somebody told me about it and i emailed and and then i never really received anything back and then and then the calls all of a sudden a month later i think just started to come 

295.81 296.88 B: yeah 

300.05 302.58 B: (( yeah )) 

300.72 302.52 A: i was like wow

321.91 322.74 B: (( and )) 

326.77 328.49 B: mm wow

337.59 342.04 A: i mean i do a lot of hiking and there's lots of lots of mountains and stuff up here 

342.00 349.08 A: you can get away from everything down there you go fishing and it's like you're fighting people i remember [laughter] fighting people it was like

350.70 352.14 B: yeah oh sure

357.73 368.72 B: i heard i heard of two surfers taking each other to court for ah for infringing on their own their other each other's wave or something [laughter] that's how crowded it is down here [laughter] 

365.06 367.12 A: oh really [laughter] yeah 

367.33 379.74 A: [laughter] ain't that something and there's a big there's a big there's a lot of people surfing when i was in santa cruz it's just like a mass of them out 

370.04 371.50 B: yeah seriously 

378.84 381.68 B: oh santa cruz is crazy with it yeah 

380.72 383.49 A: santa cruz is a nice place though 

383.23 385.61 B: it sure is mhm 

384.04 393.84 A: it really is i had some good times up there we we're supposed to still talk about the sports will we get in trouble for talk- will we get in trouble for talking about other things 

390.12 391.29 B: yeah we are 

393.35 396.55 B: i think so i think they'll fire us [laughter] 

395.32 398.59 A: [laughter] 

398.03 400.85 B: that's okay we can go on strike 

399.58 407.87 A: yeah [laughter] there you go well they're certainly not going to you know over pay us [laughter] 

405.80 410.62 B: yeah so how do we beat this strike system what do you think 

410.12 411.14 A: (( mm )) 

410.79 412.62 B: do you have a solution 

412.39 423.16 A: i think that we beat it by ah by their you know yeah that wouldn't beat that wouldn't beat it i don't know i i think that they ought to be able to have an opinion they ought to be able to fight for it 

418.89 419.74 B: yeah 

421.76 431.59 B: i i agree i think exercise their rights but i think it's up to fans to ah stop paying the high ticket prices so that prices come down and and therefore 

428.64 430.68 A: and yeah 

431.64 436.37 B: you know they they won't pay the big giant salaries and things will get more in line 

434.25 436.03 A: yeah 

436.08 446.14 A: i think you're right i think i think if people stand up and say you know hey you guys are just making too much money it's ridiculous there's no ah there's no reason nobody should make a million dollars in a year 

440.36 441.45 B: yeah 

443.79 444.66 B: yeah we 

445.98 446.92 B: yeah 

446.37 447.76 A: just one million 

447.96 453.06 B: oh i'd like to but [laughter] 

449.47 451.99 A: i'd love to i'd love to 

451.81 464.81 A: but think about it i mean if you're making two hundred thousand dollars in a year you are top end you know really working for somebody else at least [laughter] you know what i mean so why should the norm- why should normal people 

456.61 457.55 B: yeah 

460.25 461.56 B: mhm yeah 

464.64 470.16 A: ah go to school and go to college for five six years 

470.03 470.96 B: mhm 

470.16 480.29 A: to be up in that higher range salary and then ah these guys they graduate college because of their sports not because of their academic levels a lot of times 

478.60 479.63 B: right 

480.00 480.84 B: (( oh yeah )) 

480.75 482.15 A: to play sports 

481.99 486.99 B: yeah yeah well i i don't know um 

485.93 488.07 A: [laughter] 

488.19 502.36 B: what to do what to do what do you think about these students getting paid you know i heard a theory that maybe if you paid the students right you know at the moment you're not allowed to pay students at all right but if you if they paid the students that um 

498.49 500.19 A: right 

502.44 506.60 B: i can't remember what the benefit was [laughter] it sounded really good at the time 

506.33 507.27 A: yeah 

506.60 518.34 B: um um there'd be there'd be less underhanded you know maneuverings and everybody would know up front what everybody was getting and it would even things out and 

516.65 519.62 A: [laughter] by paying the students 

518.88 523.81 B: it well not the students i mean the student athletes that's the part i forgot 

522.22 528.17 A: oh the student athletes if they give them a salary for playing a sport well that sounds reasonable 

524.78 526.57 B: right right 

527.16 530.07 B: in college yeah so 

528.30 529.37 A: sure 

529.72 538.05 A: i mean i'd i'd go for that i think that that's that's fair i mean you know they're making money off of it the colleges are are making money off of it 

533.06 533.98 B: yeah 

537.47 547.22 B: oh yeah colleges are making tons of money god that's where that's where they should strike [laughter] make the college presidents go nuts 

539.59 541.56 A: (( yeah )) 

542.60 545.24 A: [laughter] 

546.95 549.87 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

548.47 556.69 B: that's where all the university's are getting most of their money is from ah sports franchising and you know the television rights and 

553.01 554.26 A: yeah 

556.75 557.57 B: ah 

557.02 568.96 A: they would it's amazing it really really is i mean sports are cool there's no doubt about it but i think sometimes sometimes ah sometimes people get just like in the kids level 

568.74 574.98 A: you know they get so into it the the kid's feelings don't even have anything to do with it's about the parents you know 

573.99 575.71 B: mhm oh yeah 

575.01 580.39 A: they're out there and they're so [mn] you know the sportsmanship is like whoa 

579.94 584.47 B: (( it's like r- road rage [laughter] field rage )) 

581.90 588.15 A: yeah yeah yeah and that's and that's unfortunate because if you lose the sportsmanship i 

588.00 588.99 B: yeah 

588.18 591.78 A: think you lose the whole gist of it i really do 

589.83 594.82 B: exactly that's the important thing about it and it's lost completely 

592.77 599.89 A: it is be a graceful loser and and give it the best that you you can and that's that's all anybody can ask of anybody
