0.00 1.36 B: anthony 

1.10 2.27 A: (( hi )) 

3.09 4.07 B: how's it going 

4.06 5.15 A: good how are you 

4.79 7.27 B: i'm okay well are you going to start first or 

7.00 8.46 A: oh you can start if you want 

8.22 15.51 B: okay well basically i feel uh the way everything is over in the middle east there's no way there is ever going to be peace because if you think about it 

15.61 21.04 B: look how many like accords and agreements have been broken already within like the past what ten years by itself 

21.36 22.89 B: you know and ah 

22.70 27.06 B: i really don't see i mean there there th- um there being any type of peace 'cause 

26.84 38.37 B: once an agreement is made there's always going to be a lot of people that are going to be against it and there're always going to be a lot of like rebels you know definitely that are going to be against it 'cause they may not like this they may not like that and then they want to you know do something to change it 

39.42 47.12 A: um yeah well th- there definitely has been a history of violence in the middle east for thousands of years such it's always been i mean if you're 

47.32 54.22 A: going with the israeli palestinian situation um i've always thought the root cause there was terrorism meaning 

54.26 58.43 A: it was always th- the extreme terrorist groups that have always 

58.95 61.42 A: interfered with any kind of peaceful 

61.32 69.45 A: um accord that's why i was in favor of israel taking out targeting hamas and the other terrorist organizations and finishing that off 

69.34 82.74 A: because you're right there will always be groups extreme groups that don't want peace that want to take out any kind of peaceful accord and just by their sheer numbers even though they might not have sheer numbers but they just by their acts of violence 

82.73 85.41 A: they'll cause retaliation from both sides 

85.66 86.97 A: (( and there'll be problems )) 

87.54 90.67 A: in that respect um will it ever be attained 

91.05 95.63 A: they've made some progress now but i don't think it's as easy as it looks it will take years 

95.71 99.44 A: um israel did attain peace with many other arab 

100.21 105.36 A: nations but in palestine it might to have their own state personally 

105.59 108.32 A: do do you think they'll get their own state in two thousand five 

108.73 115.85 B: honestly they need some type of land because like if you look about the history of what basically now the root of it over the past sixty years is 

115.83 130.00 B: basically after world war two you know a lot of is- israelis were pushed into you know what was um palestine's land and that's what to me is all that palestine ever wants is just their land back so if they could get some type of state i think personally um 

130.51 141.47 B: they you know it could be some type of peace some type you know 'cause there's always there's al- there's always still got to be you know conflict that's never going to die but there could be some accordance of peace 

133.11 133.95 A: um 

141.77 146.22 A: well yeah i mean after world war two they ah divided the land off 

146.74 151.17 A: you know with the united nations charter and gave half some to israel some to 

151.30 155.76 A: palestine because it's historically it's always been a it's a disputed land i mean 

155.82 161.33 A: every every both sides have claimed you know ancestors going back to that land for 

161.56 162.66 A: generations 

162.76 163.67 A: um 

164.28 170.13 A: i if they have land but i also think you need security with israel i think you need to make sure terrorists 

170.34 171.94 A: are always fought and um 

172.02 173.53 A: and defeated because 

173.70 178.50 A: extremist groups are the ones that i think are causing the most problems really 

178.53 183.11 B: well when you talk about extremist groups that's going to be the main problem really when it comes to having 

183.15 192.36 B: all out peace because there's so many out there you really can't you know find just one 'cause there's always different types of cells different to 

192.31 200.76 B: you know what you think may be the main groups so you may have the one one group but then there's still there's another cell to that group and there's another cell and there's another cell and there so 

199.74 206.42 A: well you're absolutely right but you have to fight them you have to you have to you can't give in because that's only led to more violence 

206.20 207.91 B: yeah but it's got to be it's 

207.20 218.69 A: many of those groups many of those groups want are looking for the destruction of the state of israel i mean that is their main goal they don't want peace they want total destruction and there's probably some groups in israel as well 

211.95 212.97 B: right 

218.92 224.00 A: that don't maybe want the destruction of palestine don't want anything 

224.09 228.23 A: ah you have to you have to fight terrorists i mean i think the u._s. 

228.59 232.56 A: has always been holding israel back until you know they until september eleventh 

232.52 245.55 A: when we saw that terrorists can also affect us not just you know i mean israel was going through that hell every day i mean it has been for the past you know three years or even going back before that where there's been suicide bombings after suicide bombings 

245.82 247.88 A: i mean people can't live like that 

247.93 253.58 A: and you have to fight back and i mean that's then they can have groups of people 

253.67 262.18 A: that don't that perhaps actually support groups 'cause a majority of like it's it's a problem that um many in palestine 

262.39 267.97 A: don't see that as a problem that suicide bombers you know and coming in and blowing up israelis 

268.04 268.91 A: i mean 

269.21 269.96 A: it's 

270.03 277.44 A: that it's it's almost like it's it's taught to them in schools that they're taught in textbooks that israel should doesn't exist 

277.49 279.06 A: it's almost like a culture 

279.43 286.46 A: of that's of hate that was spread in there for some reason and it's very hard even with this new leadership that they have there 

286.56 292.11 A: to straighten that out i mean it's when mo- most of the people don't even support this new prime minister 

292.29 293.69 A: it's a big problem are 

294.80 295.76 A: (( you there )) 

295.43 296.50 B: (( mm yeah i'm here )) 

296.41 298.18 A: okay yeah i 

297.14 304.05 B: um but you hit a lot of things on the he- you hit a lot of things on the head though but um again i really feels like feel like 

304.26 313.70 B: the whole problem's going to be you only just got to try to fight whatever these terrorism um and you know out- you know outrageous groups are because ah it's really 

314.36 324.69 B: it's really ridiculous because ah you know they're trying but you know you just got to keep going and going because once a lot of these core groups are taken out of the picture i really feel that they could really um 

325.18 335.35 B: you know could really do a lot but it's always still they want pe- people are still going to live in fear even over here you know these groups they did what was needed to make even americans feeling fear after september eleventh the same way the is- 

335.25 342.00 B: israelis are in fear you know you never know what day you could just go on a bus and the bus blows up and 

341.37 342.14 A: (( that's )) 

342.15 343.97 B: and even like to- today 

344.02 350.46 B: you have people you know wondering you know or still a little scared hey what could something happen today could something happen here could something happen there even 

350.41 356.45 B: around when the war was be when the mil- when the war with iraq was going to begin you get a lot of people who fear because you know the 

356.33 369.01 B: warning levels are brought up and people are wondering w- w- were we going to attack and war begins and you know security it's basically given us this this life of like paranoia that you know people in the middle east are dealing with also [mn] 

359.56 362.37 A: (( what )) 

368.67 374.94 A: i mean exactly oh yeah i mean they've they've been dealing with that paranoia for years i mean we've we've had one major terrorist attack 

374.95 382.62 A: now we and for every tower that fell we took out two a a country you know israel has been going a- attacked and they're attacked and they're attacked 

382.64 385.94 A: and everybody expects them to be restrained and held back 

386.24 390.77 A: and that's like [mn] another way there's a lot of countries 

390.84 396.62 A: not just in the middle east in the united nations they don't like israel um they they feel they're 

397.08 408.21 A: you know they're committing war crimes and they're giving moral equivalency between them then they're sending themselves and going after the terrorist organizations something that helps everyone when you eliminate these groups 

408.36 414.52 A: that their only purpose is the destruction of other people and terrorizing people and yet israel is always 

415.02 421.08 A: even even it's not only morally equivalent in some people's eyes but their actions are sometimes 

421.29 426.13 A: ah used to criticize you know to ah hold them as war criminals 

426.74 427.66 A: um 

428.71 436.22 A: so i think and the u._s. is even though we're an ally to israel we've always still always [laughter] you know held them back like right now there's the road map to peace 

436.30 440.70 A: and israel as always is complying you know saying well we'll pull out settlements 

440.92 446.45 A: and there's has been some progress where even the palestinian forces have arrested some 

446.56 450.59 A: of the groups vowing to do a suicide attack but 

450.94 451.67 A: it's 

452.01 457.43 A: if it continues they've promised a palestinian state in two thousand and five we'll see 

457.82 458.92 B: but even 

458.50 459.06 A: (( [mn] )) 

459.41 460.34 A: excuse me 

460.10 470.31 B: i'm sorry but even with a state though you know you still got to always have people you know you'll have like yeah you'll have the happiness of the state but then you'll still have that resentment of all these years of fighting just to get to the state mm 

468.97 478.02 A: well yeah i mean yeah but i mean if you look at there are there's there's other groups like you always have to fight these groups i mean yeah i mean we're always going to have some 

478.23 483.58 A: ah group that hates the united states and they're trying to do terrorist attacks on us but it 

483.65 492.44 A: doesn't mean we don't fight them we fight them we take out as much as we can and we continue destroying them it's like and gradually you know y- you change people's perceptions 

492.72 499.59 A: to not ah it's not worth it to join that group you have to find new ways of fighting these groups 

499.89 502.21 A: and not just sometimes physically but also 

502.82 509.03 A: ah reaching out and seeing what policies you can use or which allies we can build on to 

510.23 513.87 A: start the process but i mean even when there is a state you're right there must be some 

514.07 518.53 A: terrorists that hate us but i look at all the other countries that israel had problems with jordan 

518.98 521.77 A: you know they made peace with them and so far 

522.29 525.02 A: (( with ah hezbollah in lebanon )) 

525.03 526.02 A: (( but )) 

526.28 528.79 A: (( you know this th- the main problem is )) 

529.14 531.46 A: with palestinian terrorist groups 

532.74 534.22 A: (( that's my personal opinion )) 

534.15 542.31 B: yeah they're that's that's definite um because there are always going to be seeds of them remaining and it just takes a little drop of water to keep them growing even though as you know years go on 

542.38 552.84 B: but um you know definitely though the main thing i feel you know this could be a good step to give the palestinians their own state you know how happy will they be you know we don't know that yet they'll have their own land 

551.45 552.96 A: well we'll see i mean 

553.22 566.99 A: they they a lot of white like some people ask why we israel can't close off its borders you know and just separate itself the problem is a lot of the arabs they they they work in israel and they actually many of the arabs of that 

566.47 567.17 B: (( [cough] )) 

567.34 570.82 A: (( standing are bigger figures in israel than )) 

571.20 574.17 A: any arabs in the other countries in their own countries you know 

574.33 581.94 A: and israel it is is the only democracy in the middle east you know ah i- it has flourished and it gives its people 

581.90 589.41 A: so many rights that many of the other people living in that region under dictatorships and totalitarian regimes don't have 

589.53 590.88 A: it's quite unfortunate 

591.37 593.19 A: but we'll see you know 

593.42 599.89 A: i mean i think it was good that we took out saddam you know he was he was paying every suicide bomber twenty five thousand
