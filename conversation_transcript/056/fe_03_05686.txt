3.03 4.05 A: hi john 

4.82 9.02 A: so um we're supposed to talk about countries that the 

9.05 11.76 A: [mn] that we believe threaten the u._s.'s safety 

11.43 15.76 B: yeah that's what it sounds like okay have you ever done this before 

12.82 13.72 A: okay 

15.32 18.66 A: no first time okay 

16.25 18.01 B: okay this is my first time too 

18.24 21.86 B: i don't know i hope i can talk for long enough [laughter] 

19.86 22.07 A: [laughter] i'm sure we can 

22.29 24.57 A: all right well let's see 

24.61 27.19 A: we could start with iraq 

27.07 29.93 B: yep mo- most definitely 

30.14 40.15 A: well i believe that that iraq is a threat to u._s. safety because ah they're already killing our our [laughter] ah military personnel in iraq who are there 

35.82 36.87 B: [laughter] 

38.40 40.90 B: yeah seems like every day almost ah 

40.23 44.32 A: right ongoing and i don't know how long that's going to go on for 

44.19 51.23 B: i think we're going to occupy there for a long time probably have troops there for more than a year at least 

47.83 49.61 A: yeah 

50.96 53.67 A: oh i agree at least probably several years and 

53.94 59.13 A: there'll be a lot more people that will die in the meantime it's like we have great technology 

58.69 59.92 B: (( mm yeah )) 

59.31 68.29 A: to win big war world wars but once we get on the ground it's tho- those individual threats that i think we 

68.32 70.91 A: it's much harder to control 

69.11 71.73 B: yeah well they're dealing with ah 

72.08 77.32 B: probably the hardest situation that they could deal with that they didn't see in other wars with 

77.74 87.22 B: civilians or people dressed like civilians or i mean conventional wars were you know guys in ah uniforms fighting with each other and civilians ran away 

84.92 88.85 A: right right exactly that's right 

87.48 101.88 B: but ah that's not happening any more it seems like you know a large majority of the country is the enemy including a lot of civilians and i try to keep up with that type of stuff i followed the war 

90.36 91.28 A: (( yep uh-huh )) 

102.03 104.01 B: as it went a lot 

103.94 106.62 A: do you really think the majority of people are 

106.28 109.02 B: i don't know if i could say majority but 

108.27 110.78 A: against us i think it's a large enough minority 

110.29 115.83 B: okay yeah a very large minority would be a better way to put it but it it's a lot 

112.01 112.57 A: (( [mn] )) 

113.26 114.92 A: yeah 

115.93 116.80 A: yes 

117.07 128.06 A: ah [mn] well another then of course there's iran there's north korea ah those are the obvious ones because ah president bush you know mentioned them as the axis of evil but um 

125.43 126.47 B: right 

127.89 134.49 A: you know beyond that um i'm sure there well then of course there's other arabic nations i suppose or at least people in them 

131.91 139.32 B: yeah like syria is probably a big problem i mean you know afghanistan is still an ongoing thing 

135.02 136.76 A: mhm 

139.23 140.93 A: yeah 

139.57 146.13 B: until they at least find the the couple of head guys bin laden and and ah 

146.33 150.97 B: i think they got one of his high up lieutenant type guys 

150.91 151.76 A: uh-huh 

151.45 152.91 B: a while ago 

152.27 153.60 A: yeah right uh-huh 

153.25 156.39 B: ah i don't know where where are you from 

155.92 158.41 A: ah i'm living in new jersey and you 

157.59 160.57 B: okay i'm in new york yeah

170.40 171.34 A: okay 

170.88 171.88 B: so 

171.93 176.55 B: you what were you living here in during when the attack happened 

175.96 178.82 A: yeah but i was up in white plains that day 

178.21 181.16 B: oh okay but you're still you're a new york city resident 

181.05 188.18 A: at that moment i wasn't i had just moved back from another country to america and i didn't even have a residence other than my parents in massachusetts but i 

188.24 193.77 A: uh but no i mean but a month two months later after i moved to manhattan actually so 

193.15 195.01 B: oh okay so 

194.08 198.59 A: yeah but you were here obviously when it happened 

197.03 201.31 B: yeah i've been in [mn] the same house my whole life 

201.55 211.97 B: as i say i was born over here in jackson heights astoria area i've been here my whole time so i took that thing very ah personal especially since i had a brother who was over there 

208.42 210.22 A: right 

211.88 213.32 A: in the trade center 

213.22 225.26 B: yeah he was in front of it no he didn't he's a law enforcement guy and uh he was in the street when it fell down and when the second plane hit and yeah and we didn't know if he was alive or not 

213.91 214.98 A: did he die 

215.95 218.33 A: oh well that's good 

222.29 223.00 A: (( oh )) 

224.58 226.56 A: i'm sure you didn't know for a long time 

225.74 230.31 B: and ah i would have taken it very personal even if he wasn't there 

229.55 230.76 A: right mhm 

230.57 235.22 B: 'cause i i i consider myself to be a pretty strong american 

235.37 236.65 B: and ah 

236.98 248.18 B: to have somebody like that there as it's happening that just makes it a ton worse you know so i take it super personal the whole thing the whole attack thing i wasn't really a hundred percent crazy about 

240.48 242.91 A: (( mhm right )) 

248.53 251.73 B: those people to begin with but ah 

250.04 251.76 A: mhm 

252.22 254.80 B: that that really made things a lot worse 

254.54 255.75 A: right 

254.81 258.52 B: and i have a ton of them in my area over here 

258.63 260.25 A: oh you mean muslims 

260.40 261.49 B: oh yeah 

260.90 262.33 A: oh uh-huh okay 

261.89 265.29 B: yeah at at jackson heights astoria long island city 

264.67 267.33 A: right uh-huh 

265.36 272.14 B: we're loaded with all kinds of middle easterners but we got a ton of people from yemen there's another country for the list 

270.28 271.06 A: uh-huh 

271.96 272.78 A: uh-huh 

272.51 274.00 B: and pakistan 

273.80 275.28 A: uh-huh right yes 

274.09 279.00 B: and i mean they're supposedly trying to help us out a little bit over there in afghanistan but 

279.17 283.76 B: [mn] i think they're just doing whatever they have to do to benefit themselves 

283.12 287.13 A: yeah well i suppose most people do that but you know [laughter] the uh 

287.16 293.30 A: the uh i think in a way it's like well there are certainly countries that one could say seem to be a threat to the u._s. 

293.33 305.62 A: but i think beyond that it's more like there are groups and individuals regardless of whatever country they live in or are from or are nationalities of that it's it's more about that now you know 

300.80 302.01 B: that's true oh 

304.55 308.27 B: well we have we have plenty of domestic stuff too to worry about 

307.62 311.47 A: yeah right but i mean but a lot of that domestic is people who um 

312.20 323.00 A: who are of certain groups and beliefs that are very anti american so therefore they constitute a threat whether they're from you know north dakota or 

320.78 324.29 B: yeah another country or another state or 

323.09 328.75 A: [laughter] yeah or exactly or or you know the obvious ones like [mn] um 

324.58 326.10 B: down the block [mn] 

329.03 331.39 A: um you know afghanistan or 

331.80 333.56 A: saudi arabia or 

332.91 335.79 B: (( all the way all over th- the middle east )) 

335.24 338.52 A: right saudi arabia's another good one that's 

337.78 342.11 B: right yeah that's and that's one maybe a little bit lower on the list but not too far [laughter] 

341.83 352.81 A: right i have a feeling that there's a lot of people well obviously an awful lot of the people who have been a threat to us are from saudi arabia so even if the government [cough] the official government 

349.23 351.51 B: that's true oh yeah most of those people 

352.79 358.94 A: [cough] is not anti american certainly there's a large sentiment there 

356.68 366.16 B: well the people i think are maybe more against us than the government but who knows when it was to their advantage when saddam went into kuwait 

366.09 375.53 B: which was for him i guess a very easy target tiny little country with a small army with more money than any other country in the world possibly [mn] except for us maybe 

368.11 370.07 A: (( [cough] right )) 

373.32 375.15 A: mhm 

375.78 377.36 B: (( and [mn] )) 

377.49 383.82 B: next in line for him to take over once he built up his army even stronger would have been probably saudi arabia so 

383.04 384.71 A: mhm 

383.73 395.72 B: they were like backing us a hundred percent you know use our air fields use everything we got and what happened now we're saying we're going to go in there to get saddam for good and they weren't backing us up too much 

395.15 396.82 A: right 

395.77 396.64 B: so 

396.83 405.71 B: yeah that definitely puts them on the list you know w- well that's that's i guess the whole middle eastern thing if if you're with me that's great and if you're against me i want you dead 

399.67 401.52 A: mhm 

405.66 410.99 A: right i'm trying to think if there's any other nation i mean what about china do you think that's a threat 

411.56 416.14 B: i think china yeah you know i i don't know what their 

416.17 422.15 B: short term intentions are i'm sure if we had to go into asia for any reason for 

417.83 419.01 A: right 

422.61 430.26 B: korea or anything like that i'm sure they wouldn't be very happy about it basically another communist country not much different to north korea 

427.77 429.03 A: right 

430.60 435.36 A: yeah a little more open [laughter] certainly more open than north korea but but they um 

431.04 432.22 B: in their beliefs 

435.44 446.17 A: they yeah that that's the kind of thing you hit the nail on the head probably short-term they're not a threat but or they do believe in the long term i'm not even sure the word is threat but they could become 

440.79 441.67 B: right 

446.20 451.39 A: our biggest sort of competition for influence around the world 

451.31 456.50 B: yeah well i guess just because of the size but what is their uh is their economy any good 

456.26 469.96 A: it's um it's growing it's growing fast yeah so is it gr- i mean it's still on a per capita basis extremely um you know poor compared to like us or europe but but it's it's growing fast 

458.76 460.34 B: it is okay i didn't 

467.08 473.92 B: right well it's good to have however many billions of people over there and probably a-a lot of them are very poor 

470.64 471.68 A: yeah i know 

473.82 475.87 A: right absolutely 

474.63 479.61 B: well that's the communist way right hold the people down to make money off them 

476.43 478.21 A: (( yeah right [laughter] )) 

479.47 486.92 A: yeah they sort of spread it all out and yeah but there's a lot of money now in places like shanghai and beijing and um 

487.14 492.41 A: you know large especi- shanghai probably more than anywhere for um whatever and in terms of per capita wealth 

491.02 491.94 B: right 

492.76 496.76 A: but um and then of course north korea which is the big 

496.49 501.24 B: they're a big threat and ah bush gave some pretty strong words even when we were ah 

496.98 498.96 A: secret 

501.63 506.83 B: fighting in iraq telling them that we could handle a war on two fronts 

507.07 509.92 B: which is some that's some pretty big talk 

510.09 511.26 A: right uh-huh 

510.76 514.55 B: you know what would that bring to the to the you know the average american 

514.65 517.15 B: would that be bad enough to actually have a draft 

517.12 519.45 A: right mhm 

517.67 520.67 B: you know that would be i'm too old for that 

519.47 522.22 A: mhm me too mhm 

520.90 522.42 B: i'm thirty five 

522.38 524.88 A: yeah forty two so i'm too old too 

523.69 531.68 B: so i mean but i have nephews and stuff like that that aren't too far off from that age if it was to happen in the next 

526.98 528.49 A: sure me too 

531.86 535.84 B: few years bunch of years my father fought in korea in 

532.60 534.34 A: mhm 

535.57 536.46 A: uh-huh 

535.87 537.17 B: in the first one 

537.41 539.26 B: and it was horrible 

539.48 541.23 B: they put that right up there with 

541.33 544.28 B: probably one of the worst wars that we've ever had 

543.65 549.76 A: yeah even though it's not known so well right 

545.59 548.95 B: yeah no it's like yeah they call it the forgotten war or whatever 

548.71 558.64 B: and uh you can talk to guys who were in world war i._i. or vietnam and you mention korea and even those guys who had a horrible time are like oh my god that was the worst 

557.79 558.66 A: uh-huh 

558.49 565.74 B: so i i c- couldn't imagine what it would be like i i assume they've built up their military tremendously in the last fifty years 

565.41 572.05 A: right well same about north korea the one thing we do have one amongst many i'm sure a thing that we have is that um 

566.04 567.28 B: (( and )) 

572.29 575.02 A: we have we're a much more powerful economy even 

575.03 578.08 A: even if um they have a strong military 

575.93 577.08 B: yeah that's true 

578.20 581.36 A: th- i mean if their people are starving what are they going to do [laughter] 

581.05 592.15 B: that's right i don't yeah i don't know how big their military is supposedly iraq was number six in the world the sixth largest military i i don't know how they measure that do they [mn] measure it measure it by 

588.62 590.46 A: mhm 

592.26 597.47 B: military might or by people like the number of soldiers i don't know but 

595.32 598.58 A: right yeah or is it like you know ah 

598.67 599.89 A: (( the abil- like what do you ))
