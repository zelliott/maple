0.00 1.38 B: how are you doing i'm josh 

0.99 3.68 A: hey josh my name is mark teichmann 

3.55 4.89 B: how you doing mark 

4.25 6.02 A: (( okay and how are you josh )) 

5.44 7.94 B: not bad uh 

8.20 12.59 B: so yeah what what ah countries do you feel might be a threat to the u._s. 

12.16 22.98 A: oh definitely ah saudi arabia because of they've put a lot of money behind ah i believe they're the ones who backed ah iraq and the entire ah problems 

22.46 24.34 B: really 

23.22 24.97 A: yeah 

25.20 26.26 B: um 

25.24 28.34 A: what about yourself what's your feeling 

27.57 35.17 B: i i definitely feel the middle east um i also think north korea we have to watch out for anybody who's looking at 

35.45 40.41 B: you know making nuclear weapons is is is definitely a threat i mean 

40.53 45.02 B: i think we're we are where we are today because we have those capabilities and 

45.77 50.55 B: [cough] i think if a small country like that gets them then it kind of throws everything off 

50.18 60.28 A: the only thing that's thrown me about that i you know i've been reading a lot about north korea and apparently um you know ah president bush made you know made ah 

60.49 68.65 A: you know inquiries about it and and put alarm out but it it seemed to die out very quickly so i really don't think um 

69.27 78.79 A: north korea's a threat as much as i still think we've got issues with iraq because uh you know our soldiers are getting you know onesie and twosies are getting killed and i think ah 

78.75 84.59 A: there's still a lot of money again in in [mn] in in that [mn] part of the world with um 

84.99 92.83 A: that are uh anti america money and i think that's where our our major ah fl- influx is 

92.44 96.10 B: well i think they're fanatics over there and i don't think um 

96.37 97.91 B: i mean unless 

98.18 110.39 B: we're there long-term i mean just look at israel they've been trying to you know make a space for themselves you know i don't know how many years and they still haven't been able to successfully do it i think when you're dealing with religion 

110.87 117.88 B: um and government together it's kind of it's kind of hard to impose your will upon anyone 

117.37 120.49 A: and do you think religion is just playing a big part in this 

120.42 128.67 B: i think ah we fanatics of whatever relig- you know i i i guess 

128.91 132.09 B: muslim fanatics um for instance 

132.88 134.84 B: the taliban i mean 

135.32 139.25 B: they were they were what a religious state right 

138.11 139.62 A: that's correct 

140.14 147.23 B: just look at what they were doing over there i mean and is it through religion that they're 

147.30 152.05 B: you know getting all these students and [sigh] these young people involved 

152.20 153.25 A: [mn] could be 

152.26 153.80 B: in their cause 

155.14 163.64 A: i think they're ah just being ah the students are just getting so much information i think they're ah you know getting bombarded with ah 

163.72 172.65 A: with with ah with information and it's getting to their heads i don't know it's like they're almost getting hypnotized with this kind of stuff 

171.91 176.43 B: yeah yeah it is a little 

176.85 181.23 B: um saudi arabia again i i haven't heard much 

181.27 184.19 B: in the news about that country specifically what 

184.19 193.53 A: well i think the problem is um we're so involved with their ah with import export with saudi arabia so there's a you know it's a a double edged sword 

193.51 196.51 A: um one thing is that you know we're you know 

196.40 209.01 A: economically involved with it ah so i think the government is ah is afraid to ah make waves there ah plus but the f- point is though i think that's where all the money of the terrorism is coming from 

201.81 203.47 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

209.03 214.88 A: and it's such a large country and there's a lot of ah you know terrorists there so i think uh um 

215.00 221.98 A: ah i think bush is at this point is afraid to you know make some waves there but i think that's where a key issue would be 

218.19 220.93 B: is it 

221.42 224.30 B: is it that we're relying upon them for oil or 

223.60 225.90 A: oh absolutely 

226.26 230.61 B: now that we have iraq wouldn't it be safe to say 

231.42 234.70 B: that we can make waves with them because we have our own 

235.09 244.62 A: [mn] well i don't think iraq can supply nearly the amount that's required here in the states and i think that we rely our biggest supplier i believe is ah you know saudi arabia 

245.80 249.62 B: maybe see 'cause i always thought that saddam 

249.92 256.41 B: you know his money for his his backing all came from that [cough] and again 

257.04 259.35 B: all that he stole you know from 

259.58 260.85 B: the u._n. 

260.94 267.32 B: all the government help that that that iraq got i'm sure a lot of the money that he has came from that too 

268.13 277.47 A: [mn] yeah it's very possible see but but what i don't understand here we are looking for sa- saddam who has a twenty five million dollar price tag on him 

277.49 291.78 A: and bin laden we can't find either of them and i think both of them are dining out somewhere in saudi arabia because our our people i don't think our c._i._a. is not really over there and i think that's where both of them are ah sitting pretty and uh 

291.71 295.91 A: you know holed away somewhere and that's why you know with all the uh 

296.03 308.89 A: top secret security we got the c._i._a. you know that kind of money out there i mean anybody in the world would turn him in because of that you know the offer made so i think that's why ah we can't find these two hoodlums 

302.45 305.44 B: (( mhm )) 

308.94 314.94 B: i i definitely agree with you i think they probably would be um [cough] 

315.28 325.96 B: hiding out over there and you know what maybe if they are over there we with what you said us not wanting to make waves with them we can't exactly go in there gung ho and ah 

326.81 333.23 B: you know grab 'em like like ah bush did with pakistan and had a 

333.63 338.09 B: (( you know gave them an ultimatum and had him working for us you know what i mean )) 

338.59 340.66 B: (( you understand what i'm saying )) 

339.45 354.20 A: oh absolutely now also what's your feeling on uh you know president bush just went over to uh africa and met with the african countries and ah and they're talking about something with what was it i think liberia 

354.27 359.97 B: with iberia liberia yeah it was liberia 

355.29 356.59 A: liberia 

356.62 364.06 A: i believe that's the country where we're looking to get some ah thing and do you have any did you have you read anything about that 

362.44 364.67 B: no i i i s- 

364.89 371.21 B: i saw in the news that he was visiting and i remember that nelson mandela had made some comments 

371.75 376.20 B: ah maybe beforehand or or while during he was out 

376.33 382.44 B: [mn] during his visit but i i don't know what that's all about if you want to enlighten me 

381.60 388.00 A: [mn] well i know there's un- unrest there and i think i don't know a lot of ah you know [mn] 

387.90 401.91 A: ah same types of situations that are going on with ah that was going on in iraq is also [mn] in liberia but i don't think ah the u._s. people are going to ah just say okay [mn] 

401.90 405.53 A: i'm going to be able to take another war like that that's the problem 

403.22 408.66 B: yeah exactly i was going to say we haven't even finished one let's let's ah 

408.75 412.38 B: at least accomplish one of our ah objectives before we 

412.40 416.18 B: move on to another one because afghanistan we never caught bin laden 

416.46 424.35 B: and we're still having guys over there you know i have a friend that's stationed over there in afghanistan and we're still over there we're in iraq now 

424.60 430.19 B: um and then now to be go- over there in liberia it's going to put us in another situation 

430.33 432.92 B: like ah we had in ah 

433.39 435.03 B: what's it called 

434.87 437.66 A: mhm vietnam oh 

436.46 438.83 B: no not vietnam um 

438.99 440.95 B: (( where the [sigh] )) 

441.66 444.17 B: the soldiers the helicopter was gunned down 

444.51 447.81 A: oh i don't remember oh i know i saw there was a movie made about that 

447.20 449.33 B: yeah 

448.76 452.72 A: yeah i don't remember the the small african ah country 

452.23 457.31 B: yeah well yeah what do you feel about ah germany and france now 

453.66 455.16 A: tell them i'll phone right 

457.11 468.42 A: back well france i think ah you know has has created a lot of bad blood i mean ah u._s. people are not ah too receptive to the ah to the french right now 

469.03 474.71 A: germany i you know i really haven't read that much about i mean ah the german people ah 

474.78 483.41 A: i don't i mean i think uh they were a little bit more pro to u._s. situation than ah france was and i think that 

482.48 484.75 B: you mean they were just hopping on the bandwagon 

483.56 485.66 A: france what's that 

485.09 490.06 B: you think they were just hopping on france's bandwagon 'cause they probably thought 

488.30 502.29 A: well i think they were more noncommittal i think the french definitely ah made a made a statement they weren't supporting anything the u._s. was doing and um that's really yeah you know cut relations pretty ah pretty heavy with the ah with the french 

501.60 505.99 B: well how about what they found that they were trading arms for oil 

506.42 507.21 A: yeah 

506.53 509.65 B: with iraq the french 

510.11 512.06 A: oh absolutely so that's ah 

511.78 514.94 B: (( that's probably why they didn't want to you know )) 

515.29 517.93 B: the u._s. going in there 

518.64 530.81 A: well that too yeah i think that ah that's a point but the french have always been uh anti american from way back when i mean ah have you ever been over to france uh they they just hate u._s. ah they 

528.83 534.66 B: yeah well i don't understand it because if it wasn't for us they'd probably be part of england right now 

534.38 537.20 A: [laughter] you're probably right on that and ah 

535.39 536.61 B: [laughter] 

537.38 539.44 A: the thing is though the french 

539.71 544.63 A: ah economy needs the american dollar and they're going to lose it 

545.12 547.10 A: definitely 

548.10 548.88 B: (( mm )) 

548.23 560.49 A: so i mean we got a lot of issues on it and i think with an election year coming up next year ah president bush got to watch himself and not get into ah get in too many situations like i mentioned before 

560.45 567.59 B: yeah well i think the american people aren't going to want somebody else to step in with all that's going on what do you think i mean 

567.79 568.66 B: (( what )) 

568.90 570.50 B: [cough] if you don't mind me asking 

571.74 573.50 B: (( [mn] what do you ah )) 

573.71 579.74 B: do you feel that you you might vote for bush this come the election or do you think you might want to get somebody else in there 

578.07 578.82 A: oh 

579.59 590.88 A: oh right now i mean if there was another person that i thought was strong candidate i would definitely consider it but right now i don't think the the democrats have anything to ah put up against bush 

591.19 593.15 B: mhm 

591.81 599.89 A: there's just not nobody out there that's really ah stepped up i mean in reality bush wasn't even the winner in the last election 

598.86 599.95 B: yeah exactly
