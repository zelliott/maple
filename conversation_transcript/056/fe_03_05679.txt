21.31 24.97 A: yeah true it just never did anything better 

24.35 25.52 B: (( yeah [laughter] ))

72.03 82.39 B: they didn't really have to do that i mean there was enough justification for the war and the threat you know there had been the persian gulf war before and plus you know the human rights violations 

83.75 85.74 B: that had gone on in iraq 

85.88 90.50 A: right but without al- all that hype you wouldn't get that major support

119.15 125.78 B: that it won't be able to get out of because like with the people dying during this um during the peace keeping in iraq

171.21 173.90 A: [noise] yeah true they both want it an- 

174.30 176.47 A: at no matter what expense 

176.32 177.98 B: (( yeah )) 

178.53 179.44 B: (( [noise] )) 

179.68 185.34 B: you you're right it might might never see the end of that at least in our lifetime [laughter] 

185.62 187.94 A: no not in our lifetimes true 

187.78 190.52 B: yeah hm 

191.65 197.40 A: but just like everything else there is always ah a matter of destruction before you get any kind of peace 

198.03 212.35 B: mm yeah but the thing is i didn't since whe- when was israel founded like nineteen forty something since then there's been like i mean if there's not been fighting there's been just like hostility 

205.66 207.34 A: right 

212.47 215.98 B: in the area bad blood between people in the area you know

240.07 244.21 B: um you know a secular state and you guys didn't want in and 

244.37 247.70 B: i don't i don't know i mean even when you read the history 

247.74 253.83 B: you get like extremely different perceptions of it whether you read like one version or the other 

253.85 258.82 B: you know a jewish take on it versus like an arab take on it 

259.23 262.87 B: it's tough to separate the truth from ah 

259.80 261.43 A: right 

263.74 265.10 B: from what's not 

265.23 266.57 A: right that's true

272.32 275.40 B: yeah yeah 

275.97 278.48 B: (( i i i don't know what is going to come out of it you )) 

278.71 288.12 A: iraq i don't know that's a that's a tough one basically what's going to happen there in a couple of months 

278.73 279.47 B: (( know )) 

281.19 282.33 B: (( [noise] )) 

284.25 284.98 B: (( mm )) 

290.75 300.89 B: [noise] did anyone tell you see the first time i got on it said the topic today will be airline security and then they switched it to middle east just now 

297.34 298.99 A: right 

300.88 302.79 A: right 

301.56 307.90 B: [laughter] so i was like thinking oh what am i going to talk about with airline security did they do that for you too [noise] 

308.17 313.00 A: right they they switched it on me that's ah that's like the second time the same thing 

312.41 315.05 B: (( oh yeah i don't know )) 

315.61 326.27 B: well one thing is for sure there is definitely a relationship between what happens in [laughter] in the middle east or what brews in that area and our airline security [laughter] 

326.38 327.55 A: [laughter] 

327.56 328.55 A: i know 

327.86 335.75 B: i i i remember ah the last time i went to the airport they made me take my um take my shoes off and they scanned them three or four times and then 

336.20 343.19 B: um they said if you walk through the detector and you have a pack of gum like you know the foil on the piece of gum 

343.28 345.66 A: yeah yeah right right 

343.62 347.11 B: if you have on- if you have one of those in your pocket it will set it off

347.27 348.94 A: right 

350.24 351.20 A: wow 

350.49 358.27 B: but i i mean i i guess it's necessary it's kind of scary like i remember when i heard about ah richard reid the shoe bomber 

358.43 359.87 A: right 

359.00 361.59 B: you know when you think about it the guy was 

361.80 375.79 B: the guy the plan was like so diabolical and if you think and if he had the i i mean if he had the sense to not light it in front of everyone you know i mean he would never have been caught he would have 

375.72 380.42 B: and you know a huge loss of american life it would have been a real tragedy 

380.66 382.74 A: right there's just goodbye [noise] [laughter] 

382.74 389.52 B: yeah it's it's a good thing the guy was an idiot and decided to light the match in front of everyone 

389.46 399.85 B: and someone said hey what is this guy doing here lighting his shoe [laughter] but i mean it was just that he screws up or it would have been a really terrible thing you know 

399.90 401.22 B: and that is 

401.36 402.68 B: it's pretty scary 

403.28 405.38 A: (( yeah because it was that close )) 

405.39 406.13 B: mm 

408.05 411.29 A: so those were the only two topics they mentioned 

410.74 415.13 B: well they like i said um i got airline security before and then 

415.33 421.00 B: middle east and i didn't hear what the half of what um they were saying about the middle east because it was kind of 

421.46 424.72 B: the person in the recording was kind of like mumbling 

424.79 426.46 A: right 

425.02 434.68 B: or maybe my phone is bad but they said oh do you think peace will ever be achieved what i got out of it they said do you think peace will ever be achieved in the middle east what do you think of the present situation 

436.33 446.12 B: i don't know i think that like by having by establishing if they do establish a democracy in iraq i i hope it kind of like spreads to the other countries 

446.42 458.84 B: 'cause when you have like when you have governments that [noise] have that have restrictions and they force feed their citizens this propaganda hatred toward the united states and you know radical 

458.91 467.08 B: islam of course you are going to have problems of course it is going to be a breeding ground for terrorists i mean there is no doubt about that but if you have a democratic society where 

467.10 476.17 B: you have a whole bunch of ideas and you can decide for yourself i think most people would decide not to you know strap c. four to them and go and blowup something you know 

476.60 480.48 A: [noise] exactly there's always going to be ah contradiction 

481.37 483.55 B: yeah i mean i i i hope that um 

483.75 489.48 B: well i don't know i i i hope that it ah works out and i hope there's 

489.83 493.41 B: there'll be a quick end to the violence 

493.56 494.56 B: and 

493.93 498.54 A: yeah and hopefully we don't go back in the five years and do the same thing 

496.54 500.97 B: [laughter] yeah that's true i mean i'm wondering like 

501.05 515.39 B: because some of what they're targeting the ah the terrorists i mean well the people the insurgence in iraq right now what they are targeting are like you know they are targeting ah municipal facilities transformers 

515.30 527.09 B: um like sewer facilities water facilities they are targeting those things and when they are targeting things like that that is just like shooting yourself shooting yourself in the foot it's 

518.50 520.18 A: right 

527.26 535.71 B: i mean what are you gaining you you're all right well now everyone in the block is not going to have power for a week or everyone is not going to have running water 

537.06 545.18 B: i mean it really gets at you how ridiculous their logic is that they're to get back at the u._s. they are destroying these u._s. sponsored 

545.30 549.09 B: you know improvement ah you know quality of life projects 

549.81 555.93 A: yeah but you you're thinking okay why why do they want to pick those are they like the easiest things to do or what 

556.33 558.21 B: well i i mean it's 

558.23 560.87 B: apparently they are i think they are doing it because 

560.84 573.48 B: you know the u._s. came in and said well you know we are going to start some improv- we're we're going to build everything back up like it was before in iraq we're going to you know build up these power houses we are going to build up 

568.06 569.02 A: right 

573.31 580.50 B: the water system the sewer system we are going to make sure everything is all right and these um the rebels that are in iraq 

579.41 580.82 A: do the same thing 

580.78 592.13 B: well no no they're they're just they're destroying they are targeting many of these facilities for their attacks like recently they blew up like an electrical power house type place 

586.00 587.68 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

592.39 599.89 B: and the reason they blew it up is because the americans had helped rebuild it but then by the same token [laughter] yeah go ahead
