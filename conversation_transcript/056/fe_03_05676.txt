0.23 1.82 A: hi i'm andrew 

1.57 3.11 B: hey i'm mike 

3.44 4.67 A: nice to meet ya 

4.51 5.75 B: nice to meet you andrew 

6.30 7.61 A: (( so ah )) 

6.47 7.35 B: (( so [noise] )) 

8.20 14.74 A: what is it ah tonight i couldn't quite make out what ah what they said something about the middle east and do we think there is going to be peace 

14.30 20.19 B: yeah peace in the middle east will it ever happen and ah should the u._s. be involved something like that 

20.78 22.15 B: so what do you think 

22.60 37.10 A: well not for nothing but i don't know if there is ever going to be peace i think that this is a dispute that you know if it doesn't kind of get settled soon then it's just going to keep on fighting until one or the other is eliminated 

36.55 43.08 B: yeah i it's it's a really really really complicated situation you know it's been going on for 

43.24 50.46 B: a long long time um i don't know i think there could be peace but i think we are like a long way from it you know 

44.75 45.58 A: mhm 

50.04 64.88 A: i mean don't get me wrong i like the idea i have nothing you know i have nothing against it but i mean part of the problem is that the there's a whole mindset is different at this point it is less remembered of the original problems than 

52.48 54.11 B: oh yeah yeah [noise] 

65.08 70.61 A: well you killed our guys and then we killed yours in return and then they killed back and forth back and forth 

70.33 78.97 B: yeah exactly and ah and also i think like there is such a large contingent on both sides that don't just want peace like they want more than 

71.73 73.36 A: it's become shakespearian 

79.12 80.19 B: peace [noise] 

80.88 82.20 A: yeah 

81.69 87.04 B: [noise] so it is like a kind of unresolvable situation [noise] 

87.44 91.70 A: i don't know i mean ah should the u._s. be involved i 

91.69 106.14 A: i don't really know because truth be told i haven't paid all that much attention but i think on one hand we do dip our fingers into the pie a bit much on the other hand you know if it is possible to save peoples' lives then yeah you know 

106.65 113.06 B: yeah i i i think the u._s. should be involved because i think that there's very few people or very few countries rather that 

112.98 125.75 B: are even remotely capable of improving the situation you know there is just there is really no one out there who can i think bring both sides to the table and actually make some relief 

119.19 120.28 A: yeah 

125.53 131.80 B: even if even if it proves to be unsuccessful but at least attempt you know as they have in the past you know 

130.02 131.44 A: yeah 

132.07 140.55 A: well as far as i've seen pretty much we're the only ones that are really going in there and saying all right come on guys knock it off you know let's try to work something out huh [lipsmack] 

140.10 153.75 B: yeah exactly yeah i think we should keep doing that but it is also really disappointing to see that there is not more of a worldwide call for it i mean like you know it's it's kind of disturbing you know that there's not more i mean 

153.99 159.80 B: you know whe- whichever side the people are on that they don't want there's not more people calling for peace you know 

159.63 164.60 A: [noise] yeah ah i just ah you know no- i mean 

164.66 165.47 A: (( [mn] )) 

166.57 173.20 A: i mean i see i see the points of view from both sides but i personally feel towards israel for a variety of reasons 

172.92 174.53 B: mhm mhm 

173.81 182.20 A: i mean not for nothing but ah one of my actual personal friends was killed in one of the suicide bombings [noise] 

181.95 184.33 B: yeah yeah 

182.94 184.29 A: (( and ah )) 

184.44 187.88 A: you know that would tend to make me feel [noise] towards 

188.08 190.21 A: a cert- you know one side 

190.28 201.77 B: yeah i mean i think i i definitely lean toward that side as well i mean i have lots of friend who who are jewish and you know friends who have visited there for like extended periods of time you know like 

201.30 202.30 A: mhm 

201.77 205.35 B: and ah i definitely i think i sympathize more with 

205.44 208.42 B: what is going on from their point of view you know 

208.30 210.29 A: (( mhm i mean )) 

209.21 211.41 B: fair or unfair as it may be 

211.13 211.70 A: (( [cough] )) 

212.19 214.77 A: pardon me um [noise] 

213.33 214.13 B: sure 

214.84 220.53 A: well i mean i mean not for nothing but you hear the whole thing with you know with palestine thing oh 

220.61 225.50 A: look you know our our civilization has been crushed blah blah blah um 

225.73 231.99 A: i'm sorry not for nothing but before the state of israel was established they were nomadic tribes 

231.46 233.53 B: [laughter] yeah exactly 

233.05 234.47 A: nomadic tribes 

234.54 237.08 A: don't have civilization 

236.28 249.31 B: [laughter] well they do but they i don't think that they can claim that this one area is more important than the rest you know like i think they definitely have some kind of claim to culture but 

244.21 245.41 A: (( yeah )) 

248.56 251.02 A: oh no absolutely absolutely but 

249.58 258.48 B: but like ah but you know i i think it is totally bogus that like it's like oh well we are not going to stop fighting until you know 

258.87 271.75 B: all all the jews leave their land and give it just give it back to us because they stole it from us i mean that's like that's totally bogus you know it's like there is shreds of truth in that but it is so distorted that it's you know it's it's it's 

259.19 260.35 A: yeah 

271.99 273.80 B: just doesn't make any sense you know 

273.76 285.63 A: yeah but ah i mean some things like ah what is it the gaza strip was acquired during an when israel was attacked on yom kippur 

285.50 287.20 B: mhm 

286.61 288.07 A: so israel 

288.09 295.60 A: ah managed to beat off the attack and in doing so claimed the gaza strip so oh you stole it from us 

293.27 294.24 B: yeah 

295.43 297.43 B: (( yeah [laughter] i know it's )) 

296.07 302.86 A: um it was it was won in a war um this is you know this is like a poker game you don't just end the game and then hand back the money 

298.28 299.68 B: [laughter] 

302.51 305.36 B: yeah i totally agree with you i think that 

303.06 303.72 A: (( you )) 

303.89 305.03 A: fight a war 

305.39 315.67 B: and i think that undercuts a lot of like the palestinian positions 'cause like when looked at like more carefully they just don't they just don't make a lot of sense you know like in the real world kind of scenario 

315.62 325.76 A: yeah i mean it's not nice no okay but that's the way it works you fight you know you go fight a war and you lose and you lose the land that's the way it works 

319.54 320.34 B: yeah 

325.39 326.72 B: mhm 

326.48 329.14 A: it's not very pretty but you know it's the real world 

329.52 337.85 B: yeah yeah but and also i think there's so many there's like at least from i i mean i i keep up on the news pretty pretty well and at least from 

337.76 345.03 B: the point of view i can see like there's there is lots of palestinians who do want peace but and there's an 

343.93 344.86 A: (( yeah )) 

345.10 354.30 B: element to the palestinian cause that wants more than peace and because of that they will sabotage any kind of legitimate peace deal you know 

353.91 356.08 A: (( yeah wel- )) 

354.56 359.43 B: through assassination or more bombings and that's exactly you know 

359.28 372.66 B: what's been happening and that that i mean i that i can understand the israeli point of view just being like enough is enough we are just going to wipe out everyone that we can even think of ah you know of of causing this kind of problem for us 

369.33 370.47 A: yeah 

372.34 375.52 A: well the problem is that there is always going to be somebody dissatisfied 

375.57 376.60 B: mhm 

376.00 382.32 A: and there's always going to be a fanatic in anything i mean there are fanatical muslims and there are also fanatical jews and christians 

378.22 379.18 B: that's true 

381.74 384.56 B: yeah you are totally right yeah 

384.71 386.83 A: (( i mean ah ah )) 

387.30 393.80 A: it is something like two per cent of the population of israel are actually orthodox jews 

393.75 394.79 B: mhm 

393.90 405.66 A: and who is in power the orthodox jews surprise surprise i can't but wonder i can't help but wonder what exactly would happen were that situation to reverse 

398.13 399.48 B: [laughter] 

405.58 406.36 B: mhm 

406.68 409.62 B: yeah i i don't know i mean and also 

409.49 423.65 B: one thing is like you know palestinians are fighting for their independence or you know whatever but they enjoy palestinians who are citizens of israel enjoy full voting rights they have you know their eve- all their rights are protected you know they are 

422.64 423.58 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

423.54 424.82 B: (( legitimate )) 

424.84 431.11 B: citizens you know it's not like they're you know subhuman or something like that you know that's not the case [noise] 

430.72 432.31 A: yeah absolutely 

432.05 444.06 B: yeah i mean if they if they can vote you know they they vote for whoever is in power and there is a significant minority of them you know it is not just like you know it's probably more than two per cent you know 

432.79 434.17 A: (( there is i mean )) 

445.24 447.79 A: i mean ah let's face it like ah [noise] 

447.80 451.36 A: if you read the ah the the israel's ah 

451.56 456.93 A: ah equivalent of their declaration of independ- you know their their their whatever 

456.87 457.93 B: mhm 

457.68 466.37 A: it's you know everyone is equal man woman you know muslim jewish arabic whatever 

460.18 461.15 B: yeah 

466.49 467.44 B: mhm 

466.86 470.69 A: everyone is equal everyone has the right to vote and all that 

470.41 471.64 B: yeah 

471.19 471.95 A: (( [noise] )) 

472.12 480.87 A: and and nothing but i'm sorry but [noise] it is not exactly like one can say oh look what a terrible job israel has done i mean 

473.23 474.35 B: (( and there )) 

480.13 484.93 B: yeah yeah you're right yeah i mean i definitely agree with you 

480.98 482.32 A: [laughter] 

482.34 484.09 A: you turned a desert 

485.49 490.70 A: they turned a desert into arable land i mean that's nothing to sneeze at 

490.12 491.42 B: yeah 

491.60 494.14 A: look we can feed ourselves hey 

493.90 507.04 B: [laughter] yeah no it's definitely it's i don't know it's sad it's really sad but at the same time it is also like really frustrating because it is like what else you know what else can israel do to to make 

507.05 512.52 B: you know peace when it is clear that there is palestinians who completely don't want it you know 

512.57 513.93 A: yeah 

514.08 514.84 B: (( so )) 

515.14 528.96 A: the real problem is that you've got a few dissatisfied people on both ends and most of the people are just caught in the middle all they want to do is just live out their lives get on with things and not worry about it 

528.37 530.07 B: yeah 

530.49 541.51 A: and which is which is the way it usually works in life you've got a couple of really dissatisfied people all the rest of the world are saying look we just want to get on with our lives and go on with the way things are working we are happy 

530.58 531.85 B: (( yeah you're right )) 

541.56 543.36 B: yeah 

543.47 544.28 A: (( [lipsmack] i don't know )) 

544.74 546.50 B: (( i know it's frustrating huh )) 

547.13 549.32 A: (( yeah )) 

548.70 549.56 B: yeah 

549.99 555.30 A: [noise] i know for me it is a bit of a problem because i side with israel and my girlfriend sides with palestine 

556.17 558.46 B: say that again oh she sides with palestine 

558.73 561.85 A: yeah so it makes for some interesting arguments [laughter] 

561.40 566.42 B: [laughter] yeah political debates [laughter] among like ah couples are always ah 

566.43 568.16 B: [laughter] kind of creepy 

568.38 575.83 A: yeah i mean like but the thing i point out that i don't side with israel just because i'm jewish 'cause you know i mean 

569.05 570.05 B: yeah 

576.02 585.80 A: yes i am jewish but it's that's not the only reason if i felt that you know israel were being unfair that would be the wrong thing but i just happen to agree with them you know 

576.12 576.87 B: mhm 

585.25 599.89 B: yeah like i have a um i have a jewish i'm not jewish but i have a jewish girlfriend who buddied in israel and is very jewish um so that's you know i definitely am heavily influenced by her point of views you know but 

590.19 591.02 A: right
