22.73 23.57 A: i 

22.83 27.08 B: that's a hell of a topic for today don't you think 

25.07 28.66 A: yeah i think that could go on and on for hours i believe 

28.38 30.44 B: [laughter] more than ten minutes 

31.07 32.91 A: for how man- how long [laughter] 

31.24 32.21 B: okay 

33.28 40.62 B: what do i think let me see what i think i think that america needs to think about minding their own ps and qs for once 

41.38 43.93 A: (( well i think you're probably )) 

43.97 46.56 A: probably right to an extent there ah 

46.81 50.04 A: (( we got a lot of things we need to address at home )) 

49.95 55.26 B: [mn] i'm listening to how much money this is going to cost and you know i live in new york city where do you live 

55.20 59.61 A: oh i'm in texas they put us a long ways apart didn't they 

56.67 57.80 B: oh 

58.64 70.59 B: yeah see and we've got very different so you in a more of a rural suburban area and i'm in the urban area so you know in a city like new york we got urban issues for real 

65.74 67.86 A: (( yeah where are you at in new york )) 

70.31 73.04 A: i i mean i can't imagine what kind of issues 

72.26 87.17 B: so i can't see spending this money on these are not your people this is not your problem and you are not the world police and nobody has to think like you and more than anything else the religious part bothers me these people are muslims 

87.05 100.62 B: why are you over there sending these little missionaries over i don't want i just i just don't get america so i really don't i'm i'm fed up with america so i'm not the one to have this conversation i think they need to mind their own business 

99.87 107.35 A: [laughter] yeah i i can see your point to an extent but you look at ah look at the french during the german war 

107.45 108.91 A: you know ah 

109.07 112.61 A: they waited until they marched down the main street 

113.16 119.34 A: of france and took it over and then boy they sure wanted our help then you know or they needed somebody to help them out you know 

118.40 130.82 B: they need money i know this but you can't but seems to me they should learn from their past experiences with these people any people you've been you've been in a such as history pieces of you've been in these situations before 

125.51 126.61 A: (( well yeah )) 

130.71 144.07 B: why is everybody leaning on you because first of all they know you're gullible you are ready to jump in and this is not about nothing other than what america can get out of it it is not about helping these people because they don't have that big a heart 

143.14 151.32 A: no that's for sure they've been fighting forever and they will keep fighting forever you know ah i don't think they're ever going to stop 

148.90 160.02 B: [noise] right they were fine until they put the jews over their saudi told them don't put those jews over here we don't need them we ain't we don't owe them nothing germany did them an injustice germany owes something i don't owe them nothing 

160.01 168.34 B: and he told them not to put them over there and they made a deal not to put them over there with that president but that president died and a new one got in and said i didn't make a deal with you 

166.37 168.23 A: (( [laughter] yeah they ah )) 

168.28 171.40 A: yeah they did changed it around yeah you're right 

170.69 175.02 B: so now here and that's the crux of their problem 

172.26 180.94 A: [noise] yep i you know i don't know i think i think somebody has to do a little world policing though or 

180.85 182.82 B: but why does it have to be america 

181.11 187.63 A: you know we would just i you know i don't think there is anybody else that has any common enough common 

188.51 190.43 A: sense and that would 

189.81 197.10 B: well see you are assuming that america has common sense i don't think they have common sense i think they're a bunch of hypocrites and liars 

190.59 192.31 A: be able to do it 

193.78 195.35 A: well 

196.41 206.07 A: yeah but you know that didn't hit you in the heart when they come over there and they bombed the towers right right in your backyard and killed all them innocent people for no darn reason at all 

197.45 199.10 B: and thieves 

204.62 209.56 B: (( i don't know who did that i don't believe nothing that come out of america's mouth )) 

208.31 210.92 A: well it sure was no americans that did it 

210.18 214.43 B: i don't know who did it i wasn't down there 

212.13 213.52 A: [noise] you know 

214.66 222.52 B: i didn't see the pilots so i don't know who did it and i am believe me i believe anything before i believe what america say 

215.43 217.24 A: i don't either but 

217.91 219.53 A: (( well )) 

222.43 228.14 A: [noise] oh yeah well they drag dragged them out they dragged them off of the aeroplanes you know with with 

228.58 232.52 A: ah razors in their shoes and everything else so i mean 

231.31 234.64 B: but those weren't arabs those were americans 

234.06 243.53 A: no they were arabs that had come over here and had posed as imposed as americans you know it is darned easy to get into our country you know and pose as an american 

241.42 243.25 B: yeah now that's the 

243.23 257.53 B: but you would think that america would not be so trusting but i think nine one one showed america that nobody loves america that showed them how much they're hated throughout the world 

243.75 247.26 A: and any fool can come over here and take it and do 

248.72 249.57 A: it 

255.75 259.56 A: yo- well yes you're right directives over there they do

509.97 511.92 B: yeah 

510.37 516.64 A: and we spent a ton of money on their guys but i just think i'm worried about this thing lingering on you know 

517.09 519.02 A: and just going and going 

517.57 520.61 B: and how much you see how much they say it's going to cost us 

519.96 521.91 A: oh i can imagine yeah 

520.98 528.20 B: and i don't think they were ever they're not going to have any peace how are you going to put these two different set of people together 

525.52 526.57 A: you can't 

528.21 533.26 B: (( these people don't want those jews there send them jews somewhere else )) 

531.26 532.07 A: no 

533.37 536.39 A: yeah and the jews say that it's theirs 

533.52 535.36 B: and then they will have peace 

536.49 539.12 B: how they figure that's theirs and they just got there 

538.97 543.58 A: i i don't know but they they both think it is all their own country is [noise] what i understand 

542.49 548.24 B: that country belongs to palestine i don't know how the jews figure it belongs to them i don't understand that yet 

547.96 549.67 A: (( [laughter] well [laughter] i don't know )) 

549.14 555.41 B: they just got there in the forties when they got there arafat was sitting there so how in the world is it theirs 

556.75 560.36 B: (( man i don't understand )) 

559.22 561.05 A: i don't neither their [sigh] 

562.57 567.84 B: well that's the crux of the problem get rid of israel and you you got some peace 

568.26 569.58 A: you think that's 

568.34 571.21 B: because because they don't want them there 

569.78 573.83 A: well i think they've got them scattered out so darn far and wide you know like 

573.51 576.73 B: but it would seem like it would be enough land for everybody 

576.74 590.57 B: but i think this is the principle they are fighting over it can't be the land there's enough land for both people to live there i believe that it's the principle that people trying to push these jews on these muslims and they don't want them 

580.78 583.28 A: right it's yeah it's the 

584.80 586.77 A: principle and yep 

590.56 593.70 B: that's what i think they are fighting about 

592.30 599.71 A: yep yep it's a religious war it's always always has been and and i guess it will always be until one of them 

596.79 599.89 B: yeah yeah yeah and that's worse
