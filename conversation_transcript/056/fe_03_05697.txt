191.80 192.88 B: yeah 

191.83 197.13 A: one of the big things that goes on down there that's how they make their bread and butter is like kidnapping american tourists

222.12 228.59 A: [noise] well yeah it's it's it's a big trade in a lot of the south american countries is when you know an american tourist goes down there 

228.78 229.71 A: they 

229.91 235.26 A: are sending their you know we've probably got well compared to their situation we've got a lotta money so they can get a 

235.28 242.34 A: pretty big ransom for for the people they kidnap they're not doing it to to kill 'em but you know just to get some money 

235.51 236.86 B: oh i see

250.69 262.74 A: i think we're we're allies with with the gov- with the governments i think we're aligned to them but this is going on with the the drug cartels and the the independent people it's not not s- 

263.07 268.09 A: so much a political political thing on the outside anyway 

269.04 273.87 B: oh hm well if we're allies like can't we just give them money you know 

274.59 278.68 A: well the the people who are doing the kidnapping oh you mean as far as as improving their 

279.24 280.47 B: yeah 

279.88 289.52 A: improving their life well it's i i'm sure we do give give money and aid to them but yeah a lot of times when when we send aid to other countries it's 

284.08 284.96 B: yeah 

289.76 295.13 A: it it you know gets taken by the b- by the bad guys by the criminals 

294.46 297.51 B: really how do they get it 

295.36 296.25 A: (( yeah ah i )) 

297.37 299.89 A: um don't know but 

299.53 300.44 B: (( oh )) 

300.34 304.87 A: but there's you know there's still a problem with once you get the money there it's distributing it to the ah 

304.88 306.35 A: people who need it 

307.00 312.23 B: oh 'cause we were giving money to like almost every country that needs it 

311.28 313.06 A: yeah 

312.77 320.06 B: and like a lot of countries they don't pay back like i don't know if there there's any cases now but i know that there was 

320.24 325.70 B: like a lot of cases a long time ago and we still haven't gotten paid back 

325.78 329.65 B: and the money was just considered as a gift 

329.38 331.03 A: (( yeah that that's happened where you )) 

331.35 336.86 A: know when somebody needs help we might as well give it out as a loan and then when it turns out that 

336.94 344.29 A: you know they still haven't their economy still hasn't come back enough for them to pay us back it does end up being a gift and sometimes 

342.65 346.16 B: and then we have to and then our economy suffers 

346.12 347.96 A: right well 

347.38 348.30 B: kind of 

348.62 353.28 A: yeah it does it's i think our economy suffers for a lot of reasons though 

353.36 357.27 B: yeah it just adds on to that effect 

357.65 359.64 A: mhm 

362.77 366.33 A: what do you what do you think about iran i'm a- 

366.76 367.84 B: (( oh iran )) 

367.76 378.23 A: yeah remember president bush named them as one of the axis of evil that you know i never really heard anything else about iran i've been hearing a lot about iraq and south korea but 

375.08 376.12 B: yeah 

376.86 379.41 B: yeah iran's been quiet so far 

379.21 382.53 A: yeah they have been 

382.98 385.56 B: yeah iraq i heard about how um 

386.14 400.20 B: th- they were electing the lea- leaders leaders for iraq like a a city with like millions of people there was a couple thousand trying 

398.34 401.29 A: (( mhm )) 

400.65 401.69 B: to um 

402.12 403.63 B: get a position 

404.36 405.42 B: leader 

406.15 408.70 B: di- did you hear me er because there's like beeps 

408.51 409.99 A: yeah i i heard 

409.28 410.18 B: okay 

410.14 412.48 A: yeah 

411.87 419.77 B: on the news i was watching how this woman got a position as a secretary or something and she was saying how she was going to serve her people 

420.32 421.67 B: iraqi woman 

422.70 426.94 A: yeah and that's what we ah we had talked about doing all along with setting up a 

426.91 427.75 B: (( mhm )) 

427.15 431.02 A: new government in iraq you know run by the arab by the iraqi people 

431.16 434.16 A: and it's still trying to get them on their feet after the war 

434.20 441.79 A: where they just turned over some of the cities the policing back over toward to their police departments that were running them before and 

441.96 442.89 B: uh-huh 

442.78 445.94 A: that's slowly picking the american presence out 

446.25 448.53 A: to their to take care of their day to day 

448.95 450.05 A: business 

449.14 451.29 B: do you think do you think that um 

451.81 454.45 B: democracy is going to work in iraq 

455.48 457.29 A: i hope so i i 

457.12 459.37 B: yeah so do i but 

458.56 459.65 A: the the 

459.73 463.41 A: thing is there's just such a history of 

463.47 466.63 A: leaderships you know and and 

466.73 471.78 A: things have to be going good for a long time for people to start trusting in a democracy 

471.92 482.93 A: and if things don't start going well at the beginning oh you know people over there get desperate and they start listening to you know these people who like saddam who come into power 

471.94 472.88 B: yeah 

483.51 491.07 A: you know they're promising to make life better but a lot of times they're you know not democratic they want to run things thei- their own way 

489.15 490.03 B: yeah 

491.25 498.40 B: like some people they they'll probably love the new democratic government and some people will 

498.66 501.57 B: they probably like the old government better 

501.92 505.39 B: and they'll try to overthrow it or something 

502.19 503.91 A: yeah 

505.74 509.78 A: once yeah that's that's another one of the problems if the the old government you know 

510.65 519.21 A: so few people had so much power and and were getting kick backs from everything that went on with the government that's i think that's why we're getting a lot of 

519.35 523.27 A: attacks on our troops now people are still loyal to saddam 

523.70 524.42 A: (( live )) 

523.92 525.51 B: yeah 

524.67 529.71 A: in a democracy supposedly you know you it's fair for everyone and no-one gets a 

530.30 541.58 B: yeah it's like a little too late to change like if you come to america from from another country and you're really young you learn the language in in a matter of months but if you're 

541.68 553.37 B: in middle age it's going to take you a long time to learn the language it's the same thing here like a lot of them they're too used to the their old type of government 

553.21 558.02 A: yeah that's true people get prejudiced as you get older you know you get stuck in your ways 

558.11 567.78 B: yeah but if they're the kids they're younger they'll just you know they don't they haven't lived too long in the saddam government 

560.80 562.60 A: mhm 

570.76 576.42 A: [noise] yeah and well hopefully it'll work you know the democracy will work out because a lot of what i've seen about 

574.52 575.36 B: (( yeah )) 

576.69 579.95 A: you know saddam's regime it was very bloody and 

580.09 583.15 A: you know of his sons were just 

582.20 583.77 B: did they find saddam 

583.66 586.03 A: no not yet 

585.31 587.13 B: ah is he dead 

587.37 599.03 A: no they ah he just released a statement i think last week and and they say that they think it was they're pretty sure it was made within the last couple of weeks where they think he's still alive 

599.26 599.89 B: (( ah ))
