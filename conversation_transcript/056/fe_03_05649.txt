0.79 2.16 A: (( hello )) 

1.83 5.42 B: uh hi my name's ken i'm in uh jersey city new jersey 

5.33 8.57 A: oh my name is paul and i'm in san francisco 

9.01 12.40 A: [noise] we got an [laughter] we got an echo do you hear it 

9.23 11.39 B: oh hello [laughter] 

12.08 15.12 B: uh no i don't hear it on this end 

13.95 20.99 A: okay well i used to work in jersey city many years ago [laughter] yeah at journal square uh-huh 

18.03 19.11 B: oh really 

20.50 24.01 B: okay i'm downtown uh one subway stop away 

24.42 26.61 A: right right by the uh path 

26.52 29.48 B: [lipsmack] uh yeah yeah i'm down by the newport mall 

29.31 34.29 A: okay well it's been a long time but [laughter] did work there 

31.93 33.04 B: [laughter] 

34.01 35.47 B: (( [mn] um )) 

34.62 37.66 A: well how do you feel about this [noise] 

35.59 36.37 B: okay 

37.73 43.43 B: um well i i can't see how it could not 

44.02 57.85 B: lessen the chance of a of another hijacking they've got sky marshals they've got um they've got pilots with guns there's extra screening and extra careful screening at the airports now that they didn't used to have 

57.86 61.39 B: so and also a a another thing i don't know if this is 

61.29 70.62 B: quite on the subject but i think you know passengers after what happened on september eleventh know that they're pretty much doomed if the plane is hijacked so i would imagine that [sigh] 

70.43 76.60 B: the you know passengers would pretty much attack whoever was trying to hijack the plane just to save themselves 

75.99 78.11 A: mhm [noise] oh i think so too 

77.95 86.19 B: so um you know i think it was like a one shot deal i can't imagine that if there's ever another hijacked plane that you know whoever tried to hijack it 

86.51 87.75 B: (( wouldn't you know )) 

88.23 90.95 B: wouldn't succeed with whatever they were trying to do 

90.72 96.20 A: [sigh] mhm [sigh] yeah i think they're on top of it too myself um 

96.87 106.41 A: although you know you never know you never know [sigh] um and i think that people are like you said are really watching out for each other 

106.31 108.11 B: yeah 

106.56 110.61 A: you know like here for instance if if i've noticed with myself 

110.79 116.44 A: you know i put a bag down and like somebody was there immediately saying is that your bag you know [sigh] 

115.73 117.58 B: mhm 

116.64 125.53 A: you know so people are like watching out they're alert you know to what's going on i think they're doing everything they can possibly you know 

124.43 134.32 B: yeah yeah i mean i think if they uh were to you know plant somebody in an airport they could sneak you know things on to planes that you know 

134.62 147.88 B: that would be the only you know i would imagine one of the only ways that they could really get away with anything now just because the security has been stepped up before september eleventh the security was really bad i used to fly out of newark all the time and these people weren't even paying attention [mn] 

144.35 145.72 A: (( [noise] mhm [noise] [noise] oh )) 

147.60 150.69 A: yeah i hear ya it was very slack [noise] 

150.22 163.20 B: my brother lives out in california he li- well he used to live in lake tahoe and uh he had a friend [laughter] who was ex military and i don't knew where he got this grenade but he one day uh was 

163.10 172.72 B: was flying and he packed a grenade in his carry on bag [laughter] and uh i and these people are idiots out there but anyway [laughter] he got on the plane with a grenade 

173.63 176.40 A: (( [noise] [noise] oh god [mn] [mn] that's amazing )) 

175.36 184.36 B: yeah [laughter] he just kept saying i can't believe i got on the plane with a bomb he said he didn't didn't realize until he was actually on the plane that you know exactly [laughter] what he had done 

176.55 177.45 A: yes 

184.76 197.93 A: yeah i i um i don't know now days when i fly i i can't wait for the plane to land and it's not it's not that it's just the whole the whole thing you know what i'm saying [laughter] it's i don't feel 

198.13 200.29 A: comfortable up there anymore 

199.70 201.38 B: mm i 

200.44 201.44 A: (( so )) 

202.38 203.46 A: (( go ahead )) 

202.87 214.84 B: oh i i i feel just the opposite i think that you know being up there's probably one of the safest places to be i uh i'm leery about crowded places in new york i don't like the idea of being around times square grand central station 

213.53 214.73 A: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

214.75 215.75 A: uh-huh 

215.61 228.54 B: because i think those places are much more dangerous like you know a car bomb could go off in times square or like you know a suicide bomber in grand central station um i think is a lot more probable than another airline hijacking 

228.87 234.27 A: [noise] yeah you know of course you live on the east coast [laughter] you know and uh 

234.83 238.03 A: you're you guys are really like 

238.95 246.89 A: exposed to a lot more than we are here on the west coast although we're a target too i mean you know we got the the golden gate bridge as they keep bringing that up 

246.46 248.10 B: (( huh mhm )) 

247.20 253.06 A: but you guys over on the east coast man i can just imagine how people's nerves are 

252.84 261.46 B: well they they keep saying in the paper the police keep saying that it's not um a matter of if but a matter of when there'll be another terrorist strike 

259.69 262.89 A: right right yeah [sigh] 

261.88 268.74 B: and uh you know i mean they they're trying to kill as many people as possible so you just i just try to avoid crowded places 

268.81 271.46 B: times square's pretty annoying anyway [laughter] 

271.16 274.00 A: mhm ri- i heard they've really cleaned it up though 

273.47 278.09 B: oh yeah tremendously it's nothing like it was ten fifteen years ago um 

276.90 285.08 A: well i used to live there in the late sixties early seventies and it was really [laughter] a cesspool 

284.51 290.30 B: yeah and it got worse through the seventies and some time in the round the eighties they started cleaning it up and uh 

286.10 286.69 A: (( [noise] )) 

286.89 288.04 A: (( oh did it mhm mhm )) 

290.18 301.76 B: now it's it's mobbed it's just throngs of tourists and people are meandering and you you know it's hard to get to the theater it's hard to get out of the theater [laughter] i don't like going through that area at all 

302.23 308.19 B: but just because i've become an impatient new yorker and i just want to push people out of my way [laughter] 

307.49 311.78 A: well you want to get there [laughter] right
