9.27 10.46 A: mhm 

11.95 17.66 A: oh yeah actually quite a bit it's been pretty awful lately so what do you think about airport security 

14.80 15.84 B: oh yeah 

16.96 23.08 B: well it's it's i think it's a good thing i mean obviously [noise] if it pre- prevents any kind of 

22.93 24.68 A: yeah i would agree with you 

23.32 27.76 B: future disaster i mean you know that's that's always a good thing 

27.05 32.49 A: mhm i would just say anybody who is truly bent on terrorism can probably pull it off regardless 

31.99 45.41 B: well yeah there's i mean we obv- obviously we hear about all the the incidents where people you know get through get through security with with a you know knife or something but 

41.30 42.41 A: mhm 

43.42 50.36 A: in fact i was i just saw in line the other day a place that sells knives made out of plastic of all things just pretty creepy 

50.13 51.45 B: oh yeah yeah 

50.54 53.64 A: but yeah you know i i do support the whole ah 

53.89 56.32 A: keeping terrorists off planes as best we can 

56.02 57.36 B: oh sure sure 

56.76 57.52 A: (( but )) 

57.98 60.70 A: you you've you've flown recently oh 

59.99 67.79 B: um not recently but i but i used to fly quite a bit so most most of it before ah nine eleven unfortunately so 

63.05 64.15 A: yeah 

67.18 70.27 A: have you flown before nine have you flown since nine eleven 

69.75 71.73 B: yeah yeah just a couple of times 

71.18 73.61 A: how was it i i haven't been up yet so 

72.94 78.93 B: oh yeah it's it's it wasn't bad um security has alw- always been pretty good here at orlando airport and ah 

77.50 78.52 A: oh really 

78.82 81.16 A: which which airport do you fly out of 

80.32 83.25 B: orlando international yeah ah 

81.53 82.49 A: oh okay 

83.31 84.55 B: the 

84.99 87.00 B: (( um [noise] i got to guess we were )) 

87.35 93.13 B: a test flight for a couple of the new things they had ah one of the things was um 

90.35 91.41 A: (( oh yeah )) 

93.38 102.66 B: where you walk behind a screen and they they actually i guess xray your whole body i mean you're you're you're basically standing there naked in in front of the screen 

98.51 99.94 A: (( [cough] mhm )) 

102.31 103.61 A: (( oh that's nuts )) 

102.82 106.45 B: but yeah that it didn't go over real big 

106.61 111.65 B: at first but ah i think people have gotten used to it so and it it was on a 

107.77 108.69 A: (( mm )) 

109.20 110.36 A: yeah 

112.60 122.75 B: when they started it was on a volunteer basis you know none of us felt comfortable with that so but but again you know if it if it stops one incident then 

114.33 116.09 A: mhm 

116.94 120.19 A: [laughter] i understand 

122.31 136.18 A: yeah no i truly understand i mean there's there's issues of privacy and so should be concerned about too but i think flying is sort of an elective thing so i can understand the entire security have you ever run into one of those ah i read about these the other day these machines that can 

122.88 124.23 B: (( [noise] )) 

130.86 131.63 B: yeah 

136.70 140.27 A: they somehow sense explosives and traces thereof 

139.65 141.12 B: oh yeah yeah 

140.36 144.06 A: yeah because i was i was have you ever run into one of those all 

143.23 146.24 B: no i've never come across any of 'em but 

144.14 156.19 A: right 'cause i ran into a review by some guy apparently got pulled off and actually got like strip searched because he'd been out to a shooting range with a revolver the day before so he had like yeah traces of gun powder on his hands didn't actually bother to wash his hands 

151.48 155.38 B: (( oh like gun powder [noise] yeah )) 

155.94 156.84 B: yeah 

156.26 159.61 A: so that kind of creeps me out but 

157.75 162.90 B: oh yeah yeah well a a similar situation for 

163.99 171.96 B: where you know in orlando here we have a lot of people going from miami up up north with with with either drugs or drug money coming in from south are 

168.36 169.63 A: mhm 

171.02 172.81 A: oh yeah that's true are 

173.13 175.62 B: (( you there oh yeah )) 

173.66 174.59 A: (( you still there )) 

174.62 177.52 A: all right my phone might done weird things 

175.99 186.69 B: okay and ah it's you know it's not uncommon for people to have money has has traces of drugs on it even though they have nothing to do with drugs i mean 

186.05 191.25 A: yeah i've heard about that apparently like every like twenty dollar bill has a trace of cocaine on it supposedly 

190.68 198.68 B: yeah yeah so you know you never really know know for sure what what you're handling if it's exchanged by the public so 

191.28 193.69 A: most of 'em yeah 

195.40 197.71 A: (( yeah )) 

198.19 201.02 A: this this is true and of course i kind of like the 

201.11 204.84 A: the idea that money itself is illegal simply because of the trace of drugs on it 

204.35 205.62 B: yeah yeah 

204.97 208.19 A: it's it's a very interesting concept there 

207.69 209.03 B: oh yeah yeah 

208.41 209.44 A: yeah 

209.06 210.28 B: now the um 

210.49 218.53 B: um i'm trying to think of some- something else about the air the airport security um the the the one thing i'm not that crazy about is the 

218.68 225.16 B: um the deal where they recommend that you don't lock your luggage um yeah 

222.72 224.47 A: that's ridiculous 

224.50 228.85 A: that's that's used to invite disaster but they really do that 

226.44 227.93 B: yeah yeah 

228.26 231.60 B: oh yeah yeah um because [noise] 

229.04 230.62 A: huh [cough] 

231.65 233.38 B: it's it's 

233.61 240.90 B: it's available for for searching you know they they check every bag now whether it's checked or not checked so [noise] 

235.68 236.96 A: mhm 

239.85 242.13 A: but they they search it outside your presence 

241.90 243.93 B: yeah yeah yeah 

242.84 245.01 A: oh i think that would make me uncomfortable 

244.22 249.00 B: as it goes through between the counter and the and the airplane 

248.96 261.68 B: so and it's it's it's just a random thing i think they xray everything but but but they but they can open any one they want and they say if you lock it then they're going to break open your bag so 

251.80 253.53 A: mhm 

253.89 255.30 A: that seems reasonable 

261.49 262.49 A: man 

261.85 266.28 B: um so they they recommend that you don't lock your suitcases any more 

266.16 276.19 A: now that's odd see the i've only flown twice and and i mean two round trips both times i just had a carry on so i never had that experience but i would think that they would actually search that at the check in counter 

268.19 270.52 B: uh-huh [noise] 

271.53 273.36 B: right yeah 

275.69 276.89 B: yeah it's 

276.36 278.29 A: that's i wonder why they do it that way 

277.99 279.49 B: yeah it's it's 

280.17 285.96 B: and of course some people say well just put like um one of those plastic twist tie things 

285.54 287.35 A: mhm 

286.63 289.52 B: twist wrap [noise] seals on there or something like that but of 

289.57 295.82 B: course you have to have something to cut it with at the other end so [laughter] you can't you can't carry your your knife or your nail clippers so 

291.44 293.15 A: right 

293.30 295.50 A: (( yeah )) 

295.60 299.27 A: that's true i took like a three inch folding knife the first time i went through was in 

299.82 310.65 A: it would have been ninety eight i think and i took like a three inch folding knife on the plane they didn't say a thing about it i mean they have they'd have they'd give me a body cavity search these days if i tried that 

301.23 302.79 B: uh-huh [noise] 

304.38 305.39 B: oh yeah 

306.15 306.90 B: (( no )) 

310.07 313.18 B: oh okay [laughter] yeah 

311.01 321.09 A: yeah although i dare say that ah terrorists wouldn't have too great a time trying to hijack a plane if there they had some pretty heavy hardware i think people'd just go and beat them down 

318.35 319.72 B: oh yeah oh yeah 

320.55 323.91 B: yeah yeah [noise] yeah they um 

321.19 322.90 A: yeah 

324.52 336.84 B: everybody i i found out the hard way i have a pair of shoes that i didn't realize that my dinner just regular you know tie up dress shoes that apparently must have a um a small piece of metal or something in in like the arch support 

331.31 333.06 A: mhm 

335.69 338.12 A: oh man yeah 

337.09 347.46 B: i mean i didn't know and and every time i've wore those they they had i had to take my shoes off and they'd run 'em back through the xray machine and this that and the other and finally i said well the heck with that i'm just not going to wear 

339.78 341.69 A: mhm 

346.99 348.14 A: (( are )) 

350.72 351.87 B: (( them )) 

351.06 352.46 A: (( you still there )) 

352.62 355.07 A: (( you say the heck with them i'm just not going to wear the shoes )) 

352.63 353.95 B: (( [mn] um )) 

355.28 357.42 B: (( yeah yeah uh-huh )) 

356.36 365.51 A: my my my phone has a weird speaker thing going on i'm not sure what is up with it but yeah that's that's pretty creepy i i actually wore a pair of steel toed boots 

358.35 360.97 B: (( oh okay [laughter] )) 

362.48 363.28 B: oh 

365.10 366.16 B: okay 

365.35 374.64 A: too when when i flew they just knew anything about it it just weighed me down it didn't hit the shoes and yeah i think ever since what was that kid's name he had the shoe bomb or something 

367.72 369.20 B: oh yeah 

369.69 371.23 B: yeah yeah 

374.01 376.85 B: (( oh yeah yeah )) 

374.86 379.63 A: i can't remember his name anyway yeah ever since that i think i'm going to be a little more careful 

378.77 386.49 B: but i mean there's just just there's just so many ways that that that somebody could do something i mean 

383.67 385.43 A: (( oh yeah )) 

385.49 386.42 A: (( mm )) 

386.58 392.50 A: it's always it's always you know like computer security if somebody is determined you can pull it off just people aren't that determined 

390.44 391.64 B: oh yeah yeah 

392.65 394.36 B: (( yeah )) 

393.33 399.37 A: then again it goes to say in retrospect i'm kind of surprised the u._s. never deal with terrorists in the past you know 

400.08 400.73 B: (( no )) 

400.56 402.42 A: at least not to this extent 

401.81 403.87 B: yeah yeah 

402.89 406.91 A: because there's a lot of foreign policy that we've got that just isn't that popular 

406.27 408.26 B: (( oh that's that's true that's true )) 

407.47 408.51 A: mhm 

409.37 419.08 B: it seems like sometimes we're darned if we do and darned if we don't you know we go into to try to help somebody and and and they don't like us and if we don't help them they they yell and wonder why 

412.20 413.73 A: (( oh yeah you know totally )) 

418.64 420.17 A: yeah precisely there's 

420.61 425.43 A: certain complications involved i mean the world's well maybe the only superpower these days i don't know 

425.25 427.20 B: yeah but 

426.99 429.07 A: we've got most of the guns i know that much 

428.69 432.16 B: oh yeah oh yeah but the um 

429.36 430.97 A: yeah 

432.48 434.70 B: so so whereabouts in indiana are you 

434.65 441.73 A: i'm actually from north ah you know you know where fort wayne is okay i come like from a little town west of there about like thirty minutes 

437.62 438.61 B: (( yeah oh )) 

441.25 442.20 B: okay 

442.38 445.70 A: but i'm actually down in bloomington going to indiana university now 

445.02 446.91 B: oh good good 

446.33 450.23 A: and i'm kind of graduating and have a new job so i'll see how that turns out 

449.13 451.36 B: [laughter] yeah right wish you luck 

450.90 452.03 A: hey thanks 

451.71 453.09 B: yeah the the you 

453.36 456.94 B: know you guys you guys do get some some pretty cold winters up there don't you 

456.37 458.17 A: oh yeah the last one was pretty bad 

458.08 458.98 B: (( right )) 

458.30 463.93 A: now it's it's just sweltering fortunately we've got a pool in the apartment complex so that's cool what what do you do 

459.91 460.82 B: oh 

461.83 462.94 B: that helps 

463.75 465.84 B: (( um well i work for the post office )) 

465.40 466.55 A: oh cool 

466.74 469.27 B: actually i'm just about ready to retire so 

468.93 470.02 A: really 

469.53 472.16 B: oh yeah yeah yeah 

470.35 473.64 A: good for you that's that's i wish i could jump ahead to that stage 

472.62 479.73 B: [laughter] yeah but the down side is you're you're getting older so you know you can't have it both 

477.38 483.01 A: yeah that's true but may- maybe if i could have both i will just go buy a lottery ticket this weekend i'm sure that'll pull it off 

481.24 486.08 B: (( i'll say that's that's the best thing to do is win the lottery and then be set )) 

484.01 485.07 A: yeah 

485.53 489.77 A: (( that's that's my retirement plan right there i'm glad to talk to you whoever worked this out )) 

487.11 488.13 B: (( yeah )) 

489.38 494.32 B: yeah yeah the other the what's it called powerball up up your 

489.82 491.98 A: [laughter] 

493.95 498.52 A: yeah yeah it's i never really buy i buy scratch off once in a while sort of as a 

494.58 495.67 B: (( way yeah )) 

497.14 498.04 B: (( oh )) 

498.61 504.44 A: look i'm wasting money kind of thing and i don't have much faith in the lotteries to be quite honest given given the odds you know 

500.02 501.27 B: yeah yeah 

502.32 503.29 B: (( yeah )) 

503.94 505.58 B: (( yeah that's true that's true )) 

504.80 510.58 A: but yeah my folks used to buy when i used to live with them um powerball every week just you know in case 

510.15 519.29 B: yeah for some reason they have it in georgia but they don't have it they don't have it in florida so i mean i don't know why maybe because we have one lottery or something or state lottery so 

512.91 513.80 A: do they 

515.00 516.42 A: yeah 

517.41 518.48 A: mhm 

519.50 520.64 B: (( but )) 

520.03 522.45 A: so there's an impression that powerball is just like a 

522.72 527.03 A: four or five state like cooperative thing i'm not too clear on how that works 

526.43 529.58 B: yeah it's i guess it's just it's really scattered 

529.77 533.21 B: around the country whichever states have chosen to participate 

532.55 534.38 A: mhm 

533.31 537.67 B: but from what i understand most states that have do have their own lottery like you know like florida 

537.14 538.03 A: (( uh-huh )) 

537.82 543.52 B: they they don't want to lose any money from that so they decided not to go with the powerball thing 

542.66 545.52 A: i guess i can understand that i can understand that 

543.65 544.76 B: yeah 

545.66 546.87 B: (( yeah )) 

545.93 551.84 A: my worst case scenario is you know you buy some books for some school kids and they pay some bureaucrats 

549.51 550.80 B: (( yeah )) 

551.74 553.56 B: (( that's right right )) 

551.87 561.55 A: may- maybe the thing with the bureaucrats isn't exactly the best way to go about doing it but yeah until we have socialized health cover no place to bitch about it mhm 

554.01 557.10 B: [laughter] [laughter] hey yeah 

558.92 573.53 B: yeah that's right yeah we have some some boxes where you'd be better off if you played like five dollars a week in the lottery you would be better off just putting that five dollars in a bank account and and see what you have at at the end so as far as your changes are going about winning it 

568.30 569.33 A: totally 

569.39 570.35 A: (( mm )) 

572.29 574.60 A: stick it in a mutual fund or something although 

573.97 575.60 B: yeah yeah 

574.96 579.19 A: actually these days maybe that's not the best idea i haven't paid much attention to the market 

576.65 578.52 B: (( oh yeah that's true too )) 

578.98 579.80 B: (( yes )) 

579.96 587.95 B: yeah yeah they they say it's they had an article in the paper down here some- somebody was i guess it was a senior citizen was 

588.88 591.67 B: charting the banking system you know 

591.72 599.90 B: i'm glad interest rates are down for people you know buying houses and things but at the same time my dividends are down so far that i'm about ready to just take my money and
