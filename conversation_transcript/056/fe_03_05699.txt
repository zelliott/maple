67.01 69.93 B: ah like the government and the media 

69.03 72.76 A: [cough] the people who are trying to um [mn] 

73.41 83.29 A: let's say you're having a dispute with someone just on a personal level right and you're trying to scare them you might want to put the idea in their head that you're a total lunatic who has no cam-

83.42 86.57 A: you you know who puts no value on life including your own life 

86.28 88.47 B: (( right )) 

87.45 90.38 A: and you know they're doin' that just on a larger level 

91.08 94.69 A: i i think we were asked to mention specifically which countries 

94.41 96.24 B: yeah um 

96.51 100.26 B: i don't know i guess i'm not i don't know exactly which ones 

100.67 102.12 B: would pose a threat 

100.94 104.96 A: [mn] i haven't been interested in world affairs in about the last twenty years or so 

104.40 105.78 B: [laughter] yeah that's true 

105.13 107.89 A: [laughter] i i kind of 

105.90 110.81 B: um i don't i don't know if specific countries or 

111.02 114.22 B: specific people in the countries you know 

113.22 116.92 A: yeah i i i think it's more like ideologies than countries 

116.31 117.74 B: yeah 

117.10 120.90 A: it's people who have a certain way of thinking it doesn't really matter where they live 

120.51 123.07 B: yeah that's true then 

122.87 125.70 A: i guess iraq have to be considered that way 

126.32 128.39 A: afghanistan iran 

128.98 129.98 A: um 

130.93 134.28 A: people any any place with a substantial muslim population 

134.18 136.15 B: yeah um 

136.92 142.27 B: yeah again though i don't i don't know how much of it is the actual government and the actual country [noise] or it's 

142.32 143.30 B: just 

143.31 154.63 B: you know selected citizens of that country that's i don't know i'm not too sure whether or not i would say iraq actually poses a threat or not 

153.48 162.62 A: well they can always pose a threat with um look let's say you just you yourself you were um you just hated the united states like crazy 

162.23 164.16 B: yeah 

162.70 165.01 A: and you want to cause a lot of damage 

165.04 168.27 A: and you didn't care if you got killed yourself in the process 

168.09 170.00 B: yeah 

168.45 170.86 A: just think of all the horrible things you could do 

170.74 172.05 B: yeah 

171.73 176.93 A: then you have the power of the sta- the only thing is look at the stuff hussein did to his own to the kurds 

177.02 179.88 A: to his own people when he didn't do any of that to us 

179.44 181.25 B: yeah 

180.35 186.76 A: 'cause i i i the reason i guess is he was told you do anything like that there's going to be reprisals like you wouldn't believe 

186.44 188.69 B: (( yeah )) 

187.73 190.96 A: so they they aren't as crazy as they pretend to be 

190.69 199.59 B: yeah i i don't know how do you er do you feel safe like do you feel that these are like more attacks could actually 

198.77 207.17 A: i i can't think of anything i ever did in my life i'd i i can't think of any time i ever altered my behaviour out of the fear of terrorism 

205.34 206.21 B: yeah 

206.99 208.48 B: yeah me neither 

207.84 219.86 A: i mean i'm you know they're more afraid of you know like um so- some kid on a skateboard that's smashing into me on the street than than i am from state sponsored terrorism 

216.11 217.49 B: yeah that's true 

219.33 220.64 B: yeah 

219.99 224.52 A: but i guess it's 'cause i've had you know individual acts of recklessness i've been hurt by 

224.12 225.38 B: yeah 

224.73 231.96 A: i haven't been although i was almost at the first world trade centre not the ones with the aeroplane but the ones in ninety three 

231.94 233.57 B: oh yeah the first bombing 

232.29 236.75 A: you know when they blew up i just missed being there it was a complete fluke i wasn't there 

235.93 239.30 B: really where in the where in the city do you live 

236.84 238.09 A: yeah 'cause i li- 

239.00 248.59 A: well i i live in queens but at the time i lived in jersey city i was right i don't know if you know it's directly across the hudson from um from lower manhattan 

242.26 243.47 B: yeah 

248.15 249.46 B: yeah i know the area 

248.75 254.71 A: like i could look out a lot of the terrorists live there also one of them was not the guy who liked looked like santa claus lived about five blocks from me 

254.21 255.48 B: yeah really 

254.78 256.87 A: (( you know the guy with the santa claus hat )) 

256.35 257.22 B: um 

257.61 265.63 A: i was nearly going to the city that day i took the day off from work and the way i go in is there's a subway called the pa- it's like um p._a._t._s. 

265.70 275.42 A: port authority trans hudson it's subway saint jersey into manhattan and i was going to go there and there's a a place in jersey where parking becomes legal at noon 

267.28 268.17 B: yeah 

275.91 290.42 A: so i always plan to get there a few minutes before noon it would be a perfect spot for me to park right near the p._a._t._s. station if i did that and got on the train i figured to be exactly in the spot where it happened you know at the lower level exactly at the time it did 

281.25 282.28 B: yeah 

290.60 293.62 A: but i just happened to be watching a t._v. show 

293.82 296.81 A: and i kinda got interested in what i was watching 

296.47 298.06 B: yeah 

297.43 309.27 A: so i kinda let time lapse and then about twenty minutes after i was by by coincidence the only station channel nine here which wasn't marked off the air 'cause their antenna's on the empire state building not the world trade centre 

308.88 310.02 B: yeah 

309.44 313.29 A: and i was watching and then they said there was just an explosion in the world trade centre 

312.91 313.72 B: (( damn )) 

314.30 319.71 A: so i just missed that one although only six people were killed there and i probably wouldn't have been one of the six 

315.49 317.01 B: wow that's weird 

319.28 323.01 B: yeah and yeah and again you know 

323.24 324.18 B: (( i don't know )) 

325.02 325.84 B: hello 

325.84 326.78 A: yes 

326.65 331.37 B: oh sorry i thought the phone cut off well who's responsible for that bombing there was a 

331.37 335.68 A: that was the guy who lived in jersey city and looked like a [cough] wore a santa claus hat 

335.18 336.56 B: yeah 

336.17 338.52 A: (( you know like a militant islam )) 

338.10 339.62 B: yeah 

339.05 341.86 A: same kinda people with the same kind of ideas 

341.52 343.17 B: yeah 

342.56 346.44 A: although i for the life of me i don't know what it is them people want i can't believe ah 

347.03 349.36 A: [cough] i i don't know what they're so pissed off about 

349.42 355.58 B: yeah i know well yeah it's hard to get the facts straight but i don't think our 

354.98 357.61 A: yes it's very hard to get some facts straight 

355.99 362.09 B: yeah i i don't i don't think our government is necessarily you know been the the kindest to those countries ah 

362.35 365.40 A: well what do you really think it's about our support of israel 

365.53 366.69 B: (( i mean )) 

365.92 375.40 A: like like if israel disappeared let let's say tomorrow the president says i well to hell with israel we're not giving them any we're not doin' anything for 'em do you really think the arabs would stop stop liking us or stop hating us 

374.95 376.86 B: no i guess not 

376.29 381.79 A: i don't know they consider us decadent and even if we we're we're not forcing our decadence on them 

381.41 382.43 B: yeah 

382.69 386.39 A: i just can't understand it and i know people um 

387.09 389.97 A: you know i know i know people from some of them countries 

390.11 394.23 A: and i ask them what they're pissed off about and their answers don't make sense to me 

394.10 396.03 B: what do they what kind of things do they say 

396.78 407.79 A: that we're well they're um [cough] they're they pretty much complain about stuff we done but a lot of the stuff we done is reactions to stuff that already happened like they're very angry about us fighting the war in iraq 

408.01 412.42 A: which i could you know which i can almost understand but they hated us before that happened 

411.92 413.35 B: yeah that's true 

413.40 414.69 A: and um 

414.97 420.04 A: i'm wondering about that part of the world they their attitude towards telling the truth is different than ours 

419.56 420.93 B: [laughter] 

420.59 423.69 A: we don't always tell the truth but we think we're supposed to 

423.27 424.58 B: yeah 

423.98 426.02 A: they don't even think they're supposed to 

425.54 426.71 B: you think so 

426.60 435.33 A: yeah did i tell you one one one in particular this is going to sound horribly prejudiced but ah people from pakistan lie like crazy they they it's just so much a part of their culture 

430.45 431.61 B: no go for it 

435.34 437.61 A: they just don't believe in telling the truth 

437.05 438.67 B: yeah 

438.05 449.54 A: we're not actually fighting with them as much as with these other countries but i mean i i don't think i've ever met a pakistani in my life who didn't lie like crazy and not i'm not just talking about lying when he stood to gain something from it 

450.30 454.21 A: when it doesn't make a damn bit of difference they just seem to just rather lie than tell the truth 

455.10 462.80 A: and i'm not speaking out of the you know this isn't prejudice this is post [laughter] you know this is based on experience not based on conjecture 

464.24 468.51 A: i don't know how many people like that you know out of northern are you near washington d._c. there 

468.20 470.03 B: i'm about two hours south 

469.72 471.17 A: oh you're 

470.33 471.16 B: yeah 

471.38 472.63 B: in richmond 

471.69 473.29 A: you're in the country 

472.94 474.89 B: yeah well not quite

479.11 481.43 A: oh that's oh the capital of the confederacy 

480.82 482.54 B: yeah that's the one 

483.27 484.42 B: yeah 

484.06 488.73 A: i get a feeling if we get hurt though it's going to be a completely something coming out of left field 

488.57 490.95 B: like a country we hadn't predicted 

490.10 493.70 A: yeah something we with something we you know like 

493.85 498.75 A: [mn] you saw like like how ah like argentina and great britain like 

499.28 503.37 A: like they got into a war two weeks before the war they weren't even angry with each other 

503.33 504.52 B: yeah 

503.77 506.41 A: it it might be something like that like ah 

506.79 509.61 A: you you know it's something that we would never think of 

509.88 512.16 A: like a completely like these ah the 

512.64 516.41 A: yugoslavia you you know like what what's happening in serbia or croatia 

516.08 518.18 B: yeah i can see that 

516.87 522.82 A: like sort of like a terrorist group from there will do something they'll they'll get some crazy bug up there had we cause trouble for them 

522.48 523.93 B: yeah 

523.32 527.57 A: you know it's like ah you know your enemy sometimes can't hurt you that much because you're careful around them 

527.17 534.77 B: yeah well i never really thought coming from afghanistan so i guess that's true i never really saw it coming from afghanistan 

527.96 529.14 A: and it won't be your 

531.35 532.48 A: mhm 

534.95 539.47 B: and you know look what happened coming from there that was kind of a surprise for me 

538.98 549.33 A: well we kind of like the people from afghanistan 'cause they were fighting with russia but you you know they're they're they're supposed to be ah i remember when when they were fighting russia i read that um 

542.41 543.93 B: yeah 

549.43 553.51 A: like the afghanistan people were like the most warlike and belligerent people on earth 

553.06 554.63 B: mhm 

553.84 556.73 A: i don't have much business with them i don't know them you know 

556.16 557.47 B: yeah 

556.91 561.01 A: but ah it's very much a part of their culture to fight and to never give up 

560.61 561.92 B: yeah 

561.27 564.51 A: the vietnamese are like that too that's why we never should have messed with them 

564.00 565.57 B: yeah agreed 

564.88 571.01 A: you know they believe they get into a war maybe your grandchildren's and you know your grandchildren might end up having to win it for you 

570.59 572.35 B: yeah 

571.36 577.35 A: but that's um the i throughout their history they were one country like the british could never colonize them 

577.52 578.77 B: huh 

578.23 582.40 A: they've two things going for them geographically it's very hard to get into the place 

582.83 586.01 A: and their culture is they just won't submit they'll just keep fighting 

586.43 588.58 A: so they're very bad to have as enemies 

586.91 599.95 B: yeah do they cut us off eventually 

595.37 596.43 A: hello 

599.26 599.89 A: (( no i'm e- ))
