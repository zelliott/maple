13.21 15.06 B: (( all right )) 

13.98 19.02 A: uh [laughter] uh so we can talk about the uh airports we got here i guess 

18.24 20.27 B: right 

19.20 22.69 A: (( just a sec let me just yeah um )) 

22.72 25.55 A: so yeah do you do you fly anymore 

24.77 25.95 B: (( [noise] i do )) 

25.91 27.70 A: (( does it bother you more do )) 

28.03 29.76 B: does it bother me more now 

29.18 33.95 A: you worry more about flying now than you did before you feel as comfortable as you did before 

30.97 31.87 B: no 

33.18 36.81 B: i feel yeah i feel actually probably more comfortable 

36.01 42.28 A: you do feel more comfortable yeah see it's helpful for me to ask you because i i don't fly i haven't fl- flown since then so 

36.95 38.12 B: yeah 

42.20 43.14 B: okay 

42.68 47.74 A: i didn't quite know i i only know what i hear about about this on the on the radio 

47.55 48.55 B: right 

48.29 49.63 A: so um 

50.09 55.67 B: no i mean i think i i you know it's a obviously it's a little more inconvenience 

55.68 68.03 B: to ti- you have to be there earlier and you know they go through your shoes and everything but in the end uh i'm happy they do it rather than some guy with a shoe bomb or whatever comes in you know it's it's a tradeoff um 

67.92 70.49 A: [lipsmack] uh-huh so you feel that it works 

71.41 74.92 A: the security 'cause the question is does this work right 

74.69 79.12 B: [noise] i think for the general people it works for most people i would say 

79.42 88.19 B: but the the fact of the matter is if a terrorist wants to i think the problem is if someone who's very radical thinking and will stop at nothing 

88.59 100.71 B: will find a way you know there's always going to be some loophole all they need you know is some side door some bribe this guy whatever steal a uh a uniform i mean 

101.09 114.36 B: you're talking about you know obviously for like twelve people ti- hijacking twelve planes is one thing but one person hijack one plane i don't know if there's ever a hundred percent foolproof like you can do everything you can 

114.27 124.76 B: and you may even get eighty or ninety percent of the way there but there's never going to be a way where you can foolproof there's always going to be you know something that someone if they really wanted to they could 

124.09 126.23 A: so do you think it's enough what they're doing now 

126.74 135.17 B: i think i mean i don't know if they put the the uh onboard marshalls on i i really like that idea i think the um 

131.35 132.27 A: uh-huh 

135.24 142.29 B: idea of putting the uh steel um double whatever you call it um the cockpit door 

140.40 141.55 A: the cockpit 

141.62 142.93 A: did they do that 

142.68 154.05 B: i'm not sure exactly what they've done i've heard that they're going to do this do that i think that's a great idea um they wanted to give one of the pilots the gun i don't know if that's 

144.81 145.99 A: probably they have 

154.24 168.06 B: i mean if it's at that point i re- when they have to reach for the gun in a cock you know out of a locked box or something i don't know what that's going to do but i definitely think about having the you know the pilot door um 

168.54 170.70 B: reinforced but the thing is 

170.83 174.86 B: what happens if like uh the terrorists is in the the um 

174.96 179.26 B: main cabin and he has a gun to someone's head and it says open the door what do you do 

179.41 180.46 B: do you let the 

179.52 189.59 A: well what happens if you're on that one plane with that one terrorist i mean you said that you feel you feel more comfortable i mean there's always that outlandish possiblity 

183.99 187.40 B: well no i'm just saying i 

189.16 196.26 B: no i'm just saying let's say you do double enforce the door the locked door to the the pilot so they can't kick it down but still 

190.52 191.49 A: (( i mean mhm )) 

196.56 203.53 B: what if like the terrorist you know gets on the plane with a gun and he holds it to someone's head and he says to the pilot open the door or i'll kill this person 

203.25 209.09 A: well i wouldn't open the door if i were the pilot because he'll he'll kill a lot more people if they open the door [laughter] 

203.89 205.11 B: [laughter] 

205.28 207.14 B: you know but 

208.51 219.33 B: right but you know the pilot doesn't want anyone to die you know his human emotion might take over and they might i'm just saying you know you you can't there's no foolproof plan some things you know in that situation 

210.24 211.29 A: or try 

211.54 213.20 A: (( it's difficult yeah )) 

219.56 223.17 B: something you know either one thing or the the other's going to happen 

222.75 225.09 A: (( yeah there should be marshalls i agree with you there should be )) 

224.44 226.72 B: i think there should yeah i definitely think there should be 

225.40 226.93 A: some sort of marshall 

226.73 227.83 B: (( yeah some )) 

227.04 232.28 A: it almost feels like there should be some sort of knock out gas to knock everyone out in the in the plane or something 

232.20 233.26 B: (( oh )) 

232.36 234.79 A: that doesn't sound like such a difficult [laughter] thing to do 

234.59 236.09 B: i never thought of that 

235.06 238.01 A: knock out all the passengers put them to sleep 

237.01 238.27 B: right 

238.05 252.57 A: it almost i mean that's kind of radical but it just sometimes it feels that like that what might not be such a crazy idea but uh uh i think part of the question was do we want i think well here they asked about technology right so i wonder uh uh would you want your money spent on uh 

239.90 241.70 B: yeah 

242.04 243.07 B: [laughter] 

252.45 258.78 A: if you had an option would you want it spent on this on greater uh airport security or on defence 

258.97 260.16 A: (( more on defence you )) 

259.16 261.16 B: [noise] on on what what was the last one 

260.25 269.88 A: had your choice of defence or airport spending defence airport defence or actual other kinds of defence where where would you rather have your money spent 

269.20 271.56 B: [noise] other kind of defence like what 

270.82 274.18 A: i don't know like just defence spending general defence spending 

272.81 276.44 B: i think both you know i don't think you can pick one or the other 

275.88 279.77 A: so there should be no limit to the amount that we spend on airport security you think 

280.20 292.98 B: [noise] i mean ideally uh [laughter] you know i don't know if you can what if you can uh give a number because you know [noise] what's is is to is eight million enough and is nine million is you know too much 

292.84 295.81 B: who who's to say you know i don't know real 

294.64 297.95 A: so you don't so you think it's well spent whatever you can spend 

297.13 308.85 B: i yeah i think it is because you know whatever it it's listen whatever it is it's some costs you're not getting that money back it it's not an investment it's an investment in security you know you're hoping to deter 

308.76 312.82 B: people from doing these things and that's what it is if if you know 

312.46 314.30 A: (( uh-huh so the more money they spend mhm )) 

312.81 316.42 B: if you spend eight million dollars to def- to and it deters 

316.36 330.16 B: twenty people from you know doing the thing you know that's that's it's not it's not a mon- you know it's not it's a money that just is is spent and that's it it's gone it's not you know there's not way to 

330.58 332.95 B: [sigh] put a price on that you know 

333.55 334.46 B: it's 

334.56 338.86 B: [mn] it's it's not an investment it's something that you're doing to 

338.88 341.40 B: prevent something else that [mn] 

340.14 344.02 A: mhm would you feel better if you knew that they were spending more money than they are 

345.81 350.38 B: [noise] i would definitely feel better if they were spending more money i don't know the number of what no 

349.79 353.17 A: what they're at well you're not an expert but it the more the better you feel 

352.59 357.40 B: (( yeah i feel more as long as it's well spent if it's like stu- like i'd want to know how )) 

353.28 354.09 A: okay 

354.15 355.77 A: i think that was the question 

357.48 364.90 B: um if it's stupidly spent that's another thing but as long as it's being smartly spent you know they're not wasting tax dollars 

360.13 360.94 A: yeah 

364.57 377.26 A: yeah no i guess i agree i feel like that's very important because it's a hazard not only to the flyer to the people on on the plane and that's the difference is i mean you could say well maybe we ought to not fly but we're going to be flying anyway 

365.84 366.55 B: (( so )) 

377.18 378.61 B: (( [noise] definitely going to be flying )) 

377.36 380.78 A: so it it's a hazard to the people on the ground is the biggest problem 

380.79 383.95 B: [noise] i think they really need to spend the money on 

380.80 382.73 A: but it should be just considered 

384.03 385.33 B: you know 

385.40 396.75 B: going after finding these people before they even get get near an air co- airport you know i see that freely but uh i'm really curious on how you know 

397.05 401.98 B: a country such as ours that's supposed to be you know so uh 

402.70 406.22 B: you know i want to say in in everyone's business but we've got you know 

406.45 410.71 B: people [noise] and information all over the world how we could miss such 

410.94 425.30 B: [cough] something that seemed to be such well known in the in the i don't know i don't know about the whole arab world but definitely amongst you know a lot of muslim arabic people that were centered all over the world they seemed to have this information pretty you know [mn] 

426.63 441.51 B: knowledge they had they knew what was going on and all this stuff and you know that that we missed that how we missed that it just befuddles me how we you know uh i i gotta think somewhere that they knew about it and in some way didn't act 

440.84 442.02 A: who are they 

442.08 445.47 B: i want to say who are they the american government 

445.19 451.05 A: what is it just one thing the american government is it one part of it i mean they cla- 

449.67 455.89 B: [noise] uh when i say american government because i don't know f._b._i. c._i._a. you know what i can't tell you the exact 

453.93 456.45 A: yeah so who do you blame mhm 

455.88 468.37 B: who i can't blame a specific department i mean i wouldn't know i'm just saying the government the you know people representing am- american government somewhere i think that they came across some information and didn't 

468.65 471.40 B: take it serious enough that's my feelings 

471.36 482.05 B: and that that's because i can't imagine well as i said with all the money and information that we have out there that this this whole thing that just passed us by yet in the arabic arab world 

482.00 488.56 B: they knew that this was going on i mean they even they they i just read the other day nine eleven i'm talking about 

485.33 487.03 A: they knew what was going on 

487.86 490.00 A: they knew that nine eleven was going to happen 

489.64 504.14 B: i didn't i didn't say that i just said knew that you know that that things were going i don't know exactly the extent but i can't imagine that they had no id- they were just completely blindsided and they had no idea of anything was going or being planned or talked about or they had to have known 

490.32 491.19 A: (( the arabs )) 

502.52 503.87 A: in the arab world 

504.07 505.06 B: huh 

504.47 507.45 A: in the arabic world which arabic world 

505.61 509.01 B: right in the arabic world it's very well known but you know 

508.23 513.40 A: which arabic world the half a billion billion people whatever which part of the arabic world 

509.67 510.69 B: which arab 

513.62 515.78 A: i mean you have to be more specific than that 

514.88 525.55 B: okay um it was known amongst ju- not just people al qaeda okay it was known more out more than people just al qaeda like 

525.69 531.84 B: the regular citizens knew of something that was you know they knew that something was going to happen on 

531.81 542.79 B: uh in the inf- infidel they call it america and they knew that it was going to be a big event you know they didn't know exactly but they knew something was going to go on they all knew 

542.73 547.56 B: you know something was happening there was talk there was a buzz so to speak you know 

547.19 549.63 A: so you feel we weren't paying attention to the buzz 

548.75 560.05 B: yes i feel we weren't paying attention and it's amazing that i feel that we really didn't up to that point that clinton really didn't deal with uh osama bin laden i mean they 

560.02 570.09 B: there was uh something uh years back they tried to launch a missile at a factory in sudan or something from like you know a a ca- aircraft carrier that was their idea of trying to get rid of him 

569.63 574.76 A: did you think the count- the gov- the the country was would have been behind clinton if he'd invaded afghanistan 

575.58 577.77 B: um based on 

577.95 582.92 B: no nothing no i think he would have to ma- just like anything make a case 

582.48 586.52 A: but it would have been a lot more difficult than bush than the time bush had to make the case 

586.28 599.96 B: well bush had bush had a very convincing argument you know clinton uh i don't know what they knew but i mean if he would have showed had listened to the taliban and he would have explained the taliban and he would have explained al qaeda 

586.77 589.26 A: (( right it would have been pretty challenging case to make uh-huh ))
