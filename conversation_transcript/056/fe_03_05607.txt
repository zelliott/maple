135.41 136.82 A: yeah 

136.36 140.73 B: so uh but yeah i haven't been i haven't been back since um 

141.15 153.38 B: but i mean you know i think personally my life hasn't changed other than the fact that i'm more concerned about civil liberties you know and i'm more concerned about 

153.41 165.75 B: um our government and i'm more concerned about uh how our government's treating other people and you know as far as terrorism and i think that's terrible and obviously i hope it doesn't happen but um 

162.85 164.17 A: [noise] 

166.03 168.65 A: do you think they're maybe going a little too far in uh 

166.13 166.82 B: (( [noise] )) 

169.97 176.13 A: er how how do i say it uh well basically taking away our civil liberties by being you know overly 

176.81 182.37 A: uh how do i put it uh careful about trying to find out who's doing what and everything 

181.58 188.30 B: yeah i absolutely do i mean i think the patriot act is uh appalling you know i think that uh 

183.18 184.52 A: yeah i do too 

186.34 187.33 A: yes 

188.15 197.11 B: i mean they can now follow your what library books you check out you know they don't they they have the power the government has the power to um 

192.37 193.70 A: indeed 

197.10 206.17 B: search your house search your email records without uh due process or probable cause are you there yeah 

203.25 208.53 A: yes yes it it's pretty orwellian and big brotherish and creepy 

207.60 221.17 B: well you know it is and uh and i also think you know obviously the the tragedy of september eleventh was used as a as a guise to you know attack iraq so i mean i'm i'm 

210.42 211.53 A: it's frightening 

216.25 217.42 A: an excuse 

220.68 222.35 A: absolutely yeah 

221.50 224.37 B: i'm i'm not you know i would say that i'm 

224.49 230.71 B: i'm more i was obviously very concerned when bush came into the white house but uh i mean 

230.33 232.30 A: i wasn't pleased myself 

231.45 239.37 B: yeah [laughter] i mean that's what's really changed for me i've you know i've become more active and more vocal and um 

232.33 233.24 A: [laughter] 

239.69 244.51 B: you know more more critical just aware of what's going on you know what i mean 

242.05 244.02 A: right sure 

245.17 253.34 A: well in that way i guess it's it's a [noise] it's a positive thing in a in a way [noise] but i mean that that people are more concerned about those things but 

253.47 257.60 A: the reasons why the have to be is not not a positive thing [noise] [noise] what 

257.22 266.14 B: yeah and i don't know how many people are i mean i think that you know there's a there's a group of people you know that are vocal and that care but i think um 

265.29 266.46 A: was dinging 

265.97 273.11 B: all you have to do is wave the banner of september eleventh and then you can basically do whatever you want as far as the government's concerned so 

268.11 268.78 A: (( [noise] )) 

272.59 274.22 A: oh absolutely yeah uh 

273.54 278.53 B: you know so that i'm concerned about that where do you live in new york oh

397.22 409.75 A: flying into the side [laughter] of one of the biggest buildings in the country in the world for that matter and when i heard that the second one happened i said no no this is this has gotta be planned this probably is terrorism and sure enough
