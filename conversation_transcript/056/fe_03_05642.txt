0.58 2.13 B: (( hi i'm craig )) 

1.64 3.10 A: hi i'm terence 

3.66 4.70 B: (( how ya doin' )) 

4.46 6.01 A: i'm pretty good how are you 

5.95 8.11 B: (( good )) 

8.56 21.15 B: okay so it's do we think if airport security heightened airport security is going to stop terrorism basically right [mn] um let's see i have i'm not a big 

15.63 17.20 A: (( mhm )) 

21.60 25.59 B: airport traveler so um 

23.48 24.59 A: oh okay 

26.74 29.38 B: from what i've heard i guess the most intrusive 

29.55 35.65 B: things are just like the taking off the shoes and just kind of more b._p._l. x. rays 

35.22 36.61 A: right 

36.89 41.58 B: is there anything else like that i don't know about or 

41.27 48.40 A: no that's basically it um i guess the increased um scanning is good 

48.25 49.69 B: yeah 

49.52 56.60 A: but at the same time can it really stop or even reduce terrorism if it's supposed if it's going to happen anyway 

56.49 58.50 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

58.39 62.20 A: (( i really don't i'm not sure what the answer is to that )) 

63.16 68.20 B: i mean i think there's been so many breaches even with this heightened security that 

67.06 73.61 A: ri- right 'cause there there's only that much they can see without being like intruding in people's personal stuff 

73.49 78.29 B: yeah and then you're not going to you have to be there three hours before a flight and it's 

78.48 84.71 A: and you already have to do that so i mean what has really happened is they have inconvenienced the normal passenger 

78.96 79.87 B: (( not )) 

80.06 81.95 B: yeah 

85.21 87.09 A: and i'm wondering if it's 

87.10 94.04 A: uh necessary or worthwhile inconvenience to claim to airport security 

94.23 95.63 B: do you think they should 

95.70 100.19 B: profile people more or start profiling people 

98.98 102.57 A: uh no no i think they should 

102.83 103.97 A: i don't know 

104.11 107.59 A: for one the checking in three hours before is kind of unnecessary 

107.47 109.59 B: yeah 

109.98 115.68 B: i mean if there is if there is a significant difference they can make without intruding on people's privacy and 

114.96 116.84 A: right 

115.71 120.25 B: but i don't know what that answer would be i mean 

120.76 125.96 B: even like a detailed x. ray is going to be pretty intrusive with people 

124.92 126.28 A: right 

126.32 127.69 B: (( so )) 

128.29 129.34 B: and then 

129.61 137.82 B: [lipsmack] i don't know because if you have like a plastic explosive that's not necessarily going to show up on any kind of x. ray they do so 

136.63 142.91 A: right that's what i mean it's almost as if they've heightened the security but it at the same time it's not going to have much 

143.00 145.05 A: different results or effect 

145.14 149.31 B: yeah i think it's kind of more of a p._r. move just to say it's heightened 

148.28 161.64 A: that that's what i think it is it's to say to promote that okay it it looks more secure so you can feel more comfortable to fly now but i don't think in actual security it has uh made any serious or significant changes 

149.91 150.92 B: yeah 

161.54 163.39 B: yeah and 

162.16 168.94 A: i guess after that one guy had the bomb in his shoe and he got caught i don't think anybody else is going to try it so 

165.49 166.33 B: mhm 

168.99 171.20 A: (( i mean make everybody take their shoes off )) 

169.33 171.90 B: yeah it it's all reactive 

171.79 175.57 A: exactly i mean make everybody take their shoes off now is kind of silly [laughter] 

171.93 173.04 B: (( it it )) 

175.49 180.56 B: right because then they're just going to figure out a new way to slip by and 

178.93 182.33 A: exactly they're not going to try a way they know they're going to fail 

182.19 184.08 B: mhm 

184.53 192.09 B: yeah i don't i don't know if i could come up with a solution that would work any better or any worse than really is going on now so 

190.98 192.76 A: right 

193.94 199.86 B: i would just say you know pay the screeners more and kinda make 'em more attentive and like 

198.31 201.85 A: that's what i was thinking send them through a more intensive training 

201.50 203.29 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

202.04 205.71 A: and increase the sensitivity of of the screening 

205.73 210.28 A: and that should be fine it shouldn't take any more time to do than it previously used to 

207.50 208.21 B: (( [noise] )) 

209.05 210.20 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

210.48 212.31 B: mhm 

211.27 215.26 A: and it won't make it such an uncomfortable thing to fly anymore 

215.27 221.46 B: yeah 'cause i think yeah that that's the only way i could see improving is like improving like the human intelligence 

215.54 217.45 A: 'cause a lot 

221.23 223.24 A: mhm 

222.41 226.42 B: because otherwise it's just going to be these measures that really 

226.50 229.19 B: are as effective as they're going to be [noise] you know 

228.80 230.77 A: yeah 

229.77 230.72 B: so 

231.77 233.55 B: yeah i don't know what else i would do 

233.65 236.72 B: more training better employees 

236.77 244.21 B: i don't know if i'd have what do you think about having the government like take these employees and make them federal employees 

244.41 249.57 B: and [noise] handle it that way instead of like taking it out of the airport's hands [noise] 

249.90 250.53 A: (( mm )) 

250.59 254.72 A: i don't know if that will be effective at the same time 

253.46 254.60 B: [noise] 

254.87 259.40 B: (( yeah i don't know i don't know if that would work either but aren't they they're thinking about )) 

257.47 266.17 A: probably having the probably having the marshalls the u._s. marshalls on board the plane that can make a significant difference i can see that being a big difference 

266.21 273.00 B: [noise] yeah and securing the cockpit and doing things like that [noise] i think those are going to be the major [noise] [noise] that it won't be 

271.66 274.31 A: because even if they become federal employees 

274.48 276.20 A: there's still no saying you 

275.36 276.30 B: (( corrupt or whatever or )) 

276.46 278.13 A: (( know )) 

278.15 278.98 B: mhm 

279.17 282.91 A: and things can still pass through so there's no saying that either 

279.32 280.27 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

283.64 289.47 A: but i mean if you're a u._s. marshall and stuff and there are two of them onboard each flight well that's different 

290.89 299.58 B: [noise] yeah one thing i don't know [noise] a lot about is like what about the the workers at the airports how you know is there a big screening process there 'cause i think 

298.55 305.92 A: um they they go through basically the exact same screening any passenger would because most of their offices are behind the 

305.87 313.77 A: metal detectors and and all the security so they have to pass through it each time as any other employee would have to or any other passenger would have to 

311.45 312.92 B: (( [noise] okay all )) 

314.23 315.86 B: (( right )) 

315.98 318.33 B: yeah i don't know what else i would have them do [noise] 

321.36 323.26 B: that would be about it 

324.33 326.06 B: do you fly a lot 

325.97 332.70 A: um i i fly i fly a decent amount but um i'm going to college right now and i'm majoring in aviation 

332.52 333.66 B: oh really 

333.33 334.69 A: yeah 

334.48 336.89 B: like engineering part of it or 

336.17 337.94 A: no airport management 

337.90 339.50 B: really huh 

340.43 343.47 B: so have you seen have they been teaching you like 

344.32 347.11 B: different security procedures or anything or 

346.48 354.74 A: well no because well that's why i have the belief that what they're doing now is really nothing i think it's more hype than something that's actually working 

354.67 355.67 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

355.14 360.15 A: because all it's doing is deterring people from flying because they have to go through so much stress to get to the plane 

360.08 361.80 B: right 

361.06 367.37 A: and the the industry itself is suffering because of it and at the same time i don't think that security has 

364.43 365.53 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

367.64 369.57 A: been improved really 

370.73 375.12 B: have they addressed anything about um protecting the areas 

375.22 382.57 B: like near the airports like with people that could have like rock rocket launched missiles or anything like that 

381.37 390.30 A: well it depends which which airports you're referring to so like j._f._k. and stuff they do i don't think like other smaller airports might 

391.54 393.02 B: (( do you think they're going to stay )) 

391.66 403.30 A: and other really big ones like chicago o'hare j._f._k. probably atlanta international they would definitely have those but i don't even know if newark has it 

397.67 398.60 B: mhm 

402.37 403.30 B: really 

404.55 409.61 B: yeah i guess logistically with some of those like i'm i live in manhattan so i mean 

409.92 417.08 B: logistically maybe newark's a little bit strange 'cause you have you have the turnpike right there it's kind of hard to 

413.28 414.77 A: yeah 

417.12 419.97 B: really i guess put any security measures there 

419.36 421.14 A: right 

421.71 422.41 B: (( hm )) 

428.76 430.70 B: so um 

431.53 433.03 B: (( let's see )) 

433.93 438.01 B: is it do they teach like the security measures now i mean 

438.36 439.89 B: do they have like a 

438.68 439.24 A: (( [mn] )) 

441.58 444.71 B: a detailed kind of thing that you go through 

444.61 450.17 A: um no not really [laughter] they're still working on on on trying a thousand different methods 

446.72 447.68 B: really 

450.96 451.85 B: huh 

453.48 454.27 B: huh 

454.14 463.56 A: it's a sensitive kind of area because either you make it very stressful for the passenger and then the airlines lose out and the industry suffers 

460.24 461.03 B: (( right )) 

463.50 470.15 A: or you have a big threat for terrorism and the industry suffers 'cause passengers are fright are afraid 

469.33 474.99 B: what's the airports' stance are they kind of wanting less restrictive measures even now 

474.94 484.26 A: the airport itself may not may not care because they don't pay for it and they're not affected by it the airlines they don't really like it because 

480.54 481.50 B: mhm 

484.40 492.30 A: when you have to stand up three hours in a line just to get to board your plane people say it's almost worth the wa- the wait to drive 

492.68 496.69 B: have they been lobbying for less restrictive measures i know that would be kind of hard 

495.46 500.61 A: not really they're not really i don't think they would be able to because the government has given them so much money 

500.75 501.92 B: yeah 

501.31 506.20 A: they've been getting so much aid recently that i don't think it's a wise move for them to even 

506.34 508.84 A: oppose anything that's happening right now 

508.66 512.44 B: how long are they going to continue the aid or is it just kind of up in the air 

512.48 515.49 A: i don't know it depends on how well the airlines are doing [laughter] 

515.48 517.18 B: (( yeah hm )) 

519.79 521.71 B: interesting little subject 

524.10 525.27 B: (( so i don't know )) 

524.10 526.30 A: how many calls have you done before 

526.19 527.44 B: what's that 

526.89 529.12 A: how many calls have you done before 

528.78 530.18 B: um two 

530.19 531.03 A: (( oh okay )) 

530.41 533.74 B: (( did one on censorship and one on )) 

535.00 536.87 B: (( what was the last one i did )) 

540.51 547.60 B: oh um no i can't remember [laughter] i don't know censorship oh uh about books in public schools and private schools 

547.00 548.11 A: oh okay 

548.55 550.97 B: have you done calls before 

549.73 551.54 A: yeah i did three before 

551.58 552.22 B: (( ooh )) 

554.43 556.41 B: [noise] do you call in or they call you 

556.31 557.78 A: they call me 

557.44 558.70 B: yeah okay 

559.16 561.22 B: i tried to call in once but 

562.01 565.36 B: i don't know i don't know how much time we have left to talk about this stuff 

564.74 566.39 A: like a minute [laughter] 

565.79 567.51 B: [laughter] 

568.28 576.56 B: it's an interesting subject but i don't know i i guess my final thing i guess they could probably even lessen it and it would probably be just as safe you know 

570.44 571.89 A: (( yeah i guess so )) 

576.72 577.79 A: yeah i guess 

578.48 579.29 B: (( you know )) 

579.27 581.12 A: (( i guess with more um )) 

581.65 584.53 A: police or military presence 

584.69 587.10 A: it may deter people who might want to 

584.83 585.81 B: yeah 

586.98 588.73 B: (( [noise] )) 

587.14 592.94 A: but the actual screening process and stuff what they're doing right now i i see it being 

592.95 594.67 A: no different from before 

595.46 599.89 B: yeah i guess if you can like get to the the screener you know that that's a prob- 

598.66 599.66 A: right
