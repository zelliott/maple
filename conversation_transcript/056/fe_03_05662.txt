43.47 51.37 A: checking people through the security ran to the back everybody just quiet as a stone glued don't know what's going on but it turned out it was just a test they were 

51.83 53.50 A: testing their their 

52.07 53.52 B: (( that's scary that's scary )) 

53.90 62.99 B: it's scary nonetheless 'cause you know anyone says anything everyone reacts i'm sure you know three years ago if someone said anything one person would react and ah

78.80 81.27 A: yeah i just saw that in the news this afternoon 

80.89 84.43 B: yeah so i don't have to check the shoes but i 

84.85 86.91 B: guess you you got to do what you got to do 

87.34 88.31 B: so 

89.50 90.58 B: (( what do you feel )) 

90.59 100.49 A: there's two things seems to so arbitrary 'cause it's just i mean i understand what what happened with the sneaking a bomb in the shoe but 

99.89 102.24 B: right i mean you know i don't know ho- 

100.51 103.41 A: it could be anything 

102.65 116.91 B: it was one person that tried that i don't know if anyone else you know whether it's a realistic whether they should be wasting time that if they could take the same time and um you know check other things whether it be 

116.80 121.07 B: bags or you know take their time to get people through the lines quicker 

121.13 125.92 B: that's the one thing it takes a it takes a while now at times if you get a lot of people there you 

126.11 127.88 B: you could be in line for hours 

126.57 129.45 A: (( absolutely )) 

128.84 135.43 B: they're trying to check your bag at the curb and you know it's just a a lot more of a hassle but i guess you do feel safer 

135.87 138.82 A: yeah you feel safer when i when i fly now 

139.11 139.79 A: they 

140.14 143.45 A: they certainly check everything i went i went through at a 

143.93 146.47 A: didn't think about it with a pair of scissors in my 

146.69 149.41 A: carry on bag 'cause i was moving up here so 

150.47 151.40 B: oh 

151.23 155.58 A: you know so i you know i lost the scissors and a pair of toenail clippers you 

155.76 158.55 B: i was going to say there's no they don't want that on 

158.42 162.21 A: know no well well i completely understand but 

160.90 167.94 B: oh yeah no i couldn't believe when you know when all this happened that you were allowed to bring you know a knife that has a three inch blade anyway 

167.69 169.15 A: oh i know yeah 

168.72 170.28 B: i was like wait a minute how did 

170.32 175.82 B: you know not that i would but i was like i never realized that was part of the deal that you could do that i was like 

176.65 178.65 B: that's that's incredible 

178.42 183.91 A: it seems like it it wouldn't take as much as a terrorist attack for them to say you can't bring 

182.52 183.55 B: right it 

184.04 185.98 B: seems so simple now 

185.90 187.73 A: right 

186.73 189.75 B: why didn't it happen before is really more the question 

191.55 194.30 B: that you know it wasn't that difficult to ah 

194.66 197.30 B: ah to do it so 

197.68 200.20 B: but you know who knows i 

201.04 207.87 B: just hope that you know they do a thorough job but again with you know between racial profile you know like complaints and all you know they're 

208.44 212.18 B: checking you know old ladies when they're really not going to be the problem 

212.07 213.02 A: yeah 

212.42 215.58 B: or they're probably not going to be the problem 

215.82 217.95 B: you got to play your percentages here 

218.15 221.41 B: you know who is the most likely to younger you know 

221.52 224.67 B: younger males and if they borrow from you know 

225.16 227.14 B: arab related countries hey 

227.22 229.58 B: that's the way it is that's the way it is 

227.26 229.32 A: (( yeah ex- )) 

229.54 239.34 A: i agree with you completely we're just so so politically correct about everything we can't we can't look at the the obvious right 

233.88 235.63 B: exactly you know 

238.32 241.52 B: right you can't look at the obvious that's not allowed any more 

241.20 247.55 A: [laughter] 

242.23 251.86 B: it's not i mean you can't say oh these are the this is what happens let's you know try and prevent it well we are to make nice nice and check you know little old ladies to say 

252.49 253.41 B: (( you know )) 

254.13 260.23 B: okay we checked them so we're doing every third person versus the people that you know maybe we should be checking 

260.57 264.04 A: (( right )) 

260.78 261.72 B: so 

262.03 264.70 B: and that's you know that's kind of a scary thing too 

265.31 267.39 B: that they're saying okay if you know 

267.67 273.63 B: as opposed to checking i'm just picking arabs 'cause it happened to be two arabs or two you know 

274.31 276.74 B: they'll check an old lady as opposed to that 

276.72 279.33 A: and if not you can't check the arabs 

278.90 280.67 B: that doesn't do me any good 

280.42 282.93 A: no [laughter] i'm not i'm 

281.95 284.19 B: i'm not worried about the little old lady 

283.97 286.59 A: not scared of her at all 'cause she's 

285.73 286.63 B: no 

287.77 291.47 B: but you know it's the way it's the way it's turned out and ah 

293.19 297.14 B: but hey what are you you know what are you going to do we don't make the rules that's the thing 

297.11 297.92 A: no 

297.54 301.57 B: i just hope when they're you know screening things you hear so many horror stories about 

301.98 308.12 B: ah you know this getting through in the machine because this guy is untrained and this you know and that 

308.13 310.68 B: because these guys are not paid well so 

311.12 320.16 A: yeah how do you expect somebody who's getting paid i'm sure they're getting paid more than the minimum wage but he's not getting paid well to take such an interest in 

318.62 319.52 B: yeah 

320.27 322.34 B: (( right too because of the impact on )) 

321.45 322.90 A: (( autonomous )) 

322.64 325.32 B: right think about the impact they'll make on ah 

325.71 330.75 B: on what you know we're doing we're trying to you know paying these guys ad- to 

331.06 332.85 B: protect the airways 

332.97 334.38 B: and that's difficult 

334.97 336.87 B: that's difficult so 

338.06 343.90 A: you know it's hard to it's hard to understand particularly when you're paying what what plane tickets go for these days 

343.32 344.19 B: right 

344.33 350.40 B: you're right you're paying that much money you know you feel you'll be safe and they're they're paying these guys ah 

350.62 352.93 B: like you're saying not minimum wage but 

353.30 355.66 B: i can't right it's it's 

355.76 365.06 B: not what you call a lot a lot of money and they have they have a they have a lot in their hands they have a lot of responsibility and a lot of ah um 

358.30 359.25 A: no 

363.33 376.22 A: (( yeah )) 

365.45 370.02 B: what's the word i'm looking for you know responsibility you know it's in their hands 

370.46 371.43 B: so 

371.78 374.34 B: and you know you can't just 

375.08 376.71 B: can't just ah 

377.10 380.41 B: what do you say pay these guys a minimum wage or whatever it is 

380.82 383.42 B: you know and and expect to get such a 

383.66 388.38 B: ah topnotch ah job performance you know you get what you pay for 

388.93 390.00 B: so 

389.81 395.56 A: (( right )) 

393.37 396.64 B: i guess we'll see you know nothing has happened since but 

396.86 399.32 A: yeah i think not but 

398.48 399.59 B: (( yeah )) 

399.62 400.76 A: (( well you know )) 

399.76 400.72 B: exactly 

401.05 411.22 A: that's the other side of the coin nothing has happened since so i mean obviou- you know well apparently it's what is going on with airport security is it's working 

404.05 404.85 B: (( right )) 

410.56 415.03 B: yeah it seems to be working you know it's it's going to take you know that 

415.21 416.75 B: (( next ah )) 

417.72 423.25 B: group of people whatever it is to say okay let's try this because it's you know 

423.80 425.68 B: it's got to be a little bit more 

425.70 433.03 B: you know what i'm saying an inside job or something but somehow it's going to be ah um 

432.86 435.72 A: it's got to be a bigger plan to get if they want to to 

434.82 436.74 B: yeah exactly a bigger plan 

435.76 438.64 A: get on the airplane on the airplane 

437.49 449.74 B: and a more detailed plan it's that right you're exactly right i was going to say okay we have someone on the inside who you know a pilot or whatever it is i don't know you know what it would be but i don't want to even think about that 

449.31 450.83 A: no [laughter] 

449.95 453.03 B: but yeah i don't want to think about it so 

453.16 455.21 B: um 

455.38 460.78 B: you know we'll see but you know it seems to be working 'cause again we haven't had anything but people are going through 

461.98 465.09 B: you know we're all going through ah more 

465.19 470.39 B: stringent requirements and taking time out of our lives to you know make sure everything is ah 

470.60 474.45 B: working right so hopefully these guys have it down and and we're going to get it done 

474.72 477.24 A: (( yeah ))
