1.67 2.80 B: hello 

1.70 3.02 A: oh hi 

4.41 7.53 A: ah hi my name is unkul and i'm in new jersey 

7.80 9.88 B: (( oh how you doing i'm from jersey too )) 

9.85 11.78 A: oh good 

11.88 13.69 B: airport security huh 

13.80 19.90 A: yeah that was yesterday was airport security today is issues in the middle east maybe they have told us different topics 

21.20 27.07 B: um i don't know i just heard them say something about airport security and the rest was very muffled 

27.26 40.90 A: oh that's fine because i spoke on that i i had a conversation on that topic yesterday and today they asked me to like the thing that i had was issues in the middle east and what do you think about it it doesn't matter we can talk about airport security 

39.36 43.07 B: that's fine the middle east is fine [laughter] 

42.02 48.60 A: [laughter] okay so what do you think about the middle east and all the turmoil and unrest there 

48.49 59.01 B: ah i think it is well well it's interesting that um there has been there is some kind of dialogue now the is a bit has died down a bit [cough] because of um 

59.48 65.06 B: it seems that abbes has some kind of hold on these ah terrorist groups in israel 

66.28 78.52 A: (( mhm but i the the the core issue i think is that obviously palestine and israel and ah until that is resolved which i don't think i mean the israelis are surrounded by you know the muslims well then )) 

78.64 83.22 A: unless the israelis give some concessions to the palestinians 

83.36 84.04 A: (( with )) 

83.49 87.17 B: oh yea- that should be how you're right they have to give concessions 

88.82 99.17 B: and it's it's definitely um they they have to establish a palestinian state or there is going to be this same kind of unrest they can't be both palestinian towns and such 

100.02 103.09 A: (( yeah yeah but i think even israeli has a very )) 

103.87 106.80 A: security i mean it is surrounded by 

106.81 120.08 A: lebanon palestine egypt and i mean you've got a history of going to war with israel although they've signed a peace accord and all of that but still even after you establish peace i mean there'll always be some unrest within the palestinians you know 

113.84 114.95 B: mhm 

120.09 128.81 A: the hamas group and all this try to gain more concessions so where does the buck stop for israel i mean how much concessions do you think are valid 

128.67 139.22 A: and i see israel's point but i see the palestinian's point too and that is the reason the civil unrest is going on probably the british are to blame for it just because they left [laughter] [laughter] 

137.16 138.44 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

139.66 146.91 B: that's true yeah i think you're right we have hardliners on both sides like in hama- hamas wants 

141.00 141.81 A: (( [noise] )) 

147.14 151.57 B: the ah no jewish state in israel and they have peoples 

151.46 163.28 B: and people on the israeli side that want no arab state in i mean no palestinian state within the same territory so i suppose you are still going to have unrest they are two they are two you know cultures 

156.68 157.65 A: mhm 

158.34 159.29 A: mhm 

163.20 172.18 B: that they aren't you know diametrically opposed as people would think but they didn't you you put them in a kind of position [laughter] you know 

172.01 173.09 A: mhm 

172.26 178.50 B: a kind of compromise and they've grown to be like polar opposites now 

178.52 184.29 A: oh yes they are and ah i mean people like osama bin laden just gained their strength from 

184.76 192.13 A: these policies because i mean u._s. obviously has supported israel throughout and i don't think that it is wrong to support israel 

192.20 194.02 A: i'm i'm actually from indian 

194.09 198.12 A: and from an indian perspective you know when i see this terrorist acts 

194.40 195.18 B: mhm 

197.92 198.98 A: in israel 

198.82 204.72 A: i mean we are subject to the same kind of terrorism from pakistan and i think israel is pretty right in defending itself 

204.57 215.12 A: (( and sometimes i envy the israelis because they they are more extreme i mean they will fly their choppers over they will bomb lebanon or they will bomb palestine and i think the indian government doesn't do that and we have weakened that i think the )) 

210.36 211.39 B: mhm 

214.93 216.57 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm but [noise] )) 

215.18 218.96 A: (( israelis are very are proud people and they are rich people i think that way )) 

219.00 233.27 B: mhm but the problem is that um israel in israel there is outside mediation always there historically has been always you know like an outside mediation whereas on the kashmir issue india and pakistan they don't want outside mediation 

226.31 227.51 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

233.11 241.57 A: no because i don't think that it is um i mean it is an internal matter and pakistan is unnecessarily trying to keep the issue alive and there is no issue as su- 

241.33 249.57 A: at all i mean because from nineteen forty seven when we had independence and the first fight and actually got like twenty per cent of kashmir 

241.59 242.61 B: mhm 

246.03 246.83 B: mhm 

249.56 258.27 A: and the indian government was like okay just stop it there but i mean they went to war but that is sixty five and seventy one in ninety nine again but the thing is that 

255.61 256.48 B: yeah 

258.10 267.80 A: we've we've and we've got a line of control stick to those lines but there is still one saying terrorists or war and trying to create unrest when there is actually none if you actually leave kashmir alone 

266.54 267.21 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

267.59 276.76 A: and let the indian government handle it all like economically i think the situation can be improved but obviously the pakistanis won't allow us to do that 

275.80 285.42 B: would you support a referendum in kashmir that would allow the citizens of kashmir to vote whether they want to be part of indian or pakistan [noise] 

285.40 291.73 A: i'm sure i shou- i would allow that because ah i think even the kashmirians now they do realize that 

291.87 300.84 A: staying with india is beneficial to them i mean you hear the horror stories of all the muslims who actually went from india to pakistan in forty seven 

299.90 300.71 B: mhm 

300.99 303.73 A: and i mean there are so many of them 

303.94 308.56 A: so i think those people have to realize now and i mean there's a sense of 

308.67 321.30 A: peace not real peace but you know probably the calm before the storm but i think because of u._s. pressure pakistan has been forced to you know curb the terrorism a little and plus the indian government has 

313.62 314.77 B: mhm 

321.11 324.03 A: changed its tactics like rather than going for 

324.18 331.02 A: you know military solution they are trying all sorts of economic give the people more jobs i think that is what will really help the situation 

328.17 328.96 B: (( mhm )) 

331.28 337.09 B: yeah i i i hear what you are saying but it i don't know it seems that like 

336.89 348.21 B: because when when the ah when they do send terrorists or you know the alleged the allegation is that pakistan does send terrorists into kashmir [noise] when they do send terrorists they are 

347.97 354.36 B: mainly targeting hindu pundits that were there and they're supplanting them with 

354.57 363.44 B: people from pakistan so it it seems that if there was a referendum i don't know it seems to me that they would it would go to pakistan 

363.63 364.61 A: (( [noise] i don't )) 

364.59 379.21 A: that's the thing is that ah when you talk of kashmir and when i talk of kashmir i don't know because when i talk of kashmir i often talk of and i also talk of jummo region which which are predominantly buddhist and hindu and they have more reason to accede to the 

377.17 377.97 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

379.20 387.40 A: pakistanis but i don't know about the valley because even in the valley i i think there are quite a few muslims who still want to remain with india because 

387.45 391.13 A: i've been to pakistan because i was working on a ship and 

391.70 398.86 A: i don't really see any reason i mean pakistan has been independent for one day longer than india is but they don't seem to have made any progress anywhere 

398.96 400.27 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

399.28 403.70 A: you know in terms of they don't have any manufacturing most of the stuff is imported 

403.84 405.00 A: (( and )) 

405.03 408.53 A: obviously corruption i mean india it is not that india is less corrupt 

407.96 409.63 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

408.79 413.35 A: but the heights of corruption in pakistan is like it's very difficult to imagine how much is there 

413.29 418.98 B: i see what you're saying it's it's definitely there i think there is no doubt that it is un- under developed 

419.05 431.74 B: far more under developed than india is and that is probably the reason for bush's recent aid package i mean it was as much as cooperation as that pakistan needs it i i was reading the other day that pakistan has like a 

424.21 425.18 A: yes 

431.96 440.56 B: the opium trade goes straight to pakistan from afghanistan that there's a huge rate of heroin addiction in pakistan it's it's really bad you know 

435.54 436.62 A: right 

440.52 442.00 A: mhm 

442.43 445.14 B: but back to the middle east [laughter] 

444.46 457.10 A: [laughter] yeah i mean i just i just draw that parallel and when i think you know because fro- ah india has recently started having closer ties with israeli you know what like with indian indian 

446.27 447.07 B: [noise] 

457.22 465.43 A: security forces being trained in israel for anti terrorist operations because obviously one side is the best and diligent agency i think in the world 

461.20 462.15 B: mhm 

465.53 467.22 B: [noise] mhm 

465.54 466.64 A: (( and um israel )) 

467.55 470.98 A: in spite of being in such a region they have been able to live 

471.03 477.13 A: very nicely i mean the i envy the israelis because they have done a wonderful job of living in that region 

477.16 483.70 B: [mn] mhm that's that's true because well they definitely had all odds against them 

483.38 484.89 A: they do yes [laughter] 

484.42 495.27 B: [laughter] that's true i i i hope that something positive comes out of this whole iraq situation i don't know if that is going to happen but you know maybe [mn] 

495.32 500.19 B: maybe like by having one democratic straight state in iraq you'd have 

500.22 505.78 B: [noise] you'd you would have um you know more of a chance of having other democracies in 

505.72 507.77 A: mhm but if 

506.64 508.15 B: in the area 

508.00 514.45 A: yeah but you know i never see saudi arabia becoming a democracy ever i don't see u._a._e. becoming a democracy 

514.34 515.86 B: yeah that's true 

514.64 517.04 A: because those countries i mean um 

517.40 523.31 A: i'm not saying that they are bad but their history is such that ah they've always you know hired those 

523.92 525.97 A: shahs and czar or 

526.66 530.72 A: ruling over them and they they have a very tribal kind of 

532.50 536.15 A: (( political system you know they have tribe- tribal head dominance )) 

533.67 534.66 B: mhm 

535.93 536.90 B: yeah 

536.25 539.79 A: (( we will we were probably getting the same when the british left india the )) 

540.78 541.89 A: (( congress party )) 

545.22 550.81 A: i find that very difficult to do because probably those i don't feel the king of saudi arabia will be leaving his thrown 

551.22 556.63 B: mhm yes that's true and you have such he surrounds himself with 

551.95 552.92 A: so 

556.84 562.49 B: nobles who have a lot of money so yeah you're right it would be very hard to topple 

562.28 563.39 A: [laughter] 

562.54 563.92 B: that [noise] 

564.44 569.47 A: plus the plus the they are not given that much of freedom i mean politically 

564.54 565.29 B: bu- 

569.61 572.49 A: so if fifty per cent of the population is left out of the 

573.21 576.80 A: i don't know how you can achieve democracy 

576.61 578.45 B: mhm 

578.63 584.14 B: so the big question i i i guess should ask you this do you think there is a legitimate reason to ah 

584.35 587.26 B: to attack iraq or not 

586.37 587.14 A: no i 

587.77 592.65 A: of late i mean previously i did think i want to support the war in the sense that 

592.84 599.89 A: you know i thought that he had weapons of mass destruction which he could use but i still wasn't convinced of the fact that he could use them against the u._s.
