0.21 2.10 A: (( hi there my name is greg )) 

3.51 4.49 A: hello 

4.48 6.60 B: hi i'm nate how are you 

6.30 7.73 A: (( okay how're ya doin' all )) 

7.79 9.48 B: i'm doing well 

9.18 11.02 A: (( right )) 

10.64 13.69 B: so ah what what countries do you think are a threat 

13.78 17.35 A: oh i have no doubt that we've got to watch out for iran 

18.83 20.26 B: (( yeah do you )) 

18.91 21.28 A: (( i remem- yeah )) 

21.39 22.08 A: (( sure )) 

22.81 24.90 B: do you think that iraq was a 

25.17 27.93 B: a big threat or a sufficient threat to go to war 

28.01 30.25 A: no i don't think so they're 

30.54 32.29 A: a they're a small nobody 

32.72 37.14 B: yeah i i pretty much agree with you there um personally i think 

33.54 34.41 A: (( basically )) 

37.22 38.70 B: (( possibly north korea )) 

39.12 45.02 A: and that's gonna be a problem too if they don't settle this thing similarly korea will be i 

42.91 44.32 B: yeah exactly 

45.82 48.39 A: guess they'll get their nerve up enough to attack us 

49.64 51.60 B: right um 

51.97 57.16 B: yeah as as far as north korea goes that that's a that's such a sticky situation though 

57.02 58.15 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

57.39 62.66 B: i heard ah i heard yesterday on n._p._r. that they were planning on ah 

62.91 64.30 B: reopening 

64.66 74.53 B: and ah restarting construction on more nuclear reactors and that sources close to the north koreans have said that they've started ah 

74.85 78.17 B: doing a lot of the refining of the spent fuel rods 

78.15 79.81 A: right 

79.32 82.98 B: right and that that can make up to like four or five war heads 

82.91 85.96 A: mhm that's very dangerous for us 

83.46 85.70 B: (( and ah sounds pretty scary )) 

86.39 89.76 A: 'cause i i have no doubt that they would use it against us 

86.51 87.69 B: i'm sorry what was that 

89.95 97.60 B: right right so i think they're probably the biggest threat and iran i'm i'm not quite as convinced about um 

96.80 110.59 A: well i i look at them as more of a terrorist though you know they they seem to be sitting in the background doing nothing but i'm quite sure there's a lot they're doing they've probably got a lot to do with it with the al qaeda and a whole lot of other things 

109.99 111.46 B: (( right right )) 

111.58 117.00 B: yeah i can i can i can see that i i don't think they're i mean certainly they're not friendly but i 

115.65 119.34 A: yeah they're not they're not really so much of an outward threat they're 

119.82 123.55 A: i guess they're behind scenes i know i was in the military so i know i 

123.58 125.01 A: we trained them 

125.51 127.16 B: right 

126.10 128.55 A: so they they kinda move like we do they'll 

129.26 130.65 B: right 

129.95 132.71 A: you know they're kinda laid back 

131.59 133.40 B: yeah 

133.62 134.64 B: um 

133.86 141.97 A: all the while they're planning they've probably got a few agents here in the country without a doubt doin' some things yeah 

139.19 140.84 B: (( really do you think )) 

141.03 141.88 B: wow 

142.07 143.15 B: um 

143.24 152.98 B: yeah i think i think ah probably their their determination has been increased by by the united states attacking iraq probably in my opinion 

153.05 157.30 A: oh yeah now you've got some of the other smaller countries that are gonna support whatever they do 

158.44 162.21 A: what do you think about france not really getting involved in this too much 

162.52 163.53 B: um 

163.95 169.44 B: you know i can i can understand ah their frustration with the way that a lot of things have been going 

169.57 172.30 B: in relation to international relations 

172.38 173.45 B: um 

173.67 175.90 B: i don't necessarily think that ah 

176.67 186.06 B: they've handled it in the most mature way possible [noise] um i i tend to favor germany's way of handling it which is basically to disapprove 

185.43 186.83 A: (( mhm yeah yeah )) 

186.14 194.26 B: and leave it at that whereas france has done things like you know striking the americans from their ah normandy 

194.32 196.08 B: monument 

195.31 197.76 A: oh yeah that was ridiculous 

196.55 201.15 B: and ah i mean that's that just strikes me as very immature you know 

201.75 204.58 B: so i mean what about you what do you think mhm 

204.06 210.05 A: yeah very immature and that you know they're they wanted it france is probably the biggest arms dealer in the world 

211.09 218.66 A: you know that that has i think that has a lot to do with them you know they they supply a lot they supply the middle east with a lot of weapons 

213.93 215.50 B: yeah 

219.06 224.93 A: you know and advan- i mean a lot of advance weapons almost comparable to what we've got 

219.19 220.27 B: mhm 

222.34 223.06 B: right 

224.52 225.85 B: (( right )) 

225.25 226.46 A: (( i mean they )) 

226.56 231.67 A: i guess i don't wanna i just can't see them standing neutral all the time that's a little too much 

230.57 236.14 B: yeah yeah yeah i can see that so do you consider them a a threat 

236.52 244.47 A: yeah i a a little bit when i say they're w- they're type they're a type of threat that's very covert you know ah 

243.53 244.32 B: mhm 

244.49 252.03 A: whatever the united states does they're al- it seems like they're always against it yeah a lotta opposition you know 

248.00 250.02 B: right the royal opposition 

250.84 251.63 B: right 

252.46 253.90 B: right 

253.90 260.77 A: but i think our biggest threat will come out of the middle east either either out of asia like you said korea 

254.30 255.10 B: but 

256.74 257.66 B: right 

259.91 264.14 B: right what about china what do you think about china 

263.87 268.19 A: i don't know i don't think they're that much of a threat they're busy trying to get their country together [noise] 

268.56 269.47 B: yeah 

269.52 272.30 A: (( you know [mn] i don't think they're really that much of a threat )) 

270.27 272.87 B: yeah i ah i don't know they er 

272.65 276.24 A: you you know they're already a nuclear power so they're really not that much of a threat 

276.20 282.65 B: right yeah i i do wish that they'd do more about about the north korea situation though but i mean i guess 

277.09 277.88 A: (( you know )) 

282.07 283.77 A: yeah 

283.17 285.88 B: i guess they can't be expected to work with us you know so but 

287.25 292.25 A: um it hasn't exploded yet but i i think the chinese have a lot of influence there 

292.48 295.71 B: right yeah aren't they aren't they north korea's biggest trade partner 

295.45 296.31 A: (( so yeah )) 

296.92 298.10 B: right so 

298.13 299.67 B: yeah i guess it would ah 

300.20 301.18 B: it would 

300.50 303.58 A: and you've gotta think we're doing a lot in taiwan so 

303.75 307.45 A: it's just going it's a little tit for tat i guess 

307.45 310.92 B: right right yeah they um 

311.70 313.30 B: yeah china that's 

313.99 316.13 B: [noise] i don't know i i don't i don't think they're 

317.05 323.80 B: like a a direct threat like you said or anything but i think that ah i think they they could evolve to be that way 

323.99 325.93 A: eventually yeah 

325.20 327.18 B: right right if ah 

327.86 330.00 B: if we don't mind our ps and qs [noise] 

329.46 330.13 A: (( if )) 

330.62 332.87 A: we don't we'll be in trouble [laughter] 

332.45 334.78 B: right [laughter] right 

333.26 335.80 A: we'll definitely be in trouble 

335.17 340.00 B: yeah the foreign the foreign policy of this administration's really frustrated me in so many ways 

339.43 340.02 A: (( yeah )) 

340.63 348.80 B: but i mean i i wouldn't say that the clinton administration was just a whole lot better but you know with their their ah do 

348.12 350.87 A: i think he was a little more decisive 

350.84 352.05 B: you think 

351.57 355.07 A: yeah a little more decisive a little more decisive than bush 

355.65 366.42 A: you know especially in the light of nine eleven i think he would have been more he would have been a little quicker and a little more decisive i think the united states i think we talked too much about what we were he talked too much what he was going to do 

361.06 361.94 B: mhm 

366.54 367.67 B: yeah 

367.14 368.75 A: and he gave them a chance to 

369.27 375.98 A: get rid of him hide and everything else i think if he'd have been more decisive within maybe a week or two 

372.03 373.39 B: right yeah 

376.14 378.55 A: i think he would have caught 'em with their pants down 

378.55 384.00 B: right yeah at the same time though i ah i i am glad that he 

382.33 387.43 A: i don't approve of war but sometimes we've got to protect ourselves some type of way 

387.54 400.37 B: right right absolutely so i i think though that ah you know i i was i was glad that he at least seemed to wait until they had they'd established at least most of the facts before he went into afghanistan 

400.68 405.24 A: yeah afghanistan i i i really didn't want 'em to go in they've been through enough 

401.08 401.82 B: yeah 

405.39 406.39 B: right 

405.81 409.58 A: they had the russians now they've got us right that's that's 

408.15 422.41 B: right yeah i actually heard an interesting ah statistic there comparing you know bush and the clinton foreign policy in ah kosovo the ratio to of of peace keepers to citizens was one to two hundred in afghanistan it's one to five thousand 

422.35 423.87 A: yeah that's whoa 

424.01 424.72 A: that's 

424.01 426.59 B: yeah so it's a i mean 

425.06 426.62 A: (( the ratio is really up )) 

426.94 430.88 B: we're we're really spreading ourselves real thin here and so 

429.32 430.48 A: real thin 

431.00 442.68 B: it's a i mean if and if we can't if we can't have an effective policy in those countries i think that i mean afghanistan i don't think has the resources to really be a threat 

442.52 447.95 A: no not yet they've got a long way to go before they become become a threat 

443.92 445.20 B: right right 

446.88 449.38 B: (( right right )) 

448.26 453.22 A: yeah we're just looking at something and they were over the internet and they were just saying ah 

453.66 463.67 A: they had some things to say about how thin we are stretched and i mean we're really thin they they're thinking about calling up the reserves they're wondering if they're going to attack libya you know 

464.12 465.22 B: wow 

465.24 466.22 A: that's 

465.46 470.60 B: yeah i had i had no idea that i mean i know that they're then but 

467.71 471.13 A: is it libya or liberia or yeah they 

471.95 482.48 A: he's thinking of sending troops then that's that's a little scary if we're we're stretched so thin if he does that then ooh he'll call up all the reserves and we'll be back at it again another war 

475.15 476.10 B: right 

479.98 481.00 B: yeah
