0.65 2.15 B: hi i'm mark 

1.22 2.02 A: (( [mn] )) 

2.06 3.92 A: hi i'm jeffrey how you doing 

3.58 4.79 B: pretty good how are you 

4.75 9.12 A: good good um as far as 

10.19 11.36 A: ah obtaining 

11.56 17.17 A: peace in the middle east no i don't think it [mn] look we this is two thousand and three 

17.38 21.65 A: and through all the presidents how many times have they gone through 

22.11 24.92 A: oh signing some 

25.69 28.88 A: form of you know settlement or peace 

29.16 30.81 A: i don't think it's going to happen 

30.80 31.80 B: right 

31.20 43.60 A: i don't at least let me say this i don't think it's going to happen in our lifetime you know it may happen when we're gone but i just don't see it happening in the next twenty thirty forty years 

44.07 49.93 B: i pretty much agree with you it's one of those things where because of the way the whole 

49.96 52.41 B: israeli state was created 

52.21 53.03 A: right 

52.92 58.40 B: i think it started as something that that automatically made people angry and 

57.50 58.88 A: right mhm 

58.44 69.77 B: in order to solve the problem it you've two points of view that really can't be reconciled one where people do not want the state to exist and one where people want their state so 

69.21 70.95 A: right yes 

70.81 72.63 B: i don't think the u._s. has 

71.09 72.05 A: yes 

72.64 79.01 B: any real part in the area but then again i don't think the u._s. has any real part in in most areas of world so 

78.06 80.46 A: [laughter] 

79.25 85.73 B: [laughter] that's more a function of the u._s. than it is of of the particular situation in the middle east 

85.19 86.09 A: right 

85.92 94.63 B: but i don't know how it can be reconciled with everything that's happened the problem is even if the two leaders 

94.57 106.15 B: want to solve the problems that are being faced and have made some progress every time some progress is made the extreme factions do something that causes all of the tensions to flare up once again 

104.87 112.08 A: [mn] to flare up and it just messes everything up that they have agreed to yeah yeah i i agree with you on that i agree with you 

112.16 113.27 A: um 

113.80 116.84 A: [mn] i you know the the 

118.04 123.37 A: you know as i listen to talk radio and i listen to opinions and 

123.38 132.45 A: try to hear what whether it's the left or the right trying to say this this needs to be done that needs to be done 

132.78 134.33 A: um 

135.59 139.91 A: i don't know and i'm and i think that's one of the things that 

140.37 146.19 A: i think people in general need to know if you're not if you're not israeli 

146.48 152.01 A: if you're not muslim or you know or or or or ah 

152.61 156.54 A: arabic or whatever it is that that that the other faction is 

157.24 158.01 A: (( [sigh] )) 

158.23 170.51 A: anybody that doesn't study that really doesn't know what the whole history is about i mean we know parts of it [mn] when i say we i should say i know parts of it 

170.34 171.36 B: right 

170.71 178.50 A: but to sit down and say i can out and out say this is the reason this is going on 

178.65 183.33 A: no i i really can't argue with that i only know parts of it 

183.83 189.32 A: i- i've heard what it is you know yes the u._s. aligns itself with israel 

189.14 200.78 A: and it makes it look bad because of the fact that the muslim world or the or the arabic world they look at it as like well you're aligning yourself with israel so now we're against you 

200.72 211.29 A: and you know i know that's part of the reason i understand that that that there's a whole lot that just that that goes on that unless you just sit down 

211.29 218.18 A: read the entire history of what's gone on since what is it nineteen sixties or nineteen fifties 

217.83 218.93 B: right 

218.23 220.51 A: we you really don't know 

220.93 227.37 B: i agree with that not to mention the religious background in order to understand the perspective 

221.16 222.23 A: you know 

224.96 225.52 A: (( [mn] )) 

225.79 226.86 A: yes 

227.46 229.89 B: when you read the koran and the torah 

230.23 241.72 B: the religious documents of of the sides and it's not even just two sides because you have the the break in the muslims the shiite versus the sunni which affects the area as well although it's not directly with the israeli problem 

232.94 233.71 A: right 

241.10 243.25 A: right right 

242.15 246.20 B: it's just such an incredibly complex issue that ah 

244.84 246.44 A: [laughter] it is 

246.22 257.19 B: i don't know i don't know that as you said anybody without first hand knowledge and even at this point it's it becomes such a blood feud it's almost like the ah 

257.13 258.77 A: hatfield mccoys 

258.12 261.50 B: exactly the family in west virginia i was trying to think of the name but 

260.32 260.94 A: (( [sigh] [mn] )) 

261.07 268.50 A: the hatfield mccoys have just recently signed an agreement to stop feuding with each other like what uh ten days ago 

268.04 276.28 B: yeah i i read that article and ah and that's exactly what i was thinking because they'd been feuding for so many generations the original point was almost lost 

273.92 274.83 A: (( [cough] )) 

275.72 284.42 A: you know right exactly and and i think that's the same thing that's going on in the middle east the original point of what they're feuding about 

284.48 290.70 A: almost kind of lost because of the fact that the media all all they do is 

291.18 299.29 A: they they talk about well you know oh this happens the terrorist takes out uh a bunch of israelis 

299.31 308.53 A: and the israelis re- retaliate but you know if you don't know the history the exact history 

308.83 313.79 A: um it's kind of hard to actually comment on it it really is because 

314.03 320.21 A: how are you going to comment on something that you don't know both sides i mean like i said based on the fact of 

320.33 335.04 A: i know a little bit about what's going on on one side a little bit about what's going on on the other side but i really don't know the entire history of why this whole thing that's going on in the middle east actually exists other than the fact that supposedly if you go by 

335.08 336.64 A: the most recent stuff 

336.75 348.18 A: the you know the israelis took a part of the um the gaza strip that was supposedly owned by you know the muslims and ah it just yeah 

348.08 362.42 B: right it's ah it's interesting i have a friend living in beirut and ah i've gotten a little bit more understanding of some of the things going on over there just from from hearing his discussions about going throughout the area 

352.14 353.05 A: okay 

358.05 359.13 A: mhm 

362.26 372.31 B: i think if anything though the middle east is becoming less stable because as israel has taken some of these actions they've been the aggressor in more actions and 

365.88 366.61 A: right 

370.54 371.89 A: yes 

372.27 380.28 B: gradually what's happening is it's seen as the u._s. and israel versus the arab muslim world and at that point 

377.02 379.86 A: [noise] yeah more of 

380.29 387.36 B: things like september eleventh come in and then the whole picture becomes more of a worldwide thing and and the u._s. is really 

388.00 390.45 B: not welcome in that area at all 

389.86 396.76 A: right ah yes i i agree with you on that ah so you have a friend that's in in the middle of all that 

396.32 399.52 B: a little bit yeah he just lives in beirut but ah 

397.35 398.42 A: a little bit 

399.50 409.88 B: you know he says on a day to day basis living there isn't it's very different but it's not different in a violent way he moved from the netherlands it's it's a totally different culture but 

407.59 408.44 A: okay 

409.74 416.21 B: on a day to day basis only every once in a while does he see the the real violence and the tensions you know 

416.23 419.39 B: every once in a while there's some shootings or some bombs 

419.44 424.88 B: in general though it's he says it's r- relatively peaceful though tense 

425.16 435.76 A: well how you know someone that's coming from an area that doesn't deal with that how is he able to cope with that because i'll be honest with you um look 

435.90 437.48 A: wh- where are you from 

437.17 439.64 B: i'm living in wisconsin now how about yourself oh 

438.70 440.97 A: wisconsin i'm from philadelphia 

440.59 441.60 B: okay 

441.18 451.47 A: um i grew up um i'm i'm a little i'm i'm perhaps a little older than you i grew up in the era of ah gang violence ah and had to deal with 

449.49 450.32 B: right 

451.29 465.18 A: running from that whole thing trying not to be recruited by gangs and um the whole thing of th- the sixties and seventies where ah if you weren't a part of a certain 

465.13 469.46 A: you know um um block or 

469.52 473.60 A: ar- area you know you were considered ah 

474.22 477.05 A: [sigh] let's say what's the what would the word be 

477.24 484.01 A: you were y- you could be part of any group um i grew up in a in a area where there were like 

484.10 486.97 A: oh four or five gangs 

486.37 488.15 B: (( mhm )) 

487.56 489.37 A: and um 

489.40 493.22 A: you know they tried to recruit me but that wasn't the way i was going 

493.19 499.62 A: so my thing was i'm just going to be you know as they call it a free spirit 

499.55 513.63 A: and you know i was they tried to recruit me on several occasions but sometimes when things happened it was like a situation of where oh he's part of that gang he's part of that gang he's part now i wasn't a part of any gang 

513.37 514.74 B: right 

514.06 515.05 A: so 

515.18 519.47 A: it it and trust me this is not even anywhere 

519.70 526.29 A: in comparison to what's going on in the middle east i can only give you a little bit i mean because of the fact that 

526.26 538.74 A: we're talking about bombs you know actual shootings going on on a daily basis you know the fact that you have to live under this this this whole thing of planes flying over you don't know what's going on we're 

538.85 543.31 A: just talking about the fact of people trying to take over territories 

542.98 544.01 B: yeah 

543.44 550.42 A: you know and and and to me that doesn't even compare i mean yes it's dangerous but 

551.04 560.81 B: i out there you have the governments doing it instead of just the you know the lone people whether it's the dealers or the mafia or whatever you have in a in a gang situation 

551.24 553.17 A: um 

556.29 557.39 A: right 

560.33 561.16 A: right 

561.23 575.98 B: i think i don't think i could live under the stress of that either it's just got to be a a totally different experience from what we're used to i grew up in d._c. so there was a fair amount of you know random violence as well but ah 

565.66 567.14 A: [mn] i agree with you 

574.91 576.21 A: oh okay 

576.10 582.49 B: but it doesn't compare at all to the situation where you have people who are doing suicide bombings and things like 

580.87 590.70 A: [mn] right ex- yeah that doesn't compare i agree with you i agree with you um yes without question [laughter] what part of d._c. did you grow up in 

585.48 587.95 B: (( um )) 

590.46 599.95 B: i was on the northwest side but i ah when i was growing up as a kid i pretty much went all over the city my parents weren't around a whole lot so i i went ah used public transit
