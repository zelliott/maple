103.95 107.21 B: yeah i don't think that i don't think that um 

108.05 111.63 B: even though i think the pole shows that he's uh 

112.37 115.62 B: that that whatever he's he's um 

116.44 124.62 B: or they have questions about this whole iranian thing from i don't think that deep down like joe with six pack really cares 

124.44 125.61 A: yeah 

125.04 125.90 B: (( you know )) 

126.10 131.13 A: i don't know i have a friends that's he's born and raised in florida i call him the good old boy

138.84 139.91 A: (( about it )) 

144.26 152.42 B: you gotta think that that that's money coming out of i think what happened was well i think if joe six pack thinks anything he's upset that um 

152.81 164.53 B: [cough] that they threatened to take away his over time recently so i think that they see that then all of a sudden they say well wait a minute all of that money is going to the middle east why you know 

155.43 156.64 A: oh yeah 

162.58 163.52 A: yeah 

163.94 170.75 A: don't you think we're getting paid by those uh iraqi oil uh which are now they are now shipping to kuwait 

170.82 174.49 B: um they might be yeah but i don't know if 

174.51 181.23 B: i i think they're probably making more money somehow down through the lines of how burton 

181.27 188.28 B: and um that other san francisco base company that but um 

184.48 185.53 A: (( oh yeah )) 

188.76 193.50 B: no you know i mean i think eventually it's it's up to um 

194.11 195.91 B: it's up to the uh 

196.48 203.53 B: if they're if it's going to work they have got to sort of say that they really do want to build sort of a democracy in iraq like 

203.67 208.79 B: in iraq and in that case they really can't they can't just off the um 

204.35 205.16 A: yeah 

209.35 214.19 B: the um oil besides they have got we've already that we've already taken 

213.75 216.14 A: well it's still the spoils of war 

216.02 219.70 A: that's why bush took us to war cause uh for the spoils of war 

219.61 232.07 A: we yeah iraqi are worried they don't talk much about it but they are there but do you think the u._s. is going to help with the position over there do you think there the position in iraq we are going to achieve help achieve some peace over there and some 

231.90 234.90 A: real estate you know everybody should be able to 

234.32 238.19 B: (( uh you know what i don't know i mean you know what )) 

236.86 238.47 A: (( live and stuff )) 

238.25 243.67 B: i don't know i i i i wish that i i wish that i knew 

244.18 245.49 B: (( i mean cause )) 

245.51 253.15 B: i'm always sceptical of of kind of any assumption made by by any kind of party line 

253.71 255.95 B: sort of political 

255.55 256.41 A: yeah 

256.29 259.23 B: um system in american because 

259.57 268.80 B: the right doesn't know anything about what's going on in iraq and really the last hasn't been there either i mean for it most part nobody's travelled to iraq 

264.94 265.80 A: right 

268.80 276.15 B: nobody really knows what's going on you know it's like the only little slippage you get is when you hear sort of 

276.48 279.20 B: a disgruntle colin powell between 

279.44 289.33 B: you know between colon powell and and the rest of the administration and so it's kind of like you sort of extrapolate from that that probably what they are doing isn't the best idea 

289.51 292.17 B: but i don't necessarily know that it was 

292.36 295.54 B: that it was the spoils of war you know i don't necessarily know it was 

295.55 297.80 B: it like war for conquest 

297.68 298.63 A: (( mhm )) 

298.05 300.75 B: because i just you know 

301.51 304.36 B: if we're going to do that we can take over the caribbean or something 

305.07 307.23 B: although i suppose we already have 

306.53 307.76 A: yeah i think so 

308.51 309.45 B: um 

308.93 313.15 A: but do you think that now we're in afghanistan or in iraq do you think that 

312.68 315.56 B: well afghanistan now is different because 

315.67 318.89 B: we're what we're doing in afghanistan is um 

319.36 324.92 B: there's a um there is an argentinian oil company known as corporation 

324.93 327.51 B: um and um they're run by a 

328.24 329.23 B: (( by a )) 

329.34 336.05 B: business man who is pretty well known in argentina named um my guess is my spanish is bad but 

336.21 337.17 B: (( um )) 

339.14 339.84 A: mhm 

340.79 347.27 B: and um he was working with the taliban years before all of this stuff happened like in nineteen ninety seven ninety eight 

347.47 352.10 B: um because they had taken power in afghanistan and um 

352.48 353.76 B: and he um 

354.13 356.20 B: he [noise] he basically 

356.27 362.60 B: had had a whole had a whole contract set up with them to run an oil pipe line from 

362.74 367.26 B: to the indian ocean straight through afghanistan right and um 

367.39 370.39 B: his main competition was unicol which is 

371.10 375.27 B: which is based in texas and basically it's all of bush's buddies 

375.47 376.41 B: um 

377.18 378.32 B: so 

378.37 385.70 B: unicol was unicol went over there and they saw how hostile the taliban were they left in like nineteen ninety nine 

385.81 388.06 B: (( so um )) 

388.07 399.47 B: so when when this whole um after september eleven we went over there one of one of the side effects of of sort of taking out the taliban was that we also got rid of um 

399.51 402.43 B: all of the contracts involved between um 

403.08 406.48 B: and the taliban and now unicol pipe line 

406.69 408.42 B: so that's just kind of funny 

408.61 413.50 A: it's like a the government is in with the corporations to do things 

412.12 423.03 B: but yeah well they absolutely are and especially with bush and i mean you know ashcroft and rumsfeld are sort of like nixon boys but i don't know if they um 

423.59 431.11 B: they're not they're not so intertwined with big business and chaney chaney's 

427.56 429.59 A: right right 

431.58 437.85 B: he's got he's a he's a walking one he's a walking [noise] but you know 

437.13 448.41 A: but do you think that will influence the people in the middle east at all you think that's basically the same thing that you see that it's just a big business trying to get their their claws into their natural resources 

444.64 448.90 B: (( [noise] i don't know )) 

448.48 454.41 A: or big uh colonial powers trying to reassert their um 

452.38 456.99 B: i don't know i'm sure i'm sure that it's pretty i'm sure that you know 

457.17 459.77 B: like ever watch like the b._b._c. 

459.65 460.53 A: yes 

460.43 471.65 B: i mean they sort of they sort of show i'm sure there's both sides of the coin you know i'm sure there are people that are that really are happy to see that that that that saddam maybe 

471.83 473.24 B: now iran or 

475.21 478.00 B: who knows who the next country of the month will be but i'm 

478.11 490.27 B: sure they're happy to see g._i.s come in and kind of kick out the oppressors and their hopeful that you know some kind of economic stability or you know something will happen to the region but um 

491.67 493.59 B: you know and there's 

494.21 497.93 B: eighteen year old american soldiers getting shot everyday 

497.95 498.80 A: yeah 

499.07 501.32 B: and those people aren't too happy 

500.74 505.74 A: yeah and what are the reasons for not being happy that's the question 

505.40 518.16 B: yeah yeah well you know it's it's partly our fault it's partly our kind of un- unwaver insensitive attitude towards the rest of the world and then it's also 

518.29 521.82 B: partly they're ignorance you know they think that america's this one big 

522.33 525.17 B: (( kind of bohemist )) 

525.20 539.03 B: you know scientist um or or or this one country of white people run by jews and operated by jews and that and that we're just kind of slaves and scientists but you know 

538.75 539.57 A: (( mhm )) 

539.26 541.04 B: (( so i don't know )) 

541.67 544.75 B: who knows i mean you know and actually you know 

545.19 547.77 B: we always say here that that um 

548.36 552.08 B: stereotypes are often partly true you know 

551.82 558.15 A: i lived in saudi arabia for a while yeah and i found the people there to be um 

553.99 556.79 B: oh you did oh

572.78 573.49 B: uh-huh 

573.40 584.97 A: and the family all of the aunts and uncles the grandmother the grandfather great grandmother great grandfather if they're still alive nieces and cousins even they'd all live there together 

573.50 591.81 B: (( mhm mhm ))
