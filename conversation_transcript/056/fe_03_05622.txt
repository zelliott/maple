22.68 26.48 A: yeah i just got in so that's kind of a weird thing um 

26.06 27.52 B: so um 

27.40 32.32 A: we're talking about strikes with major sports players 

30.79 33.32 B: like professionals sports teams 

32.47 36.03 A: is there a major strike going on i don't follow sports um 

35.05 38.68 B: [laughter] neither do i so i couldn't tell you if anything's going on 

37.81 42.26 A: well i can tell you that i do think from my 

42.33 51.66 A: point of view which may be distanced that it is kind of ridiculous to have a strike over um like how rich you are you know what i mean 

46.02 47.52 B: (( i think )) 

51.31 59.28 B: so too well if it's about money if it that i agree with you actually if if the if the strike is about money 

59.18 60.26 A: mhm 

59.43 65.11 B: i think that those guys are like way too over paid but um 

65.14 71.64 B: if it's about maybe something else if there's some kind of like a working condition or you know something that's not really right 

71.94 78.54 B: you know safety or whatever i can understand that if it needs if it's an issue like that but if it's about money no 

76.94 77.89 A: well 

78.14 82.66 A: how often is it that issue [laughter] it's always about money or 

80.49 81.42 B: yeah 

83.10 85.27 A: at least almost always 

84.67 86.62 B: yeah it sure seems to be 

85.41 86.50 A: um 

86.83 92.85 A: i know my dad is like a huge he he gets all pissed when they strike but um 

93.74 97.69 A: i guess it's just like celebrities um 

97.81 104.54 A: you know we designate these certain people in these certain certain positions in life for like 

104.80 108.03 A: the highest of salaries and um 

106.84 108.60 B: mhm 

108.11 115.97 A: why sports bought into that i'm not really sure i can understand um like sammy sosa somebody that's breaking records 

115.95 117.74 B: ah i can't even understand 

116.09 125.79 A: you know capitalizing off of michael jordan the ones that stick out but you have you know george small from the toronto blue jays who's like making just as much money too 

125.88 130.03 B: that well that's the thing i mean these guys are um 

130.23 135.81 B: they you know it all sort of escalated i think in the sixties 

135.71 136.79 A: mhm 

136.20 140.01 B: late six- i think maybe the early seventies i can't remember exactly who it was that 

140.03 144.51 B: there was this one player and then another player and as soon as 

144.67 145.72 B: they 

146.03 147.18 B: um 

147.19 151.53 B: negotiated their own new contracts um 

152.00 158.66 B: that were like these outrageous deals ah everybody had to get in on it like you you were kind of left behind if you didn't do it 

154.64 155.58 A: mhm 

158.60 159.57 A: right 

158.64 167.59 B: and um and it just sort of upped the anti on everything um it made them more um 

168.46 174.31 B: ah you know they needed they needed to make more money you know the ball team needed to make more money to 

174.25 183.61 B: pay them ah so however they were going to do that they so they tried to like licensing more stuff and promoting you know putting their um 

184.06 192.32 B: ah you know they had the players like endorsing more things and you know all this stuff and um 

192.66 195.78 B: it all just kind of escalated into this kind of 

195.89 197.47 B: ridiculous 

197.69 199.58 B: it was out of touch with reality 

199.63 201.66 A: yeah it is ridiculous 

201.11 201.91 B: (( you know )) 

201.78 204.66 A: it's just um you know 

204.74 212.30 A: it's just like anything like anything else like an apartment building or a car like people are willing to pay certain 

212.53 218.04 A: um dividends for certain things and these baseball companies are willing to pay these players 

217.84 219.52 B: yeah 

218.14 230.26 A: ridiculous amounts of money and to me it really makes me wonder like how much money goes into the industry itself i i'm thinking baseball because that's usually the strikes i would hear about um 

228.73 229.98 B: yeah 

230.71 233.86 A: i guess it would could happen in any um 

234.12 236.52 A: sport or sports association 

236.17 241.34 B: i think so but baseball is the is the one that it seems to happen in 

237.83 238.88 A: um 

242.07 252.34 A: i just i don't know like if they're all getting paid that much like i said like even the lowest of the players is still making like i don't know like at least a half million or something 

251.81 254.12 B: yeah exactly 

253.15 254.14 A: um 

254.43 262.14 A: so if they're getting that much money with that many players i mean and i'm including like runners and stuff because they get paid too 

262.23 263.26 A: um 

262.83 264.99 B: yeah and it's all just and it's just 

263.85 270.46 A: where is this money coming from 'cause i i mean how much mo- how much money can a baseball team make in a year 

270.81 273.71 A: i mean i i'm from chicago so 

273.83 282.79 A: um i'm used to wrigley field and what used to be comiskey park it's now u- u- u._s._a. soldiers field and like wrigley field is small 

279.74 281.51 B: mhm 

283.00 287.34 A: it's usually a good turnout but it's really small and then comiskey is never full 

287.35 290.59 A: and i just i always wonder like how they make all this money 

290.75 292.41 B: yeah well 

291.82 293.94 A: where exactly it comes from 

293.64 300.59 B: well i don't i don't know if it's from selling the tickets as much as it is from all the different um 

299.95 302.11 A: advertisements and whatnot 

301.31 304.38 B: advertisements and and ah 

304.39 309.63 B: yeah those kinds of like i think the t- i'm not really sure about this and i should know because 

309.74 314.37 B: i work in advertising but i don't work in this end of it um 

315.29 322.27 B: i think that you know volumes are generally you know expensive to advertise on or at i should say 

322.93 337.49 B: or during and um i mean certainly the big ones you know the big games are you know the world series and all those things like super bowl and all that but um super bowl's like the highest priced advertising of the year you probably know that 

336.84 338.28 A: yeah 

337.63 339.35 B: (( um [laughter] )) 

338.33 340.78 A: those are the fun commercials to watch 

340.03 341.98 B: yeah they are actually 

341.68 347.03 A: um i watch it for the commercials in fact um 

345.74 347.62 B: you want what 

347.15 351.92 A: i said i watch the super bowl for the commercials i think a lot of people do though 

351.68 355.45 B: oh i know i went to a super bowl party this past year that 

355.43 370.01 B: was i mean nobody was interested in watching the actual game people people in fact we turned the sound down during the game and when the commercials came on we turned the sound back up [laughter] that's exactly how it went it was really funny actually 

359.17 360.13 A: no 

366.39 367.75 A: exactly 

369.62 376.21 A: sports our sports culture in this country and you know it it's not only in this country i was just reading a book
