0.68 3.42 B: oh yes hello my name is john 

3.63 8.50 A: oh hi my name is ah thomas ah i'm from the university of akron 

8.89 12.08 B: ah thomas where did you say you were from 

11.76 13.64 A: (( ah the university of akron )) 

13.76 15.32 A: in akron ohio 

13.84 19.05 B: oh akr- oh yes yes oh i'm here in new york city 

18.56 19.65 A: (( oh okay )) 

19.45 24.78 B: and i understand they want us to converse about the topic of airport security 

24.44 25.74 A: that's true 

25.56 38.10 A: um right now i i i guess um after post ah september eleventh the airport security had ah has tightened and that there have been a lot of ah changes in the general airport security 

37.86 42.83 A: and i feel that ah it is for the for the good of the citizens 

43.31 53.30 B: oh ah well actually i myself have not travelled ah ah purposely because i don't have any confidence in the airlines 

47.52 48.49 A: okay 

53.31 57.66 B: i think they did a very poor job of screening passengers 

57.71 61.07 B: and i i think yes the 

60.86 73.17 B: current security is very heightened and i think it's very misguided ah i don't think it's contributing much to the sense of security or safety 

73.28 77.72 A: oh in what sense do you say that it would be misguided 

76.79 83.97 B: well by and large the people we're supposed to be looking for are the arab terrorists and their moslem sympathizers 

84.13 89.51 B: um ah there is no point in ah inspecting every per- single passenger's 

84.36 85.22 A: uh-huh 

89.64 102.78 B: luggage in my opinion i think that's simply pointless ah that only generates great expense ah it causes great inconvenience takes enormous amounts of time 

102.92 113.73 B: and we're simply inspecting luggage of persons who are not terrorists anyone can see that it's as plain as the nose on their face i think this is very very misguided 

113.27 124.71 A: okay ah in that ah sense i would like to differ on that point saying that i mean when somebody comes there you could look at his face and tell that he was a terrorist 

124.58 128.49 A: obviously um you would not allow him to go through 

128.55 129.84 A: (( and the )) 

130.00 136.90 A: thing is that ah human beings are so diverse in the sense that a terrorist may not necessarily be 

137.13 147.45 A: an ar- arab national it could be some someone within someone who's a white american could also be a terrorist so i mean yes 

146.57 153.75 B: no there haven't been that many cases of those persons ah most of them have been overseas nationals or um 

150.04 150.88 A: (( oh ah )) 

153.80 165.02 B: ah various disgruntled persons who became moslem it's a very very small group of persons who are responsible for this it doesn't appeal to the rest of us 

165.18 167.35 A: i i 

165.42 171.28 B: and um i just think it's ah an awful waste of time at the airports 

170.60 183.63 A: i don't understand that but at the same time airport security has been i mean in throughout the world when you look at airport security in general the american airport security has had always been 

183.47 187.63 A: (( ah very um relaxed and um people here )) 

187.56 197.17 A: could just buy a ticket over the internet and go there half an hour before the flight and just manage to catch the flight which used to be a very 

197.04 208.45 A: extremely convenient for them but ah that is exactly what has been realized over a period of time that that has um that that is exactly what 

208.23 213.68 A: the terrorists use you know they just walk in there with um a lot of 

213.70 220.32 A: um a lot of things and then just ah went went past because the security was not tight enough i mean 

220.14 231.67 A: when i go to the airport today although i know that the security is tight i feel much more safer when i'm being checked because i know that the other people are also being checked 

230.71 234.90 B: oh um have you flown recently since the terrorist attack 

234.36 246.42 A: yes i have flown recently i mean i was subjected to search and all those things it was a bit of inconvenience ah but then you look at it i mean it's just three minutes of inconvenience 

246.30 254.23 A: and when i am flying i have the security of knowing that if i was checked somebody else was also checked and everybody else got checked 

254.09 267.27 B: oh well yes although from most reports of what i hear it's not just three minutes of inconvenience ah many people come back complaining and speaking of having to stand in lines for forty minutes 

267.76 270.84 B: ah their luggage is rummaged through 

270.84 284.45 B: ah their pockets are rifled through by these agents ah they're they're being xrayed their bags are being xrayed and it seems to be taking a lot more than a few minutes from what most people say 

282.73 293.48 A: okay i i i guess i went a little early in the sense that at that time i did not have to go through the line but i do appreciate what you're saying that ah if it is 

293.34 299.51 A: you have to be in a line now or something like that for forty minutes then we we do have to 

299.36 314.31 A: ah streamline the process of the security checks i i i appreciate your point when you say that the ah the checks have to be a little more organized and screening the passengers whose luggage had to be opened 

314.77 319.16 B: [noise] yeah i i think one of the things with that airport security 

319.52 324.65 B: that was enormously helpful in the days right after the terrorist attack 

324.73 335.28 B: was the demanding by the united states authorities of an advance passenger manifest before the aircraft was permitted to arrive in the united states 

335.38 344.90 B: i think that cut down on a lot of terrorist activities since we can control what goes on in our own borders but not what goes on overseas 

335.53 336.48 A: okay 

344.82 345.73 A: (( [noise] yes )) 

345.35 349.76 B: heaven only knows what's coming towards us on some of these foreign airlines 

350.04 358.64 B: ah a number of them you know are very sympathetic to um ah arab terrorism and they really don't care 

358.18 364.11 A: [noise] that is also true yes i i i i believe that a lot of ah 

364.27 372.30 A: at the at the international level and you have international airports they should also screen the people coming and 

372.65 383.39 A: coming in from outside in terms of but as far as i understand the visa consulates who grant the visas do screen candidates quite a bit but i 

383.28 389.27 A: do not think there is a such a of background checks conducted at the overseas level 

389.33 392.44 A: before granting visas so that probably 

391.14 400.08 B: no i i agree with you there's ver- very little um surveillance going on at that point it's simply a clerical transaction 

399.83 405.51 A: exactly so i i i do appreciate your point again that if we have something 

405.30 417.50 A: of more of a background check that the ah local authorities over there before somebody could um process his or her visa to the united states that would also be probably a good measure 

417.72 424.63 B: yes so that's advance passenger manifest seemed to be very effective for a while 

424.83 426.87 B: i'm not sure if the 

427.28 433.14 B: ah u._s. federal government is still following that particular procedure 

433.60 436.93 B: maybe they are or perhaps they have um 

436.95 442.55 B: abandoned it but it seemed to be a very effective procedure in the initial um 

442.64 444.97 B: months after the terrorist attack 

445.37 452.69 A: that's that's true again the the airport security level when you talk about that i mean do 

453.48 461.81 A: i mean would you rather put yourself through ah a long wait than you know fly over 

461.99 463.69 A: (( in an airplane [noise] with- )) 

463.92 467.05 A: without having the security of knowing that it is safe 

467.87 471.67 A: (( is that something you would i mean there's obviously )) 

470.64 477.69 B: i i don't really see the security as a problem i see it as the arab people and their moslem sympathizers 

477.78 479.53 B: they're the only problems 

479.61 487.72 B: there seems to be a lot of misguided activity that we have to check this we don't have to check anything what we've got to do is keep those people under surveillance 

479.81 480.61 A: (( hello )) 

487.55 490.53 A: oh okay i mean but that again 

490.66 503.47 A: i mean if there are a hundred arabs and a hundred moslems that probably only two or three of them are terrorists so again that on the on the same token you would be subjecting the rest of the innocent people 

503.63 505.31 A: under you know 

504.46 507.67 B: i don't see any of them as innocent 

506.97 508.23 A: [laughter] okay 

508.17 515.80 B: not one of them so i have a very easy way of handling arab terrorism believe me 

508.39 509.37 A: (( um )) 

509.89 510.99 A: okay 

514.76 515.69 A: okay 

515.84 519.69 B: um but ah my ways do not prevail 

519.74 532.12 B: so they are free to ah come and go as they please and do their mischief but ah if it were my way believe me there would be fewer of them around to tell the tale and laugh about it 

525.17 526.18 A: okay 

532.48 539.69 A: okay and then from what i understand i mean i have i do have a few moslem friends ah 

539.62 547.50 A: it is sometimes i mean i would i would disagree with that point of view that you know all of them are terrorists or all of them have 

547.55 556.71 A: ah i mean it's those people who are fanatics that are causing these problems but ah i presume the other people are 

556.70 565.68 A: more liberal in their viewpoints and um there are i mean i would not rather punish the innocent to catch the guilty 

565.73 573.29 A: and that's the whole premise of um the the democrat precis and the constitution that we have here 

573.46 576.42 A: so i mean that's my personal viewpoint again 

575.89 579.04 B: well that seems to be the viewpoint that's prevailing 

579.21 580.21 A: okay 

580.28 586.23 B: and i guess that's why we have lines of forty minutes where even small children are being searched 

586.55 591.07 B: in a misguided effort to somehow catch terrorists 

591.44 599.89 A: i mean in that sense that i mean when you say that i mean tomorrow if a christian commits a crime you cannot punish all christianity you know
