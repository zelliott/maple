0.48 7.77 A: i am smit calling from melvin so i'm a business student in the university of melvin college and i would like to 

6.38 9.57 B: (( hi there ah my name is brendan )) 

9.76 10.56 A: (( who all )) 

9.81 11.20 B: (( and i )) 

12.07 14.19 B: live in ridgewood queens 

15.49 17.47 A: right okay 

17.58 20.60 B: so let's let's talk about terrorists 

21.09 23.02 B: getting into the airports 

21.14 22.21 A: yeah 

22.87 26.39 A: getting into the airport under the security measures nowadays 

27.37 31.38 A: and there is going to be of any help what do you think 

31.29 34.94 B: um well the methods that they use 

35.35 43.29 B: are pretty strange i have to say so i mean any any increased awareness is going to 

38.77 39.47 A: (( mm )) 

43.32 51.31 B: lessen the [noise] um risk but i think the ways that they do it are kind of strange what do what about you 

52.04 66.52 A: yeah kind of similar thought because like what has happened after the nine eleven is that in the airport if you go instead of all the attempts like you had just like say half an hour to go to the internal passengers now it takes around two hours to do the same thing 

63.71 65.71 B: mhm 

66.60 76.67 A: so it's an increase in the time the waiting time the queuing i but i'm not sure whether these effects are really effective to encounter the threats by the terrorists 

76.94 77.93 A: so 

77.24 83.29 B: well they might be doing stuff that we don't know about while we wait [laughter] 

82.84 85.56 A: yeah correct 

85.06 86.69 B: (( but ah you know )) 

87.21 94.47 B: it has been a while since i've been to the airport but when i the last time i went it was right after the whole september eleventh thing 

94.48 95.54 A: okay 

94.64 97.26 B: and they were picking out random people 

97.27 100.50 A: right exactly 

98.39 100.31 B: and 

100.59 108.38 B: i mean i don't think they were profiling like the race or anything which i don't think is necessary anyway 

105.65 106.72 A: mhm 

108.42 109.45 B: but 

109.46 112.42 B: you know just to pick out random people 

112.87 116.64 B: is kind of weird like why not just put everyone through the same 

116.15 119.93 A: everyone through the same process rather than picking up random people 

120.28 134.01 A: right in fact um just after the nine eleven i went on an international trip to india and in cheffields i had a similar experience where i mean i was not picked but that the passenger right in front of me he was randomly chosen 

134.35 142.55 A: and and incidentally she was an old lady an old age like fifty five five so it makes no sense to pick her 

134.44 136.28 B: mhm 

139.96 141.03 B: yeah 

142.98 147.31 A: when a young man like me is standing just behind her so 

147.53 151.63 B: yeah the same thing the same thing happened to me and it was like a little girl 

152.46 153.48 A: right 

152.73 155.08 B: like a like a like a 

155.25 157.92 B: you know a fourteen year old girl or something so 

155.60 156.44 A: (( i )) 

158.07 171.65 A: was on the verge of asking the question to the op- to the cop standing over there that what possible threat do you foresee from this old lady but anyway i refrained myself from asking that question because i didn't want myself to put in a very 

166.17 167.27 B: [laughter] 

171.82 172.71 A: (( you know )) 

173.60 175.04 A: (( blah blah blah )) 

174.73 181.49 B: yeah well then if if if you ask that then they might put you into the whole routine 

179.94 181.36 A: [laughter] 

181.99 183.00 A: right 

182.10 183.01 B: you know 

183.32 191.92 A: but what i personally feel is like if i'm in an airport when i was standing in the queues and like there is definitely is an increase in of passengers 

192.31 198.12 A: like they know the importance of security and what it means to them and to you as the whole 

197.97 199.19 B: mhm 

198.38 203.72 A: but i somehow believe that way officials take kind of take some measured steps 

204.07 215.97 A: i mean just as you said that picking someone at random if i know it will take more time to screen all the passengers but i think to provide a full of security 

216.42 217.99 A: one should do such things 

217.88 224.37 B: yeah well i guess it adds a fear factor the the fact that possibility of getting 

224.46 230.11 B: caught if you're a terrorist the possibility that you could be chosen at random 

230.11 231.02 A: uh-huh 

230.90 231.92 B: but 

232.32 235.11 B: still it's a the terrorist you know if 

235.40 240.62 B: if it's true what they say about the terrorists being all suicidal then that doesn't matter 

240.76 242.12 A: right 

241.64 246.08 B: because they don't they don't fear anything they don't have any 

246.53 247.50 B: (( ah )) 

248.17 250.35 B: you know concept of risk 

250.95 256.34 A: correct they are like yeah they're tailored for those jobs and so 

257.53 258.59 A: right 

259.81 262.22 B: but i do think um 

262.47 263.78 B: you know maybe 

265.29 271.98 B: they they probably thought it through you know i trust them to you know think about the best way of 

272.53 277.02 B: doing it i never really understood the random thing though i just 

275.94 286.25 A: right even like ah i'm supposed to go to atlanta the next week and then i was just talking with this agent of delta but she told gives me that notice you have to 

286.21 299.28 A: on line check in firstly also where i can possibly get a boarding pass from my home and i can check into the main airport lounge right in front of the flight gate fifteen minutes before the departure 

292.13 293.94 B: mhm 

299.66 301.39 B: mhm 

300.00 307.53 A: so i don't really think if to face a scenario then i mean can you really check who i am [laughter] 

307.33 308.25 B: [laughter] 

308.11 312.99 A: i don't know how you just going to enhance the security measures and all of the stuff 

313.74 315.31 B: yeah i know 

315.51 316.51 A: right 

315.94 319.15 B: so what do you think about people um 

319.39 323.03 B: what do you think about them like having the armed guards 

323.64 327.86 B: ah standing at the ready all the time in the airports and subways and stuff 

329.72 330.93 A: ah 

331.06 331.80 A: (( it's )) 

331.10 332.69 B: it's kind of disturbing 

332.77 340.58 A: yeah i think it's an extension of the because before nine eleven also you had like armed guards standing in the airport 

340.48 341.34 B: mhm 

340.74 345.58 A: now also you have the same thing but maybe they are now taking extra measures 

345.71 351.87 A: so just by giving some armed guards i don't think it's going to really help ease the threat 

352.53 360.31 A: rather than the constants of the product screening the passengers like that will be of more help what do you think 

358.57 360.09 B: mhm 

360.80 366.52 B: well i don't i don't think it's that you know that's going to help that much anyway because 

366.04 367.50 A: exactly 

366.90 378.49 B: they've got these huge guns and you know they're pretty dangerous and sure they're trained and stuff but in an airport there's people everywhere you know when are they going to get a chance to 

378.52 382.36 B: use those guns you know is it just to stand there and look scary 

382.96 395.10 B: you know they can't it's not if someone you know busts out and they're a terrorist and they've got somebody hostage or something those those are not going to be able to do much especially in a hostage type situation 

382.99 383.98 A: right 

392.96 393.99 A: yeah 

395.12 398.66 A: exactly like with so many people all around the terminal so 

399.35 401.21 A: yeah that's true 

402.19 404.79 B: and again you know the the 

402.34 403.12 A: so 

405.27 418.70 B: the people that are the terrorists that are going to take someone hostage they don't care what happens to them anyway so they don't they'll just kill 'em if something if if they think they're going to die they're just going to take someone else with them so 

409.36 410.36 A: right 

413.46 414.54 A: exactly 

419.31 432.87 A: yeah is it easy for them i mean even with all the security measures and so called the homeland security system these people mentioned if you go to an airport it's very easy for any terrorist as you said to take someone as hostage it doesn't take 

432.88 435.14 A: much effort on your side to do so 

435.18 436.13 B: yeah 

435.54 442.17 A: but i don't know how to encounter that or what steps the government has taken to encounter such possible threats 

442.57 444.34 B: yeah i don't know i mean 

445.12 450.61 B: it's not it's not my job to think of ah you know what can stop these terrorists but 

450.74 456.91 B: it's beyond me what you can do to for someone that against someone who 

457.06 462.49 B: is a living bomb you know like a the the suicide thing 

461.77 465.75 A: suicide bomber right mhm 

464.86 467.44 B: um i don't there's not much you can 

468.00 473.93 B: there's just not much you can do i mean you can scare them but you can try to scare them but it doesn't seem like that works 

474.02 475.86 A: [laughter] correct you're right 

475.28 476.27 B: um 

477.55 479.90 B: so you know i think 

479.98 487.84 B: the security measures there must be something something behind it but i think if anything they should have something that's 

487.93 490.51 B: behind the scenes and they probably do 

490.50 491.37 A: (( mhm )) 

490.66 494.44 B: such as undercover ah people or 

494.77 498.14 B: you know some kind of surveillance [noise] 

498.45 499.65 A: (( right mhm )) 

499.08 501.95 B: that ah is not directly visible you know 

503.43 504.82 A: (( mm right true it )) 

503.91 504.64 B: (( so )) 

505.59 508.93 B: you know that's technology got to develop something 

509.18 512.59 B: that people don't know about or won't expect 

513.02 516.45 B: so it takes something you know it takes some thinking 

516.66 520.83 A: (( does take some thinking and it's probably such effect so )) 

521.32 522.27 A: (( natural )) 

523.40 525.44 A: (( i mean ah what not )) 

524.45 526.75 B: but on the other hand you know it's like 

527.30 530.96 B: with the with the whole increase of surveillance you know it's kind of 

531.58 535.16 B: it's annoying that that you have to put up with it you know 

535.35 541.15 B: as a as a citizen why should we you know why should we have even more surveillance 

542.39 544.00 B: even if it 

544.16 548.45 B: especially when it's not going to help much you know it just seems like an invasion 

548.56 552.56 B: of one's own country on oneself you know 

548.74 549.84 A: uh-huh 

552.37 555.66 A: (( right right yeah )) 

554.99 561.15 B: i think a lot of people are concerned about that that whole thing the orwellian nightmare 

561.56 562.46 A: correct 

563.11 564.04 A: that's true 

564.56 568.88 A: like basically of being like i i am of a religious citizen 

568.94 571.57 A: i know that i'm a very honest citizen i 

572.33 575.97 A: (( don't trust to others so increasing surveillance is is )) 

576.02 580.36 A: going to irritate me to some extent and true that's true 

580.51 584.77 B: it's well i mean i don't feel like i'm in danger either 

584.90 586.81 B: but it's just a matter of like 

587.19 592.39 B: you know you give ah you give the government certain powers of surveillance 

592.43 593.35 A: (( correct )) 

592.91 597.98 B: and maybe it gets out of hand you know maybe society starts um 

598.00 599.95 B: becoming too method
