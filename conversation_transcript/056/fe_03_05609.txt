33.75 36.52 A: well it's it's pretty pretty funny 

35.89 37.68 B: uh have have you done it 

37.10 42.27 A: no never done it so what what what should we we should be talking about the topic at hand is that right 

41.07 44.53 B: yeah i guess uh well um 

45.06 48.03 B: [lipsmack] was stripes uh or 

46.83 51.31 A: strikes i think strikes like like the like 

48.29 49.43 B: strikes 

50.60 52.15 B: oh right 

51.32 52.68 A: strike you know 

52.48 59.55 B: right right um yeah i guess we're supposed to talk about uh and if they're getting too much money the players 

58.93 69.05 A: yeah yeah i think i mean what do you think i really don't i i don't know i think of course they make too much money but [sigh] you know it it creates a lot of revenue also 

69.23 77.65 B: you know what i think it really interesting is the uh the i- the idea of pairing complete strangers up and then having them automatically have a [laughter] conversation 

76.66 79.46 A: [laughter] oh yeah that is pretty ridiculous 

78.50 82.19 B: [laughter] it's oh so what do you think about some random topic 

81.44 88.38 A: i know but is it what is it it's a linguistics study so it probably doesn't matter at all what we're talking about right 

83.34 85.44 B: i think it's linguistics so it's 

86.23 92.58 B: what we're talking about but but it is some sort of focus so but so i guess we might as well indulge 

89.66 90.98 A: yeah 

91.93 96.22 A: it is nuts though like what the fuck this is not what i was expecting at all 

95.87 107.96 B: yeah i think i i think they it might even be a ruse in in the sense that they might tell you it's a linguistics just so you just talk normally and it it might something else you know like 'cause i i've done a lot of psychological experiments 

107.00 108.58 A: [mn] oh yeah 

107.99 109.54 B: and uh i 

110.07 124.49 B: some a lot of times they'll they might tell you one thing and if it's if there's no harm in it it might as well be like something else 'cause they don't they don't want it's like you know they don't you know what you're doing otherwise if it was they tell you it was linguistics then you might contrive the way you speak 

116.06 117.33 A: sure 

122.50 128.28 A: you might change the right change the way you talk exactly exactly 

124.73 132.15 B: or think about the way you talk i don't i don't know maybe they're just being straightforward it is about that so but um 

131.33 134.03 A: [mn] who i don't know i have no idea 

133.30 138.04 B: but uh as far as uh players are getting back to the topic at hand 

135.25 139.79 A: (( [laughter] um yeah i don't know )) 

139.24 150.07 B: um i guess uh my personal opinion uh is you know wha- whatever someone's willing to pay someone i guess i mean it is ridiculous how much players make but uh 

149.37 151.50 A: yeah could you hold on one second thanks 

150.31 151.32 B: sure 

173.52 175.57 B: (( [noise] )) 

175.59 176.35 A: hi 

175.97 176.74 B: hey 

176.38 177.69 A: sorry about that 

177.71 182.72 B: um but within the uh confines of a capitalistic society as our own 

177.77 178.56 A: uh 

181.07 184.17 A: [noise] [laughter] yeah 

182.89 188.02 B: one cannot be surprised that one making any amount there's no limits in capitalism right 

186.41 189.94 A: no of course not of course not 

188.46 194.54 B: and once we start talking about uh limiting stuff like that we might as well be a socialist state or 

193.55 199.59 A: so do you i mean are do are you baseball 'cause baseball's really what i'm thinking about here i mean all all sports 

197.44 201.47 B: no i don't i don't watch any sports at all really 

200.66 203.28 A: oh you don't [sigh] um 

202.79 205.09 B: why 'cause baseball players make a shitload 

204.38 216.01 A: they make so yeah and there's no salary cap in football and in basketball um you know they work under the confines of a cap a salary cap or limit as to how much they can spend and um 

212.34 213.15 B: (( really )) 

214.29 215.19 B: huh 

215.80 227.84 A: you know which makes it less of like a free capital a free capitalist market i guess in the sense that they can't um you know spend as freely as someone like george steinbrenner does for the yankees you know he spends 

220.38 221.43 B: right 

226.51 231.43 B: right is it only through a baseball player gonna make like a quarter of a billion dollars 

230.88 244.06 A: um well alex rodriguez got signed for i think two hu- uh how much does he get he gets he gets paid he got signed for a ten year contract for like twenty six million i think for each for each year 

235.34 236.43 B: two fifty 

244.29 248.39 A: i believe so he's made he's made twenty yeah he's making over twenty million dollars a year 

244.29 245.96 B: so two hundred 

248.07 249.18 B: wow 

248.62 258.51 A: yeah i mean which is ridiculous he's you know he the amount of money that he makes just you know out at that bat is out of control he makes like ten 

257.21 258.62 B: (( is he a good player )) 

258.35 268.83 A: well yeah he's like one of the best definitely i mean he's [sigh] but this another thing that i you know that i've seen is that no no team with the highest paid player has ever won a world series 

259.74 260.61 B: yeah 

268.32 269.51 B: right 

268.85 272.01 A: so you know who knows it doesn't necessarily help you 

272.29 274.38 B: wow that's interesting 

273.79 280.20 A: but the cap you know the cap is something in in major league baseball they tried to um to instate a 

279.97 290.09 A: a they call it a luxury tax because they're they're really trying to stay away from the cap probably for some of the reasons that you said you know they don't they wanted to main- you know to to seem like it's still a free open market 

281.58 282.43 B: right 

289.51 290.76 B: right 

290.38 291.54 A: um 

291.34 297.27 A: but you know it doesn't affect it it basically a certain if you spend a certain amount of money over 

297.05 309.64 A: over the limit um then you have to a pay tax on all the money you spend all the money after that point that you spend and it doesn't really you know the the teams with money will spend will spend money and they'll pay the tax so it doesn't really 

298.30 299.35 B: yeah 

302.07 303.17 B: (( i see )) 

306.67 307.82 B: yeah 

308.14 314.12 B: yeah doesn't really so so it's just basically like the rich teams can afford the good players and 

313.48 314.90 A: mhm 

314.14 326.19 B: and it's just it's actually just uh uh a replica of what goes on in society you know rich people can afford to do whatever they want and and deal with that and poor people can't even 

324.71 339.30 A: ye- ye- yeah well you know the rich people are definitely the rich definitely get richer but at the same time there are a lot of people and in the same you know in the same you know macrocosm a lo- you know there's a few teams in major league baseball who are 

329.55 330.42 B: yeah 

339.35 348.78 A: extremely poor but they they're thrifty and they make decisions they make decisions and think in a you know outside of the box they they take on different strategies 

348.31 349.26 B: like who 

349.14 361.28 A: well the oakland as there's a book published about the oakland as called money ball it's like a bestseller right now by um [lipsmack] i can't remember the guy he wrote liar's poker i think uh it's about you know another book about um stock market trading and things like that 

360.83 361.65 B: (( yeah mm )) 

361.20 364.97 A: he he wrote a book michael lewis is the name he wrote a book about um 

364.73 377.46 A: this guy the general manager of the as billy bean who came in and um basically totally revamped their entire philosophy on how they're gonna scout players who they're gonna sign what they're gonna look for in in players 

377.02 377.95 B: (( wow )) 

377.60 388.77 A: in you know and all this because he was confined to only spending about fifty million dollars a year which you know is is a lot but the yankees for example this year are spending a hundred and sixty million 

388.77 389.70 B: wow 

389.11 402.57 A: and these guys spend fifty to sixty million they have the lowest payroll in baseball constantly almost every year they and they've you know they've won they they've made the playoffs or come within five games of winning the playoffs the last three or four years 

401.75 402.72 B: wow 

402.63 408.66 A: so you know there are also people you know there are people i know who have no money but who 

408.44 418.34 A: or who had no money but who have made money you know they're you know they they find out ways to make money they find out ways to get ahead [lipsmack] and you know 

411.11 412.29 B: right 

418.66 424.13 A: so it's you know it's it's also a part of the free capitalist society you can people can do that 

422.13 423.09 B: yeah 

423.44 425.31 B: yeah i mean [mn] w- 

425.36 428.51 B: w- well what do the as look for i'm i'm curious to what what [noise] 

428.43 438.42 A: well it's more like what the other teams look for a lot of these other guys a lot of other teams you know the yankees is like the prime easiest target because they're you know like the free spending 

438.27 445.14 A: the epitome of like free spending teams they look for you know a lot of these teams look for um 

441.39 442.20 B: right 

445.25 455.31 A: look for athletes they look for guys with um what they you know like a baseball body these guys have like ridiculous bodies you know really muscular and strong 

455.33 457.26 A: and uh could you hold on one second thanks 

456.22 457.05 B: sure 

481.16 481.89 B: (( [noise] )) 

481.98 483.37 A: hello hey 

482.29 483.23 B: yep 

483.44 494.37 A: um so anyway these guy you know people on the as scout in different ways they um they look for different statistics for example on base percentages this new it's not a new statistic but it's 

494.52 496.53 A: a way of um you know 

496.76 505.27 A: b- i- i- it's kinda [mn] it's kinda hard to explain you should read this book it's a really interesting book but it's it's a whole different way of looking at baseball statistics and 

504.48 505.67 B: (( what do you do by the way )) 

505.61 511.22 A: what do i do i'm in editorial editorial work at the met

525.20 526.69 A: yeah 

525.57 539.62 B: and then they must be like kind of like you know making libraries of them or like what they're doing with them i've actually kind of you know in psychological experiments done that a bit where like you had to like store all these audio files and
