0.85 2.54 A: hi i'm mark 

2.29 3.74 B: i'm owen 

4.62 6.23 A: (( howdy owen how are you doing )) 

5.72 7.25 B: i'm pretty good how are you 

7.34 12.73 A: hanging in there hanging in there hanging in there um what part of what part of the country are you in 

9.66 10.93 B: all right 

12.46 14.41 B: los angeles california 

13.49 17.95 A: oh that's where i'm talking to you from as well yeah so 

15.40 16.40 B: oh really 

18.03 22.21 A: (( ah well what do you think about strikes )) 

22.00 24.48 B: well i i 

24.86 33.72 B: i think athletes are high enough paid you know as it is but then again if ownership is making all this money then i guess they deserve a cut of that too you know 

34.47 39.84 A: i well you're talking to somebody who feels quite similar i mean in the regards that 

39.81 52.50 A: you know athletes are getting a lot of money where school teachers could get more money a lot of people could get more money on the other hand ownership is the one making all this money and athletes have a right to share in the profits 

52.96 55.54 B: yeah yeah absolutely it 

55.69 62.92 B: i think they probably get yeah a bad rep you know the wrong side of the the p._r. stick with that but 

63.11 68.12 B: even so you know it's kind of hard to feel too bad for millionaires just asking for more money 

67.61 76.35 A: yeah um it's true i i i don't know ah are you a big baseball fan did you follow the last near strike pretty well 

75.95 78.67 B: yeah i'm a pretty big baseball fan yeah 

78.24 79.20 A: okay 

79.35 87.22 A: um yeah but at a certain point you know i'm generally i'm probably pro union things like that mind you 

87.21 94.86 A: you know if i go to the dodgers stadium i don't know if you're a dodgers fan i don't wanna you know have to pay five more bucks because you know 

94.89 103.27 A: you know brian jordan needs you know that much more money but on the other hand you know ownership really tried to 

103.72 107.81 A: make the players look bad you know and they want the public to turn on the players 

107.66 111.30 B: right well that that yeah exactly 

110.64 120.47 A: yeah so you know i don't i don't know what the answer is but i'm i don't ah i don't think it's i don't think going on strike is necessarily terrible 

120.64 131.97 B: no it's not a bad idea but like when the baseball strike happened in the mid nineties it took a few years for them to rebuild their fan base i don't know if it's even really still recovered yet 

131.34 134.37 A: i would completely and utterly agree 

133.98 140.59 B: so it seems like either way the players going on strike you know they're the ones that are are losing out 

140.73 142.20 B: one way or another 

142.58 143.91 A: yeah 

144.20 145.21 A: um 

145.88 148.67 A: let me ask you this question how do you feel about 

149.01 152.99 A: even though i'm probably pro player when it comes to striking 

153.11 158.48 A: ah how do you feel about guys who cross the picket line and are quote unquote scabs 

158.49 160.28 A: you know and then 

160.46 166.11 A: you know baseball players give them you know that they give them that negative treatment when they come and they play 

161.77 162.73 B: right 

166.49 172.33 A: you know they [laughter] basically shut 'em out and freeze 'em out how do you feel about that 

167.84 169.96 B: yeah 

172.15 173.94 B: well 

174.75 180.63 B: i i think that you know that probably happens in any any sort of industry anyway but 

182.23 193.40 B: i- it's kind of hard to say i mean i would probably if i were a baseball player myself i would probably feel the same way you know you're supposed to work together and all for one and then you got this guy crossing the line 

193.59 199.10 B: but even so you know maybe he's got some common sense and he's thinking well i make enough money as it is 

199.60 205.37 B: there's no need to you know it's going to be damaging to the game or whatever his thinking is on that 

205.37 217.62 A: yeah um 'cause that's a tough one you know that's a tougher tougher decision because i i feel the way you do to a certain extent about ah you know if somebody's going to cross the picket line well hell freeze them out you know because they're 

217.64 231.65 A: destroying the power of the union on the other hand when he drives a cab for a living and he just wants a shot to play baseball and i make two million dollars then it's kind of ridiculous when i'm you know screwing with his locker and doing things like that when he's 

219.09 220.02 B: right 

231.86 233.93 A: you know when he's up so 

233.14 242.38 B: oh you you meant like i see what you're saying i kind of misunderstood yeah that that's different someone who's just getting a shot then i'm all for them crossing the line 

242.04 247.87 A: yeah oh no i wasn't talking about you know active players who've decided to go back and play no i'm i was talking about the little guy 

248.18 251.61 A: who you know uses that as an opportunity 

248.48 257.41 B: yeah yeah oh in that case then definitely they should they should have every opportunity they get some guy's you know who's spent his entire career in the minors 

257.52 258.45 A: yeah 

257.75 262.61 B: that's his one shot in the big leagues and he should definitely take it 

262.03 276.05 A: yeah but a lot of baseball players actually or football players or whoever it is i mean it's documented it's not just like they're making stuff up i mean you know if you listen to sports i don't know if you're a dodger fan i've probably given away the fact that i am but like 

274.95 277.99 B: oh yeah i i can't help but follow them but 

277.20 287.53 A: okay well it's like vince gully was talking about there was some guy on the mets who was playing for the mets and he you know came up during you know in the nineties he was one of the few guys who 

287.61 290.62 A: who actually was able to hang around and make it 

290.75 301.65 A: and just the the lo- the treatment he got from other players etcetera and a couple of players would stand up for him in fact somebody it was amazing somebody who stood up it happened on the reds excuse me 

301.28 302.21 B: oh okay 

301.87 304.74 A: dion sanders actually stood up for somebody 

304.28 305.35 B: really 

304.68 319.17 A: and said we shouldn't be mistreating this guy 'cause he's just trying to feed his family but they were actually trying to force the guy off the team everybody on the team and um you know i think that's wrong because it's like well you've got a right to strike and you got a right to do whatever but 

312.23 313.18 B: [laughter] 

319.10 321.61 A: he's gotta he's just trying to make a living too you know 

321.75 327.11 B: yeah and because most of the small players they're pretty sad for a long time they 

327.28 333.33 B: it's not going to kill them to have someone coming in yeah it's hard to feel bad for them you 

334.07 338.17 B: know take their side of the about about 

339.05 342.33 B: holding you know and being angry at the the scabs 

343.00 348.12 A: yeah scabs that's the word i was looking for [laughter] i couldn't i couldn't think of it 

345.18 346.83 B: (( yeah scabs )) 

348.21 350.07 A: i couldn't think of it um 

350.42 356.49 A: is there ever a situation let me ask you this where you as a fan would like go on strike 

356.58 357.62 A: um 

357.81 370.84 A: [laughter] because right now i'm a dodger fan they're up for sale so they're not they're not making a trade for any orphans which they should be and i just feel like i'm wasting my time following them in any way shape or form and i feel like going on strike 

361.02 362.02 B: right 

371.02 376.05 B: well it seems like it seems like l._a.'s been striking against the dodgers for a while now 

375.85 377.15 A: [laughter] 

376.12 382.05 B: you know dodgers stadium every time i've been there it it i haven't seen a sellout in a long time i don't know 

380.98 385.03 A: oh no yo- you're right i mean i used to go before the strike 

384.69 385.88 B: right 

385.25 390.85 A: and yeah it has never recovered baseball has not recovered and here for sure it hasn't recovered 

390.52 401.30 B: yeah definitely but yeah if if the local team is not or in this case the dodgers if they're not yeah you have no reason to just have city loyalty i don't think i mean 

401.14 411.44 B: if you grew up you know cheer- you know rooting for them and all that i can see why you'd still hang on but it's tough when a team you know 

411.42 417.20 B: management or ownership they give up on it and then they just kind of let the franchise flounder around for a while 

416.99 420.90 A: yep yep no doubt about it 

421.54 432.02 A: um how would you you know what if you know okay say people are going on strike but what if like lebron james just has to go on strike 

431.76 433.93 B: [laughter] yeah 

432.81 439.35 A: you know it's like if the guy is making a million dollars a year is one thing what if the guy's making twenty million dollars a year 

439.86 446.12 B: that that's absolutely ridiculous i mean with him someone like that you know just a megastar 

439.89 440.80 A: you know 

446.44 453.11 B: what he's got something like an eighty a hundred million dollar shoe contract or something something ridiculous yeah if he's going on strike then 

449.45 450.59 A: oh i know 

453.21 456.11 B: i mean how could you possibly feel bad for him 

455.83 457.55 A: yeah 

456.42 459.24 B: or or or take his side of it 

458.94 460.93 A: yeah i know because it it's like 

460.86 466.82 A: yeah it's probably all it's all versus comparison because you know the owners are gouging the players 

466.76 477.19 A: you know even if the players are making a lot of money well the owners are worse you know and when it's lebron james or somebody who's really overpaid well you know they are overpaid but in the same way the owners are overpaid 

476.76 482.19 B: oh absolutely but you get the feeling also that the owners 

477.98 478.86 A: (( you know )) 

482.21 487.92 B: i think just in general it's kind of our thinking that the owners they have just so much to risk they're the ah 

489.07 495.67 B: you know they're they're the ones who are financially liable for the whole franchise and it's kind of i don't know um 

496.53 510.09 B: i guess there really doesn't seem to be much difference between someone who's who's making as much money as like shark and then whoever's owning the team and jerry busner you know it it it's still just enormous wealth one way or another 

509.76 510.87 A: yeah 

510.21 512.08 B: but it's hard to take sides 

512.26 516.46 A: and if it's such a money losing business how come so many people want to get into ownership 

516.56 525.48 B: yeah exactly i mean they don't go operate you know with the loss of revenue every year and then they'll just turn round and sell it a few years later and make a huge profit 

525.27 526.95 A: yeah 

525.52 528.63 B: seems to be the case with with every time 

528.28 537.07 A: exactly i mean when for example if baseball or whoever opens their books in front of congress do you trust their figures 

537.42 540.92 B: [laughter] i think they must have some outside accounting 

540.66 543.18 A: exactly because that's how i feel you know 

542.85 543.85 B: yeah 

543.20 543.94 A: if 

544.33 550.62 A: you know because you know if baseball says it's losing money i don't believe it if somebody from the outside says it's losing money i believe it 

549.89 552.81 B: exactly baseball 

553.00 564.92 B: it it's hard to imagine but then again you hear about just you know like alex rodriguez's salary and then you kind of see how how it's conceivable that they're just not making as much money 

565.01 566.25 A: yeah 

565.59 571.99 B: but i i just don't think the owners are are directly losing any sort of money i think somehow 

570.98 573.28 A: i i you know i feel the same way 

572.42 574.43 B: the corporation of the teams is 

576.25 584.34 A: yeah i know corporate deep pockets and you know it was different before i would i would agree when it was a you know singular owner even if it was enormous wealth 

584.85 592.81 A: um you know it was different you know the o'malley's sold the dodgers because they said they couldn't compete you know with the deep pockets and 

591.51 594.85 B: yeah it was just a family family franchise back then 

595.13 599.99 A: yeah you know so the dodgers lose you know a lot of money or the
