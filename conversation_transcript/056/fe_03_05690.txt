0.12 1.61 A: sean noling 

0.14 1.85 B: hey i'm ed worthy 

1.98 3.98 A: ed worthy sean how you doing 

3.71 5.01 B: (( all right how are you )) 

4.96 11.42 A: i'm pretty good um what is that the ah i didn't really get the whole question my phone is like breaking up here 

9.84 11.25 B: oh okay 

11.35 19.30 B: it's [mn] ah do we feel that any other country are threats to the u._s. right now and if so which countries and why 

19.52 23.79 A: which countries and why okay would you like to go first or should i go first 

21.02 22.92 B: (( mhm )) 

23.20 24.26 B: um 

24.06 28.70 B: well i didn't think i think it's funny 'cause when i looked this up on the website 

28.54 40.50 B: it said like these random things like you know talki- talking about pets or like these really innocuous sort of things and i think it's funny that suddenly they throw out this sort of political bombshell so i find it interesting 

39.28 41.66 A: mhm [laughter] 

40.55 46.14 B: ah but but yes go ahead man [laughter] go for it what ha- what have you got 

44.22 59.19 A: um well i don't know my my view on it is that ah every country is a threat to the united states just because of the way we politically hold ourself around the world you know as the ah supreme leader if we fall from that then ah pretty much the world falls into chaos i mean 

59.05 62.56 A: and everybody's out because everybody who has power wants more power 

62.43 64.02 B: that's true that's true 

62.78 71.48 A: and if you're a country i mean even even uh some of our greatest allies like britain i mean they really didn't want to join the war with us yet they did due to pressure from us 

71.39 77.55 B: yeah did you see the thing that's going on right now about the ah the about hussein buying uranium 

77.50 81.41 A: no i haven't i- is he buying it from africa or something or what 

78.47 79.40 B: oh 

79.93 89.59 B: yeah yeah yeah they they said that that that was a it was a it was a falsehood and and and bush's ah speech he gave to 

81.47 82.52 A: okay 

89.62 102.82 B: ah he gave in front of a crowd in cincinnati i don't know how long ago this was i think this was like in march and that was one of his big pushing points you know he said we have proof that hussein has tried to buy uranium so therefore he is a threat 

102.70 112.93 B: and then now british intelligence is saying then and this was he said in his speech according to british intelligence they're try to buy uranium now british intelligence 

112.70 119.80 B: in the last week they've come out and said and the the the head of the c._i._a. has gone under fire for letting this go 

119.66 123.02 B: but british intelligence is now saying that they were wrong 

122.88 129.15 B: and now bush the bush administration is saying that well see we weren't technically lying to you 

128.96 136.45 B: because we said it was according to british intelligence and although it was false from their perspective um we did say 

136.32 148.05 B: it may be a falsehood we're not sure about it now but we did say that it was according to them and so you know now four months later one of the huge selling points on the war turns out to be totally false 

148.12 153.29 A: yeah well you know most of the selling points are false they still haven't found any weapons of mass destruction 

153.23 155.47 B: yeah i can't i'm 

153.97 158.02 A: and if hussein was like any kind of smart guy i bet he hid 'em all [laughter] 

157.54 164.73 B: yeah you know i'm just surprised that they hid- they didn't even try to fake it you know they haven't quote un quote unearthed something 

164.78 177.44 A: well i think they have u._n. weapons inspectors there with the other inspectors i don't know but yeah i mean i think they let 'em in sort of like ah okay to the u._n. since they sort of pretty much threw a big fuck you in their face when they 

168.04 169.30 B: oh really 

169.68 171.44 B: okay so that that 

177.30 178.51 B: mhm 

177.79 180.12 A: started the war in the first place i mean 

179.43 187.98 B: right to to to everybody which [mn] which you know god is just it's like what wh- are we trying to 

188.39 191.68 B: it's it's basically i feel like ever since ah 

191.87 202.64 B: what was this i think in like september or something or it was maybe even a year ago when bush didn't sign the the the kyoto treaty for ah the ah to minimize global pollution 

202.50 203.51 A: mhm 

202.75 207.00 B: you know every industrialized nation signed that fucking thing except for the us 

206.69 215.24 A: yeah i know that's well th- the funny thing is is like the u._s. does that with a lot of stuff like we make laws but we don't follow our own laws and we make the rest of the world follow them 

207.23 208.05 B: and it's 

213.36 214.48 B: right 

216.18 226.01 B: yeah i mean i think that [mn] you know it's it's its strange because i i definitely think you're right about the threat to everyone else and it's weird because i feel like 

225.90 232.28 B: the only way to like really not have one country not be a threat to another 

232.46 233.66 B: is 

233.58 237.45 B: is in this weird way of financial globalization 

237.34 251.50 B: 'cause i don't think 'cause i think the only the only possible way i could envision a world where people aren't going after each other is if every country was as financially um dependent on each other 

251.80 266.15 B: as you know as as we try to screw every other country now but if they had a piece of the pie just as we had a piece of the pie and everybody had an equal share in it then no one would be able to afford to go to war with anyone else 

266.14 267.41 A: (( definitely )) 

266.14 272.69 B: and so it's the the disparity that that we have not and you know it's n- i i i can't see that even working because 

273.02 277.74 B: just in terms of the things that have already happened with like even trying to unite like 

277.83 292.71 B: hemispheres or like continents like you know the u._s. just is like a fucking greedy bastard and-and just takes takes everything and so it i don't know how that can work but god you know i just really wish there was some way to 

283.21 284.61 A: yeah we are 

292.69 303.31 A: well i think it's i think it's a bunch of things that's that's part of it but also ah the fact that most a lot of other countries in this world are still third world or don't have the technology that we have 

292.87 293.89 B: i don't know 

302.83 303.99 B: absolutely 

303.39 306.05 A: and ah we actually keep it from them 

305.96 308.35 B: yeah well that that 

306.40 310.43 A: now uranium is also used for like power plants 

310.59 311.51 B: yeah 

310.88 318.54 A: yet they don't tell that to the people when they're like babbling about these wars they're telling them that's for a bomb you know hussein might want power plants for his fucking third world country 

318.22 319.81 B: yeah 

318.84 321.72 A: you know damn i want electricity sorry 

322.36 326.79 B: yeah you know it's funny i went to ah south africa ah last summer 

322.79 323.74 A: (( so mm )) 

326.86 336.95 B: and um you know they're they were doing this whole big thing about the fact that um there were all these exposes going on 'cause the the president was getting a uh 

336.85 342.18 B: i think it was a seven million dollar jet so that he could fly 

342.16 351.17 B: himself personally in in a way that would be um appropriate and acceptable to places like the u._s. so he could meet with you know 

351.07 356.13 B: the presidents of of of all these industrialized nations basically all for show 

355.95 366.48 B: in this country where you know the poverty is absolutely ridiculous they're they're blowing five million dollars so their president can can can just put on a good show 

360.55 361.71 A: mhm 

366.32 376.78 B: for ah for other countries and say no look we're part of you we're one of you guys you know so give us your money and then they threw in like something like seventeen million dollars for ah 

370.92 371.99 A: mhm 

376.80 379.19 B: for their arms program 

379.36 384.77 B: for their for their military south africa under threat they're they're trying to say 

383.68 384.86 A: from who 

384.82 399.69 B: yeah [mn] from antarctica yeah you know i don't know it's like from like like what country could possibly i mean even th- the countries surrounding that area you know they're still they're still travelling on foot you know using submachine guns if they're lucky 

387.41 388.60 A: yeah 

400.26 411.67 B: you know they have this whole thing where a lot of the a lot of the countries down there buy get weapons from get like their guns from germany they get their bullets from france and the things don't even they're not even compatible 

411.88 413.06 A: yeah 

411.99 418.38 B: so like they they can't even they don't even have access to like really start any sort of military threat 

419.10 426.32 A: also i mean like like you're saying who's going to attack them i mean they're they're africa i see their their biggest resource is probably the diamonds and everything 

422.28 423.23 B: yeah 

426.12 435.27 A: [mn] but given the way u._s. businessmen work the u._s. is is already over there frigging like gutting their diamond mines so so so there's no point to like even attack them and [mn] if you do i mean 

430.80 432.90 B: absolutely absolutely 

435.06 444.42 A: slavery's abolished so you're not going to get anything there their land is pretty much a big wasteland and if it's not it's so wide and open that you just can't get anywhere i mean 

442.93 444.63 B: yeah 

445.41 447.68 A: might be good for factories [laughter] 

445.67 446.66 B: yeah 

447.68 455.62 B: y- yeah basically i mean what i think we're i think we're in ah nigeria right now trying to put in ah something like a 

455.94 466.04 B: i don't i don't know what it was like a fifty mile oil pipe there and it's going through so many towns and and villages that it's clearing out so many locals and they're 

465.88 478.93 B: they're touting it as you know this is going to be employment for all you people and that's great i think they said something like three thousand jobs they'll create but when they're doing that they're displacing like you know tens of thousands of people from their homes 

474.96 476.24 A: (( mm yeah )) 

479.14 490.29 A: it's like how much wildlife are you ruining how many people are you kicking out of their home how much rearranging has to be done for these three thousand people to get jobs who are going to be benefitting you so it d- it really doesn't matter if they're getting jobs 

490.05 493.57 B: right because basically it's coming to us right now 

492.47 497.14 A: yeah i mean it's ah it's going to the same source it doesn't matter who's working for it 

496.53 498.75 B: yeah where do you live 

497.44 498.38 A: i mean 

498.81 500.67 A: i actually live in manhattan 

500.48 502.50 B: oh really okay so you don't have a car 

502.45 503.71 A: (( no no )) 

503.16 509.85 B: okay yeah yeah me is i the biggest thing i think is the fact that this country is just car 

509.69 518.42 B: fricking crazy and one of the things that of the things i do like about new york is the fact that people are forced to use subways and buses so much 

510.66 511.97 A: oh well i go 

512.67 514.30 A: ahead 

518.34 525.09 A: yeah well i mean i came from california i just moved out here in january i do have a car but it's sitting back home in the garage but i mean 

521.43 522.51 B: oh really 

525.14 527.88 A: it's a big change i miss my car [laughter] 

527.25 535.68 B: yeah yeah no it's totally i mean i i i'm from ah detroit you know i'm from i'm from car car central originally and so you 

534.33 535.41 A: (( [laughter] )) 

535.44 546.72 B: know i definitely miss driving around 'cause there's so much freedom with your car there's so much you know it's suddenly you're by yourself you've got your music and you're going wherever you want to go or you're just driving around to clear your head 

546.10 547.47 A: exactly 

546.89 558.61 B: and i and i to- i i do miss that but it's just like oh my god i i feel like i almost think sometimes in manhattan cars personal cars should almost be abolished and everything should just be taxis 

558.62 565.04 A: in this city yeah i i think it should definitely be like that i mean there's so many dumbass drivers out there it's not even funny 

564.43 566.23 B: mhm 

565.03 571.76 A: you know what i mean it the subway can take you anywhere but they do need to fix it the work on this thing is pretty bad i mean 

571.21 572.40 B: yeah 

571.52 581.44 A: like they just raised the prices of everything yet it's always late it's still down on the weekend i mean you go to paris their subway's been around a hundred years longer and it's still fricking running fine 

575.64 576.83 B: [laughter] 

581.21 582.94 B: yeah that's true 

581.77 589.26 A: they don't have down times they don't have like off times they don't have times when they're repairing it it just works all the time you know 

587.34 593.20 B: yeah ye- yeah london's got a great ah subway system as well you know it's 

593.40 595.49 B: it's it's like they ah 

595.66 599.89 B: i don't know what they're doing here it's like they don't almost don't want it to work they want
