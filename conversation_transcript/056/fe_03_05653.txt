0.19 1.67 A: hi i'm morgan 

1.37 7.94 B: hi i'm wilson ah did you hear the topic clearly because i haven't heard it clearly 

3.53 4.33 A: hi 

7.92 9.95 A: yes i heard the topic clearly 

9.75 12.95 B: yeah can you tell me what it is please 

12.93 18.14 A: does airport security increase the safety of flying 

18.29 20.12 B: oh okay 

20.35 22.08 B: (( yeah ah )) 

22.18 24.97 B: so what do you think about that yourself 

25.14 27.56 A: i think it definitely does i mean ah 

27.57 40.58 A: people are checked more often people are given a more thorough check of what they have with them so of course they're going to it's going to increase security at least it increases my peace of mind 

40.09 43.52 B: it does increase your your peace of mind 

43.03 44.00 A: yes 

43.90 44.97 B: well 

45.30 49.37 B: (( for me i don't know i'm kind of a little bit ah )) 

50.32 55.53 B: how would you say mixed about it because i think in the 

53.29 54.37 A: (( mhm )) 

55.37 67.39 B: mean- in the meantime i think usually like you know you with a lot you know a lot more time too do you think they need to check it as 

67.22 75.89 B: hard as they try you know as they did or they could have done a better job without going to 

75.99 80.16 B: you know at the end at the extreme that they did 

79.80 83.20 A: well i think it's it's it's a mental deterrent right now 

82.94 83.88 B: mhm 

83.26 91.93 A: the way it works right now is that anyone that even has an idea will think twice before they even try to get on a plane 

89.31 90.56 B: mhm 

91.87 93.53 B: mhm 

92.04 101.67 A: because they're not sure whether they're going to be called to the side to check for their bags even if they have ah c. two which is plastic that you can't see 

101.97 107.15 A: you know they're going to be more reluctant to try to get on the plane 

101.98 102.74 B: (( mm )) 

107.82 121.59 B: so what do you think well the thing is if it increases like the security in the airport but what about in the plane itself do you think like all these 

121.49 133.55 B: security that they do at the airport that they do do you think the plane is the same way 'cause they have people standing around people they can trust and you know 

133.63 141.76 A: well i think the place i mean as as long as it's it's twofold as long as the passenger feels that they're safer 

141.10 142.96 B: mhm 

141.93 145.79 A: and as long as the culprit 

145.92 148.54 A: thinks that he is not safe 

148.63 149.84 B: mhm 

149.83 155.27 A: it eliminates a percentage of the possibility for something bad happening 

155.66 156.56 B: yeah 

155.83 163.97 A: it's not necessarily because the security's tight that it's going to prevent it but it's also the psychological aspect of it 

162.74 175.37 B: mm well i'm sorry i i ask you all these questions because it wasn't long ago you know like ah last month i travelled you know internationally 

171.66 172.47 A: (( [noise] )) 

175.61 188.41 B: and you know to see like i've been at the airport it was about three hours that we were checking and even though you have nothing in your 

188.17 201.11 B: suitcases they open that you know and you know tear away everything you have and then after that they didn't even take the time to put the things together 

200.96 202.16 A: well you know 

202.08 203.25 B: mhm 

202.70 204.88 A: [cough] i travel a lot also 

204.60 205.88 B: mhm 

205.44 213.70 A: so i feel that it's it's a minor inconvenience for me given the possibilities of what could happen 

210.25 211.34 B: (( hm )) 

214.74 218.76 A: for me i'd rather i'd rather be safe than sorry 

220.16 221.07 A: you know 

222.21 223.79 B: yeah mhm 

222.25 228.87 A: i mean it's it's an inconvenience it's it's a slight inconvenience but it is not an inconvenience that that will 

229.55 232.10 A: deter anyone from flying 

231.84 232.80 B: mhm 

232.19 233.15 A: you know 

233.31 239.29 A: um we have enough problems in the world we have sars we have all these things that we have to deal with 

239.67 240.75 A: um 

240.82 244.43 A: and a little added security is not going to kill anybody 

244.74 245.73 B: do you 

244.88 249.89 A: basically basically it might save people i mean we haven't had the first case where 

250.08 257.38 A: where the added security has actually said we've avoided a situation where someone could hijack a plane 

257.12 258.04 B: (( no )) 

258.11 260.92 A: but again psychologically 

261.53 262.75 A: it works 

263.71 278.44 B: oh i i think yeah as you said because you know it's a matter of opinion anyway you know a lot of people would say it doesn't make it safer like i said myself i have a little you know mix 

263.83 265.20 A: for me at least 

278.88 285.97 B: you know like feelings about it but if i told you i don't like the 

286.64 294.12 B: you know if i told you i don't like the ah the um attention they put on it like you know like 

293.95 307.91 B: people like you said will take prize before they probably trying to work out something sneakier and taking them more time and in that case that would probably help people like you 

302.74 303.73 A: yes 

308.02 314.17 B: know no matter how smart you think you are if you think they are going to check you or not they take did you 

314.25 321.12 B: by the way did you travel domestically or internationally did you do you did both 

319.01 319.98 A: both 

321.15 322.14 A: both yes 

322.03 330.53 B: yeah so the point is there are some places that you go and i think they are probably i don't know you know i haven't been travelled 

330.56 332.37 B: too many places 

332.20 333.74 A: where were you travelling to 

333.97 338.79 B: well i travelled from you know from miami to haiti so 

338.79 339.52 A: yes 

339.12 349.81 B: and then you know i travelled from you know here to from florida to new york and things like that so i haven't gone a lot of places like 

349.63 359.96 B: you know in l._a. or whatever where you know every time you hear there might be something might have happened you know if it wasn't for 

360.00 363.14 B: a discovery or whatever so 

363.25 377.25 B: the the thing is like i said i i did not travel so much and don't you think like by doing that security don't you think it makes people travel more or less than they would have now 

377.22 381.12 A: oh i definitely think that people are more reluctant to take 

380.98 381.78 B: mhm 

381.19 390.09 A: international flights right now because of this because you're you're looking at the international flights or flight 

391.69 399.74 A: from one from the east coast to the west coast those are the most dangerous flights in the sense that they have more jet fuel 

394.35 395.59 B: mhm 

399.88 404.95 A: create the greater amount of damage a short flight even from miami to new york you know 

404.04 405.29 B: mhm 

405.24 408.74 A: um but we're looking at a situation where 

408.83 419.58 A: people are very scared still to fly i think ah i think maybe twenty thirty per cent of ah people who should fly don't fly because of the situation 

419.37 421.29 B: (( mhm )) 

420.55 425.71 A: which is that good i don't think that we should be scared of flying i think we should be more 

422.49 423.38 B: yeah 

426.65 430.58 A: frightened of driving across a bridge because now you look at 

430.69 434.22 A: how lax the security is across a bridge 

433.96 435.38 B: mhm 

435.00 435.89 A: you know 

435.64 436.69 B: oh 

436.08 445.55 A: i travel all the time to new york city i live in new jersey and i see many opportunities for people to drive a truck full of bombs or a car 

438.96 440.07 B: mhm 

445.45 447.25 B: oh right yeah 

446.37 448.44 A: much more so than a plane 

449.14 456.98 B: yeah not long ago i was in new york you know going to new jersey i travelled you know i ah 

457.07 462.52 B: crossed like i did lincoln tunnel you know to go to new york 

460.92 461.62 A: (( yes )) 

463.68 464.69 B: and 

465.15 470.51 B: like i said i am kind of i don't know sometimes you can not just think 

471.14 480.67 B: to think about all these situations you know what could happen like the people like the other day i was talking to my wife like you know 

480.74 488.86 B: how do you think these people feel like people were very happy they were coming home from vacation or they were you know 

488.87 499.43 B: going some place to meet somebody or in a business or whatever they were going to close a good deal and whatever and then here they are like you know they 

499.49 502.51 B: they you know they boarded the plane 

502.81 504.95 B: and these things happened 

505.08 506.14 B: (( so )) 

506.37 513.53 B: like you said you know like i think people psychologically people might feel a little bit more 

514.11 517.52 B: you know they they feel a little bit more secure 

515.43 516.32 A: right 

517.59 518.95 B: by 

519.16 521.31 B: you know flying now 

521.38 532.58 B: but for me like i said i am still very sceptical about it because the plane i'm still worrying about the plane which is you know the main factor because 

532.17 533.32 A: right 

532.62 536.81 B: the things that happened they didn't happen in the 

537.36 545.41 B: you know in the airport per se so how do you know if these people didn't have any like you know some 

540.07 540.82 A: right 

545.50 554.00 B: people that tried to do things with them like who are taking care of the plane how do you trust people you know you watch movie 

553.84 566.80 B: like where like security like you know bodyguards or whatever like you know get money from people and these people they don't get paid very well you can see what i say 

566.59 576.35 A: yeah no i understand exactly what you say but you know one of the things that we do i don't i don't feel uncomfortable going through all the security that we do 

570.39 571.14 B: (( mm )) 

576.15 577.02 B: mhm 

576.38 580.58 A: because it makes us feel a little bit safer 

580.73 581.78 B: (( i don't )) 

580.89 586.67 A: an extra half hour an extra forty minutes going through security at an airport it's okay 

586.71 596.59 B: i don't mind it either yeah i don't mind it because like i said if i'm travelling i usually i leave early and then i always 

596.77 599.89 B: put you know the day whatever i
