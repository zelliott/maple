97.57 100.58 B: you know i mean obviously they're earning more money 

100.26 103.07 A: (( they they they need more money then they go on strike )) 

103.20 107.18 B: um i mean one of the main arguments behind it is is going to be 

107.47 109.94 B: you know when they when they go on strike 

109.84 110.77 A: mhm 

109.97 114.32 B: do the fans you know of the game whether it's

140.75 141.93 A: (( right )) 

140.80 153.53 B: and you know people people left the game for a little while and they said it wasn't until you know like basically like the mcguire thing came that like you know people really got back into the game um 

144.45 145.38 A: mhm 

152.15 153.07 A: mhm 

153.38 157.22 B: and you know a a lot of the things that you hear are from

163.36 167.10 B: yeah yeah absolutely 

166.49 169.34 A: they they they found it boring

286.38 287.47 A: (( baseball )) 

286.78 291.15 B: that's why we're both sitting here making calls right now huh [laughter] 

289.59 292.13 A: yeah isn't like baseball 

291.71 300.21 B: well i mean like the the guys the guys who are you know on on the bottom rung of baseball you know the third stream the third 

292.54 293.71 A: (( doesn't pay very good )) 

300.98 304.79 B: stream guys that are on the team that are making the league minimum 

304.58 305.74 A: mhm 

305.02 312.68 B: you know tho- those are the guys who are actually the people that are affected by you know salaries you know it's not that they are cheaters um 

310.37 311.11 A: mhm 

311.84 312.86 A: mhm 

312.80 325.02 B: you know if wants more money then you know he can go to george simon and renegotiate his contract he could do that but you know that guy's making enough money where it probably doesn't affect him um 

318.06 319.51 A: (( mhm could )) 

323.93 325.19 A: yeah 

325.15 331.56 B: the guys who you know i- in theory who conceivably would want to strike are the people who are making the league minimums 

331.29 332.22 A: right 

331.68 339.14 B: and you know and their argument right now is if league minimums are enough to you know sustain a person 

339.55 340.34 B: (( you know )) 

340.52 349.71 B: to make a comfortable living um right now league minimums are and these guys you know the league minimum is going to be like you know three four hundred thousand dollars 

349.52 351.06 A: yeah of course 

351.12 356.01 B: um and you know what if if i was sitting around next to a guy who was making twenty million a year 

357.82 359.07 B: may not be 

359.44 362.53 B: good enough or whatever 

361.88 363.77 A: tra- they're traded in 

363.73 367.03 B: yeah you know what like be better be a better player 

366.58 367.97 A: yeah 

367.53 379.30 B: they're the good team i mean like guy- guys out in toronto can try because they're not playing on the yankees who you know the lowest paid lowest paid yankee players get minimum of six million a year 

373.38 374.24 A: true 

379.05 380.54 A: mhm 

380.09 382.98 B: but you know that that's the way it ru- it works 

384.21 386.66 A: mhm that's right 

386.83 390.54 A: (( that's how that's how the sports go right )) 

390.61 393.08 B: th- that's the way baseball is i mean 

393.06 395.51 A: (( baseball hockey all sports )) 

396.04 398.04 B: i mean a lot of times when ah 

397.98 399.62 A: what's you favorite sport 

400.00 408.92 B: my favorite sport i mean like sports depend in a lot of way like i i played baseball for years played soccer for years i played hockey for years i 

408.04 411.90 A: (( what what's your what's your what's your favorite out of all of them )) 

412.59 416.32 B: i i think football's great to watch with your buddies 

416.28 429.88 B: ah you know especially monday night when football rolls around like football can be a very social thing and you go to baseball games i think it's you know a better time um hockey i never see it much um other sports 

429.73 432.52 B: i don't follow as well so 

431.32 432.88 A: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

433.01 440.12 B: you know i mean when i was living in chicago the bulls were doing really well and that was great i could really follow that 

436.87 438.29 A: (( yeah )) 

438.97 442.87 A: (( yeah )) 

442.64 446.16 B: (( yeah it's really yeah i mean i- it definitely matters )) 

442.89 443.58 A: th- 

445.50 453.58 A: th- and and and they're trying to get out there and and they're winning i mean they're trying they're trying very hard they they gotta they they 

453.75 458.81 A: some guys they hit home runs you know you guys hit pretty good home runs 

458.94 461.04 B: yeah absolutely i mean like 

461.10 470.89 B: teams are very cyclical like you know sometimes a team is doing very well and other years it's not um but i i think that's one of the arguments like you know 

470.66 471.52 A: mhm 

470.89 483.35 B: if if it's you know if you look at a team you know that's only natural talent like you know some years one team can be better than another and that that's why you have certain teams in the world series who 

481.40 482.50 A: (( look at )) 

482.96 484.07 A: the eagles 

484.51 490.02 B: the eagles the eagles are doing very well like last year they they were very good but i 

488.90 491.42 A: they near as damn as won in fact 

491.63 496.06 B: i mean i i think all the arguments is like you know especially like living in new york right now 

496.05 507.11 B: you know wi- with a team like the yankees as as an example they definitely do buy buy their teams hands down they buy talent they spend more money than anybody else 

502.26 503.40 A: mhm 

507.52 519.32 B: and when a team has that much money to spend i think other teams look at it you know as definite disadvantage which is why they potentially go on you know some sort of strike aspect or strike 

520.01 521.15 B: is where 

521.22 532.92 B: you know you try to even the playing field and maybe that that's why they're initially trying to do it to go after the strike um and unfortunately like i don't know if that's the way they go about it like i don't know 

532.94 534.97 B: and the other thing is 

535.16 540.49 B: the way the fans look at it you know if you're a yankee fan or if you're a toronto fan it doesn't really matter like 

540.52 550.39 B: if a team you know especially the public's persona where you where you think you know players make a shitload of money you know and especially compared with 

550.46 552.54 B: the common common man 

552.77 553.62 A: right 

552.83 561.27 B: they make a lot more money and if these guys are saying this money's not good enough and you know baseball is america's sport and these guys say this isn't good enough 

559.06 559.97 A: yeah 

561.13 572.90 B: well screw them i can find something better you know i i'll go watch wrestling i'll go watch women's football you know it doesn't matter like like these strikes can only really 

568.47 569.28 A: (( no )) 

572.75 573.66 A: (( of )) 

572.87 577.14 B: hurt hurt the game maybe it'll help the players 

577.02 577.82 A: course 

577.91 580.57 B: but you know that 

578.63 583.43 A: in the long in the long in the long run maybe they they um they get as 

583.49 585.26 A: (( you get as you )) 

585.45 587.30 A: get learn by their mistakes 

587.38 588.50 A: (( know what i )) 

587.88 596.76 B: you know an- and i think eventually that you know their contract in baseball is coming up for renegotiation and you know they came to a deal 

595.80 599.15 A: (( mean wh- wh- what do you think about that one where the fellow took ))
