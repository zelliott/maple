0.52 3.17 A: hi my name's ted fernandez 

2.58 5.15 B: hi hi my name is ah mark wallenburg 

4.89 13.39 A: oh okay very good and um i got the question as do you think airsu- airport security will protect us against terrorism is that correct 

13.16 15.62 B: yeah basically something to that effect like does the 

15.61 28.82 B: heightened [noise] airport security you know reduce the chances of ah terrorism [noise] and ah i know quickly my initial opinion on that is yeah it reduces it but i don't think it ah eliminates it 

26.43 27.53 A: (( mhm )) 

28.44 34.80 A: oh i totally agree i mean it it actually reduces the marginal probabilities of terrorism 

34.57 48.01 A: you know um but i think it's only part of the solution i mean my approach would be would be for example to change our foreign policy and and ah you know do a lot of other things [laughter] 

38.00 38.71 B: (( [noise] )) 

47.12 52.05 B: oh exactly yeah i mean that's going to reduce the you know overall 

52.19 60.43 B: [sigh] not just terrorism threat but you know the root of the issues against ah against the united states 

59.96 61.97 A: oh i totally agree 

61.69 65.30 B: now ah going back to like the actual issue about 

65.36 70.68 B: you know airplane terrorism people hijacking planes and what not ah 

71.00 79.10 B: i think you know the the security across all the passengers go through that's just one aspect that's probably the most visible aspect but there's so many other 

76.06 77.30 A: mhm 

79.10 82.02 B: you know aspects or other ways people can 

80.50 82.01 A: mhm 

81.88 96.13 B: get around security ah there are just so many gaps still in the system yes it's a whole lot tighter than it was two years ago but ah i think it could still be a lot more ah stringent but 

89.35 90.61 A: mhm 

94.45 97.08 A: yeah go go on i'm sorry 

96.69 105.27 B: but at the same time you know i don't think unless you're going to you know be come into a complete police state you're never going to get it perfect 

104.99 115.52 A: oh i agree i mean we don't have to go as far as el al where they not only check your luggage thoroughly but they seem to if i'm not incorrect interview each passenger 

115.35 116.48 B: right 

115.52 118.02 A: or profile each passenger 

117.88 130.92 A: um but i mean it takes like maybe several more hours before you could board an el al flight than say a ah american airlines flight i mean el al is pretty good and they even have security around the airplane 

130.75 144.56 A: i mean i would go as far to say it's not just checking the passengers on a random basis which you know random probabilities sorry probability sampling's useful for like okay every tenth person 

132.54 139.16 B: (( right )) 

144.38 152.89 A: um we'll we'll screen them thoroughly you know as- aside from having everyone going through a metal detector we'll have every tenth person 

152.65 162.36 A: you know open up their luggage show i._d. do a thorough check you know no no body cavity checks but you know frisking that's fine but that's 

159.62 160.93 B: (( [noise] right )) 

162.20 175.89 A: you need also to have a very secure airport and yes it would become more of a nuisance for the employees such as the airline pilots and stuff like that but i think that that's also part of airline security 

175.78 178.13 A: you know and um 

178.17 188.57 A: at the same time um [cough] you know i don't go for this profiling of passengers and having these lists of passengers that could be kind of dangerous it 

188.50 189.72 B: [noise] oh yeah 

188.53 193.30 A: but but if you're going to have a known terrorist yeah you should be looking out for them 

192.97 198.03 B: right the problem i think sorry i i don't mean to be cutting you off but ah 

193.35 194.38 A: but um 

196.37 197.39 A: that's fine 

198.03 208.64 B: just ah yeah i definitely agree with everything you've been saying but then if you compare for example to like el al yeah sure their security is so much stricter but at the same time they're basically a government 

208.42 222.02 B: run airline for the most part they get government subsidies and i i think if you know ah a car- an air carrier here in the u._s. had to follow the same sort of security procedures we would either be 

212.09 214.25 A: yeah government subsidies yes 

221.79 224.94 B: all paying you know much higher 

224.75 229.30 B: um airplane ticket costs and much fewer people would be flying 

228.73 229.75 A: yeah 

229.08 243.78 B: ah you know the trade off okay more people are going to be driving and you're going to have more accidents on the road more people will probably die on the road because less people are flying than if there was a terrorist incident so it's sort of a perverse thinking but 

243.74 247.41 B: ah you know it's it's it's a hard thing to try and figure out 

247.04 255.41 A: yeah i i i we could do something like what el al does without having to go for the total enumeration of the flight 

254.16 255.15 B: right 

255.39 268.18 A: passenger sorry the passengers on the flights but we could you know aside from the metal detectors for everybody and ah random selection of those who we are going to interview and ah check their luggage 

268.00 282.33 A: um it you could do that and nationalize that i mean it's it's apparent that the airlines have failed they have i mean yes the u._s. intelligence apparatus has failed or had been allowed to fail so to speak 

271.97 273.09 B: right 

282.16 285.44 A: um but ignoring that if 

285.60 293.95 A: the i mean looking at the airlines they have failed largely with security i mean look we go back to the early seventies when there was a hijacking where the 

293.93 300.32 A: the hijackers threatened to fly an airplane into a into a georgia nuclear power plant 

300.01 301.88 B: oh i wasn't aware of that 

300.29 307.84 A: that's what that's what ushered into um the air marshal programme and the metal detectors and everything 

304.55 305.57 B: mhm 

305.70 306.78 B: right 

307.62 315.19 A: and i mean you know there there've been threats like that you know but not so much in america since then but certainly 

315.04 324.63 A: we could you know the t._s._a. the what is it the transportation safety administration that's a good start in terms of nationalizing some of the security 

319.69 321.33 B: right 

324.82 329.63 A: problems because i don't think just because it's private doesn't mean it's better um 

328.79 330.04 B: right 

329.51 342.07 A: but by the same token you know i don't want to pay more taxes because i mean let's look at what we're paying taxes for we're we're paying taxes to in my opinion to subsidize extremely wealthy 

341.86 349.22 A: um so they can maintain their their their privileged status but if you were to reshuffle you know somehow 

344.51 345.99 B: that's right 

349.26 359.69 A: i think we could have the security without having the brain scans at the airport and the you know and the right intrusive security measures um i think i think it's possible without 

359.66 365.96 A: jacking up the flights you know by a hundred dollars or even by fifty dollars i mean i really think it's possible 

363.94 365.10 B: mhm 

365.48 369.58 B: i think also the it's important actually that the security is 

369.39 383.31 B: effective security as opposed to security for show i mean you know the past year we've had all these stories about you know ninety year old grandmothers being searched and like this is all security we search every tenth person or whatever we we have completely random searches 

371.36 374.35 A: mhm 

383.14 396.89 B: ah you know make the security more effective and less for show for example they have you flown internationally like recently um well they ask on american carriers when you fly internationally they ask you ah are 

390.19 392.35 A: not recently not no 

396.71 410.02 B: you coming back to the u._s. they ask you questions you know sort of where have you been or whatever but the people asking the questions they are not like trained like el al people that you can you know you can fluff your way right through the questions they really don't 

398.11 399.20 A: mhm 

399.91 401.02 A: yeah 

408.30 409.12 A: (( mm )) 

410.21 423.63 B: it's a you know pointless questions it used to be like sort of like you know you could always answer no no and yes and then you'd be fine ah so and i think that you know the perfect example was that ah the shoe bomber he he i 

416.82 417.79 A: (( oh )) 

422.87 424.27 A: oh yeah 

423.67 427.97 B: mean he went through those questions the the first time 

425.05 425.61 A: (( [cough] )) 

427.74 439.76 B: and i think maybe he didn't get passed or whatever or it turned no i think he eventually got passed through the questions but then he was like late checking in so he didn't make the flight the the first day and then the second day he went through them again [laughter] 

439.33 440.18 A: (( mm )) 

439.99 442.42 B: so i wouldn't call that you know 

442.69 444.97 B: highly effective but 

443.83 454.07 A: yeah but i mean they we need to get the t._s._a. people we need to get more of them and we and i don't know i assume that the programme is just starting but and we need to have 'em well trained 

453.82 454.70 B: yes 

454.02 464.40 A: um yes it will be more inconveniencing for the passenger and i'm willing to suffer the inconvenience as long as my civil liberties aren't violated and um 

462.76 463.68 B: mhm 

464.17 476.41 A: and i think it's possible we could it could be done if there's the will but the problem is the airlines have such a presence because they're so scared of of discouraging um people from flying because of some minor inconveniences 

476.17 481.91 A: um that's the problem we we we have a f._a._a. that's designed to protect to 

481.90 483.34 B: (( airlines right )) 

482.62 495.26 A: promote the airlines excuse me promote the airlines but at the same time regulate them and that's a problem we need if we could get past that joke i'm not saying necessarily nationalize the airlines 

495.10 507.63 A: ah 'cause that that's another kettle of fish that has its own problems but there's got to be some way if maybe some subsidy or something in addition to nationalizing the security aspect that um 

508.23 517.44 A: that this could be done because el al is a private airline that gets a heavy subsidy from the israeli government and has israeli government security 

513.73 514.78 B: right 

517.20 524.34 A: the el al model of watered down version but one that's not made ineffective i think is possible but 

518.66 519.95 B: (( that's )) 

525.20 533.81 A: yeah there's going to be some loss in in in number of flights and some loss in profitability but maybe there has to be um 

533.96 539.27 A: but also we need an intelligence apparatus that's not going to stand down and we need 

538.39 542.77 B: what we were talking about in the beginning of the conversation you know it's not just you know that 

540.87 542.63 A: yeah 

542.89 548.06 B: far ah region why we need you know stricter 

548.15 549.88 B: airport security 

549.26 554.40 A: yes i mean it's a whole it's not just air support it's a part of us a a 

554.32 566.40 A: very imperialistic global policy um it's part of an intelligence apparatus that that you know through the echelon system they randomly select our telephone calls to scan for key words um 

566.19 572.77 A: but that's kind of misused because obviously that failed to catch any of the hijackers and then it's also a fact u._s. 

570.22 571.20 B: yes 

572.87 578.99 A: news and world report reported two of the hijackers alleged hijackers were trained at pensacola air naval 

578.94 588.19 A: ah base and one of those another one of the hijackers had foreign language training from the u._s. military so you know that's kind of it's kind of crazy so we need to 

588.17 598.85 A: also airport security is not doesn't begin at the airport and it doesn't begin with a national i._d. card or anything it really you have to look at the whole 

592.81 594.15 B: of course not 

599.17 599.92 A: (( u._s. gov ))
