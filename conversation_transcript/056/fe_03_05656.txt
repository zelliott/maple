60.11 60.96 B: right 

69.88 79.91 A: think about it right and so and you know i would who gives a fuck it was like riding the bus but honestly since nine eleven ah they really bust your balls like um it's a little bit harder 

78.53 80.32 B: yeah they do and 

79.83 87.05 A: but honestly if i wanted to blow up an airport or you know really fuck some people up at a airport i could pull it off you know 

84.37 86.16 B: you could you could do it 

86.26 87.46 B: there's no question 

87.09 88.64 A: yeah there's no question 

88.17 92.09 B: i mean i do and i just do this for fun in fact 

90.46 91.38 A: mhm 

92.62 96.76 B: one time this happened this is after this happened after nine eleven um 

95.61 96.34 A: right 

97.35 111.18 B: i was in new i was coming back from providence rhode island and i went through security i had my cell phone and they said turn it on i turned it on and then i went to the gate and they said there's fog and the plane's not going to leave for an hour 

100.60 101.77 A: mhm 

111.17 115.99 B: so i said cool and i walked back out i was with this other guy and we stopped at the bar and we were having a drink 

115.40 116.21 A: (( okay mhm )) 

116.57 123.44 B: and like ten minutes later they said now boarding flight whatever and i said so the guy says is that your flight 

123.61 125.14 B: was that our flight and i said 

125.13 127.32 B: they can't do that it's like a school closing 

127.14 140.89 B: once they tell you it's done they can't like i could have gone outside bottom line is like five minutes later they said final boarding call for and there were three passengers so we threw down our money in the bar and we and i started running back to the to the small airport 

130.32 131.37 A: right 

134.26 136.45 A: (( oh )) 

136.96 137.72 A: (( ahah )) 

140.68 153.88 B: and there was an old lady standing at the at the ah baggage thing and i had my cell phone in my hand and she said would you turn that on for me please and i was running and i went no i don't have time 

145.00 146.18 A: mhm 

152.93 154.38 A: mhm 

153.98 157.52 B: and i'm running through the airport expecting to be tackled at any second 

156.97 158.22 A: right 

157.59 159.14 B: and nobody stopped me 

158.67 160.08 A: (( nobody stopped you )) 

159.57 163.37 B: (( no and you know if i'm a terrorist i'm a terrorist )) 

161.78 162.65 A: right 

162.94 164.02 A: right 

163.41 164.48 B: um 

164.50 165.99 B: one time and this is 

164.52 171.68 A: there's nothing you can really do um you know this country is just a little weird i know that for example like let's say in places like israel 

171.75 183.05 A: um now in america when you go into a store or something you check your bag right like let's say you go into a store or something you know you're in a mall shopping they'll okay check your bag when as soon as you walk in 

182.95 191.79 A: in ah israel it's kind of fucked up what they'll do is they'll be like you can come in with whatever but on your way out they're like let me check your bag 

192.20 207.19 A: it's a little bit you know what i'm saying it's a little bit i don't know um it's a little bit different and and and if you think about it it does kind of make sense like on the way out hey maybe you're fucking robbing them maybe you left like a fucking pipe bomb i watched you come in here what you came in 

197.38 198.49 B: (( oh sure )) 

207.22 211.91 A: and you know i'm keeping my eye on you and that kind of like um 

212.13 227.13 A: you know it's just a different mentality and stuff like that see this stuff they deal with all the time and a lot of things people don't realize like you hear about all these you know explosions and you know death and stuff like that in ah israel you got to understand like israel is like the size of new jersey is bigger than israel 

215.99 217.21 B: (( oh sure )) 

225.75 228.31 B: exactly the size of new jersey absolutely 

227.37 236.87 A: exactly it's about the same size so i mean like it's like man the only way i can describe it is if you times when you hear about people dying and if you times it by fifty 

237.01 244.62 A: and think about the impact that would have on this country how people would feel about that so like let's say twenty people die if if it's a hundred people dying like 

237.33 238.10 B: right 

244.93 248.68 A: in this country like we'd be fucking freaked out so um 

248.70 257.52 A: the airport security um you know it it definitely it definitely is a lot better than what it used to be but ah on the other hand um 

257.82 262.84 A: ah there is only so much you can do and honestly it got a little laxed 

262.62 263.71 B: oh yeah it did 

262.96 270.45 A: right afterwards like yeah they were busting your balls they wanted questions answers everything that but once again now it's getting a little relaxed again 

269.70 276.26 B: well sure because it's you know basically it's a shitty job and i'm sure they are still paying people eight bucks an hour and 

271.39 272.25 A: right 

274.70 277.63 A: right and you get what you pay for right 

276.99 291.78 B: exactly right and and you know people lose interest i had a i had a i was flying somewhere just for fun i was with my wife my wife showed her identification and i show we checked her bags outside and i'm talking to this dude and i i started talking about the sixes and 

280.03 280.94 A: (( exact )) 

292.21 305.98 B: we we just talked you know for like ten minutes and he never asked me for my my i._d. and i'm thinking you know i start a company like compliance of america where people are doing their jobs and are just fucking it up and not doing it what they're supposed to do 

297.32 299.05 A: (( hm )) 

304.38 305.24 A: right 

305.99 310.31 B: um and i've read it and i'm not blowing up anything but how does he know 

308.91 309.74 A: right 

310.05 311.91 A: exactly 

311.34 314.02 B: you know has anybody touched your bag since if 

314.08 317.65 B: if if i did something i'm not going to say sure 

317.40 318.41 A: yeah 

317.81 325.08 B: you know so yeah there has it has it gotten better yeah but if somebody wants to do it are they going to do it probably 

324.68 327.48 A: yeah you can pull it off exactly um 

327.35 330.80 B: i mean there are some morons that have been caught but they're morons 

327.49 330.16 A: you'd definitely think twice about it and stuff like that 

330.43 339.22 A: yeah you'll definitely think twice about it because you don't know the situation but you know i went to the airport to pick up a girlfriend of mine ah and she is coming back from london 

339.98 349.18 A: and ah now it's not like the old days where you pretty much go up to the to the freaking to the gate like they got you know you are kind of back and stuff like that but there's nobody there um 

343.86 344.70 B: right 

349.55 360.62 A: there's nobody let's say if i didn't want to like walk back there i mean they had it sectioned off but there was nobody they had a little podium i suppose where i guess there was somebody supposed to stop you but there was nobody there and i was there for like an hour and a half waiting 

360.03 360.86 B: really 

360.65 362.99 A: i'm like yeah so if i had a fucking bomb 

362.89 364.15 B: (( you're dead )) 

362.99 375.78 A: all i'd have to do was fucking run up and i mean like the plane's rolling yeah i mean the plane's rolling up like up the ramp or whatever it's like fucking i'll run up with the bomb in my fucking bag whatever and fucking you know blow up the side of the airport and the plane 

373.44 374.58 B: (( [laughter] )) 

375.99 377.90 A: and there's not a lot they could do 

377.90 379.74 B: yeah there's no question 

378.73 380.78 A: so i mean like you know it's 

380.89 391.70 A: i don't know they're trying but i i just i really don't feel it that much any more like you know i know they were busting when it first happened there was an international airport by me and ah 

391.65 403.45 A: um they wanted to know what the fuck you are driving and you know right after nine eleven i was within the airport and ah they wanted i._d. like when you're rolling up like not even in the airport yet i mean like going to the outside like 

403.25 410.81 A: highways getting in they wanted answers like you know where the fuck are you going or they wanted answers they wanted answers like you know where're you going like 

405.98 408.52 B: yeah they did that in philly too and there 

408.95 413.85 B: yeah they did that in philly when you went up you approached the airport they would stop cars and say 

413.50 425.15 A: in other words like terminal different terminals or whatever and you're driving around like the outskirts of the ah airport they wanted answers like i'm like jesus christ i didn't even get to the fucking to the terminal yet and they're already busting balls i understand 

414.07 415.15 B: what are you doing 

421.45 422.95 B: (( [laughter] really )) 

425.24 435.84 A: but you know um considering what happened like it really didn't didn't bother me much but then like you know maybe a month later like all of that's gone it's like yeah so 

433.04 442.32 B: all that's gone yeah until something else happens again and then it's like closing the barn door after the the shit happens but yeah um there's no question 

436.13 437.44 A: (( exactly )) 

439.77 441.25 A: right yeah 

442.02 443.69 A: yeah so um 

443.60 451.70 A: you know honestly i feel something else is going to happen in this country i'm surprised it hasn't happened yet um because there's a lot of mother fuckers that really aren't down 

451.59 461.13 A: with this country and the way we live our lives and stuff so i mean like i know like and and you know what it it might not even be like a terrorist from some other country or something like that 

452.89 454.37 B: oh absolutely

484.33 485.34 B: (( there's )) 

490.37 496.22 A: [sigh] what's going to happen is i i think that there's going to be some you know in some american's going to fuck shit up you know

496.52 507.44 A: oklahoma city all of that like you know like we're kind of worried about like what others are doing it's like we're going to fuck ourselves up you know i really feel like something else is going to happen because
