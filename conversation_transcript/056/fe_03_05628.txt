0.43 1.56 A: hello 

1.50 2.68 B: hi 

2.81 4.50 A: hi i'm brendan 

4.69 6.02 B: hi i'm ankur 

6.70 7.94 A: what's your name 

7.75 10.48 B: ankur that's a. n. k. u. r. 

10.94 11.96 A: oh okay 

11.91 13.81 B: mhm 

13.03 14.79 A: (( so ah )) 

15.03 16.79 A: sports strikes 

16.81 18.46 B: mhm 

18.25 19.36 A: (( you )) 

19.51 22.64 A: what do you think do you think they deserve the pay 

23.40 35.43 B: i i don't think they deserve the pay anyway and on top of that they want to strike in spite of earning so much money i mean a person like who earns twenty five millions dollars a year has no right to strike for anything 

36.10 38.82 A: i feel the same way i think that ah 

39.25 41.92 A: first of all they get too much money for 

41.95 43.00 A: doing 

43.55 47.00 A: nothing practical for the society 

46.94 48.81 B: mhm 

48.27 55.61 A: and then as far as striking um not really sure what their reasons are 

55.81 62.39 A: exactly but it seems to me that they're not satisfied with the amount of money that they get which is ridiculous 

62.48 70.03 B: it is ridiculous and that's why i gave an example of i mean i'm just watching a baseball game between the yankees and the brewers 

70.20 71.58 A: mhm 

71.06 73.30 B: and er i mean i see 

74.31 75.29 B: (( and )) 

76.42 79.88 B: all of them like make more than fifteen million fifteen million dollars a 

80.16 85.73 B: year why don't they think about the poor man who makes like probably average thirty thousand forty thousand dollars a year 

85.82 89.77 B: and he doesn't strike he goes and does his work every day i mean 

90.18 95.66 B: and these guys they play baseball for three hours a day and they're playing and it's entertainment 

94.33 101.10 A: yeah that that's exactly right i mean i'm an artist i don't know what you do 

101.16 105.37 B: oh ah i'm actually a professional i work for a company in jersey 

106.17 106.87 A: (( mm )) 

107.46 118.46 A: well i'm an artist and you know i also do stuff in the entertainment industry but if i had a job that was paying me what i loved to do 

118.38 119.37 B: mhm 

118.57 122.14 A: which would be art which is what i'm trying to do 

119.95 121.07 B: [laughter] 

122.06 123.07 B: mhm 

122.43 126.00 A: i would never strike you know because that's what my life goal is 

126.13 127.19 B: yeah i mean 

127.51 130.74 B: they don't think of th- these people they're just doing 

130.71 145.32 B: and i i agree that there might be a lot of sweat and hard work and talent and sacrifice involved but i think they're compensated more than adequately for it and think about the poor fan who actually goes to watch this professional sport 

145.25 148.60 B: a ticket at the yankees stadium costs like seventy dollars 

148.49 160.90 B: so i mean these people have no right to cheat or you know take away the game from that man or fan who's spent a hard day's work and then comes to watch a baseball game and these guys have made it a business it's no longer a sport 

160.85 162.42 A: yeah exactly 

163.26 168.87 A: well i just i don't know how i wonder sometimes how those people feel about themselves 

168.76 170.84 B: (( [laughter] i don't know how )) 

171.37 177.36 B: they how they like when they get up in the morning and look at themselves and all the riches that they have 

177.41 182.00 B: don't they think about the common man and then they dare to strike against what 

182.19 186.78 B: i mean they negotiate their own contracts they they get 

182.20 184.01 A: yeah 

186.88 190.02 B: practically everything that they want will 

191.22 192.57 B: get what you want and 

192.75 194.26 A: yeah basically 

195.08 200.95 B: after that you want to strike and then have the have the gall to like defend their strike 

201.50 204.15 B: i mean what's the basis for that 

204.28 205.68 A: yeah 

205.70 212.50 A: and it's it's sad because people that don't make a lot of money aspire towards these people 

212.54 213.51 B: yes 

212.80 216.71 A: and it kind of gives you know people that don't make a lot of money 

216.90 228.48 A: sports gives them a reason to you know dream and ah you know something to look forward to or something to keep them distracted at least from their problems 

228.50 229.92 B: mhm 

229.54 232.87 A: and then when that shuts down it's like 

233.52 244.35 A: first you gotta think well that you know they're being deprived of that and they're being like alerted to the fact that these people are completely 

244.79 255.82 A: you know running the country for nothing you know they're not and i don't i don't know if people realize that you know that ah that watch sports i don't know 

247.37 248.14 B: mhm 

256.01 259.96 A: it seems like people still look up to them even though they have 

260.00 265.06 A: gone on strike and like they act so arrogant um 

264.03 264.86 B: exactly 

265.01 278.11 B: i mean the yankees are a very fine example that i mean half of probably ninety percent of the united states hates the yankees but i mean they're still the richest team in the world in terms of professional sport they make the most amount of money every year 

278.20 279.79 A: mhm 

279.04 286.16 B: so sports is rich and they get more than what they deserve and they have no right i think to complain about anything 

287.21 289.30 A: well i agree 

288.76 289.83 B: [laughter] 

290.07 291.18 B: you know but that's 

290.34 296.14 A: plus the plus the people they're striking against each other and they're both they're both winning 

296.10 297.38 B: (( yes you )) 

296.87 298.03 A: so it's like you 

298.99 305.12 A: know it's not like they're ah there's there's no righteous reason for it it seems you know there's no 

306.05 312.02 A: i don't un- i just don't get the reason like maybe they're just sick of the people that they work with and you know they should look for another 

306.44 307.15 B: (( know )) 

312.47 315.48 A: um type of job or something you know 

315.80 321.58 B: apart from robbing the fan of his game they're not robbing they're not rob- they're not hurting anybody else because 

321.51 335.25 B: the owner is still making his money the players are still making their contract money it's just the poor fan who who wants to enjoy the game i mean you go to one of these minor league games and these people are actually amateurs they don't make a lot of money but they're playing a sport 

335.06 338.66 B: just for fun and probably to become one of these major league stars 

338.72 340.69 A: mhm 

340.86 343.94 A: yeah well plus ah 

344.13 350.18 A: you know the the teams that strike are throwing it off for everyone all of the other teams too 

350.11 351.48 B: mhm 

350.93 354.49 A: because it works on a whole the whole league system 

354.58 355.41 B: right 

355.63 359.92 A: so it's like if one person strikes then everyone else 

360.12 372.64 A: that you know they play baseball and they appreciate it or they play whatever and they actually appreciate their their gift they're not they have to stop all of a sudden 

368.17 369.05 B: mhm 

373.23 376.24 A: just because some one you know 

377.11 382.33 A: arrogant asshole has to you know wants to live for free or something 

382.31 383.62 B: [laughter] 

382.71 386.70 A: without even doing that which is a game 

386.63 387.52 B: (( right )) 

388.55 392.74 B: and i mean i think there should be laws to prevent these kind of strikes i mean 

392.94 399.29 B: especially baseball has gone through so many strikes it used to be called america's favorite pastime i don't know how 

399.22 402.18 B: how much longer that is true but i mean people 

402.12 414.59 B: really like you know want to go and watch baseball and if these people behave like this i think they a moral duty also towards society not just get their money and pack their bags and go home i think they have that duty to 

414.86 426.23 B: towards the fan the common fan who's just there to enjoy his game or go out with his game and show him a game and that that fun that fun has gone out i think it's become more about money rather than fun 

427.86 431.19 A: well i don't think it's really america's pastime 

432.22 433.20 B: [laughter] 

433.39 434.57 A: (( any more )) 

435.48 439.39 A: i don't know i'm not a i'm not a sports fan i don't watch sports 

439.13 448.81 B: mhm for for a person like me i really watch a lot of sport and ah i i i feel really disappointed when you know when i hear of player strikes 

440.13 441.33 A: so 

448.80 457.16 B: i mean i don't see any reason for it these people are making so much money anyway where's the need to strike how much more do you want i mean there's a limit 

456.47 457.08 A: (( these )) 

458.37 461.45 A: players can do exactly what they want you know 

461.91 466.71 A: that that kind of thing makes you you know i i was mad at the 

466.73 467.98 A: strike you know 

467.93 469.01 B: mhm 

468.47 478.82 A: i was mad about the subway strike and i don't think they even had a a reason for it either but you know when i li- when i think about the sports strikes that just pales in comparison 

479.04 493.05 B: yeah because those people those people are striking for a cause i mean they want better better work conditions or they want more salary or they want more benefits but these people i don't know what they want because they they have everything that a man could possibly want 

494.11 499.55 A: well maybe that's the reason maybe they have ah developed some kind of mental 

500.00 503.68 A: um problem out of having everything 

503.91 508.84 A: you know maybe that maybe when you do have everything you want then you 

509.35 512.20 A: it makes you think oh well what else can i have 

511.74 512.88 B: [laughter] 

512.21 514.36 A: like a sick like a sickness you know 

514.77 518.83 A: and that's the only way it can seem to me is that they're that they just have some kind of 

519.32 523.90 A: ah problem in their head you know some kind of mental problem 

523.85 532.51 B: yeah but but i think in fact to have a strike you need i think i mean even in it would need at least fifty percent of the players to work for the strike 

533.33 545.29 B: i i mean you think fifty percent of these professional athletes i mean they do have some brains i agree that most of them is probably based on a physical ability but i think that they still should have i mean you get people like you know 

545.24 555.57 B: david robinson of the spurs you hear such good things about him i mean he helps all the societies he does lots for the underprivileged or lots of the kids schools education 

555.53 560.47 B: i mean i think there are more people like that out there and why don't they object when these people want to have a strike 

561.66 565.72 A: yeah well i mean is there anything that they can do about it 

566.17 570.41 B: they can at least raise awareness or try to form a you know kind of 

570.94 573.87 B: anti strike being something like you know 

573.85 582.67 B: try to organize players who feel the same way that this is not the right way to do things because i'm sure once you open the eyes of anybody to something moralistic or 

582.49 589.79 B: something that will benefit society i think people tend to fall in line you tell them this is not the like greg maddox he 

589.76 599.13 B: walks onto the play and he's always like we want more money and i don't like this i mean he's making like fifteen million dollars a day just i mean i mean he's not the
