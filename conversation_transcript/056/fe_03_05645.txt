7.69 12.58 A: uh so i guess we talk about the uh heightened airport security 

11.77 17.86 B: airport security i yeah i guess so [laughter] uh do you travel quite a much uh quite a bit by air 

14.38 15.22 A: (( okay )) 

17.63 23.19 A: um probably not too too much maybe two to three times a year 

23.52 29.04 B: okay i i travel but i take maybe about uh six seven times a year 

28.79 29.70 A: (( okay )) 

29.15 33.48 B: uh what do you mainly for business or pleasure do you travel 

32.67 34.61 A: oh just pleasure 

34.51 35.45 B: uh-huh 

35.15 36.39 A: (( i don't have to travel )) 

35.49 38.27 B: mine's work but mine's a combination of both 

37.89 38.84 A: okay 

38.80 45.55 B: so what are what are your feelings on uh the airport security you know since uh nine eleven uh 

45.74 52.51 A: well i mean obviously it it it seems like they've heightened it up to be more of a deterrent than anything um 

46.36 46.96 B: (( [noise] )) 

52.87 60.75 A: obviously the the the security guys in their camouflage and uh guns is something obviously new since nine eleven 

61.02 62.76 A: but i mean 

63.61 69.97 A: i i don't know if how much of a deterrent that would be for like the sophisticated terrorist who 

70.21 71.75 A: is able to carry 

70.95 84.61 B: right i mean if the terror i mean if they you know if they know the ins and outs of our security system there's there's always a way they can you know get around it uh which in some cases i think they've even you know proven 

75.39 77.10 A: yeah exactly 

84.52 85.51 A: right 

84.58 95.64 B: um and does your level of security feel uh is it heightened as a result of do you feel more secure traveling now than you uh 

95.69 97.80 B: you know with this heightened security 

96.10 97.57 A: than before 

97.96 109.62 A: uh to to be honest i don't um i i felt secure before um but i i mean obviously there's a risk getting on a plane that anything can happen i mean 

109.79 111.71 A: um 

110.23 124.77 B: right be it a terrorist act or you know uh you know a plane crash or i mean just really anything uh you know i was i've always been aware of that and cognizant of that so but to be honest uh 

115.65 116.60 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

117.08 118.61 A: yeah do you do you 

121.65 122.94 A: right 

125.05 129.18 B: (( you know as far as you know feeling totally secure because of the uh )) 

129.28 133.77 B: you know increased uh level of security i really don't 

133.21 135.13 A: right right 

135.22 141.27 B: and i mean i find it you know it's just uh more time consuming more cumbersome uh 

140.78 141.81 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

141.40 143.14 B: and you know 

143.79 145.93 B: sometimes i can like you know like i i 

146.16 149.54 B: like i like i ju- just recently flew uh 

150.01 163.08 B: uh on like a friday afternoon out of chicago o'hare airport and security took me oh i can't tell ya at at at least an hour oh that was one of my worst experiences in 

157.73 158.98 A: yeah 

159.78 160.99 A: right 

163.12 176.87 B: in a long time of course depending upon you know what time of the day you travel it you know uh uh it's not usually that bad but uh and then you get there you got to take off your shoes you got to take off your belt uh 

164.16 165.07 A: mhm 

167.78 169.35 A: right right 

176.06 188.59 A: [laughter] well then there's things there are little things too like i i always carry like a little one of those little mini uh pocket knives on my keychain just for whatever use and now they don't even let you have one those you know so 

177.02 178.11 B: [laughter] 

187.99 196.89 B: right right yeah you can't even actually for a while there you couldn't even carry in your carry on like a like a bic razor [laughter] 

196.38 197.73 A: really 

197.14 202.07 B: you had to yeah start you know like uh you know right after nine eleven 

201.52 202.80 A: right right 

202.19 214.89 B: uh uh you know and then like on the planes you can't they can't have uh metal knives you know now come on those metal knives never [laughter] you know you couldn't hurt a flea with one of those but 

207.42 209.01 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

213.98 215.25 A: (( [laughter] )) 

214.94 218.79 B: you know some of it just seems like really totally totally idi- idiotic 

218.23 223.27 A: right right well have you traveled any less since uh nine eleven or 

223.45 225.01 A: pretty much the same 

225.13 226.51 B: um 

227.11 230.29 B: pr- it's it's well my traveling is 

230.31 241.82 B: down but it's not as it's mainly because the economy is so bad that you know my call for traveling for business is not as uh frequent as it used to be 

235.04 236.44 A: (( it yeah it's not )) 

241.47 243.32 A: right right 

242.71 245.13 B: but uh direc- 

245.17 251.91 B: you know so it it's relate it's somewhat related but uh not really 'cause the economy's just been horrible since uh nine eleven [noise] 

250.78 262.18 A: right right exactly yeah my traveling hasn't been affected at all i mean it was just for pleasure and basically whenever i had time and the money to do it and and it still is the same i mean 

261.54 266.37 B: right i mean like for instance my vacation you know plans of traveling uh 

266.41 277.22 B: for vacation hasn't been hindered as a result uh you know i enjoy traveling i enjoy uh uh you know going to different new places and uh 

269.39 270.23 A: right 

277.60 283.01 B: i was never so scared uh not make a trip because of that 

282.49 285.67 A: right it just seems like it's uh 

286.01 291.50 A: it it's maybe added security to people's you know 

291.78 296.75 A: feeling toward the thing with having all the new the new you know security measures 

296.81 303.48 A: so basically it's it is an inconvenience with the longer times and not being able to carry certain things on but 

303.47 316.04 A: at the same time maybe it's given some people some peace of mind just seeing seeing 'em there but my feeling is in general i i honestly don't think it's done a a whole lot you know i mean i mean to 

314.51 328.24 B: right i mean i do i agree with you you know to some people i do believe that uh they do feel more secure just because of that but uh i don't see whether these actual measures are really a hundred percent foolproof 

321.56 322.71 A: right 

327.84 341.00 A: right oh exactly i mean to me the guy who's in the airport with the camouflage and the the huge gun you know they just walk around i mean how often is he going to be catching somebody [laughter] you know what i mean 

340.48 342.54 B: exactly exactly 

341.90 344.55 A: [laughter] i mean he's just for 

342.65 348.87 B: you know but if they're there does make it you know look and it makes it appear as though uh uh 

347.64 348.66 A: right 

348.92 352.40 B: uh you're more secure they're watching out 

352.03 358.84 A: i mean to me i would i would much rather them spend the money to have the people 

359.04 364.19 A: like better trained who are actually looking at the x. ray machines and and no 

363.34 366.31 B: which supposedly which supposedly 

366.51 374.68 B: you know since the gov- you know government took over with you know inland security uh homeland security whatever uh 

370.98 372.20 A: right 

373.06 374.00 A: yeah 

375.09 379.93 B: supposedly they are better trained uh but 

378.65 381.29 A: well of course they're going to say that too i mean 

381.94 383.06 A: obviously 

382.10 388.73 B: but the point of matter is the point of the matter is these people still are not making a hell of a lot of money so the caliber 

388.75 394.90 B: of uh people that you're getting uh that are doing the screening 

394.40 395.51 A: right 

394.91 400.12 B: you know they're slightly better than minimum wage employees and you know 

397.77 398.81 A: yeah 

400.39 411.99 B: the same kind of people work in mcdonald's or or you know and they're not uh the most intelligent or you know how how capable are they of really you know 

402.73 404.32 A: [laughter] exactly it 

411.21 412.06 A: right 

412.02 415.51 B: doing the job that you know it's a very important uh 

415.53 417.66 B: you know job how you know 

417.46 418.73 A: yeah i mean 

417.78 419.64 B: capable are they really 

419.48 433.62 A: right they i mean obviously that that job has been kinda in the spotlight since all this has happened and i think it like you said if as long if they can increase the rates for these people it'll make that job more competitive for people who 

433.43 439.19 A: are qualified for it and will and will actually want it and plus i mean the fact that 

437.27 438.17 B: right 

438.92 452.39 B: but you know but the problem is there though the fact is we're really paying for this by you know 'cause their cost is added on to the airline ticket how much more you know is the public willing to pay for an airline ticket uh 

444.39 445.43 A: right 

446.84 448.19 A: right exactly 

452.37 454.35 B: you know so it's 

454.48 458.16 B: (( you know you're damned if you do damned if you don't [laughter] you know )) 

456.91 458.52 A: yeah exactly 

459.27 464.13 B: what air like what uh where whereabouts in the country are you located like i i'm in chicago 

464.01 468.51 A: yeah i'm i'm actually uh in chi- in the chicago land area as well 

467.91 469.52 B: oh okay uh-huh 

468.60 469.66 A: so 

470.34 471.37 A: i mean i 

470.53 476.04 B: so how did you get involved in this uh you know uh i got involved in this through like uh 

476.09 480.81 B: something i saw in uh on the internet from the university of pennsylvania 

480.32 482.57 A: yeah exactly same here 

482.60 483.66 B: (( oh okay )) 

483.34 484.48 A: so 

484.47 487.79 B: how how many have you done before have you is this the first one 

486.32 489.22 A: uh this is this is my first one yeah oh 

488.54 493.20 B: okay this is the second one i've done i i did one two days ago uh 

489.98 490.91 A: (( okay )) 

493.37 498.12 B: for uh it was on physical fitness uh the other day 

496.18 496.92 A: (( oh okay )) 

498.13 500.45 B: and then i got a call yesterday and it was 

500.46 507.51 B: i can't even remember what the topic was but it was just something i had no idea [laughter] what it was about so i just i just hung up on that one 

507.16 508.57 A: right right 

507.98 508.78 B: so 

509.74 510.54 A: well 

509.74 513.40 B: so i don't know how many more minutes [laughter] we go to go but uh 

511.97 519.59 A: i think we have i think like two or three maybe but i don't know if you have to talk do you have to talk about the subject for the full ten minutes then or 

518.93 528.46 B: you're supposed to talk about the subject for the full ten minutes you know but let me look at my phone uh i'm on my cellphone which gives the number of minutes we've been online so hold on and let me look 

533.70 542.00 B: well there's uh nine minutes fifty eight seconds but then there were you know when they ask you the for first couple of questions at the beginning uh 

538.23 539.40 A: right 

540.52 541.56 A: (( right right )) 

542.44 547.24 B: and then i guess it it after when you have thirty seconds le- uh left uh 

547.65 550.82 B: they come on and say you've got thirty seconds left [noise] 

550.21 551.34 A: (( oh okay )) 

551.23 559.39 B: and you know to say goodbye and that and then if you have any comments to say afterwards it gives you the opportunity to you know and then i guess that's it 

555.94 557.64 A: (( [mn] oh okay okay )) 

558.84 560.15 A: so 

559.47 565.95 B: and i guess i don't know when you get paid [laughter] but uh uh i guess i you know 

561.81 563.65 A: yeah who knows 

566.11 569.20 B: uh that i'm not too familiar with yet so 

568.36 569.24 A: right 

570.27 574.06 A: well i guess we uh we talked enough about the security i mean 

574.18 581.12 A: i i i mean obviously there have been big changes that have been made but whether it's uh actually doing anything is 

581.48 585.76 B: it's it's yeah as as far as i i still question whether 

581.77 583.18 A: is questionable 

585.85 591.07 B: uh it's really done anything i'm not i'm not totally a hundred percent convinced 

588.32 589.28 A: right 

590.28 594.39 A: i mean and actually we really don't know unless something else happens too so 

594.75 597.23 B: right right and knock on wood uh 

596.34 598.47 A: (( ex- exactly )) 

597.35 599.89 B: uh let's hope we don't have to find out the hard way
