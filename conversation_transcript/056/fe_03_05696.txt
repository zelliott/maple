87.79 91.32 A: they freak me out i mean this guy um you know the the 

91.52 96.78 A: the head of of that country has just shown obvious like disdain and 

99.14 104.37 A: i used to follow the clinton administration was paying south korea a couple of billion 

104.38 118.17 A: dollars a year to basically say all right stop your your nuclear program and we'll just give you a couple of billion dollars a year so that you can develop other sources of energy and basically it was 

109.22 109.89 B: yeah 

118.99 119.86 A: (( you )) 

119.67 120.59 B: (( ah )) 

121.19 126.97 B: these you're a little chop you're on a cell phone so you're a little choppy just i'm getting bits and pieces here and there 

121.93 122.81 A: (( know )) 

126.58 133.84 A: yeah all right i'm actually leaving the house right now so it will get better but uh yeah see even doing that and is it getting better 

133.23 135.35 B: yeah it is a lot better now 

134.35 141.69 A: all right yeah so he was doing that and then basically he just pulled out and it was like all right screw you guys we've been ah 

141.69 150.10 A: we've been running our nuclear operations for the last two years and we're going to be building our nuclear bombs whether you like it and then he tested um 

144.66 145.82 B: mhm 

150.72 155.23 A: tested long range missiles over japan which is like a you know sworn enemy 

155.57 159.97 A: of north korea and a huge ally of the u._s. so this guy obviously doesn't give a crap 

159.38 160.90 B: yeah yeah 

160.32 168.07 A: he really doesn't you know um he's [mn] he's got the largest standing army in the world i'm not saying that they're the best by any measure but 

167.47 169.52 B: oh oh really i didn't know that 

168.89 175.42 A: yeah he's got like a two million person standing army for such a small country that's something else 

171.95 173.23 B: wow really 

174.29 178.94 B: yeah but that's a lot for su- yeah i 'cause i would have i would easily guess china 

178.78 189.40 A: no no i believe it's [mn] it's ah north korea that's got the largest standing army and then ah recently i mean the threat to that's greater the bush administration said basically we're not going to do your blackmail 

189.19 201.51 A: you better just stop you know with your nuclear weapons we're not paying you off and uh they said nope going right ahead and you know that's why the bush administration doesn't want to talk about it 'cause their threats aren't working with them 

201.11 202.13 B: yeah 

201.54 209.92 A: and so they have something like thirty nine thousand troops stationed on the border between north and south as a deterrent and they just recently ah 

209.84 219.42 A: started calling them back which could you know people are saying that's like the start of maybe operations 'cause they're not going to leave thirty nine thousand troops 

219.48 222.75 A: when this guy has nuclear weapons they're not going to leave them right there 

222.24 223.46 B: yeah 

222.87 226.63 A: they're going to pull them away far back and do air strikes or something 

226.00 227.84 B: yeah mhm 

226.84 231.19 A: so north korea freak freak freaks me out just because this guy doesn't care 

230.56 231.89 B: (( yeah yeah yeah )) 

231.31 233.19 A: he's a wild man you know so 

233.70 234.64 B: yeah 

233.93 235.97 A: other than that i'm not really concerned with 

236.31 248.82 B: yeah i guess i'm concerned like 'cause when uh you know in the nineties when russia fell i mean i just feel like a lot of things like you know like they they they were saying how scientists were missing and [mn] you know 

236.47 238.31 A: you know i i think that 

248.73 254.92 B: like i'm sure like in the black market just a lot of scary things got out there that you don't really want to be out there you know 

251.83 252.85 A: yeah 

254.23 258.62 A: yes without question and actually i saw on sixty minutes a few years ago 

258.67 265.21 A: um the northern russian defence minister saying that they had at least twenty suitcase sized nuclear bombs 

265.50 266.70 A: that are missing 

266.80 267.97 B: oh wow 

267.64 269.65 A: yeah dude that's scary 

268.90 270.44 B: that is scary 

269.89 277.77 A: and considering like how little of the cargo that comes into this country is actu- i think it's like two percent gets checked by customs 

277.61 278.56 B: really 

277.89 279.98 A: so yeah it's nothing dude 

280.09 285.46 A: nothing so like that'd be so easy and a a suitcase sized bomb could take out manhattan 

285.73 290.41 B: oh yeah yeah i mean definitely or do some very nasty damage yeah 

286.22 287.02 A: (( you know )) 

289.72 295.93 A: nasty daddy there's something like two hundred thousand people would instantly be incinerated and i don't know 

294.87 298.15 B: wow they only check two percent at customs huh 

297.93 302.93 A: yeah dude it's creepy very cree- because [mn] there's so much cargo coming in 

302.54 303.81 B: yeah 

303.16 314.98 A: i mean in the airport yeah they'll check you and they don't even check everybody there really but um we're talking about you know freight freighters and cargo ships and i mean think of everything you buy that says made in china 

314.27 318.13 B: yeah yeah or taiwan yeah yeah that's a lot wow 

315.20 316.15 A: it's it's 

316.18 325.53 A: you know that's got to come in it's a lot of stuff that just comes in from other nations we import so much that they just don't have enough people to check it all 

322.43 323.09 B: [sigh] 

324.54 326.91 B: yes [mn] yeah that stuff scares me 

327.42 332.17 B: but that's why i say yeah i didn't really you know [cough] think of anything in in ah 

333.01 338.61 B: you you know like one country yeah north korea it it gets me worried but um 

337.35 349.65 A: (( well )) 

339.17 349.13 B: but at least we kind of know his [mn] you know like i mean he's going with nuclear bombs and with the long range missiles and stuff but i i and i mean i know china's backing us and 

349.19 351.89 B: you know just the rest of that region 

350.18 354.02 A: china's straddling both sides because china of course ah 

354.26 362.46 A: is sponsoring communism and the north is a communist state so it's like a little satellite state for them but it's also like pardon the phrase it's their bitch 

362.27 363.45 B: yeah 

362.85 368.06 A: you know like so it's like ah you better do this and china has been kind of iffy about 

367.70 369.10 B: what they're going to do 

368.13 374.29 A: about holding talks with north korea and forcing them to do it they just started to bow to some pressure 

369.50 370.49 B: yeah 

374.07 386.87 A: but china honestly i think china's the next superpower man you know they're just like okay okay united states while we build up the technology in you know everything so 

381.72 382.93 B: mhm 

386.44 389.62 B: yeah they have so many people [laughter] too yeah it's 

388.57 392.01 A: so many people [laughter] so many people like 

390.50 393.75 B: like a fifth of the population of world or something like that you know 

393.58 396.45 A: yeah it's ridiculous like six billion people or something or 

396.38 399.93 B: (( oh is it that much yeah i thought it was five yeah like like a b- )) 

398.76 401.87 A: i think it's actually like six nowadays but not sure 

402.19 410.98 A: not sure you know i hear about like they get like a little flood the yangtze floods and sixty thousand people die but doesn't bother them one bit because 

410.59 411.61 B: yeah 

411.34 413.41 A: you know what i'm saying they have so many 

412.02 416.89 B: yes [mn] they're actually building a bridge for the the like one of those huge rivers there 

416.94 420.23 A: yeah i heard something about that 

418.14 422.95 B: [mn] yeah some huge like it's supposed to be the craziest bridge like you know huge 

423.86 429.74 B: but yeah they are getting definitely yeah within you know a few decades they'll be like an industrialized nation 

424.53 432.16 A: (( yeah yeah they have great engineers great physicists )) 

432.29 435.11 A: they're planning to land a man on the moon i heard 

435.08 436.51 B: oh really 

435.95 443.09 A: yeah yeah i mean which really is a pointless endeavor it's more for political purposes 'cause you don't really gain much 

443.03 443.98 B: mhm 

443.36 446.51 A: landing on the moon it's more for propaganda 

446.45 447.67 B: yeah 

447.27 453.86 A: you know but nonetheless it's just a testament to their engineering capabilities 

452.84 459.14 B: mhm yeah yeah they'll be a yeah they'll be a pretty big superpower within like two decades i'm sure 

454.33 455.88 A: so who knows 

459.06 465.62 A: yeah and i come on look look how much we outsource to them technology this you're giving away technology 

465.75 477.14 A: basically when you give them the factory or or you say okay do this for us because you have cheap labor but you're showing them the technology that you're building so you're basically giving them the technology 

474.00 475.27 B: mhm 

476.79 478.07 B: yeah 

477.51 480.50 A: which is crazy and actually israel sold 

481.04 483.31 A: (( china a._w._a._c. technology )) 

483.85 495.37 A: a._w._a._c. is like you know that um super great radar system yeah and it was and and the u._s. put a protest said like israel you'd better not do this we give israel like three billion dollars a year in aid 

487.74 489.03 B: oh really 

494.63 500.39 B: yeah we give them so much yeah not to mention you know military yeah i mean just a lot yeah 

495.90 497.98 A: yeah you know and so it's like 

498.30 509.82 A: yeah so it's like the least you can do is not sell our technology to not necessarily an enemy but somebody who's not an ally but israel went out and did it anyway 

506.86 508.08 B: mhm 

509.12 510.74 B: oh rea- when was this 

510.62 513.24 A: this was like two and a half years ago three years ago [mn] 

514.87 518.77 A: i remember reading about it in the times it was just like whoa dude that's not cool
