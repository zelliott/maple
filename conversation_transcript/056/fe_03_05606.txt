39.36 40.44 A: um 

41.18 44.66 A: so did how how well did you talk about the topic was it [noise] 

44.37 47.54 B: um you know pretty good i mean um 

47.73 49.29 B: you know i i 

50.20 53.21 B: i haven't made severe changes in my life 

53.23 55.96 B: since uh september eleventh um 

56.09 71.00 B: i uh you know basically what i found was that what it did for me was that it confirmed a lot of suspicions i had um about the shadiness of our own government basically um 

68.84 69.80 A: mhm 

71.48 74.28 B: obviously we obviously don't know the details 

74.31 77.42 B: of the hows and the whys the whats but um 

77.51 85.69 B: you know looking at all the different things that happened and how it happened and unanswered questions and and now i don't know if you've been reading recently but 

85.65 93.13 B: they're doing everything in their power to to delay and try to thwart all the investigations into september eleventh 

92.83 94.21 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

93.63 96.62 B: the government is trying to like stop it 

96.26 97.58 A: yeah 

97.03 103.35 B: so it all it did was confirm my suspicions and make me mo- more wary of our own government 

103.18 104.32 A: yeah 

103.72 104.61 B: so 

105.15 106.18 A: um 

106.83 108.76 A: yeah i guess um 

109.64 110.86 A: i guess 

110.91 113.60 A: i guess i'm not embroi- in a 

113.86 117.87 A: way i guess i haven't necessarily been more suspicious of the government 

113.90 114.84 B: (( what )) 

117.44 118.69 B: right 

118.08 119.37 A: but um 

119.96 124.48 A: i haven't like i haven't made any i haven't made any life changes because of 

124.87 134.39 A: september eleventh like i don't i don't do things that i did be- i don't like not do things that i did before like i don't like watch out or something 

133.87 135.22 B: right 

134.83 136.04 A: and um 

136.67 143.77 A: like what else i guess um yeah i don't yeah i don't like shy away from places i shouldn't go i don't like [noise] 

142.69 149.03 B: yeah you can't i mean there's really nothing you can do um you know i mean i live in i work in new york city 

148.20 148.87 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

149.01 149.59 A: (( [noise] )) 

149.16 155.24 B: and you know like every once in a while it will come to my mind to like kinda just keep an eye out but 

155.53 157.34 B: you know um 

157.99 163.05 B: there's nothing you can do i mean if it's gonna happen it's gonna happen the- there's really and government 

163.20 171.98 B: you know has no real even when they raised the warning they don't they can't give you specific information of where and when som- it might happen 

172.10 176.89 A: [noise] [noise] yeah and there's been so many uh so many false alarms 

172.26 173.34 B: so 

176.29 177.45 B: right 

178.66 181.52 A: so it's it's really interesting it's um 

181.61 186.17 A: i i've read like a lot about like that alert system and like how poor it is 

185.56 187.44 B: oh yeah 

186.69 197.97 A: and just like i think that's really crazy like really i mean our our like alert system is so poor that we're or it's like not even we can't even like trust whatever they look 

198.13 199.45 B: it's almost meaning- 

198.63 202.61 A: they don't like read very much into it like that's that's kind of unfortunate i guess 

201.80 203.90 B: it it's almost meaningless 

203.95 215.07 A: yeah that's um that's kinda weird for me i guess but but then i guess in the same since i got older like i i guess i don't think it's weird now 'cause i don't really think about it very much mm 

207.79 208.66 B: right 

215.15 222.93 B: [sigh] well the the only thing that's a little bit scary and dangerous is that we're getting complacent again and we we think that it's we're safe again 

223.29 229.51 B: you know just to a great extent that that you know it's been a lon- it's been a while and nothing's happened since then 

229.85 234.98 B: so i think we might have we we're maybe under the false impression that we're safe 

234.89 235.90 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

235.54 239.13 B: you know and uh you know security maybe 

239.20 243.21 B: you know getting lax and and it might not even be 

243.65 252.47 B: you know at the official level but you know we're human beings and and individuals who are doing security you know they might be getting you know lax about it 

252.83 259.05 A: so do you think that's a bad thing then do you think it's a bad thing that we're becoming more relaxed or do you think that 

257.40 258.38 B: (( yea- )) 

258.52 262.19 B: yes because i think that that maybe what they're waiting for 

262.76 268.64 B: you know they they're smart enough to know that that they had to wait a while before they could do something again 

263.00 263.89 A: (( yeah mm )) 

269.38 272.60 B: you know and and in the hopes that we would get lax 

272.75 275.85 B: and then and then strike again you know 

275.93 277.22 B: (( um [noise] )) 

275.98 289.92 A: [noise] well i guess the only thing for me is i i think we're we're like cautious in a bad way like we didn't like we haven't reacted and i think that's your point too like we haven't taken the the best steps in terms of a of a people that's supposed to be 

290.21 304.59 A: you know on alert like we haven't we haven't done the greatest things like i mean it seems like september eleventh is is just kinda like in a way like shutting new york city down like you it's not the same place like you don't enjoy the same freedoms like they're like 

299.93 301.18 B: right 

303.98 309.50 B: well it's it's not that i mean i work in the city it's you know the only thing is like 

309.45 316.58 B: like i work right near the empire state building and you know there's like a perimeter like you can't like park 

316.42 325.99 B: in front of it you know you can't like even drop off somebody in front of stuff like that but i mean you know the sidewalk is still open you know i mean 

326.10 327.20 B: it's not 

326.56 329.28 A: yeah but i've been like i've been in new york like 

329.29 331.14 A: for the last few months and 

330.40 331.29 B: uh-huh 

331.22 342.41 A: it's just like just like things like yeah like having like the whatever like the national guard or whatever in the subway like that sort of thing like just don't make you more it makes you not want to take public transportation 

342.02 343.14 B: well 

342.56 347.23 A: you you know what i mean like i'm even like it's not even a situation where i'm afraid of like 

347.33 353.18 A: a terrorist like i'm afraid of some like big dudes who are like wielding guns for no reason at like fourteenth street 

351.94 360.91 B: [mn] well it's true because in a situation you know where they would feel the need to use their weapons they're gonna kill innocent people i mean these they've got automatic weapons 

358.77 360.47 A: yeah exactly 

361.29 362.25 B: so 

362.22 371.66 A: yeah like i'm still more afraid of [noise] like like rifles and whatnot than i am of terrorists you know what i mean like and that's uh and that's like and that's my problem with 

367.92 368.81 B: right 

371.71 375.97 A: america being on alert it's like i am sorta being 

376.11 389.39 A: like feeling secure that i'm being protected against terrorists i'm afraid that i'm not that the government is like like affecting me like i like my quality of life has changed 

388.73 391.65 B: well yeah i mean that that's the thing is that 

390.12 392.88 A: and that's the like my main problem [noise] 

392.29 397.77 B: that is a major issue is that how much liberty are we willing to give up for safety 

398.08 399.11 A: yeah 

398.17 403.86 B: and you know i mean um i mean ben franklin said you know those who are 

404.00 407.97 B: willing to give up essential liberty for safety deserve neither 

408.28 409.53 A: mhm 

408.97 410.23 B: you know so 

410.43 414.04 B: you know liberty you know there there safety is an illusion 

414.42 415.64 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

415.07 421.19 B: it's impossible to to be safe at all times you know you know could die tomorrow walking crossing the street so i mean 

421.50 423.01 B: it's it's 

423.26 427.06 B: basically you know directly or indirectly 

427.48 437.19 B: um the war of terrorism has made the government you know um given the government the opportunity to control us more strictly 

438.20 439.48 B: you know and 

438.50 439.69 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

439.64 441.59 B: and it's dangerous 

442.71 446.42 A: how do you how do you think the like the media has 

442.79 443.66 B: you know 

446.97 448.13 B: oh well the 

447.36 454.69 A: handled this in terms of like like h- have you like been really like skeptical and really frustrated by the media since 

454.04 462.95 B: well i i make i make it a point to to get my media from other sources than you know the major outlets i i go to the i use the b._b._c. 

454.80 455.99 A: (( september eleventh or )) 

462.71 465.60 A: yeah i was yeah the b._b._c. was like excellent 

465.11 470.67 B: yeah and um you know there's a website called indimedia dot org 

466.50 467.62 A: and 

470.97 471.90 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

471.48 478.86 B: that's uh i mean they're they're pretty hardcore like they're um you know the government has actually been trying to shut them down 

479.01 484.17 A: yeah [noise] um i have a friend who works for gorilla news network and i know 

479.69 481.25 B: so yeah 

483.37 486.11 B: okay i think they're connected to indimedia 

485.80 494.09 A: yeah like it's a little i don't know it's kinda it's it's out there but it's like it's really interesting to see a different perspective [noise] 

492.81 497.20 B: well because the the truth i mean what we get is spoon fed to us and it's 

497.27 499.15 B: it's you know it's 

499.18 502.06 B: like we learn the the united states has learned 

502.07 509.75 B: um propaganda techniques from the nazi people don't even realize that the nazis were experts at propaganda 

507.06 508.06 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

509.87 511.70 A: mhm
