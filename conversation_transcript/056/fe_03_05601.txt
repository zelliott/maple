0.85 2.47 A: hi this is kevin 

1.98 5.10 B: hi this is steve hey 

3.48 4.61 A: hey steve 

4.90 10.47 A: so the uh topic is what changes we've made since september eleventh is that right 

9.84 11.75 B: yeah 

10.81 12.03 A: um 

12.94 21.48 A: let's see what changes have i made really what i i guess for me the biggest change is that i've taken more chances now 

21.64 22.41 B: mhm 

22.43 25.99 A: that i you know figure that life is short and and uh 

26.41 37.03 A: so i'm doing some things that i probably wouldn't wouldn't have done if i if that hadn't happened and that uh i'm taking more financial risk you know to try to uh 

37.22 39.60 A: you know to to basically um 

39.72 45.67 A: you know make more money taking more chances with uh friends and and uh 

46.50 47.73 A: uh 

48.41 50.68 A: ah i think those are probably the biggest areas how 

50.79 51.86 A: (( about you )) 

51.86 54.08 B: [noise] mhm oh let's see 

54.43 57.11 B: i don't know i think i take less risks now 

57.55 59.28 B: i think it's um 

60.70 65.96 B: the point where you actually have to be aware of your surroundings and things going on 

66.27 71.60 B: and learning more about other people 

71.22 75.29 A: so you take you think you take less chanc- risks now okay 

73.51 75.62 B: yeah 

76.26 78.96 B: yeah i think it's a lot easier you know if i 

79.01 89.83 B: [noise] things that you never give a second thought to like a empty bag on a on a bus or a package in the subway now you have to actually pay some attention to it 

89.67 90.92 A: mhm 

90.89 93.40 B: so it's like there's no uh 

93.59 101.48 B: sense of increasing risks trying to like be aware of the world and make sure that you um 

103.70 106.33 B: you know watch your back a little 

105.53 107.08 A: (( yeah )) 

107.19 109.91 A: huh it's actually yeah it's kinda it's 

110.09 118.37 A: what you're saying is it's almost opposite of what i'm thinking and that is i can't there's nothing i can do if something's gonna happen so 

113.40 115.26 B: yeah 

116.15 116.82 B: (( [noise] )) 

118.62 125.58 A: w- w- i guess i i'm i take th- i take the view of you know why worry about it things are gonna happen so 

125.80 129.44 B: yeah yeah things always gonna happen but um 

128.20 128.99 A: mhm 

130.17 138.30 B: you know you just have to examine everything uh you can't accepting things on faith is just um 

139.35 145.72 B: a bit much of an area where you can accept things on faith and an area where you can't 

144.92 146.18 A: mhm 

145.76 151.47 B: and the can't seems to have gone a little bit larger 

152.11 157.24 B: since nine eleven things we have to stay taking things a lot more seriously 

156.47 158.24 A: mhm 

157.40 165.35 B: and be more responsible because in the reality is it's not that you know 

166.00 169.86 B: nine eleven's probably never gonna happen again so 

170.59 176.76 B: [sigh] and even if does it'll be in a different place and a different way so you kinda have to be prepared 

174.73 175.52 A: (( yeah )) 

177.89 179.13 B: to deal with 

179.17 179.73 B: (( [sigh] )) 

180.07 182.66 B: horrible things that happen 

181.95 183.76 A: yeah 

183.89 184.61 A: (( mm )) 

186.18 188.96 A: yeah i i i guess um 

189.81 192.89 A: that that's the thing that makes me think that 

192.99 199.30 A: it's not worth worrying about it 'cause yeah 'cause something is gonna happen if something's gonna happen it's gonna happen 

194.65 196.61 B: yeah 

199.09 208.55 A: uh unexpectedly like that was totally unexpected really there was no way to prepare for for that event 

203.27 205.25 B: yeah 

208.70 209.62 B: no 

208.81 210.57 A: you know not and so 

210.93 214.04 A: um i think if 

214.82 223.04 A: if i guess if i was th- the more i think about the the the reality is i'm uh i think about my own life i think okay i'm gonna die some day 

223.35 225.14 B: yeah 

223.59 227.97 A: so yeah how i have no control over how or when 

228.37 229.65 B: mhm 

228.60 231.02 A: or where it's gonna happen so 

231.17 241.10 A: uh i know it's gonna happen someday so i i guess i'm not going to worry about it [laughter] so it comes down to living life to the fullest and and doing 

241.11 242.24 A: um 

242.95 244.94 A: you know what i think is 

245.08 252.79 A: you know i can only take this day as as it is and hope tomorrow comes but if it doesn't then there's nothing i can do about it 

248.64 252.85 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

253.34 260.49 B: yeah it it's um it it's just sort of you know it it's funny like 

260.68 265.43 B: you know it's just the the weirdness of the sort of like empty 

265.69 266.99 B: space 

266.75 268.03 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

267.42 275.83 B: to to actually see where the towers were and that like there was this whole life that they had and this whole 

275.90 283.88 B: you know and people went to work and ate in there and passed through there and then it's just gone you know 

282.90 284.15 A: yep 

284.17 292.60 B: just gone and and i mean it's kinda it's just weird it's just s- sort of like you know it's like you know something 

292.69 296.01 B: when when you get off the train in lower manhattan 

297.31 301.88 B: you used to be able to see the twin tow- the world trade center 

302.06 307.73 B: used to dominate everything from i'd say 

307.52 318.78 B: canal street south you would know exactly where you were if you looked to your right and looked up because or facing 

316.23 317.01 A: mhm 

318.93 321.03 B: 'cause they were all they were 

321.43 324.06 B: in they were the landmark there's no 

324.31 330.65 B: way you could miss them there's no way you could be confused about where you were if you saw them you know a- a- 

330.68 335.17 B: and then just like you know like 

335.81 339.92 B: [mn] within an hour just gone you know it's like it's always weird 

338.24 338.80 A: (( [mn] )) 

340.14 342.40 B: to be in that area because 

341.58 343.74 A: are you do you live in that area 

343.68 350.95 B: no but i used to work you know i used to work in jersey and used to go and forth there all the time 

349.31 354.05 A: oh okay so probably yeah it means something more to you because you used to see it everyday 

353.73 355.32 B: yeah 

354.27 355.31 A: yeah 

355.42 358.86 B: oh yeah i used to see it a lot i used to see it several times a week 

359.04 364.59 B: an- and there's just weird it was like you know one day 

364.99 371.15 B: [lipsmack] i have to go back down there for something i don't know i forget what now 

371.25 382.78 B: and it's just like it was so you know it's like i had to think where the hell am i i turn around and it was like oh where the oh shit yeah okay 

377.07 377.95 A: uh-huh 

382.59 389.81 B: [laughter] yeah they're not there anymore you just kinda lose your it was just like i'd lost bearing for just like 

391.65 399.24 B: (( [noise] one ten you know ten seconds it's like where am i it's like oh man yeah i know )) 

397.94 398.66 A: (( mm )) 

399.53 406.63 B: (( exactly where i am and [laughter] yeah it's a little weird now and it was just like )) 

404.57 405.87 A: yeah mm 

406.60 415.21 B: you know 'cause you do i mean it was just like any other part of any other city but you know it's like [sigh] 

415.18 429.33 B: you know the krispy kreme and the borders and the restaurants and you know you're just like and they were just there and you used them and i think the last time i had been down there had been in august 

429.31 442.20 B: july or august that year and then it was just like there were at the end of october 'cause i had avoided going down there for a while but i had to do something and it's just like the- 

430.78 431.71 A: mhm 

442.02 451.85 B: there were so dust and the streets were all blocked off and the smoke was still rising from the towers and 

452.01 460.65 B: it was just like it was there and it wasn't there you know it's presence was there it's the wreckage was there you the whole 

461.93 476.03 B: sense of what was there remained burnt out blackened but it wasn't physically there and that was just really kinda weird i mean 

470.44 471.16 A: (( mhm )) 

477.34 480.83 B: i don't think if you lived outside of new york 

481.34 496.14 B: i mean if you never not if you'd not the experience of being in this building which i'd had on several different occasions i just went to the tower got in meetings and stuff there 'cause it was h- home to a bunch of government offices 

494.93 495.84 A: (( right mhm )) 

496.12 497.23 B: and um 

499.64 512.99 B: you know it was just like you go through there and then think about it and then you'd go up in there and it's like you'd look at the view and there's an amazing view but um the thing that that still strikes me to this day 

513.14 517.96 B: is if those guys had come at lunch time 

517.98 524.57 B: instead of at nine o'clock because it was around nine nine thirty because most of the ci- the business starts at ten 

524.25 525.11 A: uh-huh 

524.91 528.47 B: the the financial guys would be there at six and seven 

528.55 534.72 B: but most of the offices didn't really kick in until about ten o'clock so they got there about nine 

535.42 545.68 B: and they missed [noise] tens of thousands of people who are going to work in the subways and going in the buildings and managed 

539.00 539.96 A: wow 

545.64 551.64 B: just not to go in go there just managed to turn around at the last minute 

551.67 565.11 B: i mean it it was it's something that you don't that isn't said often but it was if they if they'd been if they came at eight fifty you know like around just before nine o'clock 

564.55 565.41 A: uh-huh 

564.94 572.45 B: and if they'd come at lunch time the place would have not only been packed with the fifty thousand people who work in the two buildings but maybe another 

572.64 579.65 B: fifty thousand worked in the ci- and there was a bunch of city buildings and and a big post office 

579.60 588.87 B: and a church and other office buildings which all used that complex to feed you know for food and shopping 

588.20 589.24 A: uh-huh 

588.71 595.90 B: there would have been maybe a hundred thousand people in that building if they'd come around eleven thirty twelve o'clock 

596.12 599.89 B: yeah so like you know the were there it
