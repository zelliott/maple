11.32 14.71 A: i'm good i'm good i'm enjoying the weather right now 

13.10 13.78 B: (( [mn] )) 

14.36 15.92 B: [laughter] where are you 

15.87 18.25 A: um outside my apartment 

17.74 19.77 B: but i mean geographically 

18.78 20.98 A: oh in phil in philadelphia 

20.60 22.53 B: philadelphia i'm in chicago 

22.28 23.42 A: cool 

23.08 31.34 B: and the weather's nice too you know i'm not sure that i ex exactly heard the uh topic uh did she say in the high high end of security 

28.55 29.45 A: mhm 

31.27 37.69 A: yeah she said if that high end security will affect terrorism in the sky or something like that 

38.44 50.27 B: well you know i guess for me i'm not sure that i first of all i don't i'm not sure that i really understand the true definition of high end security uh i mean do do you think you do 

46.96 48.24 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

50.27 59.67 A: uh not exactly i think security might be on like levels and we kind of are increasing it and going to maybe a higher end and just like um 

51.79 53.46 B: [noise] 

57.21 58.09 B: uh-huh 

60.03 61.44 B: so may we should just 

60.09 62.73 A: we've always had some type of security 

62.50 70.45 B: yeah so maybe we should just assume that what that means is um you know like uh a high level of security is that right 

69.34 72.41 A: right yeah that's i'll go ahead and assume that 

71.81 74.75 B: yeah i mean just for the sake of the conversation anyway 

74.42 76.46 A: [laughter] um 

75.18 77.63 B: uh you know i mean 

76.52 80.14 A: have you done any traveling recently and like 

79.02 88.02 B: yeah it you know i've uh i mean i've traveled not a lot since uh september eleven but i've probably traveled [sigh] 

85.56 86.49 A: mhm 

88.25 93.03 B: you know i mean i i've probably been on ten or more flights and um 

91.56 92.59 A: right 

93.07 93.81 B: you know 

93.65 101.24 B: ri- right in the beginning after nine eleven of course it seemed like a huge pain because we had never been through that before but 

100.08 101.25 A: mhm 

101.23 108.94 B: you know the fact of the matter is is you know now that we've well speaking for myself now that i've gotten used to the fact that i've got to be there earlier 

109.15 116.97 B: um [lipsmack] you you know i really have not experienced uh major delays i haven't missed any flights uh 

116.45 117.72 A: mhm 

117.09 121.92 B: uh i don't really and and and it doesn't uh 

122.46 132.16 B: you know it doesn't aggravate me let's put it that way in fact i think it's a good thing that we have all this security because then you know i certainly feel much better one once i'm up in the air you know 

131.35 133.21 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

133.07 136.40 B: so i don't know i mean that just that those are my opinions anyway 

133.32 134.08 A: oh 

136.08 138.28 A: [laughter] i see um my 

138.45 143.24 A: i did a bunch of traveling um like right after september eleventh because we um 

143.40 147.92 A: went home for a couple of breaks from school and so i was flying a bunch um 

148.06 152.20 A: and with the new security like i knew i had to get there earlier 

152.05 165.96 A: but i kind what happened is the lines were so long for security checks that i wouldn't even bother standing in line until they would call my plane and then they would just usher me through security and i would skip the line 

165.15 168.10 B: [laughter] so you found a good way to do it uh 

167.58 177.89 A: [laughter] [laughter] yeah so i was like all right well if if they can't have people miss their planes so you know people are going to be standing in line so i just kinda like chilled around and then when it came 

168.34 169.92 B: yeah 

178.71 181.01 A: but the secur- i mean i guess 

181.82 196.20 A: that sort of made me feel a little more secure although i have this opinion like if people really want to do something they usually they'll find a way to accomplish it and um so for terrorists if they're going to try to avoid you know get around the system 'cause 

196.17 201.37 A: that's how the system changes is you know people finding ways around it 

200.82 210.33 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] well and i think you're right about that i mean you know the fact of the matter is is that no no matter what it is if somebody wa- wants to do something you know whether it's 

201.46 202.29 A: so 

209.41 210.70 A: mhm 

210.30 219.97 B: steal a car or you know blow up a plane or you you know whatever i mean if they really want to do it they'll figure out a way to do it most likely 

218.90 220.44 A: mhm 

220.29 222.11 B: and uh 

220.58 222.75 A: yeah i agree with that 

222.20 230.64 B: you know although you you know i certainly feel better about the fact that they have a lot of these security caut- cautions in place 

230.28 231.29 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

230.84 243.17 B: i i feel a lot better than if they didn't have any of them in place but again i would have to agree with you that nevertheless no matter what they have in place if somebody really wants to breach security somehow some way they'll figure it out you know 

242.45 244.79 A: [noise] right right 

244.25 245.88 B: i guess the um [lipsmack] 

246.60 250.07 B: you know one the one one piece of com- comfort 

250.07 262.28 B: uh or one area of comfort that i think i have now days that i probably wouldn't have had before is that i think just like that one plane that went down on september eleventh out in pennsylvania 

262.07 263.28 A: mhm 

262.67 264.89 B: you know those people reacted 

265.09 271.21 B: and they went after the hijackers you know where where the other people on the other planes you know 

267.09 268.06 A: right 

271.13 285.19 B: the reports would at least would indicate that they really uh didn't feel they could do anything it and they didn't do anything so i think that you know in the future most likely what would happen even if somebody did figure out a way 

278.23 279.16 A: mhm 

284.95 287.23 B: a way to breach security 

286.60 288.27 A: mhm 

287.19 300.91 B: [noise] if somebody you know whether it be one one person three people four whatever if they were up in the you know the plane's up in the air and they at that stage of the game [noise] you know made themselves known and decided they were going to com- commandeer the plane 

300.71 301.63 A: mhm 

300.89 315.20 B: i think they'd have big trouble on their hands because you you know it was one thing when people weren't expecting something like that but it's another thing now that we've been through this you i mean you you know how americans are i mean 

312.36 313.33 A: yeah 

315.37 318.71 B: you know they're going to rise to the occasion right so uh 

317.26 318.13 A: (( [laughter] correct )) 

318.85 327.24 B: you know it it's so i don't know you know and of course that's that's beyond the security topic topic i guess but uh i don't know 

327.34 339.86 A: i think yeah with firstly if they start putting like guards on the planes or people now that they guns on the plane for pilots if something arises they'll be a little more prepared in the air for something 

334.93 336.62 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

339.77 341.71 B: [noise] yeah exactly [noise] [noise] 

340.78 346.94 A: but um i think the terrorists they can take advantage of the situation that you know we have we have pilots 

346.82 358.58 A: controlling the plane so that if they take over the pilots they take over the plane as opposed to if we could control the plane from an outside source as in like auto piloting from computers or something the terrorists would have no 

358.86 364.16 A: reason to hijack a plane 'cause they wouldn't be able to you know hack the system 

363.06 364.93 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

365.78 366.82 A: so 

367.06 371.13 B: [noise] well you know and i wonder you you know you just started to say something too about 

371.21 373.60 B: that made me think 

374.11 383.03 B: [sigh] uh you you know about levels of security for instance you're talking about the pilots having guns and and then you know [mn] 

377.94 379.71 A: mhm 

383.35 386.82 B: maybe not every plane but certain planes having an armed guard 

387.10 390.94 B: you know looking like a uh any other passenger on the plane 

387.25 387.90 A: (( mm )) 

390.62 391.67 A: right 

391.01 400.40 B: but i i think that you know maybe what they're talking about too as far as this high end of security is is beyond just at the airports you know a lot of people 

400.59 403.89 B: you you started talking about computers and controlling airplanes 

403.51 404.75 A: mhm 

404.14 406.75 B: and you know a lot of people in the united states 

407.29 415.71 B: really feel like they don't want to give a lot of information to the government because they feel like you know it's big brother or something like that 

412.08 413.23 A: (( appreciate it )) 

415.33 419.40 A: [laughter] not like the they do it willingly but they end up doing it anyway 

416.08 417.54 B: and 

419.12 432.57 B: yeah but you know my point is is that uh you know maybe some of this high end security what that might mean is a uh higher level of intrusion from the government into 

432.56 436.31 B: even like the phone calls the phone call that you and i are on right now 

435.93 437.70 A: mhm 

436.71 446.47 B: you know people listening in and taping and and whatever else now you know obviously there are a lot of people who are very much against that because they think the government or somebody within the government is going to 

446.51 454.38 B: misuse their power and authority but on the other hand [sigh] you know one of the things that got us in trouble with the um 

448.71 449.80 A: mhm 

454.96 460.94 B: the uh terrorists in the first place is that we were not you know as as a government we were not allowed 

461.24 465.09 B: to uh monitor their computer 

465.44 470.67 B: communications and and do a lot lot of things that we actually have the ability to do 

470.23 471.60 A: right right 

470.87 484.90 B: because of course you know people think it's unconsti constitutional or whatever else so you know i think that's where there there'd be like huge debate over whether that's a good or bad thing you know and you know my opinion on that is is that 

481.89 483.04 A: mhm 

485.63 487.67 B: [sigh] and this is you know if 

487.71 490.91 B: if if we could trust our government you know that's a big if 

489.95 492.18 A: [laughter] right 

491.20 500.48 B: if if we could a hundred percent trust our government to do the right thing with that ability and authority i think that would be a wonderful thing but of course you know 

500.67 512.44 B: uh there are always people in government who might misuse the authority and then you know take advantage somehow of of the general public so i i don't know i mean it i have mixed emotions on that myself you know i 

512.62 515.56 B: i [sigh] i think on one hand you know if we 

516.07 520.63 B: if there are known terrorists you know residing in the united states 

519.71 521.98 A: (( mhm [noise] mhm )) 

520.86 523.47 B: we should give the government the power 

523.55 526.81 B: to totally monitor those people 

527.09 527.99 A: (( i see )) 

527.27 537.94 B: you know that's my feeling but then i understand where other people would come from and say well yeah we'll give if we give the government the power to do that uh they'll totally monitor anybody they want to 

537.85 544.47 B: you know maybe even you maybe even you and me and uh so you know there's always i guess a downside 

538.04 539.11 A: right 

544.30 547.32 A: yeah i i agree and i see the point um 

547.56 550.30 A: you know if we want more security we have to 

550.21 559.03 A: we have to give away some of our privacy to the government so that they can ensure that you know security and as a people we just have to either 

558.88 565.43 A: be prepared and accepting that for the security we'll lose our privacy or we can go ahead you know and be 

565.22 574.03 A: like no we can give terrorists the same privacy that we give ourselves you know and then not have that security it's kind of up to 

574.25 588.31 A: the people that end up deciding what they're prepared to accept right now which level of security which level of privacy 'cause if you want some type of security if you rely on somebody else you have to give them that information so 

588.11 589.25 B: (( [noise] [noise] right [noise] )) 

590.16 599.55 A: i'm not sure i mean if people don't like the system [laughter] in america they can they can either try to change it within you know the laws and voting or they can
