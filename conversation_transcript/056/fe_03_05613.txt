47.29 57.47 A: yeah well i- it's very now see what i say is the ah the fantasy leagues for baseball and basketball take dedication for football 'cause you have the whole week 

57.27 59.36 B: but you got so many more players though 

59.74 63.59 B: you have both off and how many players are you allowed to draft 

62.54 65.92 A: [mn] no the c._b._s. one does ah you get like 

65.77 78.17 A: i mean i think you get more than the players than you need but you only play a certain amount and it's like one quarter back a week you get like two running backs two receivers you get one team defense you don't get d- you know 

78.09 79.34 B: oh okay 

78.23 80.44 A: its team defense is is 

79.44 87.64 B: i had a friend who used to run one of those and he used to have like a formal draft in a bar and they used to talk to each other all week long and they had a commissioner and they had 

86.51 96.61 A: yeah see those things are hard nowadays with the online with the online does it everything it's it's much easier for the past two or three seasons i've been doing it now it's much simpler online 

87.91 91.31 B: budgets and all kinds of stuff mhm 

96.61 98.66 B: are you more of a jets or a giants 

98.19 99.65 A: giant 

99.16 100.57 B: uh-huh okay 

99.88 100.97 A: giant 

101.18 108.51 B: what do you think about them ah i think i got a call from a marketing firm the other day about whether we should go ahead and put ah 

108.57 112.98 B: a big stadium over where the where the javard center is 

113.46 115.29 A: where the javard center is huh 

115.05 119.62 B: yeah they were thinking yeah they were thinking of moving them there from the meadowlands 

115.31 116.71 A: they want the jets 

119.31 120.28 A: yeah 

120.01 130.91 B: but ah the jets wanted the city to pay for a lot of the development they said that in return they'd put up about a third of the money and then they would go jointly on development and on the rent and stuff 

130.50 131.48 A: okay 

131.62 134.56 B: so they wanted to know how i felt about it 

134.41 136.45 A: oh that's the topic they gave you oh 

136.46 140.53 B: ah no that was another call that i got from a marketing company not this one 

140.12 141.66 A: okay okay 

141.14 144.06 B: yeah this one i think we're supposed to talk more about whether 

143.49 144.81 A: the strikes 

144.56 148.44 B: whether athletes are are are overpaid and 

147.91 158.30 A: yeah what do you think they should get paid i mean the striking i think is kind of ridiculous considering how much money they make and how hard hard other people struggle and stuff 

154.33 155.15 B: (( mhm )) 

158.44 167.53 A: but ah but at the same time you can kind of understand where they're coming from you know when the owners are making such a huge slice of the you've got to think of the industry as a whole 

167.57 168.82 B: that's for sure 

168.35 181.31 A: you know when so when the players ah complaining they're only making a couple of million but yet the owners an- you know what i mean are bringing in hundreds of millions a season you know and you're getting two three four million 

179.59 192.62 B: they told me that each of the leagues has a totally different pay structure and a totally different way of dealing with its players you know the ah three of them deal with things in a totally different way ah with drafts with ah cap money 

188.98 189.95 A: yeah 

192.16 195.72 A: yeah the three yeah baseball football and ah basketball you mean 

195.39 197.92 B: yeah yeah um 

195.80 196.71 A: yeah 

198.56 203.25 B: i forget now who's the highest paid i think the the basketball players make the most don't they 

202.89 211.71 A: th- the basketball guys make the most like overall you know um but i think there is a salary cap in basketball 

212.39 213.51 B: right 

212.90 223.38 A: so for like per person i think the guys in basketball make more but there still is a salary cap li- just like football whereas baseball there's no salary cap 

220.28 222.65 B: i think there is a salary cap per team though 

223.24 229.89 B: there's a salary cap per team 'cause you always hear about the team struggling to get this guy or that guy under the salary cap 

229.08 237.34 A: well that's why the nets are going to stink for the next couple of years 'cause we're no it's true because i mean we're paying alan houston and ah 

231.62 232.95 B: [laughter] 

236.72 239.13 B: well we're still paying for chris charles i think 

238.44 240.36 A: that's that's who i meant sorry 

240.42 244.16 A: for charles it's ridiculous and ward too is making a fat check 

243.83 247.68 B: right and he's he's um with the trading block this summer i think 

247.25 254.61 A: oh is he yeah he should be i mean we overpaid too many guys who you know like nobody's gonna want to pick them up for that kind of money 

254.30 261.28 B: mhm well you know the way i feel about it with the players is that ah they're not exactly players i feel that they're entertainers 

254.76 256.39 A: for that price so that 

260.58 261.80 A: yeah 

261.23 263.89 B: i feel that they're more an industry that ah 

263.78 272.58 B: really is supplying an entertainment service and if we're not going to blink twice if people like christine aguilera or britney spears or 

272.38 279.53 B: um you know ah bruce springsteen making three and four and five million dollars a clip for a show at the meadowlands 

279.50 285.91 B: you know how come we deny these guys the same right i understand that a lot of people think well you know they're athletes they 

281.94 282.95 A: yeah 

285.67 296.55 B: because they're basically uneducated they're they're not ah talented people you know they're players they should be more loyal to their team and to their cities and and ah they should you know play for the love of the game 

285.70 286.58 A: mhm 

290.36 291.27 A: yeah 

296.49 305.28 B: but ah to me i think it's a business it's entertainment and ah as soon as the player loses his skills you know blows out his knee look at grant hill 

304.92 305.91 A: yeah 

305.29 307.12 B: you know he he ah 

307.32 316.70 B: he's basically not really been a factor at all and the people constantly complain about the size of his salary and how its holding the team back you know um 

316.99 330.39 B: as soon as they lose their skill or they get a year or two old you know coleman over ah with san antonio i think he was playing last i forget um you know they just run them out of town on a rail and they want to shut off the money to him 

324.25 325.14 A: yeah 

327.84 328.67 A: yeah 

329.57 334.22 A: that's true yeah it's true i mean these guys get like like like a decade you know 

334.04 335.15 B: mhm 

334.31 337.19 A: if you if you're lucky for football even less you know 

337.27 341.24 B: yeah i think football players have the shortest careers over all 

340.62 341.94 A: oh yeah 

341.35 349.53 B: you know compared to the rest of the people i think i saw somewhere that a football player on the average lasts between three and four seasons and that's it 

348.92 353.96 A: oh three and four wow i would have sai- i would have guessed between five and six 

350.10 351.77 B: (( yeah )) 

353.54 365.89 B: yeah the the injury factor there is like extreme they're all expected to play with pain and the way that they're playing now you know some of the injuries are like life threatening almost ah the concussion and ah 

362.37 364.27 A: yeah yeah true true 

365.93 375.50 B: the players i think i heard somebody saying making a point that they're so much bigger now and stronger that the force that each of the tackles generates between the two of the ah 

374.46 375.86 A: mhm 

375.35 385.32 B: offensive player and a defensive player is like three times more than it ever was before you know back in the day ah line backers were like a hundred and ninety hundred and eighty five pounds 

376.90 378.15 A: it's true 

379.87 381.06 A: yeah 

384.99 386.12 A: yeah 

385.39 390.51 B: for running maybe six foot one now they're like two thirty and they're stacked so they're really 

390.08 391.37 A: mhm 

391.00 399.25 B: and ah that means you know just on the average about a third of each team is on the disabled list or on the healing list all season long 

398.63 405.22 A: all the time yeah and like you were saying they're expected to play with pain 'cause 'cause also nowadays with medical advancements 

405.05 408.37 A: like i mean these guys you know tear an a._c._l. 

408.19 421.42 A: and ah they're back in like a little ov- like two months well a._c._l.'s an extreme one but some of these other smaller knee tears and shoulder cuffs you know they go in for orthoscopic surgery and they're back playing within a few weeks 

421.45 423.78 A: you know that used to be season enders 

421.63 435.97 B: and you know what else i think that fails them is that ah the league doesn't really have like classes or or guidelines for them on how to invest their money while they're doing well you know like so many times you hear about these has been players and people 

434.65 437.59 A: brian gumbo yeah had a show on that 

436.46 444.32 B: by god i mean here are people who are used to living large you know and ah five years after they're out of out of the game they're like 

444.00 445.03 A: bankrupt 

444.51 454.13 B: working down at the mcdonalds and they they have three hundred thousand dollars in debt and they asked them what happened to the money you know and it's like we partied it away i'm glad i did it 

446.50 448.23 A: yeah 

454.33 455.78 A: yeah exactly 

455.91 457.02 A: exactly 

456.10 463.85 B: [laughter] at least they had that you know and it's like no man you got to be crazy here you had two million dollars sitting in the bank and now you have nothing 

457.88 459.49 A: yeah brian gumbo 

463.99 465.23 A: mhm 

464.02 464.63 B: (( you )) 

464.60 472.79 B: know first thing they do is they buy the mother the house then they buy one for themselves then they start on the cars then they start taking care of their girlfriends 

467.61 469.34 A: cars yeah 

472.60 473.57 A: mhm 

472.65 477.61 B: and you know and like the first year they blow i was listening i was reading in ah where the hell was it 

477.44 489.77 B: i think in sports illustrated le bron james and the other kid that got drafted this year um they're just basically high school kids and they get like these million dollar signing bonuses and of course you know the first thing they want to do is 

481.88 483.01 A: yeah 

489.64 502.23 B: drive the big cadillac or the big s._u._v. down the street with the big bow on it for their mother you know instead of saying well what's going to happen next year you know maybe you- you'll trip and fall on a sneaker somewhere and ah 

491.92 492.97 A: yeah 

495.26 496.47 A: it's true 

502.14 508.16 B: you'll be out and that'll be it so maybe this might be your only year that you're going to be making that kind of salary 

504.01 505.05 A: mhm 

507.42 510.32 A: yeah they they should think more like that 

510.52 514.30 B: so i think that they deserve the money they get um number one 

513.24 520.02 A: i i i do too i do too i just don't like when they actually strike i mean especially when it comes down to 

517.98 525.74 B: yeah that generates a lot of bad feeling you know what kind of nerve what kind of nerve is that you know you're making you're making eight million dollars and you want to get ten you know 

525.13 535.05 A: well the thing is finish your contract at least you know what i mean these guys are just like okay we're we're stopping right now in the middle i mean you know finish you did sign a contract 

528.93 529.89 B: yeah 

535.35 539.61 B: mhm and a lot of you know i i was listening yesterday to the news 

535.72 537.11 A: it's the bottom line 

539.81 547.63 B: somebody broke the story that jason kidd was going around saying that he wasn't coming back from the nets unless they fired brian scott and ah 

547.73 557.72 B: i've been hearing a lot of that kind of stuff going on you know some of these teams have such huge investments in these players you know it's not uncommon for a for a team to promise a player 

557.60 565.37 B: i think ah what the hell was um coleman's contract with the nets wasn't he getting like seventy eight million dollars or something for five years 

565.62 571.10 B: i mean it represents like a sizeable chunk of revenue for them and ah they don't want to lose it so 

571.67 581.41 B: the the coaches then have a tremendously difficult time trying to keep any kind of discipline because basically the player has a higher standing in the of the corporation than they do 

576.40 577.31 A: mhm 

581.00 582.28 A: yeah 

581.98 585.69 B: you know so how is he supposed to tell him to come to practice you know and 

585.98 587.71 B: (( not to )) 

586.93 588.80 A: not drink not party 

588.22 595.59 B: bad mouth the other players or to not drink not party you know how i mean it's i think it's thrown off the whole dynamics of the thing you know 

595.12 596.43 A: mhm 

595.97 599.89 B: especially you know when a kid comes out of college and he's making five million
