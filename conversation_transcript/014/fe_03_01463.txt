80.49 82.29 B: mhm 

81.19 91.34 A: so i made a different a big change you know not seeing my family and yeah and locally no i didn't make any changes here you know i live my life like i did before within the united states

115.13 129.03 B: that's uh outside of dallas and we have a very very high concentration of foreign people that live in our area because we're like in the silicon valley of of texas 

117.17 118.23 A: okay 

128.52 130.47 A: oh i've never been to texas 

129.88 131.49 B: [laughter] 

130.85 138.53 A: i really have to go but i've i never made it there you know i always talk about it and well you know if you don't have the reason i mean 

131.98 135.60 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

138.36 142.58 B: right it's not someplace you go if you don't have a reason yeah 

139.05 143.46 A: you don't go it's not a vacation spot is it right right 

142.63 144.38 B: i i think 

144.75 153.78 B: not consciously not completely consciously i caught myself subconsciously paying more attention to the people around me 

152.84 155.03 A: mhm yeah 

153.75 163.55 B: uh at different times um i have neighbors across the street and on one side of me that are saudi 

163.82 165.02 B: and 

165.21 166.92 B: it kinda makes you kinda like 

167.00 178.25 B: nervous a little bit because yo- they very much keep to themselves and so you don't know if cars that you see coming in and out or people coming in and out is normal 

170.88 172.11 A: right 

178.02 179.01 A: (( mm )) 

178.40 184.52 B: for them like i know my neighbors on the other side and i i i kinda know them a little bit 

181.33 182.26 A: right 

184.76 194.33 B: we've talked over the fence we're on a first name basis so i would know if there was like a strange something strange happening at their house that wasn't the norm 

191.98 192.85 A: mm 

194.27 195.29 A: yeah 

194.39 195.77 B: so i think 

196.18 198.26 B: paying attention more to 

198.48 201.30 B: you know what's going on around you kind of thing 

199.98 201.08 A: yeah 

201.31 204.69 B: i haven't gone to any major um 

204.97 209.54 B: you know like events like concerts or anything like that football games 

207.95 208.93 A: yeah 

209.60 210.64 B: um 

210.39 212.58 A: well that is a lot of changes though 

211.98 224.49 B: yeah and only because i'm like well you know i can watch it on t._v. you know you know whereas before my friends and i would be like oh yeah let's go to the cowboy game you know and now it's like let's just watch it on t._v. and 

212.65 213.56 A: yeah 

216.34 217.69 A: right right 

220.29 221.82 A: yeah yeah 

222.94 226.21 A: yeah that is a major change when you think about it you know 

224.45 235.11 B: and watch you know and i think it's just 'cause we're scared you know more than anything else it's it's fear of the unknown you look at everyone that you don't know and you wonder 

227.31 228.68 A: right right 

234.80 242.87 A: yeah you see i actually like a little bit different because i am a foreigner you see to me it's not that extreme i'm a foreigner myself and i'm used to 

235.50 236.82 B: kinda thing 

242.75 245.50 A: being around foreigners and i have a much 

243.98 245.99 B: (( mhm right yeah )) 

245.35 259.76 A: bigger tolerance to anybody who is foreign you know i mean whatever they have on their head you know even the people with the turbans they don't scare me because i see them more as well there's another foreigner wonder how he he he's doing in this country you know 

251.15 252.38 B: right 

257.71 266.12 B: [laughter] and you know i don't think i used to be that way i like to think i wasn't that way i mean i was born and raised in new england 

266.09 273.00 B: there were no foreigners around i mean there weren't even any black people around [laughter] when i was growing up 

268.55 269.57 A: right 

271.36 276.02 A: i know what you i haven't seen a black people until i was in my mid twenties 

275.42 284.44 B: you know [laughter] i mean up there is like i think there was one or two kids in my whole high school of seven hundred and something kids and we saw nothing there was it was 

276.49 277.42 A: yeah 

281.61 282.73 A: right 

284.48 287.17 B: it was not an issue it was a nothing thing 

286.28 287.59 A: (( right right )) 

287.20 289.52 B: and then i moved to texas and you know 

289.56 293.35 B: around dallas is so multicultural i mean it really is i think 

293.52 302.56 B: if you wanted to if someone walked down the street they could probably find someone of every nationality from every country in the world [laughter] 

299.30 303.61 A: yeah well the same here in chicago you know there's like a big hub 

303.18 305.83 B: yeah and so um 

305.83 318.74 B: it it was some cultural change for me but i always just found it intriguing and interesting you know like all these people are different you know an- and to talk to them and find out you know different things and 

309.91 312.60 A: (( mhm yes i )) 

313.93 314.84 A: (( know )) 

319.29 330.78 B: that kind of thing and now i'm not as open i guess i'm more reserved i i don't i don't think i'm like oh you know you're a terrorist because you you're wearing a turban you've got to be a bad person [laughter] 

321.95 322.94 A: yeah 

323.55 324.45 A: yeah 

327.64 332.86 A: no i understand what you mean right no i understand exactly what you mean yeah 

332.67 346.38 B: so um that kin- those kinds of things i think i would fly you know i say that i think i would yeah if i were planning a vacation or a trip to to go home i i don't think i would hesitate to book on an airline 

337.75 338.69 A: yeah 

344.43 345.36 A: yeah 

346.38 347.72 A: overseas 

347.72 348.61 B: pardon 

348.49 350.15 A: would you go overseas 

350.30 360.49 B: i don't know i never have been in my life [laughter] i've never i've i've never yeah i've been to canada but that doesn't count i mean i've never been outside the united states as far as travel 

352.08 353.49 A: oh okay 

355.69 356.74 A: right 

358.32 369.25 A: yeah because that's a total different feeling you know it it is a totally different feel if you leave the continent and you you know across the ocean forever like ten eleven hours 

361.46 362.41 B: uh-huh 

369.02 370.43 B: yeah 

369.31 377.52 A: it it is very different and then you know you are in a hostile environment all the time as long as you are in the a united states airplane you are in a hostile environment 

377.21 378.49 B: that's true 

377.37 388.05 A: then you land in europe to go into or france or or whatever you know an airplane to go home you are again in hostile environment because you know there is no good feelings between 

388.09 394.10 A: my country you know my my native country and and the arabian countries either you see so 

390.89 392.02 B: mhm 

393.86 395.02 B: yeah

402.87 403.93 B: mhm 

407.86 409.16 B: yeah 

408.35 412.86 A: you know they are like small things happening like mean things you know and yeah 

412.39 422.22 B: i know and i i sit i sit here you know and it's like i keep saying to myself why why do we have to be this mean to each other why can't we just leave each other alone i mean 

418.78 419.69 A: isn't 

421.55 422.93 A: that the truth 

422.78 432.77 B: it's kinda like you know i keep thinking to myself who cares what god you pray to or believe in as long as you're praying and your god doesn't interfere with me being able to pray to mine 

426.23 427.11 A: right 

432.42 433.83 A: right and when you go

434.04 435.37 A: (( right )) 

435.44 444.64 A: you know you know what i think as long as people do have a god whatever they call it you know that's fine they have something to concentrate on and there's something that they can 

440.63 441.75 B: yeah 

444.60 456.01 A: you know relax and feel well and ask for help and and you go with the solace or something like this i think you know i wouldn't know because you see i'm an atheist but you know i see that that's the way i see that 

452.95 460.33 B: [laughter] but but you know what i mean you don't go around as an atheist trying to impose your belief 

459.91 461.66 A: (( no no )) 

460.50 469.58 B: you don't find it necessary to impose the way you believe on someone else just like i'm catholic but i don't feel the need to impose on you 

463.06 465.72 A: (( no way )) 

467.91 469.44 A: yeah so's my husband 

469.61 473.89 B: my catholicism you know what i mean it's like that's fine you know 

469.63 470.46 A: right 

470.52 471.44 A: (( right ))

484.88 485.94 A: (( yes )) 

485.25 498.57 B: or go to church together but you know that doesn't mean we have to even interact we could just leave each other alone that's that's what i don't understand you know 'cause there's nothing in what you believe or in what i believe that 

489.69 492.08 A: right right i think 

492.72 493.70 A: yeah 

499.12 506.51 B: in my in my believing what i believe and practising what i believe would inflict any kind of pain 

506.65 515.17 B: or anything on another person it shouldn't you know and i just i i just don't i just don't understand that [laughter] you know 

506.81 508.29 A: absolutely not
