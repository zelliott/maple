2.13 4.13 A: hi amy alfury 

4.97 6.17 B: how are you today 

5.82 7.11 A: good how are you [noise] 

7.06 8.98 B: good 

9.17 10.37 B: (( mm )) 

10.26 13.13 A: um so the topic is september eleventh 

13.19 14.57 B: yeah 

13.92 14.75 A: okay 

14.78 15.70 A: um 

16.39 18.66 A: well i guess since september eleventh 

18.96 25.35 A: um i i mean the first couple of months after september eleventh i didn't travel quite as much as i do now 

25.61 28.21 A: as i did before but i guess um 

28.26 32.35 A: within the last couple of months i've gotten back into traveling a couple of times 

32.28 33.91 B: mm yeah but um 

32.74 33.48 A: more 

34.82 40.93 B: [lipsmack] i'm with the i don't work for the military but there's a military base right by us so 

41.43 46.67 B: that really changed a whole lot with security and things like that but 

45.38 49.66 A: well yeah but actually my my dad works on base also 

49.79 52.47 A: and uh yeah same same thing 

52.77 53.43 B: mm 

52.78 58.92 A: takes him you know about a h- you know twenty minutes extra to get to work he has to go through a screening process and stuff 

56.39 58.09 B: yeah 

59.29 60.04 B: i 

60.65 67.01 B: haven't done any traveling lately at all but it wasn't because of september eleventh just 'cause i have nowhere to go 

66.67 70.54 A: [laughter] see i have to travel for work i have a 

70.59 82.07 A: i telecommute so i have to go back to my home office once a month and then i probably normally be about one trip every mo- every couple of months or so to another location 

80.73 81.50 B: so 

82.29 84.44 B: so what did you do after september eleventh 

84.70 86.18 A: i just kinda 

86.26 90.12 A: actually i didn't start telecommuting until like uh 

90.32 93.98 A: january of of two thousand and 

93.29 94.02 B: oh 

94.03 94.92 A: two 

95.02 96.27 A: is that right 

96.59 98.72 A: two thou- yeah so 

99.28 104.90 A: [sigh] um i you know i by then it had kinda worn off a little bit you know so i um 

105.03 111.32 A: e- before that though i didn't travel between september eleventh and when i started t- telecommuting which is 

108.86 109.56 B: (( [cough] )) 

111.36 113.18 A: was a big change 

113.04 114.98 B: yeah 

113.92 116.11 A: because we do a lot of travel in our job [lipsmack] 

116.47 126.94 B: that is really weird though because i i know some friends u- other where other where in the nation because i travel a lot becau- well i don't travel a lot but i move a lot because of the military but uh 

127.47 137.90 B: a- apparently like from compared what i know well about my town to theirs it seems mine wasn't as affected as much i don't know it seems kinda weird because 

137.94 148.98 B: it's all associated with the military even though and the most hardest hit because a lot of the base will have to be deployed but a lot of people don't even like acknowledge it huh 

144.63 145.74 A: oh yeah 

149.34 150.25 A: (( yes )) 

150.31 161.35 A: i mean another big change for me was that now when every- anything big in the world happens like when the space shuttle blew up or it's [mn] like any tragedy act the first thing that comes into my mind is 

161.25 169.30 A: the terrorist attack you know and you kinda get freaked out over things that are you know big deal but not like panic attacks you know 

169.28 171.61 B: yeah even if it's not really 

171.88 181.51 B: um makes sense i mean i like some like probably the space shuttle i mean i don't know how it could've been destroyed by terrorists but that's what i thought too 

181.34 185.82 A: i i know it's not very logical but you just it's the first thing that pops into your head like 

185.91 190.04 A: you know did some terrorist you know [laughter] hop on board the space shuttle and you know 

190.05 194.25 A: it's just i- i- i- you're just kinda conditioned now to think about that 

193.53 195.02 B: (( yeah [lipsmack] uh )) 

195.92 196.73 A: (( um )) 

196.84 209.81 A: i do- i don't know i mean th- the other thing that i found myself doing is like you know you went out and bought the duct tape and stuff like that not like i really believe that would help either but it's you know i think it would be 

210.00 215.05 A: you think well i guess why not you know why not get it and you don't know what could happen 

213.14 214.35 B: yeah 

215.06 223.70 A: but i really don't think any kind of gas attack [mn] uh you know duct [mn] tape is really gonna save our life but i guess we might as well have it 

218.03 218.86 B: (( [noise] )) 

223.69 228.95 B: yeah definitely and some of the people out here s- uh i live in the desert in idaho so 

228.92 242.54 B: some of the people are really into the survivalist thing and give 'em more reason to buy like s- stuff like for the y. two k. incident and stuff like that generators food [laughter] i 

242.43 244.82 B: don't know why they do but 

242.49 243.70 A: oh yeah 

244.44 248.61 A: give 'em more reason to use all their y. two k. storage stuff yeah 

248.14 252.29 B: yeah so they don't sell their generators on ebay [laughter] [cough] 

251.53 253.81 A: [laughter] 

254.19 256.26 A: yeah i i don't know i mean i 

256.77 268.41 A: i don't know i mean i think a lot of people say you know that uh i mean it's a big theory that you sp- people are spending more time with their families and you know doing a lot more but i don't think that i've really done that i mean i think i 

268.54 273.75 A: pretty much have always spent a lot of time with my family and that hasn't really changed any you know i don't know how about you 

273.61 282.61 B: yeah sa- same here i don't think it changed um i don't really know what changed i mean because for a while in my life i lived in england and 

282.61 293.28 B: there i was faced with um terrorism by the irish republican army although it wasn't i mean i i didn't live in london so i didn't obviously i could see it if i read it in the newspaper and things like that 

293.88 302.58 B: and i mean i don't know if i'm desensitized but it is a tragedy but some people are really taking it a whole lot different than than me 

302.31 314.08 A: well i mean i don't i don't know i mean i guess it was just a strange feeling i mean you know i mean like terrorist terrorism happens all over the world but it was a big shock to see it happen in you know new york city but 

312.34 313.32 B: yeah 

314.23 319.25 A: kinda like after it was a big deal i mean and it did 

319.39 326.17 A: you know it bro- broke my heart but then it you know and then when we celebrated the anniversary i was you know i think everybody kinda i 

326.37 327.48 B: yeah 

326.37 339.61 A: think that was a big changing point i mean to me i just kinda realized okay it's it wasn't the end of the world these kinda things happen and you know we're a good strong con- country and you know it'll be all right you know i don't think i was ever 

338.02 338.93 B: yeah 

340.26 343.55 A: you know i really freaked out about it but it i think i'm 

343.71 345.61 A: back to normal now you know 

345.39 350.61 B: yeah i think yeah yeah it would be a good marking point 

350.83 354.72 B: i think even though i think some people still take it use it for their 

354.74 361.48 B: political or whatever gain but y- they might not believe it themselves but seemed like 

356.52 357.40 A: right 

359.68 360.77 A: yeah i mean 

361.09 369.12 A: [noise] th- that's the thing about the whole the war thing that just makes me the i mean i don't have a problem with us going to war but it just seemed like it was a big cop out to try and 

369.07 371.90 A: link it somehow with september eleventh you know 

371.15 372.44 B: yeah 

371.78 385.31 A: and i feel like you know we're not stupid [noise] you know if you tell us the real reasons for something we can think it through logically and figure out if we wanna you know if we believe in it or not [noise] but don't try and make it you know like six degrees of separation between saddam hussein and 

374.43 375.56 B: [laughter] 

385.10 388.01 A: osama bin laden 'cause nobody's buying it you know 

387.99 391.99 B: yeah the r- really interesting bit i read was after 

392.06 400.21 B: september eleventh uh like a week after they polled the population and six percent connected iraq with september eleventh 

400.41 405.83 B: but now it's something like fifty percent and it's really weird what people can use 

405.95 409.46 B: an event to change people's minds even though 

409.80 412.45 B: there's no logical connection 

412.31 422.05 A: i was listening to some radio show and they said that would be like you know blaming iraq for september eleventh is like blaming you know the chinese for pearl harbor you know it's just 

422.02 433.27 A: [laughter] you know people don't know any better i mean if th- they're just think people over in the middle east ah you know he supports some terrorism it's his fault you know he had nothing to do with it he's his own evil problems you know 

422.68 424.01 B: (( [laughter] )) 

433.03 440.76 A: but he had nothing to do with september eleventh that i've ever seen i mean who knows maybe they have some secret hidden proof but i don't think so 

436.15 437.06 B: yeah 

440.48 446.02 B: well h- h- yeah i don't trust people that can't find iraq on a map [laughter] 

444.43 447.91 A: [laughter] yeah that's scary 

448.21 450.23 A: but uh i don't know i mean [lipsmack] 

451.28 462.11 A: i think i think it probably did affect people you know definitely i know a lot of people who live in new york city and i think it af- you know definitely affected them a lot more than anywhere else in the country you know 

459.67 460.66 B: yeah 

461.36 468.65 B: yeah i i don't know anybody from the east but i'm about as far as from new york as you can get 

462.49 463.30 A: i mean 

468.08 469.33 A: [laughter] 

468.68 471.69 B: without going to california or washington 

472.37 480.87 B: but i don't know i think also people outside the united states had a hu were affected a lot too because 

481.39 489.64 B: they realize that now the earth is gonna be different because what's happens to the rest of the world now happens to america and they can go to war twice 

488.75 489.61 A: (( y- yeah )) 

489.76 490.53 B: [laughter] 

489.79 492.34 A: i mean it was i think part of it i mean 

492.79 506.98 A: i think the whole world kinda was you know saddened and you know in in a state of warning for a while but now i think [laughter] that the rest of the world is like all right all right get over the september eleventh thing already you know um not all the world but 

504.69 505.59 B: yeah 

507.71 515.47 A: i don't know an interesting thing after it happened i i saw the i thought it was kinda interesting bono from u. two i don't know if you know who he is but he was 

514.88 515.95 B: yeah 

515.36 528.81 A: he r- he was he is quoted for uh as saying he use- he was always a pacifist up until that happened and now he doesn't know if he could be a pacifist anymore because he was so angry and had such violent feelings after september eleventh you know 

528.83 534.84 A: i thought that was interesting i don't know if he would that was right after the i- that it happened i don't know if he would still feel that way or not 

528.94 530.04 B: yeah 

534.66 540.55 B: yeah well i'm ask people recru- uh enlist in the army the a couple of days after 

540.95 552.49 B: i don't know what that would accomplish [laughter] but uh because at that time they hadn't found out anything about it but i mean already even though they didn't know who did it they wanted to go kill 'em [laughter] 

552.68 553.79 A: yeah 

553.94 561.30 A: i mean i think [sigh] i it's just you know i think i everybody felt a little bit more patriotic but 

561.44 570.26 A: i think people would just take that in different ways you know like this whole war thing people saying if you're not for the war you're not patriotic well that's not true at all you know 

569.36 570.34 B: yeah 

570.34 582.24 A: i mean ev- everybody loves his country you know i mean or not everybody but a lot of people who live here love this country and they don't may nor may not like the war you know that's not a deciding factor but 

575.10 576.69 B: most yeah 

582.49 589.89 A: you know it just seems like there's a lot more the right kind of l- the right wing you know war kinda mentality is really 

589.57 595.08 B: it's really weird how it s- sorta like changed the definition of patriotism because 

595.38 599.95 B: previously proba- i don't know well you probably wouldn't become sort of patriotic if you're opposed to war
