239.60 240.23 A: (( [noise] )) 

240.33 254.43 B: and you know they sent us home and you know a lot of people were nervous and were even thinking that you know this area might get you know hit next because of everything that surrounded we're a naval

280.10 280.86 A: i 

281.12 292.31 A: there's been a lot of controversy since i live right near um independence hall they they had closed the streets in front of it because of terrorist but

299.17 300.34 B: oh okay 

300.19 301.74 A: and you know 

302.68 309.08 A: now that it's part of uh the uh united states park system 

309.25 314.01 A: they did not want it reopened because they felt that there was 

314.24 316.03 A: too much you know 

316.48 322.90 A: in the way of security for them to cover they felt that was out the barriers there 

318.60 319.28 B: (( mm )) 

322.95 326.59 A: but i'm one of the people that also believe that 

326.72 330.02 A: the barriers only show that they've won 

330.03 332.12 B: right yeah 

330.49 336.02 A: that people [laughter] can't just walk up and you know go see independence hall 

335.88 336.66 B: mhm 

336.08 340.32 A: and and all that is around the area so 

340.43 345.88 A: that just opened april first and i'm one of the happy people who had it 

342.94 343.68 B: mm 

346.14 348.29 A: um so really 

349.49 355.30 A: uh things like this including the war don't change any of my plans 

355.44 359.65 B: no i mean i'm ready this year with um 

359.69 370.04 B: taking i went to miami i'm going to orlando to disney um in june and you know i hear with the um 

370.38 376.44 B: you know not with the sars and all these things that are going on i'm like uh i'm still 

372.36 373.37 A: uh-huh 

374.96 376.06 A: well that's 

376.28 384.17 A: actually the sars scares me more than the terrorism uh in three weeks i'm going to israel for a month 

383.64 385.11 B: oh okay 

384.39 386.52 A: and that's [laughter] 

385.97 387.72 B: mm yeah 

387.70 393.43 A: as i said i'm not the kind of person if i wanna do something i go ahead and do it so 

395.05 396.54 A: nothing changes 

396.45 406.17 B: yeah uh 'cause i was thinking about taking a you know the airplane ride being that they have that sars going around and is it safe you 

404.32 410.37 A: well exact- as i said that's scares me more than going to the middle east 

406.58 407.28 B: (( know )) 

410.01 410.95 B: mhm 

410.51 417.67 A: um what i'm going you know i'm going to take a mask and gloves like everybody else for the plane ride 

417.52 418.13 B: (( mm )) 

418.48 427.59 B: yeah [mn] i don't know it's just the i mean if if you stop doing things you wanna do then you're not living you're not do- you know 

427.30 429.41 A: that's exactly my attitude 

429.42 430.43 B: you just 

429.65 442.07 A: so we really agree on that you know i can't uh my children and friends are saying don't go now you know but i wanna do this now and that's what i'm doing 

432.42 433.45 B: yeah 

442.38 448.49 B: then then they win if you stop doing anything all the things that you wanna do or that you normally do 

444.33 445.39 A: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

448.87 450.03 B: they've won 

450.37 451.50 A: i agree 

451.53 453.37 A: i absolutely agree 

453.72 465.65 B: you know it's like they said you've just gotta keep doing what you're doing you're normal routine don't change i mean of course you know if your neighborhood gets shut down then you know you have no choice but you know 

466.44 469.86 B: but to obey the rules but you know 

468.38 469.29 A: right 

470.08 472.75 B: but in things if you're gonna take a trip you take a trip 

473.51 474.39 A: yeah 

473.59 477.48 B: i mean it's like they say when it's your time it's your time it doesn't 

477.56 479.59 B: you know really matter where 

479.83 484.51 B: you know your plans because if you're gonna go at a certain time then 

484.61 494.72 A: yes but i think you and i are in the minority here because i don't say most people think that way i think most people 

485.19 486.31 B: that's it 

496.03 498.04 A: do change their plans 

497.84 498.85 B: mhm 

499.17 500.91 B: so they they um 

501.49 504.04 B: um how do they say uh 

504.91 506.54 B: (( they're )) 

507.37 512.21 B: they don't choose to live their live uh live as living dumb kind of 

511.65 512.45 A: yes 

512.70 513.80 B: (( yeah )) 

513.07 515.30 A: yes yes exactly 

515.37 523.89 A: i've never done this before and ten minutes is a very long time to talk one very specific topic 

518.69 521.05 B: [laughter] 

522.49 523.13 B: (( mm )) 

523.36 531.70 B: yeah also um what do you think should have replaced the buildings 

530.87 535.39 A: oh well i've seen the designs um 

536.57 540.67 B: what did they decide on finally because or did they decide 

539.83 553.85 A: well they had two the last i and i'm not exactly sure which one but i like them both and i do believe something tall should be built not necessarily an office building 

553.84 556.74 A: but you know something that stands 

556.92 560.36 A: as high or higher than the twin towers 

558.97 560.01 B: well wasn't 

560.04 564.53 B: wasn't that what they decided on i thought i heard something about that 

563.30 573.93 A: i i think so i can't remember the details right now but i remember that i was pleased with the uh the design because um 

574.30 581.97 A: i think putting up two skyscrapers was not the answer but putting up something that 

579.61 580.17 B: (( mm )) 

582.22 584.94 A: went you know high in the air 

584.86 586.19 B: mhm 

586.21 587.77 A: was appropriate 

587.88 590.28 B: mm okay yeah 'cause um 

589.89 599.02 A: and i like the fact that the ground ground zero you know uh is going to be like a memorial park and i thought that was very necessary 

598.08 599.89 B: right it was a combination of the
