56.47 59.14 A: oh no [laughter] 

57.28 63.54 B: because my car broke down luckily it wasn't that far away but that was before the september eleventh attack and 

64.10 67.02 B: actually it was that summer i think [laughter] but uh 

67.03 74.43 B: no there's no there's no changes 'cause like i told my husband you know he was worried that day and i was like what are they going to bomb in philadelphia 

74.54 84.24 A: well that's what my kids say about uh mcewan tennessee because i don't even think you can find it on a map [laughter] like they can't find us [laughter] 

80.82 82.72 B: [laughter] you know what i told my 

83.44 92.07 B: i told my [laughter] yeah as i told my husband i said i'd love to move to tennessee i said but it seems really populated looking at the map and he said those are just small towns 

91.88 93.91 A: yes [laughter] 

93.09 95.68 B: he said there ain't that as many people as you think 

95.67 96.67 A: no 

95.79 96.52 B: but 

96.55 108.27 B: no it we live outside of philadelphia and from what i understand they've made changes you know to the airports and things like that and i mean for the longest time you couldn't get to see the liberty bell but 

108.40 115.76 B: personally i haven't made any changes i mean i wasn't afraid to go out that day because i mean well what are they going to hit that i was going to be at 

115.54 121.76 A: exactly i know my kids were you know a little more upset by it than i was and i'm like you know think about it 

121.98 122.80 B: yeah 

122.13 124.55 A: what have they got to bomb in tennessee 

125.05 126.44 B: well fortun- 

125.42 128.33 A: you know they're gonna to me they're gonna target 

128.52 130.45 A: government and 

129.30 130.11 B: yeah 

130.32 131.39 B: i agree 

131.05 138.03 A: i said you know what have we really got and i said the most we got is nashville or memphis and i said we're in between both so we're okay 

137.99 145.27 B: and i told my husband i said what are they going to bomb the liberty bell [laughter] i said what are they gonna hit [laughter] 

141.71 143.63 A: yeah you know and 

144.34 148.03 A: you can't live your life in constant terror you know 

147.94 149.91 B: no you can't um 

148.93 153.46 A: my theory is if it's your time to go you're going i don't care where you're at 

152.78 158.63 B: yeah that that's exactly it the last time i flew by plane was actually 

158.71 171.70 B: uh february twen- twenty ninth or thirty uh by march first it was two thousand and you know it was it was real easy getting to check in and stuff i understand it's probably a lot worse now 

164.75 165.69 A: yeah 

171.58 173.65 A: that's what i understand 

173.26 174.53 B: and 

174.72 177.71 B: but personally not a thing [laughter] 

177.37 181.79 A: no the strangest thing was i think the day after 

182.00 184.81 A: or two days after i had to go to nashville 

184.85 197.53 A: and i had to go right by the airport and you're talking totally dead and that area's never dead [laughter] it was the easiest trip i'd ever made i mean there wasn't even any army planes and it was it was odd 

188.76 189.65 B: (( right )) 

190.27 191.31 B: [laughter] 

197.47 198.41 B: (( oh yeah )) 

197.58 200.25 A: that was a weird feeling seeing nothing 

200.03 203.35 B: yeah i try to av- avoid the airport area like the plague 

203.02 210.40 A: yeah i do too and i was really dreading it but i had to go i didn't have a choice and it was like wow [laughter] 

209.39 213.07 B: the worst thing is my husband is retired military 

212.81 213.91 A: mm 

213.64 223.26 B: and he hadn't passed the ten year mark yet he didn't pass until just ah actually until november this year and his biggest fear is being called back 

217.05 217.93 A: (( oh no )) 

220.44 221.38 A: mhm 

223.21 224.71 A: (( oh i can imagine )) 

224.41 237.18 B: but he for some reason they sent it um he's supposed to have ten years but they sent his things basically telling him he's through with the military they sent it in november last year at the nine year mark instead of the ten year mark 

237.11 239.70 B: so he's like guard that with your life 

237.28 238.02 A: (( right )) 

239.28 243.27 A: exactly i know my oldest son is twenty he's like 

243.52 248.75 A: mom i may be moving to canada [laughter] he said nobody's mad at canada 

248.51 259.69 B: [laughter] you know what my both of my boys they're eight and seven and they have hemophilia and i told them i said that you know in some ways i'm glad they have it because they won't ever be drafted 

259.35 271.40 A: exactly it's and i told him he's on medication the rest of his life i said i don't think they'll draft you i said if they do i'll go with you to canada i'm like you know if you want to fight i'm i support you 

267.04 268.58 B: (( it [laughter] )) 

271.22 272.17 B: yeah 

271.56 276.84 A: but these kids that don't want to go what's the point of sending them they're the ones that's gonna get killed 

276.79 279.96 B: yeah not only that the they're going to get somebody else killed 

279.84 280.65 A: yeah 

280.58 281.43 B: so i mean 

281.59 295.99 B: so there there's been no real changes the biggest change was trying to explain it to my boys because at the time my oldest one or my youngest one was in kindergarten and he'd just started it wasn't even a month that he'd been in kindergarten it was only like a couple days 

289.68 290.54 A: yeah 

295.43 300.29 A: and it's got to be much harder for younger children mine are fifteen and twenty and 

299.72 301.59 B: they can understand 

300.90 302.66 A: yeah they understand more 

302.63 305.11 B: yeah my my children were like 

305.40 315.31 B: i picked them up from school that day and i was like did you guys hear what happened and and since then the oldest one has been he's eight years old now and he's like 

315.42 321.08 B: are we at war with somebody why he's got all these questions and that's the hardest change 

320.71 327.25 A: oh i'm sure i know probably a couple of weeks after it happened my kids were still you know paranoid 

327.25 338.37 A: and i'm like you know go do what you normally do and for the first time i can ever remember we seen the northern lights and didn't know what they were there was this huge pink glow and it just kept growing 

333.33 334.25 B: oh really 

338.55 342.75 A: and my oldest one's like mom i'm out of here i said well honey where you gonna go 

343.00 346.83 A: (( you know it's spreading i said there is nowhere you can go )) 

347.35 359.41 B: it does it does create fear i mean even my seven year old at the time he was only like six or seven and even he understood enough that it caused him fear i mean 'cause we came home and i said well we have to go to the store and he's like 

356.40 357.22 A: yeah 

359.32 366.99 B: i don't want to go you know they might bomb something or they might hit something with an airplane i said what are they going to do run an airplane into your school [laughter] 

366.36 370.31 A: i know people at my husband's work that were building bomb shelters and i'm like 

371.32 373.17 A: are you all crazy [laughter] 

373.49 378.52 A: you know what good is that gonna do you because if you survive 

378.73 381.64 A: how long is that bomb shelter gonna to sustain you 

381.56 383.43 B: yeah there's that well 

383.23 388.56 A: yeah i said you know if it's your time to go when you walk out you're going you know [laughter] 

388.43 401.58 B: see my husband at the time had a job where he drove all over the philadelphia area into new jersey and then into delaware and sometimes down into maryland down near d._c. and he refused to go down there to d._c. 

397.67 398.63 A: uh-huh 

401.47 402.62 A: (( well i don't blame )) 

402.50 407.20 B: but he he was he called me that day because i was actually the one that told him where to go 

407.49 409.95 B: 'cause that wa- uh that was my job 

409.92 411.27 A: right 

410.08 417.88 B: and we work for the same company and he called me and he said one more plane hits i'm gonna i'm leaving i'm coming home and i said what are they gonna hit 

418.22 425.11 B: i said it's the philadelphia area what are they gonna do fly something into the into the liberty bell i said they don't want that kind of stuff 

424.77 428.80 A: yeah exactly i wouldn't want to uh you know i wouldn't even visit 

429.03 430.84 A: d._c. or new york 

430.90 432.91 A: now i wouldn't do that 

432.41 438.87 B: i wouldn't visit them in the first place so it's not that's not a change i mean i wouldn't visit them in the first place 

434.12 436.56 A: i well i wouldn't either [laughter] 

438.42 441.46 A: you get me off a four lane highway and i'm lost 

440.88 442.36 B: (( [laughter] yeah [laughter] )) 

441.49 448.23 A: and i visited d._c. when i was in high school and it's like six or eight lanes there [laughter] there's no way 

448.21 456.52 B: my biggest thing was when i was twenty one i went to hawaii and i my husband and we came across country and at that time it would have been a little scary 

456.39 457.31 A: right 

456.72 458.93 B: wouldn't bother me to go across country now 

458.72 467.47 A: no i don't think i would fly though i am still a little paranoid on that part but i didn't enjoy the flight to begin with the last one i took so 

463.54 464.47 B: yeah 

467.36 481.07 B: well do you know what the first time i ever flew i was twenty one years old and i was like oh this is awesome and when it started taking off oh the speed and then we got up in the air and i started getting a little scared but i was sitting next to a guy who he was like a business traveler and he started talking to me and calming me down 

478.27 479.27 A: yeah 

481.11 482.41 B: (( but [laughter] )) 

482.40 484.62 A: i did i don't even i don't i'm 

484.87 486.02 A: claustrophobic 

486.75 491.13 A: so we flew back me and my son flew from hawaii straight back ten hours 

491.03 492.45 B: oh my god 

491.69 498.46 A: i was just like phew get me off this thing let me i'm real tall and let me stretch my legs [laughter] and have a cigarette 

497.99 504.31 B: you know that's got to be terrible for people that are claustrophobic now because of the the u._s. marshalls that are some of these flights 

504.42 505.28 A: (( oh like )) 

504.48 510.16 B: i mean 'cause you get you start to go a little nuts and the u._s. marshalls start looking at ya [laughter] [laughter] 

508.64 518.45 A: yeah [laughter] i didn't go nuts i'm like i'm breathing i'm like i just got to get off this you know there's nowhere to walk around you can't just really get up and stroll 

518.01 519.33 B: no you can't 

518.83 523.41 A: i don't even ride down the road i don't care if it's thirty below my window's cracked 

523.49 529.88 A: you know i'm getting out or i tell my husband i said if we ever go to hawaii 'cause he didn't get to go that time i said we're cruising 

530.08 530.95 B: (( you know )) 

530.15 532.42 A: i can get out and get some open air 

532.04 534.55 B: i don't think i'd let my kids fly right now 

534.71 538.10 A: no i don't i don't think flying's a great idea 

537.80 541.17 B: no i don't think that's a great idea i mean the only place we go 

542.23 550.02 B: the only thing that uh we go is my parents life in pittsburgh and when my stepbrother died we flew over there they paid for the flight 

545.81 546.83 A: mhm 

550.09 554.54 A: i enjoy a car trip better anyway you can see so much more 

553.91 558.41 B: well it was me alone with three kids and one of them was only four months old [laughter] 

557.26 563.72 A: hey there's a trick to car trips with kids you leave after midnight and they sleep most of the way [laughter] 

563.03 564.16 B: but uh 

564.21 569.91 B: i don't think i would let them fly now i don't think i'd go anywhere with them flying that's about the only thing that that has changed

571.63 573.34 B: (( but )) 

572.54 574.37 A: don't think i could do that 

574.28 577.98 B: the the other thing is my oldest one's scared of flying anyway 

578.18 585.28 B: 'cause when we went over for my stepbrother's funeral i mean we encountered the whole state of pennsylvania was in like a storm 

585.14 586.11 A: mm 

585.29 593.26 B: and the plane kept hitting turbulence and he he's got his hands up in front of his face please don't let the plane fall please don't let the plane fall 

593.34 595.96 B: [laughter] so he's scared of flying anyway 

595.69 599.89 A: on our last leg we had to lay over in st louis before we came to
