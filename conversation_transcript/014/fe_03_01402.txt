89.61 96.38 A: yeah so it's uh not real good but i really and it was funny because that they brought this topic up and i'm 

96.39 105.82 A: i'm thinking oh boy i'd better i'd better do some so i'm fifty four so i think i'd better you know like not wait too much longer and get busy 

100.76 101.71 B: uh-huh 

105.94 117.55 B: well even if you just walk um or go to a place like um my dad lives in new york and he goes to um uh a lake and walks around the lake and you know just to uh to gotta get your heart going 

114.08 115.13 A: yeah 

116.00 117.01 A: yeah but i'm 

117.83 127.81 A: i'm in a popular well you know but then that's another thing i was telling someone i said you know um it's like um madonna there she used to do all that cardio 

127.50 128.45 B: mhm 

127.76 139.93 A: and then she just quit doing cardio and she started to do um uh yoga and and uh you know she's still in great shape and i i 

140.41 143.92 A: said well you know all you have to do is look at cats 

144.06 146.82 A: because a cat really doesn't 

147.05 148.08 A: (( you know )) 

148.49 153.32 A: move around too fast all that often they do a lot of stretching 

152.88 154.53 B: right right 

153.86 155.24 A: so uh 

155.26 158.34 A: you know and that would be easy but it's just uh 

158.43 159.72 A: i don't know some 

160.14 161.39 A: get off my 

161.90 163.82 B: it's good to go with a partner 

163.91 170.33 A: well but you see my my where i live right now it's um a population of one 

170.50 174.16 B: oh [laughter] that's hard to find a partner 

172.50 173.17 A: (( [laughter] )) 

173.53 181.69 A: [laughter] yeah well right now if you had it takes me i the next town over is like 

174.43 175.92 B: [laughter] 

182.08 190.26 A: where there's people but and there's only a thousand people there um it's twenty miles and it takes me an hour 

189.99 191.30 B: oh wow 

190.74 191.73 A: no 

192.04 200.54 A: usually it's not that long but it's in the spring when there you've got snow running and pot holes and stuff so it'll take an hour to get there 

200.26 201.39 B: oh 

200.86 212.48 A: and um so you know you just you know it's a little bit prohibitive like an hour there and an hour back and and the time that you would spend and i have uh 

208.25 209.97 B: right right 

212.61 213.62 A: um 

213.91 215.68 A: inherited uh 

216.60 227.09 A: two dogs and i have one of my own so [laughter] yeah well that that's for sure yeah uh that's that's for sure once the 

219.35 221.26 B: do you walk the dogs 

227.96 230.85 A: for a little while i can walk the dogs soon 

231.61 236.53 A: but then it there comes a time when there's black flies here 

236.08 237.86 B: oh yeah 

237.10 239.86 A: yeah and you know what black flies are uh-huh 

238.84 240.60 B: yes yes 

239.89 251.65 A: and i wasn't born and raised here and it's really um they they just they love and i i get really um a bad reaction to them 

251.69 254.85 A: so i have to stay in when they're out and 

254.82 258.13 B: you need a stationary bike [laughter] 

256.77 262.49 A: about well actually you know what i was thinking and i was looking to see maybe if somebody had um 

262.58 264.97 A: uh had bought a um 

265.26 267.34 A: uh treadmill 

267.20 268.12 B: uh-huh 

267.80 271.21 A: yeah i i just didn't wanna pay that much for uh 

270.61 271.32 B: does 

271.52 276.29 B: uh we have like used newspapers and stuff you know where people sell their used things 

275.73 280.17 A: yeah but again there i have the same problem with having to go 

276.75 277.53 B: (( to )) 

279.94 281.35 B: go get it 

280.69 292.67 A: to find you know to find one in the in the city and then to be able to go and get it so there's all kinds of challenges but there i mean there's no excuse really i my son has 

291.06 294.65 B: i was just going to say there's all kinds of excuses [laughter] 

293.11 294.12 A: yeah 

294.17 301.50 A: yeah there's all kinds of excuses but they're really not good ones uh the thing is is that my son has has um has 

301.71 304.25 A: left he's not here now 

304.17 318.21 A: and he left his bowflex here so i could be doing that yeah oh yeah they they it is cool i did use it for a little while at one point and i just really need to get back into it because i um the bowflex works on 

306.02 307.79 B: oh that's nice 

308.01 309.26 B: that's cool 

312.82 313.79 B: uh-huh 

318.22 325.06 A: pretty well the same principle as the um as yoga in a lot of ways except that uh you know like 

323.88 325.42 B: because it's passive 

325.24 329.55 A: yeah yeah it's because it's resistance training really 

328.90 330.33 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

330.18 331.31 A: so 

330.60 333.39 B: i don't have any equipment i have a thigh master 

333.65 337.92 B: and i use that [laughter] sometimes and then um 

333.85 334.89 A: (( [laughter] )) 

338.04 339.60 B: and then i um 

340.75 351.10 B: let's see what else do i do oh i have stairs in my home so i'm constantly running up and down the stairs so that's that helps but i ride my bike mostly and i watch sunsets so that's pretty cool 

344.44 345.47 A: yeah 

346.61 347.59 A: yeah 

350.76 356.21 A: i think so that sounds that sounds well are you uh out in the country more or 

355.57 369.82 B: i'm by the west coast of um on the on the coast by the shoreline by tampa bay area yeah so it's it's pretty cool and uh it's usually nice all the time sometimes it gets blazingly hot and i'm near a little trail 

362.06 363.33 A: oh really 

370.15 379.75 B: that they made here um which is uh i can get to town on my on the trail which is good it's three miles so if i have errands that are three miles or less 

379.86 381.33 B: i ride the bike 

381.03 382.28 A: (( ah )) 

381.55 384.57 B: so if i go to the post office or library or 

383.86 386.22 A: yeah where you don't have to carry a lot of things 

385.25 392.40 B: right if i don't have to go grocery shopping you know um but then then um then i try to ride my bike there 

391.52 394.21 A: oh do you work out of home or 

394.01 399.49 B: i i um am an independent contractor so i have varied hours i have a lot of free time 

398.90 399.94 A: you're a what 

399.67 403.12 B: independ- uh i'm a self employed independent contractor 

402.86 403.91 A: for 

403.64 414.50 B: uh i just do like product demonstration and i sell magazines at trade shows and stuff so i do a lot of different things so i have a lot of free time to do that and plus um 

410.02 411.53 A: oh neat 

414.72 429.62 B: i save these marlboro milds and what i have i don't smoke so i have to go out and walk and find them on the street [laughter] so in order to get all the free gifts i have to uh i have to get out there and hustle my butt to try to find 'em so 

421.30 423.97 A: [laughter] 

428.92 432.20 A: oh it might it's probably getting a little harder now eh 

432.08 435.77 B: um well actually you would think that people would be 

435.80 437.80 B: like slowing down on smoking 

438.09 444.34 B: ah but they're not uh sometimes i find in the matter of just like walking around i'll find like um 

444.45 451.25 B: seven to ten packs like just walking around in a half hour i can't i can't i couldn't even smoke this much you know if i wanted to 

450.31 457.84 A: you know it's amazing why aren't they saving them to you know if they're smoking that much why aren't they saving them to get those gifts 

457.28 466.71 B: i know i don't understand it and people save 'em for me and i say um why don't you save 'em yourselves it's too much trouble i say but yeah but you're saving 'em for me so what difference does it make 

459.12 459.78 A: (( no )) 

466.28 467.61 A: yeah 

467.13 468.05 B: (( but )) 

467.73 469.73 A: well needs will be [laughter] 

469.09 471.05 B: (( i know at least they save 'em so )) 

470.39 471.46 A: (( yeah )) 

471.15 475.48 B: so that's good but i you know it's it's funny because i'm pretty much health conscious 

475.58 476.83 B: and um 

477.25 479.17 B: i have to swear i'm a smoker 

479.65 485.39 B: [laughter] and people are like you don't smoke and i'm like i know i just like the free stuff 

484.96 486.84 A: well for sure that's uh 

486.86 489.30 A: kind of a neat thing to do i think 

488.65 491.04 B: yeah it's it's pretty cool 

490.76 491.91 A: yeah 

491.10 497.66 B: it's pretty cool now that i'm on page saying that i'd swear that i'm a smoker and i'm not [laughter] 

495.33 500.39 A: oh [laughter] i don't know i kinda wonder what their uh 

500.96 510.87 A: if it's just to see but you know anybody that i would think anybody had that response to this i've only had where it was kinda awkward one time 

510.46 511.41 B: uh-huh 

511.69 512.81 A: (( um )) 

513.14 515.12 A: and i think i was called 

516.01 520.09 A: two times before all of the calls that i've had tonight 

519.52 520.47 B: uh-huh 

520.09 528.85 A: and i've only think i have you know so people who are going to do this kind of thing are really the kind of people who you know i don't know about you but i'm one of those people who 

528.76 536.82 A: um if if i'm in a bus station or wherever if somebody's standing i'll start up a conversation 

536.30 538.01 B: i'm pretty much like that too 

537.44 542.09 A: yeah so i would think that most of the people that responded to this type of uh 

542.16 545.76 A: program you know would be that way too 

545.19 546.10 B: uh-huh 

546.52 551.61 A: i can't see anybody that doesn't like talking on the phone saying oh yeah okay i'll do that 

551.14 552.46 B: yeah right 

551.82 553.74 A: so it it would 

553.36 557.17 B: it's hard to talk about exercise for ten minutes it seems like um 

557.50 558.68 A: well 

557.76 558.65 B: (( um )) 

558.89 562.23 A: i i i spent quite a bit of time talking to one 

562.30 567.07 A: one young girl that i was talking to was a uh jazz teacher 

566.62 567.47 B: mhm 

567.24 568.89 A: jazz dance teacher 

568.32 569.44 B: oh cool 

569.17 572.22 A: and yeah i thought so and uh 

572.47 580.94 A: so um and then i was having a conversation i got cut off and i'm thinking boy that guy's probably wondering um what 

581.27 587.53 A: i i was gonna say next because he was having trouble with his back and i was telling him about um 

582.99 583.76 B: (( [laughter] )) 

587.63 588.74 A: uh 

588.78 590.88 A: dr wallich 

591.11 592.88 A: dead doctors don't lie 

592.59 593.76 B: uh-huh 

593.37 594.84 A: and uh 

594.94 599.89 A: and i think i'd just barely got wallich's name out and we got cut off
