8.87 10.46 A: oh fine and you 

10.13 17.45 B: okay this is my first time doing this so uh i guess uh you kind of just if you want to start me off and 

11.14 12.52 A: good 

16.76 25.92 A: uh-huh this is my second yeah um so the topic is changes that you've made in your life since september eleventh 

25.67 27.68 B: yes that sounds correct 

27.13 28.23 A: uh-huh 

28.65 29.68 A: (( mm )) 

29.89 37.50 A: i'm not sure if there've been definite changes i mean physical changes 

37.90 40.84 A: that i've made in my life um 

41.48 47.83 A: although i i guess i'm very aware of just kind of a new 

47.98 56.29 A: philosophy or ideology out in the world in the country that uh i'm starting to pick up that 

56.61 60.36 A: um i i think there are a lot of people who are 

60.43 64.68 A: defining their life before and after september eleventh 

64.90 79.00 B: yeah i think that's pretty true i've kinda come across that myself with a lot of people that um you know i've spoken to i know my husband and i we've had a baby since september eleventh and i can't honestly say that that was my reasoning 

78.85 91.83 B: but i think you know in our case we had met so many other people while i was pregnant that decided to expand their family get married you know there was like these huge lifestyle changes and um 

91.79 99.93 B: um it was something that we had planned on anyway but i think people tried to make like a more positive uh outlook in their own lives and um 

100.11 105.28 B: you know because they felt so much loss for all the other people that lost family and and so on 

105.62 106.56 B: um 

106.23 106.97 A: mm 

106.92 117.98 B: and there ju- there's so much going on on the television and things that people say they've made total lifestyle changes i don't i mean i can't honestly say i have other than having the baby 

107.04 108.66 A: that 

117.82 132.74 B: um and again i don't know that it's directly related i just feel like um you know those of us who have had children and so on feel more fortunate you know to have an expanding family and um you know that that we really feel sorry for all the people that had a loss 

133.24 134.46 B: per se 

134.14 143.08 A: mhm yeah i can't say that i've met anyone who's made a a real lifestyle change you know because of that 

143.18 154.03 A: that actually sur- i mean i've heard that but i think you've explained it to me better that they feel like they've got to make you know positive changes in their live 

154.15 155.20 A: um 

155.66 158.03 A: what is kind of a 

158.18 159.65 A: reaction 

159.38 171.08 B: i guess you know i think some people think like you know they realize life is short life can be short um shorter than expected and you know i guess all the people that are doing so much hesitating in their lives 

165.07 166.12 A: (( mhm )) 

171.21 183.59 B: look at september eleventh and say you know what am i doing in my li- you know have i done everything up to this point that i really wanted to do you know is there anything in my life that i'm holding back 

183.43 195.44 B: doing and you know i mean i've actually heard people make comments you know where they're like oh i haven't travelled enough i haven't done this and no- not to say that they're turning their whole life around but i think they're trying to look at 

195.21 210.08 B: you know the fact that there were so many young people it's just such an unexpected thing that you know can they say in their own lives yes you know i've i've done all every minute of every day with my family in the way that i wanted to and so on 

209.91 211.27 A: mhm 

210.04 216.15 B: you know but i don't know that there is like i said huge lifestyle complete changes um 

216.21 219.90 A: yeah i'm wow i mean that that kind of thinking 

220.16 221.27 A: um 

221.31 230.56 A: i i just can't apply it to myself at all you know like that kind of event would then turn me to think um oh well life's short mm 

230.81 232.50 A: you know i don't think that 

232.61 239.87 A: um anything similar is going to happen to me and my life's not any longer or shorter so i've 

240.11 241.51 A: kept on living 

241.55 244.73 A: pretty much you know the way i was before 

244.31 254.94 B: right right i i guess like for me i know um right after it happened a group of friends and i went up to new york probably about three or four weeks after the tragedy and 

254.71 261.24 B: there was just a sense of you know you you came off the subway and there was all these pictures around and there were so many people 

261.22 276.01 B: staring and grieving and you know i have family that that lived up there not that i knew anyone directly that was in the building but they say you know that like i guess i came home with like a sense of wow you know there was so much loss and 

275.90 285.05 B: you know i have to just i i think like oh my god none of those people knew that that was going to happen that day but you know it it i guess it was just such a large event 

284.86 297.70 B: it really opened your eyes because it's so publicized even though in every day life things happen where like you're sad you're not like oh okay there was a car accident up the street or this or that and i'm not going to turn my whole life around because of one incident but 

297.90 312.46 B: you know i guess you figure there's so many young pe- young old every age it [mn] like discriminate discriminating against no one you know when it did happen and and with the war going on right now i guess you just don't know every day you're like oh my goodness you know 

312.24 315.59 B: i send my daughter to school and there could be [noise] snipers 

317.08 318.08 B: hello

318.34 319.61 B: i'm sorry 

319.45 330.21 B: um they send um you know bags of food with the kids just in case they end up going into lock down and i guess you know i have people out there other parents and stuff that are just paranoid 

329.97 339.51 B: um i don't feel in that sense that i'm i'm going to stop living you know and i'm not going to let my child um you know do different things because of what what occurred
