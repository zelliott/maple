159.08 160.03 B: yeah

170.21 171.12 A: uh-huh 

170.55 179.88 B: and it didn't really affect her travelling but then at home she felt a few days afterwards she felt she says i feel she says i think about it when 

179.77 194.76 B: when a plane flies over that it's gonna crash in my house or something [laughter] but she just bought a new house and that of course was the uppermost thing on her mind right there that she was um you know i mean save her house [laughter] 'cause she 

183.80 185.26 A: exactly 

195.00 199.46 B: that was her project for right after that and so she just kind of 

195.16 195.99 A: (( right )) 

196.55 197.54 A: right 

199.67 201.49 B: thought about um 

201.93 204.03 B: thought about that and she 

204.06 212.23 B: was ah she was a little scared on that but ah she's over it now and she's doing some travelling she's gone to the east 

212.53 213.62 B: but i 

213.69 223.45 B: [mn] i don't really care to travel too much and i thought well i don't need to travel i'm older and i don't need to travel and so i thought um 

223.67 227.50 B: i can go any place that i want to in my car [laughter] 

227.63 229.42 B: that's the way i felt about it 

229.00 232.43 A: i understand and after nine eleven 

232.86 235.50 A: we were i live in orlando 

235.25 236.31 B: mhm 

235.65 242.42 A: and we were struck by the ssilence of no planes 'cause i'm right in the flight path for orlando airport 

238.95 240.02 B: oh 

242.06 243.16 B: mhm 

242.78 246.41 A: so it was a little strange all those quiet nights 

246.17 252.45 B: oh yeah i never thought about that i never thought about that we had a lot of um 

248.78 249.88 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

252.91 262.27 B: ah planes up in the air you know like taking off from um we don't have a major airport right here but um there's um 

262.88 266.71 B: a the reserve air force reserve is out there 

266.73 273.44 B: and we seem to have [mn] heard a lot of planes taking off you know in the morning and then 

273.47 274.76 B: coming back 

274.88 278.86 B: and and that seemed a little strange that there were 

278.98 280.18 B: more 

280.27 283.22 B: um air force planes around 

282.83 283.91 A: yes 

283.95 285.23 B: (( you know )) 

286.52 293.84 B: i think that i was more affected by the war rather than nine eleven i felt because i really felt 

294.02 300.36 B: um people close to me went to the war but the terrorists um 

300.44 305.27 B: i really wasn't that worried about terrorists even in this in 

305.59 308.92 B: um i live in salem oregon and the ah 

309.23 311.10 B: the state capitol 

311.12 312.97 B: someone called and they 

313.71 327.97 B: took everybody out of the state capitol at one time a couple of days afterwards you know like someone cr- probably a crank call or something but i mean we were always looking at that are they going to be in my town [laughter] that's what we really looked at 

325.95 327.01 A: exactly 

327.68 332.04 A: yeah i understand that and especially like in orlando 

332.09 338.28 A: they were worried about disney and things like that the big tourist attractions 

334.85 335.84 B: uh-huh 

337.71 343.92 B: oh yeah did they close down disney you know for a few days or anything or 

341.21 342.99 A: ah no i don't 

343.43 344.92 A: i don't believe so 

344.65 346.02 B: (( oh uh-huh )) 

345.71 347.86 A: but they did keep their eye out 

348.63 351.54 A: and they even have a lot of security now 

351.75 352.81 B: oh 

353.12 354.94 A: you know just in case 

354.45 355.46 B: uh-huh 

356.37 357.39 B: well 

357.79 361.39 B: what i was concerned that 

361.86 363.49 B: i really 

364.15 374.02 B: i even feel this now that the terrorists in in how can they really stop them if they want to get in there and why 

374.10 378.94 B: why if they had heard about nine you know what was going to happen 

379.11 382.50 B: why didn't the f._b._i. do something i mean it's like 

382.68 386.48 B: oh yeah you know i mean [laughter] 

385.98 394.07 A: well to me we have so many targets in the united states it would be hard to pinpoint what was going to happen 

394.09 395.66 B: yeah that's true 

395.91 396.88 A: i mean 

396.61 397.34 B: (( mhm )) 

397.15 400.81 A: and who ever would have believed that the pentagon would have been hit 

400.54 401.53 B: mhm 

402.18 403.64 A: that was a shocker 

404.16 406.41 B: that's true um 

406.15 407.17 A: and my 

406.51 410.80 B: what they thought that y- you know was that our first attack for the 

411.73 413.99 B: that they had on 

414.24 418.51 B: the the twin towers don't really mean that to- much to me 

418.27 419.14 A: uh-huh 

418.75 420.73 B: they don't i didn't 

421.00 424.00 B: but they must mean so much 

424.03 428.03 B: different in other cultures that this is a towering 

428.13 433.77 B: um place that you know represents the united states 

434.33 448.79 B: everything about our culture and everything and finance and but they didn't realise that there were so many other different cultures in that building you know because it didn't just affect new yorkers it affected people that were 

449.44 453.04 B: there ah from all other countries 

453.06 458.57 A: exactly i mean i think there was like a hundred and three countries involved or 

458.03 459.01 B: uh-huh 

459.28 461.86 A: and that was amazing even to me [noise] 

461.59 462.60 B: mhm 

462.12 465.00 A: to realise that that that many [noise] people 

465.36 466.51 A: worked there 

466.64 471.31 B: but i've never been to new york so i really didn't y- you know just 

471.37 472.32 B: um 

472.72 479.53 B: but how big those buildings were that's what really hit y- you know and i'm thinking wow you know [laughter] 

479.93 484.81 B: and how many tourists were there to see that and y- you know [noise] there was 

484.94 489.09 B: a few other people that i knew that was in new york [noise] at that time and [noise] 

489.81 493.81 B: is it clicky [laughter] i don't know what that means 

491.04 492.00 A: yes 

493.30 494.78 A: i don't know either 

494.23 500.48 B: [laughter] this is my first call so i don't know what hap- you know i was just surprised today that they even called 

500.62 501.99 A: i was 

502.03 506.40 A: surprised also today that they called this is my first one also 

506.10 514.59 B: uh-huh so i guess we're just supposed to make conversation and and keep it going until they ask us to stop but i was um 

510.93 511.88 A: yes 

515.97 520.66 B: some people that i knew that had travelled to new york and of course they had 

521.01 527.45 B: ah quite a few delays most of them were on business or something like that but they were not affected um 

527.90 531.23 B: just by plane delays that's all 

531.25 535.58 B: and to come back to um to oregon 

535.71 537.21 B: but um 

538.28 542.61 B: you know it really to me it's it's a little far away 

542.80 543.80 A: mhm 

543.10 547.44 B: um i guess i was more um 

547.55 556.56 B: geared to my home and my home ah place and terrorists around and of course my daughter who does do travelling in her work 

556.62 560.73 B: and that's how it really affected me 

560.87 567.16 B: um and of course feeling so you know really bad for everybody that was in there and that's 

565.31 566.32 A: right 

567.18 568.72 B: about the sum of it 

567.24 571.98 A: i was affected immediately afterwards because my cousin worked in the pentagon 

572.22 574.28 B: oh oh my 

573.29 581.26 A: so we were worried about her for a few days but she turned out to be okay she'd transferred out of that office a week ag- before
