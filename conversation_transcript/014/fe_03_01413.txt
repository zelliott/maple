0.96 2.90 A: hi my name's diane 

2.50 4.32 B: hi i'm theresa 

4.16 5.17 A: uh-huh 

5.62 12.04 A: uh what kind of changes have you uh made i mean we haven't been on an airplane since then [laughter] 

12.83 14.61 B: for a long time [laughter] 

14.16 16.59 A: no not since september eleventh 

16.16 29.68 B: yeah i don't actually fly that much but i don't think i would fly now knowing what i know about september eleventh and i know i'm a lot more cautious when i go out to the store kinda looking at you know different things and people and just kinda 

29.78 32.61 B: you know being more aware of my surroundings 

32.35 33.65 A: mhm 

32.92 35.41 B: i don't know if you're like that too [laughter] 

34.77 47.37 A: well yeah i think i've tried to caution my family and stuff to be aware and uh to go ahead and tell people you know if you if something's suspicious go ahead and report it [laughter] 

46.86 50.09 B: yeah for real you notice any little thing you 

48.14 49.28 A: so 

49.70 53.12 A: yeah well do you live in a big city or 

50.72 51.45 B: (( know )) 

52.47 56.02 B: oh i actually live in columbus ohio so 

55.24 56.21 A: uh-huh 

56.11 60.36 B: there's about i'm thinking two million people here so 

60.24 61.45 A: yeah 

60.56 66.27 B: and we have a uh large community of like somalian's and stuff that live here too so 

66.61 67.48 B: um 

67.78 69.58 B: i'm always leery 

69.88 81.60 B: with different things like that i mean not necessarily people in general but you know you're just always watching out i hate i hate to say this but i feel like i'm more cautious of arab looking people 

81.30 82.62 A: sure 

81.58 90.88 B: because of september eleventh and i ha- you know i don't want to stereotype anybody but it makes me feel bad 'cause it's like i don't know for sure do you have a bomb you know 

90.68 100.86 A: sure well i i live in kansas city and i know that prior to september eleventh that they had had a convention here and they were talking about 

99.90 102.10 B: (( [laughter] )) 

100.81 106.44 A: you know being against the u._s. and stuff here and i think they even uh 

106.81 121.53 A: you know had like um things over their head so that people couldn't identify 'em and stuff and and then you know here we are in the middle of the country and you know it's not on the coast like you think that would be more vulnerable but 

112.59 113.69 B: [noise] really 

120.61 122.55 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

121.51 124.78 A: i just think it shows that we're not invincible 

124.39 133.63 B: that's true i think that's that's probably the main thing for me that that really changed was you know here i thought well we're above all that kinda you know 

134.66 136.03 B: we are 

136.09 136.97 B: um 

138.00 146.35 B: we don't notice you know they can't touch us kinda thing 'cause we're away from those borders of all those other people i guess i kinda thought 

146.13 147.39 A: right 

146.65 149.20 B: and now it's like you look at it and you go 

149.48 159.53 B: oh my gosh they could have you know they can do this to us from all the way over there they were thinking about this all the time and i think it also makes me think about that um 

160.04 164.15 B: in a way we are more money driven than a lot of countries 

164.73 174.01 B: because you know those guys that took those uh classes to fly those planes into buildings they basically um 

174.41 178.94 B: you know they didn't even check their references or anything they just said oh you got the cash okay come on 

178.70 179.89 A: sure 

179.47 181.75 B: and when i thought about it that way i'm like 

181.79 193.96 B: you know where did we go from being i realize you need to trust people but come on we're talking about somebody who could probably fork out like twenty or thirty thousand dollars all at once and nobody even asked a question like where are you getting this cash 

193.82 201.71 A: right and then there's like that james woods that saw those guys on the plane and alerted authorities and 

198.96 199.80 B: yeah 

201.31 203.48 B: (( and they did nothing you know [laughter] )) 

201.76 202.73 A: you know 

202.76 212.13 A: but i think you know their element of surprises has been given up as far as that's concerned but then i know that they've trained as far as 

212.17 214.06 A: um you know 

214.21 214.77 B: (( [noise] )) 

214.36 223.90 A: driving big trucks and that kind of thing so you know it's like i've noticed i've gone down the highway and you know you wanna look at people to see if they look like 'em 

216.70 218.05 B: yeah that's true 

222.16 222.94 B: yeah 

223.56 226.80 B: [laughter] if they look that category yep 

224.05 226.72 A: or muslim or something like that 

227.15 240.84 A: and i you know and i think too what has changed is i get really mad when the celebrities talk out about you know what the government's trying to do and you know how it's 

238.97 241.04 B: oh me too girl [laughter] 

240.90 248.62 A: i mean i i am willing to accept a little bit of infringement on my privacy for my safety 

248.02 252.15 B: i am too i i totally agree with you there i think 

251.14 252.46 A: mhm 

252.27 259.13 B: you know and i hate the way that they stand out as if they cornered the market on knowledge when it comes to stuff like that you know 

259.00 260.21 A: right 

259.56 264.65 B: you're like you're an actor what do you know about foreign policy you know [laughter] 

263.79 266.52 A: yeah i mean have you been there and 

265.64 267.36 B: exactly 

266.69 273.49 A: you know and then i look at the news and i see that you know of course there's going to be some people that don't 

273.56 282.09 A: want salot uh saddam out of out of power but you know then again he was terrible to his own people 

281.63 286.92 B: yeah that was just i mean even to know that he was that close to what hitler was like 

286.79 287.96 A: yeah 

287.32 297.50 B: just says to me we should have done this you know a long time ago back in the eighties when we had the chance we should've or back in the early nineties we should have got rid of him then [laughter] 

292.84 294.15 A: mhm 

297.15 298.49 A: sure 

297.96 308.69 B: you know that's 'cause you know these poor people have suffered long enough and and i think that we need to take a look at it from september eleventh perspective there and say 

309.19 313.94 B: anyone of these countries hate us with a passion and they could do it again 

313.63 316.08 A: right 'cause they're raised to 

316.40 318.27 A: not like americans 

317.20 324.12 B: exactly i mean they they preach about it in their mosques and all that i mean we had no idea 

322.36 323.80 A: well you know 

324.04 326.33 A: i went um to 

324.22 325.60 B: [noise] 

326.85 333.70 A: before the war was in yugoslavia i went over there and that's where one of my grandmothers was from 

333.74 339.03 A: and i encountered when we went we were with a group and we went to a restaurant 

339.13 340.50 A: and 

340.73 353.60 A: i know there were different pictures on the wall and they're like are you americans we're like yes you know and they're like oh we won't serve you and you know that was first time i had encountered that kind of anti americanism 

348.57 349.51 B: oh 

353.16 354.33 B: wow 

353.65 357.88 A: and so now i see it on t._v. and i think 

358.16 362.56 A: i really can understand you know 

363.08 369.18 A: what happening on the news and stuff that they that they'll just top that and you know they didn't know us and 

368.84 375.19 B: yeah like i mean they've learned that from a very early age i guess if you were kinda i'm gonna say the words programmed 

374.96 376.11 A: uh-huh 

375.24 382.49 B: to believe that then you would probably do that as well i mean if that's your nature that's what you gonna end up being 

378.96 380.17 A: sure 

382.44 387.71 A: but you know i've gone to europe only a couple a couple of times and 

388.01 389.79 A: my dad has um 

389.90 390.95 A: well my 

391.21 404.99 A: she was my grandma's first cousin so i guess it's first cousin once removed from my dad and and she's in austria and you know i'd like to gone to visit her but with this climate i don't think that i'm as willing to do so and 

393.43 394.32 B: [noise] 

404.48 405.73 B: [noise] 

405.12 410.87 A: and i know like i have a niece who wanted to go over to spain and you just think well that that's not wise to do 

410.56 411.99 B: yeah that's true 

411.78 412.92 A: so 

413.17 421.30 A: i mean that's what i changed mainly my travel plans and i think i'm watching like fox news a lot more and that kind of thing 

420.05 424.85 B: oh yeah i [laughter] i watch fox news too you're so funny [laughter] 

422.28 423.62 A: [laughter] 

424.22 433.04 A: well and you know then i i mean it would just seem so blatant how a lot of the other news channels were trying to mak- you know 

433.35 436.08 A: have negative news and you know 

436.14 442.76 A: focus on the negative things that happened instead it you know it was going relatively well over there 

436.14 436.99 B: yeah 

442.11 447.58 B: exactly and then of course the one thing they said was like about those relics that we 

447.48 457.75 B: destroyed and everything you know it's like you don't consider the fact that we freed all these people from an oppressive dictatorship you just automatically assume that now we've ruined 

449.76 450.95 A: right 

457.70 462.76 B: a a pot from civilizations beginning you know what i mean give me a break 

460.51 474.44 A: right and we didn't do it it was the you know their own people and you know we didn't allow it to happen it happened is what i think and um you know so i think it's changed my attitude 

463.02 464.00 B: no 

465.20 467.26 B: (( they blew up their own oil )) 

469.51 470.36 B: yeah 

474.03 475.86 B: yeah i i agree with you 

475.72 483.48 A: [laughter] a lot but uh i mean mainly it's like travel and i mean i haven't really done that uh 

476.73 477.75 B: [laughter] 

483.55 485.37 B: yeah i tend to stay closer 

483.63 491.15 A: i think like my husband works in a big building here and he's more concerned about his safety and that kind of stuff 

491.00 498.56 B: yeah i actually came home to be a stay at home mom after all that happened too because i realized i wanted to spend more time with my family 

491.20 492.09 A: and it's 

498.21 500.31 A: well that's great 

499.92 502.71 B: and uh just did not want to be 

502.79 506.83 B: away 'cause if something would happen to one of 'em what would i do kinda thing you know 

506.20 507.35 A: sure 

507.37 517.47 A: well my husband's work uh they've increased the security and stuff i used to work there i used to be able to just go in there and and now there's no way i would be able to do that 

517.00 518.96 B: i don't blame ya i mean 

518.07 528.06 A: sort of you know well they won't let you either and you know i can't even go in the garage and that kind of stuff where whereas before i was able to do that type of thing 

527.75 537.15 B: yeah my aunt actually works for the defense department kind of and um they they pretty much process all the money that the military's gonna make 

531.46 532.51 A: uh-huh 

537.14 545.57 B: uh for all the war stuff you know dishing it out and everything and that's that's what happened with them they have certain codes and if they come in after september eleventh 

545.59 550.26 B: they can't certain people can't even be in the building only military personnel 

549.82 551.81 A: oh my goodness yeah 

550.66 555.10 B: yeah so if she doesn't have that clearance she's not even allowed in to go to work that day 

554.82 556.48 A: oh well that's something 

556.10 557.11 B: yeah 

557.00 558.95 A: but i don't know i mean 

558.96 567.09 A: has anything changed for you besides like maybe your eating habits or attitudes or traveling maybe just being more alert 

566.86 568.66 B: yeah definitely more alert 

568.57 570.03 A: yeah 

569.67 577.07 B: just more aware of surroundings kinda watching different people when you go places now that you might not have watched before that kind of thing for me 

576.16 588.84 A: mhm i mean i don't have arab neighbit- neighbors but you know we did have a friend and you know he's divorced from this girl i work with and you wonder what all went on 

588.55 589.68 B: yeah 

589.10 599.32 A: you know in that relationship what caused them to break up i mean i think a lot of it is just cultural differences contribute to that but you know you just don't know 

593.50 594.06 B: (( [noise] )) 

595.20 596.33 B: yeah
