124.97 126.29 B: (( no ma'am )) 

133.23 140.82 A: um i i may think a little more about it but i do kinda keep my eyes open because i figured 

139.18 140.34 B: yes ma'am 

140.83 151.65 A: we're part of that area that those snipers or those um people might hide out until they do you know something major

155.73 156.97 B: yes ma'am

176.99 178.43 B: oh yes ma'am 

181.20 190.31 A: um a lot of things without having to worry about our own homeland so it's only logical that we um

190.49 192.42 A: you know that we need 

192.55 198.68 A: to be woke up we need to to be aware that that it can happen to us too 

194.07 195.26 B: (( yes ma'am )) 

199.23 206.56 A: um you know we don't know when someone might uh invade us and come and take um 

207.03 207.99 A: um 

208.69 210.71 A: you know take lives 

210.54 212.16 B: [noise] that's right 

211.48 215.42 A: as we have done and as we have seen done 

216.01 217.67 A: overseas so 

218.22 220.06 A: um you know we have to 

218.86 222.19 B: people in america don't realize how lucky they are 

221.45 223.25 A: (( that's right )) 

222.20 223.85 B: to live in america 

223.34 233.42 A: that's exactly right you know what they've talked about how fat the people are getting and things like that why because we are we are are 

229.28 231.15 B: (( [mn] yes ma'am [laughter] )) 

233.59 238.28 A: really secure in our little niche of the world i think it is 

236.44 237.79 B: (( [laughter] yes )) 

237.89 239.20 B: yes ma'am 

238.10 249.01 A: and um you know it's it i as far as i can see that's what i think september eleventh did for us is this it gave us all a real wake up call 

248.58 251.94 B: it did it really did it woke a lot of people up 

250.08 250.76 A: (( yep )) 

251.87 253.72 A: yes and uh 

252.83 264.54 B: because people thought you know ain't nothing gonna happen in america you know we're too secure but look what happened you know it proved that things can happen over here too 

259.38 260.79 A: that's right 

261.53 262.66 A: that's right 

264.31 266.34 A: that's absolutely right 

266.19 275.05 B: i mean we have more security than you know china or iraq or you know but that doesn't mean that um 

275.35 277.81 B: nothing's gonna happen in america 

277.39 284.04 A: no it did you know they they proved to us that um 

284.06 289.91 A: that we weren't secure enough you know we've always opened our borders to other people 

290.12 291.23 B: yes ma'am 

290.30 291.32 A: um 

291.78 305.69 A: look at how many have come through ellis island you know and not just ellis island i they've come through houston and everywhere else my ances- ancestors came over you know but it's it's we 

302.73 303.60 B: (( yes ma'am )) 

305.83 307.28 A: have have 

307.57 309.46 A: opened our arms 

309.48 321.56 A: so to speak to some of this now then we have to be aware that it can happen that that just because someone comes to this country doesn't mean they're all coming for the good 

321.15 323.66 B: that's right because there is bad here 

323.56 324.54 A: sure 

324.14 326.01 B: there is bad 

325.47 329.90 A: there's lots of it and there's there's lots of bad all over the world it's 

329.54 330.53 B: and 

330.82 343.79 B: people bring things from overseas over here just like what is it sours spoors the the disease or whatever just like that it came from china 

334.04 334.96 A: yep 

335.02 335.82 A: yep 

337.90 339.13 A: sars 

339.17 340.70 A: the sars yes 

341.07 341.97 A: right 

343.33 344.62 A: yeah 

344.01 347.14 B: and now it's in california and 

345.78 346.83 A: uh-huh 

347.84 348.86 B: it's all 

349.02 349.80 A: it's 

349.04 350.11 B: to the 

350.33 352.53 B: west of us [laughter] 

351.56 352.59 A: (( yep )) 

352.70 354.22 A: it's it's 

355.40 366.71 A: it is a problem and it is something that we you know we all have to face i thi- i think that we all all need to be woke up we all need to be aware of what's 

366.73 374.43 A: you know happening around us what um what is potential uh to happen around us 

373.98 375.16 B: (( yes ma'am )) 

374.92 382.98 A: um and i think i i think for the most part the peop- the people of the united states are prepared for that um 

381.76 382.89 B: (( yes ma'am )) 

384.00 385.48 A: you know you can't 

386.15 397.32 A: do anything without losing lives unfortunately you you know in these kind of situations they're usually dire enough that um 

389.27 390.47 B: (( that's right )) 

398.09 409.02 A: you're going to lose some life and just like we did on september eleventh and that's a that's the price that we all have to pay for you know for freedom 

400.96 401.94 B: (( yes ma'am )) 

408.85 415.82 B: yes ma'am what upsets me the most is um september eleventh it happened what two year ago 

415.23 418.16 A: mhm going on two years 

417.56 423.50 B: i wonder if like uh for instance if someone close to me had died in there 

423.36 433.85 B: you know in september eleventh i wonder if i wouldn't want to see it on t._v. all the time and i wouldn't wanna go through every single day seeing something about it on t._v. 

434.20 441.64 B: and all the tee shirts you have out there and the ribbons i just wonder if that makes people that lost loved ones 

436.81 437.54 A: (( uh-huh )) 

441.47 451.83 B: in september eleventh i just wonder if it affects them in any way if it brings 'em down if it helps raise their spirits do they know that they're helping other people 

451.99 453.50 A: yeah really 

452.15 454.28 B: see i wonder those things 

454.19 466.62 A: that is that's that's a very good question i i feel like if i had lost someone in september eleventh incident that i would have felt like they didn't die in vain 

466.89 470.04 A: that um you know that they they're 

470.09 472.57 A: like did serve a purpose 

473.21 474.15 A: um 

475.34 486.27 A: i you know i i feel like that that that's the way i look at those i look at every one of those people as a hero they died in protecting my freedom 

488.68 489.80 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

488.76 491.26 A: you know or died um 

491.99 495.00 A: because of we are a free people 

499.13 500.98 B: i've always wondered 

501.17 507.04 B: you know am i gonna live tomorrow and am i gonna live to see my children start to school 

506.97 508.10 A: mhm 

507.45 520.61 B: different things like that but like september eleventh them people had no idea that they were going to go in that building and you know had no idea and just think though i mean if that had of been like twelve o'clock in the afternoon 

511.23 512.52 A: no they 

513.61 514.37 A: (( yep )) 

520.21 521.29 A: (( yeah )) 

520.79 527.30 B: just think how many people would have been there because you know that wasn't even half the people that worked in them buildings [noise] 

523.74 524.60 A: yeah 

526.06 530.40 A: that's right yeah i don't know i i 

530.52 538.62 A: i guess maybe that's one more thing that has caused me it's not the only thing but i feel like september eleventh is one 

538.46 546.06 A: more of those things that taught me um how to um appreciate every day and to um 

546.14 551.72 A: to not live worrying about what will happen tomorrow to live for today 

551.44 552.64 B: (( that's right )) 

551.83 559.66 A: uh i've done that more as i as i age i think mat- part of that come with maturity but um 

559.85 567.64 A: um you know i don't i know that that things do happen in this world and that there are things beyond our control 

567.82 568.94 A: (( and )) 

570.16 583.42 A: god is the only one that knows what day i'm gonna die [laughter] you know so i that's kinda the way i look at it is is i'm gonna put that in his hands and hope that he takes me when it's time you know and that he does it in a painless way 

573.39 574.70 B: that's right 

580.57 581.95 B: that's right 

583.54 590.07 A: um other than that i don't i don't tend to think about um 

590.50 599.89 A: you know me driving out on the highway or and get hit by a car or any of those things there are ways i'd prefer not to go but i don't
