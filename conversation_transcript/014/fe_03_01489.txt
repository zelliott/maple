211.31 223.88 B: i always you know i understand you know freedom of speech and blah blah blah but sometimes i think they give a little too much detailed information on what we're doing or not doing [noise] 

223.07 226.33 A: (( you too many troop operations they would show you ))

262.10 263.26 A: (( levy you know )) 

262.38 269.42 B: [noise] right i know the the first probably week week and a half the t._v. was pretty much on c._n._n. all the time 

269.85 270.89 B: but 

271.52 277.90 B: and while it was more interesting than what i remember in any other war watching news coverage 

279.00 280.54 B: i you know 

281.13 287.56 B: it didn't really tell me anything more that was pertinent to me it was interesting to watch the embedded reporters 

287.63 288.70 B: but 

289.42 294.25 B: i'm sure that wasn't the whole picture it's [noise] just what they wanted us to see 

294.73 296.65 A: (( i saw a picture of )) 

296.72 300.04 A: (( him right after september eleven )) 

300.11 307.93 A: (( had happened he was he was walking out of a court room smiling because they'd they they were dropping charges against him and that's )) 

308.70 314.99 A: (( [noise] yeah yeah and there's a lot of other news stories that didn't get attention and you )) 

315.57 323.70 A: (( know it it also makes you wonder about the role [mn] that this country is going to follow because [mn] the initial reason that we went into iraq was because )) 

323.74 326.29 A: (( of the connection to september eleventh )) 

327.07 334.86 B: right september eleventh pretty much his political career was over regardless but it pretty much saved his personal life 

327.64 328.47 A: (( but now )) 

334.42 335.25 A: (( we've got [mn] )) 

335.77 339.29 A: (( now they're saying that it's more of a humanitarian )) 

339.63 341.87 A: (( thing that you know we're there )) 

342.21 348.08 A: (( to save the iraqi people but there's you know forty fifty other countries that have dictators )) 

349.57 354.38 A: (( you know are we supposed go in there and play peace keeper as well and if we don't all i )) 

354.82 361.53 A: (( know i was watching a little bit of news tonight and saw the iraqi people saying that we should either make their lives better )) 

361.83 364.83 A: (( today or get out and i think too many people )) 

366.12 370.73 A: (( expect in some of these foreign countries you know we command and have whatever the military action )) 

370.97 374.30 A: (( is and they expect their lives to be turned around by us a hundred per cent in )) 

374.73 375.96 A: (( a week or less )) 

374.87 400.71 B: (( [noise] )) 

402.97 403.85 B: (( right )) 

404.01 405.99 A: yeah and 

405.02 413.49 B: you know and they don't they think just because we did whatever we did that we accept full responsibility in the rebuilding of 

414.13 415.48 B: their country 

415.52 418.56 A: but see that's the other thing and that's partly why 

416.95 417.74 B: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

418.86 422.34 A: september eleventh happened was because you have resentment 

422.68 423.74 B: right 

422.73 430.19 A: especially in the middle east because we've helped israel so much and israel is not liked over there 

430.61 431.61 B: right 

430.81 438.53 A: you've got a strong muslim population and israel is jewish and it's mostly because of our support of israel 

438.58 449.52 A: and a lot of our actions in other countries that have been covert and and ah detrimental to their governments that you've got their people rising up against us 

449.46 450.65 B: right 

450.59 458.84 A: and then when we go over there and we get rid of someone that's not liked like saddam hussein the the people expect us to shoulder the burden 

459.33 460.43 B: right 

460.31 462.07 A: and if we don't 

462.27 467.00 A: they're going to be disappointed and something else like september eleventh might happen 

466.85 471.08 B: right they don't and what bothers me i guess is they don't want us 

471.38 475.70 B: there in the first place because we're non muslim 

476.30 483.74 B: but they want to us to fix all the problems for them and it's our fault that they're mad now i don't recall seeing 

482.06 483.11 A: exactly 

483.74 491.64 B: i i saw tonight that they're you know so upset because the iraqi people looted museums and 

491.66 501.18 B: their equivalent of the c._d._c. in seoul you know viruses [noise] but it wasn't americans who were doing it we couldn't be everywhere 

501.68 504.05 B: and it's not our fault 

505.36 506.38 A: well 

505.56 512.06 B: that their own people went rampant and i can understand why they might have gone after that palaces and whatever but 

512.17 519.24 B: you know who would think they would go steal from their own museums and trash their own historical treasures 

518.89 527.54 A: well it's it's greed you know if if we had a revolution here in america i'm sure people would be looting the stores and ah 

527.61 532.89 B: [noise] the stores i can't imagine anybody having a need for stuff out of a museum [noise] 

527.80 529.54 A: and everything 

532.32 539.64 A: there's valuable things in a museum you know artifacts can can fetch a pretty good price especially ones with gold and silver 

540.37 553.10 B: well true but some of the destruction that i saw in the facilities themselves [noise] is like i didn't understand what the point of that was for if you're proud to be an iraqi and you're glad he is gone now or the regime is gone 

540.75 542.77 A: and when you've got 

553.25 562.14 B: why would you destroy it's like why people throw garbage in their own yard don't you have any pride in where you live and your own things 

562.38 573.01 A: oh it's ah it's a different set of values and i think it's i think it's just motiva- motivated by greed you've got you know and it would happen here i think 

564.77 566.38 B: i guess [noise] 

572.99 579.38 A: um you've got people that think something is worth something they're going to take it 

578.46 579.47 B: (( right [noise] [noise] )) 

579.74 588.31 A: you know in the l._a. riots you had people taking shoes and jackets and you know [mn] they're worth a little bit of money but 

588.95 597.93 A: then you had other people walking down the streets with t._v.s you know you know one thing that is value to one person isn't necessarily valuable to another 

591.72 592.74 B: right 

597.90 599.89 B: [noise] right i know i had seen 

598.13 599.19 A: and
