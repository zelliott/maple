2.53 3.59 A: hi amy 

3.60 6.31 A: so what changes have you made since september eleventh 

6.25 8.87 B: i don't really think that i've made any 

9.11 10.25 A: me neither 

9.86 21.16 B: i don't think [laughter] i mean it's oh you think about it a little more and and worry about bad things that could happen but i don't think that i've changed anything in my life at all 

10.57 12.04 A: [laughter] 

22.56 23.59 A: same here 

23.24 24.28 B: [laughter] 

24.63 27.91 A: so we got to talk about this for ten minutes [laughter] 

25.93 29.68 B: [laughter] well let's see 

29.41 31.99 A: so where were you when the planes hit 

31.72 42.88 B: i was actually at school i was i just graduated in december from college and that was i was still in school at that time so we were getting ready for a pop quiz actually 

42.89 56.44 B: and a girl rocked in late to class and she went right up and spoke to the teacher and our teacher said well something terrible has happened we're going down to the student union to turn on the television and we never did have that 

56.25 59.46 A: yep good thing huh [laughter] 

57.14 60.65 B: test it was a very good thing i was very unprepared so 

61.29 62.37 B: (( and where were you )) 

62.78 71.34 A: i was sleeping [laughter] my sister woke me up and said a plane had just crashed into the one of the um twin towers 

64.66 65.87 B: (( oh )) 

71.63 73.95 A: and so i woke up and turned on the t._v. 

75.02 75.80 B: (( yeah )) 

75.05 78.16 A: and when i turned on the t._v. that's when the second plane hit 

77.71 79.39 B: oh goodness 

80.21 82.83 B: yeah that was definitely a strange day 

83.33 88.17 B: we sat there in that student union for probably an hour just watching the t._v. 

87.87 89.59 A: now were you close by 

90.56 92.32 A: to new york 

92.04 93.81 B: no no i'm in ohio 

94.15 95.62 A: oh that's good 

95.05 96.48 B: yeah and you 

96.46 97.55 A: chicago 

97.11 98.16 B: oh [laughter] 

99.23 103.67 B: so then when there finally seemed to be nothing too much more happening i 

103.74 111.60 B: got out of there and came straight home and plonked in front of c._n._n. for the next [laughter] probably seventy two hours [laughter] 

109.06 112.51 A: twenty four hours [laughter] yeah 

112.83 116.18 A: after a while then i just had to turn it off couldn't watch no more of that 

116.21 125.94 B: i think i probably watched too much of it just like i did with this war that was we're getting done with now i probably kept c._n._n. on constantly 

126.99 130.77 B: like an addiction it's more than watching soap opera [laughter] 

129.72 136.66 A: [laughter] when the wa- when when that first happened i watched a lot when the war first broke out 

136.76 139.19 A: ever since i won't watch it 

139.22 141.04 A: it's just too much 

139.81 143.72 B: how far into it did you watch just a couple days of it or 

143.10 144.61 A: just a couple of days 

144.98 149.52 A: every you know whenever a commercial would come on somewhere else i'd flip on c._n._n. 

149.94 153.33 A: i won't watch it no more my mom will constantly watch it 

152.96 158.38 B: i do too it's terrible i'm just the opposite i'll flip over to something else if c._n._n. have a commercial [laughter] 

158.37 163.71 A: no because some things that they're showing now they shouldn't really be showing like the bodies and 

163.95 167.48 A: the actual gun battle i don't think they should be showing that 

167.75 175.27 B: they're probably sitting but it's like it's kinda like a car accident to me it's one of the things that you don't really want to watch but you kinda can't help it 

174.91 176.81 A: exactly [laughter] 

175.20 188.63 B: just because it's there and you it's something that i remember coming home i came home from the bar one time at two o'clock in the morning and couldn't go right to sleep my husband's laying there in bed sleeping and i turned it on and it was they were just going into a battle and i was thinking 

188.67 192.32 B: (( what in the world i come home at two o'clock in the morning and turn this on )) 

192.17 204.80 B: and i couldn't turn it off though because it wasn't like it was a movie where i could just you know pick up the next day and find out how it ended i mean this was actually happening right there as i was watching it and i thought oh my gosh this is bizarre 

204.98 207.56 A: yeah my mom's been sleeping with it on 

207.68 211.54 A: i told her she has to stop doing that she's getting into bad moods [laughter] 

210.77 213.21 B: pretty extreme [laughter] 

212.42 215.79 A: she falls asleep with it on and then her t._v.'s on all night 

215.45 216.70 B: oh goodness 

216.03 219.11 A: and i think it's subliminally doing things to her brain [laughter] 

218.07 219.47 B: [laughter] 

221.00 232.51 B: i use it to fall asleep to a couple of times only because when they bring in all those analysts and all those retired generals and all that that i don't really care to watch it gets so boring that they'll [laughter] put you to sleep 

232.57 235.76 B: but i have my t._v. sleep so it'll shut off by itself [laughter] 

234.92 236.53 A: [laughter] 

237.34 239.79 A: she doesn't use that option [laughter] 

238.86 241.09 B: oh i can't imagine that 

247.67 249.64 B: okay well [laughter] 

247.79 248.95 A: [noise] 

249.28 252.74 A: so did you read any magazines 

252.94 254.67 A: from the september eleventh 

254.70 261.84 B: um no not really i collected all the newspapers that i could find around here that was about it though 

262.05 266.94 B: and put those all put them away you know put them in plastic bags and put them away 

267.29 269.05 B: so my son can have them 

267.38 269.05 A: did you know anybody 

269.07 271.50 B: no fortunately nobody at all 

271.50 272.95 A: that's good 

274.82 278.92 B: about the only bummer thing was after that happened i'm in the national guard here 

278.67 279.65 A: (( mhm )) 

279.04 284.21 B: and i thought oh yeah i'm going away [laughter] [laughter] i might as well pack my bags now 

281.27 282.87 A: [laughter] 

283.93 285.29 A: did they call you 

284.75 285.77 B: no 

285.64 299.95 B: no believe it or not and i need to find some wood real quick here and knock on it because ever since then nothing i mean we've gotten a couple of close calls where we had to pack the bags and be ready to go but we've not actually gone anywhere 

300.09 301.38 B: it's amazing 

301.76 302.64 A: (( mm )) 

302.81 305.25 A: do you know anyone that's in the war right now 

305.33 311.96 B: um there's people i i don't know exactly where they're at though people from our base that have gone but i don't know 

312.11 315.34 B: they don't tell even they don't even tell us where they go- going 

315.20 316.24 A: yeah 

315.62 318.84 B: the only ones that are allowed to know are the ones that it affects so 

319.04 324.36 B: but i know several people who have left i just don't know where they are i mean they could still be stateside for all i know 

325.14 328.25 B: or they could be over there i don't really know [sigh] 

328.36 332.80 A: yeah i knew one guy he was over in afghanistan after the attacks and 

332.71 333.56 B: he ca- 

333.31 336.68 A: they sent him over there and then i heard he actually shot one of them 

336.52 337.60 B: wow 

338.54 340.80 A: he's um in the navy 

343.28 346.40 B: that's pretty wild when it strikes people that you know 

346.26 347.62 A: yeah 

347.79 350.88 A: luckily nobody i knew was over in new york 

350.90 355.51 B: yeah that just seems like everybody knew somebody but i i didn't know anyone either 

356.00 360.99 B: and i don't even think i knew anyone or know anyone that knew anyone [laughter] 

360.02 361.29 A: [laughter] 

361.00 363.16 B: which is guess is pretty lucky 

365.56 372.35 B: but it's scary it's one of those things that makes you think when you're in your little world and nothing's going wrong you just you never know 

372.38 375.52 A: so did you ever think to buy plastic and duck tape [laughter] 

375.00 378.77 B: no no i did not i did not at all 

375.65 377.12 A: [laughter] 

378.37 382.56 A: someone asked me that earlier so they called me earlier with the same topic 

382.32 383.70 B: oh [laughter] 

383.05 387.16 A: and they said about the plastic and duck tape i was like no way [laughter] 

386.02 390.53 B: no not at all that would just seemed ridiculous to me 

390.00 394.28 A: that is not going to do nothing my mom actually we needed tape 

394.42 399.27 A: to we have a cream colored carpet and we're having a party so we put plastic down 

399.31 403.56 A: and she was she was embarrassed actually go have to buy plastic and tape 

403.10 405.65 B: [laughter] funny 

404.33 409.66 A: [laughter] she's like i'm going to walk into the store and they're going to think i'm taping up the house [laughter] 

408.59 409.96 B: [laughter] 

410.48 414.15 A: she's like i can't do it luckily we knew someone with plastic [laughter] 

414.21 418.32 B: that's just crazy yeah i just i thought that was a little too 

418.86 420.06 B: too weird 

420.20 425.74 B: and people that i knew were were changing i'm a substitute teacher and there were teachers 

426.04 439.31 B: subs that i know that were telling the sub office they weren't available when was it was just a couple of months ago when they were that was the end of one of the islamic holidays or something and they were saying that was probably going to be the the day they were going to attack 

439.28 449.25 B: this is before the wa- the war even started but they were calling in and saying they weren't available that day and they didn't want to go teach that day because something was probably going to happen and i thought 

441.39 442.35 A: mhm 

449.29 453.48 B: that's just you you can't live your life just thinking something's going to happen 

453.14 461.91 A: exactly we were sitting here after the party and we're sitting there talking about everything that's going on with um before it was before the war started 

461.88 473.87 A: um it was on february fifteenth when they were doing all the demonstrations then [laughter] talking about what's going on in the world and everything and the one woman said you know it's sick that we're sitting here laughing about it because we were laughing 

473.82 478.16 A: and i said if we don't then we're the ones buying plastic and duck tape 

477.44 478.93 B: exactly 

478.20 481.93 A: if you can't sit there and you know and try to make some sense of it 

481.94 485.21 A: then we're bolting up the house [laughter] 

484.55 486.30 B: yeah 

486.79 487.79 A: so 

486.89 491.09 B: so what was their opinion of the demonstrators that have been doing this while the 

491.21 493.06 B: while the war was going on 

493.83 496.75 A: i think that's they have the right to do that 

498.10 502.74 B: it pissed me off [laughter] made me madder than anything 

499.38 501.18 A: [laughter] 

502.42 506.24 A: what makes me mad is the people who say that 

506.63 514.80 A: they shouldn't be protesting and if they don't like it they should leave and they don't support america what you know they're not saying they don't support america 

515.16 517.41 A: they're just saying they don't support the war 

517.64 520.02 A: i don't support the i don't support the war 

520.42 531.78 B: i don't believe that i'm a war supporter but i i think that by not supporting what's going on by the country going on with the country that like george bush keeps saying if you're not with us you're against us 

532.71 535.79 A: (( no i don- [laughter] )) 

534.68 546.28 B: and ask someone who's in the military to see those people doing that although you know like i said i haven't gone anywhere but to see those people doing the protesting that can't do anything but bring the spirits down of the people that are forced to be there 

546.37 551.07 B: they see that i mean they you know they know what's going on people are telling them what's going on 

552.16 566.99 B: i just i can't imagine being there being one of those people fighting and hearing from back home or getting a letter from home or whatever the case may be that people are protesting against what you're doing that would just make me feel so horrible and it did make me feel horrible even though i wasn't doing it 

567.19 571.37 B: i just think that was it's a horrible horrible thing to do to the human spirit 

567.21 568.21 A: you see i 

571.54 585.03 A: i don't think like that i i think you know you're protesting what you know dir- you know what the the government is deciding not what the the the troops are doing the governments that are th- our government is the one who decided we needed to do this 

585.28 588.11 A: and i i don't support bush 

588.62 590.18 A: i didn't vote for him 

589.90 590.94 B: hm 

590.74 592.58 A: i didn't want him in office 

592.79 598.12 B: oh this could become a heated conversation [laughter] because i'm a total bush supporter and [laughter] 

594.51 596.45 A: [laughter] 

596.93 599.12 A: [laughter]
