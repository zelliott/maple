16.69 20.71 B: okay yeah you've probably seen uh much larger impact than i have 

20.09 22.83 A: yeah in fact our 

23.35 27.42 A: our ministry went out to ground zero itself and 

26.78 27.82 B: really 

27.57 29.68 A: right over christmas time 

30.81 39.78 B: yeah i i um i'm from detroit michigan and i was uh actually spent some time there um about a month before it happened and it [sigh] 

39.86 43.27 B: it it was so surreal seeing it happen that it just 

43.28 49.87 B: you know i i don't think it's changed that much about my day to day life but it's changed my outlook 

44.25 45.13 A: yeah 

50.04 53.73 B: uh on things and things you take for granted you know 

53.67 55.11 A: mhm 

54.53 55.56 B: um 

55.89 60.80 B: it was amazing when i when it happened i i pulled out all the pictures i took from my vacation and 

60.81 64.83 B: the world trade centre was in every picture but it never was the focus of it and 

64.90 68.33 B: and it kinda made me think about things you know and uh 

67.54 69.05 A: yes it did 

69.00 76.46 B: how things that you you you take for granted and you you know it's always there and you you just don't even notice it until it's gone and 

77.39 78.22 A: yep 

77.46 78.32 B: um 

78.33 84.82 B: so i i don't think it's made a huge impact on you know my i don't i don't do things different but 

81.88 83.70 A: not really you know 

85.51 93.24 A: but it could happen any time you know chicago could happen in detroit could happen right here in springfield illinois where i live 

87.37 88.38 B: right 

92.72 93.83 B: mhm 

95.13 97.00 A: and we got to be ready 

96.46 106.15 B: right exactly i didn't haven't run out and bought duck tape and all the other [laughter] you know i don't have a safe room i don't have this i don't have that but 

99.94 101.90 A: (( no [laughter] no )) 

103.06 103.87 A: no 

106.01 112.16 B: i'm more likely to do things now that i you know would put off like vacations and trips and 

110.17 111.00 A: yeah 

112.11 124.37 B: you know actually i i've flown more since september eleventh than i ever did before because it's i keep thinking you know if you're going to go you're going to go it's you know i can't prevent it from happening so i might as well enjoy everything while i'm here 

120.04 121.01 A: yeah 

121.87 122.80 A: no 

124.78 126.73 A: you might as well you know 

127.02 128.00 B: mhm 

127.38 131.50 A: you never know who's goin- you know you've got to be ready to go too 

131.10 138.85 B: right right you know i could be on a vacation and something could happen in my home town and being away could you know help save people so 

136.90 137.74 A: yeah 

138.32 139.48 A: yeah 

138.92 145.91 B: you know there's n- i don't i don't know that there's anything anyone can do to you know prevent it other than being a little more 

141.64 142.38 A: no 

145.67 158.00 B: cognizant of what was going on in their surroundings and things like that but as far as traveling and things like that i i definitely haven't let it stop me in fact i probably do more now because of it 

151.32 152.19 A: yeah 

157.95 160.87 A: in fact my sister went and 

161.63 165.88 A: she's an assistant administrator here at the salvation army in springfield 

165.36 166.54 B: mhm 

165.91 169.12 A: and she had to go to austin texas houston texas 

169.15 172.68 A: the week after it happened fly out there 

172.32 173.62 B: mhm 

172.91 176.25 A: so [laughter] it was kinda of a little bit scary 

175.70 177.24 B: oh yeah 

177.06 180.34 A: but she made it safe 

180.15 185.55 B: yeah my my husband was actually mid air on september eleventh while this is going on 

184.75 187.05 A: oh he he was a pilot 

186.52 196.73 B: no he he travels a lot for business and he was on his way to chicago and he said halfway through the flight all of a sudden every all the the flight attendants just they stopped talking 

190.59 191.52 A: oh 

197.13 202.75 B: and he said it was the strangest flight that he's ever been on it was really really tense and then when they landed 

202.78 208.02 B: uh they announced you know what had happened and told everyone turn on your cell phone and call your loved ones 

208.24 219.70 B: you know it was it was very scary to know that my husband's up there flying around heading towards a major city and every time they'd say oh this plane in chicago looks like you know i it was like okay that could be him and 

216.55 217.39 A: yeah 

219.91 228.67 B: i i wasn't real comfortable with him traveling immediately afterwards but you know it's and more people probably died that day in car accidents and any you know 

228.67 229.60 A: yeah 

228.97 231.91 B: since then than than anything else so 

232.63 239.64 B: it's it's preventable but it's not i guess you know it's not avoidable if you're going to go it's if it's your time it's your time [laughter] 

238.63 240.35 A: it's your time 

239.72 240.68 B: mhm 

241.22 243.07 A: and you have to be ready 

242.49 247.24 B: mhm you said that uh you've done a lot of training for 

246.40 249.20 A: yeah with the salvation army we're i 

249.30 251.34 A: i work with the disaster 

251.09 252.19 B: mhm 

251.50 253.03 A: canteen here 

252.77 253.67 B: mhm 

253.66 260.91 A: and we've we've been to about three meetings so far on what to do in case of a terrorist attack and all that 

260.71 261.70 B: mhm 

262.08 265.81 A: and it's real you know some of the pictures you see 

265.52 266.64 B: mhm 

266.02 267.38 A: get you thinking 

267.27 268.62 B: oh yeah 

269.39 274.84 B: but it a lot of it's more i don't know commonsense things for me it's not like you know 

272.32 273.38 A: yes 

275.30 278.65 B: you have to go and buy this and take this class and 

278.45 291.33 B: train or this it's things everybody should know i mean we all should know c._p._r. and you know those those are the sort of things that it's that i think we we probably as americans got kinda lax and living in our little world that 

282.41 283.83 A: [mn] yeah 

291.16 294.60 B: it's not bad to know those things anyways and we probably should've 

294.65 298.45 B: known had some basic uh survival sort of 

296.44 297.24 A: yeah 

298.87 300.80 B: uh classes or 

300.89 305.04 B: you know learned a little bit more about how to deal with things like this but 

305.26 310.62 B: i don't know if it's made as much of a change as kinda made me think well i should of been doing this all along 

310.55 313.09 A: yeah that's right 

312.66 313.70 B: mhm 

314.27 320.02 A: and then you know tornados kills as many people sometimes as uh a plane crash do 

319.57 322.24 B: (( oh yeah i've every easily )) 

322.67 335.14 B: and i mean natural disasters and everything else you just don't ever know where the place is that's going to be safe or not so even staying at home doesn't doesn't mean you're going to be okay you could be duck taped in your little room and you know 

325.58 327.37 A: all types of disasters 

330.12 331.01 A: yeah 

335.27 338.59 B: ha- have something else very strange happen to you and 

338.86 340.07 A: (( yeah )) 

339.84 345.23 B: yeah it it's i don't i don't think it's preventable for you know the average every day person 

343.96 346.38 A: nothing is preventable you know 

345.41 346.26 B: no 

347.01 349.56 A: if it's your time to go it's your time to go 

349.04 357.24 B: mhm and being aware i mean i try it i always try to be but i think so i i'm probably a little bit more so about 

351.88 352.72 A: yeah 

357.42 367.00 B: you know where my friends are and when people call and tell me they're going here or going there i try and think about it a little more rather than just yeah call me when you get back and 

367.51 370.73 B: you know ignore the fact that people are gone but 

371.83 377.41 B: i definitely understand why people want to go and travel and and still get on with their lives 'cause you kinda have to 

377.04 379.71 A: you go and see just go and see the world 

379.16 380.12 B: mhm 

381.35 386.12 B: 'cause you don't know where when or if that will happen again or wh- when or where so 

382.53 383.28 A: no 

385.26 389.91 A: i kind of with the the iraq deal i kinda look for something maybe 

389.76 390.74 B: mhm 

390.78 393.02 A: i don't know what yet but 

392.65 393.90 B: mhm 

394.02 396.70 A: there's always a chance of it 

396.19 397.74 B: oh yeah yeah 

397.01 400.20 A: and i don't think they've got saddam yet 

399.23 400.84 B: probably not 

401.02 402.72 B: probably not but 

401.17 405.40 A: he's probably with somebody else took his billions of dollars and 

404.81 410.75 B: mhm see even if they got him his legacy unfortunately will live on for a long time 'cause 

410.30 411.31 A: (( yeah )) 

410.76 412.28 B: he's not alone in 

412.76 413.62 A: uh-huh 

412.94 416.88 B: you know hating us and hating our country unfortunately 

414.44 415.62 A: (( no [laughter] )) 

416.45 417.42 A: no 

417.49 425.02 B: you give any anybody enough money who who's not afraid to die for their own cause and and it that's that's hard to stop 

424.41 426.30 A: yep 

425.74 434.51 B: that's practically impossible to stop if someone's willing to give their life to take yours i mean it's it's a real tough thing to be able to fight that but 

432.23 433.09 A: yeah 

434.58 437.09 B: you can't worry about it all the time either 

436.09 437.00 A: no 

441.27 443.44 A: and we got you know 

443.57 447.63 A: and they the media puts so so much into it 

447.15 448.26 B: mhm 

449.28 453.96 A: helps tell the enemy right where our men are right over t._v. 

453.65 454.92 B: right 

455.45 465.87 B: and and keep watching and you start feeling you know like oh it's going to something's going to happen and 'cause they they build things up too and if you start getting more paranoid and losing you know 

455.62 457.73 A: that that's with iraq 

465.30 466.49 A: yeah 

466.47 475.06 B: losing touch with with reality i guess i at least with this war i you know you get engrossed in something and you forget there's the whole other world out there too 

474.85 476.58 A: yeah 

475.80 482.97 B: and you can't you know it's it's very important to pay attention to what's going on but not at the expense of stop living your own life 

484.07 486.29 A: yeah you can't stop living 

485.74 486.87 B: mhm 

487.20 489.60 A: you got to take one day at a time 

489.09 494.05 B: definitely and i'm more now so than than ever before probably because of this 

492.58 493.47 A: mhm 

497.24 499.58 A: how's the weather up there in detroit 

499.77 500.71 A: not too 

499.91 506.45 B: oh cold today warm yesterday cold the day before actually no we've had some but

507.31 508.00 B: ho- 

510.40 513.15 B: uh so we'll probably get that tomorrow then 

512.96 514.42 A: [laughter] 

513.32 515.71 B: [laughter] 

515.06 517.24 A: i know we supposed to be talking about other 

517.05 518.15 B: [laughter] 

518.23 522.07 A: but see you kinda run run out of stuff to say 

518.86 520.06 B: yeah 

521.71 525.87 B: yeah yeah and i can see how yeah but 

528.53 531.51 A: our ten minutes should be about up pretty shortly 

530.99 534.51 B: [sigh] yeah actually it looks like it's been just about ten minutes so 

535.01 536.79 A: we got to keep talking 

536.30 537.90 B: yep i guess 

537.42 539.49 A: [laughter] 

539.35 547.34 B: [laughter] so have you heard about what they're do you know what they're going to be doing with the uh the the location that the world trade centre was on have they 

546.62 549.42 A: i hear they're going to build another build another one 

549.10 550.29 B: good 

549.66 552.59 A: but not that size though i don't think 

552.05 554.58 B: (( uh-huh they we- they were massive )) 

554.41 555.89 A: yeah 

555.36 558.44 B: have you ever had you ever been there in person or seen it no 

557.19 558.00 A: no 

559.05 567.01 B: i i just when i saw it for the first time it was you know i i couldn't believe it i i have never seen anything that scale before you know 

566.81 575.85 A: and another thing i don- i don't think that bombing that they had in the basement there i don't think that done any harm 

573.06 574.13 B: mhm 

575.96 581.72 A: done any good for this plane crash that i think that might of helped a little bit better 

579.64 580.35 B: oh 

581.58 588.02 B: no i actually i knew i knew a person who his job when that happened was to go floor to floor and get everyone out and 

587.80 588.66 A: [mn] 

588.34 596.80 B: he had to run up and down those towers twice or his tower and he said there there's no way they they inspected it so thoroughly afterwards that 

596.89 599.95 B: had there been any damage they they would of found it
