282.00 283.12 B: right 

284.35 288.31 B: um it sounds familiar but i can't picture 

286.69 291.53 A: it's it's about ten minutes from memphis it takes about ten minutes to get there 

291.20 292.09 B: okay 

291.80 296.90 A: it's millington is bigger than it used to be but it's it's not that big 

296.70 297.54 B: okay 

297.34 298.92 A: it's not as big as memphis 

298.83 303.26 B: because like you know rochester minnesota it's big but i we just 

303.28 313.11 B: me and coworkers are like we just can't figure that that would be a bomb target for if someone a terrorist wanted to attack somewhere they'd he'd probably pick somewhere [laughter] a little bit bigger 

309.67 311.30 A: yes ma'am yeah 

312.61 318.17 A: they would probably pick memphis before they would rochester [laughter] i mean 

315.95 320.67 B: yeah i'm sure but memphis really isn't that big of a threat 

320.07 323.30 A: it's not no ma'am it's not that big but 

320.84 321.94 B: or 

322.44 330.01 B: not really well known i mean like new york new york i mean everybody yeah they've heard of that and all that but it's just 

328.50 336.06 A: yes ma'am they i mean look at new york they've got the last batch of labor the e._v. eiffel tower the um 

333.20 334.15 B: yeah 

335.47 337.17 B: yeah 

336.58 338.72 A: i mean what's it called josh 

339.15 340.24 B: what's that 

340.68 341.57 B: (( oh [laughter] )) 

340.80 344.53 A: (( no the eiffel tower i mean the empire state building )) 

344.22 345.54 B: oh yeah 

344.57 348.99 A: where did i get the eiffel tower from [laughter] the

363.71 364.81 A: but uh 

365.63 367.16 B: (( got it from )) 

366.05 378.48 A: so the only thing we really have to worry about in memphis is the pyramid or our big bridge or you know some of our refineries out here that's all we really have to worry about oh yeah well you know and me working at a health facility i mean they're not going to bomb a a hospital or anything 

378.11 379.03 B: (( oh )) 

380.26 380.98 B: (( geeze )) 

381.73 382.59 B: (( so )) 

384.10 385.13 B: (( i )) 

385.34 386.17 B: (( haven't )) 

386.44 388.89 A: you wouldn't think no you wouldn't think 

388.58 394.12 B: 'cause i mean they could use the the hospitals and stuff too and it just i don't know you 

392.24 393.50 A: yes ma'am 

393.95 404.11 B: you kind of i feel really detached from it all so i don't feel like it really threatens me but it makes you a little more aware of stuff but i mean what are you going to do about it really 

403.84 405.11 A: yes ma'am 

404.75 405.66 B: so

534.88 535.99 A: yes ma'am 

535.58 539.27 B: you know i didn't want it to happen in in such a big way but it just 

539.06 551.09 B: people just kind of uh out of sight out of mind you know they they put the whole problems aside if if they don't directly affect them and even after september eleventh a lot of people just kinda went back to their ways and
