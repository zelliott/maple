4.97 6.04 A: um 

6.32 14.30 A: well really the nine eleven hasn't really changed any of my plans um since that occurred 

14.33 24.06 A: i used to live in new york and i've been in virginia for about six years so um it kind of 

24.03 30.29 A: hit home a little bit because since i was living there for all my life 

30.28 40.32 A: and i've been into the world tr- the twin towers and i had friends that were working there but um fortunately nothing happened to them 

40.45 41.79 A: um 

42.36 44.34 A: i did go see the 

44.95 47.73 A: you know the the building after 

48.31 50.65 A: the disaster occurred and [lipsmack] 

51.08 66.02 A: um it was yeah nerve racking a little bit you know to see everything them cleaning up the the mess and um seeing everybody there and all the flowers and everything they had left um 

66.40 70.25 A: at the site but other than that um 

70.47 72.82 A: it really didn't change i'm still 

73.21 78.16 A: doing my plans i'm going um to orlando in june and um 

78.75 84.11 A: i'm taking the flight and making arrangements for another trip after that um 

84.23 91.30 A: and just went to florida about um a couple of weeks ago so it really hasn't changed a lot 

91.47 95.79 B: i'm in kind of a similar situation i am an ex new yorker living in virginia 

95.73 96.36 A: (( oh )) 

95.86 98.25 B: [laughter] it's a small world isn't it 

97.97 99.29 A: [laughter] 

98.47 111.73 B: and i've got a lot of relatives in new york i have been in this area for about thirty years but i've got a stepmother a sister a whole a whole large step family and a lot of connections in new york some of whom are in the financial business 

111.44 112.24 A: mhm 

111.92 114.00 B: and i 

114.36 120.70 B: was concerned when things were happening when when planes were crashing and all 

120.12 121.10 A: mhm 

120.70 131.60 B: for relatives and ah some in laws but everybody turned out to be okay and and amazingly enough even though i'd worked at the pentagon and knew quite a few people there 

131.54 138.19 B: i as far as i can tell i don't know anybody who was even injured in either of the catastrophes 

138.49 141.91 B: and of course i'm deeply grateful for that 

141.63 143.03 A: right 

142.45 148.41 B: we had plans to travel out of the country on i think it's about october eighth or seventh 

148.47 149.79 A: mhm 

148.92 154.98 B: and we had our tickets in hand and then september eleventh came along and we decided that 

155.16 168.68 B: first of all everything was probably a little bit safer after september eleventh and secondly we weren't going to let the possibility of terrorists wreck what had been a plan for the kids to have a special birthday weekend 

158.74 159.78 A: right 

168.06 169.07 A: mhm 

168.75 176.70 B: so we went off to the bahamas and had i guess four days there over the columbus day weekend and then ah came home 

176.76 184.67 B: and everything was amazingly normal except for airport security which was a bit of a mess especially around washington 

184.58 185.52 A: right 

185.26 188.93 B: and since then [mn] i think we've been 

189.15 200.95 B: we've stayed a little bit closer to home but it hasn't been specifically september eleventh i think it's really been more the effect of [mn] the security problems and the airline problems and the actual travel issues 

200.88 202.32 A: right 

201.22 214.16 B: um we haven't stayed out of washington and of course that would be a prime target but we go in by metro we go in by car we drive around the white house and show friends the museums but we haven't cut back on any of that activity at all 

210.75 211.85 A: mhm 

214.64 215.42 A: mhm 

215.87 217.64 A: yeah the um 

217.66 231.20 A: well i found that the airport because i had hadn't flown in a long time for years and i took a trip to miami a couple of weeks ago and it was i mean i really couldn't tell whether 

232.06 233.20 A: (( any )) 

233.89 241.15 A: i i couldn't compare is what i'm trying to say because since i hadn't taken any um trips in years 

241.17 242.38 A: um 

243.32 248.67 A: the security you know was there and you had to you know i had to take off my shoes and you know 

248.71 250.58 A: stuff like that so 

250.85 257.25 A: you know sometimes you've got to do things that in order for you to be safe so you know it's nothing out of 

257.83 259.17 A: you know the norm 

259.26 262.50 B: it's not that i minded so much it's that i used to 

262.27 277.26 B: well years ago when i travelled a lot i'd fly out of national airport and i lived out at alexandria and i was maybe about fifteen minutes away from the airport by car and i would leave for the airport less than an hour before flight time and i never missed a plane 

275.49 276.41 A: mhm 

277.26 290.07 B: and these days first of all the transportation has gotten so bad and secondly the the airport stuff has gotten so bad that i'd have to leave about two and a half hours before the flight to make sure of getting it 

287.94 288.99 A: yeah 

290.11 298.99 B: and i might end up with an hour on my hands to kill at the airport but but i have to allow for the possibility of a long stay behind some lines 

294.15 295.52 A: yeah uh-huh 

299.16 300.65 A: right that's the thing 

299.47 304.88 B: and so it's changed the frequency that i do short trips it doesn't stop me from doing 

305.22 312.51 B: oh a trip with the family across the country but it stops me from popping up to new york to visit with my sister for just a just a day 

312.41 324.95 B: which i used to do every once in a while where we had family business meetings and i would go up there in the morning and come back dragged out late at night and i haven't made a trip like that in more than two years 

324.95 328.11 A: well i i still have family in new york and 

328.73 333.46 A: i usually drive up on the weekends but i haven't really done 

333.58 340.52 A: that in a while and not because of the nine eleven it's just i hate driving up there 

340.67 344.97 A: um the what seven hours and then driving back 

344.52 345.88 B: yeah [laughter] 

345.18 356.05 A: so [laughter] so that's the only deterrent other than that you know i would be going all the time but um my plans are still the same i mean right now [lipsmack] 

356.28 358.72 A: i mean i'm in downtown norfolk and 

358.96 365.88 A: um when it happened they sent us home because we i'm in the building where 

366.10 377.68 A: ah the world trade centre is across the street and the federal building is like two a couple of blocks away and then i'm in where the coastguards are in the building you know so 

377.68 387.80 A: they started patrolling the halls and um we were more aware of security and that you know everyone was watching 

388.12 394.01 A: and every time they every people here were nervous because every time they would hear something they were like okay what was that 

394.07 395.42 A: you know are they 

395.67 399.39 A: bombing letting something go or what you know so 

400.14 401.52 A: it was um 

401.76 406.36 A: i guess the other people would make you scared you know um i 

406.76 414.30 A: didn't worry about it much but seeing the other people being worried you know kind of like it was contagious 

414.85 429.55 B: i live not far from dulles airport and it was wonderful when everything was grounded and then shortly afterwards when there were just a few flights flying because instead of being noisy pretty much until about ten in the evening it was nice and quiet all day long [laughter] you could 

429.02 430.30 A: (( yeah )) 

429.54 432.42 B: hear the neighbors cutting their grass a mile away 

432.35 433.43 A: oh 

432.73 447.18 B: and now it's kind of just the opposite it's not that the skies are so busy or so noisy but it's that whenever i see an airplane or hear an airplane i stop to think what's that airplane doing is it supposed to be there is it one that i recognize 

446.00 450.40 A: right yeah that's what these these people were saying over here 

450.76 463.35 A: and where i live i live in a no fly zone so um that's a good thing but now with the war going on i heard a couple of planes i'm like wait a minute was 

463.42 469.20 A: that a plane flying over why are they flying over here you know and you start 

469.52 476.55 A: getting concerned but you know it's just that i guess they went a different way and that was it 

475.47 477.45 B: a couple of nights ago i heard 

477.80 491.40 B: probably a military jet probably flying quite low and definitely making a lot of noise and it's unusual to hear ah jet aircraft low right where we are because they don't fly over us on the way into the airport they're not supposed to 

490.50 491.28 A: mhm 

491.65 498.01 B: and i went running outside even though it was one or two in the morning because i wanted to see what the heck was making all that racket and 

497.66 498.34 A: (( mhm )) 

498.00 506.95 B: i think in the old days i wouldn't have i might have looked out the window to see if i spotted anything but i don't think i would have actually opened the door and gone out to see if i could spot it 

504.97 505.57 A: (( huh-uh )) 

507.09 508.75 A: mhm yeah 

507.94 519.72 B: part of that's because i'm ah an airplane nut and i'm i'm really interested in airplanes and if it was something exotic i'd like to get a look at it but it never showed up to me 

519.46 520.37 A: mhm 

520.60 528.87 A: yeah i mean i don't know it's it's just you gotta keep doing what you're doing and not change because if you do then they've won 

529.59 534.59 B: i agree with that entirely and i'm a pretty stubborn guy [laughter] 

533.32 535.23 A: [laughter] 

535.75 539.51 A: (( i mean i don't know i'm i'm still taking my )) 

539.53 540.84 A: i mean until 

541.27 546.25 A: recent i i started taking trips i mean before i was um 

546.98 548.07 A: i was 

548.54 561.39 A: going out with this guy we broke up so i thought okay now is the time i'm i'm free so now i can do whatever i want and just pick up and leave and i don't have to answer to anybody and so now i am taking my trips and going everywhere 

560.99 570.50 B: yeah it was hard to explain some of this to the kids that we wanted them to be a little careful that we aren't going to let it stop us from doing things they couldn't 

564.60 566.51 A: yeah they just don't 

571.50 583.03 B: they had to work a little bit to sort out that that fine line that we were trying to tread and why couldn't we just pop in the airplane and go off to see grandpa well you know it's a little more trouble than it used to be 

583.30 588.46 A: yeah you said um when it happened you were going to do a birthday 

588.86 594.69 B: yeah we had something lined up for i guess a little less than a month about four weeks after nine eleven 

594.79 596.15 B: and 

595.97 597.50 A: it was for the kids 

597.02 599.90 B: yeah we took the kids and the airplane was
