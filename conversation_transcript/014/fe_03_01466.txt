137.52 139.66 B: and how long do you think you'll be in brazil 

139.65 142.49 A: i'll be in there for i'll be there for two years 

141.90 143.67 B: really wow 

142.84 143.77 A: uh-huh 

143.79 151.66 A: 'cause we all in any kid is like willing and dedicated enough leaves at age nineteen and comes back at twenty one 

151.24 152.25 B: uh-huh 

152.10 154.08 A: and they just take two years 

154.46 159.57 A: so i guess that's one of the changes i kinda made after september eleventh 

154.49 155.07 B: (( mm )) 

158.93 160.78 B: really in what way 

159.87 162.92 A: well i well like it it's like uh 

162.98 166.17 A: i was thinking about doing the r._o._t._c. too 

165.78 166.98 B: (( mhm )) 

166.43 174.36 A: but that just like i wa- i wanted to and i thought i'd do it before my mission but when things came um 

171.17 172.09 B: (( mhm )) 

174.62 181.46 A: up most likely if i were to join the r._o._t._c. then i'd would of had to stay here and not be able to serve a mission 

181.09 182.11 B: (( mhm )) 

181.48 186.03 A: so i i wanted to serve my mission first and probably join when i get back 

185.68 186.72 B: mhm 

186.04 191.24 A: or something like that so i'm not waiting i wanted to get this get this taken care of and done 

190.40 190.97 B: (( mm )) 

191.56 199.83 A: so i don't know i i i didn't notice too many changes with me after september eleventh but i don't know 

202.36 207.03 B: do do anything different in the way you think about things or feel about things or ask 

207.64 208.72 A: um 

209.65 215.43 A: way i feel about things like with the war september eleventh i think a lot of people have been overlooking 

215.43 224.98 A: what what happened to us first like i mean like i mean i'm not i'm not against the war at all and i mean i i don't think it's right or anything but i mean 

224.84 232.49 A: i think it it's happening because it i i think that's the only way the government thought they could take care of the problem 

231.86 233.13 B: of the terrorists 

232.97 237.77 A: yeah of the terrorists and all the other stuff like i mean 

233.59 234.46 B: uh-huh 

237.56 248.62 A: i think like most americans are against the war are overlooking is what might happen might have happened if they didn't go in and uh and take care of saddam and all that 

247.92 248.93 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

248.76 258.03 A: and like i mean september eleventh i think played a bigger part than what most people look at as far as the war goes and stuff but i mean 

256.98 261.48 B: so you think that was a you think that was the turning point or you think it wasn't 

260.72 266.20 A: well i i think i think it's a point in which a lot of people overlook i think it was 

266.16 276.32 A: i mean with the with the government and all that i think that was a big point for them in that we don't look about because it happened like two years ago 

271.99 272.89 B: uh-huh 

276.10 277.01 B: uh-huh 

276.46 285.78 A: and so i mean if we look at that and just say hey i mean this will probably settle it down or stop it i mean i i think that's a good thing 

282.76 283.69 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

286.48 294.43 A: but i'm not too i don't know a lot about what's going on in the war and what what what the reasons are and what not but 

293.68 295.97 B: have you been following it very much 

295.45 307.90 A: i i've i've i've read some and find out it looks like well more lately it's just been like the stories that have happened over there and how many of the soldiers have died and their stories of the soldiers who died 

307.28 308.48 B: yeah 

307.85 313.40 A: i mean as far as we as far as like i think the public knows and everyone knows 

313.20 324.16 A: the political views i don't think we know even half of it i think there's probably more than the reason just to go over and get saddam i think there's more than that that we just don't know about 

323.17 329.21 B: well i'm hoping there is that's the only thing that keeps me feeling like it's okay to do this is that 

329.59 330.66 B: um 

331.08 338.90 B: there is there are other things that we don't know about that make it much dangerous situation than it seemed to be because 

339.12 343.57 A: yeah yeah the the like i i i'd think like i mean they might have like 

343.51 356.38 A: nuclear warheads i mean and that might be one of the main reasons they're over there but they're not going to worry all of us because of that i think that there could be reasons such as that and everything else and like there's other probably other acts of terrorism have been 

349.62 350.67 B: mhm 

356.30 359.36 A: that they've probably stopped and we just haven't known about 

358.72 363.91 B: right yeah that's the scary part to me is like you know is it really that much worse i don't know 

363.92 364.80 A: yeah 

364.20 366.33 B: i i do wonder about that 

366.44 374.24 A: yeah and i mean with the government like all movies lately you you are like i don't know what the movie was called um 

374.32 388.59 A: bourne identity or the recruit and stuff like that all that stuff is just like wow this really could be happening and we'd have no idea that kind of thing and which is like so i mean i we really can't just judge the government what they're doing i mean 

376.52 377.48 B: uh-huh 

381.41 382.61 B: yeah 

388.94 402.99 A: i mean there's not many people who've i mean dead compared to americans as over there i mean it's sad how many people have died i wonder how many of them were like trying to kill american soldiers and what not 

402.41 403.64 B: mhm 

403.05 407.67 A: and so it's just it's sad but it's just like i guess it needed to be done 

408.00 409.60 A: because i mean 

409.48 422.89 A: i'm sure the the president and everyone doesn't want war as much as we do but it that must of been the only way and so i just go with what they decided and it makes me sad that there's so many people against it 

422.56 423.54 B: mhm 

422.84 433.51 A: and see these soldiers are coming home or they're leaving and they i mean i i i guarantee at least half of them don't want to and don't support it but it's just what they need to do 

433.15 434.42 B: mhm 

433.81 439.90 A: and so it's kinda sad when they come home to a country that's half of the people are unappreciative of 

439.76 440.87 B: mhm 

439.99 444.81 A: for what they're doing over there even though they might not be in total support of the war 

444.83 450.66 B: so you feel like you totally trust our politicians and you think they have our best interests at heart 

450.80 460.98 A: i i do i mean they they why would they want to go over there and just kill people and just just looking for one man to stop something i know 

460.87 474.86 A: there has to be a reason they know that some of our soldiers would be killed and they they know the risks they're taking of doing this and so i mean if it's worth doing for them and throwing all this money into it there must be a a really good reason 

474.25 475.37 B: mhm 

475.41 484.74 A: 'cause i mean like they spent so much money on these bombs and everything and all the troops to feed all that kind of stuff when they could be 

484.67 494.09 A: i mean getting everyone out of poverty in the u._s. and what some people say about i mean there must be more than just the reason to get saddam than 

494.23 496.49 A: all that you know that they 

495.41 496.43 B: mhm 

496.65 501.76 A: put so much into it so like i have a lot of trust in them and i mean 

501.91 513.20 A: and it goes through so many different things to get into it too like like the house it's a lot of men who decide on it everyone just says the pres- the president but it's a lot of people 

512.64 514.24 B: mhm 

513.58 517.58 A: and so i mean it can't just be one bad choice by one person 

517.58 522.11 B: you think there's a team of people that have made all the decisions regarding this war 

517.82 518.78 A: it may 

521.35 526.87 A: yeah what led led up to it yeah i totally dig that and i mean 

524.97 526.01 B: mhm 

526.86 537.90 A: september eleventh i i mean a lot of people i think changed after that but i mean if that i don't if september didn't eleventh didn't happen i don't think this would be happening now 

537.20 538.37 B: mhm 

538.24 540.71 A: so i mean i i don't know 

540.85 543.75 B: do you feel more vulnerable since september eleventh 

543.86 546.45 A: vulnerable in what way like scared 

546.10 548.63 B: mhm or just that 

549.08 559.26 B: um that we took a lot of our freedom for granted and and something more horrible than that could happen to americans 

560.18 560.98 A: mm 

561.27 562.64 A: (( i uh )) 

563.35 571.04 A: i don't see how it i mean i i don't feel that i took my freedom for granted or anything like that but it just 

571.52 573.24 A: i think [noise] 

576.78 580.46 A: i don't feel very vulnerable after that i i 

580.82 584.77 A: i just viewed it with like a sad moment but but the thing is 

585.01 590.17 A: like in other countries i mean pe- that many people die every day because they starve or 

590.20 599.90 A: something like that i mean over in iraq all those children were dying every day from starvation while saddam was spending all that money on himself and doing those tests and stuff like that
