48.08 52.12 B: um but i got out two years ago now 

52.23 55.07 B: and i guess it's just kind of a 

55.49 59.25 B: nature of you're told to do something and so you definitely want to [laughter] 

59.47 62.78 B: revert from everything that you were told to do when you get out at

67.98 70.38 B: yes it's definitely um 

70.81 78.05 B: something that i feel uh everybody should work out and then it does it depends on the person as far as how much 

74.78 79.12 A: it depends on you know which particular sadist is running the class 

78.26 80.20 B: a workout doesn't have to mean 

79.59 80.84 A: (( [laughter] )) 

80.29 82.86 B: um you know going to the gym and 

81.66 82.29 A: (( argh )) 

83.77 92.70 B: exactly exactly but i feel that everybody should at least do something to um keep themself in shape to their own body 

88.01 88.68 A: [sigh] 

89.70 101.78 A: well uh right now right now i'm just having trouble eating at all i'm i'm ah undergoing chemo right now and so that that puts a who- that put- that that explains the er 

93.56 95.26 B: um as far as that's concerned 

101.85 104.17 A: exercise situation as well 

104.39 105.44 A: uh 

105.71 108.16 A: but uh how about you how about yourself 

108.22 109.47 B: (( um mhm )) 

112.62 113.36 B: yeah 

121.20 122.45 B: right and 

122.47 133.26 B: my for myself as well i've had knee surgery and so i understand how the the impact um because i i did a lot of things in high school that looking back i shouldn't have 

128.97 130.89 A: so that's walking in place 

133.68 139.90 B: um that i didn't at the time think anything about because i was young and it didn't hurt then but 

134.67 135.62 A: ah 

140.03 142.09 B: um didn't realize that 

142.56 145.10 B: exactly exactly but uh 

145.23 152.84 B: yeah i'm i'm really being in- into stretching um i think everybody should um stretch i mean and there's 

147.99 149.68 A: some sort of calisthenics 

152.89 164.02 B: you know all kinds of different things for [mn] you know somebody who can't you know had a broken arm or something there's still lots of different exercises that you can do to to um recuperate the muscles and to get 

162.89 165.35 A: i i i gather you've been out of er 

164.27 167.54 B: that working through because my um my stepdad he uh 

165.66 167.35 A: from doing that for a while 

167.76 174.90 B: he had heart surgery um and he he's going through his legs there for a while were would go numb 

174.62 178.75 A: i understand my husband uh is retired navy 

174.99 178.52 B: um because of the the low blood pressure down to his legs 

178.64 186.73 B: and now he's um and he's he was pretty overweight um and now he's going through uh the same thing the ork- the treatment 

179.06 180.56 A: so [laughter] 

181.42 182.36 A: ah 

186.70 196.68 B: um and he's losing a lot of weight and he's starting getting feeling back in his legs because he's pumping the when you move your muscles you know you pump blood back in 

196.95 201.85 B: so it it just that's the way the body was just designed was to move so um 

198.09 204.25 A: yeah [laughter] well [mn] my my husband has contin- continued with the working out er 

204.37 205.40 A: 'cause 

217.10 220.29 A: it doesn't have to be military standard [laughter] 

218.19 222.16 B: yes it is yes it is it takes a lot of discipline to um 

222.45 223.21 B: to 

223.25 233.91 B: kee- at least keep a routine and that's why i think it's really important for people to um i mean it may sound really cheesy and dumb but to actually write down a goal 

234.20 248.87 B: you know have a long term and short term goals of what you want and to write a routine down of something you know it doesn't you know necessarily mean that you know i'm going to run a hundred miles a day or something but just to say okay i'll get up in the morning and i'll stretch for five minutes before i 

234.45 235.53 A: (( um )) 

237.54 241.03 A: i've i've i've i've tried various types of 

241.60 242.74 A: uh 

242.75 247.10 A: forms of working out over the years and i definitely like the 

247.25 248.27 A: the best 

248.43 251.96 A: of course now i've i've got so i have 

248.97 250.57 B: you know go about my day 

250.73 257.27 B: you know but if you actually instead of s- just saying it if you actually write it down i fou- i found out that most people when they actually 

252.15 257.13 A: such bad joints that i think is about all i can stand in a class 

257.24 266.29 B: see something that they hand written down and if they stick it on a note on a little sticky note and stick it on the mirror to say you know work out today 

263.07 264.44 A: (( mm yeah )) 

266.62 271.64 B: that it kind of puts it into your mental and it gets everything else um 

272.55 282.97 B: throughout your life if you're having any you know stress from your work or whatever the case may be if you just do get a few little bit of exercising in um throughout 

274.74 276.16 A: yeah 

276.33 278.61 A: but you but you pay for it later on 

279.74 280.63 A: yeah 

280.79 281.93 A: (( i uh )) 

283.04 286.83 B: the week then it kind of helps maintain everything else 

293.61 295.07 B: [laughter] 

295.19 300.91 B: yeah i'm a very forgetful not necessarily forgetful person but i just um 

301.03 302.31 B: tend to ah 

302.70 307.35 B: put things off i'm i procrastinate so i [noise] 

313.88 327.39 A: (( mm yeah )) 

325.12 326.11 B: hello 

326.39 327.18 B: hello 

327.81 328.73 B: okay

333.57 335.08 B: wow that was weird 

338.57 341.28 B: yes that's what they said and so i was like well that was 

341.62 344.46 B: that wasn't very nice they didn't even say your ten minutes is up 

342.79 343.84 A: um 

344.49 346.35 B: [laughter] exactly 

344.92 348.27 A: and of course the tough thing is that once you 

347.10 347.93 B: wow 

349.42 351.44 A: stop doing something it's 

351.59 353.80 A: so easy to stay stopped 

354.33 355.47 A: uh [laughter] 

357.15 360.89 B: i think something like that i'm [mn] i'm not really sure

418.06 422.42 B: able to how often would you do it a week or a month or 

422.33 425.93 A: mm i can see where writing it down would be a good idea 

426.40 427.37 A: ah
