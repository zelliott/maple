412.14 413.41 B: that's it 

413.94 417.47 B: the other thing that goes on now that i'm thinking about it 

417.59 420.38 B: like the guns we've seen some 

421.13 428.49 B: you know what with the guns um that have passed by not to say that they were aiming them at anything but 

428.81 434.57 B: i guess in school they talked about how you know airplanes have guns on them 

434.15 435.83 A: mhm 

434.91 442.00 B: and ships and things carry those she asks you know what what what are they going to do with those

443.53 446.35 B: why is it that they have to do that 

447.30 455.39 B: and and i guess the the hardest thing is just trying to explain in a language that she will understand that none of it is right 

455.06 456.32 A: right right 

455.99 459.81 B: but it's being done to try to help you know 

458.91 459.96 A: mhm 

459.87 464.64 B: those people who achieve what she has you know you know do 

463.20 464.54 A: exactly 

465.45 469.58 B: what they'd like to do and not be punished because they did it 

470.36 472.15 A: right exactly 

472.99 479.53 B: and i guess you'll say okay for a little while and then i guess something else you know kind of like um 

483.01 484.58 B: kind of like um 

486.47 497.11 B: well well what do we do you know are we goi- like when they were talking about on the news to put the tape on the windows and all the water together 

494.34 495.65 A: oh yeah 

496.62 498.23 A: right right 

498.00 501.35 B: why is it we gotta do that we can't go outside 

500.89 502.14 A: right 

501.49 503.75 B: we can't do this we can't do that 

504.24 507.66 B: it's like i told her i say mommy's not gonna do anything of that 

507.53 509.06 A: [laughter] 

508.66 513.52 B: i say because when i see it like you know if you're a believer in god 

513.78 517.18 B: and if it's your time to go this is your time to go 

517.18 518.55 A: right right right 

518.09 520.40 B: and there's nothing you can do 

520.49 523.53 B: to stop it or to um 

523.92 525.99 B: you know increase your time here 

525.76 527.07 A: mhm 

527.19 532.26 B: she kind of like you know she'll look like okay i'm satisfied with that answer but 

532.46 536.34 B: now and then she will come back with her little inquisitive mind
