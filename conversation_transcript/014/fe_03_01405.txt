14.26 15.25 B: oh 

15.88 18.58 B: so has september eleven changed you much 

18.64 32.29 A: um i wouldn't say that much i'm mean i guess it'd be it'd be hard not to have it you know change you at all um i guess when i when i go on a plane you know i sort of think a little a little differently but 

25.70 26.58 B: uh-huh 

31.68 33.35 B: you still go on planes 

32.90 36.83 A: yeah i still go on planes do do you not go on planes or 

33.61 35.35 B: [laughter] 

36.41 41.07 B: uh i traveled when i was younger but i don't think i would take a plane nowadays 

40.91 43.30 A: so you haven't taken one since september eleven 

42.81 44.07 B: no uh-uh 

44.16 46.62 A: just because because of that or 

46.32 53.56 B: um yeah i think if i had to go anywhere i think i flying would not be an option for me 

53.36 54.61 A: really 

53.96 55.25 B: yeah 

54.94 59.45 A: yeah i guess i'm you know i'm younger so i sort of you know um 

60.03 65.84 A: sort of i sort of go by a philosophy that you know if something's gonna happen it's gonna happen but you know i mean 

64.22 65.77 B: yeah that's true 

66.04 75.33 A: i mean i did i did fly a couple of weeks right after september eleven which was which was a little scary um yeah about october first 

71.93 73.00 B: oh did ya 

75.93 77.87 A: but you know i mean 

78.30 88.94 A: you know i sort of just you know i mean i take everything into account and you know i'm just aware but for me you know it's not gonna stop me from from doing something like that 

87.98 95.99 B: yeah that's a good attitude to have i actually did this a few minutes ago with a woman and right at the end of our ten minutes we got cut off 

96.30 97.18 A: really 

96.86 102.00 B: and i don't know what happened but she works at a federal building in um 

102.20 104.67 B: uh missouri i think she said 

105.19 107.79 B: and there was all kind a v._a. hospital 

107.99 121.64 B: was where she worked and there was all kinds of changes going on there she said security was really tight and they had all these drills and [sigh] emergency call back to get everybody you know the doctors and stuff back as fast as they could you know 

109.02 110.82 A: mhm 

121.92 129.09 B: she said they didn't really have very good reaction to that you know it was hard getting a hold of the doctors having them come back in emergency you know what i mean 

128.85 136.60 A: yeah actually um i go to i'm from philadelphia but i go to school at uh university of maryland which is you know about seven miles from d._c. 

136.34 137.33 B: oh 

136.98 146.45 A: so living that close there's you know constantly you know alerts and you know all kinds of you know warnings and stuff like that so 

145.38 146.95 B: oh that's real close 

146.93 153.99 A: yeah it's sort of uh you sort of get used to it i guess but you know i mean there is there is there are certain days i remember 

153.87 163.11 A: a couple a month or two or go like i think on a friday that you know they told you know people we re just talking oh don't go into d._c. like there's supposed to be a big attack or 

162.96 169.94 A: you know like you hear you hear stuff like that all the time but like it's hard it's hard to tell you know what's you know what can you do i mean 

163.29 164.40 B: really 

165.67 166.84 B: (( uh-huh you )) 

169.88 172.30 B: can't stay away from work every day [laughter] 

171.49 175.34 A: yeah i know you can't i mean if you work if you work down there you really 

174.95 176.09 B: yeah 

175.36 176.34 A: um 

176.41 179.12 A: you really can't stay away from it i mean would you 

179.47 183.54 A: what about anything else you that you've changed since september eleventh or 

183.82 188.11 B: i think i'm more patriotic you know i mean uh i i 

185.89 187.66 A: yeah 

188.32 192.13 B: i don't you know i don't know about this war and everything but uh 

192.29 201.44 B: they decided they'd do it so i decided to be supportive that's all and i really wanted to give it to 'em because of everything they put us through 

195.80 197.48 A: yeah i 

201.45 207.09 B: and i know that's probably the wrong way to think you know but i was really glad that bush decided to 

207.16 208.45 B: do what he did 

209.00 211.53 A: give it to them meaning the iraqis or 

211.48 219.11 B: yeah you know hussein and osmand and you know osama bin laden and i just have a hard time saying their names but 

218.41 219.50 A: [laughter] 

219.17 225.91 B: and i know there's no there's no assurance that they have them or that they got hussein or whatever but 

226.03 229.14 B: i think they'll i think they'll get him eventually don't you 

229.14 231.56 A: yeah uh for hussein you mean 

230.97 232.34 B: yeah 

231.60 238.11 A: i would think so i mean he's pretty you know crippled right now i mean at least even if he's around uh 

238.15 239.36 A: it'd be kinda 

238.46 242.47 B: probably got a castle underground just like the one he had above ground 

241.91 247.58 A: yeah i think for me being you know i'm only twenty one september eleventh was sort of like 

247.48 251.67 A: you know sort of changed everything because i i was used to growing up just 

251.45 254.77 A: you know in a time of no wars and you know all kinds of 

254.56 267.81 A: peace and prosperity and you know for me i mean i was when it happened i was still you know only seven miles from d._c. and you know knew plenty of people that a few people that had you know relatives that died and a few people a ton of people that 

267.72 270.77 A: i mean everybody at my school that's from the area basically has 

270.61 279.84 A: a parent that works for the federal government so everybody i knew was you know trying to call their parents and you know try and figure out where everybody was so for for me it's sort of like 

276.08 277.07 B: oh wow 

279.11 279.72 B: (( [cough] )) 

279.62 290.91 A: you know it's sort of like i look at it before and after because my outlook just on you know that you know everything is not always you're going to be as peaceful as it was before 

290.36 291.53 B: yeah 

290.98 294.06 A: just sort of really you know dramatically changed because 

293.30 295.89 B: it is a it is an eye opener 

296.76 303.26 A: yeah i mean up until up until that point you know i would never i wouldn't think twice about you know 

303.14 312.52 A: flying for one or you know i mean who would nobody would think that people would fly planes into you know buildings i mean i just who who would have ever thought that 

308.91 310.60 B: right yeah 

311.78 312.74 B: yeah 

312.37 324.79 A: you know but it just it just forces you to look at things differently now and you know i think i think in addition to being patriotic just to to like value uh you know relationships you have with people and 

324.18 327.99 B: did it make you didn't it make you realize just how much those people hate us 

328.07 330.56 A: what from other countries 

330.05 332.28 B: yeah the terrorists the ones that 

331.23 335.36 A: yeah but and i and i think the thing is like i mean 

335.58 342.30 A: for me it seems like that what what they hate us for is like you know our biggest strength you know 

342.03 342.79 B: yeah 

342.16 348.81 A: like because we're free and that's what we value so much is what the other countries you know hate us for so it's like 

348.65 363.14 A: you you can hav- it's hard to like to have all the freedoms we have and not you know be targeted and you know it's sort of like seems like it's a price sometime for being as free as we are that other people are gonna wanna you know do stuff or 

363.14 364.36 A: whatever 

363.97 366.83 B: but we welcome 'em to come here and be free with us 

367.14 369.13 A: yeah i mean you know 

369.32 375.76 A: i mean i'm sort of uh you know obviously everything that happened was horrible but at the same time i sort of 

375.60 388.96 A: i sort of cringe when there's a lot of you know crack downs on civil liberties and you know just you know it's like it's just a personal thing of how much you're willing to give up to feel safe you know i mean some people think um 

386.38 387.82 B: mhm 

389.02 389.95 A: you know 

390.19 394.87 A: something is going too far while you know others would rather you know 

394.79 406.92 A: have that and feel safer you know just like it's a tough line to cross as far as you know what they're doing with you know ashcroft and all that you know well is it really protecting us or is it making people more fearful it's 

406.94 409.82 A: it's uh it's tough you know to decide 

409.84 418.83 B: yeah you know you watch the polls and stuff on the internet it's pretty much split fifty fifty you know the people that support the war and the people that didn't 

418.53 432.62 A: yeah i mean at at first i don't think i necessarily did but like once once it starts like you can't help but support it you know i mean i don't want you know soldiers to die and even though i may have been against uh the point of it in the beginning 

425.20 426.41 B: right 

432.52 439.20 A: you know like i'm i'm gonna feel happy like when you know they win and you know they uh i mean it would be pointless 

439.51 444.39 A: not to once it's already started 'cause you can't really do anything about it 

443.93 449.54 B: right i was reading on the internet today that the iraqis are free now and they want us to leave 

449.69 453.49 B: they're they're afraid that there's going to be american occupation 

449.75 450.67 A: really 

453.58 455.80 B: we're going to take over their country 

455.72 457.56 A: mhm 

456.22 459.60 B: i don't think any americans wanna live there do we [laughter] 

458.96 465.69 A: no i mean i don't i think i think what they're saying is that you know they need some time to set something up but 

465.04 471.49 B: well that's what they're already doing they're already trying to get a little type of uh i don't know what you call it government or whatever in place 

471.49 473.29 A: mhm 

472.79 474.15 B: for the people 

474.49 476.01 A: yeah i mean 

476.04 481.61 B: look at they went and looted you know their store- that's where they live and they went and destroyed everything 

481.51 489.25 A: yeah i mean it's you know it's it's tough to know what you know people in that situation are are thinking and doing you know 'cause 

488.42 492.81 B: yeah freedom is probably it's it's a large cookie to uh 

492.13 498.77 A: i mean if you've never had it you know i mean we take it for granted we've always had it so we don't go around looting everything you know every 

495.74 496.96 B: yeah 

498.44 499.38 B: right 

498.70 507.77 A: every second but you know to go from such a dramatic change i mean there's gonna be you know a period of you know adjustment you know whether it's looting or 

506.72 508.55 B: yeah really [laughter] 

507.89 511.00 A: or something else i don't know but um 

510.44 511.59 B: craziness 

511.61 515.07 A: i don't know but it's i mean as far as september eleven it just seems like 

515.30 523.71 A: i don't know it's it's even though we're you know we're so much more aware of it now like just my personal view is that you know 

520.36 521.19 B: (( mhm )) 

524.14 529.63 A: things can still happen and you know like it's hard to to totally 

529.84 534.05 A: to prevent everything you know even after we had such a thing 

533.29 534.23 B: yeah 

534.16 536.95 A: that i don't know like you know you just gotta be 

537.09 544.64 A: you know you just gotta be there for your own self at least i think you know mindful and you know i don't think live in fear but you know at the same time 

544.54 545.96 B: keep your eyes open 

545.67 551.53 A: yeah i mean if people are gonna wanna do stuff then you know they're gonna wanna do stuff but 

550.10 554.78 B: yeah i think i've become more aware of people around me now when i'm out and about 

554.16 556.00 A: mhm 

554.83 565.15 B: you know i don't know why and i try not to look at other people like what are they up too you know i try not to be suspicious or anything like that but i do i do keep my eyes a lot more open than i used to 

565.05 570.37 A: yeah i mean just like you can't really you know after what happened you can't really uh 

570.73 575.30 A: uh you know go around just being oblivious i mean if you you know 

573.35 583.42 B: right right and after it after it first happened that my first thought was you know i didn't really think much of it because i i thought well this isn't going to affect me you know this is nothing 

583.47 597.86 B: and then after the couple of days afterwards that had past and i realized how many people had died and then i was seeing people around me that had relatives and you know friends and stuff that lived in the area and then i really saw the devastation 

587.89 589.32 A: yeah 

597.77 598.89 A: yeah 

598.35 599.89 B: you know i didn't really see if pers-
