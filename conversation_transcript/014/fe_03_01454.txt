0.38 1.52 A: hi 

1.15 3.70 B: hi [laughter] 

2.86 5.48 A: my name's shannon and i'm from arizona 

5.19 7.93 B: and i'm nancy and i'm in north carolina 

8.16 9.54 A: well hello nancy 

9.06 11.49 B: well hello [laughter] 

11.04 14.88 A: i i have a quick question how did you find out about this how did you find out about this 

14.42 20.93 B: um a friend of mine called me about the study and then then we went on from there 

18.02 18.78 A: (( oh )) 

21.30 32.27 B: [sigh] but we need to talk about september eleventh and changes and all of that stuff have you made any changes in your lifestyle since september eleventh 

32.81 35.30 A: personally i really haven't 

34.97 35.94 B: yeah 

35.79 40.77 A: (( um being on the west coast i don't there wasn't i was kinda more detached from everything like right right and even people i know who did have like )) 

37.96 38.92 B: yeah 

40.88 43.82 A: (( friends and family like it was more of a loss it wasn't more of )) 

43.18 47.32 B: mhm you don't have family or friends out in this side of the world 

43.89 44.61 A: (( a )) 

46.96 59.28 A: (( change of lifestyle kind of event like they're looking at more as like a grieving kinda thing and like emotionally i was affected but like otherwise i haven't you know i still fly i don't i haven't stocked up on like duck tape or anything )) 

47.42 48.78 B: yeah 

50.58 51.76 B: mhm 

56.65 57.92 B: mhm 

59.90 60.67 A: (( you )) 

61.69 62.48 A: (( know )) 

62.59 63.41 A: (( like )) 

63.60 66.23 A: (( i haven't i haven't changed as far as i was concerned )) 

65.88 66.93 B: yeah 

66.37 70.04 A: (( and i mean i almost lots of people obviously have but right right right right )) 

69.81 72.60 B: mhm [laughter] 

70.06 71.16 A: (( right right right [laughter] right )) 

71.63 75.19 A: (( [laughter] but uh i i feel like um that i would probably want to do something to stop something from )) 

74.47 76.04 B: yeah 

75.39 78.82 A: (( happening rather than what i probably would have done )) 

78.86 80.85 B: yeah um 

80.98 93.48 B: i the day that it happened see i live about nine hundred miles from my family and my mom and and my brother live within earshot of boston's logan airport 

93.75 98.92 B: and my brother would go into boston a lot for business 

99.36 108.69 B: um driving on the highways going to the airport you know so he was kinda close to things and we didn't know what was going to happen so 

102.93 103.64 A: (( before )) 

108.70 115.10 B: i was frantically i was calling them telling them don't go into boston 'cause we didn't know what was going to happen there 

114.69 115.72 A: (( which is )) 

115.59 122.06 B: and my mom hadn't heard anything about it because she doesn't watch television or listen to the radio during the day 

122.12 135.49 B: and i just said don't make any plans to go into the city and and the words that i remember saying that this it seems to be kind of a pivotal point for me was we're in for it now aren't we 

135.84 143.70 B: you know and and that kind of sets a tone for for my awareness about okay our 

143.96 146.66 B: our sweet life has changed 

146.27 147.07 A: (( kinda )) 

146.72 151.51 B: and i'm i'm probably older than you are i'm uh 

151.41 163.86 B: i was raised in the fifties where every all the all the moms wore skirts and stockings and and and cooked tuna noodle casserole and [laughter] the real leave it to beaver stuff 

163.30 164.17 A: (( run )) 

164.14 170.61 B: and um i just felt so incredibly safe and life was perfect and then 

171.03 176.22 B: now that we've got this kind of weirdness hanging over our heads and 

176.30 179.17 B: i think what i'm left with more is 

179.69 181.27 B: well what do i do 

181.37 182.17 A: (( away )) 

181.49 195.87 B: not not gee i got to change my life or i'm never going to fly again or any of that 'cause i do fly i do travel everywhere i uh i think i conduct my life exactly the same as i always have but there's this edge to it 

196.17 199.03 B: and i think probably 

199.57 201.05 B: if something 

201.14 207.11 B: really unusual happened in an airport i would be someone to act 

207.64 213.14 B: like i'd leap on somebody you know [laughter] whereas before i would probably run away 

213.62 216.72 B: so i think that's probably 

218.83 220.21 A: (( right )) 

221.96 223.44 B: (( i mean i )) 

224.28 224.98 B: (( that's )) 

225.66 226.97 B: (( yet to be )) 

228.25 229.75 B: (( tested thank goodness )) 

230.54 231.23 B: (( [laughter] )) 

234.41 241.39 B: so a little bit more defensive and proactive than before but otherwise i haven't changed anything and 

241.68 248.23 B: there's one thing that kinda got to me and that is that i think one of my friends died in the world trade center 

248.24 249.18 A: oh wow mhm 

248.88 251.19 B: yeah 'cause she lived um 

251.32 261.50 B: in the shadow of one of the towers and [sigh] they they kinda would show those the buildings around there 

261.09 261.96 A: right 

261.60 263.36 B: and hers was gone 

263.31 264.18 A: oh 

263.78 265.36 B: and she works in her 

265.55 267.95 B: where she lives and there was a 

268.03 269.59 B: you know it's just like 

269.63 270.68 B: okay 

270.77 272.93 B: and i i don't want to know 

272.70 273.65 A: right 

273.01 279.12 B: you know i i don't know if that's like being an ostrich and hid- hiding my head in the sand or 

279.96 284.52 B: i kinda don't want to know 'cause i'm afraid how that would affect me 

284.20 285.20 A: yeah 

284.89 292.56 B: you know i see her every ten years so let's see we got eight more years to go [laughter] before i check her out again 

288.97 289.65 A: [laughter] 

292.98 295.66 B: ah boy so um 

295.67 302.42 B: have you always lived in arizona and always had the kind of separation feeling from the east coast 

302.22 304.55 A: well i i lived in chicago 

304.10 305.44 B: mhm 

305.29 307.59 A: that's not really the we- east coast but 

306.98 313.11 B: no it's right it's in the middle it's easter it's more easter than than than santa cruz [laughter] 

307.97 309.04 A: [laughter] 

312.06 315.88 A: yeah but for the most part i was on the west coast and so like 

316.15 321.69 A: on the west i think a lot of people on the west coast have a big detachment from the east coast and 

320.08 321.14 B: yeah 

321.93 322.82 A: i mean 

322.98 333.82 A: i didn't even know i i was at work when it happened and we normally have t._v.s on in the lobbies but we were moving at the time so we had no t._v.s no radios no nothing 

325.85 326.74 B: uh-huh 

328.34 329.24 B: yeah 

333.24 334.80 B: oh my goodness 

334.21 338.81 A: and somebody came in and they were like a plane like flew into the world trade center and we're like okay 

338.82 340.22 A: you know and didn't even 

338.87 339.51 B: (( oh )) 

340.47 344.48 A: didn't even faze us we didn't think about it we didn't register it 

340.59 341.61 B: yeah 

343.85 345.58 B: mhm 

344.98 346.34 A: we kept working 

346.27 346.89 B: (( mm )) 

346.47 347.78 A: and um 

347.85 352.62 A: like around four o'clock my boss called and said you know do you want you workers to go home and i'm like why

374.43 378.79 A: he's like well we're letting people off early if they if they're affected by this and i'm like well 

378.94 387.50 A: i don't think anyone's affected but i'll ask and none of my workers had any like i have like over four hundred workers and out of four hundred workers not a single one of them 

384.03 385.15 B: wow 

387.52 390.95 A: knew about it either but were affected by it 

387.64 388.93 B: (( wow )) 

390.78 394.23 B: directly like family or friends or 

391.52 392.73 A: directly 

393.54 394.41 A: right 

394.27 397.33 B: or and and and your business did not have any 

397.24 406.86 A: we we ha- i mean we have we were we're nation wide so there was people there was people that we had in the area but and like 'cause i work for a company called labor ready 

400.50 401.40 B: uh-huh 

403.21 404.45 B: yeah 

406.47 408.10 B: uh-huh oh 

407.08 409.36 A: they actually provided the temp labor 

408.90 409.94 B: sure 

409.43 410.75 A: to help clean up 

410.89 412.04 B: (( oh my goodness )) 

411.16 412.76 A: for part of it 

412.19 416.27 B: well that really did affect your life didn't it in some way 

414.63 415.56 A: but 

415.57 418.52 A: in some way like my company i worked for helped but like 

417.87 418.97 B: yeah 

418.74 424.42 A: i mean in the aftermath we were able to help but at the time of it happening it wasn't 

421.43 422.56 B: yeah 

425.57 429.96 A: it wasn't really something that that hit us like really oh wow that you know 

429.85 437.37 A: and it wasn't till that evening when i got home where my husband said to me you don't want to watch the news and i'm like well yeah i want to know what's going on 

435.28 436.27 B: yeah 

437.27 445.37 A: and that's when i first saw the images and it was just like wow i missed all this to- it was like all this happened today while i was at work 

438.60 439.59 B: mhm 

439.64 440.75 B: yeah 

444.74 446.13 B: mhm 

445.76 446.72 A: (( um )) 

447.01 448.90 A: i don't know it's like 

449.92 454.27 A: i think the people who are more on the east coast more likely know somebody who was 

453.78 454.83 B: mhm 

454.53 456.13 A: close to it and so 

455.36 462.53 B: yeah it's true but doesn't it make you feel a tiny bit more vulnerable because they didn't know that was going to happen 

462.45 466.59 A: well i mean yeah i mean a little bit more vulnerable but 

465.74 466.65 B: mhm 

467.46 470.26 A: where i'm looking at it right now i live in arizona 

470.57 484.77 B: which is gorgeous anyway my first time really visiting there was last summer when my um friend and i drove from north carolina and went through we went down to el paso driving and then went up 

472.28 473.57 A: [laughter] 

482.74 483.54 A: (( right )) 

484.76 490.95 B: through tuscon and up to scottsdale where we were going to meet meet up with a whole bunch of friends um do you 

489.46 492.83 A: yeah i act- i actually live in scottsdale yeah 

492.20 495.79 B: really we stayed at the um the 

496.29 498.78 B: uh scottsdale princess resort 

498.41 499.75 A: oh that's beautiful 

499.34 500.72 B: (( oh god yes )) 

500.09 501.50 A: that's really beautiful 

500.88 505.17 B: i i just said this is the way i want my life to me forever and ever 

503.59 504.50 A: yeah 

505.00 510.24 A: yeah [laughter] but the problem with living here is we're not by any oceans 

505.95 506.83 B: [laughter] 

508.15 509.06 B: uh-huh 

509.73 511.75 B: yeah i know that's the tough one 

510.46 511.99 A: we're not [laughter] 

512.16 518.69 A: we're not near oceans and our theory is a lot of people think the same way as i do this is scary 

514.12 515.20 B: right 

517.63 519.48 B: oh this is yeah 

518.92 523.23 A: is that if where someone's going to be attacked it's going to be on 

521.28 522.39 B: mhm 

523.27 524.88 A: a western border 

524.70 526.69 B: it's yeah it's going to be 

526.05 530.93 A: it's going to if it's going to be close to me it's going to be los angeles the closest thing that they might target the 

528.54 529.56 B: right 

530.46 531.47 B: right 

530.95 537.08 A: only thing i have out here is i have palaverde which is the largest nuclear facility 

534.39 535.55 B: mhm 

536.75 538.07 B: yep 

537.20 538.50 A: but 

538.77 540.68 A: from what i know that thing is 

541.08 546.80 A: the heaviest guarded facility there is in the area and i have luke air force base here too 

543.58 544.79 B: mhm 

546.36 547.68 B: yeah 

547.12 553.04 A: and they have a no fly zone if anything flies in their zone they're basically even ordered to shoot it down 

550.26 551.35 B: mhm 

552.57 553.78 B: yeah 

553.36 554.23 A: so 

554.44 560.60 A: even in any and they tell me even if something hits it it it will cause no damage whatsoever to the facility 

557.02 558.11 B: mhm 

560.16 561.08 B: whew 

561.24 565.17 B: so has it been a no fly zone for a long long time 

563.98 567.75 A: it's been a no fly zone for i think for basically forever 

567.35 570.60 B: since they installed the nuclear facility yeah 

568.92 574.59 A: yeah yeah because i mean i'm sure they're always i mean it hasn't been unheard of you know 

573.59 579.77 B: mhm sure and it it would make sense that that would be one of the first targets i would think 

579.22 580.12 A: right 

580.04 589.72 B: um any kind of major facility like that would certainly it would make everybody sit up and take notice [laughter] i mean but that's their point too 

586.17 588.33 A: yeah but then again 

588.92 595.02 A: yeah but if you think about it you know if i was a terrorist i wouldn't be thinking arizona 

594.64 595.77 B: right 

595.19 599.95 A: as my target and so i think a lot of that has to do with why people over here too have what they 

596.34 597.51 B: right
