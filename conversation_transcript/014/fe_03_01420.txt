33.67 45.37 A: actually the i'm quite it's er quite quite unlikely i'll ever fly again unless i really have to but it has nothing to do with with the fear of 

41.93 43.13 B: oh really 

45.74 51.68 A: ah some crazy faith monger crashing me into a building than it has to do with the fact that they have

80.74 91.36 B: um 'cause some of my friends who have travelled outside of the united states and come back it is hard to get back in i mean they make sure you really don't have anything so if anything i feel safer than

133.28 140.65 B: um well what else i guess we should still talk about the september eleven thing until it's ten minutes but um 

141.57 145.69 B: (( what do you think about finding osama bin laden )) 

145.79 148.40 B: do you think he's dead or alive or 

149.34 159.93 A: really like saddam hussein i don't think it matters whether he's alive or not he's i mean the organizations that 

155.27 156.23 B: mhm 

160.02 165.77 A: ah that he ran ran with and the power he had are pretty much gone 

165.59 166.70 B: mhm 

166.07 175.57 A: you know maybe he can run around in a cave and you know talk on a cell phone once in a while but if he goes outside somebody is going to ah make his head disappear 

175.40 176.45 B: right 

177.33 178.56 B: yeah 

179.87 184.29 B: mhm what else after september eleven do you look at um 

184.52 189.23 B: do you look at like arabian people or israeli people differently now 

189.37 191.53 B: after that or are you 

191.89 195.25 B: did you not do you not really change anything about that 

194.95 201.80 A: oh i am more under for myself i am just more contemptuous of religion than ever before 

201.26 202.15 B: (( huh-uh )) 

201.85 210.15 A: you know if those people hadn't believed that a giant invisible man was going to give them prizes for blowing themselves up after they died 

210.17 216.71 A: or for giving them prizes after they died for blowing themselves up the whole mess wouldn't have happened 

217.20 226.34 B: are you speaking of just those people that were on the planes or are you speaking about like the ones that are here in america too that are muslim and believe um 

225.70 228.35 A: muslim christian wiccan 

228.89 236.69 A: ferrianthropists whatever you name it they're all they're all one in the same to me 

237.37 238.46 A: how about you 

239.12 240.86 B: um i don't 

240.87 249.19 B: ah if they're like the ones that are here in america do feel sorry for the americans that did die in the planes and in the um 

249.60 263.31 B: and in the twin towers i don't think any blame should be given to them even though i know a lot of people probably look down at them ever since this happened i mean i personally don't um i don't think it's because of them that 

263.24 267.86 B: stuff like this happened i think it's just that there's like a few that decided to do it 

269.09 272.11 A: well it is just a few crazy people but 

271.49 272.50 B: right 

273.31 274.29 A: (( uh )) 

274.36 275.43 A: i'm a 

277.06 279.94 A: i'm sceptical of like ah 

283.44 285.82 A: ah just a second 

293.47 294.33 A: [noise] 

295.29 295.85 A: (( [mn] )) 

296.00 297.69 A: (( you know i'm just ah )) 

299.42 302.60 A: oh well my train of thought just jumped the tracks ah 

302.15 305.63 B: you're sceptical of what you were talking about being sceptical about something 

305.35 312.06 A: i'm just sceptical of all authority i i mean it's like i'm i'm bashing religion because it's 

312.17 320.99 A: because the faith in organized religion leads people to do really ridiculous things but it's just faith in general that that bugs me 

320.97 324.16 B: so you don't believe in religion then 

324.05 324.84 A: no 

325.29 330.24 B: oh and you look down at those who have a belief or have a faith in something 

330.61 332.03 A: (( um )) 

333.81 344.24 A: don't really look down on it because most people want it most people want make believe you know i just and it's n- not harmful 

344.21 350.68 A: for most people you know most people don't do crazy things because they are religious 

351.29 356.78 A: and again it's not just fr- it's not religion that is the bad thing it's faith i mean chi- 

356.67 368.18 A: look at communist china it's a total you know they're like they're like totally anti religion if you are religious they'll you know they'll beat you up for it in china but 

366.71 367.72 B: mhm 

368.39 370.02 B: [noise] 

371.02 372.16 B: but what 

371.48 385.82 A: but they but the but their government is based on faith the reason they you know the reason they don't want you to be religious is because their government is based on faith in the state you're supposed to you are supposed to worship the state there like you worship god 

381.27 382.75 B: mhm 

386.74 394.91 A: so it's still that's still faith though you are supposed to just give them everything and they are going to take care of you and don't don't ask questions 

395.47 401.50 B: did you have did you think this way ever since september eleventh or has this always been your mentality on it 

401.47 408.38 A: oh i've held those views for quite a while but september eleventh just kind of cemented them for me 

408.29 409.42 B: (( mhm )) 

409.68 410.63 B: i see 

411.88 418.24 A: what about for you do you are you more or less sceptical of such things since that happened at 

412.29 412.95 B: oh 

417.68 421.56 B: ah i don't think it's changed i'm christian and i don't think it's 

421.84 432.55 B: changed um my views on any of it um if anything i believe september eleventh happened for a reason as sad as it is to say it i think it did happen for a reason i think there was a lesson to be learnt from it 

434.06 438.30 B: i don't believe that muslims in general 

438.85 449.68 B: i don't think worse of them or anything i believe i actually believe all religions are pretty much all the same um everybody just likes to call their main god something different but i believe 

448.49 452.80 A: least we're [laughter] at least we are in in agreement on that point 

452.44 461.29 B: right um i believe like you know some person might say god and another person might say allah but basically everybody is worshi- worshipping 

461.14 469.80 B: one main god you know there's only one god in all religions pretty much even for the hindus that say there are many gods they do have one main god 

469.73 479.54 B: and i don't believe that yeah they have one main god and then they have a bunch of little gods that like are god of this or god of that but they have one main god 

470.66 471.65 A: they do 

472.17 473.04 A: (( who is it mhm )) 

481.80 490.51 B: so i mean i don't think i don't think my views on religion or people who are muslim or anything like that have changed after september eleventh i still 

490.59 492.89 B: i i believe it happened for a reason 

493.55 502.99 B: you know a lot of people in other countries are saying you know [noise] it was basically coming to america it's like america's fault because they always want to put their nose in everybody else's business i mean 

503.16 511.75 B: i don't agree with that i mean i believe like the united states doesn't put their nose in other people's business just to do it i think they do it for 

512.29 522.11 B: for those people in those other countries so that there is someone telling their officials and their presidents and stuff that they can't do they can't treat their citizens the way they do 

520.51 521.26 A: (( [cough] )) 

523.25 531.70 A: well we put our nose in anywhere there's a compelling national interest although the i think the nineties were an example of when we 

523.32 524.25 B: but 

531.77 537.50 A: but the things you are you talking about that you know we put our noses in people's business where we interfere 

537.70 548.25 A: where we we're capricious and mean and [mn] and you know what we do doesn't always make a lot of sense i think a lot of that ha- a lot of that was the nineties 

548.57 549.78 A: because you know 

549.64 564.26 A: back in the nineties it it was you know we send our troops here we send our troops there don't really do a lot other than than harass people and kill kill random strangers and piss everybody in the world off at us 

564.52 570.13 A: and in the meantime you know like we were building all this hatred towards america then 

570.51 572.16 A: and then 

572.54 584.17 A: but not doing anything about the terrorist groups you know we they bombed the world trade centre in ninety three they tried to tried to do something in the again in the late nineties they attacked the coal 

584.36 589.07 A: they ah blew up our emba- embassies in kenya killed a couple of hundred people 

589.24 592.00 A: you know nothing wa- nothing was ever done about that 

592.28 593.35 B: mhm 

592.74 595.20 A: so they just got bolder and bolder 

598.70 599.96 B: (( i don't know i just thought it would be nice ))
