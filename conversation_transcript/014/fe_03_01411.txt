74.26 84.42 B: i'm a little bit longways away from new york so it's you know it wasn't as at home as it was for people in new york for me

109.15 112.07 A: it it's a little cold but um it's getting warmer 

112.22 115.41 A: actually it's compared to new hampshire where i grew up 

115.79 119.74 A: it's uh you know pretty temperate around here 

120.15 122.07 B: and what kind of changes have you made 

121.81 127.77 A: um i actually you know there's been some changes in my life that have happened since then i remember the 

128.66 132.40 A: night before nine eleven i was housesitting at a friend's house 

132.73 133.65 A: um 

133.66 138.73 A: it was kinda of a p- it was kinda of a peculiar night for me it was a 

139.40 150.69 A: very very strange sort of there was something in the air that night i can't put my finger on what it was but i was in this i was in this beautiful house and i was housesitting with some cats and and 

152.07 156.91 A: you know i had some strange kinda nightmarish dreams and then when i work up in the morning 

156.96 167.17 A: it was like seven o'clock in the morning i woke up and and the phone was ringing so i picked it up and somebody on the other line said you have to get out of bed and go to new york right now we need you in new york 

167.39 172.24 A: and i i was you know completely asleep and i said what 

172.60 184.29 A: what do you mean wha- what are you talking about and they said it's a have you turned the news on you know you should turn the news on and i and i said oh i haven't done that yet and they said well you know get on the news and call me back 

177.96 178.73 B: (( [noise] )) 

184.59 187.11 A: and i said i said i don't have your number 

187.63 197.60 A: and they said is this carey and i said no it's not it's hannah and they said where's carey and i said carey's actually not home she's actually overseas right now and they said oh i'm sorry we thought that 

197.97 205.39 A: i thought that you were carey and you should turn on the news because something's happened my friend carey actually works for m. s. n. b. c. so that was the reason why 

204.65 207.98 B: i was fixing to ask was she in the service or [laughter] 

205.89 207.20 A: yeah 

207.34 215.71 A: yeah and so i actually turned on the television and found out what was happening and it was it kinda played into some of the dreams i had that night which was kinda odd 

216.40 218.91 A: but i was housesitting and since then i 

219.34 220.93 A: you know it obviously had a 

221.54 222.87 A: very strong 

223.05 237.53 A: it had a strong impact on me what happened and i thought a lot about it but one of the things that sort of struck me about it was the fact that you know there was definitely an enormous amount of anger that was generated from the experience but there was also an enormous amount of analysis that 

236.87 238.39 B: right there is 

237.54 239.07 A: the country did too 

239.13 239.95 A: (( and we )) 

239.18 243.95 B: there is a lot of fear here too because we're like one of the fifth largest ports [laughter] 

243.46 245.70 A: (( yes yeah )) 

244.13 255.80 B: and that was very nerve wracking every time and we live by the naval base so every time an airplane or a jet or something would go by it was there was so much air traffic [laughter] 

255.22 260.95 A: yeah yeah yeah so it it was kind of it was um 

261.64 263.77 A: it was interesting to see that 

263.81 273.13 A: there was it there was several different responses to what happened not just anger but several different things that occurred and came out of nine eleven 

272.97 274.11 B: yes 

273.43 274.42 A: um 

275.97 277.35 A: and i 

278.38 279.48 A: you know i 

279.59 281.16 A: since then i've 

281.34 294.54 A: changed my life my life has changed um a little bit you know i i started to see somebody and we've really hit it off and we've sort of moved in together so that's different than things were at around nine eleven [sigh] and 

294.44 299.62 A: uh what else has happened there's been some tragedies in my family as well 

300.09 308.95 A: although they've been through i've been a little bit far removed from them because i live on the other side of the country and i'm not it's not that i don't love my family but i'm not necessarily as 

309.14 312.45 A: closely tied to them as other people are 

312.01 313.11 B: right 

312.53 313.97 A: tied to their families 

314.68 315.53 B: yes 

314.77 317.28 A: so anyway oh i interrupted you 

317.35 323.69 B: well since nine eleven let's see last october texas was hit by a bunch of tornadoes 

323.13 325.00 A: oh wow 

324.14 331.96 B: we were one of the lucky few that our house is not totally destroyed but made unlivable 

332.13 333.48 A: wow 

333.11 340.08 B: our ceilings caved in we had an electric fire which made our house to where we didn't have any electricity at all 

340.47 343.92 B: and it's just been a hectic couple of years 

343.81 344.85 A: yeah 

344.74 346.95 B: [noise] you want it out 

346.96 348.58 B: i'm sorry my daughter 

348.30 350.26 A: that's all right 

348.81 350.91 B: [laughter] you have any children 

350.63 353.00 A: oh i don't actually have any children currently 

353.07 355.85 A: planning on children but don't have any right now 

355.18 356.25 B: how old are you 

356.13 357.82 A: i'm actually thirty six 

357.38 358.48 B: thirty six 

358.09 359.28 A: yeah 

358.49 359.77 B: i'm thirty two 

360.01 360.82 A: uh 

361.52 362.54 A: so 

362.03 367.15 B: and so um your friend carey they work for m. s. n. b. c. 

366.74 367.86 A: yep 

367.26 369.89 B: did they cover any of the stories or 

369.25 370.77 A: uh she 

371.24 376.62 A: to my recollection she didn't you know she did write an article but it wasn't it wasn't directly 

376.98 381.77 A: related to what nine ele- it was more like the aftermath of nine eleven but um 

382.07 391.13 A: i don't know actually i don't know the answer to that because i was so overwhelmed and i was actually also working on a site that was covering the news and so i was caught up in my own world um 

391.19 395.50 A: she has done some stories about the current crisis 

395.94 398.82 A: and the current war with iraq uh 

397.54 398.43 B: (( oh )) 

399.01 402.88 B: don't get me started [laughter] 

399.95 411.99 A: oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean it's amazing you know how everyone's in sync you know and even states that generally disagree tend to agree you know it's kinda interesting to see 

411.31 417.12 B: yeah it yeah don't get me started on that subject i don't think they wanna hear 

412.00 413.38 A: yeah 

416.32 423.40 A: [laughter] i don't know i mean i'd be curious i actually my boyfriend started a political discussion list 

417.15 418.49 B: [laughter] 

423.42 424.37 A: um 

424.49 432.45 A: which has got you know it started off because there were members of my family and my extended family who um just disagree rather 

432.50 433.29 A: you know 

433.63 444.29 A: passionately on a political level that had we had this email chain going around to the family and i see these i've been seeing these for years and i usually don't have time to read them because they're just overwhelming 

444.42 445.42 A: um 

446.01 451.78 A: and they're twenty pages each so i just i don't have time you know uh and so i did respond to something one of my 

448.45 449.61 B: right 

451.88 457.86 A: my uncle said and uh he responded by you know kinda sending a flame mail back at me and saying something 

458.36 470.37 A: you know being angry at me and i didn't say anything i said something very nonchalant and not particularly political so i was kinda surprised that he had that response but in any case my boyfriend responded to him 

462.17 462.98 B: (( [laughter] )) 

470.75 485.53 A: and then that started a big email thread back and forth and then he he started this political discussion list and then he included some of our friends and some of his extended family and it's turned into this very large thing [laughter] 

484.37 488.18 B: yeah right our family's kinda split on it also 

487.70 489.53 A: yeah 

488.66 493.38 B: i have um retired uh drill sergeants and stuff in 

493.12 494.59 A: wow 

493.43 495.56 B: my family so 

495.47 496.74 A: wow 

496.64 499.87 B: vietnam vets my grandfather and so 

500.23 504.77 B: my grandmother's got a different outlook on it than my mother which was a hippie so 

505.02 509.27 B: she's like loving and peace no war and 

509.02 512.56 A: wow that's yeah that's quite yeah there's 

512.60 515.73 A: advocates on one side of the family and uh 

515.98 517.20 A: very strong 

517.34 519.69 A: very very right wing republican 

519.70 521.20 A: viewpoint on the other 

521.33 522.90 B: yes [laughter] 

522.25 528.65 A: and so it's kinda interesting to see people and that that's something i can say that's something new since nine eleven that's happening 

528.10 531.99 B: right and as far as nine eleven it seems like 

528.66 529.89 A: it started 

532.09 534.24 B: neighbors are more neighbors 

533.91 535.79 A: yes yes 

535.19 538.74 B: everybody's bonded a little bit closer 

539.33 547.93 A: yeah there's definitely this awareness that's come out of that and and more of a sense of community and maybe even more of a sense of world community than there used to be 

546.61 549.71 B: mhm my i believe so 

548.19 549.05 A: um 

549.45 559.35 A: yeah and even even if the u._s. is doing things that upset foreign countries uh there does seem to be a little more of a less of an isolationist 

559.63 560.50 A: (( uh )) 

560.87 564.66 A: attitude that americans have or have had in the past [sigh] 

562.37 563.45 B: mhm 

565.81 568.07 A: but anyway um 

568.12 571.08 B: and this is supposed to last for ten minutes right 

570.46 572.14 A: i think it is actually 

572.56 577.58 A: um but if you wanna join the political discussion list you're welcome to [laughter] just to let you know 

577.21 580.06 B: okay well how how would i do that 

579.75 581.63 A: uh you'd have to email uh
