28.52 31.56 A: look at you know what's going on in my 

31.73 39.36 A: family life my work like you know and with the people who are in my uh extended family if you would since then

44.08 45.61 A: having uh 

46.43 50.27 A: closure i'd guess you'd say you know not leaving any big loose ends 

50.03 51.92 B: [laughter] 

50.48 52.61 A: [laughter] um 

53.20 58.10 A: my you know i didn't lose anybody in my family um

58.39 60.08 B: oh did you know anyone 

66.42 69.64 A: and uh you know i think we all lost 

70.09 72.40 B: i think we lost some innocence that day 

70.89 72.75 A: a lot you know 

72.81 79.13 A: uh you know as a as a huge community and a small community you know we did 

79.46 80.74 A: and how about you 

80.76 92.35 B: well i i kind of agree with ya i think i kind of re-evaluated by life as far as what um what was important what's you know and what things weren't as important 

85.61 86.55 A: mhm 

93.97 94.53 B: (( [noise] )) 

94.62 99.58 B: sorry my young son just walked in [laughter] um 

96.52 97.64 A: (( oh that's okay )) 

100.46 105.00 B: i mean i think part of it was just it was so 

105.34 106.38 B: um 

107.00 111.25 B: just out of my realm of thought that anything like that could happen 

108.70 109.70 A: mhm 

110.86 111.53 A: (( mm )) 

111.28 119.82 B: in fact i remember when i first heard about it i was getting my hair cut and someone walked into the store and said oh planes were you know 

120.01 122.47 B: crashed into the trade center 

122.05 123.37 A: mhm 

123.13 135.28 B: and my thought was not commercial liners i guess that was just so far beyond my realm of my belief it was more you know i was thinking like the airplanes you see 

126.81 127.74 A: mhm 

130.53 131.38 A: mhm 

135.10 138.26 A: yeah like a two seater type plane yeah 

136.64 142.20 B: exactly you know 'cause i it was just it was just so out there i guess 

141.90 142.64 A: (( mm )) 

142.31 143.62 B: (( and )) 

143.71 147.90 B: then you know after that i know a lot of people you know went 

148.35 151.40 B: that they didn't want to go to malls and stuff like that because of 

153.52 168.49 B: they were afraid that you know some other attacks gonna happen there and i never really you know went into that i i agree with you i just kind of you know i just kind of reevaluated my life as far as the things that were important with my family and things like that and just 

157.19 158.06 A: mhm 

166.66 167.47 A: (( mm )) 

168.93 173.46 B: you know just kinda like i i guess you kinda look at you know 

174.30 178.05 B: what have we been doing that's important and what's not [laughter] 

177.41 180.44 A: mhm and refocusing there 

179.83 181.12 B: exactly 

180.95 182.06 A: yeah 

182.27 184.13 A: well i know for me um 

184.47 188.21 A: you know i try to look at each person i see each day and appreciate 

188.35 193.48 A: you know the person being in my life even if they're someone who [laughter] drives me crazy 

192.18 195.74 B: [laughter] 

194.38 204.78 A: and i and i know for a you know for a real immediate affect the within two weeks of that i really went from being like a ten hour a day corporate kind of a person to 

204.85 210.07 A: it's a job you know 'cause that was really out of balance in my life even though i've 

206.17 207.26 B: right 

210.12 216.49 A: you know been living more of a spiritual life for the past eleven years but it was still not in balance there 

215.85 218.28 B: mhm now do you feel like since 

218.36 221.19 B: i mean i i feel like the whole country 

221.35 227.82 B: experienced this but since you were like physically closer do you think that had a more of an impact 

228.73 230.84 A: well i think that um 

228.91 230.02 B: on you 

231.26 240.43 A: for me uh i think the time that it happened was just at a time when maybe i was ready to be a little more open to that and life um 

240.49 242.71 A: i'm fifty two years old now i 

242.90 248.55 A: had just turned fifty two weeks before that happened and for me it was uh 

245.71 247.12 B: mhm 

250.14 251.38 A: that whole 

251.92 257.38 A: day and the two weeks after that were like really just looking at you know where you are in life 

257.47 267.14 A: and um 'cause i i notice with a lot of my coworkers and some of my family and friends that it had like an immediate impact but it wasn't longer lasting 

266.78 267.85 B: mhm 

267.93 269.55 A: and um 

269.68 274.95 A: and i guess too maybe because of the way i've been brought up and i've lived outside of our country that 

274.99 280.44 A: um that's that's not a normal thing here but it is pretty much everywhere else 

280.06 281.35 B: right 

280.65 282.16 A: so that um 

282.19 288.31 A: that level of blanket of security for me just got like pulled down [laughter] you know what i mean so 

286.03 288.14 B: [laughter] 

288.35 292.81 A: uh 'cause i've lived in war torn countries before and um 

293.67 299.46 A: you know i think we maybe took that part of it as a nation for granted too much i think that 

299.76 304.77 A: um it's kinda like when you have a catastrophic illness and you get close to to dying 

304.35 305.31 B: mhm 

304.93 307.31 A: you know it'll either have a completely changed 

307.41 319.93 A: lasting effect on your life or it'll be like oh ho hum you know [laughter] and i think everybody chooses to respond to that in a different way you know um you know and i think it's you know when it's kinda like 

310.84 313.24 B: [laughter] 

319.94 327.77 A: when it's the message is ready for you to get it you know the lesson or whatever otherwise you get it again and unfortunately i think that's what's going to happen here 

322.89 325.29 B: right right 

327.62 331.63 B: that it's gonna be well i guess i think you have to be open to it 

328.83 329.87 A: yeah 

331.23 332.36 A: yeah 

331.75 336.87 B: to like i say what's kind of and i think probably it's probably what's going on in a person's life 

336.44 337.56 A: yeah 

337.00 349.76 B: and probably age like you pointed out you know like i'm forty four right now and i think you know as you're older you start looking kind of and evaluating your life a little bit more 

339.91 340.78 A: yeah 

348.24 349.09 A: mhm 

349.82 352.31 B: whereas i think when you're a little younger 

352.57 358.07 B: you're kinda like living here and now and now and not necessarily looking at those types of things 

357.46 358.54 A: mhm 

358.69 360.47 B: and to make changes 

361.01 365.47 B: in your life and your in what you're doing and [laughter] everything else so 

363.41 364.42 A: mhm 

365.15 366.50 A: yeah 

368.08 373.88 A: did it did it impact people in your family in your community in a way where you saw lasting changes or 

373.64 384.77 B: not really i mean the only thing i was concerned about is that i had a brother who who travels quite a bit and travels to new york and i knew he was out of town but i just didn't know where 

384.31 385.31 A: mhm 

385.09 389.35 B: and he actually well he happened to be on an airplane that day 

388.77 390.41 A: oh my jesus mercy 

389.98 393.17 B: and um flew in to florida 

393.54 396.30 B: and i asked him i said well 

396.60 406.69 B: you know what what was that like because they were i think still in the air when all this was kinda going on and he said he said he landed and he said the one thing he noticed 

402.50 403.38 A: (( uh-huh )) 

406.82 407.77 B: um 

407.91 422.08 B: was that there was somebody with like a machine gun at the airport and he really didn't think too much about it he thought well maybe something's going on locally and then of course he found out you know later on what what happened and everything 

411.74 412.79 A: mhm 

416.90 418.30 A: mhm 

419.26 421.08 A: mhm 

422.40 437.05 B: but you know that was kinda weird it was just kinda like you know and that was kind of scary because i was trying to get a hold of my sister in law and to find out what you know during that whole day 'cause you know the telephone circuits were just so busy that day and trying to get through to people and then i was trying to get through to my sister in law and she 

432.35 433.56 A: oh yeah 

437.72 445.40 B: was actually at a doctor's appointment and so it was just kinda like this whole stressful day of just making sure that you know he was okay and 

445.45 457.26 B: and thankfully he was and wasn't really anywhere near you know anything that had happened but it was enough to kind of put some stress in you know and just be worried and like you said to kind of reassess and 

458.43 466.67 B: you know take a look at those family relationships i feel like i've made more of an effort to be closer to my family in that regard 

464.92 465.96 A: mhm 

467.05 468.69 B: but i mean as far as 

469.11 472.04 B: long lasting change per se no 

471.76 473.11 A: mhm 

474.30 475.11 B: so 

476.13 480.39 B: i'm just listening to what [laughter] i have some children over here today and what they're doing 

480.81 481.96 B: but um 

482.01 489.67 A: well the kids know how to take everything in in stages [laughter] if we all had their resilience your life would be different 

485.39 487.13 B: [laughter] 

489.34 496.76 B: yeah well that's one of the things you know my husband and i are trying to explain september eleventh my my oldest has just turned six 

496.37 498.22 A: oh my yeah 

497.42 512.15 B: and so trying to put into perspective as far as all the changes and just you know because there's been heightened security we have a dobbins air force base is here and so there's been some heightened um security and changes in what they've done 

506.75 507.76 A: mhm 

512.15 517.48 B: and just trying to you know explain what happened in september eleventh to him 

517.83 524.63 B: um you know is just kinda on their terms and level that they can understand without also scaring them 

525.01 530.31 B: you know as well as being kind of an interesting experience and he's kinda taken it as 

530.69 538.42 B: you know there were bad men who who flew an airplane in to a building and kind of that's how he's kinda processed that whole thing 

534.50 535.45 A: mhm 

537.98 538.94 A: (( mm )) 

539.35 540.94 A: well he's right 

540.25 546.38 B: yeah yeah and i think you know i guess in some respects i'm thankful in that 

541.02 542.12 A: yeah 

546.76 547.53 B: it 

547.77 553.19 B: it hasn't affected his day to day life it's not something that he's thinking about worrying about and that type of thing 

553.41 554.40 A: mhm 

556.20 557.01 B: so 

556.31 559.17 A: it's got to be harder for kids to even comprehend 

558.19 559.95 B: [noise] 

559.74 561.54 A: all that kind of stuff 

560.52 561.67 B: [noise] 

562.72 563.84 B: i'm sorry 

566.41 567.82 B: i'm sorry what did you say 

567.41 570.19 A: i said it's got to be very difficult for children 

570.46 572.09 A: to comprehend 

572.20 581.60 A: any anything like that because i know for me one of the things that my concern was that week was that when children kept seeing it over and over and over again was 

579.92 581.22 B: mhm 

581.93 585.00 A: did they think it was happening over and over and over again 

584.77 594.24 B: right well and then also you know the fear of you know could that happen to me or be you know could i you know or the fear of you know if i got on an airplane 

594.17 595.98 A: yeah is that gonna happen 

595.14 597.41 B: could that happen type thing and 

598.01 599.89 B: you know i think well my children
