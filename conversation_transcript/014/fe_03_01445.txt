15.34 27.04 A: they just said okay now's the end of ten minutes and noone answered so i guess it's the topic is what changes we've made in our lives since the terrorist attacks of nine eleven i guess we're supposed to discuss and debate that 

27.25 33.35 B: interestingly enough let me introduce myself i'm a student at the university of texas i'm twenty years old 

33.42 37.66 A: and i'm a stay at home mom and i'm thirty four years old [laughter] 

37.02 41.65 B: where did you find out about this like wallet dot com out of curiosity

44.49 48.04 B: on the on the internet yeah like me 

46.29 48.99 A: yeah yeah yeah [laughter] 

48.27 51.50 B: [noise] same thing we got a little spare time you always look for something that's free 

51.50 56.11 A: right well has has this affected you in any way like what 

56.38 62.44 A: do you fly i guess as a student you didn't fly that much before i guess you can't really afford it can you or 

61.74 69.87 B: well actually i fly a lot since my dad's in the oil business i tend to fly i used to fly with them i like to go overseas a lot for my spring break so 

68.24 69.39 A: wow 

69.77 72.55 A: well has that made you more nervous i mean 

71.63 85.76 B: oh well yeah well not rea- honestly it hasn't made much of a difference since i have terrible fear of flying before since i almost died in an airplane incident [noise] it's like regardless i'm always scared so i usually just pass out drunk on an airplane 

80.35 81.23 A: [laughter] 

85.33 96.56 A: [laughter] what are you scared about you said your father's in the oil business so i mean i suppose he's in a lot of countries where there are terrorists i assume if you're flying overseas a lot so 

94.08 95.11 B: yeah 

96.78 98.25 A: has that made you 

98.09 99.44 B: yeah i feel nervous 

98.42 103.13 A: more apprehensive about him and his safety since everything started or 

102.85 109.82 B: yeah truthfully i do feel somewhat worried for my father 'cause he's in all these crappy countries that no noone wants to go to 

109.55 111.02 A: right right 

110.23 111.46 B: obviously 

111.83 117.55 A: and of course the benefit is you get to go to all these crappy countries [laughter] where noone wants 

116.14 118.71 B: yeah i guess [laughter] 

117.64 118.82 A: (( to go )) 

119.07 127.36 B: you get to travel i get a lot of frequent flyer miles off it the the the best thing is our university what we have we have like color alerts 

122.11 123.41 A: oh that's nice 

127.00 128.13 A: mhm 

127.49 133.67 B: so they post the color alert it's like yellow color alert terrorist attack level is medium it sounds like you're at the beach 

133.64 134.94 A: [laughter] 

134.27 148.05 B: and then then they all have all these stupid requirements about they try to make it more secure like they have one security guard standing in front of like the university of texas is the largest university in america like they have one or two security guards yeah that's gonna help 

144.30 145.15 A: right 

147.47 152.98 A: [laughter] well has anything happened at the campuses or anything or 

152.59 157.50 B: not that i know of i honestly don't think anyone would attack austin 'cause it's 

156.88 161.68 A: i i'm i'm in north carolina and i honestly just feel [mn] 

161.53 173.60 A: my mom came down here to visit and she's from canada and i honestly just kinda feel that she's like well you know she heard about all the alerts especially she came down i think it was last [noise] memorial day weekend i think it was and 

173.67 178.55 A: you know they went to like orange alert at that particular time they said that all the 

178.72 187.37 A: - or maybe it was july fourth whatever it was there's lots of travel and they said up and down the east coast that you should be extra careful and my mom started freaking out and she was like 

187.23 195.92 A: i don't know how you can live down here i just don't and i'm like you know [noise] if i lived in new york or i lived in california where i feel might be larger 

188.95 190.31 B: [laughter] 

196.27 198.53 A: you know sources of attacks 

198.16 199.45 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

198.52 212.92 A: i might be a bit more nervous but you know i said i just can't see north carolina being a huge target you know they're sitting over there where shall we attack next oh north carolina oh yes that is that is the heart of the america 

212.83 217.39 A: you know i i just can't see it [laughter] it's now now 

216.02 219.86 B: they might i think they just go to the beach or something [laughter] 

218.55 225.86 A: [laughter] now with the way they they've done stuff honestly my husband and i laugh because 

225.69 236.31 A: [sigh] it makes no sense when you send like anthrax to like tom brokaw oh okay it wouldn't be good if tom brokaw died i wouldn't be happy or dancing around or anything but 

236.34 239.67 A: honestly the way they do stuff [noise] 

239.69 248.54 A: it would frighten me more if they showed that they really understood america like if they attacked disney with all the families there and children there and everything it would 

247.77 249.45 B: yeah 

248.48 259.32 A: it would really hit hard i think [noise] but [mn] they just show they don't really know a lot about the culture [mn] and what i think this has scared americans but i don't think it's scared it as much as 

259.64 263.26 A: if they'd really had a lot of knowledge about where to hit and what to do 

263.07 267.36 B: yeah i agree with you the best thing is i was reading newsweek 

263.71 264.74 A: so 

267.41 278.10 B: newsweek and they were talking about all of these psi ops warfare america's using and they're like the do all this research on arab culture so they what they what they did it's really funny if you haven't do you get newsweek 

277.35 285.84 A: i used to when i was in high school i used to read it regularly but when you get older and you get a family you'll understand that with a two and a three year old 

285.91 294.61 A: i don't even get time to read in the bathroom anymore [laughter] i don't so unfortunately i wish i did i really do but um what did it say what 

293.83 306.22 B: it's funny though they're talking about they're using psi ops warfare which means like they have people holed up so they do they have loud speakers and they blare out insults against them like calling them impotent and stuff and they get so pissed off they just run at the tanks 

306.05 307.53 A: [laughter] 

306.89 309.06 B: [laughter] they get blown up [laughter] 

308.29 310.12 A: [laughter] 

309.78 320.25 B: because apparently it's like a big insult to be to insult your manhood it's like the grave- the gravest thing you can do to insult them they get so pissed off they just run at them that's how they get people out of the bunkers [laughter] 

316.41 317.49 A: wow 

319.59 321.12 A: wow that's 

322.22 328.33 A: thats at least it shows they're doing research and they know what to do in order to take the enemy out but wow that's 

328.14 329.43 B: it's pretty funny 

328.53 331.30 A: that's pretty amazing yeah yeah 

329.95 334.31 B: they've they've improved on like with their methods i guess 

334.09 335.69 A: right right 

334.71 340.81 B: though i can't say i like bush very much he doesn't seem to know what he's doing half the time 

340.48 343.62 A: i totally agree with you there i 

343.67 352.30 A: didn't vote for him and [mn] i know it's very anti american to say stuff right now about him but i'm sorry it's a free country and i just 

352.11 353.34 B: that's right 

352.80 361.87 A: [mn] [sigh] i don't feel we went over for the right reasons i don't feel like it's fully disclosed why we went over and and i honestly 

359.10 360.49 B: yeah 

361.69 369.13 A: if he was really doing it to free the people then now he'd be going you know one of the biggest abusers of people is china 

369.51 381.33 A: you know i mean just think of tiananmen square and everything else that that has happened and and as far as people's rights and and people having no rights and their civil rights being violated 

381.44 389.93 A: you know china is pretty big on the list of violators and you know we're not going over because they can defend themselves 

389.35 390.59 B: (( yeah )) 

390.02 391.26 A: (( no i )) 

390.79 392.17 B: (( [laughter] it's true )) 

391.70 393.65 A: i truly believe that that 

393.78 400.14 A: you know that if he were really against you know [mn] he's picking on people that cannot defend themselves [noise] 

400.50 401.56 A: you know 

401.63 406.08 A: iraq cannot defend themselves and and you know 

406.81 407.74 A: i mean 

408.13 409.92 A: korea started up 

409.93 412.57 A: the nuclear reactor you 

410.06 413.84 B: korea's the fun- yeah that that's the funniest thing 

413.43 421.56 A: haven't seen us go after them but you've heard us talk a lot about syria now you know i mean we only go after people who are easy targets 

418.47 419.34 B: (( [mn] )) 

421.80 423.27 A: so anyway 

422.38 427.11 B: i think he had a personal vendetta versus iraq because they tried to assassinate his dad [laughter] 

426.21 429.55 A: right right which isn't right you don't use the office 

429.68 440.65 A: that's anti american to use the office and to use so many people who are just so naive that go oh america america and he's using all these sheep that just fall in line 

438.99 439.90 B: yeah 

440.98 447.92 A: [noise] and it's just that's just as anti american to me as you can get it's just to use all these people because you know they're gullible 

448.10 449.07 A: [noise] you know 

448.18 455.16 B: right and then like they have these i don't know if the survey's true they say like that people think that iraq is responsible for terror- all these terrorists attack 

454.85 461.15 A: they have not been able to conclusively prove anything they've had to dance around it every time it's brought up they've had to dance around it 

459.63 466.95 B: well we all know iraq's a bastard country but it's not it had nothing to do it didn't really care about america 

463.09 463.94 A: right 

466.42 467.36 A: right 

467.30 471.17 B: it was having there sitting drinking its french wine and enjoying life 

470.94 484.06 A: to me it doesn't matter if they find weapons of mass destruction that really doesn't matter to me because quite honestly the thing i've always said is i don't care if they have weapons of mass destruction prove that they are an immediate threat you're saying they're a threat 

483.96 486.67 A: prove that they are an immediate threat to us 

486.85 494.93 A: only then if they uncover so plan and they go oh we knew about this all along there's a plan to take out america [mn] then that's one thing but [noise] 

495.10 496.11 A: are you there 

495.69 496.68 B: (( yep )) 

497.70 498.54 B: (( hello )) 

498.21 512.57 A: oh okay [laughter] i thought i heard the phone click [mn] but anyway to me it's just the thing about you know prove that they were a threat to us don't don't prove anything else i don't care about weapons or anything prove that they were actually a threat to us 

498.91 499.77 B: yeah 

506.60 507.66 B: yeah 

512.64 517.09 A: [lipsmack] so that's just me and my little opinion [laughter] 

512.90 513.91 B: (( that's true )) 

516.49 526.16 B: i i think a lot of people think like that so that i'm in texas supposed to be all pro bush the majority of people in my city we're like no no bush is a moron and he doesn't represent this state 

525.33 529.84 A: really 'cause after this whole natalie maynes thing you know 

528.86 531.26 B: oh those are the hicks in texas 

530.80 532.79 A: [laughter] 

531.34 532.25 B: and 

532.34 536.27 B: there's plenty of hicks but like within the major cities houston you have austin 

536.04 536.96 A: right 

536.48 546.48 B: we're we're we're all like who who cares about bush is a moron you know he's like he's a draft dodger he's a cocaine addict and alcoholics 

546.21 547.12 A: right 

546.79 550.35 B: he's he's he's and then he's like he's very double sided 

550.47 562.14 A: well it's nice to know that some people actually like think for themselves in texas not to insult texans i really don't but i mean the way they're portrayed in the media it's like everyone's just like oh bush bush bush 

561.12 571.94 B: no if you every look at the election results not that many even though te- bush won texas he didn't win by an overwhelming majority in my opinion there's a good percentage of people that don't like bush 

571.42 574.40 A: excuse me no i didn't call okay sorry 

574.58 579.32 A: the life of a housewife um [laughter] oh i'm glad [noise] oh 

577.16 578.95 B: (( [laughter] )) 

579.26 580.06 B: oh 

579.84 583.70 A: (( honey the fax machine the kids have played with the fax machine )) 

583.18 586.60 B: [laughter] 

585.11 588.69 A: i'm sorry we have call waiting and there's no way to turn it off once it starts 

588.54 589.68 B: that's okay
