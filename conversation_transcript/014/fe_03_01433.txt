138.35 151.90 A: and they found [laughter] out that it was somebody's husband waiting for her for her tests to be over [laughter] but be normally i wouldn't of looked at that twice i would've assumed that right away that oh he must be waiting for his wife [mn] or whoever you know

183.22 184.31 A: al qaida 

183.87 195.27 B: yeah al qaida or or wha- how do they feel about it you know the war on iraq you know you it it just it makes you pay attention and you don't mean to be um 

185.18 186.19 A: mhm 

195.47 197.24 B: uh how can i say it 

197.14 198.17 A: prejudiced 

198.07 208.98 B: prejudiced thank you [laughter] you don't mean to be prejudiced against anyone at least i don't and uh but it just makes you you know pay attention but 

199.97 201.18 A: [laughter] 

203.88 204.84 A: mhm 

209.56 212.48 B: you're careful not to mistreat anyone though 

212.14 213.68 A: right right 

212.75 217.25 B: but uh it's just i i mean i guess it just changed your whole way of thinking 

217.19 226.22 A: it does it does we in fact down the block here we have a gas station that was closed down for about five months because they found and the guy who ran the gas station he was uh 

226.01 232.83 A: uh a a dark kind of i don't know wha- what is that i don't know like iraqi wha- what you see the iraqis look like he's like that 

232.44 233.52 B: yeah 

232.78 243.55 A: but i went there anyway because i figured well you know that i can't be prejudiced against all these people you know well they closed down the gas station 'cause they found out that that gas station was supplying money to al qaida 

237.37 238.49 B: yeah 

243.23 245.11 B: oh my goodness 

243.91 258.27 A: yeah now it it's been opened up after the five months but i haven't gone back yet because now i'm like wow they were supplying the people who we're fighting against and now sh- you know i'm not rushing to go back to that station you know [mn] because now i feel 

258.30 271.99 A: i feel that they that gas station did wrong i mean i guess they were they were uh found not guilty or they paid their fines or whatever but still they th- they were found that they did something wrong like that and when you have these young people dying over there 

264.92 266.19 B: mhm 

271.59 272.61 B: yeah 

271.93 277.77 A: you know and being held prisoner and everything now of course you're going to you know feel negative towards those type of people 

277.59 285.42 B: yeah yeah it it really does make you it change your whole way of thinking things that you wouldn't of uh paid any attention 

285.45 290.83 B: before you know you just you know you just figure that they they were americans or 

290.85 300.99 B: or in this country i mean we have such a vast mixture of people you know in this country that you just didn't you pay it no attention but now 

295.55 296.40 A: (( mm )) 

301.02 303.09 B: it's just totally um 

303.17 304.92 B: uh different 

304.66 312.18 A: yeah yeah it it's really made you i think it's made us probably also look at our lives in general and say okay now 

312.26 316.94 A: do do is our life going in the right direction that we've always wanted it to be 

316.97 323.25 A: because you know any minute since now you it's made more uh you realize more that it can be taken away from you 

323.17 332.77 A: so am i going the right way is there something i want to change here do i want to reach more out to other people um you know you know what i'm saying 

332.51 333.72 B: yeah 

332.88 344.34 A: should your life be made more worthwhile now since i i think like i was taking it for granted this is life hey everything is you know the way it should be and then when everything got turned upside down 

344.41 349.77 A: i it it kind of mixed things up and i'm saying now wait a minute is this the order i want to put them back in it again 

349.98 351.46 A: right you know what i mean 

350.91 353.45 B: mhm right right right 

352.88 363.08 A: mm um i don't know i i've just i've al- you know what i found myself doing too which is [laughter] i don't know i i i must've really been affected by this just been pulling out the all the albums 

363.05 370.38 A: you know from from like when my children were babies you know and just looking through that oh look at you know just like appreciating everything more 

371.08 375.93 B: yeah and i and i know i've i've taken uh uh trips and uh 

375.96 388.65 B: and having encouraged my family members you know to come on up here and see me you never know what's going to happen [laughter] so you tend to want to you know be in touch with every everyone and see them and try to be nice to them and 

379.89 380.76 A: mhm 

380.97 382.53 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

388.49 393.32 B: you know yeah yeah it has it has definitely um 

393.45 406.50 B: uh changed it because you don't know from one minute what's going to happen 'cause we we never experienced anything like that i mean that was that was something that we we never expected to happen to us 

400.49 401.96 A: mm oh no 

406.06 407.20 A: i know 

406.58 409.13 B: to be attacked on our own land 

408.68 417.05 A: no we were we took it for granted they they can't come here you know and then it turns out that they were training at our own flight schools in florida 

409.77 411.21 B: mhm 

411.77 412.67 B: no 

415.51 418.30 B: mhm [laughter] 

416.98 424.07 A: you know 'cause we're just so nice and so my two kids are teenagers and when they see things on t._v. or whatever that's related to this they go 

418.90 419.85 B: yeah 

424.09 438.79 A: they go nobody else should be allowed in this country they said that we're letting in too many people we're too nice you know we let these people in and look what they do they use our stuff and then turn it around against us you know and i don't know how to answer that because that's what happened 

438.23 450.87 B: i know yeah i think it's a complex sit- situation because the government has so much to do with that in that they're setting up these programs and things and dealing with the uh heads of state um 

451.11 457.78 B: of the other countries and that's why it's some of those people get into this country very easily 

457.46 458.84 A: (( mm mm )) 

457.78 468.46 B: because our government has so many backhanded programs and things set up with with those people uh and some of them get better better treatment than the people that's born here 

468.14 479.78 A: i know right right yeah it's it's uh it's all politics all politically connected and what what works out best for uh i don't know these people uh in the higher ups you know 

468.99 472.27 B: you know [laughter] 

472.74 474.19 B: mhm 

474.64 475.74 B: mhm 

479.69 480.72 B: yeah

485.32 486.70 B: oh really 

486.08 491.17 A: and uh you know and i was i was just used my dad used to work in one of the towers 

491.30 495.50 A: and we went we went and dined on uh at windows on the world 

495.36 509.07 A: i mean well i shouldn't say dined we had appetizers 'cause that's all we could afford [laughter] you know that's an expensive place you know so the two of us went up there and and you know we we ate up there and i remember taking my kids up there you know to see the view from up there 

500.43 502.07 B: yeah yeah 

509.03 512.99 A: and but we never went much because oh we can always go again

523.81 524.91 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

524.31 527.18 A: it was just like i just couldn't believe it and then 

527.26 538.46 A: you you pick up conversation along the street people talking about it and every everybody is just you know talking about people they knew who died people they knew who who just made it out the lady who lives across the street from me
