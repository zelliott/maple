17.75 24.10 A: yeah i for me i i haven't changed my life i have lived my life like i w- i usually do 

24.53 29.76 A: you know you for me it's like i cannot live my life scared of everything 

25.56 26.77 B: mhm 

29.96 32.96 A: because of what happened i can't do that 

31.91 32.79 B: yeah 

33.68 34.56 A: (( you know )) 

34.69 39.97 B: yeah um i can't say that i've changed much either and 

40.40 42.17 B: [sigh] i think 

42.63 46.44 B: [cough] my my life is the same basically because 

46.67 48.18 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

49.12 56.51 B: i don't know i don't i don't i'm not involved in a lot of things that where terrorists would be like i don't do a lot of flying and i 

56.64 59.06 B: i i don't know maybe that's the reason why 

58.90 69.63 A: yeah it's the same thing here you know it's like i always you know in my life i was b- uh careful and always to pay attention to things when i'm out there 

59.72 60.64 B: (( uh )) 

68.61 70.40 B: mhm mhm 

69.73 72.80 A: so i don't think i need to be more 

72.92 76.66 A: you know aware of anything cautious you know 

73.89 74.95 B: (( cautious )) 

76.18 77.86 B: yeah yeah 

76.70 85.93 A: 'cause i actually it would be too much i will spend more time doing that than fun things and you know just things to do with my kids i you know 

82.01 83.09 B: right 

85.85 91.86 A: i think they notice that i'm not that way so they don't they're not scared of doing things 

91.51 92.60 B: mhm 

92.22 102.40 A: yeah so it's it's good you know on that part so my kids are not scared to go out there because they're worried that you know somebody is gonna attack the united state or anything they 

95.29 96.18 B: yeah 

102.35 103.35 B: right 

102.52 103.72 A: (( they are the same )) 

104.51 108.61 A: i haven't changed anything it's true i'm like you i i don't travel that much 

108.94 111.49 A: so i don't have to worry too much about that 

108.95 110.10 B: yeah 

112.06 113.31 A: when it comes to 

112.28 115.18 B: and i'm not sure that [sigh] 

116.04 117.03 B: well 

117.62 118.72 A: it [cough] [cough] 

118.10 122.02 B: i can't even say that i pay a whole lotta attention 

122.25 128.20 B: to any i i really don't i i can't maybe i'm in a lull or something but 

128.39 129.43 B: um 

129.54 133.04 B: i've always believed that united states 

133.36 135.46 B: uh took a position 

135.60 137.27 B: (( of um )) 

138.33 140.35 B: pride shall we say or 

141.37 149.97 B: or they just never educated their people into knowing that these things could happen since nothing ever happened over here on their soil and uh 

150.14 160.52 B: so i guess i just had that cocky confidence it was like the united states had a cocky confidence and even after september eleventh i think that th- the thing that it did the most for me was 

160.51 171.72 B: open my eyes up to things that happen around the world that people deal with every day you know i i don't deal with it here but others and other in in other countries people deal with this type of stuff every day 

163.36 164.17 A: (( yeah )) 

165.03 165.97 A: yeah 

171.46 172.68 A: yeah i 

171.80 172.83 B: (( um )) 

172.75 180.28 A: i i am now am american citizen but i i was born in panama and i wa- and i was there with the things with noriega 

176.92 177.95 B: mhm 

180.35 181.33 B: mhm 

180.63 187.76 A: so i i was careful you know over there and th- the you know and always watching at things and i think it does carry over t- 

187.77 196.32 A: when i came over here seventeen years ago you know and then i i'm always careful of what i'm doing so like and and now always you know and 

189.09 189.99 B: yeah 

190.50 191.42 B: (( mhm )) 

196.35 205.99 A: what me some time is that when i was in panama the news will say like something's happened and we my husband is an american we were over there and we were like where 

201.64 202.58 B: (( mhm )) 

206.11 207.65 B: oh yeah 

206.28 211.70 A: i i was there but we i didn't saw anything so i'm wary sometimes when i see the news 

209.29 210.24 B: uh-huh 

211.54 212.53 B: uh-huh 

211.73 216.91 A: just the things they put out there and and i think they make it bigger than what it was 

216.84 219.01 B: yeah and i i i don't 

217.02 217.80 A: so 

219.27 230.56 B: trust the news too much because i don't trust that they tell us exactly what is happening i think they only tell us what they want us to know and [mn] news 

224.62 225.43 A: yeah 

230.75 237.17 B: uh stations are notorious for wanting to be the first to get the news out there no matter how 

237.22 247.94 B: you know unfounded it is or or you know they just wanna be the first to tell you something about it and then they'll worry about cleaning it up later like oh we said this but we meant this 

240.46 241.43 A: yeah 

247.60 248.88 A: (( yeah just )) 

247.89 252.65 B: but as long as they can be the first one to get it out there but you can't really trust them 

250.10 252.21 A: yes because you can wa- 

252.44 258.73 A: because you can watch one channel they say any something and then you watch the next channel and they're talking about the same thing but it's changed 

258.43 259.48 B: yeah 

258.90 268.95 A: and then you you change one other channel it's totally different so it's like what is it it's like where the girl one of the p._o._w.s that they found the girl they said that she w- had been shot 

263.16 263.77 B: (( [laughter] )) 

268.85 269.77 B: uh-huh 

269.44 271.89 A: and then they said she was not shot 

271.79 272.93 B: mhm 

272.34 280.90 A: and then a- and so i told my husband so what is it is she shot or not or you know i don't know it [laughter] it's like 

277.35 278.40 B: [laughter] 

278.43 279.68 B: [laughter] 

279.97 282.70 B: you don't know what to believe so 

281.53 283.61 A: you yeah so it's like geez [mn] 

283.54 288.32 B: uh you know i'm sorry to say maybe i'm just being um 

288.61 297.43 B: i've never been a overly cautious person i am aware of my surroundings somewhat when i go out like whether somebody's following me or something but 

297.47 303.74 B: uh as far as terrorism and how i feel about watching for these things 

304.38 308.17 B: i i can't say that i watch for them you know um 

308.97 310.03 A: you know it 

309.22 313.06 B: i can't say that i do anything different uh as 

311.40 319.45 A: yeah me neither 'cause i i feel like you know why i'm gonna be start looking at people and uh and saying well you're from there so i guess you may be 

318.00 319.00 B: yeah 

319.23 327.70 A: i'm like you know you don't know you don't know who will be the person that come after you and i think that it's when it's your time to go it's your time to go 

320.39 321.24 B: yeah 

324.10 325.10 B: right 

327.61 328.66 B: yeah 

327.68 335.89 A: it doesn't matter you know so just live your life as it is uh as full as you can right now and instead of just watching t._v. and then 

332.37 333.30 B: yeah 

335.91 336.90 A: kinda 

336.89 346.62 A: okay today i'm gonna do this because it seems like you know it's like when they have these like high alerts over the united states you know over here in washington they're like wow 

339.20 340.57 B: mhm 

344.26 345.21 B: yeah 

346.44 353.59 A: they have you know you can't go to the station you know because they're gonna do they may do this i'm like come on i cannot just you know 

346.59 347.54 B: yeah 

353.99 364.70 B: yeah and i i think that that is about the only thing that you know unfortunately i hear you say that i think that's about the only thing that i have changed is raising a eyebrow 

354.67 355.45 A: not 

364.57 375.13 B: at uh those that look like they might be from that uh um country uh like this i hope that's nobody buzzing in my um 

374.14 375.09 A: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

375.49 384.97 B: uh but that's about the only thing that it has done is raise that eyebrow and i don't like that so uh because i don't want to prejudge people because i have friends 

385.11 395.79 B: that are from diff- that are from different countries and so forth and and i've worked with uh international students a long time and you know i just i just just don't think that 

396.39 409.64 B: [sigh] you should look at everybody just because they're not white oh well that must be uh uh they're they're a suspect you know or just br- just because they look like they're from there oh they're a suspect you know and 

401.40 402.19 A: yeah 

404.11 405.01 A: yeah 

408.02 409.71 A: yeah yes 

409.63 418.79 B: y- you don't know you know it's too it's too broad of a it's too broad of a thing to do so i think basically what we've done is just that you 

409.94 410.63 A: (( but yeah )) 

418.75 431.21 B: know we're just not gonna go thinking that way you know we're just gonna continue to live our lives as we've been now again being that i don't do a lot of traveling and things like that i don't have that type of alert 

424.53 425.55 A: (( well yeah yes )) 

431.19 437.10 B: uh maybe that some travelers would have but as an everyday average you know person 

437.32 438.39 B: you know i 

438.43 448.19 B: just treat people the same way i've always treated them unless i see something unless they come at me with something then okay that may raise an eyebrow but you know 

446.34 447.26 A: yeah 

447.97 452.02 A: yeah i think for me it's like if i go places i always you know aware of 

451.87 465.02 A: of my surroundings and and if i see somebody that's acting weird i don't care what color you are you're acting weird i'm away from you as far as i can [laughter] you know i don't care if you know you may look good um have a nice suit but you acting weird to me

512.82 513.81 A: (( geez i don't )) 

513.07 517.97 B: yeah so i don't know again what have i changed 

517.85 531.27 B: i can't say that i've changed much but i i i i have to repeat that i i'm just an average person i just get up and go to work every day and the most that i see of it uh is on the news you know if they're saying 

531.10 537.06 B: uh you need to watch out for this or we're at high alert now and the dah dah dah dah dah i might 

536.96 548.00 B: uh take a look and see if i see something out of the ordinary that's when i'm looking for something out of the ordinary maybe a car somewhere that looks weird or something i don't know but 

540.36 541.19 A: yeah 

547.94 561.84 B: um i haven't changed anything you know i i just haven't you know i i'm just more appreciative of life more appreciative of my family um i i don't take small things uh for granted you know um 

561.84 566.06 B: i don't look at tomorrow as being promised to me because anything could happen 

566.15 570.11 B: and so you know that's the way you have to live otherwise you'll just live in fear 

569.79 571.16 A: yeah that's 

570.41 581.29 B: all the time and uh i wonder if they're gonna do it here i wonder if they're gonna blow up this or i can't go over here because that's probably a target and i just don't think like that i'm just you know [laughter] 

571.20 572.72 A: that's the way they're doing 

579.21 579.95 A: no 

580.18 581.23 A: that i 

581.24 587.50 A: yeah for me about this time that's too much waste of time and to trying to worry about where you're gonna go right now 

587.24 588.97 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

587.68 599.84 A: you know and it's it's it's sad that these things are happen in this time and the sad is from people are going to the extreme they're just you know making themselves so worried about everything around but 

594.73 595.73 B: mhm 

599.21 599.95 B: yeah
