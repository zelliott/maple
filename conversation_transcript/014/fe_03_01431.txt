149.82 150.63 B: (( mm ))

154.24 155.28 B: right 

156.02 161.97 B: right right and there's and and that definit- that's a change and that's th- that's a change for the best also 

161.03 166.56 A: well yes that that is one of the changes that i have made that's true 

164.70 166.99 B: mhm 

166.63 171.65 A: and um of course i do look upon 

171.72 176.19 A: um what's happening in the rest of the world though and 

176.01 177.85 B: yeah 

176.22 177.30 A: (( uh )) 

177.48 182.40 A: and and how they are handing 

182.46 186.59 A: you know in africa and in the middle east 

185.93 187.99 B: mhm 

186.51 198.61 A: the little children and well the adults too are without uh water they're without uh any sort of um health 

197.99 201.92 B: (( right mhm well do you know )) 

198.49 202.91 A: care or anything like that and i do think about that now 

202.19 213.96 B: well yeah yeah you we we we have to now and it seems like the more we look on on t._v. now we se- we it makes us care more about others beside ourselves 

212.62 215.36 A: (( yes yes that's true )) 

214.11 220.89 B: uh and and then it like it's as far as food i just to find myself like throwing food away 

220.53 221.61 A: yes 

220.98 224.33 B: you know and then i think of others who don't even have it to eat 

222.37 223.52 A: i know 

223.91 229.96 A: i know i know this is true we we've all uh been along that uh 

230.03 232.06 A: uh road we've uh 

232.18 237.10 A: we throw things out uh we buy more than we need and 

236.31 239.65 B: (( right )) 

237.38 247.57 A: and uh we don't think we don't think in terms of of how other people have suffered and i i think that uh 

244.38 250.84 B: (( mhm )) 

247.94 253.21 A: that even the war has uh changed me in some respects because 

251.78 253.58 B: oh yeah uh-huh 

253.28 254.98 A: (( um [mn] )) 

255.15 258.02 A: i wasn't for the war at first but 

257.95 272.63 A: uh i'm hoping that now um we'll be able to go in there and and help these people and uh maybe get them food and and an education and things that they never had before 

264.90 266.80 B: right 

271.99 274.05 B: right 

272.86 279.80 A: but then of course i do worry about people in our country there are so many people in our country that 

279.36 280.74 B: definitely 

279.82 281.88 A: that need it uh 

280.81 288.37 B: mhm yeah th- th- that's my main concern i i believe in helping others but we need to help ourselves first 

287.20 292.44 A: yes this is true i i don't think that people realize how many 

292.60 296.15 A: uh children go to bed hungry in this country 

294.89 296.52 B: right 

296.16 299.06 A: and i think that the more you think about it 

299.21 303.14 A: uh the more you realize that that you need to help 

303.98 308.05 A: to help us uh in this country uh 

305.04 309.20 B: right mhm 

308.27 309.93 A: help them uh 

310.20 312.40 A: get to school and so forth 

311.72 313.47 B: right uh-huh 

313.33 318.12 A: yes i i have changed uh since nine eleven 

318.25 321.98 A: and and i hope that uh i'll continue to 

321.68 328.79 B: oh yeah mhm i i have an an and i can see that it definitely was for the best 

322.47 324.19 A: to change more 

328.33 329.59 A: yes 

329.04 333.94 B: and uh i mean i've you know i mean i've always been a caring person but i've 

333.65 334.69 A: yes 

334.05 338.16 B: i try to care more than others than myself 

334.92 335.83 A: (( yes )) 

336.15 341.65 A: but but now it's it's really uh you you've really uh 

341.71 342.98 A: (( been )) 

343.17 354.39 A: been awakened so to speak more uh even though you did care in the past and and i have uh cared in the past too but um 

348.47 352.09 B: mhm 

354.46 367.52 A: i just never realized until nine eleven that people could uh feel so strongly a- against other people that they would be willing to sacrifice 

368.30 371.19 A: themselves and other people to 

371.23 372.82 A: to take down 

373.01 374.92 A: the united states 

373.15 378.21 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

375.96 378.31 A: and that and we 

378.54 380.12 A: we need to 

380.58 382.88 A: maybe show others that 

381.24 384.47 B: (( yeah )) 

383.22 385.93 A: we are more caring and we 

386.30 387.70 A: and uh 

388.00 390.05 A: and we do think of 

390.10 392.85 A: other people i know they think that we 

392.99 395.00 A: all we care about is 

395.16 397.44 A: oil and [mn] 

397.30 400.89 B: right right right uh-huh 

397.83 400.60 A: and big houses and everything [laughter] 

400.69 404.43 A: but uh that isn't true at all because i think the 

403.07 405.03 B: no that's definitely not true 

404.58 408.20 A: i think the average person uh does 

408.37 410.95 A: think more uh of 

411.12 414.71 A: of other people than than we're given credit for 

414.12 419.06 B: right i i definitely believe i agree with that i definitely agree with that 

418.41 419.51 A: (( uh-huh )) 

419.86 423.40 B: yeah and uh i i i think uh 

423.77 432.45 B: really al- although we still hearing things in uh problems in the school system i think that uh it's gotten better 

428.51 429.56 A: yes 

431.92 444.35 A: yes i think that it has i i think in in durham things have gotten better um i'd been away for a long time and i decided to come back and i'm 

432.50 436.02 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

444.37 456.58 A: happy uh that uh things have gotten better in many ways i live in a a multi racial community and i'm glad that i do uh 

453.24 455.76 B: mhm 

456.61 465.94 A: because of what i believe in and i think that the schools have become more multi rational racial and uh 

463.44 464.95 B: yeah 

466.06 469.46 A: this is this is what we need to do is to 

469.81 472.79 A: is to have a multi racial 

472.82 474.60 A: society now 

473.65 481.11 B: right i i agree with that because uh uh regardless of how people be thinking 

481.04 490.12 B: they have to realize you know we all serve the same same god we all uh we uh we mhm 

485.04 489.21 A: this is true this is that's very true we all 

489.30 493.61 A: we all do have the same god and he expects us all 

494.27 498.03 A: to uh care for one another 

497.61 499.48 B: right 

498.70 501.07 A: and sometimes we don't 

501.21 502.14 A: but 

502.03 505.03 B: mhm 

502.53 504.29 A: i think that uh 

504.66 508.04 A: this has been a wake up call for us uh in 

508.15 513.99 A: in our country and the and of course i think in the western 

514.15 518.26 A: um countries it's been a wake up call too because 

515.57 518.57 B: (( mhm )) 

518.29 520.60 A: they realize too that uh 

520.75 523.11 A: they they also can 

523.42 525.21 A: can be uh 

525.28 527.33 A: hurt with the terrorists 

526.69 530.36 B: right right yes i do agree with that 

530.72 531.75 A: uh 

532.12 533.81 A: i know that um 

532.98 536.93 B: mhm 

535.08 538.62 A: in some ways uh you are very fortunate though 

538.63 542.62 A: you live in a a large city that has always been 

542.74 544.02 A: um 

543.71 547.85 B: (( mhm )) 

544.45 545.75 A: more 

545.83 549.03 A: uh multi cultural than 

548.09 554.39 B: right mhm mhm 

549.07 556.59 A: than the average uh city and um now uh our area has 

556.65 559.83 A: has gotten like that too 

559.23 560.14 B: (( [noise] )) 

560.03 561.86 A: and um 

561.25 561.95 B: (( [noise] )) 

562.04 563.66 A: i think that uh 

563.94 565.19 A: we need 

565.72 572.86 A: we need to really as you said about the schools uh see that more children 

573.20 580.61 A: uh are able to learn um are able to learn it's not just enough to expect them to go to school 

580.67 581.95 A: they need to 

582.18 587.69 A: need to be taught about all these things that are happening in the world 

584.20 590.79 B: (( mm mhm [noise] )) 

587.78 590.90 A: and um i think they also need to 

591.19 592.22 B: (( uh-huh )) 

591.68 595.32 A: need to learn uh how to get along 

595.06 596.26 B: right 

595.36 598.03 A: with one another and not be fighting 

598.29 599.89 A: uh between
