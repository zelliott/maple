17.37 19.61 A: we really haven't changed anything 

19.20 27.41 B: i haven't either i i would just say i'm wary it isn't like i stocked up on water and i'm waiting for a bomb to hit the house but 

26.41 28.20 A: (( that's the way we are )) 

27.61 28.83 B: i mean 

28.87 31.56 B: yeah i i i wonder 

31.74 37.75 A: yeah you wonder what's going to happen next but i don't really think it's gonna happen here [laughter] 

36.43 41.28 B: well i'm not there's nothing much i can do about it i i mean 

39.59 40.61 A: right 

42.78 53.80 B: what am i gonna do i'm pretty clos- not that far away from three mile island so i i kind of figure if i get hit i get hit [laughter] what am i gonna do go hide in the basement 

46.73 47.59 A: (( ooh )) 

50.32 53.40 A: right oh my gosh there's not 

53.62 63.16 A: yeah there's nothing you can do and the only thing that kinda has affected us is my husband's a nurse and he had to decide whether he wanted to get a smallpox vaccination 

62.56 64.26 B: oh and did he 

64.02 71.43 A: no um he can't get it because our children have eczema so you're not allowed to get it eczema 

68.92 70.73 B: your children have what 

71.05 72.92 B: (( oh oka- oh really )) 

71.74 76.55 A: yeah eczema yeah so you know you worry about that uh 

76.38 81.45 B: i thought that if if so it's even if your children do i thought it was oh 

79.88 80.80 A: right 

81.19 82.14 A: yeah 

81.55 87.33 B: see now i had four smallpox vaccinations when i was a child and none of them ever took 

87.27 88.34 A: really 

87.99 88.87 B: [laughter] 

88.62 89.84 A: wow 

89.34 94.75 B: and so i don't know at the time my doctor said oh you must have some kind of natural immunity 

94.75 95.68 A: (( mm )) 

95.07 99.00 B: and then my doctor now said there is no such thing as a natural immunity 

98.77 99.81 A: well 

99.36 101.29 B: and i said well whatever 

101.35 106.32 B: it's i guess i won't get smallpox [laughter] whatever it is 

104.38 105.19 A: oh 

105.98 116.74 A: my husband's had to have three m. m. r. vaccinations [noise] and none of 'em have taken they'll work for awhile and then his employer will test his immunity and there won't be any immunity to 

116.44 118.00 B: oh that's bizarre 

117.17 119.32 A: yeah isn't it weird i 

118.46 120.55 B: well they've gotta quit giving it to ya 

120.19 124.64 A: i i guess i don't know why that would be with some people uh 

124.74 126.43 A: my friend's little girl 

126.60 135.52 A: just uh she found out she has some kind of genetic immune disorder and all the vaccinations she got as a child don't exist in her system any anymore either 

134.93 135.97 B: uh-oh 

135.53 138.38 A: so maybe it has something to do with that maybe there's something 

138.11 138.96 B: (( ha )) 

138.88 140.27 A: (( i don't know but )) 

139.64 145.21 B: but i don't i guess we should be saying that we wanna travel less and um 

145.19 157.35 A: [noise] mm i don't i don't i did my flying before and we had flown to california and not that i had any plans of flying across country [noise] we have two small kids now but 

158.07 160.27 A: we haven't even considered flying 

160.33 163.71 A: as an option for vacations or anything like that 

162.94 164.69 B: because of nine eleven 

164.04 167.08 A: right right mhm yeah 

164.70 165.80 B: really 

166.64 168.22 B: i don't um 

168.26 173.77 B: the last trip i took we drove but i don't it wasn't because of nine eleven it was just because 

174.40 177.29 B: we had the dog and it was easier i i [laughter] 

176.74 178.33 A: right [laughter] 

177.86 182.85 B: so i don't i i don't think i have any fear of a domestic 

182.64 183.65 A: right 

183.86 186.30 B: um i probably wouldn't be 

186.74 190.99 B: touring europe right now but i don't know if its nine eleven or the war in iraq 

190.56 192.36 A: right right 

191.52 195.42 B: you know i think it's probably more the war in iraq 

194.79 202.52 A: [noise] yeah my i've had a couple of friends go to like england and uh i worried about them but 

195.77 196.56 B: (( [mn] )) 

201.73 204.31 B: yeah they're giving away 

202.56 203.28 A: i 

204.77 205.94 B: airfare 

205.62 206.57 A: right 

205.99 207.64 B: you know i mean it's 

206.97 208.09 A: it's kinda [noise] 

208.24 219.67 A: chances of anything happening are pretty slim but but still [laughter] i just know how my luck runs [laughter] i would be on the airplane when something bad happened so 

212.04 212.95 B: right 

215.84 217.26 B: [laughter] 

219.71 223.09 A: i i don't know that's one thing i guess i have changed that i 

223.22 230.11 A: don't wanna fly for a while i'm i'm not saying i won't ever fly again but uh i just don't want to fly right now 

230.35 237.58 B: i don't know i i'd probably would i don't know that i'd go overseas only because i don't think america is 

235.16 236.18 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

237.85 240.60 B: looked upon so greatly right now 

240.67 252.06 B: in other countries so i'd be leery but that's more the war again not nine eleven and you know i keep thinking about that millennium thing i didn't do anything about that either where 

241.70 242.75 A: right 

245.16 246.14 A: right 

251.71 254.37 A: no i didn't either and nothing happened 

253.17 256.83 B: well that was crazy people that were stocking up on wat- 

255.16 257.17 A: [laughter] 

256.97 258.28 B: [laughter] 

257.45 259.34 A: [laughter] 

258.51 263.10 B: i just thought that was total insanity to be honest with you [laughter] 

261.17 262.83 A: right right 

263.13 264.16 A: well 

263.86 264.59 B: (( you know [noise] )) 

264.33 268.75 A: yeah i don't know i mean i was kind of worried 

268.76 270.94 A: a few weeks after it happened 

271.07 272.17 A: you know 

272.54 277.80 A: different things would worry me you know you thought something else was gonna happen and but 

277.82 278.89 A: now that 

279.20 283.35 A: a couple of years have went by i really don't think about it a whole lot 

282.91 283.48 B: (( [noise] )) 

283.82 288.60 B: yeah i don't either but i i mean it's its affected all of us in 

289.01 291.18 B: probably subconscious 

291.32 292.97 B: ways you know 

292.43 297.80 A: right right i think i view certain people differently i'm sus- more suspicious now 

297.52 298.89 B: this is true 

298.49 300.21 A: right i mean i 

300.28 302.16 B: which is probably not good 

300.44 301.30 A: right 

301.89 307.50 A: or wrong right correct right or wrong i think whenever i'm in public places and 

302.19 303.65 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

307.28 318.80 A: i see that people that could possibly be a terrorist i i think well you know what are they up to you wonder if people are going to start doing suicide bombing and and things like that 

316.58 317.72 B: yeah 

318.23 319.35 B: this is true 

319.36 320.82 A: but that's 

320.92 325.63 A: really there's not where i live there's not a lot of diversity we have a university 

325.48 328.76 B: oh are you by the university of west virginia 

328.17 330.80 A: no no no i we're close to marshall 

330.93 336.03 A: marshall university and so but that's really 

331.64 332.76 B: (( okay [noise] )) 

336.41 338.22 A: all i mean i don't 

338.34 340.62 A: like you said hide in the basement or 

340.91 342.24 B: [laughter] 

341.50 346.75 A: [laughter] i don't worry about things like that much i i would go to new york i don't 

346.02 350.81 B: yeah i would too there is absolutely no reason i wouldn't do that actually i would like to go there 

346.95 348.29 A: (( i would go to washington )) 

350.98 351.94 B: [laughter] 

351.08 357.62 A: yeah i would too would too but i'm not sure i'd fly [laughter] 

352.26 353.28 B: i i 

355.19 360.81 B: no i'd probably wouldn't fly because i just wouldn't [laughter] 

359.19 361.93 A: right well it's not that far away 

361.64 364.90 B: right i'd probably take a train it's just easier 

364.49 366.27 A: right right 

366.34 367.51 A: (( but um [noise] )) 

366.53 369.29 B: and i'm trying to think 

370.26 372.07 B: what else yes 

371.12 376.49 A: the bioterrorism thing i guess you know after nine eleven with anthrax and stuff i 

376.91 380.36 A: i worry about that 'cause my husband is a nurse but 

381.01 383.84 A: again what can you do about it [laughter] there's not anything 

383.91 385.57 A: you can do about it so 

384.62 386.58 B: no there isn't 

385.87 389.28 A: i'm kinda that type person you'd make yourself crazy if you 

388.39 392.60 B: yes you would you would absolutely make yourself crazy 

392.40 393.59 A: (( but um )) 

393.80 394.88 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

394.02 395.19 A: i don't know 

395.09 402.05 B: yeah i you know i what about like wondering about spending money or not spending money or 

401.31 406.59 A: oh i don't worry about that at all we we bought a house this year we bought a new automobile this year 

405.77 407.26 B: (( yeah )) 

406.67 408.26 A: so i 

408.17 410.05 A: spending money doesn't course 

409.44 410.22 B: [laughter] 

409.88 417.14 A: the field my husband's in there's always a need for it i guess if he was in a different field i might worry because his father in law got laid off 

412.78 414.06 B: right 

416.97 427.16 A: a couple of weeks ago and he's an engineer so you know it isn't just construction workers and people like this that are getting laid off anymore it's people who have degrees but 

424.38 426.13 B: right it's everybody 

427.41 436.64 A: in health care there's usually a need and i guess i don't think about it that much he there's always a job for a nurse so i don't really worry about it 

436.67 437.63 B: do you wor- 

438.15 440.18 B: oh my call waiting keeps beeping 

439.35 443.02 A: [laughter] uh i stay at home with the children

444.39 445.87 B: (( so do i it )) 

445.20 446.43 A: (( but um )) 

446.78 453.88 A: whenever september eleven happened i was pregnant and i was going in for my ultrasound to see 

448.18 449.48 B: won't come out 

454.07 458.72 A: the baby was a girl or a boy and all that was going on over the intercom 

455.33 456.66 B: uh-huh [noise] 

458.88 467.68 A: while i was getting my ultrasound so i have an ultrasound all her ultrasound pictures have september eleventh on 'em that was the date that i had her ultrasound done

497.15 498.33 B: right 

499.52 507.05 A: i think anybody could take over the united states and blues clues would not be interrupted any of these t._v. channels the cartoon 

503.83 504.39 B: (( [noise] )) 

505.64 508.39 B: [laughter] they didn't interrupt it [noise]

512.35 513.39 B: (( [laughter] [mn] ))

536.94 538.15 A: (( right ))

542.87 543.58 B: (( [mn] )) 

544.68 550.17 A: it didn't and if i'd have been home that day i probably wouldn't have known until i put him down for a nap
