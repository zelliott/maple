354.62 366.19 B: and i can remember we were thinking about going up there but then i had just had my son my son was just a few weeks old at the time and we're of course clo- closer to portland and we didn't go to portland not only because my son was too little but 

366.04 375.49 B: just because we were afraid that whoever was in seattle was going to come down to portland [laughter] and that all the people would be coming from seattle to portland just because it was you know one of the nearer places to go 

369.28 370.23 A: [laughter] 

375.18 376.20 A: yeah 

375.42 383.57 B: and i can remember that that fear just just oh i don't want to leave the house i'm afraid the the world's going to blow up i mean we watched that t._v. expecting something to happen in new york city 

383.39 384.39 A: yeah 

383.79 387.52 B: on on the millenium you know we we're freaked out [laughter] i can i can

405.02 407.58 B: (( oh i am [laughter] )) 

405.95 411.48 A: [laughter] but i you know the first time i flew first of all going to the airport and having there be you know 

411.55 417.54 A: armed forces there you know standing at attention with guns was totally surreal 

412.73 414.32 B: mhm yeah 

417.40 418.55 B: yeah 

417.87 427.17 A: um and and then and then just like realizing that i was actually really really anxious just sort of vaguely generally anxious the whole time i was flying you know 

424.50 428.55 B: well yeah because you're more aware of that kind of stuff yeah it it makes you 

428.34 439.83 B: more aware of of threats of of things like that happening on you know flights you know what happened to us we came back i ended up met somebody and actually got married last year too so that was another [laughter] effect

466.90 481.55 B: i mean in front of everybody it was some kind of a a verbal skirmish and and he just said you know what because of this happening last year there is no way you are going to threaten me [laughter] they just had her hauled off and it was just i mean and she wasn't i mean she wasn't a young teenager that was just 

468.19 469.23 A: wow
