6.67 12.75 A: nice talking to you [laughter] this is my first call so [laughter] 

8.09 10.17 B: [laughter] we have oh 

10.24 16.48 B: [laughter] well these are pretty exciting i've i've done a couple so you just talk for ten minutes and then it's just 

16.71 19.40 B: they just stop [laughter] 

17.74 20.62 A: [laughter] 

19.60 23.56 B: so our topic is how our lives have changed since september eleventh 

24.21 26.89 B: so well where you on september eleventh 

26.74 31.85 A: um i was um uh initially uh about uh 

32.06 36.27 A: two minutes from my office when the uh when i got the news and uh 

36.50 41.93 A: uh then then watched it on t._v. uh at the office and uh uh 

41.12 41.78 B: (( mm )) 

44.61 50.60 A: so that was a that that def- definitely a uh a sad difficult day uh 

49.68 64.47 B: yeah yeah it it was mine was about the same i was at the i was at work and uh i early start time so we were all together when the thing began and so we were all sitting around the t._v. all day long pretty much [laughter] that was about it 

62.48 65.35 A: mhm yeah yeah 

64.58 70.22 B: well has anything changed in your life i'm trying to think of anything uh in mine has particularly but um 

69.97 76.91 A: well probably my attitude toward uh uh toward america and our country has probably been uh strengthened and and uh 

76.92 78.76 A: um certainly um 

79.43 81.39 A: have given a lot more uh 

81.76 85.98 A: uh thought at least and and uh appreciation 

86.20 100.11 B: mhm you know that's interesting i i had forgotten about that but that that first initial wave of patriotism was really exciting i thought it was sort of lovely to see people flying the flag again and and talking about how much they love the their country again 

99.51 110.96 A: yeah like i i have uh i have kids they're in the twenty to twenty five range and and it was a it was a really um 

100.13 101.68 B: yeah it was really lovely 

106.39 107.30 B: mhm 

111.07 112.30 A: um 

112.61 120.76 A: uh really exciting to see them be brought into a patriotic situation 

120.59 121.62 B: mhm 

121.00 126.90 A: where they they had not really experienced that before certainly not one of of being um 

124.62 125.58 B: mhm 

126.82 137.77 A: um of of looking at their their lives and their their the things that they had and uh uh wondering if they were going to continue 

135.49 136.69 B: yeah 

137.82 141.29 A: the same way so uh i think it's it was good 

140.72 153.47 B: yeah you know it's funny i i'm i'm twenty nine so i'm in that range but i grew up partially in europe and so you know all the ex patriot kind of have this feeling like you know america's this great country that we come from 

153.38 154.37 A: mhm 

153.46 167.70 B: so i kind of had that anyway coming into this but it was su- it it's always very odd when you come back to the states and nobody's sort of you know wandering around wearing the flag tee shirts and stuff and happy to proclaim themselves americans you forget about how 

166.94 168.44 A: yeah exactly 

167.74 169.85 B: how quickly people forget you know 

169.69 172.44 A: yeah it is we we we uh um uh 

172.50 185.27 A: we take things for granted very easily and that that's it's it's it's normal i guess and so when things like that happen um i'm i'm very very much one that that looks at at 

182.52 183.36 B: mhm 

185.64 199.15 A: difficult situations and tries to find opportunities um uh yeah in in them and so you know obviously it it was a horrible situation but it happened and so um the challenge is to 

188.64 189.58 B: mhm 

199.08 211.76 A: um to to take what's left and and and build on it and and um and find uh find things that are positive out of it and i think there many many positive things that uh 

211.74 214.64 A: uh that were uh results of it 

214.86 228.06 B: mhm mm well you know you were talking about not taking things for granted and i think that's one of the re- ways that my life's really changed was that i i ah have a tendency to keep up with people that i love a little bit more carefully than i did before september eleventh 

214.95 215.81 A: so 

228.24 231.67 B: especially um i i thinking about um 

228.53 229.11 A: (( [laughter] )) 

231.83 244.89 B: my two very best friends from college and i have have talked a lot more and seen a lot more of each other since the attacks i think than we would have normally we just make that little extra effort you know just to make sure we keep in touch 

244.80 246.96 A: sure it reminds us of our 

245.42 246.49 B: (( which is a )) 

247.01 253.90 A: of our vulnerability and and and and frailty as human beings and and uh so that's um 

248.40 250.33 B: mm definitely 

254.76 256.41 A: that's been a good thing 

255.69 265.34 B: yeah well what about some negative things have you uh have you put off any travel or uh um put off uh going overseas at all since you since the attacks or anything of that nature 

265.02 276.62 A: mhm not not as a as a result of the attacks i i did it did impact some some business trips immediately following but it one one of them we just we drove [laughter] one 

272.39 274.27 B: (( mm right )) 

275.78 280.63 B: [laughter] 

276.65 281.16 A: of my guys we got in the suburban and and drove and that was 

281.22 283.59 A: uh yeah that that was good too 

283.51 284.44 B: [laughter] 

283.91 286.53 A: but uh uh we have 

286.59 291.83 A: just recently the last few weeks been impacted by the the sars things it was it was 

291.41 292.69 B: (( yeah )) 

291.90 296.09 A: headed to china a couple of weeks ago and and decided to 

296.36 298.76 A: hold off on that trip for a little while 

298.19 303.02 B: yeah it's probably not too bad of an idea [laughter] 

300.03 303.61 A: [laughter] so 

303.53 310.32 B: well yeah it's interesting it's so interesting now thinking back wh- to pre september eleventh how 

303.87 304.68 A: uh 

310.35 316.99 B: it's very small things that have shifted but there is a definite mindset shift i think at the same time as well i'm 

316.10 323.91 A: well i yeah i i think that that uh we went through uh you know eight years of of 

323.87 335.11 A: really very difficult times in the administration and in our ability to respect and and and really um feel like we had good leadership 

334.78 335.76 B: mhm 

334.95 340.46 A: um and uh then this came along and and uh we've seen 

340.29 355.29 A: i think a a very um honest forthright uh approach to the problems in a in a very direct and and uh certainly decisive approach and and uh uh i think the the 

351.07 352.01 B: mhm 

355.47 356.50 A: um 

356.76 365.59 A: uh it a a feeling that whereas you may not agree with with everything uh or might not that that our leaders do 

365.32 366.54 B: mhm 

365.86 372.90 A: at least there's a a level of integrity and and and a um uh and a follow through that's that's 

372.92 382.98 A: you know professional an- and seems to be and seems to be what it what it appears to be and you you take folks like rumsfeld and and uh um you know 

374.62 375.90 B: yeah 

378.08 379.11 B: mhm 

383.17 387.48 A: he's entertaining uh at the same time he's he's he's 

385.59 386.80 B: mhm 

387.62 398.37 A: direct you you feel like you can trust him and and you feel like uh uh you know it's a pretty good team that's uh um uh that's working for us and and that so 

390.28 391.51 B: mhm 

396.73 397.71 B: yeah 

397.78 404.98 B: very much well yeah and even you know the team that's over uh in iraq as well you know you just really get the the sense of their uh 

405.05 409.07 B: they've got the goal in mind this time and they're going to get it done you know 

409.71 415.55 B: whereas before i think the first gulf war you know we we we stopped a little short of where we needed to go you know 

414.82 416.85 A: (( yeah yes it )) 

415.80 420.07 B: and this could have all been this could have all been over with perhaps if we had gone 

419.84 421.29 A: (( it it could have been )) 

420.11 421.34 B: a little further 

421.20 426.02 A: yeah and i think that's one of the lessons uh that's one of the lessons that that uh 

425.92 427.71 A: you know probably 

427.52 429.44 A: um is being 

429.24 443.40 A: uh looked at and saying we don't want to make that mistake again um we we we did let a lot of people down who who felt that they could count on us then and now we're suffering uh the consequence of of it being a little more difficult to get their trust and and uh and support 

430.33 431.68 B: mhm 

432.74 434.05 B: right 

443.25 445.73 A: uh because they're not sure 

445.69 460.33 A: um but uh um yeah i i ah and besides that we get to watch our our money um you know exploding and and you know and [laughter] doing all kinds of things [laughter] 

449.25 450.05 B: (( mhm )) 

455.15 456.75 B: right 

457.11 465.04 B: [laughter] well you know you know you sa- you said you know you a lot of ah business trips and things were 

465.13 472.01 B: uh put off and and right around september eleventh but what about your business itself did it suffer from the consequences of the attacks 

471.91 473.15 A: um it 

472.16 475.11 B: have you felt that it that it that effect at all 

474.77 478.79 A: we we we have not um uh i'm in 

479.06 486.52 A: uh a actually a technology business but we're in a service bureau basically process a lot of health care claims 

482.10 482.81 B: (( mm )) 

486.22 487.97 B: ah mhm 

486.53 492.98 A: and and uh um uh our our business is actually been been growing 

493.04 504.79 A: growing pretty nicely but i wouldn't say that we're necessarily typical of the business we i mean of the industry or or uh we just happen to be at a point in in the the growth of our company when 

497.53 498.27 B: (( mm mm )) 

505.05 506.62 A: things started to click 

507.11 508.33 A: (( and how about yourself )) 

508.38 515.35 B: well i actually yeah well it pretty much my primary job didn't i i'm a a radio producer but i i that didn't really 

515.21 529.48 B: slack off that much people still needed their radio thankfully but um yeah i'm also one of my hobbies is acting and a lot of the theatres that i work for have felt a very stiff drop off in uh ticket sales because of 

518.26 519.29 A: mhm 

526.76 528.03 A: mhm 

529.85 541.90 B: especially because of the war but right after september eleventh there was a huge downturn in ticket sales people just didn't want to leave their houses which is completely understandable [laughter] but no it really affected it 

534.95 535.81 A: (( true )) 

539.56 549.95 A: yeah yeah yeah i i i had involvement in in in some retail um uh businesses and they were they were hit 

550.22 550.98 B: (( mm )) 

550.32 552.35 A: they were hit hit really hard 

552.03 553.50 B: (( mm mhm )) 

552.64 554.37 A: (( and uh )) 

554.48 555.54 A: (( um so )) 

555.62 558.78 A: um you know there there 

558.98 567.52 A: but i think the other side is that we were probably due for a recession anyway and uh or going into one and so um actually 

564.27 565.71 B: mhm 

566.64 567.95 B: good correction 

567.82 569.83 A: yeah i'm actually uh 

569.98 580.15 A: uh i mean if this is the worst that we see um it it's not been very difficult compared to what we saw in the early eighties and and you know so 

575.45 576.43 B: mhm 

578.05 580.02 B: mm mhm yeah 

580.23 593.26 B: yeah absolutely well speaking of which how long do you think these effects are going to last i mean what what's your opinion of of uh how this recession and and a lot of the things which came directly out of september eleventh how long do you think they're gonna last 

594.18 595.24 A: um 

596.86 599.90 A: i i am not certain that
