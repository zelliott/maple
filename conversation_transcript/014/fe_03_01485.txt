92.89 93.95 A: mhm 

94.75 96.10 A: mhm 

99.68 102.83 A: yeah i think what did it for me was

103.70 106.30 A: when they blew up the u._s._s. cole 

106.46 114.09 A: the um a navy ship and a couple of navy men were killed i think that's what bought it to my attention in that very swift

114.16 114.94 A: (( with )) 

115.10 118.61 A: (( osama bin laden and all but i really ))

122.01 125.60 B: no kidding that was incredible 

124.55 126.70 A: yeah um 

127.01 130.88 A: who could imagine such thing [laughter] yeah [laughter] 

129.05 138.95 B: right yeah it's one of the things you don't realise and then it happens and and it does change the way you think like like you said about your kids just 

135.80 137.16 A: mhm 

138.28 146.51 A: yeah when the war started and all i was even apprehensive about them going to the mall or 

146.83 152.91 A: you know we like to go to baseball games and we were trying to debate whether or not it would be safe or not and 

151.98 153.44 B: [laughter] oh no 

153.12 161.03 A: you know every little thing you know is part of your thinking now which before september eleventh you wouldn't have given it another thought 

156.93 158.26 B: mhm 

160.66 162.07 B: right 

161.27 162.22 A: yeah 

163.09 165.84 B: no it's so true so true 

164.81 165.84 A: (( yeah you )) 

166.03 180.11 A: see jets flying around all the time and we are not too far from a military base either so there's always something going on [laughter] with them flying their helicopters and stuff i don't know what they be doing [laughter] 

171.82 172.90 B: really 

179.00 180.01 B: huh 

180.05 181.39 B: that's true 

180.82 182.38 A: mhm 

181.69 187.59 B: yeah we don't get much that much of that round here but we should watch the news though and 

183.90 185.08 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

187.53 190.20 A: yeah i always watch the news and 

190.62 196.53 A: well i watch it and then well my some of my kids are older but then my youngest daughter 

198.20 206.00 A: after september eleventh when it first happened she was really afraid because i guess being a kid and that happening in school 

205.81 207.32 B: yeah that's true 

206.13 211.94 A: you you get scared you know and a little while after that she was really scared a lot but now 

212.12 218.69 A: unfortunately you have to i guess she's just learned to adapt you know just have that 

216.53 217.65 B: (( oh okay )) 

219.06 224.94 A: uncertance that uncertain feeling that you know who knows what's gonna happen 

219.27 219.95 B: (( okay )) 

224.67 226.38 B: right 

225.39 230.22 A: if anything but it's still in her thinking i guess it's in everybody's thinking 

228.48 229.35 B: uh-huh 

230.21 231.84 B: yeah definitely 

231.25 232.39 A: [laughter] 

231.97 238.96 B: did they show the september eleventh thing um to the elementary school kids when it happened 

238.01 239.52 A: they sure did 

239.04 243.05 B: they did okay yeah so that would cause a little bit of fear 

239.61 240.91 A: mhm 

242.55 250.11 A: yeah 'cause i was kinda surprised that they had showed it to them while they were in school [laughter] and 

247.55 248.71 B: right 

248.99 250.56 B: no kidding 

250.41 258.84 A: my daughter was like well why didn't you come and get me although they did close the schools early and she wanted me to meet her at the bus stop [laughter] and i was just like 

257.35 258.95 B: [laughter] 

259.01 261.10 A: i don't i don't know [laughter] 

260.53 262.06 B: no kidding 

261.70 263.50 A: yeah [laughter] 

264.27 265.13 B: huh 

266.41 268.40 B: so it does make you think though 

268.12 269.52 A: yeah 

269.49 271.26 B: just the different changes 

271.72 286.61 A: and i'm not not much of a flyer anyway i don't travel a lot but i guess if i did i probably would have would be i don't guess i would be afraid but it would be in my mind if i had to board a plane 

275.78 277.26 B: yeah 

286.25 287.94 B: (( mhm oh yeah definitely )) 

287.37 292.79 A: even still even now still you know especially with what went on in iraq 

292.86 294.77 B: right 

293.18 294.53 A: (( you know [mn] )) 

294.85 299.78 A: and they call us with this holy jihad against the united states [laughter] you know 

298.24 301.70 B: i know it's terrible it's so bad 

301.19 304.14 A: [laughter] you never know what they might be planning 

305.00 305.65 A: (( [laughter] )) 

305.07 313.06 B: no no i agree like i've never been much of a flyer but even now just more than just the fear factor like they just showed on the news that 

313.07 319.70 B: the biggest airline's about to go bankrupt because of of what happened even back in september eleventh 

315.79 316.96 A: mhm 

319.22 324.82 A: yeah and it's just weird how it just trink- trickles down to just 

325.10 327.62 A: (( a airline going bankrupt )) 

327.06 329.27 B: i know exactly 

328.34 329.44 A: [laughter] 

329.62 331.54 A: so i guess a lot of people 

331.55 337.82 A: probably feel kinda like i do maybe they just don't wanna take the chance of getting on a airplane [laughter] 

335.66 336.68 B: mhm 

337.34 338.77 B: right 

338.21 339.53 A: right now 

339.33 340.76 B: yep 

340.20 340.85 A: [laughter] 

340.81 343.23 B: no it is a it is a concern 

342.92 344.28 A: mhm 

344.48 347.73 B: but i guess we just keep on living 

347.02 357.47 A: yeah and my aunt she works on a military base and um she's looking for a new job now because she said after september eleventh 

350.86 351.70 B: (( mhm )) 

357.73 360.05 A: it's like really hard 

360.31 361.82 B: oh really 

361.03 372.40 A: to get on and off the base um because she doesn't drive so someone always takes her to work and they could no longer drive her close to the ba- building where she works 

367.34 369.10 B: mhm 

372.34 374.19 B: oh really 

372.76 385.33 A: because 'cause they could not come on the base at all [laughter] so she has a nice little walk from where they can drop her off to where she actually works and she's like that's a big inconvenience 

376.01 377.57 B: (( oh incredible )) 

380.14 381.31 B: [laughter] 

382.27 384.01 B: right 

384.77 386.46 B: no kidding 

385.59 391.98 A: so there's just another example of how september eleventh have just changed a lot [laughter] 

391.20 402.12 B: yeah that's true yeah more than just our own willingness to change or or inside it's actually forced to mhm 

395.78 398.17 A: yeah yeah 

398.70 400.84 A: yeah yep that's so true 

401.66 409.16 A: and then unfortunately there's some americans who would like to take september eleventh out on 

409.68 416.91 A: arab americans i guess you could say you know that's really unfortunate 'cause it's not really their fault [laughter] 

411.37 412.40 B: yeah 

416.51 419.34 B: yeah i agree completely 

417.69 418.71 A: mhm 

419.16 420.60 A: 'cause they are pretty much 

420.90 424.62 A: running away from that you know by coming here 

422.07 423.62 B: yeah 

424.09 429.10 B: uh-huh that's the whole reason they're here to create a new life but 

426.24 427.15 A: (( [laughter] )) 

429.23 430.98 B: that is unfortunate 

430.26 433.58 A: yeah i heard a couple of stories of the news of 

433.60 439.66 A: kids were harassed at school and neighbors harassing neighbors because of you know they were arab americans and 

441.67 443.14 B: mhm 

442.58 448.63 A: stuff but then again it kinda makes i guess i i would never harass anyone but [mn] 

448.79 453.85 A: maybe if i had'd someone in my neighborhood who was an arab and they were 

454.44 464.36 A: not particularly friendly and just you know act weird i guess maybe i would be a little suspicious after september eleventh you know 

456.56 458.10 B: mhm 

459.28 460.34 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

461.77 462.85 B: right 

463.43 465.09 B: of course mhm 

464.49 467.91 A: but i would never harass anyone [laughter] mhm mhm 

466.44 467.37 B: no 

467.78 474.44 B: no well i heard a report where um they did the the um 

474.71 486.03 B: they did some oh what are they called surveys about how people react when they see arab americans you know most of it wasn't so much the harassing and things but they'd actually like 

477.18 478.14 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

485.98 497.08 B: realise without realizing that they would walk around people instead of like going right next to them like we would normally they'd actually like go out of their way to 

497.39 501.76 B: get to like go around arab americans it was really 

499.30 502.58 A: mhm right right just try to avoid them mhm mhm 

501.89 504.64 B: mhm that's really tough 

506.13 510.76 A: and then right after seven- september eleventh was the big anthrax thing 

510.82 512.23 B: no kidding 

511.58 515.30 A: [laughter] oh boy and they never figured that one out though 

514.86 518.16 B: yeah that's what i was just gonna ask so they haven't figured it out at all 

517.34 519.07 A: no uh-uh 

519.60 526.81 A: so then not only did was you dealing with september eleventh but then you were scared oh what if something's in my mail [laughter] 

525.78 528.97 B: oh no kidding yeah 

526.82 528.44 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

529.14 531.08 B: oh these times are crazy 

530.63 533.18 A: yeah they are [laughter] 

534.57 536.26 B: no kidding 

535.76 549.66 A: then they started with the small pox scare like are they gonna give us with small pox and 'cause they didn't order that small pox vaccinations for military and hospital workers i guess [laughter] yeah 

538.41 540.29 B: right 

547.30 548.87 B: right 

549.54 554.03 A: so i was like okay [laughter] 

551.18 552.68 B: [laughter]

567.30 568.69 B: yep get your 

569.58 572.42 B: your life into perspective where it should be and 

571.10 575.81 A: yep yeah that's right that's exactly right yep [laughter] 

574.57 577.35 B: mhm no kidding
