101.83 103.62 B: called around the city 

103.11 109.41 A: well when it did first happen um there were reports all over the country you know that things were going on and 

109.46 114.36 A: you never knew who was what was going on on the first day 

113.58 120.27 B: that's very true there were reports and some of them just weren't even true but no i even the um 

120.19 130.65 B: the reporters are the people in office at that time didn't know themselves what was going on so they go ahead and report something and then they change it and it was just real unstable 

125.05 126.31 A: right 

130.11 139.96 A: that's true that's true but no but i am just i don't want to fly i don't want to get i don't want to get there what do they say you have to get there two hours ahead of time or something 

131.81 133.13 B: mhm 

139.67 144.66 B: they do and even if you did all that just the thought of it is a bit scary 

144.30 148.20 A: i know i have two young children myself they're five and two i mean 

147.38 148.44 B: oh 

148.47 155.95 A: i can't imagine i feel like putting us on separate planes or something you know just seems like a big mess to do that 

152.29 153.90 B: oh yeah 

155.30 165.18 B: yeah that was let's see that was two years ago i guess two and a half years ago no one yeah ah were your your kids were too small to be in school that day weren't they 

159.39 160.58 A: mhm 

164.68 172.96 A: yeah but my husband came home they yeah and we're really you know we're really far away although one of the planes did crash in pennsylvania but 

166.63 167.78 B: oh did he 

172.08 174.02 B: yeah that's what i was thinking 

173.47 178.83 A: yeah but it's far away from here and um they still they closed work and sent him home 

179.05 187.37 B: i see well that's a that was a very natural thing to do even some places way down here closed down and and sent people home 

186.95 189.01 A: (( ahah ahah )) 

187.62 189.26 B: but my daughter 

189.38 197.28 B: my grandchildren's mother works in a a skyscraper in downtown atlanta she's like on the thirty first floor or something like that 

193.20 195.31 A: (( [mn] oh )) 

195.65 199.03 A: oh oh that must of been scary for you 

198.49 204.46 B: it was very scary and what happened on the day that it happened i was still sleeping that morning 

204.54 211.15 B: and she called me and woke me up and she said mama the country's und- under attack i said what 

209.61 210.54 A: mm 

211.07 212.39 A: (( mm )) 

211.84 217.98 B: uh it took me a moment to get myself together to just really grasp what she has said so then i 

217.99 221.29 B: turned on everything i could to learn what i could and 

220.85 221.94 A: right 

221.39 226.17 B: as we said before everything was all up in the air and nobody really knew what was happening 

225.94 227.07 A: uh-huh 

226.87 227.97 B: so 

227.51 228.83 A: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

228.56 229.97 B: i just hope 

229.71 231.02 A: exactly 

230.44 235.32 B: that it just never happens again but it makes you not think that it won't happen again 

235.13 242.86 A: i know and i know there's been a lot of air travel since that time and everything's been fine i understand that statistically you know we're safe 

242.43 244.72 B: mhm true mhm 

243.16 255.88 A: but i just can't bring myself you know really and it's the waits too i i can't imagine keeping my kids in control [laughter] going through the the things that we'd have to go through all the security checks and everything 

250.29 252.59 B: (( [laughter] )) 

255.55 268.08 B: it is and then uh i don't think very many people have gotten have just snik- sneaked anything through security except that guy that they caught that richard guy with the bomb thing in his shoe or something 

266.87 269.31 A: in his shoe that's right 

268.38 271.96 B: but you still don't know whether somebody like that might 

272.14 274.53 B: get past there or something 

273.96 277.68 A: that's true that's true they had all those news programs about 

277.86 284.83 A: how they look at things you know your luggage and and it just looked so iffy some of that stuff [laughter] you know 

283.86 286.36 B: it does indeed and they uh 

286.51 288.45 B: it looks very iffy 

287.84 288.89 A: (( uh-huh )) 

288.46 297.53 B: and they look plus they tell you that they do random checks now that scares me a little bit although i know they can't just check every single one 

296.72 298.48 A: (( uh right [mn] )) 

297.71 309.02 B: but some criminal could look through this look through the system maybe and and just calculate what a random check would would uh where that would put him and he could try something 

307.32 308.37 A: oh i nev- 

308.56 310.67 A: (( yeah i never thought of that )) 

310.30 311.36 B: (( mm )) 

310.79 312.48 A: oh for pity's sake 

311.84 314.47 B: maybe i'm paranoid [laughter] 

313.40 318.41 A: no you're right you're absolutely right to feel that way oh 

315.89 324.88 B: uh-uh [laughter] if i were a terrorist god forbid i could sift it through that random check thing i believe 

324.30 325.59 A: (( right )) 

325.01 326.50 B: mhm 

325.60 327.44 A: right that's right 

327.15 328.67 B: mhm 

329.01 331.24 B: so you don't know and then 

329.15 330.34 A: well 

330.91 337.32 A: you know i guess we have made one other small change we ha- we fly an american flag off of our porch 

336.73 339.35 B: oh yeah that will mhm 

337.46 338.31 A: which 

338.37 347.32 A: yeah which is funny 'cause that we never did it before 'cause i'm a veteran but uh [laughter] yeah but now we've got the flag out so 

342.81 343.88 B: oh are you 

346.37 350.86 B: well i'm glad you didn't get called back i guess you're not in reserve or something 

350.13 353.17 A: well you know i'm pretty old [laughter] 

351.92 354.63 B: oh well you got some little bitty children 

354.16 364.66 A: yes i do i'm i'm an old mom [noise] no i was done a in ninety two no ninety i was done in ninety 

354.97 359.72 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

364.78 366.94 A: so they wouldn't call me back 

366.70 368.70 B: you were out in i'm sorry 

368.08 370.33 A: i was uh i was out of the 

369.30 373.15 B: you were done in ninety oh i see mhm 

370.34 371.45 A: in ninety 

371.85 374.05 A: mhm yeah 

373.42 383.24 B: yeah it's sad i feel um that september the eleventh made a lot of changes in the country has something to do with causing this war that i hate so much 

382.64 385.63 A: i know i agree 

383.50 384.79 B: and uh 

385.16 386.62 B: mhm 

386.15 391.53 A: i agree but you know what they're finding that uh [sigh] you know when the war started i thought 

391.84 394.97 A: that it really didn't have anything to do with terrorism but 

394.52 397.93 B: yeah and me too i was very much against it 

397.35 399.75 A: me too me too [sigh] 

398.99 403.23 B: but they are finding something that might relate to it you say 

402.55 405.77 A: i think so i thi- i remember reading um 

406.34 414.85 A: that there were some things found that were suspicious and now we know [noise] you know this article was saying now we know that it's true 

409.25 410.54 B: mhm 

414.57 415.94 B: mhm 

415.15 419.66 A: that terrorism was coming out of that country so 

418.86 426.67 B: yeah i certainly need to read up on that i'm a very newsy person i'm addicted to things line nightline and that kind of thing 

425.97 427.81 A: right ah 

426.81 428.92 B: dateline and all of those 

428.12 429.35 A: (( uh-huh )) 

428.95 436.62 B: i haven't seen that but september the eleventh just caused a lot of um panic and uh rightly so 

434.38 435.32 A: yeah 

436.32 438.43 A: right right 

437.00 438.13 B: (( mhm )) 

438.62 439.79 B: but it didn't 

439.95 445.17 B: back to the subject it didn't really do anything for me but upset me [laughter] 

444.40 450.37 A: i yeah right just every little backfire you hear at night you know or [laughter] 

445.22 446.58 B: uh-huh 

449.57 452.18 B: yeah [laughter] 

451.15 455.76 A: some odd noise here and there and you think what the heck is that you know 

455.43 461.57 B: yeah i'd been considering getting a flag to go out front and i just didn't get around to it but um 

456.02 457.10 A: it's true 

461.20 462.39 A: yeah 

461.82 464.42 B: i'm very patriotic of course 

463.81 466.61 A: oh yeah oh yeah 

464.48 465.89 B: mhm 

465.98 471.60 B: i just hope it never happens again at least it put us it put this country on ready to uh 

472.05 473.97 B: to know that it could happen 

473.56 479.48 A: that's right we're [mn] we're getting a lot better at at being able to catch those kind of things now 

474.12 475.71 B: mhm 

479.10 484.47 B: it is we were very relaxed this kind of thing just couldn't happen to us and then it did 

483.90 484.95 A: right 

485.72 487.18 B: so maybe 

486.70 490.59 A: like they got rid of that professor down in florida that 

489.80 491.43 B: oh yeah 

490.62 495.35 A: that was so sur- so strange i mean he had been there for like ten years 

494.94 498.46 B: yes he had there are a lot of um 

498.55 502.84 B: cha- little changes like that i don't know exactly what um 

503.87 509.17 B: what his connection was he he has a lot of support saying that there was no connection 

505.21 506.13 A: right 

508.42 509.86 A: i know 

509.26 512.27 B: but something's fishy somewhere i don't know 

511.74 512.95 A: yeah 

512.57 514.37 B: mhm but anyway 

515.01 517.83 B: eliminating them one by one [laughter] 

517.46 518.50 A: (( yeah )) 

517.91 524.09 B: if no you know if no more would uh is good if indeed he's guilty of anything 

523.60 525.34 A: right right 

525.49 536.18 B: it didn't change my viewing habits uh i guess it did i've always been a rather news fanatic but that is the one thing that september eleven did for me it made me 

531.35 532.50 A: uh-huh 

536.19 541.29 B: get more into c._n._n. and things like that so i guess it did change me to that degree 

541.49 547.64 A: yeah i remember watching back when the first gulf war was going on because i was in the military then 

547.16 548.75 B: oh yeah right 

548.12 562.87 A: so i could not leave that t._v. alone and i was so stressed out about it i would wake up and my teeth were just gritted and my head hurt because i was grinding my tee- teeth all night and i was just so upset you know by the i couldn't turn the news off 

550.11 551.29 B: uh-huh 

557.52 559.15 B: i'm sure 

562.51 570.77 B: i'm sure you were especially if you were in it and i didn't think about it when you first gave me the date that you left the service but that is about right 

570.18 571.60 A: that's right 

571.01 573.99 B: so that must of been very nerve racking for you 

573.44 577.63 A: it was and you know what was was interesting about that was uh 

577.70 585.45 A: my unit was so far away from everything um the people that i knew were about three hundred miles away 

580.94 582.45 B: oh yeah 

584.89 586.63 B: (( oh mhm )) 

585.74 589.61 A: so that was good you know that they were so far away 

589.72 592.43 B: mhm you just so you thought it was good 

590.04 591.24 A: and 

592.35 597.44 A: well it was good for me that my friends you know were so far away 

597.01 599.19 B: oh yeah oh yeah 

597.77 599.18 A: you know that they were 

599.41 599.89 A: not
