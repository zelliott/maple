0.44 1.72 A: hello 

1.08 2.47 B: hello 

2.19 4.22 A: yes hi my name is oleg 

4.03 5.25 B: i'm tammy 

4.96 6.57 A: tammy nice to meet you 

6.18 7.37 B: nice to meet you 

8.71 9.68 A: so 

8.73 11.48 B: you wanna start [laughter] 

9.77 13.91 A: have you had any changes in your life after september eleventh 

13.81 16.14 B: no not really i mean we're more 

16.50 24.45 B: you know we watch more i mean we watch more of the t._v. and i mean kinda keep more on the national news you know 

24.15 25.32 A: yeah 

24.75 29.80 B: and that but i mean as for life itself i mean you really can't change it 

30.63 36.57 A: yes um i really believe that uh the position of the united states is fairly 

36.59 42.65 A: secure as it is because you know we're a big country we're across the ocean from other people 

42.79 44.16 A: and uh 

44.87 50.05 A: the way security is set up now it's a lot tighter so i don't really think uh 

50.76 56.37 A: that september eleventh could happen again something like that could happen again so i'm not worried that much 

57.03 70.44 B: right i feel i feel like like you said i mean we're m- we're i think since september eleventh things have gotten tighter you know like the security in new york city and i think people are more aware and they watch more 

70.83 72.31 B: and you know 

72.27 73.38 A: (( yes )) 

72.34 77.44 B: you kinda keep track of people around you as well as your family more than you did before 

77.68 79.31 A: i definitely do 

82.42 83.53 B: but 

83.54 89.59 A: well one thing i didn't do is uh i didn't start storing a yearly supply of food in my home [laughter] 

88.98 91.19 B: [laughter] oh no way 

90.62 95.03 A: [laughter] no just maybe an extra gallon of water 

95.39 99.48 A: not that it'll help me in case something real bad will happen 

98.85 100.02 B: right 

100.29 105.15 B: no we didn't go that far i mean we just live normal normal life i mean 

105.29 108.12 B: you kinda worry more when your kids go to school 

108.49 114.66 B: you know because i mean you just don't know what's gonna happen i mean if a terrorist went into the school 

115.03 116.42 B: you just don't know 

115.12 116.11 A: yeah 

116.70 118.68 B: what is gonna happen there 

119.14 123.78 B: so i'm more afraid of my kids going to school every day than i was before 

124.46 130.60 B: but as for life itself i mean you really can't change it especially when you have kids because i mean 

130.82 132.72 B: they don't understand you know 

133.21 138.45 A: yeah in cases like that i notice usually it's not the new change 

138.42 150.17 A: the life usually life would change you if you know something really bad happened and you have to adjust to that but fortunately we didn't really have to adjust to almost anything 

150.16 155.83 A: um there is of course tighter security and we have to adjust to that but we do not have to 

156.48 158.39 A: deal with it every day 

158.60 166.98 A: and that definitely makes a difference if we would have to deal with security every day and you know there would be check points and our peep- people on the road 

167.06 172.35 A: and you know well they suggested for us to carry guns twenty four seven 

172.36 174.97 A: you know that would definitely change our lives but 

174.23 175.80 B: yeah definitely 

175.13 180.35 A: so far well i've gone on as usual yeah we have to be more watchful for uh 

177.49 178.61 B: right 

180.41 186.84 A: stranger activity but uh there's also other people who watch for bad guys and we know that 

187.21 193.32 B: i notice too i watch i do watch c._n._n. more than i i ever used to since september eleventh 

193.58 199.26 B: just so i know what is going on around me where i never used to really watch the news [mn] 

199.13 204.26 A: mm yeah now that you mention it that's right i do check on the news more often and uh 

204.69 214.96 A: i now check on more news uh international more international news to see what's going on in the world not just uh what's going on in united states 

214.93 221.72 B: right see i i watch the news more i mean i only before september eleventh i hated to pick up a newspaper 

221.96 224.40 B: because i hated all the bad news 

224.56 229.25 B: but now i kinda keep track of what's going on because now i want to know 

229.36 231.92 B: where before i really i kinda just 

232.14 234.39 B: you know went with the flow of life 

234.43 235.81 A: mhm 

235.21 238.57 B: and now i wanna know [laughter] what's going on around me 

239.21 245.74 B: i mean here we don't really see a lot of what is going on we live in a small community ti- town 

245.42 246.67 A: mhm 

245.99 254.04 B: so i mean it's not as affected to us as it would be po- for say if we lived like in new york city washington d._c. 

254.20 257.05 B: you know the big cities like chicago 

256.64 258.03 A: (( yeah hm )) 

257.29 260.23 B: i mean places that actually would be hit 

260.81 266.55 B: i don't quite think they're gonna blow up a town that's what two miles long [laughter] you know 

267.13 281.55 A: yeah that's what makes you know united states better in this worse time because people there aren't many people in the same place at the same time so again people don't believe that um somebody would attack such spread out target 

282.09 285.03 A: so and we don't believe that something 

285.18 286.92 A: like somebody could 

286.92 295.75 A: deploy a nuclear weapon or maybe poison the water supply which would affect a great deal of people we just don't believe that it will happen we believe that uh 

295.71 306.40 A: i mean we're going to protected by the authorities by our government and so far considering nothing like that happened and i'm sure somebody thought about it at least 

306.51 311.93 A: if not try it i think we are in fairly good hands regarding the protection 

311.84 312.91 B: right 

312.56 316.85 A: of course i am a little worried about all this loss of privacy thing 

317.11 323.74 A: that government now m- n- wants to know more but they do know more and they collect more information and keep it about us 

324.34 327.85 B: but that's for our safety you know 

327.57 337.36 A: well i know it is for our safety but i'm still perplexed because you know what they collect for our safety can be always turned against us one way or another 

337.24 341.53 B: yeah that's true but i think of it as my safety you know 

341.87 343.04 B: i mean 

343.15 348.13 B: as long as it's being used for my safety uh i guess [laughter] i can feel assured you know 

347.81 356.92 A: well but you see you can't really draw the line where does your safety stops and where it you know becomes kind of overboard you don't know when it's gonna happen 

356.78 368.52 A: you most likely will never know that it ha- may- maybe it already have happened we don't know what might be an excessive amount of watching probing you know checking out people's lives 

356.82 358.03 B: right 

368.66 369.40 A: (( [cough] )) 

369.39 370.80 B: right that's true 

371.42 375.27 B: i do feel too that airline security is a lot better 

375.86 379.90 B: since september eleventh which is a plus because i mean 

380.18 384.94 B: really they didn't really you know it wasn't that great before september eleventh 

385.38 393.79 A: well and still there are all those reports of people bringing guns on a plane or people somebody slipping past the security at the airport 

393.99 395.72 A: it still happens 

395.95 400.31 B: well there's no foolproof way though you know that's the sad part 

399.29 405.85 A: except not flying that's what uh that's why american airlines were hurting right now because people have stopped flying 

405.46 406.61 B: right 

406.01 413.79 A: so you know i i'm personally if i have to fly i did fly after september eleventh and i would have no problem flying 

413.90 421.86 A: but um a lot of other people would probably rather drive take a train or just stay at home and use and make a phone call 

421.52 423.49 B: right that's true 

423.29 427.47 A: it does affect a lot of people who i know it didn't affect me in that way 

427.42 433.90 B: i mean the sad part is though there ain't anything there's no foolproof way to ever stop everything you know 

434.33 439.86 B: therefore i mean security it tight and but it is not gonna ever stop everything 

440.70 450.43 B: you know kinda like i mean now with this war i mean there's more security than there ever was like around the air bases but they're not gonna be able to stop everything if something happens 

450.96 465.19 A: yes i think by the way that is the reason why europe didn't want us to go it was to the war with iraq because europe is right there you know there is no sea and there is no three thousand miles of atlantic ocean separating them from this war 

465.69 469.99 A: it's almost in well i wouldn't say europe's backyard but uh 

470.05 475.12 A: it's very close so i really didn't think they wanted any trouble from uh 

471.46 472.94 B: right 

475.92 483.32 A: muslims who would be very offended by this war offended enough to go and do something about it physical to other people 

482.09 482.99 B: right 

483.20 489.21 B: right but it does make me feel good that the government is going after the terrorists and the people who are 

489.53 496.41 B: to blame for a lot of the stuff going on i mean showing 'em we're not gonna take it no more [mn] 

494.57 501.31 A: definitely because if we don't because they'll then they'll just know that they can do whatever they want and uh 

501.41 503.57 A: there won't be any repercussions 

503.25 504.58 B: right and until 

503.66 507.68 A: and uh they have to show them that yes they're definitely gonna be 

508.03 510.80 A: a pay back for anything they do 

510.54 516.92 B: right and they're also showing the families of nine eleven that they're not gonna let the those people's deaths 

517.15 518.48 B: you know go 

519.44 520.63 B: unnoticed 

520.35 521.38 A: yes 

520.77 527.36 B: by going after the people who are involved in it they're there for showing the families that you know 

527.73 531.91 B: they're taking care of business and they're not forgetting those people 

532.93 534.23 A: yes 

533.72 537.58 B: which i feel is a very good thing for closure for the people 

537.63 550.36 A: well i don't really think it would help them much it may help a little but i think it definitely helps the rest of us who didn't suffer the great loss like the people whose families and friends got hurt 

550.57 558.59 A: in september eleventh however uh we know that we now taking preventive measures and i believe that preventive measures 

558.63 562.08 A: in such cases are the best because 

562.85 567.31 A: we have to go in first and uh before somebody else can 

567.46 573.36 A: take a strike on american soil or american interest overseas we have to prevent it or show 

573.63 574.76 A: that uh 

575.22 584.60 A: if somebody does try to that they are gonna to be grave consequences much greater much wor- or lot worse consequences and what they can do to us 

584.48 585.47 B: right 

585.13 586.95 A: and i think it worked 

587.58 590.18 B: (( well we still haven't got 'em though [laughter] )) 

587.66 588.40 A: then 

590.84 592.68 A: (( [laughter] i really hope that )) 

591.95 592.64 B: [laughter] 

592.97 595.81 A: well we did win the war more or less 

595.62 598.39 B: right but now they're talking about more war 

596.27 597.12 A: and 

598.11 599.89 A: yes well unfortunately though the
