106.59 107.66 B: mhm 

107.88 112.27 A: so but after september eleventh i watch the news more 

112.54 114.28 A: [lipsmack] i um 

114.41 119.27 A: i watch the i watch the local and the national news more and i also read um 

119.35 125.04 A: more of the news in the newspaper after that and i think i was more aware of things 

124.88 138.42 A: and i watched and i was more careful too and i i made sure i locked my doors and my van and you know sometimes i'd go out a- to get into my van and it wasn't and i forgot to lock it i mean it's in the covered patio but we don't have a a carport we don't have a garage 

138.22 139.18 B: mhm 

138.45 140.19 A: and i locked my van 

140.58 144.62 A: more often i was more aware of keeping it locked and 

144.78 147.41 A: and just watching 

147.72 149.22 A: you know um 

149.27 151.41 A: for all kinds of safety issues 

151.41 165.32 A: watching looking out for strangers and i always take my take my k- children to school and drop 'em and pick 'em up and they've had some incidents right in their grade school where people are patrolling tr- and trying to lure kids into their um car with money or candy 

151.62 152.28 B: (( ri- )) 

153.78 154.89 B: mhm 

165.21 166.18 B: uh-huh 

165.73 172.67 A: happened in the last month and it's happened at a s- school in tempi also my husband works in the tempi school district 

172.47 173.39 B: uh-huh 

173.23 177.37 A: and so you know just any kind of safety issue is just like 

173.60 174.32 B: i 

177.39 179.78 A: you know and you watch and 

180.02 182.85 A: [lipsmack] and everything but it's uh 

182.06 182.92 B: (( and i- )) 

183.31 190.98 B: and i'm the same way too i was uh really careful before but i'm even more careful now 

191.05 194.48 B: than i was um before i was always one to 

194.34 206.49 B: lock my door but now [laughter] it's like i make sure i have my chain on my door my deadbolt lock everything is um [lipsmack] locked up i live in michigan and i live in a college town 

206.31 207.61 A: (( [lipsmack] oh [mn] )) 

206.61 213.65 B: so you know there's just a little bit of everyone here and and you just never know and um 

213.76 217.19 B: my boyfriend happens to work for the defense department 

216.73 217.88 A: oh really 

217.39 232.14 B: so it's the it just you know it's like and basically he tells me you know it's okay to fly it's not okay to fly and and that's the main reason why i haven't flown because they don't even feel that it's really safe so 

232.05 235.36 B: better safe than sorry [laughter] so 

234.42 235.26 A: (( right right )) 

235.50 244.56 B: i so i don't bother to um so when we see each other 'cause he doesn't live in michigan so when we see each- one another we always travel by car 

244.71 251.13 B: um instead of flying it takes a little while longer but at least the two of us feel a lot more safe 

245.38 246.25 A: right 

251.14 260.87 B: than um actually travelling by phone and one other thing i i've always been a news watcher you know first thing in the morning i get up and watch the news 'cause i'm a school teacher also 

260.88 274.67 B: and so first thing in the morning i get up and i watch the news but one way that it's affected me is the way um my family i'm because i'm the only one that lives here none of my family lives in the same town that i live in 

261.18 261.98 A: oh 

274.23 277.54 A: that's how i am too i'm the only one 

274.76 277.31 B: and yeah and i've got i- 

277.64 285.94 A: [lipsmack] that lives here i ha my my closest relative is well actually my sister moved to phoenix a year and a half ago but before that she got a job teaching 

285.82 286.79 B: mhm 

285.87 294.82 A: h- here she teaches for the phoenix d- day school for the deaf she teaches deaf um school she teaches english and history to high school students deaf sch- 

292.29 293.47 B: mhm 

294.86 295.74 A: (( uh students )) 

294.96 298.60 B: and it's hard so that's that's one of 

296.14 297.15 A: and 

297.39 301.08 A: up until then my closest relative was four hundred miles away 

300.70 309.38 B: oh my no well mine is only two hours away but i just keep more definitely keep in contact with them a lot more 

304.18 305.18 A: oh 

309.36 313.48 B: um if i'm leaving to go somewhere then i make sure 

313.27 322.64 B: that i call one of my family members and tell them where i'm going and give them numbers and then when i get there i make sure i check in with them again and 

322.42 334.66 B: just try to be a little bit more careful about you know where i'm going and making sure that someone knows where i'm going um for something oh you just never know what could possibly happen so 

326.51 327.48 A: right 

334.25 341.63 A: yeah normally only the people that we're gonna visit or my in laws you know know we're when gonna be gone or something or where we're gonna be 

341.00 341.92 B: right 

341.79 350.82 A: and i'm a little more careful about that now too in leaving numbers and what we've we do also is that i always stop the mail we stop the paper 

350.79 358.94 A: um and we con- we contact a real close friend or neighbor that can watch our house and sometimes they'll even come in and close the curtains and open 'em and 

358.25 359.40 B: mhm 

358.89 368.52 A: have a drink of water watch t._v. for a while you know and make it look like somebody's here and they'll park their car in the driveway for a while and we usually call the police and notify them we're gonna be gone 

368.51 369.72 B: mhm 

368.74 382.53 A: and everything and so [lipsmack] we do that kinda thing and we're and i think i've emailed more too i i make more contact with my family because you realize something can happen and your life could just be snuffed out in a m- second you know and 

382.50 388.26 A: things like this can happen and so it seemed like life is more precious and my family seem more precious to me 

386.36 387.46 B: (( right right )) 

388.12 399.92 A: and i'm away from them and it it's been really hard because i moved down here with a girlfriend i was single we both met our husbands here and my husband will probably never change his job he'll probably never move out of state 

399.67 400.72 B: mhm 

400.06 407.44 A: you know h- h- he got he has a doctorate degree and um he'll probably stay here where he's where he's at 

407.19 408.14 B: mhm 

407.51 408.73 A: and 

408.91 413.26 A: so i have to always travel a long distance i'm twelve hundred miles from where i grew up 

413.19 414.56 B: (( oh my )) 

414.05 415.58 A: so i grew up in wyoming 

415.54 416.65 B: (( [laughter] and i )) 

415.66 417.12 A: north western wyoming 

417.00 422.33 B: and i think it's hard just being two hours away 'cause my family is really close 

422.18 423.61 A: oh i know that 

422.40 424.69 B: and there's eleven of us 

424.32 428.84 A: [lipsmack] i would love to live two hours from family that would be wonderful [laughter] 

424.77 425.70 B: (( so )) 

426.52 427.44 B: (( [laughter] )) 

427.36 432.07 B: yeah and so you know i'm the only one well myself and i've got 

431.85 442.46 B: two other um siblings that don't live there but all the rest of 'em you know they well i'll go home and they're always doing something together you know bringing all of their families and so you 

442.26 450.65 B: you miss that i miss that aspect of it and and not being readily accessible and them not being readily accessible 

450.30 459.26 A: yeah one one great thing is our family reunions on both sides are usually in the same state and lots of times we can coordinate 'em and because of where they 

450.87 451.81 B: (( to me )) 

455.74 456.64 B: oh 

459.14 473.65 A: um where relatives live and everything when we go on our trips we can usually see family on on my husband's side and my side and two different years we were able to do two family reunions one on his side and one on my side the same um week 

473.53 474.94 B: that's great 

473.72 479.03 A: and it worked out and and this year we're doing the same thing we're going to a camping reunion up in utah 

479.08 480.14 B: mhm 

479.10 485.08 A: in the beautiful mountains up there and and then we've got my mother's seventieth birthday re- um party 

485.16 497.97 A: and it's actually the r- the day we stop the reunion we start the party for my mother so we're doing it all and it's about the same area and it's usually kind of a central area to but we have to drive 

485.42 486.34 B: (( oh )) 

489.92 490.88 B: cool 

493.16 493.95 B: (( cool )) 

496.39 497.33 B: mhm 

497.93 500.66 A: oh you know five hundred 

500.73 502.33 A: about five hundred six 

502.44 507.83 A: six hundred miles to get up there but my mother lives um 

507.93 514.62 A: four hundred miles away so we usually stay with her even if we're going up to the reunions on the my husband's side of the family and we're 

509.56 510.38 B: wow 

512.61 513.61 B: mhm 

514.07 514.99 B: (( mhm )) 

514.80 515.62 A: so 

515.77 523.20 A: my husband gets twenty one days off but he doesn't usually take that many [laughter] he can't afford to take that many but at least we get to travel and 

519.52 520.43 B: oh 

520.95 521.56 B: (( yeah )) 

523.32 535.72 A: [lipsmack] and i just well th- the older i get too i mean you don't appreciate your mother as much as until you get married and have your own children and so when something like a big disaster happens you really 

529.22 530.46 B: right 

530.91 532.00 B: mhm 

535.81 540.32 A: you know your prioritize and you really realize what's really important 

537.73 538.64 B: right 

539.68 542.66 B: mhm and that's and you realize how 

540.36 544.86 A: and and that is your loved ones you know that's what's so important
