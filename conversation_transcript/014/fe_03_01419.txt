22.62 25.27 B: uh you mean cautious in your town 

25.05 30.11 A: yeah oh everywhere i'm you know looking over my shoulder and we live close to an air force base 

30.12 32.57 A: and we hear a lot of planes going over 

32.75 34.36 B: are you in a big city 

34.12 41.04 A: no we're in a rural area but we live um right next door to an air force base and all the planes fly over 

41.75 44.50 B: and and you would be afraid of what 

44.75 48.66 A: i don't know it's just you know since that happened um 

49.23 51.76 A: it it just seems like um 

52.28 61.53 A: you know the kids are more aware of it and they're um asking me more so you know we just lock our doors and um 

61.82 65.43 A: you know we have a plan of where we would go if something would happen 

66.18 67.95 A: we don't know what would happen though 

67.85 69.71 B: [laughter] 

68.41 71.12 A: you know have you made any changes 

70.57 71.91 B: well you know 

72.45 77.57 B: i have a lot of family that live abroad and um when september eleventh 

77.53 85.28 B: actually happened that day and the day after i got a lot of calls what's going on because their their news wasn't as up to date as ours 

85.21 96.26 B: what's going on what happened what do ya know those kinds of things and um aren't you afraid and um we live in connecticut which is pretty close to new york 

96.13 98.22 A: mhm very close right 

97.15 98.82 B: [laughter] and um 

98.85 110.75 B: we have a a submarine base in the state and we have uh nuclear power plants in the state and all those things come to your mind just as you were saying you live near a an air force base 

110.80 119.64 B: um and a lot of the questions that i got from people who live in other countries made me think should i be doing something different 

119.27 131.42 A: yeah my husband works at a um air separation plant and that would have it's highly explosive so that would have been one of their first targets you know after the after the base when they started going for the middle sized businesses 

131.40 136.39 B: i think i think shortly after september eleventh i i was more 

136.92 141.21 B: apprehensive than i am now since then i've traveled abroad twice 

140.84 141.82 A: you have 

141.56 143.90 B: oh yes um 

142.11 143.10 A: okay 

143.23 147.47 A: you know i would never do that that's why it's changed me we haven't went on vacation 

147.29 149.71 B: oh see i keep thinking 

150.17 154.48 B: well we traveled to south america and i can't imagine any terrorist 

155.22 157.01 B: thinking that they're going to get 

157.06 158.07 B: big 

158.64 165.27 B: letters in a newspapers or the eleven o'clock news from blowing up a plane that's going to brazil you know [laughter] 

165.09 166.26 A: yeah 

165.48 172.61 B: i think they're gonna try for a plane that's going to rome or to london or uh you know if they inter- or they're going to blow j._f._k. 

172.63 173.85 B: um 

173.57 177.54 A: yeah they're gon- you think they'll do something big like the tow- like the twin tower 

176.22 180.03 B: exactly like like the twin towers i think i think that 

180.10 184.34 B: for a terrorist no matter where the terrorist is from to try and 

185.27 189.41 B: pinpoint something that i'm doing i'd have to be awfully unlucky 

189.65 190.68 A: yeah 

189.98 191.41 B: (( [laughter] you know )) 

191.24 193.07 A: yeah 

192.06 203.01 B: and i i think i'm in as much danger as of that happening as when i cross the street and i live in a in a suburban area i i just don't think they're going to blow up my normal stop and shop 

203.42 206.12 A: yeah i don't know why but i do i feel like 

205.57 210.55 B: i think maybe because you have kids and and that gives you something more to worry about i don't have 

209.45 220.31 A: yeah they're all teenagers and preteens and you know they talk about it in school all the time and they have the kids news on and announce it every day and the kids come home my mom works at the base 

215.01 217.92 B: (( kids )) 

220.88 223.81 A: so i guess you know she's telling us a little bit 

223.86 226.79 A: and that makes them worry more so it makes me worry more 

226.23 236.08 B: well kids excited i i was a a high school and college teacher until i retired and kids get excited very easily and there's also that 

236.03 242.87 B: that the kid next to me is excited so i should be excited so the next kid gonna be excited they all get excited together and it's they enjoy that 

242.21 243.30 A: right 

242.98 244.18 B: (( uh )) 

244.30 247.99 B: but i think it's it's the adult job to calm them down 

247.53 252.35 A: yeah that's what i'm doing but i'm i'm not going to take any chances [laughter] 

251.69 261.25 B: no and i don't i'm i'm certainly not saying that anybody should take any chances and there's absolutely no way that you could give me a trip to egypt [laughter] not going to happen i won't go to israel either 

252.47 253.60 A: (( either or )) 

257.40 259.39 A: yeah [laughter] 

260.64 262.10 A: right 

261.28 269.77 B: nor you know that kind of a thing there's not not not a way on god's green earth but i would think probably twice about going to some parts of europe 

269.04 270.03 A: (( mhm )) 

269.95 271.07 B: um 

271.85 282.17 B: i i don't enjoy going to new york anymore so that's [laughter] but i don't i don't i don't know whether uh uh we've really changed anything that we do 

275.72 276.75 A: (( yes )) 

282.75 295.27 A: yeah i mean we haven't really changed anything too that we do it's more the way we think and act i guess you know we just we watch out more and i always make sure the doors are locked and so- that somebody knows where we are 

293.73 296.68 B: but before september eleventh didn't you lock your doors 

297.63 298.52 A: no 

298.44 303.89 B: you didn't wow you live in a wonderful area i've never not locked my doors [laughter] 

299.16 300.41 A: no we 

301.14 302.37 A: yeah 

303.58 310.55 A: yeah there's no crime here or anything you know we're out in the country and um we never had to worry about anything 

310.78 318.00 A: but you know now you know if i'm going to the store i you know i guess i do i have changed a little bit i tell my husband where i'm going you 

310.83 311.64 B: (( ooh )) 

318.11 321.43 A: know i'm going to this crocker's or that one 

320.56 322.00 B: sure yeah 

321.71 324.07 A: you know instead of just i'm going to the store 

323.68 330.36 B: well i think that's just good you know 'cause uh anything could happen and it doesn't have to be anything to do with terrorism 

330.05 335.19 A: yeah well we always have our cell phones you know we always have but um 

334.24 335.75 B: and i turned mine in 

335.90 337.53 A: you've turned yours in [mn]

339.61 341.67 A: i need mine for the kids you know 

340.67 346.16 B: see yeah i think that's the difference in our focuses i think that's it right there oh 

343.85 344.80 A: yeah 

344.97 346.92 A: because of the kids right 

346.46 348.38 B: and you're probably younger than i am 

348.75 350.68 A: i don't know [laughter] 

349.71 351.76 B: well i'm i'm in my fifties 

351.43 353.31 A: yeah i'm in my thirties 

353.11 356.70 B: so there's there's a different focus right there 

356.02 358.03 A: yeah that's right 

357.43 361.29 B: um i i'll tell ya i had a um my 

358.22 359.39 A: and 

361.80 363.15 B: my first cousin 

363.18 367.39 B: and his son both worked at the world trade center 

367.65 369.45 A: oh my gosh 

368.96 374.87 B: and uh that day it was all i could do to keep from calling my aunt to find out what was going on with them 

373.68 376.23 A: they weren't tell me they weren't there 

375.66 382.05 B: well i cal- i finally i got to six o'clock in the afternoon and then i just had to call 'cause nobody called me and i had to know 

382.14 390.64 B: come to find out my cousin had his office had move uh i think six months prior to that and was no longer in the world trade center 

390.23 391.57 A: good 

390.98 392.76 B: and his son 

392.92 397.84 B: worked on the eighty fourth floor don't ask me which tower i don't know um 

397.88 399.45 B: had a day off that day 

399.65 401.92 A: wow that you're family was lucky 

401.67 409.18 B: oh very lucky very very lucky that kid got himself a new birthday as far as i'm concerned and it's september eleventh um 

402.67 403.58 A: yeah 

406.01 407.10 A: yeah 

407.91 409.06 A: right 

409.42 411.83 B: but you know that's how close it got 

412.61 414.70 A: yeah that's very close 

412.71 418.74 B: to us and i still i still don't think that we've done 

418.84 420.41 B: big changes 

420.72 423.22 B: in in anything that we do 

423.42 424.17 A: oh 

423.47 428.88 B: there's things that i would never had done i don't think even before september eleventh i would have been too infatuated with a trip 

429.05 431.75 B: to uh egypt or israel you know or 

431.09 432.46 A: yeah 

432.21 433.74 B: world i i 

432.60 437.90 A: yeah well you know we're not in a position where we could take those trips right now but 

436.75 439.87 B: well i my premise was if somebody gave it to me i wouldn't take it 

439.73 445.25 A: yeah that's how mine too if somebody gave it to me i wouldn't take it now i probably would have then maybe though 

440.29 441.11 B: [laughter] 

444.87 447.95 B: really now see that's that's we're different again 

445.43 448.96 A: yeah i would have gone to israel then 

449.66 457.59 B: uh they're they're places i'd love to see but they're not top on my list you know but i don't think that has anything to do with september eleventh 

453.18 454.70 A: (( but yeah )) 

454.79 455.49 A: yeah 

457.90 460.08 B: um fascinating isn't it 

460.11 461.44 B: (( what do your kids say )) 

461.63 465.21 A: what did my kids say they're just you know they mo- they're just more 

462.67 463.78 B: (( yeah )) 

465.69 468.77 A: you know all the kids at school are exaggerating and everything 

468.88 470.54 A: and um 

471.30 475.39 A: combined with the you know they're thinking well you know will come in 

475.47 476.43 B: oh dear 

475.99 480.67 A: and you know just stuff like that they're they're not as bad as they were i mean 

480.78 483.68 A: after i'd say maybe for six months they were 

483.71 485.71 A: more fearful and everything 

486.21 490.65 A: you know like i called the school recently and i said if there is a level three 

490.77 496.00 A: this is the thursday before spring break i said if there's a level three emergency in our county 

496.32 501.61 A: they're saying on the news not to leave your homes i said so what would happen if um 

501.72 515.74 A: you know a level three happens during school hours and you know the principal said well i don't i don't know i'll do what the board says so so i called the board and i asked the board the same question and they said well you know we don't know 

515.52 517.07 B: oh jeeze 

515.90 518.92 A: i said well have a meeting on that and call me back tomorrow 

518.85 520.13 B: oh that's awful 

520.07 526.27 A: so i mean it's it makes you think well if they're not prepared you know i've got to be prepared 

526.20 527.05 B: yes 

526.69 529.60 A: you know and then i told the kids you know where to go 

530.25 532.63 A: i mean i always know where they're at every minute 

532.51 539.81 B: [laughter] you think you do [laughter] oh then you're lucky you're very lucky 

533.29 534.23 A: (( oh )) 

534.75 537.83 A: i do they're they're not driving yet so 

539.53 543.40 A: right but you know it's just like we have a plan to go 

543.49 546.99 A: even farther north up to my mom's she has a cabin 

547.30 548.53 A: and uh 

547.92 549.42 B: well we're you located 

549.52 551.73 A: we're um in medway ohio 

551.84 553.80 B: oh you're midwest okay 

552.97 554.40 A: yeah yeah 

554.69 563.10 A: it's about a half an hour north of dayton and then about an hour north of here is a lake you know my mom has a cabin there so we're just going to meet up there and it's gonna be 

563.28 568.71 B: that's a good choice because like i said i don't think my stop and shop is going to get blown up and i don't think that 

568.87 570.77 B: in the middle of the midwest 

570.79 572.50 B: you're going to get blown up either 

572.01 574.92 A: yeah other than we live about two miles from 

575.23 581.35 B: yeah oh yeah yeah the only thing that concerns me a little bit is there's a lot of crazies out there 

576.30 577.73 A: you know and 

581.44 584.88 B: uh and 

582.84 586.95 A: like um people that wanna just act that just to get attention 

585.64 590.07 B: exactly that that concerns me more than than some terrorist 

587.79 589.52 A: that does concern me too 

590.13 592.35 A: yeah that concerns me too 

591.69 599.89 B: i i i can see some crazy person thinking he's gonna make a big splash by dumping i don't know what in my water supply
