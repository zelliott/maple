2.93 4.18 A: how are you today 

3.99 5.10 B: good and you 

5.01 11.00 A: not bad so uh first of all i guess where were you when you first heard about the terrorist attacks 

10.94 12.55 B: i was sleeping 

12.39 13.29 A: [laughter] 

13.21 17.53 B: my sister came down and woke me up saying that a plane had just flew into a building 

17.54 20.15 A: and what was your first reaction to that 

20.94 24.08 B: like whoa what the hell is the pilot thinking [laughter] 

23.39 36.50 A: [laughter] i though it was an accident myself i had really no idea what was going on i was sitting in my first period class i was a senior at the time and the principal came over the loudspeaker and said well you know 

37.08 44.49 A: we've been attacked and the whole class kind of just silent we had really no idea and we watched the t._v. the rest of the day 

45.77 48.69 A: uh i haven't really made any changes though 

49.00 50.42 A: i'm not sure why 

50.57 52.40 A: for a while i was kind of scared 

52.69 57.32 A: i didn't really know what else was gonna happen if they had anything else planned 

58.77 61.31 B: i just sat glued to the t._v. all day long 

62.80 68.64 B: watching everything unfold on there i haven't made any changes either i'm still going to live my life the same way 

68.37 71.33 A: yeah i figure unless it hits closer to home 

71.56 76.14 A: i don't really know what i can do i haven't bought duck tape or anything 

76.52 79.33 B: no i won't buy duck tape [laughter] 

78.14 81.38 A: [laughter] i'm sure if that would work anyway 

81.59 83.25 A: taping it up to the doors 

83.35 85.06 A: i don't really know 

85.62 86.75 B: i think 

86.94 90.72 B: if it's a chemical bomb tape and plastic aren't going to do crap 

90.75 95.50 A: i think it'll probably seep in any little crack it can get into and that's it [laughter] 

94.34 97.94 B: well exactly because you have your your 

98.30 101.13 B: heater system and that that goes outside anyway 

100.72 102.18 A: mhm [laughter] 

104.37 106.25 B: (( we're supposed to talk for ten minutes [laughter] [laughter] )) 

105.62 108.16 A: yes ten minutes [laughter] 

108.54 110.50 A: well let's see uh 

111.48 113.96 A: and i don't like how they would always play 

114.26 122.37 A: the buildings falling over and over and over i kinda it was really disturbing to me to watch that 

120.06 124.38 B: i think i think it kind of desensitized everybody after a while 

123.68 128.10 A: yeah i think so too like the first time i think i saw it live actually 

128.17 133.63 A: when it was actually happening i saw it and that was wow that really got me 

133.46 139.59 B: yeah i was sitting here with my sister and my uncle watching trying to figure out what was going on who did what 

139.37 140.75 A: mhm 

140.37 145.11 B: and then all of a sudden they started talking about the pentagon and and 

144.04 145.53 A: mhm 

145.13 152.24 B: and talking about now the buildings are falling and the other plane going down in pennsylvania 

151.83 154.13 A: on it's way to the white house [laughter] 

154.60 157.25 A: wow it was it was bad 

156.76 161.94 B: i just thought they could if they already went to ohio they got as far as ohio they could have easily have hit 

161.95 163.27 B: the sears tower 

162.90 168.63 A: mhm i thought that would actually have been a good target and i was afraid that they were heading that way 

168.46 171.13 B: well i'm right near there so [laughter] 

170.38 171.45 A: right 

172.08 173.28 A: um 

177.00 187.67 A: well we can only have two minutes ssilence according to the instructions [laughter] well let's see where i can go with this i was surprised it was so well planned though 

179.72 180.98 B: oh that's what it said 

181.82 183.82 B: (( [laughter] )) 

187.70 189.78 A: on like such a large scale 

190.06 195.65 A: especially when the other things started happening all on the same day it was i don't know it was very intimidating 

195.71 198.28 A: kind of put us in a bad position as a country 

199.33 202.83 B: well exactly seeing as how we're supposed to have such great security 

202.24 212.77 A: mhm and then they slip into an airport which is supposed to have the hig- some of the highest security measures in the entire country as far as getting stuff onto the plane 

212.62 213.90 B: exactly 

214.60 216.12 B: (( [cough] )) 

216.05 218.88 A: it was well it was like plastic 

219.01 226.01 A: it was hidden in plastic or something it was so thick that it didn't even go through the metal detectors and they didn't set it off 

225.39 226.74 B: what was 

226.50 227.83 A: (( their weapons )) 

227.53 228.84 B: oh okay 

229.25 236.83 A: and that was surprising even then i read the article in newsweek they did some really good coverage on it i don't know if you read those articles 

236.23 237.59 B: no i didn't 

237.48 243.38 A: uh they us- went pretty in depth and they had the families and then there were a couple of survivors too that they 

243.41 255.95 A: got interviews from and that was pretty touching this one guy was way up top and he managed to get down and people helped him along the way and they died and you know it was just it was a touching article too 

256.01 264.16 B: they had some stuff like that in people where there was a handicapped woman and two guys just carried her down ninety flights of stairs 

263.70 265.04 A: oh my gosh 

264.91 271.26 B: and there was another guy gus they were saying he had um he had just had an uh surgery done 

271.30 272.78 B: on his 

272.65 287.53 B: i can't think of what it's called probably the back of your leg area by your ankle so he couldn't really do anything so when he was i don't know if he was actually in the building or just around the building when he would start to run his stitches were breaking open and he was bleeding 

275.78 276.84 A: mhm 

287.30 288.48 A: (( ouch )) 

288.41 292.84 B: and so he he made it into a store where they helped him there 

295.31 302.72 A: then again i think this whole thing really shows the strength of people to bond together to 

302.90 312.24 A: it really impressed me how everyone just came together and it didn't matter what race you were your orientation or anything like that we all just united 

311.66 313.04 B: exactly 

312.25 313.90 A: against it 

314.10 316.01 B: (( yeah there was some )) 

316.44 319.65 B: racism then towards islamic people 

318.99 321.97 A: oh yeah that did trigger a really bad one 

319.73 321.49 B: middle eastern then 

321.78 324.16 B: then it started hitting really bad 

324.56 326.64 B: where they were bombing over here 

326.13 327.06 A: mhm 

327.95 329.32 B: the mosques 

329.66 335.28 A: but i guess i guess it's something that we have some urge to do something i don't know 

337.41 339.45 A: oh okay let's see 

339.32 342.21 B: are we only allowed to talk about nine eleven [laughter] 

347.02 348.53 B: have you fl- um 

348.54 349.99 B: travelled since then 

350.16 353.19 A: yes i went down to atlanta over 

353.37 361.81 A: independence day and that was really tight security i had to get there about four hours earlier than i normally would have but the flight itself was smooth 

362.50 367.81 B: so that was almost independence okay so that fourth of july after the attacks 

367.20 368.94 A: right 

367.88 370.03 B: okay my mom had travelled 

370.31 371.76 B: two weeks after 

372.35 376.43 A: okay that would have been i don't know if i would have done that myself [laughter] mm 

375.68 384.19 B: yeah she had already made plans and her her flight i think it was two week yeah at the beginning of sept- at the beginning of october then 

384.22 386.78 B: and she went out of the country she went to cancun 

387.63 390.45 B: and she said not really it wasn't that bad 

391.00 392.95 B: the only thing was 

393.04 395.44 B: having to get there so damn early 

395.05 396.07 A: right 

395.71 398.74 B: that was the only problem other than that she said it was 

399.40 400.47 B: like normal 

400.53 403.51 A: so no extensive searches or anything 

402.94 411.11 B: no but i think now that i think about it i think they're going back to how security used to be in the airports where you couldn't go past a certain point 

410.86 413.12 A: yeah they did that on the one i flew out of 

413.06 414.19 B: oh 'cause when 

414.36 417.18 B: let me see my grandmother flew to vegas 

418.07 420.81 B: this would have had to have been in ninety two ninety one 

420.82 424.28 B: we were not allowed past the metal detectors 

423.68 429.02 A: right and my mom for example couldn't come greet me either she had to wait outside the gate 

430.40 434.96 A: so i guess that's a pretty smart move as far as ticket holders only 

435.71 439.48 A: although it was the ticket holders that had the weapons in the first place 

439.31 441.89 B: well exactly they got the tickets 

442.89 445.51 A: (( and that was the scary part )) 

444.50 447.07 B: they learned to fly from the u._s. 

447.15 451.98 A: yep i read about that after a couple of weeks and that was oh my gosh 

449.64 450.32 B: oh 

450.36 453.44 B: we taught osama bin laden everything he knows 

452.81 454.36 A: pretty much [laughter] 

454.34 455.49 B: (( [laughter] )) 

454.42 455.63 A: and wow 

455.86 457.89 B: we helped them out [laughter] 

457.27 458.85 A: mhm 

463.51 465.41 B: ten minutes ten minutes right 

464.93 468.63 A: yes ten minutes talking for at least eight [laughter] 

465.81 466.92 B: ten minutes 

468.47 471.46 B: i don't know i should get a little though [laughter] [noise] 

470.72 471.73 A: (( [laughter] i )) 

472.01 474.50 A: think we're doing pretty well so far 

477.40 479.11 B: we talked about that already 

482.48 484.73 A: okay let's see uh 

487.56 493.16 A: did your i don't know if you were in high school or college when this happened um

497.26 501.42 A: did your workplace do anything special any commemorations 

500.71 502.83 B: i wasn't working at the time either 

502.22 503.18 A: okay

511.61 517.80 A: yeah my school did a thing because i was a senior and we all wore buttons and in a way i thought it was 

517.60 527.59 A: kinda just jumping on the bandwagon and that kind of got on my nerves after a while just the patriotism thing it was never big until this happened and then all of a sudden 

527.61 530.68 A: everyone's jumping on this patriotism bandwagon 

531.28 532.46 A: and it kinda got 

532.63 534.92 A: irritating i guess after a while 

536.53 537.57 B: (( [noise] wow )) 

541.11 544.08 B: the only thing i really saw with anything 

544.95 548.88 B: mem- commemorating was the real world chicago

566.61 570.25 B: other than that i didn't see nothing else except for the flags at half staff 

570.20 575.43 A: mhm right and that's i that's a pretty good tribute right there just everyone doing that 

575.17 576.40 B: exactly 

580.18 586.92 B: so did you hear did you read anything about the black box from the pennsylvania flight 

586.55 588.98 A: no i didn't get a chance to do that did you 

588.54 598.85 B: yeah people magazine had a whole thing where they give the you know exactly what happened just about because they talked to the loved ones because they those were the only ones who were really allowed to hear it
