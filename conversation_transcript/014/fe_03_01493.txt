497.95 508.63 A: and you know of course i have a mall right almost around the corner from me so i kinda thought about it i think you know that kind of thing passes your mind but i don't dwell on it too much mhm 

503.27 504.24 B: yeah 

506.15 507.25 B: well if you're well 

507.88 511.15 B: if you're right in the city i think it's very different um

515.90 522.02 B: um city life is very different from the suburbs i think i would be much more 

522.44 524.04 A: concerned mhm 

522.55 533.37 B: i think i would be much more wary if i were in a big city because a big city has lots of lots of different people lots i think percentages right there start playing into a 

524.10 525.06 A: yeah 

530.91 532.79 A: mhm right right
