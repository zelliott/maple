243.47 255.75 A: [noise] yes i i can i can and it's not it's not that w- what use you say it's not the things you can see i think the the september eleven make a very huge impact on economic 

255.79 257.33 B: economics uh-huh 

256.60 260.81 A: yeah and then it's because economy is something like 

260.84 268.31 A: well you you don't see it like one one dollar two dollars three dollars but it make a indirect impact in our life 

266.90 270.06 B: mhm on the stock market and everything too 

269.45 283.75 A: yeah and everybody well since right now everybody's uh welfare [mn] what shall i say wealth of the family is most of them have some kind of investment four one k. or i. i. or something 

270.07 271.58 B: 'cause it was down 

280.74 282.15 B: yes uh-huh 

283.13 285.19 B: sure mhm

288.08 289.86 B: right right 

289.93 294.00 B: well like you say a dollar here a dollar there and the gas prices have gone up too 

293.24 296.07 A: (( [laughter] yeah like gas prices okay )) 

295.02 299.56 B: yeah so we're paying a lot more than we paid right before september eleventh 

299.09 309.37 A: i think so and the other day i was reading a um business article from uh business magazine and [cough] it was talking about how the bush 

300.33 301.30 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

309.29 323.45 A: our government raised war with the you know middle east and and how it's going to impact global economy because of the cost of doing business when uh you will have more security more this more that 

313.02 314.05 B: uh-huh 

323.52 326.27 A: and i was reading that article i was thinking oh 

326.68 329.02 A: it the timing seems to be wrong 

329.25 332.90 A: it's not because of this recent war i think 

332.96 337.60 A: that all this cost were not go went back to september eleventh 

337.74 343.83 A: it doesn't start right now the global unstabilization didn't start right this moment
