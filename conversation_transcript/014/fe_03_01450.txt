0.00 3.04 B: hi my name is jeanette and i'm from minnesota 

3.15 4.55 B: who am i talking to 

3.97 6.51 A: hi my name is linda and i'm from denver 

6.30 7.60 B: oh hi linda 

7.19 8.52 A: hi [laughter] 

7.92 10.24 B: have you done any of these calls before 

9.75 10.80 A: just one 

10.48 19.81 B: okay this is my third call [laughter] i was so surprised they're just coming one right after the other and it's re- yeah i just signed up yesterday and i got three calls today 

12.14 13.11 A: (( okay )) 

15.25 16.43 A: oh today 

16.93 17.74 A: oh 

19.43 20.58 A: (( wow )) 

20.06 28.46 B: so this is just interesting um i guess we're supposed to discuss uh any personal changes that we've gone through since nine one one 

28.17 29.36 A: mhm 

28.62 30.99 B: would you like to start or would you like me to 

30.89 33.00 A: um sure you can [laughter] 

32.01 44.23 B: okay um i think basically we haven't really made very many changes at all um i i was telling the other callers that my husband was reluctant at first to fly 

44.38 53.22 B: because he does have to travel for his job where he wasn't really looking forward to it but once he actually stepped foot in the airport 

47.12 48.24 A: mhm 

53.19 62.30 B: and saw all the security measures that were in place and saw the armed personnel that were there and the marshalls that were on board 

62.50 71.17 B: it it just kinda left him and he felt very safe and and very protected i guess and just put himself at ease and just continued on 

68.13 69.12 A: mhm 

71.22 79.99 B: as normal um i i i really can't think of anything that we have done differently other than perhaps 

80.24 87.53 B: i think we've been more caring and sharing with our time with friends and families and even strangers 

83.77 84.49 A: (( mm )) 

87.22 88.18 A: mhm 

87.82 90.48 B: as a result of nine one one but 

90.64 94.21 B: making personal changes i i don't think it's really 

94.31 100.90 B: impacted us enough to to change negatively maybe for the better positively but 

100.97 102.14 B: how about you 

102.68 103.75 A: um 

103.78 111.02 A: i think a lot along the same lines as you [laughter] my husband works for the airlines so um 

111.19 115.31 A: we uh you know we were trying to encourage people to fly 

115.12 116.19 B: sure 

115.66 117.08 A: (( so that 'cause )) 

117.43 122.84 A: he works for united and you know they're in a world of hurt right now and [laughter] um 

123.40 124.60 A: but uh 

124.65 126.96 A: i think um 

128.05 137.07 A: another i mean we did fly right after um and it was an eerie feeling in the airports you know when they were you know not very full and stuff like that 

136.70 137.85 B: oh i can imagine 

137.16 139.55 A: um but let's see 

141.33 144.14 A: uh what have we done that's different 

144.47 145.61 A: um 

145.64 148.34 B: how about your do you have children in school 

148.61 151.79 A: uh they're one in preschool and one that's two 

151.63 153.86 B: okay so that you haven't uh 

153.65 156.06 A: we didn't have to explain it to them 

153.82 162.40 B: how do you they're too young i suppose for have been affected by that yeah i was i was curious as to how other people were handling 

162.28 169.41 B: the stress that their children might have gone through and my children are are grown and on their own um 

164.86 166.23 A: mhm 

168.55 169.67 A: mhm 

169.36 182.86 B: you know i think a lot of it might depend upon where in the country a person lives and how personally they were affected by the by the tragedy i mean i i think everybody is carrying the burden of what happened in their heart 

178.35 179.53 A: right 

182.52 183.55 A: mhm 

183.24 190.82 B: but i don't personally know anyone personally that that perished or was hurt in in what happened 

190.65 191.51 A: right 

190.87 200.84 B: and here in the the farmland in minnesota we seem almost kind of removed and yet it it really is still there in in the background because 

196.24 197.12 A: mhm 

200.69 207.14 B: i was telling another caller that um we're in the twenty five mile zone of a nuclear power plant 

206.78 207.55 A: oh 

207.37 215.00 B: and we know that they've increased the security there and they've discontinued uh tours 

211.22 212.33 A: mhm 

215.09 223.40 B: and they have um they had national guard guardsmen there and now they have local police that have been assigned twenty four hours a day to it 

221.68 222.53 A: mhm 

223.75 228.04 B: but you think out in the country nobody's going to bother you or nothing's going to happen 

227.75 228.73 A: right 

228.49 236.51 B: but in our local paper i was reading how farmers are supposed to be vigilant and on the watch 

236.38 248.16 B: for terrorists who might yeah bio terrorists you know i mean they could come in and and poison crops or or harm the the cattle that and nobody would know until it goes to market 

237.84 239.28 A: oh because of the 

240.59 241.76 A: (( oh )) 

243.48 244.51 A: mhm 

247.95 249.29 A: mhm 

248.50 252.73 B: and and they wouldn't even be tested for you know so many things 

252.29 253.28 A: yeah 

252.84 260.13 B: and it just i mean it boggles the mind that i don't know i guess the way i feel is if your time is up your time is up 

259.61 261.23 A: right [laughter] 

260.20 263.19 B: you just have to live your life to the fullest and not 

262.38 267.40 A: i think we we think very similarly [laughter] because yeah 

264.94 268.55 B: [laughter] well i what else can you do you know 

267.52 270.11 A: exactly exactly if i 

270.23 275.53 A: you know i got to the point where i could not watch it on t._v. and i was you know angry that 

275.98 283.32 A: everything was just [sigh] um you know mourning mourning mourning you know it just uh you know the sadness and 

283.70 298.42 A: you know and i kind of agreed with mayor giuliani that you need to get back to your life you know and you need to you know um but it just seemed like it was just i mean it was a huge tragedy i'm not trying to discount that but um at the same time 

287.62 288.63 B: yeah 

298.94 299.95 A: uh 

300.00 311.91 A: you know out here in denver half an hour away from columbine when that happened and we were here um you know it it it's the same thing i you don't think anything's going to happen out here and then that happened and so 

310.25 311.03 B: yeah 

312.57 314.62 A: (( i don't know um [sigh] )) 

314.20 318.95 B: it just seems like one thing after another and and maybe some people are just 

319.03 324.26 B: saying enough you know they just don't even want to think about it or or maybe we're just de- 

321.96 323.03 A: mhm 

324.29 329.04 B: so optimistic we keep thinking that things are always going to be better for us 

328.76 329.69 A: right 

329.35 334.20 B: i don't know it it's just so strange to know that this is even going on and 

334.23 336.60 B: i know life will never be the same again 

336.44 337.36 A: yeah 

336.82 342.26 B: for our generation and and for those you know li- like your kids growing up 

341.81 342.81 A: mhm 

342.51 348.60 B: i don't think they'll ever have that innocence like i had when i was growing up and that's a shame that that 

346.27 347.15 A: yeah 

347.72 357.00 A: i think o- actually one thing i mean just you know working for the hi- him my husband working for the airlines i think we've become way more conservative in our spending 

356.80 357.94 B: mhm 

357.42 361.41 A: you know be- since sept- september eleventh because um 

361.42 368.93 A: his industry was affected so dramatically um i mean it you could you know save all the money in the world and still [laughter] the world could end 

368.07 370.23 B: oh absolutely it 

370.02 371.62 A: [laughter] 

370.65 374.72 B: it's had a tremendous impact all the way across the world i think 

374.30 386.79 A: yeah i think that it just uh people aren't as materialistic and i think it actually brought people back into church because i noticed right after you know churches that would have 

374.89 375.73 B: um 

378.32 379.70 B: yeah 

387.07 394.48 A: half full parking lots on sundays suddenly you know there's hardly any parking and people are parking on the street and you know i think that um 

394.95 397.98 A: it brought people back to some people back to religion 

397.77 403.60 B: yes i i that's a good valid point you know i hadn't even thought of that but i think you're right 

400.07 401.23 A: mhm 

403.66 409.71 B: um and and i think that that goes hand in hand with like the patriotism we're all experiencing 

408.21 409.28 A: right 

409.71 421.57 B: um so many people wouldn't have even thought about flying the flag and yet everywhere you look you see a flag now we've got a neighbor [laughter] down the road who painted a great big flag on their garage 

416.58 417.43 A: right 

421.14 422.34 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

421.72 425.04 B: yeah and he's got a light shining on it twenty fours a day 

424.60 425.60 A: wow 

425.64 431.25 B: and it was even made the newspaper which [laughter] goes to show you what a small place we live out here [laughter] 

431.76 433.67 A: [laughter] yeah 

432.61 444.26 B: but um i i could imagine how this has really affected the airline industry i um i know that uh we've got lots of frequent flier miles and it's going to be difficult to even 

438.37 439.34 A: yeah 

444.18 451.09 B: try to get a flight where i could go out with my husband 'cause they're all they're cutting back so many flights and and um 

449.73 451.90 A: right and especially 

451.12 453.13 B: packing them in like sardines 

452.94 456.45 A: yeah yeah and then people like employees 

456.53 460.66 A: you know say how can they not be making money when we can't even get on a flight you know they're 

460.04 461.66 B: (( oh yes yeah )) 

461.03 464.30 A: [laughter] all the flights seem full to us 

464.70 478.89 A: [laughter] and then we also you know we also think that uh they're using september eleven as a as an excuse to make a lot of changes and we don't always agree with that but um you know they'll say everything was because of september eleventh when 

478.89 481.24 A: we know some things were just for management 

481.18 486.47 B: well sure and that's a shame you know that when they start using a tragedy as an excuse 

483.21 484.31 A: [laughter] 

484.95 490.01 A: exactly exactly and uh this particular airline is uh 

490.48 491.89 A: pretty um 

493.43 494.31 A: pretty 

494.37 500.07 A: anyway we know that that's what they're doing [laughter] well how did you hear about this study originally 

497.24 498.18 B: yeah 

499.64 504.80 B: um i belong to an online um refund group it's called r._m._c. 

504.43 505.19 A: (( oh )) 

504.99 507.76 B: it's it's refund makes sense dot com 

507.39 508.27 A: uh-huh 

507.82 514.30 B: and uh we've got a minnesota good deal alert group who uh sent out a notice about this just yesterday 

514.17 515.07 A: (( oh okay )) 

514.69 518.02 B: and i went and signed up for it an- and um 

518.17 526.25 B: yeah i thought it was really fun and easy to do and i thought yeah it'll probably be a month or two before i get a call from them [laughter] and i was just shocked when they called today 

524.36 525.21 A: [laughter] 

526.06 527.10 A: yeah 

526.48 532.23 B: so this has been extremely interesting and informative and i think it's a wonderful project to take part in 

531.95 532.76 A: yeah 

532.45 534.22 B: how did you hear about it 

533.92 536.36 A: um i'm a mystery shopper 

536.37 537.42 B: oh okay 

536.50 541.47 A: an- and i uh heard about it through one of the companies that i work for 

542.16 551.25 A: so um i did my first call about a month ago and i have yeah i haven't been paid for it but um and actually i thought the study was over so 

546.20 547.02 B: oh 

551.43 555.52 A: i i was very surprised to get this call today [laughter] 

555.21 558.92 B: i know i i just like i said i just signed up yesterday 

558.85 572.12 B: and then got an email this morning and then the phone started ringing this afternoon i thought well this is fun [laughter] so i've sent it out a referral to all my friends and you know just trying to get people to sign up and do it because they said this is the 

565.59 566.45 A: (( yeah [laughter] [laughter] )) 

567.98 569.00 A: uh-huh 

572.33 576.89 B: easiest way to make ten dollars and uh certainly is interesting 

573.92 575.57 A: right 

576.60 579.32 A: well my first topic was bioterrorism 

579.10 580.28 B: oh 

580.04 585.34 A: so [laughter] i think i like september eleventh a little better [laughter] 

581.33 583.21 B: well this is this is really 

584.23 587.24 B: yeah i mean this is really quite um 

587.90 592.38 B: interesting topics you know that everybody does have an opinion about that's for sure 

591.97 593.54 A: yeah but 

592.53 597.57 B: i just wish i knew more of what to say as far as changes that we've made um 

597.03 598.04 A: yeah 

597.64 599.95 B: i do know that we have contributed more to
