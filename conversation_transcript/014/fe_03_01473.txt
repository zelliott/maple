1.27 3.55 A: (( [lipsmack] hi tamara starzill )) 

4.18 5.43 B: how are you 

5.12 16.53 A: good how are you doing [laughter] [laughter] well i guess we have to talk about what changes we've made right [laughter] okay you wanna go first or do you want me to 

6.29 7.81 B: (( just fine [laughter] )) 

12.39 13.88 B: yeah yes 

16.47 19.11 B: well one of the changes that uh 

18.23 21.40 A: [noise] [noise] 

19.59 26.86 B: i live near two new nuclear plants and uh and we have five grandchildren 

22.77 25.87 A: oh wow [noise] 

27.10 38.43 B: and we on the water a lot and i mean that's just worries me and i see these small planes still flying in this area uh even yesterday the day before yesterday uh 

29.16 30.16 A: uh-huh 

39.84 45.38 B: light came over you know just putting along [laughter] i says man 

46.08 48.41 B: but other than that i mean well 

48.75 53.37 B: i think that uh they're handling security around the power plants 

53.53 57.31 B: as they should during these times 

54.88 56.19 A: yeah 

56.62 68.05 A: uh-huh wow i haven't [laughter] been near a power plant recently [laughter] we don't we don't live near one but we do fly a lot or i did for work when i was working and then 

68.02 75.31 A: we had a baby six months ago so i don't fly as much but i'd say that since september eleventh my 

76.23 77.21 A: um 

77.34 78.71 A: just being 

78.72 83.40 A: h- like a heightened awareness at the airports and on the airplane 

81.36 82.34 B: (( oh )) 

83.55 86.58 A: and um [lipsmack] so 

86.60 101.46 A: you know i didn't change my flying pattern i still flew a lot but i think it was more of like a heightened awareness and there is one flight in particular i remember that um you know the space that's like right in front of the door for the airplane 

101.31 102.52 B: (( yes [mn] [noise] )) 

101.93 105.80 A: um there's kin- it's like there's an empty area there and um 

105.84 106.93 A: (( a )) 

107.72 109.56 A: a muslim 

109.59 117.56 A: person wanted to pray there and kneel down right in front of the door because that was the only space and the flight attendants let him 

117.96 125.50 A: and i just remember you know just being so aware of that and being very nervous about it you know so 

125.67 133.24 A: i i guess i mean that's that's not really a change i've made in my life but it's a change i've made in my my actions i guess 

133.82 136.28 B: well you are kinda uh 

136.36 138.19 B: weary of uh 

138.95 146.26 B: the i don't know in in the foreign dress kind uh the robes and the things i notice uh well i have uh 

146.34 149.40 B: we have grandchildren that live in virginia 

148.95 149.85 A: uh-huh 

149.58 152.92 B: and we brought 'em down this past spring 

153.55 159.81 B: well not this spring break but last year the spring break on the on the amtrack 

156.35 157.29 A: uh-huh 

159.17 160.07 A: uh-huh 

159.85 168.09 B: and it was several uh i- in the long- longer garbs you know and my grandkids oh they're eight 

165.24 166.83 A: mhm 

168.14 174.35 B: eleven and fourteen you know and they kept staring at the people and kept staring at the people you know and i says 

174.40 180.56 B: well it's nothing to be uh concerned about because they have plenty of security on these things 

179.82 181.71 A: mhm 

181.04 195.19 B: and but uh i think it's a little bit uh blown outta proportion because of the they they heighten these alerts on uh then they lower 'em then they heighten 'em again every time it's a holiday or something 

194.39 196.55 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

195.36 198.07 B: and they well it's a good time but 

198.11 207.35 B: i- i- i- i'm not too concerned about it 'cause we're retired and we do still fly a lot because we have kids on the west coast and in denver 

207.12 208.03 A: uh-huh 

207.67 212.98 B: and i- just flying do- it doesn't bother me that much but the [sigh] 

213.73 217.09 B: it used to i mean right after nine eleven it did 

216.70 217.73 A: right 

217.24 219.41 B: because y- uh 

219.68 221.19 B: you just didn't know 

221.27 226.52 A: yeah yeah you know i can't but i can't say other than other than my 

226.67 233.85 A: awareness of ar- things around me we haven't made any changes in our lives at you know at all 

233.84 247.06 A: and i can't i don't even know if it really you know a lot of people might say that it brought them closer together as family or as friends [laughter] but i don't even know that it did that um [lipsmack] for us uh you know 

240.52 241.41 B: (( but )) 

246.93 256.60 A: i watch the news a little bit more and i'm more aware of current events but i ha- we haven't made any changes it hasn't scared us into 

256.65 259.57 A: locking ourselves in the house [laughter] 

258.51 273.34 B: well [laughter] that's uh where we our children uh we've al- when we've traveled with 'em we've always been well aware then you know uh uh keeping up with them so w- we're not too concerned abouts what's happening around us 

272.81 273.82 A: uh-huh 

273.48 278.10 B: because when nine uh times out of ten you've got w- an eye on one of your 

279.01 282.53 B: children and and so 

279.75 281.69 A: right 

282.93 285.57 B: that concerns us very little 

285.15 286.57 A: yeah 

285.73 288.66 B: but uh it's always 

289.02 291.86 B: bit [sigh] good to be a little bit leary 

291.39 292.47 A: mhm 

292.17 299.87 B: and of your surroundings because of it's not just a terrorist it's uh uh 

299.98 314.24 B: the riffraff now that uh if it's unsafe and we live in the charlotte area and i can't wait each night to see how many people got killed at doing that shot and all that [laughter] and and and and it's just 

312.17 313.77 A: [laughter] 

314.15 315.69 B: it's just uh 

316.83 319.75 B: i don't know it's just the unlawfulness 

319.90 322.72 B: of the people and 

323.29 325.40 A: are you in the are you in the south 

323.33 323.88 B: (( a- ))

339.32 340.71 A: (( oh yeah you're right )) 

342.01 356.57 B: we uh always uh uh feel secure when you see the military and i mean we're surrounded by uh at least [sigh] eight or ten military installations so uh 

346.63 347.62 A: uh-huh 

357.02 365.15 B: w- w- relatively we're safe in in in this area but the only thing at at at 

365.18 366.11 B: (( that has )) 

366.20 368.68 B: bothered me was those uh 

369.31 372.36 B: nuclear power plants that we have close by 

371.90 373.02 A: right 

372.83 376.09 B: and we have uh we live in a radius of uh 

376.77 381.92 B: five miles of one and uh twenty miles of the other one so 

381.97 382.94 B: uh 

384.55 388.14 B: (( uh i we just don't know i don't wanna think of that [cough] )) 

388.22 390.86 B: that concerns me it's like i said it was uh 

391.28 395.50 B: the planes flying over we're supposed to be a no p- fly zone 

395.07 396.52 A: oh really hm

516.87 518.14 B: mhm 

518.66 525.06 A: i notice little things like that that you just kinda stop and you look and you can't help but think and [lipsmack] 

525.75 529.81 A: so you know i always think also you know when they were talking about 

530.17 540.53 A: with um with like biological warfare or you know just hurting our crops like poisoning our food source here in the united states and you know 

536.99 538.16 B: mhm 

541.00 547.59 A: it doesn't stop me from eating obviously but but you can't help it it's always in the back of my mind 

541.39 542.27 B: and 

548.27 551.25 B: well it would hurt our family tremendously because 

551.46 562.89 B: all of the children are vegetarians and their children are vegetarians and i say well that's comes outta the ground you know and they could come by here and spray something on it and all that you know 

554.29 555.23 A: (( oh )) 

556.20 557.14 A: uh-huh 

562.19 563.34 A: uh-huh
