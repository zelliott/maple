95.26 96.32 A: well that's good 

102.33 108.55 A: i saw a thing on the news the other night where they were saying that you know usually the standard used to be twenty minutes a day

108.83 110.18 A: one hour 

109.77 111.58 B: wow oh i 

110.62 112.95 A: it said americans just aren't cutting it 

112.78 123.73 B: oh they and and you would think just the opposite people are much more aware that exercise is good and and look who's talking [laughter] because i just said i don't do as much as i should 

118.84 119.78 A: yeah 

121.65 122.46 A: yeah

147.81 148.58 A: yeah 

151.79 158.13 A: the one thing i notice is that at this university you know it's fifty thousand students here and uh 

153.31 154.59 B: mhm 

158.21 164.31 A: some many students are health conscious that you get good vibes when you go to the gy- it's a recreation center 

160.56 161.56 B: i see 

162.69 163.71 B: (( sure )) 

164.06 165.25 B: yeah 

164.61 168.17 A: and it just surrounded by people that are just health conscious 

167.63 173.22 B: and i guess and it's hoping and accessible times too probably from early morning 

171.93 175.30 A: oh it's open from six o'clock in the morning till eleven at night 

173.70 176.72 B: i see yeah yeah isn't that something 

176.48 182.94 A: and uh so i make it a part of my uh curriculum i mean i mean it's just as important as my studies 

180.55 181.74 B: that's it 

182.42 183.91 B: say good for you 

183.53 185.21 A: so i i go

186.19 193.17 B: say and i have to bend when it comes to that and with all this new stuff around you know 

193.38 195.46 B: i i really should but 

194.89 196.81 A: well yoga is great 

196.20 198.76 B: (( well i try it's not as easy as )) 

197.31 201.51 A: but what you need to do is some cardi- something to get the heart rate pumping 

200.89 203.57 B: that's it that's it that's it and at least you 

202.68 205.24 A: that's the most important muscle in the body 

203.64 207.37 B: mhm that's it that's what they say 

205.80 206.73 A: (( you know )) 

207.64 212.61 A: that's why i do it i don't i don't run very fast or very far but i just get that heart 

210.04 210.95 B: mhm 

211.46 216.58 B: you're not supposed to right like you say you're just supposed to just kinda get it going kinda of thing 

214.99 215.83 A: yeah 

215.91 217.42 A: yeah i'm real slow 

217.24 218.13 B: good 

217.59 218.51 A: (( but uh )) 

218.66 219.66 A: (( i do it )) 

219.86 221.59 A: keep my heart pumping 

221.03 223.05 B: good good and 

222.17 223.48 A: and so how 

223.24 230.03 B: and even you know when you get older that's what you have to do it's i'm forty two 

227.69 228.80 A: (( old are you )) 

229.82 231.41 A: are you overweight 

230.81 236.11 B: um about um probably about five ten pounds overweight so you know 

234.55 236.70 A: yeah that's not too bad 

236.10 246.37 B: no no no no no and i try to watch that it and and it does have something to do with the exercise yeah i watch what i eat yes yes yes yes yes definitely 

240.49 242.37 A: do you watch your diet 

243.43 244.62 A: yeah that's good 

244.91 248.90 A: yeah it's so easy to get out of hand the older you get the harder it's too lose weight 

248.19 250.65 B: sure sure you just get you know 

251.00 261.61 B: yeah when you have the forty hours forty five hours i work retail so it's kinda like you know nonstop days so but as you said i do try to do it several times a week 

257.29 258.19 A: yeah 

261.61 271.53 B: and family as well i do have a thirteen year old overweight child which is something and that's something that i i'm i'm very lax 

266.91 268.81 A: mhm that's hard 

271.41 280.68 B: but it's getting better with her meaning that she does watch much more than she has her whole her whole generation is is not what 

280.59 290.02 B: it should be and as i said they should be much more aware of health nutrition but at the same time they've got fast foods and and you know 

284.26 285.04 A: (( yeah )) 

289.67 293.33 A: that's terrible yeah i know it's real hard on kids 

289.81 295.70 B: that kind of right sure it's all around them and that's it and that's what happens 

295.10 296.38 A: it's so hard 

295.99 297.45 B: truly truly 

296.44 297.26 A: uh-huh 

297.33 306.81 B: but if they get a good early start then it just gets easier and part of the daily routine which it should be you say an hour but i i 

306.69 313.98 B: i hope that one day it'll be twenty minutes even you know before bed or early in the morning and there's that time 

309.82 310.77 A: (( yeah i )) 

312.27 313.64 A: think yeah 

313.81 314.99 A: yeah 

315.14 317.84 B: but it it happens 

317.11 320.79 A: yeah i hate to see the kids that are in that kind of shape 

320.14 322.70 B: see that's what it is and and if they 

321.52 330.15 A: because with boys it's so hard and it's gonna be harder the older they get and they miss out on so many things in life that they have well pick on people and stuff 

324.72 326.00 B: that yeah 

326.96 327.92 B: yeah 

330.28 332.17 B: yeah that's true too 

332.37 341.98 B: absolutely she's she's not tremendously overweight but it's enough that it's a concern to mine and as as they say with health and you know 

342.10 346.91 B: and that kind of thing you know diabetes heart you know all those things that 

347.37 350.64 B: make it harder [laughter] because you're you're 

350.76 355.02 B: genes and what have you too so exercise has to play a part of it 

354.43 356.12 A: yeah 

355.50 356.32 B: but 

357.07 362.81 B: uh what else can we say about exercising and nutrition you know 

363.22 364.13 A: (( well )) 

364.33 368.65 A: i think the two go together just hand in hand you know diet and exercise 

366.12 367.60 B: absolutely 

368.08 370.04 B: absolutely absolutely 

368.97 375.31 A: and to me the three most important things [laughter] are diet exercise and piece of mind 

371.91 372.66 B: (( isn't )) 

374.79 381.22 B: that something i would say and and as you said you've been doing it for a long time now even as a kid too 

379.55 380.57 A: (( yeah the )) 

380.90 390.26 A: the running the weights off and on i i mean i used to lift weights when i was a kid and then i didn't for for a long long time and then i got back into a little bit 

389.93 393.06 B: but do you do the bodybuilding as well or 

392.33 397.54 A: no i don't no my body doesn't seem to be changing much it's been pretty much 

396.13 397.37 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

397.95 406.14 A: the form i developed as an adolescent stayed the same but i just do it because it feels good it's a good complement to running 

405.53 406.46 B: uh-huh 

406.17 407.26 A: to do the 

408.11 411.50 A: weightlifting i don't go for power and a lot of 

408.92 409.73 B: uh-huh 

410.88 415.32 B: oh okay and and treadmill part of your routine too or 

414.75 416.34 A: no 'cause i run 

416.08 416.79 B: ah

418.04 420.57 B: (( ah that too so where do you work out )) 

419.31 421.08 A: that's my transportation 

420.92 433.59 B: where oh you just do it as your transportation save getting in a car or what have you you do take the bike isn't that something you've got the weather down there for it [laughter] that's something but i hear a bostonian accent 

423.25 424.04 A: yeah 

424.96 426.31 A: i don't even have a car 

428.54 429.72 A: oh it's great 

433.08 434.88 A: yeah yeah i'm from boston 

433.66 435.59 B: (( yay [laughter] )) 

434.99 436.25 A: that's right 

436.34 438.52 A: and i've been out for two years 

437.94 439.21 B: (( ah oh )) 

438.84 440.50 A: it's beautiful out here 

439.27 442.13 B: isn't that something i've never been out

443.76 444.85 B: (( wow )) 

444.97 450.05 A: but um i was gonna say uh the diet and the exercise and uh 

451.28 452.26 A: um 

452.90 455.24 A: oh with the oh yeah comp- 

455.58 459.70 A: what i've rea- read a lot about is that weight bearing exercise 

459.65 462.14 B: meaning what what are you what i don't unders- 

461.71 465.12 A: you really like like lifting weights 

463.54 464.40 B: weights 

464.89 466.10 B: right okay 

465.59 467.96 A: it strengthens your bones 

468.01 474.03 B: which would make sense for women who have osteoporosis and yeah surely 

471.14 472.32 A: exactly 

472.45 473.62 A: exactly 

473.68 477.75 A: when you start having problems with you knees and stuff to the contrary you think it's gonna 

478.05 483.62 A: uh hurt your more it actually strengthens you and i think running is kind of a weight bearing exercise 

483.66 484.73 B: it was like 

483.90 486.81 A: you get the full weight of your body in every step 

486.55 487.27 B: (( ha )) 

487.34 490.69 B: we're just talking about well i i just saw a deal 

490.51 502.77 B: in one of the local papers that happened to say six weeks for like twenty nine dollars and i said to my husband boy that's really inexpensive there and he said yeah he happens to know people that work out on a gym 

502.56 505.66 B: so they were talking about he we were talking about a um 

505.50 520.07 B: a trainer and i said it is easier if somebody gives you that you know i wouldn't mind working out with a trainer even though yes you can do it yourself and people are friendly you know trying to teach you the ways to you know or 

512.79 513.70 A: mhm 

515.71 517.04 A: it'd be nice i 

519.94 523.48 B: how to use machines and that kind of thing but 

522.78 527.00 A: yeah it's incentive i see some of the people have private trainings at the gym i go to 

526.77 528.29 B: (( mhm i see right )) 

527.67 528.50 A: uh 

529.55 535.35 A: and they have they have classes now and then or you can get like one training session as a student 

535.56 539.56 A: but uh the price is great i we i play like twenty five dollars for a semester
