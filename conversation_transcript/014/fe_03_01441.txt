276.02 279.36 B: i figure anything can happen anywhere you are right yeah 

278.99 284.28 A: that's exactly right [cough] i think we're th- we probably feel safer than

287.37 289.55 B: yeah yeah 

287.84 288.75 A: feel 

289.13 292.31 A: but hey um you know 

292.62 297.68 A: i'm glad i don't have young children that you know have to be growing up in this world today 

297.25 299.85 B: it it's it's hard i have teenagers 

299.49 300.83 A: yeah 

300.60 305.05 B: and they they're pretty good kids but i know a lot of uh people have trouble 

305.47 308.08 B: with their teenagers and and um

310.32 311.62 A: yeah well 

312.10 313.27 A: yeah well 

313.66 315.05 A: i think it's all 

314.02 318.08 B: my my daughter's going down to washington d._c. uh this summer 

318.17 325.96 B: for a presidential class from scholars program and i was a little concerned about whether to when she first asked whether to let her go to d._c. 

326.17 329.85 B: with new all the other kids you know they're all supervised and everything 

329.59 330.92 A: yeah 

330.36 332.04 B: but um 

331.34 334.24 A: because of because of washington being a 

333.55 342.63 B: well the because being being in d._c. would definitely be a target area if anything were to be happening but then again security is pretty good down there right now 

337.22 338.18 A: (( yeah )) 

339.18 340.08 A: i would 

342.06 350.70 A: yeah like you know people tend to um relax you know when there's when nothing's going on you know when 

343.20 344.21 B: you know 

350.29 355.30 B: yeah but you can't live your life in fear right of what might happen 

350.83 351.81 A: uh 

353.02 354.58 A: no you can't 

355.16 358.43 A: i think washington though with the president being there 

358.30 359.39 B: yeah 

358.49 362.78 A: is is is a lot more secure than say new york city would be 

362.17 362.99 B: (( yes )) 

363.10 370.02 A: so how are they going to pay for all this security you know the taxes um you know they're 

366.39 367.23 B: yeah 

369.64 373.30 B: i don't know president bush is talking about planning to you know tax cuts 

373.37 379.10 A: yeah i don't know how he's going to do it [laughter] like where he's coming up with the money or has he found a way to 

376.87 380.29 B: i don't know well he's taken it away from other programs i guess 

380.20 383.10 A: yeah the tax the cigarettes i smoke i
