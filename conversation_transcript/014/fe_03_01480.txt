86.22 89.73 B: yeah um other than that i guess 

89.82 96.23 B: um life has continued as normal i had no one i wasn't personally affected by it were y- did you have anyone 

96.46 100.49 A: (( um not ind- not directly indirectly ))

119.92 125.78 B: so when you're when you know of someone personally i think are you more aware of it 

124.86 130.85 A: [noise] i i am thinking with somebody more personally yes but i guess in working for the government um i- 

128.61 129.39 B: yeah 

131.40 144.04 A: i- its it's on my mind constantly like if i go and travel uh even if i'm just taking a relative up to the airport [sigh] uh i- it's on my mind constantly that way 

135.82 136.84 B: uh-huh 

143.76 144.69 B: yeah 

144.06 149.57 A: uh they tell you like to alter your ro- your routes when you're in your day to day living 

149.63 152.06 A: and i try to do that 

151.95 153.06 B: okay 

152.19 156.03 A: and like i keep my eyes open my ears open um 

156.43 159.98 A: pay more attention to my surroundings and what's going on around me 

159.53 160.65 B: right 

160.63 175.02 B: i guess my daughter just flew in and i was uh more aware of her flying you know i didn't wanna say don't fly but y- there's the the threat and especially with the war going on and i think that's you know related to nine one one you're just 

171.63 172.55 A: yes 

174.28 175.66 A: exactly 

175.02 183.19 B: ware of it and like you said you pay more attention to where you're at and and pagers that are left standing around and this type of thing 

183.03 188.22 A: yeah but you can't you like you said you can't let it alter your life you have to go on living 

186.52 187.35 B: no 

187.96 196.66 B: exactly i think if we uh go into our shells and our houses and basements then they've wo- exactly [mn] 

192.52 194.24 A: then then they've won 

195.70 198.74 A: they have won they have terrified us to stop living 

198.49 203.06 B: right and so i just don't feel that that's the right thing to do either 

199.64 200.83 A: and 

202.72 205.85 A: n- neither i have a two and a half year old and 

205.22 206.42 B: okay 

206.00 214.37 A: i i and i want the world for him you know and i- it's the weirdest thing because i had a child late in life and all i was

215.15 219.43 A: d- growing up i was thinking oh i'd hate to bring a baby into this world you know 

219.44 220.47 B: uh-huh 

219.84 228.32 A: thinking the way the world was going not even speculating that it was gonna happen the way it was go- you know that anything like that could possibly happen and i happened to be home that day 

222.52 223.30 B: (( [cough] )) 

224.63 225.49 B: right 

228.35 229.46 A: um 

229.57 230.65 B: oh 

229.99 231.62 A: [lipsmack] and watched it happen 

231.77 246.17 A: and i was in i was in total shock uh to see it and and then when it hit i think when it hit the pentagon i- i- felt i felt like it hit me more personally because that was a government install- you know building and that scared the the daylights out of me 

233.85 234.68 B: yeah 

243.26 244.34 B: (( yeah right )) 

245.78 249.18 B: oh yes i can understand that very much so 

246.65 247.52 A: (( [sigh] )) 

248.18 257.07 A: you know i i wouldn't say it didn't bother it bothered me but it didn't hit home as much as now you're on my coast now you're now you're on my home front 

256.29 260.61 B: right you're you're on my yeah you're on my on my ho- on my ground 

259.96 265.11 A: that's right a- and you know here i am right between the two things and 

264.06 265.51 B: uh-huh 

265.88 274.75 B: i can understand that very very much because of uh that's like the corridor too you know f- for people to travel up and down and and terrorists to 

265.99 267.05 A: [sigh] 

274.20 275.27 A: yes 

274.80 277.09 B: to go anywhere near there 

276.13 277.99 A: [noise] that's right 

277.55 281.46 B: so anyway we're supposed to be talking what for ten minutes 

279.18 280.15 A: (( [noise] )) 

280.79 282.19 A: ten minutes 

281.84 287.74 B: oh my gracious [laughter] that seems like a long time [laughter] 

284.55 286.33 A: [laughter] yeah and 

287.29 296.62 A: and you know also working with the military i i appreciate i mean i appreciate the military to no end i i think that the soldiers are fantastic for what they 

290.34 291.27 B: okay 

296.90 303.19 A: and i i [sigh] my heart and prayers are with them every second o- of the day um 

303.82 305.53 A: to try and protect us 

305.24 312.24 B: right did um do you think nine eleven had anything to do with w- or saddam hussein has anything to do with nine eleven 

311.80 322.10 A: i'm not sure to be honest with you i i'm not uh i've well i've said having a child i have the disney channel on all the time [sigh] because i don't want him to see this 

319.19 320.14 B: uh-huh 

321.81 322.67 B: right 

322.00 331.02 A: he's too young right now to even comprehend and he's also at that age where he's picking up on things and and i don't want him to be scared out of his wits 

328.57 329.32 B: yeah 

330.63 331.59 B: yeah 

330.99 339.38 A: he's too young for that so i'm not really paying attention as much to what's going on as most people do 

338.96 340.01 B: okay 

339.97 347.97 A: but um i try to read the newspaper once in a while when i can or if i'm online read what's going on on m._s._n._b._c. or something like that [sigh] 

340.38 341.16 B: i 

343.17 344.03 B: yeah 

347.00 348.01 B: uh-huh 

348.29 357.28 B: i know the day nine eleven came i work in the uh library at our education at our local school district and so we had uh 

357.32 361.53 B: it's for k. through six we had grades five and six in there and it was 

361.65 373.03 B: it was terrible for them and yet they we felt as a staff that they needed to know what was going on and they needed to get the facts straight and be with someone that they trusted 

367.86 368.94 A: of course 

373.45 387.38 B: and um yeah i can i can i'll never forget that day because we had all these kids cramped into this library and asking us questions and you know they'd go home and see it too but maybe mom and dad wouldn't be there right away to 

386.54 388.09 A: exactly 

387.49 391.99 B: to see this terrible thing and and to answer some of their questions and stuff 

391.38 392.80 A: (( [noise] )) 

392.47 397.03 B: so and plus there's the fact that some of these people's uh kids aren't 

396.12 396.68 A: (( [noise] )) 

397.49 402.82 B: don't like to a- talk to their parents or the parents aren't available to talk to them about these things 

400.86 401.75 A: right 

402.50 403.43 A: sure 

403.91 411.48 B: so but other well like i said previously um i just don't think my life other than being more aware 

411.55 413.98 B: of things has really changed 

414.03 424.16 B: um one thing that did change out here is right after this or in a day or two gas prices you know tripled and quadrupled 

423.56 424.76 A: oh geez 

424.32 435.56 B: and um we live in a farming community so that really did affect us th- that way but it didn't it didn't take long for them to come down when they realized what was happening [laughter] 

430.43 431.35 A: sure 

434.78 436.29 A: right 

436.11 437.20 B: so 

437.08 445.57 A: that was something i was afraid of happening with the war now [sigh] was that the gas prices were gonna sky rocket and i- they've creeped but i- 

440.52 441.32 B: that 

445.44 446.64 B: yeah 

446.03 449.70 A: it's not as drastically as i had imagined it would be 

449.32 452.46 B: right and don't you think part of that was because the um 

452.56 454.51 B: the gas fields were saved 

454.44 456.96 A: (( y- um yeah yep )) 

456.37 459.31 B: yeah so anyway 

459.43 462.94 B: let's see what else can i tell you about nine eleven i'm not sure 

462.97 466.97 B: have you seen the memorial or anything people say it's really colorful 

465.09 467.28 A: no not not the um 

467.36 481.83 A: uh i've seen pictures i've seen you know photographs that um are of like th- the big flag that they have out in i think it might be out in california [noise] in this big field [noise] and that was just a- amazing [noise] 

469.03 470.03 B: uh-huh 

481.59 489.50 B: oh yeah i think this has altered our life we'll remember this day just like remember the day uh well for me that kennedy was shot 

482.66 483.66 A: so 

489.24 490.41 A: right 

489.73 498.65 B: you know it's one of those days that that you will you will remember where you were like the space challenger when this all happened you remember exactly where you were 

496.89 497.91 A: sure 

498.69 500.17 B: and that type of thing 

500.85 501.91 B: so 

502.27 505.62 B: okay i i guess i don't really have anything else to say 

504.77 511.47 A: well we gotta hang on 'til like the beep comes on and tells us that this is my second call i did one last night [laughter] yeah 

507.09 508.29 B: okay 

509.33 511.52 B: really okay 

511.53 513.60 B: i just i just um 

511.69 512.60 A: (( so oh )) 

513.89 519.70 B: signed up about oh maybe three four hours ago so i was surprised to get a call this fast yeah [laughter] 

517.00 525.98 A: really [laughter] i signed up about a month ago or so and then when i got a call last night it was like what is this totally forgot about it [laughter] 

523.17 524.05 B: right 

524.55 527.23 B: [laughter] 

527.63 528.71 A: [sigh] 

528.34 536.90 B: i was reading on uh on one of the in line boa- online boards that people are are getting c- lots of calls and stuff so it should be 

536.12 536.83 A: okay 

537.12 538.91 B: it should be a fun experience 

538.60 543.80 A: yeah and i find it very interesting because i like to hear someone else's thoughts on on the subject of the day 

543.76 544.72 B: uh-huh 

543.85 556.20 A: and um a- and um even just talking to someone else about it like this it kinda puts y- you see like i said see seeing things from somebody else's perspective but it gives you more to think about yourself [noise] 

554.34 555.17 B: right 

555.32 564.91 B: and i think people become polarized you know you you know your views um in your own community and neighborhood but maybe not outside the neighborhood 

561.42 562.58 A: exactly 

564.83 567.74 A: right not knowing how it affects the a different part of the country 

567.32 569.21 B: right right 

568.07 575.18 A: i know one thing i i was really scared that you know i i still think about all those bridges out there and how they i keep hearing things that 

575.24 579.43 A: you know those could be a big target or or the nuclear plants um 

578.54 580.38 B: mhm 

579.71 587.97 A: a- and all i all i can do is just pray for everyone every day [noise] that you know [noise] god is with them and and this isn't gonna happen again 

586.25 587.04 B: yeah 

587.75 590.30 B: yeah i i i 

590.80 599.89 B: i guess maybe i'm very naive but i cannot fathom such a thing happening again i think you know like you had said the military were all on alert 

593.81 594.59 A: [noise]
