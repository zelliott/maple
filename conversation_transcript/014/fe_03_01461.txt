58.52 60.47 B: ah so anyway 

58.95 70.80 A: um uh i don't know very many of the forums but the i got one call when it first started and i didn't think i'd i didn't think i'd get any more then i got an email yesterday that i would be getting some more so 

61.66 62.53 B: no 

64.82 65.97 B: then nothing 

70.07 71.05 B: ah 

71.27 82.54 B: okay well it said what changes since uh since september eleventh september eleventh was say uh a day that will go down in infamy and it was a very scary and unhappy day 

75.68 76.61 A: right 

79.22 80.49 A: yes it will 

82.93 89.39 B: ah so what changes have you made uh if any since uh that occurrence has happened 

82.97 83.81 A: yes 

89.07 99.77 A: um i well i really can't say i've made that many uh i guess i've been more aware when i'm in a large crowd than i used to be i mean not that i panic or anything i just 

99.83 105.81 A: i i tend to just be more observant than i used to be other than that i don't think i've really done very much 

105.77 106.84 B: mm 

107.33 108.55 B: see uh 

108.67 114.56 B: over here uh about the uh main thing that we have done is spent more time uh 

114.46 125.38 B: learning about negative uh cultures that have bad values and stuff like that 'cause i teach my kids and uh teaching them 

120.09 121.08 A: uh-huh 

125.25 133.56 B: how to avoid getting involved with people like that not getting sucked up in this uh globalism garbage that they are trying to teach in school 

131.40 132.31 A: oh 

133.73 137.99 B: and that there is right and there is wrong and um 

137.99 152.47 B: you know that those kind of things that they do is definitely wrong and and wrong deeds have consequences and you know and when they do wrong things they should pay the price of the consequences you shouldn't just sit back and let it happen 

143.68 144.98 A: oh that's true 

152.50 156.86 B: my husband um also because he flies a lot for his job 

157.16 165.79 B: he uh you know changes he made is he had to go and sit and airports two and three hours earlier [laughter] he uh 

162.82 167.55 A: oh i'm sure of that but sometimes i think it's probably worth it though 

167.31 174.80 B: oh well because he flies for his job you know whatnot and he you know doesn't mind the security because he'd rather see 

169.17 170.24 A: right 

175.31 186.67 B: you know the inconvenience as opposed to letting uh evil people do evil deeds on innocent people and so that takes takes time to sort things out 

183.15 184.01 A: oh 

186.24 195.44 A: oh that's very true i mean i don't i've never flown but if i did i've never flown i i was not been scared i've always been scared of flying but 

189.81 191.40 B: you've never flown 

191.92 193.24 B: oh my goodness 

195.53 197.86 A: so i'm sure that this has made an 

197.91 206.36 A: even greater impact on me if i had to fly and i would not i would not mind the extra security and waiting extra because 

206.50 210.99 A: you know i just feel like our security was getting to lax to start with 

210.89 218.63 B: a yeah it as i say we we get very comfortable assuming uh we call it up here in minnesota nice 

218.31 219.31 A: mhm 

218.56 229.39 B: we you know we open doors for each other and we leave our back doors open uh it's trusting and we have a lot of people with rotten values um discovering there's a lot more of them than we realized 

229.16 230.69 A: um oh yeah 

229.82 235.47 B: you know [laughter] and so we have to wind up changing what we do which is sad you know 

234.53 243.32 A: yes it is it's really sad i mean you know we like i said my husband's retired and we travel quite a bit but we always drive but if we're in a 

243.43 245.71 A: in a larger or 

245.76 248.76 A: like a big city or something you know as i said before 

248.77 251.62 A: i found myself more aware of people and 

251.67 253.02 A: in watching 

253.12 259.68 A: sort of what's going on that i used to be so trusting and so it has took some of the trust that 

259.71 263.56 A: well i i guess i'm just not as trusting as i used to i always 

263.85 267.34 A: wanted to think the best of everybody but you know you can't do that now 

267.69 270.14 B: uh sad but very true 

268.70 272.72 A: and i try not to i try not to judge people but you know 

272.76 274.55 A: but still i'm more alert 

273.52 275.06 B: you got to use discernment 

275.62 276.76 A: (( i think )) 

275.63 276.98 B: you got to be thinking 

277.45 283.82 A: yeah i know it it takes a it takes a while i don't know if if the nation will ever get back as comfortable as they was at one time 

284.67 298.98 B: you know i don't know if we will or not especially if we continue to allow uh foreigners unchecked through our doors with lax policies and i'm i'm not a proponent of that you know i'm sorry if you are but 

293.02 294.27 A: (( don't fly )) 

298.87 302.34 A: no but i can't understand why we're so lax 

298.91 299.86 B: (( ah )) 

302.44 309.64 A: why do they they say well we knew there were so many many many here that their visas had expired now why 

310.21 312.63 A: why did that they not keep up with it more 

311.66 315.02 B: why do we have all these illegal aliens coming to our you know i 

313.70 315.61 A: that's right right 

314.94 328.37 B: mean i'm very aware when i look at various folks were known to have nationalities in criminal behaviors of terrorism and stuff like that you you think twice when you're looking 

328.28 331.84 B: you know at people because there's so many of them 

332.62 337.46 A: well i know that and that you know i just really feel like that uh there's really a breakdown 

337.73 344.98 A: in the visas and the passports and checking and the security that allows so many people into our country illegally 

341.30 342.16 B: oh 

344.63 346.10 B: right and then with 

345.30 349.73 A: because we have a we have a humongous amount of people that 

350.14 352.72 A: supposedly is that's their job to do 

353.46 361.43 B: yeah and um when we have uh that that's their job but they don't really totally do it which is really sad 

359.99 361.01 A: no i 

361.75 365.16 A: i don't know my daughter and her husband went to mexico to 

365.69 375.28 A: this is before the nine one one issue um and they came back he he went over to dive and he had his diving knives which he didn't even think about it was in his gear 

375.42 378.78 A: then later she said well they didn't even open it you know 

379.12 384.22 A: and you know it's just stuff like that they were so lax at customs 

379.25 379.98 B: mm 

382.90 392.81 B: yeah well they should be making changes uh you know to check for stuff going through you know airplanes buses any place where you could have people doing 

384.89 386.69 A: mhm they really should 

393.39 395.98 B: you know wicked evil things 

394.13 395.28 A: well yeah 

395.30 399.50 A: well this is just you know one incident heaven knows how many more that's being going on 

399.74 405.88 A: but i just it like i say it really upsets me to the point that we're just so much of our tax money is going 

406.05 410.52 A: to pay for all of this and i don't think don't think like they're on top of it like it should 

411.41 414.29 B: no i i vote with you there 

414.37 415.63 A: (( be yeah )) 

414.61 415.84 B: that's uh 

416.76 421.98 B: yeah there there should be some also some changes that we do along that line about 

422.41 425.83 B: rounding up the people who are here illegally and 

425.91 431.03 B: getting them out of here i don't care if they've been sitting here for a year and a half it's they're illegal still against the law 

430.98 432.57 A: oh that's right uh 

431.80 436.29 B: my tax paying dollars and yours should not be used to do that kind of stuff 

435.56 436.86 A: i don't think so 

436.44 438.69 B: you know to fund them and all that kind of stuff 

438.92 443.77 B: yeah [sigh] and we should probably you know spend more of our time and efforts 

443.83 450.71 B: tracking you know the whereabouts of people who have known connections to 

450.72 451.84 B: terrorism 

451.92 456.23 B: you know because i want to be safe i don't know about you [laughter] 

455.58 466.61 A: oh yeah i want to be safe like i say our our children are grown but they fly a lot and you know like i say they think nothing about going to [sigh] like you know 

466.69 471.58 A: (( not rio and paris and talking like that but like i say cantoon or or )) 

471.68 474.62 A: and it just scares me every time they go out the country 

475.03 479.33 A: i say hold on to your passport and they say mom i know what i'm doing oh 

479.36 480.65 A: (( you got to bring your kit )) 

481.16 485.82 A: so i don't know maybe i'm just very cautious where they're concerned 

485.62 489.89 B: yeah well caution cautious is something that we've all been since nine eleven 

489.90 492.15 A: yeah all this i was watching t._v. 

490.16 492.52 B: yeah i mean that was a very rude awakening 

492.55 496.31 A: i was watching and noticed when it happened that morning i thought just of them 

496.29 497.52 B: you were where 

497.32 499.33 A: i was watching the news that morning 

499.53 502.25 A: i was watching our regular news when they interrupted with 

502.44 503.60 B: oh 

502.96 506.99 A: for that and i couldn't believe it oh my goodness 

507.18 510.73 A: and they were you know they were showing the first one when the other one 

511.33 512.94 A: (( hit and i thought oh )) 

513.55 518.17 A: first thing i you know the first thing i thought it was an accident the second one i thought aha it's too 

518.98 523.23 A: that hit was oh i don't think i'll ever forget that sights that morning 

524.07 528.08 A: and everything that followed you know the days the people 

528.68 532.04 A: still hoping that a lot of the people would be alive 

533.18 540.58 B: yeah that was one thing that it's done is also a lot more praying for different people and presidents and so 

533.20 534.17 A: (( mhm )) 

540.55 549.65 B: people have got to make decisions and choices that affect you and me we've done a lot more of that uh both uh personally and off at church 

549.76 550.75 A: oh yes 

549.78 552.30 B: since that has happened so especially 

552.59 554.15 B: uh praying for 

554.84 558.44 B: you know all those poor folks who lost family members and stuff we 

558.85 564.16 B: you know been more conscious of that so that's one thing that we've done differently since that's happened 

562.41 563.36 A: (( yeah )) 

563.77 571.17 A: i really believe in the power of prayer i believe that you know there's no one that can do as much for us as the lord can do 

565.69 566.71 B: amen 

570.99 573.83 B: that's right that's the only one who can change hurts 

573.31 582.49 A: and that's true i mean like i'm like i've heard people say that god didn't answer my prayer and someone said sometimes he answers it with a no instead of a yes he always hears 

581.17 582.32 B: that's right 

582.54 586.05 A: and 'cause a lot of people want an answer the way they want it answered you know 

585.08 587.19 B: yeah that's not a heavenly bellhop 

586.74 590.00 A: uh-huh no and like i say i'm sure the 

590.31 593.98 A: well if it changed one person's life for the better 

594.17 597.78 A: i'm not saying it'd be worth but actually saying thankfully it did 

598.18 599.89 B: yeah i imagine it's a
