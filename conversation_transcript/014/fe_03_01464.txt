0.16 4.73 B: hi my name is jeanette and i'm from minnesota who am i speaking to 

4.18 7.46 A: hi jeanette i'm francine i'm from new york 

7.14 16.88 B: oh well this is the first time i've talked to someone from new york who might have actually experienced the attacks um would you like to start or shall i 

16.41 27.74 A: sure i can start i'm about five hours outside of new york city um i did know um a couple people who did work in um the trade center fortunately they were safe and sound 

27.41 28.62 B: oh good 

28.12 30.81 A: but the day of nine eleven was probably 

31.24 33.95 A: the scariest day of my life i just felt 

34.11 41.23 A: so many emotions and i have an eleven year old son and my first response was to go and get him from school of course that's 

41.26 50.49 A: we weren't allowed to do that the school was in lock down but i just wanted all my family near me and it was just so sad and and so scary because 

51.04 54.78 A: i didn't really i felt like there could be something more coming 

54.63 55.64 B: yeah 

55.09 67.42 A: and since it i was i am in new york and i just thought maybe we were next a next target so it was very frightening and some of the changes that i made well i haven't flown since nine eleven 

62.93 64.08 B: well i can 

68.61 69.77 A: um 

68.83 71.59 B: did you normally fly a lot before or 

70.66 75.34 A: well we always took a family va- a family vacation once a year 

75.39 83.91 A: um so that's you know that's been a change that we've made although my husband has flown for business so he's past it but i'm not [laughter] 

84.02 91.59 A: um uh other changes were things like um just making sure that the people that i love know that i love them 

91.35 92.38 B: right 

92.35 96.70 A: you know more often than than i would you know was doing in the past i guess 

96.76 98.69 A: how about you what kind of changes 

98.46 111.42 B: well i i don't think uh that we've made any significant changes um in our life other than the fact that we were deeply and terribly affected by by what happened as as the whole nation and the whole world was 

111.43 116.14 B: and our hearts went out to everyone who was involved in that horrible thing 

116.17 126.34 B: we don't personally know anybody who was lost or hurt but it was it was scary just watching it unfold on t._v. we were out of town as a matter of fact oh wow helping 

125.41 126.39 A: (( oh )) 

126.34 130.42 B: my mother in law who had had a uh a heart attack and she was in the hospital 

130.37 142.99 B: and we found out that she needed um skilled nursing home care so we were scrambling around trying to find an opening for her at a nursing home and interviewing doctors and nurses and 

139.64 140.39 A: (( boy )) 

143.20 154.31 B: trying to deal with what we were going to do with her apartment and everything else um because she couldn't go back to her apartment they they just she was uh incapacitated to the point where she needed skilled care 

154.57 164.35 B: so i was just extremely extremely difficult time for us at that point but once we got back home and were able to to deal with it more 

164.64 166.43 B: i think that um 

166.49 181.28 B: we have found ourselves closer as a family and and we're more caring and kinder to strangers i know we've contributed more money uh to charities and we always have been in the past but it's even been more significant for us 

181.41 190.34 B: um in fact when we got our federal tax rebate check back of six hundred dollars we donated that immediately to the red cross to to help the um 

190.42 192.97 B: nine one one victims and survivors 

191.81 192.64 A: wow 

193.44 207.53 B: and uh as far as flying um i haven't been on a plane since simply because i haven't had an opportunity to go along with my husband but um he was really wary about that first trip right afterward 

206.06 207.08 A: oh sure 

207.54 214.57 B: but he said as soon as he stepped foot in the airport and saw the security measures that were in place and the um 

215.27 228.86 B: the armed personnel that were stationed around there and uh the sky marshalls that were flying the flights he said that all just went away and and he knew things were going to be okay and he just you know went back to it like normal 

229.07 234.64 B: um i think that's the main thing is that a lot of the people i know 

234.86 248.59 B: feel that we are not going to be able to do anything because we don't know if anything specifically is going to harm us so you just think we're going to be okay and we have to live our life to the fullest and the best we can 

248.75 249.58 A: (( yeah )) 

248.96 257.59 B: and and we really haven't altered our our uh lifestyle or habits or made any significant changes other than 

257.94 261.48 B: we're aware of the dangers we know it exists 

261.51 266.01 B: and if it happens it happens and you know god bless us all 

266.57 268.38 B: we're all in this together 

267.94 269.41 A: yeah 

270.01 271.84 A: yeah i just i know that 

271.98 285.88 A: when it was closer to when it actually happened things just raced through my mind about um having everything in order um i didn't worry so much about having um survival supplies around the house 

285.64 286.61 B: okay 

286.00 288.66 A: but i worried about things um 

288.92 297.81 A: like when my husband and i weren't together and [cough] you know for whatever reason if he was even a a short trip within the state or 

297.93 299.39 A: of course on a longer 

299.47 308.64 A: trip that he would have to fly we just made things made sure things were in more in order and that things were you know right there that uh 

305.13 306.29 B: oh sure 

308.55 320.84 A: you wouldn't have to go searching for them if if god forbid you needed something like that i think one of the harder things i have an eleven year old and it was was pretty hard um helping him understand what was going on and to calm him 

321.02 330.99 A: uh i think that the school that he goes to did a real good job they kind of kept the kids away from the television as much as they could well during school it wasn't you know an issue 

330.92 340.98 A: um but they made sure that the teachers addressed issues as the kids wanted to talk about them but didn't make it a topic that had to be talked about 

340.24 344.32 B: yeah that's good yeah 'cause i i know some other people whose 

344.51 355.28 B: children were in school and they had the the kids watching this on t._v. over and over and over and i think that it really traumatized some of these youngsters i and i 

355.18 359.68 B: i really fear for how they're going to be dealing with this as they get older 

359.31 360.39 A: oh yeah 

359.69 372.16 B: because that's going to be embedded in their minds whether you know they they outwardly talk about it or not and it it is just such a frightening thing for a child it's bad enough for adults to deal with it but i just 

372.20 375.56 B: i can't imagine how upsetting that can be for children 

375.57 384.28 B: my own girls are are grown and out of the house now we're empty nesters but i find it interesting about your point about the survival um 

384.38 391.97 B: things my husband even just recently asked if we should get a generator for the house in case we ever have electrical um 

388.84 389.68 A: (( mm )) 

392.13 403.13 B: power outage and i said you know i said if if we don't have [laughter] electricity i said i think having a generator would probably be the last of our worries to be honest with you 

393.13 394.02 A: right 

402.59 404.17 A: exactly 

403.49 417.51 B: you know i said because you're not going even to be able to have the gas to to run the generator because electricity won't be there to to pump gas you know at the gas station and i certainly am not going to put in an underground gasoline storage you know tank for it 

415.53 416.96 A: [laughter] 

417.59 420.02 B: and he said yeah kinda good point 

419.33 423.58 A: [laughter] yeah it can snowball if you let it certainly could 

420.33 421.16 B: (( [laughter] )) 

422.62 429.95 B: oh i know i kno- and i and i know there are people like that out there i know people who have actually stocked up over a year's worth of food 

425.97 426.77 A: oh yeah 

429.42 430.43 A: oh yeah 

430.20 439.14 B: ah you know a year or two and some people i mean they've taken this to the nth degree uh [laughter] you know like even with a with a 

438.84 446.31 A: with the duct tape and the plastic yeah yeah i know a few people like that too my sister in law and brother in law were just absolutely 

439.84 441.62 B: yeah [laughter] 

447.15 457.58 A: just over so overly cautious in my opinion um and they wouldn't even let their children out of their sight for cor weeks and well probably months after nine eleven 

457.84 458.77 B: yeah 

457.88 462.87 A: and then with the war war in iraq you know they kind of had the same kind of thing 

463.12 472.78 B: and see that that i think is just sad because then you're going to be passing on that fear to your kids and then you're just a a hostage in your own in your own body you know and that 

463.24 464.28 A: (( with the )) 

468.15 469.02 A: exact- 

472.80 482.49 B: that is just not good but i think everybody has to decide for themselves what they have to do to feel that level of comfort that we had before nine one one 

482.88 486.70 B: 'cause god knows that this world is not the same since then 

486.36 492.02 A: well it really isn't the same and to to tell you the truth i still haven't gotten that level of comfort back 

492.08 501.23 A: there's still something in the back of my head that just keeps reminding me and reminding me that we're all so vulnerable and that anybody on the street could be the bad guy 

500.98 511.65 B: absolutely and that's that's the thing you you don't know and the only thing we have is this strength in numbers because there are so many of us and really relatively few of them 

511.39 512.23 A: yes 

511.66 518.99 B: and we are a very strong nation and optimistic people and all we can do is hope and pray for the best 

518.66 519.85 A: yeah 

519.46 530.45 B: i know uh like i brought up with some of my other callers that i would hear we live out in a a rural farming community but we're within twenty five miles of a nuclear power plant 

529.80 530.65 A: (( mm )) 

530.36 537.96 B: and they have beefed up security there and they've stopped the tours and you know you can't get anywhere near the perimeter of it 

538.05 550.56 B: and i said and then i noticed in a in our local um newspaper that um the f._d._a. is asking farmers to be vigilant on their farms for any possible terrorist activities 

549.35 550.19 A: wow 

550.24 550.93 A: (( mm )) 

550.66 555.76 B: now how many people think that like someone is going to come and approach a three hundred acre where 

555.95 560.40 B: the farmers out in his field somewhere or in the barn and everybody else is in town 

560.05 562.08 A: and sabotage it in some way 

561.32 570.91 B: exactly but that could happen you know what a what a perfect opportunity to um you know poison crops and and inject animals absolutely 

563.02 564.05 A: oh sure 

567.98 569.25 A: the food supply 

569.32 570.08 A: yeah 

570.23 571.69 A: mhm 

571.03 578.12 B: but we can't think of those things because it'll just drive you insane and nuts and that's what they want to do they want to scare you 

577.74 581.80 A: oh yeah they they're certainly playing on the psychological part of it 

581.45 590.18 B: yeah so i guess all all i can do is is i i know that i've been in more contact with my friends and family through the internet 

582.77 583.53 A: (( like )) 

588.77 589.52 A: yeah 

590.08 598.36 B: i i try to keep a positive attitude and i send jokes like crazy [laughter] because i always think laughter is always the best medicine 

594.42 595.55 A: [laughter] 

598.76 599.89 B: (( and just ))
