19.28 21.30 A: [laughter] 

20.24 21.62 B: i can't say anything 

22.64 26.31 A: um this is sort of a hard topic actually 

25.83 28.99 B: yeah i haven't really made any changes myself 

28.37 31.44 A: i know i don't think i'll be able to talk about this for ten minutes 

31.11 34.89 B: neither will i. [laughter] 

31.87 34.15 A: [laughter] 

34.35 35.96 A: um 

36.64 37.22 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

37.34 40.14 A: (( well )) 

40.49 47.55 A: well i don't know but maybe we could talk about if we think the changes that we've seen have been worthwhile 

46.65 53.13 B: mhm worthwhile yeah especially with the airports and their increases in their security 

47.88 48.89 A: i mean 

52.49 55.87 A: yeah i haven't really paid attention i mean 

55.97 59.20 A: i've noticed that they've sometimes make you check 

59.27 69.19 A: your shoes and they are a little bit more careful about checking people when they go in but i mean i haven't really noticed anything more than that really 

64.13 65.21 B: right 

68.42 73.44 B: either have i um from you know all i gather is they've just 

73.98 75.03 B: (( [mn] they're )) 

75.95 81.36 B: a little more cautious but it doesn't seem like they're i don't think they're as cautious as they should be 

80.97 85.01 A: mhm well what more do you think they should do 

84.87 92.94 B: [sigh] you know i'm not really sure i mean as far as you know going going down to strip searching people but you know 

87.69 88.73 A: yeah 

93.42 100.33 B: i i don't think that would be appropriate but then again we don't want anything like sep- september eleventh to happen again 

99.94 101.47 A: right 

101.88 103.98 A: um 

104.13 106.72 A: [mn] i don't know it also seems like 

107.20 109.70 A: whenever i fly from louisville 

109.20 110.07 B: uh-huh 

109.91 117.52 A: that's where i'm originally from that the security there is much less tight than when i fly from boston 

115.08 115.83 B: uh-huh 

118.01 119.16 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

119.60 120.85 A: and so 

119.84 121.56 B: smaller airport maybe i 

121.49 122.95 A: what's that 

122.23 125.66 B: think maybe because of the smaller airport that you're at they're not 

126.34 127.84 B: they're not as ah 

129.49 130.96 B: (( i don't know apt to )) 

131.20 132.48 B: to really 

133.94 137.28 B: i guess they probably don't think that anything is going to happen there in louisville 

137.04 139.35 A: yeah but don't you think they should have like a 

139.53 141.87 A: a national standard so that 

140.99 146.53 B: that's that's exactly what i was ah about to get at you know i i'm from st louis so we're 

143.79 145.45 A: yeah 

146.71 151.14 B: kind of directly in the centre and we have a lot of lay overs here in st louis 

149.73 151.67 A: right right 

151.27 157.62 B: and you know even st louis i think they should be a lot stricter than what what it seems like they are 

158.43 162.70 B: i i don't fly very much mys- i've actually never flown myself 

162.76 163.86 A: oh really 

163.52 164.62 B: no 

164.64 165.47 A: (( ahah )) 

166.83 169.33 B: but you know just judging by what 

169.34 171.52 B: what we hear on the t._v. 

170.97 172.43 A: mhm 

171.70 174.57 B: they i think they could be stricter 

175.21 176.71 A: yeah um 

177.47 184.90 A: i don't know i mean it seems to me if someone is flying from louisville they could fly you know anywhere so they could go from a lower 

182.75 183.56 B: (( ahah )) 

185.19 186.00 A: (( you know )) 

186.75 188.88 A: security point 

188.66 189.55 B: right 

188.94 191.36 A: to and then fly anywhere 

191.25 192.11 B: mhm 

191.48 195.47 A: and you know it seems like you'd have to have a national 

195.27 200.57 B: exactly exactly because you know they could start off from louisville and 

195.99 197.00 A: level 

200.83 202.67 B: fly out to washington 

202.14 203.74 A: yeah exactly 

205.01 206.63 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

207.79 217.74 A: i sometime i sometimes notice more um i guess army personnel at airports just i guess more security that way 

213.66 214.50 B: uh-huh 

217.19 219.46 B: (( right yeah )) 

218.11 226.63 A: but i think i think that just makes normal people more paranoid than making them feel very safe yeah 

222.30 223.18 B: uh-huh 

223.75 225.38 B: more comfortable right 

227.61 231.22 A: um but i mean other than flying i really haven't 

232.37 238.90 A: um i mean when they when bush issued that um you know alert for 

239.18 241.37 A: i forget what it was called like an orange alert or 

240.83 242.16 B: yeah yeah 

241.46 242.56 A: or whatever 

243.03 246.61 A: i mean i got some e-mails at work saying 

246.84 249.68 A: you know be sure to wear your badge at all times 

249.12 250.23 B: (( mhm uh-huh uh-huh )) 

249.83 259.07 A: be sure to question people if they're if they don't have a badge on and you don't recognize them and they're not accompanied with someone else or 

258.76 259.55 B: (( uh-huh a )) 

259.39 260.75 A: um 

260.77 261.33 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

261.35 265.85 A: so i mean at work i've gotten a little bit of 

266.06 267.13 A: (( you know )) 

267.28 268.67 A: advice about 

267.66 269.30 B: little more cautious 

268.68 273.02 A: yeah i don't know has has your work done anything like that 

272.45 274.56 B: (( um i actually am a )) 

274.62 275.96 B: homemaker 

275.35 276.74 A: oh okay 

276.20 278.44 B: stay at home mommy is the new term 

277.34 278.26 A: uh-huh 

278.72 280.45 B: so you know we really 

280.62 282.59 B: haven't really changed much 

282.04 284.24 A: yeah do you have kids at school 

284.13 286.64 B: no they're toddlers 

286.04 287.31 A: oh okay 

286.75 291.58 B: but we are more cautious of people in the neighborhood you know we tend to pay attention to 

291.89 293.82 B: strangers in the area 

293.42 295.37 A: mhm 

299.50 300.71 A: oh 

300.27 301.38 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

300.89 301.50 A: (( [laughter] )) 

301.54 306.02 B: my little one's wanting me to hold him probably has to start screaming here he's ah almost two 

303.12 304.49 A: oh how old is he ah 

306.02 309.73 A: okay my nephew is turning one next month 

309.40 310.23 B: uh-huh 

309.93 311.39 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

312.14 313.78 B: (( [noise] very sweet )) 

313.71 315.21 A: (( i )) 

314.11 315.15 B: (( whoops )) 

317.35 321.31 A: actually have a sister who lives in d._c. right now 

320.87 321.72 B: uh-huh 

321.74 323.27 B: was she there 

324.54 326.66 B: around anything that happened 

325.80 329.89 A: no she um has just been there for the past six months 

329.75 330.98 B: was she pretty 

331.09 334.26 B: was she pretty ah concerned about going out was she 

334.33 337.57 B: did she do anything you know while she was out there 

337.56 342.38 A: you know i don't think there's anything really that people can do in their day to day life you know 

342.06 343.25 B: yeah 

342.65 347.41 A: um i mean she lives a little bit outside of the city 

346.72 347.61 B: uh-huh 

347.48 348.82 A: um 

350.24 356.10 A: and so she said just because it's d._c. they're just i think there usually is a lot of 

350.31 350.89 B: (( [noise] )) 

356.01 357.27 B: security 

356.86 359.40 A: army personnel yeah and security 

359.64 361.19 A: (( [mn] um )) 

363.58 369.12 A: but you know i mean you can't really just be paranoid all the time and um 

368.05 369.57 B: i completely agree 

369.26 370.84 A: i mean the sort of thing 

372.05 373.31 A: um 

374.50 376.71 A: i mean for one thing it usually happens in 

376.95 378.93 A: um really urban areas 

378.59 379.42 B: uh-huh 

379.08 384.79 A: so like new york and d._c. are more likely targets than you know louisville or st louis 

384.67 388.66 B: and that's what that's one thing that i'm a little concerned with too i mean they they 

388.62 393.32 B: they announce that all over the news and you know they they kind of give you that false security where 

393.27 404.44 B: you know a smaller i mean st louis is kind of a smaller city you know a large city but it's still smaller compared to everything else but they kind of give us a false sense of ah security when 

397.01 398.74 A: mhm 

400.15 401.20 A: right 

405.25 417.60 B: you know announcing it all over t._v. and i'm sitting here thinking okay they're announcing this on t._v. don't you think that's gonna give them another idea to okay let's go ahead to the smaller city and we'll get 'em where we're not where they're not expecting it 

414.19 415.55 A: yeah 

416.84 418.49 A: yeah 

417.97 420.38 B: you know and you know i think the media 

420.59 423.72 B: i think they personally i think need to 

423.80 426.09 B: calm it down a little bit and not 

427.04 436.71 B: [sigh] you know [noise] it's kind of hard to say they shouldn't talk about important issues like that but sometimes i think they need to be a little more i don't know maybe tasteful in what they say 

434.90 436.19 A: yeah 

436.22 437.32 A: right 

438.43 447.61 A: yeah it's a tou- i don't know it's a tough thing the one thing that that i thought was sort of disturbing was that um 

440.63 441.56 B: (( [noise] )) 

447.69 451.54 A: i have a friend who i work with who 

451.91 457.55 A: he is a canadian citizen but his his parents are from pakistan or something 

453.56 454.44 B: uh-huh 

457.29 458.14 B: uh-huh 

457.81 465.27 A: and um he was telling me about how his sister had to register 

465.28 468.63 A: um because 

468.93 474.30 A: i'm not exactly sure what it was but something about how she was from canada and she was 

474.45 479.44 A: sort of arabic and you know i thought that was a little weird 

476.13 477.03 B: uh-huh 

479.11 480.49 B: yeah 

480.25 481.55 A: um 

481.46 485.77 B: [noise] yeah another thing that ah concerned me too is ah 

485.94 491.06 B: i guess more the racial profiling that that happens i have a friend um 

491.42 493.44 B: that is from hungary 

493.58 502.59 B: and he went to school out here you know actually went to wash u. and got a business degree and he was ah he just finished his masters 

497.85 499.09 A: mhm 

502.87 508.79 B: and had the worst time getting a job out here because [noise] the looks 

509.28 510.41 B: (( um )) 

510.50 512.95 B: the i guess the arabic 

513.33 514.38 A: mhm 

513.64 517.16 B: look he he you know he is tall dark skinned dark hair 

516.48 518.37 A: mhm 

517.63 519.28 B: and it's you know 

519.76 520.81 B: (( ah it's a )) 

521.07 527.33 B: little disappointing that ah they had to move back to hungary because he wouldn't get hired by anybody 

526.73 528.37 A: right 

527.89 530.17 B: and i think that that's 

530.29 532.09 B: you know it's a little disappointing 

531.86 536.17 A: yeah i mean a similar thing i think happened around world war two 

535.97 536.86 B: uh-huh 

536.23 541.86 A: with the japanese people i mean that was much more extreme because they were actually shipped off to 

537.50 538.41 B: uh-huh 

541.87 542.80 B: right 

541.91 544.31 A: to these camps or whatever but 

543.67 544.60 B: right 

544.35 545.48 A: um 

545.93 550.24 A: i don't know in situations like this it seems like the government 

550.51 551.91 A: um 

552.56 558.23 A: you know they say that they are trying to protect us but they do some things that you know 

557.01 558.96 B: kind of don't protect us 

558.52 561.31 A: yeah they're just a little bit um 

561.96 563.75 A: suspicious [laughter] 

563.15 564.58 B: yeah [laughter] 

563.92 570.42 A: or a little bit unfair i think but um [lipsmack] 

565.61 566.55 B: right 

575.60 577.71 A: yeah [laughter] 

577.48 578.40 B: [laughter] 

578.78 583.10 B: it's kind of a hard subject to talk about for ten minutes [laughter] 

581.15 582.57 A: yeah i know 

584.05 590.12 B: but as far as you know getting back to the topic day to day life nothing has really changed around here 

589.41 590.99 A: right 

590.59 599.89 B: you know like i said i pay attention to the t._v. more often i'm a little more cautious when i'm out and about especially when i'm by myself with my children
