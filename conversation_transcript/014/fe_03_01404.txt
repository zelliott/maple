419.36 420.39 A: uh-huh 

419.68 422.72 B: i spend a lot of time on the computer 

422.37 423.70 A: (( ooh )) 

422.79 426.46 B: and i'm afraid i'm getting carpel tunnel or something 

425.04 426.04 A: yeah 

426.07 426.91 A: yeah 

427.10 432.20 B: you know my elbow hurts really really bad and my forearm and 

431.12 435.14 A: yeah yeah i've developed carpel tunnel 

435.24 436.21 A: (( uh )) 

436.41 441.64 A: got they tested me on that with all these little electrodes and everything 

441.85 443.00 A: um 

443.80 446.35 A: mine got better 

447.18 449.31 A: and when did it start it 

449.44 455.22 A: started getting better last fal- you know when it started getting better and you're not even gonna wanna hear this 

455.32 457.14 A: it's when i quit smoking 

457.76 458.98 B: really 

458.41 459.52 A: yes 

459.57 462.90 A: because i stopped smoking in october 

463.39 473.24 A: and that's when this started getting better i mean i've i've noticed the past two or three months that i haven't had the numbness 

473.47 474.60 B: mhm 

473.83 483.58 A: and you know how you got the your wrist and right above your elbow below those muscles that hurt so bad and stiffen up and 

483.01 488.19 B: no wait a minute isn't it just a couple of months ago you started exercising 

488.42 491.58 A: (( yeah so maybe the exercise )) 

489.94 493.43 B: so maybe that has something to do with it 

492.68 494.50 A: well that's true 

494.37 497.86 B: you're using your arm differently than you used to 

497.47 499.52 A: yeah that's true 

498.40 500.81 B: and maybe building some muscle 

500.67 505.60 A: i guess so 'cause i'm doing like those bicep machines 

505.92 511.08 A: and the triceps and those lateral raises 

511.14 512.27 B: mhm 

511.68 514.39 A: and that over the arm machine 

514.75 517.25 A: (( so it could be )) 

516.63 527.86 B: well i think as we get older you know when we're young our blood doesn't really produce our it produces a lot of oxygen and when we get older it doesn't any more 

528.15 534.80 B: and we get in a rut of doing routines and just using certain muscles all the time 

534.70 536.32 A: you're right 

536.11 540.33 B: and i think that has a lot to do with it 'cause i know that 

540.54 547.15 B: if i lay in bed too long like if i'm down with cold or the flu my back really hurts bad 

544.43 545.86 A: mhm 

546.67 547.89 A: mhm 

547.25 551.66 B: but if i go out and walk or um 

551.80 558.60 B: i work on my house you know where i'm doing a lot of bending and stuff my back actually feels better 

558.36 559.55 A: yeah 

559.66 562.09 B: from exercising it so 

561.41 562.79 A: that's true 

563.93 567.47 A: wow i hadn't thought of that so there is hope 

564.17 566.28 B: maybe i should start 

567.41 573.36 B: yeah maybe i should start doing something so you're doing the bicep curls you said 

572.53 577.37 A: yeah yeah which i guess you could do those with just free weights 'cause 

577.82 587.20 A: uh you could do those and the triceps i do i don't use a machine i just do like a ten pound you know and bend 

587.41 593.43 A: and and do the you know pulling it up and all [sigh] and um 

587.45 588.55 B: mhm 

594.38 599.14 A: and i and i think the yoga helps that too 'cause 

599.35 599.89 A: of
