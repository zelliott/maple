181.85 183.71 B: situation a little bit 

182.14 182.87 A: (( we- )) 

183.34 190.59 A: well that's kinda how i felt you know if if i were going to fly somewhere uh that would've been a good time to do it [laughter] you know

196.97 197.70 A: (( yes )) 

197.76 200.49 A: [laughter] 

199.73 201.52 B: now's the time to go 

201.04 208.09 A: yeah i don't know if i wanna go to asia or not though [laughter] that that one can get you one way or the other 

202.04 203.25 B: but yeah 

204.53 206.61 B: i know with the sars 

208.00 213.68 B: yeah i mean th- they're saying it's not as contagious as you know once they thought 

213.62 220.66 A: well i don't know i'm sure you've seen some of the news clips where they people over there are walking around with face mask on 

220.32 221.75 B: yeah yeah 

221.16 224.20 A: now if that doesn't tell me that uh you know 

224.94 227.00 A: you don't wanna be walking around there 

226.63 228.78 B: yeah [laughter] huh huh huh 

228.17 229.17 A: (( so )) 

229.12 234.51 B: but i mean as far as how it changed my life i guess i just realized that 

235.35 241.87 B: i don't know i i got the feeling that you know i mean i i felt a lot for the people who 

242.62 256.89 B: were in the world trade center and who were young and just starting their lives and you know probably didn't have their w- their estate plans in place and you know left behind mothers and children who probably didn't have 

256.90 257.90 B: you know 

258.12 265.08 B: i don't know it just made you feel like you'd better get your stuff together because things could happen like that that are so unexpected 

264.72 269.61 A: yeah yeah well that and also you know it uh 

269.90 271.62 A: i think the one thing that i 

271.88 277.53 A: you know gave some thought to was the fact that uh we're not as invulnerable as we think we are 

277.24 278.51 B: yeah 

278.14 280.12 A: uh they can get to us 

279.92 285.60 B: yeah yeah i mean gosh i mean i- i- i just remember when i saw it 'cause i i just 

280.62 281.50 A: (( so )) 

285.68 286.59 B: um 

286.75 294.88 B: i woke up and i remember walking into the living room and the television was on and i was like is this a movie or something 

294.17 295.35 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

295.00 296.83 B: i thought it was a movie you know 

297.29 303.78 B: and i was like this is not for real uh this is i was ju- i couldn't believe it was for real for the long- like for a couple of minutes there 

303.51 306.14 A: (( yeah yeah that was a )) 

304.80 309.13 B: but yeah i mean then i just think gosh you know w- what kind of people think of that 

309.27 310.98 A: yeah 

309.41 311.74 B: and and think that that's okay 

312.96 323.43 A: yeah see i didn't know anyone i don't know i i think i have a cousin that lives somewhere up around new new york area uh but other than that i don't really know anyone in new york 

319.47 320.55 B: mhm 

323.00 325.30 B: have you been there a couple of times or 

324.24 325.22 A: i 

325.26 330.04 A: was through there probably thirty five years ago 

330.50 332.47 A: uh was up there 

334.24 338.48 A: in well it'd probably be more than that uh man it was a long time ago 

338.29 339.38 B: mhm 

338.99 340.55 A: so you know 

340.95 343.18 A: it wasn't anything like it is now 

343.67 344.72 A: uh 

345.70 348.72 A: and like i say i you know i don't know anybody there 

348.56 349.58 B: mhm 

349.21 356.28 A: but where you you knew people that uh worked in the building and like that that puts you a little closer to the situation 

351.09 352.11 B: yeah 

353.18 354.49 B: mm worked there 

356.05 366.79 B: yeah yeah i mean you know it's kinda oh [sigh] [laughter] i and i lived in new york for a little while and i had you know i'd bee- i visit not not like

371.20 372.90 A: yeah 

371.82 379.46 B: so you know it's a- and you know last time we went to new york was not last easter well it was like two easters before september eleventh 

379.39 380.57 A: yeah 

379.92 387.98 B: and i remember we went up to the world trade center at the top th- the bar at the top you know we were just looking out and you know

390.66 392.16 A: yeah 

391.28 392.63 B: that's gone 

392.21 394.82 A: could've been that day too just as easy 

394.89 400.70 B: well actually when i was in college i was in a subway when the world trade center was bombed 

400.86 402.55 B: remember that the bombing 

402.42 403.74 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

403.14 407.66 B: yeah i was in the subway below the [laughter] world trade center when that happened 

406.89 408.87 A: (( [laughter] )) 

408.24 414.80 B: i mean you know obviously it didn't collapse at that point but it was pretty scary i was like was that an earthquake you know [laughter] 

414.03 415.23 A: yeah

423.62 426.16 A: up on the top floor of one of their 

426.24 429.48 A: high rises and uh they had an earthquake 

429.21 430.16 B: (( mm )) 

429.59 432.83 A: well their building structures are 

433.33 438.35 A: they don't have the uh restrictions and rules that we do for earthquakes 

437.95 439.12 B: mhm 

438.66 442.80 A: um that's probably the scariest thing i've ever been in 

443.13 448.19 A: um 'cause those buildings could've collapsed just as easy as a card house 

447.95 450.34 B: wow how b- how big of an earthquake 

450.29 455.24 A: oh it was probably a six point something i i can't remember for sure but it was somewhere right in there 

454.85 455.93 B: wow 

455.34 459.46 A: enough that it shook the it shook the building i was up on uh 

459.92 462.53 A: near the top of the next to the top floor 

462.18 463.40 B: mhm 

462.73 463.93 A: and uh 

464.22 471.71 A: the uh merchandise i was looking at they had on their you know little glass counter shelves and like that it was just rattling all over the place 

472.07 474.83 A: falling on the ground and 

473.79 475.57 B: wow [laughter] 

475.16 483.50 A: but it's scary [sigh] you know any of that type of thing that and i say this nine one nine eleven uh 

484.55 490.34 A: i've never been in that building so but you know i've seen enough pictures of it on the t._v. 

490.03 491.37 B: mhm 

490.73 494.05 A: that uh i know i wouldn't wanna be up there when that when on 

494.66 495.69 B: yeah

502.18 507.10 B: or w- w- was it a un- american the other f- the other plane or or both united

512.29 513.55 A: yeah 

513.27 524.01 B: that freaked me out and then to think you know here you are you know getting on a plane and then some terrorist gets on and you just realize how lax our security system is 

523.64 524.79 A: yeah 

524.19 527.37 B: or was i guess they're i still think it's 

527.46 534.64 B: i don't know i mean last year i uh part of i guess part of the thing that i did was i just decided it was time to start seeing the world right away 

534.34 535.58 A: [laughter] 

534.96 539.98 B: so i like traveled to like seven countries last year just for fun 

538.93 540.62 A: yeah 

540.26 541.40 B: and 

541.81 544.88 B: i was amazed at like how stringent 

545.25 549.41 B: security is like in london and in denmark and you know 

549.39 550.80 A: yeah 

550.15 554.25 B: i mean they're tight and they they check you three times before you even get on the plane 

553.86 557.70 A: why not uh and we didn't 

557.10 559.04 B: no [laughter] obviously 

558.68 560.44 A: huh well even you know 

560.52 561.56 A: (( um )) 

563.03 568.10 A: i mean you know years this has been going on i mean you could bring anything just about you wanted to there

568.83 569.94 A: (( you know )) 

569.24 580.28 B: i mean especially carry on they're just like whatever you you know don't pack this or you could bring presents through wrapped boxes you could bring you know all the sharp things you wanted [laughter] 

570.90 571.80 A: yeah 

577.08 577.88 A: yeah 

579.40 581.42 A: [laughter] 

580.40 585.24 B: i'm like this isn't really good well i mean forget about terrorists what about some psycho person who just 

584.99 586.93 A: right 

585.66 589.57 B: gets mad at somebody and starts to ha- you know wants to harm them on a plane 

589.78 597.67 A: yeah yeah that's it's scary you know and like i say we're starting to pay a little bit more attention i think we've still got a ways to go 

597.83 598.91 B: yeah 

598.29 599.89 A: but uh we're getting
