77.11 81.69 B: ah and if i do go i wouldn't take ah a bridge or a tunnel i would take one of the ferries across 

81.73 89.39 A: yeah i can imagine if i lived up there it would be totally different and ah and i mean i don't want to be naive but being 

89.63 91.42 A: you know where i was 

92.04 92.91 A: (( ah )) 

92.62 94.89 B: were you in florida when it happened 

94.57 106.68 A: yeah and i know there was the whole florida you know connection with terrorists and stuff so i mean it was kind of close to home in that respect but not like you know maybe you could probably even have seen 

98.31 99.27 B: right 

107.04 108.99 A: smoke and all of that ah 

108.51 113.79 B: no i wasn't that close but i'll i'll tell you it it always struck me that to the rest of the country 

114.01 117.62 B: um in many ways this was a a t._v. show 

117.71 120.08 B: i mean it wasn't um 

120.36 131.98 B: it wasn't down the street it wasn't necessarily people that you knew i mean whole neighborhoods in in jersey here were affected you know from ah two families um to some areas fifty families 

122.07 123.00 A: right 

132.15 139.64 B: were affected by it and ah it yeah it changed a lot i mean it changed the way i think about things it changes the way i ah 

132.20 133.01 A: yeah 

140.80 149.46 B: [cough] pardon me the way i do things um and ah it it i i've always been like a mom's apple pie american kind of guy 

149.27 150.24 A: mhm 

149.56 158.74 B: but i think i am even more rabid as relates to what we did in afghanistan and what we are doing in iraq than i would have been beforehand 

158.83 160.37 B: in terms of supporting it 

160.14 161.16 A: right 

160.58 169.24 B: supporting the whole effort and what not um yeah i even got the the potassium iodate pills that you are supposed to take if they go after a nuke 

168.87 180.42 A: right well you know when i was talking about mental i everything that you said that you went out and did [mn] i feel stupid to say it but i've been thinking about doing it ever since you know i mean i did my research 

178.22 179.21 B: mhm 

180.43 185.72 A: about that too i was gonna buy some of that because we have ah nuclear facilities close by 

185.15 187.08 B: that wouldn't be a bad idea 

186.49 187.76 A: yeah 

187.17 201.00 B: that really wouldn't be a bad idea simply because look even if there's just ah an accident without any al-qaeda or terrorist ah participation um those things are handy i know that in jersey 

201.01 204.79 B: especially central jersey where my girlfriend lives down by the shore 

204.82 208.68 B: they handed out these pills to all the postal workers 

208.11 209.32 A: really hm 

208.70 222.29 B: yeah they've all got it listen i was trying to get sipro [laughter] back in back that fall but my feeling always had been that it was domestic i didn't think that it had anything to do with with overseas and i think that that's what they finally concluded 

212.28 213.09 A: yeah 

222.14 234.67 B: that it was somebody you know like a debate type who ah was responsible for ah for that type of thing what about your neighbors what kind of um preparations or changes have you seen them make 

225.91 226.89 A: yeah 

235.62 244.35 A: you know i i haven't seen anything although the one thing i have noticed ah is just increased security 

243.74 245.10 B: mhm 

244.93 245.99 A: um 

246.72 252.49 A: i know there's al- it has been ever like since that happened there has been like a palpable sense 

252.74 258.49 A: well actually now i think within a month of it happening um 

258.74 268.73 A: you know it might have not been within a month but 'cause all the after when they started mailing the ah you know the anthrax letters and all that some time when that was happening i went to the store and i saw 

270.00 271.33 A: a guy 

271.81 280.05 A: in a van had new york licence plates and there was actually a big pick up truck and he was of middle eastern descent and he was asking directions 

279.47 280.85 B: mhm 

280.34 286.91 A: um in town and i remember being really spooked by that and and um 

288.69 295.28 A: ah once again it's just a mental thing i noticed that ah ever since then i have just noticed and still it's kind of like a 

295.44 298.20 A: palpable sense of like 

298.66 300.18 A: more vigilance 

299.69 301.48 B: oh sure yeah you you 

300.49 302.22 A: you notice things 

301.56 303.30 B: you're looking over your shoulder 

302.29 304.08 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

303.39 306.61 B: that's not unusual ah 

307.20 313.42 B: an unusual thing to feel at all or to start to do i mean um sure you look at everybody with um a 

313.54 315.01 B: jaundiced eye 

314.66 315.80 A: (( yeah ha )) 

315.37 318.59 B: you know i know i do that you know and when i see um 

318.82 333.64 B: for example for a while i was working ah i'm retired and and so i like pick up a job here pick up a job there just to to keep out of trouble and off the internet and i was working at a a lube shop because i like to work on cars although my background is in television 

333.80 336.88 B: and there was a guy came in arab guy 

337.08 338.38 B: white van 

338.57 339.13 A: (( [mn] )) 

339.07 343.32 B: packed full of stuff packed full of boxes and i'm looking at him too 

341.68 342.33 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

343.11 344.07 A: (( yeah ha )) 

343.69 352.05 B: you know i mean i went up to him and i said so so abdul where's the anthrax and he gave kind of like a nervous laugh um 

347.77 348.82 A: (( [laughter] right [laughter] )) 

352.02 358.94 B: so yeah all those things they all ah play into it they all affect it and i think if um 

359.54 364.91 B: if there's any kind of changes people have made it's it's an awareness of their surroundings and perceptions of people 

363.09 363.95 A: you know 

364.59 368.58 A: i'm sorry to interrupt but i thought of something that i really ha 

368.66 369.52 A: this 

369.91 375.63 A: this sounds so um petty but it's something that it's a behaviour that i've changed since then 

376.22 377.55 A: and um 

377.96 380.13 A: it actually was that um 

380.42 390.21 A: i was growing my beard out last year and i noticed that i got a lot of because i have dark hair and i'm dark complexioned and ah i noticed 

385.84 386.68 B: (( ahah )) 

389.99 401.01 A: that like you walk into the supermarket and everybody's head turns you know because i have like a bushy black beard and it really made me uncomfortable because i sensed it like everywhere i went

416.29 420.60 A: literally all the heads turn you know and you can just sense kind of like 

420.01 423.44 B: you see i didn't have to deal with that at all because i'm blonde and blue 

423.02 424.35 A: (( yeah ah right )) 

423.84 433.00 B: they pretty much left me alone because there haven't been many swedes that have come over here and blown shit up um but yeah that i know um 

427.48 428.42 A: right 

433.24 438.14 B: i know this one pakistani guy who because of his accent was being looked at you know 

438.60 445.13 B: [mn] in terms of you know when he was out and stuff like that and at that time the pakistanis were like our friends i mean they were helping us

454.98 458.44 B: i know that that many arabs here have changed their um 

458.60 464.52 B: in in in the first few months they changed their their patterns of shopping and things like that and there were volunteers 

464.67 474.13 B: that would go with them like when the women had to go to the supermarket or the kids had after school or whatever because there was some ah um 

469.30 470.18 A: mhm
