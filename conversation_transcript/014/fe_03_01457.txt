31.34 32.27 A: no 

32.73 33.63 A: no 

35.69 44.52 A: no no uh-huh well you know that'd be all more like the current war thing you know they're talking about like september eleventh two thousand and one 

45.00 49.01 A: about maybe they wanting to know if you quit traveling and stuff 

48.43 55.04 B: i wasn't traveling anyway i know you know i mean it did make me look at my you know patriotism 

49.91 51.68 A: no me neither 

55.14 60.52 B: um and of course i i did put up flags you know supporting my country 

55.26 56.33 A: yeah 

59.88 61.34 A: yeah 

60.45 71.70 B: and you know like my team you know how dare you do that there was some anger and some resentment and mostly it was because of the clip i don't know if you saw of that day 

62.38 64.04 A: yeah 

71.45 72.90 A: over and over 

71.69 77.93 B: of that how oh pakistan and you know they're over there dancing and laughing and singing 

76.77 79.73 A: yeah the right bastards i swear 

79.01 80.63 B: and you know 

79.75 85.77 A: how could you do that i mean we're not even doing that when the people are getting killed in this war now 

85.68 86.84 B: (( and then they )) 

85.93 89.10 A: nobody's gleefully celebrating anything 

88.53 94.12 B: yeah and it you know part of it made me question you know okay 

94.32 96.35 B: did i harbor resentment 

97.12 111.47 B: no i kinda felt like you know i didn't want to think i did but then you know when i would see somebody you know from the middle east or you know if i'm in the gas station or something you know i mean these people probably weren't even from iraq or 

111.42 118.93 B: or you know afghanistan or pakistan they could have been east indian but you know just because i had that mindset 

114.78 118.23 A: yeah yeah because of 

118.70 122.75 A: their ethnicity possibly 

118.95 119.93 B: (( you know )) 

122.25 123.48 B: yeah 

122.97 130.72 A: you know i don't even really feel like i experienced anything like that gail um i mostly had more extra fear 

131.39 140.81 A: that that sense of foreboding that something else was going to happen just any time and it took a really long time for that to diminish 

140.96 147.50 A: and then having this start up now with the war that also made me have lots of extra fear but you know 

148.03 148.88 A: i don't 

148.96 156.94 A: i don't know that i made any lifestyle changes of course we flew the flag and everything and that everybody felt all the grief 

157.20 160.96 A: for all of the people that so unjustly 

161.18 162.50 A: died 

162.14 163.69 B: yeah 

163.19 172.05 A: it was really bizarre to have the sky empty for so many days after it happened and everything was just so dead silent 

172.02 179.19 A: that you couldn't help but think about it of course if you also if you read papers and ever ever turn on the t._v. 

178.80 180.53 B: it was always there 

179.78 184.14 A: you know it was it was ever present and it i'm not saying it shouldn't have been 

184.44 187.41 A: but it was just sort of a first for us 

187.78 189.34 A: right here 

188.62 189.99 B: yeah 

189.73 192.96 A: it was just so different and 

193.04 195.92 A: just so extremely scary 

195.59 210.24 B: and you know usually like when things that extreme happen i will watch them over and over and over but for some reason that after that day i didn't want to see that any more i didn't want to see it at the year anniversary i just didn't want to didn't want to see it any more 

204.93 205.97 A: you know 

209.16 211.67 A: you know and then i felt like 

212.30 218.72 A: i did see it more than one day but i was sort of felt like 

219.14 221.11 A: an obligation 

221.33 229.21 A: to the people that died like i would be turning my back on them if i didn't at least like make it a moment you know 

229.02 230.95 B: yeah like a memorial 

229.42 233.49 A: but then i had to turn it off after it's been on for fifteen or twenty minutes 

233.94 242.54 A: but i would always if it came on or something i would always just have to have like at least a moment just to remember the people 

242.59 244.40 B: just can- yeah 

242.77 245.99 A: that didn't know they were going to die when they went to work that day 

245.40 247.28 B: yeah 

246.22 251.20 A: and it was just such a horrific thing and it really hasn't i mean here 

251.23 254.03 A: we're not that far from two years away now 

254.36 255.40 A: you know 

255.85 259.51 A: wh- what a year and a half i guess we'll call it a year and a half 

259.68 262.49 B: (( that it happen well yeah yeah )) 

261.63 267.76 A: yeah it's been a year and a half and it still feels like it was yesterday afternoon in a way 

267.38 270.36 B: in a way yeah because of what we're doing now 

269.97 273.83 A: and then with the people that live there i can hardly even 

274.22 278.05 A: comprehend how it must be for them just having it down the street 

278.42 282.81 A: you know i did watch it i did watch the films more than once 

282.62 289.65 B: and i think you know i think that um you were saying that you had uh a greater increase in fear 

283.24 284.26 A: you know 

289.58 298.17 B: and i think that was the one thing that i refuse to do you know i they could blow me to kingdom come and back but they are not going to scare me it's just not going to work 

297.77 299.69 A: well i couldn't help it 

298.18 312.57 B: i mean it was just more with me it was just anger they made me extremely angry to the point where i was like you know what i couldn't care less if we just wiped out south east south east uh south east asia off the map period 

310.86 317.47 A: well they went and did their thing in afghanistan you know and we have family members that are still deployed there 

317.70 320.36 A: ourselves you know 

320.44 325.71 A: that are still part of that effort to make sure that they don't have any 

326.48 329.98 A: secrecy or way to store their weapons or anything 

329.67 331.20 B: yeah 

330.59 331.61 A: um 

331.75 337.06 A: so i do know people that are still over there in the service in the army 

337.54 344.09 A: and then they're i know they're still hunting and finding weapons caches and stuff and i think that's probably a good thing 

344.36 351.41 A: it it makes me feel i guess every time i hear about them destroying more of the weapons a little less dread 

351.04 353.55 B: yeah a little bit more relieved 

353.19 354.20 A: you know 

353.65 365.34 B: because you know it i felt also i kinda felt like okay with everything that went on after that it was kinda like swatting mosquitos okay you got this one here comes another one you got this one here comes another one you got this you know it's like is it ever going to stop 

361.45 362.83 A: yeah yeah 

364.79 367.63 A: but we're not sneaky people like that 

367.72 374.22 A: you know so it's so alien to americans was we fight our battles in the daytime 

374.24 382.30 A: out in front you know we're coming 'cause we give you lots of warning ahead and chances to change you ways and stuff you know 

381.85 383.75 B: yeah 

382.57 391.65 A: we do i mean we're not terror people and that's that's what makes me have a continued fear about terrorists is that they just they just don't care 

391.90 393.81 A: who they hurt or when 

391.98 399.75 B: no they don't they don't it it i mean and it could be from the two year old to the ninety two year old you know they're 

399.73 409.24 B: gonna take whoever they're gonna take and i think that's one of the reasons i've decided you know it wasn't going to alter my lifestyle you know still going to get on a plane train automobile whatever 

408.87 409.96 A: yeah 

409.24 414.74 B: because you know but i did say you know should that happen again while i'm on a plane 

414.92 416.79 B: i guess i'm gonna be the next 

416.86 418.40 A: oh yeah 

417.63 425.71 B: because [laughter] you know you know if if you if you don't bring a gun to the fight then i figure i got at least a fifty fifty chance 

418.51 421.12 A: yeah i hear you you know 

425.20 430.65 A: i really don't think that they're going to get away with that kind of thing again 

430.15 432.27 B: no i don't think so either 

431.23 435.86 A: because now we know we were we were sleeping but now we're watching 

435.47 436.76 B: mhm 

436.09 437.16 A: you know 

437.26 440.55 A: and i did feel kinda hyper vigilant you know 

440.17 442.27 B: yeah yeah i did too 

441.60 442.52 A: (( with it )) 

442.70 450.78 A: but i like i said i was just to stay at home and working and stuff and never really getting to travel or anything so it couldn't affect me like that so much 

451.28 453.15 A: and i guess people are kind of 

453.78 458.55 A: it's picked back up a little bit hasn't it people going places 

456.40 457.40 B: um 

457.96 466.51 B: oh yeah yeah it has picked up but you know i mean um and you know what it got me thinking you know is this the fall of america as a super power 

458.86 459.89 A: you know 

466.35 470.85 A: nah i mean no you got to wonder fir- at first but 

467.15 468.22 B: you know 

468.51 475.09 B: it's like if this if this were a start you know does it start with september eleventh and then you know think 

473.78 482.42 A: well that was a beginning of something big unless it goes back even farther and then the and the embassy bombings and everything were really the start 

482.59 485.48 A: you know during the during the clinton administration 

486.05 488.04 A: was a lot of stuff happened 

488.10 496.55 A: before he got out of office that they didn't retaliate for and i personally have felt like the republicans have been a lot firmer 

492.11 493.02 B: true 

497.11 501.06 B: oh yeah they're doing a they're they're scrappy that's definitely true 

497.55 499.04 A: since they've been in 

500.47 505.88 A: you know i mean i and and they keep doing what they need to do however they get criticized and 

505.99 509.45 A: i personally was not 

510.23 515.41 A: polarized so much one way or the other i'd rather vote for the person than the party 

515.02 516.90 B: yeah 

516.57 522.63 A: but i feel like they've really been i'm i'm really really glad it was their administration 

516.95 518.54 B: but you know that was like 

522.66 523.93 A: and not 

524.19 525.67 A: something weaker 

525.29 527.91 B: yeah i don't know if i could see gore 

528.07 529.10 B: um 

529.33 532.66 B: being taking this tough stance after september eleventh 

532.31 544.78 A: uh-huh no so you know and that's another thing i felt like is those people they feel like they're killing in the name of god and the god that i know never said to do anything such of a thing like that 

533.03 534.00 B: (( you know )) 

543.79 545.31 B: (( yeah i don't )) 

544.74 552.05 A: and i don't know why they don't seem to realize that we all come from the same place and we're all headed back to the same place ultimately 

552.25 553.28 A: you know 

553.00 560.72 B: and then it's you know it had me thinking too after september eleventh when they were saying that you know they see them leaving with a caravan of yukons 

560.53 570.06 B: and then you know this western thing and this western thing yet they they're blowing up our buildings because they hate us but they're driving our cars they're wearing our clothes they're eating mcdonalds you know 

569.33 571.86 A: they're they're worshipping your culture 

570.17 571.19 B: [laughter] 

571.99 573.06 B: so 

572.07 579.91 A: you know because we have i mean it's sort of uh on a kind of a sake freedom 

580.33 591.49 A: they're they're going to look at our culture and how we're allowed to speak and even encouraged you know to speak our minds and ain't nobody going to come and punish us for what we're saying here today 

586.39 587.44 B: mhm 

590.52 592.43 B: oh right right 

591.78 595.66 A: you know and that's the beauty of the place and it is worth fighting for 

595.89 596.95 A: you know 

595.96 596.80 B: yeah 

597.64 599.12 A: i feel like you know
