10.18 11.21 A: [noise] 

11.27 17.25 A: so i suppose we're supposed to talk about how um we've changed our life since september eleventh 

17.30 21.31 A: the incident that took place in oh one you wanna start and tell me 

17.44 18.39 B: (( yeah )) 

21.36 25.88 B: well um physically i haven't made any changes 

25.48 26.99 A: mhm 

26.32 29.60 B: mentally i've made a lot [laughter] 

28.83 30.74 A: okay how so 

30.29 37.19 B: um i used to be um very trusting [noise] and um very safe and secure 

37.45 38.49 B: feeling 

38.47 39.48 A: mhm 

39.11 42.01 B: and i am not any of them things anymore 

41.90 42.87 A: okay 

42.87 49.70 B: um i you know i'm pretty much on egg shells because now you you don't know anymore we've been invaded 

47.63 49.27 A: (( okay okay )) 

50.13 51.88 A: that's true that's true 

52.38 54.61 A: um for me 

55.02 59.25 A: it was a surprise and yet again it wasn't 

60.31 64.11 A: only because like i read the bible on a regular basis 

64.05 72.94 A: and one of the things that i learned was that jesus said there would be wars and reports of wars and see that you're not disturbed and that 

72.76 85.43 A: nation would rise up against nation it was just interesting because although i read that scripture many times i guess it didn't hit me that it would be right here in the united states i knew that they were warring in other countries 

85.30 97.08 A: (( and that they've done so like for years but it was just a surprise [noise] when it actually hit so close to home i live in philadelphia and it's you know for the planes to hit new york i mean that's not far at all )) 

97.10 108.60 A: so many of my friends were affected and there were fourteen people from my religion that were um either missing or declared dead and so that was 

107.23 108.26 B: oh 

108.55 114.74 A: (( that was very [noise] hard it was hard but one of the things )) 

114.78 126.20 A: (( that ah helped us all [noise] was in the bible [noise] in my car no i'm outside and the wind was blowing so i'm gonna get in the car )) 

117.90 118.87 B: oh is 

119.76 122.36 B: (( is this your phone or my phone )) 

125.76 127.33 B: oh [laughter] 

126.77 128.83 A: so you won't hear all that noise 

128.93 132.64 A: okay [laughter] so um 

129.54 131.15 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

132.62 138.37 A: i i know that it's important to be on guard and to be careful of my surroundings 

138.34 144.81 A: and i also know that reading the bible has proved to be true in many instances so in one way 

144.70 155.29 A: in a large way it has made me ah stronger in my faith and in another way it's just made me realise how vulnr- vulnerable we all very much are [laughter] 

154.78 162.43 B: we surely are none of us are infallible and um i didn't um i wasn't a real religious person 

157.70 159.18 A: exactly 

162.25 163.32 A: mhm 

164.04 168.51 B: but i was disabled that's i saw september eleventh on television 

168.46 169.38 A: okay 

168.92 173.55 B: i happened to be up and i saw the second plane hit and i was just mortified 

171.88 173.01 A: (( oh )) 

174.04 175.51 B: that that could happen 

175.44 176.97 A: yeah 

176.20 179.41 B: i think i was more angry that our government allowed it to happen 

179.28 181.08 A: okay okay 

180.04 181.51 B: because they knew 

181.77 186.06 A: i thought that was interesting when they showed like later clippings that 

186.07 196.84 A: you know there they had been warned they started to go out and do something and then they thought it was a false alarm and so they kinda went back home [laughter] like oh my goodness 

196.57 202.52 B: i think the united states is very lax in in things like we were just talking about that you know 

202.70 206.53 B: they're not that they're infallible that they can't be touched and i 

204.64 205.63 A: right 

205.92 207.05 A: right 

207.13 212.36 A: in this day and age i mean unfortunately it took something like that to happen but 

212.82 213.40 A: (( whew )) 

213.60 215.74 A: that was like really a hard blow 

214.85 218.05 B: think i think it could have been avoided um 

217.20 218.73 A: it could have 

218.13 224.87 B: they ultimately are responsible for coming over here and doing it but i blame our government for allowing it i think they knew 

225.28 228.97 A: (( mhm it was just a horrible horrible incident and )) 

227.43 232.29 B: it is a horrible thing and i think about them poor people almost every day 

231.14 232.10 A: yeah 

232.18 233.22 A: (( yes )) 

232.69 239.29 B: that lost loved ones and and just the domino effect that it had on people's lives and 

234.46 235.71 A: mhm 

238.75 240.07 A: yeah 

239.49 242.14 B: it's just a awful awful thing 

242.09 253.17 A: because one of my friends in fact we have the same name [laughter] her name is yolanda also she was explaining to me that um she was running late for work 

253.47 256.14 A: and she's usually never late for work 

256.21 266.15 A: and then after she got to work she left the building [laughter] she said she'd never leave the building 'cause there's so many things that she could get while she's inside she but she left the building 

266.10 278.85 A: to get something and then when she went as she was approaching the building again she saw the first plane hit not the building where she worked but the second one and she just couldn't believe it and she kinda just stood there like in shock 

278.79 288.29 A: she said and then you know everybody of course was like oh my god what happened this that and the other and then the second plane hit she said and she knew that that was no accident 

288.72 299.91 A: and you know the first one like many people said the first one you think wow i can't believe it happened second one she said she knew it was no accident so as she was trying to run in the opposite direction because she didn't know what to then expect 

299.83 306.61 A: she said the crowds were like pushing her forward to where you know the incident took place she said it didn't seem like 

306.62 316.36 A: she said it didn't matter how fast she was running it seemed like they were just pulling her back you know and she she saw so many things that television did not reveal 

316.25 323.39 A: like the people that fell out of those that were jumping out of those windows were on fire and it was just devastating 

318.32 319.87 B: the trauma 

320.97 321.94 B: oh 

323.50 325.66 A: to see another human being 

325.55 340.44 A: on fire and then the people she knew that she worked with were in those buildings like i said we're jehovah's witnesses so we knew that there were other members of our religious affiliation there and it was just so traumatic it was so traumatic 

339.63 345.62 B: oh my heart goes out to her i'll never take public transportation in any form ever 

345.56 357.54 A: well you know what i was always afraid of flying because i i was like i never even thought of terrorists i was just afraid of flying because there's no like air patrol in the event that the plane goes down you're going 

357.39 360.53 B: thank you that's what i always said you're going down [laughter] 

358.01 359.08 A: (( down )) 

359.86 371.33 A: but you know [laughter] i mean if you're in a car accident of course somebody could come and help you out whether they're you know with the police the fire a a citizen could come and help you out but a plane 

369.65 372.87 B: that's what i always said if i break down i can walk 

372.62 385.92 A: right but you know a plane is something different but in light of what has happened september eleventh it's like you don't even know what to expect forget the plane falling down you gotta worry about somebody's gonna you know threaten your life 

385.61 391.66 B: absolutely i know that i'll never take public transportation so travelling for me is out 

386.10 387.08 A: so 

391.47 392.57 A: mhm 

391.91 396.98 B: um [laughter] and it doesn't hurt my feelings i'd rather stay home and be safe 

393.04 394.43 A: [laughter] 

396.66 397.69 A: (( mhm )) 

397.19 398.20 B: um 

397.70 400.09 A: or walk or get in your own car 

399.61 403.38 B: i figure with my luck i'd be on the plane that they terrorized 

402.81 404.35 A: exactly right 

403.91 407.68 B: (( [laughter] yes )) 

404.66 406.04 A: [laughter] 

407.15 412.81 A: oh my that's just such an awful thing i was kind of um pleased though 

412.87 416.35 A: um last year when that time came 

416.36 418.57 A: they didn't like 

419.72 423.01 A: sometimes a person could be in a process of healing 

423.13 424.41 A: and then 

424.55 435.99 A: i thought maybe they were gonna overdo it and just replay all of the devastating scenes over and over again and that would just hurt all the grieving families but i think they were a bit more considerate 

435.76 441.80 B: up here and see up here we saw it different i'm from maine well i'm from new hampshire but i live in maine 

439.54 440.44 A: (( oh okay )) 

440.82 441.62 A: okay 

441.74 442.46 A: okay 

442.05 446.02 B: and um we really felt that they overkilled it up here 

445.94 447.42 A: okay okay 

446.43 449.94 B: we were all complaining up here enough enough already 

449.60 451.24 A: oh right right 

450.25 458.24 B: you know you can't look at the little kids crying anymore you can't look at the parents crying anymore how you know it was just awful day after day all day long 

458.11 467.18 A: oh my see it was a little a little better here i don't know what they they they did in new york but it was just a little better here 

467.39 469.09 A: oh no i don't know i don't 

469.41 470.34 B: it 

469.81 484.26 A: know 'cause 'cause i was hoping like on the radio i was hoping that they didn't play the last conversations of some of the loved ones that died over and over again because i just think that that would hinder anybody who's trying to heal 

483.48 490.81 B: to heal absolutely that was what we were saying you know how many times do the families have to watch all this on the television 

489.93 491.70 A: mhm mhm 

491.00 500.04 B: and we don't even have cable up here and every channel all day long for weeks that's all there was it was just awful 

492.94 493.75 A: uh-huh 

498.26 499.21 A: see that's 

499.37 500.96 A: (( not good that's not good )) 

500.94 507.59 B: yeah i didn't it got to the point where i didn't pick up a newspaper i didn't pick up a magazine i just couldn't take it anymore 

507.40 508.45 A: yeah 

507.63 512.20 B: um the morning i i cried all day long the morning i watched it 

512.13 513.03 A: (( yeah )) 

512.59 514.15 B: it was just awful 

514.18 523.63 A: 'cause it was like when it happened it was so devastating whether people were there knew people that were there or not it was just so devastating that it was as if 

523.53 532.58 A: the entire united states was just closed you know what i mean like like for days for weeks that's all we thought of 

529.72 531.34 B: right and it's not like 

531.78 539.57 B: it's not like it was an accident you know an accidental fire or anything which would have been bad enough in its own right but 

534.05 535.07 A: right 

536.64 538.64 A: (( right it was deliberate )) 

539.15 540.14 A: right 

539.59 545.30 B: to have done the way that it was done i- is just mortifying to me it's 

545.54 548.92 B: i never thought about it happening over here you know what i mean 

548.68 549.81 A: yeah 

549.33 552.83 B: vietnam world war one world war two korean war 

553.20 557.81 B: it's all over there in another planet in my mind you know 

557.25 557.85 A: (( yeah )) 

558.01 559.07 A: and then 

558.02 559.06 B: and now 

559.39 572.23 A: and i think too like there was another plane crash but it wa- it was said that it didn't have anything to do with you know terrorist attacks but another plane crash in new york like shortly after that it was like how many more 

572.45 576.53 A: things can that city or the people that reside there take 

576.14 582.57 B: i don't have a lot of faith in our government and i don't believe almost anything i believe almost nothing that they say 

583.18 584.39 B: and i know that 

583.27 584.86 A: (( i can understand why )) 

584.90 595.35 B: that's you know a lot of people tell me i'm very cynical i need to have more faith i need to think more positive and i just can't bring myself to do that when i've watched the track record 

594.71 599.89 A: well i'm going to tell you i you know i understand from the bible that we have to
