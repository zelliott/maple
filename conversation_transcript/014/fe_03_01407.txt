335.13 341.99 A: like travel i don't do a whole lot of traveling but i have been places like now i am just uh 

338.52 339.48 B: mhm 

341.96 353.86 A: uh more aware of like people in my surroundings like if i'm like was in a bus station and i'm going to new york you know i take the bus or take the train up to new york to go hang out with some friends for awhile 

345.05 347.14 B: right yea- good point 

354.40 362.72 A: for the day or whatever um you know i am more aware like when i see people just kind of leave bags around and that kind of thing uh

365.31 377.85 B: been on a train 'cause i'm thinking i don't know how i would feel if i actually sat in a plane i i guess i'd be looking around you know like okay is this the one but um you know since i don't do it i don't even have that to really go on well 

371.14 371.89 A: (( mm )) 

377.04 382.00 A: when you say heaven forbid they'd be wearing a turban or something isn't it horrible

389.89 391.64 A: yeah 

390.78 399.05 B: it's got to be awful for them and it isn't fair but uh but i i know if i would see that it'd be like can i have a different plane you know and i guess that's not fair but 

392.91 393.67 A: (( mm )) 

397.16 398.66 A: mhm 

399.07 402.67 B: um but i think yeah like that i mean you made a great point about 

402.13 403.12 A: mhm

409.02 421.77 A: no no no not at all i mean you know because you see my thing is is that if something is gonna happen it's gonna happen and there's not a whole lot that you can do to stop it 

416.12 416.95 B: yeah 

417.19 418.00 B: yeah 

419.89 420.74 B: right 

421.37 422.20 B: right 

421.61 430.24 A: um it's best that you kind of have yourself in a position and in a mindset where you can quickly marshal the necessary 

430.12 438.32 A: resources or forces however you wanna put it um to kind of get things uh back to where they used to be you know functioning at a at an optimum 

432.02 433.02 B: right 

435.51 436.95 B: right right 

438.16 439.17 B: i agree 

438.53 440.80 A: (( so uh you know ))
