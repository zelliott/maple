297.91 298.73 B: and

304.56 305.65 A: yeah 

305.77 307.13 A: [mn] i know some 

305.79 307.83 B: what i expect spring to be 

307.45 310.81 A: yeah i know some of our friends down here uh 

310.89 322.60 A: had started looking in you know after nine eleven had started looking into the uh treatments for the anthrax and stuff like that but i don't uh i didn't do that go that far 

318.49 319.34 B: did they 

322.81 328.06 A: and i knew a k- few people that uh you know went as far as getting gas masks and things but

328.40 342.73 A: i just uh i live in the country i got alligators for neighbors you know [laughter] yeah a bear come and got our trash yesterday morning [laughter] and carried it off carried it off in the woods [laughter] so i figure you know they'd

336.75 337.95 B: really 

339.57 340.63 B: uh-huh

348.21 349.22 B: right 

349.66 353.67 B: right which we really thought chicago would be a target 

353.50 354.86 A: yeah 

354.24 358.45 B: and uh my husband's a driver too but he drives local 

358.34 359.37 A: (( mhm ))

371.18 372.10 A: yeah 

374.62 376.02 A: yeah 

375.39 382.73 B: and then it was very strange since we're so close to the airport that there were no planes for a week or so 

376.98 377.56 A: (( [noise] )) 

383.06 389.86 A: [noise] uh that was another thing too is the the small air- airc- airports were shut down and things of that sort you know it was

391.42 392.41 B: right 

391.73 400.96 A: you know it was like everybody was just waiting for something to happen instead of uh [noise] you know i guess americans just go on as their business you know 

400.91 401.81 B: right 

401.07 403.40 A: and and don't really dwell on uh
