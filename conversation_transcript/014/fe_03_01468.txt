160.69 169.42 A: i didn't find it to be as crowded as it normally would've been you know 'cause a lot of things had been cancelled because of the war also 

164.17 164.95 B: (( mm )) 

166.86 167.97 B: yeah 

168.60 171.55 B: mhm mhm [lipsmack]

173.79 183.18 B: right well and see we're supposed to go somewhere in in august uh for a wedding actually and i'm thinking oh i don't know if i can do it 

182.59 183.90 A: mhm 

183.20 188.01 B: whereas before you know i wouldn't i wouldn't hesitate to fly 

184.83 186.50 A: you would just do it [mn] 

187.70 188.77 A: right 

188.15 189.63 B: but now 

189.98 198.12 B: that part as far as my life i you know i think twice about but towards anything else i i just go on with i don't worry about 

196.50 197.45 A: (( mhm )) 

198.78 204.45 B: you know something being on the sidewalk or you know i i just go on but flying 

201.66 202.51 A: (( mhm )) 

205.14 211.68 B: that i think twice about now you know since we we have to go somewhere [laughter] but um 

209.43 210.50 A: yeah 

210.76 214.71 A: i guess because you know it's a thing like this you just 

215.51 229.17 A: i enjoy taking trips and i know that you really gotta just go on with your life and you know what's gonna happen is gonna happen i feel you know and you just can't stop living because of these things 

217.27 218.40 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

224.83 226.97 B: i i n- yeah 

228.51 230.20 B: true true 

230.27 231.04 B: see 

230.31 236.43 A: and all our kids are grown too so we said well we're together so if anything happened at least we'll be together 

234.27 235.19 B: yeah 

235.87 240.99 B: yeah see we have two little ones we have a two year old and a two month old so i think 

237.52 238.42 A: (( yeah )) 

239.40 242.94 A: mhm so that makes you more skeptical about things 

241.44 245.80 B: right exactly so i say [laughter] 

243.70 249.95 A: yeah when your kids are grown you know it's a thing like this well you're just gonna go head on and live your life and enjoy 

249.41 250.88 B: mhm 

249.85 262.15 A: and you've made so many sacrifices in your life already you feel that when god comes and gets you he's gonna come and get you regardless you know you just have to step out on faith and just go head on [mn] 

253.36 254.28 B: yeah 

257.97 259.62 B: true true 

261.54 265.50 B: i know and that's what you know i'm at the point now i'm thinking okay 

266.26 279.24 B: [lipsmack] well you know if it was just me and my husband then it'd be like okay i can do this but my children well you know i'm thinking oh no no no we'll just have to drive [laughter] 

270.56 271.48 A: yeah 

271.90 272.87 A: mhm 

275.16 276.17 A: right 

277.38 283.02 A: mhm yeah it makes you different when you have little ones to worry about 

281.33 286.79 B: mhm yeah yeah so in that that part i 

287.18 295.31 B: you know i'm thinking twice about but anything else it's just everyday i just go on as usual um [noise] [sigh] 

290.55 292.44 A: life as u- yeah 

293.06 294.07 A: mhm 

295.77 304.90 A: i can imagine the people that live in new york i know they probably still very shook up over it which i would feel the same way if it had been in chicago somewhere 

296.33 296.97 B: (( i )) 

299.18 300.17 B: yeah 

300.69 301.62 B: (( sure )) 

302.49 303.97 B: mhm 

304.08 305.97 B: mhm 

305.34 316.65 A: and you know and it makes you w- and i always wonder since i don't live in the downtown sector i always say well if these things are gonna happen they gonna hit buildings downtown 

316.16 317.47 B: mhm 

316.71 320.23 A: first you know or near the airport 

317.76 319.04 B: yeah 

320.17 325.06 B: well see may nineteenth we had oh april nineteenth we had the bombing here 

324.63 325.81 A: mhm 

325.17 328.53 B: in uh ninety five um 

326.89 328.05 A: right 

328.77 330.13 B: [lipsmack] and um 

331.15 334.33 B: i didn't even think with that 

334.69 342.05 B: i i still don't i don't remember changing my routine really all that much even during that you know and it was here 

338.54 339.48 A: mhm 

341.99 342.90 A: right 

342.08 343.04 B: um 

343.72 344.53 B: i 

344.83 348.29 B: i think i've just you know learned or just you know 

348.60 350.11 B: just went on 

349.56 352.65 A: yeah i mean it's kinda hard to 

350.12 351.36 B: just went on 

352.67 354.53 A: to stop your life 

353.96 359.12 B: right and i didn't have anyone you know affected by it as far as in the bombing 

357.34 358.48 A: mhm 

358.98 367.74 A: yeah you didn't know anyone personally either you know i- it makes a difference i think when you have people it's the same way like when the war started 

359.14 360.56 B: (( so that ma- )) 

360.61 361.59 B: right 

361.94 362.90 B: right 

363.16 364.49 B: mhm 

367.87 371.43 A: i feel sorry for the families that got 

371.46 376.67 A: you know have children and especially families that have two children in the war 

372.97 374.03 B: mhm 

375.53 377.29 B: right right 

376.64 387.26 A: but when it doesn't affect you and your immediate family the only thing you can do is to pray for the safe return of all the other people but you just can't really stop [lipsmack] 

380.49 381.87 B: mhm 

382.79 383.83 B: right 

384.47 385.50 B: right 

387.70 393.63 A: you know i mean you just can't get yourself in a tizzy over and so you you'd be a nervous wreck 

390.75 391.85 B: mhm 

392.97 395.64 B: [lipsmack] oh yeah oh yes yeah 

394.83 406.78 A: you have to grip yourself and like i tell people that you just have to trust in god and trust your faith and you know and all this is i feel this really in his hands you know 

401.87 403.23 B: mhm 

406.09 411.75 B: y- yeah and a lot of this i mean this w- the war the bombings 

412.06 427.03 B: you know they make you think twice about how strong your faith is how strong you know um and i think that's why you know some people are able to go on and just you know well if it happens it happens 

416.44 417.39 A: right 

423.06 424.15 A: mhm 

426.38 427.82 A: yes that's right 

427.46 437.69 B: you know and and and it's like for myself i'm at that point where you know my everyday life i'm just you know if it happens it happens but then when it comes to flying 

434.80 436.04 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

437.88 447.98 B: something i have no control over whatsoever you know i just sit in there you know it makes me think i know okay i know i know my faith is strong [laughter] 

440.14 441.36 A: right you don't 

442.02 443.22 A: (( right yes )) 

447.02 453.45 A: you're right but you're still your han- y- your life is like in someone else's hands too 

452.00 458.47 B: right yeah yeah [laughter] yeah so 

454.06 456.22 A: and that's what makes you so scared 

457.91 466.95 A: and then you hear these things about the airlines that they drink and you know and i know all these people are humans just like the rest of us 

462.66 464.24 B: mhm 

466.05 467.23 B: sure 

466.83 475.99 A: and all of them have problems in their lives just like we all have problems and a lot of people feel that drinking or taking drugs or 

476.01 480.25 A: you know artificial things like that is gonna pacify them and 

479.57 481.21 B: mhm 

480.61 485.26 A: even though they feel that they're in control they're not in control 

484.26 486.04 B: no no 

486.28 491.01 A: and that's the sad thing a- about it that you have to 

486.60 487.47 B: (( no )) 

491.78 497.58 A: step out and let other people take control of you you know in your life 

493.88 495.19 B: mhm 

496.19 498.97 B: yeah right right 

497.69 499.92 A: that's the scary thing about it 

499.51 508.94 B: it is it is i mean like driving around you know i'm driving and you know that's sorta i'm i'm in control of my car but in a airplane [sigh] 

501.09 502.34 A: it makes you 

504.31 505.12 A: mhm 

506.99 510.70 A: yeah but you don't know about the other person and their driving 

509.02 511.63 B: that's true that's true 

510.85 516.31 A: because people have been killed you know just going to a simple place 

513.57 515.07 B: mhm 

515.14 516.79 B: sure sure 

517.05 520.41 A: and i- there's so many things to be fearful of 

517.19 518.08 B: yeah 

519.93 522.46 B: yeah yeah

533.20 537.72 B: mhm well you wouldn't i don't think you know i wouldn't enjoy life 

537.44 538.43 A: right 

537.84 544.52 B: if i was walking around now because of the you know the bombings or the airplane crash i- you know 

544.01 544.92 A: (( mhm )) 

544.54 548.03 B: i i wouldn't be enjoying life if i was just

591.90 593.83 B: mhm yeah 

593.00 596.94 A: and they have to have some kind of measure to do it
