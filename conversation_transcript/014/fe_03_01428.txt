47.41 48.19 A: (( by )) 

50.06 52.37 A: it it was indescribable 

51.78 53.00 B: (( yeah i bet ))

60.30 61.31 A: again 

61.62 73.35 B: um how has i i guess we're we need to [mn] talk about the the question of the phone call so have you made any different types of changes because of that or

72.51 80.77 A: things are different now my well my husband was working in manhattan at the time he was working in lower manhattan and he will never do that again 

80.41 81.43 B: okay 

81.03 83.33 A: so that's a big [laughter] change in our life 

82.06 84.29 B: interesting yeah 

84.11 85.38 A: um 

85.26 91.74 B: for fur- fear that it's too much of still of the attraction site of of where it's the location that it could happen 

90.78 96.66 A: well you know he never really liked commuting into manhattan to begin with because it took about 

96.81 107.87 A: um it was a long commute um because the public transportation in our town is not great so he had to drive to the train station and then take one train and then another train 

98.95 100.29 B: mhm 

107.88 122.07 A: and um he he felt that it was very very crowded he took the he used to take a train to the world trade centre station and um he didn't feel comfortable with the fact that there were huge crowds there and um 

122.04 123.84 A: and it [mn] 

124.81 125.49 B: (( mhm mm )) 

125.06 133.04 A: he was wondering at the time you know was it worth it and um he he's decided now that it's not worth it so 

127.65 128.71 B: right 

132.44 138.38 B: right i don't blame him yeah i i i think uh that's a big part of it too when you're 

138.41 151.11 B: very near and when you're doing that and then something like the september eleventh incident happens i you probably just look at it in a whole different way and say nope close to home 

148.51 149.65 A: right 

150.79 152.12 A: yeah yes 

151.35 154.42 B: be with family be closer to home and 

153.42 157.42 A: yeah and um we haven't flown anywhere since then 

157.01 159.20 B: (( yeah okay )) 

157.59 160.23 A: also how about you have you flown anywhere 

160.10 163.57 B: no although uh you know we don't 

164.46 173.52 B: get out much as it is yet i have young children still we don't really travel or anything all my family is is basically here in ohio 

167.99 168.89 A: (( okay okay okay )) 

173.78 182.76 B: and uh you know us being a little more distant from new york of course um i don't have any direct relations there 

182.81 195.42 B: um to have affected me as directly as it has with people like yourself and other people who are more directly related uh you know to people were who who were involved at that 

188.24 189.15 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

195.43 197.47 B: ah but it sure makes you think a lot 

197.27 200.32 A: do you think you're less likely to travel abroad yeah me 

200.34 214.14 B: yes probably ah or or more wary of it and i must say within this past year whether it was friends or family i've known who have had to travel uh the reluctance was very big 

201.69 202.95 A: too yeah me too 

213.70 214.72 A: mhm 

214.17 218.93 B: and almost waiting to the last minute well do we go or not type of thing 

218.54 219.57 A: mhm 

218.97 222.32 B: and um yeah i ah 

222.66 225.38 B: i would prefer to travel like well first of all 

225.40 232.07 B: [laughter] i would just think it would feel safer or um just not travel at all really right now 

225.76 226.98 A: mhm 

231.65 232.82 A: mhm 

232.22 240.57 B: and uh knowing that we don't have any big plans anyway to you know do something it's like mm why even think about it then 

240.26 241.17 A: mhm 

241.17 244.57 B: um as far as um you know 

244.60 251.44 B: just wondering yo- you see on t._v. these different alerts now that they have the orange the yellow you know how it changes 

251.45 256.07 B: i don't think anybody ever really knows i don't i don't know how the government can ever 

254.16 254.98 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

256.11 259.70 B: obviously you can't prepare anybody you just don't know 

259.36 260.27 A: mhm 

260.03 267.91 B: and i think you know ever since that incident probably more than ever it- it's always whenever we do something 

267.85 277.09 B: or just regular events in general i think you appreciate it more and you think about it more take things on the lighter side um 

277.29 280.08 B: yeah it's it's a little bit different attitude i think 

280.37 285.29 A: i've also been in contact with some people that i probably would not be in contact with 

284.96 286.88 B: right oh i bet 

285.49 291.44 A: if it hadn't of happened i got i got email from people i went to college with saying are you okay 

291.15 293.06 B: oh wow that's great 

291.90 295.90 A: so um i'm more likely to touch base with people and 

295.31 296.59 B: sure 

295.97 299.59 A: and you know keep track of them and let them know what i'm up to 

298.36 309.44 B: yeah yeah it brings back more uh that that that human warmth i suppose where wow you think about somebody and it's like you know let's just give a call let's just you know 

308.49 311.81 A: mhm yeah that's it i've definitely been doing that more 

311.02 324.41 B: yeah yeah and where in the past maybe we were just so busy with your our everyday life it's you know for a while there you just seem to let things go you know just run run here there just do everything just the fast track is always overcoming you know 

319.04 319.89 A: yeah 

324.06 325.16 A: mhm 

324.97 326.34 B: but um 

326.36 336.77 B: but yeah i i would say ever since that incident and now with the war too it's i have a nephew that's um over in iraq right now and he's on our mind constantly 

336.38 337.35 A: mm 

337.20 338.77 B: you know and so 

339.07 347.77 B: anything we d- do around here that's family event related you know you just start thinking of where he is and why he's there and uh 

347.87 351.72 B: it just gets you thinking that uh you know as a whole 

352.51 358.16 B: where government and the world is concerned it's um it's an interesting uh huh 

358.28 359.11 B: you know 

359.14 363.24 B: time of our lives right now i guess just nev- never know what to uh 

360.65 361.83 A: mhm 

363.52 366.64 B: to think and you're always kinda like watching your back sometimes 

366.29 367.36 A: yeah 

366.79 370.22 B: we're definitely more wary of what's going on i think 

369.75 370.69 A: mhm 

370.34 375.41 B: yeah yeah do you have uh young kids any kids 

374.78 377.85 A: i have one son he's six years old 

377.31 384.14 B: oh okay yeah yeah and i bet he's a big concern of yours of course whatever he does wherever he goes 

381.34 382.36 A: yeah 

384.97 389.33 B: do you feel like yourself more than ever you're keeping tabs on him a little 

389.20 403.26 A: i i think i've always been cautious about that sort of thing so i don't think there's anything that i'm doing differently with him i think it's it's more like things that i do differently with the whole family like the fact that we're travelling less 

393.76 394.72 B: mhm 

400.58 401.63 B: yeah 

402.98 404.98 B: yeah yeah 

405.18 406.12 B: yeah 

406.57 413.53 B: yeah i have uh two boys that are in school ages nine and seven and then i have a two year old daughter 

413.74 414.95 B: and uh 

415.11 417.35 B: i know that even in school 

417.51 422.87 B: [noise] they uh bring it up once in a great while [noise] 

422.93 436.28 B: like the administration of [noise] we always have some type of plan you know be assured that we're we're trying to take care of everybody as best we could and try not to panic you know that type of thing 

428.25 429.71 A: (( mhm mhm like a mhm )) 

433.60 434.72 A: mhm 

436.17 439.93 B: because when that did happen on september eleventh my 

440.16 443.35 B: husband i happened to both be home 

443.39 452.20 B: and very interesting how he felt with it right away was let's just go get our kids out of school you know just really like 

449.37 450.24 A: uh-huh 

451.27 452.29 A: interesting 

452.21 459.75 B: yeah and i was more like well but this you know that's uh an incident that's many miles away and 

459.77 469.89 B: you know [noise] but but there's you know a difference of opinion and what what your ideas are but no matter what you worry you know it's like in one respect you don't [noise] want to panic but in the other sense 

464.62 465.48 A: yeah 

465.94 466.81 A: yeah 

469.79 470.73 A: yeah 

470.09 472.99 B: um you can't help but worry about it 

472.70 473.59 A: yeah 

474.14 475.43 B: but um 

475.76 479.72 B: yeah it's sad in this world today [noise] that things like that are 

479.75 483.43 B: bound to happen and who knows it could happen again 

481.11 482.78 A: yeah i know people 

482.79 486.83 A: right like schools didn't have really an emergency plan before 

486.53 487.60 B: right 

486.84 490.83 A: and now everybody realizes that that's something very important to have 

489.50 494.25 B: [noise] right right yeah [noise] 

491.43 494.90 A: to plan for emergencies that are really unthinkable 

495.07 498.27 B: right exactly and i think more than ever too 

498.51 508.47 B: the way we try to keep [noise] in contact with each other as a family [noise] with our kids i remember last year i was almost going to get rid of my own personal cell phone and now [noise] 

508.56 514.72 B: it's oh you know i think maybe i will hold on to it [laughter] just never know where i'll be or 

511.83 512.81 A: mhm 

514.31 515.32 A: mhm 

515.01 522.91 B: who might need to call me [noise] okay abby hold on it's a popsicle tragedy right here okay sorry about that

525.88 527.91 B: (( so )) 

528.14 528.99 B: [mn] 

528.39 532.29 A: i know quite a people quite a few people who have made career changes 

532.20 534.00 B: oh yeah 

532.63 545.51 A: um since then um there's uh a guy who was a local politician he was going to run again he decided to retire to spend more time with his family so there are a lot of people in my area who are doing that 

543.70 544.84 B: wow 

544.88 547.54 B: (( yeah yeah i bet )) 

547.86 551.72 B: uh which is almost scary too because it's uh 

552.20 553.14 B: you know 

553.58 562.80 B: you wonder who's going to cover certain spots that nobody wants to cover any more [laughter] you know to take care of certain things and it's look at the reason why you know 

562.51 563.47 A: yeah 

562.90 567.01 B: like how do you fi- refill these uh these gaps then if uh 

567.18 573.28 B: everybody's trying to be cautious it's like okay who's gonna take on some of these roles that you know were 

573.63 578.39 B: either more life threatening or chancy risky 

578.11 579.15 A: right 

578.59 591.50 B: so yeah especially in in your area there i bet that's there's a lot of change constant with that wow and how is the new mayor doing with the aftermath of everything 

584.02 585.15 A: yeah 

591.92 593.64 A: well um i 

592.32 593.32 B: i wonder
