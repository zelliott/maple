10.77 12.17 A: i'm doing good how are you 

12.00 16.57 B: i'm fine what changes have you made since september eleventh or have you made any 

17.09 18.15 A: (( um )) 

18.38 22.08 A: i don't really feel like i've made too much too many changes actually ah 

22.25 23.81 A: (( the only thing i feel ah )) 

25.04 32.72 A: i feel that when i go to the airport that ah i've probably been a little bit more cautious than normal but other than that nothing really what about yourself 

33.02 35.22 B: no sir i really haven't i've 

35.72 41.39 B: i mean i just you know try to tell you know if i have people travelling you know out of town i 

41.42 48.13 B: you know i tend to be more aware of where they're going you know when they'll be back and you know such and such stuff but 

45.79 46.59 A: (( yeah )) 

48.14 51.60 B: no not much i haven't really changed 

51.78 53.94 A: yeah i don't think i have either i think i've 

54.58 65.94 A: now with the situation in iraq and everything that ah and it might be escalating and there might be more reason to change and more reason to change your behaviour now just because i think people might be a little bit more incensed with the situation than they were 

65.99 67.75 A: (( beforehand )) 

67.42 68.46 B: yes sir 

68.44 69.72 A: yeah 

71.21 74.56 B: i've never liked to fly [laughter] never 

73.37 75.48 A: [laughter] never 

74.72 75.49 B: [laughter] 

75.75 76.96 B: i don't know if i'll 

75.78 77.26 A: i love to fly so 

77.45 79.46 B: i don't know if i'll ever fly 

79.80 80.63 A: (( mm )) 

80.74 82.36 B: it just scares me 

82.41 86.03 B: even before september eleventh i i've never like to fly i 

86.22 92.76 B: was scared it was gonna the plane was gonna crash or something [laughter] and it's always really terrified me 

88.86 90.17 A: [laughter] 

91.43 92.30 A: yeah 

93.47 98.26 A: i guess one change i have made is i've been a little bit more cautious in my life with regards to 

98.61 101.33 A: i guess what i say and stuff in public 'cause i'm 

101.39 110.28 A: i'm of i'm ind- i'm of indian descent like my parents were from india but i look i would look you know upon appearance just like any person from that whole arab region 

105.35 106.17 B: (( yeah )) 

110.58 111.53 B: (( yes sir )) 

110.87 111.79 A: (( so um )) 

112.05 123.88 A: there are times you know when i'm at airports that i might not say something that i would say like maybe state my opinion on ah the war or something like that just as a fear of you know what repercussions might occur based on who's listening and things like that 

124.68 126.27 B: i know people 

126.48 130.74 B: i think september eleventh was more of a wake up call than anything 

130.88 132.10 A: yeah 

131.52 133.47 B: to wake america up [lipsmack] 

133.99 135.35 B: i really do 

134.02 135.32 A: yeah it really was 

136.89 141.18 A: yeah i feel america kind of lives in its own little bubble most of the time 

140.84 143.87 B: people don't realise how lucky they are to live in america 

143.91 145.33 A: exactly 

144.74 146.16 B: they really don't 

146.12 154.76 A: 'cause in the rest of the world you know you have so many countries that are close to each other whereas in america you have canada in the north and mexico in the south and then miles and miles of ocean on either side 

154.62 155.82 B: yes sir [sigh] 

156.15 159.08 A: so there's not really much contact you know with outside cultures 

159.24 167.26 A: other than immigrants that move here from other countries and basically after they have their first or second generation their children are pretty much assimilated to american culture anyway so 

170.50 172.10 B: i know it's just 

172.84 174.49 B: it's unbelievable 

176.59 179.78 B: the different things that are happening in america today 

179.86 181.22 A: yeah 

180.83 190.83 B: you look at the war you look at september eleventh for an example you look at how many lives are being taken every day and just 

190.87 192.54 B: so much stuff 

192.44 193.25 A: (( mm )) 

196.83 198.35 B: but [sigh] 

200.00 201.33 A: mm do you feel that 

200.20 203.87 B: how long has it been since september eleventh about two years 

204.09 205.43 A: (( since september eleventh )) 

205.25 206.13 B: yes sir 

206.23 208.09 B: has it been about two years 

208.28 210.13 A: yeah about a year and half yeah 

209.40 211.05 B: year and a half okay 

212.59 218.99 B: that's right i don't know why i was thinking it was two years but it was a year in september and then this year it'll be two years 

218.76 219.54 A: (( have )) 

222.35 224.12 B: [sigh] [mn] 

223.13 226.96 A: you heard of what they're gonna do with new york on the plaza over there 

227.60 230.97 A: are they are they gonna be building a memorial or anything like that 

230.39 233.78 B: um i think so um they're they're um 

234.18 235.61 B: looking at different 

235.79 239.32 B: models of what they're gonna build and 

239.43 248.74 B: they're trying to decide i think that they have come to a conclusion to do um like the twin towers but have them like a swirl 

246.49 247.41 A: mhm 

249.27 250.65 B: (( you see what i'm saying )) 

250.39 251.69 A: yeah 

251.31 256.02 B: i think that's what they're gonna do but i'm not real sure i've seen so many different designs of it 

256.02 257.78 A: mhm 

257.73 258.56 B: (( [mn] )) 

258.68 261.47 B: my mother in law just got back from up there 

261.62 262.99 A: (( oh mm )) 

261.65 269.09 B: she went to new york but she got back the day the war the war started i think it was the fifteenth she got no 

269.17 275.65 B: when did she get back ah wednesday it was wednesday that the war started she got back that day 

275.37 276.63 A: (( mm oh okay [laughter] )) 

276.42 282.02 B: it was scary i didn't want to go to the airport [laughter] i didn't even want to go to the airport 

278.70 279.87 A: mhm 

282.19 288.63 A: did she say anything about the like the attitude of the new yorkers or anything like that given the war and everything that's going on there mm 

288.06 297.33 B: she said um that it was a lot different up there than it was down here people up there are more of aware of what goes on than they are down here 

297.20 298.15 A: mhm 

297.40 303.33 B: because you know september eleventh happened in new york you know well not just in new york but pennsylvania you know 

303.18 304.44 A: (( yeah mm )) 

303.35 310.93 B: but most of it was in new york and um they said that they have a lot of opinions on things that have happened 

311.13 312.42 A: yeah 

311.84 319.38 B: you know where we don't think i mean memphis and austin texas you know that's a little ways apart but 

319.20 320.33 A: yeah 

319.73 334.09 B: i don't feel that something would happen here as quick as it would happen in new york but see we don't know you know in memphis you got the pyramid you've got the humun- that huge bridge downtown you've got 

324.68 325.88 A: (( exactly mm )) 

335.26 339.18 B: the naval base the big naval base in millington 

339.82 342.63 B: you know we just have a lot of stuff down here but 

343.62 347.51 B: [sigh] you just never know what's gonna happen and when it's gonna happen 

348.20 349.42 A: (( yeah you don't )) 

348.31 352.95 B: just like september eleventh nobody knew you know that that day was gonna come 

352.74 354.09 A: mhm 

353.63 355.16 B: and just think though 

355.17 363.30 B: what if what if it hadda happened like say eleven o'clock twelve o'clock noon instead of eight thirty in the morning 

363.70 369.89 B: you know just think how many more people would have been in them two buildings than they were that morning 

367.24 368.69 A: mhm yeah exactly 

369.72 370.98 A: yeah 

371.53 373.86 B: you know that's just the way i look at it 

373.58 385.67 A: yeah like i i'm a student actually at the university of texas here and they've beefed up security around here immensely because of it because ah one of george bush's daughters actually attends school here 

385.79 387.67 A: and then ah we are probably 

387.55 390.78 A: a stone's throw away from the capitol you can see the buildings from 

390.67 404.48 A: all our dorms and from campus and everything and like we're the nation's one of the nation's largest universities so they think that they were saying that we probably were a very likely target for any future terrorist attacks so there's a lot of security now like you can't even drive through campus anymore and things like that it's 

404.40 406.78 A: (( kinda scary you know at times mm )) 

405.57 409.23 B: really isn't that where george bush is from texas 

408.93 410.27 A: yeah he's from texas 

410.15 411.09 B: yeah 

410.92 412.26 A: yeah 

411.89 417.07 B: i know at first when he first got elected i didn't really care too much for him 

417.12 418.10 A: mhm 

417.57 426.47 B: but now you know i see that he's a strong man and you know he stands up for what he believes in and he's gonna try to take care of america 

426.43 427.48 A: yeah 

426.89 429.12 B: and not let nobody run over us 

429.15 430.40 A: yeah 

430.05 437.10 B: 'cause at first you know i was like oh lord you know we got another bush he's gonna play the same role his dad did [laughter] 

436.74 437.92 A: (( [laughter] )) 

437.46 440.31 B: you know it jut kinda scared me at first 

440.07 441.41 A: yeah 

440.83 443.45 B: but now i see you know that 

444.19 446.28 B: he's gonna stand up for 

446.92 453.12 B: america [lipsmack] and that's what he's doing but i really think that he thought 

450.90 451.92 A: (( yeah but )) 

453.30 455.69 B: that the war was gonna be over with 

456.18 458.37 B: before you know now 

458.13 459.30 A: mhm 

458.73 464.67 B: i was thinking you know i thought that he thought that it was gonna be like over with in a week or two 

464.57 465.73 A: mhm 

465.12 466.93 B: you know i don't think that he was 

467.71 471.82 B: i don't believe that he thought it was gonna last as long as it has 

471.53 472.82 A: yeah 

473.35 474.69 B: [sigh] 

474.23 479.81 A: i don't know have they have they confirmed the are they still talking about going into syria i heard that the other day 

479.50 483.05 B: i'm not sure i'm not sure i'm really not 

479.92 480.54 A: (( okay yeah )) 

484.03 491.94 A: i don't know i think if they if they did that that that would just piss off even more people and you know might make the situation against us worse so 

484.31 485.29 B: i know 

491.62 492.85 B: yeah 

492.62 498.49 A: and then after he does that you know where do you stop do you keep going to every every nation that you believe harbors terrorists 'cause then 

498.71 503.34 A: you know there's you can go all over the world and do that and we'd be on a endless crusade you know 

503.79 505.66 A: all over the place but 

506.34 507.58 B: i know um 

508.42 511.42 B: my mother works on the naval base 

511.32 512.46 A: mhm 

511.86 514.67 B: and it scares me half to death her working out there 

514.41 515.30 A: yeah 

514.84 517.08 B: i mean it scares me half to death 

517.74 528.27 B: 'cause you know i wonder well are they gonna get bombed or are they gonna do this because if they go to the high you know we're on high alert right now if they go to severe then she can't work 

524.94 525.76 A: uh-huh 

528.09 528.91 A: uh-huh 

528.42 530.78 B: they're not gonna let them work on the base 

530.50 532.05 A: mhm 

532.27 534.89 B: it just scares me her working out there [laughter] 

534.75 535.63 A: (( uh-huh [laughter] )) 

536.04 538.69 A: but is it you said you were in memphis right 

538.15 540.35 B: yes sir i'm in memphis tennessee 

539.96 542.16 A: there's a naval base in memphis or 

541.52 544.61 B: it's in well it's in millington not i mean it's 

545.20 549.87 B: it's in millington but it's about ten minutes away from where i live 

549.59 550.51 A: okay 

550.59 552.63 B: [lipsmack] yes sir it's 

552.02 552.98 A: okay 

552.84 555.33 B: (( not very far from where i live [laughter] )) 

555.27 556.24 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

555.75 559.17 B: we have lots of major terrorist 

559.56 562.99 B: places out here that you know i believe that 

563.75 566.97 B: if they're gonna do something they would hit them places 

566.90 576.01 A: yeah that's the scary part is you can see you can look around basically almost any you know larger city in america and find plenty of targets and you just don't know you know which one is 

575.61 576.84 B: yeah 

576.22 583.26 A: they're gonna choose just 'cause you know the probability of you picking the right one is very slim given the large amount of targets and stuff that there are 

583.07 589.20 B: yes sir i'm just gonna start um going to college here in a few months 

584.39 585.32 A: yeah
