51.05 53.74 B: [laughter] this is true 

53.78 59.12 B: i think my most important thing is someone you feel comfortable with in any situation 

59.19 64.94 B: you know be it like a scary one or a fun one or like a sexual one or just anything 

63.28 64.35 A: mhm

97.69 98.89 B: [laughter] 

98.67 102.31 A: you know 'cause sometimes people take themselves so seriously 

99.48 100.92 B: well that makes sense 

102.60 106.10 A: and life so seriously and it's just important to laugh 

105.80 107.26 B: mhm

128.88 130.04 B: (( so )) 

130.19 133.84 B: as the time goes on it becomes more and more difficult but 

134.20 135.33 B: we're trying 

135.47 138.52 A: i've been in long distance relationships before 

138.71 141.76 A: and they are trying [laughter]

145.11 146.85 A: how often do you see each other mm 

146.88 150.44 B: [sigh] the last time i saw him was in november 

151.35 154.71 B: so and i'm hoping to get him here in 

154.83 156.33 B: uh the end of june 

156.13 157.66 A: oh good 

157.00 159.45 B: so hopefully that will happen 

159.53 164.67 B: but i mean the way we talk about it now we are in a life partnership situation 

165.66 166.59 B: so 

166.32 169.10 A: should i ask how you met or should i not 

168.54 183.08 B: [laughter] oh that's fine yeah um actually i met him abroad he was living in budapest hungary and i was traveling there and we met through just a mutual person that we had both randomly met the week before 

169.59 170.59 A: (( can i )) 

170.93 171.85 A: okay 

182.83 184.03 A: in hungary 

183.59 190.16 B: mhm actually he's from the united states but he lives in the philippines now 

184.12 185.94 A: but he's from the philippines 

188.03 189.03 A: oh 

189.85 191.15 A: oh right mhm 

190.64 202.77 B: so we just kinda started off as just like abroad affair and then after a while of living together and being together we just got more and more comfortable with each other and you know things developed into 

202.83 205.95 B: you know the partnership that we have today so 

204.98 205.88 A: uh-huh 

206.09 210.57 B: we were together for i guess like fourteen months 

210.22 211.13 A: mhm 

210.75 212.79 B: so and then um 

212.88 214.05 B: moved apart 

214.40 219.27 B: so we had you know a good base and then started doing the long distance thing 

220.21 224.07 A: [lipsmack] okay so we need to solidify the base 

223.75 227.00 B: exactly [laughter] very important

322.19 324.00 A: you do yeah 

322.77 325.00 B: i've lived so many different places

327.10 328.07 B: yes 

328.21 330.78 A: [lipsmack] so you have much in common yeah i've done a lotta traveling 

331.02 336.97 A: so so what else this is a good question for me i i want somebody who's really um pretty grounded 

336.66 338.29 B: mhm 

337.26 338.70 A: pretty smart 

338.68 341.67 B: yeah that's one of my number one's 

339.08 341.14 A: um money is not 

341.19 345.42 A: money is not critical but somebody who can um survive 

345.48 347.70 A: i mean i sure don't wanna be the breadwinner 

347.60 350.42 B: right that's another important one 

348.37 349.19 A: 'cause 

350.38 351.93 A: isn't it yeah 

351.25 354.66 B: i mean that's like that's what we have a lot of 

354.64 357.36 B: he has some money problems and so 

357.32 372.11 B: you know you say you know money isn't important but it's important that you know you don't debts and that money isn't an issue for everything that you do you know like we can't talk on the phone as as much because of money and so things like that i 

365.25 366.53 A: yeah right 

368.68 370.01 A: of the phone bill 

372.42 374.48 B: mean you don't need a millionaire but 

375.07 376.76 B: someone who can survive 

376.83 378.69 A: but my opinion is that if 

378.70 381.79 A: if um you two reconnect and and uh 

383.27 389.64 A: if you two can reconnect and actually maybe in the states it's easier to make a living i don't know 

389.83 392.04 A: at this point i really don't know 

390.67 392.29 B: (( i don't know [laughter] )) 

392.11 394.62 A: and uh and the economy but um 

393.88 395.16 B: (( exactly )) 

395.53 400.29 A: yeah 'cause i don't i don't i don't i personally don't want somebody who goes from job to job 

400.74 401.66 B: right 

401.27 404.10 A: and i personally i guess i want somebody who can 

404.28 410.39 A: i have a book that i'm trying to finish that's how i got to new mexico i was seduced into thinking that i would be able to finish my book 

409.70 411.07 B: [laughter] 

410.80 414.95 A: and as it turns out i've worked harder here than any place [laughter] 

415.05 415.92 A: so 

415.97 417.21 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

417.43 425.24 A: but i think i think somebody who can hold their own you know comfortably without making those things an issue is important 

418.92 419.70 B: (( right )) 

424.97 426.50 B: (( that's very important )) 

425.36 428.34 A: and maybe that's why the universe connected us today 

427.98 431.78 B: (( [laughter] that's )) 

428.89 433.63 A: so we could reaffirm that so we don't get involved with drifters and losers 

431.95 433.02 B: nice to hear 

433.16 434.51 B: exactly 

433.95 435.99 A: [laughter] yeah 

436.02 437.09 A: but 

437.27 450.60 B: it's funny i remember just because right now you know like i really don't refer to him as my boyfriend because like it really is a partnership situation and there really is a difference between someone who's just a boyfriend and someone who is your partner 

446.00 446.84 A: uh-huh 

450.21 452.03 A: what do you think the difference is 

451.61 463.33 B: like i don't know someone who's your boyfriend you you go out on dates you have fun on saturday night you know like maybe a sleep over and it's but you still have really separate lives you know your partner 

462.03 462.96 A: mhm 

463.42 467.73 B: any decision that you make you take that other person into account as well 

467.11 468.92 A: right you're blended 

468.54 469.75 B: exactly 

469.55 470.51 A: mhm 

470.91 483.43 B: so it's it was interesting to sort of to make that you know the leap from just it being someone i'm having an affair with to someone that who's like my boyfriend to someone who's my partner 

484.21 486.94 A: do you talk a lot every week on the phone 

485.99 489.21 B: yeah we talk on um on the computer twice a day 

489.88 490.78 B: so 

490.81 493.70 A: oh okay yeah that's cheap 

491.86 493.44 B: (( yeah )) 

493.48 494.88 B: yeah [laughter] 

494.77 497.22 A: but it's probably nicer to hear his voice 

496.71 498.33 B: yes this is true 

498.02 499.09 A: i imagine 

499.38 500.59 B: very true 

499.54 500.52 A: (( [mn] )) 

501.53 504.28 A: well i wish you a whole bunch of luck with that 

503.59 505.54 B: well thank you [laughter] 

504.57 508.73 A: yeah but if he's if there's if love is there i don't know maybe you'll have to make do 

509.00 516.35 A: [laughter] 'cause in in where i live um it's pretty rough and um it's almost like the 

509.03 509.87 B: yeah 

510.08 511.06 B: trying 

516.41 523.65 A: drugs capital of um the united states in a lot of ways so a lotta people are really addicts or alcoholics 

519.53 520.72 B: oh wow 

524.01 525.18 A: or um 

525.69 528.13 A: gambling is really big around here 

527.78 529.20 B: mm mhm 

529.22 530.25 A: um 

530.41 534.23 A: and it's really it really is very difficult to find anybody 

534.35 536.52 A: i work for a university 

536.25 537.39 B: mhm me too 

537.48 538.53 A: do you 

538.07 538.98 B: mhm 

538.68 539.76 A: where 

539.49 541.94 B: in toledo where i live 

541.23 542.56 A: oh no kidding 

542.11 543.54 B: yep 

543.07 546.61 A: um and i and i'm involved in a distance education program 

546.22 548.00 B: mhm 

546.74 558.25 A: in any event i have a little crush on somebody who's fairly successful but very mysterious and i have this horrible feeling like you know see i always say people here are either addicts 

558.48 562.31 A: addicts um alcoholics or married 

562.85 564.04 A: and so we're 

563.33 565.15 B: so mysterious how 

565.14 570.17 A: well like when i asked him if he was involved with somebody i kinda got some double talk 

569.88 571.55 B: oh [laughter] 

570.87 579.94 A: and then one of my uh compadres who i i don't see very often but she's pretty close with him and he told me straight up that he was married 

580.12 580.77 B: (( [mn] )) 

581.17 584.77 A: so that's not my idea of an ideal companion 

583.45 586.48 B: yeah i think you should maybe stay with the crush [laughter] 

585.87 588.22 A: what stay as what a crush 

587.59 588.98 B: yeah [laughter] 

588.95 592.98 A: well no we're going to go out to dinner friday night and i've decided to get to the bottom of it 

592.54 594.86 B: oh well good luck with that 

594.57 597.34 A: well thank you i mean if he's honest that would be nice 

596.72 598.74 B: yeah but don't let him lie 

599.43 599.89 A: no
