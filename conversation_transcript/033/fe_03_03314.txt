19.17 23.31 B: [laughter] what do you mean a better baseball team we have a better everything 

20.53 21.91 A: that's all right but 

23.11 23.82 A: (( wh- )) 

23.58 25.20 B: no i'm joking [laughter] 

24.38 32.46 A: okay [laughter] that's that's that's all right anyway so uh the topic is what do you we look for in a are you married do you have a life partner 

32.06 35.35 B: um i am not married but i do have a life partner 

34.89 36.85 A: oh good for you okay 

35.90 37.35 B: yeah how about you 

37.30 50.46 A: uh i am actually i am i have a life partner and i am married i'm but i was uh uh i didn't get into it 'til late so i don't know wh- i don't really know wh- what what they mean by defining my life partner but 

41.33 41.90 B: (( mm )) 

49.87 51.42 B: [laughter] yeah exactly 

51.13 58.64 A: but uh uh it's one of those social actual terms i guess we accept it long term relationships sort of thing i guess 

58.65 62.64 A: but um what do we look for i don't know um 

63.34 68.91 A: do you believe that what's the old saying that you're supposed to find somebody that has opposites or someth- opposites attract 

68.24 72.86 B: yeah i think that that is a thing you're supposed to be like op- like opposites attract 

73.19 76.04 B: and so you're supposed to find somebody that's the opposite of you 

76.16 78.34 A: (( yeah yeah i don't what's )) 

76.20 77.56 B: but i think 

78.41 80.61 A: not too opposite i wouldn't think i 

78.52 79.29 B: (( [mn] )) 

79.69 81.49 B: yeah exactly 'cause i 

80.82 86.68 A: mean i i would think there'd be well there's probably someth- a little something to it but i mean i wouldn't think that 

86.83 87.78 A: (( uh )) 

88.07 93.32 A: um you know just if one of you is outgoing and the other one's a wallflower i don- i don't know i 

93.45 97.50 A: guess i've seen relationships fail because people are so different you know they're 

96.80 97.95 B: right 

97.65 99.04 A: they're whatever but 

98.43 101.05 B: you have to at least have something in common i would imagine 

100.70 102.57 A: yeah yeah yeah [noise] 

101.98 108.72 B: or at least at least for it to kind of work on some level i think well if i was thinking of somebody 

108.84 112.00 B: that i would want to be a life partner i think the first thing 

112.20 114.51 B: i would look for is their temperament 

114.35 115.31 A: yeah 

114.69 118.33 B: because it's really important to me that people are easy going 

118.36 122.50 B: you know there's not a lot of fighting that it that they're easy to get along with 

120.59 121.73 A: right right 

123.36 126.92 A: and uh oh yeah i agree i agree um 

126.53 136.19 B: and if somebody was the opposite to me in that [laughter] in that area and they were you know always trying to fight or pick a fight or something i wouldn't stick around [laughter] 

132.37 133.79 A: i know it 

135.46 140.25 A: no i know that i know so that's you know so that's i don't know perhaps that's a myth but 

140.27 144.73 A: um but you don't want your cl- clone either you know you don't want to be married you know 

143.03 147.08 B: no you definitely don't want i think that could be the probably the biggest deterrent 

146.97 148.77 A: oh i know i know 

147.82 149.76 B: someone that's too much like you 

149.72 151.16 A: so um 

151.59 164.31 A: what else uh yeah i think that temperament that's an important thing i think and just if you like to do the same things i mean what i mean the other thing about what if one of you likes to travel and one of you doesn't i mean i think you have to have 

162.80 163.57 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

164.29 166.64 A: pretty core values i think what if you 

166.78 172.43 A: one of you likes to you know cook and the other doesn't you know you know you'd like to share s- a lot of things 

169.53 170.47 B: right 

172.07 175.02 B: as long as uh as the other one likes to do the dishes right 

174.72 176.71 A: [laughter] 

175.97 177.34 B: 'cause that's the way that works 

176.72 181.80 A: where one of you is a republican and one's a democrat i could see wh- where uh you know there'd be some 

181.20 183.08 B: problems there definitely 

182.24 187.95 A: some big yeah some big political problems everyone in the in the house all arguing politics all the time 

184.43 185.50 B: [laughter] 

187.37 188.76 B: [laughter] 

188.12 189.61 A: [laughter] 

189.01 192.89 B: i think it's definitely got to be a healthy balance between those two like 

192.81 193.37 A: (( [sigh] )) 

193.11 198.96 B: you know if you find somebody who is similar enough that you can do a lot of things but different enough that you have your own life 

198.68 199.74 A: right 

199.16 208.48 B: you know and that they can and as long as they can embrace that and you can embrace their differences i think that you know a relationship is something that you work on every day 

208.51 212.65 A: well that's true you know it's just i was just thinking that also do that you just don't 

212.75 214.94 A: go into a relationship and say 

215.02 217.05 A: i'm just trying to think well see i've been in 

217.64 222.41 A: i've been a couple with uh my wife for i think twenty 

223.47 226.78 A: twenty three years we've been married for eighteen years 

226.13 227.28 B: wow 

226.72 241.48 A: yeah so that yeah i never well i didn't go into it thinking what do i want in a longterm relationship you know what do i want in a life partner we didn't you know and even it didn't y- you know just how do you know when you know when you have a life partner what a ri- i mean when you 

227.43 228.72 B: congratulations 

235.39 236.28 B: right 

240.75 243.97 B: i guess when you look back and realize you've spent your life with that person [laughter] 

243.30 248.90 A: [laughter] yeah or yeah or you know just or when you know when do you know 

244.28 245.17 B: that's prob- 

249.16 260.04 A: wh- i guess what i'm getting at is i d- when do you start to figure out what do i want you know in a long i don't know if you sit down and if you get along i think that's the important thing and you like to spend your time together 

259.84 261.60 B: (( [mn] yeah that's my answer )) 

260.45 274.85 A: and but but you know when do you what's when do you yeah you don't really it's not a process or it's a process but it's not really a but this is what i want in a life partner you know you don't you don't make a list of [laughter] these qua- these qualities you know [laughter] 

270.02 270.92 B: right 

273.84 279.62 B: right exactly i think maybe some of that happens actually right after you break up with somebody 

275.06 275.74 A: (( th- )) 

279.69 292.98 B: that you don't like you know and then you're like well the next time i date somebody i want them to be taller and darker and handsomer [laughter] or i want them to be shorter or you know obviously those are really superficial things but 

280.28 281.88 A: yeah yeah right 

293.59 305.83 B: i want them to not yell at me or i want them to be very gentle or i want them to be more active or i want them you know i thin- i think it's kind of a paring down situation you start with anybody 

305.54 306.50 A: right 

305.74 310.66 B: and then uh by the time you get to three or four you've finally figured it out [laughter] 

309.85 322.51 A: right right right i uh i feel sorry for people who keep making the same mistakes i guess with the the classic pattern is abus- uh you know victims of abuse i mean just abusers slash 

316.06 317.24 B: yeah 

322.56 324.62 A: (( abusees you know i mean )) 

324.46 338.41 A: i mean there's something to that i don't understand i know there i know it's the you know it it's real complicated but you know wha- i mean it's easy to to say w- oh this woman's stupid she keeps going back to guys that want to hit her all the time but i mean 

330.47 331.52 B: right 

337.52 338.64 B: right 

338.43 340.33 A: um you know or 

340.34 346.71 A: it's not just physical abuse but i mean verbal abuse mental abuse psychological abuse whatever too 

343.19 343.91 B: right 

345.64 346.60 B: (( right yeah )) 

346.74 352.69 A: and um it it's complicated but i mean but i think there's some truth in it people 

352.70 353.71 A: um 

353.96 364.21 A: you know just they they're attracted to people who do that i don't know why but you know or are attracted to destruc- you know what you call maybe self destructive tendencies or something like that i don't know 

357.12 357.93 B: right 

362.75 363.54 B: right 

364.28 371.56 B: my i used to have a friend and he told me well i still have this friend but what he used to say to me was the way to 

371.71 381.26 B: have a girlfriend or a wife or whatever and keep her is to come in any day very suddenly um scare her beat her up 

381.49 384.46 B: till she's beaten up and crying and whatever 

384.55 396.11 B: and then let her calm down a little bit and then make love to her and he said it worked every time like like he was in this pattern where he was abusive to people and thank god he broke out of it 

396.17 410.85 B: but he noticed that that was definitely a pattern that he could every single time he could get that woman to want him more by doing this exact same thing beating them up and then coming back some and i thought that has got to be the [laughter] strangest thing i've ever heard but 

407.00 407.56 A: (( [mn] )) 

410.07 411.62 A: um [sigh] 

411.16 413.96 B: i think it i think it happens a lot 

413.36 421.66 A: i know unfortunately unfortunately probably in more than just you know uh you think its well this is sort of a lower class thing or something you just 

420.96 421.82 B: right 

421.75 426.24 A: people who you know lower economic income i i think i bet it happens more in 

426.52 439.99 A: uh [sigh] not necessarily rich people but i mean but uh but all kinds of people i mean i think it's more has more to do with uh just human behaviour than it does with you know class or status or anything like that i know 

432.72 433.60 B: mhm 

436.89 437.74 B: yeah 

439.33 440.43 B: yeah 

440.32 446.90 A: but uh back to the issue here i don't you know i got us off off a little bit there you know i don't you know i just um 

447.48 451.29 A: is it like jazz or something you know sort of if you have to ask 

451.31 459.82 A: you know probably you're you know the definition of a of of what what's compatible with you i mean it probably you're trying too hard or something you know you should just 

458.43 460.04 B: yeah definitely 

459.97 465.51 A: it just sort of should be like a good comfortable pair of shoes or something i i don't 

463.76 464.63 B: right 

465.24 474.48 B: well i think one of the most important things is is the the beauty of your relationship and the beauty of the person that you're with you could never define 

474.35 475.43 A: right 

475.06 488.78 B: so there's no use saying i want to be with somebody who's exactly these things because when it comes down to it a you're not going to find that person [laughter] and b the person who may be right in front of you can offer you so many more things that you can't even put a words to 

487.37 489.91 A: oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah 

489.33 496.68 B: and i think that must be it i mean i think probably you can agree in your relationship that um that you there's something special there's a spark 

496.99 503.47 B: there's something between me and my life partner that is that is a spark and every time we're together 

503.63 505.25 B: that flame is there 

504.83 508.22 A: yeah well we hope i you know we hope so i mean it's 

506.74 507.71 B: right 

508.44 511.65 A: of course we've known i've known life partners who you know 

512.42 520.92 A: say that you know i've known people who've gotten divorced after twenty five years and say we hated each other's guts the last fifteen years but we stayed together for the kids 

520.59 521.55 B: right 

520.94 526.90 A: now you know i mean [sigh] that's pretty sad that i think there's a lot of tr- people who stay together 'cause it's easier than 

527.21 529.96 A: than you know than moving on but 

529.59 530.40 B: right 

530.08 542.22 A: oh you said something i forgot what it was i was going to say again duh yeah but it was it was a good point i thought it was anyway [laughter] but uh um what the hell i've never mind but um 

533.27 533.98 B: (( [laughter] )) 

537.28 538.21 B: [laughter] 

542.53 543.60 A: um 

543.79 548.73 B: i think it's weird because if i'm looking at um relationships now 

548.81 561.00 B: um and kind of looking back and seeing kind of like trying to foresee what might happen in my life uh i notice that my people that are my parents' age all got divorced 

561.77 564.04 B: and like my parents are divorced and 

563.69 564.51 A: (( mm )) 

564.06 569.31 B: all the kids well we're not kids any more but all the people that are my age all have divorced parents 

569.58 580.28 B: and then they went off to find their life partner and after they had already been divorced already had kids their kids are grown up at this point in time they finally find somebody that they want to spend the rest of their life with 

580.69 588.65 B: and i find that so strange i'm kind of sitting here in my own relationship saying i hope you know that's not the case with us because i mean 

580.71 581.52 A: (( mm )) 

587.14 587.94 A: (( mm )) 

589.40 593.65 B: i i don't think anybody would wish it but i think it's a really odd phenomenon [laughter] 

593.01 594.29 A: mhm 

594.06 597.96 B: and i'm not sure is it just because your needs change all the time 

598.78 599.89 B: i mean you're not going to be the
