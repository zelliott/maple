173.40 175.29 A: totally agree with that 

176.85 179.21 B: (( um let's see what else )) 

179.81 189.26 B: well according to the bible it says uh something to the effect that you should not stay married if you're unevenly yoked so it has to be someone who's compatible 

189.05 190.43 A: mhm 

189.84 194.43 B: uh whether it be money or social status or whatever you 

195.26 198.59 A: yeah i i wonder if they're talking about um 

198.75 204.73 A: being unequally yoked spiritually or if they're what exactly they're talking about 

204.21 207.03 B: want i'm not sure spiritually possible 

207.01 208.12 A: (( [cough] you know )) 

207.26 210.11 B: like uh like a jew marrying a christian 

209.85 211.03 A: (( mhm )) 

210.95 213.38 B: that would definitely be a problem 

212.85 215.22 A: (( [laughter] yeah yeah it would )) 

214.27 219.86 B: uh or a or a um an atheist marrying a devote chris- 

219.11 229.70 A: oh can you imagine i i don't think they would i i don't know if a chris- could a christian really marry an an atheist if they were devote [laughter] you 

220.60 222.42 B: that would definitely be a 

229.89 231.41 B: i'm not sure 

230.21 230.81 A: (( know )) 

231.42 232.71 A: (( what i'm saying )) 

231.86 238.28 B: i'm not sure i'm just i'm one of those people who just try to follow the ten commandments and the golden rule 

236.63 238.15 A: (( commandments yeah )) 

238.76 239.56 A: yeah 

245.07 247.26 B: just like if they're into 

247.28 252.97 B: style and and um well it wouldn't seem like you'd really 

253.34 262.42 B: what are you looking for someone who's compatible compatible as in clothing style if someone's got to spent every last dime of their money buying what's stylish 

262.54 271.24 B: as opposed to taking care of home business uh you know paying the bills stuff like that um that would be a problem 

271.31 278.88 B: um and someone who's compatible someone who's safe and loyal someone who's t- truthful um 

278.91 280.46 B: sense of humor 

280.82 282.52 B: if his up there 

281.88 287.63 A: yeah yeah well i don't i don't know if if uh one person really can meet all those 

287.77 288.75 A: um 

289.67 290.23 B: (( [noise] )) 

289.69 291.91 A: [lipsmack] you know characteristics 

292.05 292.82 B: mm 

292.11 297.39 A: because we all c- you know we all um on a day to day basis we're not always 

297.50 305.67 A: um what's the word i'm looking for it's you know we have our our ups and our downs and maybe we're inconsiderate or 

306.10 309.45 A: are you following what i'm saying you know we're not just as 

308.52 316.81 B: and no one is total on anything yeah i agree with that but at the same time you have to be able to be compatible 

310.77 312.24 A: (( mhm right )) 

312.85 313.95 A: mhm 

317.25 330.42 B: if if it's uh iron clad uh you never wear uh red lipsticks on mondays no matter what you're you're gonna have a problem you've gotta be able to bend and take bend and you 

324.19 325.43 A: [laughter] 

329.29 330.75 A: yeah that's true 

330.70 334.09 B: (( know take and give it's gotta be equal )) 

334.37 337.99 B: that's some- but not everything's gonna be fifty fifty all the time 

337.42 338.41 A: no 

338.10 342.83 B: 'cause sometimes you gotta give a hundred and ten percent and and sometimes they're gonna have to give a hundred and ten percent 

340.42 341.39 A: yeah 

342.19 349.02 A: that well what i had uh heard is that each person has to give a hundred percent [laughter] so 

349.21 349.99 A: (( you )) 

350.54 351.54 A: k- i i 

350.72 360.05 B: but that hundred percent may not be exactly what the the exact whatever it is you're talking about it could be a hundred percent consideration 

353.22 354.14 A: yeah 

355.05 357.38 A: right yeah you're right 

359.90 361.00 A: mhm 

360.13 362.55 B: a a hundred percent submission 

363.06 370.32 B: uh you know letting the other person have their way and again that comes back to the you know give and take 

370.34 371.18 B: [cough] 

370.50 371.56 A: yeah 

371.24 372.15 B: (( excuse me )) 

373.95 375.37 B: um 

376.08 377.31 B: looks 

377.55 379.74 B: i'm sorry that is very important 

380.08 381.11 B: if you're not 

381.76 384.50 B: visually attracted to someone 

384.51 391.37 B: you cannot be emotionally spiritually or psychologically attracted to someone 

393.23 395.72 A: [mn] well i don't know if i agree with that 

396.14 397.47 B: you're sure 

397.35 400.34 A: yeah i i don't know if i'm 

402.07 408.96 A: i don't know because you just think of long term marriages and people's appearances change 

408.98 415.65 A: so i'm thinking well what you know what if um someone's appearance changes 

415.73 423.10 A: then do have people that you know that have been married long term have they gone on to find somebody that they might find more appealing no 

423.70 428.77 B: no but if you're not if you're not visually attracted to that person 

429.16 440.25 B: again that goes back the the rest of its psychological uh um you know that goes back to compatibility but if you're not visually attracted to that person 

440.53 442.49 B: attracted to that person 

442.76 446.63 B: you're not gonna find out whether or not you're compatible in any other way 

447.67 450.13 B: you're not gonna take someone you know 

450.53 454.48 B: you're not gonna marry someone well in some countries they still do 

454.64 460.12 B: uh you know where it's arranged you never see the other person 'til the day you get married 

460.70 463.24 A: [noise] [laughter] mm yeah that would be different wouldn't it 

462.91 464.48 B: oh yeah 

464.64 465.31 A: (( [mn] )) 

465.44 468.08 A: i can't imagine that [laughter] 

467.08 472.36 B: no 'cause again you you have to be visually attracted to that person 

472.58 477.58 B: you have to like what they look like enough to want to to know them on a different level 

478.23 479.41 B: um 

480.58 488.31 A: i don't know with with me i think i'm looking more for more of um a heartfelt communication than somebody's looks 

489.76 494.05 A: like um an empathy and an understanding and 

494.66 495.70 A: um 

496.69 499.88 A: an ability on the other person's part to 

500.25 501.89 A: understand me 

501.90 509.05 A: than just going out on someone's looks i i think that's that's where i come from more than the looks 

508.92 513.06 B: okay you're you're talking about something more like a blind date to start with 

514.67 515.71 A: i am 

515.82 520.52 B: i guess it's basically the same essence you don't know what the person looks 

524.30 525.31 B: (( [noise] )) 

527.70 530.01 B: (( well anyway that was my other half )) 

529.68 530.39 A: (( [laughter] )) 

530.61 535.10 B: he's gotta out where the f- the streets are flooded and he's about to go out 

534.52 535.51 A: (( mm )) 

535.51 537.31 B: that is so silly to me 

537.12 539.23 A: yeah get stranded 

539.23 540.16 B: yeah 

539.34 542.29 A: [laughter] 

540.99 543.53 B: that'll be his problem if he does 

545.47 546.70 A: yeah 

546.11 547.75 B: anyway um 

548.36 552.62 B: no i'm not saying everything's supposed to be based on on visual attraction 

551.52 552.71 A: mhm 

552.76 557.47 B: but if i don't think someone is pleasing to the eyes i'm not gonna 

557.55 561.87 B: do anything more than very casual hello and how are you 

562.32 564.78 B: and then be on my way uh 

563.83 565.07 A: mhm 

564.93 565.76 B: (( you know )) 

566.86 569.20 B: there has to be something to click 

568.78 570.02 A: (( initially mhm )) 

570.08 571.57 B: yeah 

572.56 574.71 B: if they look like uh 

576.62 578.36 B: ozzy osborne 

578.27 580.72 A: [laughter] 

581.33 584.33 A: you don't like you don't think ozzy's appealing 

584.18 585.04 B: (( [noise] no )) 

584.95 586.86 A: [laughter] 

585.13 585.99 B: i don't 

586.96 590.66 B: [noise] ozzy osborne looks like a burnt out 

593.69 594.72 A: (( [laughter] )) 

594.88 595.80 B: (( [mn] )) 

596.99 599.95 B: actually it's like seeing a drunk on the street are you gonna
