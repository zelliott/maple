4.67 5.62 B: ah hey 

5.67 9.83 B: um so we're talking about life partners right

10.36 11.19 B: yeah 

13.02 13.95 B: [laughter] 

15.63 21.80 B: um so i mean i'm i have a girlfriend but um i'm not married i i guess life partner just means 

15.67 17.22 A: (( yeah go ahead )) 

22.08 23.12 B: uh 

23.89 25.62 B: someone that you're uh 

27.49 33.68 B: uh i guess c- in a relations- in a serious relationship with right preferably a soul mate yeah 

31.49 32.99 A: [noise] i'd imagine 

33.03 42.92 A: well see i'm gay so it probably means i don't know as far as like heterosexual versus homosexual it probably means a little bit uh 

43.19 48.57 A: more as far as because we don't really most of us don't do marriage very much 

48.14 49.73 B: right right 

49.13 55.46 A: so i hope you don't mind me saying that being bold but [laughter] a lot of people it bothers but um 

52.62 53.87 B: (( no no no )) 

55.70 58.21 A: so as far as like life partners it's 

58.70 61.55 A: it is a lot bigger issue 

61.82 67.64 A: as far as just since we're not allowed to have legal paper and so forth 

67.94 68.90 A: um 

69.25 74.40 A: i don't know as far as emotionally it's it's that it's probably the same i'm guessing but 

74.43 75.32 A: um 

75.67 81.32 A: a- as far as the financial and the taxes and all that kind of thing tha- that's a little bit different 

81.39 82.56 B: [noise] uh-huh 

81.41 86.99 A: but that's not really [laughter] okay so in any case so what do what do you look for 

86.75 93.08 B: um well anyway i'm not married but i have um okay i look for someone who um she has to 

94.03 99.53 B: definitely have a lot of uh you know her own interests and and um 

99.95 106.09 B: [mn] doesn't have to have the same exact opinions on me like whether it's politics or religion but still has to 

106.28 108.09 B: uh you know sort of 

108.78 110.90 B: uh not try to 

111.00 120.83 B: p- you know be too influential i mean putting be judgmental or you know be sort of open minded and spiritual and um 

121.10 123.09 B: you know give each other room to grow 

123.28 124.27 B: uh 

125.48 126.84 B: (( and um )) 

128.12 130.67 B: uh she definitely be intelligent and uh 

131.11 133.37 B: you know have a career that she's happy with 

133.49 136.88 A: right and how how's im- how important is career for you 

133.97 135.21 B: and uh 

137.05 142.05 B: um it's important uh it's definitely important and um [mn] 

142.88 143.91 B: uh 

144.50 145.98 B: also [mn] 

147.14 149.98 B: uh she should like cats [laughter] 

149.78 154.14 A: cats [laughter] oh okay [laughter] 

150.05 153.59 B: i mean not be allergic to cats you know i mean yeah 

154.11 155.65 B: (( and um )) 

156.70 157.73 B: (( uh )) 

159.46 165.22 B: and is uh i guess that that's it um i'll probably think of some more characteristics uh 

165.81 169.58 B: and um oh what about you wh- wh- what do you look for in a partner 

169.83 170.80 A: um 

170.99 182.33 A: i like somebody who has a mind of their own but like you said not imposing their their ideas necessarily on me but [noise] but being free and willing and able to discuss it 

182.62 183.70 B: (( oh yeah )) 

182.94 187.78 A: um yeah because if if they impose it on me i'm turned off by that 

187.82 191.06 A: because i won't necessarily feel the same way that they do 

191.20 198.03 A: um as far as but i like them to have their own mindset and and their own opinion 

198.33 201.39 A: i don't want somebody who's always going to agree with me on everything 

202.05 204.96 A: you know and it's just kind of 

202.54 203.83 B: right right 

205.43 209.90 B: it's kind of predictable you know you need to be you need to be challenged and yeah 

207.02 212.11 A: [mn] yeah [laughter] exactly yeah yeah it's uh 

212.14 213.66 A: if um 

215.67 227.57 A: i've at looks at one point in time when i was a lot younger mattered now it's not uh not really necessary it's a it's a plus you know but i figure if i fall in love with somebody then 

227.85 230.45 A: i i fall in love with that part of them too 

230.37 231.69 B: [noise] right right 

230.54 233.51 A: that's almost secondary at this point in my life 

233.71 234.71 A: um 

234.73 240.11 A: i mean i know that when you first meet somebody probably that's one of the first things that attracts you 

240.58 243.89 A: you know how they look as far as what you find attractive 

243.28 244.55 B: (( right right [noise] [noise] [mn] )) 

244.05 245.00 A: um 

245.54 246.39 A: but 

246.55 258.95 A: [mn] i've seen like uh i've gone out and had friends who i thought were just the most gorgeous people who other people aren't necessarily necessarily faint at but the reason being is because of their 

259.06 261.23 A: you know their personalities 

260.62 262.27 B: right right 

261.79 272.42 A: not not because of what they actually look like i mean i've met some of the most gorgeous people and they're oh i wouldn't have anything to do with uh the likes of me [laughter] 

271.46 272.90 B: right right [noise] 

272.90 278.82 A: so that's important i mean a personality is definitely important over over looks any day 

276.60 277.81 B: yeah 

279.44 281.70 A: (( um i like somebody that's stable )) 

279.82 281.27 B: yeah because um 

281.59 289.60 B: nowadays anyway with with um plastic surgery it seems like n- n- for all we know and the the way things are going there's fewer and fewer 

289.65 297.47 B: people that are unpleasant to look at and everybody's i mean there's beauty in everybody [mn] and i and i think that depending on how a person 

293.97 295.98 A: oh yeah 

297.26 305.67 B: carries themselves that determines how you know that affects how like attracted i am to them and and uh 

305.85 317.28 B: so i mean looks are of course important and and her figure of course isn't so important but you know doesn't have to be i'm not picky in terms of oh she has to be like skinny like uh 

311.48 312.60 A: [laughter] 

317.19 322.36 B: calista flockhart or something you know i mean you know i don't mind a few extra pounds you know [laughter] 

318.77 320.65 A: mm right 

322.10 326.28 A: right exactly yeah that never bothered me um 

325.10 325.97 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

326.66 332.45 A: as far as career yeah i like 'em to be pretty much stable or at least on the track of being stable 

329.75 330.87 B: (( [noise] mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

332.49 337.01 A: um right now i've got a girlfriend but she's going to school 

337.03 339.17 A: uh finishing out her degree 

338.95 340.30 B: right 

339.71 348.10 A: um i'm like thirteen years older than she is but you know i figure she's she's got a part time job she she takes care of herself 

348.02 349.51 B: (( [noise] yeah that's good [noise] )) 

348.22 356.28 A: as far as financially you know she doesn't necessarily totally rely on me and i know that once she gets done that you know 

356.30 361.77 A: it'll be okay she'll find a job and she's studying to be a psychologist so 

361.96 363.71 A: pretty much it's you know 

364.39 366.07 A: i'm hoping she has 

366.47 370.23 A: pretty stable income after that and that is important 

368.52 369.73 B: (( right okay )) 

370.36 373.70 B: and are are you thinking of living with her 

370.66 372.77 A: (( that is important )) 

373.24 375.75 A: yeah yeah eventually 

375.84 377.02 A: yeah 

376.10 377.59 B: (( or [noise] oh that's good mm )) 

377.53 379.57 A: but yeah it's just uh 

380.20 383.13 A: that's another thing as far as th- they have to be 

384.41 390.53 A: it's hard to live with somebody who like i'm a neat freak but they they keep a messy house kind of thing 

390.07 392.17 B: right right 

390.83 403.78 A: you need that kind of compromise i mean i'm not going to be crazy where if you know if something hits the floor i'm not going to go crazy but at the same time i i appreciate that we have some kind of compromise i guess 

401.98 407.61 B: right right yeah otherwise it's like the odd couple right you know like [laughter] 

405.18 409.45 A: yeah exactly [laughter] you end up wanting to kill them more than anything else 

409.00 413.22 B: yeah and another thing is the um schedules work schedules 'cause i have uh 

409.52 410.41 A: [laughter] 

413.25 419.17 B: i keep my own hours 'cause i'm uh self employed so uh i'm sort of my own boss so 

419.08 419.96 A: uh-huh 

419.22 420.39 B: um 

421.15 423.75 B: so i- it's uh it it's um 

424.24 433.30 B: so that's that's good to be flexible 'cause some people they're they're stuck in like they go to [noise] school at night and then they work during the day and then you don't have enough time for each other you know 

433.26 444.08 A: well exactly yeah um but sometimes you know i know of some people that they've been married for ever because they li- they work on different schedules now that doesn't work for me 

443.79 445.94 B: right right 

444.99 449.80 A: but i do know of other people that that's you know probably the only reason they stay together 

447.71 448.83 B: (( [noise] )) 

449.66 451.50 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah i know i know a c- )) 

450.06 452.86 A: is because they don't see that much of each other 

452.35 464.72 B: yeah i know a couple that um that they work at the same place and they and they're [noise] married and and um i wonder if that's if that's not such a good idea because you know seeing each other all the time you know 

464.76 466.84 A: i would have to probably 

467.10 470.64 A: no there's no way that i could work with the person that i'm with 

469.99 472.51 B: yeah that's like too much 

471.70 473.31 A: you need that break 

472.94 475.11 B: right right 

474.16 478.50 A: yeah you need that break but um not enough is also 

478.80 481.97 A: detrimental to the relationship as far as i'm concerned 

481.68 483.88 B: (( right right )) 

483.25 484.21 A: so 

484.61 493.54 A: um i play a lot of sports i don't necessarily need a partner that's interested in that kind of thing or even my hobbies but they have to give me the time to do it 

492.47 494.79 B: [noise] right that's right yeah 

493.76 496.52 A: as much as i would give them the time to do it 

496.36 498.17 B: [noise] yeah like if i 

498.56 500.94 B: like if i go to the gym with with uh 

501.18 506.54 B: you know my girlfriend and we we each go do separate things anyway at the gym you know [laughter] 

505.73 507.07 A: (( yeah )) 

507.45 512.17 A: [laughter] well see but that's a uh common interest so that's good 

511.15 515.07 B: yeah and and where do you live what p- oh 

514.24 516.12 A: i live in columbus ohio 

515.71 516.87 B: okay
