1.54 3.83 B: (( [noise] [noise] uh john sealey )) 

3.54 4.93 A: hi how you doing 

4.30 5.75 B: how you doing 

5.19 7.83 A: pretty good do you have any idea what we're supposed to be doing 

7.38 16.16 B: um this is like a survey um and i guess the topic is life partners and what you're supposed to look for in a partner [noise] 

12.64 13.55 A: uh-huh 

15.18 16.17 A: okay 

16.42 19.83 B: [noise] and [sigh] i don't know trust and honesty i would assume 

19.67 27.02 A: yeah i think that's a the very first thing [laughter] you should talk ab- or to to that's it i mean that's what you need in a life partner 

26.66 28.90 B: well you gotta be able to depend on them 

28.31 38.97 A: yeah i have uh somebody that i'm living with right now that it it it's just about trust you know [laughter] i i i trust her i know her i feel her i i think uh 

39.28 42.38 A: [mn] another thing is a connection like a personal connection 

41.93 43.11 B: (( [noise] right )) 

42.74 47.11 A: somebody that can live on your same frequency and not 

46.26 49.29 B: yeah i'm i'm having a situation right now 

49.45 56.76 B: um because me and my fiancee we're [noise] too uh hold on a sec hey buddy i'm on the phone okay it'll 

57.02 57.82 A: (( [laughter] )) 

57.26 66.36 B: be for ten minutes um we're having a situation because i was in the marines and i'm a little bit tougher than she is and she's super sensitive 

66.07 69.39 A: yeah it's pretty much the same here [laughter] 

67.08 77.86 B: and it's we're so compatible except where what i think is not so bad it's tremendously bad for her 

77.27 78.74 A: yeah 

77.97 81.40 B: but we do trust each other immensely which 

81.43 83.29 B: is important i know that much 

82.69 90.92 A: [noise] yeah i think that's a funny thing too in a in a life partner relationship like that my my girlfriend's the same way 

86.57 87.47 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

88.57 89.46 B: (( [noise] )) 

90.54 91.46 B: right 

90.90 104.33 A: she's been led a very sheltered life and i've lived a very hard [laughter] life and uh i think that like being able to grow together is another reason that i am still with her and choose to be with her for life is that um 

94.64 96.28 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

98.93 100.23 B: (( right [noise] )) 

103.60 104.62 B: [noise] 

104.24 106.49 A: she knows that she's 

107.05 111.09 A: um i wouldn't say weaker but more sensitive i think it would be 

110.01 111.35 B: (( [noise] yeah um )) 

110.99 118.16 A: and uh and she trusts me [laughter] so that when we talk about things like you know the bills are getting bad and you know we might 

118.04 130.73 A: you know not be able to pay this bill this month or something you know like whatever and i'm like okay here's what the real deal is if you step back and look at you know what the your credit rating is and how everything works and what you do and you know you 

130.72 145.13 A: and if we do this we don't have to be late with it or whatever but it's just this thing and you can only worry about it so much and she trusts because she doesn't have as much financial experience as i do that i know what i'm talking about and that in the whole scheme of things it's 

145.01 151.17 A: nothing to really freak out about and even though she's nervous she'll like 

150.50 152.38 B: (( [noise] [mn] yeah when women get )) 

151.29 154.92 A: she'll trust that it's okay because i say it's okay you know 

153.97 156.06 B: well then she trusts you that's why 

155.32 162.95 A: yeah and then because we're in life together and and she knows that i'm going to be there it's like uh you can really count on uh 

163.60 165.65 A: (( you know the other person mhm )) 

164.32 165.22 B: well 

165.39 174.50 B: well you know like when i uh you know when i'm dealing with situations at home i if i'm not there her word is like mine vice versa 

174.71 178.14 B: you know it's like the the bosses of the house 

177.94 179.13 A: yeah 

178.35 186.03 B: 'cause we we trust each other's judgement and stuff and i don't know there's just b- besides that i mean just compatibility in other areas 

185.52 186.79 A: yeah 

186.19 190.47 B: you know like [noise] if one person has like a um 

190.62 194.03 B: a high tolerance or a high whatever and the other one you know 

194.21 208.83 B: i don't know even like for hot sauce or something you know you try to be more on the same [noise] you know level and you make compromising and stuff like that like a daily part of your life [sigh] 'cause you have to deal with a lot of stupid little things 

196.45 197.68 A: yeah 

208.23 210.10 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

209.45 211.06 B: you know like um 

211.48 213.18 B: no closet space 

212.88 214.11 A: yeah 

213.33 215.10 B: [sigh] you know i don't mind 

215.35 217.42 B: but you know 

217.50 224.37 B: you know when you you're thinking well dang i got three suits here and i don't want these in the hall closet 'cause there's no room 

223.81 225.20 A: yeah 

224.84 234.66 B: well you have to you know you gotta compromise because you care about this person you know and you almost want to like uh be more beneficial to them by 

234.67 238.29 B: you know [noise] i don't know conceding to what they might want 

237.71 246.42 A: yeah but that's another thing too i think that's cool about my life partner is that we have these compromises that we make for each other that aren't really a compromise like 

241.68 242.55 B: right 

246.30 252.89 A: like you say if you really don't need the closet space it's like okay i'll put my three suits there and you can have the whole rest of [laughter] the closet you know 

252.46 253.50 B: right 

252.88 257.74 A: um i find that a lot of my strengths and weaknesses are 

257.60 272.41 A: opposite what her's are you know the- we're very complementary to each other we're i'm very technical and she's very um [lipsmack] you know organized and can can make m- you know like organize everything that i'm do- we run two businesses together 

271.75 272.93 B: oh right on 

272.35 273.57 A: and um 

274.07 285.89 A: i take care of all the technical stuff all the you know like building the web pages all the technology of the business and everything and she deals she's very attractive and very outgoing and very you know 

285.80 292.69 A: can can talk to people and stuff [laughter] you know so she takes care of that yeah so um 

286.43 287.78 B: yeah i can 

288.69 290.80 B: i can definitely relate 

292.38 295.89 B: well that's another thing you know we're partners sorry to cut you off there man 

295.52 296.55 A: no that's cool 

295.90 302.60 B: um if you can't complement each other like my weaknesses um when i was in the marines i was not tactful 

302.26 303.32 A: yeah 

302.71 316.03 B: i now understand that people have feelings because in my job i'm not quite a boss but i really come right out and tell people how i think and i don't and i'm everything i'm really strong in 

303.64 305.08 A: [laughter] 

306.77 307.65 A: (( mhm )) 

311.91 313.06 A: yeah 

316.07 320.53 B: she is super weak in [sigh] and vice versa everything she's strong in 

320.65 323.08 B: i'm weak like i'm not tactful 

321.62 322.46 A: yeah 

323.14 324.13 A: (( [laughter] )) 

323.35 326.41 B: i'm as sensitive as a doorknob sometimes 

325.81 327.65 A: yeah 

326.64 339.92 B: and unfortunately she's a lot more tolerant or i'm a lot less tolerant than she is if she wasn't so tolerant uh man it'd be a lot worse in the house i think than it already is [laughter] 

338.98 340.64 A: yeah 

340.69 343.23 B: 'cause dealing with me it's not easy 

342.61 353.68 A: no [laughter] and that's another cool thing about a life partner is that they've got years to temper you and say [laughter] well you doorknob you know like you're going to have to pay attention to people's feelings and whatnot 

349.32 350.33 B: yeah 

353.55 359.31 A: it's just kind of funny that that uh i don't know i've seen a lot of that myself to where i 

355.12 356.48 B: oh definitely 

359.36 372.79 A: you know forget about this or that you know it it's none of well okay here but if you want this then you have to do wait a minute is that why i've been failing my whole life [laughter] you know it's like one simple little trick that they can teach you to you know 

372.37 384.04 B: well 'cause like sh- she's good at people me i i don't care for them as much as she does i mean it doesn't mean i'm mean or nothing but in the marines um i was you know i was 

372.86 373.80 A: (( be kind of )) 

374.96 375.95 A: mhm 

378.90 379.72 A: yeah 

380.44 381.97 A: [laughter] 

384.48 395.76 B: you know i had a job where i had to be alone most of the time or a very select amount of people it's not like we all hung out at the bandstand and she deals with people and you know she sells furniture so 

391.23 392.17 A: yeah 

395.69 405.55 B: she's gotta you know deal people and does interior design and you know me a blanket on the window is curtains to me but no no we gotta match everything when 

403.63 405.04 A: (( [laughter] )) 

405.10 407.31 A: [laughter] 

406.03 410.79 B: [sigh] the curtains gotta match the shades and the shades gotta match the carpet and 

408.26 410.06 A: yeah 

410.51 421.15 A: yeah that's an- my my old life partner i guess the one that i thought would be my life partner um my ex wife was like that with the curtains even you know it was like uh 

421.78 432.47 A: like to you a a blanket over the window is a curtain you know to me it's the same thing and she needed everything to match and it's ran ran into tens of thousands of dollars getting things to match 

424.76 425.73 B: (( [noise] right )) 

432.37 442.58 A: when i didn't have a motorcycle that i very much wanted you know [laughter] it's like what where does it end does it end at the new bedroom set or the new curtains or the new you know and then then 

435.59 436.86 B: oh yeah it's like 

441.20 443.83 B: but it never really ends you know that 

442.50 448.96 A: yeah then again it comes into trust and the compromise that we didn't have that made the divorce you know i didn't trust 

448.80 463.55 A: that she would look out for my needs before she's sa- satisfied hers you know and i didn't trust that our goals in life would be the same i think that's a really critical thing in in your life partner is that you're going the same direction you know 

453.56 454.68 B: right 

463.36 477.74 A: the person i'm with now we see down the road together we wanna you know we have our businesses together right now we have another business that we wanna open after we've built enough capital and experience to do it and you know we we can plan ahead it really is like 

473.94 475.11 B: oh right on 

477.74 484.96 A: like when i plan with her i feel i'm planning my life [laughter] you know what i mean like it just fits you know 

482.24 484.46 B: good 'cause i i'm in a trade and 

484.55 494.17 B: and you know like i'm in a trade and you know the missus she's you know doing her thing but basically our worlds uh never really 

494.40 501.69 B: like blend except for home like you guys which is good 'cause then you can work and you know build those bonds stronger 

499.20 499.91 A: (( yes )) 

501.49 505.61 A: yeah and then again there's a lot of stress there too [laughter] 

502.77 504.29 B: doesn't it get a little 

504.72 507.56 B: doesn't it get a little um too much sometimes 

506.90 509.31 A: oh absolutely absolutely 

508.00 514.33 B: it's like you know when i get this argument going and now i gotta deal with it at work oh and i gotta do it at home again 

512.32 513.47 A: yeah 

513.83 524.94 A: well it's the same argument you know it's like uh it's like you you when you're together that much you you have the same way of being at work and at home or whatever i mean they just carry over into each other so it's a 

524.28 529.82 B: [mn] i mean i i get to go to work and you know i can leave the argument at home for a while 

526.96 527.93 A: get away 

529.14 533.25 A: yeah yeah we work on separate things too but it's not uh 

530.32 531.19 B: you know 

533.51 535.32 B: but you you know it's also you know 

535.47 538.91 B: just there's you got you'll know like when you 

538.92 543.60 B: you meet that right person like something inside wakes up and goes dum da dah and 

543.01 544.72 A: yeah i 

543.63 545.36 B: you instantly know 

544.74 547.70 A: i it's really strange but i i uh 

547.85 556.61 A: the the day i met this person i i really knew there was something very special about her and the more i got to know her the more it became clear what it was 

556.24 557.43 B: (( oh right on )) 

556.83 562.09 A: you know [laughter] and i i really did feel it and it's been you know it's only been a couple of years but 

562.37 575.63 A: i i can't describe how it's you know what i mean like like the intimacy in the relationship i've i've never had intimacy like this and and i think the you know the first thing we said was like trust and and [laughter] you know and 

574.32 580.67 B: it's 'cause you truly you truly love this person so when you share intimate times it's 

575.74 576.30 A: (( yeah )) 

580.91 590.41 B: you know it's more special well i mean just even just like watching a movie something it's a little bit more special because you really dig the person you're with 

581.14 582.94 A: well well all the times 

583.40 584.03 A: (( mm )) 

585.95 586.94 A: yeah 

589.80 591.69 A: yeah 

590.58 599.35 B: it's not someone that you're just dealing with it's like okay you know okay you can sit next to me if you want whatever not like that but you know what i'm talking about [sigh] 

592.93 594.17 A: yeah 

598.59 599.87 A: yeah
