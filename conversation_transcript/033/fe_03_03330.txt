23.34 25.06 B: okay well i think i 

24.27 25.27 A: um 

26.01 33.13 B: i guess we'll get get started no i was going to say i guess we'll just get start- uh uh i guess the topic they said was uh what we look for in 

26.19 27.27 A: go ahead 

33.60 34.98 B: a life partner 

34.99 36.15 A: yes 

35.38 36.27 B: (( ah )) 

36.40 41.16 B: i would begi- i guess someone i think the first thing that comes to mind is is trust for me 

41.26 43.36 B: uh someone that i c- you know can 

43.43 46.00 B: uh count on and and 

46.24 49.14 B: and know that you know what they say is what they mean [laughter] 

49.06 55.37 A: [laughter] that would usually be a good thing i hope that you have that with your wife or your your partner 

55.74 56.80 A: [laughter] 

56.08 67.91 B: i do i i am married but uh uh i have been married a couple of years but i i feel uh which is still early i guess but uh i definitely have i think a trust and we have a pretty open communication 

68.26 76.74 A: well i actually just married for the first time in september and being almost forty i was the last of my friends to 

77.01 83.45 A: to do that um to make that commitment but that was very important for me to find you 

84.32 90.57 A: know really i think the right person is somebody who was going to be a keeper i don't believe in divorce 

90.35 93.73 B: right no i i agree and and and i'm not a uh 

93.71 98.26 B: definitely uh wouldn't want divorce to occur and and i think that's one reason you 

98.06 110.92 B: it i waited a little bit longer i'm not uh forty but about uh thirty two and uh waited a little bit longer than some you know some of my folks got married right out of uh high school actually and then i had some more r- right near college uh 

110.91 125.44 B: another thing is i think to look for is for someone that's kinda my wife is kinda my best friend you know so someone that you enjoy hanging out [laughter] with and can uh you know spend it's a lotta time to spend with each with each other i think so uh [laughter] right 

124.58 136.21 A: it is and and i've often times said to my friends well you know that's wonderful that you have a romantic relationship but what do you do for the other twenty three hours and forty five minutes of the day 

136.26 149.00 A: you know like it's the person you have to wake up next to like all the time and go to sleep next to all the time and that means when you're sick or if you've got hurt or if you 

148.97 152.10 A: are skinny or fat or you know 

152.40 160.79 A: w- whatever and [lipsmack] um you know don't just think about oh well you know we have so much fun when we 

160.85 164.53 A: you know go on vacation or we have so much fun 

165.16 166.17 A: you know 

165.75 179.24 B: yeah i think it's definitely the day to day you know just the everyd- the the regular stuff s- sure you have highs and lows and those highs are either vacation or you know the kind of the special but it's like you said i guess the you said it pretty well the other twenty three hours of the day 

178.63 186.72 A: [laughter] exactly yeah it's the boring things of going to the grocery store doing the laundry paying the bills 

179.20 182.10 B: uh you you [laughter] you've got to be able 

186.04 190.34 B: right and there's give and take in everything too you know and i think we we look in 

190.42 198.28 B: my relationship we look for you know strength in one person and weakness you know i i kinda like to do the books and the finances and that's you know course we 

198.06 206.37 B: communicate about all those but that's something you know that i en- kinda enjoy doing you know and she doesn't so i think we kinda look for things that ah 

206.39 208.02 B: y- ah you know 

207.79 210.83 A: [mn] i call it constructive conflict 

208.05 209.24 B: the the strength 

210.55 212.67 B: yeah that's [laughter] good yeah 

212.26 225.19 A: because it it creates conflict the differences in my husband and i create conflict in our relationship but i think it's constructive conflict because we're always challenging each other to be 

224.95 234.32 A: the best person that we can be and um you know we have two different points of view and and that's okay we w- you know we grew up in 

234.35 245.69 A: different families in different areas my husband's actually not from the united states he's from italy so he has a m- a much different outlook sometimes on things than i do 

246.26 247.65 A: you know but 

246.43 248.10 B: (( mm hm right )) 

247.67 256.56 A: most of the times like you said his strengths are areas where maybe you know those aren't my best areas and and vice versa so 

256.92 262.09 A: you know i think it hopefully uh it works out pretty well 

262.08 265.72 B: any other characteristics that you come that you think of that come to mind mm 

265.52 271.52 A: for me a sense of humor is also very important i think life is too short to take it too seriously 

271.04 273.65 B: you gotta have some fun in there [laughter] 

272.74 278.60 A: yeah and i think it's important to be able to laugh at yourself as well as i know that um 

278.68 281.80 A: you know laughter can make light of uh 

282.44 288.58 A: you know uh mm difficult situations or it can add brevity to situations so 

288.66 290.58 A: um i think that's 

291.19 303.12 A: really important you know and and i think like again i mean we like some of the same things we don't like some of the same things and i think that's fine um i think actually him 

303.12 309.09 A: maintaining his individuality if you will and me doing the same actually 

309.92 314.66 A: adds to the strength of our relationship so i think that's important 

315.50 316.87 A: what do you think 

316.27 321.51 B: oh no i i agree i was trying to think of other i suppose kind of covered trust and uh 

321.37 333.08 B: uh another thing i thought of is you you they say opposites attract and i think y- you kinda mentioned this too i i think you gotta have some similarity you know but i think it's good to have um i think a mixture i- is kinda good uh 

325.23 325.86 A: (( [laughter] )) 

332.35 338.04 A: well i'm sure you have friends like i do where i- it almost seems like maybe they're too much alike 

337.34 341.57 B: yeah they've married their [laughter] [laughter] yeah [laughter] 

339.42 349.95 A: their brother or their sister maybe instead of you know it's um ah why do people look like each other after a while and better yet why do people look like their dogs 

346.71 348.25 B: well i don't know [laughter] 

350.20 355.69 B: [laughter] that's true i don't i can't explain either one of those but [laughter] i i d- i do notice that uh 

350.59 351.51 A: [laughter] 

352.49 354.02 A: [laughter]
