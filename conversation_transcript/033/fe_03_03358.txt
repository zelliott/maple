15.89 21.86 B: oh you okay so but you know what to look for in a life partner i guess [laughter] 

20.44 24.42 A: [laughter] i know what not to look for in a life partner 

23.84 25.77 B: you know i think that works 

25.32 26.99 A: i've been divorced 

26.93 33.55 B: yeah so have i but i remarried about eight years ago we're about to have our eighth anniversary in three days 

33.69 35.05 B: and it's [sigh] 

35.09 42.35 B: it's different the second time around because y- yeah oh very much so i was divorced for eighteen years and you can um 

36.78 37.93 A: is it 

42.74 46.56 B: is is that you know exactly who you are and what your values are 

46.69 53.96 B: and we were married the first time a with kids you know just out of high school and i think you know nothing [laughter] 

52.55 54.77 A: [laughter] 

54.73 64.42 B: and so it really you know it really is a very ah ah way of defining who you are and what you need in a person to grow old with and spend the rest of your life with [laughter] you 

63.76 66.37 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

65.21 68.84 B: know so what do you think the first priorities are 

69.12 79.07 A: oh that's hard um [lipsmack] i know from my first marriage i learnt a lot that um a lot of things that i needed and wanted as a person 

75.47 76.03 B: (( [noise] )) 

79.19 82.12 A: ah to be fulfilled such as ah 

82.40 86.74 A: having time to myself we had four kids and 

85.76 87.06 B: (( so do we )) 

86.78 93.82 A: and i i stayed home and raised the kids and i didn't tend to things that 

93.67 107.32 A: i was interested in my whole life revolved around you know doing things for the kids running errands you know taking care of the house ah that sort of thing and i didn't find time for myself and ah 

107.65 109.83 A: i think that was a big loss 

108.11 108.93 B: [noise] 

110.30 116.82 B: [noise] yeah it is you know it is a an immersion kind of thing when children come along they're all consuming but then 

116.92 128.70 B: later on in life when i don't know how old you are but i'm in my sixties and they nurture you then they come back and nurture you and it's really so neat how that works out but ah 

128.73 131.30 B: my first husband was a workaholic 

131.49 138.34 B: and he wasn't very family oriented so it pulled me in the children's direction to be mother and daddy but um 

136.87 137.90 A: mhm 

138.57 145.42 B: i know that and the second w- well my first value in a husband or or [mn] would be to to 'cause i'm a christian 

145.43 147.06 B: and he- he'd have to have 

146.93 161.83 B: christian beliefs which 'course the christian beliefs is fidelity [laughter] and ah i didn't have that in my marriage and ah a- a- and that's a big loss when you don't have that you can't trust and you don't have that faithfulness factor 

152.14 153.39 A: [laughter] 

160.54 161.54 A: yeah y- 

161.66 163.67 A: you gotta have trust 

161.88 162.61 B: (( um )) 

163.06 171.04 B: gotta have trust and you got to have acceptance and someone that's really interested in you um my husband now is a lot younger than i am 

171.03 179.38 B: and h- he encourages me in everything i'm a freelance writer and he pushes me to do what i want to do which is exactly what you were talking about 

179.15 180.04 A: right 

179.32 192.11 B: he wants me to he'll say honey now for last ah for my birthday a few weeks ago he gave me all these um portfolios and i said h- what is that for [laughter] he said they're for your manuscripts you gotta get busy filling them up it 

191.26 192.86 A: [laughter] 

192.20 194.29 B: and i was so thrilled that ah 

194.56 205.03 B: that he you know cares about what i care about 'cause i started writing a book during my first marriage and one of the grief was that he never once asked me what i was writing about [laughter] [mn] 

204.07 206.51 A: oh goodness not interested enough 

205.87 211.15 B: not interested and and and paul the my second husband now wants to know everything 

211.14 220.95 B: that i'm writing about he says read it to me read it to me and he's my best critic and so i think that's a real being interested in things you're interested in is really important 'cause it helps you to grow together 

220.72 223.45 A: right i i think a life partner 

221.40 222.32 B: and 

223.49 226.17 A: um should be a friend 

226.25 237.04 A: you know like you say somebody that's interested in what you're doing and and not so um well my first marriage it was like he was so self centered everything revolved around him 

226.51 227.83 B: absolutely 

227.97 229.15 B: (( absolutely )) 

237.10 237.96 A: um 

237.75 247.90 B: well that's the way it was with mine too he ah he was a career oriented and and he wanted to accumulate a large fortune and so money was a real strong ah draw for him 

239.13 240.31 A: right 

247.53 248.80 A: mine too 

248.58 254.39 B: and i could care less about money i just want to enjoy life and enjoy the day that i'm living in you know 

254.42 261.36 B: and so our values were different but we didn't decide that until we grew up 'cause as i said we were both kids but with ah 

259.79 260.72 A: right 

261.41 264.52 B: with my husband now he's never been married before and um 

264.87 268.88 B: he just makes life so exciting he we enjoy the same things 

268.75 280.43 B: we don't do t._v. a lot we read books out loud to each other a- and there's a lot of togetherness in that i mean in the eight years we've been married we've read about two hundred books out loud to each other including the entire bible 

271.72 273.49 A: oh wow that's neat 

280.50 293.73 B: and that is [mn] so thrilling to ah to me 'cause it's just get a book and we have reading night and we just read and that's we go out in the mountains and ah hiking in the summer time and we carry always carry books to read 

293.69 305.00 B: or in the winter time we sit by the fire a lot and that keeps ah a real romance in your life and i think that's a big factor i think women need romance 

304.38 305.87 A: i think so too 

305.42 313.30 B: they need to feel that there is i care about you now to my first husband i used to say do you love me and he'd say why do you ask i'd say because you never tell me and he'd say we- i shouldn't have to 

313.48 322.60 B: love is [mn] you know like that movie love is never having to say you're sorry but paul tells me a thousand times a a week how much he loves me and he does little things that are 

316.79 318.17 A: right [laughter] 

322.65 327.97 B: special to say i love you like like every month on the thirteenth of the month which is our anniversary 

327.93 340.80 B: he does something for me and i never know what it is like i could pull out my chair at the breakfast table and there's a little gift there or there'll be a card on my pillow in the morning and just something like that all the time and it just keeps 

338.53 339.39 A: right 

340.18 342.45 A: wow that's fantastic 

341.87 343.65 B: keeps the romance there 

343.04 344.91 A: you've got one in a million 

344.40 350.76 B: yeah he is he is and i have four kids and they adore him they look to him they look up to him and 

350.12 351.98 A: does he have an older brother 

351.85 355.40 B: yes he does but he's married [laughter] 

352.50 358.42 A: [laughter] [laughter] i'm looking i'm looking [laughter] 

356.83 363.13 B: i tell ya and y- you know it's just we became best friends he just hang out you know he was in a study group that i was teaching in 

363.05 372.20 B: and he would just come over and say i've got some questions for you and i say well won't you stay for supper and he'd be going hiking or rock climbing and somebody would cancel a date with him and i said i'll go 

372.12 384.37 B: and for like a year and a half we were best buddies i mean it never occurred to me that [mn] there would be romance there until he goes out of town for a long trip and when he comes back it's like [sigh] i couldn't stand it you know [laughter] 

383.29 385.14 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

384.28 391.02 B: and when he asked me to marry him i mo- it was agonizing for a short period of time [mn] because the age difference and but he doesn't see the age 

391.06 393.84 B: a- a- and that's what's so exciting it doesn't matter 

392.58 394.83 A: well age should- shouldn't matter 

394.37 403.31 B: no it shouldn't and it's just ah it's just a number and so we're you know he's exploring ah being a parent and a grandparent and ah 

400.93 401.79 A: [noise] 

403.31 417.32 B: and that's also exciting to him and so it [mn] so that those kinda together things makes it so wonderful he loves to fish and he taught me how to fly fish and that was one of the things that i liked about him is i ask him to do that and 

417.39 422.45 B: so he says you wanna go fishing and and that was how our friendship began to be really 

422.28 425.33 A: doing things together that's that's a big one 

423.33 429.10 B: mhm doin- and we still do we still do and i think that's a that's a really important one too and 

429.17 434.33 B: also we never lose sight of what's important to us like we eat by candle light every night 

434.56 445.69 B: and ah we sit have a sit down breakfast every day and now that the weather's getting warmer we've opened up the sun porch we go out and we take our meals out there he's got christmas lights running around the porch and we turn those on 

445.66 450.53 B: and it's just [mn] he put stars on the ceiling so that we can dance under the stars in the winter time 

449.30 451.96 A: [laughter] that's cute 

451.54 454.48 B: (( and i'll tell you that those little things )) 

454.69 462.94 B: count for keeping your you- you so ex- ex- exciting and i think there's a mystery there to not knowing what to expect that's kinda good too you know 

463.10 465.78 A: oh yeah yeah that sounds great 

465.86 473.21 B: so i know those are the important ah important things in us and and ah and to us because it's proven over the years that 

473.32 475.10 B: they keep ah 

474.96 482.79 B: keep us excited about each other and a- also we have friends so we don't just live to ourselves i mean we have [sigh] we teach a class at church and [mn] 

482.58 495.13 B: we fellowship with ah other people in the church and other couples and i- i- it's kinda after they get over the you know the fact that we're the odd couple we usually have a lot of acceptance and a lot of fun 

496.53 497.36 B: (( and it )) 

496.84 505.43 A: well it sounds like you've summed it all up you've you made the mistakes the first time around and and sounds like you've fixed them all all the second time 

501.81 502.65 B: (( yeah i- i- )) 

504.91 514.10 B: it was it's true eighteen years separation y- you find out who you are and what your values were and first of all and i would give you this as a way of s- something i learned 

514.17 521.35 B: if i'm content with my life the way it is and i'd be happy to live the way that you know my children were nurturing for me they were very special 

521.56 532.33 B: i could live the rest of my life like that i was not looking for a partner and i think once you come to that then you can handle a second relationship and see it in reality for what it is it's not a panic to 

532.57 538.48 B: i can't be alone kind of thing and a lot of people ask me about this and i do some counseling in the churches 

538.52 543.38 B: girls get unhappily divorced or breaking up with their boyfriend they immediately want another relationship 

543.52 549.72 B: and i would tell them you can make a mistake quicker that way by just not finding how to be happy without someone and then 

549.03 550.07 A: right 

550.07 554.42 B: and then when so- you turn around and someone's there you're much more able to assess 

554.45 556.64 B: whether this is a 

556.85 559.95 B: a a companion that you wanna grow old with the rest of your life 

560.43 562.99 B: and it and and it does happen 

564.08 575.26 B: loneliness is a terrible thing and it's something i i never really had with four kids [laughter] i bet you're the same way [laughter] now it's grand kids i mean you're all i've [mn] now there's s- six grandkids 

568.50 571.12 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

571.43 572.19 A: (( yeah )) 

575.45 578.11 A: oh gosh i don't have any grandkids yet 

578.01 583.56 B: well my ah my children are all professional and and ah th they they live all over the world and my 

583.67 585.67 B: husband is [mn] 

585.78 590.85 B: combining my birthday with anniversary gift and he has invited all of them from last year 

591.18 599.89 B: ah to a beach vacation for one week so they all can be together and all of the grandchildren can be together and we're going to go memorial day weekend for a whole week
