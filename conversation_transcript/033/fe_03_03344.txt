283.42 284.27 B: (( well )) 

285.51 295.03 B: i can understand that my first go round was the same way but the second time around it was much better than that and we were together for sixteen years before he passed away so 

295.47 296.47 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

295.85 296.91 B: it uh it's 

296.83 299.96 B: marriage is tough i mean it takes two people and 

299.85 307.25 B: you both have to work at it and it's a give and take situation and sometimes you give more than the other and vice versa but 

307.14 321.24 B: it it can work it just is something that people have to understand that they have to work at you know it's not something that's just going to happen there's very few relationships that i know of that just fall together and are happily ever after without working at it so 

321.05 334.32 A: well i mean i i i quest- now the university of pennsylvania who i i i'm assuming they rerecord that they record these and they use them for i i i don't know what they use them for but how w- how does it w- 

334.33 340.86 A: w- w- when they gather all this information up uh what is it like a poll they take or a something of that sort or what mm 

340.80 353.24 B: well the way i understand it is they record the messages and then they take what they can from it as part of their research project i uh left a comment from the other day when i talked to this gentleman about sports on t._v. 

353.16 357.96 B: i mean i watch sports on t._v. i'm not a avid sports fan but

368.01 381.50 B: i told them i said you know you need to warn people about this and give them a little more insight on what you're expecting because when you throw two people together who've never met and they're talking to each other on the phone about a topic that's just kind of out of the blue 

381.39 386.93 B: it's hard to come up with i would think material they could use for anything 

386.77 390.51 A: yeah right well no you draw on your life experiences that's that's all it is 

390.41 392.26 B: yeah so but 

391.46 402.58 A: that that's really all it is i i i um you know i you g- i yeah yeah you're probably right oh but y- you draw on life experiences and i maybe they're ga- gathering information
