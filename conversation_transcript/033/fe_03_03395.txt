31.58 33.68 B: okay nice to meet you 

33.24 35.44 A: same here [noise] 

34.75 37.24 B: so what do you look for in a life partner 

36.13 39.93 A: (( [noise] [noise] um well one of the most important things is honesty )) 

39.82 41.61 B: [noise] yeah that 

40.27 43.24 A: i think that ties in to a lot of other things 

42.71 43.65 B: (( yes )) 

43.73 44.60 A: (( you know )) 

43.91 49.79 B: i think one of the things i look for is ah someone who will [noise] accept me as i am 

49.60 50.58 A: right 

50.63 53.43 B: not try to change me and understand that 

53.65 55.49 B: i have my own ways 

55.26 57.94 A: right right i agree with you there 

58.19 59.33 A: um 

59.80 60.53 A: (( and )) 

59.81 61.08 B: humor that's 

60.88 70.31 A: oh [laughter] that's exactly what i was going to say somebody that's definitely a sense of humor and you know not just uh when they think they're funny but they can see the sense of humor that may be different from theirs 

61.13 62.02 B: humor 

64.66 65.52 B: yeah 

70.15 71.79 B: (( yes yeah )) 

70.56 81.38 A: you know 'cause not everybody has you know some people are different and it's you know b- what may be funny to you may not be funny to me but i can at least say okay that's them [laughter] you know so but um 

78.41 79.93 B: yeah that's right 

81.56 86.29 B: then and now my boyfriend now he says you're stealing my humor 'cause i 

81.91 82.70 A: and 

85.34 87.89 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

86.84 95.12 B: i didn't used to find his humor quite as funny and now i find myself using it so i must be getting getting used to it [noise] 

94.81 102.93 A: right 'cause i know one of the things i like i'm just recently ah out of a long term relationship and ah one of the things i felt was lacking was uh the appreciation 

102.95 110.99 A: you know not and doesn't have to be spoken but just you know i guess i guess i should say spoken and [mn] just so that people know that you know 

111.58 115.46 A: not that you're going above and beyond necessarily but at least if they appreciate what you are doing 

115.59 116.82 B: that's right [noise] 

115.72 122.83 A: i guess you know i think people don't realise is you could get so much worse out there and then when you are with someone who who is trying 

123.12 125.37 A: i don't know it just one of those things [noise] that ah 

125.12 129.50 B: well sometimes it just feels as if the person is taken for granted you know 

128.77 130.20 A: oh definitely 

130.17 131.28 B: you know i 

130.41 131.76 A: that's a big thing 

131.62 137.21 B: and and you know it doesn't you know you don't have to have someone constantly telling you how much 

136.60 137.87 A: right right 

137.50 142.40 B: but you know you can there's just things that they can say indirectly even 

141.80 151.26 A: right and it's small things which doesn't cost people any money so you you know but i just think people get comfortable you get complacent with who you're with and you know they say it's easier to get 'em but harder to keep 'em 

142.52 143.32 B: so 

151.17 152.51 B: that's true 

151.50 160.37 A: so you get 'em and you say okay you know then you forget the things you did initially that you know attracted you to that person or was able to you know keep the interest so 

158.96 160.60 B: yes that's true 

160.78 173.00 A: but ah i guess it's two sides too 'cause some men say then oh well you know they're not doing you know they used to keep theirself up now they kinda just you know do whatever [laughter] so [mn] i guess it's definitely a you need a balance there you know to try to keep things going 

171.19 172.44 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

172.69 175.80 B: i think balance is the the key word there 

175.12 176.80 A: right right 

176.15 178.58 B: in in in many ways i 

177.93 179.34 A: right right 

178.35 191.95 B: think you know that's part of you know all something that i look for in a life partner is someone who can [sigh] find i mean it may be that [noise] y- you never find the perfect balance but something that's you know looking for the right balance there 

188.28 189.80 A: of course right 

191.32 193.80 A: right well someone who's willing to at least meet you half way 

193.77 194.88 B: (( yes [mn] )) 

194.34 197.44 A: you know but and and not just ah 

197.28 211.95 A: i definitely don't like the complainer type i'll tell you that right now i don't like i don't like someone who complains about something but doesn't do anything to try to fix it just you know this is a i can't believe this is the way it is but it's like when you can do something about a situation you just don't but you complain about it it drives me crazy 

200.05 200.87 B: oh 

211.83 218.26 B: well you know what my boyfriend says is the funny thing about excuses is they always sound like excuses 

217.86 219.90 A: right [laughter] 

218.60 222.33 B: and [laughter] i've used that on him a couple times so but 

221.26 223.81 A: [laughter] 

222.77 229.20 B: but no- but you know at least it you know it shows that he is he doesn't try to make excuses for himself you know 

228.44 229.72 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

229.17 243.17 B: he accepts you know he has mistakes in the past and you know some things you know i say or well you know there was one time when he was in his a low period in his life and he had a lot of his belongings in a storage shed 

232.56 233.47 A: right 

242.74 243.73 A: right 

243.13 255.97 B: and you know then he didn't pay the rent and he lost them and i said oh how can you stand that and he said well you just don't think about stuff like that [noise] you know so he's able to go forward you know from saying [noise] 

250.16 251.02 A: right 

255.36 265.01 A: right yeah no i know exactly what you mean but ah yeah a lot of people try me i think that's the most i mean no one like you said no one's going to be perfect but at least if people make an attempt 

264.90 265.83 B: yes 

265.23 272.28 A: to to try things 'cause you know i guess you know you get somebody that they say oh i got somebody and they just kinda go on with life and you say you know you're kinda like 

272.43 274.67 A: has anyone noticed what's going on 

274.72 278.35 A: (( but you know so but [sigh] )) 

275.59 277.50 B: yeah that's true 

277.99 281.83 B: [noise] yeah [noise] well it's not easy 

278.51 279.45 A: but i 

282.11 289.60 B: you know it's just like a needle in a haystack to find someone you know a a life partner that will 

285.46 286.39 A: right 

289.89 296.30 B: well you you can get along with and be happy with and of course no one is going to be happy every day but 

292.04 293.96 A: right right 

295.23 296.91 A: right exactly 

296.78 297.60 B: but 

297.01 299.61 A: but i like the majority of the time you think 

299.63 313.78 A: just say y- you're content you know that i- or if even if problems arise and how they handle the problems is another thing you know if someone's quick to fly off the handle at a problem versus someone who's like you know they're willing to talk about it or even if they're willing to walk away for a little bit just to calm down 

313.74 319.36 A: you know those are the kinda things i look for too how do they handle you know stress or if something's not going well 

313.94 314.85 B: right 

315.97 316.65 B: yeah 

319.08 333.17 B: are they you know they don't you know like some people they just won't drop something that goes wrong you know they go on and on and on and on you don't need to be scolded when you're an adult so if you say you're sorry then you know it should be dropped 

324.10 325.05 A: right 

325.83 327.12 A: exactly 

327.56 328.44 A: right 

328.46 330.69 A: exactly right 

332.79 347.41 A: right exactly don't keep going on right or being negative about it you know that i don't like that either if you you if you're trying to do something to better yourself and and the person you know i don't know if they're jealous or what but you don't feel the support of you know when you're trying to do something and it's oh don't waste your time on that 

333.43 334.26 B: so 

347.41 355.54 A: you know that's i definitely can't deal with the the lack of support 'cause figure you got me you gonna already get that from other people but you don't wanna get that from somebody you're with 

347.54 348.50 B: (( i know )) 

355.71 356.94 B: that's true 

355.74 358.11 A: (( you know that you're going to see on a regular basis you )) 

358.09 359.12 B: yes 

358.67 360.28 A: know [noise] so 

359.29 360.06 B: (( yeah )) 

360.11 364.55 B: so i it's just nice you know when you know that someone is [noise] behind you you 

364.31 365.36 A: right 

364.79 368.79 B: have you know the support is there if you need it you know 

368.21 381.13 A: right yeah i'm guess i'm looking for that team player someone who's like okay if things are going bad you know even you know don't worry i'm behind you don't worry we can do it you know it's supposed to be you and that person against all obstacles and things that come your way you know that's the kind of attitude i like someone to have 

381.24 382.20 A: (( you know )) 

381.28 383.17 B: yes yeah very true 

382.61 383.49 A: (( so )) 

383.50 392.91 A: like you said it's very difficult to [laughter] to find it 'cause you know it isn't you're not looking for all of it but then you have th- the other person they're looking for some of the things and it's like i think people are not 

392.83 399.01 A: that you don't wanna set your standards high but i think you gotta be somewhat flexible and ah work in with people 

396.99 397.74 B: (( yeah )) 

398.92 409.37 B: yes ah flexible and and it's and it's nice because you know i've [noise] i've finally learned that you know that there is isn't any reason to swim up stream 

409.10 409.97 A: right 

409.26 422.28 B: you know you've got to be flexible about things 'cause you know it's not you know like it's like [noise] ah what i used to have a plaque that said ah you know any way is right or you know [mn] i i'm 

411.77 412.68 A: right 

422.20 427.12 B: i i'm flexible just don't try to change me or something like that you know 

424.37 425.51 A: right 

426.49 427.37 A: right 

427.34 436.64 B: and and i think that's a lot of people have the idea that they are flexible but and you know then when it comes down to something where they might have to 

432.04 433.01 A: right 

433.70 434.53 A: (( right )) 

436.67 439.05 B: sacrifice something you know to 

438.25 441.78 A: right exactly yeah i know that's true 

439.34 441.64 B: to get along then 

441.80 443.64 B: it's a different story 

442.16 442.81 A: (( but )) 

443.35 444.29 A: right 

444.34 452.99 A: yeah if people could just see ah i think beyond like even with looks some people i i mean i'm but hopefully people can see past that you know someone who can see the personality 

453.03 466.17 A: of a person and stuff 'cause looks could come and go you know in a flash and then they get so wrapped up in that and then they forget all about the person [laughter] behind it you know or the physical characteristics of someone and ah you know the fact 

456.17 457.76 B: that's that's true 

461.20 462.10 B: right 

465.33 469.19 B: the older that you get the less important physical characteristics 

468.36 473.92 A: exactly definitely right you see what's more important yeah 

469.83 470.55 B: (( become )) 

471.13 471.97 B: yeah 

472.28 481.30 B: right and i'm just you know grateful that my boyfriend you know he keeps saying oh you're just your body is perfect but i know it's not you know but i'm 

478.58 479.75 A: right 

479.92 481.67 A: right right exactly 

481.41 491.91 B: um but i think that you know the way that we feel about each other we might have like a kind of distorted view of each other's physical characteristics because we care you know 

484.96 485.80 A: right 

489.46 491.07 A: right right 

491.22 506.00 A: yeah i also like someone who's a sensitive it's and that's the one quality i think is very hard to find in men is that y- you don't want with someone who's so sensitive that they're you know they cry at every little thing you say but someone who can at times know when to be sensitive when someone is talking about something 

492.95 493.78 B: (( so )) 

505.95 512.28 A: you know and express you know show some emotion that you're like okay like 'cause you know talk to people about it and they're like okay [laughter] 

512.24 513.32 B: yeah 

512.29 518.57 A: and it's an emotional subject and it's just like hm [laughter] okay and i think 

517.58 518.64 B: uh well 

519.03 526.41 B: the i think that you know the the longer a person lives you know then the more that they have experienced things and then they're more 

525.43 526.97 A: (( [mn] right )) 

526.42 536.46 B: sympathetic you know then to other people's you know plights and problems i mean it's just i mean it's just [noise] like if you lose you know your parents or something then you 

527.80 528.83 A: right 

530.68 532.01 A: right right 

535.57 536.53 A: right 

536.39 541.55 B: you have a more of a feeling of what another person is going through when that happens to them 

539.29 542.57 A: right exactly no that's definitely true 

542.61 552.42 A: is ah yeah but that's the trend it seems to be like now you're seeing uh women younger women with older men more because i think people are like looking more for you know not to the ah 

552.67 564.74 A: the ah intangible things people are looking more now that you know getting away from the money and i mean that's nice and everything but that ah i've seen a lot of people go for the money and then the guy's a jerk you know so i guess it depends on what you're willing to settle for 

561.48 562.48 B: yes 

564.85 565.73 A: so 

564.97 566.26 B: that's true 

565.94 570.31 A: but i need to be able to sleep comfortable at night so [laughter] i guess i'll 

568.81 569.71 B: yeah 

570.34 573.92 A: you know you settle for that you know that's what you'll get so 

573.81 575.51 B: (( oh that's true [mn] )) 

574.92 577.36 A: how long have you been with ah your boyfriend 

577.08 580.00 B: i've been we've been together fourteen years now 

579.39 583.83 A: oh wow okay okay yeah so you guys seem like a match then right [laughter] 

580.69 581.88 B: um so i 

582.71 586.41 B: (( [noise] yeah i think we're going to be getting married soon so )) 

585.73 587.26 A: wow okay
