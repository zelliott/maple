152.52 157.04 A: yeah oh well i still like i was saying around christmas time my wife decided at 

156.83 161.68 A: fifty four she wanted to uh [sigh] strike out and start her own business and um [sigh] 

160.45 161.48 B: really 

161.50 171.95 A: she's a very independent person to begin with she managed a doctor's office part time before we moved down here [sigh] and um i always thought jack of all trades master of none 

171.72 182.97 A: but uh she got on uh she's very computer literature and between the computer and the cell phone [sigh] and a lot uh sending out resumes she started her own uh merchandising company and we do uh 

182.77 189.53 A: [sigh] resets in supermarkets and sales demos and wine and cheese demonstrations and um 

189.31 201.17 A: [lipsmack] merchandising for big lot stores and cash and carry is a big supermarket down here [sigh] we do stuff for the deli department and i have to say that she did ninety nine point nine percent of the work getting this company going 

201.07 205.28 B: well that's that's a useful thing to have in a life partner [sigh] 

205.04 208.86 A: yeah so i guess managing a house helped uh 

208.90 213.55 A: to manage in the business world more or less you know she had [mn] plenty of life experience
