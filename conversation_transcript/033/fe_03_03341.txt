109.92 114.42 A: yeah so we're supposed to talk about life partners is the subject of the day uh 

114.08 118.39 B: well that sounds good you're you are involved with a life partner at the current time [mn] 

118.05 119.63 A: (( oh yeah oh yeah )) 

118.76 121.90 B: oh that's good well what did you look for in her or him [mn] 

122.07 123.92 A: um 

124.38 125.70 A: intelligence 

125.49 127.00 B: intelligence huh 

126.96 129.34 A: to me that's always a good start 

128.82 129.71 B: yeah 

130.12 133.30 B: i- intelligence is pretty funny though i think it's just a 

133.56 136.45 B: i don't think it'd be the first one that i would look for you know 

136.50 137.91 A: (( mm yeah )) 

137.53 143.11 B: like i think intelligence is one of those things that's sort of intermingled with so many other things that maybe it's hard to do without 

141.88 150.57 A: oh oh yeah but ther- there're a lot of things that you you look for but to me intelligence comes first i want somebody that i can talk with somewhere along the line and you know 

148.22 149.14 B: (( mhm )) 

151.53 159.92 A: after the uh interesting things happen there's always the you gotta talk you know and if you're they can't talk what's the point 

159.45 169.24 B: yeah i kinda look at somebody that's uh i think it's just more of easy to talk to and easy to hang out with rather than someone that's just just as smart as me you know or they're smarter 

165.13 167.25 A: well that that that's also good 

167.95 180.61 A: i wasn't i wasn't i wasn't saying just just that th- the ease the ease of conversation it's all those things but i mean there's got to be a brain there i mean you know i i've known of a few dumb blonds in my life 

173.45 174.80 B: oh okay 

180.22 183.10 B: [laughter] i think everybody has [mn] [sigh] 

182.58 184.36 A: (( and um )) 

185.47 188.30 A: uh one of them was so dumb if i told her to uh 

188.76 193.30 A: to go get a newspaper she would probably come back with it in her teeth but you know 

192.52 193.20 B: mm 

194.46 196.59 B: [laughter] that's just classic 

195.21 196.43 A: (( so it goes )) 

196.77 198.96 B: yeah i- i think definitely i uh 

199.12 202.70 B: i look for somebody i can just hang out with and spend time with 

201.70 202.49 A: sure 

203.71 207.50 B: how long have you been with uh the person that you're seeing or whatever [mn] [sigh] 

207.20 208.21 A: (( about two years [noise] )) 

208.50 209.38 B: okay 

209.99 214.58 B: yeah i i've dated a girl for about five years now it's kind of been the same one but 

210.24 211.40 A: (( about two years )) 

213.83 215.37 A: oh that's good 

214.80 217.39 B: yeah it's been fun so far it's been fun 

216.86 218.15 A: i'm driving around 

218.37 220.52 A: the so it makes it interesting 

220.27 221.58 B: oh i'm sure 

222.05 231.37 A: yeah so don't mind me if i pause every so often i'm actually on a roadway that used to stop and now i'm sitting here going it keeps going this is nice and different [noise] 

224.38 225.48 B: (( oh okay )) 

229.93 230.87 B: [laughter] 

231.94 237.57 B: there you go it's always great that you can earn ten dollars while you're just um driving around talking about life partners 

237.81 246.26 A: why not and and m- mostly what they're looking for anyway is gl- is a computer will then pass out the the speech patterns to 

238.41 239.60 B: it's good to see it 

246.23 257.60 A: have a vocal recognition software to see if it recognizes what you're talking about so if you that that's what they're doing they're they're making a big trying to make a big step forward for vocal recognition 

250.11 252.33 B: oh is that what they're doing 

258.23 260.89 B: that's interesting that's interesting 

258.55 259.63 A: and 

260.56 262.47 A: i think it'll get there i 

262.52 273.06 B: i've used some of those voice recognition software packages before i used one about two or three years ago and i noticed that once you kind of sp- sat and spent the you know the fifty or sixty hours to train it it worked okay just not great 

262.80 264.08 A: (( hope it gets )) 

272.43 273.78 A: (( there sure )) 

273.54 283.46 A: um i'm passing these houses that this is a flood plain area and these houses are built up about twenty feet up in the air with concrete underneath them 

277.25 278.24 B: mhm 

283.31 294.78 A: but there's nothing connecting them yet and i i've no idea how you get in to the house i don't think they've opened them up yet you know and why you would wanna necessarily live where you gotta worry about that i mean i'd move uh- 

294.99 297.15 A: twenty you know 

297.29 300.25 A: twenty minutes probably away where there's solid land you know 

299.96 303.37 B: you got your uh you got your house on top of a puddle sort of there [mn] 

303.03 307.52 A: yeah well you know i guess there might be a view when you're raised up that far 

306.94 308.45 B: that's true i guess 

308.46 309.82 A: (( but er )) 

309.96 317.14 A: yeah well this roadway was caused because it had flood damage that's why it was you know just checking it out i'm up in the area anyway and i 

317.18 321.26 A: well you know what am i going to do to kill some time here and then the phone rings 

321.15 322.62 B: oh there you go [mn] 

322.75 324.98 A: so might as well with that uh 

325.25 330.14 A: uh we're about seven minutes i'm on seven minutes into the call so that's not too 

330.05 334.26 B: it's passed pretty quickly so what else do you look in a life partner besides intelligence [mn] 

334.16 336.06 A: (( uh um )) 

337.52 338.87 A: a hard worker 

339.31 340.98 B: there you go that's a good quality 

340.22 342.08 A: somebody who's actually going to work 

342.13 346.93 A: hard and you know contribute both ways both of you have to contribute but you know 

347.02 350.95 A: there's nothing worse than somebody who makes no effort with anything 

350.78 356.07 B: yeah i i think that uh one of the things that i'm definitely not interested in doing is uh 

356.18 362.97 B: going out with someone that that i have to sort of do everything for have to think for and have to pay for and all that sort of stuff [mn] 

362.29 364.44 A: well it it isn't that you don't 

364.63 371.70 A: don't want to do things for them it's just you want to do things when you want to do them you know not twenty four seven 

369.14 370.78 B: yeah yeah 

371.56 372.77 B: yeah 

372.22 374.92 A: yeah neediness is a negative 

374.75 378.36 B: yeah definitely i i think independence is one of the most important things to me 

377.99 379.39 A: uh-huh that's true 

379.01 381.70 B: i've i've dated girls before that uh 

381.79 395.97 B: uh you know they always w- had to be around you they had to talk to every single day for an hour or two you know i'm like that's i i enjoy talking to them especially if that's the reason i was going out with them but after a while you know it's nice to have be able to spend a day or two apart from somebody and have them not fall apart on you 

392.04 392.74 A: (( true )) 

395.58 397.61 A: [mn] you have to have your time alone 

397.21 398.70 B: exactly 

398.07 401.08 A: you know otherwise how are you going to figure out what you're doing 

400.84 403.35 B: yeah certainly 

401.45 402.61 A: sometimes 

403.39 403.97 A: (( um )) 

404.79 407.05 A: (( [noise] i think i'm gonna turn around )) 

408.04 410.34 B: have you guys been getting a lot of rain up there 

410.28 413.43 A: uh it's actually just starting to sprinkle a little bit right now 

413.19 414.09 B: okay 

414.22 414.78 A: (( [mn] )) 

415.13 416.88 A: haven't had too much rain

421.36 427.06 B: yeah it's starting actually to finally get hot here in philadelphia it's been uh unseasonably cold today's a 

425.40 432.80 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah i know what it's like my my mother lives in altoona and my sister lives in [noise] [noise] 

431.59 432.45 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

435.86 439.09 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

437.24 441.38 B: yeah i think it's about eighty two degrees here and i'm loving every minute of it 

441.23 442.82 A: oh eighty two can be nice 

443.13 447.38 B: uh it'd be i don't want to get too much hotter but as long as it stays around this i'll be happy 

447.23 449.24 A: yeah that's not too bad 

448.91 456.49 B: i'm fixing to uh to move so i'm trying to pack up all my stuff now and i keep thinking if i pack up all my warm stuff it'll go ahead and turn cold again but [mn] 

456.43 458.87 A: are you just moving across town or 

458.53 461.34 B: uh no i'm actually moving to new york 

460.97 461.74 A: oh 

461.82 462.63 B: so 

462.82 464.65 A: graduation and all that 

464.08 466.65 B: yeah i'm fixed to graduate and start work up there so 

466.60 469.08 A: mm what are you uh what was your major 

469.00 471.27 B: um business and history 

472.03 472.81 B: so 

472.60 474.61 A: (( in mm nice interesting combination wh )) 

474.36 476.24 B: yeah you know i had to make some money 

474.91 479.56 A: yeah and if you remember if you remember to learn from history you can make money 

479.62 480.75 B: there you go 

479.92 482.07 A: too many people never learn from history 

482.56 493.24 B: yeah i think for i just wanted to uh like i knew i had to eventually pay for my college so i want to go ahead and do business 'cause i figure that's what i do for a career but i figured i'd pick up history as something that uh kept me interested 

489.18 489.76 A: (( yeah )) 

492.98 497.30 A: well i have a lot of history background and i use it in business so 

496.68 497.24 B: (( [sigh] )) 

497.48 498.36 B: okay 

498.28 499.45 A: it's uh 

499.59 510.52 A: as i say too many people don't learn from history and they make mistakes because of it and that's why quite often in business if nothing else a research into the business's history will help you 

504.06 504.62 B: (( [sigh] )) 

510.69 511.82 A: along the way 

512.67 522.14 B: [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [mn] plus i think a lot of uh especially the sort of my classmates i think they've been sort of fo- focussed on their business degrees they really haven't developed any writing skills which i think you get in the uh 

522.24 523.23 A: sure 

522.24 523.52 B: liberal arts 

523.59 527.34 B: education that necessarily don't get in a business education 

527.56 530.89 A: (( yeah i was going to say a good balance is important )) 

531.94 534.13 A: well now i'm waiting for the beep [mn] 

533.74 535.32 B: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

535.29 540.60 A: we're about well i'm ten minutes into the call so we'll see what happens from here you 

540.04 542.05 B: (( [mn] yeah it really isn't )) 

541.08 552.46 A: know actually when you come around the corner this way i turned around the houses are at the right level with the roadway the only problem is it's basically built on a dyke so you look down twenty feet 

553.38 560.50 A: me i'd start getting fill and at least i i like to have my house where i can walk out the the door and actually hit the ground you know 

560.07 563.01 B: [laughter] that is a good quality to have in a house [mn] [noise] 

562.48 569.68 A: yes it's one of those things that they they've basically taken these two houses they probably moved 'em from some place else or built [noise] 

569.77 574.35 A: yeah one of them does look brand new i'll give it that and it's got stairs built inside the concrete but 

574.42 575.44 A: (( you know )) 

575.60 586.30 A: i- if you're worried about the flood plains so bad uh i think i'd wanna build something up so i don't so when it floods i can get to my house without having to go underwater to walk inside 

585.70 586.55 B: (( yeah you )) 

586.92 591.04 B: can always have a little boat docked there at the uh front door of your 

587.42 588.55 A: (( yeah yeah just in ))
