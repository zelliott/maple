174.69 177.28 A: um somebody that you can 

177.59 181.69 A: [lipsmack] you have no qualms about opening up to them one hundred percent 

180.95 182.37 B: mhm 

181.74 185.43 A: and not having to worry about being judged 

184.81 188.45 B: being judged yeah i knew you were gonna say that yeah that's 

185.90 188.93 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

188.88 190.02 B: mhm 

189.47 196.09 A: and well in in just having a fifty fifty relationship i mean and not necessarily meaning 

193.89 194.94 B: right 

196.52 197.40 A: you know 

197.63 201.82 A: i've i've seen [laughter] some people who have taken it to the extreme where 

201.44 202.47 B: uh-huh 

202.11 205.84 A: um you know half the bills are theirs and half 

205.18 206.92 B: right yeah 

205.99 208.98 A: are and i don't necessarily mean that i just mean 

208.25 209.20 B: no 

209.15 210.22 A: you know 

210.59 215.03 A: each person remains an individual but yet they're better together 

213.37 214.45 B: yes 

214.90 218.81 B: that's right yeah and they're and they're it's like um 

218.90 224.60 B: it's like a bonus to be with that with the other person like they bring the best out 

222.37 223.41 A: right 

224.44 225.59 A: right 

224.84 228.75 B: in you yeah another thing i would would add to that would be the 

229.05 234.95 B: the fact that i think um people need to be interdependent i think that's the right word 

235.49 240.84 B: to remain or or to be inter- i think that's the word interdependent 

241.17 244.12 A: rather than being codependent [laughter] 

241.37 242.17 B: like 

242.83 247.30 B: yeah not being codependent and not being totally independent either 

244.43 245.58 A: right 

247.02 248.17 A: right 

247.58 250.15 B: you know like if the person wanted to go out and 

250.56 255.14 B: do their thing and stay out half the night or whatever they do you know um 

255.40 257.30 B: that wouldn't be very good no 

256.98 258.56 A: no we 

258.90 261.39 A: i guess we both maintained 

261.98 264.05 A: some separate interests 

263.84 267.50 B: and that's important yeah yeah 

265.54 266.90 A: (( and )) 

267.10 271.36 A: i mean we are one of those [laughter] we're kinda a dorky couple where we 

271.49 272.74 A: we really 

273.18 277.31 A: i don't know we flourish the more time we spend with other another 

276.69 279.26 B: that's wonderful yeah 

278.04 281.46 A: and so i'm very very fortunate 

280.83 284.37 B: oh yeah that is wonderful that's actually 

284.38 288.22 B: ideal i think that would be like my ideal yeah 

285.94 286.90 A: (( it is )) 

287.43 292.26 A: [laughter] i know my parents who just basically hate one another they just 

292.06 292.96 B: uh-huh 

292.40 296.16 A: they think it's just sick [laughter] they 

294.07 299.30 B: oh wow they probably don't understand it at all no but it's healthy 

296.48 297.92 A: (( no )) 

297.94 299.70 A: they cannot 

299.42 302.38 B: what you're doing is healthy that's the way it should be 

302.03 305.81 A: right and i'm yeah understood it's nice being 

302.67 303.63 B: yeah 

305.89 308.51 A: um content but yet i 

308.51 309.57 B: mhm 

308.80 312.02 A: know it's we really have we've just found 

311.64 312.77 B: mhm 

312.13 315.64 A: kinda like this perfect balance and and i hope it stays that way too 

314.73 316.59 B: oh i hope so too 

316.10 319.16 A: we're both really working toward 

318.69 319.96 B: mhm 

319.34 321.12 A: keeping it here i guess 

320.67 331.25 B: yeah that's wonderful i would say you got the what i would that would be my ultimate [laughter] that to answer that question that they gave us that would be 

321.74 322.79 A: so 

331.49 332.22 B: that's 

331.52 337.48 A: yeah i'm i'm lucky i am very very lucky i mean i mean not to say that we don't have our you know petty little 

333.23 334.20 B: mhm 

337.19 338.13 B: oh 

337.33 350.52 A: stupid fights but i'm i'm the man of the house um [laughter] when it comes to if something breaks or or whatever and sometimes i'd like it if he would he's al- he's been so used to me just kinda taking over 

338.88 339.87 B: yeah 

341.53 342.54 B: uh-huh 

342.63 343.65 B: mhm 

344.37 345.41 B: right 

350.16 351.15 B: uh-huh 

350.87 352.65 A: and and fixing 

352.88 354.22 A: things but 

353.48 355.38 B: right [laughter] 

354.34 359.00 A: sometimes i'd like him to just you know [laughter] step in and do it but 

356.53 357.62 B: mhm 

358.90 359.84 B: uh-huh 

359.42 363.24 A: i mean gosh [cough] excuse me um i guess on the 

363.73 369.21 A: on the grand scheme of things that's a really small thing to be concerned with 

368.53 380.37 B: that would be real small yeah yeah because if you know and and ideally it's best that people be friends um i mean you're you know and that means friends in the 

370.10 371.94 A: [laughter] 

375.91 377.12 A: (( mhm )) 

380.52 383.13 B: i guess in the ultimate sense of the word 

383.21 385.31 B: that they be friends um 

386.48 392.88 B: you know like being there for each other and being supportive and not like you say not judging um 

389.26 390.46 A: right 

393.17 394.88 B: yeah to me that would be 

394.98 398.01 B: that's that's probably one of the most important things 

397.96 399.45 A: well i know when i 

399.66 409.11 A: first started looking um i was involved in an you know i was a re- a relationship for like four almost five years with somebody who 

407.29 408.28 B: mhm 

409.47 419.59 A: was just exactly like my dad and then [laughter] and it was it was so wrong and then after that it was like i i really learned a very valuable lesson 

411.38 413.20 B: oh dear yeah 

415.76 416.81 B: right 

419.17 420.68 B: mhm 

420.00 421.19 A: i mean i 

421.67 424.09 A: it's kinda sad that i had to waste 

424.43 434.03 A: i don't know if i wasted those years but but i was unfortunate enough to meet my husband then and i knew exactly what i was looking for 

424.48 425.66 B: some time 

426.46 427.74 B: yeah 

429.96 430.99 B: right 

431.00 431.97 B: yeah 

433.85 434.89 B: mhm 

434.26 435.83 A: and i found it 

435.21 445.18 B: yeah and that's healthy you know i think that's probably another dimension too is that you look the person we look for somebody as equally as healthy mentally healthy i think 

443.47 444.63 A: mhm 

444.92 445.93 A: yeah 

445.20 447.41 B: as you are yourself you know 

447.58 456.13 B: i think that's important too i hadn't thought about that but that it sounds like you've found somebody that's balanced with you and that's um 

449.48 450.73 A: (( oh yeah )) 

456.12 460.47 A: you know we're opposites but yet we're exactly the same i i don't know how to explain it 

459.87 461.34 B: mhm 

460.69 463.64 A: it is [laughter] 

462.88 469.96 B: well that's that's okay though 'cause you you know they say that opposites attract you know [laughter] 

467.42 474.93 A: yeah they do and and in our in- i mean in our case it was very true i'm very type a. very kind of 

471.36 472.34 B: uh-huh 

474.99 482.74 A: analytical you know kinda straight and narrow and he's very type b. personality i mean he's very easy going 

480.57 481.49 B: yeah 

482.45 487.46 B: yeah and sometimes that i think uh somebody that's calmer 

483.16 484.36 A: (( so i think )) 

487.49 494.15 B: 'cause i'm i'm a real go go go person too and i think somebody calmer kinda balances it out 

493.55 497.35 A: he kinda keeps things in perspective for me 

496.54 498.43 B: mhm 

497.43 503.45 A: i tend to take things very seriously and sometimes too seriously and sometimes he's just like okay you know what 

499.46 500.83 B: right 

501.42 502.86 B: mhm 

503.21 504.33 B: mhm 

503.68 515.29 A: stop let's take a step back and look at what you're saying look at what you're doing and then sometimes it's like man i'm dumb [laughter] 

506.83 508.02 B: look at it 

508.46 509.31 B: uh-huh 

512.09 513.80 B: [laughter] 

514.68 517.81 B: kinda forces you to take at yourself and 

517.54 518.90 A: mhm 

517.88 521.73 B: and that's okay and and you're okay about doing that you know 

520.93 526.54 A: well yeah and that's just like kinda another aspect is somebody who challenges you to just become a better person 

525.82 530.50 B: better person hey yeah that's right that's right 

528.23 529.90 A: yeah and that's 

530.51 534.09 A: i don't know that's i like this topic [laughter] 

532.82 538.58 B: yeah i do too yeah i could this is a good one for me too you know 'cause it's real important me to too i 

538.66 542.30 B: yeah i think it's a good topic have you done this very much i've only this is 

541.37 543.89 A: i've just done this is my uh second one 

543.75 548.37 B: me too because i missed two or three calls because i was gone 

548.61 556.54 B: and but i'm gonna be gone for the next few days 'cause i'm sick so but um [lipsmack] yeah i missed some so it's only my second one too 

556.35 560.43 A: oh my first one was on professional sports [laughter] 

558.93 560.98 B: oh that's interesting 

560.92 565.83 A: but it i don't watch too many professional sports though 

563.68 568.27 B: no no i don't either oh that would be kinda 

566.70 567.81 A: so 

569.14 573.11 B: a t- tough topic i think but this is a good one i think 

572.30 574.19 A: mhm i agree 

573.87 574.77 B: yeah 

574.33 578.52 A: i have i you know i walked into my relationship with kind of 

578.58 581.79 A: a list of things that i wanted and then 

581.92 582.94 B: yeah 

582.11 584.32 A: found the things that you know 

585.05 587.41 A: picked up other things along the way and then 

587.02 588.07 B: right 

587.43 590.45 A: brought some other ideas along you know 

589.26 590.33 B: uh-huh 

590.38 599.16 B: it sounds like you got a uh mix and and that's worked out really well i think that's wonderful i think you're lucky because it doesn't happen it doesn't seem like it happens 

598.78 599.89 A: it doesn't 

599.54 599.95 B: (( very ))
