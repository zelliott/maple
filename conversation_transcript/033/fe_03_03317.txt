11.39 13.08 A: i'm in fort lauderdale 

12.95 15.18 B: oh wow that's cool 

15.24 17.91 A: no very hot [laughter] 

15.25 16.15 B: uh 

16.58 25.50 B: [laughter] i guess that's true isn't it yeah i'm um dr- i i just give you a warning i'm driving and um 

24.55 27.37 A: yeah i know the feeling i'm [laughter] 

26.53 30.54 B: [laughter] so i might suddenly um 

30.93 35.71 B: make a funny noise or something but i'll still be here i think i've got clear um 

35.81 39.69 B: clear channel all the way until for ten minutes anyway so 

39.27 40.29 A: okay 

40.27 43.84 B: so so what do you think about life partners is the question 

44.35 46.68 A: well um 

46.81 51.57 A: i was married before i'm married now i've been married for eighteen years 

50.63 51.47 B: uh-huh 

51.97 57.97 A: um what were we supposed to it was supposed to be what we think most is important 

57.51 70.80 B: i think that's it i don't have my list with me i had it by the phone at home um it was ah i think it was ju- what are the issues or the the the considerations that are most important in choosing life partners 

71.12 72.06 B: (( um )) 

72.19 76.66 B: and then we have to hear what each of us each think and um 

77.01 81.22 B: exchange views on that uh there might be more detail but 

81.11 85.31 A: [lipsmack] well let me think most important 

81.84 83.55 B: that's how i recall it 

85.42 86.74 A: um 

87.52 90.31 A: i would say same values 

91.71 93.55 A: definitely same values 

93.04 101.29 B: same values yeah um 'cause i certainly when i i was married a long time ago and have been single for 

101.29 110.96 B: more years than i was married at this point and um i guess same values certainly is a piece of it but there's something i to me also a 

110.95 121.32 B: um sense of humor and um capacity for problem solving in a way that feels compatible 

121.60 126.37 B: (( um you know some of the interactive stuff is also very important )) 

126.67 128.31 A: no jealousy 

129.00 134.53 B: no jealousy that's that's a good one i would agree w- i would agree with that 

131.67 132.58 A: yeah 

133.99 137.11 A: yeah because i know like in our case 

137.34 139.71 A: like whatever i wanna do 

139.63 140.59 B: (( uh-huh )) 

139.95 141.84 A: you know like if 

141.88 146.46 A: if you came to town and said oh i know someone there and looked me up and 

146.53 153.30 A: i would just say oh i you know a friend of mine from new mexico's coming over and we're going out to dinner there's no problem you know 

152.73 159.83 B: right yeah yes well i certainly have had friends that have had that as a major issue that um 

159.85 162.26 B: you know that she wasn't able to 

162.43 164.43 B: go do stuff without him 

163.53 168.80 A: well you see that's like with my ex husband i wasn't even allowed to go to the mailbox 'cause i might talk to the mailman 

168.68 172.62 B: um oh okay [laughter] 

169.92 175.20 A: you know [laughter] hence the term ex husband [laughter] 

173.78 178.95 B: ex husband yes yes well that's good we- you you didn't stay there too long it sounds like 

178.06 180.50 A: no no no no 

180.47 192.53 B: there [laughter] yeah 'cause i'd i'd i agree that that is 'cause i that was an issue among others um in my in the marriage that i had but it was it was it was a derivative of 

192.66 198.87 B: of other issues so that you know it's like i don't even think of that as being you know the major thing but 

199.04 201.62 A: it really is i see for a lot of people 

201.72 208.84 A: where they have to be together all the you know what do you mean you're leaving me here by myself or you know no no no that's ridiculous 

205.90 206.66 B: yeah 

208.71 215.11 B: well i guess that's the thing that's interesting to me 'cause here where i live in new mexico there there are 

215.00 225.09 B: um lots of folks but um at least in the set of people that i've started meeting and getting to know it is um people are 

225.10 226.26 B: (( um )) 

226.38 239.23 B: very independent and the couples are independent of each other as well as encouraging you know the growth and creativity and independence of their partners 

238.99 242.90 A: [noise] [noise] oh that's good that's good because that's not the case here 

239.27 240.58 B: so that it 

240.66 241.89 B: it really it 

242.82 244.55 B: i isn't it yeah 

243.89 248.80 A: no [noise] well i think a lot of it is because well especially where i live 

248.82 252.29 A: i mean it's getting really bad no one speaks english any more 

248.83 249.75 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

252.30 253.23 B: uh-huh 

252.89 256.10 A: you know it's all latin and the latin culture 

256.39 265.88 A: is you know the man makes all the rules the woman listens to whatever the man says [noise] and for that reason you're surrounded with that 

265.94 270.86 A: constantly with people that you work with and you know it's like 

266.08 266.94 B: uh-huh oh 

268.39 269.20 B: yes 

269.45 270.40 B: yeah 

271.56 276.66 A: i don't know i have to ask my husband if i can you know oh please you know it's 

274.36 275.64 B: yeah yeah 

276.31 279.94 B: well and that's twenty years ago [laughter] it was 

279.02 281.03 A: you know that's very bad 

279.95 287.81 B: twenty years thirty years ago yeah yes it is it certainly is well that's the way my mother was though i mean if i think about it 

286.00 291.52 A: ah my mother was too yeah my mother was too but she wanted to be 

291.72 293.72 A: (( because that's how it was then )) 

292.46 293.23 B: uh-huh 

293.72 295.24 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

294.53 297.16 A: i mean that was just how it was then 

297.18 306.73 B: well but see i think there were some people who while they wanted to be more independent they felt it was kind of a cu- a a social custom 

297.55 298.49 A: you know 

306.75 314.78 B: and it it while they they maybe didn't um fully agree with it it still was the way things were 

314.90 322.38 B: ah and maybe the way their relationship was because of the way they they way they started i don't know but um 

322.90 333.81 B: ah yeah 'cause i think of people who certainly didn't say well i can't do that 'cause my husband won't let me you know it that used to be a thing that was very common 

333.75 335.06 A: right right 

334.65 337.70 B: and uh and i don't you don't hear that as much 

335.88 340.35 A: i still have like older friends now that'll call me 

340.19 341.09 B: (( uh-huh )) 

340.90 342.65 A: and they'll say 

342.71 352.15 A: oh is your husband home and i'm like yeah oh well i'll let you go then and i'm like no that's okay you know [laughter] that's fine 

348.03 348.68 B: yeah 

348.76 359.71 B: [laughter] yes i understand yes i've heard that well i remember oh there's a friend of mine who lives in michigan when i came where i was before i lived moved here 

359.52 368.50 B: and she at various points when she was extraordinarily busy with projects that involved lots of phone calls and people calling her 

368.29 377.81 B: she so envied one of her partners in that work because tha- that the other woman had a husband who would fend off calls 

377.64 387.78 B: and would you know t- take calls or say uh melinda's busy today she can't you know at this time let me take a message whereas my friend didn't have anybody and she 

387.56 395.86 B: she felt very deprived [laughter] because there wasn't somebody there to to fend off others which um 

390.38 392.18 A: y- oh okay 

394.99 400.42 A: yeah right yeah that's like [mn] well if you can always use there's someone at the door 

396.38 397.40 B: (( yes yeah )) 

400.06 401.64 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] yeah right )) 

400.78 403.67 A: you know [laughter] 

401.88 409.38 B: exactly exactly exactly or like of course that was before we had uh call waiting so that she could check on who it was 

409.41 410.20 B: so 

409.52 411.14 A: yeah right yeah 

411.43 412.82 A: that's true i 

411.44 412.59 B: well let's see where 

412.97 415.38 A: i don't know what we did without that you 

415.41 419.15 B: i know isn't it amazing yeah yeah so 

418.76 423.52 A: know it's like oh no not now i can't talk to her now no way [laughter] 

419.18 420.04 B: yeah 

422.12 434.39 B: i [laughter] yeah there are other times that it's like yup it's uh well let's see now how does we bring this back to life partners let's see i've i'm trying to think how do we circle this 

431.05 432.09 A: um 

434.58 440.53 B: i don't know that it makes that much difference they just wanna hear our how our conversation wanders along [laughter] 

434.58 435.51 A: well 

437.17 438.20 A: i don't 

439.93 446.55 A: well i guess it's just let me think what else do i like oh i like we we agree about how the kids should be raised 

446.53 460.78 B: okay yeah i that would seem to me to be i didn't have i didn't have i didn't have kids but i certainly think it did it agree that you can before you marry i think that's the other problem is well well people make choices and they think 

449.18 450.63 A: that's a biggie 

452.86 454.13 A: yeah that's a r- 

460.72 465.17 B: when they think they've made sound choices and then discover 

465.24 468.43 B: um major areas of disagreement 

468.27 479.46 A: well you know it's funny a a lot of the little things i know i wrote my um kids a list one day and i said keep this until you get married 

475.55 477.02 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

479.62 482.20 A: before you get married these are 

482.26 485.66 A: silly things one of the biggest things 

483.80 484.70 B: uh-huh 

485.76 486.90 A: that 

487.07 494.43 A: i've seen people like argue about that can turn into like really bad is um 

494.53 498.83 A: like i happen to like a christmas tree with a lot of stuff on it 

498.79 499.64 B: uh-huh 

499.62 502.69 A: you know i mean packed with all kinds of ornaments 

502.50 503.38 B: (( uh-huh [laughter] )) 

502.77 503.77 A: and 

503.83 508.24 A: like my friend's the same way well her husband only likes blue ornaments 

507.96 508.85 B: uh-huh 

508.62 515.72 A: and very few and like and they got into like this major battle and didn't speak to each other for two weeks and 

509.06 510.08 B: (( uh-huh [laughter] )) 

514.85 516.06 B: (( oh my gosh )) 

516.20 519.07 A: at christmas no less you know 

518.07 519.00 B: uh-huh 

519.12 519.85 B: (( uh-huh )) 

519.17 521.50 A: and it's things like that that 

521.61 525.74 A: stupid things you need to settle on before 

525.66 538.97 A: even like you know well of course you assume i'm always going to spend christmas at my parents' house and he's thinking well we're always going to do it at my parents' house and those can actually in the end break up a marriage 

534.74 536.14 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

539.03 547.46 B: yeah i guess that's true well i guess you know that i i think of that one as the the kind of m- a m- more a root thing is 

539.15 540.75 A: (( [cough] [cough] )) 

541.08 542.32 A: (( [cough] )) 

547.63 551.00 B: do we have we figured out how 

550.87 562.03 B: to disagree and how we will work those out because i don't think having disagreements and having arguments is necessarily a bad thing it's do you fight fa- 

560.35 562.56 A: [cough] no as long as you 

561.82 567.08 B: do you fight fair and do you i- is it something that you grow from 

567.21 570.53 B: not something that you are using to hurt the other person 

570.47 579.24 A: that's exactly because it can get to a point where you bring up what happened five years ago with uh yeah and that's when it gets 

576.15 577.46 B: (( exactly you know )) 

577.94 592.02 B: and that's not fair yeah and that's not fair because i guess i y- i if somebody was so wedded though to blue li- light bulbs on their tree i guess and and i either wasn't wedded to them or i didn't like 'em 

579.35 580.20 A: no 

591.97 595.47 B: that certainly would would bug me i mean i that would 

594.46 599.01 A: it's e- it's amazing it turns into a major ordeal 

598.76 599.95 B: yeah well it 

599.50 599.89 A: (( you know ))
