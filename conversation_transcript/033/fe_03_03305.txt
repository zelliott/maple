27.23 29.51 A: [noise] yes that's right [noise] 

29.34 31.03 B: i think that's number one 

31.05 33.10 A: mhm

34.24 35.98 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

34.93 38.70 B: and i was a l- it was you know maybe other things too i think uh 

39.88 43.40 B: values is important uh to clarify what 

44.46 49.01 B: what the uh you know person's values are what's important to them 

48.76 50.78 A: mhm that's right

59.40 62.34 B: you know honesty commitment um 

64.11 66.02 B: uh compassion 

65.77 66.72 A: (( [noise] )) 

66.16 67.25 B: uh 

67.54 74.57 B: i uh i uh i i think a heart leads the way to too i have to believe that i think the heart's very important 

74.14 76.15 A: mhm 

74.70 76.80 B: and it uh 

77.38 82.11 B: spirit there has to be some kind of soul and spirit connection 

82.40 84.86 B: and balance i think um 

85.71 91.90 B: mi- mind body experience you have to to finally get a partner you have to relate to them in all all three ways 

92.39 98.04 B: there has to be some balance 'cause if if there's something if you're short in one area then it's difficult 

92.44 93.33 A: that's 

98.29 101.18 B: or that needs to be worked on anyway that's my 

101.26 103.95 B: what i have to say do you do you what what do you say 

103.62 107.52 A: (( true uh uh about the same thing i i agree )) 

107.59 109.29 B: yeah 

108.44 110.49 A: the most important thing 

110.57 111.83 A: (( is getting your [noise] )) 

114.06 118.10 A: your uh heart and life to god and you know 

117.04 117.79 B: (( yeah )) 

119.12 121.62 B: yeah we're all on a 

121.84 123.50 B: we're all god's children 

123.42 124.93 A: that's right 

124.72 126.42 B: first i think 

126.20 127.45 A: mhm 

127.08 130.14 B: and other people are just they come to help us 

130.66 135.35 B: be a mirror to understand that better i think you know on a path on our path you know 

135.45 138.45 B: all of us has our own path and our own lessons to learn 

138.40 140.71 A: mhm 

139.22 141.52 B: i think and then we try to learnt 

142.14 145.83 B: what each other's lessons are and that makes for a better partner 

145.77 148.37 A: (( we has to go to her bath )) 

149.90 154.69 B: yes we're supposed to talk for ten minutes i don't know if they tell us when our time's up or not have you ever done one of these 

151.77 153.50 A: mhm 

154.58 157.47 A: um this is my second call 

157.00 159.27 B: oh do they tell you when your time's up 

158.76 159.87 A: mhm 

159.42 160.35 B: okay 

161.53 169.48 B: and it's i think it's a maximum of three times isn't it unless you get on a different program where you call from different phones 

165.05 166.24 A: uh 

169.88 172.18 B: yeah i'll find that out later 

169.92 170.81 A: (( [mn] )) 

172.19 173.75 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

173.02 177.55 B: but i think that's right too we're we're we seem to be on the same wavelength here uh 

177.79 179.38 B: i think that uh 

180.27 183.87 B: it's important to find somebody you can grow with spiritually 

183.62 185.77 A: mhm 

184.86 186.37 B: that's the bottom line 

187.05 194.86 B: and then worldly matters are important too to be practical and sensible you know how you're going to work out the 

194.85 196.49 A: that's right 

195.82 200.58 B: uh who's making what kind of contribution there needs to be a sense of balance in the contribution 

200.52 202.10 A: mhm 

200.76 206.64 B: and you know on money's not the only way to measure contribution i think that other there's other ways of contributing 

207.31 209.12 B: i think sometimes uh 

209.43 216.96 B: it's okay if a man stays home and takes care of the house or the kids i mean there's no law against it not if that works better 

214.48 215.69 A: (( [noise] no )) 

216.91 217.97 A: no 

217.43 223.18 B: i saw a magazine cover the other day that women who uh work 

223.50 228.82 B: when they're who're with a a partner that doesn't work tend to uh 

229.35 230.76 B: make more money 

231.47 240.06 B: than i don't know than what i think maybe than the average woman working or something maybe that's of necessity i d- uh that was on a magazine cover i saw yesterday 

234.52 236.17 A: mhm 

240.01 240.93 A: oh 

241.04 245.70 B: but i think a sense of balance is good i think there should be more women in politics also 

246.01 249.16 B: just like they're getting in the army now and i think that uh 

249.62 253.98 B: in other words there's just different ways of measuring contribution and fairness 

253.99 255.59 A: [noise] yeah 

254.07 258.80 B: in terms of who contributes and as long as both partners are holding up their own end 

258.37 260.14 A: mhm that's right 

259.77 261.60 B: and they can agree on it 

261.19 262.51 A: mhm 

261.62 264.32 B: sometimes people do have trouble over money though 

264.10 267.31 A: that's right and they argue over money too 

266.69 267.66 B: yeah 

268.04 274.83 B: keeping t- track i think or tit for tat i think i don't think that's the most progressive way to do it i think it's better just to share 

274.68 276.05 A: mhm 

275.52 277.48 B: and not like 

278.00 279.81 B: be a bean counter you know 

279.70 281.01 A: that's right 

280.01 282.79 B: and on somebody's back all the time 

282.50 283.47 A: mhm 

283.16 287.22 B: uh but i i think it's a tough issue to work through for a lot of people 

286.96 288.14 A: yes 

288.03 291.41 B: and uh i don't have all the answers on that one 

291.12 292.09 A: mhm 

292.89 294.22 B: um 

294.72 298.99 B: this is someth- i'm just saying what comes in th- what's coming into my mind 

298.30 301.39 A: (( [noise] yeah you done go- very well no no no )) 

301.08 304.11 B: yeah am i talking too much you want to some more 

303.40 305.63 A: (( no no no no no )) 

305.51 312.49 B: anything that comes into your mind uh first and foremost to add to what i said that kind of fits along with that in 

312.55 314.01 A: well um 

313.47 315.51 B: terms of what to look for 

315.65 317.63 B: what what do you think matters 

315.89 316.65 A: (( uh )) 

317.51 321.33 A: (( i i i agree about all that um )) 

322.27 328.20 A: i don't it's hard for me to understand what they're meaning when they say something like that but 

328.57 331.72 A: well usually when i talk to somebody they'll tell me 

331.78 334.69 A: what it is and what it's about and all so 

335.52 336.52 A: so that 

337.18 338.76 A: that's good too 

339.73 345.10 B: yeah what what else can you think of that that you think would make partners work better 

345.28 346.31 A: [noise] well 

345.32 347.43 B: make it easier for people 

347.37 361.41 A: well it'd be easier if i mean i know a lot of people don't go to church but but i think a lot of people should go to church and read the bible i mean i know me and my husband only goes uh 

361.46 362.65 A: one day 

363.04 367.29 A: like the sunday morning that's it and the rest of the time he has to work 

365.26 366.06 B: mhm 

367.46 377.36 A: and he misses that going to church and and we try to read the bible when we can i mean i know we need to make a point to read the bible no matter what 

370.18 371.03 B: yeah 

373.44 374.18 B: (( right mhm )) 

377.98 384.89 A: i mean the computer and the uh t._v. it needs to go you need put god first 

384.97 386.61 B: yeah 

386.68 389.01 A: you probably think i gone wacko 

389.76 391.10 B: don't like what 

390.74 393.39 A: i said you probably think i gone wacko 

394.10 399.88 B: no i i said i think god needs to be first too remember when i said that 

394.98 396.38 A: mhm 

399.27 401.22 A: mhm that's right 

400.15 402.23 B: well why did you say that 

401.87 404.95 A: uh a lot of people probably think i gone wac- 

403.99 407.10 B: oh yeah yeah well right there's a perception 

407.44 409.90 B: that some people overdo it 

409.57 410.75 A: mhm 

410.41 412.41 B: that they're holy rollers you know 

412.06 417.35 A: [laughter] that's what i named my cockatoo i got a cockatoo and i named it holy roller 

412.46 413.87 B: that's an old old 

416.99 419.52 B: that's an old fashioned term i i 

418.73 419.81 A: mhm 

419.54 423.22 B: i i learned it in midwest growing up [laughter] 

423.27 427.50 B: well there are those people you know but er just 'cause somebody's 

427.70 431.44 B: also there's uh different ways of being spiritual 

431.39 433.10 A: (( yeah that's all right )) 

431.90 435.62 B: there's different ways and everyone has to figure out their own connection 

435.46 437.33 A: that's right 

436.04 444.25 B: uh it's personal and uh some uh people need a lot of rel- out- outside religious um 

444.40 445.64 B: trappings 

446.29 453.29 B: uh other people can do a lot of it inside through prayer and meditation there's different ways 

446.90 447.46 A: (( [noise] )) 

449.05 450.79 A: mhm 

454.40 459.88 B: to connect with god i think that uh reading scriptures is good too 

459.63 461.73 A: mhm that's right 

460.90 463.88 B: it's uh it take takes the pressure off 

463.98 465.38 A: that's right 

464.90 470.64 B: it's you know now you can read self help books too and all that and everything out there in the market that 

470.92 475.06 B: you know then you still got to kind of like figure it out yourself and you know 

474.78 476.58 A: mhm 

475.54 478.73 B: stuff like that i mean counseling can help people too but 

478.93 480.40 B: i think that uh 

480.88 482.81 B: well i wish i had better 

483.21 496.27 B: i i could stand too i'm glad we're having this conversation because it's it's it's making me want to read the bible and uh i mean not that i don't read it but maybe make a little more because it could take some pressure off me 

488.82 490.98 A: (( [laughter] that's great )) 

492.34 493.49 A: right 

495.97 497.47 A: right
