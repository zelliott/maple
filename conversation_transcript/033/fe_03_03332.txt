79.17 88.10 B: and i said you know if you want me to have a husband you're going to have to drop him on my lap and he did this i was on we were on a plane [noise] and he had to get to his seat 

88.32 94.77 B: [lipsmack] and the overhead compartment opened and he winds up sitting in my lap [laughter] so 

92.91 94.47 A: oh that's funny 

94.75 107.95 B: you know and and i and i really didn't know you know when we just started to talk i didn't know what kind of guy he was but he's really outstanding he's been great with my daughter and and t- i you know but i guess what what i really needed was somebody i could trust 

107.57 108.87 A: exactly 

108.61 112.10 B: trust because you know i had been hu- so hurt before and 

111.84 116.70 A: oh my goodness and i i walked in those shoes too definitely

116.09 125.74 B: yeah i had been so hurt and you know the betrayal was terrible you know the ev- the the way everything happened plus i had i have a beautiful daughter 

125.78 132.89 B: and i and i had it had to be somebody that i could trust with her and not some guy who's going to be pawing her when you know when i'm asleep [noise] 

126.17 128.26 A: i i had three 

131.65 136.38 A: right i had three when i when i found my hu- new husband 

137.50 140.54 B: wow you ha- what do you have two boys a girl 

140.52 144.93 A: actually now i have one girl and three boys we have one together 

144.62 155.48 B: wow that is awesome that sounds like a fairytale it sounds like my fairytale i had one girl and we ha- i have two together with him i have a g- a a little girl and a and a boy 

148.17 149.29 A: yeah 

155.49 157.98 A: he was actually my best friend 

159.05 160.29 B: you know uh that's that's 

160.26 165.64 B: you know what's funny bill and i started out that way because he was in the middle of his divorce and i and and i 

165.65 175.39 B: i am like him i'm the kind of person who encourages people a lot you know it's like i take a depressing situation and make it sound like the most wonderful thing [laughter] that ever happened to you 

173.75 175.49 A: yeah yeah 

175.54 187.89 B: so i was i he would call me and he says you know after you talk to me you know i feel so good you know because i he was really down and out about his divorce and and breaking up with this girl and this that and the other thing 

187.80 196.09 B: so yes i guess that he was my best friend and w- and and i didn't he's not what i would look for because normally i like my men tall dark and handsome 

196.47 200.36 B: [noise] [lipsmack] and he's tall and he's handsome but he's white i'm hispanic 

201.10 210.58 B: and and i mean the name wilson probably throws you off but it betty wilson but that's my married name but you know i like tall dark and handsome and i wasn't real big on interracial marriages 

210.60 219.62 B: but you know my friend my girlfriend was telling me she goes betty what are you talking about everything that's ever chased you down in college was white [laughter] 

218.44 222.05 A: yeah but you know what all our hearts are the same color 

222.06 222.98 A: (( you know )) 

223.31 236.29 B: yeah and and she said what do you mean she said what difference does it make and i said oh i- it's not that i said it's not that it's just that it's not it's not what i normally go for but it's it's like this is the happiest i've ever been with anybody 

236.79 244.26 B: 'cause he is like an incredible human being he's patient he's tolerant and trustworthy is not the word for him he is just 

244.06 258.97 B: i mean i'd trust him with my eyes closed i y- i would tru- he's i have really gorgeous friends i mean d- you know tall skinny women tall thin women not skinny and you know and they want it because he's a great i mean the man gives great advice 

259.30 267.79 B: and um and he my friends will go are you sure you and i said you can talk to him i trust him i said if i can't i would never get involved with somebody i can't trust 

267.82 269.54 B: it's too much work 

269.58 278.58 B: because like the minute they leave your house you're wondering oh who's he with or what's he doing or you know is he really at the office or is he at the booby trap or i mean you know 

278.23 284.20 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah and it ta- you know it takes a lot to get back from where we came from you know 

283.25 288.42 B: it does it does it takes a lot not to drive your new partner crazy 

284.32 287.17 A: it takes a lot to get yourself picked up 

288.05 289.61 A: yeah yep 

289.42 300.71 B: because once you've been hurt it's like oh maybe is he going to do this too but you know that was like you like you said the trustworthiness like we both agreed on that because it's if you can't trust that person 

300.61 309.74 B: your life becomes miserable and you're always wondering what he's doing who he's with blah blah blah and i said you know what no matter what this no matter what joe did 

310.16 321.13 B: i have to trust i have to get somebody who i trust because i it's too much bondage to to b- to be in- involved with somebody you don't trust and always wondering who you know 

319.69 322.10 A: oh and you you drive yourself nuts 

321.50 325.92 B: yeah what he's out there doing [noise] and you'll expend so much energy 

325.77 327.64 A: yeah that's no way to live 

326.28 333.32 B: wondering about this nonsense that you i mean your life will go by and then you're like wait a minute i didn't even i i didn't even stop and smell the roses 

331.26 332.14 A: yeah 

332.67 334.69 A: yeah i didn't even start to live yet 

334.72 336.62 A: all i did was worry you know 

336.44 337.52 B: yeah 

336.95 337.88 A: no 

337.77 341.09 B: but you know 'cause you once you've been burned and stuff like that 

337.90 342.88 A: but definitely trust and i i and being friends i bet you that's gotta help a lot too 

341.92 349.73 B: [noise] you know and he's a very he's so relia- he's and the funny thing is he's a lot younger than i am he's like nine years younger than me 

349.07 351.57 A: mine is seven years younger than me 

350.80 355.37 B: (( [laughter] boy we got a lot in common [laughter] )) 

353.04 360.70 A: yeah that's why i want to i mean he was my friend and that's all he was to me but one one day things changed 

358.42 362.71 B: yeah well bill was was married so we couldn't be anything more than friends 

363.07 365.38 A: i just never looked at him like that 

363.41 366.58 B: and you know i didn't have that kind of attraction for him 

367.61 374.93 B: [noise] it wasn't like i met him and said boy would i like to i mean he's is a good look- he's a very good looking man but he um 

375.04 381.56 B: [lipsmack] he's actually drop down- downright gorgeous but i yeah i didn't see him that way he was a like you said he was my best friend [noise] [lipsmack] 

380.70 384.59 A: yeah yeah so you're not even really looking at them that way 

384.64 392.59 B: right i well you know i guess that's what made it so special the fact that we weren't looking at him that way because when you start out with a dating relationship 

392.87 403.53 B: you know there's a lot of masquerades there's a lot of stuff there you know i went through something really embarrassing with him i mean i wanted to die of embarrassment it but it's funny 

395.16 396.09 A: mhm 

403.96 411.90 B: [lipsmack] and you know when we survived that you know when we got past that i said this this this man is in- he's an incredible human being 

411.57 417.57 A: well the thing is we didn't have up shields because with a best friend you just they know everything 

415.89 416.47 B: (( [noise] )) 

417.69 423.18 B: exactly because i mean i let my hair down with him i cried my eyes out to him i said you know what 

423.16 430.35 B: i went through w- with this and that and the other thing with joe and he was telling me yeah i we- it's funny because his wi- his ex wife's name was joanne 

430.19 431.40 A: oh gee 

430.31 438.45 B: and he used to call her jo and my ex was joseph and we called him joe so it was jo and joe and it was like which jo are you talking about [laughter] 

437.56 441.22 A: well now you could just say and it doesn't even matter who you're talking about [laughter] 

440.45 443.27 B: yes but we're just getting jo this and jo that 

441.59 443.03 A: it's just the past 

443.41 448.70 B: [noise] and it's th- this that and the other thing and it's like oh i mean 

449.07 452.81 B: it [noise] i sometimes i wonder what i ever saw in the other one after having him 

452.96 458.99 A: yeah maybe maybe you know y- we shouldn't have been looking for a certain thing you know mm 

457.75 463.66 B: [noise] yeah because you know we get the ho- hung up on this is this one oh he's my type [noise] 

463.86 471.20 B: the truth of the matter is i didn't know what my type was i mean they all i managed to pick was like these losers and i'm like what am i doing 

471.56 478.29 B: and finally when i had my child i said you know i'm not even gonna look i just i was so disgusted i married him when i was thirty five 

477.68 481.04 A: well i guess that's the answer to the question we shouldn't be looking for anything 

480.15 492.24 B: yeah don't look because when you're not looking that's when you when you act natural and you are yourself and you will attract someone who is who who i- who is going to like you just the way you are because that's all he knows 

485.09 486.10 A: yeah 

491.96 492.91 A: right 

492.63 496.07 B: you know that's all he knows because when we're dating we put on all these 

494.04 498.00 A: and that's like a fantastic foundation to start you know 

497.06 510.48 B: right so you know when we're dating we put on these airs and we get all dressed up and the jewelry and the makeup and the girdles and this i mean this man met me everything was hanging out and it was funny because when he met me i was pretty heavy 

507.22 507.99 A: yeah 

511.01 518.50 B: [lipsmack] and he married me anyway and he and it was the reverse 'cause usually men marry these young women and then they wind up getting fat afterwards 

518.44 526.37 B: with us it was the other way around i wind up losing weight [laughter] hand over fist after we were married he goes boy everybody should have it this good 

525.56 527.33 A: yeah i was going to say 

526.96 534.07 B: yeah and i look better now than when he married me he's he's like i don't believe it he goes you know i i it was for better or for worse and it's gotten better 

534.07 535.08 A: wow 

534.94 544.19 B: u- usually it gets worse and it's gotten better because i i used to i used to chemically relax my hair 'cause you know i'm i'm forty one years old 

543.69 545.17 A: ooh i'm forty 

544.90 550.67 B: [laughter] th- [laughter] that's funny so you know back in the sixties everybody had straight hair 

550.61 551.73 A: (( yeah )) 

551.15 561.45 B: and i didn't uh my hair is very curly and i used to straighten it chemically for years and um he hated it he goes i don't there's something i don't like your hair 

561.71 565.15 B: and i said well that's because it that's not that's because it's not mine 

565.43 567.01 A: (( yeah it's straight )) 

565.54 571.51 B: he goes what do you mean you have on a wig all this time i i said oh it's not a wig i just like i i straighten it chemically 

570.58 572.57 A: yeah it's just fake yeah 

571.96 574.31 B: yeah so he told me he said well let it grow 

574.47 588.44 B: so you know i cut it kind of short and i started to let my natural hair grow and now it's like um like a few inches below my sh- he loves it he's like it's beautiful you should have never straightened it and it's just he's made such a change in my he's even accepted parts of me that i didn't accept 

588.89 591.99 A: which now make you accept 'em you know what i mean 

590.92 592.10 B: (( [noise] )) 

592.92 598.40 B: i mean it's ridiculous as i said they i would there were things that i rejected about myself that he liked 

598.46 599.95 B: and i was like wow because
