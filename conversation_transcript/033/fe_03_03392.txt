27.92 29.87 B: okay you can you can start 

29.59 37.30 A: um actually it's a really good question since i don't have one [laughter] um but i guess i would say uh probably 

32.70 33.81 B: [laughter] 

37.48 44.89 A: um either basically probably like good communication skills whether it be you know i you know 

44.97 54.11 A: so many things come out through that like a good sense of humor being able to understand each other um and just being comfortable with you know being able to say and do 

54.06 60.92 A: whatever you want and be comfortable with the other person in doing that i guess i would say that was a a pretty important one 

57.73 58.88 B: yeah 

60.79 63.05 B: that is is a good one um [lipsmack] 

63.36 68.39 B: i was gonna probably go with honesty um 

67.50 68.33 A: mhm 

68.97 70.99 B: i guess only because 

71.07 85.38 B: i've been married before and if there's even if a person's a good communicator if it's not something that you believe [laughter] it's kinda tough to get past but just a person that's always [noise] honest whether it be brutally honest or or whatever it um 

77.80 79.57 A: right [laughter] 

85.48 95.04 B: it's i don't know it's a really it's a it's a real good foundation to start with a person that you always believe irregardless of you know the situation you're in good or bad um 

90.98 91.90 A: mhm 

93.97 94.80 A: mhm 

94.99 106.43 B: [mn] i don't know i i guess i always a sense of humor and and everything you know that was all the things that i guess i looked for when i was younger but um as i grow older it's somebody that i know 

103.83 104.73 A: mhm 

106.42 112.93 B: i guess with honesty i always think that honesty means that a person is always gonna be there to you know no matter what happens 

110.88 111.74 A: right 

112.97 116.30 B: but i i don't know i haven't found the key i guess either [laughter] 

115.37 126.63 A: right [laughter] no i mean it's it's a good point and especially the point that you made about you know that you have had an experience you know before uh a deep really longer relationship and 

126.45 130.61 A: i mean i guess that's a good point that you know i haven't actually um 

130.92 144.05 A: i'm fairly young and new to this sort of dating scene in in the real world in general so um yeah i mean i i think it i think it's a good poi- point that you know maybe at different points in your life 

143.73 144.86 B: (( mhm right )) 

144.32 149.33 A: the most important thing in a life partner it it does change i guess 

149.05 154.65 B: i have a i always tell my friends that that have a real um i don't know it i guess 

154.72 166.23 B: my outlook is in the in our twenties in my twenties all the guys were looking for one thing while we were all looking for the you know the the knight on the white horse and the guy that was everything and then 

157.72 158.51 A: mhm 

163.03 164.03 A: (( right [mn] )) 

166.35 172.48 B: the things that i found so important back then by the time i'm in my thirties um 

172.44 182.39 B: aren't so important anymore you know a a great job and a car kinda takes a back back seat it's really down to earth and and honest and trustworthy 

174.20 175.12 A: right 

180.58 181.58 A: mhm 

182.04 183.02 A: right 

182.34 188.85 B: but i don't know we all go i guess women and men we're all like off schedule you know [laughter] 

186.41 190.52 A: [laughter] i know no i totally i totally agree with you 

189.93 191.44 B: well how old are you 

191.09 192.54 A: i'm twenty three 

192.02 193.68 B: oh my gosh i'm thirty two 

193.27 194.18 A: okay 

193.77 196.99 B: um yeah and um it seems like [mn] 

197.18 205.76 B: i don't know it's a kinda cruel joke i guess on humanity that guys go through certain things at certain ages and i don't think we ever catch up we're way you know 

200.63 201.72 A: mhm 

202.88 203.88 A: oh yeah 

205.77 209.19 B: and sometimes it doesn't make sense to try and date somebody my own age 

208.76 222.39 A: mhm oh yeah i mean exactly exactly and i i think i'm always sort of attracted to guys that are at least you know three or four years older just because i feel like maybe it's it's just a little y- you know 

210.09 211.28 B: [laughter] 

216.74 217.68 B: yeah 

221.66 226.21 B: that's the boost that that yeah 'cause i think that we shot out of first grade 

225.62 228.36 A: (( [laughter] )) 

226.87 230.90 B: [laughter] at a at a faster rate and and just they've never caught up 

230.21 233.02 A: yeah yeah right yeah exactly i totally agree 

232.60 233.85 B: oh my gosh 

233.22 241.17 A: well it's just so funny because uh you know i'm sort of in a situation right now and um my boss is a little bit older than me about twenty eight 

241.00 251.47 A: and um she just sort of laughs because she's in a in a deep relationship with her boyfriend and i just sorta started dating this guy who works in our office building 

251.24 252.05 B: uh-huh 

251.65 259.55 A: and you know i'm your typical girl whose really obsessive all day long [laughter] you know why hasn't he called me why hasn't he emailed me 

256.24 257.17 B: right 

259.34 270.90 A: and it's just so strange that i was making the point yesterday that you know women are can be totally independent and completely secure with themselves you know on a tuesday 

270.73 271.61 B: right 

270.81 280.29 A: and on a thursday once they find out you know that a boy that they like likes them back [laughter] you know it's just instant obsessed person [laughter] and that 

275.83 276.75 B: right 

279.48 280.76 B: oh yeah 

280.30 285.07 A: yeah i mean and it be- i became that person immediately 

284.78 285.75 B: mhm 

285.11 292.01 A: and i hate that now because you know he has without knowing it so much control over my psyche [laughter] 

291.29 292.80 B: isn't that awful 

292.87 296.39 B: what i i'm kind of the same way i mean it doesn't change 

296.26 309.05 B: at thirty two my date can be great and you know so and so is supposed to call ya about five o'clock and if you haven't heard from him by four o'clock all of a sudden panic ensues and all of a sudden now you're just a worthless piece of nothing 

298.79 299.85 A: mhm 

303.73 305.05 A: mhm 

308.70 309.96 A: [laughter] yes 

308.93 314.42 B: and i think that you know here this guy was probably attracted to my total independence and my 

314.33 317.80 B: i really don't care too much you know nothing's gonna get me down 

317.32 318.37 A: mhm 

317.67 323.48 B: but now i've let this person that is so attractive to me like watch it just fly out the window 

322.78 324.13 A: [laughter] right 

323.36 333.70 B: because i mean it is sad i mean and you try i don't know if you've had the thing where okay i'm gonna pretend like i'm not obsessed him and i'm just gonna let him think that i'm okay 

333.18 335.99 A: yes yes [laughter] 

334.54 341.10 B: yeah let him go out with his friends i'll go out with mine and i end up sitting here you know with a bucket of popcorn watching stupid moves 

338.96 340.17 A: (( right )) 

340.08 347.02 A: [laughter] it's so true it's so true well i mean i just told myself that today you know i sorta kinda been talking to 

342.20 344.09 B: (( yeah yeah [noise] )) 

346.88 361.01 A: um a couple of other guys that i had met through friends and thought they were interesting but you know nothing really much had happened you know just some emailing and calling and then as soon as this other guy came along i just sorta kinda dumped those other guys into the wayside 

353.11 354.21 B: mhm 

360.93 361.65 B: (( right )) 

361.01 366.98 A: and now you know even today i'm like well [mn] maybe i should just go back and start talking to those other guys too 

366.81 377.96 A: and i'm telling myself this so that i'll stop obsessing so much about this new guy but i know it's not gonna happen i'm still gonna be thinking about him and it's like you know trying to figure out what he's thinking too 

377.59 390.48 B: [laughter] oh my my problem always has been that they come in packs like you know i i last year for instance um i met somebody on a softball team and i thought okay well at that point in time he seemed okay and then 

385.28 386.26 A: mhm 

389.35 390.30 A: mhm 

390.53 403.33 B: as friends brought other guys around all of a sudden i realized that [mn] i was extremely desperate when i thought he was okay and i start to ante up and then that's when i get myself into trouble it's like i i don't know if 

397.73 398.69 A: right 

403.10 404.18 A: right 

403.58 417.13 B: if you are surrounded by friends who like are setting you up here and there and you're just like this is so tragic and then all of a sudden if somebody seemingly okay comes along it's like a total spark of this is it this has got to him [laughter] 

409.01 410.25 A: right 

412.03 413.41 A: (( right right )) 

414.84 421.16 A: [laughter] yeah and and you know it changes your entire outlook you're like yes i am cute yes 

420.44 422.22 B: (( oh isn't that terrible )) 

421.67 423.92 A: yes it's so terrible 

423.34 424.78 B: that's what you know 

424.64 432.13 B: i don't know i go through panic mode though too you go through that oh okay he must find me attractive and then for your first you know ten dates you 

426.59 427.79 A: mhm 

431.99 445.83 B: totally panic at the closest and the make up and yeah i overdo like if they've met me they generally met me with you know crazy looking hair and no make up and i try and change that whole thing for the first date which is no good but right 

433.28 434.21 A: oh yeah 

434.35 435.25 A: (( oh yeah )) 

437.28 438.31 A: mhm 

439.96 442.05 A: right [laughter] 

443.88 457.63 A: mhm right no i i totally agree i definitely do that too well i mean you know this guy has seen me in sort of you know my best and worst you know at work like he can see me in a suit or he can see me you know in jeans and you know 

452.68 453.61 B: right 

456.02 457.01 B: right 

457.69 471.25 A: i had thought he was cute before and then one day you know i show up to work and i'm just and i'm hung over from the night before and that's the day he chooses to ask me out so it's like you have no you know i have no clue when stuff like that's gonna happen 

471.03 471.87 B: right 

471.24 485.58 A: and and you just have no no control over it so that when it does happen and i feel like i don't look that good it just amazes me and i'm like oh well he really must like me and [laughter] i must really be you know attractive and 

485.14 486.48 B: oh gosh 

485.62 496.66 A: uh it just it is so terrible but i mean it's it's so funny like you said when you sort of put them into perspective of other people and then you come to realize that you know what was i so excited about 

496.29 504.56 B: oh isn't that yeah then yeah like a year down the road especially it's i don't know what do you work at like a really big building or do you work in a small building 

498.06 499.16 A: mhm 

500.34 501.44 A: mhm 

504.04 509.74 A: uh well we have a- about eleven floors so you know it's it's it's kinda medium size i would say 

509.23 512.13 B: i was gonna my one of my great friends um 

512.04 516.46 B: her when her and i first started hanging out together like three years ago she came to work for us 

516.34 519.73 B: and we don't have a dress code it's extremely lax 

519.25 520.19 A: mhm 

519.56 531.91 B: um in the winter months you know she was a sweatshirt girl or or whatever um ball cap and that was great and we hung out once a month together and then she became interested in the guy who was transferred into the company 

522.52 523.47 A: mhm 

531.51 532.54 A: mhm 

531.94 544.46 B: and now i can guarantee you this um every day [laughter] she looks like something from the cover of glamor magazine but i'm still a baseball cap girl and i'm telling i've i've told her you know i don't understand the pressure i couldn't even deal with the pressure 

537.22 539.87 A: (( [laughter] oh no )) 

540.71 541.72 A: (( [mn] )) 

543.71 545.02 A: mhm 

544.34 550.42 B: one day every other week and i'm stressing out over my wardrobe she has to do this five days a week 

547.36 548.99 A: [laughter] right 

549.47 552.40 A: oh my god that's terrible 

550.93 556.78 B: yeah but she's pulled it off she she does well i couldn't i i don't think i could do it 

556.18 559.80 A: no no i couldn't either i mean i'm so baseball cap girl too 

556.81 557.60 B: that 

559.50 560.75 B: oh that's good 

559.80 572.12 A: you know i wore jeans and a and a you know tee shirt to work today and it's just so weird because now with the situation it's kinda bizarre to run into this guy in the hall and you know we've gone out a couple of times but 

572.20 581.71 A: it's the annoying guy thing where you know i feel like there are the games and he doesn't call the next day and you know i get so old fashioned about stuff like that 

578.20 579.18 B: (( [mn] )) 

581.24 582.27 B: yeah 

581.65 589.71 A: that you know i think you you know email just doesn't cut it you know i'm not a huge phone person but i want you to call me and 

589.15 591.76 B: yeah a call means that you're interested [laughter] 

591.11 598.88 A: yeah exactly and you know what if guys really knew what it took it takes so little to make us happy when it comes to stuff like that 

597.00 599.95 B: i think they know i think that's the problem they know and
