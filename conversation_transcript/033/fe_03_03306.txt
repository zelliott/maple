341.59 344.03 A: (( [laughter] )) 

345.08 348.77 B: he's the guy that takes everything off the ship so everybody else can get some

368.96 371.42 A: (( oh it's got to be your best friend )) 

371.95 373.25 B: that helps 

372.91 375.98 A: gotta have honesty in everything 

377.20 379.08 A: and communication 

381.35 383.59 B: i agree totally 

383.00 385.41 A: i think those are the most important things 

386.99 392.45 B: if you're not good friends with 'em don't bother marrying 'em 'cause they've gotta be your best friend 

396.24 400.29 B: i agree totally you have to be able to trust that person 

400.13 401.47 A: ((  )) 

401.98 403.25 A: you lose trust 

402.48 407.02 B: 'cause that's the person that's going to take care of you when you can't take care of yourself 

408.27 409.50 A: (( yes )) 

410.52 412.52 A: and if things happen to 

413.28 416.26 A: break that trust it becomes very difficult yes 

416.34 418.05 B: yeah 

420.91 425.23 B: that's why when when the trust is lost marriages fail 

428.84 431.57 A: sometimes no matter how hard you try to keep it 

432.21 435.40 B: you can't get it back it has to be earned 

438.00 439.21 B: very true 

439.00 439.84 A: (( no ))
