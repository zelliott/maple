82.61 84.94 B: somebody that i can trust 

85.58 90.09 B: and someone who um respects me

97.06 98.08 A: mhm 

98.14 99.64 B: [lipsmack] what do you think 

99.85 107.78 A: [laughter] i think you're very blessed first of all [laughter] [laughter] i just um i just signed my final divorce papers yesterday

108.63 110.80 A: yeah so um 

110.36 116.47 B: ironic to have this question now but maybe this is really fresh in your mind too [laughter] 

111.52 112.93 A: (( yeah )) 

114.75 120.38 A: [laughter] it is and i have to agree with you on the honesty thing 

120.55 122.02 A: that um 

122.36 125.32 A: that is the most valued thing i i would look for 

125.49 126.30 B: mhm 

125.78 129.89 A: in a a life mate [laughter] and um 

127.63 129.40 B: mhm mhm 

131.14 140.39 A: actually definitely respect too i'm sorry if i'm echoing i'm sitting in the back of my car with my little boy he just woke up [laughter] he was taking a nap so [laughter] 

136.63 142.47 B: oh bless his heart [laughter] no you're you're s- you're coming across nice and clear 

142.15 147.59 A: oh okay [laughter] but um respect definitely also because i think if they respect you 

147.64 152.82 A: then everything will follow such as the honesty and the trust and 

149.45 150.29 B: yes 

152.15 152.87 B: yes 

153.58 155.45 A: yes [laughter] 

154.70 162.35 B: yeah i think that's very true and of course i look at these realistically because there are times 

162.48 166.33 B: and seasons you know i- in our marriage where we would get 

166.68 168.69 B: kinda [mn] in 

168.86 183.62 B: [sigh] i guess you'd call it bad habits you know just ways that weren't good and and communication to me is is vitally important as well because um [mn] i freely communicate to him when 

171.22 172.29 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

176.44 177.15 A: (( okay )) 

183.65 190.76 B: he hurts me [laughter] or or you know or when i disagree i'm not afraid to say that or when i need help 

185.02 186.14 A: mm [laughter] 

190.45 191.66 A: right 

190.63 199.22 B: and i guess i have w- eh we have a two couples that we're dealing with right now that both of 'em the husband just does nothing 

199.15 208.96 B: you know to and they both work fulltime and one has two children even and to have no [mn] you know that is [mn] 

199.56 200.34 A: (( mm mm )) 

209.27 213.81 B: shows me no communication no respect um 

212.75 213.79 A: right 

213.97 218.98 B: and and then i want to kind of talk to them at the same time saying why 

218.22 219.00 A: (( uh-huh )) 

219.02 224.03 B: why would you allow this i'd never allow it [laughter] to begin with [laughter] 

221.29 224.20 A: (( [laughter] so okay [cough] )) 

224.00 237.08 B: it's quite you know you talk to him and say listen i need help you know because [mn] i [mn] right now i'm not working fulltime but i have different times during our marriage and and those were the times when i speak up and say 

237.08 249.71 B: well listen you know this is this is not working like it is and if i'm going to continue you've you've gotta jump in there and help me and uh um and so he's he's very gracious to 

245.37 246.60 A: right 

250.21 253.83 B: not be afraid to do that he's not afraid of hard work and i think 

254.21 255.93 B: i'm really blessed to 

255.79 258.75 A: you are do you think it's easier i'm sorry 

256.75 259.88 B: to have no you go ahead 

259.86 262.92 A: [laughter] do you think it's easier because he's a minister 

260.65 261.32 B: (( go )) 

262.97 264.16 A: so you have 

264.25 266.17 A: um you know l- like 

266.55 272.86 A: you know the the man's supposed to be the head of the family as long as our heavenly father is the head of the man 

273.26 286.88 B: ah- right it makes a big difference um i think [mn] the fact that i don't think so much a a minister as a as a christian you know just um um i made sure that we were 

274.97 276.24 A: yeah 

282.40 283.22 A: mhm 

287.53 297.58 B: you know compatible there to begin with you know early in the dating relationship ah in fact our first date we had this incredible talk um and 

289.21 291.11 A: yeah 

297.66 300.79 B: i i found out so much about him just from that 

300.47 301.50 A: mhm 

300.82 302.26 B: time um 

302.58 311.26 B: and so i think that that helps tremendously i also realize though that there are seasons where you kind of you get 

311.53 315.54 B: you know you ebb and flow and you have to 

313.25 314.12 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

315.80 319.60 B: work past those when it's uh you know but 

319.60 331.23 B: [mn] but i had a great lump of clay to begin [laughter] with [laughter] you're not supposed to try and change 'em [laughter] but [laughter] well i you know you still goodness you have to um 

322.41 324.81 A: [laughter] 

326.14 330.15 A: (( right [laughter] i know what you mean [laughter] )) 

331.62 342.90 B: uh work with them and they have to work with you you know because he has he has um helped me to change myself i think that is a better way of putting it you know 

334.86 336.10 A: right 

342.03 343.25 A: (( uh-huh )) 

342.95 346.05 B: um and and i have helped him to chang- you know 

346.03 349.10 B: himself to to point things out and 

346.97 347.99 A: mhm 

348.97 361.70 B: and it's also been helpful that we both our parents have successful marriages as well and so we have that kind of um um we have that kind of um 

354.30 355.27 A: yes 

362.02 364.18 B: [lipsmack] history you know to 

362.99 364.30 A: right 

364.23 366.59 B: that that makes a difference um 

365.85 376.91 A: i definitely think my i think that makes a huge difference actually because my parents are still together and my soon to be ex husband's um they divorced when he was like five 

376.61 378.75 B: [noise] wow [noise] 

377.34 380.79 A: so yeah he didn't know how a good marriage worked 

379.20 379.76 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

381.03 383.61 A: and that was so hard for him all the time 

381.20 382.53 B: (( yes [noise] )) 

383.25 384.43 B: yes 

385.10 386.74 A: are you in the car [laughter] 

385.47 386.04 B: (( [noise] )) 

386.33 389.04 B: um i'm in the car also yes [noise] and my 

387.97 389.13 A: [laughter] 

389.06 399.41 B: my daughter just finished with her appointment so she's got nana and it's ringing all the bells [laughter] right now so um but it's um 

391.96 393.35 A: [laughter] 

394.96 397.17 A: [laughter] 

400.21 410.18 B: [lipsmack] so are you looking for are y- i mean do you hope to find someone after a reasonable time of healing um 

409.48 416.98 A: i would like to but i'm having a problem actually because i know in the bible it says about remarriage that it's not 

411.18 412.02 B: uh-huh 

417.23 419.30 A: something that we're supposed to look for 

419.53 422.82 A: i mean divorce first of all is a big no no 

423.07 428.61 A: and then to remarry i i'm just having a bi- actually a big spiritual dilemma with this 

428.71 430.67 A: weird that we're talking what 

430.08 432.74 B: well you know what [laughter] 

432.17 433.53 A: [laughter] 

432.93 435.15 B: you just need to um 

435.36 439.80 B: [noise] i'm sorry this is the pastor's wife in me ah it's probably 

436.21 437.24 A: that's okay 

440.30 448.47 B: more than anything god wants us to rely on him and let him be sufficient for us 

447.88 449.75 A: mhm 

449.20 450.66 B: (( but um )) 

453.34 455.75 B: [lipsmack] it's important to ask him 

456.13 467.08 B: and then let him take his time to answer you when it will be best for you to hear his answer you know what i'm saying because because i have a friend who 

462.30 462.97 A: okay 

463.34 464.22 A: yes 

467.24 480.76 B: um i think she divorced probably in her forties anyway and she chose never to remarry and that worked out for her but i know others that have remarried you know and um 

474.07 475.39 A: mhm 

481.99 482.90 B: (( i )) 

484.77 492.46 B: [mn] you there's that there's that personal part of me that hopes that i would never have to you know come to grips with that but 

490.96 491.92 A: right 

492.33 500.90 B: [mn] um be- just because i i do feel strongly you know about [mn] trying at all costs to avoid divorce but you need to 

499.12 500.16 A: (( mhm okay )) 

502.86 505.43 B: you just need to let god speak to you 

505.74 508.23 B: personally and then 

508.30 515.63 B: write it down and date it and and stand on whatever it is he he um 

516.96 518.18 B: tells you 

518.20 519.14 A: okay 

518.32 528.93 B: you know and and 'cause this is one issue where everybody wants to give their opinion and you know it it there are 

524.21 525.33 A: mhm 

529.30 539.36 B: good things about being single [laughter] you know even if you're a single parent there are some good things about it but then there are definitely some difficult things about it 

539.06 540.16 A: right 

539.87 544.62 B: and and so god knows exactly what is best for you 

544.46 545.58 A: mhm 

545.01 549.26 B: and i think it's just trusting that that he really does know best 

549.27 550.23 A: okay 

549.44 555.36 B: you know he doesn't tell us something that is going to be hard for us that 

555.80 565.80 B: that we're going to be miserable now he wants the exact opposite he wants us to live life and live it more abundantly you know and he's talking about the here and now and not just heaven 

561.68 562.65 A: mhm 

565.63 566.73 A: right 

566.80 568.04 B: so um 

568.50 570.42 B: anyway that's my [laughter] 

570.61 573.09 B: my two cents on that right right 

571.76 579.72 A: no tha- [laughter] that's helpful because i i just turn- i turned thirty in december and it's like i can't imagine the rest of my life not [noise] 

573.10 582.76 B: (( [noise] i you know )) 

579.82 582.81 A: having someone to love me or you know and love back 

582.64 596.56 B: and [noise] i'm sorry we have a window now we're on an interstate [laughter] and it's really loud i didn't expect her to be done this quick 

582.94 586.72 A: and that's really weighing on me i don't know how i'm supposed to feel 

590.43 591.51 A: that's okay 

593.21 594.51 A: [laughter] 

595.93 597.80 A: [laughter] that's okay 

597.43 598.76 B: (( but um )) 

598.80 599.89 B: you know he wants
