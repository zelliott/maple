26.97 31.60 A: interesting [laughter] how long have you been together 

27.17 29.09 B: (( cool [laughter] )) 

31.37 33.69 B: uh about 

34.04 36.21 B: twelve years 

35.10 37.24 A: wow that's a long time 

38.59 39.77 B: what about you 

39.61 41.54 A: uh about two years 

42.87 46.38 A: so not that long but um hopefully we'll be that long 

47.54 50.04 A: what do you think are the most important things mhm mhm 

50.31 51.38 B: um 

53.00 56.19 B: well i think a big one is like communication 

56.23 59.72 B: and i know we had to work on that really hard in the beginning 

61.08 62.01 B: (( but )) 

62.43 66.68 B: and also like one of the things i've found that 

67.08 68.91 B: makes me stay with her 

69.12 71.61 B: is the freedom to be me 

73.01 78.34 B: however weird or whatever that is [laughter] 

76.61 78.05 A: right right 

78.30 82.37 A: 'cause you you can you get to know somebody that well and 

82.55 85.04 A: you can pretty much you don't have to worry 

85.84 88.06 A: about trying to impress 

88.12 88.98 A: maybe 

88.60 91.48 B: yeah and 

92.12 97.02 B: and just like if i'm having a hard day or if she's having a hard day 

97.78 104.33 B: it's not like a really huge deal i mean we just know and we help each other and 

106.44 108.63 A: yeah that's great 

110.59 113.40 B: what about you what do you think is important 

113.33 114.39 A: um 

114.93 116.51 A: i think that 

118.08 119.44 A: i think that 

119.55 122.54 A: allowing each other space to like do 

122.94 127.62 A: um your own things is important too as well as having things in common 

128.04 129.80 B: yeah that's true too 

129.51 131.07 A: you know um 

131.76 133.48 B: like we spend a lot of 

132.09 134.82 A: it's hard to find that balance [laughter] 

133.84 139.66 B: mhm we spend a lot of time in the same room doing totally different things [laughter] 

139.04 144.96 A: yeah yeah we do that sometimes in the same room sometimes not in the same room 

145.51 147.62 A: but um i think having 

147.67 153.33 A: things in common is really helpful too but not necessarily everything has to be in common 

154.21 156.25 B: yeah 

156.17 157.94 A: like i don't think that 

158.10 159.50 A: you need to 

159.84 163.62 A: like all of the same things or want to do the same things 

163.19 164.22 B: right 

163.95 169.34 A: but i think at the beginning that's helpful like to have some stuff that you can like you're both into 

168.16 173.40 B: yeah we share some common interests but not not all 

170.50 171.49 A: yeah 

172.09 173.03 A: (( [laughter] )) 

173.12 174.16 A: right 

175.21 176.07 A: right 

178.33 183.01 B: like we both like some of the same t. v. shows but not 

183.68 184.89 B: not all 

184.77 185.68 A: right 

185.68 193.00 B: and the same with music but yet if we wanna put music we can usually agree on something our tastes are not 

191.33 192.23 A: right 

193.46 195.73 B: our tastes are pretty dissimilar 

196.44 197.52 B: (( but )) 

198.32 202.50 B: it works because like okay like if i like an album 

202.15 203.25 A: mhm 

202.51 208.53 B: she won't like that album or if my favorite songs are her least favorite songs 

208.60 210.00 B: and vice versa 

210.38 216.80 B: but yet we both know like we like that album or that group or whatever and 

218.03 222.82 B: you know so it's it's sort of similar but not too similar 

219.08 220.09 A: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

223.32 225.11 A: (( [noise] that's good )) 

225.35 226.54 A: [laughter] 

227.06 228.24 A: this is funny 

228.59 229.58 B: [laughter] 

231.10 238.30 A: is this for i don't know is this for what we're talking about or is it for the phone service that they're testing do you know 

238.16 240.23 B: i have no idea 

239.59 240.97 A: (( i'm just curious )) 

242.19 244.83 B: (( [laughter] i don't )) 

242.67 247.50 A: [laughter] do they ask all those questions about what type of phone you're on so i don't know but 

246.33 249.35 B: know yeah i thought that was kind of strange 

248.60 250.73 A: (( yeah i don't know know for sure )) 

251.66 254.63 B: but i really don't know how come 

252.86 253.42 A: (( [mn] )) 

255.42 260.17 B: how they managed to match up me and you 'cause i don't think we ever 

262.36 264.58 B: did we answer questions like 

264.44 267.28 A: no i think it's i think that was just um 

267.88 269.20 A: a chance 

269.52 271.12 A: (( i mean i i think )) 

269.86 276.97 B: that 'cause i don't remember putting down that that you know like my age or my job and everything but 

276.13 277.24 A: yeah 

276.98 281.58 B: i don't think i put down like [laughter] who i live with or whatever 

278.54 279.59 A: no 

280.95 286.83 A: no i don't i don't i think it's just a random occurrence [laughter] i know 

284.08 288.06 B: that's cool [laughter] they did a good job 

287.54 289.14 A: yeah 

289.31 295.54 A: that's funny where did you hear about it we probably do we need i guess we probably need to talk about the topic completely 

294.20 295.09 B: yeah 

295.11 296.56 B: [laughter] 

295.80 297.64 A: okay um 

298.57 300.87 A: what are most important in life partners 

300.97 302.33 A: um 

302.65 307.02 A: uh patience [laughter] i think 

305.94 307.54 B: yeah that's a good one 

307.13 308.12 A: you know 

308.82 310.22 A: and uh 

311.32 312.86 A: i guess i 

313.16 317.82 A: guess knowing that you wanna be with somebody for the rest of your life 

317.93 322.06 A: [laughter] you know i mean i don't know i mean i guess that 

319.05 320.83 B: yeah 

323.23 327.80 A: i don't know i never really i don't know if i really think about it like that like life partners 

327.23 333.87 B: yeah i don't either i mean like when when i met her we didn't 

334.74 336.86 A: you don't really it's not like 

335.28 340.08 B: (( i mean we were friends and i had a crush on somebody else )) 

339.29 340.79 A: yeah 

341.34 342.80 B: and 

342.36 344.88 A: you can't really tell where things are gonna go 

343.97 349.42 B: yeah and it just i don't know it just kind of 

349.97 356.22 B: we just got really close and we just didn't wanna be apart 

356.07 357.18 A: yeah 

358.24 359.71 B: and it wasn't like 

359.99 363.92 B: i mean she had a crush on me for a long time and i didn't even know 

364.41 365.26 B: (( but )) 

366.26 369.02 B: i was totally like not looking 

369.05 377.56 B: for that really i mean i was just coming out and i was like you know wanted to like do things and learn things and 

372.49 373.45 A: mhm

382.31 383.46 A: yeah 

387.33 388.43 A: (( yeah i )) 

388.57 392.03 A: guess sometimes do you ever think that you wanna 

393.11 395.26 A: that you missed out on something 

396.93 397.97 B: (( what do ya mean )) 

397.41 400.53 A: you know well like if if you were just coming out like i mean 

400.32 401.18 B: (( oh )) 

400.76 403.42 A: as far as dating other people and that kinda thing 

403.03 405.59 B: (( kinda yeah )) 

404.33 410.53 A: that's kinda it's interesting because like my girlfriend's like that too like she's just i was the first woman she's been with 

405.73 409.03 B: i mean we definitely yeah 

410.55 413.49 A: so i think sometimes she might feel that way 

414.91 418.38 B: yeah it's definitely an issue but 

417.53 418.56 A: yeah 

418.72 425.42 B: you know i also don't wanna [laughter] do anything about it so 

424.07 426.23 A: right yeah

441.21 442.34 A: yeah 

441.73 443.57 B: was one person 

443.82 448.95 B: and i kind of wish that that first crush i had had on somebody else 

450.81 452.11 A: right had 

451.36 453.71 B: that i'd just have gotten the chance 

454.27 456.72 B: to kiss or something you know [laughter]

458.35 461.74 B: but i don't know i'm happy so

467.21 468.51 B: (( yeah )) 

467.36 471.08 A: we're getting back to the t- the topic [lipsmack] and so you know

476.08 481.12 B: it is a life partner it's a companion for life it 

481.13 482.11 B: it's

490.81 492.35 A: yeah

501.57 502.58 A: yeah

512.30 513.80 A: (( i just think you know )) 

514.99 518.50 A: if you're going to be if you're going to spend 

518.86 526.20 A: most of your time with one person for an extended period of time in my life then it's like has to change you know 

526.00 527.00 B: yeah
