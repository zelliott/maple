7.17 7.98 A: yes 

7.90 8.89 B: hi 

8.75 9.91 A: hi there 

9.52 13.92 B: boy that's quite a heavy topic [laughter] i 

11.56 14.95 A: yeah i know i was like okay [laughter] 

14.22 16.69 B: (( i don't know if i'm up to that my goodness )) 

15.77 17.59 A: [laughter] i know 

17.84 22.51 A: (( um i myself [noise] um i've i've uh been married twenty years )) 

22.64 29.07 A: and i think that probably the most important thing that i feel like in a relationship is looking for an honest man 

28.99 32.12 B: ah yes that would be right at the top of mine 

31.93 33.11 A: mhm 

32.49 37.23 B: i have never been married so i should probably just listen and [laughter] 

35.44 40.84 A: [laughter] [noise] no i got married when i was really young actually so 

37.62 38.29 B: (( y- )) 

41.21 55.16 A: [noise] i don't know we it we we've been happily we've got two kids um we've had our differences we've had our problems but i think a- another thing that you have to know is just to that everybody's different and you are two different people and you're not always going to agree 

55.60 57.10 B: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

57.67 59.37 A: but what are you looking for 

59.58 67.52 B: well um actually i remember once going through an exercise where i i looked at my friends and 

65.19 66.11 A: (( [noise] )) 

67.27 68.43 A: [noise] 

67.53 68.51 B: um 

68.87 75.22 B: figured out what kinds of qualities they all had in common you know past boyfriends and and just friends 

75.18 76.12 A: right 

75.31 77.67 B: and honesty was one of them 

77.93 79.06 B: um 

80.40 85.98 B: [lipsmack] let's see this was a while ago what was what were the other two i had three three qualities [cough] 

86.01 86.89 B: um 

88.74 89.99 A: [noise] 

89.46 92.37 B: oh gee being being uh 

92.55 95.25 B: a good listener i think was one of them 

93.98 95.72 A: yes very important 

95.96 97.40 B: and um 

98.38 103.37 B: boy i can't remember now what what the other one was maybe a sense of humour 

103.46 105.32 B: something like that [lipsmack] 

103.79 109.18 A: oh yeah that'll get you through just about anything being able to laugh at yourself 

106.87 108.43 B: yeah 

110.45 114.39 B: yeah i'm i'm with somebody now that i've been with about a year 

114.40 115.93 A: good good 

114.92 121.61 B: and uh we're we're real happy it's every not everything is as i would have expected but you know i've 

121.20 122.45 A: it 

121.89 126.27 B: i i should expect that everything's not going to be as i expect [laughter] 

124.35 127.24 A: that's right this is real life not fantasy 

127.19 128.47 B: right 

128.62 131.49 B: and he was raised in england 

131.54 133.94 B: so some of some of 

131.96 133.05 A: oh wow 

133.08 135.31 A: where were you raised where you live now or 

134.81 137.95 B: yeah well in minnesota mostly [lipsmack] 

138.53 146.33 B: and uh so some of his expectations are a little bit different from from mine just because of the differences in how we were raised and that's always interesting 

145.07 147.26 A: differences in culture right 

146.41 151.67 B: mhm not that much you know it's only england but still there's a few differences 

152.61 163.92 B: and uh but it's it's a learning process and like you said there are two different people you don't ex- you can't just kind of mold a fantasy and then expect the other person to fit right in there 

162.99 168.64 A: and yeah expect it to be like you expect it to be and for them to think like you think and it 

168.93 170.44 A: (( just isn't going to happen )) 

171.03 179.04 A: i think you've just gotta have you have to be able to compromise i would say that compromise is one of the big things in a relationship too somebody that's willing to compromise 

178.74 180.04 B: mhm 

179.43 181.98 A: not my way or the highway kind of thing 

181.97 184.38 B: oh goodness that wouldn't last very long would it 

184.39 186.66 A: no [laughter] 

184.73 188.09 B: [laughter] especially if you're both that way [laughter] 

187.23 189.58 A: [laughter] 

188.55 197.57 B: i've known some couples where one of 'em did seem to be that way and the other person just kind of let it all happen and i i don't know that didn't seem very healthy to me 

196.17 202.75 A: [noise] i can't handle that i couldn't yeah i that's that's no good either i mean it's gotta be a it's gotta be a nice balance 

197.63 198.61 B: no 

202.76 204.04 B: yeah 

204.57 206.74 B: my parents have been married for 

207.00 209.69 B: gosh forty three years 

209.32 210.63 A: oh my god 

210.41 216.11 B: and they've been through quite a bit but boy they they've stuck together and they've they've always [lipsmack] 

214.53 221.51 A: and see a lot of it is that just deciding to stick together and work it out regardless of you know the good and the bad and the ugly 

221.34 222.77 B: mhm 

222.89 227.59 B: well i really admire them for [laughter] for still being together [laughter] 

222.90 224.26 A: and just know that 

226.97 233.34 A: no that's not easy [noise] i think you've gotta kind of make a commitment to work it out and it can't just be you it's gotta be between the two of you 

233.45 236.91 A: you can't just say i'm gonna you know this is gonna last this is gonna work 

237.03 240.39 A: and another person is out there footloose and fancy free that does not 

240.91 243.54 B: no that wouldn't be very good [lipsmack] 

242.01 244.17 A: that doesn't that doesn't work either 

243.90 245.58 B: yeah it takes two 

245.56 246.43 A: yeah 

246.59 250.30 A: commitment to each other or commitment to the you know the relationship even 

251.33 254.65 B: right and that in some ways that's two different things 

254.08 255.74 A: [noise] yeah 

255.07 263.96 B: to say um i'm committed to another individual and also there are things that you might do just for the relationship separate from the individual 

263.71 273.94 A: yeah and it'll and your friends you know your friends are you gotta be have friends that are friends of the relationship not the kind to try to bust them up you know like girlfriends that are jealous 

273.63 275.38 B: oh heavens yes 

275.12 279.65 A: and you know that happens all the time i know it happens to guys too but i think girls are the worst 

279.42 281.01 B: mhm 

280.02 283.38 A: uh you don't need that you know [noise] you just don't put up with that 

283.72 286.77 A: get out of that relationship simply because they're not in one 

287.17 289.07 B: oh that's so destructive 

288.86 298.84 A: i know it's horrible and i um i've got a a daughter that's eighteen and i tell you what these teenagers nowadays the girls are [noise] a little rough on each other [laughter] 

297.85 299.40 B: (( wow )) 

299.13 300.17 A: yeah 

299.42 301.82 B: uh where where did you say you lived 

301.72 303.82 A: in actually dallas texas 

303.74 304.85 B: (( oh okay )) 

305.93 310.26 A: but yeah i mean they they've they've got a rough life as teenagers now 

310.38 315.21 A: you know and learning to deal with their relationships because it's so much different than when i was young 

316.32 317.84 B: yeah 

316.82 321.68 A: you know the relationships and the situations even that they're put into nowadays 

323.35 325.33 B: yeah that's for sure 

324.08 325.21 A: are you know 

326.23 328.28 B: i know that if i 

326.44 333.24 A: are a lot their their relationships are so much more grown up than mine have been you know at their age 

334.65 338.54 B: yeah i certainly wasn't in anything serious at eighteen [laughter] 

337.75 338.74 A: no 

339.11 343.42 A: uh-uh yeah she had one boyfriend in ninth grade for three years 

343.15 344.56 B: oh wow 

343.95 346.51 A: (( and i was like she's too young for this )) 

345.64 347.27 B: [laughter] 

346.60 348.14 A: (( you're too young )) 

347.70 351.20 B: [laughter] look around and see what's available 

348.90 349.91 A: [laughter] 

351.02 352.47 A: yeah 

352.77 356.24 A: there's more to life than that one guy [laughter] 

354.76 356.53 B: [laughter] 

357.01 358.10 B: yeah 

357.66 359.11 A: (( you're too young )) 

359.81 360.80 A: but 

361.27 366.45 B: i can see it going both ways you know i guess there are cultures where they get married very young 

366.38 367.43 A: oh yeah 

366.81 376.04 B: and in some ways it might be easier if they don't know anything different they just accept this is this is my partner and then we learn how to make it work 

376.01 376.86 A: right 

376.62 379.55 B: you know as long as they're not a bad person [laughter] 

379.19 380.49 A: right right 

380.71 383.68 A: as long as they're not being abused in the relationship or 

384.62 386.27 A: anything like that 

385.64 386.64 B: yeah 

387.44 389.31 A: or being taken advantage of even 

389.33 390.40 B: right 

391.40 398.51 B: i know my parents if i were to ask them they would they would say religion was very important i'm i'm not religious 

396.98 398.48 A: oh yeah 

398.59 403.83 B: but but i know for them that has really been quite a foundation for their marriage 

403.06 416.90 A: well and see that my parents have been married i think like thirty five years or so but they too ha- they're very very very religious and very very into the church and i would say that they would probably say a lot of that foundation that they've given me 

417.17 420.84 A: has helped too but but i'm not re- very religious either 

422.56 423.86 B: mhm 

424.01 428.82 B: maybe being similar in your outlook on religion would be an important thing [lipsmack] 

428.10 430.92 A: um right right i think so too 

430.53 435.33 B: whether you're both very religious or both nonreligious at least being similar [lipsmack] 

433.72 435.41 A: oh gosh yeah 

436.45 438.98 A: because that's so that's so 

439.66 442.83 A: detrimental in a relationship the way you feel 

442.82 443.81 B: mhm 

444.36 450.64 A: religion and politics [laughter] you almost wanna make sure that your your partner is in the same [noise] 

450.83 454.89 A: has the same political views as you too 'cause that can cause problems as well 

454.84 456.50 B: yeah and 

456.55 466.55 B: a person's political views are really their views about you know it it's not just how they vote it's kinda how they look at look at a lot of make a lot of their personal decisions too 

462.25 463.45 A: that's right 

465.89 467.68 A: mhm yeah 

467.00 467.80 B: so 

467.97 471.68 A: so that's um i guess an important thing to look for in a relationship too 

473.08 477.22 B: i think my parent- my parents never discussed voting with me they said that 

477.41 488.33 B: they they didn't go vote because their votes would cancel each other out so neither of them voted [laughter] and that's all i ever heard them talk about it i i don't even know what their political views were [laughter] 

481.23 482.70 A: [laughter] 

484.66 485.60 A: [laughter] 

486.92 493.43 A: well see you know i thought of that as you know me too with with my kids growing up i've you know i've got two teenage kids 

493.40 506.90 A: and i don't remember ever talking about politics with my parents or how they voted or anything like that but my children are very involved in it you know they're very involved in politics i don't know if they just teach it more at school 

501.78 502.75 B: mhm 

508.00 512.93 A: but you know they'll ask us you know what policies and what issues and things 

513.10 517.04 A: that he and i vote for or who what candidates and 

514.72 515.45 B: (( oh )) 

517.17 520.22 A: they're just really into it but they have a lot of um 

521.29 523.13 A: you know i guess thing- 

523.72 529.83 A: voting things there at school just to see how the school would vote and how many students will turn out things like that 

529.88 530.95 B: okay 

531.85 536.14 B: i would think that would be better to discuss things like that [laughter] 

535.62 536.98 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

539.68 544.62 B: well let's see what else i think we're kind of lucky we have a very similar taste in music 

544.87 551.12 B: and we we constantly have music going and i can't imagine being with someone that that 

550.50 551.74 A: without it 

551.21 556.09 B: had different that liked music that i didn't like [laughter] or vice versa 

554.76 555.68 A: now we 

556.43 568.05 A: we like to um we like to share a lot of outdoor activities together we both like to camp and fish and hunt well we don't hunt but we fish and ride bikes and kayak and stuff 

567.94 569.53 B: oh wow that's neat 

569.28 571.79 A: (( yeah we love to do stuff like that )) 

572.75 581.67 A: a lotta outdoor outdoor stuff i guess that's important what activities you like that you enjoy the same you know your downtime that you can enjoy it together 

581.51 587.83 B: yeah and a lot of times that's how people meet anyway is doing some recreational activities 

585.26 586.55 A: yeah 

587.62 595.52 A: that's a good that's a really a good way in my book it's a good way to meet somebody out there doing what you would be doing anyway 

591.65 593.07 B: mhm 

595.17 599.89 B: oh exactly yeah i i have friends that go do stuff just because they
