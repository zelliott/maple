77.40 78.94 B: oh neat 

78.36 90.03 A: and uh i was in san diego and i didn't really know that many people and actually i'd just been through a pretty nasty relationship i thought well i'll get out and meet some people and met him and um yeah it was 

89.49 91.05 B: and hit it off 

90.46 103.34 A: yep absolutely so i suppose i if to speak to the con- the topic of the conversation [laughter] i guess i must have had some idea what i was looking for because that's part of why i looked on the internet was that i could sort of have this list of 

94.20 97.15 B: oh yes of course yeah yeah yeah [laughter] 

103.54 105.10 A: qualifications 

105.19 108.45 A: before i would uh even go out with someone so 

108.03 109.31 B: mhm 

108.70 109.74 A: um 

109.81 116.27 B: yeah definitely i i i actually looked on the internet also i find i mean i've tried it a while ago 

115.84 116.86 A: mhm 

116.28 125.98 B: um because you i mean you get that option to you know to make those choices and i guess it makes it a little easier but um i don't know my experience is 

120.61 121.78 A: that's right 

126.31 134.83 B: i haven't i mean when i did it on the internet it i didn't meet the same kind of persons that i did when i met them off th- you know what i mean 

132.65 133.72 A: right 

134.26 135.65 A: oh okay 

135.13 141.29 B: i mean it was uh it was just um how do i explain it uh i 

141.56 147.36 B: mean it was like too perfect you know because you got to pick exactly what you were looking for i think 

143.50 144.48 A: mhm 

146.10 147.47 A: yeah 

147.49 153.15 B: um but uh i mean it works for some people it works for you know than it does for others 

152.77 153.86 A: yeah 

153.63 155.92 B: um but uh 

156.12 159.77 B: what what were your qua- i mean what were you looking for specifically 

159.16 174.08 A: well um i wanted to make sure that they were s- they you know screen out anybody that had like definite religious differences that would be important or political differences that would be important that kind of stuff and you know just basic sort of age geogra- you know 

170.49 171.43 B: uh-huh 

173.61 175.24 B: so it was more 

174.18 177.65 A: basic stuff but there were some things that i thought well you know 

177.67 179.40 A: there's no point in me 

179.48 185.75 A: going out with someone and then finding we're going violently disagree on you know an issue that's very important to me so 

184.49 190.27 B: right so but it wasn't it was more uh personal reasons than physical 

190.14 192.10 A: yes yeah 

191.68 198.39 B: yeah no that's uh yeah i mean it it go- i think it goes both ways a little bit i mean i like to i mean 

198.65 210.07 B: it's nice to have someone who shares the same uh you know beliefs and and has the same interests but the same time i you know i kind of like a little bit of diversity 

205.32 206.36 A: mhm 

209.39 213.20 A: oh absolutely yeah well that's what i've ended up with i mean if uh 

210.10 211.23 B: yeah 

213.34 226.72 A: [laughter] well if we ever get on to a gun control discussion the relationship gets in real danger [laughter] but uh [laughter] at least we have different opinions on that but i mean yeah there are things that we differ enormously on but 

216.36 217.53 B: [laughter] 

219.33 221.72 B: yeah yeah 

226.64 230.09 B: uh and was he looking for the same things as well or 

229.49 232.78 A: i think so yeah yeah um 

233.04 233.77 B: (( mm )) 

233.41 239.75 A: i'm trying to remember what he said way back then but i mean we both are sort of um 

240.12 249.54 A: how to say uh we have a slightly alternative viewpoint not not we're not too conservative or mainstream or or whatever and uh 

249.59 255.58 A: so it was important to both of us to sort of meet someone that had a slightly you know 

257.02 268.38 A: different view of the world not necessarily the same view of the world but you know it was a person who would question things and that kind of stuff so you know we we found each other and it worked so that was good [laughter] 

267.41 276.60 B: right yeah um i mean i haven't i haven't dated anyone at least three mo- i mean probably like six months um 

274.69 275.64 A: mhm 

276.87 282.92 B: i don't know i i it's just so hard i mean i dated i was in a relationship for a few years and i thought it was 

282.97 287.66 B: uh you know exa- what i was looking for but then it ended and it was 

287.79 293.71 B: i mean it ended amicably but it was at the same time it was like eye opening because it wasn't what i was looking for 

293.61 303.29 B: it was i don't know it was when i wasn't dating when it was realized that i you know i wanted you know kind of like the same thing that you were going for someone who shares the same interests 

302.91 303.86 A: mhm 

303.43 311.09 B: and while i was in that relationship i didn't i think i was kind of blind sighted and we weren't so much alike as we thought we were 

310.51 314.04 A: so you were staying together for the wrong reasons but you didn't realize it at the time 

313.11 316.66 B: yeah i mean it co- it became more of a routine 

316.19 317.12 A: uh-huh 

316.67 331.05 B: in that uh we just got too comfortable with the fact of having a relationship and we uh it was just uh you know we saw each other too much and we kind of didn't have our own we kind of you know stopped seeing our other friends 

319.41 320.54 A: right 

330.67 331.88 A: mhm 

331.01 340.43 B: and so it was just it was too much you know and so not being in that relationship i got to spend i was starting to see my friends again [laughter] make new friends and 

338.82 339.87 A: mhm 

340.39 354.02 B: um that's when i realized that you know i don't know so there was something definitely wrong with that relationship because there was it was too needy or time consuming for both of us where we just got too consumed with it that we kind of lost track you know we needed that separate space 

353.41 354.63 A: right 

353.90 368.85 B: and so that's what i'm looking i mean that's what i'm currently looking looking for in a relationship is that kind of equal balance um you know that you spend with each other but at the same time uh you know you still go out with your friends or or have your own space i guess is what it is 

365.81 367.34 A: (( mhm )) 

368.22 369.49 A: yeah 

368.95 371.11 B: i think it it's pretty important 

370.58 378.09 A: so do you think that was to do with the person you were dating before that that happened or was it just a pa- a bad habit pattern that you both got into 

377.89 384.09 B: i think it was just a bad ha- like a pattern that we got into because we had our own friends and then uh 

380.53 381.81 A: mhm 

384.28 388.25 B: it j- things just got really serious really fast um 

387.06 388.20 A: mhm 

388.71 390.50 B: you know he 

391.63 404.10 B: ah had his own problems and like uh would ju- i mean it was just a really emotional like it was really emotionally draining so we star- stopped seeing i mean you know it was just kind of like we had to be there for each other all the time 

403.49 404.54 A: yeah 

404.05 412.24 B: and then inev- i mean inevitably we just stopped seeing e- you know our friends which was i mean not subconsciously i think it wasn't a conscious decision 

411.78 426.48 A: yeah it it's hard to um avoid getting it i mean it's it's i i'm i know you're right and i can completely understand what you're saying but i think when you first start seeing someone you're so excited that you've met this person whatever you just want to spend all your and then you 

424.04 425.17 B: yeah 

426.25 431.58 A: then you get you've got into that pattern before you even have sort of realized what's going on so 

431.66 442.91 A: yeah that that's an issue that i kind of struggle with um 'cause there is i mean especially right now with it still being relatively new i mean my husband and i our relationship was pretty quick 

443.07 444.25 A: um 

444.47 456.76 A: uh that i'm sort of we're having to sort of negotiate you know what wha- what time we spend with each other and how much separateness we should have and all that kind of stuff and yeah i can 

448.87 450.70 B: mhm 

455.95 462.64 B: mhm mhm i mean since it was you know you that i guess you didn't date for very long or you just got married quickly or 

461.96 468.64 A: uh well we've been together about two years now and we've been married about six months so i mean it's pretty fast moving 

466.70 468.12 B: okay wow 

468.19 477.81 B: so it was it's you're still like are you still learning new things about each other then pretty much i think yeah i think that's pretty important i think that was one of the other things that kind of got 

472.69 474.62 A: oh definitely yeah 

477.88 485.46 B: ah a little stale with my relationship is that like there is nothing else to learn we pretty much knew everything about each other you know 

484.43 485.87 A: oh yeah 

485.63 487.45 B: and it was a little rough 

487.50 489.21 A: yeah no that's 

489.05 502.82 A: uh then i would definitely know that a relationship was well i'd hope i'd recognize it 'cause i also see what you're saying about you know being in the routine of of the comfort of the relationship and stuff but that's what i hoped when i sort of 

502.84 517.49 A: self consciously set out looking was that i'd find someone that i would learn from and that's kind of one of the cool things about he and i having different opinions and stuff because he just makes me look at things [noise] in a different way all the time and learn more about myself and about him you know i look for 

509.25 510.47 B: right 

514.23 515.49 B: right 

516.45 528.14 B: (( no exactly no that's the same same here i mean i like i mean for me i like to have [noise] )) 

523.53 525.76 A: ((  )) 

527.36 528.98 A: ((  )) 

528.04 532.97 B: um i mean something similar enough that we get along but at the same time i you know i like to learn 

532.65 533.52 A: ((  )) 

532.89 542.78 B: about the other person and and in turn learning about that other person i learn about myself as well through that um you know so that's defin- i mean i'm definitely looking for that like 

537.67 539.38 A: yeah yeah definitely 

542.57 548.14 B: diversity there where i mean 'cause i i'm constantly learning and i like to learn new things from other people 

546.65 548.86 A: mhm mhm 

548.11 558.09 B: and i mean this past relationship i had i learned a lot about myself and uh about what i wanted and what i didn't want in a relationship um 

556.27 557.33 A: mhm 

557.45 562.11 A: so you now see you've got a much better a much clearer idea of what you do want in the future uh-huh 

561.46 572.90 B: yeah um i mean you know i'm i'm pretty young and i i realize that i shouldn't i mean i i don't want and i shouldn't be in a relationship that was so serious 

572.52 573.69 A: right 

573.20 582.96 B: you know i need to go out there and explore and it was one of my i mean it was actually my second longest long-term relationship so i haven't really dated much other than that 

580.22 581.13 A: uh-huh 

582.35 583.48 A: right 

583.09 592.26 B: and you know i think it's important to date uh you know a few people before you get into something serious so you know what you're looking for 

589.66 590.81 A: yeah 

591.32 592.36 A: yeah 

592.34 597.16 B: and you know that's that's another thing that i that i learned from this relationship so 

596.40 599.71 A: that's right i just i can't imagine how um
