31.33 34.16 B: yeah okay [mn] so 

34.41 36.50 A: what is it you look for in a life partner 

34.43 35.34 B: (( [noise] )) 

36.41 37.96 B: (( um )) 

39.50 51.65 B: well i'm not very picky but [laughter] what i think a good partner needs to have is uh just uh he needs to be your friend and he 

51.92 56.77 B: he or she should be somebody you can trust you know 

57.42 63.15 B: somebody you can share your feelings or things that are uh 

62.99 63.66 A: (( [laughter] )) 

63.27 73.52 B: happening in your life things you're going through in your life not very personal things but maybe just those general things you usually go through in life you know 

73.52 74.46 A: (( [noise] yes )) 

74.49 76.17 B: and um 

76.71 77.95 B: well 

78.35 79.43 B: um 

79.71 84.92 B: for example i don't like uh people uh who eat with their hands 

84.95 86.98 B: (( so if i )) 

87.07 88.10 B: uh 

88.33 98.35 B: had a partner i'd like him or her not to eat with his or her hands you know it's kind of something that drives me crazy but anyway [laughter] 

88.40 89.58 A: (( um )) 

99.11 111.23 B: additionally that person should be uh open and positive and open to criticism or new ideas and new suggestions thing things that we can try et 

111.28 113.76 B: cetera how about you mhm 

113.29 119.57 A: i i think compatibility is the biggest thing um someone that you can talk to and communicate with 

119.91 124.77 A: and and share similar interests um i don't i don't think you need to be 

125.07 137.65 A: uh completely alike you you need to have some differences so you can so you can talk and have conversations um i i think that the time you spend together needs to be important and and so forth 

134.85 135.98 B: of course 

137.34 145.12 B: mhm yeah of course differences is what uh makes us unique and that's important of course so 

145.37 159.32 B: yeah so a partner doesn't have to be just like you are in the whole sense of the word but uh yeah of course differences are important as well because that's in my opinion that is what keeps you united in some way you know 

159.32 160.81 A: [noise] i agree 

160.24 172.96 B: yeah good [laughter] okay yeah and uh well um additionally i must say that a partner needs to be generous as well 

161.95 163.14 A: [laughter] 

173.08 181.45 B: so he or she should share not only his time as you or her time as you say but on the but also um 

177.12 177.87 A: [noise] 

181.32 181.97 A: [noise] 

182.01 191.59 B: maybe some of the things or the important things that you can share together like a time or or maybe your money or maybe i 

191.73 194.96 B: don't know whatever you know whatever that can be shared 

194.99 196.26 A: right 

195.68 202.85 B: mhm and uh well that's that's my kind of my general opinion about a a partner 

203.45 205.79 A: mine as well are are you married 

205.22 212.20 B: yeah i'm married and uh i have a wife and two children and they are eight and six years old are you married too 

209.11 209.94 A: okay 

212.09 216.11 A: i'm married yes i have one one boy he's thirteen years old 

215.44 218.29 B: thirteen years old okay that's good 

216.85 217.94 A: yeah 

218.53 219.65 B: yeah 

218.69 222.11 A: so i think we both know what we're talking about having uh 

222.76 224.87 A: having both having a life partner so 

224.78 226.48 B: yeah anyway 

226.56 236.21 B: but um i must say that i love my wife very much even though we are very different so the beginning when we we first uh got married 

236.34 244.23 B: uh i didn't like her just opening the the toothpaste tube and and she didn't 

244.36 252.88 B: she didn't close it and that drove me crazy then i learnt with her some patience and some time that that 

252.90 260.55 B: that i that i could overcome that and it's gone away so i'm happier now [laughter] but anyway 

259.54 267.93 A: yeah and i think i think it it's part of having a life partner as well one of the things that you do have to invest is time because there are little things which are going to 

268.34 276.09 A: irritate you and bother you but i think as as you spend time together you learn about it and you learn to deal with it and realize how that sometimes 

269.96 270.91 B: uh-huh 

275.91 289.03 A: it may not be as important as you thought it was in the beginning like what you say with the toothpaste yes it it bothered you but i think you probably got used to it and now you understand her she she got used to it and realized it bothered you and and decided to change it 

282.16 283.05 B: yeah 

283.74 284.51 B: yeah 

286.61 287.63 B: uh-huh 

288.58 295.83 B: that's right that's right yeah yeah suddenly i realized that there were more important things than just the toothpaste you know 

295.42 296.95 A: [noise] correct yeah 

295.89 298.92 B: so we concentrated on working together uh 

298.93 301.94 B: (( to uh build up our family and to )) 

300.99 301.84 A: (( [noise] )) 

302.07 310.54 B: go out more often and to serve in our community serve in the church and uh just doing things together and that 

310.28 310.96 A: (( [noise] )) 

310.81 314.45 B: little thing that trait that she had was just 

314.51 317.09 B: it was not important any more you know 

316.87 318.11 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

317.72 331.80 B: but uh yeah it w- it it i've had a great life with her and so i'm i'm very happy now happily married uh fortunately [laughter] yeah and these two kids of ours they are just great 

326.85 328.03 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

331.76 339.88 B: we came to the united states like uh nine months ago to go to b._y._u. to the university and they are having a great time we are yeah 

339.15 341.34 A: [noise] are your are your whole family from peru 

341.06 343.48 B: yeah my wife and our two kids 

343.44 346.38 A: uh okay so you didn't meet her here you met back in 

346.46 347.37 B: uh-huh 

346.50 347.53 A: in peru 

347.41 357.05 B: yeah i met her in peru and we got married in peru and then we came here i'd i'd worked for some years before i came here before we came here so 

357.01 358.39 A: (( oh okay )) 

357.42 363.03 B: yeah and this uh opportunity of being in this country has helped us to 

363.15 370.02 B: become more friends one to each other and to maintain a family um 

366.79 367.47 A: (( [noise] )) 

370.22 372.41 B: how they say that a family uh 

373.04 384.63 B: unit you know we are more united now uh trusting each other talking more to each other spending time more with each other which is very important for us as well 

383.94 395.11 A: [noise] [noise] right i i think that's one thing coming from a- another country not knowing anybody coming in it it almost forces you to to spend time with your family and and grow that way [noise] 

394.46 398.54 B: uh-huh of course uh our staying here has um 

398.73 401.24 B: we we have faced some um 

402.01 413.85 B: um tribulation we can call it or something like that some problems like just settling problems you know coming to a new country where the language is different the food is different 

409.97 410.66 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

414.06 425.06 B: the people are different you know the culture generally speaking is different so at the beginning we were kind of just uh going here or going there or a kind of a 

426.39 439.58 B: you know know what i mean so but as the time passed so we learned how to deal with those small aspects of our life and we concentrated on being together more time 

427.29 428.24 A: right 

435.17 436.14 A: (( [noise] [noise] ))
