70.74 71.64 A: (( [cough] )) 

77.03 78.05 A: uh-huh 

77.15 80.05 B: um and i would say [sigh] 

81.15 83.74 B: patience kindness 

84.22 88.59 B: um having similar interests and 

88.80 93.13 B: um of course belief outlooks on life 

93.16 94.51 B: and i think a similar 

94.58 97.15 B: [lipsmack] just a mindset about things 

97.38 98.49 A: mhm 

98.93 100.06 B: and 

99.35 104.06 A: well you know sometimes things can be a complement and sometimes they can be an irritation 

104.77 106.08 A: you know it's 

104.88 110.77 B: oh all right that's well that's the one of the downsides i guess of living with somebody 'cause um 

110.88 111.72 B: i've 

112.49 113.34 B: (( well [lipsmack] )) 

113.50 122.87 B: not uh lived with a person as a you know a a romantic partner for quite a while and so it's i just i've gotten used to um 

122.87 129.13 B: i guess my freedom being able to do what i want when i want and sort of when you live with somebody or have a partner 

126.21 127.29 A: right 

129.32 137.14 B: um i mean a romantic partner partner then you have to like compromise and really with roommates too but um [lipsmack] you know you just have to compromise 

137.11 148.88 A: but if you and your uh life partner had the same um mindset the same [cough] you know the looking f- for the same thing together then it's not that much of a conflict as it is 

149.23 151.55 A: if you're not in agreeance on things 

152.02 158.37 B: [lipsmack] right well i think that people are just so different that there's always always there are always going to be s- some things 

158.38 167.90 B: even if you love a person a lot and you have a lot in comm- in common with them there's going to be little things about them little quirks eccentricity that's going to maybe like irritate you but you learn to live with those things 

158.60 159.66 A: mhm 

167.82 178.26 A: well i i read a article a long time ago that said that the difference between people that had been married for forty plus years that [cough] still had a twinkle in the eye and still held hands and the people that had been married for o- 

178.33 181.78 A: over forty years that had you know hall sex which 

181.84 185.08 A: mean they glare at each other and say dirty words you know [laughter] 

184.25 185.37 B: mhm 

185.22 190.93 A: was the uh fact that whenever the your partner had something that irritated you 

191.30 196.92 A: instead of letting become an irritation they let it become kind of a family joke kind of a bit of humour 

193.40 194.55 B: they vent it 

197.00 202.34 B: right oh yeah i bet i mean and also just i guess letting it out not 

202.80 205.28 B: letting it fester [laughter] 

204.62 211.89 A: yeah i think something very important to me is is someone that's o- open minded i don't mean open minded like they want to go out and be a swinger 

211.47 212.74 B: right 

212.07 216.09 A: but open minded as in interested in in 

216.10 229.34 A: what you think and and what you're interested in a lot of people my age you bump into and they're no longer interested in what anybody thinks but theirselves and they're really not open minded to and they make quick judgments 

229.38 230.44 B: right 

229.56 232.71 A: i have a hard time finding someone that i'm interested in because a 

233.64 237.70 A: lot of men are not interested in what i'm interested in and they think it's foolish 

238.01 242.13 A: 'cause i'm interested in health and nutrition and living a long life and a 

242.22 243.36 A: healthy 

243.15 246.88 B: oh that's not foolish it's very in- uh you know that's very smart 

246.92 249.97 A: em yeah but you know like you know if you say to a man 

248.60 250.32 B: why do they think it's foolish 

250.87 261.29 A: hi why don't you just like me the way i am there's nothing wrong with me you know well have you thought about using sunscreen oh i don't like to put stuff on my skin oh i don't see any reason for it you know 

254.74 255.78 B: mhm 

260.91 269.51 B: but do you think that you try to change them or are you just trying to be offering some helpful advice and if they decline it that's like their business you know what i mean it's like if they well that's they would 

268.94 275.87 A: well i'm at i'm i'm at the point that if they're not interested in that i know i'm just going to be an irritation to him because i know how i am 

270.99 272.05 B: (( [laughter] )) 

275.47 278.52 B: right right you're trying to improve him yeah 

276.22 277.85 A: (( you know and i'm i'm going to )) 

278.30 287.67 A: yeah i'm going to be saying uh how about some vitamin how about taking some vitamin c or how about we go get some fresh air or you know how about we go do this or that and they're going to go no no no you know

291.15 292.56 B: (( right hm )) 

293.01 294.17 B: um 

294.25 303.07 B: is that the problem if if you don't mind me asking um what were some of the problems you encountered in your past experience with your relationships or relationship 

297.52 298.29 A: mhm 

303.14 312.18 A: well my husband of twenty years we got along great and we were in love and it was a you know it was like a soulmate thing and we had a lot of the same interests and the things that 

312.22 316.37 A: were interest- in and together we took the time to pay interest 

316.40 322.80 A: you know into it you know to kind of honor the other person like he likes sport i didn't care for it but i'd watch it with him 

323.19 331.74 A: not all the time and we did our own things and we did things together but we just had a lot of problems with the children and the economy and money and it just you know 

331.68 332.64 B: right 

332.15 336.06 A: it it got to be where we were fussing all the time but that uh 

334.97 342.27 B: that's one of the major they said one or two reasons that people basically break off or whatever is because over money mhm

472.81 483.53 A: and you know no questions asked i'm happy so if i'm happy you're happy so everything's fine you know and i'm very inquisitive and outgoing and that didn't work for me it just drove me nuts 

483.97 490.19 B: mhm you mean was he was he a kind of um [lipsmack] like stay at home type or couch potato or 

484.76 485.58 A: so

496.73 497.71 B: right 

496.74 508.91 A: he was just very very boring and and just a great guy though i mean a very great guy he did nothing wrong so he couldn't see any reason why he should investigate or change anything about him because he didn't do anything wrong 

500.76 501.61 B: (( right mhm )) 

508.92 509.89 B: right

520.60 521.61 A: (( you know )) 

521.89 529.12 A: but i think most important thing i think is to find a soulmate someone who you c- 

527.88 529.57 B: how do you feel about 

530.81 531.86 B: um 

532.86 547.03 B: let's say i'm just i'm just curious the gender of the person that's your soulmate do you think it's okay for a person whoever that soulmate is you know or do y- are you just like um strictly like okay i think men should be with women and women should be with men like that 

546.40 548.58 A: well i'm heterosexual 

548.15 549.23 B: right 

548.62 551.55 A: you know but um i think 

552.33 554.22 A: [lipsmack] i think that 

552.72 555.58 B: do you think that do you think that um the 

557.35 564.86 B: ultimate the the spiritual connection that you have a person with sort of in the companionship the importance of companionship kind of trumps 

564.96 566.76 B: like whether they have 

565.29 568.22 A: well i have some gay friends that have been together for 

568.26 569.06 B: right

579.58 583.08 A: they're good people they don't hurt anyone they they have a 

583.27 587.28 A: you know a relationship that's you know between just them 

586.95 588.19 B: respectful 

587.58 596.08 A: i i think my biggest pro- my biggest problem with gay relationships is that i think that when they're not in a committed relationship that they're a lot more um 

595.15 596.83 B: promiscuous or something
