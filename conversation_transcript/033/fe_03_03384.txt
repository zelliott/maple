219.78 220.82 B: (( oh )) 

220.97 231.33 A: i don't know if you noticed that when you first got together you know got married you were together for a while but when you got married all of a sudden i don't know everybody came out from the woodworks [laughter] 

224.78 225.72 B: mhm 

231.31 232.68 B: [laughter] 

231.63 233.37 A: (( you didn't have that )) 

232.79 233.93 B: [sigh] um

235.97 237.47 A: (( oh you were lucky )) 

238.80 248.87 A: oh you're lucky because a lot of people including myself [sigh] had the same thing and you know it's like [sigh] they ne- well [mn] while you were single they didn't want nothing to do with you 

248.54 249.49 B: right 

248.91 254.12 A: but the minute you were in- involved all said oh wait a minute i want you [laughter] 

253.37 255.38 B: right right right they 

254.48 256.68 A: you know and you know it's [sigh] fake 

257.10 265.95 A: it's just a uh a notch in the belt or or [sigh] uh just to say that they [sigh] they're going after something that's not theirs 

265.41 268.37 B: [mn] exactly something that's unattainable 

267.80 270.08 A: yeah exactly [mn] 

268.83 273.71 B: if it's [mn] if it's readily available then it's not [mn] it's too easy 

273.41 274.14 A: (( exa- )) 

273.79 275.03 B: [laughter] 

274.43 283.66 A: exactly and one of the things too i was i was uh one of my markers i was looking for a life partner is someone who when who'd be fidel- 

284.50 285.49 B: right 

284.93 287.13 A: okay uh that wouldn't cheat 

286.99 288.21 B: absolutely 

287.66 302.20 A: because i mean that's the [sigh] that's the core of it [sigh] but i'm looking out uh i was looking around and you know like you could see in advance that no they're not going to you know they may be uh for a while but they will not be for a lifetime 

290.45 291.68 B: absolutely 

301.94 302.95 B: right 

302.38 307.95 A: and it's really really hard to [sigh] to thin through the the smokescreens 

307.61 308.85 B: mhm 

308.24 316.45 A: you know like i said i got burnt first time round she had me hook line sinker i didn't see it coming [laughter] but i was young i was twenty two so [sigh] 

314.01 315.36 B: (( [mn] let me ask you )) 

316.45 324.81 B: let me ask you at what point in your r- relationship with your current wife did you realize that [sigh] this is the one this is the lady i have to be with 

324.89 326.16 A: uh 

326.41 339.77 A: [laughter] oh jeeze the first night i met her [laughter] she was still married then too and i'm going oh no [sigh] you know because my rule is i never mess around with another man's woman because if if she'll if i can mess with her then she's going to mess with somebody else 

328.15 330.19 B: [laughter] but 

335.09 336.29 B: right 

339.80 341.73 B: th- [mn] that's a very good point a 

341.20 347.57 A: right [laughter] so [laughter] [laughter] i'm turning around i'm going oh i'm in a dilemma here [laughter] develop 

341.98 343.33 B: very good point 

346.59 355.31 B: you know actually uh in a way that kind of probably took some pressure off you 'cause you you you it afforded you the opportunity to develop a genuine friendship 

353.50 355.93 A: a friendship true enough 

355.35 358.20 B: without the pressures of you know 

358.20 363.95 A: [sigh] yeah 'cause i even babysat for uh her and her hus- her uh husband [sigh] try to get their marriage back together 

363.55 364.77 B: mhm 

364.22 367.18 A: so that you know because i just wanted to see her happy 

367.05 368.34 B: (( right right )) 

367.76 370.90 A: and uh oh yeah it was it was quite uh 

371.07 372.66 A: a test of uh 

373.24 374.36 A: (( [sigh] i don't know [sigh] )) 

375.07 388.02 A: i think it was a test [laughter] of my morale whether i [sigh] i stuck to my morale or not and uh i passed [laughter] but i'm telling you it was hard [sigh] trying to put put my emotions aside and stick to friendship [sigh] 

379.53 380.55 B: right 

382.21 383.59 B: (( well that's sweet )) 

388.74 393.34 A: and uh i but it's uh pays off [laughter] because i'm yeah you know 

391.58 396.51 B: absolutely yeah it sound like you're it sounds like you're in a very happy situation i 

396.48 406.66 B: and uh the best of luck to you that is just wonderful and i i i hope uh that i can be as just as happy and cheerful twenty years from now for for myself 

399.30 401.03 A: yeah thank you 

405.39 409.13 A: oh oh yeah well it it it's up to both of you 

409.44 411.43 A: (( it has to be a two way street )) 

410.91 412.40 B: absolutely i i 

411.99 414.01 A: she's got to want it as much as you do 

413.80 415.30 B: yes yes 

414.80 419.12 A: and uh you guys could work it through you know i mean there's there's [sigh] 

416.88 418.47 B: absolutely 

419.30 423.22 A: there's always trials and tribulation in life but um 

421.39 423.44 B: right right 

423.54 430.21 A: actually the signs of a a strong person is one who can get through the bad times easy times is always easy to get through 

429.86 431.18 B: right [laughter] 

430.57 435.07 A: and if it ain't for the bad times you wouldn't know when you got having a good time [laughter] 

433.73 437.39 B: i you're so right you need something to compare it to 

437.03 438.35 A: exactly [sigh] 

438.36 439.80 A: and um 

439.92 441.86 A: no it's it's um 

442.08 445.81 A: that's what i look for it's it's someone um 

446.17 451.22 A: i'm a strange character i had a tall tall uh order too because i was looking for a woman who was [sigh] 

451.49 452.98 A: very much a woman 

452.88 453.99 B: mhm 

453.42 463.20 A: very much female but also not scared of work like physical work and because i'm i'm into gardening and [sigh] farming and stuff like that so 

456.57 457.36 B: mhm 

457.76 458.95 B: mhm 

462.68 464.41 B: oh do you have a farm 

463.88 471.11 A: uh no [laughter] i'm working on that [laughter] i after raising five kids don't have too much cheese left over [laughter] 

466.05 466.95 B: [laughter] 

470.55 475.06 B: uh uh [sigh] yeah i can appreciate that [laughter] i'm sure it would take a lot of energy 

472.28 478.90 A: [laughter] [sigh] so uh that's why i'm just rebuil- i'm rebuilding you know i mean the kids have all [mn] left the nest now 

478.71 479.54 B: (( mhm )) 

479.26 480.65 A: so uh 

480.73 486.98 A: of they come back they come in in in lots they all get the same idea to come and visit mum and dad at the same time [mn] 

486.39 487.73 B: [laughter] 

486.89 501.54 A: [laughter] [sigh] and they decide to do it this spring and that's when i'm the busiest [laughter] so i'm going like oh no [laughter] i'm happy you come and see me but [laughter] [sigh] oh yeah it's um oh it's it's rewards 

487.84 489.75 B: [laughter] 

497.08 497.93 B: [laughter] 

501.93 503.36 B: that's wonderful 

502.53 503.30 A: (( you know )) 

503.34 504.22 A: (( and i [laughter] )) 

503.49 509.20 B: when i uh first met my wife um i met her at a party while i was in college 

509.09 520.32 B: [sigh] and she ended up [mn] actually dating another friend of mine and [sigh] that that [mn] obviously didn't work out and and you know i i remained friends with her 

520.48 523.23 B: through the years 'cause i just saw her as 

523.42 529.92 B: such a genuine caring warm individual with such a [sigh] just such a decent person 

529.95 535.74 B: and that really appealed to me [sigh] more than anything about her and uh 

535.83 538.36 B: and i'm happy to say that i it 

538.83 542.22 B: is all true [laughter] i've never been disappointed by her 

540.20 543.23 A: yeah good good choice good choice [laughter] [sigh] 

543.24 550.09 A: that's yeah that's [sigh] yeah you see after a while it's hard to um to like people can put a mask on 

547.73 548.40 B: (( [noise] )) 

549.85 550.95 B: (( right [lipsmack] )) 

550.61 555.83 A: but like i say you can paint a tiger any color you want but it's still going to be a tiger underneath 

555.92 557.04 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

556.58 560.25 A: so [laughter] i mean people will go back to their old ways 

561.47 566.54 A: and uh people change but they don't change too far away from 

566.42 567.61 B: their core 

566.64 573.11 A: from their core that's it and like you said you you you saw in your wife that her core was pure 

567.66 569.18 B: (( right right )) 

573.84 575.08 A: and uh that's 

575.28 587.34 A: what what attracted you and that's the same with me i felt that uh laura's core was pure and and true heart which is [sigh] like a rarity today [laughter] you know 

585.83 591.08 B: yes yes especially with more than fifty percent of marriages failing [sigh] 

590.90 599.95 A: yeah yeah and and it's not one's fault more than the other's it's it's both it's it's uh they're caught up in society's um
