5.37 6.40 A: (( the uh )) 

6.63 10.59 A: i thought the topic was going to be easy when they said life partners and then 

10.54 21.71 A: they went and got specific [laughter] so what is the most important thing to look for in a life partner i don't i don't know that i can narrow it down to one single thing 

11.23 13.45 B: [laughter] 

21.97 24.50 B: are you are you married do you have a 

23.67 26.22 A: i am not i'm i'm actually engaged 

26.56 27.78 B: well 

27.88 29.38 B: um

36.93 39.03 B: what we are looking for exactly 

39.58 44.08 A: um the single well the most important thing to look for in a life partner 

44.43 46.22 B: morals ethnics 

46.28 48.45 B: looks [laughter] 

47.88 50.93 A: [laughter] you see there's a ton of 'em um 

51.56 52.48 A: so 

52.45 62.96 B: well having having been through a couple of uh bad relationships and having finally found somebody really fantastic i think probably the most important 

52.60 54.80 A: i i think trust is right up there 

62.94 69.31 B: i i think is is trust and loyalty and um 

69.51 71.81 B: being able to dependability 

72.79 74.84 A: [lipsmack] yeah i think 

74.96 76.09 A: devotion 

76.46 78.27 A: maybe it can all be summed up in 

78.79 82.35 A: in in the devotional part of it i mean um 

82.80 89.98 A: if somebody is devoted to you you you can certainly you have the ability then to trust them you can tell when they're devoted to you 

89.68 91.13 B: absolutely 

90.02 91.81 A: you also know they're gonna be loyal 

92.33 104.57 B: absolutely i had a relative uh to say to me you know if there's anything that you want you want your your husband to adore you from the day he lays eyes on you [laughter] so uh that's that's sort of uh unrealistic uh 

101.16 102.27 A: [laughter] 

104.85 107.90 B: across the years but uh let's hope 

108.39 110.94 B: for the most part that's the case anyway 

111.24 112.69 A: now are you married 

112.45 113.43 B: i am 

113.53 122.18 A: [noise] i um i've i've been engaged a couple of times so yeah i've i've been down the path to knowing what i don't want and and basically 

122.29 124.32 A: the reasons i didn't get married were 

124.63 126.27 A: (( [mn] trust issues )) 

126.66 128.54 A: you know if you can't trust somebody 

128.69 132.15 A: with with something as you know simple as 

132.22 133.75 A: doing day to day things 

133.71 134.27 B: (( [noise] )) 

134.33 137.61 A: um counting on them to come home at a certain time to 

137.73 148.13 A: to help you with dinner or to go grocery shopping or you know whatever the case may be whatever the prior commitment was you should be able to count on somebody and to have 'em 

142.52 143.55 B: right 

149.07 151.34 A: be able to depend on you as well 

151.09 156.62 B: mutual respect if a real big big factor in in a happy relationship 

156.87 159.71 A: yeah yeah and i think 

159.80 162.55 A: that what you were saying about uh 

162.82 167.81 A: um having somebody adore you of course that's that's what we want um 

168.56 173.87 A: sometimes sometimes you have to let somebody get to know you a little bit more before they can 

173.89 174.94 A: adore you 

175.42 176.43 A: all of your 

175.45 179.81 B: well hopefully hopefully you do that before ya ya tie the knot or 

180.38 188.18 B: become committed in in that kind of a a relationship regardless of what type of relationship it is 

188.70 191.38 A: yeah yeah and i think um 

191.48 194.61 A: i think a lotta people especially today's young um 

194.75 199.73 A: tend to jump into things and i think a lotta times they're trying to jump out of something 

199.71 203.68 B: [mn] i'm not so sure it's just today's young i i know that i did that 

199.83 201.21 A: (( you know running from )) 

203.65 204.71 A: yeah 

204.14 205.34 B: [laughter] 

204.77 210.54 A: yeah [laughter] i don't know i didn't really i don't remember really jumping into anything when i was 

210.71 213.79 A: when i was younger and i'm in my thirties now 

214.11 215.34 A: i remember 

215.59 216.64 A: they say 

217.25 221.41 A: what was it i was just saw something on t. v. about life partners the other day um 

222.01 225.02 A: and it was it was excellent oprah after hours 

224.75 225.62 B: uh-huh 

225.18 227.41 A: after the show um 

227.69 229.76 A: one of her guests said that 

229.99 233.21 A: the harder a person falls the quicker they fall 

233.59 234.58 A: (( the )) 

234.78 238.61 A: the more they're they're they're looking for the more they need 

238.73 241.59 B: oh absolutely i agree with that 

240.95 244.64 A: yeah and i hadn't really looked at that way and you think 

244.71 251.27 A: yeah i think i remember you know falling head over heels a lot easier earlier on in life 

251.47 254.75 A: and as you get earlier you you tend to just lay back and 

255.12 256.84 A: wait for that right person 

257.77 261.84 B: [mn] i it's a measure of maturity i suppose um 

263.74 266.58 B: liking oneself better 

266.64 268.82 B: not being so needy 

268.83 269.90 A: mhm 

269.26 272.95 B: we tend to be more willing to to wait 

273.32 275.63 B: and not 

275.86 278.79 B: give in to the first thing [noise] that comes along 

279.10 280.61 B: tend to wait for 

280.83 283.20 B: things that are more important to us 

283.84 285.74 B: in a relationship i i think 

283.94 284.86 A: yeah 

286.31 288.26 B: younger people don't 

288.99 292.04 B: their their hormones are in high gear and they don't 

292.18 293.44 B: really 

292.19 293.13 A: yeah 

293.70 297.61 B: take the time to know what's underneath the physical 

297.95 302.32 A: they crumble for the chemistry i mean that that would've been me at the age 

300.05 301.30 B: [laughter] 

301.66 306.40 B: and there's nothing wrong with the chemistry part of it either but i mean i think you know what i mean 

303.36 303.94 A: (( of )) 

306.15 312.52 A: yeah well it needs to be there you know you do have there has to be chemistry there i think um otherwise you 

312.80 314.55 A: you just have a kind of um 

315.35 318.15 A: lopsided relationship um 

318.48 322.09 A: is my perspective anyway but i think um 

322.34 336.80 A: when you grow older you tend to you don't cave in to your your your urges as much and you just tend to sit back and and really analyze and look at at a person and say is this a person that's going to be good to me for the rest of my life 

337.58 342.84 A: um i know my current fiance and i didn't start out on great ground but neither one of us 

343.03 345.65 A: we weren't really looking for a relationship so 

345.85 358.63 A: we we dated casually for a long time [laughter] and then we kind of realized gee we're starting to want to spend a whole lot more time with just each other and it got to the point of it being exclusive and and 

358.01 361.97 B: how long was how long have you been together now that you've been en- 

361.07 362.54 A: three and a half years 

363.09 364.91 B: and how long have you been engaged 

365.34 368.39 A: um been engaged about eleven months 

368.84 370.38 A: we're looking at a um 

370.79 376.02 A: um two thousand and four maybe august august i think wedding 

376.11 383.82 A: haven't really set down the specifics um for the last seven months he's been um overseas he he was deployed 

382.92 384.17 B: oh 

385.10 386.64 A: it's kinda hard to 

386.51 388.59 B: do you wanna get married sooner now 

388.79 389.55 A: um 

390.78 392.86 B: is he on his way back or 

391.21 392.21 A: (( no )) 

392.47 396.98 A: he he actually is i just gotta call from him the other day and he said that 

397.19 398.13 A: um 

398.24 403.47 A: he didn't actually tell me where he was and i'm not sure if he can yet he's special ops he's reconnaissance 

403.56 407.36 A: um so i've not known in all this time where he is 

407.49 408.44 A: um 

408.69 415.78 A: so and it's he doesn't call or or write he hasn't throughout this because he doesn't want me waiting for letters 

416.08 423.33 A: you know and then when it doesn't come at the right time or he doesn't call at the right time and then i get all the the rotten thoughts in my head and you know expect the worst 

424.13 424.93 A: (( so )) 

424.66 429.04 B: what do ya think is the most important trait that drew you to him 

429.19 430.17 A: well 

430.75 433.17 A: i think being drawn to him 

433.72 436.54 A: was chemistry but he had um [lipsmack] 

437.61 438.76 A: he has this 

439.30 446.66 A: sweetness he's he's got a baby face but it's it's more than that there's um a sweetness behind 

447.08 449.85 A: behind the eyes you know um 

449.88 458.18 A: like he's he's got a mask hiding it but it's there and it's it was so obvious that you know just he wanted yeah 

455.80 457.32 B: like an innocence 

458.44 460.38 A: yeah or or 

461.90 464.23 A: yes uh some of kinda hold 

464.41 466.17 A: on the the innocence 

466.38 467.06 B: (( [laughter] )) 

467.03 471.95 A: [laughter] he's been he's been in the service before so you know i mean so the innocence is pretty much 

472.42 476.32 A: gone um he's thirty two at this point so 

476.35 477.71 A: (( he )) 

478.04 485.11 A: it's not that the innocence was there but there was a a longing for it and a missing it and and an appreciation for the importance 

485.45 486.91 A: (( of innocence )) 

487.07 489.44 A: so it was nice to see there was um 

489.76 492.54 A: there was a mystique you know i wanted to know more 

492.42 493.70 B: [noise] 

492.67 496.61 A: there was something in the back side that that just drew me to him [lipsmack] 

497.08 506.25 A: and um and it still does now that i've you know uncovered all his um you know skeletons in the closest and i know now what i was seeing 

506.27 512.39 A: but i think that that depth drew me to him initially 

513.19 514.94 A: and now that he's been gone 

515.06 520.63 A: [laughter] uh you know i knew i would miss him because i love him i mean that's a given but 

520.94 525.38 A: i didn't realize he had done around the house how helpful he was 

525.86 533.84 A: i could count on him and out of three loads of laundry i could count on him to at least start one [laughter] or to put one away 

531.70 533.17 B: (( well that's nice )) 

534.16 534.97 A: (( um )) 

534.32 541.65 B: i'm sure after all this time you guys have probably been through some ups and downs we all go through ups and downs did you ever have to sit down and actually 

542.58 548.62 B: remind yourself do that uh column down the middle the good the good things and the bad things 

548.42 550.96 A: yeah yeah um 

551.12 561.37 A: have definitely and and i found that you can't do that in anger you need to even though you know you think that's a good thing maybe it'll take the anger away it doesn't because when you're angry 

560.46 562.44 B: you can't be very objective [laughter] 

562.16 564.44 A: [laughter] you can't think of any good things 

565.79 572.66 A: um at least i can't my my anger would so i would have to meditate or or go away and and just 

572.69 575.43 A: be quiet by myself and calm 

575.47 578.78 A: um and another thing that's great in in 

579.44 582.89 A: looking for something in a life partner is somebody who is willing to accept you 

583.19 585.87 A: what you do that they don't necessarily do 

585.91 587.63 A: like he doesn't meditate 

587.67 590.08 B: acceptance is really important 

590.07 591.24 A: yeah 

590.15 596.80 B: i i agree one hundred percent because um i'm more into spiritual things too than my husband and 

597.04 599.95 B: i hear so so many people
