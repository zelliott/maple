0.67 1.90 A: hello 

1.28 2.63 B: hi 

2.55 4.50 A: hi my name is joan 

4.61 6.96 B: hi i'm karen i'm in texas 

7.15 8.88 A: hi i'm in illinois 

8.74 9.88 B: okay 

10.21 11.26 B: um 

12.14 16.35 B: so what was the topic the most important thing to look for in a life partner 

16.22 17.16 A: yes 

17.60 19.40 A: yes i'm thinking [laughter] 

18.07 19.00 B: you wanna 

19.73 21.07 B: you wanna start 

19.80 21.03 A: it doesn't matter 

21.17 23.21 B: you wanna start with something [laughter] 

23.59 32.56 A: um i mean i guess what you know to look for someone you know that you really you know you have to be friends first i mean so that 

31.23 32.55 B: mm i agree 

32.95 35.67 A: i mean 'cause you have to be able to you know 

36.08 39.29 A: talk about anything and everything and and just 

39.47 45.33 A: be able to work through you know whether it be h- hard times or you know good times bad times everything 

45.43 47.24 A: but if you can't do that 

47.33 48.34 A: you know 

49.43 56.86 A: there's no sense in you know i mean i don't wanna say no sense in staying around but that's i think that that would be the most important thing is to be able to talk about things 

56.71 58.01 B: i agree 

57.62 59.21 A: and work things out 

59.28 60.81 B: right um 

61.13 62.90 B: [noise] i've i've never understood 

63.07 67.12 B: women or or men for that matter that pick their partner based on 

67.39 72.28 B: on just looks i mean i i was never like that even though i'm dating i mean i i figure 

72.46 73.54 B: uh 

73.69 82.30 B: where where does that get you that's not that doesn't make you get along better or doesn't give you support i mean just somebody's looks is 

82.68 84.27 B: you know people that just base 

82.99 84.79 A: oh that's for sure [laughter] 

84.57 85.82 B: [noise] pardon 

85.88 88.05 A: that's for sure yeah 'cause i mean 

86.99 88.09 B: yeah 

88.25 90.90 A: they may have good looks but if they have no 

91.06 95.86 A: you know personality no you know feelings for you 

92.85 98.15 B: and frankly to me humility is a big is is a big um 

98.41 108.30 B: draw someone if somebody has some humility that's much more attractive to me than if they look like brad pitt or something which people that look like that generally aren't um 

108.54 113.92 B: they probably know it [laughter] and and that can make 'em kinda hard to live with i think [sigh] um 

112.84 121.05 A: oh for sure yeah that's what i would think too because if you can't you know you have to feel good about yourself no matter what way you look 

115.77 117.16 B: yeah 

120.67 121.76 B: (( yes )) 

121.37 122.74 A: you know if you look 

122.78 132.87 A: you know if you look good that's one thing but you have to like you said humility where you have to know that you know you're a good person inside and be able to 

126.63 127.75 B: yeah 

130.86 138.48 B: right yeah i i probably said you know said it too strongly i don't mean to imply there's something inherently with someone being 

135.94 137.32 A: (( oh no no i understand )) 

138.74 144.02 B: good looking but um it's it's just that i remember being in high school and seeing people 

142.37 142.93 A: (( [mn] )) 

144.25 148.64 B: just base things entirely on that like the other other girls i knew and 

148.72 156.02 B: it [noise] and then as a lotta women get older they don't ever get over that [laughter] you know like it's just a matter of how somebody looks on their own or something 

156.27 158.25 A: right right 

156.74 157.75 B: but um yeah 

157.89 160.59 B: i agree that friendship friendship is the 

160.78 163.11 B: is the most important thing and uh in 

163.72 171.09 B: fact i think any time i've heard somebody that they've got a really good marriage if someone asks what their secret is that's that's usually what they say is that 

171.23 172.17 B: um 

172.20 177.23 B: that we're good friends and a lotta times they even just start out as friends before they fall in love and 

175.67 176.77 A: right 

177.40 178.34 B: um 

178.43 182.36 B: so they know each other well and they they can uh support one another mhm 

182.60 184.94 A: right i mean if you could you know 

184.95 186.87 A: know kind of you know if you 

187.23 193.48 A: think about how you are in a situation and what your partner would do or they would even react 

193.53 196.74 A: then you know that person very well and 

196.79 200.95 A: then you should know that you should you know i mean pretty much can stay together 

198.04 199.06 B: [noise] 

200.73 201.66 B: yeah 

201.56 204.06 A: if if that makes sense [laughter] 

203.40 205.64 B: (( yeah and um )) 

207.15 208.11 B: uh 

208.32 213.20 B: i don't know how you describe this but i think something else that kinda goes along with that is um 

213.76 215.81 B: kind of about valuing the same 

216.10 218.28 B: the same things and uh 

218.75 224.90 B: like if if one of you is a very spiritual person and the other one is not that could be a problem 

224.94 225.89 A: right 

225.05 227.74 B: they can't they can't really understand you that well 

228.78 232.86 B: you know some things some things it doesn't matter so much things that are kinda 

233.92 247.05 B: more superficial then that can just make it interesting if you have different things that you're into or whatever but some things are so so basic that if somebody doesn't share it with you then you're you're not on the same wavelength basically i think 

246.34 247.39 A: right 

247.18 248.80 B: [noise] 

247.59 253.94 A: yeah because if if somebody's so so into one thing and you don't like that at all 

254.19 256.71 A: you know it's hard to you know 

256.86 265.02 A: be with that person all the time if that 'cause like if they talk about it all the time or they wanna do something all the time you know you have to you know at least like it 

260.83 264.08 B: yeah yeah 

265.22 268.70 A: to the point of where you would do it with that person 

268.54 269.64 B: right 

269.34 272.61 A: you know so i mean if someone likes racing say you know 

272.69 275.36 A: and but you didn't 

275.80 281.31 A: well you'd have you know you'd wanna like it at least a little bit so that you could spend time together and things like that 

280.62 281.76 B: yeah 

282.30 284.19 A: you know that would make sense 

285.12 290.22 A: that i mean that's like i said yeah the first thing i would think about is you know 

290.74 293.98 A: being able to just talk about anything and and 

294.00 303.68 A: you know understand you know what each person is saying and where they're coming from so to speak to you know to be able to get along together and 

299.56 300.63 B: right 

303.00 305.61 B: [noise] yeah yeah 

304.14 307.05 A: that would be a a good relationship so 

307.03 311.82 B: yeah and good friends usually respect each other so it um 

310.16 311.00 A: right 

313.15 316.18 A: yeah 'cause even if you didn't like something that they want 

316.32 324.24 A: you have enough respect to say well i understand that i may not like it but i'm not gonna tell you to to not do that or 

324.08 329.13 B: right or you're you're silly for liking that or whatever yeah [laughter] 

324.59 326.51 A: you know not go along with it 

327.70 332.56 A: right right 'cause that's what you'd have to do is be able to respect what they're feeling 

332.88 333.76 A: (( you know )) 

334.21 335.90 A: about everything so 

336.38 337.40 A: (( but you know )) 

336.72 337.83 B: yeah 

338.51 344.40 A: relationships are you know based on different things but that's what i would do you know 

344.14 347.07 B: yeah if you could just pick one thing that would be it for me too 

347.01 348.03 A: yeah 

348.90 351.49 A: so i mean are you married or are you 

352.36 353.34 A: (( you're not at all )) 

353.37 355.37 B: yeah i'm married and my 

355.88 359.76 B: four year old special needs girl hanging on me 

359.63 361.39 A: [laughter] that's okay 

359.88 360.93 B: (( in here )) 

361.05 362.36 B: [laughter] 

361.91 365.74 A: yeah so i mean you you know being in a relationship like you know 

366.22 369.83 A: you know you have to be able to get along and you know 

369.89 376.92 A: a marriage is you know being able to work together and you know you saying you've got a special needs child i can imagine 

377.10 381.56 A: what you would have to go through for all that and you know you have to work together 

381.94 382.94 B: right 

381.96 385.51 A: i mean i would you know it's i imagine that would be a 

383.85 387.64 B: theoretically anyway [laughter] you know what i mean 

385.54 388.85 A: [laughter] i mean i imagine that would be real you know 

389.06 392.37 A: to be able to work together on things like that that would be 

392.43 399.14 A: something really good in a relationship you know instead of just saying oh you just take care of it you know that's your job 

395.47 396.70 B: yeah 

399.18 405.41 A: you know you'd wanna be able to work together and okay i do it this day you do it you know or something like that 

399.89 402.43 B: mhm [laughter] 

404.90 406.55 B: right right 

406.03 407.61 A: that would be a you know 

407.61 410.42 B: that kinda like like dividing up um 

410.64 414.03 B: what needs to be done um um 

412.73 413.82 A: right 

414.93 417.53 B: good friends can be more um 

418.44 420.94 B: kinda easy going about that about you 

421.04 422.93 B: know just seem like it seems like the whole 

423.47 424.32 B: um 

424.58 427.63 B: well the whole kinda everything that goes along with being 

427.82 431.49 B: good close friends um just makes it easier to com- 

431.85 433.83 B: communication is easy and 

433.87 435.76 B: and um it's just like 

436.30 437.22 B: um 

437.28 441.15 B: that would kinda go along with dividing up chores and everything too 

441.14 442.31 A: (( right right )) 

442.92 448.27 A: well i know i know that feeling i know that [laughter] to be able to you know to say well

459.15 460.28 B: mhm 

459.94 464.41 A: we kinda drifted apart and then kind of came back together so it's kind of 

463.37 464.85 B: mhm 

464.54 465.46 A: you know 

465.60 471.43 A: when you stay with somebody you you knew of somebody for so long but i've only been married for this long or you know people look at you like
