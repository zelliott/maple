51.67 54.63 B: that's great and what's the topic today

61.55 65.64 B: oh okay well what do you have to say about that [mn] 

65.38 68.97 A: i don't know i'm sitting here wracking my brain and i 

70.43 74.39 A: uh i mean there are a lot of important things but i can't think of i 

74.72 75.81 B: (( [sigh] )) 

75.29 76.06 A: (( can't ow )) 

76.38 81.81 B: they want to know what are some important characteristics to choose a life partner is that it 

82.04 85.08 A: yeah th- well they said what's the most important 

84.51 86.09 B: oh the most important 

86.14 87.25 A: yeah 

86.19 98.17 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] oh gosh well i think that trust i don't know if the most important or not but certainly you have to have [sigh] well a person has to have integrity that's very important 

96.86 99.85 A: yeah yeah yeah i definitely agree with you there 

99.44 102.28 B: and if you go from that 

102.37 104.98 B: sense of integrity then you're looking 

105.09 108.15 B: at a person that you're going to be able to trust 

108.06 109.06 A: mhm 

108.41 113.32 B: [lipsmack] fidelity certainly a sense of commitment to what 

114.66 118.01 B: they're choosing and um 

118.85 121.75 B: [lipsmack] i i think that um 

122.51 129.30 B: that to be aware of that at least as far as they can at whatever age there's no way they can know what's down the line 

129.37 136.78 B: and so on but when they make those vows of [mn] better and worse that's gotta be involved in that 

136.42 140.32 A: yeah i definitely agree with that um 

140.47 144.73 A: i i don't think that i could ever be with somebody that i couldn't trust with everything 

144.51 157.54 B: [lipsmack] well i i think that's what when there's any kind of a suspicion or any element of distrust then you c- then things begin to 

157.49 161.24 B: chip away and and fall apart i'd say at least some weakening 

158.68 159.56 A: yeah 

161.46 163.80 B: is uh present there 

161.59 162.43 A: right 

163.86 165.72 A: yeah 

164.66 166.49 B: 'cause you can never be sure [mn] 

166.89 168.53 A: yeah that's very true 

167.42 171.02 B: no matter what the person would say you couldn't be sure [mn] 

170.41 173.52 A: right and even if it was true you wouldn't know 

173.85 175.72 B: that's right so there's just 

174.28 179.26 A: so and that would be suspicion to call everything they said was a lie you know 

176.43 177.44 B: i mean it 

178.51 193.07 B: right because as as big and as understanding and as hopeful as a person the opposite person might want to be there's just always that element in there 

193.13 194.18 A: right 

193.72 199.70 B: [lipsmack] well you have to start off with a person of integrity or a person that you believe to be one of integrity 

199.87 201.67 B: and um 

201.75 205.68 B: [lipsmack] i think that that shows up in various ways and 

205.98 207.45 B: [lipsmack] um 

208.27 214.56 B: i think as uh people begin to sort out what's what and who's who that becomes very clear 

214.57 218.34 B: that this person is who they claim they are 

214.60 215.57 A: right 

218.54 219.64 A: right 

219.33 221.04 B: and that's what it means to be 

221.07 228.60 B: a person of integrity one who is one that's what it comes from word integer meaning one 

226.82 227.65 A: yeah 

228.98 232.71 B: one in mind and in action and believing in what they 

232.92 236.35 B: who they are and what are and act on that 

236.23 237.22 A: right 

236.69 238.67 B: [lipsmack] but um 

238.68 242.46 B: [lipsmack] that takes a long time to figure all of that out 

242.49 246.14 B: and recognize those virtues in people 

246.84 247.95 A: mhm 

246.89 251.29 B: so that's why it takes a long time to come to that uh 

251.44 254.65 B: idea that you can commit to that person for 

254.92 257.34 B: (( um for the rest of your life )) 

257.94 259.40 A: right 

258.86 260.45 B: (( [lipsmack] but um )) 

260.48 266.50 B: some things are learned as you go along i guess and some people have to learn the hard way 

266.96 269.92 A: yeah [noise] what do you think about um 

270.05 273.36 A: i'm just wondering um if somebody breaks your trust 

272.92 273.97 B: well 

274.35 278.37 B: i think first if they go right off to some kind of counseling 

278.49 279.28 A: yeah 

278.56 279.77 B: they have to be 

279.91 285.11 B: sit down themselves and then recognize that to heal that 

285.13 291.30 B: they need some outside help because there're too many emotions i believe that get in the way of clear thinking 

291.37 299.82 B: and it's not black and white it's not like you forgot to buy the potatoes et cetera you know we're talking something so much deeper 

297.26 298.04 A: right 

299.85 300.72 A: yeah 

299.93 303.68 B: and your emotions are involved in that so i think that you have to get help 

303.74 307.05 B: you have to get somebody that can help clarify your thinking 

307.11 308.93 A: mhm 

309.00 311.45 A: yeah i think i would probably 

310.01 316.06 B: i mean i've known that to be true for a l- for for couples and the counselor has helped 

314.22 314.95 A: (( yes )) 

316.25 320.12 A: mhm yeah i'm a big fan of counseling 

320.31 325.23 A: not that i mean like i- if there's a problem i think that counseling is the way to go 

325.41 333.04 B: [sigh] well it it it's it's the neutral party that's the one that's involved now of course you could go into counseling with a hard heart 

325.72 326.87 A: (( and )) 

333.10 334.77 B: and um 

334.86 337.64 B: kind of determination that um 

337.99 340.46 B: you're not gonna listen you're not gonna hear 

340.48 342.65 B: then nothing will be achieved 

342.68 343.54 B: so 

342.71 345.33 A: right also you got to want it 

344.88 349.21 B: yeah oh they'd have to want it i think and most counselors 

349.57 354.42 B: would say you want to be you have to want to be here 

354.67 355.71 A: right 

354.98 357.48 B: because the healing's not going help i 

357.81 363.66 B: mean you don't go to a doctor and say heal my uh broken ankle 

358.07 358.85 A: well you 

363.70 364.42 A: (( [noise] )) 

364.45 365.54 B: and 

364.54 366.82 A: but i don't want to do anything to heal 

366.05 367.77 B: [laughter] yeah really 

367.77 368.63 A: yeah 

367.78 370.74 B: that doesn't make any sense but there are people like that 

370.81 371.91 A: (( yeah )) 

371.36 372.97 B: unfortunately 

373.32 380.06 B: so uh yeah but i i think that once stung though it's it's it's hard for the other person 

380.44 382.66 A: [noise] right 

381.72 385.80 B: i but i do i guess it can work i guess it can 

386.00 398.25 B: help but um yeah i think that counseling is important those people are trained that's their job to to help sort out one's thinking they don't it's not that they're putting their two cents in they're just taking your thoughts 

391.70 392.84 A: right 

398.21 402.50 B: and sorting them out [mn] in a clear and uh 

399.88 400.99 A: right 

402.66 405.45 B: in a you know smart way 

405.41 406.73 A: mhm 

406.74 407.82 B: (( so um )) 

408.77 416.41 B: well what so is there anything else that you need to add to uh what you look for in a life partner or what's the important thing 

415.88 417.45 A: (( [noise] um )) 

418.01 420.16 B: can you add to that 

419.59 421.01 A: well 

421.96 427.59 A: i i guess a really important thing would be i'm jewish and that i would want my partner to be jewish 

427.00 428.07 B: uh-huh 

427.84 431.94 A: because um i really really want children 

431.69 432.80 B: right 

432.67 434.05 A: and i 

434.10 442.95 A: i i think i'm going to have a hard time explaining to my like children that y- we we have a christmas tree 'cause his mommy wants one 

442.58 443.69 B: yeah 

443.23 447.21 A: but we're not christian and we don't celebrate christmas like 

444.95 445.85 B: right 

446.28 447.14 B: yeah 

447.29 452.68 A: i there there're just values that are very important to me 

451.52 452.47 B: yeah 

452.71 456.47 A: and i think i mean i guess if if the person wasn't christian 

456.53 469.00 A: as long as their values matched up i mean if tha- that person was was christian or not jewish if our values matched up i think that that would be so i guess i'd i'd change that and say that as long as our values were 

458.65 459.21 B: (( mm )) 

460.45 461.40 B: yeah 

461.74 462.91 B: yeah 

468.70 472.42 B: yeah [mn] but i understand completely what you're saying 

472.45 473.23 A: right 

472.51 480.04 B: i'm not jewish but um [lipsmack] i i think it certainly helps 

480.71 484.57 B: if you're of the same faith tradition 

484.58 485.52 A: (( right [noise] )) 

484.98 486.22 B: (( um )) 

487.24 494.65 B: i said that once in a classroom and oh a child who was of mixed parentage one jewish and one christian and 

494.82 502.87 B: they kind of jumped all over me but she was a high school student and they tend to not really appreciate when you say 

502.74 510.59 B: things could be better and they and they but they could be better if you're of the one mind it is not to say that it couldn't work out 

504.86 505.71 A: right 

510.73 516.57 B: and that either party is correct or whatever those things that some people say 

510.84 511.82 A: (( yeah )) 

516.64 519.66 B: but it would makes it easier i think 

519.31 523.03 A: right there are lots of like there're traditions that that would be 

524.08 525.74 A: um difficult 

525.60 526.63 B: mhm 

526.01 526.84 A: to 

527.21 528.20 A: to 

528.29 529.17 A: (( you know )) 

528.35 529.88 B: to blend 

529.59 530.55 A: yeah 

529.94 532.33 B: or to harmonize that's correct 

532.08 539.04 A: we don't eat we don't eat [noise] we don't eat pork but on but on um easter we do like 

534.66 536.06 B: mhm 

538.02 545.61 B: yeah but even even the particular practices but it's the it's the safe element i think that that's um 

545.73 558.58 B: tricky to to to make work well i mean it will work but it's it's smoother it's more if they're speaking the same language if they're understanding where you're coming from 

549.54 551.00 A: (( mm )) 

558.65 559.69 B: (( um )) 

558.70 560.64 A: right that and that's it 

560.05 561.43 B: yeah 

560.97 569.87 A: you have to understand where like my background like i've dated people that weren't jewish and they alw- [noise] because 

565.88 567.03 B: (( mhm )) 

569.92 580.95 A: 'cause my parents in the way that i grew up and was brought up was that you like take care of the small things don't let them build up so there's never a problem to take care of right so every time 

577.22 577.78 B: (( [cough] )) 

578.50 580.04 B: mhm right 

581.04 591.55 A: something came up i brought it up and it was like you know i don't really like this or i think we should have done this differently and and that person thought that i was nitpicking and didn't like 

581.96 582.56 B: (( [cough] [cough] )) 

584.41 585.41 B: mhm 

586.07 587.06 B: yeah 

590.57 592.10 B: (( oh yeah )) 

591.51 597.57 A: anything at all and and in actuality i loved what was going on it's just i didn't want anything to build up 

594.99 595.80 B: mhm 

596.93 598.44 B: that's right 

598.65 599.89 A: (( so the )) 

598.67 599.42 B: (( [mn] ))
