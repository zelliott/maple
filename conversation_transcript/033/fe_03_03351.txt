289.13 290.65 A: but um

326.74 329.21 B: [lipsmack] uh you know i mean 

329.48 338.84 B: just like anybody else you know a house family job you know that is all very necessary and we both agree with that and we both work toward that 

333.68 334.74 A: mhm 

339.27 348.89 B: um but see i was married before and they were people that i really had things in common with so i says okay this time 

348.89 359.24 B: when i get married i'm gonna marry somebody opposite and it's worked fine [laughter] it kinda bummed me out at first i thought gosh what do we talk about [laughter]

375.53 378.91 B: so sorry well hey if you've waited you're lucky 

379.32 382.25 B: because you didn't have to go through all the other stuff

467.85 468.78 B: yeah 

468.65 471.92 A: oh 'cause i assumed the first one was the one that was twenty years 

471.19 473.96 B: no no he was six years

487.27 490.18 B: i'm too stubborn to give up see and then 

490.27 491.12 A: (( [mn] )) 

490.98 492.78 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

492.31 496.82 A: do you think that it's just that because the new the guy that you have now 

497.24 506.28 A: is is has a more mellow personality he seems to have a um a high level of tolerance than than most people 

506.15 508.81 B: he really he he does um 

508.90 513.89 B: when he and i married my kids were uh [lipsmack] eleven and thirteen 

513.69 514.61 A: okay 

514.92 518.43 B: and so i mean he took on a lot he admits 

515.40 516.16 A: did 

517.33 518.24 A: (( did )) 

518.53 519.69 B: huh 

519.51 521.67 A: he have kids had he ever been married

522.97 524.37 A: (( oh okay okay )) 

524.53 530.19 B: and so i mean he didn't even [laughter] you know hadn't even really been around kids a lot 

529.56 531.11 A: okay okay 

530.79 534.90 B: and uh i mean he he took on it like a trooper 

535.27 536.42 A: (( god bless )) 

536.47 537.99 A: [laughter] 

537.40 540.03 B: yeah god was sided on this girl

540.91 542.70 B: (( yep )) 

543.08 548.67 B: so now they're grown and um we got grand kids and 

547.90 550.01 A: great great 

549.42 552.05 B: yeah just 

550.40 552.80 A: and so you didn't have any children by him 

552.70 553.91 B: no 

553.62 555.69 A: late in the game right 

554.93 558.43 B: yeah exactly well i had gotten a hysterectomy 

558.75 564.06 B: prior to or just after he and i had got married because my sister had died of cancer 

564.16 565.71 B: and i didn't want it 

566.01 568.55 B: so i decided to get a hysterectomy 

569.13 570.30 B: and uh 

570.55 572.95 B: so no we never had any kids 

574.64 584.73 B: maybe that's the key [laughter] i don't know no i really i i really feel it's communication though 

581.32 582.06 A: (( okay that's )) 

584.36 587.69 A: i well see i'm not really sure if it's communication 

587.96 597.24 A: i think it's just that he is more tolerant person like every now and then you meet an individual i think it's kinda rare but you know you meet somebody who 

597.45 599.89 A: they don't really care enough to fight about it
