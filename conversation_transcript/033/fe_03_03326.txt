24.99 29.21 B: i guess um i don't know for me i think um 

29.63 33.90 B: [lipsmack] similar uh values would be important 

33.35 34.62 A: right 

34.01 38.94 B: like um values on families um i think it'd be important 

38.98 45.14 B: um that you both have the same wants as far as children or not 

44.75 45.64 A: mhm 

45.67 51.56 B: and maybe uh religious beliefs i think may be important 

50.85 52.23 A: (( [noise] right )) 

51.92 53.05 B: what about you 

52.63 58.31 A: i would say you know you have to have be able to trust each other and you know

57.32 58.84 B: absolutely 

58.46 59.51 A: um 

60.66 63.35 A: faith in each other i guess and then 

63.59 65.57 A: willingness to get along 

65.75 66.77 A: (( i don't know )) 

66.44 71.50 B: do you think that um like common interests is a must or not 

71.61 79.17 A: [noise] you know i think so um to a point i guess you don't want all your interests don't have to be exactly the same i guess but you have to be able to 

79.27 82.19 A: like some of the same things and also um 

82.52 85.17 A: learn to like new things i guess 

85.26 89.41 B: 'cause i just read something i don't know in a magazine and it said that 

89.26 101.89 B: um common interests don't necessarily this person said doesn't even you don't even have to have common interests because if you have too much in common you end up being buddies rather than 

91.38 92.47 A: mhm 

101.65 104.46 A: right things get boring probably [laughter] 

103.84 112.79 B: oh you don't yeah you don't wanna do everything together like my husband golfs and i don't golf but that's kind of his thing to do with his friends and 

108.75 109.68 A: mhm 

112.61 113.78 A: right

118.04 118.95 A: right 

119.97 124.60 B: so we have our time apart which i think is good and then our separate time 

124.63 138.13 A: right that's you know that's good to have you know and um similar interests and yeah i think you up to have the same type of beliefs in how you're going to raise your children of course before you have children it's hard to come up with that [mn] [sigh] 

125.37 126.20 B: (( so )) 

138.11 142.26 A: i know that [laughter] yeah we do we have three children 

138.11 140.26 B: oh i know do you have children 

141.70 146.65 B: yeah we have twins too and it's so funny because like before we had children we'd be like 

146.73 153.80 B: what does that couple thinking bringing those children to a restaurant now we're the people in the restaurant going lighten up 

150.12 151.23 A: (( [mn] yeah ))

159.48 162.56 B: now you know [laughter] 

168.83 179.28 A: yeah [mn] i guess you gotta see you treat 'em differently because you went through it with the older one and you know [laughter] what battle you really wanna fight and what which ones don't really matter as much any more 

174.47 175.33 B: yeah 

179.01 181.75 B: absolutely absolutely 

180.13 183.13 A: (( you know what i mean [laughter] [laughter] ))

189.82 190.68 A: yeah 

191.15 193.30 A: yep they're not all the same 

193.02 194.95 B: they're not all the same 

194.00 195.48 A: (( always different so )) 

195.40 198.07 B: so yeah i think definitely um 

198.21 203.28 B: child raising is an important thing but yeah like you said how do you know until you have children 

203.12 204.47 A: (( right [mn] )) 

203.91 206.97 B: um [sigh] how long have you been married 

206.96 209.58 A: fifteen a little over fifteen years

212.91 216.22 B: we must be doing something right [laughter] 

214.60 225.58 A: yeah well it you know it gets difficult at times but you know yeah it takes work on both pa- on both uh partners [laughter] basically 

220.05 221.07 B: right

228.75 229.95 A: right 

229.24 232.57 B: um i think everything else would you know 

232.57 237.30 A: right which which i mean and the root of all that is good communication 

232.59 233.90 B: be tough 

237.59 238.44 B: right 

238.00 244.88 A: you have to be able to communicate and that's something we've been learning for the last you know for the first 

245.00 248.65 A: seven eight years it b- it was a little difficult and we uh 

249.49 258.52 A: we started we went to this uh marriage conference we go to every year and it's it's m- mostly on communication and that's one thing that just 

258.71 265.70 A: if you can't communicate or be open with your your husband or wife then things just don't go right [sigh] 

265.54 266.53 B: right

305.78 306.98 B: (( [sigh] )) 

306.29 313.49 A: we're up there and we're like it's great to see babies and stuff but i think we we can wait till there's grandchildren because

315.30 316.46 B: freedom

341.51 350.79 A: different things but you you can still trust 'em to stay home for an evening while you go off to dinner or on a date or whatever too so an- and that makes it neat 

351.32 352.55 A: (( [sigh] it )) 

352.49 358.40 B: yeah yeah that that would be n- i'm looking forward to that [laughter]
