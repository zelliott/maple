67.67 68.74 B: so did y- 

69.49 72.60 B: so there you go you can talk a lot about this [laughter] 

71.87 83.68 A: [laughter] well and i've been divorced once so i i know what not to look for [laughter] yeah well i i tell me what what do you think you're looking for 

76.75 78.35 B: wow 

78.51 80.31 B: that's great 

80.32 80.90 B: (( um )) 

84.14 88.95 B: i think compatibility i think respect i think um 

89.04 96.83 B: honesty obviously um those are the things i think that are that are key and i think that when you first meet someone 

96.76 106.15 B: um setting certain ground rules and certain expectations i think women in general have a way of portraying i have a lot of single friends still looking too 

106.09 116.50 B: um and it's funny 'cause i'm actually dating somebody that is divorced with four kids so it's very interesting that i got matched up with you you know because i'm thinking four kids oh my goodness what could i or how could i possibly do that 

106.12 107.03 A: mhm 

111.50 112.58 A: exactly 

116.21 117.29 A: yeah 

116.56 117.69 B: but um 

117.65 132.05 B: but i think that just k- women in general i think have a way of pretending to be who they think they're whoever they're dating wants them to be and then you you know then you get into the situation where they finally figure out who you really are about 

126.79 128.79 A: yeah 

132.18 135.18 B: and uh and it cannot be good 

134.47 147.29 A: i think you're right i think i think i have a daughter and i think one of the things i've really tried to instill in her is to be totally herself and be honest about her expectations 

147.20 160.71 A: um you know this is what i want to do as a career or this is what i want to do here you know if is is this going to fit or not you know let's not get terribly involved if if if we're not matching right now you know yeah 

159.06 161.16 B: right exactly 

160.75 164.76 A: yeah 'cause women are really bad about going well i can fix it you know i 

164.62 177.90 A: i can conform to that or i can i can change him or you know love will conquer all [laughter] and not necessarily [laughter] yeah 

168.87 169.74 B: right 

170.21 171.09 B: (( exa- )) 

171.29 173.42 B: [laughter] 

174.96 183.88 B: no right well we must be we must be doing something wrong right because i think the statistic now is like one out of three marriages 

184.07 193.48 A: well i think i think some of it is and and i realize that our topic is a little off but i think some of that is just simply that we've made it so easy to get out 

184.20 185.66 B: fail so 

193.00 194.87 B: yeah right 

193.44 207.44 A: um you know we're not a we're not a committed society any more we're not you know people that say look i made a vow to this person and need to really think seriously about making that vow before i make it you know yeah 

205.78 214.81 B: right but part of making that vow is the topic um in that making you know making sure that you are picking somebody that is 

210.18 211.18 A: (( yeah )) 

214.86 217.77 B: you know compatible and and and it's going to work 

216.33 225.75 A: yes yes yes and i don't kn- yeah i don't know if it's really a time you know everybody says well you know you should take a year or it should be two years or it should be six months 

225.37 226.22 B: (( mm )) 

225.94 231.07 A: i i think it's a gut feeling i do but you have to discern between lust and love 

228.00 229.05 B: mhm 

230.84 241.38 A: and [laughter] and you have to make sure that those those traits that you just mentioned are there and and i don't know i out of all them if there was one i was i would say respect 

231.48 232.76 B: right 

241.37 242.42 B: right 

242.07 246.92 A: is that just you know i mean it would be hard to pick one because you'd want to lump them together but 

247.13 255.23 A: you know i can love someone who respects me and i can respect someone and hope that that person loves me as well so to me 

255.23 262.42 A: respecting me and what i do or you know my career my choice to be at home my whatever i do 

262.46 266.44 A: if my uh life partner respects me 

267.07 273.02 A: you know what i'm saying that's i think the most important to me after after two marriages basically yeah 

272.39 274.17 B: right right 

273.29 274.13 A: (( yes )) 

274.33 275.31 B: neat 

275.19 284.47 A: yeah i th- so i'm really that's really neat that you brought that up because you're definitely on the right track make sure he respects you and you respect him yeah 

280.64 283.24 B: [laughter] i hope so 

283.22 296.77 B: i hope so yeah i think i think there's definitely going to be differences and i think differences are are a great thing actually because it makes the other person think about you know different things that they've done and and sharing that and um 

284.50 286.08 A: (( yes yeah )) 

289.96 290.99 A: sure 

293.85 294.92 A: sure 

296.52 303.87 A: and got to be openminded but there we're back to respect you need to respect that person's opinion and he re- needs to respect yours 

303.26 304.45 B: right 

304.19 313.26 A: you know yeah it's not a matter of changing someone to believe the way you do it's respecting each other's uh boundaries and and opinions and where you're at with it so 

312.48 319.54 B: and a lot of people don't i think a lot of people do exactly what they you know it should be they want to convince you that their way is the right way 

314.19 314.96 A: no 

315.30 315.93 A: (( uh-uh )) 

319.32 329.20 A: yes yeah you know i think there's that one couple um cargill and what's what is the gal's name anyway he's he's like a democrat she's a republican 

320.27 321.09 B: yeah 

328.78 330.01 B: mhm 

329.13 334.47 A: and they're and they're advisors for these candidates these presidential candidates they're both opposites 

334.41 337.42 A: people are like how in the world do you 

337.23 338.86 B: you can get along 

337.31 349.13 A: do you live but they just made it a pact that they're going to respect each other's differences and they leave that outside uh the door when they come in they they're you know they might discuss one or two things 

348.96 352.73 A: discuss their points of view and then it's over that's the end of it it's not a debate 

352.23 353.44 B: right 

352.91 360.28 A: it's not up for that so i think that's pretty amazing um i think if couples can learn to do that we would see a whole lot less 

360.56 362.38 A: more in the divorce area 

361.85 363.02 B: yeah 

362.44 364.45 A: yeah absolutely 

364.54 366.01 A: so yeah 

364.82 368.50 B: well you can write a book now [laughter] 

366.61 379.61 A: yeah there we go there we go and that is happening for me i do some writing so [laughter] we can just we could just say okay let's take that little survey who which which is the most important trait and give him about five traits 

369.10 373.98 B: you [laughter] you you won't you won't you won't need to stop for the fisher project too so 

379.28 380.50 B: [laughter] 

379.50 390.83 A: see what see what they think it is yeah well i you know that's that's the thing you're looking you're out there in the market and and um i've been out of the market for twenty years so 

390.82 395.59 A: um whatever we're doing must be working [laughter] 

393.68 407.63 B: yeah it's definitely it's definitely interesting to say i mean i think that um you know there's always people that are going to be getting divorced there's always people that are unfortunately going to become widowed and they're going to be out there looking again 

407.48 409.09 A: yes yes 

407.70 411.68 B: um so it's uh it's an interesting 

411.39 418.35 A: and in i know i one of my things is that if you know if you're looking at another divorced man or a divorced woman well you know what was their flaw 

418.33 432.96 A: you know what i'm saying because it takes two you know but at the same time maybe it was just that that they married too young or or that they they lost that respect for each other and and yeah there are some in some situations 

427.07 429.62 B: exactly exactly right 

432.98 440.77 A: when all has been exhausted it is sometimes better for all to walk away [laughter] as bad as i hate to say that i think it's true 

437.37 438.41 B: yes 

440.91 441.99 A: yeah 

440.95 454.25 B: yeah i don't think people do i do think that i think that's a good point that it's a constant when you have found your life partner that it it's not well to say that it's work that that doesn't come out right but you do have to keep 

442.36 443.21 A: (( so )) 

450.41 451.31 A: yeah 

454.83 465.39 B: that in the forefront well why am i with this person well i respect this person well let me make sure i'm acting in a respectful way towards them continuously not just when you're courting but you know fifteen years down the road 

458.33 459.11 A: right 

465.05 479.12 A: exactly and and i know that's one thing in our marriage people that even younger people that are around us say oh we want we want to be just like you and darryl which is such a compliment it it truly is but you know we date still 

466.18 467.25 B: so 

476.28 477.44 B: right 

479.08 488.39 A: you know he calls me up and plans a date yeah exactly we every year for our anniversary we take a trip of some kind it doesn't have to be expensive or huge 

479.41 480.81 B: that's great 

480.90 482.71 B: a date night [laughter] the 

488.63 490.88 A: and we do those as well but 

490.91 503.30 A: you know we do something and we plan it and and we spend that time because to me if you do not keep it you know if we looked nice and we acted nice and we did all these great things when we were dating 

503.49 509.64 A: why as soon as we say i do do we quit doing those things and expect that person to treat us exactly the same 

508.98 510.54 B: same exactly 

510.33 512.63 A: [laughter] it makes no sense at all 

511.86 515.26 B: i you've got it all figured out [laughter] 

513.70 524.94 A: [laughter] yeah you know i'm not saying you don't get comfortable with someone and you know with somebody but yeah you you just you can't just let yourself go and go well i'm married now so i don't have to try any more 

516.99 518.85 B: right right 

523.69 525.99 B: and now i don't have to try exactly 

525.15 531.41 A: oh i'm thinking you do [laughter] yeah yeah so 

527.58 528.83 B: [laughter] 

530.28 532.45 B: and you're living proof so 

531.80 546.50 A: yeah that's true yeah so wh- now what do you look what do you look for in maybe a guy that what what do you want him to do for a living and i realize that you know anything is fine as long as he's happy but you know what what kinds of guys are you more interested in 

542.79 544.74 B: (( [laughter] ah it's hard that that )) 

545.99 547.81 B: i think that um 

547.77 557.52 B: that's a good question because i'm um i i'm a pretty motivated person so i'm looking for somebody that's also going to be motivated and usually somebody that's motivated is going to be a successful person 

549.34 550.19 A: mhm 

554.29 555.10 A: good 

557.19 558.69 A: yes uh-huh 

557.44 571.89 B: um and then you know what happens is uh you know i'm in my thirties so you're looking at somebody who if they want to have a family then you get into this whole concept of people are waiting to get married until their late you know in their in their thirties 

564.82 565.80 A: mhm 

571.72 580.20 B: and they're established but the men i think are still seeing that woman as being the working professional woman out there um 

580.12 594.88 B: and personally i think that you should stay at home for the first couple of years with your kids that's when your kids are forming who they're all about and i personally don't want us to have a daycare worker seeing changes in my child and i'm not even there to appreciate it i have to hear it from them 

586.90 588.51 A: mhm mhm 

590.11 591.18 A: right 

594.51 595.39 A: right 

595.05 599.89 B: so it's you know those are big issues i think that are face- that people are facing today
