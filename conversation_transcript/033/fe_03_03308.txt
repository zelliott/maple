111.87 113.51 B: okay [noise] [noise] 

112.47 119.87 A: so i will i will say [laughter] based on the mistake of the first time [mn] the most important thing is that you've got to be friends 

119.99 123.27 B: i agree i think also respect 

120.22 121.05 A: [laughter] 

121.08 121.91 A: yeah 

122.84 124.00 A: right 

123.30 133.87 B: i think friendship and respect are probably the two most important things [noise] and trust is very important [noise] [noise] shh [noise] 

127.02 128.49 A: exactly 

129.53 134.67 A: yeah it is and it they all kind of go together although it's possible to have 

133.84 144.28 B: shh mommy's on the phone [noise] it's okay watch your doggy show he uh hasn't been feeling good [noise] he is two 

135.71 137.46 A: [laughter] go ahead 

141.86 143.55 A: oh okay how old is he 

144.01 146.48 A: okay yeah it's um 

144.81 145.73 B: (( so ca- )) 

147.16 158.65 B: [noise] yes it is and i have two of 'em right now [noise] [noise] i have a two year old and a one year old [noise] the one year old's not mine [noise] and so now they're fighting 

147.35 149.55 A: it's it's a tough age 

149.72 150.85 A: [laughter] 

151.54 153.16 A: two two year olds 

154.33 156.08 A: [laughter] oh bless your heart 

156.52 157.42 A: yeah 

158.41 162.53 A: so you would um add the patience [laughter] 

159.00 161.94 B: [noise] oh 

162.04 167.02 B: i would say patience is probably number three on the list [noise] [noise] and uh 

164.98 166.32 A: it really is 

166.56 170.39 A: yeah i was going to say the friendship and the respect 

169.70 175.17 B: (( [noise] and trust [noise] )) 

170.61 178.44 A: in a in a mate that kinda go together you can you can have a friend that you don't respect because you don't have to live with 'em 

176.28 177.29 B: yes 

178.02 179.56 B: (( right )) 

178.56 186.76 A: so you know i'm going to be your friend no matter what you know no matter how stupid you are and all that but when you have to live with someone you have to respect those choices 

179.72 180.72 B: (( [noise] )) 

182.71 183.71 B: right 

186.19 189.49 B: you have to 'cause if you can't respect his choices 

186.90 187.72 A: because 

189.04 190.72 A: mhm 

189.60 191.67 B: then you're never going to get along 

191.30 193.34 A: no and they're your choices too 

193.01 203.26 B: yeah you have to agree upon things a- and be able to get along with those things because i think a marriage that is full of fighting and it just is bad 

195.09 196.01 A: uh-huh 

197.53 198.42 A: right 

202.62 203.68 A: it is 

203.36 207.67 B: and you can't have that unless you [noise] agree on basic morals 

203.98 204.66 A: wh- 

208.05 210.61 B: and basic interests 

210.18 216.61 A: right it yeah it goes further than moral my husband and i were driving home the other day and we had just had um middle eastern food 

216.24 217.13 B: mhm 

216.48 228.37 A: and we were talking about how strange that is that we both love that and we both love sushi and he said he thinks that's a lot of the reason that we're attracted to each other because we have so many likes and dislikes in common 

227.84 229.33 B: yeah we do too 

228.89 237.89 A: and i would never have thought of that i mean if you had asked me what it was i would never have said because we like the same foods i mean that's silly but it is there somewhere 

234.51 235.41 B: right 

236.18 237.60 B: it's true though 

237.89 240.89 B: [noise] [noise] yeah 

237.97 240.19 A: we always hear opposites attract 

240.22 249.31 A: and i know all kinds of people that have marriages that are i mean the people are from radically different backgrounds and cultures and you know all different 

246.62 248.10 B: yeah i do too 

249.46 253.79 A: and they learn but they they have a harder 

251.47 252.04 B: [noise] 

253.88 254.94 A: time of it 

254.09 256.52 B: marriage i think their marriage is harder 

256.03 257.45 A: yeah it is 

256.95 259.71 B: i do too i agree [noise] i think that if you 

258.30 259.05 A: uh-huh 

259.92 270.97 B: if you have the similar and interests and things are similar in your lives then it's easier it's not as hard i think that the marriages can work eith- either way 

266.01 267.02 A: right 

267.35 269.65 A: right 

269.77 279.23 A: right it's more comfortable that way you have to work harder at it the other way and of course that's that may be more exciting you know some people like a challenge um i- 

272.61 273.45 B: yeah 

277.56 280.60 B: yeah personally i'd like the laid back 

280.07 281.75 A: right [laughter] 

280.72 288.59 B: we just get along he doesn't care if i get up and get dressed and do my hair and makeup and you know but and i'm like that too 

285.86 287.08 A: right 

288.18 289.36 A: right 

288.67 294.34 B: so fo- if he'd a found somebody that was a big hair and makeup gotta get dolled up every day [noise] type of person 

293.82 294.81 A: uh-huh 

294.36 296.73 B: he probably wouldn't get along with 'em as well 

296.14 298.31 A: right exactly 

297.44 299.45 B: but we are so similar 

299.28 306.34 A: and that's not to say that two people that are very different can't make it i mean different cultural backgrounds 

304.18 305.35 B: (( oh )) 

306.18 314.60 A: but i really think that the reason they do is because no matter how they were raised or you know what culture they're from they still have some basic similarities 

310.55 313.79 B: (( no [noise] )) 

313.98 315.17 B: they have to 

314.76 319.30 A: you know and it there's something that goes deeper than that and i don't know what it is i'd have to 

318.53 320.91 B: i think morals is a big [noise] important one 

320.32 322.34 A: yeah it is 

321.32 325.84 B: i i think if you don't have [noise] the same morals especially if you involve children [noise] 

325.54 326.46 A: uh-huh 

325.96 335.24 B: if you get married and have children you have to have almost [noise] very similar morals or you're going to fight constantly on how to raise the children [noise] 

327.87 329.16 A: right 

330.49 331.36 A: right 

332.54 333.27 A: right 

335.37 336.86 B: (( how to teach them )) 

336.75 338.16 A: right 

337.12 342.37 B: so i think your morals [noise] and your ideals about life have to be very similar 

341.94 354.29 A: yeah they do morals is a little bit different from belief systems though because and of course um my husband and i don't have kids and we have talked about that things would be very different if we had kids but um 

348.63 349.58 B: right 

352.06 353.65 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

354.61 359.30 A: h- our morals are very similar he would rather die than tell a lie 

358.99 359.86 B: yeah 

359.25 366.35 A: even if it means you know that he loses money or he hurts someone or whatever he's going to be brutally honest 

360.45 363.55 B: [noise] hurting something right [noise] 

366.28 378.21 A: and i feel that way too and maybe the reason i feel that way is different you know he doesn't have a real strong belief system he's he calls himself agnostic and you know i tend to be a little bit more 

370.83 372.58 B: yeah 

375.23 376.80 B: mhm 

378.09 387.43 A: i don't know i think h- i don't know what his term for it is but the reason is a little bit different but it boils down to the same thing and i think he really 

384.57 385.45 B: right 

385.53 388.08 B: yeah i don't think your beliefs have to be the same 

387.49 388.51 A: right 

388.14 398.82 B: i just think that you have to have the same morals and the same basic ideals of what you want from life and i think that you also i think a big thing in marriage is 

390.24 394.43 A: right exactly right exactly 

399.39 403.95 B: i think that you have to treat your spouse the way you wanna be treated [noise] 

403.41 404.40 A: uh-huh 

403.97 411.38 B: and i think that if you can't treat your spouse with loving and kindness and understanding then you're not going to get it back either 

410.92 413.96 A: right and that's changed so much 

413.90 418.67 A: you know during our generation i know my mother it it 

415.65 416.66 B: yes 

418.59 430.13 A: she did get the respect from my dad because he was that kind of a person but the housewives of the fifties didn't really get a lotta that and you go even further back and i mean they anti 

420.74 423.20 B: (( [noise] right )) 

426.56 428.11 B: no they didn't 

429.02 430.70 B: they got next to none 

430.49 432.03 A: [laughter] right next to none 

432.10 440.55 A: and ah and of course in the cultures we see now you know w- with the war in iraq i am just always constantly amazed at the attitudes toward the women 

440.19 442.29 B: yeah it blows me away 

440.66 448.55 A: that's the one thing that this has just really opened my eyes that i knew it you know intellectually right 

445.77 451.46 B: we knew it was there yeah but we didn't want to admit it until we saw it 

450.37 451.97 A: exactly [mn] 

451.99 455.35 A: you know and there was the joke that they went over bef- m- oop 

456.25 457.69 B: is time up 

457.18 460.79 A: no i i you know what i bet that's my call waiting don't worry about it 

460.14 461.01 B: okay 

460.76 473.82 A: the joke that um some reporters went over before and noticed that the women walked a few paces behind their husbands and now they go over there and notice that they're walking in front and they say oh this is good you know is this because of the western influence and they say no landmines 

466.38 467.78 B: mhm 

473.58 477.26 B: [laughter] that is 

473.66 481.63 A: [laughter] and it just you know that j- you you get chills when you think of that 'cause it's true 

478.21 480.07 B: that's how they they 

480.27 490.42 B: because it is really how they feel about their wives i actually have i have a friend that is married to man that is his family is from that area 

482.67 484.31 A: it really is 

489.83 491.47 A: mhm 

490.54 499.35 B: not actually iraq but they have similar ideals and cultures and it is true that they feel women are worthless 

494.81 495.86 A: right 

498.76 500.16 A: exactly 

499.41 511.65 B: and uh now he doesn't he's been he's lived in america his whole life and uh yeah he doesn't have that thought but he [noise] like even his grandmother you can see it in her 

501.07 502.14 A: right 

503.37 507.14 A: right he's been westernized so much yeah 

511.31 512.22 A: uh-huh 

512.02 515.22 B: that she doesn't feel she [noise] is as important 

514.97 517.28 A: (( right as the man right )) 

516.36 520.90 B: which i [noise] think is ridiculous because i'm from the new generation 

518.61 530.10 A: well i can understand him thinking like some of the native americans they didn't have the same roles but they both were very important you know once one would collapse without the other but they never 

526.18 527.32 B: right 

529.95 540.86 A: crossed their barriers as to what you know what was a woman's job and what was a man's job that i can understand but they really have their no respect for their women they're just a vessel to carry their male children 

534.01 534.88 B: right 

540.48 541.42 B: yes 

540.92 551.11 A: they don't even think anything about the female children i mean uh lord only knows if we really knew i have a feeling that they just don't you know if if the women don't take care of 'em they just let 'em die 

542.96 543.78 B: no 

550.77 552.11 B: oh they probably do 

551.51 556.10 A: [laughter] i know i read a book um when i was like a teenager [lipsmack] 

556.19 558.12 A: that was talking about that and 

558.54 560.36 A: it i didn't believe it 

560.43 561.88 B: it's disgusting 

561.47 574.16 A: i just thought that that was just something that was maybe a long time ago you know that was like talking about women in america back you know in the eighteen hundreds or something it just didn't dawn on me that that could really still be going on today 

565.75 567.30 B: right [noise] right [noise] 

569.55 570.55 B: [noise] 

573.24 575.21 B: yeah that that could be the case 

574.61 575.47 A: yeah 

575.28 581.12 B: it blows my mind that there are cultures well and there's even people in the united states that treat their wives like that 

580.48 581.40 A: oh yeah 

581.35 584.79 B: there are men that treat their wives like they are dirt 

584.69 594.85 A: [noise] [mn] right and and those women that came from situations where their father treated their mother like that and the father treated them like that are comfortable in that situation and end up staying 

584.95 585.80 B: and 

594.63 598.16 B: yeah me i would be like hit the road jack 

595.17 596.34 A: you know so 

597.35 599.89 A: oh exactly well that's what you hear about the battered w-
