204.41 207.06 A: oh okay oh that's a beautiful place 

205.67 206.65 B: i guess 

207.07 213.74 B: it is a beautiful place but it's um i'm glad i'm not single here [laughter] 'cause 

211.99 212.84 A: [laughter] 

214.11 220.32 B: when i i came here and i was single and then i met my husband here and um 

219.21 220.45 A: oh okay 

220.44 223.41 B: there's about eight women to every man here 

223.21 225.79 A: [laughter] 

224.50 227.25 B: that's what they say i don't know 

227.84 232.26 A: oh okay so it it's better for a man to be single there [laughter] i guess 

231.51 236.03 B: i think so i think it's very good for a man to be single here 

235.81 243.88 A: yeah no i i i've you know as far as what i look for in a in a life partner one one of the reasons why i guess i'm 

244.10 245.12 A: (( uh )) 

245.33 250.60 A: i'm not married [laughter] is you know i think i think one of the key issues is is communication 

246.89 247.99 B: uh-huh 

250.61 252.32 B: yeah i agree 

251.30 259.34 A: you know being able to communicate you had mentioned somebody to be your best friend and i think in order to be a best friend you need to be able to communicate 

259.21 260.57 B: that's right 

259.84 262.69 A: (( you know uh if y- you're you know talk about anything )) 

262.58 268.52 B: that's right you need to be able to talk to [sigh] your partner and you need to not keep secrets 

268.69 278.53 B: you know there shouldn't be any secrets um because otherwise eventually you know the relationship breaks down if there's no trust 

268.74 269.77 A: (( right )) 

276.92 278.15 A: right 

279.38 286.00 B: and um it's interesting too 'cause nowadays there's a lot of um people that are older that are single 

286.01 293.75 B: and that are there are a lot of divorced people 'cause i think it's like three out of four people now get divorced it's something like that 

292.17 293.23 A: right 

294.09 297.20 B: so i don't know something is breaking down 

297.13 298.26 A: [laughter] 

297.33 303.04 B: i mean [laughter] i mean we've got a problem here [sigh] i think 

301.97 303.26 A: no that's true that's 

303.30 304.36 A: very true 

304.37 310.30 B: 'cause it used to be people stayed together for a real long time you know until they died [laughter] 

309.98 311.56 A: yeah yeah 

310.95 315.91 B: you know and it's just it's very strange now because you're not seeing that 

316.63 318.69 B: so you don't have any children 

318.96 319.88 A: no 

319.68 320.78 B: no 

320.89 325.35 B: and um do you think you'll s- do you think you will get married 

325.63 326.99 A: well i mean 

327.21 335.25 A: i i think the possibility is still there i mean i'm very open to marriage but um you know i i'm um i guess i'm a little more careful than 

329.41 331.54 B: yeah uh-huh 

335.34 339.18 A: i should be but um i am being you know relatively cautious 

339.26 343.07 A: because you know i don't wanna end up with somebody who's going to 

343.54 347.14 A: have a problem and not be able to tell me about it or you know 

345.98 347.10 B: right 

347.24 350.33 A: because that's what takes people outside of the relationship 

350.48 351.90 A: (( you know that's what people )) 

350.52 355.87 B: well i think that's right i agree with you i think as you get older it gets harder 

355.75 359.24 A: yeah and and 

357.22 358.31 B: (( you know be- )) 

359.64 360.77 A: no and then 

359.81 361.25 B: go ahead i'm sorry 

361.01 371.12 A: no no that's okay no i was just saying you know i i think that's a lot of what what i find now you know i mean i don't mean to sound like i'm a boring person 'cause i don't think i am [laughter] but you kn- 

370.01 371.08 B: right 

371.15 375.89 A: you know when the relationship goes on a few years you know and it becomes to 

375.94 378.07 A: becomes um routine 

377.93 379.04 B: right 

379.32 380.27 A: (( you know )) 

380.76 389.13 B: well i you know my husband and i we still go out every saturday night we still go out to dinner and go to the movies or do something 

381.58 383.11 A: (( i i )) 

389.09 390.35 A: that is great 

389.35 394.97 B: and i it is great and i think you really have to do that i think 

394.19 395.03 A: yes 

395.06 401.40 B: you have to have fun you know because once you stop having fun then you might as well just pack it in 

401.12 402.36 A: [laughter] 

401.78 403.68 B: [laughter] 

402.54 405.44 A: that's so true [laughter] that that's just so true 

404.15 409.80 B: it is it's true because you know then you're yeah my daughter is sixteen 

409.84 415.03 B: and pretty soon she'll be all off to college and there'll just be the two of us 

415.14 418.71 B: so you know once it's just the two of you 

415.16 416.68 A: right 

418.75 425.00 B: you better really still love each other because you know that's it folks [laughter] you know 

424.16 425.19 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

426.09 432.72 A: that's true that's very true but um you know that's what happens with relationships you know after a few years sometimes 

432.16 433.36 B: right 

432.76 438.05 A: um you know you stop talking or you start becoming routine and you know if i say something like 

438.47 442.16 A: you know i w- we need to do something new or we need to break the routine 

442.32 444.95 A: they get upset you know people that i date or 

443.76 444.86 B: really 

445.15 452.76 A: or some of them do or otherwise it's the other way around they don't say anything and if they want to break the routine they'll start going out on their own looking for other 

453.03 455.66 A: [laughter] avenues just to make things interesting 

454.16 455.96 B: well that's interesting [laughter] 

456.13 459.06 A: and then you know they and that's where cheating begins 

459.13 466.65 A: you know and i'm glad that i i've been fortunate in in certain ways to be able to catch that early in a [laughter] relationship you know before 

465.50 466.70 B: really 

466.83 471.50 A: yeah before getting married as opposed to a lot of people finding out after getting married you know 

470.79 478.08 B: well that's the problem people put on a facade a lot of times in a relationship before they're married 

477.86 479.05 A: yeah 

478.44 484.11 B: and then all of a sudden they're different people when they're married which is really weird um 

483.27 484.58 A: right 

484.47 499.35 B: because you know it's like all these stupid t._v. shows that they have i mean you can't just get married i mean it's not you know [laughter] it's not you know it's not like going into you know target or something you know [laughter] you can't 

497.18 500.14 A: [laughter] [noise] [laughter] yeah and picking out a spouse [laughter] 

499.61 513.44 B: right right yeah just say oh gee i think i'll get married and if it doesn't work i can always divorce the guy or you know it just doesn't work not in my not in not in my mind it doesn't i think it to me i'm too 

505.72 507.71 A: [laughter] well [noise] 

513.53 517.36 B: emotionally connected so to me 

515.73 516.91 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

517.40 529.59 B: i i don't think i could just say well bye see you later it's been really nice knowing you and in atlanta you can get divorced within eleven days no it's thirt- thirty days thirty days 

526.63 527.65 A: wow 

528.53 529.41 A: (( thirty days )) 

529.88 541.17 B: and so within thirty days you know you can say oh well he didn't work out see you later so a lot of people will come to the will come to atlanta just so they can get a divorce 

541.20 542.21 A: wow 

542.04 543.53 B: isn't that interesting 

543.82 545.05 A: that's amazing 

544.75 551.24 B: it is and and see at least in new jersey and new york i think it's it it could be i think it's about a year at least [mn] 

551.16 561.23 A: yeah you have to be legally separated for a year before you can even proceed with a divorce although there's ways you know there's ways around it there are loop holes but you know you have that's basically the law 

555.86 556.97 B: yeah here 

561.60 572.71 B: well i think that should be the law across the board um because i think people change their mind you know i i i think they think wait what am i doing this is really stupid 

568.00 569.05 A: right 

573.13 575.85 B: you know i've just thrown away 

573.18 575.55 A: (( [laughter] well [sigh] d- divorce is )) 

577.05 583.66 A: yes divorce is you know is is very easy which makes relationships relationships very disposable [laughter] 

582.71 595.10 B: that's right well i think that people are very disposable now you know i'm finding that they're more and raising a teenager is very difficult because it really seems like people are disposable 

586.60 587.60 A: yeah 

591.73 592.48 A: [noise] 

595.06 596.20 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

596.37 599.90 B: you know and and then they don't and kids are seeing all this
