6.17 7.08 B: hello 

6.55 8.48 A: ho- yeah how's it going 

7.31 9.55 B: yeah [laughter] pretty good 

9.60 12.70 B: so we have to talk about life partners sounds like 

11.83 16.89 A: yeah well what did they say what is the most important thing in a life partner 

16.38 17.64 B: yeah 

17.69 18.66 B: uh 

17.86 18.53 A: (( mm )) 

18.67 22.25 B: gosh so what do you think is the most important thing [laughter] 

21.85 24.10 A: (( well considering )) 

22.93 24.03 B: are you married 

24.30 30.01 A: co i'm getting ready to say considering i'm not married i'm still trying to figure it out [laughter] 

28.07 31.79 B: oh okay [laughter] i've been married seven years 

31.54 32.95 A: oh okay 

32.20 40.90 B: so i think [mn] i think love is the most important thing [laughter] out of all because if you love a person 

40.92 48.23 B: and um if there is any problems i think you can overcome any problems if you know that you have love 

47.91 49.90 A: yeah that's true 

48.44 52.23 B: i think that's the most important and loyalty and um 

52.52 54.75 B: just that's the most important i think 

54.47 60.05 A: you're right i think so too and and then speaking of love i think it's really all about 

59.84 63.88 A: unconditional love 'cause there's like different levels of love 

61.43 62.13 B: yeah 

63.72 68.72 A: and if you love someone unconditionally like you say you can get over anything because 

68.12 69.30 B: that's true 

68.72 80.20 A: you accept them as they are and who they are and you know and loyalty that's another problem i was telling my boyfriend well he's my ex now i said we can't be together any more because 

77.93 78.90 B: yeah 

80.05 85.77 A: you're not committed to commitment and he didn't understand what that meant yeah 

82.60 84.27 B: yeah that's so important 

85.19 89.80 B: yeah and the same goals in life also is uh important 

88.52 90.67 A: exactly 

90.33 95.04 B: because uh i mean you have to have at least one same point you 

91.02 92.30 A: exactly 

95.11 105.04 A: right right 'ca- 'cause otherwise you're working on two individual lives you can't merge together and have one life together if you're working on different goals 

95.40 96.12 B: (( know )) 

105.05 113.62 B: that's right because it is hard i mean marriage is a very hard thing [laughter] i didn't know what i was doing when i got married [laughter] 

110.25 111.31 A: yeah 

112.72 124.53 A: everyone says that you know people like me who are not married and i'm thirty two years old i'm sitting here looking at the clock saying oh god come on prince charming i got a train to catch hurry up hurry up 

114.24 115.97 B: [laughter] 

116.67 117.52 B: uh-huh 

123.41 124.47 B: [laughter] 

124.30 135.37 A: but people i know who are married they say you know it's great but it's very hard you have to work on it it's not like a dating situation you really have to work on it 

129.13 130.03 B: yes 

132.66 133.43 B: no 

134.64 139.41 B: you know the m- the funniest thing is like if my husband buys me something expensive 

139.18 140.33 A: mhm 

139.50 148.72 B: i can't somehow i don't feel as happy a- as i was when it my boyfriend buying me something [laughter] because i think well you know 

146.31 148.38 A: [laughter] 

148.66 154.83 B: if you were my boyfriend you were spending your own money that's one thing but this is our family money [laughter] 

152.35 153.64 A: yeah right 

153.98 158.44 A: now you start thinking about what bill has to suffer [laughter] 

156.98 160.05 B: that's right [laughter] so i'll think [laughter] 

158.68 162.76 A: ooh it's ro- robbing peter to pay to pay paul now 

162.05 170.78 B: yep [laughter] so that's different but um marriage is hard because i kind of jumped into it i mean i love my husband 

163.48 164.76 A: [laughter] 

168.87 170.00 A: yeah 

170.24 171.28 A: right 

171.10 174.65 B: but oh my god it was so hard and uh 

173.61 175.42 A: do you guys have kids yet 

175.00 176.81 B: yeah we have two kids 

176.44 177.48 A: okay 

177.09 182.09 B: and i wa- i got married when i was twenty one i'm twenty eight right now and it was 

180.51 181.31 A: (( yeah )) 

182.15 192.04 B: i'm from russia and we had this long distance i mean we met in person and everything he was in russia but then we hadn't seen each other uh for two years 

183.63 184.66 A: okay 

187.63 188.62 A: mhm 

191.71 193.99 A: oh 

192.36 200.95 B: and when we got together i mean we loved each other and everything but it was just so hard getting used to like living together [laughter] so 

200.11 202.64 A: who who came over first you or him 

202.54 214.63 B: uh he went to russia he was in the military and that's how we met and then i went to school in america and then i came to visit him for a month or so and then i went back so it was kind of like back and forth 

206.68 207.88 A: oh okay 

214.19 216.54 A: oh i see what you're saying okay 

215.40 218.30 B: yeah i wasn't a mail order bride no that's different 

217.58 220.98 A: ok- [laughter] 

218.74 226.99 B: [laughter] but uh i mean even though we knew each other but living together and actually having a marriage it was 

226.32 230.79 A: that's a whole 'nother ballpark that's right that's right 

227.14 228.32 B: (( completely different )) 

229.26 236.78 B: yeah it was so difficult and the worst part of it was that when we would get upset at each other i didn't have any place to go 

236.86 237.60 B: (( so )) 

237.05 251.16 A: and you know it's so funny because i'm thinking about me and my ex we lived together just temporarily for like about three four months maybe then i'm we moved apart and i got mes- myself another apartment and then he went on and got hisself another apartment 

243.75 244.61 B: uh-huh 

250.92 264.54 A: but it's like you say you never know anyone until you've lived with them and the little things it's not even the big things it's the little things that can work you to death and like you said when we used to argue 

255.12 256.08 B: yeah 

261.27 262.75 B: yeah that's true 

264.43 272.33 A: ah what i would do is i would go we had like a two bedroom i would go in the room and the bedroom had two doors and i would go in the room and close the door 

270.39 271.29 B: uh-huh 

272.29 279.71 A: and he would follow me and i hated that because it's like you said i understand you just want somewhere to go just let me just 

275.05 275.91 B: yeah 

279.61 293.38 A: i need some time alone and he would follow me so'd i go out one door we looked like a comedy act i'd go out one door he'd follow me we'd do a full circle [laughter] i just wanted somewhere to go and and time there was times when i'd say 

282.12 282.91 B: oh 

284.74 286.18 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

287.81 289.32 B: [laughter] 

293.25 300.40 A: what did i get myself into i can't live with him because i can't get away from him now i now have to look at him when i'm mad 

294.89 295.75 B: (( yes )) 

299.92 311.87 B: yeah that's we went through that thing and my husband was so mad because well i grew up in um with traditions where like man is everything you know like everything you want dear or like everything like that 

309.06 310.47 A: right right 

311.80 317.00 B: and that drove my husband crazy he was like i don't want a slave i want a partner 

313.92 315.25 A: (( ooh )) 

316.89 318.31 A: right right 

317.04 322.35 B: so now when we argue i was like okay you didn't want a slave [laughter] here's your partner [laughter] 

320.16 325.78 A: [laughter] [laughter] and i'm as equal as you right exactly 

324.09 325.00 B: (( yep )) 

325.39 331.02 B: but if it wasn't for love there's no way we would have made it through that's 

325.91 327.65 A: wow that's interesting 

330.41 337.69 A: but you know what uh he's a good man though because see a lot of men thank god he's not that type that a lot of men especially like american men 

335.58 336.56 B: no 

337.52 350.57 A: they like they like women who come from a culture where women are like you know all subservient and men are everything a lot of men they like that 'cause a lot of american men they specifically pick 

340.85 341.63 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

343.55 344.50 B: yeah 

350.58 358.06 A: um you know women from other countries so that that you know that can be fulfilled with them you know what i'm saying 

354.69 355.72 B: yeah 

356.96 360.84 B: yeah i've seen so many l- men like that [laughter] there were so 

359.81 361.94 A: yeah that's terrible 

360.86 367.62 B: that's like when somebody finds out that i'm from russia and i'm married to an american they think that's why he married me [laughter] i was like 

366.39 373.96 A: oh it's you see yeah they think you're fulfilling the stereoty- isn't that sad though [laughter] 

368.29 369.03 B: (( yeah )) 

371.27 376.79 B: yeah that is sad and i i always tell them okay i'm not a mail order bride [laughter] so stop 

375.60 378.30 A: [laughter] 

377.29 381.63 B: because you know people like labeling like okay this is [laughter] 

378.97 393.69 A: exac- [laughter] exactly and i wonder i really wonder about men like that it's one thing to go to another country or to go eh or specifically say well you know i prefer to date you know m- eastern european women or whatever 

383.94 384.83 B: uh-huh 

393.48 403.81 A: but to actually like do the mail order bride thing when they get together what do they have in common like we're talking about compatibility what do they have in 

396.49 398.37 B: oh that's so hard 

401.61 402.58 B: yeah 

403.86 404.53 A: (( common )) 

403.92 408.32 B: you know some of them can't even speak the same language that's bad 

406.62 410.32 A: that's terr- see that's ridiculous that's so what 

409.22 410.85 B: i don't know how they do it 

410.68 414.26 A: do they do they communicate with sign language [laughter] 

413.23 422.25 B: yeah i i i knew this couple she was american and he was russian and they didn't he didn't speak um english and she didn't speak russian 

422.25 423.88 A: oh my god 

422.88 426.15 B: i was like how do you two communicate they were like 

425.49 428.32 A: so how did they get married was it an arrangement 

428.29 432.22 B: i don't know i couldn't ask them [laughter] about that 

431.17 435.03 A: right i understand right right you didn't want to pry right 

433.49 440.16 B: yeah but [noise] i mean i don't know if they're still married or not but oh gosh i i would never be able to do that 

439.64 449.52 A: yeah because now you can't share anything the only thing you can share in common is is bedtime that's [laughter] no need to speak any english [laughter] 

442.15 443.18 B: yeah 

445.33 447.12 B: [laughter] 

448.12 451.64 B: that's right [laughter] 

450.72 455.22 A: that's the only thing they had in common but that's not enough you know 

452.90 453.81 B: yeah 

454.40 457.53 B: no there's no way you get tired of that thing 

457.34 470.71 A: yeah exactly exa- i wish my boyfriend could hear this because we'll fight and he'll say oh come over let's make love that'll make up for everything i'll say no no you you you got it backwards that comes later [laughter] 

457.67 458.92 B: soon enough 

464.99 465.64 B: (( oh )) 

468.87 471.72 B: that's right you have to work it out first 

471.39 482.34 A: yeah exactly so needless to say we're not compatible because he thinks the exact opposite of the way i think and it's just like it's ridiculous [laughter] 

476.54 477.90 B: [laughter] 

479.28 484.25 B: [laughter] [noise] yeah let me tell my kids go out go play 

484.35 485.61 A: [laughter]
