27.33 28.22 B: where 

29.20 30.99 B: oh wow [laughter] 

29.94 32.58 A: [laughter] up in the cold area 

33.87 34.93 A: um 

34.98 39.64 A: well what is what is it you look for in a life partner 

39.82 40.75 B: um 

41.19 42.49 B: i guess 

42.80 44.01 B: patience 

43.98 44.96 A: mhm 

45.06 46.93 B: like 'cause a lotta people 

46.85 60.31 B: today like i i don't know maybe it's maturity because um i'm twenty two years um twenty two duh [laughter] i'm twenty five years old and most of my friends are anywhere from like twenty two to twenty five 

54.18 56.29 A: [laughter] 

59.86 60.94 A: yeah 

60.20 62.98 B: and all these guys act like they're like twelve 

62.65 66.02 A: yeah [laughter] yeah 

63.33 64.44 B: (( so )) 

64.60 65.44 B: [laughter] 

65.97 68.74 A: i remember that i'm i'm thirty 

68.58 82.69 A: so it wasn't that long ago i was there but it seems like the older they get the more mature they get but you know if you want a mature one you'll probably have to marry someone like thirty [laughter] thirty five to get at your level [laughter] 

77.68 78.87 B: [laughter] 

80.15 86.11 B: that's what my sister said that you have to wait until like they're thirty five 'cause then they kinda get up there 

85.50 87.01 A: (( yeah )) 

87.25 91.98 A: yeah i think um respect is is something that needs to be 

92.38 104.63 A: there um i was married before and he never respected me he just he was always cutting me down you know beating me up and you know that was just you know it really took my self esteem down 

104.34 105.62 B: yes that's 

104.95 108.62 A: and i got married again and this guy is totally respectful 

109.16 110.87 A: he's just 

111.15 114.05 A: he takes all my feelings into consideration 

114.99 115.84 A: so 

116.24 118.51 A: i guess you could say that's part of maturity too 

116.53 117.28 B: that's 

119.00 125.81 B: yeah i guess you could kinda like they they always say like you should see how they treat their moms 

125.49 127.14 A: yeah 

125.97 129.62 B: usually you can kind of like grasp that but 

129.48 131.61 A: yeah 

130.85 136.38 B: i'm currently i'm i'm with someone and i just had a baby with him 

136.46 137.46 A: (( oh )) 

137.44 143.60 B: but i haven't completely made my mind up about him yet [laughter] because prior to 

139.87 141.71 A: [laughter] 

143.62 146.57 B: baby being he uh 

146.97 155.02 B: he was like one day he would be like be the best person in the entire world to me and then the next day he was a complete a. hole 

154.72 155.79 A: yeah 

155.57 159.04 B: and but now

167.85 168.62 B: so 

169.60 170.75 B: [laughter] 

174.71 178.11 A: oh i think i think they need to be good fathers too 

178.07 179.29 B: mhm 

178.58 187.95 A: if you wanna have a family you gotta look for that because a man who doesn't like kids you know there's gonna be problems there if you want want kids

216.43 227.32 A: and he comes home and he lets me just relax and do what i wanna do i can go on the computer or read a book or take a bath and he he watches them every day so i can get away from 'em 

221.50 222.44 B: [laughter] 

227.77 228.69 B: (( wow )) 

228.06 234.68 A: i have four of 'em so [laughter] three from my first marriage and then one from this marriage

236.70 237.85 B: [laughter] 

238.96 243.45 B: i can't even imagine having another one right now it's too soon 

241.59 242.84 A: [laughter] 

243.12 244.14 A: yeah 

244.44 245.71 A: how old is yours 

245.46 247.06 B: um two months old 

246.75 250.35 A: (( oh they are so previous when they're that little )) 

249.93 250.96 B: [laughter] 

250.38 253.03 A: mine's two years old my youngest so 

253.65 260.64 A: i don't i don't have a baby anymore [laughter] it's nice when they're that age they don't back talk [laughter] 

255.82 256.98 B: [laughter] 

261.05 264.85 B: yeah so far so good [laughter] 

264.31 265.73 A: yeah 

265.07 271.01 B: he's already gaining his own l- little personality if he doesn't want me to feed him he'll start yelling 

270.98 272.12 A: oh 

271.37 274.58 B: and and he wants his father to feed him so [laughter] 

273.53 277.00 A: [laughter] that's cute 

278.73 279.95 A: i think 

280.55 282.74 A: men gotta be good looking too i 

283.86 284.91 B: (( yeah that )) 

283.93 291.04 A: don't think they have to be you know gorgeous gorgeous but they gotta be nice on the outside as well as the inside 

291.14 297.06 B: yeah just have to look look good enough just enough so that you don't get tired of looking at them [laughter] mhm 

295.54 298.53 A: (( [laughter] yeah exactly )) 

299.62 308.78 A: so i'm not i'm not too much you know looks aren't the most important thing to me but you know when i first see somebody i wanna be attracted to 'em 

308.82 309.97 B: definitely 

309.64 310.65 A: so 

310.81 314.80 A: but i think you know the person that they are on the inside is 

315.14 323.72 A: definitely what makes them good looking on the outside in my opinion just the behavior changes their looks 

323.62 326.29 B: i i definitely think that's absolutely true 

326.14 327.87 A: yeah 

326.66 328.89 B: 'cause i i've 

329.06 332.07 B: i've gone through like my friend was in love with this guy 

332.24 342.58 B: and it's just that he was she was like telling me that he looks like a model and he's so good looking and his chest is so built but he's like his mouth was like a it was like a trucker's 

343.11 343.96 B: (( its like )) 

343.97 347.08 B: how could you even look at his head [laughter] 

345.52 348.67 A: [laughter] 

351.01 356.14 A: they have they gotta be good on the inside or something [laughter] 

353.92 354.82 B: (( [noise] )) 

356.93 357.82 A: (( i don't )) 

358.84 360.01 A: know 

360.43 361.57 A: what else 

362.99 363.72 B: (( mm )) 

364.44 366.22 A: (( they've gotta be responsible )) 

367.22 374.86 A: somebody that doesn't wanna pay the bills and spends all the money and you know gambles and stuff that's that's bad for a marriage [laughter] 

374.94 377.00 B: yeah definitely 

376.57 378.99 A: you know a little bit here and there's okay but 

379.38 384.76 A: my ex husband he used to blow all our money on lottery tickets and gambling 

385.18 394.44 A: so we lived like we we made like a fifty thousand dollar a year income but we were living like we were on fifteen thousand a year he was awful [laughter] 

392.22 392.84 B: (( [mn] )) 

395.00 399.00 B: i i i kinda like the way it is right now 'cause 

399.26 400.15 B: um 

400.36 406.99 B: this this one has basically he had a a he has a spending problem if he has the money he goes out 

406.81 417.72 B: and he either goes to a bar or it's not like he's like he's not like an alcoholic but he just like happens he'll go there and he'll buy like all of his buddies drinks and stuff and he wastes his mon- he used to waste his money like that 

417.33 418.41 A: yeah 

417.63 424.39 B: but i like it 'cause he like acknowledged that he actually has me taking care of the bills and stuff 

423.44 425.29 A: yeah that's a good idea 

425.59 431.98 B: so like 'cause he knows that i'm not gonna turn around and like say oh well this is all my money [laughter] 

431.17 433.11 A: [laughter] 

432.27 435.62 B: i'm gonna make sure that everything gets taken care of first 

434.87 446.10 A: yeah that that takes me into another thing trust if you don't if you don't trust each other there's no way you can have a relationship 'cause there's nothing in it it's not going to be anything but suspicion 

438.14 439.09 B: mhm 

446.40 447.68 B: exactly 

446.94 448.30 A: all the time 

449.06 456.14 B: that's definitely probably the like a really big point that i don't really think about [laughter] but it probably would make a lot of difference 

455.51 456.68 A: mhm 

457.66 462.51 B: 'cause i see how like i i i've seen like some of my friends that like if they 

462.76 464.08 B: when they were in 

464.10 467.28 B: relationships i have one right now that like 

467.43 469.87 B: last summer he cheated on her 

469.86 471.11 A: mhm 

470.31 480.35 B: and she caught him and now this summer he's start- starting all of a sudden to spend time with his ex that he has kids with that is the person that he cheated on her with last year 

480.91 485.20 B: so every time he leaves and doesn't call her when she says to call her 

485.17 486.25 A: mhm 

485.86 490.02 B: she's automatically assuming that he's with her and he's not doing the right thing 

489.83 491.85 A: yeah 

491.32 493.58 B: i couldn't possibly live like that 

493.14 500.96 A: no it's it's an awful feeling i went through that with my first one he was an awful person i don't know why i married him in the first place 

500.80 503.32 B: he he sounds very very 

501.20 513.35 A: [laughter] he he just fits into all the bad you know everything you don't want a man to be [laughter] i was just young and wanting to get outta my mom and dad's house 

506.64 507.71 B: (( [laughter] )) 

508.49 509.62 B: [laughter] 

513.44 518.10 A: they were real strict [laughter] he was just a way out you know yeah get married 

513.59 515.25 B: [laughter] 

521.48 526.60 B: like i i my ideal person would probably be my father 

526.44 528.33 A: [laughter] mine too 

527.78 532.28 B: [laughter] but they don't seem to make them anymore [laughter] 

531.05 534.21 A: no [laughter] i think they're outta style 

535.55 537.23 A: those are hard to find 

537.60 541.58 B: 'cause my my parents passed away when i was kinda young but 

541.63 545.98 B: i've never heard one bad thing said about either one of them as a couple 

544.85 546.72 A: mhm yeah 

546.65 551.78 B: like even 'cause i have an older sister that's twelve years older than me so she'd know better 

551.42 552.42 A: right 

552.35 554.96 B: and she never says that they ever fought 

554.99 561.48 B: she she never like acknowledged them having like bad vibes against each other in the house or anything 

561.13 563.11 A: mhm 

561.89 565.47 B: like my my father was like head over heels for my mom 

565.31 566.41 A: oh 

565.59 568.70 B: and like treated her like gold so 

567.60 570.50 A: oh that is just that's awesome 

570.85 573.86 A: it's hard to find relationships like that 

573.24 574.47 B: mhm 

575.00 578.51 A: and you think it only happens in the movies but it's out there 

578.38 581.39 B: yeah it's just very very rare [laughter] 

579.95 581.76 A: yes [laughter] 

584.02 585.52 A: yeah they gotta 

584.19 585.01 B: (( mhm )) 

585.66 587.40 A: (( they have to treat you good )) 

588.49 591.10 A: i used my ideas when i was younger about 

591.26 596.01 A: men who i wanted to be with were so much different when i was in my teens 

596.20 599.89 A: and now that i'm older that i've experienced what i thought was
