20.95 23.88 A: okay and what we look for in them 

23.92 30.39 B: right uh you know i guess to me the most important thing to look for in a life partner would be 

30.79 34.03 B: whether or not you have a compatible personality 

34.43 36.76 A: yeah that would be 

36.77 41.70 A: that's a really good thing you have to be able to get along with someone

48.87 50.42 A: my first marriage 

50.66 57.68 A: was terrible we did not communicate at all i think you have to be able to communicate and talk to somebody 

52.96 53.93 B: yeah 

57.21 65.73 B: oh i totally agree i totally agree my um [lipsmack] i would say my parents are actually they were married for about twenty fives 

60.31 61.19 A: i mean we 

65.75 79.45 B: and they i don't as from like you know looking at their relationship from my point of view they didn't have anything in common at all and i always wondered you know what they had to keep their interest in each other going and 

79.43 86.99 B: apparently it wasn't a lot because they ended up getting divorced but they really had they had i mean they had nothing in common at all 

82.53 83.93 A: (( oh no [mn] )) 

87.68 88.67 B: so 

89.40 93.85 A: well i don't i met my second husband on the internet

94.50 96.61 A: yes and 

95.64 97.82 B: that's really that's cool 

97.20 102.15 A: [laughter] well i think it gave us a chance to get to know each other 

102.08 103.17 B: uh-huh 

102.93 107.03 A: without uh any physical part to begin with 

105.70 108.09 B: right right 

107.33 114.86 A: and we really did get to know each other which was just great we knew everything about the other one 

115.20 120.49 B: how how long did you like how long did you correspond over the internet before you met each other 

120.01 123.66 A: um we met in like january of nineteen ninety nine 

123.88 130.09 A: and um on the internet and then he came over because he's from the u. k. 

126.54 127.49 B: uh-huh 

130.18 131.41 B: oh really 

130.59 131.29 A: (( [cough] )) 

131.55 133.49 A: he came over in july 

133.61 135.48 A: to visit for three weeks 

135.24 136.23 B: uh-huh 

136.30 140.94 A: and but before that before we'd even actually met he proposed 

140.82 142.21 B: oh really 

141.62 148.18 A: yeah [laughter] which is kinda weird but that put a bit of that put a lot of pressure on us actually meeting you know 

142.62 145.08 B: (( wow [laughter] if you'd )) 

147.92 152.05 B: right did you accept when he proposed the first time or 

151.24 153.84 A: no [laughter] no 

152.19 153.80 B: (( you didn't [laughter] )) 

154.60 156.80 B: is that why he decided to come over 

156.45 163.53 A: well no well he he wanted to come over to see and he you know said for three weeks to actually give us enough time to see if we were 

163.60 165.43 A: actually compatible 

165.18 166.58 B: (( right )) 

165.67 166.97 A: physically 

166.63 167.92 B: right 

167.14 169.96 A: i mean we would know surely after three weeks 

169.64 173.59 B: sure and that's certainly important too yeah 

171.74 174.62 A: oh yeah i think it is too 'cause if you 

175.58 177.70 B: if you don't have that spark 

176.88 179.09 A: [laughter] exactly if if there's 

178.00 179.78 B: yeah [laughter] 

179.71 183.55 A: and if you lose that spark you're in trouble 

182.11 184.69 B: right yeah 

183.92 188.50 A: and that's what happened in my first marriage it you know lost it and 

186.02 187.64 B: (( oh really )) 

188.56 193.06 A: besides the no communication thing we would go for days at a time and not speak at all 

192.67 195.94 B: my god and how long did you say you were married the first time

214.88 216.10 B: mhm 

215.71 219.85 A: followed by physical [laughter] 

217.94 226.59 B: right right but and you know unfortunate- i mean the physical's really important but unfortunately it can't carry it by itself [laughter] 

224.70 227.43 A: no it can't it cannot 

226.98 228.91 B: it can only go so far 

228.58 229.90 A: so are you single

286.84 292.15 A: it's so hard if you don't and it seems like you give more or you're taking more 

292.49 295.99 A: in a relationship if you don't communicate and if you 

295.84 297.16 B: right 

296.00 304.41 A: don't have similar personalities you know my husband and i don't have similar personalities but we have a lot in common 

304.37 311.88 B: right well you know even like even if you don't have similar personalities sometimes that just plays well off of each other because you balance each other out
