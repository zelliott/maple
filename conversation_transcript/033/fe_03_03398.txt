166.49 167.87 B: (( mhm )) 

167.27 169.05 A: it just was hard on her 

168.84 170.25 B: yeah 

169.57 171.56 A: it was it was so 

172.14 174.32 A: that's a big thing to consider 

173.99 175.22 B: precisely 

175.51 179.80 A: and i've seen with my brothers you know they just they didn't 

180.17 184.66 A: [noise] they kinda wanted to follow my dad and they didn't stay in the church because 

184.73 191.29 A: you know they're like oh that's just for girls because mom was the only one that went and they kinda got that impression 

188.58 189.98 B: right 

191.28 192.84 B: (( mhm )) 

192.95 195.05 B: [lipsmack] my brother's the same way

195.23 196.74 A: yeah 

197.03 199.37 A: and it's you know and so you know 

199.65 208.51 A: raising two boys i i i feel blessed that my husband you know is an example to them and they won't feel like oh church is just for moms you know 

203.52 204.33 B: (( [mn] )) 

205.58 206.49 B: right 

207.88 209.62 B: [laughter]

210.67 211.38 B: (( yes )) 

212.72 213.59 B: (( yeah )) 

213.70 215.29 A: so that's kind of 

215.40 219.45 A: to me that was like [mn] one of the most important things 

219.64 220.64 B: right 

221.21 222.89 B: i know precisely what you mean 

222.67 223.91 A: yeah 

224.77 227.15 A: let's see what else [laughter] 

227.47 231.41 A: i know they like like us to talk about personal experience too 

232.27 233.32 A: um 

234.18 235.66 A: i guess 

236.37 238.47 A: other things in a life partner 

238.48 239.79 B: [mn] well i know that 

241.47 243.04 B: my first marriage 

243.63 245.76 B: i'm still young very young 

245.74 246.69 A: yeah 

245.96 247.76 B: and my first marriage was 

247.87 249.33 B: there was like no 

250.06 252.77 B: the religion wasn't there everything was 

252.79 255.12 B: not there and it's like okay 

256.01 262.73 B: first of all i wanna have someone that'll accept my personal needs because i'm i've got fibromyalge so it's 

263.18 264.65 B: i'm mostly home 

264.56 265.73 A: mhm 

266.01 270.80 B: plus i'm mormon which means if i ever have kids i'm mostly home 

270.77 276.48 A: yeah so you need somebody that will be understanding of that for sure 

272.14 273.09 B: so 

275.02 276.13 B: yes 

277.81 282.15 B: and [lipsmack] after that it's 

282.95 284.38 B: if i 

286.31 287.38 B: (( uh the )) 

288.25 292.66 B: communication wasn't there and every single time we had a fight 

293.37 295.35 B: both of us went the other way 

295.49 302.32 A: yeah yeah especially when you're first married i think that happens a lot and if you can't get past that 

302.73 311.81 A: it just makes it really hard thankfully you know we were in my own experience we were able to say you know this isn't working you know you can't 

311.81 315.41 B: well what got to me was the fact that since he was military 

316.85 323.97 B: he was like okay so both of us are going separate ways we're going on a he's going on deployment 

323.50 324.32 A: [noise] 

324.00 327.83 B: or he's at at deployment and we can't really discuss things 

327.47 332.56 A: mhm yeah that's too funny 'cause my husband's active duty also 

329.07 329.79 B: so 

332.30 333.32 B: (( [mn] )) 

333.03 334.19 A: and the first 

334.33 336.80 A: you know four years we were married 

337.55 340.96 A: and he was always deployed six months at a time 

339.18 340.43 B: right 

341.06 348.14 A: and [noise] it's it's hard it's so hard even even though you know you have email now and you have 

349.80 355.68 A: have the telephone when they're in port it's not the same as being face to face and having that communication 

353.57 354.48 B: right 

355.60 356.96 B: right 

357.02 358.95 A: another thing you know i was 

359.12 363.91 A: didn't really consider before you know i think when you're young and and 

364.07 370.75 A: you fall in love you don't consider things [noise] for the future but as you hear my child screaming 

370.52 371.49 B: [laughter] 

370.80 371.71 A: um 

371.86 374.42 A: you know one thing is you know do you 

374.69 383.65 A: do you want the same things for as far as children you know are you going to marry somebody and have a family i want to have seven kids [laughter] and you go wait no i only want one 

377.53 378.38 B: right 

382.43 383.20 B: yeah 

384.00 384.82 B: right 

384.11 393.53 A: or you know maybe you don't believe in spanking and your husband's like oh no every time that kid does something i'm gonna spank him [laughter] type thing you know so 

391.30 392.17 B: um 

393.96 396.01 A: and that's something you know i never 

396.48 398.45 A: (( even [noise] thought about )) 

398.63 402.10 A: until after i got married and those are things that can cause 

398.88 399.62 B: right 

403.21 405.15 A: you know problems 

407.26 413.73 A: and so that's something to consider too you know you have to what kind of [noise] goals you both 

410.30 411.05 B: right 

414.01 419.00 A: you have common goals for your children and common goals for your life 

419.11 420.19 B: right 

420.25 423.33 A: and even having similar interests i mean 

423.99 425.87 A: i have an aunt and uncle that 

425.92 429.46 A: really you know they didn't have much in common she loved 

430.65 432.93 A: (( to ski and he didn't know how to ski )) 

433.00 442.52 A: ((  )) 

433.02 433.59 B: (( [cough] )) 

441.75 442.98 B: precisely 

442.56 455.55 A: it was like okay that i could see you know i can see that not happening [laughter] that's not gonna be good you know 'cause you you make he has his set of friends she has 

447.39 448.48 B: [laughter] 

449.94 450.80 B: right 

457.97 459.81 A: [noise] 

460.65 461.68 A: um 

462.27 463.42 A: (( [lipsmack] so )) 

463.96 465.20 A: you know they 

465.30 468.94 A: just totally grew apart because they didn't have anything in common 

468.54 469.71 B: right 

469.08 471.87 A: you know so i think similar interests 

472.66 473.87 A: are also 

474.83 477.68 A: very you know very important 

477.50 479.86 B: (( right )) 

477.93 480.66 A: you don't wanna marry somebody 'cause they're cute 

480.66 484.90 A: and you have a warm fuzzy [laughter] 

482.74 485.51 B: [laughter] yeah 

484.86 495.73 A: 'cause you know what the feelings go away and being with somebody forever is work you know it's it's work you you can't you know feelings come and go you may be 

490.42 491.66 B: right 

491.82 493.01 B: precisely 

496.10 501.08 A: way way in love and and say i will always feel like this and then 

501.28 508.20 A: you know you have a bad day at work and they don't wanna help with the dishes and [laughter] you're going i can't stand this 

508.39 509.31 B: right 

509.32 514.11 A: and you know you can't just run out the door so commitment is 

514.35 518.17 A: is a big thing too you know how you know is 

518.55 520.28 A: is the person that you're gonna 

520.70 523.93 A: ma- you know marry or make your life partner 

524.07 525.58 A: are they kind of 

525.99 529.68 A: a flit floaty person that never follows through on anything 

529.74 530.43 B: (( um )) 

530.21 535.12 A: because most likely if they're that way in life they will be that way in the relationship too you 

534.76 535.61 B: right 

535.33 541.16 A: know are they a committed person are they able to stick with something and get it done even when it's hard 

540.97 542.00 B: right 

542.17 544.85 B: i think it's also good if your 

545.30 547.43 B: if your spouse has friends 

547.60 550.11 B: that's not bachelors 

550.24 552.74 A: oh absolutely yeah 

553.10 555.47 A: yeah you know i mean that's 

555.57 561.48 A: people don't think about these things before they before they commit to a relationship and then 

562.24 566.83 A: these little things that you don't consider can be such a big problem 

562.63 563.22 B: (( [noise] )) 

566.56 568.01 B: right 

567.23 574.76 A: because you know their friends are all used to partying and running around and doing whatever they want whenever they want 'cause they're not committed to anybody 

573.32 574.49 B: precisely 

574.80 577.34 A: and if that's his only 

578.01 581.82 A: only people he hangs around with he's the odd man out and 

581.88 585.54 A: he wants to be in with his friends everybody wants to be liked by their friends 

584.64 585.52 B: mhm 

585.60 591.90 A: you know i mean they say peer pressure is for teenagers but they're you know it's there in adults too you 

586.19 587.07 B: right 

592.64 596.86 A: you want your friends to like you [laughter] you wanna have things in common with them 

596.99 598.10 B: right 

598.11 599.89 A: i have a lady at at work who
