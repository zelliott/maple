31.03 42.39 B: you are okay so uh um okay the question is uh what's the most important i guess criteria in picking a life partner is that what you understand too 

31.65 33.00 A: (( yeah i'm just )) 

42.19 44.11 A: (( i guess that's what i understood )) 

44.23 50.94 A: i i would say uh compatibility first of all [laughter] you need that nu- number one 

47.70 49.07 B: [sigh] yeah well it 

50.35 58.40 B: sure that that's probably the uh [mn] er the the biggest uh generality 

58.32 60.30 B: uh but 

60.10 73.37 B: er the compatibility breaks down into many different areas uh it it can be uh [mn] you know family uh status it can be um 

65.01 66.46 A: (( exactly [noise] )) 

73.26 79.08 B: (( uh uh religious uh status um )) 

79.22 80.14 B: [mn] 

80.00 87.64 A: yeah it depends on who you're talking to i mean some people are picky about religious status and some people are not some people are 

87.25 88.89 B: yeah that's what i mean 

87.80 90.23 A: (( it's like yeah so you have to )) 

89.08 91.38 B: so so there's um 

91.61 97.26 B: well the the most important for me would be uh religious uh status 

97.04 97.99 A: [noise] of course 

97.22 110.21 B: uh that i- is uh being a christian we in the bible it it it refers to being evenly yolked it's like um you know the farmer with the with the two oxen 

109.89 110.71 A: (( mhm )) 

110.26 121.31 B: and if they're not in harmony when they're plowing the field i mean the [laughter] field doesn't get plowed and the farmer doesn't eat [laughter] so 

117.48 120.10 A: exactly exactly 

120.23 121.75 A: (( i believe in that [noise] )) 

121.43 132.18 B: um th- th- that's the first thing um but that always doesn't work out either uh it's there's there's more to it than just that uh in other words um 

132.12 142.37 B: i was married i thought i had married somebody in in the same uh religious aspect and uh it turned out that um 

142.51 155.36 B: that wasn't the prevailing um thing about the other person they they weren't uh uh true to the the characteristics of that particular uh 

155.40 158.41 B: principals of that religion so um 

158.88 159.75 B: i 

159.62 166.40 B: [mn] i so so somewhere in there there's got to be something like integrity you see if if you say 

166.31 175.24 B: you are something and you only spend a couple three years trying to get to know the person and then the minute [sigh] um 

169.41 171.26 A: you're not [mn] [noise] 

175.02 182.78 B: you marry them they turn around and throw all that away and go off in another direction i mean that that is just uh 

183.03 187.41 B: well i mean it it it uh it blew my mind for years 

187.19 192.49 A: [noise] [noise] yeah exactly for me it the person has to be 

193.02 206.18 A: somebody that would uphold their word [laughter] because i don't want i don't wanna deal with somebody that gives me this picture and that we're dating right now and and then uh later we're together and it turns out to be a totally different person that i don't know [noise] 

195.10 196.78 B: yeah 

201.55 203.28 B: yeah 

205.43 211.22 B: yeah yeah like like uh [mn] like like the story alway the joke of the girl who uh 

211.07 217.53 B: uh [mn] meets the sportsman and uh sure i'll go fishing and she goes fishing with the guy and uh 

217.31 231.26 B: and uh they finally get married and after they're married six to eight months he says let's go fishing and she says oh all that smelly fishy stuff and sit there in the boat all day not me [laughter] 

226.61 231.23 A: (( [noise] [noise] [laughter] exactly )) 

231.11 232.52 B: yeah yeah 

232.17 235.63 A: i can see that every day you know you see that every day here now [mn] 

235.23 237.14 B: yeah 

236.28 249.51 A: girls and guys even guys not just girls they do that they just want they feel like they want they're physically attracted to somebody and they want to get with them but it just doesn't work like that there's not always physical attraction [noise] 

249.22 263.15 B: yeah the physical attraction that they they're motivated to say uh uh a lot more and condescend to a lot of things like the fishing [laughter] until until um it gets down to 

252.53 253.99 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

259.08 260.19 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

262.99 274.59 B: uh oh cut bait [laughter] yeah and somebody's gotta haul in the fish and and and you get the hook out you see and then all that 

264.02 269.31 A: (( the nitty gritty [laughter] )) 

274.39 283.47 B: so that that is true and i think probably uh [mn] um so so uh as you look at that uh it comes down to something like honesty 

283.63 288.41 B: uh sincerity [mn] would be two aspects of uh 

288.85 299.88 B: of of consistency and in integrity wouldn't it uh being consistent and and uh being truthful and honest and forthright and sincere 

299.97 302.81 B: uh what else would you add 

301.22 310.16 A: [noise] [noise] compassion [laughter] you need i need somebody that's going to be compassionate i don't want i don't want somebody that's gonna be cold blooded [laughter] you know 

309.86 311.19 B: i see so 

311.21 314.56 B: you you want somebody that has a certain amount of empathy 

314.31 318.72 A: yeah i need somebody that is not um afraid of humility 

318.89 323.92 A: and i need somebody that is not stuck up you know what i'm saying i need somebody 

323.94 333.72 A: if they see somebody poor and that that needs something you don't they don't have to come and ask you you go ahead and do it yourself you know i need something of that character i need somebody with a strong character 

331.59 332.42 B: yeah 

333.57 342.15 B: well n- one thing that i found i- in my marriage that i didn't have uh was my my spouse 

342.16 348.13 B: was never willing to say i apologize i'm sorry i made a mistake 

347.60 349.55 A: (( yeah well you can [noise] )) 

348.37 349.31 B: now 

349.50 356.51 B: uh that's that's important because uh we all make 'em lots of them and uh 

356.58 361.63 B: y- you know so the other person just keeps on um 

361.78 367.17 B: and and has no no contrite heart or no humility as you said so uh 

366.61 368.72 A: (( yeah humility's good )) 

367.19 370.33 B: i think those are probably the uh 

370.36 381.45 B: the major things of course all the other things are great the physical attraction and then the uh so much similarity in background speaking the same language what 

376.41 377.05 A: (( mm )) 

377.11 378.04 A: (( of course )) 

380.71 381.91 A: (( of course )) 

382.15 386.78 B: whether it's uh and and some degree of um 

386.82 389.44 B: g- even this in education 

389.29 398.91 A: oh yeah of course education is in there 'cause you don't want um one of you more educated than the other then uh sooner or later somebody's gonna have to feel dumber than the other and feel insulted mm 

394.39 395.81 B: yeah 

397.96 407.98 B: well the woman always feels that way if she gets stuck at home with the kids you know and she has to use a lot of baby talk to the kids and the guy comes home from work and she says what's new and he says 

408.00 411.12 B: you know he doesn't want to regurgitate the day to her 

410.89 415.01 B: so uh all of a sudden you've got a a real dichotomy 

414.81 427.70 B: in in in communications there you know she's been babbling the baby's been babbling all day and she wants to have some outward interest and he doesn't want to talk about business he's now at home so you get that uh 

424.81 425.64 A: (( [sigh] )) 

427.62 432.52 B: that separation there that cleavage and and that's a tough one 

432.30 441.10 A: yeah y- that's you need somebody i also need somebody that would uh if hard times come through like nowadays everybody's losing their jobs 

441.12 447.47 A: and all i'm not gonna lo- i'm not gonna lose her because i lost my job [laughter] you know i need somebody that's uh very e- 

441.76 443.59 B: yeah 

446.42 456.92 B: yeah understanding compa- uh has compassion empathy yeah um and and is realistic about the world yeah that's true uh 

449.09 450.13 A: (( yeah yeah yeah )) 

450.19 450.98 A: (( yeah )) 

456.09 470.93 A: and is awake and and and in tune with the world like as i mean not everybody's going to be having a job the whole their whole life and not every you know you gonna be able to drive a lincoln navigator every day or drive in a limousine every day you know 

464.72 466.49 B: yeah 

469.95 471.60 B: yeah 

471.07 479.52 A: every you know every once in a while you're going to have to do some sacrifices and i need somebody that can understand that expect that something like that that something like that might happen 

475.87 477.58 B: (( yeah )) 

478.93 484.00 B: yeah [sigh] yeah and you've gotta be careful when you're making those decisions that uh 

483.87 489.17 B: the emotions or passion and and uh lust and sex don't overcome 

489.04 500.25 B: uh and and supersede all the that good intellect [mn] and that's tough and yet y- the older you get the the the easier it is uh how old are you 

493.59 495.90 A: (( right yeah )) 

500.34 501.77 A: i'm twenty five 

501.19 505.70 B: okay see i'm seventy two so [laughter] i

507.34 508.00 A: [laughter] 

509.40 522.82 B: um y- y- if you're gonna do it you gotta exercise very carefully you gotta eat right and you gotta do a lot of things with discipline to uh stay the course or otherwise you're gonna drop off along the way 

522.45 524.23 A: yeah 

523.13 535.29 B: yeah and the women my age are are are are just just no way they're shot they're they're opinionated they're uh they're in a rut uh they they're 

535.15 542.91 B: just emotional wr- [mn] an older woman becomes an emotional wreck aw they just turn 

540.09 541.32 A: (( [laughter] yeah ))

542.80 544.51 B: and and um 

544.36 558.38 B: um i've had a couple of them die on me recently because and you can see it coming because and you say to them and uh they don't want to hear or have anything to do with uh what is logical or commonsense 

558.24 566.07 B: and that and it's always bothered me why the man goes off on a logical basis and a woman stays emotional and then as she gets older 

566.12 574.80 B: she cannot pl- uh practise the disciplines of good health to stay uh phys- uh fit 

572.93 576.57 A: yeah it's different [laughter] okay
