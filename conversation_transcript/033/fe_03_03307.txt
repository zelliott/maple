0.68 1.91 A: hello 

1.38 2.59 B: hello 

2.15 4.20 A: hi my name is denise 

3.53 4.90 B: my name is debbie 

4.52 5.74 A: hi 

6.38 12.62 A: uh so our topic is what is the most important thing to look for in a life partner 

12.15 13.33 B: right 

13.66 15.18 A: um 

15.33 19.99 A: well i'm married i've been married almost ten years and um 

20.31 26.08 A: [lipsmack] i guess there are a lot of things that um go into being compatible with somebody um i 

27.06 28.79 A: guess similar values 

28.65 31.27 B: right i would say compatibility would be the 

31.31 33.18 B: most important thing to look for 

33.14 34.71 A: yeah 

35.86 38.02 B: i've been married for eighteen years 

37.57 38.84 A: um oh okay 

40.37 51.66 A: um certainly having a child uh changes a relationship so having similar views on how to raise children is a big part of uh compatibility i find um [lipsmack] 

50.96 52.17 B: right 

57.03 67.38 A: it's sometimes it's surprising though people can have long relationships even if you think they're not compatible sometimes people can be compatible in surprising ways [laughter] 

66.94 69.25 B: right i've seen that [laughter] 

68.37 71.39 A: right like you don't have to be similar to be compatible 

71.18 72.23 B: right 

72.90 74.66 B: i would say trust 

74.94 76.83 B: and respect for one another 

76.48 77.55 A: mhm 

77.75 79.66 B: would be an important factor 

79.20 81.49 A: mhm i agree yeah 

87.60 89.75 A: sometimes having a sense of humour 

89.50 91.19 B: mhm 

90.06 94.16 A: [laughter] and uh enjoying each other's sense of humour can 

93.37 95.59 B: right making time for each other 

94.29 97.29 A: be very important yeah 

96.69 99.85 B: that's it gets difficult once children come along 

99.67 101.33 A: mhm yeah 

102.18 103.26 A: yeah 

105.63 112.46 A: yeah and and like you said respect for the other person that's that's very important for people who have differences 

112.51 114.54 A: to respect their differences 

113.10 116.66 B: (( mhm )) 

115.17 116.95 A: (( and try to )) 

117.45 119.86 A: agree to disagree sometimes 

119.91 120.59 B: (( hm )) 

122.69 130.56 B: i've um [lipsmack] read in a book one time and the thing that has stuck with me that has really meant a lot is something um 

130.00 130.58 A: (( mhm )) 

131.60 135.49 B: a relationship has a lot to do with how you make your 

135.96 138.43 B: significant other feel about themselves 

138.72 140.03 B: and um 

140.47 146.26 B: i've given a lot of thought to that i think that is so true and if you are not making each other feel good 

146.48 148.91 B: about the other you know about themselves 

149.07 150.74 B: then i think 

151.07 156.18 B: it causes problems if if if that is happening if you're making each other feel good then 

156.55 158.97 B: usually you've got a very good relationship 

158.72 161.07 A: uh-huh that's a good point yeah 

161.80 164.09 B: if you uh keep that in mind 

164.16 165.80 B: on a daily basis 

166.18 170.91 B: it makes it makes for a wonderful relationship if you're both doing that i think 

168.62 169.61 A: uh-huh 

170.62 171.57 A: uh-huh 

171.74 175.87 A: yeah that's a good point because you have to feel good about yourself 

176.44 180.16 A: in order to be happy and to treat other people well 

179.88 181.00 B: mhm 

180.95 186.30 A: and the way other treat people treat you is going to affect the way you feel yeah that's a good point 

184.33 185.40 B: right 

187.04 189.26 A: something to think about 

190.44 192.51 A: but it can be hard when uh 

193.60 199.04 A: you know if you don't know somebody very well and if you're trying to decide if [laughter] if you're compatible or not 

198.65 199.58 B: yeah 

199.28 201.07 A: that can uh you know 

201.30 203.15 A: that can be a tough situation 

202.75 209.67 B: i haven't been in the dating scene for so many years i don't even know [laughter] i can't imagine 

206.34 207.80 A: [laughter] 

212.77 216.51 B: but i got married when i was very young i don't think that we 

216.73 218.04 B: i know i didn't 

218.07 220.83 B: think about those things so much um 

220.97 226.08 B: at that time i've been with my husband since i was seventeen years old and um 

224.16 225.20 A: mhm 

226.42 232.94 B: at that age you're just not thinking about are you compatible you know do you have compatible views on child rearing and 

233.10 235.97 B: things like that we didn't even think about those things 

235.36 237.37 A: those are more like longterm 

237.48 241.53 B: right and i've got um two of my sister in laws are 

237.61 238.99 A: questions 

241.96 248.93 B: f- about forty years old and neither one of them is married and they talk about dating and they think about all those things 

244.85 246.13 A: mhm 

248.62 249.72 A: mhm 

249.04 255.77 B: and in some ways it's funny because because all those things are you know they're older and 

254.61 255.70 A: mhm 

256.36 258.16 B: mm wiser but 

258.18 260.04 B: they they put so much 

260.48 269.77 B: thought into those types of things when they're dating i think a lot of times it it keeps them from from finding a life partner you know or 

264.00 265.24 A: mhm 

268.27 269.43 A: yeah 

270.52 272.16 B: um [sigh] 

272.18 280.03 B: at forty years old one of my sister in laws desperately wants to get married and have a baby but she hasn't found the right person yet and she 

279.08 285.13 A: that's interesting has she been doing um has she been trying to meet people online 'cause i have a lot of friends who are doing that i'm just curious what 

282.41 283.46 B: (( she has )) 

284.55 295.24 B: she has and i would think that that would you know break a big barrier because you can feel more comfortable asking those types of probing questions than you would in an actual face to face date 

294.55 297.27 A: right right so did she did she 

297.31 300.45 A: find that was successful was she happy meeting people that way 

300.49 304.47 B: um yeah she's had some success but she just recently had a 

304.48 307.55 B: breakup with a fellow that she was dating for quite some time 

307.69 315.67 B: um mostly because he had been married before and had children and and decided he didn't want any more and that's definitely something she wants so 

315.99 321.31 B: they ended the relationship even though in every other aspect they felt very compatible 

325.20 326.36 B: (( but um )) 

327.04 337.41 B: i i don't know sometimes i think there's pros and cons to putting so much effort into making sure you're you know that compatible i think it keeps them from 

337.78 343.33 B: from getting into longterm relationships and that's what they so desperately desire but [laughter] 

342.44 345.06 A: mhm uh-huh interesting do you think like maybe they're being too choosy 

344.29 350.91 B: [laughter] maybe i don't know i just think it was easier for me because i didn't think about those things 

349.76 351.25 A: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

350.98 355.67 B: and had i thought about those things i might be in the same boat and never married i don't know 

355.10 357.02 A: [laughter] 

355.81 357.36 B: [laughter] 

360.53 362.20 B: but we've just kind of 

362.22 365.33 B: worked out those things as we've gone along 

365.07 366.03 A: mhm 

365.71 374.88 B: and uh in some ways that i think makes for a stronger relationship too because you work you know you work at your relationship and the relationship is work 

374.45 378.17 A: yes it certainly is things are always changing 

375.24 378.04 B: and you can't go into it expecting 

378.31 386.65 B: expecting to be a hundred percent compatible on every aspect or viewpoint sometimes you know you have to make concessions and compromise and 

385.98 387.17 A: right right 

389.36 390.28 A: yeah 

391.52 394.57 B: and um they just seem these you know 

395.34 399.15 B: two women that i know they're in their forties seem less 

400.16 410.21 B: less uh [sigh] i don't know what the right word is pliable or less apt to want to compromise you know they get se- old and set in their ways i guess 

406.63 407.55 A: uh-huh 

410.03 410.92 A: uh-huh 

410.85 416.23 B: and um i definitely wasn't old and set in my ways [laughter] when i 

414.81 415.67 A: uh-huh 

416.31 419.57 B: when i started out so in some ways i think it made it easier 

417.39 418.25 A: uh-huh 

419.33 420.53 A: (( ah interesting )) 

422.93 427.53 A: well i ha- i have a friend who's um marrying somebody she met through um 

427.72 429.25 A: through online dating 

429.34 430.43 A: and she 

430.60 443.67 A: she had gone through like about forty or fifty other men that she had very brief dates with and she seemed to have like perfected the science of eliminating people [laughter] 

436.06 437.21 B: mhm 

442.30 444.54 B: well have you heard of speed dating 

444.38 445.66 A: no what is that 

445.75 457.11 B: a- apparently it's they usually will set it up as a singles things like in at a restaurant or something like that and they've got you know the same number of men there as they do women 

457.14 460.42 B: and you're to sit with each 

460.60 465.08 B: woman or man in the room for a set period of time like ten minutes 

464.84 465.71 A: uh-huh 

465.45 468.32 B: and then you're moved to the next guy [laughter] 

467.38 469.41 A: really interesting 

468.82 470.12 B: and um 

470.13 474.82 A: so you have ten minutes to make your move and [laughter] 

470.17 470.90 B: it's 

471.59 472.65 B: yeah to 

472.81 477.66 B: right just to talk to somebody and see you know if if you'd be interested in in 

475.38 477.99 A: see if you can get their phone number or whatever [laughter] 

477.90 479.59 B: a second date or something 

480.13 485.20 B: but you just get these you know little ten minute time frames and 

482.01 483.14 A: interesting 

484.58 489.29 A: boy that's perfect for the age of people with short attention spans who you know 

488.04 490.61 B: yeah it is but and i could see where somebody 

489.37 493.63 A: [laughter] who channel surf it's like channel surfing through life [laughter] 

492.28 499.55 B: right you could definitely you know perfect going through all those questions but i think it would be an awful ten minutes to be 

499.82 503.73 B: you know okay you'd have to give each other five minutes to just kinda 

503.82 506.01 B: bombard each other with questions 

505.67 506.57 A: right 

506.97 509.72 B: and i don't know i don't know if i'd like that [laughter] 

512.23 513.22 A: (( ah yeah )) 

514.39 522.76 A: yeah i how how well can you know somebody in the first ten minutes i mean that's that's evaluating somebody based completely on your first impression 

522.45 525.05 B: (( right and )) 

522.86 523.75 A: (( [laughter] )) 

526.62 527.31 A: hm 

526.68 528.75 B: they say those are very important 

528.95 532.63 B: the first two minutes uh you know first impressions 

532.47 533.54 A: yeah 

533.63 536.43 B: i would i would agree that's probably true 

536.69 537.35 A: (( mm )) 

537.08 540.37 B: unless you've got somebody who's just very persistent that just 

543.11 547.39 B: doesn't give up even though you're not wild with them in at first you know 

547.07 547.92 A: uh-huh 

548.86 554.59 B: you tend to just kind of shut 'em off and tur- tune them out unless and unless they were persistent you probably wouldn't 

554.52 555.36 A: right 

556.91 558.38 B: give 'em a second thought 

558.50 559.39 A: mhm 

562.62 564.98 A: [laughter] ten minutes ah that's funny 

564.65 566.12 B: [laughter] 

568.00 570.17 A: imagine if you did that with friends 

570.00 571.45 B: that would be funny 

570.88 573.18 A: [laughter] 

571.67 572.59 B: [laughter] 

574.45 579.46 A: oh we didn't become friends because ah i didn't like the shirt she was wearing or whatever [laughter] 

578.19 579.82 B: [laughter] 

580.80 582.39 A: i knew it wasn't going to work 

582.09 584.16 B: [laughter] 

582.64 583.68 A: [laughter] 

585.10 586.35 A: i could just tell 

591.44 594.77 A: you know it doesn't give a chance to relationships where 

595.01 598.78 A: you know surprises can come out and you can 

599.30 599.95 A: sometimes
