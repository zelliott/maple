144.75 145.71 B: mhm 

149.15 150.56 B: [laughter] 

150.87 157.11 B: oh okay yeah [laughter] you're in you were looking for someone a little submissive [laughter] 

155.80 159.25 A: i think so [laughter] uh a- 

157.78 160.78 B: yeah my my mom wears the pants in the family too 

160.91 174.75 B: like that and uh yeah i guess i would look for someone who wanted to do like things that i wanted to but also would have a clue as to what they were interested or c- c- you know can show me new things as well but usually i'm the social coordinator or 

174.84 178.17 B: i like people who go along with my ideas [laughter] also [laughter] 

177.10 184.97 A: and that's the same my husband just happily goes to whatever like what are we doing today because he knows i've already figured it out or 

182.22 183.49 B: right 

184.63 191.99 B: oh yeah yeah sometimes sometimes i have like a book or you know calendar out and say this is really interesting you know i'd like to do this this and this so 

192.06 198.53 B: i guess i sort of look for someone who has similar tastes who as they say you know would compromise and whatever or 

198.79 209.99 B: or you know someone who doesn't really together aggravate me too much or doesn't spend too much time in the bathroom you know isn't too vain i guess or i'm now i'm starting to look for 

210.00 215.25 B: types who who aren't what i've experienced before like i learned what i'm not looking for 

216.01 217.86 B: so i know what to rule out 

217.94 224.86 A: exactly i would it would only take a- and i've told all my girls growing up 

219.02 220.19 B: [laughter] 

224.16 225.54 B: mhm 

225.47 232.46 A: everything that they've probably everything they already knew uh seen on t._v. or whatever but when they were dating if 

230.16 231.22 B: mhm 

232.74 242.12 A: the your date ever laid a hand on you raised his hand to you this was that's it don't go it it'll [laughter] just keep moving along 

236.75 237.55 B: right 

238.92 240.04 B: yeah 

242.33 243.67 B: right it's there 

242.37 243.89 A: because uh 

244.94 246.18 A: i know 

245.33 246.53 B: are other people 

246.44 252.45 A: right there are women that wouldn't mind somebody telling them what to do so to speak but 

252.56 256.58 A: it wouldn't be me and that would be something i would rule out immediately 

252.63 253.71 B: mhm 

254.60 255.44 B: good 

256.87 264.40 B: oh yeah that's good me too it's just like i've had people who who have just a- acted outrageously and acted uncalled for 

264.45 271.84 B: and i don't need that i don't need the aggravation and i'd rather just have a much simp- simpler life where you can i've only been sort of 

271.91 281.45 B: out the gate for about a decade now dating and whatnot and i'm still looking [laughter] it takes some time or i talked to my mom as well and it's just a 

281.64 287.33 B: it's a difficult thing to get around yeah all right i'm trying not to look t- really right now and just 

287.87 289.77 B: and enjoying time with myself 

290.31 291.61 B: (( so )) 

291.71 294.78 B: um but i know what to run away from [laughter] 

294.70 296.08 A: well that's good 

295.95 296.90 B: (( never )) 

297.03 298.62 B: um comes my way 

298.40 299.39 A: no 

299.56 304.07 A: again i didn't know it at the time but stability is a very good thing 

301.90 302.68 B: mhm 

304.25 307.20 B: oh yes i had many an unstable type 

307.45 313.38 A: because uh i wouldn't want someone that would change jobs every week or [laughter] 

312.79 318.77 B: mhm yeah i i've already had certain things where i with people or you know i've been the one that's 

319.01 321.79 B: held up my end of the game and 

322.10 326.17 B: you know it you know and i don't need to take care of anybody i guess 

326.64 330.46 B: and so that's what i'm looking for somebody who can actually take care of themselves 

330.47 332.87 A: right and contribute to the household 

332.71 337.42 B: (( mm exactly a lot of people think and like you do everything )) 

339.47 342.71 B: so i don't know if it's always been that way or are young men nowadays 

343.23 348.15 B: i hate to but some of them are just darn useless it seems uh-hum [laughter] 

346.59 350.90 A: yeah and my husband he shares in everything i mean not only 

351.12 354.05 A: to the household but the household chores too 

354.13 359.64 A: i mean he thinks nothing of getting up and doing a load of laundry if he sees me doing something else or 

357.82 368.42 B: good [laughter] yeah my mom was slightly that way too my dad cooks he cleans he mows the lawn [laughter] they take turns cooking and everything and they both 

360.17 360.77 A: (( ah )) 

360.94 362.46 A: dishes i mean 

368.44 377.13 B: are very good at it you know they're going from each other so and also i guess a lot of people look for people who were like their parents or are good examples 

377.56 378.42 B: or 

378.50 382.22 B: you know there are people whose parents aren't a good example and i dare say they would 

382.36 384.37 B: lean towards something different 

384.89 389.91 B: but uh yeah i guess i'm looking for a you know somebody who's who will be a good member of a team 

390.36 391.40 A: yes 

390.86 395.92 B: who who can pull their own weight who like you said can contribute and what not 

396.04 403.74 B: so that's good i'm glad to hear thirty years is quite some time and i'm glad you're still going strong and doing things together and it 

403.99 407.42 A: yes and in this case it was the second marriage for both of us 

404.38 405.41 B: sounds like you 

407.27 410.16 B: oh really yeah sometimes you you learn [laughter]

412.18 415.20 A: uh we've had no problems i mean 

415.00 415.82 B: uh-huh

418.50 422.20 B: oh uh do when you met each other yeah how many girls do you have 

419.93 420.80 A: (( uh uh-huh ))

424.07 430.51 B: [laughter] wow that's a good bunch or what did you learn that you didn't want from your first marriages or what 

430.62 431.58 A: (( uh )) 

430.91 433.57 B: is different the second time around 

433.67 435.68 B: what were you looking for after that 

434.24 436.29 A: the first time it was for l- 

436.48 439.60 A: i don't know i just wh- i think i was very young 

439.61 440.94 B: mhm [laughter] 

440.19 444.36 A: and [laughter] this was the first major boyfriend 

443.91 444.84 B: right 

444.70 446.15 A: and 

446.75 449.19 A: even th- although that lasted six years 

449.07 454.30 B: oh my goodness you made it over the statistic of the under five years [laughter] 

449.71 450.62 A: but 

451.86 457.36 A: yeah and it was just uh he changed uh 

457.54 458.39 B: (( uh-huh )) 

457.74 461.24 A: he he beca- he was a manic depressive and it didn't 

458.58 459.33 B: (( [noise] )) 

460.37 461.22 B: ooh 

461.68 463.85 A: come out until that sixth year 

463.88 468.23 A: and w- we just couldn't deal with it because i was afraid for my child 

464.03 464.95 B: yeah 

468.49 470.24 B: okay yeah that's no good 

469.29 471.15 A: because he was turning violent 

472.18 475.22 A: so before anything happened 

475.70 478.14 A: probably i shouldn't have but i said goodbye 

478.17 481.62 B: ooh mhm well yeah it's good you were wise enough to you know 

479.08 479.73 A: (( ah )) 

481.24 484.80 A: that was such a long time ago i mean uh 

481.78 483.03 B: nip it in the bud 

484.81 487.35 A: i don't know that they i would have done it 

487.38 491.60 A: if it were in today's time because i know they have so many newer 

491.66 493.48 A: drugs to control things 

493.65 494.28 B: (( mhm )) 

494.38 495.60 A: but uh 

495.04 497.97 B: right it's difficult to care for someone who 

498.86 500.87 B: who isn't in control or they can't 

500.19 501.17 A: right 

500.98 504.57 B: can't control themselves who doesn't can't get help to control themselves 

504.72 506.49 A: ah but uh 

508.47 509.37 A: uh 

509.77 513.20 A: i don't know where was i going with that conversation [laughter]

513.96 517.26 B: figure out like what you're you know what were you looking for that was different 

517.59 519.46 B: after your first experience or 

517.87 519.20 A: it was different [laughter] 

519.71 522.19 B: yeah you know or things you've 

522.55 523.20 B: (( you )) 

523.42 525.30 B: know look for people who can 

526.07 527.03 B: (( ah )) 

527.21 532.42 B: you know who don't have to get out of hand and aren't too needy or 

533.11 533.93 A: no 

533.12 534.96 B: nor violent like you said 

534.63 538.06 A: right now i know for some people 

538.05 539.02 B: (( mhm )) 

538.18 542.65 A: not for me necessarily but for some people race is a a big thing 

542.74 545.58 A: religion could be a big thing um 

542.80 543.53 B: uh-huh 

544.90 545.99 B: right 

546.18 549.39 A: uh for me religion is not a big thing at all [laughter] 

549.42 555.02 A: actually in neither cases i have no idea why it just turned out that way but 

554.55 556.77 B: (( [noise] right )) 

555.03 558.97 A: both my hus- both husbands were jewish and i'm catholic 

558.41 564.32 B: oh really wow [laughter] it's like that's right new york offers so many different kinds and types and 

560.71 561.69 A: (( [laughter] so )) 

564.43 567.16 B: (( yeah i'm i'm not religious )) 

567.44 569.78 B: any front really the 

569.91 575.13 B: individual is someone you know considerate and it can be an individual 

573.47 576.12 A: right neither person came first 

575.97 579.36 B: mhm right an- an- any of those other factors really 

578.71 584.68 A: and i think everybody brings brings back into a marriage of some sort or another but 

579.50 580.65 B: are an important 

583.06 583.77 B: (( mm )) 

585.39 586.30 A: (( um )) 

585.68 586.86 B: right 

587.35 589.07 A: it's a growing process 

589.70 590.80 A: and 

589.80 599.89 B: yeah yeah it it definitely takes some time i tell myself that i just really won't make any big decisions on being with someone unless i knew them for a very long time
