203.40 205.82 B: (( mhm )) 

204.42 211.13 A: but he but he likes to be in- involved even when i say you know you don't have to worry about this i'll handle this all by myself he still

211.70 214.54 A: he he has an opinion about it you know 

213.81 216.11 B: oh that's great

221.96 223.65 B: mhm 

222.96 223.84 A: so 

224.13 225.41 A: i don't know 

226.34 231.79 A: um i would i would to say you know personal habits are real important to me 

231.41 232.92 B: mhm 

231.96 233.94 A: um 

234.05 236.21 A: in in meeting people in general 

236.72 247.54 B: well tell me this like example um in my experience like an example with my ex he's a good person it's just that we just clashed we just 

247.71 257.72 B: clashed something awful our backgrounds are different the same way you say that you have to think alike he and i think total opposites everything is opposite if i say 

248.38 250.56 A: (( mhm )) 

256.12 258.02 A: yeah opposites attract though 

258.04 262.50 B: y- yeah but um yeah they can but i think 

262.59 264.59 B: what hurt us is 

264.68 272.34 B: i'm a big city girl i'm from new york originally and i've traveled all around and i'm 

270.45 276.26 A: (( yeah )) 

272.55 280.56 B: totally open-minded he's a small town boy closed minded and so 

281.17 285.45 B: it's okay for opposites to attract but i think we were too opposite and 

285.51 287.69 A: yeah should've left it at dating huh 

287.22 294.78 B: we should've left it at dating and my i should've been open instead of closed so now when i date my eyes are wide open 

291.36 292.32 A: (( [laughter] )) 

295.25 296.73 B: [laughter] 

295.28 299.42 A: yeah you know it's ironic because um [lipsmack] 

300.07 302.92 A: when i had a sociology class when i was in high school 

302.40 303.72 B: mhm 

303.13 304.24 A: and 

304.40 307.18 A: the the teacher laid out the stats 

307.20 308.66 A: chances are 

308.34 310.44 B: (( mhm )) 

308.72 318.15 A: you know he laid you know ninety percent of everyone who gets married marries somebody within from within two miles of their home and i mean it was 

318.36 319.70 A: it was real 

319.88 323.31 A: um you know the same religion and you know stuff like that 

323.52 325.46 B: oh 

324.79 327.66 A: so it turns out that 

328.68 335.01 A: i met my husband across the street from where i was living in chicago i grew up in chicago 

335.03 337.29 A: i met him across the street 

336.57 337.89 B: (( what )) 

337.99 338.89 A: (( and )) 

339.74 345.06 A: he was living in the suburb within probably two miles 

345.14 349.00 A: uh four at the most of where my parents were moving to 

347.65 350.24 B: (( no way )) 

349.56 352.70 A: but it it turns out he used to live 

352.88 358.13 A: approximately two miles from where i was living at the time where i grew up 

358.44 366.13 A: so we really did have very much the same background and he was friends with my high school friends for years and i never met him 

366.52 368.69 B: isn't that something 

367.79 369.51 A: it was real 

370.00 377.98 A: yeah talk about fated kind- kind of a fated thing so we come from very much the same background too 

371.61 372.88 B: yeah 

377.68 383.89 B: so you're not gonna clash at all because your your v- the way you see things are are so similar 

383.79 390.21 A: i yeah i think so and it's it's funny because um just being in the environment that we're in now 

390.42 396.26 A: um [lipsmack] our girls have grown up with completely different ideas 

396.46 405.12 A: much more open minded than we were raised i mean i i mean i mean i grew up basically sixties and the seventies i became very open-minded but 

404.28 405.42 B: mhm 

405.73 409.64 A: um my girls you know never have 

410.25 420.97 A: they they have like no um [lipsmack] they have no race issues they have no religion issues they don't care who's what as long as you're nice and you know what that's how my girls think but 

413.86 415.16 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

417.87 419.10 B: mhm 

421.07 423.82 A: but um what we do notice is 

424.53 431.86 A: we live in a you know we live in i don't know if you've ever heard of dupage county in illinois it's the highest in like all of illinois you know 

428.83 429.55 B: mhm 

431.19 432.98 B: (( oh wow )) 

432.04 434.85 A: um and not everybody there is a 

435.20 438.27 A: an extremely diverse socioeconomic 

438.90 449.23 A: group here i mean we have just everything but um there are more there are people who at least um strive to have more than have not 

447.62 449.33 B: (( mhm )) 

449.63 453.05 A: and my and and economically our girls think 

453.81 458.29 A: you know like the well never runs dry you know so 

455.97 458.89 B: (( mhm )) 

458.64 461.79 A: economically they think different 'cause my husband and i were raised 

462.30 466.90 A: pretty frugally you know yeah 

463.34 466.18 B: mm yeah see i was raised that way too 

466.63 471.43 B: and i happened to live [cough] in fairfax county virginia 

471.66 476.23 B: which is the highest the richest um suburb of d. c. 

474.22 476.32 A: i have heard of that 

476.53 482.42 A: yeah i think that's been on like some murder mystery shows that i watch very rich people 

476.68 477.84 B: yeah 

482.02 489.49 B: right million dollar homes and stuff like that yeah mhm so i understand what you're saying 

484.20 486.63 A: yes yes exactly 

489.20 494.12 A: yeah the kids the kids didn't turn out with the same kind of economic sensibility 

493.67 494.94 B: mhm 

494.20 496.03 A: for some reason i don't know 

496.22 500.32 B: so you think because of that then they're 

500.55 512.82 B: um success and planning are made or um think that may impose on it or unless they end up with someone that's well off or whatever then it's okay 

511.27 517.29 A: right right you know what if you are if you don't think the same about money as your mate 

516.48 517.50 B: yes 

518.23 519.22 A: (( [mn] )) 

518.31 530.19 B: i know it's a nightmare i know actually that was the least of our problems because my ex was just as frugal as i was when i met him he drove an old beat up car and so did i 

526.44 528.79 A: (( that's )) 

529.85 530.79 A: mhm 

530.15 542.42 B: i met him in college anyway and um now he's doing well he's got you know twelve acres and a five bedroom home and everything but i'm just not in it anymore [laughter] but um 

538.51 539.47 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

540.64 542.02 A: yeah 

543.09 549.57 B: so our ideas are different actually i don't think that's gonna be a problem for my son either because um 

550.00 555.79 B: we don't buy him everything that he wants you know so and um 

552.97 554.00 A: mhm 

554.35 555.12 A: mhm 

555.81 563.11 B: being that he's in the country he learns about working for money and stuff like that so that helps too 

562.81 564.22 A: yeah that's good 

563.84 565.02 B: mhm 

564.45 570.60 A: but that is definitely um another issue if you can't agree on how to spend your money and save your money 

569.03 570.21 B: right 

570.99 580.06 B: they say that mon- isn't money supposed to be the number one reason for break up anyway in a marriage i think they did a poll and money was number one 

579.73 585.91 A: i don't i don't doubt it i don't doubt it at all i know a lotta people can can forgive um 

581.26 582.50 B: mhm 

582.85 584.11 B: mhm 

586.25 588.25 A: (( uh adultery )) 

588.31 589.93 A: y- you know easier 

589.37 590.66 B: right 

590.08 591.42 A: you know which 

592.54 594.09 A: [lipsmack] oh i don't know 

594.16 596.00 A: after twenty five years 

596.06 598.36 A: our our joke is 

598.45 599.89 A: we would've gotten divorced a long
