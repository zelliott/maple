6.70 9.68 A: um i'm from california where are you from 

9.34 10.62 B: um seattle 

10.88 15.04 A: so what do you think's the most important thing to look for in a life partner 

14.82 17.90 B: um let me see probably 

18.17 19.49 B: um 

19.53 24.31 B: personality common interests and uh yeah [laughter] what would you say 

24.39 26.13 A: have you um 

26.59 29.91 A: i i oh gosh i think that 

30.20 32.86 A: if you feel a strong connection with them 

33.13 39.67 A: just i guess yeah that's the main thing have you found a life partner or have you have you thought that you did at one point 

39.48 43.71 B: um no i'm only seventeen so [laughter] 

43.22 44.49 A: (( seventeen )) 

44.28 45.47 B: yeah 

45.28 47.34 A: so have you been in love before 

47.10 48.27 B: um 

48.62 60.19 B: no i don't think in love i i don't know i think i probably love people but i'm probably not in love with them and as far as like a relationship wise goes no have you [laughter] 

58.48 59.43 A: uh-huh 

59.55 63.23 A: um yeah actually i'm engaged i'm twenty six so 

62.33 64.30 B: oh that's good 

64.38 66.55 B: so congratulations [laughter] 

64.55 73.58 A: yeah so well thank you yeah i guess i the way i found my life partner was just really uh serendipitous i didn't find him 

73.93 82.07 A: like looking for him or whatever like we were just in a class together and we started talking and started hanging out and then i think like 

82.41 83.43 A: i think 

83.64 93.69 A: i i from the pretty early on the outside i figured that i that he would be a possible life partner but i really just had to see how it was going and then 

93.80 95.72 A: um i think the 

95.80 102.19 A: point at which i knew it was like where it felt like he was like my family like i was so close to him that he felt like family 

102.01 103.07 B: mhm 

102.21 107.37 A: you know like and that anyway i guess it just went from there but do you think um 

108.13 111.74 A: but do you think um money's important or 

111.64 123.34 B: um i think money is important to a certain extent i mean as long as you're able to support yourself and like contribute like at least you know a little bit to another person that would probably be a good thing but 

121.95 122.58 A: (( [cough] [cough] )) 

123.11 130.39 B: i don't think money is the most important part of finding a life partner and definitely not i mean it's not going to get you that much 

130.68 137.97 B: really i mean it's not going to make you h- happy or anything if you have whole lots of money if you know you're ha- not happy with your life partner so 

137.45 147.31 A: i know i know yeah i have just heard somewhere that that's like the number one reason that couples break up is 'cause they argue about money problems so 

146.62 148.90 B: mm yeah i believe that 

147.56 149.33 A: (( yeah )) 

149.54 150.96 B: um [laughter] 

150.70 153.00 A: (( [laughter] )) 

151.32 155.46 B: do you think looks play a very powerful role in 

155.71 157.81 B: when you found your fiancee 

158.24 165.22 A: uh no not at all we're both musicians so it actually but i one thing that i was pretty 

161.54 162.43 B: uh-huh 

165.44 174.51 A: that i really wanted him to do was get his degree but actually that's not as important to me any more now but actually then he went ahead and he is getting his degree but 

174.20 175.18 B: yeah 

174.30 181.85 A: like for a couple of years back i was like no i won't marry you unless you get your degree so i don't know do you think that like schooling's important or 

178.44 179.72 B: [laughter] 

181.64 190.68 B: um yeah to a certain extent but i think that someone should definitely go with whatever they w- whatever they're going to be happy with i mean 

191.02 203.97 B: i don't plan i mean for my own personal experience i mean i don't plan on going and finding you know my future career like right after high school or something i mean once you find your job that you're going to have i mean it's you life sentence you're stuck with it for the rest of your life 

203.84 207.47 B: so if the person's happy with what they're doing then 

207.49 212.80 B: let him you know continue to do so until they just need a change or something but 

212.93 214.38 A: right right 

214.68 216.22 B: yeah [laughter] 

216.14 218.51 A: [laughter] what about i don't know whether they're 

218.52 219.88 A: or they're like 

219.69 233.88 A: life partner how about like family like would you would you choose like let's say you have someone that you wanted to marry or but you know have a life partnership with and they their family was totally crazy like what would you think like would you still marry them or 

233.54 247.43 B: well if their family like influenced their choices and like views and if they acted like completely differently whenever they are around like me and the family then probably yeah that would probably change my opinion of them for the worst 

247.27 248.86 B: if they weren't like 

249.06 251.30 B: uh that like 

251.52 258.75 B: was like what kind of an individual they are like if their family and that's crazy [laughter] plays like that big of a role i probably wouldn't 

258.78 263.16 B: you know think too highly of them as far as that stuff goes how about you 

263.42 265.24 A: um i think that 

265.54 269.55 A: um yeah i think family's pretty important 'cause like you seriously 

269.85 273.72 A: have to deal with them for like the rest of your life you know so 

272.99 274.28 B: yeah 

273.77 275.60 A: i think um 

276.01 280.40 A: yeah i think also i don't know like well with my partner my life partner 

280.25 282.62 A: that we've chosen recently is 

281.33 282.29 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

282.48 297.44 A: is there like they're not really a huge part of his life anyway like he loves his family but they're not like in his face all the time so actually that works out really well so we can just like have our lives and not worry about it but um 

291.23 292.12 B: uh-huh 

296.30 297.65 B: that's good 

297.49 303.36 A: yeah yeah i don't know are there any other things that we can thing of that are like [laughter] 

301.82 307.50 B: uh well it's just life partners that's it that was like the only topic 

306.31 309.90 A: [sigh] yeah like what is what is the most uh 

309.95 314.89 A: what's important to look for in a life partner what are the most th- the things that are most important 

314.66 321.20 B: um maybe figuring out before you marry them or get too involved in them or whatever that 

321.30 327.32 B: like if they'd want to have kids or adopt or anything that would probably be a fairly important thing 

327.39 332.55 A: yeah that's true actually yeah my mom her first marriage it broke up because 

332.77 335.62 A: 'cause um he didn't want to have kids and she did 

335.38 336.74 B: yeah 

336.75 339.49 B: yeah i've heard quite a few stories of that happening where 

337.11 338.11 A: so 

339.56 344.27 B: someone wants to have kids and they just didn't talk about it before they ended up getting married or 

344.67 346.69 B: becoming life partners [laughter] 

347.40 348.18 B: yeah 

347.46 350.15 A: yeah so 

348.61 349.49 B: (( hm )) 

350.34 353.97 A: well that's all i can really think of [laughter] 

352.90 359.65 B: [laughter] what about your views for like um like gay couples or something 

359.97 363.02 B: for their life partnerships yeah 

360.85 363.39 A: (( oh for gay couples um )) 

364.17 372.17 A: you know i think that not really knowing a whole lot about that sort of thing i guess it would be the same issues but um 

371.66 372.61 B: mhm 

373.26 382.89 A: but yeah i think if you're someone oh i know i can think of something i think a really important factor is if they support your goals in life 

382.75 383.71 B: mhm 

383.45 387.76 A: like let's say that you and your life partner like 

387.78 390.80 A: he got a really good job you know in another country
