140.41 141.66 A: yeah 

142.11 148.86 B: you know i mean the other qualities fall in there too but i think with the um honesty and the communication 

149.27 152.59 B: uh it's just really really important 

152.66 153.63 B: because 

152.87 154.54 A: well yeah 

154.18 160.82 B: you know if you if you don't have the communication everything breaks because you just don't know where you're going 

161.02 165.47 B: and uh with the honesty if you're not honest with each other of course then 

161.22 162.40 A: mhm 

165.56 169.13 B: you know you have that trust factor that gets in there 

169.19 170.56 B: and um 

170.75 177.05 B: [lipsmack] i from you know just experience my husband uh and i got married in nineteen eighty nine 

177.21 181.08 B: and uh a very good guy very generous um 

181.23 188.74 B: very loving um you know just just a real gentleman type of person and um 

188.91 195.00 B: after eleven years of marriage uh he decided that he didn't love me anymore and wanted to go his own way 

195.57 204.42 B: so after thirteen years uh he went he divorced me and that was just recently in july i didn't find out about it until september 

204.48 205.87 B: and um 

205.99 211.62 B: yeah i just kept thinking the communication you know you've gotta keep the communication up but when one person 

211.79 213.29 B: doesn't want to 

213.36 216.74 B: it makes it very very difficult and um 

216.92 222.95 B: the honesty part you know is is a struggle when people stop being that way 

222.98 235.39 B: so i think for um you know the different marriages that i've seen um the ones that are communicating even if they're joking you know i mean that's 

235.36 240.69 B: you know they're still communicating and they can you know relay it in various ways to each other 

241.52 246.37 B: and uh i believe very strongly in marriage and very strongly in the communication 

242.75 243.91 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

246.67 248.16 B: and um 

248.12 252.74 A: yeah you know it's interesting 'cause i i've been i've been uh 

248.53 249.34 B: (( it's mhm )) 

252.92 256.14 A: married once before and uh 

256.92 260.74 A: you're absolutely right as far as that goes um 

261.64 265.22 A: i i i was married long enough to have two two children 

265.33 266.96 A: (( and um )) 

267.46 279.63 A: then they were uh a year and and two years old and uh it it didn't take long we ended up our relationship just did not work and we ended up getting a divorce 

279.71 282.31 A: and i ended up raising um 

282.33 285.44 A: my two kids for a good long time by myself 

285.55 289.21 A: and then i met the hubby husband number two [laughter] 

289.31 293.54 A: and we got married and we've been together for seventeen years now 

293.80 295.10 A: and 

295.33 298.61 A: it's really weird how the difference 

298.96 304.82 A: in in diff- you basically wonder what kinda you know there's so many different types of relationships 

305.16 307.00 A: you know the levels 

307.22 308.86 A: that you can have 

308.44 309.61 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

309.21 311.92 A: you know of involvement and um 

312.48 319.92 A: of course i was married very young me me and my first husband both were and we hadn't even hadn't got to um 

319.97 324.05 A: experience life yet [laughter] you know per say you know 

324.24 325.72 A: so um [lipsmack] 

326.04 329.58 B: what was the quality the best quality that you had with him 

329.45 332.80 A: in my first husband um 

330.58 331.58 B: yeah 

334.44 336.84 A: [lipsmack] i would have to say 

338.83 340.28 A: (( um )) 

340.52 347.96 A: the communication we had it's sort of strange in a way because e- even though it didn't work out and we ended up getting divorced 

347.89 361.01 A: uh me and him have been able to um com- we we was able to communicate a lot better than me and husband number two sometimes um because um me and husband number two he he uh 

361.86 364.52 A: we sometimes you know we come to a 

364.69 368.44 A: wall where we sometimes have difficulty uh communicating 

368.66 374.39 A: mostly because he's bull headed and i'm bull headed [laughter] you know but um 

371.20 372.38 B: [laughter] 

375.26 380.75 A: i think too because we me and husband n- number one was younger 

380.78 390.96 A: we was more free spirited so we that i think that brought us out to communicate better but as i got older and and got mar- and married husband number two 

391.15 397.11 A: i i got set in my ways more and the same thing with my husband number two so 

397.91 403.15 A: now that we're both older i'm forty seven and he's forty seven we tend to have 

403.43 411.53 A: difficulties once in a while communicating you know 'cause i have my ideas and my old age he has his i- ideas and his old age 

411.50 413.07 B: yes [laughter] 

413.44 416.68 B: yes one thing i learned from a um 

416.78 421.09 B: a show um and it was on you know talking to each other 

420.98 428.94 B: and the well it was dr phil and he was he had this this man and wife um sitting you know directly in front of each other 

421.06 421.98 A: mhm 

428.83 441.23 B: and he said you know talk to each other he said but ask the person also you know what did you hear you know what did you hear me say because what i say to you you may hear differently than what i'm saying 

437.21 438.21 A: mhm 

441.29 450.58 B: and um you know it's like the voices because so many seconds from from my mouth to your ear that it's so many seconds that things can turn 

450.71 454.63 B: you know the words can turn and it's just like wow so different 

454.69 455.72 A: (( mhm )) 

454.96 461.31 B: you know but i i think just you know the communication and and trying to get the communication in there 

461.46 473.59 B: and you know being honest about it not holding everything in you know or or actually holding anything in you know if you just let it out and say you know this is what's going on the good and the not so good 

465.33 466.53 A: mhm 

473.62 480.03 B: you know and and it's difficult to do that sometimes because the way the world is you know and that 

479.17 482.09 A: yeah well that that's a big difference too 

482.26 486.32 A: the the world is now compared to the way it was when i was younger 

486.12 487.05 B: yeah 

486.60 490.29 A: i think that has a lot of effect on on on um 

491.48 493.17 A: relationships too 

493.30 494.18 A: you know 

494.88 500.99 A: not that it has changed all that much but between when i was younger and now it's just that it seems 

494.89 495.79 B: yes 

502.41 508.43 A: um that the the um the environment the way it was compared to now 

508.49 510.72 A: i mean a big difference 

508.72 509.86 B: yeah 

510.46 514.92 B: there's not r- there's no there's there's very little respect if any respect 

514.86 515.99 A: uh-huh 

515.19 521.60 B: now in a lot of you know communications the way you know people address each other but um 

521.58 535.65 B: i know the marriage rate like you know with counseling and just finding out you know like what's going on with the marriages and with the spouses and uh through all and all statistically i think communication 

535.56 543.14 B: is the key you know the biggest thing and then of course you've got your individual things that you feel about the you know the person 

543.18 544.77 B: but um [lipsmack] 

545.06 546.32 B: yeah i 

546.45 550.70 B: i am a very strong believer in in you know doing whatever 

550.72 563.75 B: it takes to make the marriage work but not going against yourself you know like not putting yourself in a position where you're gonna get hurt you know whatever but just knowing you know that some things coming up from the past are going to 

555.04 556.05 A: uh-huh 

563.65 577.37 B: come into play where you've got to work around those you know and just the things in life that happen but communication if you can't communicate how you feel and if they do need the space like the distance you know like to go into the man cave type of thing 

577.24 586.28 B: you know leave them alone for a little while and say okay when you're ready to come out and communicate please come do so but don't you know don't let it go for days and days and days and not do it um 

585.09 586.13 A: uh-huh 

586.28 592.25 B: but you know that to me and the kindness on your part um you know that's very important 

592.54 595.95 B: you know 'cause you don't want you don't want to bully [laughter] 

592.97 594.04 A: uh-huh 

595.64 599.90 A: yeah i was talking to a friend of mine the other day too she 

597.20 598.01 B: yeah
