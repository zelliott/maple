187.64 189.21 A: did you ever find 

189.23 199.44 A: like after you were married that maybe his personality different parts of his personality when something like you know the baby or sickness came up that you you know weren't aware of 

200.94 204.92 A: or that he reacted in a way that you weren't you know hadn't experienced before 

201.10 202.15 B: uh

227.51 229.74 B: stay in this together you know it's 

229.78 235.87 B: and be strong and you know just right out the the hard times i guess is the most important 

236.37 237.45 A: yeah 

237.75 238.70 A: yeah 

238.10 240.67 B: factor of the whole of the uh

243.04 254.75 B: and i know that's hard [laughter] it's hard and i you know there were times i mean i i could see you know times of saying well oh my gosh i i don't know how i'm gonna get through this and 

255.75 257.02 B: you know then i 

257.38 258.56 B: i kind of 

259.16 260.99 B: just try to um 

261.68 266.32 B: get away from it [laughter] some way you know somehow you just have to 

264.94 266.08 A: yeah 

266.28 271.15 A: what i try to do i try and remember like the beginning days you know how great it is at the beginning 

266.45 267.21 B: and 

269.41 270.41 B: uh-huh 

271.18 272.31 B: right 

271.26 276.95 A: kind of reflect back on that you know and try to think of you know what drew me to that person and 

277.05 278.08 A: you know 

278.16 285.07 A: you know just kinda review your head that even though like you said a situation at the time just seems unbearable or you know you're 

285.50 288.33 A: you're thinking who is this person [laughter] 

287.54 290.77 B: [laughter] yeah that's right 

289.82 291.95 A: (( who who is this person )) 

292.76 294.96 A: i've never seen this side of him before 

293.46 294.45 B: so what 

295.07 299.94 B: like with your boyfriend uh what were you what were you um 

296.75 297.60 A: uh-huh 

300.76 304.23 B: looking for in the relationship i'm sure [laughter] 

303.57 310.61 A: i wasn't looking either so it was kinda funny not looking at all 'cause i'd been obviously out of my marriage um 

305.35 306.34 B: oh 

309.81 310.82 B: uh-huh 

310.85 317.98 A: and i'd gone through counseling and tried to i i tried the hardest i could to make that work and just my husband didn't wanna go to counseling and 

318.11 325.69 A: you know it was just better we had been together a long time we had been married for seven but been together since i was eighteen so we'd been together about twelve years 

325.08 326.11 B: uh-huh 

325.86 330.35 A: and then after i got divorced of course i you know i didn't even want a relationship 

330.37 331.64 A: (( [mn] )) 

330.76 337.26 B: now i can understand [laughter] well what is it the statistics are like one out of two marriages i 

334.05 334.95 A: and 

338.17 339.93 A: (( yeah and uh )) 

338.83 339.58 B: (( guess )) 

340.24 351.60 A: when we met we actually had you know met briefly a few times before and then we met again by chance and um i had just moved close to him closer to him in seattle maybe like ten minutes away 

341.88 342.64 B: (( mhm )) 

346.34 347.36 B: uh-huh 

351.60 359.60 A: and just he was just such a kind generous open person i think right away i felt like i could tell him anything or i felt i could trust him 

353.35 354.10 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

355.84 356.62 B: (( sure )) 

359.64 360.63 B: uh-huh 

360.42 361.47 A: right away 

361.64 367.26 A: and for me that's i have these huge trust issues so it was just you know it was really 

367.60 372.76 A: even after a day and a half of being together it felt like we'd been together like a year and a half 

372.83 375.47 A: you know he just felt like someone i'd known forever 

376.67 388.28 B: right yeah that i should've mentioned that too that was so important to me someone that was honest and open and and i could trust and that in our relationship and all all through the years we've always been 

382.90 383.97 A: yeah 

388.66 390.87 B: honest and open with each other 

391.06 392.46 A: yeah and i think 

391.12 392.62 B: so i guess that 

392.83 396.18 A: right away i mean it was just like i said right away 

396.25 402.43 A: in- instantly it was like we had been together a long time because we could just talk about anything and we did 

399.17 400.13 B: uh-huh 

401.47 403.52 B: right right [laughter] 

403.54 406.92 A: neither one of us was working much at the time so we'd just hung out 

405.69 406.45 B: (( oh )) 

406.94 408.12 A: (( and you know that's )) 

407.23 408.17 B: uh-huh 

408.14 414.83 A: we didn't the typical dating thing 'cause we were both kinda broke so you know we were able just to hang out and have a great time you know 

411.94 412.72 B: [laughter] 

413.98 415.02 B: (( uh-huh [mn] )) 

414.84 420.87 A: cook dinner or you know go for a walk and and we we spent a lot of time together 

420.89 424.63 A: in the beginning that wasn't like you know a typical like old movie and 

424.69 428.04 A: and uh dinner where you don't really talk to someone that much 

427.89 428.87 B: uh-huh 

428.21 438.10 A: so i think in the beginning since we spent so much time together we were able to talk and we were both just so open and honest and it just it's really you know kinda set down the 

438.47 442.15 A: pavement sorta you know the foundation for the relationship 

442.14 445.91 B: oh that's great i i think that's wonderful i wish you the 

443.63 444.54 A: yeah 

446.12 447.54 B: the best of luck 

447.72 456.56 A: oh he's and you like you said you know sickness and that's been too is i have been ill in fact on um medical leave when i um was going through my divorce 

456.26 457.21 B: (( uh-huh )) 

456.48 464.70 A: and my husband wasn't very supportive of of that and so um the boyfriend my new boyfriend max my partner um 

463.80 464.69 B: uh-huh 

464.80 478.49 A: you know i i kinda told him sometimes i get sick because i have a thyroid condition and sometimes it gets really bad where you know you kinda just have to leave me alone for a couple of days and let me rest and you know a lotta people [sigh] aren't able to cope with that 

479.38 480.89 A: you know a lotta people 

479.76 484.06 B: yeah i know i've i've had um ongoing 

484.39 489.32 B: uh chronic health problems too and my husband has always been there for me 

486.39 487.32 A: mhm 

489.57 501.04 B: and that is so important in a relationship i mean you know you married uh for whatever you know for better or worse in a relationship together you know you have to go through the good and the bad 

490.10 490.97 A: yeah 

497.34 498.21 A: right 

501.52 507.90 A: and that the other thing in my other marriage we had gone through the better for worse and all that but when it came to sickness and health you know it just 

505.64 506.28 B: (( yeah )) 

506.88 507.61 B: (( yeah )) 

507.87 520.24 A: the health part didn't yeah he wasn't supportive and it's just you know so that's the thing with my partner now is that he's been especially i'm having some problems with my thyroid condition for the last three months 

507.95 509.07 B: he didn't wanna 

509.82 510.67 B: (( [mn] )) 

511.47 512.34 B: (( oh )) 

520.33 533.09 A: you know and it's it's a newer relationship so it's it's hard but he's been very supportive you know and understanding uh you know what i need to do to get get myself better and this happens sometimes so 

533.68 538.10 A: you can't run away [laughter] and he didn't run away 

533.70 539.32 B: oh thank thank god for that [laughter] i know i've just gone through um 

539.53 549.03 B: uh treatment for breast cancer too and but it was very hard for my husband 'cause he he didn't know what to do for me i mean he wanted to help 

542.15 543.18 A: uh-huh 

548.55 551.27 A: they wanna help and they get so frustrated 

549.11 553.48 B: you know right yeah that's what gets frustrating yeah 

553.61 562.67 A: yeah and i i know i mean you think you know you see them getting frustrated you know 'cause there's been times he's been short with me like you know why can't the doctor do this or not or that 

562.96 568.91 A: you know and then you worry 'cause you see them getting just so frustrated 'cause they wanna help 'cause they care 

569.13 570.42 B: that's right 

570.93 571.92 A: so 

571.97 576.58 A: luckily you know it's only happened a couple of times i mean he's frustrated 'cause he knows i'm frustrated 

577.18 582.83 B: yeah that's they they know how you're feeling and they wanna help but they can't 

580.62 581.50 A: mhm 

582.86 587.17 B: it's just a matter i guess of just you know being able to to listen 

583.08 584.06 A: right 

587.28 589.53 B: i guess and support you yeah yeah 

587.87 588.75 A: yeah 

591.04 599.89 A: so that's that's been really important to me just that that level of trust and especially with me being sick the last few months with him being able to you know cope with that
