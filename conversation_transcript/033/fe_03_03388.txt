22.40 26.18 B: all right [sigh] so what do you think's the most important thing in a partner 

26.31 29.48 A: let's see in a partner i think the most important thing is uh 

30.11 37.04 A: well of course first impressions is what narrows it down but after that um like goals and aspirations i 

36.81 37.72 B: okay 

37.50 43.32 A: think i mean if if they're not going to be going anywhere i guess it's going to make me frustrated when i'm trying to go somewhere 

43.95 47.88 A: or for at least at least if we go [mn] we have the same focus 

47.83 48.79 B: sure 

48.60 49.51 A: (( you know [sigh] )) 

50.29 57.99 A: but other than that it's it comes down to first impressions that's what narrows the whole field down to the select i guess the select few 

58.40 67.95 A: [sigh] it's first impressions would like if where you would be what do you what do what do you think they look like the personality you know all that but in the long run i think goals and aspirations 

68.13 69.20 A: what about you mm 

69.31 77.24 B: [sigh] um i think for me it's um [sigh] i think goals and aspirations [mn] i think that's a pretty good one [sigh] but i also think that it's um 

77.09 85.71 B: about trust and about being best friends i think for me you really really have to be [sigh] friends with the person that you're in love with because [sigh] 

85.48 91.82 B: i've liked people but not really been friends but gone out with them and it just wasn't right and it didn't work 

91.62 96.30 B: [sigh] but my husband are i are are truly best friends and i think that makes [sigh] 

91.81 93.02 A: right 

96.15 105.15 B: the difference it allows you to get through the little stuff it allows you to get through the [sigh] bumps in the road it allows you to laugh at each other and you know [laughter] laugh at yourself and 

103.33 104.34 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

105.03 111.30 B: [sigh] not take everything too seriously and i think that [sigh] that's what keeps you together in the long run 

111.38 114.15 A: right [noise] i mean that's good to hear that from you too 

114.17 115.22 B: yeah [laughter] 

114.45 122.26 A: uh [laughter] there's not i mean what do what's the statistics that people will end up in divorce fifty percent 

121.49 124.86 B: [lipsmack] yeah yeah and i've heard that it's even more than that sometimes 

122.44 124.10 A: yeah 

124.93 125.89 A: really 

126.12 131.12 A: well i guess that's a good start if if you're friends with them then you know where it's going to go after that 

129.45 131.84 B: oh yeah are you married 

131.91 137.27 A: no i'm i'm single i'm only twenty two i'm a- about to graduate college in a month [cough] 

134.28 135.35 B: (( oh okay )) 

137.05 138.22 B: where do you go 

138.28 141.20 A: uh u. t. or university of texas in austin 

139.21 140.13 B: (( oh okay )) 

140.86 143.05 B: yeah i went to um l. s. u. 

143.11 144.30 A: oh really 

143.71 145.75 B: yeah [laughter] right down the road 

144.44 145.38 A: (( yeah that's )) 

145.75 147.24 A: [laughter] true 

147.00 151.35 B: which so at what point do you think you would be interested in getting married at what age 

151.49 155.71 A: if i had the decision i'd think twenty seven twenty eight 

155.63 156.49 B: yeah 

155.82 164.93 A: would be the perfect time for me where i have a job and you know i've kind of settled down in a way where i know where i'm going with that job maybe from 

164.96 170.82 A: trying to get promoted or something you know i'm in a set state like a set area in 

170.86 172.71 A: in my career i guess you could say 

172.41 173.32 B: sure 

173.17 179.15 A: so then i'm ready you know i'd be ready for a relationship and marriage and all that but until then you know i have a while to go i have maybe six 

178.92 180.19 B: [laughter] 

179.62 181.54 A: years six seven years 

182.00 186.11 A: even though my parents want it to happen as soon as possible but that those are just parents 

182.02 182.90 B: yeah 

185.83 187.66 B: oh sure absolutely 

186.75 193.13 A: [laughter] they want it to happen as soon as possible but you know for me twenty twenty seven twenty eight would be optimal 

189.46 190.89 B: [laughter] 

193.03 193.96 B: yeah 

193.33 195.08 A: when when did you get married 

194.53 200.21 B: [sigh] um we got married when i was twenty nine and actually it was kind of the same thing you know i wanted to 

200.09 203.21 B: [sigh] right after college i was working and [sigh] 

203.10 209.91 B: i i'm an i._t. manager and so i i've always worked in pretty high stress jobs where i was working fifty sixty hours a week and [sigh] 

209.47 210.26 A: right 

209.79 221.64 B: um and working uh anywhere from six to seven days a week usually i was always on call [sigh] and i just never really had the time and i never really found the person [sigh] but i'm really glad that i waited 

214.69 215.62 A: right 

221.53 222.39 A: (( right exactly )) 

221.80 227.01 B: age wise because i was able to do the things like you're saying like to really focus on my career and [sigh] 

226.86 240.30 B: and focus on what i wanted to do and and i have no regrets you know whereas i think that if i had gotten married [sigh] in college or right out of college [sigh] there i would have been limited in what i could have done because i've moved all over the country for a job 

240.17 243.43 B: which i would not have been able to do if i'd been married 

240.23 241.25 A: (( uh-huh right )) 

243.41 247.26 B: [sigh] so for me it it was a i just think it i was 

247.10 251.77 B: and i made me appreciate it a lot more you know i was more i was ready for it and then [sigh] 

249.35 250.21 A: (( right [noise] )) 

251.66 263.93 B: now i can go on and and go to the next step of having kids and you know just not having any regrets so i i i do think like [sigh] twenty seven twenty eight twenty nine i think that's a a good age especially in our day and age 

262.45 263.30 A: right 

263.79 269.63 A: exactly yet on the other hand i want i want my partner to be comfortable and set in her life 

269.24 270.41 B: right 

270.37 276.44 A: and i don't want her to be you know i don't want her to be tot young where like she's still looking for what she wants to do with her life 

270.44 271.28 B: right 

276.30 277.26 B: right 

276.58 285.88 A: so i think i think by then most the average person by twenty eight or twenty nine around there they they have a good idea of where they are in their life and where they want to go 

285.34 290.00 B: [noise] [lipsmack] especially with girls i think girls need to be older because they 

289.34 290.51 A: (( yeah )) 

289.89 291.04 B: they just [laughter] 

290.82 301.48 B: girls between about twenty to about twenty five are just [sigh] they're kind of silly and they don't know what they [sigh] want to do and they're they're trying to feel themselves out and i think it takes that long for them to be [sigh] 

296.24 296.97 A: (( [laughter] )) 

301.28 307.41 B: secure with themselves so that they could be a good partner and a good and be in a good marriage and be a friend 

307.33 308.51 A: right right it's 

308.93 312.33 A: a little harder for me though i'm my ethnicity is indian so 

311.92 312.98 B: (( oh okay )) 

312.80 323.81 A: it's kind of different for us where girls usually marry earlier or they used to it's changing now it's changing really rapidly now uh you know before well my parents didn't even date you know it was more arranged 

318.29 319.23 B: right 

323.43 327.32 B: do you guys still do don't you still do arranged marriages in some cases [lipsmack] 

326.21 331.91 A: yeah it it still happens but uh our culture's getting a lot western now 

331.57 332.63 B: (( o._h. okay )) 

332.23 346.16 A: so it's changing very fast but it still happens but [sigh] the notion that a lot of people maybe not you but a lot of people have is where like the guy goes up says i want her and they get married or it's it's it's set from birth it's not like that anymore 

345.34 348.17 B: right or the family the family picks them out 

346.23 347.05 A: kinda 

348.03 360.48 A: right like were my if i was supposed to get it which i don't want to do um my parents would go find a good family and then a good girl and then they'd meet and the we'd meet and if we both liked each other then we'd do it [sigh] 

360.36 361.55 B: oh okay 

360.51 364.83 A: so you know both sides have an option where in the in the past usually 

364.67 376.33 A: the parents made it or maybe the male made it the decision but now it's a lot more liberal but it's kinda getting phased out too over here at least in america really [laughter] 

368.01 369.07 B: right 

374.64 388.93 B: [sigh] well i worked with a guy who um h- he was a little bit older i'm thirty one and he was a little bit older than i was but [sigh] he had an arranged marriage and he had never met her before [sigh] um he actually went back to india to get married and his parents 

388.86 389.92 B: [sigh] um 

389.69 395.91 B: i [mn] i guess the same thing you know they the families knew each other they found kind of like the i guess the dowry or um [lipsmack] 

393.20 394.26 A: (( right right )) 

395.74 400.95 B: i don't know if you guys have that but [sigh] had like some kind of wedding purse or something and uh [sigh] 

399.85 400.73 A: uh-huh 

400.77 412.06 B: and so he had never met her they and they weren't supposed to talk or anything and [sigh] but i think she [sigh] she called a friend and a friend called him and so they were able to like talk somehow behind everybody's back but [sigh] [mn] 

404.64 405.63 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

411.92 418.78 B: on his wedding day was the first day he'd ever met her and [mn] i j- i mean that's incredible you you've got to have guts to do that [laughter] [laughter] 

418.12 420.92 A: yeah it's it worked out for my parents 

421.05 429.12 A: but you know i mean i don't think in a western society it'll work anymore we're too we're too we're too liberal we have too many different views 

424.96 425.99 B: right 

429.13 432.01 A: [sigh] we you know we don't just do what our parents say anymore 

431.79 432.87 B: right 

432.34 442.89 A: that's the truth i mean we you know we i think we've lost respect for a lot of elders now than what we had in the past [sigh] so i think the kids nowadays if you're living in america or in a western society we're 

438.55 439.64 B: right 

443.00 446.20 A: we're a lot more kind of independent or we're on our own 

446.10 455.25 B: right [sigh] well you you're not you're not living in that environment to where you you have a choice now whereas you might not have if you were say still living in india 

446.65 448.33 A: so i don't think that works 

455.11 462.99 A: right so yeah it just depends i'm not i'm not exactly sure what goes on over there i was born here and i've only visited there twice maybe 

456.73 457.44 B: (( mm )) 

462.60 465.73 B: oh okay [sigh] so you're parents were born in india 

463.46 464.34 A: so 

465.40 469.21 A: yeah my parents were born there my mom grew up in l- london though 

469.06 469.98 B: oh wow 

469.26 479.49 A: for a lot for a lot of her life so she's you know she's a more a little bit more western than my dad but [sigh] they're both still pretty they still have the indian values they're still pretty conservative and all that 

479.12 482.59 B: how long um was uh have they been married 

483.25 484.43 A: um 

484.88 488.99 A: i think they're forty like forty seven forty eight now 

489.34 495.87 A: and i think they got married either early twenties or at twenty or twenty one yeah 

493.37 499.32 B: wow and they and they're still toget- and it was an arranged marriage and they're still together that's pretty impressive 

498.99 502.08 A: yeah that's pretty impressive it worked out and i'm glad [laughter] 

501.46 503.34 B: yeah [laughter] 

502.64 511.14 A: and i think they had me i don't know i guess they had me pretty early 'cause they're only forty seven i guess and i'm i'm already twenty two about to turn twenty three so 

507.64 508.63 B: yeah 

511.44 517.07 A: you know i guess that's just the way it was back then they moved my whole family moved here in the seventies 

516.74 517.83 B: oh wow 

517.67 521.79 A: so they've been here for alm- more than thirty years 

521.73 524.67 B: wow so you're first generation american [lipsmack] 

524.09 531.48 A: yeah i'm first generation over here so it's hard for them to comprehend what goes [mn] they don't know the half of what goes on with like 

531.96 533.47 A: like our uh 

533.92 540.69 A: our culture is like well all the kids now the indian kids now you know they're really conservative they don't know half of what goes on 

537.47 538.82 B: oh yeah 

540.87 544.01 A: when when they go away to college or stuff like that you know 

543.58 544.79 B: right 

544.15 547.76 A: it's their kids are all proper and nice and everything you know 

547.08 548.93 B: [laughter] yeah right 

547.93 552.67 A: they're just like an- you know they're just like all other kids you know they're not different from anyone 

552.48 553.57 B: right

559.21 560.80 B: [laughter] 

559.98 561.82 A: which which is not true at all

562.64 563.73 B: [sigh] yeah 

565.15 575.11 B: there's a a very large indian population at l. s. u. and you know i don't know if it's a stereotype or just all the ones that i you know the indian cult- or peo- indian people i've ever known but [sigh] 

575.08 587.14 B: most of 'em are extremely brilliant i mean just beyond normal [sigh] and were usually in engineering [sigh] um civil engineering electrical engineering or mechanical engineering and 

581.49 583.32 A: (( right exactly )) 

586.16 587.94 A: right or the sciences 

587.53 597.95 B: yeah and would just blow you away i had um [sigh] a guy help me with calculus and he was like why don't you get this i'm like i just don't understand [laughter] you know [laughter]
