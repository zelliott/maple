485.15 488.66 B: that actually makes a lot of sense i never thought about that before 

488.65 490.61 A: have you tried an ionizer 

490.44 492.16 B: no what's that 

491.64 498.78 A: [laughter] it's a little machine it it's similar to an air purifier but they but it's a specifically an ionizer 

498.98 510.65 A: it does something to the i i can't remember positive or negative ions whatever it is that it adds to the air but i've 'em and i did notice that when we used 'em it made a big difference 

503.53 504.55 B: right 

510.34 512.28 B: really 

512.57 514.72 B: yeah i'll have to look into that 

515.18 526.03 A: i bought one from q._v._c. because i wasn't sure if um if it was really going to be a good thing and they let you use any product for thirty days and return it if you don't like it and i thought well you can't lose with that 

522.73 523.77 B: oh really 

525.32 526.70 B: right 

526.06 532.09 A: so i bought one from there for there really for my daughter because she has problems at night 

531.71 533.04 B: right 

532.44 537.17 A: and it really really helped her a lot i i noticed it the first night immediately 

537.26 539.94 A: she slept so much better 

539.66 540.86 B: huh 

542.28 547.06 A: but that's a thought too and that's not something they talk about a lot when they talk about 

543.14 544.61 B: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

547.77 554.98 A: i guess 'cause it's they can sell medicines over and over but you only need to buy an ionizer once [laughter] they don't make as much money that way 

552.03 552.95 B: true 

554.74 556.59 B: right 

557.30 560.25 B: yeah i'll have to look into that and get one [sigh] 

560.91 565.44 B: 'cause that that's what's the worst is waking up in the morning and just being all congested
