99.94 100.97 B: oh really 

101.23 106.68 A: yeah i think it was just because when i was in college there was a vietnamese restaurant across from of

106.71 107.67 A: (( from it )) 

109.41 111.90 A: yeah i just had i had too much though 

111.74 113.45 B: right right right 

112.58 116.22 A: too much noodle soup but i i used to get it every day 

113.88 115.18 B: yeah well 

116.11 122.97 B: yeah i actually you see i li- i kinda just um i don't know i just i i like the the part that is just a clear 

122.89 131.65 B: um i think it's like clear rolls or something like that so i love those things not not in the soup necessarily the noodle soup but kinda you get burnt on that 

131.72 132.88 B: (( but um that's kinda )) 

131.87 138.21 A: yeah yeah they used to have well they have so many varieties i don't know i just kinda ate my way through the whole menu 

138.42 145.63 B: cool exactly yeah yeah but um what about japanese do you like like pretty much everything sushi and and all sorts of stuff 

144.91 148.28 A: oh yeah i'm bigger i like sashimi more 

147.69 148.79 B: (( uh-hum )) 

148.54 150.67 A: (( i don't know do you don't )) 

149.26 152.38 B: do you like like california rolls or stuff like that 

152.32 157.05 A: california rolls are okay but there's so much more interesting stuff when it comes to like 

155.77 157.52 B: [laughter] you're right 

157.70 158.86 B: yep yep 

158.21 162.71 A: yeah you get like an avocado and that little piece of crab in the california roll but 

162.79 166.01 A: i like um i know it's endangered now so it's not 

166.55 169.82 A: it's not really that great to eat any more but blue fin tuna 

169.55 172.37 B: yeah yeah that's cool i love it 

171.72 178.26 A: it's like it's so smooth and it just melts in your mouth i think that's a very important part of food for me is the texture as well 

178.08 189.91 B: yeah i've um yeah discovered the the thai restaurant that serves um i think it's the um chilean sea bass and they steam it and it's just so completely out of this world it's it's terrific 

179.05 180.04 A: yeah 

189.30 192.56 A: oh yeah i know that chilean sea bass is on the 

192.75 196.26 A: over farmed list and that's a shame because it's such a good fish 

195.76 205.47 B: i know yeah exactly but all that stuff you know with the mercury these days it's kinda like you're it's crazy you don't know what to eat and stuff like that 

203.23 204.02 A: (( ah )) 

204.71 209.68 A: ah i know fish is supposed to be better for you because it has like the better fatty acids and stuff 

208.81 210.38 B: mhm sure 

209.87 213.33 A: but then it it takes up all that ocean pollution 

213.32 214.65 B: yep yep 

213.82 216.16 A: it becomes just as dangerous as like 

215.67 217.43 B: yeah i've been reading a 

216.47 218.13 A: commercially produced fish 

217.45 229.84 B: lot of like doctor whyle and all that stuff and so they're kinda just even even there saying like you know be moderate with like all the mercury consumption that you can get you know from all the fish you're gonna eat so 

229.93 237.77 B: but again you know salmon i they they still say that salmon and trout are pretty much the best in terms of like they're the cleanest 

237.59 240.77 A: because they're farmed and not out in the ocean 

240.49 242.18 B: right right 

241.23 243.41 A: because they are from fisheries i guess 

243.20 244.41 B: yeah 

243.65 245.40 A: that makes more sense 

245.13 254.12 B: yeah i kinda i actually like the taste of catfish but it's so completely like full of steroids and all the crap you really should not ever 

253.28 257.17 A: i heard that catfish is really bad for you because they're bottom feeders too 

256.71 258.10 B: yeah 

257.55 260.97 A: so they pick up everything that [laughter] on the bottom 

260.62 267.32 B: exactly yeah what about like macrobiotics you know teachers have you um heard of their like way of uh 

267.54 273.56 B: you know pretty much eating like all sorts of like seaweed and like you know meats or soups and all that sort of stuff 

272.99 282.98 A: yeah i'd heard about like you just like eat most of the stuff raw to get the best food enzymes and things like that like nothing should be cooked over a hundred and fifteen degrees 

278.96 279.75 B: right 

282.53 289.15 B: exactly yeah it's kinda like anti cancer you know treatment basically for you know people who 

284.26 285.65 A: (( yeah )) 

289.08 301.18 B: who are either survivors or just you know trying to prev- you know eating preventative ah foods and stuff like that but at the same time it's just healthy eating and ah just basic principles that they're cool so 

301.39 304.39 B: (( i enjoy that once in a while [laughter] as well )) 

301.87 303.20 A: yeah 

303.52 311.10 A: it seems like it would be you know a great healthy way to live but i don't know it's so hard [laughter] and i don't have the budget for it you know 

310.61 318.38 B: right you know yeah it's funny that it's um but for example like in new york um you know like uh the healthy ah pleasures um 

311.58 312.56 A: [laughter] 

318.41 331.17 B: store and it's like a large you know organic store and stuff but um it's been under the in- investigation that it's not really organic that's organic all that packaged stuff it's not really that good but geez 

326.11 326.89 A: (( [mn] )) 

331.08 338.48 B: but it's still i mean it makes sense it's like you know it's nice and and beautifully wrapped and you always think that it's the best and then they like you know 

339.10 340.41 B: it's a ripoff 

339.11 342.60 A: [laughter] it's not really organic yeah 

340.84 347.74 B: i know that that's sad though you know but um you know speaking of like eating at home that's kinda like ah 

347.93 355.56 B: it's it's so expensive you know to buy like good food and organic food but it's the best you know definitely the best 

352.92 354.24 A: well yeah 

354.29 366.43 A: sometimes i find that it's cheaper to eat out than it is to eat at home 'cause i only cook for myself so i always have so much food left over it's hard to cook one portion of things so sometimes it is just easier to eat out as well 

359.05 360.05 B: right 

366.08 367.09 B: right 

366.48 369.65 A: than staying home and cooking yeah 

367.78 370.29 B: where are you which state are you in 

370.33 371.78 A: i'm in california 

371.27 372.99 B: oh cool okay 

372.39 374.75 A: yeah i'm in the los angeles area 

374.18 382.53 B: oh okay that's terrific i just i don't really you know i mean like i like cooking do you personally like cooking a lot or ah just well 

376.18 376.94 A: [laughter] 

381.68 382.59 A: mhm 

382.56 383.60 B: (( that's cool )) 

382.67 384.31 A: yeah i like creating 

384.09 385.07 B: right 

384.33 392.99 A: yeah dishes and i am really proud of myself when something tastes good but when it's bad it's so terrible [laughter] like i spent all this time trying to make something 

389.44 390.96 B: [laughter] 

392.63 393.71 B: (( all right )) 

393.03 395.21 A: and it's no good 

394.37 395.99 B: i know well 

395.77 397.61 A: it's just a disappointment 

396.34 403.18 B: you gotta you gotta create and you know gotta just do a sacrifice certain things right just one in a while that's cool 

401.08 402.05 A: yeah 

402.69 403.63 A: [laughter] 

403.66 411.30 B: yeah interesting but um yeah there's also let's see what about um do you like like mexican food and that sort of stuff like 

410.54 418.43 A: oh yeah i love well california's a great area for mexican food i mean and especially since i'm i'm in la what area are you in 

411.86 412.95 B: yeah 

413.75 415.00 B: yeah 

416.74 417.89 B: right right 

418.12 428.50 B: i'm actually in new york but i um i am in georgia occasionally as well so we get all sorts of like fabulous uh mexican restaurants there too 

428.59 430.11 A: yeah 

428.87 430.18 B: (( and a )) 

430.48 436.45 B: just that the re- the good stuff the real stuff i love like in you know like green burritos and all that so 

436.59 442.63 A: oh yeah there's a fantastic mexican restaurant near where i am and it's genuine it's authentic you know because it's like 

442.45 443.21 B: right 

443.08 449.28 A: if you go at ten o'clock night there's just like lines of mexicans hanging out outside so you know it's the real thing 

448.93 456.67 B: yeah that's cool exactly that's how i determine too yeah just you know if you know that if the locals are going that's you know that's the good stuff 

450.44 451.41 A: yeah 

456.30 465.11 A: that's right that's how i knew it was a good place when i moved here 'cause there was a line of people at like at ten o'clock at night so it's like oh that must be good 

462.62 463.94 B: (( yeah that's right [laughter] )) 

465.62 467.22 B: (( that's terrific yes yeah )) 

467.88 473.66 B: in new york it's kinda um you know it's almost like when i moved here it's like you know it's pretty much um 

473.56 479.82 B: um i kinda like you know i travelled and and i went to europe and all that so it's kinda i compare 

479.68 489.85 B: you know i compare basically like what you get there and what you get here so like in aus- in austria you know you can get like all sorts of stuff for like dirt cheap and then 

484.63 486.15 A: oh yeah 

489.74 499.45 B: [laughter] in the same like you know german restaurant here you get you pay like you know seventy bucks for like what for something that doesn't even taste authentic and stuff so 

499.17 508.64 A: yeah i've done travelling a lot of travelling too and i notice the same thing you compare you get it really cheap you can get it on the street you know like a little roadside stand or something in 

507.70 509.66 B: i know yeah 

508.79 513.90 A: germany and in here you have to go to a specialty restaurant and it's so much more expensive and it doesn't taste as good 

513.37 525.60 B: right and then they play this you know awful like national music and stuff that's supposed to like make you feel at home [laughter] and it's like [laughter] it's like mostly overdone and it's just not really um 

519.55 521.47 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

525.76 529.56 B: not really doing for it but especially if you've been to the real you know 

529.86 532.62 B: to the real um country or like um 

532.81 539.84 B: you have eaten the real cuisine and stuff so but it's still i mean like they're trying so we should give them that right [laughter] 

540.07 552.56 A: yeah [laughter] really at least they're trying you know to try and broaden your scope of foods that you can get but that's what i like about you know california and i'm sure new york too is we have such a variety to choose from 

546.44 547.39 B: right 

549.41 550.46 B: yeah 

551.28 557.35 B: oh yeah i mean that part is is just fantastic new york is just unbelievable in that respect 

557.33 567.13 B: and stuff and of course you know that you can actually find like you know totally cheap places in chinatown and stuff you can actually yes same there 

557.63 558.89 A: yeah 

564.15 565.51 A: oh yeah 

565.71 572.72 A: same here i live near a yeah i live near a chinatown and uh you can get dim sum for really cheap they have like lunch specials all over the place 

567.18 568.01 B: yeah 

572.42 581.00 B: yeah that's pretty good i mean like those so- sorts of things are kinda just nice because in atlanta you you just really don't get that sort of stuff 

581.12 594.00 B: so like no no chinatowns no nothing and in new york you get like all sorts of good stuff like that so you kinda like come you know to like one of the most expensive cities and stuff but you you find like really good deals an- and everything so 

581.48 582.40 A: no 

584.00 585.43 A: [laughter] 

587.07 588.24 A: yeah 

593.74 595.67 A: you just have to know where to look 

595.33 599.37 B: yeah that's true but actually just ah some ah
