365.33 366.62 B: (( okay yeah )) 

374.97 382.86 A: and um it took a long time i think it took us a year to convince her that she should get an air conditioner to filter the air out

383.00 390.24 B: yeah i have a guy i work with that's that he's he gets affected by a lot of things and he had he uses a air filter in his office which helps 

389.37 390.21 A: mhm 

390.53 399.10 A: but she's very stubborn when it comes to especially to technology and the running joke is if somebody in the family suggests it she won't listen to it

440.27 451.63 A: and one day i being the good guest decided i was going to help them take the bales of hay and put them on the truck and my arms were all like coming up in welts and i looked at myself and i said mm 

443.83 444.93 B: oh 

445.99 446.98 B: ooh 

449.22 450.01 B: oh
