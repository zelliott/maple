0.09 2.05 A: (( hi i'm evie )) 

1.55 3.26 B: hi i'm toni 

3.08 4.45 A: (( hi how are you )) 

3.88 7.24 B: okay how are you this is pretty weird [laughter] 

4.71 6.04 A: (( good )) 

6.18 9.69 A: uh-huh yeah [laughter] is this your first one [laughter] 

8.87 10.98 B: this is my first one so 

10.07 12.68 A: oh same here [laughter] okay 

11.17 12.24 B: yeah 

12.42 14.10 B: all right so i 

12.80 14.41 A: [laughter] okay 

14.12 17.39 B: guess the topic is the change in weather brings on sickness 

17.18 18.32 A: uh-huh 

18.01 19.78 B: i don't believe that do you 

19.73 26.49 A: um i i think it does sometimes you know the change of weather you know especially 

26.75 31.25 A: in those transition periods where it's cold you know when it's 

31.17 32.29 B: yeah 

31.39 39.25 A: starts getting warmer and then goes back to getting cold and you know that's at least in my case you know that's where i get mhm 

35.44 36.53 B: yeah 

38.64 48.06 B: yeah i used to think that and then you know i would watch as the seasons changed and i think that a lot of it might be allergies instead of sicknesses 

47.68 50.31 A: oh well you're right that's a good point 

50.38 53.58 A: yeah i guess in my case it's mostly allergies 

53.14 54.31 B: right 

53.60 56.77 A: like they're really bad right now [laughter] 

55.42 68.69 B: [laughter] my grandpa and i used to argue about that 'cause he told me that um it was not the change of weather because it's ah an airborne virus that makes you sick that gives you a cold and i didn't believe that for a long time [laughter] 

63.26 64.33 A: mhm 

65.25 66.40 A: yeah 

68.20 69.35 A: uh-huh 

69.19 70.25 B: and 

69.46 77.54 A: yeah but it it it you're right i mean i know that when you're when i do know that when the ch- when the weather is changing 

77.27 78.36 B: mhm 

77.58 80.81 A: you know that has some effect on your body right 'cause 

79.79 82.00 B: and it does yeah 

81.18 85.28 A: 'cause you know you might not get dressed as well or 

84.64 85.95 B: right 

85.49 86.84 A: you know and you might 

86.01 92.08 B: right and you don't wanna go you know you you don't wanna go out and be too cold but you don't wanna go out and be too hot either 

91.51 93.36 A: exactly [laughter] 

92.91 96.06 B: and so you're either over or under protecting 

95.56 102.60 A: yeah and you know that might get a might that might have some effect on getting sick but you know it's not 

100.25 101.50 B: yeah 

102.90 106.32 A: i mean i guess that then the issue is how do you 

106.52 112.05 A: protect yourself right rather than just a change of the weather per se mhm 

107.98 109.10 B: right 

111.43 112.64 B: right 

112.73 117.31 B: you know like eat good get a you know have a healthy lifestyle 

114.74 115.90 A: say that again 

117.09 122.55 A: uh-huh exactly yeah 'cause that's another thing you know that when you're 

122.80 129.44 A: in good shape and you're eating well and resting well then your immune system it's better mhm you have 

128.76 131.67 B: right take vitamins 

131.01 132.82 A: to mhm exactly 

131.95 136.19 B: my family starts taking vitamin c. the minute they start getting the sniffles 

135.58 136.65 A: uh-huh

138.03 142.23 A: uh-huh well you see i try to have vitamins every day so i can 

142.41 148.08 A: already have that boost there but i don't wait until i'm getting sick mhm 

144.65 146.03 B: right 

147.47 148.73 B: right 

149.09 154.74 B: i do but i forget to take 'em every day [laughter] i i mean to take 'em every day i just don't

170.78 171.66 B: [noise] 

174.09 183.08 A: since i moved to to where i live now i've been getting allergies and i think it's the just you know it's so different the 

179.38 181.88 B: mhm [noise] 

183.78 186.43 A: the environment here 

186.73 194.18 A: that i never had allergies before all my life you know and then to my thirties i'm starting to get allergies [laughter] 

190.58 191.88 B: (( mhm )) 

192.14 193.01 B: [noise] 

193.25 195.01 B: and i'm sorry where do you live now

197.50 199.45 B: i live in new mexico 

199.10 201.52 A: (( oh do you really [laughter] [laughter] )) 

199.84 200.74 B: yeah 

201.54 204.58 B: where we have warm weather most of the time [laughter] 

203.56 208.06 A: uh-huh what do you say i'm from puerto rico so i come from very warm weather 

207.13 210.57 B: oh yeah and then you moved over there where it's cold 

209.92 220.57 A: yeah and just with all the different kind of vegetation and flowers and stuff you know and i started to get allergies for the first time ever since i moved here yeah 

215.42 217.47 B: mhm 

220.38 221.55 B: wow 

221.70 230.86 B: yeah it's affecting s- when it starts getting colder you know everything seems to die off and um people end up getting sick 

227.05 228.26 A: mhm 

230.84 239.07 B: and you know that's hard to fall back on and say well it's allergies because they're frozen there shouldn't be any allergies when it's cold [laughter] 

235.10 236.28 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

238.30 246.14 A: mhm no but you do get 'em 'cause i mean it's not only the pollen ones but then there's all the dust in the house and the 

242.91 243.97 B: right 

245.77 248.20 B: right mold and 

247.14 250.84 A: the mold and like and everything in the house 

251.13 258.48 B: yeah and that you know i i believe like you just the best way to protect yourself is vitamins and a healthy lifestyle 

258.01 267.28 A: yeah mhm mhm yeah do you yeah exactly [laughter] did you remember any of the other questions something about the 

260.42 262.33 B: it's hard to do [laughter] 

265.83 269.46 B: um i think it just asked us um 

269.76 273.40 B: you know what how we felt about it and what we did to protect ourselves 

269.86 270.73 A: about 

272.94 277.12 A: oh okay okay and the did they say something about going to the doctor i 

277.45 279.90 A: don't know or i'm making that up 

278.14 279.15 B: um 

279.16 285.53 B: you know i i don't i didn't know if i heard it or not [laughter] i was it was real soft and i was trying real hard to listen 

280.00 282.08 A: okay [laughter] 

282.23 283.28 A: okay 

285.06 288.03 A: yeah maybe we should say that in our c 

286.21 287.10 B: but 

287.46 298.49 B: i do you know i go to the doctor if i'm sick if it lasts you know longer than a few days then yeah i feel that i should go and make sure that there's nothing else wrong 

289.87 291.15 A: mhm 

295.41 296.51 A: uh-huh 

298.10 302.20 A: yeah and for me with colds i usually 

302.21 304.87 A: you know just take care of them myself 

304.30 305.75 B: right 

305.06 308.67 A: (( like you know i i make teas or )) 

308.98 317.00 A: i m- you know made 'em i i like to when i get a cold or a sore throat i usually make just home [lipsmack] remedies you know 

316.24 317.28 B: uh-huh 

317.17 324.92 A: and ah and i try to sleep more drink lots of water so for that kind of thing i don't go to the doctor mhm 

321.03 322.13 B: right 

323.64 329.92 B: right yeah me either but if it lasts for a long time and it feels like maybe it's a sinus infection 

330.02 339.26 B: you know then i'll go and have it checked and i'm the world's worst about going to the doctor's but my family if they're sick like my kids i take 'em right away 

331.76 332.99 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

334.80 335.85 A: uh-huh 

338.95 341.10 A: (( oh yeah that's another story )) 

339.66 342.21 B: no ifs ands or buts we just go [laughter] 

341.74 347.47 A: uh-huh [laughter] yeah yeah it's another story with the kids 

347.48 351.52 A: but ah yeah i don't have to go to the doctor ah ah that much i 

351.31 354.75 B: yeah i don't either not for sicknesses 

354.61 357.27 A: don't know mhm mhm yeah just for your regular checkup 

356.35 357.29 B: right 

357.32 360.55 B: yeah and and it's really weird how colds happen 

360.94 363.26 B: how they spread so quickly 

362.82 365.06 A: mhm mhm yeah and um 

363.89 370.91 B: and it's hard especially for kids 'cause they're in school all day with other kids who are spreading the germs 

370.58 371.70 A: uh-huh 

371.69 379.74 B: and it's really hard to say you know to tell well my kid's not running a fever so it might be allergies 

379.26 380.43 A: mhm 

379.81 382.01 B: but it might not be 

381.55 382.91 A: mhm 

382.31 387.97 B: it's hard you know for as parents to decide if we should send our kids to school or not 

387.45 390.70 A: exactly and they can't tell you you know 

390.65 391.75 B: right 

390.84 401.66 A: as well 'cause you know when you're older after going through so many colds [laughter] in your life or allergies you you can distinguish the symptoms with with the kids 

396.31 397.58 B: right 

401.23 402.47 B: right 

401.76 405.28 A: it's a different story are they very young your kids 

405.06 409.49 B: um i have an eleven year old and i have um a nine year old 

406.57 407.50 A: uh-huh 

409.20 410.33 A: okay 

410.68 417.26 B: so yeah they're they're fairly young we've been through our our colds and flus and 

415.63 419.97 A: okay uh-huh uh-huh did you get flu shots as a prevention 

417.35 418.37 B: and 

419.53 421.77 B: i do they don't 

420.24 422.17 A: (( uh-huh okay mhm mhm )) 

422.00 425.12 B: um the doctor hasn't recommended it for them 

425.25 428.28 B: if she ever did i you know i would probably get them 

428.57 429.51 B: um 

429.56 433.24 B: it's kinda scary because they um 

431.12 432.08 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

433.27 437.70 B: they say that you have to um get 'em every year if you start getting 'em once 

437.34 438.48 A: (( mhm mm )) 

437.99 439.95 B: so you should get 'em every year 

440.06 444.99 B: and they're so young you know i don't know if they wanna go the rest of their lives getting shots 

441.20 442.25 A: mhm 

444.62 448.41 A: exactly yeah that's the thing that you have to 

449.68 452.04 A: you have to then get them every year 

451.80 462.28 B: right and my doctor's recommended them for me because i have other problems and she recommended it for me she basically told me i was doing it i didn't have a choice [laughter] 

460.12 461.45 A: mhm 

461.49 463.99 A: mhm mhm mhm yeah 

462.75 466.22 B: and you know i i haven't got sick since she made me take one 

465.86 466.92 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

466.48 469.14 B: i haven't even had a cold or anything 

469.91 472.65 B: and i'm not you know i'm not a healthy person 

469.95 470.81 A: yeah 

472.40 474.40 A: you're not or you're no

489.16 490.36 A: (( mhm )) 

489.83 492.73 B: because i have so much else going on with my body

497.79 498.97 A: (( yeah i [mn] )) 

497.90 499.88 B: and i think the flu shot helped [noise] 

499.71 504.35 A: uh-huh that's good yeah i don't really you know 

504.98 509.06 A: i don't know i guess you know i work out a lot and i eat very well and i

530.62 532.61 B: so you're trying to stay healthier 

532.19 534.01 A: uh-huh exactly

570.72 572.07 B: right 

573.25 574.90 A: (( pollen [laughter] )) 

573.43 582.07 B: yeah and i- it's hard to determine if it's allergies or a cold and you take the allergy medicine sometimes it doesn't work because it is a cold 

577.26 578.37 A: uh-huh 

581.43 582.59 A: mhm mhm 

582.14 585.84 B: and sometimes you take a cold medicine and it doesn't work 'cause it's allergies

589.86 590.66 B: (( [mn] )) 

598.53 599.90 A: any kinds of infection
