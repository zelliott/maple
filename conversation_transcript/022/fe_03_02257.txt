53.79 58.82 B: [noise] me too and i don't know if everybody's like that but [noise] i know i am and 

58.89 64.46 B: it just sometimes i think to myself is it worse having a sore throat and a runny nose 

64.56 68.66 B: or is it worse to be vomiting and have diarrhea no matter what [laughter] you know 

68.50 70.68 A: [laughter] i'll take the sore throat thank you 

68.77 69.50 B: (( it's )) 

69.75 71.60 B: yeah yeah it's [laughter] 

71.68 80.86 B: it's hard to fall asleep when you're sick and you don't wanna eat right or you just feel horrible and i don't know if you have kids and i have kids and they're sick all the time 

73.80 74.85 A: mhm 

75.28 76.27 A: mhm

85.08 89.52 B: passed my allergies on to them and now i don't have em as bad as they do but 

88.76 96.09 A: yeah that's funny 'cause mine too my oldest daughter she goes for allergy shots twice a week she's been going for a year and they're still not helping her 

95.56 96.55 B: wow 

96.48 97.99 A: it's horrible [mn] 

97.20 99.02 B: and my son has gone 

99.35 109.22 B: [noise] gee probably since [noise] he's four or five and he's twelve now so it is getting better but not better to the point where he can't have anything he still needs medicine 'cause he's sick a lot 

108.67 112.90 A: mhm yeah my daughter's constantly getting um sinus infections 

110.87 118.84 B: in fact he was home yeah he was home from school today and i just feel horrible and well the pollen count's pretty high that might be a reason why 

118.54 119.60 A: mhm 

119.05 122.09 B: [sigh] watery eyes you know and everything 

122.92 129.23 B: plus it's it's harder i don't know about you but it's hard for us to always run to the doctor every time we're sick because 

128.33 129.17 A: mhm 

129.27 132.69 B: even though we have a co pay medicine is really really expensive 

132.26 133.13 A: mhm 

132.82 142.69 B: and my husband lost his job in january so we've been without insurance until he starts the new job tomorrow but i'm sure benefits don't kick in for thirty to ninety days 

135.38 136.29 A: (( oh )) 

136.78 137.77 A: (( that's a shame )) 

141.86 143.14 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

142.82 149.28 B: and i went to the doctor 'cause i have poison ivy head to toe and i was gonna let it go and but it was so bad 

149.39 152.23 B: eighty two dollars just to see the doctor 

149.40 151.53 A: (( you finally had to did you n- )) 

151.75 153.72 A: did you take benadryl to try 

152.86 165.33 B: i took everything and i still have the itching i have it for a week and a half it's it was so bad it turned to cellulitis which if you left that untreated for seven days you get gangrene and then they have to cut out all the bad 

160.10 161.20 A: oh oh okay 

165.06 166.09 A: (( oh no mhm mhm )) 

165.35 168.61 B: [sigh] patches of gangrene so i i was glad i went 

169.22 172.62 B: i wasn't glad about the eighty two dollar bill you know for 

171.51 175.68 A: couldn't you get any kind of coverage through the state while you were on unemployment 

173.95 176.47 B: oh no we make too much money 

176.28 179.94 A: oh [laughter] that makes no sense if you have no job though 

176.68 178.52 B: [laughter] 

179.19 189.77 B: i know but he they go by what you previously made so [sigh] they will they're in the process of insuring my kids but i'm sure 'til that goes through my husband's benefits will have kicked in so 

189.08 190.35 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

190.22 192.40 B: sort of a catch twenty two there 

191.99 192.85 A: yeah 

192.86 200.37 A: well i know my older my younger daughter just graduated from grad school and she couldn't get a job so we were paying cobra for her because 

193.09 193.82 B: but 

199.20 200.39 B: oh 

200.38 206.33 A: i didn't want her without insurance that and she wound up she's in calagard and she wound up hurting herself 

201.64 202.95 B: oh yeah 

206.45 210.25 A: so she needed an m._r._i. of her knee and that the cobra you know would have 

209.59 211.83 B: thank goodness you have 

210.48 212.67 A: what we paid would've you know 

212.45 213.46 B: right 

213.22 216.07 A: we would have really been in big trouble if we hadn't paid [laughter] 

215.32 220.42 B: exactly it's like scary to think about people that say they don't have insurance and 

219.53 221.82 A: oh i know and a lot of people don't 

221.21 225.02 B: you just never know you know it can happen today and tomorrow and 

224.83 225.94 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

225.32 227.75 B: being sick is no picnic or fun 

227.41 232.02 A: no but like i said i never just get a cold i don't think i've ever had just a cold 

228.06 228.65 B: (( [mn] )) 

231.59 232.75 B: how old are you 

232.64 234.45 A: old [laughter] 

233.46 234.89 B: (( how old )) 

234.64 236.20 A: (( fifty four )) 

235.61 245.59 B: um i'm forty five and i have been that way since i'm little you know i just it can't come and go in two or three days it's it wipes me out it's 

239.79 240.97 A: yeah me too 

244.84 249.99 A: other people get colds i get pneumonia [laughter] other people get colds i get bronchitis 

246.62 249.15 B: y- yeah you know and i think too 

249.40 256.29 B: i think for the past ten years that's it if i don't get a cold treated with a antibiotic it turns to bronchitis too you know where i'm 

254.96 256.34 A: mhm mhm 

256.35 259.32 B: really need something strong and 

258.01 261.61 A: yeah that's how i am and both my children are like that 

261.73 263.82 A: i don't know it's strange 

261.88 262.61 B: (( so )) 

262.64 267.79 B: i guess it doesn't matter where you live then that you know nice weather bad weather 

264.72 265.55 A: no 

268.27 275.78 B: because we've been sick in the summer we've been sick in the winter you know and most people say summer that's a strange time to get sick but 

271.50 272.64 A: mhm 

275.94 283.62 A: no we've had bad c- well the you know they say when you have allergies that you're um resistance is lower and i think that's really true 

277.12 278.27 B: yeah 

281.31 282.63 B: i believe it 

282.96 286.90 B: i i believe that my husband is rarely ever sick maybe 

285.92 287.59 A: no mine mine either 

286.99 290.97 B: maybe once in the last twenty years yeah 

288.96 293.75 A: yeah that's how my husband is and if he gets sick he gets really sick he doesn't get colds either [laughter] 

293.17 294.15 B: oh 

294.50 296.01 A: [laughter] but 

294.93 296.78 B: no my husband's 

296.15 298.81 A: i don't know like i said i don't know anybody that 

299.17 302.04 A: gets just a plain cold i don't know 

301.08 303.01 B: yeah it's 

303.33 308.83 B: my mother too she's like eighty four and when she gets a cold too she needs an antibiotic because 

309.05 314.57 B: she'll try to fight it off for about three weeks and i'm like okay do you want to go to the doctor now yeah 

313.41 314.39 A: mhm 

314.60 316.68 A: i guess so after three weeks 

314.89 319.52 B: you know and then she thinks next time gee i'd better go right away because 

319.96 325.32 B: i don't wanna make it wait so long and then usually if she does go to the doctor they say 

325.53 328.67 B: ah right now it's viral there's nothing we can do for ya 

327.52 336.73 A: oh i know that's i just went two weeks ago i went and they told me that and now my mucus is starting to turn color so [laughter] i know i have to go back 

329.57 331.21 B: [laughter] 

331.83 340.09 B: and then it yeah yeah so then once it's colored then okay here here's the antibiotic and it eventually turns to that [noise] 

336.90 337.93 A: mhm 

339.27 344.79 A: if [mn] there's a virus that's going around and it's three weeks it'll take three weeks to get rid of it 

345.22 346.71 B: yeah 

345.76 349.43 A: i i knew that it wasn't gonna go [laughter] away by itself 

348.63 352.44 B: [noise] yeah it's [noise] my husband 

352.76 355.73 B: weed whacking so i'm moving to a different phone 

355.19 356.56 A: oh okay 

356.45 361.84 B: i told him don't don't do that until ten minutes are up but [noise] [noise] is it 

359.32 363.32 A: oh it's raining here so [laughter] yeah it just started 

361.97 363.80 B: oh it's a beautiful sunny 

364.10 366.38 B: sunny day now it rained all morning 

366.13 370.51 A: oh see now we had the sunny day 'til about an hour ago and it started raining 

369.01 372.73 B: oh and and my mother says don't go out in the rain you'll get sick 

372.57 375.24 A: [laughter] that's an old wives' tale 

372.89 374.35 B: and i say mom 

374.63 380.36 B: yeah it doesn't have anything to do with it germs cause illness not wetness or cold or 

378.28 379.15 A: mhm 

380.01 387.50 A: 'cause i used to yell at my girls they used to go to high school with their hair wet and i used to say don't go out they said that's not gonna make us sick mhm 

383.19 384.23 B: [noise] yes 

386.38 393.25 B: [noise] yeah or the doctor will say people say don't go out in the winter without a coat winter coat on and 

393.38 399.00 B: no that has nothing to do with it [noise] if you don't wanna wear a coat then don't wear one but you won't get sick 

399.43 400.28 A: (( exactly mhm mhm )) 

399.80 400.87 B: [noise] 

400.44 411.79 A: but like well i don't know to me like the what they just told us to discuss is ridiculous because if i don't go to the doctor my cold's gonna last a lot longer than seven days [laughter] 

411.19 423.19 B: right you know i don't know very well i guess i do know some people that it's only three or four days and sometimes they don't need medicine but i don't know have you tried over the counter things 'cause they don't work for me 

422.70 426.69 A: well my daughter was big on vitamin c. and echinacea 

427.32 430.54 B: and yeah for a while 

427.40 430.63 A: and she said it was working for a while but i don't know 

430.98 436.69 B: yeah i i think vitamins help too but to an extent um i 

436.68 439.47 B: i- i don't know you can eat as healthy as you want 

439.43 453.23 B: my sister's a dance teacher she's fifty seven or fifty eight years old she's thin she works out every day eats healthy and she has colon cancer so i mean [noise] i'm overweight and i don't eat healthy and i 

449.00 449.76 A: (( oh )) 

453.36 463.64 B: don't have anything you know i've been tested and it's negative so i guess it really doesn't matter how you eat or how well you rest or [noise] or what you do if you're gonna get sick you're gonna get it regardless that's true but i i don't know i i think that allergies really ah do play havoc with your resistance 

463.07 464.02 A: mhm 

465.14 467.88 A: (( i don't 'cause i have )) 

468.53 471.17 A: (( two mhm [noise] )) 

470.64 472.16 B: mhm i 

472.90 475.74 B: i seem to think that now that you mentioned it yeah 

472.98 475.17 A: and everybody i know has allergies 

476.04 479.64 A: i i don't know anybody who doesn't have allergies at this point so 

477.82 478.53 B: i 

478.67 480.58 B: i don't either so don't think 

480.40 482.22 A: i think that the um 

482.35 483.37 A: it's just 

483.45 486.67 A: a of um because of our environment 

486.19 492.23 B: [noise] yeah i know it wasn't as bad years ago when i was a kid and it [noise] and it is now 

491.80 493.15 A: mhm mhm 

492.46 493.45 B: people 

493.25 496.94 A: 'cause my li- my nephew's two years old and he just started allergy shots 

496.34 497.48 B: oh 

497.76 500.72 A: because it's he get so many sinus infections 

497.87 498.53 B: (( [noise] i )) 

498.72 502.28 B: sad [noise] seeing such a little one sick like that 

501.86 503.27 A: mhm mhm 

503.04 503.60 B: (( [noise] )) 

504.62 510.08 A: but there's nothing they can do to they say that's the reason he gets all the sinus infections 

505.93 506.96 B: right 

510.54 512.70 B: from all the [noise] allergies 

511.36 516.63 A: from having the allergies and the allergies brings your resistance down and then you can't fight it off 

515.90 521.72 B: [noise] yeah things people weren't allergic to years ago if they are now allergic to them 

521.42 522.71 A: mhm mhm 

523.74 526.13 A: so i really believe that if 

526.18 530.70 A: they could do something to t- take care of allergies that maybe people wouldn't be as sick 

529.80 536.89 B: [noise] they'd have pretty much yeah cover and now this new sars scare everybody seems to be getting 

534.54 536.12 A: mhm mhm 

537.60 540.03 B: [noise] or hearing about it getting ah 

540.35 549.16 B: [noise] information in the paper or the mail and [noise] they die of this and don't travel here don't travel there and it's probably only a matter of time until it's 

549.31 551.33 B: gonna [noise] be around local 

551.02 553.90 A: well they say it's ba- well it is it is in new york 

552.82 554.14 B: it is already 

553.94 556.65 A: and um connecticut and new york they said 

555.87 557.11 B: wow 

556.82 564.47 A: but what they're saying is that um that it's just another thing like pneumonia more people die of pneumonia than have died of that 

557.30 557.86 B: (( [noise] )) 

564.46 565.40 B: wow 

566.13 567.64 A: so i don't know i 

566.94 568.71 B: yeah 

568.43 575.52 A: i think you know as many more germs become resistant to antibiotics we're gonna see more and more different things 

575.10 585.54 B: [noise] [noise] that's true and i always hear a commercial on the radio every day about aids [noise] do you know how much medicine costs for aids blah blah blah if you can't afford your medicine blah blah blah blah blah 

579.78 580.72 A: mhm 

585.58 599.30 B: and i'm thinking how 'bout the people that are needing medicine every day for other things besides aids you don't think [noise] it's expensive for them to afford it [noise] it it is expensive [noise] it's expensive for everybody well i'm lucky i haven't 

597.70 598.55 A: (( mhm )) 

598.59 599.92 A: (( mhm uh-huh ))
