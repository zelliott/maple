156.13 157.31 B: oh really 

162.13 163.17 B: yeah 

162.21 176.03 A: and there's a restaurant that's fairly close to me that has the greatest ribs and you get a lot of them i'll go with two other people we'll split two dinners and there's plenty to take home for two you know for both of us 

175.61 176.61 B: yeah 

176.27 182.21 A: you know it's like it's usually like my mom and dad and myself and then i'll take half home and they'll half home 

182.38 183.37 B: right 

182.52 186.62 A: because they give you a large a large plate of food 

186.41 189.53 B: yeah we like that when you can take some home [laughter] 

188.81 195.51 A: [laughter] yeah and i eat it for breakfast [laughter] or sn- oh anything 

191.88 193.88 B: breakfast ribs 

194.98 196.18 B: [laughter] 

195.87 199.91 A: anything i'm not crazy about breakfast foods so 

199.53 200.63 B: oh really 

200.02 206.53 A: um yeah i milk doesn't agree with me so um you know there goes your cereal 

206.12 207.21 B: yeah 

206.65 209.84 A: you know everything for breakfast is really unhealthy 

209.49 217.57 B: oh it is my husband though he gets up every morning and eats um fixes himself an omelet with those um the healthy eggs 

210.55 211.51 A: (( so )) 

217.16 218.01 A: (( uh-huh )) 

218.14 224.38 B: with tomatoes and mushrooms and like fresh vegetables in it so and he's real he's a real health nut so 

221.86 223.20 A: (( wow )) 

223.60 225.36 A: right 

224.66 228.98 B: he gets up and eats that and a few slices of turkey bacon so 

228.50 229.43 A: uh-huh 

229.32 234.13 B: and i'm too lazy to get up that early so i just a fruit and cereal bar and 

233.49 235.53 A: right right i 

234.53 236.10 B: orange juice or something 

237.24 238.31 B: but um 

238.16 240.13 A: i love fresh fruit 

239.96 241.82 B: yeah we do too 

241.80 243.12 A: but um 

243.90 249.64 B: where abouts we live right in the middle of the mountains so we're kind of at a dis- disadvantage for restaurants it's 

249.09 250.07 A: (( ah huh )) 

249.86 258.09 B: a very resort area have you ever heard of brekenridge and all those ski places well we're like six miles from brekenridge so 

253.94 254.62 A: (( uh-huh )) 

255.35 256.40 A: sure 

258.09 271.21 B: you don't have your normal chains here but all the restaurants are like super expensive you know like gourmet or they're just not very good so that's another reason we don't eat out a lot just because 

260.98 262.37 A: right 

265.68 266.54 A: (( uh-huh )) 

269.90 279.67 A: right right and we have i'm kind of in west los angeles so we have everything here [laughter] oh yeah 

277.16 278.18 B: (( really )) 

278.95 280.45 B: we have nothing 

280.15 283.38 A: (( [laughter] so that's um )) 

283.90 285.32 B: that's another reason 

284.04 295.74 A: so whenever i get the opportunity to go out i do but usually when if i i have a foreign student sometimes and i have to cook so i do the you know the chicken on the grill 

287.18 288.07 B: (( yeah )) 

295.24 296.08 B: uh-huh 

295.91 301.40 A: or i make good macaroni and cheese [laughter] 

299.02 302.11 B: oh really [laughter] i love macaroni and cheese 

301.71 303.28 A: oh i do too 

303.31 307.98 A: um and that's really good cold too [laughter] 

307.42 309.41 B: so what is your favorite meal 

309.87 312.13 B: is that a question they asked us 

309.88 311.02 A: (( my favorite )) 

311.73 313.76 A: as far as um 

314.21 316.50 A: favorite meal would be 

316.99 317.97 A: (( ah )) 

317.99 319.96 A: probably chicken 

320.00 324.39 A: i just like chicken a lot chicken and turkey 

324.02 324.92 B: uh-huh 

324.94 326.02 A: um 

327.36 331.20 A: salad gotta have salad with my with my meal 

328.41 329.36 B: salad 

330.03 331.84 B: i love salad mhm 

331.29 341.97 A: um yeah i mean that can be it i'm not crazy about potatoes you know i don't need sure i eat french fries and i eat baked potatoes sometimes depending what i'm eating 

335.33 336.28 B: mhm 

342.13 343.20 A: um 

343.42 344.59 A: but i 

344.71 354.15 A: have to have my salad and i can make this salad as long as i have my salad so by the time i one reason when i go out 

346.33 347.29 B: right 

354.47 364.82 A: at that restaurant i was telling you that i take half the ribs home is because they give you a fairly decent size salad and you get it before your meal i mean you know that's the beginning 

356.00 356.89 B: mhm 

362.74 363.55 B: mhm 

364.95 366.30 A: and so 

366.33 371.42 A: you know it's so much chewing that by the time you get the meal i'm kind of tired of chewing 

371.40 372.50 B: yeah 

371.80 378.23 A: and so you know i kind of slow down and [laughter] my my 

374.21 375.68 B: right 

377.13 378.66 B: and you can take it home 

378.64 380.15 A: yeah 

379.53 382.31 B: you take your ribs home [laughter] [laughter] 

380.61 385.16 A: yeah but i love eating that the salad and there's 

383.89 386.11 B: yeah i love a good salad too 

385.51 389.04 A: yeah matter of fact today i went and bought um 

389.31 395.14 A: i didn't make a good salad tonight because i didn't have the space or the time to do it i kind of took a nap 

395.25 402.90 A: i um you know bought a bunch of stuff for the salad i went to a like a vegetable market 

399.57 400.49 B: mhm 

402.97 414.67 A: and where the prices were really good [laughter] so i bought a bunch of stuff for to make really good salad i didn't even make it all i did for for the salad tonight 'cause i made um asparagus 

405.26 406.18 B: right 

415.39 416.17 B: mhm 

416.10 423.06 A: is just cut up tomato and cut up cucumber that was the kind of a salad i just didn't have the time to do it 

422.88 424.06 B: yeah 

423.35 428.18 A: um but it was okay but i would have preferred having a bowl you know a salad bowl 

427.93 428.87 B: yeah 

428.31 432.22 A: you know with mixed stuff in it what do you eat what do you like what's your favorite 

431.89 433.83 B: i don't i have so many 

433.16 434.66 A: when you're at home 

434.79 439.11 B: when i'm at home probably um mashed potatoes 

439.64 441.34 B: (( and ah )) 

441.91 445.03 B: maybe a roast pot roast beef roast 

443.99 445.06 A: oh 

445.13 446.13 A: (( uh-huh )) 

445.57 454.28 B: mashed potatoes and i could live with just that if there was nothing else [laughter] of course salad goes with that too i love potatoes 

450.58 452.27 A: right right 

453.84 454.79 A: (( uh-huh )) 

454.43 464.29 B: but trying to cut back they're i'm not i mean i'm very small but you know when i hit forty or something my metabolism is going to go down the drain so i'm trying to 

463.56 468.57 A: and i've hit it already and it already has [laughter] yeah 

466.03 467.78 B: oh really [laughter] 

467.98 482.76 B: well i'm trying to start now and learn how to do without you know just have um every once in a while or or whatnot and it's hard 'cause they are so satisfying like i love a salad but it's just not when i'm really hungry it's not satisfying like 

474.91 476.43 A: right right 

483.13 488.90 B: creamed potatoes are i mean i just make creamed potatoes and eat those you know they are so bad for you 

484.42 486.03 A: right right 

486.77 493.34 A: yeah well if you had half the creamed potatoes and then half the salad you'd probably still feel satisfied 

493.02 498.27 B: i would yeah it's not good as it's not as good as not eating potatoes at all but [laughter] 

496.96 499.17 A: right right right 

498.88 508.48 B: but so i'd say i would probably have to say pot roast and creamed potatoes are i don't know my grandmother makes great chicken and dumplings if i could eat her chicken and dumplings that would be 

508.23 512.31 A: you'd be in heaven [laughter] 

508.54 510.17 B: (( be my favorite too ))
