86.32 90.87 A: i- i- often i eat out because i don't have time to cook at home 

91.01 96.13 B: mhm yeah i think one of the problems with eating out though is that i 

96.56 102.10 B: (( always end up eating too much like if you go to a restaurant and you sit down )) 

101.63 102.21 A: (( but )) 

102.25 108.31 B: and there's so much food and it's really good and [laughter] i just eat and eat and eat 

107.04 110.20 A: mhm mhm 

108.35 112.30 B: and at home it's like you make stuff and 

112.52 116.05 B: (( portions and you just eat what you want and then save it whatever )) 

115.36 116.75 A: yeah 

117.24 119.25 A: i sometimes doggy bag

132.26 133.40 A: uh-huh 

134.11 135.42 A: yeah

144.45 148.72 A: like 'cause one of the questions was ah is what um

150.73 151.62 B: mhm 

152.40 161.26 A: i wasn't thinking necessarily in terms of what i was eating but i was thinking in terms of like not having to worry about like cleaning the kitchen and putting away 

158.09 159.41 B: [laughter] 

160.06 160.79 B: [laughter] 

161.29 163.46 A: the dishes and

187.83 188.43 B: (( okay )) 

190.62 193.98 B: if you could have anything right now [laughter] what would it be 

193.48 196.33 A: um i was just gonna start making a 

196.65 199.60 A: a sesame and noodle salad 

199.70 201.36 B: (( mm sounds good )) 

200.75 204.09 A: but then i bought the ingredients for it last week but then the 

204.37 210.09 A: um cucumber is getting moldy [laughter] i have to figure out a plan b. how 'bout you 

206.95 207.52 B: (( mm )) 

211.11 221.05 B: oh i just ate so i'm not really hungry [laughter] i've had like enough food um my room mate made chicken parmesan she likes she is a 

213.39 215.15 A: oh really what did you eat 

221.38 223.53 B: meat eater mostly so she 

222.63 223.49 A: mhm 

223.66 224.89 B: only cooks meat 

224.74 226.04 A: mhm 

225.32 229.79 B: so i started eating more meat even though i still like veggies 

227.66 228.90 A: mhm 

229.70 230.56 A: mhm 

230.44 231.61 B: (( but um )) 

231.72 237.98 B: she does she buys a lot of vegetables and she waits until they're almost moldy [laughter] and then she cuts them up 

237.43 239.85 A: [noise] throws them all in one dish usually 

238.36 239.03 B: [laughter] 

239.78 244.99 B: (( yes you know it's like i gotta make something with this )) 

240.60 241.33 A: (( mm )) 

243.66 246.49 A: what was it chicken parmesan or egg plant parmesan 

246.70 248.00 B: she made chicken 

247.75 251.12 A: chicken parmesan i 'cause i had a egg plant parmesan last night 

251.61 252.27 B: (( yep )) 

252.30 253.52 A: (( let's just see [noise] )) 

253.54 254.38 A: um 

254.54 256.97 B: (( mm [laughter] um )) 

257.13 259.53 B: yes egg plant parmesan is one of my 

259.68 261.34 B: specialties that i cook 

260.69 261.82 A: oh really 

262.38 263.53 A: how do you make it 

264.51 270.47 B: yeah um it takes a really long time 'cause it's better when you slice the egg plant really really thin 

270.18 271.20 A: oh 

270.81 271.70 B: but 

271.89 275.15 B: it's really bad for you 'cause you have to fry everything 

274.71 275.69 A: yeah 

275.41 285.15 B: and so if you see me making it you probably won't want to eat it but it's delicious and you you don't realise how much oil has gone in it but 

280.85 281.96 A: [laughter] 

284.35 291.32 A: yeah yeah my boyfriend makes it and he doesn't slice it slice the egg plant super thin like how thin do you slice it 

285.23 285.85 B: (( ah yeah )) 

291.84 294.98 B: as thin as i can without cutting myself [laughter] 

293.97 295.81 A: oh really oh that thin huh 

295.76 298.92 B: and then it just takes forever to fry too 'cause 

298.28 301.35 A: yeah i- it seems like a really labor intensive 

301.69 305.30 A: meal but i mean it's really rich and good 

305.96 309.05 B: yeah i like foods that are really bad for me 

308.67 309.79 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

309.32 315.51 B: i'm i'm one of those people who's like i could get the low fat [laughter] but it's not as delicious 

312.95 313.79 A: uh-huh 

314.72 320.54 A: [noise] yeah i know i i feel that way too [noise] especially like being mostly
