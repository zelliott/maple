63.99 68.85 A: um there's a- an artificial sweetener sweetener called splendor 

69.08 70.74 A: it's a lot like sugar 

70.95 77.15 A: but it's not exactly the same and it's not working out so well yet but i'm work- i'm working on that 

74.84 75.75 B: mhm 

78.66 79.76 A: (( i )) 

78.78 85.27 B: i cooked for a di- a lady that's a diabetic and i always make her regular sugar products so i was thinking you know 

85.31 89.51 B: what could i use as a substitute that would be as good 

89.40 92.69 A: yeah it's pretty good um it 

93.03 100.88 A: comes in a yellow box that's the same size as like the two pound boxes of sugar it's real expensive though and it it 

100.97 102.56 A: it's okay for sweetening 

102.80 107.33 A: ah for sweetening it's pretty close to sugar but if you cook with it it it 

107.87 113.52 A: doesn't match [laughter] it doesn't do the same thing yeah 

109.19 111.75 B: mhm that's interesting 

114.00 123.11 A: so we're supposed to talk about ah whether we like to go out to eat or to eat at home is that what the thing said 

122.03 127.07 B: yeah that's it what would be our ideal meal if we went out after that 

127.41 130.23 A: oh okay i didn't hear it i couldn't hear 

130.41 131.33 A: clearly 

130.93 132.19 B: (( i think ))

144.64 146.31 A: yeah 

144.80 146.10 B: yeah 

146.24 148.77 B: like those kind of buffets like i 

149.17 151.19 B: just like a roast beef dinner 

152.28 155.41 B: mashed potatoes and things like that 

154.33 155.98 A: yeah 

156.68 158.12 A: (( i like ah )) 

158.31 161.48 A: my ah favorite restaurant right now 

161.55 170.25 A: i i have two kids a six year old and a two year old so w- what works real well for us right now is ah buffets because 

170.30 176.99 A: like they can like the six year old is old enough that she can we can take her up there and she can pick out what she wants 

177.61 178.68 B: mhm 

177.76 185.52 A: and so we can get her to eat something she's a real picky eater a two year old you can basically set anything in front of him and it's 

186.06 188.71 A: it'll get going but 

187.51 189.49 B: that's good 

188.85 190.35 A: yeah 

190.72 198.04 B: it's hard when they are more picky eaters none of mine were i was fortunate not too bad

205.11 207.11 B: and have kids of their own 

208.06 211.25 A: yeah i've got two little ones but 

211.42 214.36 A: i don't know they're not allowed to grow up [laughter] 

214.19 218.24 B: yeah i have a lot of those little ones around my grandchildren 

218.32 220.15 A: yeah 

222.44 223.85 A: some day i suppose 

225.68 228.48 B: i like we go out for breakfast a lot too 

230.18 231.63 A: i think we 

231.69 236.20 A: we we never wake up in time for breakfast a- all of us are pretty much evening 

236.62 238.69 A: ah evening people 

238.98 242.35 A: i think i've made it to breakfast like twice in the last year 

242.04 247.84 B: well we go at noon sometimes sometimes it's suppertime just because we like to get it 

247.68 248.89 A: (( yeah i )) 

248.94 252.77 A: think mcdonald's should serve breakfast like all day 

253.12 257.01 B: that would be nice they sh- should at least till noon 

257.09 261.81 A: yeah yeah li- like on the weekends especially 

261.57 262.91 B: (( for sure )) 

264.77 269.83 B: [laughter] the biggest treat of my family is to go to texas roadhouse we all love it 

269.31 277.66 A: yeah tex i like texas roadhouse we have that here they used to have really good ribs but ah i don't think they're as good as they used to be 

278.71 283.89 B: they're pretty good here 'cause my family that's got them really like them but i haven't tried them i have the steak i 

284.56 297.13 A: yeah w- we went there a couple of weeks ago i think oh i had had the ribs then and um but yeah i think i'm gonna stick to steak there 

296.52 298.71 B: think it all depends on the cook

301.10 302.82 B: how good they cook it 

302.81 305.09 A: yeah that's another good reason 

304.07 306.03 B: they probably have recipes 

306.40 308.55 A: what's that 

307.61 310.15 B: they probably make them follow a recipe 

310.09 316.57 A: yeah that's another good reason to go to like golden coral 'cause if you don't like your steak you 

316.89 317.78 A: can 

318.13 321.70 A: you know like eat half of it and go up and get a different one

402.89 404.27 A: he was there for 

405.12 407.83 A: i don't know like four years or so 

408.63 409.74 A: and ah 

409.76 413.47 A: you know a single guy had an apartment with like a t._v. and a bed 

413.98 417.75 A: he was on the road most of the other most of the rest of the time
