4.81 6.34 A: okay good how are you 

6.70 8.12 B: (( not too bad )) 

8.26 12.76 A: all right wasn't ah wasn't expecting this ah what was the quote again now 

12.67 17.21 B: i believe we're supposed to be talking about illness and seasonal affective disorder [laughter] 

16.49 20.48 A: yeah so how how do you prevent from uh getting sick 

20.80 27.23 A: i ah i go to the gym you know i try to eat well and um you know i take my echinacea 

27.29 33.53 B: echinacea you did not hear of this study that says a german study that said echinacea actually will lower your sperm count if you're a guy 

33.70 39.75 A: really well then i guess i won't pass my unhealthy genes on to ah to children at least huh [laughter] 

35.84 37.34 B: [laughter] 

38.46 41.31 B: you're very very healthy but sterile unfortunately 

40.93 42.63 A: [laughter] 

41.35 46.50 B: i don't think it's there i just read that somewhere because i used to be a big fan of echinacea and now i'm not 

45.79 54.07 A: i don't know sometimes there's a smear campaigns out there to uh to discredit homeopathy i nev- you never know from which ah from which way the ah the swing comes 

52.57 57.03 B: yeah exactly and both slants are skewed unfortunately 

56.26 65.74 A: yeah yeah but ah but yeah i trust things that come from the ground before i do prescription stuff overall um but nothing's nothing's a bible you know nothing's gospel 

65.77 74.49 B: that's funny because i skew the other ways i'd rather have something that went through an extensive testing period than something that somebody says hey this made me feel good [laughter] 

70.47 71.65 A: right 

74.29 83.50 A: well no i mean these things date back to antiquity i mean they've been working for centuries you know but i uh you know i to each his own you know whatever whatever works for you 

82.91 87.69 B: oh yeah i i'm definitely a big fan of anything you want to do go ahead as long as it doesn't bother me any 

87.67 88.80 A: yeah 

88.17 93.29 B: so you know when i read about these chinese king pills for example i read about these a while back 

93.34 98.69 B: supposed to be the best thing for best thing since sliced bread and then you read the ingredients and among it is mercury 

93.58 94.59 A: (( oh yeah )) 

99.00 100.13 A: (( ah )) 

100.27 102.40 B: heavy metals [laughter] 

100.41 101.42 A: geeze 

102.09 106.37 A: we get enough of that in our drinking water for god's sake [laughter] 

104.60 106.87 B: yeah you heard about uh perk 

107.16 108.47 A: what is it 

107.93 111.45 B: perk uh it's it's rocket fuel basically 

108.85 109.75 A: no 

111.14 112.98 A: oh wow wha- what's that in 

112.85 116.34 B: it's in basically everything right now it's in our water 

115.91 126.32 A: oh wow yeah i know i know enough about the fluoride and aluminium and all those things chromium got enough we got enough to go around right now we're pretty pretty got our hands full [laughter] 

120.20 121.30 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

125.63 134.34 B: the really insidious one is uh during the winter something like during the winter something like sixty or seventy percent of our lettuce comes from this one area 

128.78 130.06 A: wow 

133.82 135.11 A: really 

134.81 140.37 B: which if you eat it if you say if you're saying you want to be healthy and i'm going to eat salads and all that all day long 

139.76 140.89 A: yeah 

140.91 146.97 B: and it turns out that you'll actually be getting something like three or four times the f._d._a. recommended dose of perk 

147.23 148.12 A: wow 

147.26 149.66 B: which is it's rocket fuel 

149.58 155.63 A: well i'm sure i'm sure you get that even if you don't eat the salad so you might as well eat the salad and get the good with the bad you know [laughter] 

154.60 157.85 B: yeah but it concentrates that's the thing 

157.54 159.52 A: in in lettuce specifically 

158.61 162.21 B: (( yeah in lettuce evidentially just [laughter] )) 

160.36 164.96 A: oh right well then i go with spinach i go with one of the other leafs [laughter] 

162.34 166.76 B: [laughter] i suspect it works the same 

165.30 171.55 A: i don't think you get that much out of lettuce anyway i think you have to eat hordes and hordes of lettuce to get something you know really anyway it's mostly water 

170.73 174.15 B: yeah sure it's all yeah no nutritional value it'd be 

171.60 172.81 A: yeah 

174.40 176.46 A: very little anyway yeah 

175.40 177.71 B: a support system for dressing 

177.87 183.37 A: yeah well you know i think organic tends to give you a little more nutrients than uh non organic anyway 

183.54 186.62 B: (( um i don't know about that but at least you don't get the pesticides )) 

183.74 184.78 A: but uh [mn] 

186.81 188.40 B: and you don't get the um 

188.21 199.77 A: yeah i don't know i think sometimes when things are prepared with a good energy or ah you know i think sometimes there's more of a quality to when you're eating it you're getting some of that back but that's on more of a metaphysical level i guess [laughter] 

196.03 197.28 B: (( oh do you )) 

198.96 202.25 B: am i getting my r._d._a. recommended allowance of che 

202.24 212.95 A: yeah that's the question the meat the cheese the diary gimme gimme gimme that's probably you know i i know better i'm aware of my own destruction but i i'm just getting over a mild bout of the flu myself right now 

206.57 207.43 B: (( i don't )) 

212.88 213.75 B: yeah 

213.02 219.27 A: but ah you know i think if i eat my pizzas and my uh you know you know my milkshakes and whatever [laughter] 

216.04 217.00 B: [laughter] 

218.65 222.15 B: yeah on the chicken that i'm currently washing as we speak 

221.45 229.69 A: oh very nice very nice of course nowadays when i get the flu people are like are you sure it's not sars so you know i got gotta whole lot of headaches going on 

222.64 224.40 B: yeah i think 

227.03 227.83 B: yes 

229.69 235.39 B: yeah that's really funny i i actually work with people that are in you know that travel extensively 

235.14 236.22 A: yeah 

235.98 241.75 B: so i've been in contact with a couple of people that may have been in asia at the inopportune moment 

241.08 242.05 A: (( ah )) 

241.77 244.12 B: you want to talk paranoia [laughter] 

243.44 245.88 A: ha ha well there's a cure i hear so 

245.91 251.23 A: i guess it's just quarantine you have to worry about or or recognizing the symptoms or whatever it is 

248.09 249.10 B: well there's no- 

250.60 256.70 B: working out the symptoms and quarantining yourself but think about people's natural re- reaction you 

256.65 271.24 A: yeah but wh- we we we should probably ah is there more to the topic we should be discussing i want to make sure that they don't ah review our file and say like what are these guys talking about [laughter] yeah i gotta believe they're ah just real quick what ah 

257.28 258.03 B: (( know )) 

258.04 259.37 B: they flake 

265.21 267.60 B: what a couple of mooks [laughter] 

270.04 274.53 B: i think they said something about um about the seasons' change as well yeah 

274.02 280.80 A: oh okay so pollen and things like that maybe i i tend to be a little affected by that i don't really have allergies that much but uh 

280.67 281.51 B: yeah 

280.82 287.82 A: you know i do ah i don't know you know especially like i just moved from california to here to new york ah where are you 

287.33 289.29 B: (( we're new yorkers yeah i'm new york as well )) 

288.90 290.81 A: okay so um 

289.51 292.07 B: (( probably you found about this on list or )) 

291.74 306.45 A: yeah yeah yeah i was i i'm from out here but i went to california for three years uh which you know i hated and anyway i came back and um the the kinda change of going from the climate to this climate it it was even i think that's why i have the flu plus a lack of sleep [laughter] 

302.67 304.02 B: oh yeah 

306.39 310.96 B: yeah well lack of sleep will do that when you start when you moved back to new york and you realized all the fun things you can do [laughter] 

310.76 320.93 A: yeah yeah oh yeah exactly plus plus the move itself you know you you're up all night packing boxes and you know and then i did the cross country trip so you know blah blah blah [laughter] 

316.99 318.63 B: yeah 

319.35 321.67 B: oh it's stress- it's stressful though hell 

321.37 325.02 A: yeah so i think probably the immune systems gets a little lowered and then 

325.07 334.94 A: with the change of weather this weather's been kinda inconsistent we have the nice weather the bad weather then we have a little rain and then we have like a a heatwave it it you know [laughter] like all in the 

333.71 334.93 B: yeah it's a big

347.20 348.40 B: but um 

349.76 352.85 A: vested interest in the subject around surrounding the subject 

352.99 354.70 B: what's that 

353.73 357.46 A: you have more of a vested interest in this uh random subject that we've been given then 

357.35 364.96 B: no not really i couldn't care less i'm jus- yeah that's just i'm just doing this for laughs basically it loo- it looked kind of interesting i was like ah you know free money why not well

401.66 411.67 A: i you know i don't know any more i mean there's just so many disorders that there seem to never used to be and uh you know i chalk it up to this toxic society and its many uh different ways 

407.23 408.84 B: yeah 

411.82 420.45 A: but uh it always gets you know always seems to get accepted just you know it's introduced by the media you know we got a western isle virus we got a seasonal disorder we got a this 

420.33 427.64 A: oh asthma's up you know what i mean i don't know meanwhile you know the world trade center went down we have like tons of asbestos swimming around and you know 

424.91 426.15 B: [laughter] 

426.64 428.43 B: [laughter] 

427.57 437.58 A: and asthma rates went up you know and then we got you know the western isle virus which like three old people died from and i don't know they're suddenly spraying just spraying these huge pesticides all over our cities because of this 

433.27 434.73 B: [laughter] 

436.74 437.92 B: (( yeah i know [laughter] )) 

437.68 447.49 A: you know like what are pesticides giving us i don't know you know like uh i just get very sceptical about all these things even alzheimers where was alzheimers thirty years ago there was no you know the there wasn't 

445.42 446.39 B: (( oh you know )) 

446.40 449.62 B: it comes out a lot in it comes a lot of it i think to um 

449.75 452.94 B: to winter causes we have good good economic times right now 

452.98 454.31 A: yeah we sure do 

454.36 463.61 B: so we're bus- too busy we're too you know whe- when you're really when things are rough you're too busy to worry about the fact that your allergies are bothering you and you're all sniffly today 

454.53 455.76 A: we sure do 

463.39 466.44 A: that's right that's right 

464.51 465.86 B: (( but uh you know )) 

466.03 469.53 B: give us a nice you know happy economy lots of time off 

469.45 479.12 A: [laughter] or just tell us just tell us we're the good guys and we're doing the right thing overseas and then we'll all go to bed at night [laughter] so that's a prescribed medication [laughter] 

469.87 471.13 B: suddenly we go 

475.22 477.57 B: [laughter] the right thing huh 

478.20 482.21 B: are we doing the right thing please tell me we are [laughter] oop wait 

480.31 487.15 A: [laughter] i don't don- donald rumsfeld says we are and you know what that guy looks like a saint to me [laughter] 

485.50 488.12 B: it's go- good enough for me man 

487.26 490.46 A: yeah he looks like grandpa to me mother's milk [laughter] 

489.97 495.81 B: if if the oil industry tells us that we're not going to war for oil who am i not to believe them 

495.11 509.65 A: yeah and especially with uh the bush family owning most of the oil hey who am i to question that but ah but on the topic of colds um you know i uh i wouldn't mind if bush got a severe flu [laughter] i don't know if tha- i don't know if that's in keeping with the topic 

498.87 500.98 B: [laughter] 

506.11 507.76 B: [laughter] there you go 

509.54 515.28 B: yeah i'm not sure exactly what they're trying to accomplish from this thing but look danny on illness let's stick with illness for a little while i like 

513.90 515.45 A: yeah yeah what what 

515.67 521.98 A: what was that quote they gave a quote and then they said do you agree with that and then i i didn't catch it what was it 

518.56 520.94 B: oh something about waiting seven days 

521.50 525.91 B: i think there was something about waiting seven days to see a doctor whether or not you agree 

525.30 526.20 A: oh 

526.26 533.59 A: ah you know what with the way doctors are these days if it's if it's not like something towards the homeopathic doctor variety i 

533.40 543.48 A: even if it is i i tend to wait anyway 'cause i feel like your body is designed to overcome these things or to at least try and i think in giving it the chance to try it actually becomes stronger 

543.36 556.28 A: um you know and if if you go for like a quick out or something that'll overcome your body's own defenses and will do it for you then the next time around you're gonna have to do that again or you know you're going to have to rebuild you know so i kind of agree with that you know 

543.43 545.04 B: yeah 

553.03 553.93 B: yeah 

554.40 555.45 B: (( there is )) 

556.38 562.37 B: there was one school of thought that says that a fever is your body's response to an infection 

563.14 564.58 B: so basically 

563.17 565.12 A: yeah that that makes sense to me 

565.01 567.54 B: yeah so if you get rid of the fever 

567.63 568.46 A: right 

567.69 572.34 B: it may take you actually longer to recover from the infection whatever it might be 

571.90 579.65 A: yeah because you're treating the symptoms not the source of the problem yeah i agree with that yeah you- you're body you're body's already designed to deal with these kind of things 

574.43 575.91 B: yeah exactly 

579.76 587.46 B: my personal favorite is when very educated people talk to me and they say oh i had a cold but the doctor gave me anti gave me antibiotics and now i'm fine 

579.98 580.83 A: um 

587.79 596.11 B: and you're going eh [laughter] excuse me 'cause let's have a little discussion about antivirals and antibiotics 

589.30 591.34 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

593.81 595.21 A: [laughter] 

595.63 597.07 A: right right 

597.10 599.96 B: you know somebody's got to go on a inhibitor for a
