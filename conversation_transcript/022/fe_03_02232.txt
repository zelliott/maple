0.76 3.27 A: hello my name's ann 

6.92 9.11 B: hello my name is rebecca 

9.15 10.64 A: hi rebecca [laughter] 

10.95 12.86 A: would you like to go first 

12.08 20.64 B: [laughter] um i've never done this before [laughter] i'm a little i'm not quite sure what to expect 

19.74 30.81 A: okay i did it once i've only done it once before but i'll go first if you want so basically we're just supposed talk about the topic which is um whether we like eating better in restaurant or home 

23.44 24.47 B: okay 

30.55 31.44 B: uh-huh 

30.82 36.91 A: and my answer to that would actually be i like each one better for different occasions 

37.04 38.40 B: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

37.21 50.08 A: so i prefer to eat at a restaurant when i want something that i can't make myself easily like something that's really elaborate or gourmet or special 

50.05 56.76 A: or when it's a special occasion but day-to-day i prefer home cooked food 

56.57 57.60 B: okay 

57.67 58.88 B: well um 

59.42 68.76 B: i i would have to say that most of the time i prefer eating in a restaurant because i just don't like to cook [laughter] um i'm not i'm 

65.64 66.73 A: [laughter] 

68.92 77.93 B: my husband really likes my cooking and that kind of encourages me to cook sometimes but i i consider it kind of being a necessary chore 

78.00 86.23 B: and so i definitely prefer for somebody else to do all the work [laughter] so i can do all the eating [laughter] 

83.52 84.61 A: okay 

85.38 87.42 A: (( that that's )) 

87.49 94.80 A: i like that sometimes too but i do really enjoy cooking but there are a lot of things i just don't have the patience to do or 

93.72 95.68 B: yeah 

94.93 103.69 A: you know i i'm not one of those people who enjoys the thrill of the chase of finding all the you know unique and exotic ingredients 

103.02 104.76 B: right [laughter] 

103.60 110.53 A: and who has the patience to you know make a sauce that takes five or six hours to 

110.45 119.32 A: go through my husband has actually done that before he'll make these sauces that you know go through three phrases and literally six or seven hours 

118.70 120.08 B: oh my god [laughter] 

119.85 128.21 A: and it's like i don't think they taste that much better than something i can make in twenty minutes so it's not worth the tradeoff 

128.14 141.82 A: to me but i certainly appreciate it when i go to a very fine restaurant and they have you know sous chefs [laughter] who can spend all day making a sauce for me that's certainly a good thing 

141.14 142.58 B: (( right )) 

142.59 147.90 A: so i think the other part of the topic was to describe a like your ideal meal 

148.38 157.25 B: okay um well definitely my ideal meal is cooked by someone else [laughter] and served to me by someone else [laughter] um 

153.25 154.60 A: okay 

157.48 161.52 B: well my favorite food is lobster and i don't get to eat it very often 

161.27 162.29 A: okay 

161.69 162.81 B: so um 

163.85 174.67 B: the last time my husband and i went out for his birthday i think was probably the best restaurant meal i've ever had um it we had two grilled lobster tails and it was 

172.98 174.07 A: yum 

174.95 180.45 B: the way they grilled it was just i'd never had it grilled before and it was just fantastic [laughter] 

179.81 182.99 A: yeah that's really good i like lobster prepared that way 

182.53 184.09 B: yeah um 

184.18 188.17 A: what kind of restaurant was it did they specialize in seafood or 

187.50 193.25 B: um it's actually a supper club that it's mostly steak and they only have lobster once a week 

192.79 193.85 A: (( ah )) 

193.41 199.05 B: um lobster's not really one of their specialties but it ought to be the way that they make it [laughter] 

198.37 200.67 A: it sounds really good i'm getting hungry 

200.50 202.50 B: [laughter] 

201.31 204.72 A: i had cereal for dinner [laughter] 

203.18 204.51 B: [laughter] 

205.59 216.39 A: i'm getting lazy because my husband isn't coming home for dinner tonight and ah my my daughter ah you know wanted scrambled eggs for dinner so 

209.98 210.88 B: ah 

216.69 218.50 B: it works [laughter] 

217.93 223.39 A: so at that point i decided i get the well i don't get the night off i have to work tonight but 

223.56 225.77 A: i get a few minutes off 

226.02 232.06 A: so my ideal meal would probably be i really like um really good french food 

231.93 233.19 B: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

232.51 234.13 A: so 

234.73 240.94 A: we tend like not to go out to eat very often but when we go out we'll go somewhere really nice 

240.97 245.27 A: we'll usually start with you know really good wine 

245.60 251.28 A: soup or a great salad like i love like really good cream french soups 

251.87 254.99 A: and then usually for the main course 

255.11 268.56 A: it just kind of depends on my mood like a lot of times i like to get like a really good steak with a really good like wine and mushroom sauce but really i love seafood i love chicken [laughter] 

268.67 274.74 A: duck is one of those things i don't think you should make at home because it's too hard and too messy so 

274.08 274.95 B: (( [laughter] ah huh )) 

274.92 276.84 A: that's one thing that i'll order out 

276.99 284.28 A: and then um to me dinner out is not dinner out unless you finish it with a really good dessert 

284.00 284.98 B: uh-huh 

284.59 287.07 A: because i love dessert 

287.50 288.84 A: and 

289.14 297.35 A: that that's probably my ideal meal i have to say probably the best meal i ever ever ate 

297.99 300.63 A: i ate in france 

300.74 310.04 A: at a restaurant for lunch of all things and it was like on the southern coast overlooking the ocean we're outside 

310.33 315.91 A: and just everything was perfect i mean the service was so good that when they served us 

315.95 326.79 A: a tart that i ordered for dessert like it was a tart with raspberries all piled up and he took it from the dessert part and he was putting it on the like from the tray onto a little dessert plate 

326.71 338.57 A: one or two of the raspberries like fell off the tart but they fell on the plate okay they didn't fall like on the floor and there must have been fifty raspberries on the thing i mean it was piled like seven inches high i swear 

338.22 339.83 B: [laughter] 

339.26 343.51 A: and he starts apologizing profusely because two of the raspberries fell off 

342.60 344.60 B: (( mhm mhm [laughter] )) 

343.97 346.18 A: i mean it was it was funny 

346.80 352.55 A: but it's like that attention to detail and service i love to be spoiled that way 

351.97 353.35 B: yeah 

352.73 359.62 A: but that i could that i could have every single day not to mention the fact that in a restaurant you don't have to clean 

359.78 363.07 B: right i think that's one of the biggest pluses [laughter] 

360.70 361.49 A: up 

362.73 366.30 A: i love to cook but i do not like to do the dishes 

367.34 370.33 B: i can't imagine anyone who does [laughter] but 

369.64 379.08 A: yeah yeah well i've met a few people who don't seem to mind and unfortunately i didn't manage to marry one of those 

377.61 379.06 B: [laughter] 

380.37 382.85 A: my husband likes to eat a lot 

382.58 383.81 B: mhm 

383.16 387.33 A: and he occasionally likes to cook although he's never ever home 

387.37 392.30 A: but when he does you know cook he makes oh 

392.31 394.59 A: horrible horrible messes 

395.08 400.81 A: and then his idea of cleaning up is not quite as clean as my idea of cleaning up 

400.89 407.14 B: i understand my husband is the same way he loves to cook but he can really make a mess when he does it [laughter] 

406.43 413.40 A: i swear well my dad is like that too he can use every pan in the kitchen to make something really simple 

413.76 415.97 B: right i think that's a man thing 

415.74 418.03 A: i think so 

417.66 421.15 B: i'm just i'm thankful to have a husband who enjoys cooking 

420.93 424.81 A: that i was going to say that's especially good if you don't like it 

424.51 425.52 B: right 

425.32 426.38 A: so my hu- 

426.37 432.98 A: husband really didn't know how til we got together but then like he'll get on something and he'll make it like a hundred times until he 

432.97 442.90 A: like perfects that one thing but he has a few specialties but he's not like a he doesn't cook a lot does your husband what kind of things does he like to cook 

434.57 435.48 B: uh-huh 

442.62 450.97 B: um well he doesn't cook anything really elaborate but the things that he cooks are just great he makes the best spaghetti sauce he makes it totally from scratch 

451.02 453.20 B: just like he was from italy or something 

453.02 454.98 A: oh that's great 

453.67 458.16 B: he grew up in oklahoma don't know where he got the skill but it was 

456.60 457.68 A: [laughter] 

458.19 461.56 B: it was he makes the greatest spaghetti sauce 

461.17 463.07 A: oh that's good 

461.62 462.51 B: (( and )) 

462.54 464.99 B: he makes a 

465.21 476.04 B: queso dip for chips that is just fantastic it's full of different vegetables and i think he he's never told me his secret to to how he makes it so good but 

475.83 481.30 B: i think it's got sau- and little bit of sausage in it which normally i don't like but it's really good in his queso 

480.93 482.68 A: (( mhm interesting )) 

481.54 486.93 B: and it's just full of vegetables and i think the touch that i like the most is cilantro 

487.00 490.24 B: i love that yeah 

487.01 488.70 A: oh i love cilantro 

489.38 492.53 A: do you ever put cilantro in like a green salad 

492.19 493.34 B: yes 

492.70 504.85 A: that's i love to do that a guy i used to work with used to bring a sal- like a salad at lunch he'd just use lettuce and a little like frozen corn that obviously would have thawed by the time it was lunchtime 

504.70 508.41 A: and a bunch of cilantro and then a can of tuna 

508.14 508.85 B: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

508.58 510.64 A: and then like vinaigrette dressing 

510.86 516.71 A: and it's so simple it tasted so amazing we started eating those for lunch like every day 

516.22 518.00 B: it sounds really good 

517.52 519.27 A: it's really really good 

518.57 530.14 B: i actually discovered cilantro when i was about twenty two years old but never heard of it before and i had two pet rabbits and i was on the internet on a on a support group for people who 

530.27 540.59 B: who want to care for rabbits and i heard that rabbits really like cilantro so i got my rabbit some and they just i mean they really out on it they loved it 

539.79 543.00 A: wow i never heard that i used to have a rabbit [laughter] 

542.43 544.95 B: it makes their breath smell so 

544.83 548.25 B: good most of my rabbits like to lick my nose 

548.02 549.06 A: oh 

548.10 560.69 B: and so they get up to lick my nose and they have the sweetest breath and one day i thought well i will just put some of this in a salad and see what it tastes like because it can't be i thought it was just parsley i didn't know anything about it 

558.76 559.87 A: right 

560.65 567.94 B: and but my rabbits loved it so much i thought i'd just give it a try and i just love it's got the most unusual flavor to it 

568.00 576.91 A: see i lived in southern california in my high school years and so because mexican food is so big here everybody uses cilantro in everything 

568.05 568.92 B: (( but i mhm )) 

577.11 589.24 A: you can't you can't escape it but let me ask you a really weird question did your rabbits used to grunt i have never heard that rabbits grunted and then my rabbit would always make these little [mn] noises 

583.51 585.28 B: (( mhm yeah yeah yes [laughter] )) 

588.58 590.45 B: yeah i had 

589.25 599.89 A: and i just wondered if he was unusual or if rabbits just happened to grunt because my mom had had ra- rabbits growing up and she didn't remember them ever grunting 

599.42 599.95 B: they
