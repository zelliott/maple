135.34 141.64 B: i'm not addicted to that but i'm more conscious of that now i i remember hearing a st- about a study that was done 

141.66 145.11 B: a couple of years ago about hand washing 

144.59 145.82 A: yeah 

145.17 151.54 B: and they confirmed that by washing your hands you reduce your chances of catching colds and other 

152.00 159.22 B: uh communicable diseases significantly so i started you know like for instance if i go out to eat 

153.76 155.02 A: yeah 

159.09 160.81 A: oh yeah definitely 

159.80 168.97 B: the first thing i do is wash my hands before i eat or at lunch you know before i have lunch when i'm at work i wash my hands 

169.19 174.07 B: so i'm and i'm more conscious of that i haven't always done that like when i would go out to eat 

174.56 178.27 B: it to me seems like a lot of people just go ahead and just start eating 

178.02 178.91 A: yeah 

178.81 181.87 B: but i always wash my hands 

181.34 182.28 A: (( yeah yeah i know )) 

182.39 184.92 B: and sometimes i use that um 

186.38 187.76 A: i use oh 

186.91 189.15 B: [lipsmack] hand sanitizer 

188.42 194.58 A: oh i use a anti-bacterial soap i even wash dishes with uh it's anti-bacterial

197.30 198.63 B: right 

198.07 199.05 A: yeah 

199.10 203.21 A: so i do that too and wash 'em in hot water so 

203.00 204.34 B: yeah 

203.74 206.78 A: yeah that kills pretty much all the germs 

206.86 212.07 B: yeah well that works too i mean that that works for me as well that's what i do 'cause 

212.16 213.96 B: but in terms of um 

214.57 217.58 B: of taking a lot of stuff now i have taken 

217.76 220.00 B: vitamin c. on occasion 

219.84 220.69 A: (( mm )) 

220.23 221.34 B: um 

221.74 231.39 B: because it's supposed to help keep your b- immune system strong and fight off colds and all that i have done that but i don't do it on a regu- regular basis 

225.37 226.19 A: yeah 

230.40 231.70 A: me either 

231.91 232.54 B: (( heh )) 

232.10 234.73 A: [laughter] 

233.85 236.03 B: i drink orange juice though 

235.62 241.21 A: i d- you know i drink juice with vitamin c. or calcium in it every 

236.67 237.86 B: a lot 

239.87 247.72 B: but the i don't do it just i drink orange juice becau- well for one thing 'cause i know i need the vitamin c. but primarily i drink it 

248.02 255.78 B: because i like it [laughter] not so much because it's healthy although it is healthy too 

250.18 252.04 A: yeah [laughter] 

255.21 256.12 A: yeah 

256.43 257.32 B: so 

258.09 259.24 B: that's kind of 

260.28 264.35 B: my my r- line of reasoning but um 

264.58 267.23 B: now what was the other question that they asked 

266.49 268.40 A: (( [sigh] yeah um )) 

269.44 273.22 A: i don't know [laughter] i don't know

280.46 284.12 A: yeah this is totally weird [laughter] 

282.75 291.00 B: yeah i i think so too and a- as a matter of fact i really kind of think that they could have come up with a better topic to discuss than this 

289.99 291.06 A: (( i know )) 

291.20 296.49 B: i think this is s- there's not the so much to say about it as far as i'm concerned
