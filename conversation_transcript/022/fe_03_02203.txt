378.72 379.81 A: mhm 

386.28 388.42 B: so it's it was kinda cool 

386.33 387.37 A: wow 

388.22 394.25 A: i thought it would be like not talking to humans at all 'cause my friend that just called referred me 

394.13 394.97 B: uh-huh 

394.47 397.20 A: that's funny 'cause she just called and um 

397.37 401.18 A: this is my first call from the robot so she sent me this email and she was like

418.10 428.99 B: so ah then anyway well so we've decided that restaurants are sometimes good and most times bad and cooking at home is most times good 

427.32 432.80 A: well you don't what what they're putting in your food at the restaurant i mean if you look at all the bad angles 

432.86 434.97 A: i mean i guess like also 

435.49 437.66 A: you know it could be dirty 

438.13 439.30 B: oh sure 

438.30 441.83 A: and then it and you have more control over fat content and stuff at home 

442.12 445.20 A: [noise] but i like the experience of the restaurant 

442.19 443.89 B: well and and 

445.31 452.34 B: yes exactly where where you know you can just kinda chill out and you know maybe have a glass of wine or something 

452.11 460.92 B: and just just let them take care of it um i i think i think all of it you really when you when you look at the total picture of health 

455.01 456.20 A: yeah 

460.76 467.18 B: um you know you need some of that time for yourself too you know to actually be served 

467.38 471.72 B: so you know i- it kinda counter balances things in your life you know 

469.92 471.82 A: mhm 

471.76 475.66 B: so fr- from that aspect you know ah when i think of health 

474.17 475.63 A: it's something to do 

477.10 478.21 B: go ahead i'm sorry 

477.93 480.03 A: no it just it's something to do 

480.11 488.58 B: yeah well sure absolutely absolutely ah you know um all work and no play you know you know that won't do 

480.26 481.09 A: too 

481.53 482.45 A: yeah 

488.42 489.94 A: yeah 

488.66 499.65 B: but um you know when i when i think of health i i really try to think of the whole picture not just the nutritional side but also you know what's good for me you know what's going to feed my spiritual side or my emotional side 

499.70 501.14 A: right 

499.93 504.91 B: (( or my physical side you know 'cause i have to get the proper exercise and things like that you know just )) 

503.46 504.56 A: mhm 

504.74 516.69 B: kinda the total picture and and part of that is just being able to not have to worry about it just go out and have some fun and chill out and you know have a glass of wine and enjoy the experience so 

516.19 517.30 A: mhm 

516.71 519.66 B: (( now i i totally concur with what you're trying to say )) 

519.56 521.50 A: yeah
