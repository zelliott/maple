94.02 103.31 B: i see well i'll take the home cooked ah meal what would would or would you rather have the rest- which would you rather have 

102.62 113.77 A: well you know i really enjoy eating at home i really limit my restaurant going to once or twice a week but they're really health considerations it's not that i don't like the food 

112.92 126.15 B: yeah now you see you and i are on the same wavelength here so we are not going to be able to debate the issue we are just going to be embellishing each other's situation yeah i i like you um found ah 

115.54 116.48 A: yeah 

119.20 121.33 A: [laughter] okay 

126.25 136.51 B: ah that that eating is an enjoyable pastime and then it is sort of an entertainment sort of thing but ah the main purpose of eating is nutrition 

136.21 137.42 A: yeah 

136.94 139.29 B: (( and if um )) 

139.89 148.90 B: you enjoy life and want to stay around here awhile then you've got to dwell on the fact that ah food isn't what it used to be 

148.32 151.15 A: yeah and one never knows what goes into it 

150.88 162.90 B: well yeah and there are so many things that ah fast cooked and ah you can't blame the restaurant owner he's out to make ah money and so um 

160.41 161.37 A: sure 

163.07 175.26 B: i doubt if there's many times when you go out that things are slow cooked except at perhaps in big cities like where you are where the restaurant ah prices can be exorbitantly high 

174.05 176.12 A: this is this is very true 

175.84 176.67 B: yeah 

176.05 189.10 A: but um but i have found in new york some wonderful restaurants that i enjoy going to with friends and in fact one of them is at n._y._u. new york university has a vegan meal once a month 

185.56 186.49 B: sure 

189.11 189.92 B: oh 

189.23 193.78 A: and it's in a different cafeteria each time it's a buffet 

193.72 194.70 B: yes 

194.28 202.06 A: and it's really really lovely there are no animal products of any sort things are a bit excessively salty 

202.17 206.80 A: but there are tons of salads and wonderful stir fries and 

206.57 217.93 A: even the desserts are are very natural things like tofu ice cream and things like that and it's only eight dollars it's a really wonderful meal so i look upon that 

212.18 213.54 B: oh wow 

217.78 227.93 A: as not only nourishing but a social occasion when i can gather my friends around me and we can sit for three hours and talk at leisure and eat all we want and it's great fun 

227.19 232.68 B: [laughter] i love that all all all you want and also um 

232.79 238.97 B: it i eat when i am with being a bachelor ah when i'm with people 

239.68 244.86 B: i have a tendency to eat even more slowly than i do at home as i watch television 

244.13 245.13 A: uh-huh 

245.19 247.92 B: so therefore ah 

247.99 252.41 B: ah i only cook one meal a day two meals a day i eat ah 

252.40 266.73 B: uncooked food so the third meal of the day i normally do in a microwave which is still deleterious because of the fact that ah the microwave has radiations that that change the molecular structure of the food so you're 

253.18 254.10 A: uh-huh 

266.73 281.67 B: plus the temperature gets over a hundred and eighteen degrees which again changes all the the nutritional value and the content of the food and particularly the enzymes but of course you know all that right 

281.09 288.22 A: well i would be curious to know what kind of cooking you actually do in the microwave because i too have a microwave but i never 

288.32 296.97 A: quote cook in it the only thing i ever do is like i'll make a baked potato or an ear of corn in the ah husk 

293.31 294.15 B: oh 

296.69 302.21 B: yeah well i even bake in ah with my microwave yeah yeah 

300.50 303.28 A: (( do you see i've never tried that )) 

302.73 311.07 B: yeah you don't you don't get a a high rising item y- you just get but something very solid and consistent so 

310.96 322.53 B: um if if you like chewing on things and ah you know it's it's a harder more firmer thing because you don't have the ah the rise in in the the dough but um 

320.10 321.07 A: yeah 

321.09 322.05 A: yeah 

322.58 327.04 B: the the thing i was getting to is during the course of a meal um 

326.81 341.22 B: i like my things hot and so ah there's three or four times i go back to th- the microwave to get another portion which i keep ah warm well if you're out at a restaurant when they serve the main entree 

337.20 338.17 A: uh-huh 

341.79 350.48 B: and you're gonna chat with somebody by the time you get to most of what's on yo- your plate ah the food is cool 

349.65 357.01 A: absolutely if you've ever eaten pizza in a restaurant you know how gummy the the cheese gets before you've had the last slice 

356.83 359.73 B: yeah i remember once i was in ah 

360.07 365.85 B: oh where was it new orleans area was it yes and ah 

365.79 380.71 B: they had a pizza we went for lunch at a pizza place and you only took your one little piece off the grill and they had every kind of pizza in the world there and it was a large sort of buffet and you just went up and chopped off a 

377.63 378.49 A: uh-huh 

380.73 387.54 B: whatever kind of pizza you wanted went back and sat down and and the pizza was kept warm on on a warming 

387.33 388.32 A: uh-huh 

387.60 389.98 B: grill so to speak 

389.15 401.46 A: yeah but see even in new york when they keep food warm like i've i've seen it um they will keep it warm under lights and i really wonder about the bacteria that must accumulate that way 

401.42 407.55 B: well what about your your um at n._y._u. and you had your buffet 

402.20 404.09 A: i don't it doesn't sound healthy 

407.51 408.48 A: yeah 

408.03 410.40 B: (( wha- what about the )) 

410.85 413.00 B: let's say the the um 

413.37 418.16 B: contamination there of hands and coughing and 

416.21 423.26 A: well th all this is true this is true and now with sars it's especially scary isn't it 

422.82 425.18 B: yes but 

423.31 425.18 A: i love chinese food 

425.66 439.97 B: yeah [laughter] yeah everybody does but the the thing no let me just ask go back to the the buffet do they have sort of a window coming across the food so that it's 

426.10 427.94 A: i adore chinese food 

428.39 430.49 A: oh i do i do i love it 

435.27 436.12 A: uh-huh 

438.91 449.55 A: well ye- yes they have the so called coughing cough screens or sneeze screens and then the things that are being prepared by the preparers are behind glass 

441.17 442.37 B: protection 

443.41 444.49 B: yes 

444.54 446.27 B: yeah 

449.38 454.02 A: you have no access to it you merely point at what you want and they put it together for you 

452.47 453.36 B: oh 

453.65 455.59 B: oh i see 

454.44 458.95 A: so it's fresh they do stirfries they do sandwiches 

457.79 459.47 B: oh 

459.02 466.14 A: and there are a few things that are already prepared like they do they do a mock chicken nugget kind of thing 

461.14 462.41 B: oh 

466.10 479.41 A: it's a a ah i guess it's gluten gluten nuggets which by the way are delicious 'cause i i only have like one or two or them just to taste but they're very good and the funny thing is you see the kids carrying their trays 

466.87 467.83 B: (( uh )) 

479.20 490.27 A: and they're eating the same crap though it's not as they would outside they're eating the mock hamburgers and the mock hotdogs and the french fries and the onion rings 

490.42 499.90 A: it's just so funny that they they they i guess they don't perceive that it's not the same thing but in their minds they treat it as if it were 

493.60 495.20 B: yeah 

499.59 512.63 B: mhm i was um waiting in a in a tailor shop today and th- there was a woman there with a child that was extremely developed for a two year old and i just said 

513.18 515.26 B: my goodness two year old and she's 

515.19 529.15 B: talking intelligently and very alert and so i said do you give her vitamins and the wo- the mother said no she won't take them and i said what do you mean and she said well she just spits them out and i said even the liquid she knows what it is and doesn't take it 

516.84 518.18 A: mhm 

528.50 529.64 A: mhm 

529.28 530.69 B: (( and um )) 

530.76 541.83 B: and i said well why don't you insist she take her vitamins or you don't feed her she said well she'll sit there for two hours and not eat anyway so she said that doesn't work and i 

538.31 539.05 A: (( oh )) 

541.00 541.95 A: yeah 

541.88 545.35 B: said well when i was very little um 

545.40 557.65 B: my mother got this betty crocker cookbook and there was a fandangled recipe in there and i noticed that as we were eating dinner that evening my father wasn't relishing it i could tell by the expression on his face 

557.54 567.88 B: so i decided to mimic my father but i mimicked him so so much i got myself so upset that i had to excuse myself from the table and ah 

567.99 569.45 B: go and throw up 

569.11 570.09 A: oh 

569.87 584.38 B: and because i had put myself into such a tantrum don't you see about disliking the food and my parents were very helpful when i came back to the table there indeed was a clean plate with a fresh helping 

573.39 574.30 A: yeah 

583.98 585.09 A: mhm 

584.65 591.19 B: and i was told the to either finish the dinner ah 

591.21 599.89 B: or you would go to bed and miss dessert so um from then on i never ever disliked 

594.31 595.31 A: mhm
