190.98 200.85 A: i don't think i could because of mm i'm getting allergies now i don't think i could live in florida because those are my all- i just don't think i could do it 

197.13 198.48 B: yeah [laughter] 

199.85 203.82 B: it's real damp there's a lot of mold growth around here 

201.27 202.53 A: yeah 

203.16 204.61 A: oh i would think 

204.42 209.19 B: so a lot of it just depends on that you know 'cause that's what i found like we we're military 

208.93 210.03 A: okay 

209.38 219.32 B: and we just moved on base and the town that we're in is really i mean the water's just like across the highway from us which the highway is right in front of the base 

211.33 212.30 A: okay 

218.95 220.05 A: okay 

219.65 222.97 B: so half of the base residents live right on the water 

222.64 223.68 A: okay 

223.40 226.29 B: and um yeah we moved on base here 

226.31 230.37 B: and we left stuff outside when we were first moving in 

229.65 230.78 A: okay 

230.39 233.47 B: and things just started molding within days 

233.01 234.29 A: oh no 

233.66 243.12 B: it's that horrible i just couldn't believe it and i've had uh since we've moved here i've went and bought things like that damp rid and stuff to put in the bathrooms and 

241.04 242.03 A: yes 

242.27 243.38 A: yes 

242.92 251.05 B: cracked the windows a little bit and run the fans longer there's so much that you have to do with allergies ever since just with my son 

244.58 245.71 A: yes 

251.28 257.74 B: um because see he he he can't have milk [sigh] soy eggs beef 

251.85 252.58 A: oh 

257.69 259.78 A: oh wow 

258.92 262.49 B: peas or spinach and he can't be around cats 

262.19 263.36 A: okay 

263.11 266.94 B: [laughter] he's terrible the poor little thing he it's horrible for him 

267.17 272.69 A: you said you had twins and does the other one have these allergies oh wow 

268.27 269.49 B: mhm 

270.01 275.02 B: no nothing [laughter] she's just fine and dandy 

272.87 274.31 A: yeah 

274.86 280.42 A: i used to take everything so for granted because i never had any any health problems 

279.29 282.90 B: yeah until you get something like an allergy you don't realize it 

282.75 290.15 A: and i never realised how serious they could be until i had to go to the emergency room 'cause i couldn't breathe 

285.71 286.74 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

290.71 295.95 A: and just because of allergies and i 'cause i like i said i took my health very very much for granted 

296.23 297.97 A: until i [sigh] 

298.00 305.12 A: and it sounds i always thought people were like exaggerating or just you know being a baby with allergies 

304.60 315.77 B: yeah you don't realize it until 'cause like i've never had any problems you know like that and then after my son had all these problems then you start looking around once you have it then you start seeing stuff you know 

308.34 310.20 A: yeah yeah 

315.23 316.25 A: yes 

315.76 322.25 B: you start reading you see more articles because you're like well this kind of pertains to me and you start paying a little bit more attention 

322.53 327.66 B: and that's just like and babies they just had a article in um parent's magazine 

322.68 324.15 A: exactly 

327.19 328.28 A: okay 

327.75 339.22 B: for like may about how more children are getting allergies and they don't know why but they are and they start showing up around five months or so and that's about the time he started getting his really bad 

332.35 334.11 A: wow wow 

336.06 337.14 A: okay 

338.74 339.95 A: okay 

339.54 344.89 B: and i have a a cousin that lives in kansas and her son is just right around five months old 

344.26 345.26 A: yes 

344.96 349.47 B: and she was telling me all these problems he was having like really gassy and 

349.20 350.37 A: yeah 

349.55 356.92 B: spitting up a lot and stuff and i'm you know and then i'm like well is he getting any rashes 'cause that's how his first started was rash 

356.87 357.81 A: okay 

357.45 371.32 B: um like and that the doctors the biggest thing oh my gosh with him i- i had to go round and round for like seven or eight months to get him into an allergist because they don't want to listen to you they think you don't know anything 

365.32 366.35 A: okay 

367.51 368.26 A: right 

369.16 370.15 A: oh no 

370.91 372.29 A: right 

371.62 381.99 B: and you know it's like i go through and i crawl for cross reference i go to the library and get books i read the books i have i go online and pull up all the information i can 

376.04 376.96 A: good 

379.71 380.77 A: good 

381.67 382.73 A: good 

382.15 395.21 B: and when when symptoms start seeming the same as what you have as to what you're reading in all this stuff you know well then you're like you know well something's not right and the doctors are like well you know you don't have a medical degree so you don't know anything 

390.74 392.08 A: exactly 

394.93 396.31 A: oh i hate that 

395.64 402.57 B: i kn- [laughter] i know me too that's how it was with me getting him into an allergist but at the time i was seeing a doctor off base 

402.42 403.37 A: okay 

402.64 408.60 B: but once i took him to the doctor on base well he was just like yeah you know this child needs to go in 

408.67 415.19 B: and um my doctor off base was like oh no he just has baby eczema and he just needs to go to a dermatologist 

412.92 414.15 A: (( oh )) 

415.14 416.55 A: wow 

415.92 419.73 B: so i went for a while to the dermatologist and then ah [noise] 

420.17 421.82 B: [lipsmack] got him in um 

421.71 425.39 B: put i- went ahead and switched him over and got him seen on base 

425.26 439.92 B: and the first thing that the doctor on base did he was like well let's take a scrape of this and see if it might be something fungal that can be cleared up and he took a scrape which neither my pediatrician nor the dermatologist which you would think a dermatologist would do a scrape 

427.63 428.67 A: yeah 

433.16 434.31 A: good 

438.84 439.83 A: yes 

439.75 445.65 B: and i w- that just well i was like wow you know he really impressed me so we switched our whole family over to the same doctor 

445.83 455.67 B: and um that's on base you know and he got him referred off 'cause i had to go through and get a referral to get him to see a specialist like that and um sure enough you know they did it and 

451.96 452.81 A: right 

456.01 456.57 A: (( [cough] )) 

456.05 465.54 B: it's it's harder a lot of times people say in infants because the tests don't come out accurate when they do the skin test and everything which they did that to him but 

463.18 464.31 A: (( oh okay )) 

464.87 465.54 A: (( uh )) 

465.60 466.99 B: my um 

467.55 470.33 B: allergist is a pediatric allergist also 

470.03 471.49 A: interesting okay 

470.67 480.48 B: and they they go through two um food allergies and things and do what they call a blind challenge in which they make 'em eat the stuff but they don't tell you whether they're getting the 

473.48 474.73 A: yeah 

476.01 477.07 A: okay 

480.53 490.53 B: allergen or the non-allergen and you just wait and notice and see if there's a breakout which he was allergic to all his things so all his were definite sure fire allergies 

482.53 483.52 A: okay 

485.40 486.34 A: okay 

490.50 491.94 A: oh wow 

490.99 494.00 B: it's crazy and if something makes you throw up you know 

493.59 494.71 A: yeah 

494.08 501.64 B: pay attention to it because that that could be like a food thing too 'cause that's one of his symptoms on beef and spinach 

497.67 498.99 A: okay 

501.86 506.21 B: they make him throw up that's how i found out about those and then the doctor tested him too 

505.95 507.47 A: really 

506.66 515.12 B: it's crazy i've learned so much within this past year about allergies that i had no idea about which you're probably doing all the same things too 

514.66 516.65 A: oh yeah 

515.59 528.24 B: it [mn] stuff you know you just get into this and then you have to start looking and you keep looking and there's so many people out there that can help you and give you information and you know just reading their stories and see what they went through 

527.79 533.58 A: yes but it drives me crazy because not every doctor will listen to you 

533.13 535.17 B: yeah that that's what well my 

535.13 549.76 B: i kind of got off the subject a minute ago with my cousin you know i told her i'm like you know all of his stuff sounds just like j._j.'s you need to take him in and tell 'em that you want to see about going to an allergist because you think he has a either a milk intolerance or an allergy or something 

537.88 538.81 A: yeah 

542.18 543.33 A: wow 

550.14 553.28 B: and finally she's got him going in next month 

553.49 561.74 B: but it's like same thing you know they didn't want to listen to her and she's she's a lot younger than me so she really had problems you know she's just like early twenties 

553.63 554.48 A: good 

558.04 558.93 A: okay 

561.52 562.52 A: yes 

562.13 564.26 B: and i'm like in my thirties 

563.85 564.88 A: okay 

564.53 573.47 B: so and it's like poor i told her i'm like you know don't give up you just keep on keep on and push until you make those doctors let you go to the allergist 

573.05 574.29 A: yeah 

573.65 576.32 B: so thank goodness she's got him going in so 

576.39 580.99 B: he shouldn't have to suffer like my son did my son went covered in 

581.48 584.56 B: rash practically from head to toe 

582.26 583.38 A: oh no 

583.90 585.16 A: oh no 

584.81 587.40 B: from november until like april 

587.40 587.96 A: (( [cough] )) 

588.10 589.31 A: oh no 

588.94 595.53 B: yeah it's crazy you know and they're just like oh no it's baby eczema you just need to change his laundry soap and change his bath soap 

590.80 591.91 A: you must have been 

593.62 594.52 A: [cough] 

596.10 598.70 A: oh no he must have been miserable 

598.33 599.89 B: he was he he still 

599.48 599.89 A: (( [cough] ))
