148.67 155.94 B: well that's the deal you have to honest to goodness you have to actually chip it off and they don't get that part of it 

156.04 156.90 A: right 

156.21 160.88 B: you know they don't get the part that the eggs and the the 

161.04 168.72 B: oatmeal and like my sinks i i we have stainless steels sinks and i wish to go- 

168.80 171.70 B: to goodness we hadn't never 

172.28 173.50 B: done that 

173.08 175.40 A: oh really you don't like yours 

175.45 183.28 B: no because they show every little piece of oatmeal this man this man loves oatmeal every morning 

183.80 184.75 A: [laughter] 

184.11 189.88 B: and but then when he you know he quote unquote cleans his bowl 

189.72 190.58 A: (( uh-huh right )) 

190.67 193.82 B: it's all in my stainless steel sink 

193.53 194.51 A: right 

194.88 199.75 B: and i don't know it sounds like you've seen those oatmeal traces

203.73 205.03 A: right right 

205.23 212.09 B: so you know it's kind of like all you have to do is put on your glasses we've got this little sprayer thing 

211.86 212.76 A: uh-huh 

212.75 216.42 B: why don't you use it and spray that little oatmeal off 

216.55 217.81 A: [laughter] 

217.84 223.60 B: but but the problem is we are so old he doesn't see his little remnants 

223.74 224.98 A: oh 

225.69 232.95 B: so when you know when i go into the kitchen and i see his little remnants then that makes me a little angry 

232.55 242.97 A: right right so what's your um what's your idea of a perfect meal what kind of what do you like to cook or what do you like to have out at a restaurant when when you go out to somewhere nice 

242.92 250.33 B: um perfect meal whether cooked or in a restaurant is the steak done just the way i like it 

250.04 250.88 A: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

250.90 256.61 B: plus seafood whether it be shrimp or or um lobster

287.40 294.28 A: of oh i was going to say cheesecake is my favorite [laughter] i love cheesecake especially if it's got any kind of chocolate 

294.59 295.51 A: chocolate 

294.73 308.34 B: oh me too and berries but you know what i found one of the odd things i've found being from a cheesecake family is i have found that um can we mention 

308.90 310.57 B: restaurant names 

310.44 313.62 A: oh i imagine so they're doing this is for a um 

313.74 316.97 A: voice recognition software type ah 

316.96 317.90 B: oh 

317.62 321.67 A: voice recognition system it's not like a marketing thing i think a college is 

321.05 322.80 B: oh good okay 

322.50 327.95 A: i haven't seen anything where they care i think they're just trying to get different dialects from different parts of the country 

327.31 332.11 B: uh oh well they're going to be fooled by me because i i 

330.52 331.37 A: yeah 

332.15 334.79 B: was born and raised in the midwest 

334.31 335.11 A: uh-huh 

335.86 343.12 B: spent most of my adult life in southern california and now live in denver for the last five years 

342.44 345.79 A: [laughter] so well that's good because 

345.09 347.33 B: so good luck to them huh 

347.04 358.37 A: that's probably really what's going on with most people they're you know they're born in some place around here and then they ah move somewhere else and they're their dialect changes 

358.46 360.96 A: they've got to have great things that 

361.23 362.06 A: um 

362.09 364.71 A: that can recognize people's voices and what's actual 

365.25 367.86 A: what they're saying you know the different accents 

367.88 371.25 A: i'm trying to say [laughter] but um 

371.27 380.74 A: i think my ah my dinner is actually very similar to yours it's funny when i was when i was in high school i i was a vegetarian 'cause my sister was a vegetarian and she 

379.95 381.65 B: were you really 

380.96 385.91 A: cooked she cooked so we just we ate lots and lots of stir fries 

386.23 388.36 B: (( oh i do a lot of stir fries )) 

387.84 391.70 A: so um we were and now um 

392.04 397.63 A: you know i ate a lot more vegetables and then i got married and my husband is a bit meat eater and so i 

398.44 406.26 A: i'd compromise and we we'd eat lots of chicken and turkey and things like and when we went out he'd get steak and um 

406.51 420.32 A: just like in the last couple of years i don't know if was from having babies or what and needing extra protein but i really i started eating beef and so he makes us he's like experimenting to how to marinate steak and he's been coming up with some really 

420.38 429.92 A: using whiskey and all sorts of stuff and it's been really really good and i've been doing a little bit of a more low carb diet so i've been trying to eat more protein 

430.14 431.64 B: see the carbs 

430.44 437.27 A: my blood sugar level keep my blood sugar level right and um so eating more meat is healthy so 

437.41 439.31 B: well that's good 

438.75 449.45 A: so steak i've been becoming very fond of steak i used to just go out and get if we went out to dinner it would be pasta and fish and you know fish and chips or 

450.02 456.50 A: chicken or shrimp or things like that now it's like okay i'll try steak [laughter] 

451.97 452.73 B: right 

455.77 457.29 B: well as i like 

457.62 468.01 B: ah ah several restaurants major restaurant chains are now doing the um steak salad you know or the chicken salad 

467.77 474.04 A: oh yeah you know i had one at mcdonald's the other day their new chicken salads are really good 

473.64 481.57 B: they are very good the only thing the only thing that upsets me about this they don't have blue cheese dressing and i'm 

475.54 476.33 A: (( i know )) 

480.57 484.15 A: oh no no no with the newman's dressing oh sorry 

482.20 483.14 B: yeah 

484.22 486.28 B: i'm a blue cheese person 

485.96 486.98 A: [laughter] 

487.22 496.00 A: oh i i love blue cheese too but ranch is my favorite i looked in i think i might if i get mcdonalds i might have to use no dressing or bring my own 'cause it's 

487.30 488.70 B: (( so i )) 

495.82 496.73 B: (( no )) 

497.47 500.14 B: they have newman's own ranch 

499.92 507.07 A: yeah now i looked at the i've only had one of the salads and but i looked at the at the um package 

507.09 508.12 B: uh-huh 

507.64 514.45 A: it had like five hundred calories or something just in that one package of ranch [laughter] 

513.17 518.44 B: well that's the newman's own though because he does he doesn't do anything light 

518.59 519.43 B: (( you know )) 

519.53 524.01 B: everything that is newman's is full flavor 

523.48 525.96 A: right right i love his 

524.33 526.45 B: so he doesn't do 

525.99 526.72 A: (( sauces )) 

526.83 528.92 A: marinara sauce and stuff though 

528.83 529.78 B: right 

530.91 541.59 B: so he doesn't have the light kind of stuff it's all full flavor which is great but you know what i've done here is i have taken 

541.57 548.34 B: his dressing and all that and actually watered it down by like a third 

548.10 549.31 A: with what 

549.44 559.36 B: um just water just straight just straight water and if you shake it up just make sure you shake it up enough like the dressing 

550.93 552.59 A: oh really 

559.77 565.59 B: um it does cut calories i i can't tell you how much it does 

565.31 566.64 A: right but right 

565.96 571.24 B: but it does i mean adding a third water is going to cut 

571.54 580.42 B: the the fat content and if you're like me you watch fat contents and you know that that's important 

581.14 590.56 A: yeah i've been trying to eat a lot more salad lately and adding spinach and stuff and i been um the and my husband's really picky too about um 

581.62 582.34 B: so 

590.83 599.96 A: salad dressing and that sort of thing and we found i think it's kraft it's light done right that it's been like the closest it's not nonfat but 

596.94 598.15 B: yeah
