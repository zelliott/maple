0.00 1.64 A: hi my name is andrew 

1.54 3.00 B: hi i'm garrett 

3.58 7.16 A: hi garrett um okay i guess i'll get started 

6.54 7.45 B: go for it 

7.10 20.64 A: um i have ah seasonal allergies so i get i would say yes that when the seasons change it does affect my health in some ways ah i don't have bad seasonal allergies thankfully but i do have 

20.55 24.59 A: some allergies um usually like you know ah 

24.87 35.61 A: once spring kinda gets going um sometime like round march maybe and it usually only lasts for a few days but ah i do get affected and i know ah 

35.56 40.09 A: other people who have you know allergies of greater severity so 

40.68 45.57 B: i know people with the same situation i actually am not in that situation believe it or not um 

45.54 57.32 B: i don't really feel the change of seasons more than just ah enjoying them [laughter] i don't ah get affected by pollen and things like that in the air but i do a lot of people do there's a lot of allergies that relate to the change of seasons 

57.18 63.89 A: yeah ah and i've actually never really lived in areas where the change of seasons is 

63.87 77.40 A: very pronounced i grew up in texas and so you really pretty much have hot and not as hot and in here i live now in tennessee where i go to university ah in knoxville 

71.12 72.65 B: [laughter] 

77.37 84.17 A: and ah there's a little bit more ah pronunciation of seasons we have a distinct summer 

84.03 90.16 A: a distinct winter and then there's a there's a fall that falls somewhere in there and then there's a spring 

90.00 101.91 A: so we we have ah you know seasons much more than in texas but still it's not anywhere like i would guess maybe the more northern kinda states in the united states where 

100.91 102.19 B: i'd agree with you 

101.94 103.47 A: yeah i mean 

102.65 106.34 B: i i grew i actually grew up in texas as well actually 

105.78 107.11 A: (( oh okay [cough] )) 

106.31 117.52 B: um in austin and you definitely w- it definitely felt the summers i i completely agree with you on that [laughter] and i'm actually in new york now and there is a more 

112.60 114.24 A: yes yeah 

117.40 122.78 B: there is a major shift between the season i think um 

122.62 128.35 B: the we just came out of winter really and even we're in spring having little touches of winter but when it's winter here it is 

128.19 138.72 B: very very cold and i hear some areas are very hot i haven't experienced one yet but [sigh] i do know there's a major change and and there are people a lot of people take allergy shots do you take allergy shots for the change of seasons to help you or 

138.24 151.10 A: no i've never i've never r- ah never been diagnosed with allergies severe enough that i took allergy sot- shots i had a friend growing up in texas who did take allergy shots and i'm not exactly sure what allergens 

151.01 156.49 A: affected that person but he took allergy shots ah so 

156.83 167.85 A: ah there's that and then you know too a lot of t- ah i've i've seen things recently where they say that some of the allergy problems people have are associated also with 

167.72 173.67 A: like smog and things that they can experience in cities so ah have you ever noticed 

173.78 184.66 A: um you say yourself you don't have allergy problems but people you know there in new york do they complain of allergies maybe more than you knew when you lived in texas 

184.16 193.11 B: um well ah i think it's really just a change of environment but i think i see it lot in a difference different ways um i've seen people who seen people who grew up here 

193.11 198.80 B: they have sort of a i i i don't know what it's called you know environmental allergies you know you grow up and you sort of 

197.10 198.04 A: mhm 

198.77 209.32 B: when the season changes your your body decides that now this is going to be the time when you're allergic to certain things [laughter] and [sigh] i think your body feels that and in texas i saw the same thing i mean is it it's so amazing the difference between 

209.31 223.40 B: [sigh] because we don't have any of the things here in new york that i really saw in texas in that sort of a way and the environment's so different but i do see people you know every i i i think you can actually develop you know allergies to the region actually based on you know the seasons as well 

213.76 214.80 A: right 

222.70 224.17 A: right 

223.91 234.25 B: [noise] [noise] is that is that something do you know you live in [noise] tennessee now do you experience a lot of ch- is there a lot of differences in their allergies from there to texas did you say you did or you did not or what is that [noise] 

233.66 235.25 A: um well 

235.43 241.90 A: i i i would have to say that i've noticed at times when the when the pollen is prevalent here 

241.81 256.80 A: it feels more ah my allergies are more quickly and more severely affected probably than when i lived in texas and it's interesting i i lived like around i also lived [noise] around austin part of the time [noise] when i lived in texas and i lived round san antonio 

256.82 270.34 A: and i'm going [noise] to be finishing up here at u._t. and i'm going to be going to lubbock going to be moving to lubbock to go to texas state law school and that will be an interesting part of texas to be in because 

270.32 282.96 A: there it's higher up so ah the allergens probably won't be as bad and it's a lot drier so i'm interested in [noise] seeing [noise] what kind of effect that will have on my allergies hopefully 

283.02 291.28 A: it will mean i won't have any allergy problems or you know just bear a few allergy problems but ah i'll just have to wait and see really 

285.40 286.13 B: (( mm )) 

290.45 295.81 B: when you do experience your greatest sort of ah allergies when when do those really come out most mhm mhm 

295.11 303.20 A: yeah it it's kind of like around the end of february beginning of march and then ah ah 

303.92 311.57 A: sometimes in the summer like i would guess maybe around july and then sometimes like in the middle of the fall 

311.41 317.55 A: and see i take a i have a prescription for ah allegra you know an allergy medication 

317.37 332.18 A: that i can take once daily but except during those severe times i don't end up doing doing that like for like i would say the last three weeks i've probably taken my allegra once every three days or something like that just 

331.02 340.69 B: [sigh] yeah i i do think though a lot of time when the spring changes and things are starting to come out because you know in the winter so many things aren't alive and mold's not high and all 

337.62 338.69 A: mhm 

339.55 348.18 A: and i guess what i was saying about the allegra ties in with the other part of their automated question there about i think they the question was ah 

348.30 356.36 A: referred to the statement i've never heard this statement that that ah you go to a doctor oh do do you remember exactly what it was 

350.71 351.88 B: neither have i it 

355.76 362.58 B: was something like do you go to a doctor seven days before a change in season you know and sort of i as something like that they 

360.25 365.81 A: or something i yeah i think it was just referring to the fact that that sometimes people 

365.96 368.06 A: just ah they don't 

367.21 372.05 B: don't know they're getting a change of season and they decide to make it a a a do you you don't do anything like that 

368.69 370.00 A: right 

371.59 384.48 A: no i mean ah the only thing i mean i go to a doctor for related to allergies is just to get a refill on my prescription of allegra really and ah and i'm never even really gone 

378.94 379.79 B: right 

384.52 387.19 A: in you know they have a whole test where they 

387.11 400.86 A: they can ah they have needles you know and they they have this whole tray of needles where they they stick you with different kind of allergens and they see how you react and ah ah 

395.92 396.88 B: oh really 

401.01 406.95 A: and then that kind of they then determine what kind of shot regimen i guess to put you on for that 

406.17 410.77 B: oh i've never heard that before but that's ah that in in in you've done that before huh 

410.15 416.97 A: no i've never done that before my friend i said that had the allergies ah that had allergens i remember [cough] 

416.99 430.61 A: i went with um because i stayed with his mom ah after school i remember one time we went to the doctor and i don't know ah for some reason i went back with them to the actual doctor's area and they had this little thing and it had just a whole bunch of needles on it 

430.47 437.64 A: and i was like what is that for and he's like well that they use that to test me for the allergies i was like whoa i don't what that and that 

436.12 448.62 B: [laughter] well that actually might be a really good thing for someone to figure out i've never i i i just see people come and they're doing the same thing and it might be a good way to figure out you know what you are allergic to and so then you know when the change of season comes it actually might help you in the process of figuring out [sigh] 

439.44 440.31 A: right 

448.44 453.73 B: you know what do you need to start really getting more of a medication that you might stop one during the break you know and 

453.13 467.08 A: right and actually ah i the lady i work for my boss she has a lot of allergies and not all of them are necessarily sea necessarily seasonally related she has ah a lot of food allergies too 

466.89 481.35 A: and so she went through that whole diagnostic test that they offer and found out all the different kinds of of allergens she has she's got like you know she's allergic to um cheese and things and and she's got some um 

481.77 489.10 A: kind of pollen ragweed allergies that she's mentioned before but she has a whole host of allergies i mean it's it's 

489.19 490.56 A: [laughter] pretty bad 

489.48 500.81 B: it's it's a lot [laughter] well in in in and it really is i i think that a lot of um i think a lot of allergies do happen ah i think the winter actually is probably the calmest time of the year for for a lot of people actually 

490.62 492.52 A: yeah a lot 

500.00 501.53 A: yeah 

500.93 511.83 B: ah allergy wise i think really summer is probably the worst for everybody i think summer's the most challenging for anybody i really think that's when every i don't know i just i i think think that seems to be when i see a lot of people 

511.77 520.92 B: you know sniffling a lot and having a lot more of effects of it even though winter's as a huge time of year you imagine people getting cold and such i i think this is when you really you know 

518.89 520.04 A: (( right [noise] )) 

521.36 531.17 B: i don't know i think i think of summer really as when i see a lot of people get sick and take breaks and things like that and they're always talking about their sinuses and i think sinuses are have a relation to your allergies and everything like that as well obviously 

530.48 537.39 A: yes i i'm and i'm sitting here and i'm i i have the t._v. muted and i'm just kind of looking at the pictures as as i talk with you 

537.48 547.95 A: and ah they had just had a commercial for clarinex which is one of those big ah allergy drugs and ah ah you almo- it's ah 

540.56 541.47 B: mhm 

548.84 558.17 A: it's interesting just how many medications they have out there nowadays to treat [cough] excuse me all kinds of allergies that you can have 

558.24 559.61 A: (( and ah )) 

560.22 565.26 A: i just kind of wonder how in the past ah before they had all these 

565.19 576.58 A: drugs i mean maybe like they like you know they quoted some of these old sayings on the automated message before the conversation started um i wonder if if people just kind of 

576.70 583.84 A: well what kind of folk remedies or or just what whatever kind of remedies people had when they had severe allergies back then 

580.53 581.30 B: yeah 

583.66 591.68 B: yeah i was actually ah i was actually wondering if there was anything that you knew of other than just general allergy medicines that you knew of you take allegra you said but do you 

591.81 599.89 B: is there anything that you can do during the change of season that actually helps you to sort of get into it better and you don't feel the effects of the the allergies as much as
