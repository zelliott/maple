0.82 2.59 A: (( hello hi )) 

0.93 1.97 B: (( hello )) 

2.67 4.08 B: hi i'm david 

3.66 5.40 A: david my name's lane 

5.54 6.93 B: (( hi nice to meet you )) 

6.37 7.55 A: you too 

7.89 11.09 A: so the first question 

11.60 12.78 A: um 

12.89 15.06 A: can you recall [laughter] 

14.42 17.95 B: [laughter] um i think it was ah do 

18.00 24.40 B: you agree with the fact that people get ill when the seasons change i think that was what it started with 

23.98 25.23 A: oh right right 

25.36 27.70 A: so do you agree with that 

27.79 29.07 B: um 

29.83 39.09 B: i don't think i i agree with that one hundred percent but i think that a lot of people do get sick when it's when the seasons change because their bodies are reacting to different weather 

35.41 36.77 A: mhm 

39.65 41.97 B: but i don't think it happens to everybody 

41.77 42.65 A: right 

42.83 45.64 A: i agree too i um [sigh] 

46.21 54.81 A: have been around a lot of people lately that have been [sigh] feeling very lethargic and very down and i think it has a lot to do with 

54.69 68.03 A: with the weather actually 'cause um with all that we've been through this this season with the cold and the rain and now it's getting warm and everything that your body is just constantly trying to like find balance in 

68.04 79.87 A: ah i think that your body is you know trying to find that balance and that and people react different ways to it um i myself it it's hard when it starts getting 

68.24 69.35 B: right 

79.85 88.87 A: um sunny and warm outside 'cause i love it but in the same hand it it exhausts me because my body's just not used to that that energy 

89.00 97.87 A: you know that um the and the warmth and just being in that um after a while you know it's great because then you're used to it but um 

97.99 110.14 B: exactly yeah yeah i think someone once told me that uh your body has a lot to deal with uh like the ah the barometric pressure and stuff so if it's raining a lot like it tends to cause more depression 

98.78 100.28 A: yeah 

109.80 110.84 A: mhm 

110.16 121.67 B: and if it's not when it's not raining the pressure's higher so then it causes you to be ah at a higher emotional plateau or whatever um 

120.14 121.15 A: mhm 

122.04 133.62 B: but i found that interesting 'cause it it is kind of true you get more depressed and kind of ah i mean just today it was sunny and now it's it's raining where i am so ah i ah 

133.78 140.33 B: (( i was like happy before i was going to go out and now it's raining so [laughter] [laughter] um )) 

136.53 138.25 A: yeah 

139.53 149.44 A: definitely understand that and it it's definitely it affects your mood at least my mood too because you know it was sunny this morning and then it got cloud i was like oh man but 

149.59 155.43 A: and then it got sunny again so it was like oh great now it's sunny and it's just like constantly ah da da da 

155.56 156.63 A: um 

156.97 159.83 A: but okay so also 

159.93 168.15 A: i guess does your what was it like do you have aller- allergies or like is your body influenced by 

168.42 169.38 A: um 

168.46 169.44 B: yeah d- 

169.26 176.41 B: definitely w- in the spr- i get ah allergies to a lot of times to the pollen although i haven't really had it that much this year so far knock on wood 

176.11 177.12 A: mhm 

176.17 188.22 B: but [laughter] um you know i yeah it d- it definitely affects me when the pollen and stuff is flying around in the air i think it usually happens in may though um it makes me real sniffly and sneezy and stuff 

187.77 189.00 A: mhm 

189.95 197.09 A: yeah i um i've never been diagnosed with anything but um just the change in temperature affects 

197.32 200.81 A: um like my head and just um 

200.87 207.58 A: like i i do i get sniffly too and but there's noth- i've never you know my mom always thought she'd go get like 

207.72 208.64 A: um 

208.77 221.69 A: just checked out and stuff to see if i was you know prone to whatever but i never did so i [mn] i don't think it's that severe that you know obviously it's not so severe so i don't really 

221.61 231.88 B: yeah i've never i've never actually gone and had it checked out actually my dad has the exact same thing so ah yeah well i i never i never used to have that but then maybe 

221.86 223.03 A: do anything 

226.58 227.81 A: oh really 

231.72 238.68 B: like three or four years ago i started having it and ah yeah but m- my dad was like that's exactly what i have so 

238.38 239.33 A: oh 

238.52 249.42 B: i knew that it was just yeah there's not really much you can do about it 'cause uh most of the you can take allergy medications but they make you incredibly exhausted um 'cause they're so ah 

249.82 253.09 B: like ah they're all like depressants and stuff like that so 

252.78 253.89 A: mhm 

253.40 254.33 B: um 

254.96 262.71 B: yeah i think another one of the questions that they asked was ah what do you do to keep yourself healthy when the weather changes 

261.35 262.36 A: (( oh right )) 

262.37 263.45 A: mhm 

263.85 269.82 B: um i take vitamin c. every day [laughter] i don't know that know that i don't know that it works but [laughter] 

266.59 268.50 A: yeah me too 

268.59 280.42 A: (( i do too i was thinking about it this morning i was like shit did i take my vitamin c. [laughter] even though you know you usually think wintertime you know is when you should be taking your vitamin c. but it's really like all the time )) 

269.83 270.67 B: [laughter] 

275.62 276.60 B: yeah 

280.40 286.56 B: yeah i think i think it it works to some degree i think like if you're going to get sick you're going to get sick but i think that 

280.81 281.71 A: (( you know )) 

286.60 287.68 B: ah 

288.22 292.43 B: it it mu- [mn] it's gotta help in some in some fashion you know 

290.45 291.45 A: yeah 

291.46 299.77 A: but i think there's a lot more than just vitamins that has to play into getting sick you know stress la- lack of sleep 

299.84 302.59 A: um just being open to 

302.65 306.75 A: um to illnesses you know it's not it's 

305.50 306.44 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

306.66 320.13 A: i mean health is you know eating habits play a big role in it just keeping your body healthy and stuff but i think there's a lot of other things that stem into illness and um [lipsmack] yeah [sigh] 

320.10 327.58 A: um yeah do you agree with you know the whole sleep thing and everything and [mn] do you think that that affects 

327.73 335.61 A: affects w- wellness basically like getting sick and stuff or do you think that it's mostly um you know 

335.68 338.81 A: your eating habits or whatever vitamins 

337.72 352.61 B: um i i definitely think that getting good sleep is a is a good way to prevent getting ill um i think oh an interesting thing that ah a friend of mine had at least he sent me an email about it or something it was ah 

344.23 345.14 A: mhm 

352.66 355.43 B: this interesting study that was done on ah 

355.69 359.36 B: how people get um tend to get ill 

359.37 366.51 B: not so much uh when they're really in ah a period of really being stressed out but right immediately after because your body 

365.91 367.27 A: uh-huh 

366.39 380.60 B: is so when you're when you're you know built up all that stress your body feels that it needs to to defend itself but right after you once you've told your body okay now it's time to relax that's the time that you tend to be most vulnerable and i and ah 

376.53 378.14 A: mhm 

380.49 394.70 B: um i'm a gra- i'm a graduate student so ah she sent this out like right before our semester ended and and lo and behold i got sick like right when ah when i when i like i removed myself from the academic pressures and stuff like that so 

388.73 390.39 A: yeah 

394.66 395.74 B: um 

396.04 399.46 B: ah i think there's something very true to that 

398.64 413.38 A: yeah i agree i mean in college it was always like that you know i'd go home and i'd be like oh i can relax and then it was like boom you're hit with sickness and you've no choice but to relax and and just like 

413.12 414.15 B: right 

413.37 415.93 A: be in your sickness and let it just 

416.07 418.24 A: you know live itself out 

416.10 417.73 B: right and it 

418.01 431.03 B: how many times have you talked to someone and they've said you know i'm going to go on vacation now or i'm you know i'm on my break or whatever and then they say oh no i just go sick and it's the one time that you really want to enjoy that time off that you have or that whatever you planned 

425.93 427.05 A: mhm 

430.39 431.83 A: mhm 

431.19 439.71 B: and then you hear that the person's sick and you say oh no you know you're like oh no [laughter] i wish you could enjoy the time that you've had planned to take off 

435.36 436.80 A: yeah 

439.10 440.53 A: yeah 

440.58 441.57 B: um 

441.67 445.97 B: so maybe it's you need to beef up your vitamin c. before that [laughter] 

442.25 443.58 A: definitely 

445.42 446.81 A: mhm 

446.94 461.12 A: yeah my um my brother's getting married this weekend and he w- just graduated from officer candidate school um with the navy like last week and then he gets married this week and i know he's been under an incredible amount of stress and just like 

461.12 466.06 A: it's my prayer that he just can release that 

466.02 476.44 A: this stress like my whole family just release the stress of the wedding and everything that's been going on so so that they can enjoy their time you know enjoy their wedding day and it's just like [lipsmack] 

471.49 472.50 B: yeah 

476.46 482.01 A: it it's amazing how how like our emotional state and 

482.18 483.75 A: everything affects 

483.78 487.55 A: um our bodies but it's so like 

485.49 486.47 B: yeah 

488.04 498.33 A: it's just it's thrilling also to know that like our bodies the way we are created was just amazing you know and just how everything's connected and like 

498.41 501.14 A: it's just i don't know it's 

499.62 506.63 B: yeah between the physical and the mental and the spiritual and everyth- yeah everything is is connected 

501.84 503.26 A: yeah 

505.81 506.88 A: mhm 

507.21 514.88 B: um yeah and then nowadays with you know sars is constantly in the news and that's a whole new scare 

514.68 515.78 A: yeah 

514.94 529.29 B: um and ah how people are dealing with that you know you're hoping and praying that that doesn't come here and affect us um 'cause it's it just seems like you don't really know how you keep yourself immune from something like that 

522.04 523.17 A: mhm 

528.53 529.64 A: mhm 

530.38 533.29 A: yeah there was um i saw in the paper 

533.74 537.06 A: was recently there's this picture of this 

537.11 544.47 A: chinese woman or asian woman covering her face with um a cloth and it was like 

544.41 557.06 A: people in chinatown are scared of sars and blah blah blah and who knows if this is like actually true i mean they just put this woman up on the front page like 

553.11 553.79 B: mm 

557.06 566.98 A: y- you don't know where that picture came from you know you don't know how you don't know how that was manipulated but just the fact that like that hype is being spread and like 

567.10 573.14 A: i don't know it's just interesting how how even the media plays into 

573.65 576.52 A: the whole health scare and 

576.73 583.96 A: [lipsmack] it's like can you just help us by not you know hyping this up and like making it 

582.51 584.97 B: right and causing everybody to be 

585.44 589.92 B: overly panicked before it really is a- anything to be panicked about 

586.52 587.72 A: yeah 

589.22 597.88 A: right and in that in the same vein like you are making yourself less resistant to 

598.45 599.89 A: to the disease
