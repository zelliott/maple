119.73 122.04 A: not very specific or centralized 

123.00 125.30 B: [laughter] i guess it depends on who you go to yeah 

125.83 131.18 A: [laughter] yeah i don't know wonder drugs that fix everything are just i 

131.79 140.75 B: oh like drugs are like wonder drugs are a little bit silly i think i mean obviously there are certain things that have been shown to work well like i mean definitely

203.80 204.72 B: yeah 

204.57 213.02 A: and then i know people that are allergic to everything like a friend of mine's allergic to dust and not only dust but she's allergic to grass 

213.83 216.95 A: that just seems like it wouldn't be very much fun to me 

216.74 222.61 B: i knew someone when i was little who was allergic to all diary products and all wheat products 

223.11 224.63 A: all of them 

224.01 233.08 B: all of them she was allergic to milk she was allergic to milk and she was allergic to wheat so she couldn't like eat like she'd eat like peanut butter on rye bread [laughter]

235.60 236.56 B: i don't know 

236.79 246.76 B: but the funny thing was the area that they were on is that she lived on a her family owned a dairy farm so here she was allergic to milk and her family owned a dairy farm 

247.33 249.40 A: that's just a bad combination 

249.34 251.93 B: (( it was it was it was pretty ironic ))

267.63 272.18 A: really see i thought the east coast was having an unusually late winter this year for some reason 

268.35 269.33 B: yeah 

271.62 280.11 B: well we did have some wintry weather over the last couple of weeks there was some fairly cold weather um but then you know we're getting some nice warm days now

298.37 300.79 A: well isn't philadelphia right on the coast too 

301.20 312.63 B: not so much it's not that far from the coast but it's totally different like san francisco has its own like weather system and as i'm sure you um you've been made aware oh 

311.86 316.70 A: yeah i i got a i i used to live right by there so i go there all the time it's my favorite city 

315.27 316.58 B: (( right then you know )) 

316.97 331.01 B: i i liked the city it was just the weather that drove me nuts 'cause like i love i love the change of seasons and it was really just like kinda felt dreary fall or spring day almost the whole time i was there [laughter] 

322.83 323.80 A: mhm 

328.65 329.97 A: yeah

342.27 343.65 B: the way it 

343.67 344.89 B: but 

343.99 346.09 A: (( [laughter] yeah [laughter] )) 

346.59 348.05 A: oh well 

348.29 353.26 A: let's see what else is there i don't know what else to talk about but the seasons i think we covered the topics

383.62 385.46 A: you get papers in law school 

385.28 392.69 B: oh yeah well it depends on what classes you take you can either do exams classes you have exams and some of your seminar classes you have papers 

392.75 395.63 A: really 'cause my aunt was telling me that she was in law school 

395.76 403.27 A: 'cause i thought she'd have a lot of paper and she said when she was in law school there were never any papers all there were was the tests which you had to know everything for the tests 

403.58 405.95 A: and so it was pretty much you know 

406.18 410.67 A: there was no other assignment except to study an inhumanly amount of 

410.28 411.94 B: [laughter] 

410.79 412.16 A: stuff every night 

412.09 424.39 B: they're recently extended it also a little bit but um you do still have to do a lot of reading and a lot of cramming for the exams i don't i mean it's not so different from anything else i think it's just a matter of kinda learning the style and the approach and 

418.77 420.34 A: (( mhm mm )) 

424.41 427.66 B: the language of the of the subject matter 

428.47 429.61 B: (( what do you study ))

443.49 445.21 A: do younger kids 

445.39 449.01 A: i don't really like high school kids and i don't like junior high school kids so 

447.00 447.98 B: [laughter] 

449.16 456.86 B: yeah i think my little sister she's at lee high university and i think she's looking to becoming uh a teacher for younger elementary school students 

457.15 459.36 A: an art teacher for elementary school 

459.44 464.65 B: um no and uh she's uh looking to be a teacher for elementary school i think 

463.39 467.03 A: oh i thought you said she was looking to be an art teacher for elementary school 

466.09 471.10 B: no interestingly enough my other sister is an artist but uh yeah 

470.51 472.07 A: how many sisters do you have 

471.89 472.84 B: just two 

473.05 474.93 A: are they both older or younger 

474.57 475.90 B: both younger 

476.52 477.81 A: wow 

477.33 478.35 B: yep 

477.88 478.92 A: (( nice )) 

478.75 480.73 B: (( how about you any siblings )) 

480.18 481.57 A: i'm an only child 

481.55 485.09 B: oh cool do you like it or not yeah well see 

482.33 483.79 A: got stepbrothers 

484.15 487.05 A: i guess i've got stepbrothers but 

487.21 491.56 B: that's kinda nice at least you have family around and but not uh you 

491.64 493.84 B: get spoiled fair enough [laughter] 

493.69 494.73 A: pretty much 

495.13 496.30 A: (( it )) 

496.36 498.70 A: was cool i didn't have to worry about sharing 

496.66 497.65 B: yeah 

498.51 501.00 B: (( right right had to learn that )) 

500.22 501.71 A: everything was mine 

501.76 503.91 B: (( that's great [laughter] )) 

503.29 504.33 A: [laughter] 

505.56 512.77 B: yeah no i uh i actually enjoyed having sisters or i do now even you know then it was kind of a pain in my butt 

510.06 511.25 A: mhm 

512.88 515.82 B: (( pardon my language i'm sorry i don't usually so crass )) 

515.85 517.45 B: um but um 

517.75 519.71 A: then again they always end up getting 

519.80 523.36 A: these things i from my understanding end up getting better as you get older 

523.05 528.61 B: yeah i i really i mean we're we're definitely as we're all becoming adults beginning to like each other a lot more 

528.80 532.44 A: yeah i know my mom and i get along a lot better now that i'm grown than 

528.99 529.72 B: (( so )) 

532.47 541.38 B: yeah that is definitely true that is definitely true my mom is like my mom was fairly young when she got married so she's uh not that much older 

532.81 534.95 A: we did when i was younger 

541.24 552.24 B: i mean like i should say like we're sort of all moving to a phase where she has some of her friends are younger than she is and some of my friends are older than i am so we both know a lot of people who are getting married and having babies 

549.33 550.18 A: mhm 

552.18 553.07 A: wow 

552.85 558.44 B: which is kinda funny because you know we're sort of moving into the same peer group in some ways 

558.72 559.36 B: (( you )) 

558.72 561.04 A: [laughter] 

559.54 565.95 B: know what you like like it's like my mom and i have similar friends this is odd but 

564.95 568.07 A: i don't want to ever have similar friends to my mother 

568.01 569.14 B: (( mhm mm )) 

570.38 571.29 A: wow 

571.19 584.14 B: i'm kind of in a unique situation now 'cause my mom had me when she was twenty three so you know it's not like it when when you get to you know the part where we are now we really are very much in the same in a similar peer group so 

583.37 584.26 A: mhm 

584.67 586.65 A: i think as i can understand that 

586.40 587.41 B: yeah 

588.32 589.21 A: (( um )) 

589.83 594.57 A: yeah my mom uh i don't know she's all our friends are older 

594.87 597.62 A: they seem like they're older than she is but i'm not sure 

598.17 599.89 B: i can see that sometimes 

598.46 599.37 A: (( some of them ))
