117.66 132.11 B: and i went to um a spanish neighborhood and got a pamali from like a little cart on the street or a little trailer on the street that was the hottest thing i ever ate in my entire life

187.00 192.38 A: i know [laughter] but do you like pizza 

192.16 193.73 B: oh yes 

193.55 198.12 A: new york has the best pizza i was out there when i was probably twelve 

198.26 201.87 A: and it was like the best pizza i ever had before 

201.64 203.02 B: (( the ah )) 

203.26 215.20 B: ah when i first came to new york i mean which was when i was a kid my parents were born here and ah it i'm talking about in the nineteen fifties 

215.22 224.73 B: and the pizza back then there was a a st- a store on the corner of uh right by the queensborough bridge at fifty ninth street and second avenue 

224.75 236.36 B: and the the first time i ever had pizza was takeout from this restaurant and i swear i remember it vividly and pizza wasn't as sweet as it is today 

236.37 239.19 B: you know it wa- it was more exotic 

239.02 242.16 A: yeah yeah i i 

242.48 257.12 A: i i've tried i've gone to europe and i've gone to italy and had their pizza and it does not compare to new york style pizza the pizza in italy is really really really awful i think it's 

257.03 260.08 A: really really really really thin 

260.18 270.74 A: and they just put like a scoop of sauce on it and just barely enough cheese and they put it in the oven and they serve it to you it's it's horrible pizza 

270.57 275.61 B: the uh i don't think i'd i don't like thin pizza i mean i love the chewy dough 

275.23 279.17 A: yeah i like mine with a lot of cheese on it 

278.60 283.92 B: well the worst place for pizza is chicago that deep dish stuff that they have is horrendous 

283.57 286.86 A: is it i've never eaten that i've never eaten out that way 

285.34 287.32 B: oh don't 

287.51 289.88 B: don't it's really bad 

289.75 291.65 A: how do you feel about italian 

291.35 293.29 B: oh i love italian 

292.95 294.67 A: is that your pick 

294.17 308.42 B: yeah i mean ah i'm a big pasta eater and i just about two or three years ago started making my own sauce 'cause i don't like ah the store bought sauces all have too many spices in it for me 

307.99 309.01 A: mhm 

308.60 323.27 B: so i i now this is a weird recipe but it's really good i use an equal amount of tomato paste those little cans of tomato paste if i put like three cans of tomato paste i put three cans of water 

318.60 319.56 A: yeah 

323.33 329.72 B: and all i put into it is onions um garlic and shredded carrot 

330.26 331.75 A: (( wow mhm )) 

330.37 341.81 B: and like i cook it that way and then i usually freeze it and when i it's very thick and when i cook the pasta i use the pasta water to thin it out 

341.84 345.11 B: and then i add fresh herbs ah 

345.70 351.71 B: in- instead of cooking with the herbs i hate dried oregano i can't stand that stuff 

351.33 352.56 A: yeah 

352.28 364.56 B: ah so uh matter of fact ah over the weekend i just bought this new califan pot it's like ah that's the one with all the circles in it they're really expensive and i 

363.62 365.13 A: is it worth it 

364.83 370.30 B: i bought it on uh amazon dot com on their friday sale 

369.82 370.78 A: mhm 

370.39 376.14 B: and i paid ten bucks for a big frying pan that's big enough to make sauce in 

375.90 377.00 A: wow 

376.23 381.51 B: and it is the greatest frying pan in the whole world and especially 'cause i only paid ten bucks for it [laughter] 

380.94 392.23 A: yeah oh yeah that is i love italian food and out here in california there are not that many um italian restaurants that are that great um but my 

392.16 397.74 A: favorite favorite favorite italian dish would have to be um chicken parmesan 

397.58 398.94 B: okay 

398.13 408.26 A: it's in that and uh chicken alfredo those are my two favorite dishes and i hate going to an italian restaurant because they always serve those two plates 

400.42 400.98 B: (( [mn] )) 

408.47 411.75 A: and i hate having to decide which one i want 

411.94 422.28 A: and so it's always like one one time i'll eat this and then the next time i have to eat the next the other dish that i didn't pick those are my two favorite favorite and uh 

421.32 425.16 B: is is chicken alfredo with the alfredo sauce 

424.90 426.03 A: yeah 

425.63 430.53 B: oh that stuff is wonderful it's a heart attack on a plate but it's wonderful 

429.08 430.06 A: (( yeah )) 

430.15 436.62 A: yeah yeah the best thing though italian wise that i make is i make killer lasagna 

436.75 445.20 A: i make such great uh lasagna but my lasagna when i make it i make it totally i make it with a lot of sugar 

445.26 446.47 B: okay 

445.87 453.83 A: and so it's sweet but i balance it out because i put a little bit of salt so it kinda evens it out but it it's 

453.92 460.91 A: like more like a treat but it's just different 'cause i i cook it with the hot italian sausage links 

461.06 472.69 A: and then half half italian sausage links and half ground beef then i just dump a lot of like ricotta cheese and it is to die for it is so good 

471.76 476.01 B: i love lasagna when uh when it's burnt a little bit 

475.61 477.80 A: oh that's hot that's the best 

477.85 479.42 A: that's the best 

478.92 493.85 B: matter of fact i had a uh a friend of mine over for dinner last week and and he is um a really italian and i made a steak and i knew i wanted to serve some pasta or something so i took leftover z._v. 

493.84 504.29 B: and i cooked it in a wok with oil so that it was real crispy and he loved it he'd never eaten anything like that and and i just thought of it at the last minute you know i'm gonna make
