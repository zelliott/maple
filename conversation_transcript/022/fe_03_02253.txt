7.21 11.55 B: you know this is i'm sorry [laughter] you doing oh spring cleaning 

9.54 10.59 A: [laughter] 

11.13 14.79 A: spring cleaning we finally got some warm weather here 

12.14 13.41 B: yeah what 

14.48 16.39 B: exac- well where are you calling from 

15.91 17.29 A: new brunswick 

17.10 19.24 B: oh i'm in texas 

18.68 22.54 A: oh yes [laughter] nice and warm down there [laughter] 

19.78 20.59 B: okay 

20.85 23.76 B: oh it's wonderful i got up and did my yard this morning 

22.82 31.95 A: [laughter] yes i have a friend down there who ah who j- put planted t- tomatoes last month i'm going oh my goodness [laughter] 

30.31 44.70 B: mhm yeah my husband has a small garden he just did tomatoes and oh you know what we can't get off the subject [laughter] i wasn't even thinking my daughter got me into this and she said we have to talk at least eight minutes on the subject so [sigh] and i know they 

36.43 38.87 A: yes [laughter] 

44.78 46.11 B: tape us so 

45.59 47.09 A: yeah 

46.33 54.72 B: but the thing was about illness and they specified colds i w- i could have talked plenty about just j- illness in general but colds 

54.87 56.02 A: well 

54.87 56.51 B: i don't know about [laughter] 

56.11 66.44 A: i find if you get outside at least once a day especially during the winter because you're closed up in the house all the time everything's closed down okay 

66.01 67.16 B: mhm 

66.51 69.17 A: so you're not getting your change of fresh air 

68.67 70.19 B: exactly 

69.33 74.30 A: and if you have people coming in and out of your home you get more exposed to the germs 

74.14 85.52 A: so by getting outside for at least twenty minutes no matter how cold it is out 'cause you can always dress warm right and get that fresh air into your lungs and that makes a big difference and i take vitamins 

79.49 80.93 B: yeah that's true 

85.79 94.33 B: oh now see i started vitamins oh a few years back and i'm so bad about taking medicine for a while and then i just give up on it so 

93.76 96.80 A: well you see what i do is i take our vitamins at supper time 

96.45 97.56 B: mhm 

97.23 101.62 A: so this way we sit down to supper 'cause we always have a sit down meal 

101.47 103.26 B: oh that's wonderful 

101.68 104.99 A: and the vitamins sitting right there beside your glass 

105.03 107.41 A: so it's [laughter] 

106.49 108.85 B: but now that works yeah 

107.63 112.66 A: yeah yeah you know and i always did that with the kids and um 

111.80 113.82 B: how many children do you have 

113.18 114.22 A: five 

113.95 115.75 B: oh really we've got four 

115.43 123.80 A: p- plus i've been a foster h- ah um a foster home for teens and young ones and ah this is my first break 

124.52 130.66 A: [sigh] ah this year in well since i started having kids [laughter] so 

128.11 134.90 B: oh my gosh yeah i babysat for twenty nine years and i just quit last year at the end of last year 

133.17 134.17 A: yeah 

134.62 141.00 A: well yeah it's funny 'cause i i've been looking after two boys um [lipsmack] and they stay a lot for supper 

138.08 139.03 B: mhm 

140.73 141.64 B: mhm 

141.01 144.69 A: and i got them started on vitamins and the mom was saying that last year 

144.58 157.17 A: her boys missed so much school because they constantly had colds or whatever was going around and i put 'em on the vitamins and i picked up her so that we'd both be doing the same thing 

150.91 152.02 B: mhm 

157.32 159.73 A: and they had one cold all winter 

159.69 161.71 B: oh that's wonderful 

160.91 164.35 A: [sigh] yeah so she was going well okay [laughter] 

163.96 176.92 B: yeah see my family is as bad as i am they'll start something and then not complete it so even if i laid vitamins out for my two boys that are still here at home they would just after a while i'd probably find them out there the next day so 

177.06 177.80 A: (( [laughter] )) 

177.42 181.66 B: 'cause everybody's so active here that we don't really have a sit down meal that often 

181.35 188.24 A: yeah you see that's see that was one of my my old fashioned things my grandmother taught me is [cough] 

186.69 187.75 B: mhm 

188.81 197.27 A: unless it's really really important that everybody should be home to have a sit down meal so ev- the family gets together once a day 

194.84 196.67 B: oh i agree 

196.81 201.76 B: yeah because growing up there were ten kids in my family and we always had sit down meals 

201.06 201.98 A: mhm 

202.01 208.86 B: yep but i guess we just got caught up in the rat race and everybody went their separate ways 

207.22 208.39 A: [sigh] 

209.20 214.40 A: [laughter] well we we're up here in canada over there in ontario they're dealing with that sars problem 

214.27 216.57 B: oh exactly yeah 

215.36 223.62 A: oh yeah you know so it's sort of like it's not yeah it's it's ah we haven't had it luckily in new brunswick but ah 

216.70 218.58 B: that's real scare 

223.75 228.37 A: [lipsmack] you know it's it's [laughter] a it's a scary thing you know 

227.45 232.42 B: oh yeah but you know what your vitamin thing maybe that's helping people 

228.48 229.35 A: yeah 

232.60 238.11 B: if you're really [sigh] religious about taking your vitamins then maybe it would help 

236.61 237.57 A: (( yep )) 

237.74 251.72 A: yep i i i every day my husband and i and it's it's ah it's just sort of a an automatic now we go in the fridge we get our milk [laughter] to put on the table and the vitamins we keep them in the fridge right because of change of temperature 

246.25 247.16 B: mhm 

251.90 259.02 B: oh now see i never thought about that i'm so bad about keeping all my medication in that cabinet and they say a lot of it should go in the refrigerator 

258.75 271.28 A: mm 'cause i keep it on the little on the door you know you always have that little space there on the door and that's like oh where we keep our our ah our our vitamins and that because we heat with wood so the house gets very dry in the winter 

259.12 261.51 B: just to preserve it yeah 

263.01 263.94 B: yeah 

270.95 272.02 B: mhm 

271.38 274.13 A: right and then it gets very humid in the summer 

274.17 275.47 B: oh yeah 

274.81 278.60 A: right so this way it's kept the pills are always kept at a constant temperature 

278.36 280.02 B: that's true 

280.08 283.12 B: see i just don't think things through like that [laughter] 

281.76 289.66 A: [laughter] well that's the advantage of having the internet because you know there's always you know you're all ah 

289.52 302.86 A: you're always wandering around um especially for me and i run across on this and that in the strangest of places you know [lipsmack] um we also we try to have at least one glass of orange juice a day 

297.98 298.82 B: yeah 

302.98 304.31 B: oh that's good 

303.69 310.98 A: you know so to get at least at least ah our vitamin c. that way you know 'cause ah we live way out in the country 

307.33 308.65 B: yeah 

311.01 314.65 A: so the corner store is like not around the corner 

314.32 323.46 B: oh exactly yeah [sigh] now i grew up in the country and then we moved into town when i was in the fourth grade and of course i lived in kansas i was raised in kansas 

323.56 326.18 B: [sigh] and then my husband and i moved to texas 

326.23 329.65 B: about two years after we got married and we've been here ever since 

329.03 331.09 A: well i grew up in montreal 

331.32 337.94 A: for forty for the for twenty years when i got pregnant with my first child i said get up i'm not raising my children [sigh] in this pollution 

338.00 338.92 A: you know 

338.61 339.47 B: (( uh huh )) 

339.41 348.12 A: and i moved out and i got moved to new brunswick here five years ago and yeah the con- the the the the the we're close to fredericton 

348.23 357.86 A: and the city is so small it's like our suburb from montreal you know [laughter] so when you when you like [lipsmack] five minutes either way you're out in the country 

352.64 354.13 B: oh really 

357.92 361.59 B: oh oh that'd be wonderful i'd love to be in the country 

358.61 359.56 A: so 

360.98 369.11 A: i'd i'd ah i just i just love it you know you can i mean we just walk across the highway and there's a big road all the way through all through the woods 

363.66 364.60 B: yeah 

369.22 375.28 A: and ah 'cause i think it fresh air is one of the most important things you know 

375.74 385.37 A: that ah to to to keep you healthy you know to keep the lungs healthy to k- you know to get all that stale air uh outta ya outta ya you know i think that's the best 

377.89 378.99 B: yeah 

385.10 386.43 B: yeah 

385.86 391.98 A: no ah and the exercise too [laughter] [laughter] 

388.21 392.00 B: well yeah that's true and i don't get either of them [laughter] 

392.04 404.99 A: 'cause like today we we were we're getting up to about seventy degrees so ah we finally have like 'cause we plastic our windows because we get a lot of ah very strong ah winds here okay 'cause we're up like um 

402.16 403.09 B: mhm 

405.09 410.61 A: up from a valley so we really get very strong winds i mean and maybe two days a year we don't get winds here 

410.43 411.89 B: oh really 

410.81 425.70 A: so we we plastic our windows so i'm just today finally we've had enough nice days that i just ah unplastic a few windows and i got doors open and i've washed curtains and [laughter] 

423.10 433.18 B: oh that sounds wonderful see i just get set in my ways my blinds stay closed my windows are closed the air is running and i know that's not good i got my 

433.29 437.26 B: a little bit of fresh air this morning when i went out and mowed the yard and that's about it 

436.57 438.74 A: mhm 

438.02 449.65 B: but ah what's funny i never get colds i'm about the only one in the family well my husband and i the the kids get colds all the time and i've got a daughter with four children and they've all got asthma 

449.76 455.31 B: and i think part of that is they're stuck inside so much they don't r- they're not that active they don't get out a lot 

454.51 462.78 A: mm yeah yeah it it's it's there's a big change from when when i grew up and and the kids today the kids today spend a lot of time in front of the 

458.50 459.46 B: mhm 

462.70 472.35 A: the t._v. or the computer or the gameboys and ah kids are just not getting enough exercise they're not getting enough fresh air 

463.32 466.13 B: t._v. and the internet mhm 

471.67 472.84 B: that's true 

472.48 476.86 A: and they're so they're constantly stuck and and then they go to school 

476.94 489.90 A: and so they're stuck in environments where there's hundreds of kids and the the air's not changed so you get w- when a bad cold or flu goes around you f- you find half the school out 

489.35 492.21 B: that's true and that happens here so much 

493.01 502.14 A: [cough] they they they used to have we used to have recess you know twice a day and we used to get outside we used to have gym that the schools don't have that any more 

497.27 498.21 B: yeah 

503.13 517.08 B: now here i noticed that the elementary schools they they're still out on the playground during recess i mean but then when they get into middle school and high school they don't really offer that much unless the kid's go out for sports they they're outside for that other than that 

514.99 516.19 A: yeah 

516.98 522.06 B: they're inside they have gym inside and yeah so they're not getting out at all and then once they get home 

522.43 529.80 B: most kids just go home to an empty house they're gonna get in front of the t._v. or whatever they're not going to get out and hang out with their friends outside 

526.10 527.70 A: mhm 

529.92 539.66 A: well when my kids were growing up it was always they came in from school and no matter how cold it was i wanted them to go out and play for at least half an hour outside so to get their 

539.72 541.93 A: some fresh air get the brain going 

541.54 542.67 B: mhm 

541.95 550.82 A: again so you know and same thing growing my kids took vitamins growing up ah maybe one cold a year and that was it 

550.57 560.64 B: you know that [sigh] and my kids when they were little they took vitamins and they didn't mind taking 'em as they get older they kind of get away from all that they just they think they've got their own well they have their own mind and 

558.93 568.88 A: well well i'm i'm i'm i'm a i'm a tough lady you it's like [laughter] i'm the boss of this house and mommy says you take vitamins and that's it [laughter] 

561.98 562.76 B: (( yeah but )) 

563.07 564.30 B: i guess i have 

565.23 566.74 B: (( yeah )) 

567.40 572.85 B: i guess i wasn't tough enough 'cause when i got started they were too old to do that so i didn't push it 

568.92 570.39 A: [laughter] 

570.99 582.74 A: [laughter] no and then when they moved out i gave 'em all the bottles i'd [laughter] kept the regimen going so and they and and because they got into such a routine that they do it automatic now 

575.66 577.08 B: [laughter] 

580.79 581.71 B: mhm 

582.41 596.26 B: but that is good yeah once you get in a routine then it's ki- uh 'cause i'm that way about certain things you get in a routine and it's hard to get away from it you just feel guilty if you fall away from it but i haven't got that instilled in my kids yet so 

589.89 591.03 A: mhm 

592.57 593.83 A: (( yep ah )) 

595.88 599.90 A: well another is is good sleep you know proper sleeping ah you
