15.05 28.97 A: oh gosh yes i understand the allergies but like in the fall i a lot of people i know before i knew before i moved where i am now um the shortness of the days used to cause somewhat of a depression 

24.52 25.12 B: (( mm )) 

29.55 31.70 B: yeah it's true because 

31.71 39.79 B: uh with my allergies i took allergy shots but that still doesn't alleviate me getting them from year to year 

39.67 41.87 A: oh the allergies you're talking about 

41.24 42.33 B: (( yeah mm )) 

41.94 45.58 A: um i found that the older i get 

45.96 55.20 A: the more i never suffer from allergies and the same thing um the older i get i went to i had a cold that would not go away 

55.04 56.01 B: mhm 

55.18 67.56 A: and i went to the doctor and he he said this is no cold this is allergies and i looked at him like hey you're crazy but at the older i get the more i suffer and um 

62.53 63.54 B: right 

67.90 70.81 A: i agree [laughter] 

69.78 76.27 B: well the way i found out i had allergies was that i went to a nutrition seminary 

76.17 77.32 A: mhm 

76.70 78.79 B: and they took my blood pressure 

78.69 79.71 A: uh-huh 

79.25 86.89 B: and they told me you have allergies and i said no years ago i had allergies to tomatoes 

86.99 93.47 B: and sure enough i you know i went to the doctor for what i thought was a cold like yourself 

93.63 98.46 B: and uh but it lasted like five to seven days 

98.76 105.13 B: and he went and i told him what they told me at the seminar 

104.37 105.96 A: nutrition right 

105.48 114.57 B: and he said to me well let's take your blood and sure enough he said you have a very high concentration of allergy 

114.83 118.44 B: and i just had learned to live 

117.12 119.26 A: it surprised you [laughter] 

119.13 129.81 B: yeah i had learned to live with it because i just thought it was bronchitis and i just thought i was at certain times you know a couple of times a year i would get a cold 

129.69 130.87 A: right 

129.90 140.88 B: an- and that you know i also had sinuses so that's i said well put it up to that but it after i had the allergy shots 

140.95 144.88 B: then the uh cold diminished 

144.61 149.03 A: so so your allergies are more or less seasonal 

148.62 150.01 B: right 

149.45 154.38 A: okay but it's well then you must live in a colder climate than i do

197.10 198.34 B: mhm 

198.19 200.91 A: with um the lack of light

238.73 239.70 B: right 

241.82 254.36 A: um thank god i ha- i raise dogs labradors and i'm not allergic to them but what i have found is they suffer just as much from pollen

277.73 278.70 A: okay 

283.91 284.75 A: yes 

284.25 288.20 B: ah i don't always stay contained because i have 

287.20 289.10 A: no uh-huh

295.49 296.78 A: mhm 

296.17 303.48 B: ah i also have diabetes so i try to make sure i have a good diet and i walk 

303.13 308.22 A: good that sounds like you're taking pretty good care of yourself but okay 

305.78 306.86 B: (( yes )) 

308.21 320.54 A: ho- how do you what do you think about this sometimes i think that the air well like you say with the fresh air i think the inside of your house is more toxic than the outside oh my goodness 

317.53 319.32 B: oh absolutely 

319.94 324.14 B: absolutely i mean we have molds up here 

323.09 326.74 A: oh gosh mould like you would i know mould 

325.73 328.10 B: and uh i mean just 

328.20 333.91 B: i i can clean and the next day i see nothing but dust so i know 

333.41 335.40 A: oh yes i understand 

334.42 337.20 B: and the windows aren't even open 

335.68 346.99 A: well where where does it come from [laughter] i'm telling you i know dust i know dust i have never i it i i don't know where it's coming from either 

338.03 339.34 B: (( [laughter] yeah that's what )) 

339.46 340.83 B: (( i [laughter] )) 

346.66 360.79 B: and i think that gives you colds too because i think taking in all the dust taking in all the particles that blow around the house i think that has a lot to do with your immune system 

351.82 353.28 A: oh sure it's you 

353.40 354.84 A: you're filling them 

360.18 361.25 A: right 

360.77 365.65 B: uh breaking yourself down because you're not in a sterile environment 

365.06 367.26 A: no no 

365.97 369.05 B: and um you're bound to get 

369.54 379.25 B: colds thank goodness i can say i don't get as many i used to get it when i before the shots i got it like six times 

379.49 388.35 B: a year that i mean it was severe because i don't put medicine in my mouth and i don't even take an aspirin and stuff like that 

384.52 386.00 A: oh i don't either 

386.52 390.28 A: no no uh-huh no i don't either 

388.67 397.00 B: and uh but i was finding myself more and plus i went from the city environment 

397.28 401.95 B: to a rural environment and i found you know 

401.61 406.28 A: you there is a rural i mean i'm in the rural i'm in in the country also 

405.87 406.93 B: right 

406.29 408.43 A: and is that cleaner for you 

409.23 414.83 B: in some ways it's cleaner but in some ways i'm more susceptible 

414.91 429.08 B: uh to things i wasn't susceptible in the city because of the pollen and the trees and the flowers so that that brought on a lot of reactions uh and i'm basically uh a home 

417.18 418.23 A: right 

418.71 419.72 A: pollen 

429.04 432.67 B: kind of therapy person i

446.05 452.95 B: yeah we may be of the same era we may be of the same age era that's what it is 

446.80 450.14 A: i wait it out pardon me 

452.42 458.06 A: oh uh okay um i can disclose my age i'm not ashamed of it i turned fifty one 

457.94 458.97 B: see i'm

504.63 512.22 B: when i'm sick with a cold and they have to give me medicine it's got to be of a lower level because 

506.83 508.19 A: well you know 

511.24 515.06 A: it's good though i think yeah that's good because i used to think 

512.71 513.59 B: yeah 

515.23 528.46 A: a little is good more is better but i learned through my experience that a little is fine and you work your way out take care of the small you know if that's not enough then fine i still have the option of a little more
