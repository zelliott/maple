5.43 7.84 A: what was the last thing she said 

7.25 7.93 B: (( um )) 

8.26 15.68 B: i i don't know i was uh kinda concentrating on the first one i i didn't realize that she was gonna do several different ones um one 

14.85 15.62 A: (( uh )) 

15.94 18.14 B: of them was if you get sick 

18.31 21.12 B: um most people get sick during 

21.20 25.88 B: like the flu season what do i do or what do we do to keep from getting sick 

23.29 24.12 A: yeah 

25.65 32.74 A: yeah there was something else like it's the last thing she said was something about doing something during the week or 

33.24 35.17 A: what do you do at the end of the week 

33.60 34.51 B: oh 

34.70 39.15 B: oh um something about seven days wasn't it oh i don't know 

38.59 40.19 A: [laughter] 

39.52 41.70 B: i guess we could just talk about illness huh 

41.67 42.51 A: yeah 

41.72 43.15 B: do you get sick a lot 

43.12 46.16 A: no actually i haven't gotten sick in years [laughter] 

46.80 47.64 A: uh 

46.99 49.04 B: i personally don't get sick either 

49.34 55.74 B: but um my family gets sick and they'll get sick like especially my husband has um allergies really bad he'll get sick a lot 

55.48 56.76 A: oh yeah 

56.15 64.26 B: uh round the flu season and it gets really bad and it'll la- and it'll last for a week and then it'll go away and then it'll come back and and i seem not to get sick 

64.56 65.47 A: yeah 

64.87 70.12 B: kinda strange though maybe it might be the fact that i eat more greens than he does 

69.98 71.95 A: yeah i 

71.05 72.73 B: stuff like that 

72.06 75.26 A: tend to eat a lot healthier than the rest of my family [laughter] 

74.83 79.13 B: yeah i i mean 'cause he my husband he don't eat any greens no vegetables pretty much 

78.98 79.87 A: yeah 

79.23 83.49 B: and i always tell him that's why he always get sick is because he don't eat enough vegetables 

83.64 85.47 B: but he refuses that's not right 

85.34 90.51 A: [laughter] yeah and i have uh two younger brothers and they still get sick all the time 

90.57 93.44 A: and they i mean i never catch it [laughter] 

93.60 94.75 A: and 

94.95 97.35 A: (( i don't know maybe i maybe sisters )) 

97.41 102.89 A: and they really are the bread and meat eaters um i have one brother who won't eat anything green 

103.08 106.57 A: it just it has to be like brown or red [laughter] 

107.82 109.05 A: pretty much meat 

108.00 109.99 B: and he does he get sick a lot 

110.34 111.97 A: (( yeah actually they do )) 

111.90 114.32 B: what with what like flu and just 

113.73 114.95 A: yeah um 

115.62 121.80 A: i don't know they either the the sniffles and the uh the cold always hits them really bad 

120.97 123.63 B: yeah the cold always gets my husband too 

124.60 127.09 B: so what do you think you think that you um 

127.23 130.22 B: you stay healthier by eating well is that what 

130.61 132.30 A: yeah i mean like 

132.36 137.56 A: you know i try and do the work out thing supposedly that's supposed to help too but i mean i don't do it 

138.15 141.93 A: as probably as much as i should but you know i think it's a combination of 

142.31 144.34 A: you're just trying to stay healthy and like 

144.37 146.17 A: it's a lot harder for you to catch anything 

145.90 147.22 B: yeah i think you're right 

147.37 157.72 B: i'm and i think that sleep has a lot to do with it too it's if you get a lot of sleep then that seems to help you help your immune system some so that you don't get as sick 

155.67 160.46 A: yeah i'm definitely a sleeper [laughter] definitely a sleeper [laughter] 

158.26 159.11 B: huh 

159.79 162.25 B: oh me too an- and that might be another reason 

163.01 164.90 B: sleep a lot don't get sick 

164.59 165.73 A: yeah 

166.28 168.65 A: yeah i mean sometimes i feel like 

169.20 176.13 A: you know when you're just having an off like there's days when i just like i just don't feel like going to work so i pretend i'm sick 

176.55 182.54 A: [laughter] stuff like that even i i haven't been sick in you know i think i think since i was like sixteen 

182.76 184.04 B: really 

183.42 184.33 A: yeah 

184.35 186.33 A: as i said a very long time [laughter] 

185.87 187.86 B: (( that you have doesn't that worry you )) 

188.64 190.19 A: that i haven't gotten sick 

189.59 191.15 B: (( yeah )) 

190.39 191.16 A: i 

191.20 192.50 A: not really 

191.96 203.88 B: well 'cause i the only reason why i say that is because my dad he never got sick hardly ever would get sick and then uh when he would get sick it'd be really really bad he would be really sick 

203.41 204.68 A: oh yeah 

204.03 217.42 B: like where he wouldn't be able to get out of bed for days and that's always worried me thinking that you know i don't get sick as much as normal people do either and i don't have allergies to anything except i have uh one allergy to penicillin 

206.45 207.61 A: yeah 

212.90 213.69 A: yeah 

217.72 226.83 B: but my husband he has allergies to practically anything there is out there um he's allergic to dust mites dust 

226.94 235.95 B: things like that and uh my sister's real allergic to animals and trees some sort of trees but i don't really have any allergies too many 

230.46 232.49 A: [mn] that must be hard 

236.09 237.01 A: (( uh-uh mm )) 

236.67 239.22 B: my hu- my little boy doesn't have any either so 

239.29 240.23 B: (( i don't know )) 

240.77 247.69 B: he had asthma when he was uh my hu- my husband had asthma when he was younger but he grew out of it and my mom has asthma now 

247.44 248.43 A: yeah 

248.56 254.11 A: yeah and it like all the me and my brothers we used to have um allergies when we were younger but 

254.12 255.48 A: they all disappeared as 

255.58 257.57 A: we grew up i don't know 

257.13 258.95 B: (( what did you have an allergy to )) 

258.76 262.36 A: um i had an allergy to strawberries and uh 

262.43 266.91 A: the second had an allergy to milk and the third had an allergy to both 

266.29 268.55 B: what happened when you when you had those 

268.61 272.52 A: um for me and my brother it wasn't too bad like um 

272.95 281.86 A: for the middle one he wo- he would just kind of like get sick and like you know he just kind of he it'd kind of fog his brain 

281.85 282.88 B: really 

281.87 292.31 A: it was wei- it was a weird kind of because he wouldn't have like really you know adverse we like we wouldn't have to take him to the hospital or anything but he wouldn't be able to like think for a couple hours he'd just like 

292.12 294.41 B: wow that's scary 

292.77 299.35 A: it was kind of weird yeah and the youngest one he had it worse i mean you know he'd do the whole hives and 

299.53 305.03 A: he had it full blown allergies [laughter] like i remember he drank what was it a capri sun 

305.45 308.49 A: once and it didn't say it had strawberries in it but um 

308.52 318.30 A: i guess they mix all the juices in the same vats and the i don't know strawberry got into it and uh he ballooned up and we had to [laughter] take him to the hospital and it was bad 

318.31 331.14 B: [noise] my brother was allergic to bees pretty bad we had we went one time to a little park and it had those li- those rocky horses where you put your fingers in the eyeballs and he put his both his fingers inside the eyeballs and there was a bee nest in there 

326.71 327.71 A: oh yeah 

330.82 331.71 A: (( mm oh )) 

331.17 336.33 B: and it bit him and his fingers swelled up he was his eyes were getting real red and puffy 

336.37 339.64 B: my mom was terrified terrified 

340.27 341.14 B: but 

341.12 342.73 A: yeah [laughter] 

342.39 355.83 B: they said whenever i broke out i broke out when i when i was little i had um penicillin for like an ear infection and i broke out with hives real bad and uh that never they always asked me to what kind of allergies you have and when i say penicillin and then they say well what happened to you 

355.76 359.54 B: like and well i don't care what happened to me because i'm not trying it again [laughter] 

359.01 364.77 A: yeah yeah i mean that uh actually probably a good thing that you found out about that early on because i mean 

365.31 366.48 A: if you ever like 

367.24 370.92 A: went to the hospital or something and didn't know it it could be 

369.98 372.28 B: yeah i didn't know it that would be real scary 

372.03 374.00 A: yeah it could be more fatal 

373.12 375.99 B: 'cause they use a they use that a lot 

375.47 376.35 A: yeah 

377.16 381.30 A: like i think any time you go into surgery or something they usually give you penicillin and 

380.68 382.69 B: really i've never been in surgery so 

383.35 384.35 A: yeah 

383.66 385.18 B: i wouldn't know how that was 

386.13 393.92 A: yeah it's 'cause my mom she's actually she she's been real sick and uh she actually had to go into surgery a couple of times and stuff and uh 

394.19 397.37 A: yeah so know about the pill- penicillin and stuff 

397.54 400.97 B: so whenever your brother broke out with the strawberry thing or was that you 

401.65 403.55 A: um i'm sorry 

402.85 404.74 B: you're allergic to strawberries 

404.20 412.76 A: yeah i i was kinda the same as the one with milk it's like i think it it made me sick but it wasn't like really severe 

412.84 413.98 A: and and 

414.03 416.50 A: i grew out of it after about ten years 

416.85 417.67 A: like 

418.40 419.32 A: i don't know 

420.10 428.93 B: whenever my little boy was ah a baby you know after you take them off of the enfamil like at a year you're supposed to start introducing them to milk 

428.50 429.56 A: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

428.90 439.41 B: and every single time i'd give him milk he'd just start to gag and then later that night he would throw up and it was so terrifying 'cause i didn't realize that it was the milk that was doing it to him 

439.14 440.18 A: (( oh mm )) 

439.60 440.43 B: so 

440.48 446.25 B: he would he would actually gag to the the taste of milk or maybe it was the texture i don't know 

446.25 459.75 B: but i didn't give him milk for a long time and now he's drinking milk but he drinks it pretty fine he don't seem to have any allergic reaction to it but he would throw up every single time and they ran test after test trying to figure out why he was sick like that but 

450.99 451.86 A: yeah 

459.89 460.61 A: mm 

460.62 462.98 B: he seems to be fine with milk now 

460.68 461.65 A: (( yeah ah )) 

463.63 473.81 B: it's probably just one of those things like kids that you know like eggs and um peanuts and stuff like that you're not supposed to give to babies maybe it was something like that but i thought milk would be something good for him 

473.52 474.38 A: yeah 

474.43 480.32 A: yeah and my brother when he was allergic to milk it was um it was actually mostly cows' milk 

480.46 483.61 A: for some reason maybe it was like the way they processed it or something 

480.53 481.54 B: oh 

483.72 487.95 A: but it just had an adverse reaction to him because he could drink goats' milk 

487.98 489.18 B: oh really 

488.60 493.87 A: yeah my mom um when he was a kid she gave him goats' milk instead of regular milk and that was fine 

493.84 495.37 B: have you tried goats' milk 

495.17 498.67 A: ah i personally have never tasted goats' milk [laughter] 

498.50 509.10 B: [laughter] i haven't never tried it either i that cheese dips they make at the mexican restaurants someone said that it was made out of ch- uh goat cheese and i was like ooh i don't know if i want any more of that 

509.35 517.48 A: oh goat cheese was i have had goat cheese but that's different than milk because like they flavor it for the different kinds of cheese 

513.11 514.49 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

517.80 519.11 A: (( um i don't know [laughter] )) 

519.37 522.37 B: [laughter] it's not made from goats' milk [laughter] 

523.27 524.53 B: (( i don't know though uh-huh what does she )) 

524.54 525.35 A: (( oh )) 

526.31 529.10 A: yeah i don't know i tend to um 

529.14 537.27 A: well actually 'cause the way my mom got sick they think um what is it like the hormones they give to animals and stuff the- they actually um 

534.77 535.68 B: (( have uh-huh )) 

537.29 538.99 A: induced her illness 

539.18 544.65 A: like made it come on even faster so that's like i try and stay away from all the 

545.00 547.89 A: i i'm try and go organic because um 

548.09 550.32 A: what she had was hereditary [laughter] 

549.86 551.33 B: (( does she like have a have )) 

550.86 553.31 A: she had a uterit- uterine fibroids 

553.01 554.30 B: (( have to have a hysterectomy no )) 

554.08 556.74 A: uh basically like tumors in your 

557.05 558.15 A: uterus 

557.87 560.82 B: (( she actually um she's a big patient advocate now 'cause she doesn't believe in hysterectomies )) 

562.86 563.87 A: (( and )) 

567.10 568.41 B: (( because really )) 

567.76 578.87 A: yeah doctors do them all the time i guess and um like she knows women who she knew a woman who was like twenty eight years old and they gave her a hysterectomy because like he couldn't do anything else which is not true [laughter] 

578.80 582.25 B: yeah my mom had a hysterectomy when she was real young 

582.26 586.17 B: probably around like twenty eight twenty seven twenty eight real young 

583.87 584.75 A: yeah 

586.38 594.60 A: yeah and my mom's just an advocate against it because um like most of the doctors are male and they don't understand why women would need their uterus at all 

595.35 596.65 B: yeah 

596.02 597.17 A: [laughter] i don't know 

597.82 599.04 B: so she's uh
