5.68 7.06 A: sorry 

7.45 14.26 A: yeah can you know what i'm actually driving so can you tell me the topic because i didn't hear it [laughter] 

13.22 19.91 B: uh the seasons of the the change of seasons sometimes cause illness 

19.62 20.61 A: okay 

20.18 22.33 B: and do we agree with that it 

21.98 22.98 A: um 

23.30 25.54 A: you want me to go first or 

24.46 26.14 B: doesn't matter mhm 

25.88 34.60 A: all right i definitely agree because i'm in new york and i don't know i hear your accent so i guess you're not from new york but um 

34.10 35.80 B: i'm from pennsylvania 

35.65 37.72 A: yeah like the weather 

38.31 41.05 A: change has been unreal 

41.22 42.73 A: will you hold on one second [noise] 

42.37 43.38 B: sure 

66.41 68.28 B: i hope i didn't lose you 

67.91 68.91 A: hello 

68.54 69.84 B: oh you there 

69.66 73.44 A: yeah there was actually a cop car next to me believe it or not 

71.94 72.74 B: (( [laughter] )) 

72.78 74.80 B: well hope they didn't pull you over 

74.39 80.39 A: no but they i got a little nervous there because i don't usually talk and drive i'm sorry i'm so sorry so um 

79.47 80.65 B: that's fine 

80.70 87.90 A: yeah the change in seasons basically everyone in my office keeps getting sick um what do you think 

87.85 95.45 B: well i think uh winter and uh harsh weather definitely does bring on what they used the call the flu season 

95.49 100.49 B: and one of the comments that was made that if you treat a cold 

100.83 114.61 B: i forget anyway it's like a cold usually lasts for seven days i agree with that uh if it is untreated and if you go to the doctor it's three days but anyway you know a cold usually has to run its course it's always been my experience anyway 

114.76 122.52 B: but yes there is such a thing as flu season i think the doctors allow for that especially with elderly people 

122.89 128.83 B: and uh otherwise they wouldn't have what they call flu shots to give to people 

129.14 144.09 B: uh they also wanted to know if there was uh what we would do to prevent getting cold um myself i just take the normal precautions i i layer my clothing we had a hell of a winter here in pennsylvania 

144.07 150.01 A: but do you find that because the weather has been changing so drastically more people are getting sick 

150.15 155.72 B: i do think so i think uh the flu uh epidemics have been more severe 

155.77 161.07 B: and uh things like that because one day it's warm and then you go 

161.16 167.92 B: it changes overnight drastically and uh i think that's bad on your your 

163.11 164.11 A: right 

168.54 169.72 B: system 

169.76 183.34 B: and uh as far as catching colds and getting flus and things like that we had a very bad bad winter season here where i live with uh children having flus our school was actually shut down 

183.75 186.23 B: and uh for a few days 

185.25 187.07 A: because people were sick 

187.15 192.59 B: yeah the children were all there were so many children out they decided not to have classes 

193.06 202.99 B: our emergency room in union town could not take any more patients at one time because the hospital was filled with just people that had the flu 

193.33 194.35 A: oh wow 

203.34 206.41 B: so we had a pretty bad epidemic of it uh 

206.60 217.44 B: i don't know a lot of people believe in getting these flu shots uh they the doctors recommend the elderly to get them but i don't believe in them myself 

217.49 220.26 B: i don't get them it's jus a matter of 

220.53 223.61 B: choice i guess but uh 

223.73 234.17 B: just taking the necessary precautions that you normally would you know layer your clothing and try to avoid people who are sick but that's almost impossible 

234.28 235.68 B: and uh 

235.72 245.31 A: i mean i think it's also hard where like if you leave in the morning and you wear you know a certain type of clothing and by the time you get home the weather 

245.61 247.30 B: oh absolutely 

245.70 247.92 A: is completely different i 

247.39 250.61 B: absolutely our weather has been wild this year 

250.61 252.67 A: [laughter] 

251.30 257.20 B: it's been really cr- like you'll have like two or three days even spring's even late at you know 

256.76 258.28 A: yeah 

257.41 263.43 B: it's bad it's just bad and we had a terrible winter here we had record breaking snowfalls 

263.45 267.48 B: and you said you're from new york i think you had it up there as well 

267.22 269.05 A: yeah 

268.13 276.48 B: so it hasn't been good and uh i do think the cold weather does bring a lot of the the colds and the flus on 

276.85 282.14 B: uh i think uh going to a tanning bed helps uh avoid colds 

281.95 283.61 A: going to a tanning bed 

283.22 286.38 B: yeah [laughter] [laughter] 

284.37 285.14 A: (( really )) 

285.34 288.21 A: (( i've i've never heard that before )) 

287.77 292.87 B: well i think it's like light therapy for the bad months when you're depressed and everything 

292.30 293.85 A: [laughter] 

293.42 296.03 B: and it kind of cheers you up 

295.82 298.24 A: and it makes you look like you went on a vacation 

297.69 310.22 B: it well no it makes you look better when you look better you feel better but i think there's something to do with the light therapy there because we're spending so much time in darkness if you're going to a tanning bed 

302.27 303.86 A: (( right )) 

310.09 316.61 B: you're exposing yourself to that extra amount of light and i think it does do something 

316.83 319.88 B: i've i i've heard other people say that 

319.26 324.73 A: really i've never heard anyone say that so i've kind of intrigued right [laughter] now by that 

322.98 331.08 B: yes well it's a thought well you know they do treat people that are suffering from mild forms of depression with light therapy 

330.96 331.97 A: (( oh )) 

332.42 339.31 A: see i'm kind of i don't know i have never really gone like to a tanning bed just 'cause i don't know how safe it is 

339.05 345.19 B: i don't know how safe it is either but i just figured i didn't have anything to lose so i went [laughter] 

343.97 345.30 A: (( so there you go )) 

345.39 349.35 B: i went it's last year was the first year i ever went 

345.65 346.50 A: [laughter] 

349.39 355.06 B: uh because i was like you i i didn't know what the long term effect of it would be 

355.17 357.38 B: (( and uh i don't know it's just )) 

356.40 361.58 A: and you felt like it made you feel better just in general like heightened your spirits 

359.05 360.50 B: absolute 

361.16 374.83 B: it did it really did and i didn't get a cold all winter long so i i really think that might of helped i'm not sure um i couldn't prove it but i do think there is something to be said for a little bit of light therapy 

374.66 380.47 B: because it did make me feel better and i don't think it was the fact that i didn't really even get a tan i just felt better 

380.74 386.30 B: i think it was the exposure to the extra light at the bad ti- like january february you know you come home 

386.36 389.71 B: in the evening it's dark at five o'clock six o'clock 

389.19 391.18 A: (( right right )) 

390.13 402.17 B: you leave to go to work and it's dark so people do get depressed and i know not tanning beds but they do use some various forms of light therapy for people that are depressed 

402.92 405.87 B: it seemed to work for me [laughter] and i told 

404.96 407.87 A: you think it it kept you not sick 

407.64 410.02 B: i i do in a way 

410.25 418.29 B: er i can't figure out why else everybody that i worked with had a cold and and i didn't and that's the only thing i did that they didn't do 

414.43 415.08 A: (( uh-huh )) 

418.39 423.37 B: so i don't know it's it's a thought [laughter] and maybe we should all go to tanning beds 

423.50 424.48 B: [laughter] 

424.19 431.88 A: see where i work everyone was sick this winter like obvious you know for obvious reasons but everyone was sick 

427.42 428.41 B: mhm 

431.42 435.47 B: me too everyone and it lasted it went on and on and on 

435.50 436.70 A: right 

435.65 442.27 B: and i was never around so many people that were happen hawk hacking and coughing and sneezing 

441.00 442.20 A: [laughter] 

442.28 444.64 B: it would it would just go on and on and on 

444.87 448.54 A: but now you get that for um like allergies and stuff 

448.55 458.40 B: no this was just like winter colds and i guess if one person gets it in a workforce especially when you're in closed quarters like that 

457.86 459.69 A: yeah 

458.79 462.87 B: everybody gets it but i didn't get it everybody else did but me 

462.61 464.32 A: oh i got it [laughter] 

463.69 467.31 B: oh did you and how long how long did it last 

464.84 465.98 A: yeah 

466.79 474.06 A: um well i was out for two days but i'm the type of person like if i'm dying sick i won't take off 

473.46 475.52 B: you still go to work 

475.21 481.40 A: yeah like i'll i'll still go into work i have to basically be like unable to move to work 

480.40 484.31 B: mm well that's good i bet your employers are happy 

484.47 485.36 A: (( uh )) 

485.91 488.74 A: if they notice i don't know if they notice [laughter] 

488.01 492.17 B: [laughter] well they should by your attempt at 

491.17 493.34 A: it's one of those kinds of things 

493.10 496.28 B: oh i know but it well 

496.48 506.69 B: i i don't know what it takes for an employee to notice uh an employer to notice uh a good work record except for the fact that you're there all the time and then they're gonna to take it for granted 

504.75 506.12 A: [laughter] 

506.95 510.82 B: and yet other people miss all the time and nobody says anything 

510.34 512.29 A: i know oh i agree 

512.02 515.02 B: yeah i guess it's the same everywhere 

512.95 513.96 A: (( what do )) 

515.27 522.33 B: it really is well do you have any other thoughts as to ways we could prevent uh getting a cold 

515.50 516.48 A: right 

522.56 523.67 A: um 

525.57 534.48 A: i wore layers all winter and i still got i don't i really i think it's unpreventable 'cause either way you're going to be surrounded by people 

527.99 528.83 B: (( mm )) 

534.23 538.05 B: i i kind of agree i kind of agree 

534.73 536.30 A: (( who are very sick )) 

537.90 541.83 A: as long as you get sleep you know that's important 

540.14 541.79 B: the right rest 

541.85 543.56 B: watch your diet 

543.79 549.17 B: of course we're all good at that [laughter] but uh 

545.74 547.09 A: [laughter] 

548.32 554.99 A: yeah i would definitely say getting rest fluids like all that kind of stuff but who even knows with that you know 

552.69 553.61 B: right 

555.30 556.31 B: uh 

555.31 556.74 A: what really helps 

556.48 567.18 B: i think mo- more people are conscientious of flus and colds now because of all the weird ones like the flu strains that are going around 

566.98 568.99 A: right 

567.74 571.28 B: and we have that terrible thing going on now that uh 

571.15 572.20 A: (( sars )) 

571.73 574.22 B: yes the sars thing 

572.68 573.55 A: [laughter] 

574.40 577.30 B: and uh that's terrible 

577.42 580.55 B: and it's going to affect a lot of people 

580.78 583.77 B: uh they're working on 

581.07 582.46 A: yeah 

584.15 585.59 B: some sort of a 

585.65 588.96 B: vaccine or something for it some kind of a shot for it 

588.77 589.91 A: oh really 

589.57 593.42 B: i think they're come i think they're coming close to it i hope it's soon 

593.88 597.42 B: because it must be highly contagious 

598.21 599.32 B: yeah 

599.16 599.89 A: (( yeah i don't ))
