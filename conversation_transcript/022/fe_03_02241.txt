0.95 2.17 A: (( hello )) 

1.81 3.14 B: hi 

2.82 5.35 A: hi my name is logan 

5.08 6.50 B: hi i'm rena 

6.07 7.52 A: (( hi rena how are you doing )) 

7.18 8.72 B: good how are you 

8.27 9.65 A: good thank you 

10.25 15.57 A: so illness ah i actually don't get sick when the seasons change i rarely get sick 

15.53 28.76 B: yeah i'm very lucky that way too i take a lot of vitamins apparently it works [laughter] sometimes a little cold you know aft- when weather changes drastically you know 

21.18 22.67 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

23.67 24.55 A: right 

26.30 27.23 A: right 

28.04 29.08 A: right right 

29.54 37.16 A: um i don't know i think i think of it is also psychosomatic i think people expect to get the flu or expect to get cold a cold or 

32.89 34.11 B: (( right )) 

36.54 41.49 B: yeah because that's all you hear did you get the flu shot and so it's in your head [laughter] 

39.21 40.43 A: right 

41.37 43.43 A: i actually haven't had a flu shot 

44.04 45.63 A: in about twelve years 

45.93 46.88 A: um 

46.11 51.42 B: oh gosh i haven't had one since i was a kid which was many many more years ago 

49.43 51.12 A: (( since i left college )) 

51.65 55.12 A: until it it was last mandated [laughter] 

51.67 52.43 B: [laughter] 

54.29 56.31 B: right right [laughter] 

55.27 60.16 A: yeah and so i think that has a lot to do with it i think people who do actually get the flu shot tend to get sick 

60.42 64.20 B: yeah and i don't i don't get the shot 

61.23 62.65 A: at least a lot of 

63.94 66.42 A: mhm so that's something i've found 

65.80 69.48 B: and if i get sick it's usually for twenty four hours and that's it 

68.84 72.25 A: right right yeah something you eat [laughter] 

71.66 72.67 B: [laughter] 

72.31 77.19 A: um i actually do agree with the seven day ah thing about getting a cold 

77.30 82.07 A: um if it you know it'll only last for a few days but if you go to a doctor it'll last longer 

83.11 93.10 A: um i found that that when i have gotten sick if it's like something fluish it's usually three days up and three days down so after three days it's at the very worst 

92.71 93.70 B: right 

93.17 95.58 A: and three days of recuperating and then you're done 

96.82 99.22 B: right right yeah yeah 

99.50 100.71 B: that's true 

100.78 101.65 B: [laughter] 

101.72 108.95 A: so so i don't know i think a lot of my friends friends that i know tend to run to the doctor every time they get sick and i think that kind of makes it worse 

109.88 112.46 B: i don't have the time to run to the doctor 

111.37 115.14 A: [laughter] 

112.62 118.68 B: [laughter] unless i absolutely have to i just dose myself [laughter] 

116.10 117.74 A: yeah exactly 

118.49 126.44 A: yeah yeah i i think maybe some people i mean it's funny 'cause you know you turn on the t._v. and ah every other commercial's for a prescription drug 

126.50 127.57 B: i know 

127.01 128.81 A: and it didn't used to be that way 

128.45 129.24 B: no 

129.34 130.22 B: no 

129.61 132.36 A: now heartburn is a disease [laughter] 

131.99 134.30 B: right [laughter] 

134.12 136.85 A: all these really mundane things are now diseases 

136.24 137.36 B: [laughter] 

137.23 142.59 A: um so i think people are kind of playing into that which doesn't really help your body heal naturally mhm 

142.38 143.32 B: no 

143.41 146.17 B: no i just take my vitamins 

146.69 147.71 B: [laughter] 

147.25 149.14 A: well what kind of climate are you in 

149.25 150.68 B: i'm in california 

150.23 153.24 A: oh okay so it it's some- somewhat temperate 

153.73 155.58 B: yeah where are you 

154.31 155.09 A: yeah 

155.23 156.49 A: i'm in new york 

156.58 159.53 B: oh i was born and raised in new york brooklyn 

159.19 161.25 A: that's funny yeah manhattan 

160.06 161.13 B: [laughter] 

162.30 163.28 A: so 

162.60 170.25 B: so yeah we had a really strange ah change it was cold and then sunday morning 

167.49 168.76 A: mhm 

170.50 175.58 B: i was washing the floor and i felt so hot and it was it was like ninety degrees out 

174.96 176.39 A: wow yeah 

175.73 180.65 B: and now it's cold again so we have the real drastic changes 

177.01 177.91 A: yeah 

180.09 184.40 A: yeah we've had some similar changes so i think that might also be affecting people i don't know 

182.47 183.64 B: [laughter] 

184.74 186.00 A: um but 

185.35 192.27 B: yeah it it's hard not to get sick because of the way you dress you don't expect you know such a drastic change 

189.31 190.11 A: true 

190.45 191.23 A: yeah 

192.38 197.58 A: what i find i wash my hands a lot and i think that also makes a difference you know tra- travelling on the subway 

198.06 203.06 A: i find that if you're not if you're not careful that way you know you can probably pick up a lot of stuff but um 

198.23 200.23 B: right [laughter] 

202.16 203.28 B: sure 

203.40 205.05 A: i don't know i think ah 

205.17 207.27 A: for the most part pretty healthy 

207.81 208.88 B: yeah 

208.88 213.77 A: i don't know what ev- everybody else is doing [laughter] that makes them unhealthy but 

211.46 212.37 B: (( i )) 

214.82 216.08 A: (( i think )) 

215.00 218.03 B: used to have allergies really bad but 

216.77 217.78 A: (( oh )) 

218.87 220.26 B: not good 

220.00 221.58 A: yeah exactly 

221.71 223.33 A: um and i've actually never 

221.91 229.18 B: you know maybe a little here and there you know but if there's somebody's strong perfume or something you know [laughter] 

224.25 225.87 A: right mhm 

229.67 230.69 A: interesting 

230.82 235.72 B: but ah weather wise no i- i've been very fortunate 

235.36 236.22 A: yeah 

235.94 237.90 B: just this past year i think 

238.06 243.38 B: just i have two jobs morning and afternoon and i just had to miss an afternoon job [laughter] 

243.09 244.13 A: oh 

243.74 246.22 B: to knock it out of me that was it done 

245.37 246.79 A: right right 

246.86 252.41 B: and you know other people oh gosh they miss like you know two three days maybe a week 

252.10 253.01 A: wow 

253.89 255.62 A: yeah i don't know i um 

255.77 256.82 A: i mean i've 

257.23 261.57 A: i tend not to work when i'm sick but then again since i rarely get sick 

259.44 260.26 B: (( ah huh )) 

261.67 262.54 A: (( it's )) 

261.95 263.16 B: [laughter] 

262.91 268.10 A: not it's usually not a big deal but ah and i'm lucky in that i i'm self employed 

268.21 273.24 A: so if i need to take a few hours off i can just lay down and not worry about it too bad 

272.96 274.46 B: right right 

273.77 275.50 A: um but a 

275.84 281.07 A: yeah i don't know i think i think getting sleep is also a factor and not getting sleep 

280.89 281.79 B: right 

281.54 290.37 A: um and your environment and you know whether you you convince yourself or not that you have to get sick that year [laughter] i think that may play a part 

290.99 292.07 B: yeah 

293.36 301.67 B: i agree with you [laughter] you hear people oh now i'm going to get sick and sure enough a few days later [laughter] 

294.88 296.40 A: mhm 

298.31 300.23 A: (( oh yeah )) 

300.79 303.01 A: they get sick [laughter] 

302.38 303.55 B: (( oh )) 

303.21 313.09 A: someone says oh man you don't look well and i'm thinking i don't look well yeah you feeling okay and you know maybe we're feeling fine maybe just a little tired and next thing you know oh god i don't feel good [laughter] 

310.07 311.65 B: [laughter] 

312.34 313.95 B: [laughter] 

313.52 320.80 A: so i think there there's a lot to that um and you know i think if you go to the doctors it doesn't really make that aspect any better 

321.18 322.18 A: [laughter] 

321.38 322.40 B: no 

322.52 326.26 B: no i us- usually just one dose of nyquil 

325.85 327.22 A: mhm 

326.62 328.75 B: does it and for ah 

329.46 333.03 B: you know when you get the you know when your throat hurts when you swallow 

332.60 333.98 A: (( right )) 

333.06 339.34 B: i have tried chloroseptic and and gargling with the salt water the only thing that works is aspragum 

336.78 337.74 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

339.27 340.45 A: really interesting 

339.82 342.16 B: and that knocks it right out yeah 

341.58 344.80 A: you know i also ah make this drink called um 

345.23 346.61 A: (( oh honegar )) 

346.96 352.94 A: which is um like fresh water like either distilled or bottled water or filtered um 

350.31 351.10 B: (( ah huh )) 

353.15 356.27 A: apple cider vinegar raw like from the health food store 

356.48 359.29 A: and ah really good organic honey 

359.70 365.86 A: and you make the you make the water and you take like a glass of water you add enough vinegar in to make it undrinkable 

365.91 368.35 A: and then you add enough honey to make it drinkable 

368.32 369.66 B: oh 

368.96 371.32 A: and it's ver- it's antibacterial 

371.44 372.64 B: oh 

371.64 375.82 A: and it works really well especially for sore throats or anything like that 

376.83 382.39 A: yeah colds i find i take that and it pretty much helps me clear out whatever i'm dealing with 

382.83 384.37 A: 'cause it's usually bacterial 

384.82 386.62 B: yeah yeah 

386.86 389.53 A: so plus i think it tastes good now [laughter] 

389.02 390.70 B: (( right [laughter] ))

457.91 463.69 B: right where else are you going to exactly i'm in the san fernando valley and 

463.87 466.82 B: we're gang infested here you know but 

466.04 470.01 A: oh yes so that's that'll do it especially if you have kids you don't really want 

469.26 476.31 B: but in vegas i mean you can get a a home for like a hundred and fifty that would be worth four fifty here easy 

476.16 477.67 A: oh yeah i was looking

488.87 492.17 A: if that was in new york oh my god [laughter]

500.51 503.75 A: that's brilliant wow i wish you the very best on that 

503.44 505.28 B: yeah 

504.56 512.52 A: great but yeah i don't know how much more can we talk about this topic [laughter] i mean we don't really have anything to disagree on [laughter] 

508.70 509.98 B: i know 

511.29 513.56 B: i think are they supposed to cut in 

513.31 518.88 A: they will they're going to give you a little they are going to cut us off let us know that we've got like thirty seconds to say goodbye 

513.90 514.97 B: after the 

518.96 522.11 A: and then even if we're in the middle of our goodbyes they'll cut us off again 

522.29 523.42 B: oh 

522.98 525.30 A: yeah it's pretty it's pretty to the minute 

525.08 526.94 B: [laughter] 

525.78 529.29 A: [laughter] but ah i don't know i think um 

529.83 535.83 A: i have a lot of disrespect unfortunately for the medical community ah because they're so money driven 

536.27 538.31 A: and they're so drug driven and 

536.53 537.98 B: yeah me too 

538.03 539.11 B: me too 

538.64 540.28 A: i think it really does 

540.52 546.21 A: the american people a serious disservice especially since we don't have you know unified health care across the board yeah 

545.56 550.34 B: and that's another issue the the health care i have to get a better 

550.26 554.28 B: i'm paying three hundred and fifteen a month which is outrageous 

553.83 554.82 A: oh yeah 

554.17 567.07 B: and as you well know when you go to a doctor and they see you have insurance they scare you because they're going to put you through the tests to get the money right meantime you're like why do i have to have the ultrasound what's wrong 

557.95 559.26 A: mhm 

562.08 563.14 A: exactly 

566.81 567.72 A: right 

567.01 570.56 B: and all it is is like you said they are making money 

570.18 583.94 A: right yeah it it's really not about unfortunately i mean maybe i don't want to say across the board i don't know every single doctor in the country but it seems to be you know again more of business and less of you know hippocratic oath which was you know let's take care of people 

583.80 585.22 B: right right 

584.14 589.85 A: that that's supposed to be the top priority and ah it doesn't seem to be anymore which is a real shame 

590.00 599.89 B: i have a really good doctor and he he was pretty much upfront about what he was doing at least so that i didn't have to you know 'cause one medical was ending 

597.58 598.26 A: right
