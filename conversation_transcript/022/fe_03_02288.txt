140.78 141.98 B: mhm 

141.72 147.98 A: so but but because that came out fairly recently right like a year or two ago would it be yeah 

146.12 148.20 B: yeah yeah 

148.54 149.40 A: (( well )) 

148.80 153.22 B: yeah 'cause mine were really bad at one time and i guess it was a change of something then

156.09 157.89 A: oh my god 

157.53 160.82 B: flenaise and i took it for it didn't help for like a week 

161.28 164.88 B: it took like a week or like a week a week and a half to get into your system 

164.48 165.84 A: and then it kicks in

169.47 170.30 A: i guess 

170.94 175.63 A: the seasons changing this year was so quickly as i guess has made some people sick

191.46 193.72 B: air that's the way it was here yep 

193.70 196.02 A: yeah so i guess it's pretty much the same weather

225.30 227.09 B: yeah 

226.35 227.14 A: 'cause 

227.27 235.37 A: i know allergies can be so bad and it's the worst feeling 'cause it's not horrible but it's horrible enough to make you uncomfortable all the time
