138.17 150.72 A: it works for my allergies like i take benadryl i i sometimes i have zirtec which is prescription i haven't taken it in a while 'cause i don't have a prescription renewal on it but that that works good 

148.52 149.50 B: (( see that's )) 

149.89 152.56 B: i think uh i think that's what i have too 

153.37 157.52 B: now let's see what do i have i think i have zirtec 

153.50 154.21 A: (( zir- )) 

158.76 163.72 B: (( oh oh is this zirtec i'm trying to figure out um ))

173.03 173.70 A: (( mm )) 

174.78 176.82 A: yes it does 

176.58 189.24 B: and and and i go i go to bed 'cause uh the doctor told me take it at night 'cause before i got sick and since i have asthma i usually take it in the and i was having a hard time breathing so 

189.28 191.43 B: they gave me zirtec right 

191.90 194.05 B: and i wake up in the morning 

194.64 198.29 B: and it's like oh my head is pounding 

196.19 197.93 A: mhm 

198.55 206.97 A: see i just i get that if i don't have um if i don't have coffee i get headache all the time 

203.69 204.66 B: yeah i 

206.55 210.89 B: yes see because you're you're getting addicted to caffeine mhm 

210.32 217.63 A: it's the only it's the i usually eat organic foods and stuff and that's the only really bad thing that i 

217.74 227.26 A: that i put into my body are is nicotine and caffeine i'm terrible at it it counteracts everything that i do to be good to be healthy 

225.96 231.89 B: yeah it do now question when you eat organic food doesn't that help you out with your cold 

231.33 242.61 A: it does i have not gotten sick all semester until now i think it's just because i'm stressed emotionally and i'm stressed school wise that i'm starting to get maybe a little bit sick 

241.18 248.62 B: yeah and i heard about that too 'cause when you're stressed your system it it breaks down 

248.97 250.74 B: because you know 

250.49 257.57 A: mhm and no sleep if you don't get sleep um then you're more susceptible because that's when your body regenerates itself 

257.51 258.84 B: (( true yeah )) 

257.69 265.37 A: so and i didn't go to bed until five o'clock this morning and i woke up at eight o'clock this morning and i haven't gone to bed yet so

277.11 287.25 A: during my one final but the other one i got to eat lunch right i like rushed to get lunch and so um you know if you eat breakfast then you're supposed to be better at 

287.64 289.72 A: school stuff in the morning i guess 

288.69 290.16 B: mhm 

289.92 290.71 A: so 

290.54 298.67 B: mm see i i'm a good morning person but lately once i take the zirtec and then it comes time to wake up it's like i'm dragging

304.10 310.24 A: um it made me a little bit drowsy it said it wasn't supposed to but um 

311.10 313.64 A: it made me a bit drowsy and 

313.72 317.15 A: this is really odd but i had problems with my blood 

317.31 331.15 A: uh when i was taking it it would make my blood sugar be more not it wouldn't rise and fall um so much but it'd be more sensitive like if i took the zirtec it would be much more sensitive to what food i ate or um 

331.73 339.94 A: you know the medicines i had or if i was ill it'd be it would i'd have to really watch my blood sugar it'd be a lot
