77.23 78.19 A: (( yeah right )) 

79.52 83.62 B: then in the spring i'm not sure if that's flu season or what but

84.29 85.31 A: yeah right 

88.05 89.88 A: right 

90.10 92.08 A: yep yeah 

92.64 94.06 A: (( i don't know um )) 

95.19 99.17 A: i don't know if they're really considering they're considering allergies to be 

99.40 101.55 A: ill that's just more of a 

101.76 104.22 A: affliction [laughter] 

102.06 103.32 B: yeah 

103.46 107.39 B: yeah it is a nuisance but that's a good point um 

106.25 107.08 A: yeah 

107.24 108.24 A: spring 

108.56 109.67 B: yeah 

109.95 114.71 B: um i'm not sure about the seven days was something about 

114.32 119.07 A: yeah they say a cold lasts seven days i don't know um 

115.66 116.58 B: (( i don't know )) 

116.74 117.77 B: yeah 

119.43 121.19 A: seems about right maybe 

122.96 125.67 A: depends on what you what you do about it you know 

123.01 124.07 B: (( [noise] okay )) 

126.26 127.67 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

127.22 130.80 A: but i i i do find truth to you know 

132.07 137.85 A: the way they said going to the doctor really doesn't doesn't help 'cause you know it's gotta run its course right 

134.49 135.16 B: (( [noise] )) 

137.54 145.21 B: that's true yeah um they can doctors can only do so much and sometimes it's not anything they can do you know 

138.98 139.78 A: i mean 

144.41 148.51 A: right especially for a common cold 

148.16 149.45 B: right yeah 

148.61 152.63 A: they can adjust the symptoms you know but it's probably not a lot more than 

152.73 153.59 A: (( ah )) 

153.95 160.46 A: they probably can't do a lot more than you can do on your own just ah you know going to the drugstore and getting some over the counter cold medicine you know unless it's 

160.44 162.08 B: that's true yes 

163.17 167.45 A: unless it's drastic they could prescribe stronger stuff but 

167.57 169.11 B: yeah 

168.08 168.94 A: (( you know )) 

169.50 176.26 B: yeah i think there is a problem with um the over prescription of um antibiotics apparently some people 

176.37 179.16 B: are resistant now or something you know the 

179.21 182.19 B: they didn't really need antibiotics or something like that 

181.70 183.02 A: really 

182.79 187.38 B: um and i'm not sure what the whole story is but um 

186.95 188.03 A: right 

187.42 189.29 B: i've heard a little bit about that [noise] 

189.21 190.13 A: huh 

190.93 191.87 A: well it's 

191.30 191.86 B: (( ah )) 

192.82 195.65 A: yeah i guess they you build up an immunity to 'em 

195.38 197.54 B: sure yeah 

196.55 198.46 A: right like anything 

200.23 201.04 A: it's just 

200.44 201.12 B: (( [noise] ah )) 

201.76 204.74 A: yeah i just i'm just recently moved to ah 

204.91 207.07 A: los angeles area in california 

206.98 208.20 B: okay 

207.77 209.55 A: yeah and ah 

209.76 210.57 A: so 

210.91 213.66 A: i've gotten sick twice since i've been here in like ah 

214.56 216.81 A: um back in [sigh] 

217.42 228.24 A: what was it a._h. november i got sick i got really sick it was like probably the worst it had ever been it was just a nasty flu type thing 

220.52 221.22 B: yes 

227.86 229.33 B: oh yeah 

228.61 230.81 A: yeah it was really bad and ah 

231.87 234.16 A: but you know been fine ever since you know 

234.30 239.34 B: do you think it was seas- even though the seasons don't change much [laughter] in southern california 

238.16 245.57 A: yeah that was the that was the weird thing you know i mean i wonder if sometime you know the body has an internal clock type thing 

245.66 247.14 A: and um 

247.26 250.77 A: you know maybe from years of growing up in new york where you know 

250.84 251.51 B: (( ah )) 

251.21 264.71 A: it's almost a subconscious thing where okay it's november it's time to get sick you know without ever even thinking it it's just the body's internal clock after you know thirty two years of training you know [laughter] i don't know but either way i mean 

259.13 260.45 B: mhm 

262.18 263.97 B: right yeah mhm 

264.80 269.44 A: um it wasn't particularly cold you know not compared to what i was used to you know 

269.40 270.67 B: mhm 

269.65 276.76 A: digging my car outta the snow in november and here i am in southern california and i still got sick in november [laughter] 

276.44 278.38 B: [laughter] yeah that is funny 

277.89 278.98 A: yeah 

278.73 282.31 B: the we've usually associated you know with snow and everything but mm 

281.87 285.37 A: right yeah so i don't know it's weird 

285.21 286.66 B: (( yeah that is weird )) 

286.63 287.37 A: (( yeah )) 

286.78 294.39 B: you know is just on this topic i heard um like one study say that it wasn't so much the cold like the snow 

293.99 295.04 A: right 

294.40 299.58 B: that made people ill but staying indoors and i don't know if i believe that i don't think that's 

298.48 299.39 A: really 

299.72 303.37 B: yeah apparently if you stay indoors i 

303.68 308.51 B: don't know if it's indoor air or just being around the same people more or something 

308.87 311.30 B: it's more likely um 

310.21 311.71 A: (( yeah yes )) 

311.33 313.41 B: that you'll get a cold but 

313.03 315.18 A: well i could i could imagine that um 

315.30 328.21 A: you know being around people that are potentially you know sick or could pass stuff on definitely and also ah you know breathing stagnant air if you don't have good circulation but i think a lot of it has to do with 

326.47 327.74 B: right 

328.73 334.46 A: exercise you know if you're ah if you're somewhat stagnant and not getting a lot of exercise 

334.47 341.85 A: you know there's not gonna be your heart's not gonna be beating as fast there's not gonna be as much blood going through and you and your immune system's not gonna be working and it's 

342.23 344.59 A: you know as efficiently as it could be and also 

344.76 349.14 A: then if you're outside doing a lot of errands and running around and doing stuff you know 

348.66 349.66 B: right 

349.17 358.13 A: you that'll be better but at the same time the cold brings the the body's temperature down which also lowers the immune system i think to 

357.66 359.56 B: that's true yeah 

358.61 371.40 A: so it's kind of a catch twenty two i think that's why a lot of people get sick 'cause it's kinda hard to avoid if you could just manage to stay indoors and stay active then ah you'll probably be better off i don't know [laughter] interesting though yeah mhm 

365.40 366.11 B: mhm 

369.75 370.54 B: (( no )) 

370.59 378.00 B: that's yeah that is interesting um i don't know yeah i i think it is true though people 

378.73 387.46 B: who exercise outdoors even when it is cold are probably healthier than people who just stay indoors because it's cold yeah 

383.17 384.00 A: yeah 

386.49 388.18 A: right yeah 

387.88 388.76 B: yeah 

388.54 389.78 A: yeah i'm sure 

391.12 395.76 A: i remember growing up my mother always would yell at me for fooling around with you know bare feet 

395.85 396.92 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

396.43 403.14 A: and ah 'cause we had you know different rooms would either be hardwood floors or ceramic tile or whatever and 

402.78 403.83 B: yeah 

403.55 413.67 A: you know we wouldn't keep the house cold per se but just knowing that it was cold outside and you know the the floors would be a little bit cooler and ah you know 

414.00 418.25 A: she would say running around with bare feet you're gonna get sick and [laughter] 

417.58 419.38 B: right yeah 

418.67 420.48 A: and that really you know 

420.72 428.95 A: or she would say you know you go outside you know come on in put a jacket on you're you know you're gonna get sick 'cause it's cold outside if you don't have a jacket on and it's like 

429.03 436.15 A: well you know doesn't really hold a lot of truth other than the fact that when your body temperature is low it you know 

435.69 436.68 B: mhm 

436.44 439.80 A: it decreases it yeah immune system you 

440.39 442.22 B: sure yeah 

441.59 443.84 A: (( know but you know it's kinda mm )) 

444.03 449.04 B: mhm but if you're active you raise your body temperature right i mean you mm 

447.69 449.05 A: right yeah 

449.05 451.20 B: it helps your immune system that way 

450.85 452.24 A: exactly yeah 

451.51 452.07 B: (( [cough] )) 

452.42 454.72 A: and wearing a hat too i think 

454.43 455.76 B: mhm 

454.82 461.75 A: lotta they say most of the body's heat escapes through the head up your head when it's real cold out 

459.00 460.50 B: yeah 

461.45 466.53 B: i think that's really true i've i've experienced that wearing a hat is is really helpful 

464.12 464.95 A: yeah 

466.23 468.50 A: yeah definitely we always used to 

468.73 480.67 A: we'd have our hats on when we were running out playing some ball in the snow or whatever and then we would all take our you know our snow our ski hats or whatever we would take we'd all take 'em off and [laughter] all our heads would be steaming [laughter] 

475.66 477.13 B: mhm 

479.76 482.64 B: [laughter] it's true yeah 

482.23 496.55 A: there was no i remember one time we did that and then we all lined up we took a picture of all our heads up like we were all smoking 'cause the [laughter] our body temperature was like you know a hundred and whatever degrees from playing football but it was like you know ten degrees outside so 

488.64 490.47 B: [laughter] 

496.59 498.95 A: we took the we'd take our hats off and 

496.66 497.67 B: right 

498.97 501.91 A: get in a line and you know all our heads would be 

502.22 504.78 A: steaming and it was pretty hilarious took a picture 

504.09 505.15 B: yeah 

504.89 507.39 A: [laughter] 

506.58 507.93 B: that is funny 

508.20 516.00 A: yeah but ah yeah i spent a lot of time in florida too and then it was i always would get 

513.13 513.76 B: (( oh )) 

516.28 520.93 A: [sigh] you know get ill during the spring and the summer from all the pollen 

520.04 520.97 B: mhm 

521.27 522.93 B: oh yeah 

522.31 527.30 A: but i don't know if that's really considered illness per se i guess it is i guess 

528.20 530.67 A: (( you know i don't know allergies )) 

530.04 539.26 B: yeah i lived in michigan for a while and had a very similar problem um that's where i first discovered i had allergies to um grass 

539.35 546.63 B: and ah certain seeds and things like that exactly yeah where i live i live near a 

539.82 540.60 A: right 

541.94 542.87 A: really 

546.64 548.55 B: area and um 

547.66 548.37 A: (( ah )) 

548.76 552.85 B: apparently that really was affecting me and i didn't know 

552.95 553.77 A: right 

553.06 553.99 B: um 

554.19 558.54 B: that's what it was but it felt like kinda like a cold or flu you know 

557.87 559.12 A: right 

558.58 563.11 B: but it was allergies it was allergies 'cause when i when i took the medication 

560.65 561.52 A: wow 

563.12 566.45 B: i mean the allergy pills it definitely helped 

563.12 564.02 A: right 

566.29 567.11 A: really 

566.46 568.64 B: then i didn't have the same problem you know 

568.69 569.35 A: (( mm )) 

569.39 577.83 A: yeah i was allergic to um fresh cut grass and hay and that type of thing i remember i remember when ah 

573.40 574.79 B: yeah 

575.86 576.99 B: (( yeah )) 

579.16 586.51 A: when the first time i got i realized i had bad allergies i woke up and i couldn't open my eyes 'cause ah my eyes were ah 

584.45 585.55 B: sure 

586.97 587.94 A: were ah 

588.37 599.89 A: you know having a reaction overnight while i slept and then i i guess that had got 'em stuck together when i woke up i i thought my older brother you know like plays tricks i thought maybe he 

595.08 596.39 B: yeah
