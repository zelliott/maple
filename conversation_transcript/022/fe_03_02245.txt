204.97 211.67 B: you know it kind a looked like everything was almost invisible because everything glared you know it was like a ice coating over everything 

208.73 209.50 A: mm 

211.37 212.54 A: mhm 

211.89 213.92 B: (( you know it was kind a neat [laughter] ))

214.50 215.08 B: (( [cough] )) 

219.91 221.29 B: yeah yeah 

221.30 230.16 B: yeah it's cool looking it's not a lot of fun but 'cause it takes down weak tree branches and weak um electrical wires and 

224.01 225.17 A: yeah 

230.24 239.18 B: you know all that kind of stuff people were without electricity mostly the east side of grande rapids i live in grand rapids was was out we didn't get it thank god you know 

238.94 239.67 A: (( mm )) 

239.39 244.01 B: 'cause those people that lost lost electricity and stuff they had to go all weekend 

243.58 244.47 A: oh wow 

244.06 246.36 B: without it [laughter] 

244.92 245.63 A: (( hm )) 

246.29 249.65 A: do the are the winters like very severe where you are or are they not so bad 

248.78 253.45 B: they they fluctuate um i'd say the past three years have been really mild 

253.10 253.85 A: mm 

253.54 265.42 B: you know so far as winter goes not a whole lotta you know heavy snow banks and stuff like that it did come and it'd melt and come and melt and then you know we'd get five to ten inches and that would be pretty much it all winter 

265.67 268.83 B: but we've had some winters you know you just get snowed in 

268.71 269.53 A: mm 

269.12 273.61 B: but we haven't had a we haven't had a bad winter like that probably in since the seventies 

273.31 274.01 A: hm 

274.48 276.46 A: yeah see here in new york we had 

275.44 277.69 B: yay for global warming huh 

277.12 281.37 A: oh yeah [laughter] this whole global warming thing this is changing everything but ah 

277.70 279.27 B: [laughter] 

281.53 290.26 A: for a couple i mean for a couple seasons in new york we had pretty mild ah winters and all of a sudden this winter we got like you know the big s- we got like one of the biggest snowstorms ever and 

288.00 288.89 B: yeah 

289.49 292.42 B: yeah i remember i remember hearing about it on t._v. 

291.98 295.83 A: yeah so i guess we were we were due for a bad ah winter but 

294.99 299.14 B: that's what i figured i figured we were gonna get a bad one too but we didn't 

298.78 302.98 A: yeah it's just like it was like the winter that didn't wanna leave you know 'til it becomes 

302.83 314.88 A: then then it's like it's thirty and then the next day all of a sudden it's summer it's like ninety you know that's that's that's kind of like what it is in new york like one day all of sudden out of nowhere summer's come and we usually have a very short springtime it's not a long springtime usually a month 

307.11 308.34 B: (( yeah )) 

313.58 314.86 B: yeah us too 

314.95 315.81 A: so 

315.63 316.58 B: yeah 

315.85 321.63 A: yeah i guess that it's similar i think ah it's similar where you are to new york it's kind of a similar climate so 

320.27 321.09 B: yeah 

322.09 323.23 A: (( but ah )) 

323.62 325.94 A: yeah so um that's 

326.09 335.96 A: though i mean we have four sea- you know just like everyone you know we have four seasons but it just the winters always seem really long and the spring is really short and the summer's really short and it seems 

329.55 330.44 B: yeah 

334.46 342.81 B: you know when i was a kid it seemed like winter lasted forever and now that i'm older i'm forty three but now that i'm older it's just like it just slides by 

339.22 340.51 A: mhm 

342.49 343.27 A: mm 

342.83 350.36 B: you know it's just a few months and before you know it it's gone you know and i'm like i like this getting old thing you know [laughter] 

345.74 346.47 A: mm 

348.05 349.57 A: [laughter] 

349.66 353.55 A: and i guess it's different when you're a kid it's ah feels like it's longer 

352.51 361.78 B: yeah time lasts a lot longer you know when you have to wait an hour it seems like two days you know now an hour is like a second [laughter] 

354.63 355.63 A: yeah 

360.22 361.09 A: (( mm )) 

361.44 371.63 A: the only thing is like like you know when you're younger you sometimes you appreciate the winter 'cause you know they close the schools [laughter] that's the only good thing i you know you kind of like having a snow day and get to play in the snow 

366.80 368.07 B: oh yeah 

369.99 372.97 B: that's the favorite part of winter getting out of school 

372.53 378.54 A: yeah i mean for the kids you know they play in the snow and that kind of thing but for the adults it's a hassle having to clean off cars and that kind of thing 

377.86 379.50 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

378.76 383.59 A: that makes it kind of ah a hassle and ah we had a lot of rain here too it seems like 

383.21 384.27 B: oh do ya 

383.82 388.12 A: to me it seems like every every weekend it was always they always predict rain here 

388.20 396.53 A: and you know i mean i'm sure it's worse than like i i think chicago probably has a worse winter than new york but it always feels like new york has some of the worst winters you know 

388.98 390.01 B: (( and also )) 

395.69 397.04 B: yeah 

396.57 409.43 A: some like the most chilly and hard to bear winters but also i you know in we had like some pretty bad snowstorms in the seventies and somehow the seventies i guess was a bad time for a snowstorms everywhere they had pretty bad snowstorms but ah 

406.58 407.82 B: yeah 

408.65 415.62 B: yeah i think it was seventy seven or seventy eight when we had our last bad one i remember it 'cause i couldn't get the front door open 

415.28 416.58 A: mhm 

416.23 418.93 B: and when i did it was like knee high 

419.26 432.06 B: you know i'm five four so that's not real tall but it was knee high and then we had to get down to the corner store 'cause we had a two year old baby my sister my nephew he was only two so we had a get milk and stuff milk and bread 

431.07 431.70 A: (( mm )) 

432.19 437.64 B: stuff like that and i had a walk down to the store and there was no no snowplows out or anything 

437.74 442.63 B: so i thought well i'll walk in the middle of the street i got to the middle of the street it was all the way up to my thighs 

442.78 443.77 A: oh wow
