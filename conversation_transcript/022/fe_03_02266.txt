282.08 296.65 A: well you know what yeah um we get we hear about that a lot just because we have so many you know international travellers and a lot of people that do travel from asia and i guess canada it's really affecting ah toronto the toronto area as well but

295.08 296.09 B: mhm 

296.72 308.83 A: no when i was ah when i was sick for ah you know last month for that i really thought my goodness do i have this [laughter] i felt yeah i mean i had a fever i i seemed to have all the symptoms you know i went from

324.98 338.42 A: know but um yeah i it it it really has affected i think a lot of people out here although i don't think anybody has died from it but you know i i feel bad for business travellers and whatnot that's really scary 

338.03 340.36 B: have there been cases in california or not 

340.30 350.60 A: i well i i think so it it's certainly been diagnosed it's been um i know it's been diagnosed in los angeles county and orange county where um i work as well so 

347.41 348.03 B: (( hm )) 

350.60 356.10 A: yeah i mean we do we there's a high asian population out here too so 

354.96 356.01 B: mhm 

356.20 359.62 A: um yeah it's very scary and ah 

358.85 364.86 B: well i have a i used to work for an import company years ago and [cough] my boss went to 

365.04 370.76 B: china or hong kong four times a year and they're scheduled to go on a trip and be on a trip right now 

367.51 368.29 A: oh 

370.74 371.71 A: oh 

370.79 373.82 B: and the salesman that was going to go with him 

373.98 385.26 B: ah cancelled out he said i'm i'm not going you know because of that and then i don't know if the boss actually ended up going or not but i'm i'll find out tomorrow 'cause i'm having lunch with the gentleman so [laughter] 

384.18 389.83 A: oh yeah well it's scary i don't blame him for not wanting to go i mean ah it it's 

385.32 386.16 B: (( yeah )) 

387.90 388.73 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

389.99 394.24 A: you know the symptoms are so serious i don't you know i don't think 

394.19 399.97 A: well i mean obviously there's been a lot of deaths from it i don't think it's fatal when you catch it but um 

399.90 413.25 A: i do remember i think the doctor who discovered it he um he was an italian doctor and i think he died from it but um yeah it's it is it's very scary and you see all these pictures in the news of people wearing their 

406.47 407.30 B: (( wow )) 

413.18 419.88 A: you know their masks the surgical masks and whatnot yeah i i if i lived out there i would be terrified 

415.02 416.08 B: mhm 

419.20 426.64 B: well i don't think i mean i it wouldn't be worth it to me to go and they say now that it's dying down in hong kong but going 

422.16 423.52 A: (( no it )) 

426.42 428.19 A: it's spreading other places 

427.51 430.23 B: spreading more in um china 

430.31 434.27 A: yeah well i think in hong kong they i think they finally 

431.00 431.91 B: (( so )) 

434.36 444.55 A: you know took some steps to prevent it from spreading um you know i and i think there's a big convention or something that goes on out there i'm sure they have a lot of conventions but um 

437.48 438.36 B: mhm 

444.58 453.14 A: um one that i guess they're well known for and there was talk of them actually cancelling that which you know was a big moneymaker for them so i don't know 

449.86 450.42 B: (( [noise] )) 

452.72 459.34 B: [noise] that could almost be what my boss goes to because he's it's an import ah it was an import business um 

455.46 457.75 A: maybe it's the same thing 

458.74 465.22 A: yes yes and um so i guess they were still having it but he chose not to go or you don't know if he went or not 

464.17 467.79 B: i don't know for sure if he went i know the the salesman that was going to go with him 

467.67 470.08 A: said no [laughter] 

468.13 469.89 B: but i'm not going 

470.07 471.92 B: so [noise] 

470.20 473.02 A: i know it is very very scary 

472.73 473.87 B: yeah 

473.52 474.74 A: (( mhm )) 

476.34 479.10 B: yeah so [laughter] 

476.81 486.00 A: what else [laughter] well do you notice that you get maybe more colds or sickness with the cold weather or or yeah 

484.22 488.21 B: oh yeah and i think it's because you're indoors all the time 

487.90 489.78 A: yeah and you don't have 

488.99 490.85 B: i mean that's what they say yeah 

490.09 494.16 A: the germs don't have a chance to escape maybe is that yeah 

492.42 498.54 B: yeah yeah that's what they say and i mean it really to get sick in the summer here is rare 

498.64 501.74 B: ah you know even to get a cold or anything but in the winter 

501.80 502.71 B: (( ah )) 

502.98 505.33 B: you know especially if you have a family get together 

505.23 505.98 A: (( mm )) 

505.42 508.76 B: there's always somebody that's got a cold or 

509.11 510.45 B: you know whatever 

509.29 519.31 A: yeah yeah i and i noticed um when i was in college i tended to get sick right at stress really played a a major factor in when i got sick 

518.93 519.84 B: mhm 

519.19 525.77 A: um you know after finals or or during a particularly stressful time even after the holidays i noticed that i'll 

521.48 522.30 B: mhm 

525.63 540.41 A: i'll usually get some sort of cold or sickness in january it seems to just kinda affect me that it once you know the holidays are over and then boom you know you have a chance to kinda catch up or take a deep breath and then it it hits ya then 

528.09 528.97 B: mhm 

529.33 530.11 B: yeah 

540.26 543.53 B: what is your temperature in ah like january and february 

543.09 552.54 A: well it it varies but ah it's prob- it's usually in in the sixties fifties or sixties which isn't too bad at all um yeah 

547.64 548.55 B: mhm 

549.99 550.73 B: (( no )) 

551.48 553.37 B: that's about what it is here right now 

553.08 554.29 A: oh really 

553.68 556.90 B: (( let me look at my thermometer fifty six )) 

556.50 562.78 A: [laughter] now see that would be considered a cold day out here [laughter] [laughter] oh but i 

556.97 558.11 B: [laughter] 

559.56 561.77 B: yeah [laughter] 

561.94 563.73 B: i've a sister in seattle 

563.88 565.55 B: and they have a lot of rain 

565.69 568.64 B: and and they kinda get the cold and that 

567.61 574.84 A: yeah i wonder if if rain affects it very much um that might i don't know maybe that has more to do with allergies 

573.01 575.57 B: you'd think that would clean the air though wouldn't ya 

575.19 576.48 A: yeah 

575.78 577.83 B: (( would rain clear the air i don't know )) 

577.02 583.62 A: [sigh] yeah you would think although um i i mean like i said i've got allergies and those are year round 

584.16 588.15 A: i certainly don't see them as being seasonal even though i i guess 

588.27 592.83 A: you know maybe i do get them more i seem to get 'em more in the fall than in the spring 

592.91 597.90 A: um yeah and less maybe in the winter and the summer i'm not sure why that is 

593.78 594.36 B: (( mhm )) 

597.81 599.95 B: they do say here that
