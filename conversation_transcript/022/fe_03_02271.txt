123.81 131.31 B: yeah i find the same thing i i work in an office situation and i we always think it's like the air conditioner or something you know that just kinda circulates the germs 

131.15 132.38 A: (( right right )) 

131.32 141.35 B: but ah i'm i guess you know in in general i um rarely get sick as well i know that they mentioned at the beginning of the call would i go to the doctor with a you know 

141.79 153.42 B: ah if something if i had an illness in or a cold or whatever after seven days and usually i don't you can pretty much determine how long it's gonna last by the symptoms you have nothing really really severe unless 

150.79 151.82 A: right 

153.25 157.73 B: some really weird flu comes coming through and everybody gets it 

157.52 165.10 A: and then you know if you've been pushing it like when you should be sleeping or staying home but no go out anyways right 

162.30 169.97 B: exactly you gotta know how to medicate yourself you know accordingly and a lotta times it's just a lot of rest and completely shutting down you know 

169.61 170.66 A: right 

170.26 171.40 B: so 

170.71 172.58 A: but how 'bout um

280.63 285.67 A: [lipsmack] and um it turned out that there was ah an ongoing infection 

285.70 288.64 A: and after the root canal i was 

289.13 303.56 A: swollen i was i had a fever i was laid up and i and i went to the back to the dentist on south bay and he immediately said you're going to the hospital [laughter] and it was a real bad infection and they had to um 

290.14 291.65 B: (( oh yeah )) 

291.73 292.82 B: mhm 

302.76 304.21 B: remove the tooth

364.57 365.69 B: oh my god 

370.39 371.34 B: uh-huh 

370.83 384.48 A: because ah being ah self employed business was real slow it was it was just you know it's starting so ah they paid the bill and ah i actually ended up on owing only seventeen hundred you know which is about ten percent 

383.83 386.16 B: and you were had good treatment
