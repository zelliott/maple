80.34 81.55 A: mhm 

83.32 89.77 A: oh it's nasty it's it's just like green pollen that just hangs on i mean it's everywhere 

87.09 88.33 B: (( i know )) 

89.64 100.46 B: she and i don't take her to the doctor because if you take her to the doctor they're going to tell you it's allergy related you know and once she's got real bad congestion from it 

100.86 102.23 B: then i take her 

102.02 103.27 A: (( [cough] right )) 

102.65 112.51 B: i myself i have asthma and when i i've got to watch what i take and plus when i do take something a lot of times it puts me to sleep 

112.14 116.77 A: yeah yeah you can't operate as a a mother with two children when you're taking 

112.86 113.64 B: (( so )) 

115.94 122.89 B: no i i can't even hardly take anything for mine any more because it puts me to sleep 

117.39 118.64 A: sleepy medicine 

122.22 123.48 A: mhm 

123.23 127.01 B: i just have to suffer through it and um 

125.18 126.32 A: right 

127.71 134.28 A: that's kinda hard to do when you can't breathe or when you shortness of breath and then running after two kids 

129.84 131.73 B: yeah 

132.36 134.10 B: (( yeah )) 

134.20 139.53 B: i just got over to my voice is still not back to normal but i just got over the part 

139.58 142.70 B: where i felt like i was totally breathing through a straw 

142.25 144.17 A: mhm mhm 

143.07 147.30 B: i still got the lump in my throat that stays there that won't go away 

147.02 148.08 A: right 

147.44 157.09 B: and occasionally i do take an over the counter medication and i just suffer the consequences of end up having to take a nap and [laughter] sleep it off 

154.51 157.81 A: yeah it's hard though it's hard 

157.18 159.35 B: it is and 

158.28 161.04 A: and i mean especially when the kids want your attention 

160.65 168.21 B: mhm and yeah sometime a question about um do you believe about the 

161.63 163.65 A: and it's like okay 

168.51 175.80 B: uh if you suffered out a cold last shorter than if you go to the doctor i kinda caught part of there 

175.17 185.93 A: oh yes i guess uh they want to know if is it better going to the doctor and getting medicine or is it just kinda you know like in the old days just tough it out and you know get by on your own remedy 

185.90 191.21 B: i think on some of it get by on your own remedy because a lot of times you go to the doctor 

188.41 190.24 A: (( yeah )) 

191.23 192.72 A: it's artificial 

191.29 192.21 B: and you 

192.53 199.62 B: you you run to the you run the risk of running into something else because the doctor's office is so full of 

196.52 197.39 A: mhm 

198.97 200.23 A: germs 

199.63 203.59 B: yeah my daughter used to get sick every time we went 

200.46 201.30 A: yep 

203.37 204.84 A: mhm 

204.21 210.55 B: and i i'd take her in there for a simple check up she'd come out with what everybody else had 

210.72 211.96 A: oh yeah 

211.34 214.46 B: and i had to switch to a smaller office so 

212.24 213.82 A: oh yeah that's been proven 

213.94 223.44 A: yeah that's been proven more as a matter of fact um when i took my kids to the doctor they used to have a a a well sick a well room and a sickness room 

222.89 224.88 B: mhm 

224.16 229.92 A: and if you were just for a check up you go to the well room and if you were sick you go to the sick room 

229.80 234.58 B: and a lot of people don't they don't they don't pay that any mind anyway 

233.60 236.77 A: no it's like they can't see or can't read 

236.18 242.55 B: yeah [laughter] but the um colds and stuff i feel like the season 

237.80 238.68 A: mhm 

242.81 246.69 B: this year's probably going to be one of the most difficult we've had 

242.88 243.66 A: (( i mean )) 

246.62 249.47 A: and some things they can't treat anyway so why go and pay 

250.21 259.66 A: get a doctor bill or forty fifty dollars to for them to say well you know we can't do anything for you you just have to kinda tough it out you know i run a humidifier 

256.41 257.37 B: yeah 

257.67 258.79 B: they give you 

259.70 260.74 A: every night 

260.88 261.90 B: (( mm okay )) 

261.92 264.45 A: and that really helps a lot 

264.18 269.98 B: i've got a air purifier in my house that that cuts out a lot yeah it helps me 

266.35 267.94 A: that helps a lot 

269.12 273.35 A: yeah you know it just you know change the filters out and 

270.05 271.03 B: but 

272.58 273.64 B: mhm 

274.24 276.26 A: um but it's um 

276.79 282.44 A: i think all that does i mean a lot of times i think we can you know do ourselves and keep the costs down 

282.12 286.71 B: yeah my husband says don't you want to come outside don't you want to go this one 

285.82 288.14 A: well we'd love to but we can't 

286.96 292.53 B: and i'm like no i i i really don't you know they here 

290.76 291.91 A: mhm 

292.04 293.56 A: yep 

292.72 294.38 B: (( and but )) 

294.58 298.59 B: you know you run the risk every time you walk out the door you've got 

298.07 302.13 A: well because you don't know what the uh the pollen count's gonna be 

301.60 303.18 B: yeah 

302.45 308.61 A: and if it's a heavy pollen count you're going to pay for it later on that evening or the you know the next day whatever 

305.12 306.21 B: mhm 

308.25 311.61 B: i've suffered a lot right here lately i mean i just 

311.64 314.56 B: usually from january right on 

314.21 315.63 A: (( mhm )) 

314.94 328.47 B: it's only during the winter months that a lot of people find theirselves sick in the winter i might have you know a little minor cold but a lot of times it starts in january 

319.92 321.18 A: right 

327.60 328.69 A: mhm 

328.56 332.07 B: and i just run off and on all through the summer 

331.58 332.66 A: right 

332.10 335.11 B: all through spring especially is the worst time 

333.82 337.04 A: mm yeah i think we share the same weather pat- pattern 

336.81 338.64 B: yeah and it's just 

337.31 346.25 A: 'cause i'm in i'm in knoxville and uh i mean it's like i i mean i'm like an hour away from smokey and we have major pollen 

347.43 361.06 B: i've i've got even to the point where i just i mine is so sensitive when it gets aggravated by the weather conditions if i go into a room where someone's smoking i have to immediately leave 'cause i can't handle it 

359.70 360.62 A: oh yeah 

360.79 362.29 A: oh yeah oh yeah 

361.37 362.84 B: i can't breathe 

362.41 373.57 A: oh yeah i know i don't i try to avoid all the the the restaurants that have smoking or i mean it it's just like when you come upon it you yo- it just kinda hits you like a brick 

367.32 368.06 B: (( mm )) 

368.75 370.45 B: (( yeah )) 

373.70 386.53 B: this this weather though i'm afraid i've already seen the the downside of the rain and everything yeah it's washing the pollen down some but it's bringing the mosquitos and and everything else 

374.55 375.34 A: so 

384.28 387.97 A: uh-huh and that's another issue you have to fight 

387.78 389.51 B: yep 

388.32 390.29 A: you had to worry about it 

390.06 403.21 B: yeah because there's so many viruses and stuff that that can be related to them that we have to deal with and they're especially bad around here i mean they will attack you in a heart beat 

391.74 393.23 A: mhm 

396.41 397.54 A: right 

402.91 406.42 A: oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah 

405.13 412.96 B: i joke with people and tell them that you either walk out my door and you fall in the mud hole if the mosquitos don't pick you up and carry you off first 

411.87 414.43 A: oh yeah oh yeah [laughter] 

413.33 418.84 B: you got the choice the mosquitos are gonna air lift you or you're gonna fall in the mud hole 

414.44 416.08 A: mhm 

418.54 420.12 A: (( oh yeah )) 

419.06 422.89 B: and the majority of the mud holes round here i've never seen 

422.92 427.55 B: the ground be so moldy in areas 

426.71 430.31 A: oh yeah i noticed that yeah it's the same way here 

427.75 428.66 B: and and 

430.24 433.75 B: and right out here outside of my house 

433.59 447.55 B: the round my front door it's it's horrible i mean and the smell is horrible it's from all the rain and stuff that that's soaked into the ground and it's just it's terrible and i'm trying to stay out of it as much as possible 

436.47 437.75 A: mhm 

438.36 439.75 A: (( oh yeah )) 

440.44 441.35 A: mhm 

442.93 443.94 A: mhm 

446.66 458.95 A: well yeah you don't want to get in that mess i told my husband we have a little spot in the yard here that he needs to it it's like a just a a a a area where grass is not growing it's just moist just 

457.56 458.47 B: mhm 

458.85 473.58 A: standing water i said you need to fill it up with wa- um with some some soil lay it with rock and then cover with soil and you know maybe a couple layers of rock and then cover it up with some more soil and then plant your grass seed i said because it has no base 

473.65 474.63 B: mhm 

474.62 475.68 A: and i 

474.75 478.78 B: my husband's out there mowing grass now and i know better than to step out 

475.98 478.59 A: (( said )) 

478.63 480.26 A: (( oh yeah i just )) 

479.30 486.37 B: and even with the allergies that i have i have been known to get out and mow grass before we moved here 

486.13 489.14 A: oh don't want to do that 

486.24 495.34 B: i was the one who frequently i frequently mowed grass and i did it because my mother it was when i lived with my mother she was worse off than i was 

494.62 495.48 A: mm 

495.55 508.29 B: and i could get out and bear with it and it wouldn't bother me as bad i could mow and and weed eat and you know i'd give myself out and i'd suffer the next day 

500.19 501.05 A: right 

501.16 502.01 A: right 

508.55 512.31 B: but you know it it was something i knew i had to do 

511.76 520.65 A: right i stay away from that i i don't do that at all i tell my husband i said you do it i'm not going out there 

512.63 515.88 B: but i try to limit it 

520.27 521.90 B: [laughter] 

521.16 525.92 A: um it's not worth my health and maybe i have enough to do in the house 

522.48 524.99 B: yeah and and 

526.22 530.59 B: the thing of it is when you got small children my daughter's two 

530.31 531.27 A: yeah 

530.64 532.93 B: and they can't tell you everything 

532.47 533.60 A: no 

533.20 541.44 B: she she can feel when something's going on and she'll come to me and she'll say mummy i getting sick i need medicine 

540.39 541.06 A: (( mm )) 

541.72 542.30 A: (( ooh )) 

541.97 549.32 B: and you don't know whether are you really or are you just used to that flavor of medication you know because you 

546.91 549.94 A: mhm mhm yes 

549.56 552.24 B: you gotta find something that they'll take 

551.83 552.84 A: right 

552.40 559.99 B: and that'll help their condition and [sigh] i'm going to tell you the people who make medicines they've got it made because 

560.57 575.30 B: there is not one medication out there that is for every symptom you have there's always some symptom that you don't have that's in this or that you have that's not that's in this other bottle 

575.20 576.09 A: (( right )) 

575.31 580.43 B: and you can't take two of them you gotta pick the one that best suits you 

580.97 587.20 B: but they combine they've got a way of combining something out them in the medication 

587.29 593.91 B: that that i don't know that it's keeping you sick or but it's not covering all your conditions 

593.29 596.53 A: no it's not like one medicine that covers everything 

596.32 599.89 B: and it you may be coughing and sneezing
