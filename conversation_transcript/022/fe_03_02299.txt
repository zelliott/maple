0.63 2.38 A: (( hi this is )) 

2.86 4.03 B: hello 

4.25 5.07 A: (( hello )) 

4.93 5.80 B: yeah 

5.99 7.34 A: (( yeah hi this is )) 

8.85 10.37 B: hi this is shelley 

10.67 17.18 A: hi um i actually did not quite catch what that saying was that we were supposed to comment on 

16.85 20.29 B: [laughter] i didn't either something about a cold but 

20.53 22.85 B: i think it had to do with um 

20.90 21.76 A: yeah 

23.98 26.38 B: getting sick when the seasons change 

27.34 33.46 A: right right and said something about you know if the cold lasts for seven days will you go to the doctor or you don't 

33.10 38.10 B: right that's that's about what i heard don't worry about the whole thing [laughter] 

38.11 38.88 A: (( yep )) 

38.90 43.53 A: anyway i mean in fact the seasons just changed here in washington 

44.00 45.28 B: (( you're in washington )) 

44.09 45.17 A: (( and uh )) 

45.34 46.58 A: yeah 

46.19 49.04 B: oh okay i'm in rochester new york 

49.45 52.72 A: okay so i i guess you're still having winter 

52.94 55.36 B: um actually it's well 

55.67 58.56 B: the winter weather has gone about um 

58.65 62.16 B: a week ago i'd say so we're we're in the mid um 

62.20 66.27 B: mid to upper sixties today plus it's been like spring for the last week 

66.73 68.12 B: how about there 

68.98 75.85 A: it's actually been wonderful since yesterday i was uh the weather was pretty bad on saturday and uh i think i 

75.87 86.94 A: got out of the rain a little bit and managed to get some water on my head and perhaps a little into my head because i've been having um a cold and some um 

87.10 88.94 A: headaches because of this 

89.17 90.53 A: weather change 

90.59 91.41 A: um 

92.57 93.37 A: (( i'm sorry )) 

93.61 97.67 B: i and i don't seem too effected by the 

97.78 100.19 B: the season changes i get i did um 

100.88 105.10 B: i get a little bit of a nose bleed every now and then and that sure gets because of the 

105.35 111.54 B: season changing or just the days only get dry weather cause i get them pretty much in any season but um 

111.77 116.78 B: i notice i'm a schoolteacher i notice a lot of my students um 

116.89 119.31 B: having been out the last week or so a 

119.39 121.44 B: (( lot of absenteeism which )) 

121.47 125.30 B: could be because of the weather a lot of colds going on 

125.92 129.81 A: well if you're a school teacher then you also come into contact with a lot of 

129.86 131.11 A: children who are 

131.74 138.15 A: probably tend to be more sick of each other than uh most of the office environment 

138.37 152.75 A: so i guess that there is a higher chance that you actually i mean even if there was a small increase probability that you know changes in weather make people sicker that they normally are 

152.77 153.81 B: mhm 

153.76 157.66 A: place like a school probably amplifies that 

158.19 163.86 A: amplifies that a lot where as in an office space you probably get a little bit more 

163.90 164.86 A: um 

164.99 171.20 A: sort of isolation from each other because you you normally not out in the field playing soccer 

172.05 173.65 A: stuff like that so 

174.89 184.03 A: i wonder maybe if when when when seasons change is it is it that you see a huge number of students being sick at school or 

185.65 186.71 B: um 

187.88 194.14 B: it it seems like it i i've noticed it more in the last week than it's been may been maybe since christmas time 

194.89 195.79 B: so 

196.04 200.60 B: it's hard to tell um it's i teach high school too so it's harder to tell if the 

200.92 211.31 B: you know the absenteeism is because of illness or because when the season when it gets nicer weather out we have a lot more truancies [laughter] a lot of kids a lot of kids just uh 

208.01 209.08 A: [laughter] 

211.48 216.49 B: like to be any place other than school so it could be somewhat you know 

216.53 219.22 B: related to that too it's rely hard to say 

219.56 227.18 A: well i see i didn't actually go through the uh high school or or the pre high school system in the us 

226.78 229.07 B: mhm oh where did you go 

227.57 228.78 A: so i 

228.99 230.77 A: i went to school in india 

230.71 232.38 B: oh okay [noise] 

232.03 239.44 A: and so how is it here so if people are sick they they just don't show up at school but they don't have to bring in letters from the doctor or 

240.39 241.50 B: um 

242.01 247.28 B: they do well usually usually just a parents um note is enough 

247.40 259.94 B: but if it's going to be any kind of extended illness where um the student's going to need help uh like tutoring outside of school then it would have to come from a doctor in order to get the tutoring but if they are just out for a day or two 

260.62 264.53 B: actually even up to a week sometimes when the flu season comes then 

264.56 266.91 B: just a parents note is enough to 

267.21 270.61 B: um to give them excused absences 

271.72 273.81 A: i see and if the parents 

273.82 277.29 A: are planning a big family picnic then it works fine 

277.15 278.17 B: right 

279.10 285.67 A: well so so wh- what do you teach at school i guess i don't know if we're supposed to stick to the conversation 

285.98 289.34 B: yeah i don't know i was wondering that myself um 

288.77 289.66 A: and 

289.46 291.75 B: i'm a special education teacher 

292.09 294.04 B: and i i teach uh 

294.86 297.23 B: i teach kids that um 

298.44 302.49 B: have a lot of emotional and behavioral difficulties 

302.76 307.14 B: and so they're in a very small class size with a high 

307.37 313.34 B: teacher to student ratio we we have no more than six students in our classroom at a time 

314.75 315.69 A: wow 

315.79 322.46 B: so they're very it's kids that need a lot of um intensive behaviour support and supervision 

322.79 323.81 B: um 

324.32 325.34 B: and 

325.76 328.56 B: it's just that kind of thing to get through their school day 

328.76 331.58 B: some of them have learning disabilities but it's more 

331.92 340.09 B: um these tend to be kids more emotional and behavioral problems a lot of them are coming out of jail either juvenile justice system 

340.37 342.38 B: and they're on probation or 

343.08 344.33 B: they're um 

344.77 349.89 B: at risk of getting involved with um the law again so 

350.45 354.29 B: basically we're just there to give them a lot of supervision and behaviour support 

354.99 361.80 A: so do these programs i mean is there a track record of these programs actually make a big difference i mean 

362.01 365.91 A: do you actually see people become functioning 

365.93 368.35 A: members of society or or 

367.87 368.88 B: um 

368.52 369.51 A: is 

369.37 370.57 B: yeah we see 

371.56 373.76 B: i say we see about half of the kids 

374.29 376.84 B: [cough] and others getting returned back to the 

377.33 380.85 B: um the juvenile system and then eventually the adult 

381.43 382.50 B: system 

382.82 387.60 B: um so at at at this point it's the working for about half the kids i would say 

388.19 395.35 A: this yeah surprising too i actually do speak recognition i'm one of these people who's going to use this data that is coming out of this 

395.59 399.59 A: collection and i have no clue whether i'm supposed to stick to the topic 

400.51 406.59 A: and i was just wondering that the instructions needs to be probably a little bit more explicit 

406.91 408.18 A: from from nbc 

408.43 410.77 B: before the before the call 

410.94 417.30 A: yeah uh that you know whether they are expecting people to stick strictly to 

417.80 428.31 A: the topic or uh because basically what is going to be done is this this data is going to be used to test different research sites that are working to develop um speech recognition programs 

428.24 429.16 B: right 

429.23 436.77 A: and um and so one of the things that uh you know automatic speech recognizes find very hard to do 

436.86 446.73 A: is is recognize conversation speech because just like we've been doing in the past seven or eight minutes there's a huge variety of topic and people will skip from topic to topic 

446.93 447.96 B: right 

448.34 452.74 A: and so it's very hard and uh because these recognizers use 

452.79 456.33 A: emotional language that's very primitive 

457.22 462.34 A: uh it's very hard for these recognisers to automatically adjust to changes in language 

463.31 465.49 A: ah yeah changes in topic 

466.41 474.62 B: i wonder if that's part of what they're looking for though cause i i know on the website it said it was um study of linguistics and um 

474.70 477.30 B: something related to language so i would think that 

477.83 487.14 B: may be there was concern about the topics and about how people um are discussing that topic and you know whether and wonder if they are looking at things like how they 

487.53 490.46 B: stick to the topic or go off on tangents 

490.71 492.03 A: mhm 

491.48 492.91 B: from that topic 

493.13 499.08 A: h- how did you actually end up going to this website and finding out about 

498.29 499.27 B: um 

499.84 504.64 B: i typed in i did a search that said page research study 

504.77 511.33 B: cause i'm always looking i'm always looking um being a teacher i'm always looking for extra money over the summer 

504.84 505.72 A: uh-huh 

511.29 512.17 A: uh-huh 

511.74 515.76 B: and um this is just one of the first things that came up 

515.91 521.34 B: on the search and i clicked it on and kept reading and it and the more i read the more it sounded pretty interesting 

522.25 523.24 B: so 

523.72 525.62 A: (( i see that's )) 

526.12 527.05 A: (( we )) 

527.64 530.77 A: (( get on email from uh n._b._c. )) 

531.08 538.03 A: you know the data collection they're putting on and being part of that group that does research with this stuff it's i have an 

538.12 539.36 A: interest in 

539.58 544.35 A: joining these conversation you know how awkward it might be just to actually sustain 

544.74 550.09 A: uh i mean sort of strange actually you know get connected to someone and 

549.51 550.43 B: right 

550.24 556.70 A: h- have to talk about a particular topic which the two people might be really interested in 

557.24 560.51 A: (( and one would be asked like you know )) 

560.85 564.74 A: and how often is one sick it's a very strange 

565.72 569.85 A: thing so so we try to participate to get the data collection going 

569.89 576.38 B: yeah and i well i um i thought the same thing too that it just sounded interesting i mean of all of the different 

576.77 585.21 B: things that i saw on the screen last night this seemed like one of the more interesting things just to have a random conversation on a on a 

585.40 588.16 B: you know whatever topic with a with somebody you 

588.72 591.53 B: haven't discussed it with i thought it was pretty interesting 

592.31 599.89 A: well it is it is in fact uh i think you would find it even more interesting to actually review the conversations that people
