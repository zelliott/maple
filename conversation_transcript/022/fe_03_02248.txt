83.39 84.33 A: yeah 

84.82 98.51 B: not not so much i mean obviously coming from michigan it's not ah so big of a deal here but you know you get like a winter rainy season um yeah i guess you guys do too but um it's pretty much you know seventy degrees out here all the time so 

92.57 93.55 A: right

103.97 104.93 A: yeah 

106.72 109.77 A: [laughter] wow 

109.27 114.87 B: yeah but it's it's um a lot better than michigan i don't know if there's like more ragweed or something out there but 

114.18 116.52 A: yeah 

115.21 117.12 B: because it's also quite humid 

117.38 120.63 A: wow what other questions were we supposed to ah 

120.72 124.80 A: to cover about the the seasons do you remember they went through it so quickly 

124.21 125.66 B: i know um 

126.06 128.42 B: (( okay so we had the seasons and then )) 

128.52 131.01 A: i know it was how to how to keep yourself well 

129.03 129.63 B: (( yeah )) 

131.09 133.75 B: right okay well how do you keep yourself well [laughter] 

132.97 141.97 A: well [laughter] well i just ah i m- medication like you said before really you know helps a lot with allergies um 

138.61 139.51 B: yeah 

142.07 148.71 A: i just ah you know try to keep my house clean you know i dust a lot and ah 

145.61 148.24 B: yeah definitely from dust yeah 

148.73 160.29 A: um you know you try to use the air filters [noise] you know some sort of air cleaners or air filters during the winter i use a humidifier and i use a bacteriostat in it which really helps [noise] 

152.22 153.11 B: okay 

154.43 155.31 B: right 

159.53 160.56 B: oh wow 

160.81 173.66 A: you know and the liquid you know the water part of the humidi- um humidifier and [sigh] so that really helps a lot and i have little babies so it makes a big difference with you know the breathing in here and stuff and [noise] 

162.46 163.27 B: yeah 

165.61 166.52 B: right 

169.49 170.62 B: [laughter] 

172.23 173.97 B: yeah definitely 

173.79 184.72 A: [lipsmack] just always vacuuming and changing the filter and i change my air conditioning filter as well to try to you know limit what comes in from the outside you know 

182.38 189.09 B: yeah yeah definitely yeah i get from my allergies i get asthma and stuff so it's yeah it's very important that i ah 

187.13 188.27 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

189.20 192.67 B: keep it dusted and somewhat clean [laughter] 

192.01 200.98 A: right right i tell you though i don't really know what to do about the car situation 'cause i know that the yeah the filters in the ah i- in your air conditioner in your car 

196.31 197.44 B: (( oh )) 

200.61 201.55 B: yeah 

200.91 208.33 A: um over time they can accumulate stuff that'll affect your you know allergies or different you know different things and um 

204.55 205.87 B: oh okay 

207.97 212.24 B: bet you guys use that a lot in ah florida right [laughter] pretty muggy 

209.23 211.95 A: yeah yeah i mean we 

212.20 222.71 A: yeah it is a lot actually and it's very humid and a lot of stuff you know a lot of the the plants and trees like here we have we have really bad pollen but like the um [lipsmack] 

213.78 215.23 B: [laughter] 

222.88 223.88 A: the ah 

224.00 234.74 A: the oak trees are just i mean the produce a lot of the pollen and it's just so bad and then we have other plants that bloom the pine and other other types of things and 

226.38 228.44 B: oh okay 

233.67 234.91 B: yeah 

234.78 239.20 A: that creates you know a lot of stuff but i have to say the pollen's the worst here 

238.73 241.13 B: okay yeah that would make sense 

239.23 247.57 A: you know because it's nasty yellow it coats everything it gets all over your pool and your car and oh yeah [noise] i mean it's just 

241.92 242.85 B: right 

243.29 244.50 B: (( yeah )) 

244.78 246.29 B: oh really wow 

247.60 256.92 A: i'm forever cleaning my pool i have so much pollen it just gets in there and [noise] [laughter] yeah yeah it's pretty bad but 

251.72 254.52 B: (( oh wow i didn't realise it was that bad )) 

256.12 262.74 B: yeah my mom was in um scottsville which actually is i don't know the dry weather's pretty it's pretty good for me at least um 

261.76 263.78 A: yeah yeah 

262.95 266.10 B: i think a lot of a lot of the things don't even live out there so 

265.82 268.40 A: right [laughter] right 

266.28 280.62 B: um [laughter] and there's really no season change too much out there so that's not bad at all as far as that but i mean in michigan it's like i was always getting sick so i was really affected by it when it would get cold and 'cause your immune system's just trying to keep up with 

270.90 271.97 A: right 

277.46 278.66 A: yeah 

280.90 283.78 B: like what's going on [laughter] gets confused 

282.09 287.89 A: yeah and it gets colder there than it does here so yeah i mean you guys get snow there and 

283.79 285.59 B: oh it gets real cold [laughter] 

286.11 287.00 B: yeah 

287.35 288.76 B: yeah definitely 

288.13 289.99 A: that's you know i'm sure 

288.82 292.13 B: it's windy and wet and yeah it's really bad 

290.08 300.02 A: oh yeah i'm sure it's real different than here as far as the the way the the seasons are [noise] you know what what blooms what doesn't that kind of thing 

297.95 299.05 B: right 

299.39 300.67 B: yeah 

300.32 304.15 A: everything gets frozen over but you i imagine you have your own set of 

303.78 306.53 B: (( right but then you have to deal with the cold yeah exactly )) 

304.24 305.31 A: problems 

305.72 307.40 A: (( you know so )) 

306.62 309.96 B: yeah so you just have to keep yourself i don't know i guess warm and ah 

310.61 314.09 B: i don't know like healthy eating right and stuff like that 

312.79 319.06 A: yeah yeah here you know we just again try to to go i think the biggest problem here is 

319.07 333.47 A: one of the things that i really can't stand i've lived here all my life and ah it really messes up [noise] during seasons changing because s- you know we're in the middle of april here and we just had a cold snap not long ago right in the middle of april and i mean 

325.18 325.95 B: (( uh huh )) 

332.15 333.04 B: wow 

333.47 338.47 A: it's like where did that come from you know [laughter] okay this is supposed to be hot weather not cold weather 

334.70 336.36 B: yeah [laughter] 

337.02 337.95 B: right 

338.29 349.64 A: and it's you know it gets hot for two or or cold for two or three days and then all of a sudden it's it's you know rainy and then all of a sudden it's hot eighty degree hot and then everything opens up and blooms again 

344.63 345.87 B: right 

346.78 347.91 B: yeah 

349.35 350.37 B: (( right )) 

349.75 354.84 A: and then it's ah you know back to you know the cold the rain and i mean it's just 

354.87 358.64 A: there's there's the seasons [noise] don't seem to stay 

358.99 362.56 A: [lipsmack] as level i mean they don't seem to stay as consistent 

360.38 361.30 B: right 

362.55 363.39 B: (( yeah )) 

362.79 369.05 A: you know it's like i don't know maybe it's i don't know it just seems like years ago it just everything stayed so consistent 

368.39 375.01 B: i know right i mean i just remember yeah i don't who knows why that is but i remember the the snows being really 

372.11 373.21 A: yeah 

375.28 382.48 B: like really consistent and it was snowy for you know a good three months at least but now it's like ah kind of slushy kind of not you know 

378.74 379.87 A: right 

380.97 383.66 A: yeah [laughter] [laughter] yes 

382.65 386.28 B: it's gross you'd rather just you know it just snow and get it over with 

386.24 398.06 B: and then it get warm but yeah i was just in detroit a few ah weeks ago and it was sixty one day and then thirty literally the next day and it's like i don't [laughter] what season is that [laughter] 

386.32 387.96 A: right 

394.15 403.24 A: yeah and it that really affects you i mean that affects you you know your body so much and i mean your your allergies i mean 

400.02 401.02 B: uh-huh 

403.22 412.55 A: you know i think that's why so many so many people have allergies because there's the weather fluctuates from one extreme to the other so quickly 

406.46 407.38 B: right 

411.03 412.04 B: yeah 

412.42 418.37 A: your body can't get acclimated to one way you know and then just when you start to settle into 

414.71 416.49 B: (( right right )) 

418.40 424.56 A: one particular temperature or or a a range of a you know a a very moderate range all of a sudden you're 

424.69 434.27 A: way at the other end of the scale again the next day [laughter] so that really your body just i don't think has time to to get used to it yeah 

427.39 428.38 B: right 

431.45 434.35 B: yeah stabilize yeah get comfortable 

434.44 441.77 A: yeah so i think that that's probably one of the biggest things with me and my allergies and my my kids as well is 

434.63 436.04 B: yeah definitely 

442.01 456.93 A: we have you know the range of temperatures and then things bloom and then it's like you're you're battling with that and i mean we have we have seasonal you know supposed to be seasonal periods where things bloom and you can kind a 

444.87 445.84 B: mhm 

447.39 448.71 B: (( right )) 

455.49 457.28 B: yeah what are your seasons 

457.11 466.29 A: you know i ah i wanna say april and march or march and april is pollen really bad bad pollen and a matter of fact right now we're supposed to be out of pollen 

458.35 459.11 B: [laughter] 

466.10 468.40 B: and what's your um what's the weather like then 

468.33 471.03 A: it's ah [sigh] it's hot 

471.30 472.75 A: it's humid 

472.66 473.94 B: [laughter] 

473.03 480.20 A: ah [laughter] it's in the eighties and i and i'll say we're supposed to be matter of fact we had our first ah 

475.76 476.64 B: okay 

480.24 486.82 A: out here in the atlantic they had well further on out way out they had their first tropical storm of the the season 

486.19 487.80 B: (( oh okay )) 

486.96 491.58 A: um that and it's too early we're not supposed to have that until may 

491.05 492.58 B: yeah okay 

491.84 494.06 A: and ah 'cause we have hurricane season 

493.68 494.96 B: right 

494.17 507.31 A: you know which really brings in a lot of rain so you're dealing with every day at two o'clock we get showers you know and that's pretty you can pretty much bet around two o- two or three o'clock it's consistent yeah but 

500.43 502.20 B: (( okay wow )) 

503.63 505.53 B: that's crazy wow at 

506.59 509.20 B: least it's consistent though so you can deal with it [laughter] 

508.40 511.76 A: yeah with the rain i mean you kind of know when it's coming but 

510.89 511.90 B: yeah 

511.57 524.40 A: they're the h- you know the storms come sporadically anyway you can't always count on it to be at the same time but [sigh] you know five out of seven days it's right around two o'clock you know [laughter] so i mean 

522.40 523.99 B: (( okay wow [mn] )) 

524.39 537.97 A: it kind of helps with knowing that way [noise] but there are days when it just rains for two or three days [noise] you know and then it it's like no rain you know for a day or two and [noise] so it it changes but um 

533.06 534.11 B: yeah 

536.78 538.97 B: so then what what is your winter like 

538.89 548.94 A: it's you know [sigh] winter is so weird here because we don't get real we don't get winter like michigan people get winter you know to me it's freezing cold i mean it's seventy 

544.79 545.88 B: yeah 

547.02 551.34 B: yeah oh no i get cold too don't worry [laughter] it's like fifty degrees 

549.17 553.24 A: well you know to me seventy degrees is cold you know um 

551.41 552.31 B: yeah 

552.35 554.22 B: no i know [laughter] 

553.41 558.56 A: so 'cause i'm a floridian but you know i'd say my our winters here are 

555.09 556.25 B: yeah 

558.82 561.25 A: [lipsmack] we don't get super cold until 

560.38 561.24 B: mhm 

561.27 564.74 A: somewhere in january usually like the end of december 

562.57 563.60 B: (( oh )) 

564.27 565.12 B: okay 

564.82 567.97 A: beginning of january somewhere in there and then

574.89 576.26 B: (( oh wow okay )) 

582.06 587.99 A: you know it's more january february is our coldest i think our coldest times our hottest times are 

582.13 583.10 B: (( okay okay ))
