66.74 68.75 A: yeah um 

68.17 77.09 B: yeah but i don't know what they put in the foods 'cause my my feeling is that they butter it up and there's a lot of like oils and stuff like that so i gain a lot of weight when i eat out 

73.97 74.99 A: (( mhm )) 

75.14 80.00 A: yeah yeah it's well it's true you have more control than you do at

125.79 126.77 B: (( oh okay )) 

126.54 127.43 A: so 

126.88 130.55 B: yeah i don't i'm not that familiar with dallas i actually come from arkansas 

130.71 131.86 A: oh okay 

131.90 134.88 A: i'm minnesotan transplanted so 

134.54 137.17 B: yeah [laughter] all the way to manhattan wow 

136.38 138.37 A: (( yeah [lipsmack] yeah )) 

138.45 139.46 A: um 

138.94 142.40 B: when you do you like to eat out like at a nice restaurant or 

141.32 143.93 A: well i- 

144.20 150.09 A: [sigh] it's so different here than anywhere else in the world because every literally every 

150.57 153.96 A: restaurant delivers 

153.60 154.69 B: (( mm [laughter] )) 

154.22 157.57 A: from you know mcdonalds delivers here 

157.61 158.82 B: (( no way )) 

157.66 165.83 A: and you know diners ah up scale restaurants they all will deliver because you know people 

166.01 171.27 A: once they get home they they they either want to stay home or they want to eat something and go out 

171.54 172.86 A: so 

173.12 178.48 A: it's amaz- it's just amazing to me because i lived in minnesota for so long you know you never had 

178.59 181.79 A: delivery of anything except pizza [laughter] 

180.86 183.89 B: mhm mhm we have the same as yeah 

183.62 186.44 A: so that's you know a big 

187.81 196.34 A: adjustment for me [laughter] it is a good thing but it can also be a bad thing 'cause you know by the time you order it and then you have to tip the guy 

196.32 205.43 A: you know you've spent fifteen bucks on dinner and ah and all you've done is get something in your house you know so 

200.17 201.05 B: (( [laughter] i )) 

205.84 216.48 A: um yeah i don't know how often how often i actually eat out or d- have it delivered in i'd say at least once a week i have something delivered but 

216.72 219.94 A: um that's about it 

220.44 221.28 A: so 

220.58 227.63 B: always wondered about like new york city and like like actually being in the city like where the supermarkets are 'cause like you never see like 

227.17 228.87 A: yep [laughter] 

227.85 231.87 B: the movies and stuff or that there are actually supermarkets somewhere anywhere 

231.48 242.07 A: yeah but and actually when i used to visit here i did the same thing i just would look at people and go how co- how do you do they live here [laughter] h- how do you get just s- something simple like food 

242.33 254.63 A: and um once you get in the neighborhoods they do have ah chains of um grocery stores there's the ah food emporium which is kind of a upward scale 

254.66 255.71 A: um 

256.30 264.24 A: grocery store and then there the other two that are big here are degastino's and gristidi's which are kinda you know 

264.39 266.38 A: down with um 

266.68 272.69 A: not a food lion but you know [laughter] cause i know there are food lions there but um 

269.91 270.61 B: (( [laughter] mm )) 

273.02 275.35 A: maybe round the albertson's level 

275.23 279.10 B: oh okay albertson's i can relate to [laughter] yeah [laughter] mm 

277.01 278.46 A: yeah 

278.57 279.55 A: so 

279.62 280.60 A: um 

280.71 283.66 A: i remember that was at my sister's um 

284.29 294.21 A: so you i mean we you do have access to grocery stores but m- you know not everyone owns a car i don't so 

294.62 304.48 A: you end up either buying only what you can carry home or you can have it delivered for another three dollars and then a tip so [laughter] 

304.23 310.34 B: well that's interesting i never really realised that about that how you don't you probably like you could have like maybe four bags of stuff i don't know 

307.02 308.82 A: yeah 

310.06 314.39 A: yeah i mean sometimes i just figure i'm just going to get everything right now 

314.49 316.19 A: and have it all delivered 

317.04 323.97 A: at once and just be done you know for a month of you know unless i need bread or milk or whatever but um 

319.30 320.11 B: right 

324.84 329.40 A: i- honestly most of the time i just try to just get enough that i can carry 

329.55 331.14 A: 'cause it's 

331.37 333.56 A: i just hate to add on 

334.09 336.11 A: to already sky high 

336.66 338.67 A: (( prices here you know what i mean )) 

337.89 338.85 B: (( right )) 

338.97 347.02 B: like aren't you guys don't have like sam's club i don't know if you like your sister probably shops it's like a huge like kind of like um warehouse kind of 

345.58 346.59 A: (( yep )) 

346.62 350.28 A: yep they had one when i lived in minnesota we had sam's club and 

349.88 352.37 B: in new york i imagine you can't just like 

352.14 357.09 A: there's one on the outskirts um there's a mall like 

352.38 353.04 B: (( i do )) 

357.62 370.64 A: probably about twenty five miles north of here and it's got a target and a home depot and it it might be a b._j.'s or it's cosco one or the other 

370.38 371.50 B: mhm 

370.99 372.18 A: and um 

372.76 377.33 A: i have a sister that lives upstate the one that lived in dallas actually and and um 

377.92 382.93 A: when she comes and gets me i'm like i need to go to target's [laughter] 

381.13 382.97 B: [laughter]

393.53 402.03 A: target's that they have are you know a subway ride away and you then you run in again to how much can i carry [laughter] 

401.13 402.95 B: right right
