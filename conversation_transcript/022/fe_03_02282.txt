7.45 14.02 A: hi could you hold on one second i'm really sorry but i can't hear my stereo's blaring i am so sorry 

8.16 8.92 B: (( hi )) 

9.00 10.76 B: (( yeah )) 

11.19 12.27 B: okay 

13.16 14.26 B: (( all right )) 

20.93 24.05 A: i couldn't even understand what the topic of the day was 

23.81 31.77 B: uh they said it was illness and i was hoping that you heard all of it but uh that you could verify with me 

29.92 33.85 A: something about going to the doctor within seven days or something 

33.41 38.08 B: uh yeah they said uh talk about if um 

38.20 50.59 B: uh if you have a cold that if you don't go to the doctor it lasts longer and if you go to the doctor it it uh is shorter period of time something about seven days 

50.54 56.43 A: i'm sorry i don't go to the doctor for a cold [laughter] it eventually works its way out 

51.22 52.46 B: if you wait 

53.22 55.60 B: okay [laughter] well uh 

56.04 62.89 B: i would say um that as far as illness goes and the change of seasons 

62.90 74.50 B: uh that they're asking if we or if we think that you know agree that people get sick at the change of seasons i think for me personally i have allergies 

74.31 75.35 A: (( oh )) 

74.96 78.61 B: in the fall time of year and so when the seasons change 

78.62 85.49 B: uh from summer to uh fall uh i face uh difficulty with rag weed 

85.20 86.25 A: (( ooh )) 

85.52 95.76 B: and uh that's a very uh miserable uh existence for that period of time and uh i take allegra for that 

95.81 96.89 B: and 

95.85 97.37 A: does that work for you 

97.30 102.67 B: um i am limited because i i take blood pressure medication 

102.51 103.38 A: oh 

102.90 113.86 B: so i can only take certain things and i'm very limited on that but the allegra is just something i started last year and i guess it helped i kinda took it at the end of it 

114.07 129.07 B: uh but as far as uh getting sick when the seasons change i can see people doing that when it goes into winter time and i can see people doing that when it goes in the spring if they have allergies how do you feel about that does it affect you 

128.66 133.71 A: i i agree i however don't suffer from those type of allergies 

133.09 133.95 B: uh-huh 

133.81 138.89 A: and yeah it's when it goes from win- because i'm in chicago a chicago suburb 

138.49 139.48 B: yes 

139.01 141.92 A: when it goes from winter to spring to the nice weather 

142.17 151.69 A: we all end up sick for a couple of days and one is winter from not summer to to fall into winter everybody gets sick for a few days 

143.67 144.73 B: yeah 

144.83 145.81 B: yeah 

149.16 149.97 B: (( yeah )) 

151.06 162.46 B: uh yeah and i think uh like they said on the um information about colds i think uh a lot of times people will get the sniffles and the colds and the runny noses and 

161.87 162.80 A: mm 

162.44 171.97 B: and those kind of things because doesn't it seem to you that when the nights are cool and the day time is warmer that that's when you get those kind of things 

171.35 180.07 A: oh yes i mean and th- that's what i mean because like we can have seven degree weather during the day and in the evening it's forty two 

177.69 178.53 B: uh-huh 

179.67 181.15 B: [laughter] 

180.55 186.06 A: you know i mean that quick and so of course the body needs to adjust and 

185.17 188.91 B: that's right well i'm in texas by the way 

186.45 188.07 A: now when my kids 

188.65 190.06 A: oh you are 

189.45 195.02 B: i'm in north east texas which is uh about a hundred miles north east of dallas texas 

195.18 200.45 B: and so obviously my season seasonal changes are a little different than yours 

200.56 205.70 B: but not a whole lot we're still in the the middle part of the united states 

205.74 208.85 B: but uh i believe you still have cool weather there don't you 

209.05 215.02 A: well like today it was nice but now this evening is probably gonna be down to fifty two or something 

213.97 215.85 B: okay all right 

214.97 224.70 A: but that's still a lot better i'll take it over twenty below with the wind chill factor [laughter] any day of the week but i like winter i like the change of seasons however when my kids 

218.23 220.56 B: [laughter] 

221.64 222.79 B: well 

223.20 225.72 B: now i know you're known as the windy city 

225.28 226.38 A: yes 

226.21 234.98 B: uh do you feel uh that being the the seasonals changes that you experience there that you 

235.13 242.52 B: may experience more of sickness and more things blowing around and the exposure to more people type thing 

242.27 247.60 A: no i i i don't think it's that big of a thing i just think it's the body adjusting 

247.27 249.56 B: (( okay all right )) 

248.03 251.73 A: you know well maybe because there's new stuff in the air 

251.43 252.64 B: yeah 

252.06 262.33 A: as the weather warms up certain viruses then come back to life and vice versa as it gets cool some don't like the heat so i just think it's our bodies adjusting to the 

255.96 257.05 B: yes 

258.52 259.51 B: (( yes )) 

259.62 260.49 B: yes 

262.61 264.83 A: the new things in the air 

264.36 266.09 B: yes yeah 

265.21 272.49 A: so but i don't go to the doctor for it now my kids if they have a cold and it's lasting more than seven days those are my kids 

270.76 271.66 B: yes 

271.99 273.02 B: yes 

272.59 277.83 A: i make sure they're taken care of me you know i had a coughing a real bad coughing fit

279.84 282.87 A: and i couldn't sleep i was keeping everybody up at night 

282.54 284.07 B: [laughter] 

283.02 288.41 A: and i didn't my husband's like you should go to the doctor forget it [laughter] it'll 

285.24 286.31 B: yes 

286.40 288.34 B: [laughter] 

288.48 293.73 A: you know i'm not dying it'll you know run its course it's just taking longer than normal 

291.56 292.51 B: (( yeah )) 

293.52 299.89 B: well uh my wife and i are the same way neither one of us think you need to go to the doctor for a cold 

299.70 300.70 A: right 

299.76 314.65 B: and when they named that in the topic just a moment ago about going to the doctor for a cold i that never crosses my mind i never think about going to the doctor but like you say for your kids you're concerned about it moving into something else 

314.68 322.32 B: uh in your chest or especially if there's fever involved uh i can understand that but for a 

315.02 315.91 A: yes 

318.96 320.05 A: right 

321.11 324.20 A: well fever is a sign of infection somewhere 

323.47 326.82 B: yeah your body's fighting something sure 

324.39 326.28 A: well i don't mess around 

326.89 328.94 A: i don't mess around with that at all 

327.89 331.32 B: no no you shouldn't how old are your kids 

330.62 335.43 A: well they're older they- they range from thirteen to eighteen thirteen fourteen seventeen and eighteen 

333.58 334.43 B: okay 

334.56 343.43 B: well still though you get a sick teenager you know and they don't want to stop and they keep on going that can really get them down 

342.99 349.96 A: well my my son had an injury on his hand on the back side of his hand and 

346.32 347.21 B: yes 

348.14 349.05 B: sure 

349.79 360.27 A: it wasn't going away it wasn't going away and it's like well give it a couple more days after about ten days i said you know what maybe we should go in because he started to complain of pain 

358.85 360.93 B: yeah yes 

360.63 368.58 A: and he had some kind of weird thing if we didn't take care of it like then right when we went it would've killed him 

366.74 367.74 B: oh yes 

368.62 370.13 B: oh my goodness 

368.86 373.35 A: i couldn't believe it when the doctor told me see i'm not going to win any mother of the year award 

370.16 371.78 B: oh my goodness 

373.14 384.08 A: my kids have had broken bones and i'm like oh you're fine if you're walking on it it's not broke and then you finally say okay to shut you up we'll go get x-rays oh my god it's broke [laughter] you know 

374.95 375.69 B: [laughter] 

376.12 377.32 B: (( [laughter] )) 

377.47 378.49 B: uh-huh 

380.54 395.03 B: yeah yeah [laughter] well i think that they have a valid point there about the seasonal changes people getting sick i see that and i can i can agree with that 

384.66 385.53 A: (( so )) 

394.36 397.29 A: well especially now with this sars thing 

396.85 398.21 B: oh my goodness 

397.98 401.50 A: how do you distinguish between that and a cold 

400.85 404.18 B: that that's another point that's a good point 

402.65 406.76 A: when you got so many different things creeping up in the world 

405.16 415.74 B: yes that's a good point uh when when you think it's a cold it could be something else and so when they stated there about the seven day period you know i 

415.85 425.46 B: i've had colds longer than seven days and and not really thought anything about it you know i just figure that's just something to finally get of- over if i take care of myself 

420.53 421.46 A: mhm 

425.25 426.32 A: yeah 

425.94 431.79 B: i don't think about going to the doctor i think about the old standards that we were taught about 

427.43 428.38 A: (( [cough] )) 

432.17 438.97 B: rest and plenty of liquids and eating the right things and chicken noodle soup or whatever it might be 

437.26 438.11 A: (( yeah )) 

438.57 442.09 A: hot toddy at night before you go to bed [laughter] 

439.77 440.86 B: yeah 

440.91 448.56 B: something to just you know uh change what you're doing to try to regroup and get over it 

448.18 452.04 A: well also too i think a lot of times i'm sure you're busy 

452.33 463.07 A: and you're you're you're active with different things and we're so not used to getting enough sleep at night as compared to even ten years ago 

452.45 453.18 B: (( yeah )) 

455.40 456.35 B: yes 

459.88 460.78 B: right 

462.53 463.55 B: yes 

462.97 473.67 A: let alone twenty or thirty years ago i mean people get less sleep they you don't eat like we should everybody's doing the fast food and there's you know the frozen dinners kind of thing 

464.98 465.87 B: right 

469.19 471.77 B: that's right that's right 

472.70 474.45 B: sure sure 

473.83 485.45 A: so i mean i think all the that's why that that's why some my my husband go to the doctor and if i could just get some rest you know and if i ate better and if we had some fruit in the house [laughter] 

480.31 482.48 B: [laughter] yes 

483.76 496.92 B: yes well the seasonal changes may contribute to that because of the daylight savings time changes uh because your body adjusting to new hours with the sun changing its course and 

490.76 491.75 A: mhm 

496.31 497.37 A: yes 

496.93 503.86 B: you know they're just uh an adjustment there too that you go through because as it warms up you want to do things longer 

504.01 508.68 B: and different than you normally would do in the winter or the fall 

508.09 511.32 A: yeah you wanna oh it's a nice day let's take advantage of it 

510.50 524.71 B: yeah yeah but uh as far as as that goes you know about the change of the seasons and sickness i agree with that as far as the colds go i i don't agree with that but like you said it depends on the age of the person 

511.65 513.02 A: yeah 

525.02 533.73 B: and and where they are and do they have other things that are surrounded about that they're they're developing you got to be concerned about 

533.23 543.12 A: right or you know too a cold can be severe if you have another underlying problem you're not aware of like i've had cancer three times 

539.48 540.33 B: yes 

540.51 541.45 B: that's right 

542.46 544.04 B: oh my goodness 

543.46 546.76 A: and i'm going to tell you something that thing's never going to get me 

546.81 556.07 A: but um so while in that cancer active cancer state i mean a cold would just wipe me out 

555.61 557.25 B: oh yeah 

556.63 562.91 A: you know but normally a cold you know like now if i got a cold it would be more of a nuisance than anything else 

557.80 558.84 B: yeah 

561.87 572.80 B: yeah well you you that's a good solid point about your body's defense being down when you have a cold you're more susceptible to other things 

563.03 564.16 A: of if you have any 

572.45 573.58 A: yes 

573.19 577.07 B: you're that's what you're saying that's exactly right 

576.52 579.83 A: 'cause your body can only fight so many things at one time 

578.64 583.92 B: yeah yeah well do you get a flu shot in the uh 

580.48 581.57 A: (( you know so )) 

584.12 586.52 B: fall time of the year or the winter 

586.53 587.47 A: yes 

587.32 588.44 B: okay 

588.05 597.06 A: i do well i they the shots they gave me it's like uh a two or three year flu shot i only have to get it once every two or three years 

596.45 599.89 B: well i feel like a lot of times if i have a flu shot that i
