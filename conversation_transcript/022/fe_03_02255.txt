0.52 3.43 A: hi my name's darlene i'm calling from pennsylvania 

3.07 5.62 B: hi i'm leslie and i'm from indiana 

5.44 6.36 A: hi 

6.03 7.41 B: hi [laughter] 

6.94 10.05 A: did you understand everything that the topic's about today 

9.63 18.40 B: [laughter] well i kinda got that when i first called in i couldn't understand a word it said so this one i pretty much got um basically how um 

18.60 22.79 B: [lipsmack] it seems like a lot of people get sick when the seasons change and [sigh] [mn] 

23.00 25.59 B: just about illness in general if you 

25.88 30.41 B: [mn] they kinda threw out you know do doctors do any good too and 

31.29 33.28 B: things like that as well i guess 

34.21 35.22 B: um 

35.99 44.05 B: well i i mean if i get sick it's usually in the first three months of the year it seems like head colds kind of thing 

44.40 54.23 B: but um actually i noticed the last [sigh] two or three times i had gotten sick enough to actually go to the doctor it was right after i went to the dentist so we've kind of discovered i tend to get 

54.48 56.13 B: sick from that [laughter] 

55.90 58.92 A: that's kinda funny yeah i don't really i i just 

56.77 57.65 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

58.94 71.54 A: so that i kinda got the same thing i wasn't sure of everything they said but i kinda got it was just do you get sick during the change of seasons and stuff but i i know i don't i actually am a nurse and um i get a flu shot every year 

68.73 69.62 B: uh-huh 

71.34 72.40 B: oh yeah 

71.95 77.52 A: so if i get sick it's usually after that but this year i didn't 

78.07 83.01 A: so i don't really see a [laughter] change in seasons affecting me at all 

82.40 89.37 B: yeah i'm um [mn] 'cause really like january february is not a change that's kind of 

89.44 92.55 B: i mean i guess it's when it gets its worst but [mn] 

92.99 97.66 B: i mean i guess that might have more to do with ah the dryness of the air 

97.31 98.53 A: yeah 

97.96 110.51 B: ah 'cause i definitely don't think you know like my mom tells you you go outside and get sick 'cause it's cold well [laughter] it it might help help the virus a little more but it doesn't make you sick by itself 

110.79 111.74 B: um 

112.11 113.61 A: yeah i agree with that 

113.16 122.80 B: [laughter] ah yeah and i can't convince her of that but [laughter] they still swear if you get cold you get sick [laughter] 

120.90 128.85 A: [laughter] yeah yeah i'm i i don't think that i agree with that but 'cause i know i was outside i don't know how your winter was but we had a lot of snow so 

123.70 125.56 B: [laughter] 

129.30 134.38 A: i was out shoveling repeatedly and stuff and out for lengths of time and everything so 

134.83 146.94 B: yeah that wouldn't be fun um i have a husband who does that so [laughter] i don't get sick doing that personally i don't know why he does it either i'm like get a we we have a pretty big driveway 

138.30 140.42 A: [laughter] 

146.22 147.16 A: uh-huh 

146.83 156.03 B: and like either have somebody come through and take it out or get a snow blower because it's just ridiculous to spend hours and hours and hours out [laughter] doing that 

155.68 161.61 A: oh yeah we my husband and i decided after we had like i think it was like twenty inches 

161.63 163.59 A: over president's weekend 

163.24 164.40 B: oh boy 

163.93 166.30 A: and we were both like what are we doing 

165.91 167.70 B: [laughter] 

166.36 170.55 A: we were li- like i didn't called off of work until like seven thirty 

170.66 171.74 B: oh boy 

171.00 173.06 A: that monday morning and 

173.38 181.21 A: so we kinda like took advantage of it and went out a little bit later and we started shoveling and we're just like i wouldn't have been to work anyway 

181.70 185.50 A: it was so much so we're like let's get a snow blower [laughter] [laughter] 

182.65 183.63 B: [laughter] 

183.88 192.00 B: [laughter] yeah i think so um but did you get sick from it [laughter] no see i know [laughter] 

188.79 189.67 A: no 

191.00 192.71 A: no no it 

192.18 196.23 B: yeah i don't i 'cause i tend to have sinus problems anyway 

196.15 197.17 A: yeah 

196.57 203.14 B: so if i get something that's usually what it is but um then the last time i'd went to the doctor i said 

203.96 212.19 B: is there x. i was going to ask him if this could be connected to going to the dentist 'cause i just thought it was weird each time it was right after i'd went to the dentist 

211.63 212.76 A: yeah 

212.33 213.42 B: and um 

213.79 227.21 B: [lipsmack] he before i even said that he asked me you haven't been to the dentist have you and i said you're kidding me he goes yeah i've been noticing that everybody who comes in with this has been to the dentist but apparently it's like one of the bacterias that are usually in your mouth 

217.81 219.17 A: [laughter] 

224.19 224.75 A: (( [noise] )) 

226.60 227.85 A: yeah 

227.24 239.89 B: well something's getting happened whether they're cleaning your teeth or giving you the shot or it's but i went to the dentist last week and i used lots and lots of mouthwash during and after and before [laughter] so i haven't got sick so 

237.11 238.17 A: (( uh huh )) 

240.40 242.46 B: apparently that'll do it [laughter] 

240.44 241.63 A: that's really 

242.09 254.90 A: yeah i was gonna say now i haven't actually heard anything about that but i i guess that makes sense as you said 'cause i actually know my father had back problems and stuff and at the same time he was dealing with problems with his teeth 

255.07 264.58 A: and they're just like the best thing for you to do is get 'em all removed and just get dentures and he did that and his back problems went away so i know your mouth has a lot a bacteria 

261.37 262.11 B: hm 

262.21 263.16 B: strange 

263.96 266.61 B: well i know they also think um 

267.06 272.65 B: like the viruses and stuff may have to do with the heart problems and things like that too 

273.10 279.65 B: so who knows [laughter] but so far as seasons i don't have that much i guess a lot of people also have like allergies 

274.12 275.59 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

279.21 289.92 A: well that's what i was going to say like a- i mean i don't have any problems with allergies but i know like a lot of people i work with have 'em and like right now it's like really bad from our pollen's really bad here um in pennsylvania 

288.54 298.54 B: well that's what since i do have a lot of sinus problems i wonder if it's not maybe all- i've never really been tested or anything like that so i'm like maybe it's allergies this whole time and i never knew it 

293.96 294.94 A: uh-huh 

298.15 299.32 A: yeah 

298.70 304.44 B: um i'm not really sure i guess i i don't know after you live with it so long you kind of ignore it but 

304.02 305.20 A: exactly 

304.55 311.06 B: [laughter] at some point maybe i'll be like you know here i probably coulda been taking something for this all this time 

311.14 312.69 B: but um 

313.05 318.72 B: yeah because i remember one day in particular i thought man i can't believe how good i can breathe 

318.63 331.37 B: and i thought you know that's really pathetic when [laughter] you breathe really easily one day and like boy this is new [laughter] so ah i really probably ought to go 

321.45 322.77 A: (( [noise] [noise] [laughter] )) 

326.69 327.80 A: yeah 

331.07 333.21 A: [laughter] 

331.95 335.11 B: [laughter] have it checked out but 

334.74 336.73 A: but it's like one more thing huh 

336.33 343.06 B: yeah i know it's yeah in between everything else we're doing we've been fortunate so far nobody's been too ill 

342.85 349.40 A: yeah well that's ah my husband like will will not go to the doctor for anything i don't have a problem going 

344.38 345.68 B: this season 

347.17 350.83 B: [laughter] that's so funny he's married to a nurse [laughter] 

350.04 354.93 A: yeah yeah it's like i don't have a problem going but it's like it's not my favorite place to go you know 

354.25 358.24 B: [laughter] oh yeah i ah 

356.51 357.42 A: (( right )) 

358.98 372.90 B: yeah i just i usually wait is the little lo- that's what i was saying the last time i got sick 'cause i hate when it gets like into your throat especially if it's where it hurts to swallow kind i can take it otherwise but that i 

366.90 368.01 A: yeah 

369.95 370.83 A: yeah 

373.07 385.22 B: it's getting too ridiculous so ah i went right away as soon as i started getting sick so they started me on antibiotics and then i was fine and i'm like [laughter] i'm gonna have to stop waiting until i'm completely miserable 

373.09 374.01 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

385.42 387.41 A: and just go before yeah 

386.42 393.21 B: yeah [laughter] because what's the point you know it's like by then you're probably starting to get over it anyway so 

392.48 393.42 A: (( right )) 

393.75 395.36 B: (( and just being [sigh] )) 

393.85 404.59 A: yeah well that's sometimes like i've noticed stuff with my ears and i just kinda like ignore it but it ah sometimes i kinda correlate it with always having a stethoscope you know in 'em stuff like that you know using that and stuff but 

404.13 405.89 B: mm yeah it could be 

404.65 405.36 A: i 

405.61 408.78 A: it nurses are stubborn [laughter] 

407.47 414.96 B: [laughter] [laughter] no do you work for a r- just a family physician or 

408.80 410.81 A: but so are other people [laughter] 

414.65 422.92 A: i work for i actually work for a specialist but i've done all different types i've been in hospitals and stuff like that so now i work for an actual specialist a gastro enterologist 

417.81 418.72 B: oh okay 

423.30 424.22 A: um 

423.34 429.82 B: [sigh] so you have to go see a family doctor if you're you couldn't just see the person in your office [laughter] 

425.99 427.09 A: yeah 

428.55 436.61 A: well sometime depending on what it is sometimes we can get by and all you know they'll write out a script for us and stuff like that but there's some things 

430.70 432.28 B: well that's true 

435.24 436.19 B: yeah 

436.41 447.92 A: it's like really weird right now like all of us we work ten hour days and all of us stand on our feet and like every single one of us in the office are complaining of like knee hip feet pain 

447.79 451.03 B: mm yeah well gee i wonder why [laughter] 

448.28 449.56 A: and um 

450.04 454.30 A: and it's like all of us have done you know different sorts of jobs in the same 

454.55 459.97 A: area that we're working in and stuff and done the same kinda stuff so we don't know if it's something with the structure or not 

460.14 460.95 B: (( hm )) 

460.15 462.13 A: um but it's kinda it's 

461.28 464.66 B: oh yeah i see the way it's set up you might 

462.63 464.28 A: it's very frustrating 

464.70 469.17 B: yeah we're we we're lived in a really crammed area right now 

468.80 469.68 A: okay 

469.27 480.23 B: and i can tell um my knees have been bothering me more like when i have to like turn around tight spots you know like there's not much room to get around the edge of the bed and the

483.30 492.99 B: on that side i can tell that it hurts my knees more and i'm like you know [laughter] it's living in this cramped world and all the houses here it's like not good for you at all [laughter]

510.22 511.12 B: uh-huh 

514.06 524.43 A: that it was like unbelievable so like when we decided that we were gonna build it was just so much fun being able to pick out what my kitchen would look like and what we'd do with our bathrooms and stuff 

515.87 517.11 B: mhm 

524.52 537.75 A: and we went with a builder who has pretty much like just model homes they do and we were happy with what they did we did we didn't do any type of restructuring but we know some of the people in our development have changed 

531.57 532.65 B: (( yeah )) 

537.76 541.24 A: room structures around knocked out a wall here you know 

538.95 539.93 B: right

550.28 555.51 A: we didn't do any type of upgrading on our painting or anything like that that's something we'll do down the line 

555.63 556.67 A: um 

556.91 558.30 A: but it was just fun 

557.06 563.43 B: well that's like we should have stuff already going and we don't at all it's just like i can't believe it's may 

563.05 566.82 A: wow yeah yeah i know it's like what's oh 

563.82 573.14 B: [laughter] [laughter] i just like what are we gonna do it's gonna end up being fall and we're not gonna have a thing done and we'll have to wait til next year or something 

572.24 581.35 A: gosh well i gotta tell ya i mean we we were like one of the first ones in this development and it is amazing how much work they did over the winter with how bad a winter we had
