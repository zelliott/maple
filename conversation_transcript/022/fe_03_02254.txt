110.62 117.25 A: i'll take benadryl but i don't like to take it during the day 'cause it usually just kinda makes me feel wonky you know 

117.09 125.56 B: yeah yeah yeah ah well like you know like i was saying my neighbour she told me about it she only takes hers at night 'cause it makes her sleepy but it doesn't do that to me

125.04 126.26 A: mhm that's good 

125.66 135.45 B: i don't know why it's really strange but i don't buy the actual benadryl version i buy the store brand you know [noise] i just can't see spending that kinda money on 

131.31 133.34 A: yeah yeah i just buy the generic 

135.45 138.84 A: i know medicine is so expensive 

135.62 138.14 B: ah but it's it's outrageous 

138.15 141.43 B: yeah yeah is it cold up there now where you are 

141.04 152.03 A: you know it got warm these last couple days and then today it started just light showers it's been so weird 'cause a few weeks ago it was hot and then a week later it was snowing 

145.76 147.11 B: yeah 

149.55 150.55 B: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

151.78 154.10 B: yeah yeah 

152.44 155.68 A: you know so i keep thinking spring's here 

155.22 161.18 B: right how often do you find yourself going to the doctor for allergy related things you know 

160.17 165.45 A: you know i i don't like to go to the doctor [laughter] so i i just don't 'cause i figure 

162.52 163.83 B: yeah 

165.53 167.95 A: there's nothing they can really do for me and 

167.27 168.59 B: right 

167.96 177.51 A: i know i should go and get some prescription medicine my mom's always getting after me like go get claratyne or whatever and i just never get around to it 

171.54 172.36 B: well 

175.31 186.43 B: yeah see now that they always gave me samples and none of that stuff ever worked and so i just never [noise] got a prescription for it but benadryl was the one thing that really did [noise] [sigh] you know it's the only thing that seemed to work [noise] but 

183.55 184.60 A: mhm 

186.38 199.74 B: i found you know with ah you know dusting um you know trying to keep vacuuming and keep things clean and changing filters and you know doing all of that stuff i think it kind of keeps it it helps to keep it at bay 

194.79 195.87 A: mhm 

199.37 201.67 A: yeah it just kinda maintains it 

200.02 201.16 B: in homes 

201.25 214.16 B: yeah but you know when you go outside and you wanna work out in the yard [lipsmack] forget it [laughter] it's all over with you might as well wear a mask or something you know 'cause it's it's just you can't you then it's just a losing battle 

207.28 208.30 A: right 

209.22 211.24 A: [laughter] 

214.05 215.15 A: (( i know )) 

214.33 218.95 B: you know and i think it really affects probably ninety five percent of the population 

219.30 221.13 A: i know i know 

219.38 224.27 B: i mean i mean that's just my opinion but i i really think that it affects more people 

222.91 224.99 A: to some degree yeah 

224.44 234.24 B: yeah [sigh] i mean and and just recently i had a really bad sinus infection that actually it came out in my eyes in a in a really bad [noise] eye infection 

233.87 234.92 A: mhm 

234.32 243.53 B: and i had to go to the eye doctor and when i well actually i went to my regular doctor [noise] she couldn't believe it she said she looked in my nose you know they look in your nose and throat 

242.82 243.73 A: mhm 

243.33 249.79 B: and she said you are like so swollen and so closed off and she's like that's what it is it's coming out in your eyes 

246.49 247.58 A: oh no 

249.35 251.68 A: oh god [laughter] 

250.07 263.14 B: yes it was absolutely horrid and i had to go to the eye doctor too when i went you know i had to get my glasses and you know because i wear contacts so you know oh yeah so it was actually terrible 

258.02 260.86 A: mhm i know that makes it so hard 

261.12 268.51 A: so do i but then i try not wear the contacts and i just glasses are so annoying you know 

267.43 275.67 B: yeah yeah i tell ya though i got glasses finally after so many years i hadn't had glasses in you know millions of years it seems like and 

275.45 282.88 B: 'cause i got so you know i'd just been wearing contacts forever i'm just got used to it you know but when you have allergies and it it affects your eyes 

278.25 279.19 A: mhm 

279.44 280.72 A: mhm yeah 

282.42 286.61 A: and then you're walking around with these big red puffy eyes and you look like a monster 

283.39 284.77 B: oh yeah 

285.66 295.45 B: that's right that's right and it just it also infects your your contacts [noise] you know it contaminates you know your contacts you have to soak 'em and clean 'em and 

289.75 290.75 A: mhm 

291.95 292.93 A: right 

295.56 300.71 B: you know hopefully not have to buy new ones but you know like i wear disposables so i can just throw 'em away but 

299.94 301.17 A: yeah me too 

300.68 312.36 B: [noise] even still it costs you know [noise] so but you know that on the recording it said to to talk about the three different parts of how seasons you know how to keep yourself well or what do you to keep yourself well 

302.85 303.75 A: yeah 

312.36 317.63 B: and the other one the last one i thought was really kinda funny about the old saying about someth- 

316.67 318.66 A: i didn't hear what was the saying 

317.71 325.22 B: it was something about a cold will last seven days if you don't go to a doctor [laughter] 

324.30 327.22 A: you know i never go to the doctor for a cold 

325.74 326.55 B: y- 

326.61 332.40 B: yeah i know it's kind of i thought that was kind of stupid [laughter] i was like okay 

328.30 329.39 A: (( do you )) 

332.06 334.62 A: (( like there's nothing they can do for you )) 

334.77 336.36 B: not for a cold 

335.75 340.69 A: no no there's nothing so why waste my time and money 

337.10 338.87 B: [noise] you know 

339.93 341.24 B: (( right )) 

340.88 346.54 A: so that they can tell me to get some rest and drink some orange juice and wait it out like no thank you 

343.83 345.36 B: right right 

346.30 354.49 B: i mean i can see if if it turns into something like an infection you know something like that and you might need antibiotics or whatever but [sigh] [noise] 

350.96 352.01 A: right 

353.47 359.40 A: i'm kind of of the school of i don't go to the doctor unless like i'm near my deathbed or something [laughter] any 

358.17 360.77 B: yeah [noise] oh 

360.02 364.49 A: kind of a what like like i i don't know i just don't like to 

364.00 366.84 B: yeah i i thought that was so s 

364.55 368.40 A: you know alarmed about a flu or something you know 

367.72 370.48 B: right right i thought that was so weird i was like 

370.64 371.87 A: i know i know 

370.89 373.25 B: [laughter] 

372.14 377.42 A: well do you get any other illnesses with the season change besides the allergies 

374.43 375.42 B: um 

376.94 384.18 B: you know not re- well i have asthma i've had asthma since i was thirteen but i have maintenance for that and [sigh] um 

384.14 392.86 B: i tell ya the medication uh that i take for that that really helps a lot is not just my regular inhaler that i use daily but [sigh] i use another medication called advir 

392.70 393.69 A: mhm 

392.94 395.91 B: [noise] [lipsmack] which is like a it's like a round disc it's in a 

395.04 397.21 A: yeah i've seen that commercial 

396.03 410.54 B: you've seen those yeah it's it's like a a powder and you inhale it but it's it actually the one of the components in it is a steroid and um so the i think with that in itself i think that helps 

400.45 401.38 A: oh 

410.88 415.99 B: keep you know keep the ah asthma at bay pretty much but ah 

416.10 423.57 B: it really is so the you know it's the seasons can affect you so much with that but they do me 

423.11 424.21 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

423.58 431.91 B: um but they don't it's they don't really h- really i guess ah affect my asthma so to speak so much it's 

432.00 434.21 B: [noise] it's more my sinuses 

433.79 434.93 A: mhm 

434.35 439.82 B: you know i think if i let it go and i didn't take care of it and i didn't have my 

440.10 443.30 B: inhaler and my other medication i think it would 

442.86 443.79 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

443.69 454.18 B: but because i use those when certain things pop up you know in the air you know certain uh season changes and stuff it it primarily attacks my sinuses 

445.54 447.12 A: it's to maintain 

450.10 451.57 A: that's good 

454.64 455.61 B: so 

455.69 459.18 B: [lipsmack] but ah do you have any other things going on with you or 

459.09 465.94 A: no but you know i did have really bad bad allergies when i was younger and then when i 

459.86 460.78 B: no 

464.75 465.67 B: uh-huh

467.68 468.61 B: okay 

472.25 474.09 A: they weren't as bad 

473.59 474.40 B: (( ah )) 

474.33 477.08 A: because i know that there's different pollens
