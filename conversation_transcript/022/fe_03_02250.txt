0.18 2.87 B: hi i'm pauline smith 

3.46 5.53 A: hi i'm dee [laughter] [laughter] 

3.89 4.64 B: so 

5.56 9.67 B: nice to meet you over the phone [laughter] [laughter] oh 

9.66 21.46 B: i think the changing of the seasons is a good thing um some people do get sick but i think if they put their mind to thinking of the prettiness of the spring [sigh] 

21.25 26.43 B: and some other things that that kinda kinda counteracts the feeling of illness 

27.46 38.55 A: i think i lot of it is mental when people get sick when the seasons change because a lot of it is due to um the typical saying of um is it winter blues 

37.95 39.25 B: mhm 

38.59 42.11 A: and everybody and their mom gets depressed in the winter 

41.80 42.83 B: yeah 

42.46 43.83 A: (( the time i )) 

43.60 58.12 B: i i think that too and i think sometimes if you can get involved into like a [sigh] a reading group or ah a group of people where you can go out and coffee with you know and just get away from the house for a little while that kinda helps 

57.42 61.54 A: think a lot of it is just not dressing for the weather 

61.57 62.79 B: that's true 

62.55 64.66 A: um and some things like that 

64.05 65.09 B: mhm 

65.17 77.57 B: yeah i think a person just doesn't like to give up the nice weather in in a lot of respect to that and and some of em [sigh] might not have the heavier clothes and stuff for the colder climates you know 

76.45 77.41 A: yeah 

78.58 81.65 B: but there are a lot of factors that filter in there you know 

81.90 91.71 B: and if you watch a lot of t._v. and stuff sometimes that gets depression depressing too and people that stay in a lot during the winter and cold months do do that 

92.18 93.73 A: (( there isn't really much )) 

93.79 96.94 A: ha- many happy things on t._v. nowadays 

95.23 95.82 B: (( yeah )) 

96.32 98.54 B: that's true that's true 

98.82 103.59 B: but there again mindset you know w- plays a lot into it and 

103.65 112.89 B: and ah sometimes if you have grandchildren or people come over when the weather's cold and stuff and you can't get out you know that'd lift a person's spirits 

112.88 113.76 A: (( yes )) 

114.67 128.30 B: and then we come into the spring and there's such beautiful flowers and stuff coming up in april and and may and and i don't know it just kinda puts a whole new glow to the world you know just gives everybody a a uplifting 

128.45 133.11 A: i think when the spring comes there's a prerequisite where you just have to get out of your house 

132.97 136.01 B: that's true i think that's called spring fever 

136.15 142.07 A: and calls you and they're like it's so nice out have you been outside mhm and you're compelled to go out 

141.48 143.33 B: that's right yeah 

142.70 143.89 A: after then 

143.79 154.94 B: even in the early mornings and stuff and the birds sing and stuff when you have your windows open or you go outside and you first get greeted by that fresh smell you know especially after a nice spring rain 

158.44 161.35 B: which is what we could use right now 'cause we're dry 

162.05 167.10 A: could use a lot more i sorta think it was raining about twenty minutes ago 

165.40 166.03 B: (( mm )) 

166.67 168.56 B: yeah 

169.01 181.38 B: oh the it's just lovely the daffodils are all in bloom and and the birds sing and the ah fruit trees and stuff are starting to put on their their buds so that they can [sigh] later produce the fruit so 

182.21 183.84 B: it's a fun time of year 

185.63 189.29 A: [noise] it's it's people just naturally become happier 

189.27 190.21 B: right 

189.99 193.33 A: 'cause a lot of the things that just um 

193.51 195.91 A: springtime you know the sun's out long 

195.34 196.44 B: mhm 

196.23 198.11 A: everything's in bloom you know 

197.31 198.57 B: yeah 

198.34 206.14 A: less cloudy days so it's not only being out in better weather but just being out it doesn't look so gloomy out 

199.74 200.65 B: right 

205.53 207.19 B: (( mhm yes )) 

207.02 210.25 B: and then with the summer comes all the kids and and their ah 

210.24 224.43 B: anxious to go out and swim and and i know my husband loves to fish so he waits for the summer to come and the warm weather and [sigh] it's just just fun to be out and about during that time a lot of picnics and stuff go on and 

224.19 228.18 A: yeah 'cause summer's only really the best the best season to barbeque 

228.07 229.32 B: that's true 

229.19 230.79 A: except for early fall 

230.32 243.89 B: yeah fall's good too because i know when then comes the pretty leaves and stuff and we have a lot of our nice sixty and seventy degree weather comes anywhere from september through october and sometimes into mid november where i'm at 

245.60 249.78 A: well if we're lucky it'll stretch for the la- for the first week or so of the summer 

249.66 252.04 B: oh that'd be nice yeah 

251.87 261.19 B: we didn't have a lot of snow here for last winter so we're dry but you know the winters they change so much and so often one winter we'll have [sigh] 

261.01 267.26 B: quite a bit of snow and the next winter we'll have hardly any and it's just weird sometimes the way the seasons go 

267.80 269.45 A: oh we actually had a 

269.53 273.86 A: pretty fair amount of snow it just came later on in the winter 

273.52 274.49 B: yeah 

274.56 286.55 B: december here was good this past year it seemed like we didn't have most of our snow or our real cold weather even until about mid january and then it lasted up until mid march [sigh] 

286.61 290.66 A: how it was here it didn't really get start to warm up here until last week 

291.02 304.86 B: yeah well it's been a little warmer last week here than what it's been this week but then there again you know it's just that it changes so fast sometimes in different parts of the world that temperature wise you know 

305.18 311.29 B: one day we'll be up in the seventies and eighties and the next day we'll be down forty and fifty and that's quite a change 

311.53 313.00 A: that's a change 

312.53 317.27 B: yeah a person's body temperature doesn't change that fast and then people get sick 

322.51 325.63 A: i think some of it might also be like the way people eat too 

325.63 326.81 B: that's true 

327.01 332.50 B: i know i find that we do a lot of snacking and stuff and that's not healthy for a person 

332.40 333.18 A: (( no )) 

332.80 339.21 B: and then you get out and you get your fresh stuff out of your gardens and stuff and that that always tastes good and 

339.38 346.11 B: makes you think more about the spring and what all you could be doing in raising you know to eat a little healthier 

346.08 347.29 A: yeah 

347.44 348.48 B: (( hm hm )) 

348.75 349.42 B: (( hm )) 

349.44 352.30 B: i know this year we're planning on putting in some 

352.39 356.43 B: ah radishes and carrots and um 

356.62 361.60 B: potatoes and onions and peas and i don't think we're going to do tomatoes they both 

361.64 362.20 A: (( hm )) 

361.66 363.36 B: too acidy for us 

365.04 366.13 B: (( hm hm )) 

366.37 367.66 B: (( [mn] )) 

369.25 372.69 B: well it's cloudy up here now it looks like it's gonna start raining 

373.62 377.37 A: been a little cloudy out here for the last hour or so 

376.99 378.26 B: mhm 

377.53 378.52 A: (( rain again )) 

379.64 381.52 A: supposed to get thunderstorms 

380.92 388.02 B: yeah yeah i see some of the farmers are rushing around to get their crops in they're cro- planting corn here now [mn] 

390.10 391.42 A: i see squirrels 

391.36 392.90 B: yeah 

393.11 404.44 B: but i think with every changing of the season that there is something you know good to be said about about each each season you know fall has it's beautiful colors with the trees and everything 

404.52 411.45 B: and and then winter has the snow and it just makes it seem so [noise] 

411.12 412.90 A: (( serene you know and and just )) 

412.42 421.34 B: mm and spring is full of life and and vigor and and then summer you know we always get out there and we get hot and get sunburned and but it's fun [mn] 

419.93 420.69 A: (( so quiet )) 

422.70 425.63 A: [noise] yes [laughter] well certain seasons compel you to socialize more 

425.57 427.37 B: yeah yeah 

428.21 435.31 B: and i do think that's a difference in the world today too it's you know people don't neighbor like they used to years ago [mn] 

435.34 436.60 A: no they don't 

436.70 442.02 B: and i know a lot of it is fear and and you know the changes and stuff but [sigh] 

444.25 444.81 B: (( um )) 

445.25 450.81 B: i've been trying to get a few [sigh] plants started up here and and to put out so 

453.10 455.45 B: [mn] are you from iowa 

455.17 456.88 A: no i'm from pennsylvania 

456.40 463.42 B: oh i'm from iowa [laughter] yeah that's quite quite nice you know ah it's nice 

463.56 466.60 B: do you you guys had a lot of snow this last winter 

466.58 468.39 A: [mn] yeah we had 

468.83 470.73 A: three weeks of it i 

469.99 471.29 B: mhm 

471.38 474.60 A: think it snowed here for three days straight 

473.89 476.32 B: yeah oh we 

475.45 478.10 A: haven't had that much snow since ninety six 

477.71 489.19 B: yeah even the animals and stuff i think enjoy spring and and summer and fall a lot better than they do winter especially if they have to stay out [sigh] the outside animals so hm 

486.53 487.50 A: definitely 

489.41 490.38 A: definitely 

490.35 492.02 B: yeah 

492.10 499.23 B: and i think it's hard on the farmers if they're have to go out and milk and and and slop hogs and stuff like that 

498.81 499.63 A: yeah 

499.18 509.60 B: i grew up on a farm but i know i know a lot of 'em have gone more to just cattle and and ah grain farms now than what they used to doing a whole lot of every kind 

509.78 510.96 B: of farming 

511.90 513.41 A: probably just not as 

514.81 517.47 A: ah wise probably not as good any more 

517.54 518.84 B: yeah it could be 

519.47 524.62 B: but i'm sure you know the the seasons the changing of the seasons affects that too [mn] 

524.22 528.73 A: yeah especially when you don't have pretty stable weather 

528.61 529.56 B: yeah 

529.08 531.36 A: this year's weather's been really unstable 

531.17 543.38 B: mhm iowa's weather's been weird well unstable's a good word for it but i call it weird for the last i don't know four or five years it seems like nothing's been the norm [sigh] from what i can remember you know 

543.53 544.36 A: (( yes )) 

544.75 546.53 A: i mean last winter 

546.68 549.33 A: had a ton of snow the winter before that 

549.55 556.78 A: i don't think it didn't get cold until the last week of february and then it started to warm up again in march so we didn't really have a winter 

552.69 553.62 B: mhm 

556.49 557.42 B: yeah 

557.33 559.39 A: had a big drought 

558.80 561.81 B: yeah and i noticed ah the difference 

561.79 570.08 B: with the spring this year from last year is last year all my tulips and stuff were in bloom in march and this year now they're just starting to bloom 

569.85 578.56 B: and here we are close to the end of april [sigh] you know and it's just and they're not as tall they're they're short i think that's because of the dryness 

579.19 582.16 A: yes that probably has a lot to do with it too 

581.40 582.34 B: mhm 

582.73 584.78 B: yeah do you raise flowers 

585.00 587.44 A: i wish i had room in the garden 

587.53 588.15 B: (( [laughter] )) 

588.51 599.55 B: yeah i didn't for years and years 'cause we gardened but now the kids are all grown and away from home so i do the flowers hm and just a little bit of gardening
