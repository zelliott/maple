421.96 422.93 A: uh-huh 

425.27 426.41 A: oh okay 

425.96 429.71 B: but it's really the cat smell that bothers him more 

428.43 429.61 A: oh 

429.78 432.38 B: but i guess that's not really a seasonal thing [laughter] 

432.00 433.93 A: i don't have a cat 

433.98 439.67 A: i had a dog but i had to get rid of her because she became too protective of me

440.27 441.78 A: nobody could come 

441.96 449.54 A: nobody could come in my house without her carrying on and then when she bit my son i thought well i'm going to have to say goodbye cheyenne

449.81 450.91 B: yeah 

452.35 458.52 A: about five weeks and she just became so attached to me and i live alone 

453.95 455.06 B: oh 

458.76 462.02 A: and um i i mean i couldn't put up with that 

461.85 462.92 B: yeah 

462.31 465.23 A: i don't need that much protection [laughter] 

464.09 466.44 B: i have my dog for three years 

465.88 467.05 A: mhm 

466.62 471.43 B: and i got pregnant and when i got pregnant i realized that this dog's gonna have to go 

471.23 472.36 A: (( uh-huh )) 

471.67 478.14 B: because even when people hugged around her she would get so upset and she'd jump and she try to bite 

477.79 480.27 A: oh yeah what kind of a dog was it 

479.66 482.56 B: it was a beagle coon hound mix 

482.33 485.16 A: oh those kind aren't that way 

484.84 492.43 B: no i they're i think she was weaned early or something she she had other problems she she was you couldn't potty train her 

489.46 490.20 A: oh 

492.51 497.34 B: that was another reason she had to go there's no way with the baby in the house i could take take 

492.79 493.84 A: oh 

494.40 495.39 A: uh-huh 

496.73 498.14 A: do both huh 

497.82 501.81 B: yeah [laughter] i mean it and plus it was nasty you know 

498.36 499.58 A: yeah 

501.89 504.14 B: and when the baby happened to crawl around 

503.79 507.06 A: mhm right i ha- my dog was a snauzer 

504.55 505.63 B: but 

507.05 507.89 B: (( mm )) 

507.57 510.53 A: yeah cute little thing but had 

511.43 512.93 A: to couldn't keep her 

511.60 514.40 B: i i'm not sure if i'd get another dog [laughter] 

514.12 522.37 A: me either [laughter] i i mean i just love them but they're a lot of work i mean getting at two o'clock in the morning to take them out 

514.88 516.56 B: [laughter] 

523.09 524.16 B: yeah 

524.21 526.36 A: yeah i i didn't like that [laughter] 

525.75 531.65 B: and my dog for some reason it wouldn't it would never wake my husband up it would just wake me up 

531.51 532.66 A: (( uh-huh )) 

532.30 542.83 B: [laughter] our first dog we had actually um was my husband's dog and when we got married he de- she she decided that it was okay to wake me up but not him 

542.70 545.87 A: [laughter] 

543.67 544.81 B: [laughter] 

545.14 550.71 B: i think on her her idea was it was like him first and then her and then me 

550.85 554.26 B: and that was like and i existed only to serve her 

554.50 558.06 B: that was pretty much [laughter] pretty much how it worked out 

554.52 556.17 A: [laughter] 

557.32 560.67 A: that's enough to give you an allergy [laughter] 

559.03 560.07 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

560.19 565.66 B: but we yeah we have a cat but she goes to the bathroom outside we have a cat door 

564.44 565.23 A: oh 

565.34 566.36 A: uh-huh 

566.02 571.52 B: and i think that it has helped greatly with like problems with people that are allergic to cats 

571.42 574.24 A: well at least you don't have to clean out that litter thing 

573.63 574.94 B: yeah [laughter] 

575.35 577.80 B: yeah i did- i didn't like that [laughter]

578.11 580.99 B: that was the only thing i didn't like about having a cat 

580.68 583.18 A: uh-huh i never had one so 

583.67 592.52 B: they're not too bad actually they're they're kinda nice because they're loving sometimes but they're not all always around you all the time

593.93 596.57 A: uh-huh mhm i like dogs but um
