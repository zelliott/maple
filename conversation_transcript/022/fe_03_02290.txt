26.91 28.08 A: (( alright okay )) 

28.32 34.68 A: and and then let me see um we're supposed to talk about ten minutes right i guess okay 

33.09 34.42 B: right 

34.45 35.75 B: right 

35.13 40.77 A: and then they i guess the somebody else comes on in the system turns it off or whatever okay 

40.47 41.45 B: okay 

41.20 43.12 A: um yeah let's see 

43.15 50.95 A: uh normally i i don't get sick that much it's yeah about but if anything maybe a cold or i take some cold medicine or something like that you know 

50.60 53.59 B: yeah what what part of the country are you in 

53.60 55.26 A: um texas yeah 

54.65 59.86 B: oh i'm in wisconsin [laughter] [laughter] that probably makes a difference [laughter] 

56.53 58.09 A: (( okay [laughter] )) 

58.98 63.50 A: e- exactly yeah you got the really cold weather out there 

62.76 74.33 B: yeah yeah it does get pretty cold right now it was like seventy yesterday you know it's down to fifty and then you get a headache with you sinuses and it's more of a pain 

74.38 78.77 A: yeah because allergies change constantly changes and stuff like that 

78.51 86.33 B: yeah yeah do you guys have like um seasons like with the trees budding or do they just kind of see leaves all the time 

85.74 90.21 A: no y- yeah there are seasons yeah yeah fortunately uh it's 

90.54 97.17 A: it's not like florida i guess where you have this well kind of two seasons maybe you know cold and warm whatever but 

94.94 95.89 B: yeah 

97.18 102.32 A: (( are are really not in cold just kind of little bit cold but yeah anyway there is four seasons )) 

101.81 102.95 B: okay 

102.76 105.62 A: the trees change and all of that stuff yeah that's 

104.98 109.90 B: yeah i think that has a lot to do with it with all of the pollen and the budding and everything 

109.25 112.48 A: mhm and um 

112.69 114.11 A: yeah there's uh 

114.65 122.36 A: well there's i guess most of texas well some of the north texas gets a little bit uh colder i guess up near dallas that's where i am down near dallas 

121.95 123.12 B: (( oh okay )) 

123.18 124.18 A: and then 

123.39 124.52 B: okay 

124.21 130.87 A: you know south texas you know texas that's a huge place that the south texas just gets you know warmer quite a bit 

131.26 132.33 B: yeah 

131.56 132.47 A: uh 

132.50 139.21 A: even during winter uh but actually it get kind of got cold down there um this winter it's been kind of weird 

139.62 151.67 B: yeah i guess everything i think mainly it's the weather what effects everybody that's just the way it is here it's cold and damp one day and sunny and hot the next and you know especially during the springtime 

144.10 145.18 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

151.31 152.25 A: right 

152.15 154.29 B: it seems to make a big difference 

153.98 157.58 A: mhm did you grow up in wisconsin or 

157.27 159.22 B: um well actually michigan 

158.93 160.27 A: oh michigan okay

164.90 172.90 B: and uh it was a lot better down there [laughter] as far as the seasons go and be warm and sinuses and everything makes a difference 

167.62 168.88 A: (( okay [laughter] )) 

172.45 175.70 A: yeah yeah does uh it just um 

176.15 182.27 A: let's see i guess the summer the summer starts what pretty soon i mean it will be [mn] 

181.00 188.85 B: uh yeah yeah about the middle of end of may it starts you know getting up there being pretty warm at night

216.16 217.12 A: uh-huh 

217.32 218.45 A: yeah that's 

218.84 223.46 A: um yeah i guess in dallas there's well there's a lot of lakes around here but a 

223.20 224.53 B: yeah 

223.92 227.15 A: lot of people think i mean have you ever been to texas

373.72 378.43 B: sometimes they you know it's a pretty big deal and it makes the news and stuff but 

378.55 383.96 B: i don't didn't hear of anybody dying this year from flu out over in wisconsin so 

384.60 386.42 B: which is always good 

386.94 389.11 A: how far close are you near green bay 

388.89 389.95 B: um

393.82 396.16 A: okay madison wisconsin okay 

395.86 397.59 B: yeah so 

397.86 400.07 B: (( what about though )) 

400.54 402.38 A: oh you haven't been there 

401.89 402.79 B: no 

402.39 403.60 A: (( okay )) 

402.83 405.60 B: no it was just on the t._v. it's hard to get tickets 

405.15 407.94 A: yeah that's what i've heard it's really hard and that 

407.26 411.17 B: yeah it is unless you want to pay a couple hundred dollars for a ticket 

410.93 412.20 A: exactly [laughter] 

411.87 416.22 B: so that's really not an option [laughter] [laughter] 

414.21 421.80 A: yeah [laughter] yeah that's it's that'd be i mean i don't know it's easier i've been to cowboy games up here but 

421.16 422.24 B: okay 

422.45 432.60 A: they're not as expensive i mean i i could probably get in a game i mean they're not that good but hopefully they'll get better but they're probably i could get in for fifty a game i think fifty dollars a ticket 

432.15 434.30 B: oh that's not bad at all 

433.62 434.81 A: yeah 

434.77 436.47 B: and they'd be okay 

436.84 439.56 A: and uh but yeah there's uh i 

440.29 450.23 A: guess the state what's an older stadium i guess uh and stuff like that but green bay i guess actually the your fans own the team or something and it's totally different 

449.50 452.76 B: yeah they get they own stadium and everything 

452.20 453.17 A: okay 

452.81 456.10 B: so that's actually they are trying to build a new one too 

455.87 457.71 A: (( mhm )) 

457.21 460.29 B: so but i guess the taxpayers aren't 

460.58 463.96 B: some of them do and some of them don't so it's all politics 

463.61 467.24 A: yeah do they really need a new stadium or is that just 

464.05 465.32 B: but 

466.43 468.35 B: (( no no )) 

467.65 468.77 A: yeah just use 

469.64 471.76 B: i don't think they do but 

469.89 470.60 A: (( they )) 

471.86 474.42 A: should use what they have yeah 

473.76 477.81 B: yeah yeah i mean it's not falling down or anything you know 

477.99 483.07 B: from the pictures i've seen you know when you're looking at it during the games and it doesn't seem bad at all 

479.75 480.50 A: (( [laughter] )) 

482.74 485.28 A: right right that's true 

484.13 484.94 B: (( so )) 

485.21 487.50 B: you haven't actually been there so 

487.23 488.52 A: mhm 

488.56 490.65 A: i've seen it i guess um 

491.16 496.64 A: on t._v. and then there's uh what they are trying to build a new stadium out where the cowboys are i guess so 

496.41 497.52 B: oh are they 

498.06 510.43 A: they they i mean they really don't need one but jury joans he likes to have the most new equipment or building and facilities so that's what they're trying to do it's kind of river walk or something you know with other 

510.46 514.43 A: things around it you know restaurants and all that type of stuff 

512.30 513.15 B: oh 

514.08 515.33 B: (( okay )) 

516.06 517.97 B: (( okay well it sounds nice )) 

517.52 518.88 A: mhm 

519.07 521.55 B: sounds expensive but nice [laughter] 

520.84 522.91 A: (( [laughter] yes that's right )) 

522.94 524.05 A: (( is )) 

524.24 528.58 A: the h- how much is it c- is it costing very much in wisconsin or 

528.14 531.02 B: (( well i i don't know what you mean in a )) 

531.16 532.10 B: um 

531.25 532.04 A: right 

532.55 540.17 A: like i know you know l._a.'s real expensive well california is real expensive you know just normal little thing you know food and all that stuff is like expensive but 

535.37 536.38 B: yeah 

540.63 543.70 B: well we we pay two bucks for a gallon of milk 

543.24 544.27 A: okay 

544.03 545.91 B: what's it there 

545.24 549.66 A: it's it's probably yeah a dollar eighty something like that probably about the same 

549.39 558.85 B: oh okay so that's not bad yeah and gas is one fifty five a gallon here what's it there 

551.63 552.98 A: mhm

562.43 563.94 B: oh wow 

563.49 566.06 A: that's amazing the difference yeah but 

565.47 567.75 B: it is a big difference 

567.15 569.27 A: yeah i'm surprised 

569.33 574.07 B: well maybe we'll get that cheap over here now [laughter] 

571.38 575.10 A: (( that's right [laughter] exactly um )) 

574.72 577.21 B: but texas is an oil state so 

577.11 578.24 A: yeah 

577.64 579.44 B: you guys probably produce 

580.00 582.80 B: quite a bit of oil for your own use 

582.14 583.18 A: mhm 

582.93 585.25 B: compared to wisconsin where 

585.82 588.99 B: there's not much [laughter] there isn't [laughter] 

588.00 589.75 A: right [laughter] 

590.21 593.64 A: yeah that's uh i i guess they are that may be
