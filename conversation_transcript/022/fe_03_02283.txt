25.27 27.28 B: mhm 

26.14 32.17 A: okay i usually like get sick towards the end of the year like for maybe [laughter] like two months at a time 

32.30 43.78 A: and um most times i get bronchitis and that's the way it's been since i was a child and i think a about two years ago i got my tonsils taken out ever since then i haven't really gotten sick as much 

40.85 42.59 B: mhm 

43.73 54.07 A: but like i really try during the winter time not to drink like anything really cold or ice cream or something even that'll get my throat really cold and if i have to go outside and breathe cold air type thing 

48.60 50.50 B: mhm 

54.11 57.73 A: 'cause i have like asthma or is there something just wrong with my throat 

57.32 58.35 B: right 

57.88 61.02 A: so i end up getting sick a lot more just coughing 

61.15 62.68 A: throughout the winter season 

61.29 73.38 B: usual usually if i do get a cold i don't go to the doctor i just i just wean it out [laughter] yeah 'cause it's it's to me i can go to the store and get something to take 

67.57 68.68 A: really 

73.34 77.92 B: but now i i usually do that but now since i'm on 

78.08 84.20 B: um blood pressure medicine i can't do it because you know you can't take certain things and you 

81.31 82.17 A: mhm 

83.43 84.38 A: right 

84.42 89.68 B: so but um i just i hardly get a cold i wean it 

89.67 101.10 A: okay no i usually like wait around a couple of weeks 'cause i'm in school so i don't really get a chance to go to the doctor that often but um if it gets really bad to the point where i can't handle it any more then i'll go 

102.44 107.22 B: uh my daughter had a cold so i i'll take her because she's under one 

107.19 108.04 A: mhm 

107.33 111.84 B: and so you know if she gets a cold runny nose or whatever i'll take her 

111.92 113.39 B: 'cause she's a premie 

113.44 114.33 A: right 

113.45 115.34 B: i won't i won't wait for her 

115.38 116.39 A: (( okay mhm )) 

115.69 118.36 B: you know she has a little runny nose or something [noise] and 

119.21 122.38 B: he's getting on my nerves right now [laughter] 

120.59 122.51 A: [laughter] 

122.76 125.89 A: um is there anything else there we're supposed to say 

125.68 128.88 B: that you we have to talk for ten minutes on this [laughter] 

127.90 129.23 A: for ten minutes 

129.22 130.34 B: mhm 

129.63 131.38 A: [laughter] wow i 

130.64 137.69 B: it's actually it it's not going to seem like that long but you know once you you know 'cause you have to 

137.79 139.66 B: you know talk about you know 

140.36 143.11 B: the effects of the cold you know 

142.28 143.06 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

143.49 146.77 B: and stuff and i have taken like um 

147.55 149.96 B: the tylenol and flu stuff 

149.60 150.62 A: mhm 

150.03 155.21 B: for it which my husband he ha- he had a cold and i was pumping him 

155.20 165.06 B: with orange juice and he was taking vitamin c. at one point and he was supposed to be taking it every day so he wouldn't catch a cold well he didn't take it every day 

165.30 169.63 B: he stopped taking it so when he got a cold i you know went to the store and bought 

169.79 172.72 B: um nyquil and dayquil 

172.86 175.46 B: and you know give it to him every day 

175.51 187.63 A: really i'm not really a buff for taking medication and i think that's why i stay sick longer but [laughter] it's just i don't know i just hate any kind of medication whatsoever but um 

187.74 189.52 A: (( i was going to say something and i forget )) 

189.69 190.53 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

190.39 203.35 A: [laughter] but yeah i don't i don't really can't do the medication i don't know if it's just because since a child i've never really taken medication and i'm like you know always been forced to take it so like being a sem- a semi adult now 

199.33 200.38 B: mhm 

203.42 206.72 A: you know i i just don't like medication [laughter] mhm 

206.49 208.62 B: oh i'll i'll take it 

208.72 223.31 B: on occasion i was supposed to take medicine every day and i forget [laughter] now so i i don't like to take like cold stuff 'cause i i forget i forget i'm supposed to be taking it but if it's him i don't forget to remind him to take his medicine 

223.23 228.62 A: do you what i realized though like when i used to get coughs really bad i usually eat some jello 

228.50 229.49 B: mhm 

228.74 232.41 A: or um some pudding and that kind of soothes my throat 

232.71 235.08 B: oh that's that's a good idea [laughter] 

235.16 247.80 A: 'cause i mean like it was just like the throat would be really itchy and bad and i think just like jello it just it's something that just smooths it out i guess when it goes down your throat 'cause like i used i've always like had my refrigerator stocked with jello and pudding 

238.04 239.11 B: mhm 

243.72 244.75 B: right 

248.03 249.93 B: oh i like i eat ice 

248.10 249.05 A: so 

249.87 250.71 A: ice 

250.56 254.09 B: i i don't care how cold it is if i'm drinking something i want ice in it 

253.77 257.00 A: see ice will get me even worse i don't know why 

256.70 259.68 B: even if i have a cold i want ice 

258.08 258.97 A: mhm 

260.35 263.00 B: in my drink i don't care [laughter] i have 

262.24 263.24 A: [laughter] 

263.11 270.17 B: the if i have a if i have sodas in the refrigerator or orange juice in the refrigerator most of the time i jus- i put ice in my orange juice 

270.75 273.68 B: you know 'cause i'm so used to ice 

273.73 274.65 A: (( mhm mm )) 

274.49 276.45 B: and and it's just 

275.30 276.89 A: do you drink a lot of water 

276.89 281.36 B: yes i drink water with ice in it [laughter] 

279.81 280.94 A: [laughter] 

281.42 286.71 B: which a lot of people say that defeat the purpose but of course you know but i feel i want ice in my water 

286.67 287.67 A: mhm 

286.76 290.87 B: even if i have it out of well a lot of the time we have a water cooler 

290.77 291.71 A: right 

291.21 294.18 B: and i put you know ice in that so you know 

294.27 299.13 B: either way even if when i have a cold everything i you know drink i still have to have ice 

299.65 311.25 A: that's interesting 'cause i mean i think like before when i was getting as like two months six or whatever um i didn't really drink that much water back then and i think recently like when i've really started 

311.29 316.97 A: counting the number of bottles or glasses of water i drink a day to make sure i get my total amount 'cause i'm like 

315.73 317.00 B: mhm
