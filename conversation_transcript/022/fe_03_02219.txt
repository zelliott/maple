23.27 24.42 B: yeah that's

72.14 75.53 B: but not too big on the asian food 

74.59 88.89 A: yeah and then sometimes i i'm latin background so sometimes go to a latin restaurant but that that's not so much as being for being special but just having like home home cooked food since my family's not here [laughter] so 

80.36 81.55 B: yeah 

86.88 88.57 B: yeah that's true 

89.37 90.29 B: (( well )) 

89.68 90.82 A: um 

90.95 98.15 A: do you normally go out to like what kind of restaurants like high level or just you know moderate quick easy casual 

98.36 107.11 B: well it all depends on whatever you know the mood in for normally i mean if it's just a normal family outing we'll just go somewhere like um like cracker barrel or somewhere just nice and simple if 

106.32 108.72 A: [laughter] yeah 

107.57 113.58 B: it's the case of like it's a special occasion then of course we'll go somewhere like i don't know we'll pick some place that's a little nicer i mean 

113.89 117.05 B: i don't know we like uh we like uh outback or 

117.26 119.28 B: there's one down here called called

119.38 124.39 B: what's it called the italian grill or something i don't think it's very um 

125.33 126.78 B: i don't think it's stuff like 

125.50 128.36 A: it's like olive garden maybe or something 

128.37 134.63 B: yeah you know i don't think it's a widespread chain but it it's very very good and it's very smart yeah so 

132.73 133.54 A: oh

141.35 149.55 B: oh you don't have it's like that's right that's also a family uh it's in tampa in st pete's yeah i see the commercials on t._v. and i think maybe everybody else knows what corrobos is 

149.57 151.92 A: oh no i haven't heart that 

149.61 159.60 B: um no it's yeah it's like it has seafood it has a mixture you know it has like meat and it has a mixture of things it's really really good and the 

159.26 160.08 A: (( mm )) 

159.73 163.15 B: atmosphere is great i mean so can't beat it 

163.69 164.90 A: yeah wow 

165.94 169.66 B: what are some places that i mean do you know of any places up there that they don't have down here 

170.03 178.76 A: um a million [laughter] i can tell you the ones that that that are national that we have here we have the olive garden 

171.05 172.26 B: (( franchise wise oh )) 

173.11 175.33 B: really have you ever been to tampa 

178.83 182.51 A: um we have g._i._f. 

182.81 189.44 A: um you know a lot of those types but those aren't the ones that are really popular it is usually the ones that are 

189.70 198.03 A: individual restaurant it's like new york city's ever been here it's every block of the entire city that it is just restaurants next to each other 

198.01 205.93 A: it's like most ninety per cent of the restaurants i think they're like just the one here in new york and it's family owned 

198.03 198.85 B: yeah 

199.30 200.69 B: never been there so 

206.10 212.00 A: you know it's passed on through generations and then you have a few celebrity chefs that have several restaurants in the city 

211.92 212.91 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

212.43 226.32 A: and that's pretty much where people either eat in their neighborhood to their little places or there's like the really popular places that are very trendy and people flock all over to go there and manhattan is so small and 

226.30 230.43 A: everything's a subway ride or a taxi ride away no one really drives 

230.59 234.97 A: so you know you just kind of scour the city and explore 

230.76 231.62 B: yeah 

231.68 233.05 B: yeah so would you 

235.43 239.58 B: would you say fast food's more popular than say sitting down eating over there 

239.66 242.09 A: no here it's sit eating 

242.20 246.08 A: i've lived in california and it [noise] was more like fast food and take out 

242.28 243.19 B: (( [noise] wow )) 

245.84 248.06 B: that's how it is here everything's fast food [laughter] 

247.25 251.88 A: yeah here it's like it's such [noise] it's so fast paced 

252.08 256.83 A: and [noise] uh oh my dog's going crazy [laughter] it's so fast paced 

256.94 264.45 A: that at the end of the day you just sit down because you usually are on the run with lunch and you usually skip breakfast so 

262.26 263.10 B: yeah 

264.25 265.30 B: yeah 

264.67 273.89 A: [noise] dinner [noise] is the time when you just [noise] come sit with your friends [noise] and your family [noise] the only time of the day that you can kind of like unwind [noise] and so you [noise] definitely sit down environment 

273.78 279.56 B: yeah that's understandable everything here is just i mean fast food i mean i don't every day eat fast food i mean 

279.74 281.22 B: that's that's part of like 

280.47 281.37 A: [noise] 

281.86 284.52 B: like the culture down here like that's what you do and it's 

282.35 283.33 A: [noise] 

284.10 285.90 A: [laughter] yeah 

285.30 292.91 B: fast it's quick and it gets things done and i don't know i i guess i guess we can appreciate it more when you sit down i guess down here but 

293.31 299.65 B: i don't know i wouldn't like sitting down every time i would- i wouldn't mind sitting down at a restaurant every time i went out to eat and stuff that would be nice 

293.61 294.58 A: [noise] 

295.87 297.32 A: [noise] 

299.65 301.44 A: yeah you gotta come to new york 

301.59 310.58 B: yeah well i i i eventually will some day [laughter] i love florida though would you have you did you like california more than florida 

301.86 304.38 A: [laughter] [noise] 

307.30 309.07 A: [noise] yeah 

310.16 313.40 A: [noise] um i love [noise] california the weather [noise] 

313.85 320.74 A: and um [noise] and the fact that you could drive [noise] i don't know it's just like this laid back casual 

320.78 331.95 A: experience but then it gets [noise] i don't know it got a little boring for me [noise] kind of outgrew it and i love [noise] new york because it's just very international it's fast and there's so many types of restaurants 

331.69 332.61 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

331.87 340.27 A: you know it's you know it's no wonder the u._n. is here because it's really is a small world you know within [noise] every neighborhood you can 

340.37 343.80 A: have food from all over the world you know you know at a little restaurant 

342.17 344.17 B: (( yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah )) 

344.57 347.19 A: so food that i never would have tried

347.61 350.66 B: would you say was more dominating type food like ah
