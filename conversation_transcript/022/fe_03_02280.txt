8.74 12.77 B: yeah i don't even know how to do this really so i'm gonna follow your lead have you done this 

12.22 17.57 A: no i haven't actually done it um i i jus- where am i where are you ah calling from 

13.51 15.26 B: okay [laughter] 

17.19 20.12 B: i'm in santa monica california where are you 

19.14 25.04 A: oh okay i'm in new york how funny yeah i'm actually right in um right in downtown manhattan 

20.87 22.96 B: ah okay look at that perfect 

24.51 26.93 B: oh wow okay very good 

25.83 28.92 A: so yeah and you're in a beautiful area too so 

28.12 32.41 B: i am i'm right by the beach i'm about two blocks from the beach right now so yeah 

29.55 30.79 A: oh that's great 

31.46 32.55 A: that's great 

32.64 42.01 B: um so i guess we're supposed to be talking about colds and i i only got the first question um because i had it on speaker phone and i wasn't really listening and when then i picked it up so 

42.02 47.80 B: first question i guess was um do we get sick when the seasons change 

47.56 49.18 A: right um 

48.19 50.38 B: okay do you remember the rest of the questions 

49.76 53.51 A: and something about what do you do to keep yourself um 

53.52 61.30 A: getting sick when the seasons change and then there was some sort of phrase like uh you know like a stitch in time one of those things um 

55.61 56.61 B: okay 

60.87 61.90 B: right 

61.73 63.47 A: and it was something about 

64.52 73.64 A: you know give it a week uh i can't remember it but um there was some adage um that's all i really got from that so [laughter] it sounds like a robot so 

70.33 71.23 B: okay 

72.06 74.76 B: all right so we'll play it by ear 

74.06 75.71 A: (( yeah )) 

74.98 80.81 B: okay so let's see so do you um do you typically get sick when the seasons change 

80.20 82.94 A: yeah i do um especially in 

83.22 96.37 A: um especially like when it gets wet in the fall and i get sick this and the springtime i get sick because of allergies so um but other than that i'm pretty good well that's pretty much two seasons out of four so [laughter] 

87.32 88.46 B: mhm 

91.16 92.29 B: mhm 

95.75 101.19 B: right yeah i i am the same way i get sick in the spring and the fall when the seasons change 

101.25 104.03 B: and that's primarily because i'm allergic to trees 

103.88 106.85 A: oh that would be a problem in california [laughter] 

105.62 113.77 B: exactly yeah yeah um so um whenever the whenever the trees change whenever the new leaves 

113.80 127.74 B: start or the old leaves fall off i get sick and um but it's primarily allergies that i get sick with but even so i take zinc to try and shorten the duration of it 

121.13 121.98 A: okay 

127.06 129.00 A: oh cool does that actually work 

128.49 133.33 B: yeah actually it it cuts uh the duration of your illness in half 

132.78 134.29 A: oh wow okay 

133.57 141.36 B: and um my boyfriend just was suffering a cold this past week and he took zinc and he's much better now so 

140.62 141.73 A: oh cool 

141.52 147.20 B: yeah so i know that works what about you what do you take when you start to feel sick 

146.63 148.81 A: um i um 

149.57 150.94 A: well i take claritin 

150.71 156.97 A: when my allergies start kicking in which really helps um except i don't know if you've ever taken claritin but it like really dries you out 

150.91 151.62 B: mhm 

152.98 154.08 B: mhm 

156.46 157.73 B: mhm 

156.75 171.42 A: um so um i do that and um in the in the wintertime i try to exercise as much as possible um because i just notice that when i exercise i like non drowsy like you feel much better but it just prevents me from getting sick 

159.71 160.64 B: mhm 

163.94 164.98 B: mhm 

171.29 172.22 B: mhm 

171.34 172.55 A: um 

172.57 175.02 A: [cough] and because i live in new york like 

175.06 187.47 A: you can pretty much catch anything from anything so um i tend to you know i know this is probably not effective but i tend to you know take the subway wash my hands you know go back on the subway go home wash my hands you know all that stuff so 

183.62 184.63 B: mhm 

186.75 187.71 B: right 

187.53 196.16 A: um but i think half the time that that i get sick is is either because um i i travel a lot for work um so being on an airplane 

195.94 197.10 B: mhm 

196.39 199.58 A: and then um and then taking the train so 

198.96 199.92 B: mhm 

200.53 207.63 A: so yeah so it's and then you know just generally i'll just like pop a few pills or something especially aspirin if i get sick but that's 

205.89 206.92 B: right 

207.56 217.49 A: generally the extent of it i mean something like a cold is just having a cold is just annoying but you can generally get through it the allergies can get a little bit worse especially if you can't sleep so 

213.94 214.76 B: right 

217.37 227.95 B: yes and i have um developed sinusitis from not taking care of my allergies in time for just letting them go and sinusitis is extremely extremely painful so i can 

222.31 223.22 A: ooh 

226.95 228.73 A: what i don't even know what it is 

228.54 241.77 B: it's when your sinuses get inflamed and it can localize the pain can localize in any part of your head and i've had it localized in my jaw before and it just feels like you want to take a hammer and you know 

238.21 239.12 A: okay 

242.01 253.54 B: knock off the your bottom jaw it's so it's so painful so in order to avoid that i've taken claritin before and i've taken flonase i believe and wynocourt 

243.98 245.26 A: oh my god 

253.88 255.71 B: and um 

255.76 256.98 A: [laughter] 

256.16 266.07 B: and then of course i take extra strength tylenol i i'm just trying to give them whatever information they need as far as medicine kinda weird not to have a moderator on here 

263.23 264.54 A: sure right 

265.18 268.18 A: right no yeah it's totally random right so 

267.34 270.17 B: yeah this is bizarre but okay 

270.46 271.52 B: um 

271.53 276.56 B: so yeah and now i don't remember the saying that they were asking about were they asking about an 

276.64 280.00 B: an apple a day keeps the doctor away or what what kind of saying 

279.17 291.94 A: yes it was no it wasn't that 'cause i'd definitely remember that one something like that but you know whatever we can't remember it so we can't remember it um do you ever do you ever actually do any like sort of steaming like a sauna because i notice that helps me too 

285.98 287.00 B: right 

292.09 294.81 B: i would love to but i don't have access to a sauna 

294.46 295.57 A: (( oh okay )) 

295.17 298.10 B: so i haven't really done that um 

299.15 310.15 B: i just ah i pretty much stay indoors when the seasons change i don't get sick very often i mean oth- other than my allergies in the spring and the fall i i don't get colds very often 

310.25 314.82 B: so i've been lucky that way and um one of the oh here's um 

314.90 320.82 B: a trick that i learned that actually you might want to try because this is it's fantastic i learned it's kinda of an 

315.73 317.87 A: mhm okay good 

320.83 334.31 B: old greek folk remedy um when you have a sore throat it's pretty hideous but garlic with vinegar i mean gargle with vinegar and uh you won't have a sore throat in the morning if you do that before you go to bed 

329.66 330.49 A: mhm 

334.56 337.94 A: oh okay [laughter] wow yeah 

334.59 340.22 B: and it it's pretty miserable while you doing it but it works and it has worked for years for me 

339.71 340.47 A: (( oh )) 

340.27 341.66 B: so i um 

341.16 345.70 A: i've always heard about salt water like it says to gargle with salt water but never vinegar 

345.46 352.83 B: right well i've done salt water but that i i don't know if that really works i've i've tried it and i've never had it work but i've woken up 

353.08 359.58 B: in the morning after having a really severe sore throat and i've woken up with no sore throat after gargling with vinegar 

359.27 360.94 A: okay cool all 

360.17 362.30 B: so so that's a little trick i know 

361.70 365.33 A: right i'll try that i have like you know i can't think of any little tricks for you 

365.20 368.81 B: (( ah yeah [laughter] um )) 

366.49 367.49 A: (( um mm )) 

368.27 370.96 A: yeah no no home remedies or anything like that 

370.38 371.60 B: mhm 

371.06 375.13 A: um i've of- i've often heard that washing your feet helps too every day i don't know 

374.84 376.20 B: washing your feet 

375.59 384.82 A: like like tak- taking your feet and dipping them in cold water and yeah jus- just washing your feet don't like quote me on that but that that's an old wives' tale so 

378.60 379.62 B: really 

381.25 382.54 B: (( ah okay )) 

384.08 386.63 B: it keeps you from getting colds or what 

385.76 394.30 A: yeah exactly i don't know why it doesn't actually make sense but you know it's actually kind of contradictory but you know that's what i've heard so 

390.14 391.32 B: oh wow 

392.16 393.06 B: uh-huh 

393.57 395.82 B: that's very interesting okay 

395.23 398.14 A: so um yeah so [laughter] 

397.25 398.64 B: keep that in mind 

398.81 400.03 B: um 

400.08 404.06 B: i don't know what else we're supposed to do and i don't know how long we've been on the phone 

403.58 412.83 A: yeah i think we've been on the phone for like seven minutes um i i think we've kind of ex- like kinda hit everything that i can possibly talk about [laughter] i'm so 

406.36 407.22 B: okay 

411.84 420.17 B: i know i'm trying to think of anything else about illness illness well illness is really not confined to just colds and everything i suppose um 

420.93 422.69 B: and major illnesses but i 

422.74 426.61 B: don't have any or luckily haven't had any yet um 

426.18 429.24 A: are you you are you in your twenties you sound like you're fairly young 

429.17 431.11 B: i'm thirty one actually 

430.08 436.55 A: oh okay so i'm twenty nine so yeah so you're very lucky to have not yeah i i've been like knocking wood like very healthy so 

431.67 433.29 B: oh you are oh okay 

434.41 435.34 B: thanks 

436.52 443.69 B: yeah um well that is good i i've recently just been checked for everything because i've been suffering from excessive tiredness 

443.48 444.69 A: oh really mhm 

443.73 456.76 B: i just yeah i cannot get enough sleep no matter what i do so i have been going to the doctor time and time and time again to have all these tests done um because they figured it must be something must be some sort of illness 

455.14 455.91 A: right 

456.93 461.55 B: but i just finished the last test last week which was a c._a._t. scan of my entire torso 

461.09 461.99 A: wow 

461.61 466.25 B: and because they were worried i might have cancer and i i i don't so 

463.63 464.65 A: oh my god 

466.39 467.43 B: um 

467.12 468.99 A: have they checked you for a lime disease 

469.03 470.80 B: lime disease 

469.98 471.78 A: have you heard of that it 

470.97 477.15 B: um yeah i've heard of it but i don't know if they checked me for it they did a billion tests but um would that be a blood test 

471.94 472.75 A: okay 

476.75 486.02 A: yeah what happened i well actually i have lime disease and um yeah yeah i i grew up on long island i i'm not sure if you're familiar with it but it's huge tick um area and uh 

479.60 481.17 B: you do oh 

481.88 482.86 B: uh-huh 

486.03 492.61 A: i got bit by a tick i didn't even realize it and about like maybe a month or so after i they think i got bit 

491.89 493.16 B: mhm 

492.49 501.14 A: i started just i was just wiped i like every day i'd wake up and i'd get out of bed and i'd take a shower and at the end of the shower i was just like exhausted and uh 

499.96 501.49 B: really yeah 

500.99 502.26 A: yeah and so 

502.10 509.38 A: i mean it was really really bad to the point where i was calling in sick to work and if i was at work i'd just be like miserable and everything was aching me 

508.86 510.25 B: oh gosh 

509.25 519.09 A: um so i went to my doctor and he actually went three or four times then i went to a specialist um and it turns out that you know he said well you know he was actually pretty good he said well where have you 

513.99 514.86 B: uh-huh 

519.38 532.22 A: where have you been over the summer and i said long island and he said let me check you for lime disease just in case and sure enough they did a specific test for lime disease and that's what i had and so i've been on um i've been on medicine for the past like three years 

520.15 520.71 B: (( [noise] )) 

523.62 525.00 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

527.47 529.39 B: [noise] oh my gosh 

531.97 533.05 B: mhm 

532.85 535.20 A: like just like an antibacterial medicine 

535.13 549.15 A: uh but you know once you catch it you're good it's just a matter of if you let it progress too much it it really affects you so yeah so you may want to ask your doctor if he could take some of that blood that you've given him and see if he can send it for a you know 

535.59 536.50 B: right 

542.04 543.24 B: really 

549.11 550.71 A: a lime disease test 

549.77 555.08 B: that's a really good idea thank you so much for telling me about it i'm sorry you've had to go through that that sounds miserable 

554.41 561.02 A: it's it actually the the month i went through it was miserable but once i started taking the medicine it was fine it was like getting a virus out of my system 

559.12 559.99 B: right 

560.96 565.81 B: okay oh wow that's really interesting so how and how long do you have to take the medicine 

565.52 575.67 A: um i'm going to take it probably for another two years like it's yeah it's the kinda thing that it um luckily though it's the same kind of stuff you would take if you had like skin problems so my skin looks great 

567.82 569.11 B: two years 

574.23 575.11 B: mhm 

575.53 576.71 B: (( oh good )) 

575.77 589.61 A: um it's a it's an antibacterial um but the problem is it's like who wants to be taking medicine for five years but it it keeps the it keeps the virus um or bacteria i don't even know what it is like suppressed in my system but once 

578.65 579.87 B: oh 

582.61 583.58 B: yeah 

589.71 593.85 A: i go off the medicine if i if i ever do like it'll it'll rise back up 

593.42 594.78 B: mm i see 

594.51 596.47 A: so um you know so 

596.69 597.77 B: wow 

597.31 599.89 A: so you may want to just get your i don't know if you have ticks in california 

598.74 599.95 B: thank you
