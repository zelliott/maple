300.28 302.05 B: yeah 

301.33 305.56 A: i i like i kind of tend to like burger king a little better 

305.59 306.56 B: do you 

306.43 309.29 A: yeah i'm more of a burger king kind of person 

309.66 314.62 B: well i liked their fish sandwich for a long time until i saw what it was 

314.38 315.60 A: what was it 

314.63 316.77 B: how many calories there was 

316.59 318.13 A: it was what

324.45 325.82 A: the fish 

325.62 328.29 B: the fish sandwich with the mayonnaise 

327.71 328.89 A: uh-huh 

329.06 331.11 B: at burger king 

331.84 334.93 A: oh okay so it's not very healthy uh 

334.60 336.74 B: no it isn't 

336.19 337.52 A: [laughter] 

336.97 345.45 B: i thought it was healthy for me the fish sandwich and i was reading the paper the other day or online or somewhere 

345.58 349.15 B: where they say that people who eat a fried fish 

349.33 352.33 B: sandwich seven days a week 

352.42 357.79 B: it's worse for them than somebody that eats two or three baked fish 

358.17 360.60 B: dinners a month a week 

361.55 362.54 A: oh 

362.80 370.27 B: or a month maybe it was a month but something like that it would be two two baked fish dinners a week 

370.86 373.31 B: it's good for you it's real good for you 

373.60 377.17 B: but if you eat seven fried fish sandwiches 

377.51 378.78 B: a week 

379.01 380.79 B: or fried fish 

381.10 382.97 B: it's not good for you 

384.08 386.07 A: [laughter] 

386.61 390.00 A: well i guess that's not really new news to me though 

389.72 390.83 B: (( isn't it )) 

390.72 396.32 A: no i mean not really because i wouldn't think that fried food would be all that healthy for you anyway 

396.99 398.73 B: even if it's fish 

399.13 400.97 A: even if it's fish 

401.67 403.28 A: i wouldn't think so 

403.13 403.99 B: mhm 

405.60 408.78 A: i mean i think baked fish is much healthier 

408.91 410.27 B: yeah 

412.32 414.08 A: that would be my guess 

418.62 423.72 A: so how how long have you been in ah participating in this study
