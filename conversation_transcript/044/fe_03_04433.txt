0.62 2.26 A: hi i'm kevin 

1.91 4.42 B: hi i'm angela how are you 

4.40 6.04 A: good 

6.14 8.75 B: well do you wanna start or would you like me to 

8.74 10.33 A: uh you can go ahead 

9.83 20.76 B: [laughter] well i- i'm thinking that at the moment that i'd probably take the million dollars [laughter] mainly 'cause i've been kind of annoyed with my best friend recently so 

16.31 17.26 A: [laughter] 

19.43 20.70 A: [laughter] 

20.85 27.96 B: it's just kinda good timing that makes me think i i've sort of been reevaluating our friendship and thinking that 

27.97 30.47 B: she's not such a great friend anyway so 

30.17 31.85 A: [laughter] 

31.01 36.38 B: if somebody will give me a million dollars [laughter] then i may as well take it now 

33.55 34.89 A: [laughter] 

36.42 37.47 A: yeah 

36.90 43.48 B: [laughter] i guess so it's kind of a interesting question given the m- my current situation 

43.25 44.49 A: yeah it is 

44.86 47.29 B: what about you do you think you would take it 

46.78 53.96 A: i- i'd probably not i don't think i would i 

53.15 56.33 B: you m- you must have a better best friend than me [laughter] 

55.67 57.30 A: yeah sounds like it 

58.15 61.12 A: yeah i like spending time with my friends more than 

61.99 64.22 A: buying stuff i guess 

63.66 64.66 B: mhm 

65.92 73.14 B: well probably normally i mean i would say there there probably have been times in my life where i wouldn't say yes 

72.90 73.92 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

73.65 74.72 B: i mean 

74.88 79.02 B: i don't know i guess it it sort of depends on at the moment if you 

79.12 82.76 B: kind of what the quality of your friendships are i guess 'cause 

83.54 84.41 B: (( you know )) 

83.64 85.64 A: yeah it does 

85.25 94.86 B: i mean i think like with this one friend that that i'm thinking of if two years ago if if somebody had asked me that question i think i would have said no 'cause 

95.05 101.75 B: then i felt like our relationship was really good and really strong and it wouldn't have seemed worth the money 

102.47 104.15 B: but now just 'cause 

104.40 107.32 B: things have kind of changed it seems like 

108.09 109.35 B: (( i i guess i )) 

109.37 113.66 B: don't put nearly as much value on the relationship anyway so it so it 

114.11 115.83 A: yeah 

114.73 117.47 B: doesn't doesn't have as much importance to me 

118.67 120.44 A: yeah 

120.54 121.30 A: well it's 

121.49 122.43 A: yes 

123.34 126.25 A: i don't know you'll probably change your mind again if you 

126.52 130.11 A: reconcile your relationship or find a new best friend or 

130.82 136.24 B: yeah yeah i think yeah if i if if the relationship was going better or yeah if there was 

135.70 136.92 A: yeah 

136.67 147.65 B: somebody else that you know i develop a new relationship with and they become my new best friend and [laughter] you know then i then i probably would change my mind but 

142.64 144.41 A: yeah 

148.71 152.01 B: although i guess actually i you know i now that i think about it i 

152.21 153.24 B: i guess 

153.42 158.41 B: i don't know i guess first i'd have to know probably exactly how they were 

159.01 162.17 B: defining or choosing who my best friend was 'cause like 

162.30 168.43 B: my immediate response to that was to think of my best female friend but like 

168.53 181.21 B: i yeah i i probably if i had to actually say who my best friend is in my life i probably would say my husband and i wouldn't take the million dollars to never speak to him again 

168.54 170.37 A: yeah 

181.27 182.61 A: yeah 

182.52 183.45 B: so 

183.57 185.18 B: i don't know i guess 

185.64 189.63 B: i guess i'd have to figure that out first [laughter] wh- who is the best friend [laughter] i mean 

187.79 189.13 A: yeah 

189.42 192.62 A: yeah it all depends on that 

192.88 194.44 B: 'cause that could 

194.58 196.93 A: that could yeah that could change your decision 

196.96 198.31 B: yeah 

197.81 201.57 A: depending on who your best friend is in their eyes 

200.74 201.86 B: yeah 

202.15 208.03 B: i mean were you thinking of like a a platonic best friend is that who is that who you were thinking of with the question 

207.83 209.59 A: yeah 

209.93 211.56 A: (( but )) 

211.65 212.73 A: (( i don't know )) 

214.66 217.21 A: i might 'cause 

218.08 221.14 A: i'm gonna be finishing up high school soon so 

221.27 223.65 A: i might never see him again anyway 

224.86 232.19 A: but i mm probably not 'cause i'd still like to y- you know talk to him and be friends with him 

231.36 232.35 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

233.50 236.43 B: so you're just not sure if it's gonna be a lasting 

237.17 238.29 B: friendship 

238.32 240.06 A: yeah 

240.16 242.40 A: at least try it first 

244.41 246.78 B: well that makes sense yeah actually if you 

247.18 249.57 B: you probably wanna think about those things if 

250.32 251.84 A: yeah 

252.21 253.23 B: (( i don't know i guess )) 

252.26 253.20 A: (( consider )) 

253.40 255.68 B: i guess if somebody came to me with that 

255.95 257.73 B: that question i'd have to 

258.14 265.12 B: sit down and do some serious thinking about [laughter] my friendships and and yeah and what i thought the 

262.58 264.33 A: yeah 

265.26 268.12 B: the future of 'em was and 

269.06 272.31 B: i mean i guess it it wouldn't be a an easy 

272.48 274.52 B: quick decision to make 

274.51 278.34 A: no it wouldn't you'd have to think about that i'd have to think about it too 

281.64 284.92 A: i don't know it's different when it's just a question too it's 

281.98 282.76 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

285.00 288.25 A: a lot different if somebody actually came up to you and asked you 

288.89 290.40 B: yeah that's true 

290.41 292.39 A: that'd be different for me at least 

292.52 293.79 B: yeah 

294.02 301.95 B: well yeah 'cause i i can't imagine even i mean the thought of having a million dollars is such a foreign concept to me that 

301.77 303.07 A: yeah 

302.32 310.62 B: it just doesn't seem real but yeah it i- i- the money would be very tempting if somebody actually came up and had a million dollars cash right there 

310.00 311.27 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

310.90 316.49 B: you know [laughter] that would that would make it so much more real and so much more tempting but then 

315.77 316.98 A: it would 

317.09 321.03 B: you know so i'd i don't know i might might be more tempted then to 

320.92 322.72 A: yeah 

321.87 323.69 B: to think about doing it 

323.93 328.00 B: but then but then yeah too if i actually thought about 

328.07 330.84 B: okay i can't ever talk to this person again that 

331.46 332.59 B: that would be 

331.62 334.36 A: yeah that'd sway it too 

332.98 334.76 B: a little more real 

337.23 339.25 B: but so you're in high school right now 

339.08 340.20 A: yeah 

341.90 348.25 B: i think if i think if when i was in high school if i'd been asked that i probably would have said no that i wouldn't take the money 

348.78 357.42 B: but then the funny thing is that the the people that i would have said were my best friends in high school i don't talk to now [laughter] i i don't have any contact with so i 

353.95 355.24 A: yeah 

356.65 358.46 A: yeah 

358.33 362.95 B: so yeah you don't you don't know how your relationships are going to change and 

362.60 365.22 A: (( yeah you don't know how it's going to turn out )) 

366.09 372.56 B: i i could see myself if i if i refused the money maybe ten years later kicking myself in the butt thinking 

372.63 374.19 B: you know if then i 

374.21 377.36 B: ten years later i wasn't having any contact with the person i'd 

376.88 378.66 A: yeah 

377.83 381.24 B: i'd be thinking jeeze why didn't i take that money ten years ago 

381.21 383.37 A: (( yeah you'd be a little better off now )) 

383.70 384.77 B: yeah 

385.78 390.47 B: i i think a lot of people probably would say yes and would take the money 

390.59 392.35 A: yeah 

392.98 395.66 B: 'cause it's that's a lot of money [laughter] 

395.07 399.67 A: it is yeah you can get a lot of stuff for that 

399.90 403.45 B: there's there's a lot you could do with a million dollars so 

404.95 408.39 A: yeah you could probably find some new friends with it too 

408.28 409.65 B: yeah [laughter] 

409.69 412.05 B: yeah buy some new friends [laughter] 

412.37 416.87 B: i i'm sure you'd be you'd pretty popular if you had a million dollars [laughter] i 

416.64 418.75 A: yeah 

418.33 422.75 B: mean imagine if if you went back to your high school and all of a sudden you were a millionaire 

423.00 423.78 B: [laughter] 

424.34 425.64 A: yeah 

425.11 427.93 B: i i bet that would make you very popular or [laughter] hm 

427.51 430.50 A: yeah it would change things a lot i bet 

431.16 436.74 B: but then you'd have to worry about are these really are the new friends really true friends or is it just for the money you'd have 

434.78 436.54 A: (( yeah )) 

437.09 438.70 A: that'd make it difficult 

438.82 441.80 B: (( yeah 'cause you'd have to question are they )) 

442.56 445.99 B: are they just wanting my money or wanting to take advantage of my 

445.21 447.49 A: (( not a friend yeah )) 

449.01 450.73 A: yeah 

451.10 452.36 B: (( money so )) 

452.85 455.21 B: i i don't know what i'd do like i said i think 

455.39 463.26 B: right now at this moment if somebody came up to me tomorrow and made that offer i'd i'd probably take it but that's mainly just 'cause of the 

463.85 466.11 B: the current status of [laughter] 

466.06 467.05 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

466.36 467.94 B: of my friendship [laughter] 

468.42 475.99 A: yeah if i was if i was in a friendship like that i'd probably take it too if it wasn't going too well and 

475.13 476.18 B: yeah 

477.11 481.72 B: yeah 'cause it's one of those friendships that i've just been thinking a lot recently that 

482.09 484.99 B: why do i still call this person my best friend that 

485.78 486.83 B: (( you know )) 

485.81 487.68 A: yeah 

487.71 493.23 B: i because there's just [mn] so many things that's been wrong about the relationship that 

494.12 495.32 B: i guess it's sort of 

496.23 496.79 A: (( [cough] )) 

496.95 499.38 B: force of habit i guess but [laughter] she's 

499.33 500.38 A: yeah 

499.71 504.46 B: been she's been my best friend for a couple of years so i still think of her that way but 

504.57 505.77 B: i don't think 

505.96 512.50 B: [mn] it's it's not the same relationship as it was a couple of years ago and it's not nearly as close and 

512.90 514.32 A: yeah 

514.51 515.54 B: (( so it's )) 

516.14 521.21 B: it's really probably technically not a best friend [laughter] relationship anymore 

521.11 524.42 A: [laughter] yeah mhm 

524.80 529.71 A: well the question pretty much depends on how your relationship with your best friend is going 

529.96 531.03 B: yeah 

532.65 535.57 B: yeah i don't think it's something that you could say just 

536.71 539.48 B: just totally yes or no 'cause it's 

539.45 542.19 A: (( yeah you'd have to consider everything )) 

542.22 543.29 B: yeah 

543.47 547.72 B: yeah 'cause like i say there you know there i know there there have been times in my life when i 

547.97 554.38 B: [mn] you know felt like i had a really good relationship with somebody and i i i probably would have said no 

554.97 555.92 B: (( so it's )) 

556.54 559.11 B: i guess it's one of those things you have to look at it in the 

559.41 561.54 B: in the context of [laughter] 

561.81 564.13 B: of your current relationship and not 

564.46 567.53 B: not just make a blanket decision that 

567.17 568.97 A: (( and yeah )) 

567.63 570.39 B: this is what i'd do or this is what i wouldn't do 

570.45 573.32 A: yeah 'cause it could change tomorrow or 

574.88 575.95 A: in a month 

576.07 577.39 B: yeah 

577.43 579.06 B: yeah if your best friend 

579.32 585.46 B: does something really bad or all of a sudden [laughter] tomorrow you're no longer friends at all then 

586.23 588.33 A: yeah 

587.19 590.38 B: then it'd be much easier to take the money [laughter] 

590.29 592.50 A: yeah it would 

592.36 593.98 B: what would you do with the money 

594.78 596.52 A: (( uh i don't know )) 

596.41 597.59 B: (( [laughter] okay )) 

597.58 599.89 A: i'd probably save it use some for
