0.21 1.33 B: hi 

0.99 2.08 A: hi 

1.67 2.92 B: (( hi this is colin )) 

3.21 4.24 A: what's your name 

3.88 4.85 B: colin 

4.70 5.69 A: colin 

5.91 6.70 B: yeah 

5.92 7.17 A: how are you today 

6.72 8.06 B: good thanks how're you doing 

7.81 9.93 A: i'm doing well my name is ruth 

9.68 11.10 B: oh hi nice to meet ya 

11.58 14.85 B: so what i see a million dollars is a lot of money 

11.59 12.76 A: (( and i )) 

14.33 16.51 A: know a million dollars is a lot of money 

15.91 18.81 B: yeah but ah i don't know if um 

18.84 24.10 B: i guess that it comes down to making a decision over that or your best friend right 

23.87 25.99 A: yeah money doesn't buy friends 

25.66 40.00 B: yeah there's there's two way- i guess two two good ways to look at it you can either either say okay i'm going to i'm going to leave it all behind and start something new i guess if you're in that kind of situation or if you had friends that you considered you know life long friends then a million dollars probably wouldn't do it 

40.38 41.66 A: that's right 

42.14 47.01 B: but um well we're i guess y- where would you stand on that 

46.16 47.99 A: well i think that um 

48.60 51.47 A: m- money isn't everything [laughter] 

52.21 54.34 B: could you ever see yourself is there any kind of 

52.71 64.83 A: i've i've been in places in my life where i've made a lot of money and i've been at places where i didn't make so much money and i'll tell you what having people around you that you care about is a whole lot more important 

59.35 60.18 B: right 

64.22 73.42 B: right right i guess it's kind of ah i guess a question like that is reminds me a little bit more of like the things that are going on television today like the ones where you you um 

73.88 79.61 B: you know you have to make a decision or you have to sort of cut cut somebody else out or vote them off the island or whatever 

78.80 81.41 A: oh yeah i hate those [laughter] 

79.99 88.15 B: [laughter] but ah i don't i don't really think i could do that either i think it would come down to friendship being more important for me than than any kind of 

86.90 87.93 A: mhm 

88.43 94.85 B: any kind of financial reward but i guess that's the same but ah you know the movies or the show the television shows that they've got going on 

95.08 96.97 B: but i mean there've 

96.83 109.78 B: [mn] i guess there've been times in my life too where i've there are certain people if they if they just said a friend [laughter] then i i i mean there are some people who i have you know been friends with but either grown apart from or they've done something to 

109.61 113.47 B: sort of eliminate them from my circle of trust if you will 

113.23 114.40 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

113.69 114.76 B: but um 

115.04 121.95 B: i i guess a- that's not really the question the question is is would you do it but if we both say no then 

121.96 133.02 B: i don't know i i can't really put myself in the sa- unless something else was like i don't know maybe if a family member was dying or something or i mean it would have to be some sort of crazy circumstantial evid- you know evidence to make me 

132.39 139.72 A: what you're saying you're saying that if the circumstance warranted that you really needed the money for an a a noble cause 

139.89 142.92 A: if it were that might consider that 

140.68 154.83 B: yeah if it yeah if there was something that i mean if it was some sort of a you know life threatening thing for for myself or my family or something like that then i would hope that my friends or you know whoever else would understand but i mean it it would be very hard to live down i guess 

146.14 147.01 A: yeah 

148.19 149.02 A: uh-huh 

154.40 155.64 A: yeah 

155.66 156.94 B: so i guess i can 

156.98 157.64 B: could 

157.07 160.06 A: it would be hard to make that choice i hope i'm never asked to 

159.74 174.56 B: yeah definitely not definitely not although i i think i see a lot of people these days they don't put as much value on that kind of stuff they're willing to put their friends through or and their families through all kinds of stuff and you know just for a couple of bucks or or whatever not even a million dollars 

166.93 167.91 A: mhm 

174.71 178.71 B: but then again a million dollars isn't that much anymore at least it doesn't seem like it is 

178.48 181.90 A: sounds to me like you understand the value of friends and family 

181.55 194.14 B: i try to yeah i mean it i i guess as i've gotten older i've made you know i made some pretty poor decisions when i was younger and whatnot but i think you know the friends that you end up with and i guess i've grown a- apart from a lot of friends 

194.14 203.69 B: you know and then well i guess you have i guess you have to sort of say how how good a friend were they in the first place for them to be able to you know to grow apart or or whatever 

204.25 210.69 B: but i definitely have had some times where i've had to make some pretty harsh decisions on people who i've thought were my friends 

210.53 211.44 A: yeah 

211.00 214.14 B: and they turned out later on people that i knew 

213.17 214.48 A: that they really weren't 

214.15 219.63 B: yeah you know i didn't really know who they were or i thought you know i have a lot of acquaintances but very few friends 

220.14 222.17 B: [laughter] does that make any sense 

220.25 221.37 A: yeah 

221.63 225.99 A: i have a really good friend we've been friends for thirty years probably 

226.25 229.62 A: and um we don't live in the same state any more 

230.06 233.31 A: and i might go months without talking to her 

234.16 235.78 A: and but um 

235.89 243.95 A: one of once one of us picks up the phone the other one said man i was going to call you you were on my mind yesterday [laughter] 

242.51 243.72 B: oh that's weird 

244.05 245.15 A: and ah 

245.26 249.29 A: and it's just like the time just melts away like it never happened 

248.87 253.54 B: mhm well those are the kinds of friendships they're built on on trust i think too you know 

253.07 254.36 A: i think so too 

254.05 256.15 B: ah i've got a a very good friend 

255.02 260.00 A: and i definitely wouldn't take a million dollars over her friendship even though i don't talk to her that often 

259.57 266.94 B: yeah um i'm actually i have ah as i said i don't have as many i have i know a lot of people but i have fewer friends 

266.64 267.52 A: mhm 

266.87 277.33 B: but the friends that i do have i consider them all good friends i don't really have one best friend i have a series of people who in different parts of my life and over the years have become best friends of mine 

270.71 271.52 A: mhm 

277.18 277.96 A: uh-huh 

277.49 287.50 B: you know and i could go to any single one of them and so i don't really have a best friend so when i heard the topic come up i was thinking about four or five people that i know really well who i care for 

281.17 282.02 A: mhm 

285.97 286.82 A: (( mhm don't )) 

287.51 290.62 B: and who you know i probably couldn't cut any of them out of my life 

289.42 291.65 A: you think that's true of most people though 

291.41 292.54 B: yeah 

291.95 295.13 A: that most people know a lot of people but 

295.43 298.76 A: but they are not really cause not they're not all considered the 

298.92 300.40 A: the inner circle 

300.59 305.84 B: yeah yeah that's true that's true as well and i i've actually had that same kind of experience where 

301.72 302.48 A: (( mhm mm )) 

306.00 314.72 B: well it's actually weird you i'll pick up the phone with one of my best friends the one guy i'm thinking of partic- in particular he doesn't live anywhere close to me he lives in canada and ah 

314.48 325.48 B: it's like we never really stop you know it's like the last time i saw him it's still fresh in my mind kind of thing and we'll pick up and then it'll just sort of ease back into that really natural back and forth between 

319.45 320.22 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

325.42 331.80 B: really good friends it doesn't feel like we've spent any time apart even though now he's married with a couple of kids and you know he's he's moving on 

326.32 327.24 A: (( yeah what )) 

331.65 333.06 A: what state are you in 

333.01 334.19 B: pennsylvania 

334.30 335.10 A: oh 

335.11 336.19 B: philadelphia 

336.26 337.51 A: yeah i've been there 

337.27 339.02 B: where where are you at 

338.71 339.69 A: seattle 

339.59 341.36 B: (( seattle i used to live in vancouver )) 

341.19 344.02 A: oh [laughter] it's a small world 

343.42 345.34 B: yeah yeah i spent four years up there 

345.40 348.45 B: actually i spent some time in in seattle as well but ah 

345.61 346.26 A: (( mm )) 

348.62 353.72 B: yeah i i haven't ah haven't been back out for a long time i came out here to do some schooling and ah 

353.07 353.92 A: mhm 

354.09 355.78 B: and have never gone back 

355.73 356.51 A: (( mhm )) 

356.29 359.43 B: but i miss the pacific northwest that's for sure 

359.23 360.29 A: mhm 

359.91 364.08 B: you guys made the news the other day too with ah some sort of disaster training 

364.80 366.82 A: with a oh yes uh-huh 

364.94 365.62 B: there's 

365.95 371.52 B: there was something on the news it's a big huge national thing about disaster preparedness and seattle was taking big steps and 

368.26 369.25 A: yeah 

370.98 373.17 A: they're still ah they're still doing it 

372.98 373.84 B: are they 

373.64 376.60 A: i think today's the last day they're just winding it up 

376.41 379.46 B: it's funny though i don't necessarily think of seattle as the 

379.88 382.04 B: target of terror i guess you know what i mean 

382.27 385.32 A: well it's because we're a port city and vulnerable 

383.89 384.87 B: yeah 

385.08 388.04 B: [mn] and there was that scare i guess back in new year's a few year's ago 

388.17 390.73 B: at ah was it the millenium turnover 

390.62 391.75 A: mhm 

391.12 393.44 B: they didn't have the big celebrations and stuff 

393.56 394.61 B: at the needle 

393.69 394.51 A: mhm 

394.55 395.51 A: yeah 

396.32 397.12 A: (( uh-huh mm )) 

397.45 411.70 B: well philadelphia's got a lot of ah older history and got a lot of the things that go on here that made the constitution in the you know the bell and and the declaration of independence is held here so they they have a lot of security here and you can definitely definitely feel it but 

400.24 401.17 A: mhm 

405.03 406.04 A: mhm 

412.36 416.31 B: i think it's um is this is this your first call or how many calls have you have you done 

415.64 417.69 A: um this is the second one 

417.41 420.06 B: yeah this is my first call actually 

419.98 420.84 A: (( mhm yes )) 

420.23 424.45 B: i've ah haven't had a chance to do them before i always find it interesting too because 

424.50 427.51 B: it's hard to talk about one thing for ten minutes unless there's 

427.31 428.76 A: isn't it 

428.13 438.78 B: more l- well unless there's more to talk about they've give us the you know a choice yes or no i mean if you ah if you want to talk about politics i can give you my you know point of view and we can talk about this now but 

433.23 434.01 A: yeah 

436.60 437.22 A: (( [laughter] )) 

438.18 442.72 A: and we've ah kind of exhausted the point of the million dollars 

442.12 443.35 B: [laughter] 

442.75 444.96 A: being pretty much in agreement on it 

444.55 455.86 B: yeah exactly there's there's really nothing i think i would end up doing for cash like that i don't think i could put myself in the situation i don't think i could where i don't think i could really justify any kind of good friendship 

454.82 457.02 A: and i also think that you've 

457.29 461.58 A: sometimes you really don't know what you do it what what you would do 

462.52 470.12 A: until the situation presents itself and sometimes you you think you might think that you would and then when it comes you really have to 

464.69 465.50 B: (( true )) 

471.55 473.33 A: really have to think about it 

472.94 474.41 B: yeah well and when you put 

473.74 476.14 A: i don't think i would have to think about it a lot 

475.39 484.03 B: it's true and when you put something like a best friend on the line that you really you know what what's the value of a million dollars you're going to spend it who are you going to spend it with you know what kind of 

478.12 479.22 A: yeah 

480.91 481.78 A: yeah 

483.82 484.94 A: yeah 

484.24 486.45 B: ah friends are you going to end up having or whatever 

485.88 487.44 A: right exactly right 

488.43 492.36 B: but in the end i mean you're is not like you're going going to get new friends out of a million dollars 

492.98 505.55 B: but i don't know i mean i think if it was i think if it was life threatening as i said before i think that is the only way i mean if there's something like that but i mean it would be such a bizarre situa- situation you know it's almost like would you give your own life to save somebody else 

493.02 493.85 A: mhm 

498.48 499.31 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

502.27 503.02 A: yeah 

505.46 506.74 A: mhm 

505.92 509.20 B: and some people say well it depends on the situation or or whatever 

509.47 512.50 B: you know i could certainly see it but then at the same time you'd have to be 

512.68 514.35 A: faced with it and then you'd 

513.51 515.96 B: yeah pretty much 

514.92 520.32 A: it's real easy to watch something on television and say well that jerk i never would have done that [laughter] 

519.57 521.11 B: yeah right 

520.67 522.43 A: or what's the matter with that person 

522.20 527.52 B: yeah right how do you feel about all these other television shows like mr personality and the batchelor and stuff like that do 

526.94 529.05 A: oh i just think they're really stupid 

528.59 530.54 B: you watch them 

529.66 530.53 A: no 

530.98 532.98 B: ever get sucked into them at all um 

532.38 533.30 A: no 

533.55 535.54 A: i don't have time [laughter] 

534.39 536.65 B: no me neither i i i just find them 

536.88 538.13 B: think it's easy it's 

537.06 538.47 A: they're just stupid 

538.19 539.89 B: a bigger waste of time than 

539.58 540.67 A: yeah 

540.07 541.84 B: television is in the first place 

541.74 542.55 A: (( yeah i )) 

542.15 548.87 B: and especially for stuff that you know it's promoting something that doesn't really exist that kind of fantasy was it the joe millionaire 

547.56 548.55 A: like to 

548.83 560.02 B: where a guy comes riding in on a horse i saw the commercial for it i'm thinking to myself there's all these young impressionable kids who are thinking that that's the way it is you know what i mean or or that that's kind of how it should be and so that's not right it's a fairy tale 

548.89 550.10 A: i like to watch 

551.42 552.28 A: uh-huh 

555.66 556.61 A: mhm 

559.21 560.80 A: yeah and it's just stupid 

560.24 564.40 B: if you want a if you [laughter] want a princess then you can rent a rent a disney movie [laughter] 

565.90 567.86 A: mhm 

568.74 571.06 A: [noise] that's what i think too [mn] [noise] 

572.09 577.83 B: well then you've got yourself a [laughter] pretty good moral ah moral compass there i think 

578.27 580.16 B: what ah what do you do for a living 

580.51 582.66 A: ah actually i'm a housewife 

582.30 583.15 B: okay 

583.35 589.19 B: i'm ah well i was a student now i work for a a university in the philadelphia area
