0.83 7.37 A: hello my name is carole and i live on the east coast and it's a pleasure to speak with you today 

6.92 9.68 B: hi my name is lisa i'm also on the east coast 

10.27 13.87 A: well then i guess we know about the school public school system 

13.89 22.33 A: on the east coast i don't know how it differs from um the middle of the country of the west coast but i assume there are a lot of the same problems 

21.91 24.65 B: i think so where are you on the east coast 

24.37 26.19 A: uh in philadelphia 

25.54 27.33 B: philadelphia okay i'm in connecticut 

27.22 28.45 A: (( oh okay )) 

28.62 42.99 A: um there is a serious problem in the philadelphia schools and has been for some time um a dear friend of mine just retired as a second grade teacher in the public school system after thirty years 

42.91 51.08 A: and she was just worn out completely worn out and in philadelphia i mean they really have no funding for the kids 

49.86 53.63 B: mhm we have the same situation here it's terrible 

53.26 62.48 A: well i just think that um i'm a product myself of the parochial school system and private school system but um 

62.54 75.87 A: because i know her so intimately and others so intimately i think the problem began years ago when um they asked the schools to be a restaurant for the uh breakfast and lunch programs 

75.95 88.09 A: and then they asked the teachers to um mainstream kids with learning disabilities and then they asked the teachers to do all kinds of extracurricular stuff 

82.68 83.76 B: mhm 

88.19 94.14 A: and then uh the teachers wound up not being able to discipline children 

94.22 101.07 A: and the parent teacher associations fell apart and uh i 

98.77 99.53 B: yeah 

101.09 104.85 A: i just think that there's got to be a release 

104.95 114.71 A: for um the teachers themselves because my friend who's in second grade said she can't teach she's got thirty two in her class 

111.76 113.17 B: i i agree 

114.21 119.06 B: wow now here in our town our schools have about twenty two 

119.28 129.13 B: but they they do their mainstream children with learning disabilities and also unfortunately we don't have a gifted and talented program that's very effective so we have quite a mess 

121.42 122.19 A: yes 

129.26 134.05 B: and with our budget cuts a lot of the parent educators and teachers' aides were all let go 

134.24 135.29 A: oh 

134.27 138.36 B: so now our teachers are forced to to kinda wear all the hats 

138.55 143.15 A: yes and they have twenty two in a class and are by themselves right 

138.58 139.82 B: and uh it's 

142.38 143.81 B: by the- right 

143.71 149.30 A: yes well she had thirty two in a class by herself seven of whom 

149.73 161.82 A: uh were seriously disturbed or um learning disabled children one of them picked up a desk and threw it at her they're about sh- he was that big and that strong 

161.45 162.69 B: oh 

162.56 171.10 A: and i mean she's she she loved teaching and she was initially a first grade teacher and they promoted her 

171.04 178.88 A: but e- even in the school system in philadelphia the buildings themselves at certain times they had no hot water 

179.08 187.89 A: uh they certainly weren't fit for warm weather classes they had heat but warm weather and they had no books 

185.40 186.52 B: mhm 

188.28 191.38 A: hardly any books and [mn] 

191.53 195.61 A: you know not enough of the teachers' um 

195.64 209.65 A: needs were met she used to buy a lot of things herself and bring them to class and i just don't know like i know that the philadelphia school system is heavy in administration 

201.96 203.14 B: wow 

209.40 211.41 B: mhm 

210.54 213.42 A: and not so heavy in um 

213.68 225.75 A: you know the actual teachers' aides or something like that in a classroom because that's so tiring all day you know how kids get wound up and uh and and just need attention 

218.58 219.53 B: right 

222.99 224.38 B: (( oh i certainly do )) 

225.27 232.63 B: [laughter] i do i'm a girl scout leader and actually i have two troops and i see that a lot of these kids are starving for attention 

228.04 229.42 A: oh you are 

232.73 233.70 A: yes 

232.79 241.02 B: and and a lot of them i mean i don't know where they get their manners from but i couldn't imagine spending an entire day by myself with thirty two 

241.20 242.15 B: kids 

242.29 243.13 A: right 

242.37 245.10 B: under those circumstances that's it's crazy 

245.39 250.20 A: how involved are the parents in connecticut with the public school system are you aware 

250.11 264.38 B: um i think you know the rule th- the eighty twenty rule that you know eighty per cent of the work is done by twenty per cent of the people i i think that's pretty much the situation there are some people who are so very involved and and there are a lot of people who just aren't 

257.03 257.97 A: okay 

264.53 265.53 A: (( uh-huh )) 

265.95 267.10 A: um 

267.41 276.34 A: do you have any uh racial differences in your uh philadelphia i mean in your uh school system is that a problem 

276.10 277.42 B: it's not 

276.43 279.76 A: be it with with any kind of minority 

279.83 280.95 B: not 

279.90 283.27 A: i'm not familiar with the connecticut um make up 

282.75 288.51 B: not really and i'm we live in a small town a relatively small town um 

285.83 286.87 A: uh-huh 

288.81 293.76 B: just recently turning slightly suburban but but not really um 

292.80 293.80 A: right 

293.78 296.99 B: wi- mostly white people 

297.08 298.06 A: uh-huh 

297.68 299.45 B: uh not very diverse 

299.61 300.59 A: okay 

300.00 306.28 B: uh right now anyway and there's you know a little bit of diversity but not a whole lot 

302.17 302.92 A: yes 

305.75 306.77 A: (( uh-huh )) 

306.41 308.97 B: not a whole lot the people in our town have 

307.59 320.96 A: well say in the philadelphia school system because there's there's so many parochial schools here um picks up a lot of the slack but now they're charging about a thousand dollars a year and people just can't afford that 

320.91 330.55 A: but in in the public school it's mostly black and hispanic and there is a problem with kids coming to school um 

320.92 322.13 B: wow 

330.82 332.16 A: (( armed )) 

332.60 343.22 A: you know with this something and even years ago i remember um i lived uh and worked right near the university of pennsylvania campus 

333.16 334.24 B: yeah 

343.21 354.55 A: and this had to be twenty five years ago where i wasn't allowed to go and use the film lab that we had access to without being escorted by a man 

354.46 355.96 B: (( wow wow )) 

354.64 361.71 A: and you had to pass through uh a police check on your way into school this was twenty five years ago 

361.72 365.76 A: and i just think to myself how can we begin 

365.79 368.56 A: to even set the stage for learning 

369.30 376.65 A: when the security is a is the immediate problem before you even walk in the door 

376.14 377.25 B: you're right 

377.08 389.63 A: for both teachers and kids i just i just don't understand how we can't initially deal with that and i don't know whether the system is see 

389.77 403.38 A: in the parochial school system if you have a child who was disrupting others from learning you know and just a disruptive influence the parochial school system was allowed to send these kids to reform school 

398.53 399.40 B: mhm 

403.32 404.78 B: wow 

404.36 417.85 A: they went to reform school and i don't know whether or not the public school system needs a lower level where you really would put kids who are disruptive or have a problem 

418.00 421.10 A: you know and i don't mean all the learning disability kids 

420.70 423.45 B: mhm but the disruptive ones 

421.29 425.70 A: but you know some- somewhere where they would 

425.85 431.88 A: get the legal education to which they're entitled but allowing the rest of the class 

432.17 441.90 A: to proceed because she was saying that she would give her attention to maybe five to seven kids in her class or at most eight 

441.45 442.53 B: mhm 

441.92 444.24 A: and the others would be on their own 

444.00 454.08 B: i see that a lot now my daughter recently had a situation where um she was in a class where the teacher used to teach transitional but our school system did away with that so she 

453.11 454.78 A: what's transitional 

454.18 464.70 B: that is for children who aren't quite ready for first grade but already finished kindergarten so they kind of they they stay back a year but they're in a transition phase 

459.70 460.77 A: okay 

461.39 462.39 A: okay 

463.45 465.70 A: mhm mhm 

464.92 469.18 B: and um our school system had tried it for a while and did away with it 

469.32 475.22 B: but what they ended up doing was grouping a lot of the difficult kids in this one class 

475.66 482.89 B: and since this teacher had special training and apparently was the only one who did they gave her anyone who didn't fit in the mainstream 

483.06 490.34 B: so she had two children who had diabetes she had severe learning disabilities she had english as a second language 

490.48 491.52 B: um 

492.52 495.70 B: a few gifted children and anyone who didn't fit in 

496.00 497.99 B: got stuck in this class 

498.21 505.15 B: and uh it it was a terrible situation because she just she couldn't handle it she couldn't give everyone the attention that they needed 

498.45 499.29 A: wow 

503.54 506.62 A: she wasn't trained to handle all those demands 

506.15 514.44 B: well she [laughter] she was trained to handle special situations but unfortunately she had all different special situations and she couldn't give anyone 

512.75 513.69 A: yes 

514.51 521.31 B: the attention that they needed if she spent her time with the child who couldn't speak english well everyone else was sitting 

514.65 515.54 A: yes 

522.22 523.25 B: and waiting 

523.57 529.12 B: so um it had gotten to the point where my daughter had to leave the classroom to go for special reading classes 

528.90 530.25 A: mhm 

529.66 532.70 B: because uh she wasn't doing anything she was sitting 

533.09 533.90 A: yes 

534.22 540.61 B: and uh you know it was a terrible thing for pretty you know pretty much everyone in there they they spent a lot of time waiting 

540.79 542.07 B: instead of learning 

540.99 541.84 A: (( right )) 

542.10 554.58 A: right what do you think you're talking about the classes for gifted i remember a at a certain point in my life i remember they did have advanced classes for the a students 

554.61 567.49 A: ah and junior and senior year especially i'm not sure whether it extended all the way down to sophomore to get them really prepared to compete for college entrance and college scholarships 

567.11 568.17 B: mhm 

568.11 575.69 A: is that still in effect in the public school system are you aware or is that just target schools 

575.81 582.66 B: uh we do have advanced placement courses which you can take for college credits when you get into the high school 

580.73 581.81 A: uh-huh 

582.71 590.52 B: and in the lower grades anyone who is very advanced um there's a program that serves one per cent of our school system 

590.67 591.75 A: mhm 

591.18 596.17 B: which means in our case uh for the second grade they would pick two children 

596.26 597.42 A: uh-huh 

596.38 599.90 B: out of the second grade who would be allowed to go for enrichment classes
