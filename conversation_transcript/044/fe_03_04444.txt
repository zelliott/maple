12.01 13.70 B: oh uh-huh 

13.47 14.03 A: (( [mn] )) 

14.11 18.13 B: and uh we we have a very interesting topic [laughter] 

17.45 18.74 A: yeah we do 

18.41 24.02 B: yeah i- it seems that um everything seems to be wrong with the school system 

20.79 21.53 A: (( [noise] )) 

24.30 25.16 A: well 

24.46 30.64 B: and and they seem to be cutting the arts and music b- before anything else 

30.17 44.15 A: yeah and it also i'm just i'm only three years out of high school and i attended a public school and what what's happening at our public school we used to like different public schools with different tax bases get different educations 

44.73 46.45 B: right right 

45.66 50.04 A: so it's a very unfair advantage even though it should be equal for everyone 

50.38 53.43 B: but actually it's it's never equal [laughter] 

52.83 55.82 A: yeah never could be um 

53.55 60.00 B: yeah it's it never but w- where schools uh overcrowded you know the classes you attended 

59.87 70.59 A: no i went to a i was in a smaller area so no but [lipsmack] from living in atlanta now seeing some kids who came from public schools here they have very overcrowded schools 

70.54 77.04 B: and um well my my sister now is uh is a teacher in in new york and she said 

77.15 82.16 B: [cough] excuse me with some summer vacation coming up the kids are really getting crazy 

81.96 83.24 A: oh i bet 

82.18 86.41 B: and and that there's there's n- no way to really uh 

86.52 88.22 B: calm them down 

88.03 89.07 A: yeah 

88.37 92.84 B: out- outside of letting them roam free but you don't have the space 

92.78 94.24 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

93.37 99.00 B: you know uh so that is another um subject that's severely cut 

97.64 99.69 A: getting cut yeah 

99.18 103.09 B: and and you know w- with all the fat people now in um 

104.16 108.38 B: in the united states they really should be doing something about it [laughter] 

107.82 113.61 A: yeah they should really be teaching people how to live healthy lifestyles it should be an important part of a curriculum 

111.22 112.46 B: right 

113.81 124.77 B: absolutely d- do you know when i went to when yugoslavia was yugoslavia i was on a trip and they had stadiums built and kids were 

118.29 119.29 A: yeah 

124.82 128.21 B: just going full blast enjoying themselves 

127.96 129.22 A: i bet 

128.96 132.93 B: and it wasn't mandatory it it was something that they really wanted to do 

132.87 133.89 A: yeah 

133.33 138.51 B: yeah do you think the the computer is keeping them um 

139.28 152.71 A: i think the computer like works kinda a little bit in both ways actually sometimes i feel that it's it's a good way to teach it's it's also a good way to waste time for people to sit in front them and do nothing 

146.17 147.27 B: right 

149.33 150.86 B: oh yes 

152.40 153.58 B: right 

152.64 157.72 A: like sometimes their educational qualities get overshadowed by their 

157.59 162.79 B: right yeah so you were allowed you used the computer when you uh attended school i'm sure 

161.90 167.64 A: well yeah a little bit not all not a whole lot to be perfectly honest not until i was in high school 

162.84 163.66 B: yeah 

167.45 172.26 B: uh-huh now were were you allow- when you took a test were you allowed to um 

172.41 175.61 B: um bring a calculator with you 

175.28 184.37 A: yeah well depending on the math when we took calculus we didn't we weren't allowed to use calculators but when we were taking like trigonometry we were using calculators 

177.01 177.91 B: oh 

183.50 187.11 B: right no but when i went it was all manual 

186.93 188.43 A: oh yeah [laughter] 

187.42 196.94 B: [laughter] we got no choice and uh now d- do you think it affects um [lipsmack] uh the adding and subtracting ability 

189.49 190.60 A: yeah 

196.66 197.66 A: well [lipsmack] 

197.28 200.63 B: by by just using a calculator all the time 

200.51 211.30 A: i mean it it definitely does i don't think people i don't think i'm quite as quick as maybe my parents are at doing stuff in my head but at the same time like i still add subtract and do all these things fine 

211.09 215.62 A: but when it comes to you know looking at signs and cosigns in tables 

215.13 216.23 B: mm 

215.63 223.03 A: it kinda just makes sense to use a calculator because if you're ever gonna do that at this time in your life you're gonna have a calculator with you 

222.76 225.88 B: you have to do it i mean you you have to go with the flow 

225.49 229.33 A: yeah it's like moving on like you're gonna be using computers so 

228.77 233.07 B: i'm oh they're they're here to stay [laughter] there's not no no 

231.06 233.16 A: yeah but it's kinda 

233.14 240.42 B: no doubt about that in fact you know i i do writing and uh i i wanted to 

240.69 251.66 B: check to see if i can get a portable typewriter and i went into a very large store they didn't know what a typewriter was [laughter] it was the the weirdest thing really uh 

247.76 249.50 A: [laughter] 

250.05 251.46 A: yeah 

251.52 254.80 A: and so you'll find it in like an antique shop or something 

254.58 259.19 B: yeah that's what i'll have to do i know [laughter] or get a computer 

256.24 257.14 A: [laughter] 

258.96 260.15 A: yeah 

259.54 261.67 B: i'm i'm gonna in in that direction 

261.54 263.79 A: yeah absolutely 

262.21 263.26 B: yeah 

263.28 268.19 B: yeah well we [cough] we used c- computers in the travel agency when i was working 

267.80 269.07 A: oh yeah 

268.44 269.35 B: in there 

269.36 271.39 B: and the airline computer 

271.68 274.04 B: [lipsmack] which w- was different 

273.88 275.20 A: yeah 

274.82 279.68 B: but uh like everything else they're trying to put the airlines out of business you 

279.66 281.22 A: yeah absolutely 

280.24 281.26 B: know 

281.36 285.82 B: and uh the same thing with travel agents they don't wanna pay the commission [mn] 

285.42 287.04 A: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

286.41 291.02 B: right right now how large were your classes when you attended school 

287.29 288.60 A: (( y- yeah )) 

290.16 297.68 A: uh they were small i mean probably twenty kids my high school was very small though i only graduated with about a hundred and eighty students 

296.99 308.64 B: oh my gosh i was i was in a a very progressive public school and um once a week they gave us a choice of taking 

298.54 299.39 A: (( right )) 

309.14 312.91 B: s- of picking something that we wanted to do like going swimming 

313.33 314.46 A: oh really 

313.40 321.42 B: it's in midtown manhattan in a hotel or um playing baseball you had all these choices and this was a public school 

321.06 322.65 A: yeah 

322.14 327.05 B: and it worked beautifully but i i guess they can't afford it now 

326.89 330.54 A: yeah i mean it's all just always coming down to a money issue 

327.56 328.41 B: (( you know )) 

330.24 333.43 B: it's always money i know i know 

330.63 331.21 A: (( it )) 

331.85 337.04 A: yeah and it just seems like they're investing their money in a lot of their own places 

336.79 338.38 B: right be- 

336.95 342.87 A: like over investing in athletics athletics is very important and i played sports in high school but they're 

342.69 357.45 A: investing in athletics and not investing in i mean i had a physics book from nineteen sixty or something like that [mn] and they built a new football stadium and i'm using a book that has like i mean it's just it's so outdated it wasn't even funny [mn] 

348.51 350.00 B: (( yeah right )) 

356.91 358.11 B: mm 

358.35 368.03 B: [lipsmack] well you you can't you can't help it you know you know what it is a lot a lot of these people who are in charge don't know anything about whether what they're in charge for 

360.92 361.91 A: yeah 

367.72 380.48 A: yeah i think the school board actually is kind of a bad like idea i mean it's good to have public office but a school board a school like a multi million dollar company run by publicly elected officials you know 

373.62 374.59 B: right 

379.45 381.19 B: right i think that's wrong 

380.82 388.08 A: well like no business would ever let um publicly elected people manage millions and millions of dollars 

387.66 390.73 B: that that is absolutely you're absolutely right 

390.10 398.01 A: they need to bring in like real professionals and pay them to manage the money and to make decisions it should like yeah c._e._o.'s in companies [noise] 

397.84 399.32 B: absolutely 

399.47 407.43 B: [laughter] somebody who's qualified should be in charge not not just somebody's brother in law sister or law because they that they know somebody 

401.62 403.16 A: yeah not just 

404.89 405.89 A: yeah 

407.20 408.14 A: yeah 

407.69 413.61 B: but that's uh you know may- maybe that's the way it it functions all over who knows [laughter] 

412.94 419.99 A: yeah i mean it would be it would be nice to have the know that your you know school's being run and your money's not being squandered 

419.80 423.13 B: i know and how much is going in their pockets 

423.02 423.90 A: yeah 

423.52 436.50 B: that's the thing also i remember um my my brother was a teacher and when they get when they had to buy athletic equipment they used to get about two or three bids from different companies 

423.95 424.51 A: (( [mn] )) 

436.64 439.87 B: and um there was no monkey business going on 

439.49 440.90 A: yeah 

440.44 449.06 B: and they always picked the best qualified company not because it was somebody's brother in law you know [laughter] 

444.65 445.91 A: yeah 

446.93 448.02 A: yeah 

448.41 450.00 A: yeah that's good 

449.62 452.38 B: yeah that's that's the the way they do it 

452.76 461.60 B: [mn] well you know sometimes um of course in a private school you're gonna get more individual attention it stands to reason 

453.02 453.58 A: (( [mn] )) 

459.57 460.69 A: yeah 

461.94 469.45 B: i know i i took a um summer course one time at a um private school and i said oh this is a 

469.63 470.86 B: you had about 

470.90 473.01 B: ten kids in the class 

472.30 473.73 A: yeah [laughter] 

473.35 481.01 B: it it was so easy i said my god you know and and in the public schools of course you had at least twenty twenty five 

474.98 476.00 A: yeah 

480.55 483.66 A: yeah it's much different 

481.37 482.42 B: yeah so 

482.72 485.38 B: but you know the changes are gonna come 

485.49 486.80 B: they're slow 

485.71 487.49 A: yeah hopefully 

486.92 490.51 B: you know and it always gets worse b- b- before it gets better 

490.23 500.62 A: yeah and i just don't i mean i think there's i think they have priorities mixed up if they think money is the problem i think a lot of these schools have enough money they just don't prioritize where they put it 

500.07 501.70 B: (( that's it )) 

501.32 508.44 A: i think they're messing up i mean like our school they're more funded than like ninety percent of the schools throughout the world yet we still don't 

508.97 511.60 A: do as well i mean there's something 

510.42 515.22 B: no i remember foreign kids who would come over 

515.30 517.10 B: and didn't speak english 

516.88 517.85 A: yeah 

517.18 521.28 B: well within a very short time they were skipping 

521.45 523.47 B: they were more advanced 

523.55 524.93 A: yeah 

524.30 528.51 B: i i think many times that the the kids here are kept 

528.76 530.49 B: uh and treated 

530.66 532.00 B: as babies 

531.77 533.46 A: yeah absolutely 

532.93 538.71 B: you know whereas the the european and the the oriental kids would come over they'd they'd be so mature 

538.49 539.67 A: yeah they have like a 

538.82 540.78 B: as soon as they mastered english 

540.58 544.99 A: yeah and they're very cultural there's big cultural differences the way that 

543.98 549.07 B: oh yeah yeah the the parents stand behind them you know and push 

548.72 550.05 A: yeah 

549.51 551.44 B: also very important 

551.50 552.51 A: and it's just get- 

551.50 559.64 B: i remember my chinese friend you know the mother and father [laughter] used to stand over her and say you don't go out until you do your homework 

556.24 556.81 A: (( [mn] )) 

559.02 560.44 A: yeah 

559.89 564.05 B: you know and now with you know it's difficult with both parents working 

563.80 565.28 A: yeah 

564.74 570.16 B: really so how how do you keep um every every k- every kid in line 

569.93 571.45 A: (( yeah impossible )) 

570.41 571.42 B: you can't 

571.70 572.65 A: (( impos- )) 

571.89 575.78 B: and then every school is so different florida and new york you know 

575.69 577.51 A: yeah 

576.57 580.89 B: it's it's it's rough if a kid goes comes from from one uh state 

580.91 585.48 A: even like just different cities in the same state like 

580.95 582.17 B: into another 

584.93 587.44 B: right even cities right you've got 

586.57 597.03 A: like even like from where i lived you know where we lived in philadelphia if we'd had stayed in philly i would've had to go to a p- p- private school [mn] because when i was at public schools were just horrible 

593.17 594.20 B: (( mm )) 

597.02 599.95 B: yeah well you know happened a lot of p-
