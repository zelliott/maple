2.80 5.84 B: i'm stacey from inner pittsburgh 

5.12 13.59 A: hi i'm rod roderick i live in new york city how ya doing [lipsmack] so i guess uh we get to talk about problems in the school system 

6.74 9.42 B: (( [noise] all right )) 

12.77 14.69 B: our public schools 

13.99 14.95 A: yes 

15.39 16.41 B: yes 

16.13 21.27 A: well i guess the first thing i could i i saw the thing on obesity [laughter] in terms of like 

19.90 20.89 B: [laughter] 

21.56 26.95 A: uh corporate sponsorships like you know selling bad food and stuff in the school 

27.10 33.58 A: um but at the same time they're also like providing books and other things at like the the local government isn't doing 

34.17 37.31 A: so it's kinda a weird dilemma i don't know [cough] 

37.13 40.68 B: yeah but i i think that there's needs to be more emphasis 

41.09 42.53 B: (( put on )) 

42.78 45.20 B: retaining the knowledge that that's they're given 

45.49 47.70 B: um you get kids that [cough] 

48.73 57.15 B: they don't they blow half the school school term they don't do complete assignments they fail tests but they're still given 

57.60 58.98 B: they still passed 

58.37 63.57 A: [noise] [lipsmack] is that because like do you think it's 'cause like there's overcrowding in the school and they the teachers can't 

63.75 69.94 A: give one on one so it it gets to the point where you're just like all right fine go ahead go through the school system 

69.35 74.93 B: no i don't think it's that i think it's more that they just want to shove you through 

76.17 77.36 A: [cough] mm 

76.57 77.45 B: (( you know )) 

77.71 78.84 B: um 

79.83 81.02 B: it's 

81.90 83.63 B: i know 

83.76 85.78 B: see my son teaches at a 

86.21 88.14 B: at a uh technical school 

87.25 89.51 A: mhm 

88.77 91.28 B: and they wanna take and just 

91.65 103.44 B: if these kids are sent to their home schools and the the oth- the technical school loses money well we don't wanna send we don't wanna be losing money but you're you're not training these kids 

96.91 98.60 A: mhm 

104.42 107.18 B: you know you're you're letting them come in and play games 

106.54 109.91 A: do you think there should be like more regulation of the teachers and stuff like that 

108.13 118.70 B: yeah yeah they need to take it and have more quality education rather than i guess kinda quantity education where they're sending 

114.04 116.37 A: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

119.29 124.70 B: everything you know where where they're doing everything and just kinda slide them through 

124.92 131.05 B: where you know you've gotta teach teach kids to be able to do more than say you went through high school 

132.34 133.06 B: you 

133.79 136.54 A: so do you think the teachers so you think the teachers are at fault then 

133.92 134.84 B: (( know )) 

137.76 140.21 B: no i think it's more the administrators 

139.61 141.19 A: mhm 

140.23 150.67 B: because teachers say that we've got a problem here and the administrators don't do anything about it you know don't do anything to back the teachers up the teachers need to take and and add the discipline 

146.72 148.09 A: (( [lipsmack] yep )) 

150.79 152.06 B: of 

152.22 155.26 B: if you don't take and pass this test you don't you don't go on 

154.89 156.82 A: mhm 

155.94 169.19 B: you know for fear of of showing my age here when i was in school and you didn't you sloughed off the majority of the year you didn't pass a test that you needed to take you didn't do homework guess what you didn't [laughter] go on with e- everybody else 

169.33 172.09 B: you stayed and and had to do it again 

171.32 174.05 A: mhm i have the feeling that sometimes it has to do with like um 

174.72 176.45 A: [lipsmack] it's almost like some sort of like 

177.29 185.71 A: thinking maybe there's some sort of quota thing going on where a certain percentage of children have to like get through or they won't get a certain amount of funding 'cause you know 

184.75 186.87 B: you know what that could very well be 

185.95 188.75 A: 'cause i've seen like on sixty minutes before where like you know 

189.42 204.19 A: they hassle you and like you know if there's something if a certain kid um a certain amount aren't passing it kinda like makes everyone think you know look twice at their school and then they get red flagged and you know they don't get as much money as the schools do for sports whatever kinda things that are supposed to be going on 

204.00 204.64 A: (( you know )) 

204.20 208.97 B: yeah but you know and people that are giving out the money they oughta 

205.07 206.48 A: (( mhm )) 

209.02 212.52 B: something oughta take a click and say wait a minute 

212.88 221.02 B: if this maybe this school is yeah they they're not having the percentage of kids go through but the ones that are going on 

214.61 215.33 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

221.39 224.12 B: are really pretty smart they know what they're doing 

224.86 235.04 B: you know maybe we get more bang for our buck back on something like this and the school districts that just kinda slough kids through so they can get more money for sports or whatever they're doing 

235.28 240.05 B: well somebody will sit up and notice and say hey wait a minute we're not getting money here how's come 

239.33 249.39 A: mhm well there was i guess i guess like what happens is if that school doesn't get any money most of those kids are like either they just either dropped out and they just they're swept to another school 

250.10 250.93 A: (( you know )) 

250.61 255.92 B: well then again it goes back to the administrators saying no wait a minute we need to take and have a quality 

251.01 251.94 A: (( [cough] )) 

252.89 253.88 A: mhm 

256.14 264.21 B: the administrators and the school board you know maybe it goes even further up to the board school the school board's really the ones that dictate what goes on 

258.35 260.04 A: yeah 

263.85 265.89 A: yeah totally 

265.23 269.62 B: and if the school board's saying wait we're losing money here what's going on 

269.41 270.64 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

270.05 271.14 B: or 

271.32 275.45 B: how's come these kids are failures at what they're doing you 

274.81 276.93 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

276.98 278.61 B: know or their 

278.71 279.73 B: (( um )) 

280.31 282.17 B: their s. a. t. scores are 

282.27 283.98 B: in the lower half you 

284.84 289.42 B: know and they're they're not where they should be for this region 

290.08 291.91 B: why is that 

291.22 298.10 A: mhm i'm trying to figure out like whether or not the somehow like some sort of like after school programs that work in that kinda environment or 

299.35 303.28 A: where they could like you could do more one on one with the kids who actually wanna learn 

303.55 305.03 B: (( well you know )) 

303.81 304.79 A: and then 

305.85 310.44 B: as as we s- as you and i sit here talking about this i just wonder if it even goes back 

310.71 312.74 B: even further to the parents you know 

313.79 322.46 A: well it could it could 'cause like sometimes you know like sometimes parents are working a lot and you don't have a lotta time for supervision and all that kinda stuff [cough] [noise] or at 

320.55 322.98 B: yeah and and the parents aren't teaching 

323.87 329.63 B: the discipline that that the kid needs to take 'em and say well wait a minute i've gotta do this homework 

329.04 333.85 A: least give some like the kids the the initiative to like wanna do it you know what i mean 

332.22 333.07 B: right 

333.91 339.21 B: like you know maybe maybe it even goes back to their parents need to take some responsibility 

338.85 344.41 A: yep or like or if there is like some sort of like emphasis on schooling you know what i mean 

344.73 350.69 A: even if you're not around 'cause like my parents weren't around that much but like i still had the desire to go to school and i did fairly well you know just because 

350.98 357.13 A: either a. i wanted to like not be a loser or b. i wanted to be like hey i i can do this thing you know check this out [lipsmack] 

357.19 364.87 A: so and if you don't care you know what i mean you know if the parents don't give a crap then it's just not gonna why why should you care you know 

357.20 358.46 B: yeah and and 

364.71 369.12 B: yeah yeah and that that's seems like it 

365.57 366.35 A: (( [cough] mm )) 

369.43 371.38 B: like it's it's a very very 

371.88 374.06 B: plausible problem 

374.16 375.53 B: (( you know plausible )) 

376.08 382.24 A: i mean i think i i do think that a lot of parents need to get more involved in like the after school programs or like even like the 

376.26 377.38 B: (( part of the problem )) 

383.46 396.85 A: or like you know one on one with the teachers even with the administrators like you know sometimes if like they can't they see that their student can't still spell apple yet he's still getting a.'s in spelling i mean that that should be like an eye opener you know what i mean 

396.40 398.01 B: yeah 

397.29 401.11 A: [cough] or you then start asking questions about that kinda thing 

400.60 404.06 B: yeah i i know how how my parents were with me 

403.70 405.48 A: mhm 

404.17 405.49 B: and 

405.83 413.90 B: my you know my parents were old school you know i'd be the first to tell you that that when i came home from school it was you crack the books 

408.25 410.60 A: yeah mm 

413.37 415.52 A: (( mhm [cough] )) 

414.36 415.18 B: and 

415.32 418.30 B: you didn't get you didn't do anything else until you get done 

417.40 419.74 A: mhm 

419.45 422.22 B: (( and you know come )) 

422.65 426.62 B: track session when when i was on the track team that was really kinda tough 

426.28 428.06 A: mhm 

427.03 437.22 B: [cough] or when i was when i played basketball but you know it it got me that i wanna sit you know if i gotta do it i gotta do 

436.98 438.51 A: yeah 

437.26 442.77 B: it just sit down and and get get started and get done and you know the sooner i get started the sooner you get it over with 

442.85 446.86 B: and we my wife and i tried to do the same thing with our kids 

446.15 448.46 A: (( mhm yeah [cough] )) 

447.79 454.00 B: you know and they can sit and well let's see your homework and and always take and be able to 

451.59 454.49 A: (( [mn] )) 

454.83 458.84 B: offer some help if you need to if you can well wait a minute you try 

456.56 458.42 A: mhm 

458.80 459.83 A: [cough] 

459.64 469.99 B: if you're having a problem here think about what you're doing let's sit back and and and you come and talk to me and we'll see what we can come up with see what why you're not being able to figure this out 

466.68 467.45 A: mhm 

468.72 471.17 A: mhm 

470.01 472.88 B: maybe you're looking at it sort of all totally different 

472.66 476.73 A: yes and i think along those lines too like especially if like as i say like their parents 

476.80 482.06 A: are are like have to work and stuff like that can't necessary be around when they do homework if some 

482.12 496.75 A: sort of initiative was given to teachers to like have an after school program and have like help the kids out with their homework for a little while just to have somebody around to supervise them when they do their homework do you know what i mean like at the same time like fine when their parents can finally get them or they can finally go home 

490.80 492.40 B: (( definitely definitely )) 

496.75 501.64 A: they'll be done with their homework or they'll be like almost done or something like that along those lines you know 

499.62 500.66 B: yeah that 

500.77 502.92 B: that would be that would be great 

502.63 506.49 A: i know they've been trying to do that in some places but like you know it's really 

506.92 513.63 A: when the teachers aren't getting like any sort of reward it's kinda like what are you supposed to [laughter] it's all volunteer work 

514.77 518.29 B: yeah it it yeah i know 

518.30 522.96 B: like in my son's case he he comes home and tells us about it and 

523.42 525.40 B: and these kids couldn't really care a less 

525.33 526.29 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

526.16 528.81 B: they're just in there to pass the time 

527.88 528.66 A: mhm 

529.21 530.61 B: (( and then you know )) 

530.74 535.17 B: that takes away from somebody who maybe actually wants to go through those classes 

534.51 536.20 A: yeah 

538.10 544.84 B: you know and the school districts are sending 'em to the technical schools to get rid of 'em to get 'em out of their hair for half a day 

544.35 546.94 A: (( mm [noise] mhm )) 

545.63 547.74 B: you know that's that's not right 

547.27 549.23 A: yeah it's not 

549.10 552.36 B: yeah deal with the problem that that you've gotta deal with 

553.30 557.17 B: you take him if if this kid's a problem and you're at the home school 

557.25 558.86 B: (( find out what's going on )) 

558.55 560.29 A: mhm 

559.54 562.92 B: don't reward him by giving him a half a day off for crying out loud 

562.45 564.03 A: no that's silly 

565.01 566.51 B: yeah that that 

566.67 568.41 B: that just irritates me to no 

568.40 572.03 A: mhm where where do your kids go to school they go to a a private school or a public school
