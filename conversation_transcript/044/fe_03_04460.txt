1.21 2.37 A: hello 

5.37 10.32 B: (( [noise] )) 

8.79 9.86 A: (( hello )) 

12.34 13.36 A: hello 

13.34 14.54 B: hi 

15.06 16.27 A: are you ready 

15.61 18.05 B: this is alabama how are you 

17.71 19.92 A: hi this is orlando 

19.53 22.62 B: hi orlando you the closest one i've seen yet 

22.02 23.61 A: [laughter] 

23.01 25.75 B: most of 'em's out west or up north 

25.42 26.90 A: yes ma'am 

26.33 29.54 B: [lipsmack] public schools well 

27.67 28.80 A: yes ma'am 

29.68 34.08 B: when i was growing up you got in trouble you got a paddling 

34.12 40.92 B: now corporal punishment is out ruled uh what's the biggest problem is that uh 

36.60 37.64 A: mhm 

42.04 45.25 B: [sigh] i don't think there's enough control over the kids 

45.96 47.10 A: okay 

46.15 55.66 B: i don't know how else to say it 'cause i know i've got one that's twenty years old and went through she had no problem here it is she's gonna and my youngest one's gonna to the same system 

55.72 57.77 B: and she's having a big problem 

58.26 61.57 B: because the kids are not reprimanded they're not 

61.88 63.32 B: disciplined 

63.68 76.99 B: uh my girl is enough of a problem herself but the other kids uh the teachers ignore and tell her i mean i've honestly seen the school officials tell my daughter if she reported another incident of someone bothering her 

77.09 79.64 B: that uh that's gonna put her in i. s. s. 

81.75 94.95 A: [mn] well the public schools have quite a bit of problems b- but i mean there's some good and bad i think a lot of it too is if if you have schools now that are teaching these uh placements or that are having to take placement tests 

95.06 100.26 A: uh i think some of the problems are the teachers are teaching the kids how to pass that exam 

100.58 103.94 A: and really what the kids end up doing is memorizing 

103.96 111.19 A: answers to exams so once they get past the disciplinary issues around the classroom it's a matter of how are they teaching 

105.72 106.61 B: (( yeah )) 

111.36 120.57 A: and the kids have no idea other than memorizing the answer what the actual reason for the answer to be is so you've got the difference between understanding 

118.24 119.15 B: right 

120.65 125.93 A: or memorizing a a ques- an answer to a question and actually what is the 

125.50 126.79 B: understanding 

126.20 134.71 A: concept behind that answer so it it gets a little confusing and then also there's sports 

134.99 144.69 A: and how that plays in public the public system as well because sometimes sports seems to kinda lead toward leniency for certain sports 

137.63 138.64 B: yes 

145.03 149.61 A: they don't seem to take the harder courses but they definitely are in there playing sports 

148.85 149.86 B: [noise] 

150.08 151.12 A: so 

151.33 155.02 A: depends on you know where you're at in the united states 

155.06 157.32 A: in texas football rules 

157.77 160.67 B: well in alabama football rules too 

158.52 159.33 A: (( [laughter] )) 

159.66 167.71 A: yeah you've got yeah you've got alabama and and of course the big push is if they're not teaching and they're barely getting by then 

168.13 171.86 A: the unfortunate thing is not everybody's going to get to play in college 

171.69 172.77 B: (( [mn] right )) 

172.27 180.29 A: and not everybody's going to get to play in professional football or any kind of professional sports so that leaves quite a few folks 

177.20 178.20 B: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

180.28 182.72 B: have did you ever see forrest gump 

182.18 183.42 A: oh yeah 

183.27 188.09 B: well that's probably one of the prime examples of what you were just thinking of 

188.58 189.39 A: (( yep )) 

188.79 193.53 B: uh he didn't get an education because he didn't have the mentality for it 

192.89 195.16 A: right but he certainly could run with that ball 

194.82 196.06 B: yes 

196.64 197.58 A: yep 

197.33 198.29 B: (( [cough] )) 

197.82 206.31 A: so the thing is i- i'm wondering and i guess part of th- this discussion would be how do they fix that currently in schools because the the thought is that 

206.27 218.87 A: i guess one of the fixes to and it wasn't really the fixes to public school it was more fixes to education and that was to fund or to stipend and give people money to put kids in private schools 

219.75 222.38 A: so to me that's not a solution 

222.66 227.35 A: that that's a cop out in that not everybody can afford a public a a private school 

223.11 224.20 B: no 

227.05 230.71 B: no i know my daughter's begging me to home school her 

227.54 228.48 A: and 

230.22 244.02 A: yep well um home school is a totally different discipline to i think you take a social skills and social interaction out and away from kids and i think that they seem to have a tougher problem once they get into the mainstream 

234.63 235.56 B: yeah 

244.57 249.18 A: because they do have to solve solutions that day in and day out just being in school 

251.01 260.85 A: whether they're either running away from somebody that's picking on 'em or actually trying to talk their way out of you know maybe finding other solutions than fighting [mn] 

251.33 252.04 B: (( right )) 

261.41 266.12 B: well my thirteen year old has actually resorted to fights 

265.91 273.93 A: mhm yep hm 

266.34 269.36 B: to get uh certain little bullies to leave her alone 

269.85 273.50 B: [lipsmack] 'cause i mean it's nothing unusual to hear filthy foul language 

273.71 277.54 B: and most of the parents allow it and two months ago 

277.56 279.77 B: that i hold uh heard a little boy 

279.78 284.92 B: tell andrea out in public now i heard this and me in my car why don't you go 

285.11 287.14 B: my blank 

288.04 292.24 B: i jumped out of that car put it in park of course at at first 

292.44 296.16 B: i told him i said you little half raised heathen 

296.36 303.48 B: you wanna pick on my daughter you'll go through me this time otherwise keep that filthy foul mouth to yourself 

303.78 307.72 B: now you wanna a piece of her come on you've got me to deal with 

308.27 311.12 B: i mean everybody's mouths just dropped 

311.45 315.80 B: mama was sitting right behind me in her car she was having a ha ha 

315.85 317.17 B: a laugh 

317.71 321.20 B: i thought that was so ignorant 

320.58 321.55 A: yeah 

321.33 326.69 B: though if my child say something to somebody i would have tore their butt up 

326.10 328.12 A: [mn] yeah i would've snatched their bald 

328.81 330.84 B: (( i mean it's just )) 

329.08 330.31 A: yeah 

331.13 336.19 B: but but that's allowed now but not by me but 

333.04 335.16 A: yeah well 

335.39 345.25 A: interesting enough i think discipline should not be one of the biggest issues at school but unfortunate- unfortunately it is 

344.84 348.88 B: because because there's not that much discipline at home 

345.36 346.72 A: because 

346.99 353.00 A: right well and what you're finding out is that a lot of parents think that that's 

353.12 358.24 A: the job of the school when in reality you know what they should be showing up to school 

358.26 363.38 A: ready to learn and not mouth off because kids now don't even aren't even scared of adults where 

363.90 365.38 B: [lipsmack] no all they've gotta 

363.98 370.97 A: you know twenty years ago you did not mouth off to an adult you listened and you did what the teacher asked you to do 

367.29 368.24 B: true 

370.77 378.40 B: that's right nowadays uh if an adult strikes a child oh they're in for it with uh d. h. r. 

378.20 379.43 A: yeah 

378.93 383.09 B: and the kids aren't afraid to throw that out at the parent or or an adult 

382.47 383.39 A: sure 

384.30 385.41 A: yeah but i 

384.44 390.27 B: and it's really sad because if you strike a child or leave a mark 

391.00 392.32 A: yep you're 

391.22 398.65 B: you are eligible to be um um disciplined yourself [noise] for child abuse 

396.69 397.72 A: oh yeah 

398.23 399.48 A: mhm 

399.90 403.84 B: [cough] it's just one issue it's a a multitude of issues 

403.47 408.55 A: but i'm thinking once if if if you could actually go to school where kids were there wanting to learn 

408.69 417.74 A: uh if they weren't going into the school hungry because then they seem to act out or if they're not getting the attention at home they're certainly going to get it at school 

418.08 419.11 A: then 

419.47 420.58 A: what do they do 

420.98 426.89 A: because it seems like a lot of schools will actually go to the extent that once a kid acts up they put 'em in a different school 

427.14 429.11 B: now that's happened to my child 

428.46 435.43 A: and the alternative school really is not at at that point becomes not focused on curriculum but more on discipline 

435.45 441.81 A: and that's not gonna help your kid or anybody else's kid when it comes to finding a job or graduating from high school 

441.57 450.21 B: [lipsmack] no actually she had to make up all the work she was in i. s. s. uh i'm sorry in alternative school for a week because the school just kept on at her 

450.15 461.77 B: and uh it wound up and and i had to subject my child to that and me telling the the authorities i said uh this is not andrea i'm not telling you this is [noise] somebody else 

461.71 468.59 B: and you've got to look for what it is not just that my child because she happened to be one of the ones that got into it 

467.97 469.05 A: right 

468.80 475.09 B: and uh sure enough within less than a month's time they had landed my child in there first in the principal's office 

475.49 487.55 B: and after that the same girl that she got into it about and had to alternative school had five other girls and their parents there waiting for the principal to be reprimanding them 

488.08 494.51 B: i mean it it was it was not my child but yet she was the one that everybody was picking on 

490.44 491.80 A: yeah so 

494.81 498.86 A: so the system somehow the system is is messed up 

494.94 495.97 B: (( [lipsmack] so )) 

498.14 509.09 B: and i i heard the the assistant principal tell me your child is a problem maker she don't know how to cooperate she has no social skills i told her i said ma'am 

509.15 518.43 B: before you start denouncing my child you need to delve into the problem not just the issue that's come up right now 

518.49 523.01 B: i said i have given my child all all authority 

523.24 528.94 B: and permission to knock the wholly crap out of someone when they're up there slapping her around 

528.04 528.91 A: yeah 

529.03 533.79 B: to defend herself if she ever starts anything i'll be the first one to beat her butt 

533.64 544.64 A: yeah i think somehow within that within that school structure though i don't i think there has to be something in in place that eliminates that completely the kids are not gonna learn 

535.56 536.86 B: because 

543.40 549.19 B: yeah i wish there were i wish there were because andrea andrea said mama i can't learn 

548.93 550.02 A: yep 

549.72 560.60 B: i can't because these kids keep messing with me if they're not pulling my hair they're slapping me on the head uh they're whispering nasty things and sometimes they're just straight up punching me 

557.82 558.59 A: yeah 

560.25 561.61 A: (( yep )) 

561.26 564.42 B: and the teachers see it and they won't do anything about it 

562.18 562.98 A: well 

563.66 574.49 A: well that's that's one of the things so there's there's gotta be a system in either a points system or something that and they need a lot more teachers in there the student to or 

574.80 579.14 A: teacher to student ratio is is too high probably as it is now 

578.89 580.31 B: yeah well that's 

579.33 593.78 A: when they're exceeding over thirty or i would say between twenty if there are over twenty five to thirty students per teacher then then it's crowded and then you don't have the people to look over and not only watch between changing of classes and at lunchtime but you know just during 

585.98 586.96 B: well that 

594.23 599.78 A: and being in the hall if that presence isn't there these kids mouth off and they get in trouble with each other 

595.57 596.37 B: (( yeah )) 

599.23 599.95 B: oh yeah
