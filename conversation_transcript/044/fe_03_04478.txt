28.42 29.33 B: do you 

36.97 42.34 A: and uh from when i was a a kid going to school to now is definitely a big difference 

42.52 43.80 B: in what way right 

43.70 56.19 A: in well i i feel just the fact of i mean even when i went to school i never had to worry about having things stolen as far as it's i needed my you know jackets or getting beat up for my jacket or sneakers or stuff like that 

56.11 68.23 A: you know your every school comes with a bully but in different ways it seems today with everything being so stylish and so trendy you know the kids i guess that are a little less fortunate maybe or whatever the kids that that click with these gangs 

67.81 68.64 B: yeah 

68.28 73.07 A: and beat up on the kids that have a little bit i guess that have a little more or whatever 

72.69 73.68 B: mhm 

73.49 76.54 A: in that aspect but also the fact is that i never seen 

76.35 91.23 A: like kids with weapons i mean there's kids in my son's you know school that have been suspended and got caught with knives and caught with makeshift weapons and stuff like that and it i'm i'm in a very good area you know i live in long island and i live in a you know 

87.89 88.81 B: right 

91.14 99.22 A: affluent area on long island and it's amazing i live in garden city and it's uh very scary when you think about it 

96.41 97.14 B: yeah 

98.31 106.54 B: yeah i think all around and and i guess you see it in schools 'cause they spend most of their day in schools but kids are just so much bolder 

106.39 109.18 A: right oh yeah they're brazen 

106.82 108.52 B: you know they're 

109.07 110.70 B: yeah it's 

109.88 117.39 A: yeah i mean there are you know the i mean i guess you use that word hit it on the head bolder they really are i mean what happened to the shy kids 

116.82 118.03 B: right 

117.41 122.24 A: you know what happened to the kids that were shy and and and i and the girls are just as bad as the boys 

121.83 123.86 B: i i agree with that 

123.20 131.09 A: you know i mean my friends have older children than i do and i mean even with the what they wear and what they're allowed to wear 

131.15 142.61 A: i mean i cannot believe that these thirteen year old or fourteen year old girls are allowed to go to school belly shirts you know and for whatever reason the girls of today look a lot different than the girls when i went to school 

136.72 137.51 B: yeah 

141.93 143.25 B: oh yeah 

142.70 152.71 A: you know i mean i didn't know girls existed i don't think till i was fifteen or sixteen and i see these from a an elementary school and i mean i see these girls going to school that are ten 

149.70 150.67 B: right 

152.82 158.89 A: and and i say to myself and i even to my wife i say wha- what could have been that different now than then 

158.95 168.90 B: oh yeah and and you know i i think also one of the issues is you know at a time where we need it most the teachers 

159.98 160.93 A: (( you know )) 

169.50 172.67 B: they're they have no um 

172.73 174.99 B: you know empowerment to 

174.52 176.79 A: they have no control over the students 

175.88 181.47 B: to reprimand the kids they can't because of you know whether it be law suits or 

180.76 183.39 A: right that's it yeah i don't 

182.17 183.31 B: they they're 

183.53 195.76 A: i i have a little bit of a life philosophy i think that the whole of society in general i think everything i think television is the blame of everything and the reason i say that is 

195.70 200.63 A: okay you start right out from what we were talking about the way the kids dress and the music they listen to of today 

199.10 199.88 B: yeah 

200.36 201.14 B: yeah 

200.51 208.79 A: and everything else where do they get it from t._v. from the videos all right they they got one step further how they act and the words and everything else 

202.30 203.07 B: yeah 

208.47 209.20 B: (( yeah )) 

208.62 220.30 A: and then on the other side what you're saying i agree with one hundred per cent is that the teachers are afraid why every child every hour of the day has a judge judy a joe brown a people's court 

220.14 225.12 A: and everybody's getting sued for everything so nobody can say anything any more even your own kids 

222.30 223.28 B: and and 

224.68 231.58 B: yeah and lawyers advertising you know if you feel you've been done wrong call me 

231.33 234.69 A: right well i never forget it my my my niece 

234.68 246.35 A: said to my my cousin flat out one day he gave her a smack on the behind and she said daddy you do that one more time and i'll tell my teacher and my teacher'll call uh social service 

239.71 240.74 B: mhm 

245.86 247.30 B: oh yeah 

246.68 257.22 A: and i said to him i said what what what just happened and i remember plenty of times i got as a boy as i did something wrong i got it and i didn't call anybody except you know say my prayers to make it stop 

249.06 250.14 B: oh yeah 

256.54 260.05 B: [laughter] i did did the same thing 

257.64 259.07 A: you know but 

259.72 269.86 A: yeah but you know i mean it's just it's and it's scary because the truth remains getting back to like i said with the weapons you know you send your kid off to school you know and you sometimes really say to yourself 

269.69 278.44 A: you know what about these other kids and what what are their parents telling them and what if this kid does want my son's jacket and what you know what and i say to him 

278.40 285.31 A: i don't think my parents were ever afraid of me going to school and getting stabbed or getting shot or or anything like that you know those kids kids 

282.19 283.01 B: no 

283.53 284.39 B: no

298.70 299.67 B: you're right 

300.48 307.15 A: i mean i i but i don't know what the answer is either to change it and i don't know what the what you really have to do 

304.29 305.04 B: (( ah )) 

306.94 311.87 B: well i know you know because really to change it it really has to start at home 

312.11 320.07 B: and how you um you know get the population to make changes you can't you can't make them 

319.97 324.33 A: you have you have a lot of drugs out [mn] drugs getting down there 

322.28 323.14 B: yeah

525.68 528.09 B: the teachers don't have more 

529.48 541.32 B: um i don't know if you want to put control but you know are not more empowered to tell a child to leave you know and not have to worry about the 

541.57 543.68 B: consequences of that action 

543.99 546.81 B: or that a parent's going to come down on them and 

547.42 548.75 B: and uh

581.23 585.40 B: um again my son goes to a private school um 

585.49 589.99 B: more than anything it's really more of a convenience to have him there um 

590.48 594.37 B: we're glad he's there um now he's in fourth grade 

594.47 598.07 B: he certainly doesn't need the after day care that originally
