0.19 1.72 A: this is alan 

1.65 3.89 B: (( hi this is robert )) 

4.54 5.67 A: hi robert 

6.89 11.13 A: oh boy this is a tough i'm not sure what to say about 

10.07 18.08 B: well the thing is i'm ah [laughter] i've lived in other countries and i have recently had to send my child back 

18.25 21.33 B: um to jamaica to go to school because the 

21.81 26.93 B: school system in connecticut was so bad he wasn't learning anything 

28.11 29.77 A: oh i see 

29.06 37.30 B: so um from an international perspective compared the u._s. school system to other countries i would say that it um 

38.27 41.48 B: there's room significant room for improvement 

41.79 43.51 A: (( right i ah )) 

43.67 54.31 A: no i i'll have to agree i you know well a many schools are pretty good i i think they all have some sort of ah issues i i know when my daughter graduated from high school 

54.33 57.17 A: and went to college that there 

57.37 63.45 A: you know she had a four point oh grade average there were quite a few classes she had to take um 

63.56 72.42 A: just y- you know ah because she wasn't up to speed and i didn't quite understand it they they said she just had to you know take a 

72.46 84.02 A: it was only a few classes but i thought if the the school district's up to speed why why do students have to take certain classes you know th- for entry [noise] 

84.34 98.59 A: and and i also believe um i i've got a nephew that's about twelve years old and he's got a reading problem for for many years and and i think a lot of it has to do with the parents but 

98.30 99.68 B: yeah that's true 

99.72 107.87 A: they don't make him do anything and i i think they should sit down with him and and and actually make him do something he pretty well does what he wants 

107.89 116.24 A: and the school seems to think that he's not having a problem and if he can't read at age twelve 

116.34 130.54 A: and the school says oh he's he's doing okay ah i have a feeling that they're just wanting to push him along and maybe get him into another school and and the problem will go away you know it won't be their problem any longer it'll be somebody elses 

131.04 136.82 A: and i i don't i don't think that's right ah you know i actually think he has a ah 

134.06 135.00 B: mhm 

137.33 150.64 A: he's he's been let go and i think he has attention ah disorder you know he just doesn't want to do things and [mn] you know i i believe it does start with the parents and the but the school has um 

150.81 153.48 A: you know obviously ah 

153.75 162.74 A: you know they're not supposed to be ah fix alls but but at least they should recognize there's a problem and and i don't think they are 

163.83 165.16 A: so um 

165.50 170.59 A: you know i i i think there are some some issues with public schools in the united states 

171.62 172.65 B: mhm 

172.26 174.86 A: [sigh] um i'm not sure what kind of certain 

175.41 178.80 A: reasons you had you know or or what 

178.28 180.42 B: well i think that um 

180.94 184.09 B: well parental involvement is definitely a factor 

184.09 190.23 B: in the fact that parents i guess once they send their kids to school they're relying on the school system to teach them 

190.20 203.33 B: and not necessarily providing any follow up like when the child comes home to make sure they do their homework and stuff but i think the training of a lot of the teachers like in new york i don't know where you you're in new york 

203.08 205.50 A: (( ah no i'm in ah illinois )) 

205.27 210.69 B: oh okay in new york the new york teaching fellows i don't think um 

211.88 213.64 B: (( i don't know i i )) 

213.74 224.24 B: b- i'd like to see some kind of assessment with the the you know with the who- just the the people per se who are in in the classrooms 

224.56 226.29 B: because that has a lot to do with it 

224.66 225.52 A: right 

227.61 228.78 B: probably 

229.09 239.59 B: i don't know if it's a salary issue or what but the level of care and diligence that i think teachers need to provide quality education in the states is not there 

240.31 246.68 B: compared to other countries because in some countries like it's not a teacher has 

240.49 241.24 A: no 

246.89 247.80 B: you know 

248.12 252.26 B: more of a more responsibility but they're also looked upon in the community 

252.84 259.00 A: correct no i i i know there are some very good teachers out there but on the other hand um 

259.50 264.20 A: i i i don't understand the you know certain things going on because you know i've seen 

264.14 268.37 A: i've seen great teachers and then i've seen others that that weren't so great 

268.30 282.74 A: um that i i think we have a pretty good school system where where i'm at but i've seen these other school systems that aren't as good um you know dress codes are ah were pretty lax um 

283.10 285.19 A: like you know i could not believe 

285.34 295.64 A: some of the things these kids would wear to school ah and you know i i certainly wasn't allowed to to dress like that when i went to school and you know you could almost um 

295.63 303.08 A: you know i mean as a guy you know i i could think back so all you know if the girls dressed like that when i was at school it would have been more 

303.08 312.64 A: more exciting but not in an educational way you know and i i i see some of this at various schools and i just don't understand um 

312.93 318.14 A: you know why the school allows it or why the parents even allow it you know i i think 

318.62 325.84 A: i like i said i think the parents have a um a b- a large role in it but i but i think the school at some point has to 

326.07 328.39 A: ah raise the standards a little bit 

328.80 334.19 A: um you know so that you know kind of enforce some things rather than 

334.28 338.57 A: you know because if the kids come home and say we're allowed to wear this to school 

338.65 348.94 A: um and then you don't allow your child to do that then they're going to feel like they're outcasts and you know why can't everybody else where this you know it it has to start with the school i believe 

349.42 351.15 A: so um you know i 

352.54 357.62 A: you know i i i do believe we have some you know there's room for improvement um 

357.68 364.69 A: man- many people that i i know some people that would rather self school their their children 

364.74 368.37 A: rather than send them to public school and um 

369.17 373.35 A: i mean i guess that's an option but that's that doesn't work out for everyone [laughter] 

373.45 374.46 B: yeah 

374.31 375.78 A: that's a tough option 

378.05 379.38 A: so um 

379.81 388.22 A: you know f- fortunately you you sound like you had a pretty drastic ah change in having to take your child out completely like that 

387.04 400.63 B: yeah because [mn] he's he's five and when we sent him back to jamaica to go to school um we had to pay for private lessons for him too because he was so behind first grade 

401.01 411.41 B: you know he got private lessons to catch up and he was going for a year at this pre kindergarten in connecticut and it just wasn't happening he couldn't even spell his name 

411.27 412.19 A: wow 

411.48 412.23 B: [laughter] 

412.61 417.13 B: and i mean since we sent him down i mean he's been reading 

417.23 419.47 B: you know his numeracy's up 

421.42 425.82 B: i mean nobody expects a genius at five years old but i mean there's certain 

426.08 431.99 B: you know there are certain standards depending on where you live and i don't think those standards 

432.05 435.73 B: are enforced in the u._s. as they are in other countries 

436.10 448.40 B: i mean to i don't know if you've traveled to like the u._k. but the the the british system of education is even far i would rate it as far more superior than the one that the united states has 

436.14 436.99 A: right 

449.25 452.48 A: no i i i totally believe you know ah 

452.65 455.14 A: you're right [laughter] um 

455.06 465.32 B: you know because there is a premium that is put on i mean early childhood education and education there that is not paramount here for some reason i i don't know 

465.92 468.91 A: right i and i do know some people that um 

469.12 475.61 A: will send their children to like well like in america there there's there's catholic schools 

475.29 476.95 B: (( ah exactly )) 

476.52 486.86 A: and and i do know that the the kids do advance and that's probably because they have um pretty strict rules um enforced by the nuns 

486.83 497.71 A: not too many people want to mess with a nun in in a in a catholic school and um they're very strict and i think that has a a large role in ah the children's success 

498.11 501.63 A: so i think that's where ah private schools go 

501.80 502.79 B: mhm 

502.39 504.35 A: you know they they need to ah 

504.89 511.65 A: you know educate the parents that the children's not doing good or you know having trouble and um 

512.02 519.89 A: let the parents get involved but but they also have to tell the parents at a reasonable amount of time what's going on 

520.55 523.76 A: so you know i i think i think there could be little 

524.10 528.51 A: they could tighten up a little bit and communicate better with the parents 

529.45 530.51 B: yeah 

531.04 531.83 A: so 

532.19 536.25 A: i think our time's getting closer but i haven't heard anything yet 

536.18 537.17 B: mhm 

537.55 544.03 A: so it the- these ah this is my second call i've been on it's been very interesting um 

544.65 549.08 A: but i i wasn't quite prepared for the school you know debate ah 

547.72 549.06 B: me either 

549.59 554.88 A: i i even heard there is a small school in st louis that ah um 

555.04 563.90 A: the superintendent was making hundred thousand dollar salary but there was only two hundred students in the school and i thought well that's kind of ah 

564.09 567.91 A: that's kind of crazy you know they have such a small school 

565.64 566.74 B: yeah 

568.00 572.82 A: you know that um other superintendents are have thousands of students 

573.06 574.21 A: and um 

575.04 579.39 A: they kind of kind of get impression that he was maybe overpaid [laughter] 

580.10 584.62 A: so you know but that's a tough a tough thing there too with the salaries 

585.28 588.92 A: um i'm not really sure what you know what happens 

589.34 590.33 B: mhm 

590.91 598.24 A: ah it's too bad the ah the military don't take over the schooling because i think they're a little more strict and i think they learn more so
