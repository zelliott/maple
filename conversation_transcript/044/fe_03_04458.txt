0.97 2.11 B: hello 

1.90 3.23 A: hi 

3.39 5.14 B: how ya doing my name's randy 

4.76 7.15 A: uh my name is mike la poma 

6.96 8.09 B: (( how ya doing mike )) 

7.63 10.35 A: uh good where where ya calling from 

9.93 11.53 B: uh california 

10.93 13.77 A: uh same here i'm in ventura 

11.61 12.63 B: what about you 

13.48 17.83 B: oh yeah so what do you think about uh public schools 

17.83 19.13 A: um 

19.46 24.58 A: they gotta hell of a union they they just keep spending more money and nothing works 

24.40 31.79 B: yeah they do uh in my opinion uh i have uh a mother and several sisters who are public school teachers 

31.46 32.60 A: uh-huh 

31.90 39.68 B: and uh i think their opinion is that the biggest problem with public schools is kind of a lack of accountability for students 

39.65 51.88 B: a lot of people always say that you know we've got to pay more money to schools and that's fine i'm sure a lot of schools do need more money but a lot of students just aren't there [cough] to learn you know 

51.95 54.76 B: i mean their parents think that you should 

54.76 69.62 B: 'em to a school and somehow magically they're gonna end up learning and the kid has to participate in that and you know that culture of people actually being responsible for their own education has to change 

69.95 73.91 B: (( what do you think )) 

72.19 74.28 A: well when i went to school 

74.11 87.47 A: uh i made sure i read all the stuff and went prepared and especially when i went to college going in unprepared you look like an idiot so uh whatever the material that they were testing on i made sure i 

87.58 89.18 A: read the book [laughter] 

89.13 97.77 B: yeah i mean they they definitely have to uh read the book but you know like you go to a my mother works in a school where kids go 

97.80 105.73 B: during uh kinda abnormal hours it's like for kids uh she teaches high school you know it's high school but it's 

100.80 102.71 A: what grade is she teaching 

103.91 104.80 A: oh 

105.65 117.12 B: it's kids who can't go during normal hours for whatever reason maybe they got in trouble or maybe they have to work or whatever you know s- some situation causes them they can't go in normal hours 

117.13 122.53 B: and the ones who do well in that uh 'cause they have to be pretty independent you know 

122.47 136.17 B: uh to do well there are you know they actually take the time to do a little bit of work you know and uh apply themselves but a lot of 'em are just unwilling to do that they think that the teachers should somehow magically teach them you know 

137.54 140.43 A: mhm i don't know man a teacher can only do so much 

140.52 144.69 B: yeah exactly they can they can only do so much you know 

141.51 142.72 A: (( [laughter] [mn] [mn] )) 

145.35 150.18 B: what do you think about uh uh you said unions are uh 

150.24 157.63 B: really powerful and that's true they are but i mean do you think they're a problem or a benefit 

152.64 154.35 A: well look at every time 

156.70 169.55 A: i would say they're a problem because they keep throwing money at 'em and i think it's better you look at the in fact uh the way that the politicians uh when they get on the platform the first thing one of the first things they throw out to get your attention is uh um 

160.75 162.51 B: yeah 

169.56 171.11 A: (( education you know )) 

170.88 171.86 B: (( right [mn] )) 

171.48 179.72 A: i mean uh when did the department of education start it wasn't even too long ago now it's so i don't know they got some heavy lobbying going and 

179.43 182.66 B: yeah i mean it's like a scared cow too if you uh 

182.66 187.39 B: if you argue that you know money's not being spent wisely or 

187.28 198.95 B: you know people start screaming oh this person wants to cut education you know they wanna cut money they wanna uh harm children you know that's always the argument you hear so you can't even really have like a 

192.72 193.72 A: right 

194.68 195.74 A: right 

198.84 205.36 B: a decent discussion about education because everyone starts attacking you like you wanna kill children or something 

204.55 214.67 A: exactly and they use uh education and and the word kids or children they use that as a bargaining chip you know like people talk and all of a sudden they throw education and kids in there and it's a 

214.33 217.35 B: (( yeah )) 

214.89 222.79 A: i don't know we're kinda paying for like and i'm forty five years old and people get spankings all the time you know back then and now it's 

220.77 223.78 B: right i know 

222.83 227.05 A: almost like the kids can turn around and say hey you know i was being mistreated exactly 

226.71 238.90 B: oh yeah that's seriously uh i mean you you can't uh it's really hard to discipline kids you know and a lot of public schools even when they're uh you know threatening other kids or teachers and things like that they 

238.73 242.47 B: they have a so called right to an education so you can't uh 

242.53 246.71 B: can't kick 'em out of there you know i mean i don't think the teachers should ever have to 

246.88 255.45 B: you know fight to discipline a kid there shouldn't be any question about it if a kid can't discipline himself he oughta be gone man he oughta be in reform school 

255.24 256.65 A: yeah i know but then 

256.67 267.41 A: then they the people think that well then there's one more person in that we're society's discarding we end up gonna have to be having waste welfare pay for his ass down the line that's 

266.03 274.12 B: yeah lots of people think that that's true i i mean you know you don't wanna you don't wanna give up on some kid if he's uh 

273.98 287.53 B: you know just had one small problem but i guarantee you you know the the authoritarian way that schools were run before you know it may may not have been perfect for the kids but it certainly turned out kids who learned 

287.49 288.46 A: yeah 

288.81 291.17 B: you know and in the long run we're better off 

289.08 296.68 A: well look at this state look look at california it used to have like the best schools now it's down there with alabama 

294.19 295.20 B: i know 

296.42 300.04 B: yeah yeah it's pretty bad 

296.80 302.65 A: [laughter] so i don't know they they're gonna just that's why these voucher things come out you know 

302.48 306.21 A: like they have a school here in thousand oaks called oaks christian 

305.99 316.15 A: the place is swanky man it's got it all you know effluent area and the kids go and everybody they gear 'em for college just like down at torrey pines in san diego 

309.19 310.90 B: yeah 

315.93 321.56 A: they don't even have music or any of that crap art all they do is gear the kids straight for uh um 

318.71 320.93 B: right 

321.41 324.42 B: they're just trying to get 'em to learn the stuff they need to know 

322.22 323.43 A: (( for college )) 

324.25 329.51 A: i shouldn't say music or art is crap but that's the way they feel obviously they don't even teach it you know 

328.06 329.77 B: right 

330.13 342.11 B: yeah well i mean i suppose for some kids you know music is something that like is really useful but they do have you know schools where you can go to just specialize in that too if if that's really where your talent lies 

342.25 343.12 B: (( you know )) 

342.39 353.80 A: yeah well in this country people don't have time for all that you have to learn a skill to make some bread to make it you know and i don't what other countries you've been in but this one if you don't have any money you're on the sideline 

348.38 350.24 B: yeah 

353.70 355.08 B: yeah that's true 

354.68 357.11 A: (( you know so you have to prepare yourself to to )) 

358.39 359.70 A: (( make some money )) 

358.81 360.47 B: that's definitely true 

360.01 362.35 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

363.10 365.32 B: yeah but 

363.34 370.99 A: when i was in the bahamas i met this guy there he goes oh you're from america i go yeah he goes oh yeah i've been there always have to have a dollar in your pocket 

370.64 372.58 B: yeah 

371.40 374.11 A: so yeah you can't even leave the house so 

373.47 378.22 B: yeah that's true i mean you've you've gotta have some money but maybe that's the way it should be 

378.68 386.26 A: (( [lipsmack] well it doesn't matter that's the way it is here this is the world we're from so i mean that's that's the way it is that's the way i'm gonna )) 

381.23 384.27 B: yeah definitely 

387.08 388.43 A: (( [laughter] you know so )) 

387.82 394.23 B: yeah no doubt about that so what kinda things do you think would uh 

394.60 398.86 B: you know make it easier for schools to change and get better 

398.09 410.98 A: oh heck i don't know 'cause i'm so i'm so far outta the loop you know but um i don't know if this um if they're getting any type of pressure from that voucher thing or what you know and then um i think 

402.33 404.06 B: yeah 

410.19 413.76 B: well i know the unions feel big pressure from that you know 

412.82 413.64 A: oh 

413.73 414.73 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

414.10 420.76 B: they they feel big pressure from u- from uh vouchers because they don't feel like i mean the big thing with the unions is i mean 

420.79 435.47 B: for you know in one sense unions are valuable i think you know workers to get together and bargain it gives them a lotta power but you know they get they get this sense of entitlement a lotta times that that's the only way that it's legitimate to 

435.40 448.33 B: you know to to talk about teachers or any kind of workers and they get so much power they're more worried about their power than you know whether or not uh they're doing the best thing for the kids or for their their teachers you know 

448.57 455.29 B: and uh a lotta times they you know th- they're just worried about hanging on to their their pieces of pie 

455.36 467.47 B: and so they feel really threatened by uh by voucher programs because private schools that don't have union teachers get a lotta off that and they they want that money coming into their pocket 

466.10 479.81 A: yep y- and that's the key you know when i i'm originally from san diego and i was building aircraft down there tella van ryan in san diego and they wanted me to join the union u. a. w. united auto workers an aircraft you know workers 

473.65 474.76 B: sure 

476.89 478.57 B: yeah 

479.38 480.38 B: uh-huh 

479.71 491.22 A: so i said no man i don't wanna get into all that i don't wanna to do that union thing you know and you know what they said we're they're gonna take you don't have to be in the union but we're gonna take the the union dues out anyway 

490.46 492.46 B: yep i know 

491.99 496.01 A: so i said well shit then you've got me by the balls of course i want the union 

493.03 494.19 B: (( yeah )) 

494.53 498.65 B: i was in a situation like that once too where uh they they take 

498.47 504.45 B: state law allows 'em to do it too they can take the money out no matter what yeah that kinda sucks 

500.29 501.13 A: right 

504.30 518.44 B: that's a that's the big problem i have with unions too but that's all of them not just the education ones that are like that yeah my mom i don't know she has to pay a couple of hundred bucks a year no matter if she likes what the union is doing or not you know to uh union dues 

518.23 519.33 A: right 

519.47 521.45 B: so that that's doesn't uh 

521.84 523.39 B: that that kinda sucks 

523.33 536.37 A: well hell yeah it sucks 'cause uh what good are the unions they're not good at i mean 'cause i was in one you know and they're not good at all but when they go to barter a new contract then they're then they're good you know when you need them then they do work for ya 

529.21 530.95 B: yeah 

536.21 540.91 A: but people can go without unions and then when they wanna barter a contract just hire some lawyers and 

539.03 543.70 B: right yep yep 

541.09 542.56 A: do it that road 

542.88 545.21 A: (( still out of pocket expense but )) 

545.22 553.15 A: i don't know how much money they're gathering you know you figure i don't know how much they get like thirty bucks a month or something 

553.36 556.53 A: (( you know and there's like six thousand employees at the place )) 

555.18 557.11 B: yeah but it adds up you know 

556.63 558.16 A: oh yeah 

557.62 561.65 B: it adds up especially you know teachers aren't making that much money either 

561.71 562.73 B: so 

562.79 564.20 B: just uh 

564.45 574.94 B: you know giving the unions a little bit less power might give some uh you know some of that money back to teachers in the first place it would help them economically 

574.21 583.68 A: but you've got to remember the pretense of u- unions when they first came out it was 'cause uh corporations and companies were taking advantage of the employees 

583.32 586.62 B: yeah no there's there's no doubt about that 

583.81 585.47 A: that's how you know 

585.68 592.21 A: and then all of a sudden after time goes on now look at how much power the unions have got and how much abuse and bullshit they pull you know 

591.33 599.95 B: right yeah i mean they've kind of taken over in a lot of ways that role that companies once had you know instead of the company screwing people
