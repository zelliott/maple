44.95 46.45 B: never been to boston 

45.03 45.80 A: it 

46.30 50.44 A: so i was born and brought up in south boston that's the irish section of boston 

49.80 53.46 B: oh yeah i mean there's a lot of irish people from irish descent 

52.88 54.31 A: yeah my uh 

54.00 60.07 B: actually the [laughter] yeah the the it i mean even the the kennedys are irish descent you know 

59.16 62.34 A: yeah my on my mother's side it's higgins 

61.99 65.68 B: yeah w- well higgins oh that's a that's a good irish name 

62.71 63.34 A: and 

63.69 64.60 A: yeah 

65.07 69.23 A: yeah and uh my father was french and american indian 

66.10 66.75 B: (( huh )) 

68.80 69.67 B: (( mhm )) 

70.35 79.91 B: but getting back to the uh the public schools um i personally and i i said to this to my sons and they they went to public school but this is like 

72.86 73.70 A: uh-huh 

79.93 83.84 B: twenty years ago when the public schools did produce good students 

84.05 88.50 B: and you didn't have the uh uh you know the politically correct 

88.11 89.03 A: uh-huh 

88.78 102.17 B: uh environment for the the the kids to go through well [cough] i think one of the one of the things personally i think one of the one of the better moves we agreed to uh do what we did when we were kids have boys' schools and girls' schools 

101.79 105.18 A: yeah act- actually that's that's probably 

105.07 107.83 B: i i think that's one of major factors 

106.23 117.27 A: one of the better things even in high school in the public school system in boston it was uh boys' high and dorchester high was all boys and then they had a dorchester high for girls and 

116.59 117.81 B: yeah 

117.17 125.86 A: the only in the area i lived in the only coed high school was in south boston south boston high but all the other schools in the area were all 

126.07 127.00 A: uh 

127.06 129.51 A: you know for for boys or for girls 

129.82 144.54 B: uh yeah so i didn't know they had those in boston which uh that makes sense being as um a lot of irish i- irish people living there yeah it makes sense a- and the other thing i think they also need to return uh corporal punishment to the classroom 

136.91 137.64 A: (( yeah )) 

145.72 148.12 A: ah i can't agree with you there 

146.22 147.28 B: punishment 

147.74 148.96 B: you can't 

148.39 156.35 A: no i i i i i think if they have a a problem with kid children as far as behaviour in the classroom the parents ought to be bought in 

149.32 150.03 B: why 

156.51 161.04 A: but i don't believe in in corporal punishment because i was almost killed by a nun 

161.04 164.10 B: oh well a nun i mean they they can be vicious 

163.46 164.93 A: yeah tell me about it 

164.31 167.52 B: my wife went to a convent school and she 

167.69 170.84 B: i mean she was terrified of the nuns yeah yeah 

169.37 172.44 A: yeah well a a nun almost killed me so 

171.82 173.13 B: yeah 

172.51 174.29 A: no i i i don't 

174.36 175.91 A: they they get a little 

174.91 179.05 B: when i say corporal punishment i don't mean getting beat up 

178.35 182.10 A: well you know what you're talking a a ruler around the knuckles oh 

181.67 189.72 B: well yeah yeah something like that i i mean or or giving the teacher the right to to put him in a corner like [mn] 

188.97 191.59 A: well yeah well they they they did that too 

191.20 198.73 B: yeah but they don't do it now 'cause then the the parents go get a lawyer for humiliating their kid i mean it's ridiculous 

191.78 192.75 A: (( i was a- )) 

196.33 197.86 A: yeah well a 

198.30 203.10 A: cotton picking nun slammed my head against the goddamn blackboard and and almost killed me so 

203.20 204.95 B: yeah well i mean that's 

205.06 209.40 B: [laughter] well we know what the catholic church is like now don't we 

208.79 210.28 A: yeah we sure do 

209.75 213.81 B: yeah i mean i i don't i don't e- i i don't even go to church now 

210.65 212.35 A: it's unfortunate but 

213.45 214.83 A: well i still do 

214.46 228.30 B: yeah i knew you'd but i i couldn't not not with what cardinal law did and what you know his the the catholic church is getting big lawsuits again from two uh uh [mn] they're gonna have to sell a lot of their property to pay these 

215.90 216.65 A: but 

228.03 230.48 A: yeah [sigh] well 

229.51 232.09 B: but anyway getting back to the schools [laughter] 

232.27 242.08 B: but i really believe that that they need to get rid of this coed these coed programs 'cause the biggest distraction as far my sons were concerned were girls 

236.78 238.01 A: mhm 

241.84 248.45 A: yeah well that and and they had to get through into a lot of them are starting to do this now getting into a program where the 

250.12 250.83 A: (( [cough] )) 

250.96 255.96 A: excuse me the kids wear uniforms that helps a little bit too 

255.44 258.58 B: yes i agree with that a hundred percent 

258.36 264.38 A: [cough] we always had that in the parochial h- school system so and i think it would work good in the public school system as well 

263.44 267.84 B: i certainly do well not only that it would also save the parents a lot of money 

267.25 268.92 A: yeah abso- yeah right 

268.29 273.71 B: yeah 'cause the kids now want two hundred dollar sneakers and five hundred dollar jackets and it's ridiculous 

270.87 272.15 A: right 

273.10 279.14 A: yeah a- and that's what causes problems too one kid has them the other kid's gonna beat him up to get it 

279.11 287.09 B: but the other thing with public schools too is that i mean where i am um they got a big budget for the great county where i am 

286.49 287.40 A: uh-huh 

287.34 295.49 B: and where uh my kids aren't at school anymore but i got a grandchild coming up and he's going to have to go well we'll probably put him in a private school anyway 

295.25 296.43 A: yeah 

295.81 297.11 B: but um 

297.84 303.43 B: th- the money in the budget they take over half of our county budget for the school system 

303.53 309.44 B: and on- less than half of it go to teachers it more than half goes to administration 

306.48 307.38 A: i know 

308.84 312.63 A: yeah the teachers just just don't get paid enough there's absolutely no way 

311.63 314.97 B: well teachers don't get paid nearly enough for the the for the 

314.98 317.74 B: for for the tough job they have but i m- 

316.83 322.19 A: yeah but you know in the parochial school system t- uh the teachers don't get paid that much 

322.58 328.59 A: and and in- inevitably they uh they have a better program as far as the kids' learning 

328.35 329.68 B: mhm 

329.07 334.25 A: faster and better in the parochial system and i'm talking about lay uh teachers 

334.05 335.75 B: yeah 

334.68 337.65 A: you know there's not that many nuns teaching anymore 

337.50 341.00 B: yeah thank god [laughter] 

340.38 349.85 A: from this i i was with the nuns from the uh first grade to the fourth grade then i went to boarding school and it was brothers of the sacred heart that taught me in boarding school 

349.87 354.36 A: until the eighth grade and then when i got out of boarding school 

354.68 358.53 A: uh i went to a public school uh in high school 

358.02 359.33 B: (( mhm )) 

358.77 363.00 A: in the ninth grade and i just wasn't doing very well because 

362.99 376.96 A: we were so far ahead of them that uh my parents requested that i be given the test and uh in the ninth grade i took a test and i it was in those days it was called a high school equivalency test 

376.42 377.52 B: (( mhm )) 

376.91 379.15 A: today they call it a g._e._d. 

378.55 379.99 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

379.40 383.43 A: and i passed that with flying colors and i was out of school and going to college 

383.52 384.62 B: (( yeah )) 

384.01 385.75 A: so i never went to high school 

385.99 389.30 B: that's amazing so you m- you must have been pretty sharp though 

386.85 387.75 A: yeah 

389.11 390.55 A: well 

389.99 391.39 B: (( and you had good parents )) 

390.56 394.67 A: [mn] what it was in boarding school we went to school seven days a week 

394.14 395.70 B: ah yeah yeah 

395.12 400.03 A: and uh we even went in the summertime wh- uh went year round 

398.15 405.27 B: uh and you bring up a good point too and i think year round school is it should be implemented 

405.08 405.97 A: uh-huh 

405.58 407.68 B: with like when i went to school 

407.96 417.74 B: here you get three months off and i i realize why down here it's because of the tobacco the crops and the kids couldn't to back to school until all of the crops were picked you know 

416.68 418.26 A: yeah that's true too 

417.92 424.75 B: but where i lived we get like five weeks vaca- uh school break in june july 

423.04 423.95 A: (( mhm )) 

424.85 425.49 A: (( yeah )) 

425.13 427.19 B: and here they get three months 

426.54 431.58 A: well you know in the summertime we had school but we also had camp as well you know 

431.17 432.86 B: yeah 

431.82 432.99 A: they uh 

433.43 442.75 A: we had times at the lake and we had times uh playing ball and and whatever but we still did schoolwork at the sa- while we were uh in the summer 

443.02 448.15 B: they don't do that here i mean they it the the kids get off for three months and they're all 

444.38 445.58 A: (( i know it )) 

447.18 452.73 A: well they'll do it here if the kid is does- didn't pass the class and they have to go to what they call summer school 

452.29 455.35 B: yeah yeah do out h- they also do that here 

454.60 460.40 A: but that's only if they're not passing we went passing or not passing [laughter] 

456.35 457.44 B: yeah 

459.68 460.36 B: (( [laughter] )) 

461.02 466.18 B: s- so anyway um let's any other ideas you have uh regarding 

464.91 467.75 A: on on the public school system 

467.10 475.76 B: yeah i think it should be i don't think it should be uh dictated to by the federal government i think each state should have its own school system 

475.44 487.99 A: but well you know there's the one thing that i have a problem with in the public school system today it that i didn't have back when i was a kid going to school when i was a kid going to school there was a school on every cotton picking corner 

484.17 484.96 B: yeah 

487.94 490.66 A: practically they closed all the schools you 

488.61 489.43 B: yeah 

490.07 492.32 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

491.25 497.55 A: know they they the the schools are just too big the classrooms are too big and the teachers are underpaid 

497.64 506.60 B: well a- another thing that really bothers me about public schools and maybe i shouldn't say it in this call but i- i mean they're trying to take god out of the classroom 

506.54 507.80 A: they what 

507.18 510.43 B: trying to take religion out of the cla- classrooms 

509.39 512.45 A: well that's dumb that's [mn] yeah yeah i know it's ridiculous 

511.39 516.17 B: talk about talk about a misuse of the uh the constitution 

515.64 516.47 A: (( i know )) 

516.27 519.99 B: i i i mean it's uh ridiculous uh we get 

519.38 522.47 A: look at your dollar bill what's it say on it in god we trust 

522.07 527.33 B: uh yeah but that's only a only a matter of time before that disappears you mark my words 

525.76 526.63 A: well 

527.50 532.12 B: the next dollar bill you see may be or in allah we trust 

532.54 540.04 A: well when you go into the i- [laughter] you go into a courtroom and you have to swear on the bible right [laughter] 

533.53 534.92 B: [laughter] 

538.25 539.64 B: yeah yeah 

539.95 541.41 B: yeah 

541.15 542.34 A: (( so i don't know )) 

542.57 543.52 B: but uh 

544.20 551.08 B: you know i i think i think we need to get control out of washington and get it back into the states 

552.18 555.89 B: because that's the way did you know that [cough] 

556.67 558.79 B: in the eighteen hundreds 

560.09 566.92 B: in the eighteen hundreds in nine- that the u._s. population was like ninety eight point seven percent literate 

567.01 568.80 A: yeah 

567.87 569.38 B: do you know today 

570.17 572.10 B: what the literacy rate is 

570.20 571.32 A: mhm 

572.95 574.22 A: uh have to be 

573.32 582.02 B: it's probably about seventy or seventy five percent i know adults in this in this co- this state who can't read or write 

581.80 584.61 A: i know that that's terrible it really is it's 

583.29 585.19 B: (( yeah it is i mean it's dreadful )) 

584.87 589.22 A: so many uh children today that they just push 'em through the system 

586.69 588.33 B: because it's onto 

588.63 593.31 B: it's because of the curri- the curriculum coming out of out of washington 

593.24 594.61 A: mhm 

595.11 599.08 B: i'm convinced of that and then look at the cost of schools 

599.10 599.89 A: i know
