1.29 3.79 A: hi this is dave from iowa 

3.36 6.19 B: hi this is kerry from oregon 

6.51 8.46 A: nice to meet you kerry 

7.71 8.91 B: good to meet you 

8.78 10.51 A: (( how are you tonight [mn] )) 

10.31 12.82 B: ah i'm pretty good it's a nice night out here 

13.50 18.05 A: we just had a thunderstorm or two pass by but it's not bad right now [mn] 

20.34 21.02 A: (( [noise] )) 

21.42 25.29 A: well you know i already had a call on this exact topic 

25.03 26.58 B: [laughter] 

25.51 28.88 A: and so i'm i'm gonna have to cheat a little bit already 

29.07 31.57 A: having heard the thoughts of another person 

31.25 32.18 B: uh-huh 

32.43 33.55 A: but um 

35.37 41.98 A: we kind of decided that friend uh uh assuming that friends and family are not the same 

41.66 44.80 B: oh okay that's a big important point 

44.69 48.52 A: yeah 'cause you know your my wife is my best friend but 

47.43 48.46 B: me too 

49.15 52.13 A: but he thought that they were different 

51.57 52.59 B: uh-huh 

52.91 55.61 A: and if that if that were the case 

56.24 62.10 A: i guess what i would probably do because i'm hurting so bad for money is i'd probably 

62.74 68.87 A: uh write a nice cheque to my best friend and you know try to explain the situation in a note 

69.19 70.16 B: uh-huh 

70.29 70.85 A: (( [cough] )) 

71.63 74.38 A: i don't know i don't know if that's right i don't know 

74.52 79.41 A: how god would feel about that but that's how i feel like i might handle it 

80.23 82.81 B: yeah sometimes i wonder if uh 

83.16 85.81 B: 'cause i'm a i struggle for money too 

86.18 93.77 B: uh sometimes i wonder if that's not the point of all this is to just have uh some kind of faith during the whole time you're struggling 

95.02 96.73 A: well i know 

96.99 105.29 A: [cough] i agree but then i wouldn't know [sigh] yeah it would it doesn't sound like something god would do does it no that's true 

104.32 106.29 B: no not to me [laughter] 

106.20 109.13 A: ah that was my first thought 

110.34 114.31 A: but then i also th- my second thought was that [mn] 

114.56 125.41 A: giving my best friend who's also hurting real bad ah it might be worth it might be worth it to them [noise] if i gave them a lot of money [cough] 

124.34 125.25 B: (( mhm )) 

127.04 129.62 A: and then we could both maybe make new friends 

129.66 130.89 B: (( [laughter] )) 

132.70 134.25 A: (( but i don't know )) 

135.61 138.70 A: it's it's probably better not to take the money 

139.20 140.65 B: yeah i think 

140.92 143.21 B: i think that there's so much ah 

143.81 150.17 B: sadness that comes with uh taking the money that it probably won't turn to anything good 

152.92 154.65 A: yeah 

154.91 157.52 A: yeah sounds like something that ah 

158.29 163.92 A: in proverbs it says that if the lord blesses you he adds no sorrow to it 

163.18 164.27 B: uh-huh 

164.45 169.90 A: but if you're hasty to be rich yourself then you will be troubled with many sorrows [noise] 

169.77 172.76 B: yeah it i believe it 

173.70 176.64 B: i think those are words to live by really 

180.59 187.13 A: but [sigh] it's certainly a it's certainly a hypothetical situation that'll never 

187.24 190.58 B: [laughter] that's very true 

187.52 188.31 A: happen 

188.94 194.26 A: so it's not like we have to actually worry about it but it is good to examine our souls 

194.85 196.89 A: our motivations i guess 

196.99 205.49 B: that's that's true it when you think if it really did happen uh what kind of crazy person that that rich person would be 

206.50 216.44 B: if it's a just some rich guy saying i'll give you a million dollars but you never talk to your best friend again why he want me to do that i i don't think he'd be a very nice person 

217.81 221.00 A: oh yeah he's it probably be a very bitter soul 

221.13 222.90 B: yeah 

223.43 225.12 B: yeah you're right 

226.04 231.19 A: maybe he got stoned one too many times i don't know 

230.91 231.76 B: (( mm )) 

234.99 243.72 A: seems to me like i saw a movie one time that there was some rich weird man that wanted something like that 

244.04 248.60 A: and um the whole family was after the inheritance but he had over 

248.79 252.85 A: whole lot of stipulations that they had to be meet 

252.11 253.09 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

252.91 254.88 A: i don't recall the name of the movie 

256.77 262.91 A: in the end they did the right thing but i tell you what there was a lot of fighting at first 

263.56 264.35 A: [mn] 

264.86 265.79 B: huh 

265.10 268.71 A: i think it was basically he hated his whole family 

268.88 273.51 A: and he just wanted them to beat each other up [mn] 

272.49 274.01 B: uh awful 

276.11 279.37 B: i i don't actually watch movies just because ah 

280.97 286.10 B: i haven't really found anything in them that that i think i need 

287.34 291.60 B: a lot of people think i'm strange but i would rather just spend some time uh 

291.66 293.33 B: praying or 

293.52 295.64 B: relaxing or reading a book 

296.89 299.13 A: uh nothing strange about that that's 

299.56 301.86 A: that's the better way to use your brain 

302.33 303.17 A: [mn] 

303.16 304.89 B: yeah i like to think so 

303.51 304.32 A: (( you know )) 

305.73 309.73 A: yeah there's no point in putting garbage in your mind 

308.75 312.21 B: i agree and most movies are garbage 

313.20 317.82 B: not all i i r- i know that there are some that are good but 

318.32 320.71 B: they're pretty few and far between 

322.94 330.31 A: my uh my pastor is always praying that someday god would make hollywood into hollywood [mn] 

329.42 331.13 B: (( oh wow )) 

331.43 333.48 A: [cough] he wants a big miracle 

334.02 337.26 B: that would take that would take a lot [laughter] 

336.93 340.41 A: but my own god guy can do anything 

339.75 341.31 B: oh that's 

341.32 342.66 B: that's for sure 

344.57 346.94 B: [mn] it's hard to remember that every day though 

349.27 352.51 A: yeah we do get twisted around things don't we 

351.83 353.95 B: yeah 

354.02 365.22 A: well it's good that you spend time in prayer and [cough] and reading that's that's the best way to keep your mind pure especially if you read good things 

365.11 366.39 B: yeah 

365.92 370.77 A: the bible and [cough] hopefully books that help you understand the bible 

370.39 372.77 B: yeah yeah 

372.84 374.49 A: (( so yeah [cough] )) 

374.86 380.66 B: i like to read a lot of uh a lot of holy books from all kinds of all all over the world and just see 

380.90 382.54 B: what i can get out of them 

383.59 384.51 A: (( i oh )) 

387.01 390.07 A: [noise] so do you speak more than one language

414.91 415.94 A: (( oh i see ))

425.14 436.18 A: actually never really went anywhere i i went to san diego once but it was just on a plane and i didn't get to visit anywhere except for one church and and a hotel that was it [sigh] 

435.46 436.31 B: (( hm )) 

437.03 440.56 A: so never been out to the west coast 

440.32 441.52 B: it's uh

446.15 448.20 A: oh yeah 

448.67 452.31 A: yeah i i've seen the pictures you got 

451.31 452.26 B: uh-huh 

456.47 458.77 A: are you in the rainy part of oregon 

458.44 460.27 B: yeah unfortunately 

460.73 469.06 A: i guess or- i guess oregon is mostly all rain in uh washington they got a dry part and a wet part i guess oregon's mostly all rain isn't it 

466.13 467.29 B: yeah actu- 

468.55 474.68 B: well if you if you cross over the mountains and in- into eastern oregon it's uh it's a desert pretty much 

474.72 475.90 B: high desert 

475.33 476.03 A: (( oh )) 

476.18 478.39 A: the cascades go through there do they 

478.08 479.30 B: yeah they do 

479.92 485.69 A: oh yeah that's why [cough] all the moisture dumps off on the west side and then it's dry on the east 

484.96 487.30 B: exactly exactly 

487.44 489.93 B: you seem to know a lot about it 

489.56 493.61 A: well i- i met a guy from richland washington he explained it 

494.13 503.19 A: um his conditions and then of course i learned in school or the [cough] from the meteorologist's point of view why that happens 

502.67 503.68 B: uh-huh 

503.59 508.10 A: and [cough] those two things kind of fit together they made a lot of sense 

507.50 508.42 B: uh-huh 

509.61 511.99 A: and that's true all over the world 

511.92 512.88 B: uh-huh 

513.38 516.69 A: the deserts are always on the east side of the mountain well 

516.98 522.88 A: i don't know about the southern the southern hemisphere i haven't studied meteorology for them 

521.85 522.80 B: uh-huh 

523.45 526.15 A: and that could be altogether different for all i know 

526.47 528.16 B: yeah i don't know either 

529.38 531.22 B: it's pretty interesting stuff though 

531.85 535.25 A: yeah to think they're getting ready for winter down there 

534.68 536.54 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

536.26 538.44 A: and we're getting ready for summer 

540.29 545.91 B: yeah summer's the only really nice very nice season here in in eugene 

548.05 554.55 A: well but you guys do have nice even temperatures you don't get super cold or super hot 

553.92 555.11 B: that's true 

555.08 568.32 A: it's one nice thing about the northwest i've always appreciated i always thought maybe uh spokane would be a pretty good place to live but they get pretty cold up there i don't exactly where i'd wanna to live if i were there but 

567.94 568.92 B: uh-huh 

568.92 573.21 A: [lipsmack] maybe i don't know i haven't [cough] really scoped it out

583.11 583.98 B: uh-huh 

586.16 592.92 A: break 'em down from [sigh] you know seven or eight thousand words down to something a little more palatable and easy to to 

593.33 597.90 A: then we just send them out all over the world to people who wanna read 'em 

595.46 596.15 B: w- 

597.14 598.68 B: wow you do
