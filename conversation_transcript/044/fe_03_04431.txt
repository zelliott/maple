6.40 7.89 B: yes how are you 

7.54 8.96 A: good good 

10.00 17.50 A: so if someone were to offer you the million dollars would but the only stipulation is you can't talk to your best friends would you take it or not 

17.96 19.36 B: that's our topic 

20.37 23.20 B: uh yes i think i would take it how about you 

23.38 31.54 A: yeah i think i probably would take the million dollars i think if it was for family maybe i w- i would think again but i i'd probably 

31.67 33.43 A: i guess be able to make 

34.49 39.79 A: um new friends what with my new million dollars in the bank mhm 

40.07 48.49 B: well i think i- if it's a million dollars somewhere like you say in the bank in switzerland that sounds good switzerland swiss banks 

48.20 49.01 A: yeah 

48.66 53.87 B: and um i think i would find an island somewhere off from new zealand 

55.39 57.78 B: and maybe bring me a surfboard 

57.54 60.38 A: yeah that would be your ideal way of spending the million 

60.41 66.65 B: well no i don't think i would spend the million all at once just just yeah put in a bank or it you know 

63.04 64.55 A: (( just keep it in the bank )) 

66.95 68.77 B: let's say as a cushion 

68.44 69.40 A: mhm 

69.37 74.96 B: [laughter] but um yeah i think a- as far as uh 

70.44 72.33 A: yeah that's not bad 

75.00 79.47 B: they did say friends not family so um 

77.06 77.98 A: right 

79.52 84.22 B: as far as that goes i don't think that would be a problem since uh 

87.06 90.07 B: think a measure of the times we're in you know 

89.86 90.74 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

90.70 93.01 B: as far as what friendships are 

93.42 94.91 B: what do you think 

94.22 95.65 A: yeah that's true 

96.61 100.00 B: i mean like how does the island sound 

99.26 101.98 A: yeah that doesn't sound bad 

102.20 105.37 A: if you're al- alone with you and your surfboard 

102.24 105.45 B: what other what other way would you spend your million 

108.33 109.89 A: how would i spend the million 

108.42 111.61 B: maybe s- maybe start a business huh 

111.51 113.97 A: yeah that that that would be something 

115.59 119.15 A: maybe get a house or get a car 

119.40 122.64 A: but i would give some to my family i think 

122.60 125.49 B: [laughter] well for a million dollars you could get a big car 

125.09 126.24 A: yeah 

125.88 127.69 B: [laughter] 

126.66 129.42 A: i'd also probably put some money in the bank 

129.78 131.11 A: as you said 

129.89 135.98 B: well yeah yeah u- um an offshore bank maybe 

135.78 136.86 A: offshore 

136.67 138.75 B: yeah 

137.72 138.97 A: yeah that's true 

139.24 142.27 B: yeah you know for tax reasons 

141.11 146.89 A: hm i wonder if it's tax free your million dollars you're getting or i i wonder if it subject to taxes 

145.49 148.01 B: oh no no no such luck 

147.76 148.72 A: [laughter] 

149.10 151.81 B: no such luck but uh 

152.38 153.95 B: (( i i think um )) 

155.17 159.86 B: you know and then if we couldn't get if i couldn't get to an island then maybe um 

160.79 163.60 B: i would get a boat 

162.82 164.28 A: yeah boats are nice 

164.28 168.63 B: and um go here and go there 

167.99 171.04 A: that wouldn't be bad travelling the world on your boat 

170.47 175.45 B: [laughter] yeah as long as it was big enough where sharks couldn't jump in 

171.17 171.84 A: (( [laughter] ))

236.58 241.98 B: oh yeah but you you know with the million dollars you you at least have to stop in the ghettos of l._a. 

241.75 243.47 A: (( mm [laughter] )) 

243.54 246.89 B: i mean l._a. is after all you know i mean it [mn] 

247.73 257.53 B: well i i i think for a million dollars um well you can see why i would leave right [laughter] [laughter] yeah because 

252.91 254.59 A: yeah i guess so 

254.80 256.09 A: [laughter] 

257.55 258.50 B: i mean 

258.98 270.99 B: a million dollars in one hand but then i- i- in l._a. they've e- they've eliminated the middle class completely so it's you know it's either the peasantry or the upper echelon 

266.07 266.80 A: (( mm )) 

271.17 271.88 A: (( mm )) 

271.56 275.79 B: and um a million dollars doesn't go far here 

274.86 277.71 A: yeah that might not even put you into the upper echelon 

277.68 288.65 B: oh heaven's no i mean you know it wouldn't even buy i mean a rolls royce convertible sells for two eighty here two hundred and eighty k. so i mean there's a quarter of a million right there 

283.76 284.74 A: wow 

287.95 290.22 A: yeah two million might not be enough 

290.36 292.73 A: i mean a million might not be a m- enough 

292.72 300.60 B: uh well even two's not enough [laughter] and then the houses here i mean are nowhere ne- i 

294.98 297.67 A: yeah yeah true [laughter] 

298.95 302.06 A: were you always w- are you from there or you moved there 

301.47 310.96 B: i'm from i grew up here but a million dollars wouldn't even get a house here in a good area h- houses 

307.42 312.55 A: yeah yeah well you could do okay in jersey on for that house wise 

312.18 314.99 B: yeah a- and new york state also huh 

314.56 315.49 A: mhm 

315.40 318.62 B: yeah i don't know what's going here on the west coast 

317.89 320.58 A: [laughter] guess everyone's moving out there 

320.66 321.89 B: is that why 

321.61 323.53 A: maybe maybe yeah 

322.72 326.44 B: i did see a lot of out of state license plates in the last year 

326.97 330.39 B: you know a- and i actually i saw a couple from new jersey 

330.21 331.80 A: (( yeah yeah yeah yeah )) 

332.27 336.84 B: i was surprised to see that i thought maybe they just got lost 

333.98 334.92 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

337.28 338.41 A: yeah 

337.97 339.41 B: i mean um 

339.91 346.22 B: but you know like a million dollars i don't know see you you 

346.02 348.25 A: do you have a lot of friends that you would 

349.88 350.97 A: i don't know 

350.02 351.04 B: here 

351.05 355.54 B: o- oh yeah i have a lot of i know a lot of people but you know 

353.49 354.36 A: mhm 

355.59 357.70 B: my definition of friendship 

358.08 361.53 B: defines a lot of them into another league 

361.16 362.94 A: mhm 

362.35 368.98 B: i mean you know i mean i think maybe i have three friends in in all my life 

366.93 368.31 A: right right right [mn] 

370.04 375.94 B: and they would understand if i got a million dollars and i went off to some place at the other end of the earth 

372.72 373.97 A: [laughter] 

374.81 377.21 A: yeah they'd probably do the same [laughter] 

376.25 382.17 B: well they would they would so you know and maybe i would send them some money so they could do it 

381.42 382.68 A: yeah yeah [noise] 

382.58 385.56 B: (( you know what i'm saying but you know i i think um )) 

387.15 387.96 A: (( hm )) 

387.67 389.87 B: you have a lot of friends 

389.15 390.19 A: (( uh )) 

390.37 393.79 A: yeah i have i have a number that i'm i'm close with 

394.30 398.46 A: but uh again it's a kind of a hypothetical question i 

399.17 400.22 B: (( yeah b- )) 

399.22 400.71 A: (( guess i ah )) 

400.55 402.35 B: (( [laughter] )) 

400.89 407.49 A: actually putting you know i couldn't imagine it ever happening in real life you know it's hard to kind of put that one into practice 

407.23 409.32 B: million dollars 

408.64 414.83 A: uh uh the stipulation part of it too i mean that's a little far fetched that you'd get the million with the stipulation 

414.73 420.13 B: well the thing is i- if i- people know you have a million dollars all of a sudden they have their needs 

419.72 421.74 A: mhm yeah that's true too 

422.29 423.52 B: and um 

424.00 427.41 B: which accounts for the reason i think i might disappear 

426.42 429.20 A: yeah all of a sudden all those acquaintances might 

429.58 431.84 A: wanna be your friends you know 

431.63 433.39 B: well they become demanding 

432.03 433.70 A: in your life what's the reason 

433.60 436.21 B: yeah i think they would become demanding 

435.81 436.91 A: mhm 

436.60 442.19 B: you know they all of sudden they'll have all these problems and um which 

439.20 440.41 A: right right 

442.58 445.07 B: tends to go with affluency 

444.97 445.81 A: (( mhm mhm [laughter] )) 

446.44 447.57 B: i've heard 

447.87 450.01 B: and read 

450.16 453.09 B: not knowing firsthand i might add 

453.29 456.51 B: [laughter] you know but then 

453.97 455.16 A: yeah yeah 

457.16 458.80 B: you know like wh- wh- 

459.12 463.48 B: you know they said like friends what would happen like if you got a million dollars um
