18.48 19.53 A: yeah

20.68 21.52 B: (( yeah uh )) 

21.70 24.98 A: well uh do you have have you been to public schools 

25.11 33.50 B: well i my first um i i i graduated high school from public schools and then i went to college the private schools you know 

29.91 30.72 A: uh-huh

35.88 36.82 B: (( uh-huh )) 

37.24 38.15 B: right 

38.82 39.89 B: right 

41.50 50.92 A: i don't know that there's anything inherently wrong with public schools i think that they have their work cut out with them with today's the way the kids are today ah 

50.20 51.14 B: (( uh-huh )) 

51.15 52.36 A: (( you know they're )) 

52.51 59.24 A: have so many different ah external forces like go- you know obviously when i grew up we had television and stuff but it wasn't the kind of 

59.09 71.29 A: t._v. you see now we don't you know there's not as much multimedia the computers all that kind of stuff the computer games so kids have a little bit less attention span i believe and so i think that's that's a hard thing for teachers to 

69.59 70.57 B: right 

71.20 75.69 A: to to grapple with and so they have to find new ways to educate kids 

75.09 76.05 B: right 

75.79 77.48 A: and i think that that 

77.58 82.65 A: school thought of whatever of of teaching technique needs to catch up with the um 

83.07 87.34 A: you know with with technology and just today's society 

87.22 88.84 B: yeah but you know what 

88.88 103.30 B: uh because i i taught um evening adult evening education program right and what i find different today in regards to how the kids come up they don't seem to teach with any uh intent 

93.62 94.51 A: uh-huh 

103.44 108.64 B: uh teaching like say values to me it's just a matter of 

108.59 118.94 B: teaching the basic reading writing arithmetic and leave the subject matter real bland i understand that you know you can't always bring your own personal 

111.10 112.03 A: right 

114.20 115.11 A: right 

118.77 131.10 B: feelings into the classroom when you're instructing you know various type of children but at the same time you have to give them some sense of direction in terms of you know and what's happening i think that 

121.58 122.49 A: sure 

123.33 124.35 A: yeah 

127.36 129.11 A: oh i i absolutely agree 

130.91 136.64 B: for one thing since they they went and did away with the pledge allegiance and some other things you know 

136.79 141.32 B: they don't you know it's no flavor in the teachings you know 

139.87 140.81 A: i i 

140.88 154.46 A: i agree with that i think you know that there have been so much you know separation things have you know we can't can't have the church in you know in schools you can't have any kind of seems everything's sort of big and bland and homogeneous and there's no no 

152.92 153.92 B: right 

154.33 158.29 A: you know besides you know being sensitive to you know to other 

158.10 160.70 A: (( races and and relig- )) 

160.51 175.08 A: religions and stuff that you need to be they you know it's just kinda like been so homogenized that the kids don't have any kind of ground or basis you know they have to get it from the parents but even in society as a whole also has sort of gotten away from some of those 

166.13 167.11 B: right 

174.86 183.94 A: you know values and you know that that you know i think that i was brought up and probably you your people in our generation or the the previous generation had and so 

176.57 177.58 B: right 

183.10 184.15 B: right 

183.96 184.81 A: um 

185.19 188.43 A: yeah that that's really touch for for kids to 

189.04 189.99 A: to 

190.36 196.21 A: to learn without that background or or you know that it's reinforced at least within the school 

192.57 193.38 B: right 

195.51 200.90 B: right and you know one of the things you know i would attempt to do i would like to bring 

200.74 215.43 B: that part back into the schools and have it diverse and allow room to teach everybody's beliefs et cetera because it is a public school and your education you pay you know taxpayers we pay for that so right 

209.86 210.87 A: absolutely 

213.53 216.94 A: and everybody pays for it whoever no matter what you believe you all get the same 

215.44 216.84 B: exactly 

216.61 222.81 B: right so i think that there is room in the schools for that because it'll teach 

222.58 235.71 B: the children differences you know and and tolerance see we go around and we preach uh well you gotta be tolerant with everybody but at the same time the majority of the children in this country go to public school so if you don't teach them 

224.06 224.93 A: sure 

225.75 226.53 A: yeah 

235.60 245.95 B: other people's values in the terms of their religion religious beliefs well then what are you doing because i don't think your religious belief is that much separated from your 

238.10 238.96 A: right 

239.25 240.02 A: yeah 

240.49 241.28 A: yeah 

245.72 252.74 B: other beliefs and your attitude about how you approach people and deal with different people in the world i don't think it's that much different 

250.83 251.63 A: sure 

252.05 255.13 A: no i think you're right i think that's that's a basis of 

252.91 253.73 B: (( you know )) 

254.54 255.69 B: right 

255.04 261.72 A: of your you know interact reactions of people to realize that if you have a face that everybody is you know 

256.92 258.52 B: right right 

261.57 266.84 A: created equal or has the same whatever it's exact same beliefs you you believe that 

262.75 264.11 B: exactly 

265.11 266.06 B: right 

266.68 274.48 A: you know for you to hold these beliefs that everyone else has has their own and you ought to respect them and you ought to use that as your your basis for 

270.95 271.85 B: right 

274.29 288.76 A: you know relating to others and and you know the schools that kinda get in trouble that you know that they don't want people to you know there there's a whether it's you know the a._c._l._u. or whether it's the you know the religious read or any of these you know 

275.14 276.06 B: (( uh-huh )) 

288.74 300.72 A: certain interest groups that are putting pressure on the educators to to force them to to not offend anybody or to not you know and so in which case it's totally been homogenized and there's there's nothing there any more 

300.03 300.99 B: right 

300.68 305.87 A: and that's going to be a hard battle you know because everybody's always gonna have some 

306.11 308.22 A: you know political you know 

308.60 311.13 A: or or whatever you know 

310.65 312.25 B: right difference right 

312.46 326.49 A: and and that they hold that over these people's heads you know their elected uh school boards elected the people you know and so so there's always going to be these interest groups that are going to try to steer it you know either to- their way or in a way where no one's one 

326.81 331.01 A: person can or one belief can be can be taught or 

330.33 332.59 B: right exactly 

331.41 333.51 A: but you know so i 

333.61 337.64 A: i don't really know that there's anything that can be done 

337.79 340.30 A: you know a quick fix type of thing or or 

340.07 354.34 A: that you know i think there's good and there's bad some school systems or some teachers teach that tolerance try to bring in different you know they they try not to always have like just a christmas celebration they also teach about at least in my kids' school they have a hanukkah thing they have a thing they 

352.84 353.72 B: right 

354.14 356.50 A: they try to get all different beliefs 

356.52 357.66 A: and you know 

357.63 368.26 A: recognized at least and and you know whether the public school is the right place then you know to to each about all these religions or maybe it is i think it's it's a good idea or whether they're gonna you know 

368.06 380.65 A: they they're gonna concentrate on the reading and writing and arithmetic and they're gonna end up you know they're gonna leave the religion out of it i think that's just the way that we've come in this country and you know it's unfortunate that you know it there's none 

373.47 374.25 B: right 

380.44 386.43 A: that that there should be some some basis they should study it religion should be a like history it should be a 

385.44 386.40 B: right 

386.28 390.03 A: it should maybe be a course that i think would be a good basis for children to 

390.04 404.01 A: rally around to see you know i mean i was raised brought up in a in a like a product into everything i went to a sunday school and learned about jesus and the bible and all this stuff well right now you know we're not taking my kids there they're not going to learn about that unless 

397.92 398.86 B: (( uh-huh )) 

403.90 414.83 A: you know i can talk their mom into you know let's join a church and bring them in there but if they had something in school maybe we they learned a little bit about what the bible was or what the koran was or what you know 

406.05 406.69 B: (( hmm )) 

407.48 408.42 B: right 

414.10 414.68 B: (( [noise] )) 

414.62 422.36 A: and and could then kinda have an idea of themselves earlier on and maybe they could make some decision themselves as they get a little bit older without the 

421.74 423.18 B: (( well exactly )) 

422.45 434.36 A: the direction of your parents that are gonna lead you that way i mean i applaud people who then you know were brought up jewish but then they become a catholic just because of whatever or vice versa that that you know your own individual what you think is right but 

424.62 425.66 B: right 

429.86 430.73 B: right 

433.59 434.56 B: right 

434.92 444.22 A: that that would be a good thing but you know again it's gonna be hard for for that type of thing in public schools to be to be forced just because people are gonna say oh no no no you can't do that 

440.83 441.58 B: (( yes )) 

443.64 455.99 B: right and see one thing i notice here is we you know we educating children to grow up and work in the work world but the money that they working for says on the front of it in god we trust if you go to the court room 

453.75 454.97 A: yeah yeah 

455.36 456.40 A: oh yeah 

455.77 469.12 B: and in the court room there's a big sign in god we trust so where do we get to the point that we don't we want to eliminate you know the god consciousness uh out of our lives you know in terms of the public school system 

458.26 459.11 A: yeah 

464.28 465.01 A: (( mm )) 

466.17 467.55 A: yeah yeah 

468.99 476.26 B: you know and i i the the public pays for all of these things i submit in the court room and all that you know we pay for that 

469.48 470.38 A: (( yep )) 

475.79 476.68 A: sure 

476.05 489.66 B: so you know why should we separate we just have to develop the ways and means by which to instruct it and not offend anybody and i think the constitution allows that but i think that the interpretation that has been given to the constitution 

482.63 483.91 A: right right 

489.45 492.58 B: in terms of uh separating church 

492.36 495.17 B: uh uh from the state uh 

494.97 508.53 B: i i think that that is far as government or leadership is concerned but you you know what i'm saying like uh you know we have the church and then we have congress we have the senate and so forth and so i to me that's my interpretation 

501.04 501.85 A: yeah 

508.35 515.68 B: of separation of church and state not so much as you have to separate it in your public life you know 

514.36 522.05 A: sure that you can't say the you know the pledge of allegiance or you can't say you know have a moment of prayer or something like that that that's really 

519.84 520.80 B: right 

522.00 529.38 A: i just that's what i think definitely this country has gone off and and i don't know they do it in other countries but like you said we were founded 

524.82 526.06 B: right 

529.25 534.85 A: in god we trust we were founded with those religious beliefs i mean this was a country of religious freedom because 

534.09 534.96 B: right 

534.69 546.91 A: people came wherever they were they were you know put upon by the king of england or whatever they couldn't practise certain things or whatever country the people came in for that freedom well one of the freedoms should be religious freedom and so why do we have to 

537.51 538.46 B: right 

541.93 542.85 B: right 

546.78 550.66 A: you know completely wipe out all religion in those types of things 

549.10 550.09 B: right 

550.20 551.18 B: right 

551.09 562.03 A: teach you know 'cause really you're giving them sending them the the message that religion is is bad or isn't supposed to be talked about in daily life or in in public life it's only you know for your own personal thing well 

561.43 562.66 B: right 

561.94 576.06 A: you know you you have to be able to relat- relate to public and the personal and to to have it taught in schools or at least you know in a whole as a whole thing i think that's that's a good thing and i think that's that's one thing that you know really 

564.83 565.63 B: right 

570.40 571.28 B: (( right )) 

576.35 588.22 A: maybe would but the whether it'd make public school better it makes it makes the students that come out of public school more well rounded or or at least you know aware of other people's beliefs and able to then 

584.94 585.88 B: right 

588.23 593.93 A: either you know accept them or you know at least understand them and and try to you know 

593.62 599.89 B: right and you know even further still my argument for uh you know for bringing it back is the fact
