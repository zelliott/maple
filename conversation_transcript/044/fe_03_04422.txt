5.73 9.29 A: yeah i wasn't sure what they were going to say here 

8.27 12.09 B: a real moral yeah i but my other subjects were really basic like 

12.37 16.36 B: things but this a real [laughter] big call but what would your answer be 

12.55 13.68 A: yeah 

16.23 21.11 A: um i guess right off the bat i'd have to i'd probably say no i don't think that uh do 

20.43 24.76 B: yeah i would say no as well it would definitely not be worth it 

24.78 27.68 B: to lose your support system hm 

24.82 26.91 A: you have any r- reasons why 

27.55 30.46 A: and and your reasons why why you'd say no 

30.07 38.09 B: oh i- i said your human support system is much more valuable than a million dollars and someone who's going always going to be there for you or you know who you'd go to 

38.30 41.38 B: first for all sorts of things or you know 

41.64 47.06 B: you know you can count on for the rest of your life a million dollars m- might or might not last you for the rest of your life and it 

46.48 55.26 A: yeah it's it's kind of interesting 'cause they they for some reason people always pick on a million dollars for this or a million dollars for that one nowadays a million dollars just isn't the same

238.01 245.92 B: as well so have you [mn] you said it's hard [mn] like you haven't met any other people after high school or that time period that they've stuck with you

253.98 254.94 B: right 

259.29 263.48 B: right yeah i think the emotional worth is much higher than monetary 

263.15 264.21 A: yeah 

263.81 267.53 B: when it comes down what what kinds of things do you guys do with each other or 

268.25 269.00 B: or 

269.25 270.34 B: used to 

269.31 270.11 A: uh 

270.36 279.91 A: it's it's the s- same old things i guess from that we've always done we play soccer together we were in different soccer leagues and things like that or just our families get together you know 

270.66 271.27 B: (( uh-huh )) 

280.09 284.42 A: and we vacation together occasionally those kind of things but uh 

282.85 283.66 B: (( yeah i um )) 

284.49 285.93 B: mhm 

284.67 286.55 A: just the standard stuff but you know 

286.97 289.99 A: i could talk to some of my best friends every day so 

291.03 295.05 A: [sigh] i don't know so how about you where where is your best friend located 

294.32 309.13 B: [lipsmack] um yeah yeah it's it's hard for me like i'm a a [noise] lot of different people's best friend but i [laughter] have a hard time picking exactly one best friend because like my high my high school life was in maryland and then most of my adult life was in new york 

302.76 303.83 A: yeah 

309.60 315.38 B: and i've just moved to los angeles recently so i had to find a you know like a new set of friends that were closer 

315.10 315.88 A: sure 

315.51 317.44 B: to me geographically you know 

317.56 319.82 B: i still come back to new york to see my 

320.75 323.90 B: (( like uh a a lot of my key friends )) 

323.32 327.48 A: your key that's probably a better term than best friend it really is best friend is [mn] 

325.23 326.05 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

326.44 337.34 B: yeah people i've known or you know we we've been like a group for a while and they're all very good friends with each and best friends with each other [laughter] so it's very hard to separate us [laughter] like two and two 

333.11 334.20 A: (( yeah it's )) 

336.06 342.74 A: so is this in new york city are you is it are you when you go to new york is it in the city that you go to mhm 

337.48 338.51 B: what's that 

341.74 350.72 B: oh yeah yeah manhattan and and mm and a few of them live in brooklyn too a lot of my old neighbors here because when i finished school 

350.98 355.14 B: i moved here so it was we were young and hustling together 

355.63 356.83 B: and you know 

357.13 358.85 B: just trying to stay afloat 

359.13 360.84 B: and now they're all doing 

360.92 368.69 B: pretty well i'm really proud of them and we still have a lot of things to discuss and a lot of shared history i guess there's common history 

368.70 369.45 A: (( yes )) 

369.06 374.07 B: with our set of best friends it's just really hard to find people who understand those things 

374.42 375.24 A: right 

374.44 383.44 B: or so much that we know about each other that we can kid about or warn each other about if they [laughter] if we see each other going down certain paths again 

383.50 386.73 B: either with relationships or careers or whatever 

387.18 391.86 B: we're pretty used to certain things about each other where we can advise one another pretty well 

391.62 392.53 A: sure 

392.33 397.10 B: or at least you know toss out red flags for each other 

396.70 397.52 A: right 

397.23 400.81 B: [laughter] just um you know s- having shared 

400.90 409.83 B: you know so many years of ups and downs and seeing the city change and you know having some of us move out and 

409.26 411.56 A: and when was the last time you were in new york december 

411.01 413.64 B: um i was actually here in december 

414.14 425.53 B: for the holidays and i went down to maryland as well and so what i what i have to do are my east coasters or hit my maryland friends from my school [laughter] or then hit my uh new york friends so 

425.79 430.07 B: i'm always in between d._c. the d._c. area and new york when i'm out here
