0.53 3.17 B: hi i'm gene from south oklahoma 

2.58 6.15 A: how are you doing i'm derek from vancouver british columbia canada 

6.08 8.04 B: good to meet you good to meet you 

6.93 12.45 A: nice to me- nice to meet you this is just my second one here and [laughter] that's a tough one [laughter] 

11.58 17.45 B: d- i was going to say this is uh this is an odd topic tonight [laughter] 

15.31 22.05 A: [noise] [laughter] yeah i've i've skipped a few and i i decided to grab this one oh i don't know [laughter] 

20.77 23.77 B: yeah this is this is unusual um 

23.98 29.81 B: there there was something about the wording they said best friends that 

27.83 33.85 A: so it it w- it it would i yeah they said best friend so it would have to be your very best friend i'm thinking 

33.78 37.40 B: well and it it sounded to me like it may have been plural too 

37.27 38.58 A: yeah 

37.92 44.03 B: which means that basically those those that are closest to you the whole circle of friends 

44.11 52.57 B: would be out of the picture i ah you know i i'm m- strapped for cash but i don't know that [laughter] i'm willing to 

49.94 51.80 A: [laughter] 

52.78 57.50 B: to cut off my support group in order to do something like that 

55.69 66.14 A: well if if it is indeed that case if it's y- your all your best friends your support group then indeed i wouldn't do it either but if it was just one friend your best friend 

62.36 64.34 B: yeah 

65.56 67.53 B: mhm 

66.19 71.82 A: i'm a poor person [laughter] i don't know [laughter] i don't know that that's 

67.85 73.77 B: [laughter] a singular person might be worth it uh [laughter] 

72.46 80.08 A: that that's pretty tempting but i don't know i don't know i've never really had i've had some close friends but i've always moved around 

79.53 81.43 B: yeah 

79.96 89.83 A: so i've never you know i still have i'm still attached to those friends over the phone but you know it's not that close i don't think i've ever really had that real close relationship 

85.78 86.81 B: (( right [sigh] )) 

89.71 103.43 B: that's what makes this sort of tough is the fact that you know your first r- response might be oh i'd never give it up for a best friend but then if you start thinking about it for a while like you said you move away or you know over time you drift 

99.95 101.60 A: yeah 'cause if you think about it 

101.96 112.88 A: you think like in my in my situation i've never made more than twenty five thousand a year and i'm i'm married with three kids and if you think about it if you mo- if you move up into the million dollar class 

106.43 108.43 B: yeah 

109.40 110.84 B: oh man 

112.62 114.09 B: yeah 

113.10 116.88 A: your your your circle's gonna change anyway regardless of this 

115.49 119.40 B: of course this is a singular million dollars too it's um 

118.26 122.19 A: yeah it's not that much anymore is it [laughter] [laughter] 

120.23 121.41 B: no [laughter] 

121.43 123.63 B: i uh i briefly 

122.32 127.52 A: that's a nice house and a few cars and you're done [laughter] you gotta go back to work [laughter] mhm mhm 

124.84 126.48 B: right [laughter] 

126.67 135.16 B: that's that's the problem i i you know i i came into a significantly smaller amount once ah when my grandfather passed away 

135.16 142.33 B: uh it was just under a hundred thousand and i thought whoopee you know this is fantastic i'm rich i'm rich 

142.46 148.96 B: and you know i found out that i can easily go through fifty thousand in a year [laughter] uh 

147.70 153.97 A: oh oh yeah 'cause no matter what what amount of money you get you just change your lifestyle and your the it's never enough 

153.70 163.95 B: to fill it yeah absolutely and i i made the horrible mistake of not investing any of it i mean that's that's the one thing that i would think with the million that you could take it and invest it 

155.66 156.24 A: (( mhm )) 

163.88 171.31 B: um it's such an odd concept of course with it being hypothetical that's i guess that's part of it but trying to imagine 

171.65 178.19 B: any level of success or comfort or happiness that would come with that million 

178.63 182.51 B: and then you're thinking well i ought to call up oh wait i can't 

182.24 183.90 A: yeah you gotta r- 

182.84 186.95 B: i wonder if they've heard no i can't find out [laughter] 

185.37 189.33 A: you gotta ride y- yeah you gotta ride that guilt for the rest of your life 

188.74 191.13 B: (( oh yeah you know )) 

190.25 196.46 A: so when you go when you go and buy that new car and that new suit and every time you're gonna think about that person 

196.20 207.22 B: i- oh yeah you know w- could i pick somebody that was previously my best friend [laughter] can i pick a previously important relationship um i 

200.11 201.61 A: [laughter] 

202.11 202.71 A: (( for )) 

205.50 207.16 A: (( sure yeah i s- )) 

207.22 218.06 A: i i don't know i i'm you ma- you made it tough for me if if i've never okay i've never had a relationship like that but if i did if i had a close bond with somebody i don't think i could do it 

213.25 214.52 B: mhm 

217.80 221.76 B: yeah i i really don't think i could because i mean i 

221.92 230.70 B: as important as it it is for me to to be finan- i mean i'll i'll admit i'm pretty materialistic i i like stuff 

229.86 231.76 A: aren't we all [laughter] 

230.78 233.70 B: um [laughter] 

232.11 233.98 A: the wants never stop [laughter] 

233.75 242.41 B: oh yeah but i at the same time i think that i have found that for my emotional wellbeing that having 

242.88 246.89 B: the you know i have i would say that i really just have 

247.45 250.65 B: about two couples that are really 

251.03 261.08 B: what i'd call really close friends ah for me and my wife and really one of 'em even more than the other two i would have to count them probably as my best friends and the idea of 

260.99 264.98 B: being completely cut off uh from them just drives me out of my head they w- 

264.81 279.23 B: it was hard enough to to find them [laughter] you know somebody that i felt like really connected with me that closely and and related to me and and i could be completely comfortable around the idea of of after all this time now 

272.56 273.91 A: (( mhm exactly )) 

279.22 292.07 B: losing that even for a million i i just i i just don't think i could say yes i'd reg- regret it and they might even say to me i don't know that would have been something gene i'm like no i 

292.49 298.48 B: you know and not 'cause it's a noble thing to do but just i don't think i'd be emotionally healthy if i [laughter] 

296.99 300.78 A: you would you would never yeah you'd never feel good again about it 

300.17 308.91 B: yeah i'd be slightly unstable like you said every time you used that money for anything oh i'm so grate- grate- glad that i've got this pool that i can't share with my best friend 

308.98 310.01 B: (( ah )) 

310.01 317.28 A: but you know for me in my situation now i have a wife and three kids so my life is pretty busy looking for work new career all this stuff 

316.51 317.99 B: oh yeah 

317.39 323.17 A: and um i could do it right now [laughter] pick a person [laughter] uh-huh 

320.04 321.08 B: understood 

322.27 335.05 B: oh well they have a of course then comes the other complication like for example in in mine and my wife's relationship i- uh really if i was real honest about it my wife is my best friend you know what do you do th- 

332.65 335.84 A: well yeah well i could i could never do that 

335.27 337.38 B: yeah that that doesn't work at all 

336.87 340.26 A: no you could put a billion price tag and it wouldn't work [laughter] 

340.08 346.90 B: then of course there's the concept of what if you knew that the best friend was going to be 

347.88 350.65 B: i- i i guess what i'm thinking is 

350.82 355.99 B: let's say that you have to cut off your best friend as far as contact you get the million dollars 

353.99 358.60 A: but you had you still you're still seeing them every day or something like that 

357.72 363.04 B: well or maybe you give the million dollars to them or ha- or five hundred thousand and 

362.96 364.43 A: well that might work 

363.88 366.36 B: maybe they're financially strapped a- 

366.09 367.33 A: part ways 

367.52 382.46 B: yeah yeah that'd be it'd be it'd be a difficult emotional thing but you know especially if you've got a best friend that's financially strapped and for example uh the guy that's in the couple that i was thinking of [sigh] um he just got his hours switched around and cut again 

368.13 369.26 A: (( have a good life )) 

382.55 395.89 B: and he's he's he's got employment but he's looking for something else because what he's doing right now just makes him miserable and they could live real well for a long time off of five hundred thousand especially if they invested it right 

396.35 397.39 B: um 

397.58 399.83 A: yeah yeah as long as they didn't do it three years ago 

400.00 402.89 B: right [laughter] yeah no kidding 

400.55 404.25 A: [laughter] like me [laughter] 

402.94 404.84 B: i put all my stock into [laughter] 

404.89 408.04 B: all my money into stocks yeah that that wouldn't be any good 

406.21 411.82 A: well i i started investing fairly heavily about three years ago 'cause we had some money from an accident 

411.10 413.29 B: (( oh man )) 

411.71 421.55 A: and oh it was b- it's been bad 'cause then i just got out a college and we started i started looking for a career and we had we needed money and the stocks had been down [laughter] 

418.67 420.10 B: oh man 

421.13 422.64 B: (( that hurts )) 

422.43 423.64 A: (( but you just gotta )) 

422.73 430.16 B: i'm i'm proud to say that i don't have investments at all we're so broke that we [laughter] i ha- i have no cushion at all [laughter] 

426.45 429.20 A: [laughter] but it's still i 

429.57 438.54 A: but it's still a good thing i you know i wouldn't put it down because th- they always go up you just have to you just have to learn how to put it away and sit on it and not need that money [laughter] 

432.64 434.83 B: oh yeah 

437.80 444.05 B: yeah no kidding and just just hope and pray that in the years to come that everything rebounds so that you can get that back 

442.42 445.79 A: well it always it always does up and down right yeah you just gotta 

445.00 450.77 B: yeah i if if i were having to to retire any time soon 

451.01 464.44 B: that would be just that would be just driving me out of my head you know that's another consideration i just hadn't thought about on the hypothetical if you were already into your or you know into your senior years and your best friend was too 

453.43 455.15 A: yeah there's a lot of [laughter] 

465.07 471.73 B: maybe maybe even just to confuse the hypothetical situation even more maybe give you or them a terminal disease 

472.14 473.44 A: [laughter] 

472.97 474.05 B: [laughter] 

474.22 477.97 B: this is this is the problem with my brain it goes all kinds of strange directions 

478.14 479.27 B: um 

479.96 485.49 B: that [sigh] see again i still can't do do that though because you've got 

484.26 490.81 A: well i now i think if you're old no matter what you're gonna die soon anyway so five hundred thousand might be pretty fun 

490.60 495.18 B: yeah well at the same time though you might think well what good's the money gonna do me now anyway 

494.69 496.08 A: (( [laughter] well i don't )) 

495.38 497.32 B: if i'm not gonna live that long 

496.63 499.71 A: i don't know where was that place you wanted to go in the world that you never got to 

499.41 508.26 B: [laughter] fair enough [laughter] yeah there's some truth to that there's some truth to that boy that'd be hard 

500.35 502.02 A: (( you know what i you know what i mean )) 

502.29 503.69 A: go die there 

505.66 506.94 A: (( yeah yeah for sure )) 

508.17 508.92 A: that's 

508.77 521.01 B: what you need to do is you need to get the money then bribe the person who gave you the million into allowing you to see your friend if you give seven hundred and fifty thousand of it back you still end up with two hundred and fifty thousand 

520.21 530.50 A: [mn] well well you we gotta look at we gotta look at this side of it too you know whatever city this is in you just agree to meet on the other side of the world and they'll never find you anyway you could still be friends [laughter] 

521.61 522.41 B: (( [laughter] )) 

528.20 535.63 B: there you go well see that's the other thing is how do they know for certain that i never have contact with them again 

534.27 535.60 A: (( [laughter] oh )) 

535.70 536.95 A: yeah 

536.40 538.70 B: that's that's uh that that could cer- 

537.61 540.97 A: that's a tough that's a tough question all right when you think about it 

539.81 547.61 B: [sigh] that's a very challenging question um it sounds a little bit there's i've got a a book a l- small book called the book of questions 

547.76 561.09 B: uh that has all kinds of bizarre hypotheticals like that um where for example if you could take ten years off of your life but the taking of the ten years off of your life would allow them to discover a cure for cancer 

560.86 570.16 B: would you do it uh you know what if it took twenty five years off of your spouse's life you know i mean just all these q- you're going 

561.69 562.94 A: (( uh-huh instantly )) 

568.34 569.25 A: no 

570.09 577.47 B: how can you do this to me [laughter] but you sit around with a group of friends and you start discussing those things and it's oh it's 

577.75 579.26 B: mind boggling [sigh] 

578.67 583.43 A: [laughter] as long as it's i- it'll be okay as long as there's not too much wine involved 

579.40 580.54 B: yeah i i 

583.16 587.86 B: right there you go [laughter] could get could get strange then but 

583.66 584.52 A: [laughter] 

587.78 599.95 B: yeah i i think my final answer would have to be no i don't i don't see any any way that i could do it and i would hate it and i would i don't know whether the next question would be do you tell your best friend that you were offered
