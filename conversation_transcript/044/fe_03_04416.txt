0.00 1.99 B: (( hi my name is jeff what's your name )) 

1.73 3.13 A: uh jason 

2.97 4.08 B: hey jason 

4.58 10.71 B: so what do you think would you take the million dollars and give up um talking to your best friend 

4.97 5.78 A: (( what huh )) 

8.53 9.52 A: couldn't do it 

10.11 12.43 A: couldn't do it [laughter] 

12.10 15.25 B: i couldn't do it either why couldn't you do it 

13.30 14.50 A: (( [laughter] i )) 

15.04 19.07 A: uh well i mean c- you know 'cause pretty much you know 

19.81 25.65 A: best friends are you know what makes your life interesting i mean the thing is to say um i just visited him 

25.53 36.77 A: and i mean we had a great time he showed me his like his kids that he had uh he uh uh um he pretty much adopted me as his like older brother so all the kids know me as uncle jason 

36.50 37.46 B: uh-huh 

36.79 38.71 A: yeah so 

39.11 43.56 A: and we tell stories about what happened in high school and this that and the other thing i mean 

43.57 48.65 A: [mn] that right there is just you know you you can't pay for st- you know for stuff like that 

48.61 53.28 B: i'm in agreement i just think that i mean there's two things that stick in my first of all the best friend 

48.71 49.79 A: (( you know i mean i )) 

53.29 54.28 B: um 

55.23 59.54 B: i mean [lipsmack] i have a similar situation they don't call me uncle jeff they call me brother jeff 

59.16 60.52 A: mhm 

59.87 61.04 B: so 

61.18 66.10 B: it i- it is pretty special having a best friend and and a million dollars you can make that on your own 

66.09 67.82 A: exactly exactly 

66.81 70.71 B: that's number one and number two what really bothers me is the unknown benefactor 

70.70 72.58 A: ex- [laughter] 

71.53 75.89 B: because um you know what if the person got it through you know 

75.89 86.78 B: through something that i don't value or you know unscrupulous means you know what if he like what if he was you know frauded people to get it you know what i'm saying thinking like the milken family 

79.63 80.64 A: exactly 

84.15 88.58 A: exactly yeah well yeah exactly yeah what what if it if it's drug money you know 

88.13 99.87 B: right or or junk bonds like you know like michael milken i w- i wouldn't want his money f- for all the tea in china so tho- those are two factors the the best friend and the unknown benefactor they both weigh 

94.33 95.45 A: exactly 

100.46 103.57 B: heavily into my decision making 

103.44 110.74 A: e- exactly yeah well you you you know even if it was like you know say bill gates said hey here's a million but you can't you know i would still would [mn] 

110.78 118.63 A: forget it [laughter] 'cause like you said it's it's that there you're you if you really wanted to anybody would have the potential of making a million dollars 

111.96 112.85 B: right 

118.29 122.13 B: what if there was a time limit what if they say that you can't talk to your best friend for a year 

122.53 126.04 B: no communication with your best friend for a year would that 

122.73 123.42 A: no 

125.51 126.71 A: (( mm mm )) 

126.15 128.82 B: weigh in on your decision would it make it easier 

127.66 129.29 A: no no 

129.53 143.10 A: no uh you know not for you know not for a year ah you know it just because i mean you know it pretty much looks at in the end it's saying you know it's just like well in order for me to be best friends with you you know it's for a price [laughter] hm 

141.97 149.17 B: but what if you could leverage that what if that million dollars you could you could leverage it into ten million dollars and you could give your best friend a million 

150.75 153.52 B: you know i mean there's always that possibility 

151.75 152.90 A: yeah 

153.72 161.30 B: i mean for me a year if i h- if if there was a stipulation that i could say goodbye to my friend i mean it wasn't going to be like 

161.57 170.68 B: it wouldn't be a cut off immediately i got to tell my best friend listen this is the situation and nothing against you but it's only for three hundred and sixty five days 

161.91 162.88 A: permanent 

163.39 164.29 A: mhm 

170.80 178.91 B: and that'll be over before you know it because i mean there's been times like i've been away in europe or whatever where i haven't communicated with him f- 

176.92 177.79 A: right 

178.94 181.31 B: for like four or five months so 

181.79 183.37 A: hm well i guess 

182.30 187.36 B: i mean i think that i think that would that would definitely make it more enticing but still it's that whole unknown 

187.61 190.00 B: philanthropist that kind 

187.73 188.59 A: yeah 

189.88 192.46 A: yeah it it screws it up [laughter] 

190.33 195.99 B: of bugs me because i don't know i just i have a hard time with some of these philanthropists you know they 

196.11 201.54 B: they throw around their money but how they made it is is questionable 

200.81 203.18 A: exactly exactly yeah 

202.18 205.18 B: so uh i mean it's an interesting dilemma 

203.36 204.50 A: so yeah you just 

205.25 209.85 A: yeah you definitely you definitely have a good point about uh you know the time limit you know you know 

210.07 212.94 A: 'cause it you know l- like you said you know uh 

213.62 222.14 A: after it came to you know you know if it's just a year you know y- you know you could do a lot of good with that million dollars [laughter] 

221.21 228.59 B: right now what if what if it was different what can you think of a different scenario other than your best friend that you would do something for a million dollars 

226.04 227.21 A: (( [sigh] yes )) 

229.42 231.26 B: like would you go um 

232.74 235.56 B: would you parachute out for a million dollars 

234.95 237.34 A: yeah that yeah 

235.72 237.84 B: you would parachute i wouldn't parachute out 

237.75 242.45 A: uh yeah 'cause well the thing is that that's actually something that i wanna do [laughter] 

241.35 243.22 B: oh is to parachute 

242.67 245.27 A: yeah yeah to uh skydive so 

244.43 245.35 B: (( skydive )) 

245.38 247.18 A: uh you know so 

247.26 260.33 A: it's uh yeah i i w- i you know you gotta just give me you know you know more enticement and say hey you know if you do this you'll get a million dollars because i've always wanted to do it it's just that you know you know 'cause it is an adve- you know it is [lipsmack] 

260.54 264.69 A: you know three or four hundred dollars to do this 'cause it's a full you know if you're 

260.92 261.63 B: (( mm )) 

263.51 266.94 B: but it is interesting a million dollars is is not a lot of the money 

266.67 268.39 A: no no it's not 

267.81 272.43 B: i mean if it was ten million dollars i think the whole stakes would be a l- a little bit different 

272.74 276.35 B: would you live on an island by yourself for thirty days for a million dollars 

278.63 283.24 A: hm [lipsmack] probably well like do like a like a survivor type of thing 

280.60 281.52 B: yeah 

282.63 284.79 B: (( yeah yeah that's what i was thinking of )) 

284.31 286.36 A: (( yeah um uh i i you know i )) 

285.28 289.91 B: but they would provide the food and everything it wouldn't be like you wouldn't be like on your own i 

289.42 291.67 A: (( r- right right yeah you know it )) 

290.43 294.68 B: mean it it would be on a deserted island but there'd be enough you know provisions for 

294.68 295.95 A: right right 

295.12 296.49 B: for thirty days 

296.42 302.87 A: um i i you know if if i just h- you know had the the proper pr- provisions and also you know you know 

302.97 304.54 A: um you know uh 

304.91 308.03 A: the you know basic tools you know 

307.34 308.62 B: right 

308.05 311.31 A: uh you know that were also given you know like uh 

311.40 317.84 A: you know uh matches you know you know maybe like you know you know a a ah axe 

317.88 319.44 A: you know and uh 

319.71 322.15 A: and all the you know knife 

320.80 322.26 B: and a gun maybe 

322.39 333.42 A: yeah yeah [lipsmack] i uh j- just those you know basic things you know for you know basic survival you know then yeah i don't th- you know i think i can you know you know gut it out for you know thirty days [laughter] 

332.66 340.27 B: i also think the way a w- another way to kind of smooth things over with your best friend which i just thought of is like you would give your best friend half 

340.58 341.46 A: (( [noise] but )) 

341.48 344.21 B: you know hey this is an opportunity for both of us 

344.30 345.41 A: exactly 

344.33 346.04 B: to benefit 

345.51 347.89 A: exactly and especially with my best friend 

346.35 351.35 B: you know i'll give you you know 'cause there's there's nothing in the scenario that says you can't give give it away 

351.23 352.26 A: exactly 

352.27 366.38 B: but it says i mean if if we only had a year but this says forever if it's forever forget it but if the scenario was changed and it said you had a year then i would e- i would definitely give part of it to my friend my friend but i couldn't see myself 

357.66 358.72 A: exactly 

366.90 369.52 B: you know severing all ties forever 

369.91 375.55 B: i mean that's like no phone call no visits no emails no letters i mean that's 

369.97 371.07 A: (( exactly )) 

372.14 373.00 A: yeah 

376.13 380.55 B: that's a lot kinda like what you said it's like you know it's your experience 

376.33 377.38 A: too hard [noise] 

381.47 385.96 B: and also that's uh like what i said it's like you can make your own million dollars you don't need a 

385.08 386.75 A: mhm 

386.34 388.48 B: you don't need to get it hand delivered 

389.23 390.42 B: but um 

389.87 398.07 A: [mn] i wonder why they're thinking of this question [laughter] for the survey [laughter] 

394.31 395.88 B: (( i don't know but you know )) 

396.92 400.61 B: but it is it is interesting but i i i 

400.71 403.16 B: you know what about if it was a 

402.93 405.03 A: wh- what oh w- well how much 

403.95 410.18 B: other than your best friend what if it was like a parent a f- a relative would that would that have changed it 

410.74 416.92 A: uh well there's certain relatives that i don't really get along with so [laughter] [laughter] 

414.09 415.87 B: yeah so th- yeah 

415.95 420.00 B: i i could say the thing like if you've got to pick your relative that you would never talk to 

419.87 421.55 A: exactly yeah 

420.32 422.25 B: i think that would be easier 

422.20 430.63 A: exactly 'cause i mean like uh you know there's like uh uh my mom's brother my uncle uh he sort of just like uh 

422.60 424.32 B: than your best friend 

431.08 431.89 A: (( [sigh] [cough] )) 

432.04 440.69 A: l- l- let's just say he wasn't like the favorite in the family he had you know like he was one of those people that had a huge amount of potential but absolutely no drive 

435.11 436.03 B: uh-huh 

440.51 441.68 B: right right 

441.01 454.20 A: [laughter] so you know so you know like he was pretty much the butt of everybody's jokes but uh he and i got along great 'cause we saw eye to eye but uh something happened as uh you know 

448.47 449.34 B: yeah 

454.13 458.30 A: after his uh you know uh his father died uh my grandpa 

459.35 465.63 A: [cough] and he pretty much just like s- you know literally split you know 

465.55 480.45 A: he uh he and his uh his mom you know didn't h- you know you know see eye to eye he moved out and i haven't heard from him since and that's been almost oh dear like almost a a year and a half maybe two years ago mhm 

478.23 479.19 B: wow 

480.11 482.75 B: have you ever done a search to find him or anything 

480.49 481.15 A: i 

481.31 494.89 A: [noise] uh you know i pretty much i you know you know talk to family members and you know they know where he is you know a- and and i ask them how he is and you know from what they can you know what they call tell me he's 

488.67 489.65 B: oh they do 

494.65 496.88 A: (( you know he's alive and )) 

497.01 497.83 B: yeah 

497.12 499.63 A: working and i'm like well [lipsmack] 

499.74 508.79 A: gee thanks you know it's just like i'm like well [laughter] but you know the thing is is that if i if i can you know do this he could do the same [noise] 

508.90 511.64 A: [cough] and it it travels both ways so 

510.70 520.86 B: yeah no i agree but i getting back to the scenario but we can't go on too much of a diversion is the whole thing is like i guess that a million dollars is not a lot i don't even know if it was twenty million 

521.03 527.86 B: i don't know if i could put on a price on a best friend 'cause best friends are hard to form especially when you're in later in life 

523.24 525.05 A: [noise] right exactly 

527.92 529.04 A: exactly 

528.02 537.47 B: it's one thing in you know in in elementary school and stuff but you know they they become more and more valuable and harder to to form when you get older at least that's been my experience 

537.27 540.23 A: oh oh definitely definitely 'cause the thing is just 

539.01 542.19 B: and especially if you have a long history like my best friend we been friends 

543.40 545.98 B: best friends probably for twenty years 

546.03 555.25 B: at least i mean that's a [mn] kind of like what you said like we went to high school together and everything so it's like you know you have you have common history 

547.72 548.98 A: yeah yeah i mean 

552.38 553.88 A: yeah yeah 

555.03 559.17 A: m- exactly i mean and i think and i think that's pretty much how like you know 

555.50 556.65 B: (( a- and )) 

559.18 572.14 A: the proper way of like how a life is supposed to be it's like to supposed to get you know a handful of really good friends you know to to to get you through [noise] [laughter] because you know once you get older unfortunately you know 

572.09 581.08 A: getting older and things get more complicated [laughter] because you know you know like like say that if you like started hanging out with this 

581.03 588.20 A: you know one guy at like you know thirty five well he has a wife he has kids you know blah blah blah 

588.26 589.16 A: (( you know )) 

589.92 591.01 A: he can't really 

590.21 593.36 B: also the habits are already cemented and such 

593.24 596.13 A: exactly and you know l- like you know i 

596.36 599.89 A: you know i i guess that there there there can't be like you know you uh
