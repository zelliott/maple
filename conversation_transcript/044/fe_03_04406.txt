283.04 292.86 A: okay i i i'm just kind of curious i just wonder what that ah you know what what your what what you really do is is spiritual or 

283.99 284.74 B: (( ah )) 

293.21 295.01 A: enhancement or 

293.54 294.85 B: well 

294.98 302.06 B: yeah basically ah y- you know the bible sets out what a marriage should be 

301.53 302.88 A: right 

302.27 305.09 B: and in today's world 

305.34 314.82 B: you know these these youngsters they they don't know how to be married there's there's been too many divorces both in the church and out ah n- 

314.19 315.70 A: right right 

315.09 317.73 B: you know churches have ah 

317.77 320.19 B: well christians have just as high a 

320.24 326.03 B: if not even a little bit higher divorce rate than than the 

326.81 329.16 B: ah ah rest of the world and so 

327.98 331.73 A: where where where it's too easy for us to close our eyes 

331.72 333.33 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

332.48 344.14 A: and you know and look the other way i'd i i've been we have a very strong faith here in in our in our family with with our kids and and ah you know our very high high morals 

344.20 349.14 A: and so so ah so i i kind of understand i was just kind of curious what you 

344.36 345.31 B: sure 

349.19 349.97 A: (( ah )) 

349.85 350.55 A: what what 

350.56 355.44 A: what this is whether it's it's enhancement we've never been to one of those ah 

355.45 368.36 A: it's always been a challenge you know i've been a farmer all my life and and it's hard for me to get away milking cows and feed the pigs and everything but now that we're retired i'm almost thinking that that that might be something that would be 

361.94 363.12 B: oh yeah 

368.27 376.55 A: ah spiritual enrichment might really be something great for my wife our kids are are moved on now they're they're married and on their own 

375.62 377.27 B: mhm mhm 

376.63 377.86 A: (( and ah )) 

378.18 386.19 A: we have a and and i've always been been really involved in in church bits and that's very high on my priority list 

385.56 387.99 B: oh yeah well you know we ah 

388.02 395.84 B: w- what we're wanting to do and of course we're having to start small um but once we have our 

395.86 399.41 B: our um i._r._s. five oh one c. three 

399.41 412.36 B: then you know we're going to be ah kind of trying to get with some foundations and what we eventually would like to do is is set people up you know all over our valley here and then 

412.66 421.92 B: eventually just work the country and and you know meet with people and and go through our our our 

421.94 434.88 B: i guess you can just say programme with 'em you know what the bible says and and how it's worked with us and how it can work with with them and and then you know let them go ahead 

424.32 426.02 A: (( right right )) 

434.76 437.61 B: and meet with other people so that
