30.10 31.10 B: oh 

30.79 32.38 A: yeah it's nice down there 

32.71 38.12 A: very congested though i think the school system's probably better than up in uh chicago though [laughter] 

34.20 36.02 B: oh it's 

37.74 46.29 B: ah you're actually the school system down here is one of the worst in the country well florida is one of the worst in the country 

45.57 48.77 A: oh really chicago was named one of the worst also 

48.38 52.00 B: oh [laughter] 

50.01 54.57 A: so i know they've improved it somewhat as far as the ethical you know 

54.69 66.29 A: um standards the looks of the school and um they're putting a lot of money back into the property and the windows and doing a lot of um landscaping and that kinda thing 

67.19 69.28 A: so what about your schools down there 

70.92 74.36 B: [mn] [lipsmack] ah well as as far as what the 

74.44 77.93 A: as far as the curriculum or as far as the teaching 

78.60 83.22 B: yeah i think that in ge- in general the 

83.34 85.69 B: school system is is 

85.99 87.17 B: um 

87.24 91.13 B: the educational system overall is 

91.87 95.94 B: kind of nonsensical in many ways um [lipsmack] 

94.58 95.40 A: mhm 

96.69 104.44 B: i think generally what they do is or what is done across the the whole system is [cough] um 

104.62 111.89 B: i guess if you if you think of the the board that gets together at the beginning of the year and they decide what they wanna do 

111.99 113.00 B: um 

113.39 117.99 B: they basically say well we need more money and more training for our teachers 

117.38 118.43 A: mhm 

118.55 119.99 B: and um [lipsmack] 

120.67 122.45 B: so they they they 

122.88 126.15 B: say that's a plan and they get together the next year 

126.16 131.53 B: and uh they look back over the year and say well well we need more money and more training 

132.28 137.76 B: and uh someone else says sounds like a plan so they they go it 

137.99 151.37 B: and uh the year goes by and they get together the next year and and uh they say well we something's not working in our school system and uh somebody else says hey i got an idea and they say uh 

146.50 147.31 A: mhm 

151.21 157.38 B: how 'bout more money and more training it didn't work last year or the year before but let's try it again this year it'll work 

157.84 164.11 B: and then they get together the next year it's the same thing and it's always about money and training instead of um 

164.66 169.71 B: [lipsmack] finding a way of education and about how kids really learn 

169.90 176.69 B: and uh starting again in some way and um to me that's the definition of 

177.05 183.28 B: insanity when when you go and do the same thing over and over and over and expect different results 

183.02 183.89 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

183.63 184.70 B: and uh 

184.90 187.08 A: that's pretty much what they do here too 

186.96 188.28 B: (( yeah )) 

187.47 193.45 A: uh but it depends again what district you're in how well you're paid number one but they had done a poll 

193.60 198.56 A: and it was in the chicago tribune stating that so many of the teachers and also on the news were 

198.60 202.39 A: not accredited as far as their education went 

202.21 203.11 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

202.79 204.99 A: meaning that they weren't 

205.16 210.30 A: really up to par they couldn't pass the tests and for some reason they got their degree 

210.59 213.58 A: but they didn't know the basic stuff you know 

213.32 214.32 B: mhm 

213.71 216.28 A: so i mean then again that stands for 

216.34 220.43 A: you know the bad teaching system that they'd had and most of the people here 

220.69 227.76 A: um it seemed like what was ridiculous too is the fact that they bussed a lot of the children in from other districts 

228.14 228.70 B: (( [mn] )) 

228.14 235.81 A: and they felt that they weren't getting a lot of the minorities because they felt that they weren't getting an appropriate education in their neighborhood 

235.68 249.12 A: when basically all the chicago schools should have the same kind of accredited teachers and they would say well this district seems a little better so we're gonna bus all these kids and spend millions of dollars bussing these kids daily 

249.10 249.96 B: mhm 

249.46 252.48 A: to districts that are so far from their home 

253.02 260.78 A: and then again you come up with this fact that so many of the teachers aren't even up to par for what they should be teaching these kids you know 

260.51 262.42 B: yeah 

261.64 267.82 A: so i mean it's really it's a cyclic thing like you said and it's it's a matter of education number one 

267.89 273.96 A: they're supposed to be going to school pretty much like a nurse where they're constantly in an educated field 

274.05 277.74 A: and the union of course protects them pretty much and 

278.00 283.48 A: it's unfortunate and like i say with the chicago district anyway they're they're pretty much protected 

283.66 290.41 A: but then once they get tenure they were gonna stop that also they were pretty much um secure in their position 

290.85 298.93 A: and they wanted to all do that because they felt if the teachers were tenured and they weren't good teachers you know they couldn't really get rid of 'em 

299.04 299.76 B: (( mm )) 

299.67 307.76 A: so there's a lot of you know different ways of looking at things but still the educational system even though mayor dally in chicago is putting 

308.02 316.18 A: i think pretty much he put a lot of in the senate and everything i mean i think they put a lot of um money back into the educational system 

316.31 318.83 A: however our schools are still not 

318.84 324.61 A: you know even for a big big city i mean we're the third largest but they're still not up to par like what they should be 

324.30 332.59 B: yeah the the system is still the same though but they they they still just say more money more money and if they had all the money they needed 

330.26 331.14 A: right 

332.73 340.13 B: the education of the child is still not going to improve because i think that the premises is where we're wrong 

340.33 349.75 B: and the effect of educate- of of our educational system what the effect seems to be is it it just to keep them off the job market 

349.70 356.23 B: 'cause there aren't enough jobs for everyone um uh if if there was no school we would need 

351.90 352.73 A: right 

354.99 355.94 A: mhm 

356.40 358.89 B: more jobs for these people 

358.46 359.26 A: mhm 

359.07 364.61 B: and um but the the school is to educate them but we all it meant that 

364.72 371.23 B: most of what i learned i can't use or i don't remember after after the test is over 

368.62 369.52 A: right 

370.90 371.82 A: right 

371.26 377.31 B: and so it would seem that the best way of education is to um 

377.91 392.77 B: have specific fields sorta like if you can like a a buffet [laughter] and the child can go and choose um what he wants to learn but the problem comes then is that the higher up's wanna say that 

382.63 383.57 A: right 

385.51 386.48 A: mhm 

392.75 404.49 B: um that person's not well rounded and they think that everyone should be the same and go in and come out the the same [cough] uh with the same education and then uh 

395.20 396.00 A: mhm 

404.84 416.10 B: um but that it's not practical the effect isn't what they want and i don't know why they don't realize that and i know one thing they did down here in florida was 

411.64 412.58 A: mhm 

416.16 417.35 B: um 

417.39 424.65 B: they're cutting the arts out and of course we always hear that threat overall all the time throughout the schools 

424.75 431.62 B: and some schools are getting cut and some don't but now all of florida because of uh governor bush 

431.65 435.86 B: is you know talking about cutting all the arts and sports 

435.53 436.43 A: wow 

436.11 439.70 B: and to me if you don't have if you don't have 

440.05 444.66 B: arts and sports what are you gonna read and write about um 

443.78 444.80 A: mhm 

445.11 456.32 B: it's not life isn't all about the the math reading writing and arithmetic and that's not that's not real education to me there's no life in that education 

455.60 469.56 A: no i think that's important too because i never looked at it as being that important of an area but i think again with the sports especially i mean the art is more of a creative type ability that some children don't have but it's good to expose them to it 

469.70 474.32 A: um however the sports area is you know there's so many um 

474.15 474.77 B: (( [cough] )) 

474.79 488.15 A: uh today that are obese and they said that because of lack of exercise going home watching the t._v. and pretty much being stagnant and not doing much i mean these kids need this activity in the school 

488.32 497.31 A: program you know they really to to cut that is not a good thing especially for male children that wanna be out there playing ball at recess or 

489.20 491.02 B: mhm 

497.35 502.75 A: a reason you know having that sports curriculum or having after school things even with high school 

502.96 509.33 A: i mean it's really an important factor for these kids but i too believe that they should be more rounded in what they're learning 

509.48 515.59 A: because like you say you forget so much of it and i think they should learn more about finances number one 

515.85 523.36 A: uh what checkbooks are like you know how to balance them i mean basic living which they're not teaching the kids in the schools today 

523.28 525.18 B: mhm 

523.73 535.60 A: and these kids are all coming out they're getting credit cards thrown at 'em outta high school and they're just not sure what they're gonna do with them they're going in debt there's a lot of problem out there with the with the society today 

534.00 534.95 B: yeah 

535.84 540.01 A: because they're not learning the basic things in high school where you know 

540.07 550.45 A: like you say it's nice to be diverse but they need to be diverse in some other areas and um it's okay to have a buffet and to be able to take what program they'd like to take 

550.52 554.30 A: but there's a lot of essentials that they should be learning and they're not learning 

554.51 558.44 A: and that can go early on basically from the grade school level and up 

559.21 569.35 A: so it's unfortunate that the curriculum is pretty much um i don't know how differential what the differential is from when i was in school back in the sixties but uh 

569.87 580.50 A: i don't know if the the subject matter is that much different or if it's a lot of the basic things and um of course you have to learn the basics in grade school but in high school i think it should be a little more diversified 

581.00 583.21 B: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

581.52 589.35 A: but like you say they cut off the arts and everything you know there's a lot of artistic ability out there and there's kids that aren't aware that they have the artistic ability 

589.15 591.08 B: mhm 

589.55 597.29 A: and it's stress reducer for them too when they get in the upper grades to see that they have the music or the the art talent you know 

596.98 598.46 B: (( mhm )) 

597.53 599.89 A: and my brother he's an art teacher down there
