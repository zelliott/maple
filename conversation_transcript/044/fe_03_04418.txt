0.37 1.99 A: crega mccoy 

1.82 3.39 B: my name's provo 

9.40 12.56 B: so we're supposed to talk about the benefactor thing 

12.07 13.31 A: (( oh okay )) 

13.67 20.38 A: well no i don't think i would i'd d- ditch my best friends just for a million dollars 

22.40 25.21 B: just for a million bucks you wouldn't ditch your best friend 

25.10 26.04 A: no 

25.89 32.17 B: [laughter] um i'd i'd i'd have a hard time with that myself but i think i would 

32.27 36.32 A: and you would uh never again you'd never talk to him 

35.74 38.90 B: yeah i think that would be fine um 

39.60 40.41 B: it 

40.89 43.71 B: it it you know it's a million bucks 

43.74 45.42 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

43.80 45.05 B: i mean it's not 

45.14 54.73 B: i mean i have i have my uh kids and my wife so it doesn't really matter um if i didn't have the best friend i mean it it would suck but you know what else am i g- you know it's a million bucks 

55.00 57.23 A: yeah i can understand that also 

56.94 58.59 B: (( yeah i mean and y- you know )) 

57.80 60.80 A: but it comes down i guess to uh [lipsmack] 

60.98 64.75 A: it comes down to uh the idea of loyalty 

65.81 74.66 A: you know what wouldn't you do for money then if it comes if you wouldn't if you wouldn't i mean a million dollars is a lot of money but 

74.73 78.98 A: would you destroy a whole nation for ten million dollars 

78.54 79.43 B: no 

80.21 82.06 A: i mean what's the difference 

82.57 85.19 B: uh the difference it affects more people 

84.99 86.42 A: yeah 

85.80 98.57 B: yeah if it's just affecting one or two people i don't think it's a big issue if it affects you know for ten million to ruin a nation now that's too high of a price there's no price in the world that get me to do something like that 

98.67 101.00 B: 'cause it affects too many people 

100.96 102.06 A: well 

103.97 109.16 A: [lipsmack] i don't i don't know i it that's just like saying would you give your child away 

109.44 110.44 A: you know 

110.55 113.38 A: it do- it is does one person 

113.78 117.02 A: if you would you give your child away to save a million people 

118.35 121.93 A: di- she doesn't have to die i mean just give her away 

122.67 126.56 A: to another family and you'd lose her forever and never see her again 

126.22 127.90 B: to save a million people 

126.57 127.44 A: but 

127.70 130.67 A: to save a million people from being 

130.94 132.05 A: murdered 

132.69 133.58 B: yes 

133.67 135.07 A: you'd do that 

134.48 135.64 B: yep 

136.65 141.67 B: and hoping and hoping that uh he or she would understand why i did what i did 

136.88 137.72 A: (( i'm mm )) 

142.18 144.32 B: because it's it's a lot of people 

144.21 145.65 A: yeah 

145.07 148.10 B: um and i gotta believe that uh 

148.50 158.41 B: there would be some good that would come out of that i mean if i you know that i would i w- i i would see doing that too i mean i wouldn't give her up for a million bucks but to save a million lives i certainly would 

159.45 160.70 A: yeah 

160.11 161.15 B: i mean 

161.17 167.19 B: it's it's you know it's more more likely it's better for the group of people than it is for the one individual it's 

168.71 169.64 B: i don't know 

168.82 171.25 A: well i believe that the individual 

172.65 183.61 A: rights supersede those of the next individual not supersede the rights of him but he has the i mean just because the uh the majority rules the minority has rights also 

183.56 185.16 B: i understand 

184.82 188.27 A: and just because it's the one million people 

188.73 189.88 A: that are 

190.03 191.26 A: up for 

191.52 193.52 A: (( that that that are )) 

193.82 195.67 A: up for ri- that are at risk 

195.91 202.56 A: i mean compared to that one person who knows what that one person could do there's and there's also a lot a 

203.08 205.91 A: [lipsmack] stuff behind stuff so if you were to give 

205.92 210.73 A: if you were to never speak to your friend again for one million dollars 

211.11 214.64 A: what other stuff well i mean why would that even 

215.05 225.25 A: but if this is the hypothetical situation s- then there's all it's still there can be stuff behind it so why would it why would someone give you a million dollars to stop speaking to your best friend 

225.00 229.58 B: well no one would but if they w- but if they would i mean [sigh] [mn] 

226.15 227.56 A: what situation 

229.53 243.77 B: i don't pl- i mean i place a a value on friendship but uh i mean if they were to give me a million dollars to leave my wife i wouldn't do it but for i mean 'cause the family and and the and the spouse relationship is much more important than a friendship 

236.54 237.76 A: yeah 

244.30 245.30 A: okay 

244.97 258.78 B: because you got to live with that the rest of your life especially if you have kids if i w- if i didn't have kids then it would be a different story um but it's for the benefit of the kids that i would you know wouldn't leave the wife for a million bucks but for friends 

258.92 261.60 B: you know as long as i got to keep the wife and kids hey 

261.72 266.66 A: (( yeah i can understand that it's i don't know )) 

267.85 273.94 B: it it it's a difficult thing to say it but um above all i think it's it's gotta to be the best solution 

274.66 279.15 B: but i don't know there is no right or wrong answer i guess that's that's a hypothetical situation 

278.03 283.84 A: yeah that's the whole thing about it but i don't i just can't just i can't even 

284.28 293.42 A: i can fathom i guess it's it's understa- i can i can see it'd be for me if i was in a situation where i really needed a million dollars 

294.76 304.03 A: maybe but at the same time i have to really think about why would would someone give me a million dollars to stop talking to my friend 

304.16 313.70 A: what would make that so important if it's if it's important if it's a- as impor- if it's worth a million dollars for me to stop talking to them then 

314.63 317.00 A: is it worth ten million dollars 

317.74 321.44 A: is it worth a hundred million dollars if it's that important 

321.49 324.11 A: so that's something i have to think about also 

323.84 338.14 B: right yeah i guess you have to look at it on the other e- end of the spectrum too i mean why yeah what what would the person giving you a million dollars benefit by paying you the million dollars not to talk to the friend i mean i you know i don't honestly know how that uh 

334.60 335.69 A: yeah 

338.55 343.54 B: you know why they would do that but i suppose that would have a an issue as well but 

343.59 345.85 A: i think that would be the biggest issue 

345.90 351.50 A: because just acting on it just because it's a million dollars it i mean 

352.93 360.37 A: it it just doesn't make any sense it's it's not a it just the whole the situation doesn't really make sense unless 

360.75 369.03 A: you have some kind of background behind to understand why they would give you a million dollars other other than just to stop talking to your friend 

369.39 371.29 B: yeah 

371.65 374.30 B: but you could do a lot of good with the million dollars too 

374.47 375.65 A: yeah 

375.30 381.72 B: i mean again if you were uh uh a- an individual who liked to give money away for particular 

381.86 386.92 B: charity groups that money could do a lot of good just not talking to your friend to benefit a lot more people 

387.43 396.62 A: but then think of that if your friend were to find that out and he decided to go just go crazy he or she just decided to go crazy and just go 

396.89 399.50 A: bomb a building or something you know 

399.24 400.26 B: mhm 

399.65 402.57 A: was that million dollars worth all of that 

401.99 402.87 B: no 

403.07 404.71 A: it wasn't 

404.13 410.75 B: no it wasn't but i would hope but if i knew they were that unstable i don't think i'd be friends with them anyway 

405.46 406.43 A: so 

410.20 415.70 A: [laughter] yeah that's true that's something to think about yeah 

412.23 413.52 B: [laughter] 

414.49 415.45 B: yeah 

416.82 420.87 B: and and i would hope i would be able to pick that up if they were that unstable 

417.16 418.10 A: (( but )) 

420.95 422.22 A: yeah 

421.61 426.16 B: but i guess you know there are si- situations bring about drastic feelings i suppose 

426.01 434.06 A: yeah and that is i mean just getting a million dollars that's a real dra- especially if you're not if you weren't anywhere near a million dollars 

434.21 438.00 A: you know anywhere getting a million dollars uh 

438.01 443.59 A: it that's that's a situation that's drastic right there so i guess that's something you have to think about [mn] 

444.20 444.98 A: i 

445.10 453.43 A: it's something that i i had to think about really you know something i think about a lot just to to come to that but just 

453.44 457.35 A: if someone proposed me with the question i'd have to say no 

457.28 461.92 B: yeah yeah i'd i'd i would do it in a second 

461.32 462.92 A: yeah 

462.32 469.02 B: yeah even if they were a life long friend i'd i'd do it in a second it would just benefit too many people in my life outside a 

465.86 466.84 A: yeah 

469.11 473.08 B: outside a my best friend to uh not do something like that 

473.17 480.66 A: well let's say this person gave you a million dollars and you stopped talking to your best friend and then a year later 

480.79 482.55 A: he says okay 

482.70 488.61 A: he knows that a- a- i mean you you you start the little lifestyle that's a million there okay 

488.99 491.28 A: soon he come he comes to you again 

497.17 498.04 B: (( hello )) 

507.49 508.51 B: (( [noise] ))
