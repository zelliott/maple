1.66 3.86 B: hi my name is randy 

3.29 4.34 A: (( oh hey )) 

4.20 5.49 B: how ya doing 

4.94 6.47 A: (( [lipsmack] i'm good how are you )) 

5.93 8.27 B: good do you kids in the schools or 

7.86 21.67 A: uh i did they're all grown now but um i felt that um [lipsmack] a lot of um controls were being taken away at the time uh they graduated in um [lipsmack] nineteen ninety nine so 

20.82 22.03 B: (( [noise] okay )) 

21.76 22.86 A: um 

22.73 24.07 A: i felt that 

23.84 26.37 A: the kids were getting away with too much and 

26.16 39.76 A: you know taking these big book bags and no telling what they would have in them and i always felt that they should've had um mail uh mail detectors and some schools here do and some don't but i think that [lipsmack] there just needs to be um 

30.22 31.34 B: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

39.68 44.95 A: [lipsmack] more discipline and more structure environments for them 

44.86 46.65 B: i i don't disagree 

46.25 47.50 A: mhm 

46.69 48.93 B: i don't disagree um 

49.08 56.33 B: currently i have a very young girl um that we send to private school which is [laughter] which is kind of outrageous 

51.07 51.81 A: mhm 

53.64 55.36 A: mhm mhm 

56.14 60.94 A: i can imagine but uh my kids went to private school too in the elementary years so 

60.31 65.65 B: yeah is that right well that's probably the most important time i think then they get into the habits and uh 

61.27 62.34 A: mhm 

63.25 64.69 A: yeah me too 

65.22 66.46 A: mhm 

65.84 67.72 B: (( and uh where where ya from )) 

67.58 68.60 A: alabama 

68.15 71.48 B: from alabama yeah are ya anywhere near chickesaw falls 

68.76 70.96 A: mhm i live in georgia now 

71.36 72.05 A: (( hm )) 

71.79 75.13 B: (( are you anywhere anywhere near chickesaw falls )) 

74.96 76.56 A: (( uh no [mn] )) 

75.54 79.80 B: that's outside m- i guess it's down near mobile i have some uh r- my brother lives there 

79.43 80.54 A: (( oh okay )) 

80.26 88.94 B: yeah how do these now how do these things work i i did one of these other phone calls before they don't interview or anything after or 

80.95 81.96 A: mhm 

88.52 97.96 A: [noise] um no at at the end of it it'll say if you want to comment on you know what you talked about then you press one and you can say something so sometimes i do and sometimes i don't 

95.01 95.78 B: (( mm )) 

97.39 101.23 B: yeah what do they get out what they tape it then they analyze it or something or 

100.63 113.47 A: yeah i think so uh-huh i think they're doing um a linguistics study so they're like you know seeing how people relate to each other in talking in conversations whether they know each other or not mhm right 

101.32 103.34 B: oh they do oh okay 

107.76 108.62 B: (( [noise] )) 

109.48 119.00 B: i see oh that's right it's a ling- linguistics study got it yeah you know it's fun- do you um do you think do you approve of school vouchers or you're against them 

113.90 114.76 A: yeah 

118.46 119.75 A: um 

120.28 121.45 A: well 

123.30 125.48 A: i think i'm kinda against them 

125.19 128.87 B: yeah is that right just philosophically why just out of curiosity 

128.99 130.78 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

131.01 139.91 A: because i think if people want to um [lipsmack] send their kids to private school or whatever i think they should be responsible for it like i had to be when i was doing it 

139.29 141.21 B: mhm 

140.06 143.96 A: [lipsmack] and i think that it's taking away from the public schools 

144.05 145.82 B: yeah well i don't think there's 

145.74 157.56 B: too much question about that i think the old the ra- the real rationale behind it should just be you know you've got x. amount of dollars you know to uh to spend on your kids and you can kinda decide where you want where you want your kids to go 

147.14 148.11 A: mhm 

151.84 152.82 A: mhm 

154.34 155.74 A: mhm 

157.06 158.02 A: right 

157.46 167.33 B: you know if they've got the right grades you know in a perfect world that should work i guess 'cause technically you'd send 'em you know to what you felt was the best value for your money 

158.90 159.98 A: right 

161.57 162.79 A: yeah 

166.54 168.26 A: mhm yep 

167.34 172.85 B: but i can certainly [laughter] understand if you've been all the way through it you know why you don't think other people should do the same 

170.32 171.39 A: (( yep )) 

172.93 173.91 A: right 

173.04 176.41 B: but it's just kinda just double the effort because you pay um [lipsmack] 

176.89 185.20 B: you know you pay a lot of money probably most of your property taxes go towards schools schools would average probably like sixty percent schools 

180.55 181.90 A: (( that's right )) 

183.32 186.10 A: i know and then every year it's going up 

185.53 191.40 B: and then when you you know have to pay private school on top of that it's like well what do i pay all my tax money for 

188.04 189.62 A: (( mhm )) 

190.65 192.05 A: exactly 

191.58 192.50 B: you know 

192.08 193.57 A: mhm 

192.80 203.12 B: you know i don't buy the argument you know for older people uh you know to to your kids are grown but you know that's that's kinda too bad [laughter] you should have to pay for it 'cause it's an intergenerational thing 

202.39 203.48 A: yeah 

203.53 204.72 B: but uh 

203.64 204.57 A: yeah 

204.79 209.85 B: yeah i know how ya huh i hear i'm a product of you know i went to public schools and 

209.20 210.76 A: mhm so did i 

210.51 212.74 B: [lipsmack] yeah and you know i did okay 

212.22 213.10 A: me too 

212.96 213.94 B: um 

213.12 218.92 A: me too i did fine you know i felt but you know things have have really really changed a lot 

214.40 216.37 B: [lipsmack] but boys schools have changed though 

218.49 219.91 B: things have changed 

219.07 222.18 A: when we were growing up i thought that um 

221.96 236.26 A: that teachers cared a lot more you know if you weren't really doing something they would take the time and they would call your parents i mean i i remember getting um my parents called on me a couple of times and it you know it made me straighten out and know that if i didn't and they saw me they were gonna tell you know 

227.68 228.79 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

229.89 230.45 B: (( [mn] )) 

235.71 238.26 B: mhm no you're right 

236.48 245.84 A: yep so but nowadays the teachers i mean they don't really have the time and they don't want to take the time to 'cause they have kids of their own so you know 

244.29 245.28 B: mhm 

245.60 252.35 B: [lipsmack] well you know what's funny about it uh coup- there have been a couple of times in the last seven years where i've been briefly un- unemployed 

252.00 252.97 A: mhm 

252.18 264.36 B: i did some substitute teaching and uh in in a local high school and you know what's interesting i was in the teachers' lounge with the attendant teachers and you know to hear them talk it was uh and this could just be this particular school [lipsmack] 

253.67 254.84 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

263.82 264.85 A: mhm 

264.43 276.83 B: but for the most part this was the most demoralized dispirited group i've ever dealt with and uh you hear 'em talking with each other at lunch they talk about how rotten the kids are and how stupid the administration is 

269.66 270.90 A: i could imagine 

273.73 275.09 A: [laughter] 

276.28 277.94 A: (( oh no )) 

277.15 285.05 B: and uh you know how what a what a rotten deal they're getting you know and i put in my kind of naive two cents in and said look the kids are no different really 

280.37 281.48 A: yeah 

281.80 283.41 A: mhm 

284.66 285.75 A: really 

285.11 294.57 B: from when i went to school they're no better no worse deep down the administration's no sm- smarter or stupider than they [laughter] were back then i mean it's just different 

287.51 288.47 A: right 

288.52 289.47 A: right 

292.60 293.46 A: i know 

293.27 303.95 A: they always do this though because i have a girlfriend and she works uh for the school system she is always crying and complaining about how you know they do this they do that 

299.63 301.64 B: always complaining i said you know 

303.04 304.41 B: absolutely 

303.75 314.90 A: and she's always running her mouth you know and i tell her too i said well look i think that if you would um [lipsmack] not talk so much then things would be better for you you know and stop trying to get in everybody's business 

314.53 316.33 B: [mn] [lipsmack] and you know there was this one 

316.14 323.78 B: i got i got one one of the classes i substituted for was girls' gym okay girls' gym the period the classes are about fifty minutes long 

319.75 320.72 A: mhm 

323.27 324.30 A: mhm 

323.60 331.73 B: all right you've got ten minutes to dress fifteen minutes you know to shower and all that [laughter] and that means you've got about like twenty minutes and basically this 

325.55 326.42 A: mhm 

326.80 328.94 A: mhm right right 

330.67 332.42 A: to do anything 

331.74 339.18 B: this entails rolling out a bunch of basketballs and saying play ball rolling out some badminton and say play badminton and you watch 'em for twenty minutes 

332.70 333.52 A: (( mm )) 

334.63 336.75 A: mhm mhm 

337.23 340.11 A: mhm mhm 

338.99 346.81 B: you go read the paper for for forty five minutes [laughter] and you've got you know you've got a lunch break and you've got two free periods you've got summers off 

341.20 342.34 A: right 

344.65 345.96 A: (( yeah )) 

346.34 351.82 A: mhm and then they're they're getting paid you know paid summers 

346.83 348.77 B: and you're done at two thirty 

349.46 354.56 B: yeah and you're done at you're done at two thirty in in the afternoon your day is done 

352.78 353.88 A: yeah 

354.00 355.30 A: exactly 

354.63 358.31 B: and you're making fifty thousand dollars a year [laughter] 

357.12 359.63 A: well she's not making quite that much but 

358.64 365.12 B: well it depends what area in the country you live too like northeast may be a little bit more this was somebody who'd been there for a long time [lipsmack] 

360.68 363.06 A: right that's true mhm 

364.24 369.43 A: yeah but you know i'm like this if you don't like it then find something find another profession 

369.25 370.80 B: oh ab- absolutely 

369.95 378.45 A: and stop always badmouthing the kids because if they could the teachers tell the kids that they're bad then they are going to be bad mhm 

372.02 373.35 B: absolutely 

376.58 377.81 B: (( pretty bad )) 

377.82 391.04 B: and you know the kids listen to it you know i don't know i don't i don't know how old you are but i was a child in the seventies and you know kids will you know they're gonna rebel against their parents a little bit and they're gonna they're basically deep down they're not a bunch of psychopaths 

379.30 380.36 A: i know 

382.77 384.46 A: mhm i guess 

384.88 385.96 A: so was i 

386.73 387.81 A: mhm 

390.56 392.28 A: no no 

391.24 397.09 B: uh you know you still have x. amount of kids that come from families with real problems if you're in a poor area 

395.70 397.35 A: right that's true 

397.08 410.44 B: you know and that's that's sad you do the best you can with that but you know that's a certain amount t- the basic seventy or eighty percent of them are kinda the same they're not too bad they'll work about as high as you push 'em [laughter] you know 

400.25 402.20 A: mhm mhm 

405.21 406.20 A: right 

408.03 420.70 A: mhm mhm right and they want to be good some of them do you know and then some of them don't no matter what you try and do but you know that's like uh c- not making the good apple suffer for what the bad ones do 

411.94 413.02 B: yeah 

420.42 425.73 B: mhm no you're right but boy all they do is grass about how rotten the kids are and you know 

420.81 422.32 A: so yeah 

424.39 432.17 A: mhm and that's part of the problem right there is the teachers not being more positive and they have very low morale 

431.90 442.51 B: could be yeah i think you're absolutely right and it be a lot of these guys are or a lot of people got into teaching in the sixties and seventies and they're getting near the end of their careers and they're a little worn out 

432.44 433.96 A: mhm 

438.44 439.63 A: mhm 

440.42 441.53 A: yeah 

441.91 445.59 A: right and they just wanna go home and and retire mhm 

443.90 450.00 B: yeah and when i was there there were probably you know in their twenties and starting out all bright eyed and bushy tailed 

447.43 454.11 A: mhm right right and it's really changed for them now mhm 

450.11 451.26 B: so maybe that's 

452.49 458.07 B: yeah so maybe it's kind of uh but you know now they're getting paid a lot of money 'cause they're very senior 

456.75 457.80 A: yeah 

458.02 459.02 A: right 

458.41 463.37 B: so i mean technically you expect more of them than you do of the younger ones not not less 

461.69 462.73 A: that's true 

463.03 464.08 A: that's true 

463.72 466.52 B: you know and uh i was getting 

465.11 468.12 A: but some of them just don't wanna do their job no matter what 

466.90 477.60 B: [lipsmack] boy i was getting a lot of work too because uh they had x. amount of sick days they could take on the unit believe me they took every single one of them [laughter] 

471.92 473.35 A: oh yep 

474.05 481.15 A: uh-huh i i know [laughter] a lot of the substitute teachers they get quite a bit of work because they they don't wanna do it [lipsmack] 

478.93 479.75 B: (( oath )) 

480.18 484.20 B: i got called every day there wasn't a day i wanted to work that i didn't get called 

481.42 483.62 A: really [laughter] 

484.28 485.50 A: (( wow )) 

484.50 488.63 B: and i didn't even i don't have a master's degree you know i'm not like i'm some hotshot 

486.88 487.90 A: mhm 

488.23 489.29 A: right 

488.72 493.69 B: highly it's just that uh you know they have it's a fairly big school system where i live 

492.73 493.75 A: mhm 

493.99 500.31 B: [lipsmack] and there's a lot of teachers and [laughter] there's a lot of teachers calling in sick any given day you know [lipsmack] 

496.63 497.53 A: yeah 

498.03 502.36 A: exactly they just don't wanna go and um you know put up with it 

501.09 507.80 B: and you get you get like towards the end of you know beginning of may when the weather turns they're worse than the kids they're cutting school more than the kids are 

506.27 511.64 A: yeah yep and they can't wait until it's out when is school out where you live 

511.62 526.01 B: [lipsmack] uh depending on what see i live in the northeast so because of snow days the last day of school will change depending on the amount of time they've missed because they have to put in certain minimal hours but generally they'll go right through the beginning of june 

514.63 515.42 A: uh-huh 

516.31 517.22 A: okay 

518.09 519.40 A: oh right 

519.73 520.67 A: uh-huh 

525.73 527.56 A: oh okay so 

526.44 536.17 B: through like june so it'll be anywhere from may twenty fifth to like june tenth depending on but this is a bad winter so i think the kids will be gonna right through 'til about uh june seventh or eighth [mn] 

530.25 531.07 A: okay 

531.82 533.07 A: mhm 

535.99 541.58 A: oh okay i know they hate that our teachers i think are getting out like next week and the week after 

539.81 540.47 B: (( oh )) 

541.24 543.06 B: (( but that's early do )) 

541.93 546.66 A: yeah and some have probably i think some have have already um gotten out 

546.03 548.40 B: they start after labor day or before 

548.16 553.21 A: [lipsmack] uh they start before like the twenty eighth of august i think yeah 

549.59 551.36 B: before labor day okay 

551.47 555.16 B: oh okay so we start after labor day too then that could have something to do with it 

554.55 556.87 A: yeah sure could yeah 

555.81 561.72 B: so i think there's some sort of national standard where they've gotta go x. amount x. number of days or x. number of hours 

561.16 562.26 A: mhm 

562.02 562.58 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

563.00 572.96 A: yeah but i t- i wish it would get better you know and a- another thing i think though too is that [lipsmack] when they took prayer out that you know 

572.70 574.13 B: mhm 

573.71 576.72 A: just like opened the door for a lot of other things you know 

575.82 577.38 B: [lipsmack] oh sure 

577.55 580.68 B: actually my biggest beef is in putting political 

580.76 585.94 B: you know putting their political views you know on whatever for the kids 'cause that's not 

582.64 585.83 A: mhm mhm mhm right 

586.21 595.10 B: not the beef whether their views are right or wrong they're not there to be teaching political views to to kids you know they teach 'em facts and figures and 

588.27 589.47 A: mhm 

590.71 592.76 A: no they sure don't 

593.05 593.95 A: right 

594.24 595.42 A: mhm 

595.21 596.11 B: you know 

595.59 596.93 A: exactly 

596.23 599.89 B: oh you know when they come i i had uh my sister came
