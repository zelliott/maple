167.67 169.64 B: ah you now that's 

168.87 178.95 A: well if you put it in if you put it into the bank even if it was only gaining a a three percent in a in some sort of an account shoot that's 

174.83 175.81 B: uh-huh 

177.42 181.64 B: right that's thirty thousand dollars a year you could live off the interest 

180.00 182.18 A: [noise] right

215.41 223.22 B: you know so i mean you you break it down i mean if you only have three people well [laughter] one person that's that's a lot 

218.83 221.87 A: [noise] 

222.95 224.17 A: right 

223.36 228.18 B: but if you have like you know a hundred or so well what's one out of a hundred

246.85 248.04 B: (( ah )) 

248.86 256.54 B: basically he's yeah i i have i haven't seen him in a while i mean it's not because it's because um 

257.60 265.45 B: you know i i don't get to see him it's just we have different schedules and different times and stuff so i haven't talked to him in a while 

258.21 262.84 A: (( yeah [noise] so )) 

263.00 266.14 A: [noise] right [noise] pep- people living lives [noise] 

266.49 268.74 B: yeah and then what would he say 

268.97 272.86 B: you know what what what would your best friend say in that situation too 

272.94 274.31 A: yeah you know i 

273.12 279.61 B: would would would he say bad things about you to other people and would that ruin other friendships 

278.93 279.59 A: (( [noise] )) 

279.55 289.91 A: yeah i don't i don't think that in my case that he would if he i think that in my case he would he would probably be understanding of it 

289.61 290.61 B: uh-huh 

289.79 298.05 A: but but at the same time hurt because um i i was thinking of the shoe was on the other foot and he did it to me 

293.06 293.90 B: uh-huh 

298.59 301.89 A: you know i would think well shoot it's a million dollars

302.33 304.35 A: more power to you you know 

303.53 309.31 B: (( w- wish him wish him while you give you you'd wish him well and move on and )) 

307.84 310.32 A: (( r- right right right )) 

309.56 311.14 B: oh gees 

311.62 314.91 A: (( so well [noise] )) 

312.22 322.58 B: now does that mean speaking to him or you can't be in his well that's speaking to him you know i mean you it doesn't mean you can't be 

318.27 320.12 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

322.66 324.68 B: not near him 

325.15 326.67 B: you know i mean 

325.74 335.59 A: well see yeah that's another too is i mean my circle of friends is the same circle of friends he and i have he and i have oh 

332.29 333.28 B: uh-huh 

335.55 342.88 A: there's probably ten or fifteen people that we both associate with you know that we that we both consider friends 

339.70 340.73 B: (( uh-huh )) 

343.10 344.08 A: so 

343.22 345.04 B: oh that's true too 

344.78 351.33 A: it would make it would make a really you know like a barbecue on the fourth of july would be really interesting you know 

350.66 355.03 B: (( ah yeah [laughter] )) 

353.56 362.37 A: [laughter] [noise] ah because odds are that if if you went to somebody's house he would be there or you know or they would be coming here so 

358.50 359.53 B: uh-huh 

362.09 363.21 B: right 

362.39 365.00 A: [noise] yeah it would it would be weird 

364.47 372.85 B: i wonder if that does that mean physically conversing with him or writing him a letter or any type of conversation with him 

372.24 375.91 A: (( [noise] i know it's speaking to him [noise] )) 

375.37 378.78 B: i mean you could you write him a letter could you 

378.62 380.99 A: email [laughter] 

378.89 381.71 B: email him could you 

382.04 390.76 B: you know could you talk to him through a an iniar- like an intermediary like if he was married talk to his wife and then 

382.53 383.55 A: (( yeah )) 

389.65 391.12 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

390.93 397.19 B: then his wife would talk to him and then he would talk to his wife and then his wife would answer back for you 

396.92 398.29 A: right [noise] 

397.54 403.38 B: i mean what what type of ah you know could you do it that way 

401.15 402.90 A: i don't i don't think 

403.11 405.41 A: [noise] i honestly i don't think 

405.48 416.69 A: that that even if you if you said yeah i'll take it and i won't speak to him that it would be possible in in my circumstance to completely sever communication 

416.45 417.47 B: uh-huh 

417.39 421.45 A: because because like i said the circle of friends are the same 

420.85 422.11 B: yeah 

421.53 424.24 A: um we we work in the same 

424.37 438.64 A: work for the same company so we would we we don't necessarily always interact at work 'cause we work different shifts but but we both work at the same place so you're going to bump into each other 

431.38 432.68 B: right 

435.21 436.13 B: uh-huh 

437.98 439.53 B: oh yeah 

438.94 444.22 A: so for me i i don't think it would be possible to completely sever 

444.53 449.54 A: all communication it just it's just ah unrealistic ah 

445.77 447.04 B: that's true 

448.85 462.22 B: right right well my my my friend lives in his own house and he works a different job than i do and i i see him every so often i mean our our kids are pretty much the same age 

450.02 450.67 A: (( [noise] )) 

462.18 466.34 B: and ah a- a- as i said i haven't seen him in a while so 

467.29 472.50 B: [mn] you know that would what that means that wouldn't for me right now would be 

472.69 480.22 B: too bad because there would be a lot of times you know there's several times where we don't talk to each other for a while then we talk to each other quite a while 

479.67 481.03 A: (( mm [noise] right [noise] )) 

480.40 488.29 B: and i mean it's like it goes in spurts we talk a lot then we don't talk hardly at all and then we talk a lot and it it's it's really weird so 

485.02 486.92 A: [laughter] right 

488.09 502.86 B: i i guess in my case yeah i probably would jump at it you know i mean the opportunities that i would have to spend time with my family and and to do the things that i needed to do and wanted to do and and the quality of my life 

503.23 506.49 B: that's tough i mean i i think i would take it i 

503.65 505.58 A: (( right [noise] yeah )) 

507.10 511.34 A: yeah i [sigh] ah man [noise] i i don't know 

510.26 513.74 B: mean your situation that's your situation is a little tougher 

513.45 515.09 A: yeah i don't i don't 

514.09 517.65 B: mine mine i i think i would 

516.96 530.27 A: yeah i think i think that i think that most and and you know like i say if it was it was on the table in front of me [noise] boy it'd be hard to walk away from it but [noise] but 

517.95 519.92 B: yours i don't know 

524.42 525.43 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

527.86 529.06 B: i know 

529.39 530.46 B: (( i know )) 

530.36 540.07 A: ah i don't know i don't know 'cause there's this little thing in the back of my head that that keeps chipping at me about about twenty years when you look at your life 

539.58 540.51 B: uh-huh 

540.21 546.27 A: the the things that'll be important to you will be your your friends and family not the money that you earned 

545.40 551.40 B: that's true you you wish you had more time with your friends not more money 

546.76 547.80 A: so 

551.12 566.06 A: right but but by the same token if you took the million dollars like you were saying you will be a- you will be able to spend more time with your family because you wouldn't you wouldn't be having to work a forty hour week and you know you could 

559.92 561.80 B: mhm mhm 

563.94 570.88 B: right your wife w- wouldn't have to work i mean you could have i mean realistically 

567.37 568.93 A: right 

569.71 574.45 A: the vacations you could take well [laughter] alone [noise] 

572.56 575.07 B: fifty thousand a year for twenty years 

574.74 576.12 A: (( oh [noise] )) 

575.02 587.48 B: i mean in the area i am on in the area i'm in that's that's all you really need you know you don't need a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand dollars a year to to survive in where i live it's it's a 

580.66 581.72 A: yeah 

587.39 593.08 B: smaller you know it's a smaller rural area you know we're we're suburban 

587.51 588.54 A: [noise] 

591.87 593.70 A: oh yeah 

593.22 599.01 B: you know of thirty thousand people but you know that for fifty thousand a year for twenty years 

599.33 599.89 B: that would 

599.33 599.89 A: oh sh-
