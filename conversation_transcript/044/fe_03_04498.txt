3.50 5.01 A: hey daniel my name's steve 

4.78 6.01 B: hello steve 

6.05 13.33 B: i just this is a very interesting topic since i'm twenty one i just got out of high school not more than five years ago 

7.38 9.10 A: [noise] 

13.63 16.73 A: cool i graduated in eighty nine 

16.50 18.32 B: oh so you're fairly young 

18.35 19.53 A: i try to be 

19.27 21.06 B: [laughter] 

21.50 24.49 B: well i don't know do you want to go first on this topic 

23.89 29.98 A: um sure hold on a second i want to switch to a hands free because i'm making dinner 

29.70 30.84 B: all righty 

30.55 31.96 A: um 

33.32 36.62 A: but ah i have three children 

36.47 37.51 B: you do 

36.71 43.25 A: and that gives me a lot of thought ah i just have a lot of thought about this because can you hear me okay 

42.00 44.86 B: yes i can do they go to public school 

44.40 46.62 A: ah one of them just started yesterday 

46.79 51.20 A: but [sigh] you know i seriously think that there is a lot of problems in our schools 

51.48 62.63 A: but [sigh] the thing that we're we're up a- we had happen is we have a daughter who's um got a speech problem she doesn't talk and she's four years old and we went to our local school ah where we're at 

57.28 58.19 B: yes 

63.12 74.66 A: and yeah they have a program here that they don't have in just about anywhere else and ah it's for her a special speech program and she goes three hours a day five days a week to school now 

74.83 81.44 A: and i was really impressed that they actually could do this ah considering the state of the schools in in our state so 

81.36 82.83 B: which state are you in 

82.37 83.86 A: (( california how )) 

83.17 86.54 B: california i'm in ah washington d._c. 

84.02 84.83 A: about you 

85.94 93.55 A: oh cool [noise] but anyway i mean i think there's some problems and apparently there's some good things going on too obviously since 

93.69 98.62 A: my daughter is able to get some good attention and it seems like she's got good conscientious people 

98.91 103.86 A: and that's one thing i i believe is in a lot of good conscientious teachers out there 

103.48 110.41 B: now see i always i think that there is a similar problem however on a different um different topic um 

110.75 122.77 B: the people i work with um are mostly united states citizens but many of them come from foreign countries ah and were educated in europe and ah japanese and ah high school 

122.72 134.31 B: it is very common to find kids who are eighteen years old coming out of high school in european countries who have already taken calculus one calculus two 

134.20 135.00 A: (( yeah )) 

134.35 146.04 B: and by the time that they start university education they have already completed most of what we would call freshman and sophomore level classes so 

144.26 145.37 A: yep 

146.18 147.31 B: um 

147.43 154.09 B: when you go to a university if you um you know i went to the university of missouri at and then later cornell university 

153.44 154.18 A: cool 

154.11 167.98 B: and it's very very disheartening in a way to be very very good at your high school but yet you see how much better and more qualified your foreign counterparts are mhm 

166.28 169.43 A: yeah it's interesting the problem that we have here 

169.50 175.35 A: i graduated from high school like i said in eighty nine i couldn't read i was illiterate still 

174.92 176.49 B: very interesting 

175.89 177.51 A: and i ah 

177.82 187.30 A: went and i didn't you know i i tried to go to school college i went to a californian university nearby where i had lived and i failed out because i couldn't read 

187.37 193.58 A: and we had ah the school was calpoly pomono which is a very high technical school an engineering school 

192.55 197.34 B: yes i know i am very familiar with calpoly is that near st louisa bisbo right 

196.86 203.22 A: st louisa bisbo is up n- is the northern school the southern school is calpoly pomono they're sister schools 

202.82 203.79 B: okay 

203.40 207.25 A: um but anyway i totally failed out of it because i couldn't read still 

207.31 212.05 A: and you know it was kind of well it was a really hard hit to me because 

212.54 214.41 A: n- i wasn't able to ah 

214.57 223.61 A: compete i wasn't able to do anything i c- i just people just surpassed me in knowledge and and able to get you know get the grades and stuff like that and it was just really 

223.62 225.67 A: and it wasn't until 

226.44 230.40 A: i dropped out of that well i failed out of that and then i ah 

230.46 233.24 A: just worked in a grocery store for a couple of years 

233.34 234.75 A: and then i ah 

234.76 236.79 A: actually did a mission for my church 

236.92 248.76 A: um from ages twenty three to twenty five and when i came home i was able to read and went to de vries university and got a bachelors degree in computer information systems and flying high now 

246.97 248.21 B: oh very good 

248.95 259.88 A: but ah it was you know coming out of the school that was a big eye opener the big problem in our californian schools is that we have a large influx of people from mexico and from south america 

258.38 261.67 B: oh so you have to worry about the bilingual problem 

261.03 265.36 A: yes and for a long time when i was in school it was bilingual education 

265.56 270.21 A: and it became a serious problem because what had happened is that they would take the testing 

270.29 283.90 A: and the the qualifications to move on and they kept lowering them because none of the students from mexico were able to figure it out you know because well there was a language problem they needed to teach them english first yeah they needed 

280.27 282.15 B: oh of course i mean it's obvious 

282.61 288.17 B: if you can't it's very difficult to pass the s._a._t. verbal section if you don't speak english 

287.58 292.04 A: that's right instead of instead of and what they were doing was they were trying to teach them in spanish 

292.46 299.84 A: and then try to mix them in with english and it was just a big mess because the different ah kids were at such a different a a huge range 

299.36 300.59 B: yes they 

299.63 308.63 A: instead of teaching them english and then letting them putting them where they belonged and then trying to get them up to speed they kept on they kept them down and it 

307.36 312.19 B: yes it's been i think it was unintentional because it's i think it's a reaction 

312.03 315.93 B: ah in the nineteen twenties when we had so many german immigrants 

315.71 330.39 B: we threw them into the water so to speak and forced them to learn english so quickly and ah there was a lot of i think um good intentions to avoid that we wanted to kind of ease their transition to america make it more comfortable 

330.17 340.80 B: but um if you don't force a person to learn english very early ah they will always continue to use the language that's most comfortable to them and that is spanish 

339.30 340.42 A: that's right 

340.57 343.80 A: you know ah my church we send missionaries throughout the world 

343.54 345.19 B: is that latter day saints 

344.53 346.26 A: yeah yes 

346.45 347.78 A: and we ah 

348.12 350.32 A: the only reason i bring that up is because 

350.37 354.47 A: we send these k- these guys out nineteen years old never 

354.27 365.52 A: have never spoken a foreign language i just have a friend who just went to who just was sent to bulgaria and he doesn't know anything about the language he's going to spend nine weeks in utah learning bulgarian 

365.66 371.06 A: and then they're just throwing him out there go and they say it usually takes about a month and a half and they're speaking it 

371.35 372.57 A: and you know 

372.71 375.09 A: if a bunch of nineteen year olds can do it 

375.44 378.09 A: they say children can adapt even faster 

377.49 378.88 B: oh yes yes 

378.72 382.63 A: so anyway there that's my my stance [laughter] 

381.98 389.38 B: but well that's certainly and the other there's another problem is the violence now i went to a rural public school in 

388.57 390.03 A: where'd you go to school at 

389.42 393.22 B: ah i went to senior high school in arnold missouri 

390.14 391.83 A: (( you don't have to tell me exactly )) 

392.98 393.94 A: okay 

393.51 405.48 B: so a very all white school and ah we never had to worry about guns i don't think there was ever a gun found in the school but in inner city schools it's very interesting after the columbine shooting 

405.41 414.27 B: there was a lot of cynicism going that ah black students have been shooting each other in the inner city schools for years what made columbine 

414.29 422.64 B: um so remarkable is now all of a sudden the white students are shooting each other and that's when everybody starts getting upset 

421.74 432.16 A: yeah yeah i i you know what i can agree to that to a point because there were kids stabbing each other all the time i guess the difference with columbine was is that it was actually students going in 

432.12 437.67 A: and not just shooting you know not just one person or it's not one person and another person two 

437.69 448.40 A: i don't mean to call 'em punks but two punks or something like that because we had we had white kids stabbing white kids at my school and nobody even thought twice of it because it was like well there's one dirtbag stabbing another dirtbag who cares 

438.57 440.29 B: not two rival gangs 

448.61 458.39 A: this is kids going in and just arbitrarily shooting people and i think that that just was totally different than than a gang shootout or a gang style 

458.42 464.22 A: um gang style problems i mean my school had gangs and this is you know ten years ago now 

462.64 465.20 B: oh really so you went to a rough school hm 

465.53 469.62 A: ah i i went to a mixed school half of it was 

469.74 477.37 A: well off and half lived in the the inner city kind of area and it wasn't as bad as some of the schools in l._a. let's say but i mean 

477.81 484.07 A: i don't know it wasn't really bad but we did have things like stabbings and stuff like that and we had gang problems and 

484.47 490.70 B: well you know the secret service i think this is one problem that came out of the columbine the secret service 

490.60 503.44 B: ah that does ah profiling of people who are going to assassinate the president and they create these psychological profiles they discovered the single most important problem in our schools today is bullying 

503.45 514.39 B: um the name calling and the vicious name calling the threats of violence that the young people face and i certainly know what they're talking about that um 

514.78 523.10 B: when you are put into a situation and you are called ah horrible horrible names for being different um 

523.50 532.94 B: it can be very difficult like you you can persons people can break and they can start doing things that they wouldn't do normally otherwise 

532.32 535.01 A: yeah well they could 

533.24 534.12 B: and 

534.38 540.43 B: that was the rec- so the secret service recommended that the thing that we could do most to stop the school violence 

540.57 544.91 B: um would be to stop the bullying at an early age 

545.61 552.32 A: hm well what about violence in video games what about violence on television violence at the movies 

552.46 554.56 A: (( ah you know ah )) 

554.99 558.30 A: that's something i think that also has an effect on these young people 

558.63 571.18 A: because they see it and they emulate it i mean i watch my some of my friends' kids they'll watch something like the power rangers and what are they doing they're emulating it in the front yard on a whole lot less dangerous scale 

571.35 583.90 A: but i've noticed that it numbs the senses when you watch it and see it on a continuous basis and you're surrounded by violence even though it's not real violence it still numbs your senses to it i- it takes the reality out of it 

583.86 592.57 B: what do you think about um the concept that teachers public school teachers are not receiving enough education they are not ah 

592.70 599.95 B: they are not you know there's been a lot of con- ah controversy in inner city schools that teachers cannot even pass simple
