0.56 2.04 A: hello 

1.43 2.72 B: (( hello )) 

2.88 6.84 A: uh i'm dennis in kansas city missouri 

6.35 9.15 B: hi i'm ann marie i'm in utah 

9.26 10.55 A: utah 

10.20 12.75 B: yeah 

10.62 12.39 A: oh okay 

12.43 20.82 A: well today's subject is uh public schools do you feel there's uh i think they said were there anything particularly wrong with them or 

18.09 18.68 B: (( [noise] )) 

20.42 22.09 B: uh seriously wrong 

21.69 24.96 A: seriously wrong with them well uh 

24.97 32.12 A: i think well t- that's uh that's a subject that you could you know cover uh a lot of variables i mean 

31.68 32.73 B: mhm 

32.09 39.64 A: i don't think there's one particular i think there's a number of things that are probably 

39.60 51.55 A: you know affecting public schools but then it also probably depends on what state you're in what city you're in and even the local school board i i mean there's there's you know hundreds of thousands of school schools public schools so 

47.56 48.62 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

51.27 52.45 B: that's true 

52.48 55.70 A: (( i don't know what do you think about that )) 

54.54 69.15 B: well in general i mean i think you're right they do vary so much from school to school that it's hard to pinpoint but i think general we do have a problem with um well first to start out with not paying teachers enough so we don't get 

69.19 75.25 B: as [noise] highly qualified teachers as we might like and having class sizes that are too large 

75.38 77.58 B: so that the teachers can't 

77.70 80.64 B: give the children enough individualized attention 

80.87 84.13 B: and i personally object to um 

84.61 92.70 B: just kind of the institutionalized nature of the schools where you have from a very young age children put in very 

92.68 102.34 B: large groups of their peers and and they're managed rather than taught because it's so hard to deal with so much so many children at all at once if you know what i mean 

102.09 103.66 A: yeah 

104.26 109.89 A: yeah that's pretty much uh i i think been t- the problem over the past few years uh 

110.06 123.35 A: uh when i was a kid i you know didn't hear about these things being discussed be- i can't re- remember if teachers you know were paid equitably or not but you know nowadays you're you're right it's having a bunch of students 

117.41 118.31 B: (( [noise] )) 

123.24 128.40 A: today's teenagers are a different breed than they were back in the fifties and sixties 

128.41 130.09 B: (( i know that's what i hear )) 

129.86 131.58 A: yeah uh 

130.11 130.94 B: [laughter] 

131.75 147.66 A: i i think one of the problems uh that's facing schools probably everywhere is it seems to me there seems to be a a lack of discipline or the i mean i i like the independence of today's teenagers today's teenagers they seem to be more willing to 

148.00 150.31 A: to uh uh you know um 

150.45 160.64 A: [lipsmack] protest for something that they're un- they they don't like you know they're not they're w- they're not willing to accept things quite like i was when i was a kid i went to school in the fifties and sixties 

154.01 155.81 B: (( mhm )) 

160.73 168.82 A: uh today's teenagers seem to be more willing to stand up for things they believe in but then i think al- i think sometimes there's uh 

165.31 168.52 B: (( mhm )) 

169.26 176.92 A: things can get a little too far you know i think uh sometimes the teenagers feel like they have a little more authority than they should have 

175.76 178.19 B: (( [noise] right i know )) 

177.27 178.44 A: (( you know )) 

178.45 184.62 B: and along those lines it's kind of a blurry line of do you blame the schools or the or the parents 

178.50 179.57 A: i mean 

185.06 185.93 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

185.31 192.87 A: well i think it's a combination of just it's just society in general has changed and and today's parents were raised in a more 

192.95 196.61 A: a liberal atmosphere of the sixties today's today's parents w- 

196.60 208.04 A: with teenagers were probably hippies in the sixties and seventies and and they they maybe have more of an an open attitude and a free spirits about things a more rebellious attitude against authority 

200.49 202.29 B: right 

208.04 222.92 A: and that's carried over to the teenagers but you know the thing is where do you draw the line i mean you know when you have teenagers who are openly uh hostile to teachers i mean when i was a kid you didn't even chew gum in school 

216.76 217.53 B: [noise] 

222.12 223.38 B: (( right [mn] )) 

223.38 232.47 A: and now the kids are using the foul language and they're they're they're attacking their teachers i mean you know that's i think things are going from one extreme to the other 

229.58 230.71 B: mhm 

232.41 233.72 B: right 

233.37 237.52 A: you know may- maybe this country is going through growing pains still because 

237.64 241.74 A: when i went to school in the fifties and sixties things were very very restrictive 

241.93 247.55 A: there was no talk about things that they talk about freely now like sex and that that was 

247.49 256.96 A: you know taboo very conservative times you know we had the country was ozzie and harriet and now we've gone from ozzie and harriet to to uh ozzie ozzie 

252.88 254.05 B: (( [mn] right )) 

257.38 260.13 B: [laughter] 

257.51 258.42 A: see 

258.44 270.13 A: so we've got th- there's a wide difference there there's an extreme there one way or the other i think the country's just still going through growing pains and i think it takes maybe fifty years for a country to to settle down 

270.45 272.54 A: that's just my theory i don't know 

272.20 273.77 B: right [sigh] 

273.81 274.90 B: (( so as )) 

275.17 282.71 B: but as far as the schools go do you the schools need to be be uh putting more discipline into their 

282.42 288.17 A: yeah i think there should be more discipline yeah i think teachers should be uh respected uh you know i think 

282.95 284.16 B: programs 

288.18 301.54 A: kids should be taught that the teacher is the authority and and the teacher uh when the teacher says something the kids shouldn't question it unless it's something that's outrageous you know i mean just i mean just more discipline 

298.62 300.00 B: mhm 

301.33 309.97 A: i think teenagers want discipline and i think kids want discipline but if they don't get it then they kinda go off the deep end you know 

310.00 316.15 A: i think i think that's one of the main problems with these schools just there's a lack of uh uh a structure 

310.46 311.02 B: (( [mn] )) 

316.38 318.57 A: you know that the kids can follow 

318.39 319.35 B: mhm 

319.23 323.33 A: but that's just one of the problems there's so many problems you know you could talk hours 

323.06 323.81 B: oh 

323.68 332.23 A: i think they should raise the standards a little bit i think they're lowering the educational standards so they can graduate more students i think that hurts everybody in the long run 

330.18 336.41 B: mhm yeah i agree and they lower standards so that they can 

336.35 336.91 A: (( [mn] )) 

336.64 340.62 B: see more results with the kids getting all the way through school but 

338.10 345.79 A: yeah yeah mhm it's sorta like a corporation cooking the books a little bit that's what they're doing with our educational system so 

344.90 346.66 B: mhm [noise] 

345.97 354.64 A: no i i think they should raise the standards and if the students can't meet the standards then they should have extra classes extra summer school and extra teachers brought in 

354.70 361.12 A: you know to to give those students extra instruction to bring everybody up i think you know raise everybody up 

355.43 356.45 B: mhm 

361.06 369.90 A: you know don't don't don't let everybody don't don't lower the standards for everybody but keep the standards high and the ones who can't meet the standards bring them up to meet the others 

369.89 374.71 B: yeah especially on the the basics of what they need to know 

374.56 377.88 A: yeah yeah i agree yeah 

377.08 378.03 B: i was 

378.23 390.49 B: sh- shocked to hear just a little while that they're you know [mn] about people graduating from high school not being able to read and i just wonder how it is they get through all these classes and all these teachers and 

390.63 394.68 B: still manage to slip through the system and graduate not knowing how to read 

394.25 398.10 A: yeah i'm shocked at that too i don't understand it myself i mean 

397.09 402.78 B: yeah see that's that's something i mean it says something's seriously wrong but i don't understand what's happening that that can 

403.14 404.68 B: happen exactly 

403.33 415.35 A: yeah yeah and i think that you know and when the subjects like geography if you mention new mexico to a lot of kids and there's a lot of kids think new mexico is a country or something it's it's craziness nowadays i 

412.22 413.74 B: [laughter] 

415.61 426.79 A: i don't know i just i don't know where things started to break down myself because i went to high school in the sixties and things were of course i went i switched i went from a big city high school to a small town high school 

426.70 434.62 A: up up in north dakota and and uh the big city high school had a lack of discipline they had poor teachers and things were just sort of 

426.75 427.80 B: really 

434.51 442.75 A: that was the beginning of the downfall of the school system i think we were just starting to go through desegregation and there were all sorts of racial problems 

442.72 453.98 A: and then i switched to a small town of only two thousand people in north dakota and it was a totally dif- different atmosphere there was it was very strict and and disciplined and and i got a much better education 

450.93 451.51 B: (( [mn] )) 

453.89 458.83 A: i thought it was a much better school than the big city school that i was uh going to so 

458.80 460.16 B: that's interesting 

458.94 469.37 A: but uh but what the problems i don't know if the big city problems just trickled down to small towns on on the prairie or not i don't i'm not familiar i'm i'm only familiar with big city schools since i'm 

469.82 473.60 A: living in a big city now and the school district here has undergone 

473.74 479.32 A: uh one traumatic uh experience after the other over the twenty last twenty or thirty years so um 

479.24 481.60 B: yeah 

479.66 481.24 A: but uh 

481.54 492.08 A: i mean i think a kid going to school in in a small town in utah is probably going to get a better education than the kid whose going to the big city school in maybe philadelphia you know 

489.46 490.27 B: [noise] 

491.72 492.48 B: (( [mn] )) 

492.54 495.72 B: yeah you're probably right but utah has its 

494.09 495.94 A: yeah 

495.79 497.59 B: own problem [laughter] 

496.88 506.59 A: yeah well i think there's problems all over it's just that they come in different degrees you know and and that 

503.71 508.29 B: mhm well one one thing that utah has going for it and i 

508.39 511.78 B: to speak generally is very involved parents so 

511.68 514.29 A: (( yeah but )) 

512.24 513.34 B: (( than )) 

513.48 517.86 B: which helps in their schools but they still have problems with their public schools 

518.84 533.19 A: you're right about the parents nowadays there are too many parents who aren't really parents they're more like custodians they see their kid maybe a little bit in the morning and they see their kid a little in in the afternoon or evening and that's about all there's there's no involvement otherwise the families 

533.13 541.69 A: are the kids go one way and the parents are too busy with something else and the parents aren't concerned about wh- what's going in their kids' school so 

539.06 541.90 B: (( mhm )) 

541.71 544.29 A: yeah i think i think very strong 

544.42 557.48 A: parents parents who believe in discipline who believe in you know letting the kids have their own free free rein too because teenagers don't wanna be tied down teenagers wanna assert themselves 

557.51 559.23 A: but you know parents who 

559.34 573.81 A: are strict to the point of not you know making lives miserable for teenagers but still like you said the parental control should be there the parents should be there for their kids at all times if possible 

565.21 567.10 B: mhm 

573.26 574.46 B: yeah 

573.85 584.71 A: and i think the kids when they get into trouble they go to their friends for advice they feel more confident talking to their friends than they do their parents and unfortunately their friends give 'em the wrong advice 

581.59 583.43 B: oh for sure 

585.76 586.86 A: (( you know )) 

585.90 598.88 B: yeah i agree there's i've certainly seen that even in when i was in high school and with my younger sister definitely started to see her friends were the bigger influence 

598.59 599.89 A: yeah the parents
