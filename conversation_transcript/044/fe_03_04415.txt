239.18 246.41 B: and w- well uh but going back i don't know if they how much they monitor this but we gotta stay on the subject a little bit i think this is like 

244.26 247.76 A: oh well we answered the question i would would you 

247.89 250.35 A: you didn't answer it i i said i would 

248.56 260.86 B: well that's right i didn't i didn't answer it y- you know d- it i was i thought about it no no sooner than i heard it and i started thinking about it would i would i talk to my best friend or wouldn't i if i was offered a million dollars 

260.82 270.40 B: well and see i i look at it i gotta look at it on both on both fronts if i do i- if they if they have a way of stopping me from getting the million 

270.20 279.06 B: or i- if that's my question you know the question they gonna give you will you talk to your best friend and i say yeah i'm going to talk to him i don't get the money then okay i ain't gonna talk to 

279.64 281.16 A: [laughter] okay 

279.73 291.09 B: him just like that i mean i- if they tell me you know if they let me know uh that i can you know i've got a a the certain amount of time before i can't talk to him i'm gonna let him know look i'm getting ready to get this money 

291.00 298.45 B: i can't talk to you no more i'll just see you when i see you [laughter] maybe we'll learn sign language or something [laughter] i don't know 

297.92 299.23 A: [laughter] 

298.40 307.61 B: but uh you know i'm gonna i i i can't do it but if i'm not given that opportunity if this uh if this unseen unknown benefactor it 

307.48 322.20 B: sounds like that show the millionaire we used to watch back in the sixties uh uh where john beresford tipton would have this guy come to your house and give you a check for a million dollars and he had a stipulation uh uh believe it now see they got that from a t._v. show um 

322.45 330.54 B: but if i couldn't say nothing to nobody i mean my best friend i don't think it would be that much of a strain because 

330.61 331.73 B: uh 

331.94 340.15 B: i don't you know i [mn] th- the way my life is i don't really have a best friend you know a guy that i hang out with 

340.11 348.55 B: you know like that the i got plenty of girlfriends [laughter] you know but no guy so uh [mn] you know for me 

344.76 345.80 A: [laughter] 

347.84 353.95 A: yeah i have guy friends but not like one that's like a couple of my really good friends don't live here anyway 

353.62 361.65 B: yeah okay [laughter] yeah but somebody y- you know i i you know 'cause you have to you have to look here what's the definition of a best friend 

354.21 355.52 A: (( [laughter] you know )) 

361.50 367.76 B: you know a a a guy that you you know uh share everything with tell everything to 

367.60 368.96 B: you know uh 

368.80 374.67 B: uh you know no secrets you know between the both of you [noise] uh you have similar likes interests 

374.48 385.73 B: you know interests and stuff like that you know uh i ain't got no i ain't got no friend like that i don't even tell my fiancee n- everything [laughter] well i can't you know you don't tell a woman everything anyway 

382.72 384.18 A: (( [laughter] uh-huh )) 

385.74 386.76 B: [noise] but um 

387.00 393.96 B: you know as far as a guy goes uh i used to have one of them but he died about ten years ago 

394.00 403.75 B: so when that happened like i just have really like associates now you know uh like the people in my church like say for instance i'm a deacon in my church 

403.78 416.87 B: uh [lipsmack] the guys on the deacon board we're all supposed to be brothers and best friends you know sort of like that you know like we should all be able to share everything but uh i don't feel that because i don't see these guys but once a week 

416.96 430.18 B: y- you know when church is in that's the day that i see them i don't hear from them during the week you know or nothing like that i tried you know i'm of them guys that go i will call you know and you know just sort of say hey how you doing or something but um 

430.51 432.86 B: you know they don't reciprocate 

433.06 440.29 B: so i figure well what kind of friends are they supposed to be or at least matter of fact the way churches say it these days uh that we're your church 

433.13 434.03 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

440.06 452.95 B: family so if your family don't even call you once a week what kind of family is that you know or what kind of friend would he be if he didn't call you once a week you know i guess i don't really have one but i'd take the i'd take the money 

448.91 450.65 A: yeah i'd trade one of those in 

452.63 457.22 A: [laughter] that's what i'm saying i'd take the money too 

453.20 458.39 B: [laughter] you can believe it you know i'd take the money they don't got away with 

457.27 459.63 A: i could use a nice million right now 

459.07 464.00 B: i'm telling you except for this ten bucks that they giving us for this [laughter] 

462.72 468.98 A: and you know what they didn't clarify is that after taxes or not 'cause if it's after taxes then it's like five hundred thousand 

466.33 468.36 B: you know that that's you know i 

468.73 479.49 B: yeah right yeah by the time uncle sam gets through with it you know it's you you gotta be y- matter of fact the way that i remember it they used to say you know if you got a million dollars they get sixty percent of it 

471.29 472.35 A: [laughter] 

479.48 485.42 B: (( so we'd end up with four with four hundred thousand dollars which i'll still take 'cause that's a whole lot more money than i got now )) 

485.91 487.07 A: oh yeah 

486.00 492.39 B: (( i t- i tell you oh as a matter of fact i'd just [laughter] that's right )) 

488.02 492.09 A: otherwise i wouldn't be talking to you [laughter] 

492.24 503.00 B: hey you know we we on a we on the phone for ten bucks that show how far how how much money we got hanging around [laughter] you know matter of fact this is like the fifth time they've called me 

498.56 499.92 A: (( [laughter] )) 

502.75 506.68 A: dude they call me off the hook i d- i don't answer it much a lot of the time 

505.55 515.04 B: yeah they they well i gave them what days they could call me and what times and what now but when they've called me the last four times they 

513.74 523.38 A: i have to you know what i have to do though i did check a lot of boxes so i should go back to the website and like click off you know a lot of it because i i was like clicked all the times i was home

562.79 572.80 B: you don't hear nothing [noise] so like the first time i did it i thought that well maybe i'm just supposed to just ramble [laughter] you know that just 

571.16 576.45 A: i think that's what they want because it's a linguistical study so they want to study how we speak 

574.41 575.54 B: (( ah )) 

576.18 578.03 B: uh okay 

577.12 578.58 A: (( so i ))

588.05 589.98 A: think it's a regional thing so 

589.53 590.92 B: (( uh )) 

590.98 599.95 B: yeah 'cause see i i've lived all over the country and halfway around the world in in the fifty one years i've been alive and uh i can speak any kind of way i
