1.04 2.23 A: hello 

1.82 3.89 B: hello [laughter] 

3.24 5.73 A: [laughter] what is this 

5.84 10.39 B: this is um ah have you not done this before 

9.95 10.90 A: (( no )) 

10.69 20.48 B: this is a research study something ah apparently the university of pennsylvania and we're supposed to talk to each other about the question that they just um 

21.13 25.99 B: um gave us um that has someone in your family signed up to do this 

25.57 27.27 A: no i don't think so 

27.11 28.77 B: (( okay )) 

28.86 29.43 A: (( mm )) 

28.92 32.51 B: ah did they give you the options to not do it as far as 

32.05 37.41 A: ah no they just kind of asked me some questions and then ah now i'm talking to you 

37.06 38.45 B: oh okay 

38.55 46.25 B: ah well maybe somebody signed you up or maybe your parents brother or sister somebody like that but 

46.13 54.94 B: anyway what they do is they're they're doing a study and they're um just getting information from different people and seeing how they you know answer questions that's all 

54.85 63.27 B: and what they're wanting us to do is to say what would happen if somebody said that they would give us a million dollars only if we couldn't talk to our best friend what would we do [laughter] 

63.01 64.11 A: okay 

63.91 70.11 B: um i myself would love to have a million dollars but i wouldn't be able to take that 

70.40 76.44 B: on that stipulation because i would not give up my best you know talking to my best friend and taking money you know 

75.73 81.19 A: yeah yeah well ah you know have you had the same best friend for your whole life 

76.81 77.59 B: (( ah mm )) 

81.70 89.32 B: i well not for my whole life i have a lot of you know best friends i've had some friends that i had for ten years fifteen years twenty five years 

89.19 89.98 A: (( mm )) 

89.70 99.86 B: but to me no amount of money's going to come between me and my friends so i would just have to just pass up on that money and just keep my friends [laughter] mm so 

93.82 94.76 A: yeah 

99.18 101.59 A: oh that seems really that seems really ah 

101.70 104.84 A: virtuous of you you know like really right on 

104.88 111.09 A: but i don't know i i guess it's really confusing because for me the question would be you know 

108.63 109.33 B: (( right )) 

111.56 120.13 A: um how do you tell who's your best friend 'cause i know that i you know in college for example the person that would be my best friend for a little while 

120.31 128.97 A: you know a year later i wouldn't even know them so it it would be a little bit confusing i mean i guess if if they meant my oldest friend for example 

122.35 123.90 B: (( mhm right mhm )) 

129.01 132.75 A: the friend that that i sort of grew up with the most closely 

132.79 138.70 A: i don't think that i've ah seen him in years now so but you know i guess it would still be kind of a 

138.75 141.00 A: kind of a drag to know that you 

141.22 146.00 A: couldn't talk to anyone for your whole life and that just money had maybe made that decision 

146.86 149.28 A: so i guess i would agree with you there 

148.35 158.34 B: [laughter] yes it's not to agree or disagree it's just you know how would you feel about it to me it would be awful hard it would be a hard decision to make so i that's just something i would stand by but i mean 

158.35 168.83 B: 'cause i do have some friends that i you know i mean i see them every year but i stay in contact with them and they are friends they're my best friends so and of course i think i'm a little bit older than you are too so doesn't 

168.16 169.75 A: (( oh really how old are you )) 

169.39 179.11 B: i'm forty seven so you're still young growing i think that um you're probably in your early twenties or late teens not late teens ah i don't think 

170.78 171.64 A: okay 

178.34 180.70 A: yeah how how d- how do you tell that 

180.09 184.20 B: just just just on what you just said [laughter] 

183.51 184.82 A: oh really 

184.19 198.44 B: but i 'cause i have a son that age too he's he's just now turning twenty one but he would say the same thing but i think that as you get older you probably realise that yes you do have you know best friends and you know you'd be able to tell the differences of what you're going to do and what you want to do and 

186.32 187.51 A: (( oh )) 

198.12 199.95 A: (( yes cool )) 

198.89 208.63 B: but yeah a million dollars that would be fantastic i can think of a lot of things i would do with a million dollars and and could do with it but to not talk to my best friend again 

203.92 205.31 A: oh yeah 

208.68 210.56 B: (( just for a million [laughter] dollars )) 

209.95 215.44 A: no it's a little bit round plus i mean you would know every time you spent any of that money 

214.77 215.64 B: (( [laughter] )) 

215.46 220.16 A: that you were like you know they you'd still kind of yourself out you know 

219.78 221.01 B: yes [laughter] mhm 

220.21 228.47 A: even even regardless of of the place that that friend has in your life it's just like personally that would that'd make me feel like i was giving up some of my own dignity do 

228.02 232.04 B: yes [laughter] yes that's true that's really true 

228.49 229.80 A: (( you know what i mean )) 

233.04 234.81 A: okay so ah 

235.00 237.94 A: do do we have to talk for the full ten minutes about this 

237.37 247.75 B: yeah it um it probably isn't that much longer i'm sure i haven't even been timing it but i know the robot will come on and he'll let us know it's going to be just a few seconds and we can say goodbye then [laughter] so 

244.29 245.13 A: [laughter] 

246.76 253.49 A: oh c- wow this is this this is such a weird thing i can't believe it do they record these conversations 

247.86 248.66 B: (( and but )) 

252.86 259.74 B: they're going to record it and then the best thing is that you also get paid like a dollar a minute for it too so yes you do so 

257.64 258.75 A: really 

259.70 262.45 A: are you i can't believe that i didn't know that at all 

262.12 272.22 B: so i guess it's somehow or other or somehow you got signed up to do this and either you did it or somebody in your family did it and they're supposed to be doing it and you happened to get the phone call or 

272.30 275.83 B: something something happened forget it it's really 

273.03 274.19 A: wow 

275.06 279.27 A: so then the robot will talk to me later and ask me if like what's my address 

279.17 284.70 B: ah it's well somebody somehow did it already they already have you in the system i mean 

284.63 287.07 A: oh my gosh that's crazy 

286.46 294.47 B: i mean i don't know um exactly how or what i mean a- the only way they can get your number is if 

294.73 296.59 B: somebody did it for you 

296.13 298.62 A: wow how do you know about this 

298.04 307.69 B: um i found it on a website that i frequent um somebody apparently has already been doing this um for a while 

307.58 318.70 B: and she happened to give out the website address and said that they wanted researchers i mean wanted these people to answer questions and they they do this and i thought well why not just try it [laughter] 

316.50 320.41 A: [noise] wow that's great 

319.81 327.94 B: and i missed the first call a couple of days ago and then i just happened to be doing something now the call came through again i'm like okay why not let's try it [laughter] 

327.18 330.21 A: [laughter] oh so this is your first time doing it 

329.57 331.56 B: this is my first time doing it too yeah
