174.13 175.15 A: yeah 

174.46 182.96 B: and and he said it was the most horrible thing that ever happened to him though he said he won all this money and then all these people started coming out of the woodwork 

182.92 186.12 A: well you know like you said you find out who your friends are 

185.58 188.43 B: absolutely absolutely 

187.15 199.74 A: um but and that and that's what i've heard is that you know it was funny it was on ah i think it was on oprah um during spring break and ah she had michael jordan on and and a couple of ah 

199.58 207.82 A: athletes who had made it big and they said you know you find out who your friends are because they start asking for money and if you don't give 'em money they just kind of drop off 

207.55 209.10 B: (( ab- absolutely )) 

209.18 214.17 B: yeah we kind of had that situation up here where i don't know if you follow basketball with alan iverson

216.43 217.69 A: yeah 

217.09 230.83 B: he's from hampton and he has all these hangers on you know with him they they call it his posse and um and i think all they're doing is hanging hanging around him i think for i don't know if it's for the camaraderie or for the money 

223.29 224.18 A: uh-huh 

230.90 239.12 B: um but but you know i wouldn't mind being in his posse though if he's going to take care of a few of my bills or whatever [laughter] 

235.05 236.29 A: yeah 

238.37 249.51 A: yeah but i remember seeing bec- because he's from this area we get a lot more of the coverage i guess than maybe other areas of the country but last year when he kicked his wife out of the house and all that stuff about her 

249.31 254.27 A: walking around without any clothes on and then the cops were watching the house and 

251.12 252.11 B: yeah 

253.80 256.21 B: oh you got that down there too huh 

255.99 264.31 A: yeah we heard all about that 'cause he's the he'll come back home and he runs into trouble but ah yeah he's he's got a lot of hangers on 

263.94 273.86 B: yeah yes he does and and he's with there was just another incident up here involving him i don't know if you heard about it where s- one of his entourage was shot 

273.69 274.92 A: no 

274.55 276.48 B: no you didn't hear about that 

276.01 277.91 A: no not at all 

277.30 291.55 B: yeah that was about a month or a month and a half ago in fact he was just taken into the police a couple of days ago and questioned not that he's in any trouble but they the the shooter said that the bullets were actually ah you know geared for him 

291.72 292.50 B: you know 

291.73 293.00 A: oh man 

292.58 297.25 B: yeah not for this other this other guy who i- who in fact is is a um 

297.26 301.19 B: is a corrections supervisor or something in virginia 

301.14 303.41 A: [laughter] oh no [laughter] 

302.24 311.51 B: yeah this guy is the supervisor of a juvenile detention centre down in virginia or something who was up visiting alan and ah 

311.32 321.74 B: i don't know what happened that some altercation ah you know took place and someone pulled the gun and he and he shot the alan's friend he didn't kill him but he he wound you know he wounded him 

321.83 323.95 A: gees [laughter] 

322.64 334.79 B: yeah yeah it's it's you know it's it's something you know i i don't know why these guys get involved themselves they have all this money and why would you involve yourself with people like that i don't understand 

334.20 347.63 A: that that i don't know do they get bored i mean it you know you hear about these entertainers who have the big entourages and do they do they get so much money that they just feel like they got to have people surrounding 'em who who are yes men and yes women 

347.44 357.71 B: that could very well be deborah um i i'm sure i guess so i mean when you have that kind of money i mean what do you do i mean you have everything that you possibly need i guess 

357.49 368.92 B: cars and and and nice house and whatever you know amenities come with the house but i guess they do maybe they're bored and they just want you know just just action i guess i don't know 

368.70 378.06 A: yeah maybe their their old friends you know they they're still working and you got to once you get that kind of money then you wind up having to to pay people to be around you 

377.89 380.02 B: yes y- well you know 

379.21 386.54 A: that's not the kind of new best friend i think i'd want but a million's not that so much money that it used to be 

386.00 387.57 B: oh absolutely 

386.86 388.81 A: it's comfortable but 

388.13 401.54 B: yeah it's comfortable but like like you know we like i said earlier ah i'll definitely take the million and find myself a new best friend and i don't think that would be very hard to do i think new best friends would probably be seeking me out 

401.33 402.43 A: yeah 

401.53 403.21 B: [laughter] 

402.56 416.88 A: well i mean just you know you could you could join the the club or the golf club or tennis club swim club that you wanted to and you know maybe quit your job for a couple of years and and ah meet people who have more leisurely lives 

416.71 417.63 B: well 

416.81 419.71 A: who are maybe in more of the same circumstances 

419.58 431.26 B: i like a i i'm i like horses and i in in fact if i had the million dollars i always said i'd like to go to virginia or kentucky and buy myself a little farm
