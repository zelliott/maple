0.33 1.38 A: hello 

1.30 2.52 B: hi 

2.35 3.85 A: oh hi i'm john 

4.26 5.71 B: uh my name's david 

5.77 6.96 A: (( how are you doing )) 

6.98 8.75 B: i'm doing pretty good how are you 

8.46 10.00 A: good 

9.74 11.04 B: it's nice to meet you 

10.82 11.73 A: you too 

13.89 20.12 B: [sigh] so it's if you could have a million dollars but you couldn't talk to your best friend again would you do it 

21.08 22.77 A: (( [noise] uh )) 

25.43 26.58 A: (( i don't know i )) 

25.74 27.95 B: i'll go first if you wanna think about it 

26.82 28.80 A: (( okay yeah go ahead )) 

28.49 33.24 B: all right for me that's an absolute no way because 

33.29 47.43 B: right now m- well my best friend is is my girlfriend and hopefully one day she'll be my wife so that's definitely not worth it to me because i would uh i wouldn't give up a a great girl like that for a million dollars 

38.60 39.37 A: right 

46.79 48.50 A: right 

48.86 52.47 B: yeah 'cause we've already been together for over a year and 

52.96 55.98 B: it's just i i see it going places uh 

56.09 59.46 B: you know i i don't i don't think that's really worth it 

59.52 61.39 A: right 

61.43 63.02 A: (( right c- right yeah i mean )) 

61.86 63.72 B: the way i see it 

63.15 64.85 A: huh go ahead 

64.47 66.60 B: well the way i see it is um 

66.72 72.37 B: like i could be happy with her for my entire life but a million dollars it d- it doesn't last that much these days 

75.96 78.37 A: right yeah i mean for me it's 

79.93 83.02 A: i mean i only have to say 'cause it's like you know in 

83.09 85.89 A: in in reality you're you know it's 

87.63 89.24 A: i mean you know how 

89.31 100.78 A: how do they really even track those things but i mean if if it came down to you know you absolutely just could not do it then you know yeah i i agree i mean there's nothing that you know 

101.22 103.69 A: that could possibly outweigh you know 

104.29 107.58 A: um having a best friend and or friends 

107.90 110.54 A: um and definitely a million dollars 

110.57 111.29 A: (( you know )) 

113.03 115.15 A: i mean it's just money you know yeah 

113.06 125.65 B: that's good that that's good money but you're right it is just money yeah i mean a lot of people would say that money buys you friends and yeah it does but only until you run out of money 

125.20 129.61 A: right and i don't know if those are the type of friends you'd want anyway [laughter] 

129.18 132.20 B: ex- exactly right 

132.81 139.26 B: right you gonna you gonna want somebody that likes you because of you not because you have a million dollars 

138.87 140.12 A: right 

140.20 143.91 B: man i could think of a lot of things to do with a million dollars though 

143.63 144.79 A: right 

145.77 146.80 B: i uh 

147.94 149.55 B: yeah [laughter] 

148.53 153.15 A: i mean i think the other the the the only reason the question is difficult is because 

153.64 155.52 A: you know for sure 

155.96 163.45 A: what one of the two options is like but you don't know what the other one meaning we all know what a best friend is like so you know we're all going to go with that choice 

163.50 165.89 A: but you know i mean 

166.05 167.94 A: 'cause in my thinking it's like 

168.13 171.79 A: i don't have a million dollars i don't have anywhere near that so you know 

171.84 173.03 A: um 

173.79 175.36 A: you know it's all it's 

176.08 179.54 A: i mean i don't know it just doesn't seem like you know 

180.99 195.38 A: like i'm not entirely sure how fulfilling it could be whereas you know i do have a best friend and so i know what that's like you know it's all it's it's like you're making a choice between something you you already have and something that's only theoretical and i think that's what makes it 

188.13 189.12 B: [noise] 

189.98 191.45 B: (( sort of like it's )) 

195.37 197.07 A: it difficult you know 

197.50 199.19 A: kind of thing to even 

198.49 201.75 B: sort of like the theory that humans by nature don't like change 

201.74 203.99 A: yeah i mean i- 

204.05 208.17 A: if they had said be- between that and something that's more 

208.20 212.36 A: that's also abstract then i think it'd be different you know 

213.41 219.94 A: i mean it's easy for me to say yeah i'd go with my best friend you know it's only because i know that's a sure thing you know 

220.73 222.25 B: right that's true 

221.40 229.32 A: i mean if i had a million dollars previously and i s- and i spent it all and but i knew that it you know what it did for me then 

229.46 232.76 A: then it's an actual you know like practical 

232.78 233.75 A: you know 

233.86 239.01 A: um reality then then if i was faced with a choice then i i'd have something to base it on 

239.17 253.23 A: you know right now i'm just saying you know well yeah um a lot of money sure i can imagine that it would buy me friends i could imagine that i could go places with it buy all this stuff but you know i mean i'm happy with my life now so i mean 

253.60 256.18 A: it that's just all theoretical to me you know 

256.41 264.06 B: right well and i thi- i think also like i was saying it comes to like humans by nature don't don't really like change that much i 

263.49 265.04 A: (( [mn] yeah mhm )) 

264.45 274.22 B: mean change makes us uncomfortable and we might get used to it and end up liking it better later but at the b- at the beginning it's it's still change and 

274.38 278.43 B: and it's just a lot of times that bothers bothers us 

282.88 285.22 B: yeah i don't know i thi- i think that uh 

286.37 287.83 B: it'd it'd be 

288.59 290.78 B: that's tough 'cause that's 

291.04 293.61 B: but i think it boils down to whether 

293.99 303.64 B: like i mean it's not just the million dollars i mean you could change the amount of money and like i don't know there was some joke one time where it was like uh 

303.91 312.58 B: some some rich arab oil sheik asked this girl if he would have if she would have sex with him for like uh a million dollars 

312.60 322.03 B: and then he was like h- how about for twenty and she was like what kind of a person do you think i am and he said well we already established that you'd have sex for money now i'm just trying to negotiate the price 

321.92 322.66 A: (( mhm right [laughter] yeah )) 

322.96 324.03 B: you know 

324.64 325.76 B: so i mean 

325.95 332.66 B: it's like i i think that it's uh it'd be a tough choice but [sigh] 

333.00 337.23 B: in the end i'd definitely have to go with my best friend 

338.87 339.83 B: it's 

342.11 345.00 A: but i you know the other thing i was thinking was 

345.02 346.10 A: um 

347.20 349.38 A: you know it also depends on you know 

352.42 353.45 A: uh 

356.20 357.74 A: i don't know like 

359.95 368.10 A: i i'm not too good at just you know [laughter] accepting like the the things that they've stated you know like to me it you know the very first thing that ran in my head was 

368.07 378.76 A: well if it really was true you know what kind of system would they use to make sure that you didn't you know that a you know your best friend really was your best friend and b that you didn't talk to them you know 

378.95 380.02 A: i mean 

380.10 381.17 A: so 

382.67 383.86 B: that's true 

386.52 392.70 B: yeah and i you could als- you could always go find a new best friend but i mean 

392.80 402.31 B: i have lots of good friends t- that aren't my best friend and i i could get to know them better and they might become my best friend but t- 

394.35 395.34 A: (( yeah uh-huh right )) 

404.54 405.66 B: the main 

405.76 412.12 B: the main reason like i said the the only reason that that is really not significantly not worth it to me is 

412.15 415.95 B: is because hopefully i want to marry my best friend one day and 

416.16 418.94 B: that's that's worth more to me 

418.12 424.42 A: right so i'll start with taking out that equation like if it you know if it excludes the person 

419.49 420.40 B: but 

424.52 426.27 A: that you're in a relationship with 

425.68 428.56 B: right like my best guy friend or something like that 

427.79 428.65 A: yeah 

428.66 438.08 A: or it could still be a girl but i'm just saying like you know not the person you're going to marry like it's your best friend outside of that i mean does that change it for you or does it you know 

432.88 433.84 B: right 

437.81 441.42 B: i think it changes it i think that would make it a lot tougher 

441.05 442.51 A: right 

441.89 443.35 B: because you know 

443.42 446.89 B: like your best friend in college or in high school 

446.45 447.66 A: yeah that's true 

447.03 450.02 B: you might not see twenty years down the line anyway 

450.27 454.95 B: so if you could get a million dollars and not see him then why wouldn't you take that you know 

453.71 454.54 A: right 

454.59 461.28 A: right yeah i mean i keep in contact with a few college friends but no one almost no one from high school so 

462.14 470.36 A: so yeah if i if i had known that you know back in high school and they offered me then i would definitely [laughter] have taken it but right 

462.45 463.46 B: right 

469.71 473.54 B: exactly so that see that makes it a lot more complicated for me 

473.64 481.16 B: because i mean i know a lot of my friends are not like i just graduated high school i just turned eighteen so i know of my friends 

481.38 491.44 B: uh i might not see like it's you know some of 'em i might but you know i'm not planning on seeing all my friends all my good friends right now 

489.04 490.29 A: (( mhm right )) 

491.71 493.01 A: yeah i mean 

491.81 500.19 B: even even even some of my best friends i don't i'm not naive enough to think that i'm that we're going to be best friends for life you know 

498.88 499.77 A: right 

500.72 509.40 A: yeah i mean i think at any given moment a person is always thinking that this is it you know but it isn't and you know i mean 

509.69 517.56 A: you know everyone's life can be different but you know having you know gone through high school and college already i mean i can tell you now that you know 

517.73 520.39 A: well again you know everyone's going to be different but you know 

520.40 521.46 A: um 

521.81 529.00 A: yeah the people who i thought you know for sure were just the you know absolute greatest friends in high school and you i don't even you know 

529.22 539.08 A: i'm not in contact with any of them any more and it's like you know you'll meet new people in college you know friendships will change and um people who were your you know 

539.20 545.69 A: bestest friend in the entire world i mean you know they just become an acquaintance and eventually you don't even talk to them anymore 

546.04 547.83 A: so um 

548.63 551.17 A: yeah i mean people's lives change i think you know 

551.82 554.80 A: um we tend to think that it's going to be um 

555.49 559.44 A: you know people we already know are going to stay that way you know 

560.53 561.81 B: right well you s- 

560.72 573.95 A: and college is a little bit different because by then you're you know you're it's it's you know in high school you're kinda thrown in with the people that are in your you know area w- high college is a little bit different so then the friendships do tend to last a little bit longer 

567.92 568.85 B: right 

574.10 579.65 A: um but even then you know like once i hit the full time working world 

579.51 581.10 B: exactly 

580.02 584.52 A: uh uh you know you've got new coworkers you know they're all a bunch of cool people too 

584.61 588.65 A: you know you start hanging out with them 'cause you see them every freaking day from nine to five you know 

588.71 595.18 B: exactly yeah and y- you know you get a job and you might move off somewhere else and you never know so 

588.93 589.90 A: so 

590.03 591.28 A: (( yeah i mean )) 

596.35 597.59 A: (( yeah yeah so )) 

597.73 599.89 A: i guess it does make it a little bit more difficult
