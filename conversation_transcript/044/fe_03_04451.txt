0.74 15.49 B: (( uh the thing that's wrong with the school is that they need to pay the teachers more so they can be more motivated to teach more subjects in the school mhm okay mhm true yes yes i agree with that yes a hundred percent yes mhm mhm yeah yeah i do find it discouraging that sometimes the teachers don't put in enough effort to teach the children that they don't spend e- enough time to you know to teach 'em properly yes yeah some schools do have problems with overcrowding and you know dis- disciplinary problems where they can't teach the kids before they give up on 'em yeah that's where i find that could be a problem too yes yeah i'm referring to those kinda c- cities that have overpopulation and they )) 

8.51 10.05 A: mhm 

15.58 17.81 A: [noise] okay uh my my name is 

17.98 19.59 A: and um [lipsmack] 

19.71 29.05 A: i i went to a public school all through and um i actually went to school in connecticut where teachers in connecticut were actually perhaps the best paid in the country 

20.87 22.55 B: (( have disciplinary problems and sometimes the teachers )) 

29.13 31.48 A: um teachers 

31.64 37.28 A: [lipsmack] who who had been there for you know over ten years were making approximately sixty thousand dollars a year 

37.35 42.20 A: and i i think once you eliminate the problem of of uh 

42.40 49.81 A: of income that you do get people are more motivated to um to go into public school systems and teach 

45.93 48.45 B: (( just give up on 'em because you know the students just have too many disciplinary problems and they don't )) 

54.66 55.46 A: hello 

54.81 56.45 B: (( they you know deserve the help mhm yes yeah sometimes it could )) 

55.61 59.10 A: oh yeah so i mean do you agree with me on that or 

58.01 61.87 B: (( be yeah yeah could be a situation or a problem but that's how i feel yeah mhm mhm yeah it does go further than that yeah i agree )) 

62.97 65.28 A: and um i know like uh 

65.53 80.47 A: with when i was graduating from from college i'd actually entertained the thought of of teaching and um i went to college in georgia and uh the the income there that that one would get as a teacher 

74.51 75.82 B: (( with that but one of )) 

80.23 81.10 B: (( the problems )) 

80.51 86.12 A: was pretty much you know subsistence level so that was discouraging although i mean 

82.26 83.98 B: (( is you know not )) 

85.51 91.09 B: (( getting paid teachers just get discouraged by other problems you know they just sometimes they just don't put enough effort in it yeah in teaching the kids and that hurts the children in the long )) 

91.19 92.84 B: (( run mhm s- sometimes yeah )) 

92.92 94.00 B: (( because i think )) 

94.52 95.41 B: (( the private )) 

95.48 96.63 A: right 

97.13 105.59 A: um wh- what do you think about outside of of um teacher salary any other problems like overcrowding 

105.95 108.46 B: (( schools the kids the kids don't the )) 

109.15 112.08 B: (( kids have less disciplinary problems and they )) 

111.26 112.13 A: right 

112.46 114.22 B: (( learn more yeah than the public schools mhm )) 

114.06 115.79 A: right 

114.52 115.59 B: yeah 

116.30 118.13 B: (( that could be true too )) 

118.47 123.13 A: right are are you referring to like schools in 

123.51 127.53 A: densely populated areas like uh northeastern cities or 

126.52 128.61 B: (( yeah that could be a factor )) 

129.20 129.91 B: (( in )) 

130.23 131.37 A: right well 

130.55 142.95 B: (( that [cough] oh yeah the funding yes mhm yeah that's true mhm mhm oh sure yeah yeah that's true [mn] oh the schools )) 

141.22 143.73 A: mhm 

143.86 146.27 A: what about schools that um 

146.73 157.83 A: 'cause i mean i was likely enough to go to a school that was pretty diverse in terms of the student body you know i went to school in connecticut and um i think that was greatly beneficial in terms of 

152.52 154.17 B: (( overseas )) 

157.79 160.26 A: you know in life itself 

160.15 174.78 A: um the ability to interact with people of different religious faiths and different ethnic backgrounds you think that that's also a problem 'cause in terms of like public schools they a lot of 'em tend to be community based um 

166.64 167.42 B: (( you )) 

175.27 185.05 A: and so you know if it's not a diverse community the the student body is pretty uh homogeneous do you think that's also a problem 

182.06 182.78 B: (( mean )) 

183.62 185.49 B: (( was new york yeah )) 

185.15 186.88 A: right 

185.60 186.44 B: (( yeah i'm )) 

187.36 189.17 B: (( not sure i'm )) 

190.54 191.26 B: (( not )) 

191.65 193.36 A: right 

192.12 192.98 B: (( familiar )) 

194.14 196.69 A: yeah yeah i i tend to think that um 

197.31 209.30 A: a lot of times in in our thinking of what's wrong with public schools a lot of people just wanna focus on on the the physical problems where it it can you know 

206.70 208.36 B: (( with overseas )) 

209.36 211.24 A: it goes so much further than 

210.52 213.41 B: (( but yeah i know new york has the standardized testing 'cause that's )) 

211.40 213.72 A: (( that )) 

213.65 217.29 B: (( where i went to school [laughter] yeah mhm mhm well it shows us the the statistics )) 

217.64 219.32 B: (( i think you know )) 

219.33 222.81 B: (( but i don't know if it helps or not but )) 

222.56 224.30 A: mhm 

223.09 225.01 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

225.32 225.92 B: (( mhm )) 

226.14 227.40 B: (( mhm yeah well )) 

227.34 228.19 A: true 

228.35 235.37 A: do you think that's a a benefit of um like peripheral or private schools is that those teachers are paid more than public school teachers 

235.31 236.96 B: (( some i think it hinders in a )) 

236.98 242.92 B: (( way because they should be you know they should broaden it they shouldn't just teach for the test they should broaden it yeah so i don't know no that's about it )) 

243.08 244.81 A: mhm 

243.09 245.39 B: (( that's how i feel about public schools )) 

247.81 251.57 A: yeah i i guess i can see that but 

250.10 250.64 B: (( i )) 

251.79 259.62 A: or maybe is it just that that private schools are able to or that they don't have to disclose their their disciplinary problems whereas 

258.49 262.38 B: (( mean uh budget cuts yeah what's your question if they're that's )) 

260.34 261.86 A: (( yeah )) 

264.82 268.78 A: i think a- another thing with with the public schools is um [lipsmack] 

271.60 280.59 A: a lot of the time it's it's almost like the the people who who can afford to to better those schools um they they 

279.23 281.94 B: (( yeah i think they should yes they should put more )) 

280.72 283.08 A: right they'll they'll send their children 

283.02 284.07 B: (( money )) 

283.09 296.13 A: to private school and therefore you know the the financial resources are drained out of out of the um the public schools it's more though you know it's based on on land taxes et cetera but at the same time there's not that that kind of 

289.98 291.93 B: (( into toward )) 

292.93 294.20 B: (( school because )) 

296.27 305.57 A: added um donation whereas you know private schools um i had a couple of friends who went to private school and they were always talking about you know now that they're 

297.09 298.25 B: (( that's )) 

298.37 299.73 B: (( that's the )) 

305.69 311.29 A: they get all these phone calls requesting that you know they they donate money to the school [mn] 

311.02 312.22 B: (( future you )) 

312.41 313.21 B: (( know )) 

313.84 314.84 B: (( they shouldn't )) 

319.31 324.65 A: d- do you think there's anything else compared to um 

324.35 325.00 B: (( cut )) 

326.86 329.39 A: [lipsmack] uh compared to uh 

329.67 334.99 A: schools overseas in terms of like the standardized testing 

335.16 336.01 B: (( any )) 

335.34 342.99 A: r- right like comparing american school the american school system to another school system because i think the only school 

343.15 345.22 A: system i know that has uh 

345.71 351.91 A: standardized tests for graduation the last time i checked was new york and i know other states were 

350.58 352.33 B: (( more than they have to mhm )) 

351.97 354.95 A: were kinda dappling with the idea 

353.99 357.30 B: (( yeah where they're so different you )) 

357.59 361.58 B: (( know different clicks and everything yeah mhm )) 

361.35 362.20 A: mhm 

361.81 363.58 B: yeah 

362.26 372.85 A: do you think that that helps um 'cause i know j- just a little bit about it in terms of of placement is dependent on how well you do on on those exams 

372.40 373.76 B: mhm 

372.99 374.89 A: do you think um [mn] 

374.05 376.12 B: (( yeah they should they should get )) 

377.70 379.12 B: (( your question's to )) 

380.33 381.79 A: right 

380.80 381.56 B: (( get )) 

382.21 384.39 A: i i know in connecticut um 

384.96 392.02 A: 'cause i i graduated in the late nineties is that they were now instituting a a standardized test 

387.36 388.16 B: (( funding )) 

392.03 405.40 A: to to demonstrate that you know you had to reach some kind of level of education or acknowledging these various um subject matters and that you needed you know to pass this test to graduate i 

405.19 414.32 A: i didn't need to when i graduated but i think uh at this point people now do do you think that that helps the public school system or is that more of a 

414.32 423.09 A: a hindrance in terms of like teachers start teaching for the test rather than teaching for the sake of of like a broader understanding in 

423.01 430.31 B: (( or [mn] yeah for college uh-huh and it you know it seems like the the right [laughter] exactly )) 

430.12 431.15 A: (( hm )) 

430.50 431.23 B: (( is )) 

440.47 442.07 A: a- anything else 

442.19 445.44 B: (( what i'm doing now it seems like a a lot of people )) 

448.94 451.30 A: do you think the the government um 

452.00 453.44 A: tax cuts 

454.58 462.96 A: are are right considering that you know a lot of uh state governments now are cutting funding for various programs because they're 

463.11 466.37 A: they're revenue base is going down right 

463.54 464.39 B: (( go into )) 

464.93 465.78 B: (( the )) 

467.73 469.18 B: (( private sector )) 

468.99 473.96 A: do you think that the the federal government would be better off to instead of of um 

474.27 478.81 A: you know cutting taxes it would be to to use that revenue towards 

479.03 481.27 A: assisting schools 

480.97 482.50 B: (( because you know they have )) 

483.34 486.60 B: (( all these government loans it's almost like i'm not saying that you )) 

486.68 488.16 A: right 

487.16 490.10 B: (( know teachers in in public schools or in private schools )) 

491.71 506.20 A: do you think enough attention because i know a lot of times when people think of the um problems with public schools it kinda tends to focus on on major urban centers like you know schools in new york or boston l. a. whatever and a lot of 

501.29 501.85 B: (( for )) 

504.40 507.13 B: (( that matter are are not you know )) 

507.16 509.16 B: (( intelligent but it )) 

508.03 515.89 A: right and not a lot of attention is given to um schools in rural areas like for example the mississippi delta 

511.62 513.79 B: (( just seems )) 

514.62 515.48 B: (( like the )) 

517.17 517.83 A: (( yeah )) 

518.10 522.05 A: do you think anything could be done for um [lipsmack] 

522.40 523.96 A: in terms of 

523.91 537.55 A: like example teach for america they uh the two year program where you know after college you can go teach in either inner city or rural area do you think um the government should do more to like push programs like that in terms of 

537.34 541.43 A: of getting funding or incentives for um college 

541.91 544.05 B: (( the best and )) 

547.24 549.08 B: (( brightest of the )) 

551.11 552.33 A: (( students )) 

554.40 555.49 A: (( well )) 

556.32 557.37 B: (( college )) 

559.69 560.61 A: (( 'cause )) 

561.15 562.23 A: (( a )) 

561.22 564.49 B: (( graduates are are drawn into more lucrative fields )) 

565.90 568.18 A: (( lot of students have )) 

568.79 569.59 B: mhm 

569.14 570.30 A: (( to take um )) 

570.52 572.88 A: (( government loans in terms of you )) 

572.91 576.96 A: (( know right and they're they're paying it off forever )) 

577.84 585.80 A: (( [laughter] yeah mhm mhm do you )) 

585.89 597.42 A: think if the government was giving incentives like loan for- well actually i think they they do that but you know like loan forgiveness and or or something like giving money for for grad school 

597.52 598.24 B: mhm 

597.65 599.89 A: do you think that would kind of
