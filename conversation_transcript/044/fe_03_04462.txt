141.64 143.48 A: oh uh-huh 

143.27 148.86 B: so i understand a little bit about that it's not quite as far for me to go home but it's still a thirteen hour drive 

149.97 152.23 A: well that's a goodly trip 

152.47 155.23 B: yeah it's a goodly trip but it can be done

159.19 161.60 B: have another driver [laughter] 

161.93 167.43 A: well if we could afford the the plane it's really not that big of a trip 

168.12 170.28 A: you know back back there but 

171.09 172.44 A: anyway what 

172.55 177.46 A: what is your perception of the of our public schools are they in trouble or 

176.69 179.61 B: [noise] well let me put it this way 

179.73 184.05 B: i have two children still of school age and i home school my children 

183.96 185.19 A: oh 

185.84 188.66 B: and i have another one who has already graduated 

186.12 187.13 A: well i 

188.37 189.37 A: uh-huh 

188.73 192.93 B: from my tutelage and uh he's in college now 

194.00 197.94 B: so i don't have a whole lotta confidence in the public school system 

197.03 198.42 A: (( well )) 

198.69 211.75 A: well i admire what you're doing we know a number of others that you know are doing that too and it takes a tremendous amount of work and and and dedication 

213.23 216.29 A: so i really appreciate that and i suspect your 

216.54 219.45 A: children will too in the future 

219.77 224.83 A: our two daughters are grown and we're working with eight grandchildren now 

220.15 222.27 B: (( [noise] )) 

226.17 229.27 B: so are any of your grandchildren in the public school system 

226.56 227.40 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

230.33 232.75 A: uh yes they uh 

233.58 236.95 A: uh well out of eight five are 

238.84 241.61 A: (( and actually it hasn't )) 

241.93 244.16 A: worked out too badly 

244.81 251.09 A: uh here at this point as far as the particular schools that they've they've been in but 

250.35 252.43 B: are they still in elementary school 

252.55 254.18 A: [lipsmack] uh yes 

254.15 259.38 B: that makes a difference it's it's after elementary school that i find more problems 

254.44 255.80 A: yeah 

259.16 266.02 A: but well uh i think there's no question about that but it sure seems like 

259.62 260.56 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

266.62 273.02 A: different things that are of greatest concern to us is just creeping down lower and lower 

273.39 278.53 B: well i i must say i agree with that uh my children were in the public school system 

278.32 279.34 A: uh-huh 

279.00 290.12 B: and we we made it through the fifth grade [laughter] and uh when my oldest finished fifth grade and my husband and i a- agreed that we needed to take them out 

282.84 284.51 A: yeah [laughter] 

290.93 292.18 B: so we've 

292.57 298.67 B: home schooled ever since although when we moved i was considering putting them back in school 

299.21 302.57 B: but the week that we moved to north carolina 

302.95 308.25 B: the uh city school system that uh they possibly would have been in 

308.61 314.60 B: had an incident where a young man beat up his girlfriend in the school and no one stopped it 

314.63 318.52 B: [lipsmack] and then the next week a young man brought a gun to school 

319.62 327.09 B: so that pretty much told me that i was not thinking in the right [laughter] and i quit considering that 

319.66 320.68 A: (( oh )) 

327.30 331.61 B: besides my sixteen year old didn't want to return to public school anyway 

332.03 336.28 B: she said she would rather home school and go to junior college 

336.48 338.58 A: well so this 

338.64 340.67 A: this is a girl that's a 

340.24 346.36 B: it's my sixteen year old daughter and then i have a thirteen year old son uh in the seventh grade 

342.05 342.99 A: (( daughter uh-huh )) 

346.95 351.42 B: and he however would like to go to school because he wants to play sports 

352.22 353.39 A: well i 

354.29 365.22 A: that's what i i was a little in my experience it seems like most the young people tend to think you know just just like your your son and 

365.29 366.84 B: well he's not looking at 

365.51 370.84 A: in some ways i can relate with it but i appreciate your judgment on that 

370.22 376.87 B: well he's not looking at the big picture he's looking at wanting to play sports and i i do sympathize with him 

374.63 376.23 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

377.20 381.06 B: but we're just gonna have to find another way for him to play sports 

381.24 386.87 B: he's he's playing uh recreational ba- uh baseball right now 

387.17 389.09 B: but it's not quite the same 

389.14 390.15 B: as a 

390.77 393.26 B: middle or high school experience 

393.41 394.92 B: as far as the 

395.76 397.74 B: intensity of the sport 

397.11 400.47 A: well yeah well that that is true what 

400.61 404.79 A: what do you think of the the basis for all the problems 

405.43 407.72 A: seems like we have a mutual 

407.29 418.19 B: well in my personal opinion i think that they have it's not just the schools i think it's our society as a whole has has turned away from god 

418.69 420.08 B: and uh 

421.15 424.33 B: the values that christians 

424.63 427.40 B: teach their children are not being taught 

428.65 430.93 B: and uh the result is 

430.98 433.72 B: people are behaving the way they're behaving 

434.48 435.82 B: in my opinion 

434.49 436.14 A: and i don't know how 

436.21 440.61 A: we could be in more agreement of that 

439.88 442.41 B: and i don't know how to 

442.46 448.33 B: remedy the situation [lipsmack] other than to teach my children the things that i should teach them 

449.13 461.94 B: [lipsmack] and the quality of their education academically may not be as good as a public school could provide but it is sufficient because i'm teaching them 

462.18 466.43 B: the principles that god requires me to teach them 

466.86 471.14 B: and i'm teaching them how to learn and how to teach themselves 

471.28 478.52 B: so if i have failed to teach them a subject or something they need to do they have the ability to learn it on their own 

480.57 481.48 A: well 

480.62 482.17 B: that's how i view it 

482.32 484.43 A: well i think that's tremendous 

482.36 483.79 B: what do you think 

485.00 486.65 A: well you've really 

487.16 489.39 A: [lipsmack] summarized this very 

489.93 500.74 A: very well and i think that i i became so much more convinced on that the first time when i first went to albania in nineteen ninety four 

501.24 504.60 A: and they had just come out of a communist dictatorial 

504.95 506.09 A: a very 

506.65 512.43 A: uh rigid communist government you you may remember a number of the 

512.66 516.77 A: uh and all the different countries that came out from under communism but 

517.35 522.75 A: they were a people that you know no religion was allowed and 

522.93 523.78 A: (( uh )) 

524.82 528.51 A: and their their heritage was muslim until you go back to 

528.79 532.30 A: you know six hundred years or further back and then 

533.26 535.97 A: um the apostle paul makes direct reference to 

536.81 539.86 A: having taken the gospel from jerusalem to 

540.00 548.45 A: alarium which is basically albania so but they were today they are i have had so many muslim 

549.01 555.53 A: parents uh thank me for coming all the way from america to try and teach their children 

555.86 562.84 A: sort of spiritual um principles and things because they they felt at a loss of how to do it because 

563.28 564.20 A: um 

564.32 566.67 A: throughout most of their lifetime you 

567.56 571.73 A: know there was no religion of any kind allowed and 

572.17 579.73 A: and so it it was just very interesting to see how when people and when spiritual values are withheld from people 

580.18 584.69 A: how how much of a lacking they come to realize there is about them 

585.94 597.32 A: so it was a very special experience and and interestingly enough education is is so much a part of that total picture
