2.10 3.31 B: hello 

3.20 10.27 A: hello i'm sorry my hus- my husband just gave me the phone so i have no idea what we're talking about [noise] 

4.47 5.50 B: hi 

8.78 11.32 B: oh we're talking [laughter] 

10.54 12.00 A: [laughter] 

11.55 20.91 B: um the topic of the day i think is on um you the public schools in the united states and what's wrong with them if anything 

21.06 24.73 B: and what can be done to correct the problems [lipsmack] 

24.30 25.28 A: oh okay 

25.77 26.97 A: um 

27.66 28.57 A: (( well )) 

28.60 29.35 A: (( i mean )) 

28.66 29.86 B: yeah i'm here 

29.71 31.39 A: [laughter] i know the 

30.35 31.25 B: (( what do ya )) 

32.05 33.21 A: i'm sorry 

33.52 35.70 B: i was g- what do you think 

35.81 39.53 A: uh well i know in the town where we live right now 

39.57 54.32 A: i think that the public schools are a little crazy with elementary school students they have strict guidelines on their clothing and their backpacks have to be see through in case somebody brings a weapon but yet the middle schoolers [noise] and high schoolers don't have any of those strict guidelines 

54.50 59.72 A: and i think they would be more susceptible to be causing problems than the elementary kids 

60.31 62.97 B: oh absolutely absolutely 

63.64 64.95 A: (( that's one thing i )) 

63.91 67.53 B: so you think that's that's one of your pet peeves right now huh [noise] 

67.59 74.64 A: yeah it's like just because one school has had a problem they're picking on that school [noise] versus the the older kids that 

75.27 78.50 A: you know would be more influential to the younger kids 

80.14 81.63 A: and i don't really 

80.43 81.43 B: yeah 

81.67 83.58 A: (( i don't know i i haven't i )) 

84.12 87.87 A: haven't really been in school in many years and 

88.70 92.20 A: to know what's going on with them besides what i hear in the media 

92.56 95.07 B: [mn] [lipsmack] well i i think there are 

95.08 99.58 B: i think there are a lot of things wrong with the with the public schools i think 

100.00 101.64 A: [noise] 

100.05 102.68 B: one thing is that 

102.94 104.14 A: (( shush shush )) 

103.45 110.77 B: a lot of the people who are in public schools a lot of the uh the big wheels so to speak who work at the main office 

104.89 106.30 A: [noise] 

110.71 111.77 A: mhm 

110.91 119.11 B: a lot of them are getting those big salaries and i don't think they're really con- that concerned with the kids they do things that advantage their own career 

116.71 117.84 A: mhm 

119.57 123.55 B: that's one of the things that i see wrong because i work in the school system 

124.18 129.00 B: and i see a lot of stuff going on i see a lot of bureaucracy there are a lot of 

129.13 132.68 B: people who are paid to do jobs that they're not doing 

133.13 139.75 B: [lipsmack] there's a lot of waste a lot of spending that's excessive and unnecessary and unjustifiable 

139.78 143.43 A: where they have to cut back on other programs that they should have 

141.85 145.80 B: yeah they have to cut back on yeah exactly and 

144.84 156.39 A: like i know for like the music programs or where teachers have to go out and find funding yeah arts and music and um my brothers are in school and they play 

149.16 150.23 B: arts 

151.23 153.21 B: mhm 

156.63 167.70 A: they're in wrestling and they almost didn't have a wrestling program because they wanted to put more money into other programs such as the football team just because they were no good [laughter] 

164.86 169.77 B: [laughter] yeah and i mean it it well 

170.24 176.05 B: [lipsmack] to me it's a little bit scary when you think about the fact that there's more emphasis on football 

176.10 179.82 B: than even on not even just wrestling but than 

179.98 182.68 B: than is placed on academics 

182.55 184.59 A: mhm exactly 

182.88 187.25 B: a lot of times and i've seen that a lot too because in alabama [lipsmack] 

188.16 196.17 B: i've noticed that you know just from looking in the media i'm sure you've probably heard about this new coach they just recently got a new coach at the university of alabama 

196.36 197.40 A: mhm 

196.65 200.89 B: and the the coach that they had was 

200.92 212.52 B: involved in this big scandal where people were you know he went to new orleans or somewhere and these prostitutes were coming up to his room and [lipsmack] he was obviously paying them to do 

212.53 222.27 B: sexual favors for him so they fired him and they hired this other guy and it was like big big news i mean it was you know i would i'm from um alabama 

223.18 223.67 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

223.50 227.92 B: and i lived there for a while when i was a kid and and i noticed that um 

227.81 238.94 B: you know when i went to visit last week i noticed that there was just so much media coverage about that and i'm like [mn] you know what about when somebody gets a scholarship or 

239.22 247.44 B: [lipsmack] when somebody does really well academically or something uh or was promoted to some big position in an academic arena 

247.60 249.30 B: there's not that much 

249.61 254.16 B: of a deal made about it but people are so much into football 

251.15 252.16 A: mhm 

254.85 261.52 B: [lipsmack] and i think that's a little un- unfortunate and it's not just that situation it's pretty much everywhere i'm thinking 

254.91 256.10 A: mhm 

261.67 271.39 B: well i guess a lot of the public schools they're really really into football and that's okay i i think extra curricula activities are good but i think when you put that 

269.61 274.48 A: but that's not that's not really what's gonna help a child to get a job down the right 

274.73 278.74 B: right right well not the average child now some kids yeah 

274.82 277.07 A: unless unless they go through 

277.23 279.65 A: yeah unless they're gonna go pro 

279.61 289.44 B: well but how how many probably probably point oh oh oh oh oh one percent [laughter] of our kids that play football are gonna end up in the n. f. l. 

279.84 280.68 A: [laughter] 

284.51 285.61 A: [laughter] 

289.34 290.40 A: right 

290.04 301.41 B: so i mean let's teach let's teach them how to read how to write how to do math you know let's let's teach them about uh science topics and things like that 

290.44 291.24 A: [laughter] 

296.09 297.16 A: mhm 

301.21 308.99 A: well i know one thing i do notice with schools nowadays compared to when i was in school that i think is excellent is 

309.27 314.14 A: how advanced the students are with their mathematics and their computer skills 

314.60 319.42 A: 'cause i my nephews and my brothers and everybody that are in school now 

319.58 321.38 A: their math skills 

321.44 324.50 A: are almost to the point where i'm at in college 

324.54 327.86 A: [laughter] and they're like in grade school practically and middle school 

328.15 329.45 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

328.38 333.43 A: i just think that they're they're learning so much more faster 

333.31 336.11 B: and and at a at a younger age 

333.61 334.61 A: i think 

335.85 349.42 A: yeah and like computers in their preschool classroom and that's good but it's just it's crazy to think where is everybody else gonna be in ten years from now they're gonna be superseding our own parents 

341.23 341.97 B: (( [noise] [cough] )) 

349.36 353.15 B: [laughter] and you know because it's to the point where now 

350.47 351.67 A: [laughter] 

353.60 356.47 B: yeah i have a niece who is in 

356.49 365.80 B: sixth grade and she came i went to visit her she lives in florida tampa floria and i went to visit her 

365.87 371.69 B: and she came to me and she said can you help me with my math homework 

371.80 379.75 B: and i was like oh sure [laughter] no problem and it was some kind of you know these word problems that they have 

374.09 375.47 A: [laughter] 

379.81 380.85 A: mhm 

380.19 382.03 B: and it was like johnny 

382.08 394.00 B: did this and peter did that and something you had to figure out the value of n. and set up an equation and solve for n. and you know it was rather involved 

393.85 394.87 A: mhm 

394.65 399.93 B: and i think i did it wrong and and she took it to my brother my brother just got his m. b. a. 

400.01 401.98 B: so he just you know he's 

402.09 405.55 B: probably he's always been better at math than i am anyway 

405.67 406.58 A: mhm 

406.17 410.82 B: [lipsmack] i was okay at it but he's pretty good at it and um 

410.86 415.75 B: so he had to redo the pro- redo the problem and he got the correct answer 

415.96 418.00 B: and i was embarrassed 

418.01 419.18 A: (( [laughter] )) 

418.46 421.91 B: that i'm a college graduate [laughter] you know 

422.07 423.02 A: yeah 

422.99 430.50 B: and and i messed a sixth grade math problem but then i thought well it has i mean it's been years and years and years 

430.55 434.02 B: since i've attempted to do that kinda math 

434.13 436.49 B: so i didn't feel so bad 

436.54 437.15 A: (( [laughter] )) 

436.72 439.13 B: 'cause my sister in law couldn't do it either 

439.14 440.18 A: yeah 

439.84 442.41 B: and she's a she has her master's 

442.86 448.51 B: [lipsmack] in uh social work which has nothing to do with math but she took statistics and so did i 

446.73 447.84 A: right 

448.68 450.45 B: you know and 

449.86 452.08 A: yeah they they just seem to be 

452.84 460.21 A: getting a lot further earlier in age it seems to me at least so i mean that's one good thing that they're 

456.08 457.52 B: (( [lipsmack] oh yeah [noise] )) 

460.59 472.14 A: they're they're good on their curriculum guide but i think things have changed with people or they're not as easy 'cause i remember being at school and i never did my homework and i graduated with honors 

472.18 476.65 A: and now i look at the kids that have to come home with like two hours worth of home 

477.20 480.47 A: so they're like really pushing 'em and making them learn 

481.61 483.21 A: but i don't know 

484.16 486.77 A: i haven't really had to think of the school systems in 

487.06 492.85 A: a while since i haven't been in school and i just have a new baby so i have a couple of years yet before 

491.48 495.66 B: so your and your and your baby is nowhere near school age 

495.01 499.44 A: yeah i have a couple of years yet 'til i [laughter] 'til i have to worry about 

497.15 498.28 B: [laughter] 

499.64 506.23 A: and we're in the military so who knows what school system we'll be in in five years from now when she does go to school 

505.83 506.39 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

506.87 509.67 A: and it's just crazy how they keep changing 

507.18 508.11 B: well 

510.28 514.63 A: the standards on what they need to learn by what age group and 

516.16 518.36 A: and kids nowadays i think are 

518.62 527.09 A: it is scary thoughts out there of if you're in a big city as to what could happen in the school that your kids are going to 'cause 

527.20 530.45 A: all the bad publicity of the things that have happened 

530.37 537.67 B: [noise] [lipsmack] yeah there are a lot of negatives of what's going on in the school system right now i mean but there are still there are a lot of positives too 

537.52 538.54 A: mhm 

537.76 545.01 B: and there are some good public schools i mean there are good public schools in every state in the union and there's bad ones 

543.44 544.81 A: right 

545.04 550.47 B: i think you just have to work at finding the one that's right for you and for your child you know [lipsmack] 

545.44 546.24 A: yeah 

548.97 549.91 A: right 

550.85 551.79 A: (( yeah i )) 

550.89 552.72 B: that's that's what i think 

553.26 554.05 A: yeah 

554.55 555.62 B: because 

554.74 555.72 A: um 

556.64 557.96 B: go ahead 

556.76 557.64 A: go ahead 

557.74 560.55 A: no i'm i was trying to think of a thought but go ahead 

560.15 561.70 B: (( [lipsmack] oh okay )) 

561.28 562.21 A: [laughter] 

561.85 564.10 B: i was gonna say that um 

565.21 573.54 B: [lipsmack] i have you know i have five brothers and sisters and all of us are products of public schools we're all college graduates 

573.56 577.98 B: um three of us are master's degreed um 

578.27 583.38 B: i have a brother in law who's also a product of a public school he's a p.h.d. 

584.03 585.29 B: so i mean 

585.84 589.68 B: i think that there's something to be said about the public schools and i don't think 

589.80 599.89 B: that i went to the best or the strongest school academically i too graduated with honors and to be honest if i was in if i were in school right now in high school i'd
