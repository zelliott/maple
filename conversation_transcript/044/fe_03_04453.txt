26.15 37.87 A: um the public school system everywhere in this country is in dire need of uh major repairs um we do have in um in florida though a um 

38.51 43.87 A: [lipsmack] a voucher program that is available to students in the 

44.36 47.38 A: absolutely worst rated schools 

47.58 52.46 A: uh and there's a statewide testing system that um 

52.87 59.29 A: uh that they use uh to determine uh f. cap is the acronym for the test they give 

59.88 62.50 A: i think in the third fifth 

62.53 66.60 A: the third the fifth and the eighth grade i think 

66.02 67.86 B: how long has that been in place 

68.02 75.75 A: um the voucher system just within the last couple of years because uh the uh the major uh educational unions the um 

69.18 70.41 B: [noise] 

76.48 83.36 A: the a. a. and i forget the the other major uh teacher union are are uh dead set against it

97.47 101.18 B: i i'm in for i am in favor of the voucher system 

100.80 101.88 A: mhm 

101.26 103.05 B: i don't think it passed though 

103.17 105.17 B: i know that we were 

105.31 113.29 B: our standards supposedly have been raised a little bit but we're in real bad shape here and and there's a lot of home schooling is there home schooling there 

113.88 119.30 A: um there is and and once again you know the uh the um 

119.21 129.42 A: the teachers unions and and um the people that stand who uh to lose and rightfully so because there seems to be no accountability uh in that profession 

129.60 133.63 A: um are dead set against it but we do have home schooling um 

134.63 135.79 A: uh here 

136.65 140.57 A: and uh they're finding that not only against the um 

137.75 139.35 B: it's pretty popular here 

140.63 145.65 A: uh this is this is really interesting uh it's it's not only because of the um 

145.74 147.87 A: lack of um [lipsmack] 

148.45 155.91 A: of of values being taught in the public schools you find very very many people that are pulling their kids out of parochial schools 

156.06 162.69 A: because of the uh the the liberal uh biased and political correctness of the uh textbooks and the curriculum 

162.91 165.18 A: so they're even pulling them pardon me 

162.93 164.36 B: really in the pa- 

165.57 167.62 B: in the parochial schools 

167.00 181.42 A: yes they're pulling them out of um they're pulling them out of catholic schools they're pulling them out not to put them back in the public schools but to home school them they're pulling them out of catholic schools they're pulling them out uh lutheran schools uh they're pulling them those are the two that i'm most familiar with 

174.13 175.29 B: (( to home school )) 

182.51 186.23 A: because of the the uh because of the mindset 

182.68 183.34 B: it's 

186.54 193.68 A: of the principal or the pastor or the um the teachers in these particular 

192.29 194.80 B: that it's too liberal or too conservative 

194.23 195.74 A: way too liberal 

195.71 196.74 B: really 

196.15 200.67 A: way too liberal yeah that's why they're pulling them out they're not only in terms of 

200.68 205.40 A: of uh political uh correctness in the secular sphere 

205.49 207.92 A: but in terms of the um 

208.04 214.01 A: of the uh the fundamental values of this particular religion or that particular religion 

213.83 216.16 B: are the teachers allowed to discipline there 

216.82 222.10 A: oh they are yes that's one of the well that's one of the pluses of the parochial schools they are allowed to discipline 

222.15 223.55 A: uh but 

222.96 225.69 B: but they aren't in the public school system i mean 

224.95 227.01 A: no that's um 

226.96 236.85 B: it's it's really frightening here i mean when the teachers here are are carrying weapons to protect themselves from the students that's that's pretty sad 

235.93 240.00 A: (( yeah that's sad yeah there's there's some radically wrong uh i've i've )) 

240.09 245.56 A: i tend to follow the news not um obsessively but um 

245.39 246.64 B: they have 

246.71 248.58 B: i don't know 

249.25 252.84 B: how long ago this started but teachers here 

253.05 258.58 B: have to have cell phones in the room with them because they're afraid otherwise 

259.67 261.76 B: i'm i'm sure that's probably it 

259.70 261.02 A: now that that 

261.89 266.47 B: well no i know that one one of my daughter's friends is uh 

266.52 272.57 B: in the elementary school and she she has a phone with her so it's not just the high school 

267.80 268.77 A: mhm 

272.37 273.35 A: wow 

273.37 279.04 A: um the the details like that i'm not i'm not aware of that could be the case here um 

279.23 285.83 A: i'm not i'm not sure uh but yeah i know they just passed a um 

282.21 283.39 B: pretty sad 

286.30 294.96 A: a they they tried to do things here i think very similar to california you know if they can't get it through the uh legislator they do it with uh initiatives 

295.34 300.79 A: and so they passed this uh classroom size initiative you know which 

300.88 302.22 A: (( um )) 

302.56 309.70 A: you know sounds good looks good uh nobody's got enough money uh to uh to implement it and um [lipsmack] 

309.13 311.45 B: well the thing is when i went to school 

311.22 323.62 B: i never was in a cl- i i came from the midwest in in kind of a rural area we always had between thirty and thirty two kids in our class and we had one teacher we didn't have teachers' aides but the kids were made 

323.52 332.63 B: to behave and everybody got along just fine and we didn't have a problem i think everything is so out of control that 

333.41 337.69 B: they probably do have more people then they really need but 

336.64 337.85 A: it's it's 

337.97 343.20 A: beyond it's it's beyond your imagination how out of control it is if if you've um 

338.09 339.57 B: when you can't 

341.73 343.52 B: i can't imagine 

343.32 350.55 A: the same just recently uh what was going on with all girls at that chicago high school 

350.04 350.95 B: uh-huh 

350.56 353.96 A: have you seen that in the news the last couple of days okay 

352.44 353.43 B: yes 

354.12 360.31 A: and now they the students and i'm sure uh with the help if not the instigation of their parents are suing 

360.96 367.81 A: uh the school system to uh uh uh in objection to the suspension that they're getting 

368.59 382.10 A: uh and they haven't even begun you know criminal proceedings uh or anything like that yet so it is just it is totally uh out of control i think we probably grew up about the same time um 

382.20 388.82 A: i was uh came up uh grew up in buffalo new york and then spent my whole career in the midwest in michigan 

389.08 390.73 A: (( [lipsmack] and um )) 

390.10 391.15 B: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

391.41 396.69 A: it's just incredible the other thing that you have out there and we have down here in south florida is um 

397.05 402.74 A: is this uh insanity about teaching in uh in languages other than english 

402.42 403.47 B: oh 

403.08 409.07 A: yeah now i'm going [laughter] i just i don't understand it and i've traveled to other countries 

408.63 415.16 B: well now recently within the last year or so they they have implemented a program where 

415.88 418.84 B: the kids do have to 

421.29 423.43 B: take their classes in english 

422.99 425.51 A: you know that's a it's a long time coming 

425.87 427.08 A: yeah 

425.96 427.53 B: um it's 

427.63 429.34 B: i i don't know how 

429.73 436.86 B: it's it's supposed to be working that way i don't know if they're actually doing it because i think sometimes it's easier for the teachers just to 

433.50 435.74 A: mhm 

437.46 451.35 B: to do it the the easy instead of take the time with the kids but um i and i don't know if you have ever heard of roger hitchcock whose um he used to be a mayor here and was quite controversial but he has um 

439.09 440.06 A: right 

451.67 454.79 B: um a radio talk show and he was really 

454.82 456.68 B: instrumental in 

457.15 468.28 B: in talking to the public about the fact that the longer and talking to the hispanic and and trying to educate them that if they want their kids to succeed 

465.29 466.34 A: mhm 

468.80 480.87 B: they have to be able to speak and read the english language because they're not going to go anywhere in this country unless they can do that and and if if they're not made to get into the mainstream 

472.91 474.23 A: absolutely 

480.38 484.43 A: exactly yeah and and i think that is just so obvious but um 

484.77 490.73 A: you know those those teachers' unions are so strong you know uh and and uh 

491.47 504.71 A: i'll agree with them that uh teachers could probably be better equipped be better paid and then that the school systems need more money but uh the fact that they reject any uh attempt at accountability uh that they uh like most professions 

504.69 518.08 A: they uh you've got this wall of ssilence you know they won't um they won't point out the bad ones amongst their midst if they get rid of the bad ones whether they're doctors or attorneys or cops or teachers get rid of 'em uh 

517.08 520.17 B: well once they get i don't know if it's the same way in in 

520.23 527.79 B: in the lower levels but i know with you know in college boy once in the university level once they get tenure that's it 

527.18 534.11 A: oh i know it i know it's just unbelievable you know and uh well at least at the college level uh 

535.20 539.17 A: some of them i know are starting uh well if 

540.03 546.02 A: they do it right it's effective and this is where you're reviewed by your by by the student body as well as by 

546.11 548.80 A: um you know other faculty member 

548.93 556.85 A: um [lipsmack] but i was thinking at least at the college level you know they could 'em doing research or something like that get 'em out of the classroom you know they might be uh 

556.91 561.04 A: they might be brilliant but they're just poor teachers um 

561.34 570.40 A: i don't care how brilliant you are you know if you can't teach it if you can't you know then then get these people out of the classrooms um they're not doing anybody any good 

569.87 575.32 B: well we've certainly addressed what our opinions are i think we're on the same the same uh track there 

574.80 576.69 A: it sure sounds like it 

575.75 586.54 B: it says uh it says uh what can be done to correct the situation and boy i don't have a clue i i feel i feel so blessed that i got my daughter through school 

581.09 582.26 A: oh 

586.68 598.04 B: and through college and and don't have to worry about it anymore but now my grand kids are coming along so you know you almost have to you almost have to take an interest again you can't put your head in the sand forever 

589.77 590.97 A: i know 

595.88 599.89 A: well i think there are a number of things and i think that we've touched on them one is that uh
