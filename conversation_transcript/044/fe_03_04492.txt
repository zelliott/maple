1.01 4.05 A: hello hi there my name's averill 

1.09 2.47 B: (( ah hello )) 

3.93 5.71 B: uh my name's lawrence 

5.18 6.34 A: hi lawrence 

6.21 7.52 B: how's it going 

7.35 10.94 A: ah i guess okay this is my first time with this so it should be interesting 

10.93 16.20 B: um yeah i've done a few of 'em too so i guess i'm an old hand but uh 

14.14 15.05 A: (( all right )) 

16.31 17.61 A: okay great 

16.46 17.82 B: anyway so 

17.87 25.03 B: uh what's your feeling on the topic which i guess is that the something wrong with the schools 

24.37 31.73 A: yeah the public schools well it's been declining for a long time especially depends on where you are some are declining 

31.57 42.30 A: more rapidly than others but uh [sigh] i think a lot have recently over the last ten or more years ah it's one of the easiest things to take money from 

42.43 47.03 A: if nothing else whenever there's a problem with money said oh well let's take from education 

47.81 48.65 B: (( mm )) 

47.84 62.46 A: and oh don't you think that's true i mean you hear about that even now with the the stuff that's going on in california is that oh geeze it's one of the first things to go is we're gonna have to increase class sizes and kick out sports and music and things like that 

62.51 74.84 A: and it's that's a basis a large basis of uh the public school problems is too many kids not enough teachers not enough resources and not enough uh extracurricular activities 

75.29 81.66 B: oh well yeah it's a complicated issue that's for sure is that where you're from california i'm from ah in from texas austin texas 

81.34 85.48 A: yeah oh yeah yeah i'm out in california what about there in texas 

86.27 92.45 B: [cough] i guess it's the same as anywhere um uh i think that you know it seems like the performance is decreasing so 

92.60 96.12 B: um that's a bit of a that's a bit questionable 

96.13 108.62 B: um and yeah money probably is one bit of a problem um i know that they're always seem to be struggling for various you know funds for various things 

108.30 109.22 A: (( mhm right )) 

108.67 109.92 B: um 

110.06 121.29 B: i guess then the question is well what's the answer 'cause i'm not totally sure that um that more money is always the best just is the best way to go about it um just simply because there is 

121.58 125.22 B: some places spend more than others but they don't seem to get much bang for the buck 

125.09 126.18 A: oh no i 

125.27 129.16 B: so i think there's a i think it's kind of a complicated question 

128.98 136.00 A: oh definitely that's why i said the easy wa- the easy way of looking at it is often that the money issue because no yo- part of the problem is you 

136.07 139.14 A: you have to spend enough money that you're not 

139.31 150.08 A: uh basically using a lame horse i mean huh it it it doesn't work at all if if you don't have enough uh money to run it period which is basically kind of what we're on now 

149.77 150.82 B: mhm 

150.07 159.81 A: then you have the issues of you know you the standards everybody shooting for the lower standard instead of you know aiming for the higher standards um 

159.25 168.12 B: yeah i know i definitely think that's true i think the one thing i'd probably say the one thing that i would say is not used very well or not utilized as much as it should be 

168.13 172.02 B: is that they don't seem to make use of um they don't try to make use of 

172.14 181.49 B: um the internet and various types of um more i guess you'd say standardized centralized um instruction 

181.19 184.42 A: right but but then again a lot of that goes back to money 

181.54 182.85 B: where 

184.93 198.41 B: yeah maybe i guess so i think um i mean i think part of it may just be and um and this may be more at like say the university level um but i think part of it is that the people that do the teaching 

185.57 186.93 A: [laughter] 

194.13 195.03 A: mhm 

198.58 205.05 B: feel somewhat threatened by the new technology and um and so i think there's some resistance 

201.16 201.98 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

205.07 215.27 B: um on the part of you know the administrators and the teachers to um potentially using technology to as much as they could um and uh and so 

215.33 226.79 B: which i don't you know i'm i'm not sure exactly how you would try to to do that i guess what i would say is the best thing is just to have more options and i think what you tr- always try to do is um 

226.91 236.45 B: i mean i think people my fundamental feeling is is that some people want to learn and you certainly want to give them the opportunities to learn as in the most efficient way that they can 

233.78 234.72 A: right 

236.43 242.61 B: um and then i think on the other hand there are some people that maybe aren't don't take advantage of the opportunities that they have 

242.46 243.34 A: (( mhm oh yeah )) 

242.57 247.39 B: um and which is not a reason to not provide them but it just i think that 

247.35 260.86 B: um i think that you just like you said um i think it's it's important not to teach the lowest common denominator er but instead offer a range of opportunities so that anyone can take advantage of them that that wants to 

260.63 261.43 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

260.90 262.24 B: but um 

262.44 273.23 B: but yeah i guess what i would try to do i mean the one thing i think may be would be useful and i think some people are trying to do this is to offer more free education um 

273.47 280.81 B: would by the internet to where people can take classes on their own time or however they want to um [mn] 

274.98 275.79 A: mhm 

278.60 281.99 A: oh yeah there are a lot of you see advertising for it all the time for 

281.78 284.78 A: the universities and things like the the private stuff 

284.61 299.11 A: and there are i know that uh out of here in san jose and of course ours does have uh quite a bit in that's why i think it's actually in in the lower uh schools that uh have the issue with not using the internet enough of the uh the 

287.52 288.71 B: (( mhm )) 

299.58 307.04 A: accessible internet and and other electronic things um yeah i think they're out there and i think it's starting to come around and with anything 

301.58 302.61 B: uh-huh 

305.66 314.07 B: yeah i think it i think it definitely is starting to come around i think that um and and i think you can in some ways you know the that it's a natural thing 

313.89 326.67 B: um i think people try to take advantage of uh opportunities that are available um but it it'd be nice if maybe it was done maybe more at a federal level um in other words i guess it's kind of an economy of scale type situation 

322.68 323.55 A: (( mhm [laughter] right )) 

326.56 334.61 B: where there is you know there is million hundreds i guess probably about tens of millions of students of every grade level and so it seems like you could have 

334.45 342.49 B: an effort to have a centralized standardized text book of high quality um and you know just as a base level 

339.02 340.41 A: yeah 

342.26 354.48 B: and then people in the various states they want to use it that's fine they don't want to use it they can do their own thing but you at least make make like kind of a minimum standard quality product that's available and somewhat standardized um 

353.26 356.89 A: yeah but everybody'd have to agree on it [laughter] 

355.87 358.96 B: yeah well i mean i 

357.29 365.73 A: therein lies the rub you you i i'm living out here in in uh revisionist history central i mean that's one of the big problems out here is that you know 

362.81 364.59 B: yeah i know i i 

364.53 378.80 B: well i it's i studied science and um and i know that there's a big issue with evolution and i find it a bit of a shock because you know at least in the scientific community there's not really much of a debate and yet some people are very resistant to ideas that are 

375.35 376.23 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

378.78 382.00 B: really pretty much long since established 

381.73 382.45 A: (( yeah )) 

381.94 387.89 B: um and at the same time you don't obviously don't want to offend people they have the right to whatever belief that they want 

387.47 388.29 A: right 

387.68 400.65 B: but there is kinda some just base standard that i think should be agreeable and um and it'd be nice just and and i would i wouldn't be opposed to having you know it'd be it seems smart to me to have several choices in other words 

400.53 406.99 B: you just put the money out there to have a common text that would preferably be free and on the internet and then you'd 

406.80 418.85 B: you could have various lectures and that type of thing that would also be free that then people could go and learn and then schools would serve more as a testing centre to just verify that that the student has the knowledge um and and i think you could do that 

415.59 416.84 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

417.03 419.26 A: then you'd be putting a lot of people out of work 

419.03 420.49 B: pardon me 

419.68 423.77 A: there you'd be putting a lot of people out of work and that then you would be getting into resistance 

421.81 430.81 B: well i um yeah i know i understand that is one aspect that people would be worried about their jobs but i think it and from an efficiency point of view 

430.71 445.22 B: um it's it's better to have quality products and um and then i think there's always gonna be a need for the personal side of it as well so it's like i i think what you'd do is you'd make it to where the teachers would not really need quite as much 

445.10 458.15 B: um you know in other words not every teacher's gonna be able to be the the the a hundred per cent best top quality teacher and so you may as well take those few that are just the best in the nation and then try to make their teaching available to everyone 

458.03 464.87 B: um and then i realize that you had the other people that would potentially be displaced by that would probably feel threatened in some ways 

464.68 473.59 B: but um i just think it's it's a more efficient way of doing it and and it's kinda like the in some ways it's kinda like the you know the old question of going to the assembly line 

473.44 480.49 B: you know do you try to preserve the artisan um or do you try to move to the more efficient way and i think that 

473.64 474.75 A: (( mm mhm )) 

479.05 490.35 A: and then you get in the problem with that is is uh children learn differently and at different rates and if you and if you start getting expecting everybody to do it at the same rate at the same stuff then 

484.32 486.79 B: yeah no that's true certainly that's true 

488.67 500.79 B: well i think that what you should do is just make you let the children learn at whatever rate that they're that they're comfortable with and then the parents would decide if they're satisfied or not in some ways i would have a tendency to put 

500.29 500.97 A: (( [laughter] )) 

500.67 505.89 B: more of the onus on the parent in terms of determining whether they're happy or not um 

504.57 518.58 A: [mn] oh that'd be another big problem first you got getting the money for all the new stuff then it would be figuring out what is the standardized and who gets to to figure out what is is the right thing to teach then you have to figure out how how to get the parents involved 

508.94 510.57 B: mhm 

518.34 524.19 A: i mean this is this is all lovely stuff but it's never gonna happen i mean we can we can't decide [laughter] 

521.41 532.59 B: uh well i don't i'm not so sure i think it um i think it certainly could happen 'cause i don't i think it is more efficient and so and i don't think it really co- you know to design to have a nationwide curriculum 

532.46 544.02 B: to me doesn't seem that um unbelievable it and and it may be that it may be that this would only be really practical in the in maybe say the sciences and the history and kinda the harder um 

543.97 552.24 B: the harder what i mean is more um more fact based topics and uh and some of the other things like i think like english 

547.44 548.54 A: mhm 

552.54 555.39 B: that i mean there may be certain topics that that are better 

555.31 566.41 B: taught some ways than others and so it may not be that all these all the topics would be um taught in this way and i think what the other opt- option that would give you or the other advantage is 

566.26 580.11 B: is you'd also be able to have a much wider diversity of subjects taught and so the student could tailor their learning to their own interests a little bit more than they're able to now so if someone wanted to study some relatively obscure thing 

579.91 580.77 A: mhm 

579.99 589.26 B: you know if they're able to access experts on the internet i mean in other words if you had an expert that was teaching a class in more of a virtual classroom and the student goes to the school as [mn] 

589.53 599.89 B: as basically a way of staying out of trouble for one and keeping track of them um and then also to have the facilities so they have the computers over there that they can then you know be in touch with the expert and have a kind of a virtual class of 

592.34 593.35 A: (( mhm mhm ))
