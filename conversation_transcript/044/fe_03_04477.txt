0.30 1.42 B: hello 

1.26 2.61 A: (( hello )) 

2.20 4.57 B: hi i'm eric how are you 

3.63 4.44 A: hi 

4.83 5.98 A: you're who 

5.65 6.61 B: eric 

6.33 8.30 A: eric i'm denise 

7.70 9.19 B: (( hi it's good to meet you )) 

8.92 9.88 A: you too 

10.09 10.97 B: (( so um )) 

11.34 13.13 B: this is my first time by the way 

12.81 14.42 A: yeah [laughter] me too 

13.93 16.74 B: oh pardon [laughter] okay 

16.12 16.88 A: (( well )) 

17.25 18.16 B: (( um )) 

17.27 21.18 A: yeah i guess we're supposed to talk about public schools or something 

20.62 22.96 B: yeah did you go to public school 

22.88 24.20 A: yes i did 

23.88 31.64 B: yeah i went to um tenth grade at the public school um personally i'm not a huge fan myself 

28.23 29.07 A: yeah 

32.04 45.61 B: just um having seen the difference i grew up in uh a suburb of new york city and um my school was uh it was very mixed demographically really across the board and um 

32.29 33.47 A: yeah 

36.78 37.99 A: (( [noise] wow )) 

45.62 53.20 B: i just found that for me personally everything was extremely easy and i don't think that uh 

53.77 67.68 B: most schools at least in most districts have the facilities to properly challenge all of the students at all the different levels or support the students at um at the other end of the spectrum especially with disabilities 

59.69 60.69 A: yeah 

67.30 70.00 A: yes i totally agree with that 

70.91 71.96 B: (( so um )) 

71.97 76.47 A: i have a son who has a disability and and i feel like he's 

76.55 80.07 A: not getting as much help as he should be and 

80.54 81.61 B: mhm 

81.00 83.46 A: getting kinda frustrated with that 

83.52 90.39 B: yeah um good good friend of mine uh teaches autistic children and she's currently looking for a new job and she 

90.43 104.79 B: has been telling me the differences between what uh private schools or private programs have versus the uh publicly funded programs and it's it's really kind of earth shattering the difference between the two and uh it's rather upsetting 

104.88 107.12 A: wow [noise] 

106.37 107.58 B: (( so um )) 

108.44 115.14 B: yeah i know that um i was actually talking to my friend's mother just oddly enough yesterday and um 

115.63 118.60 B: she was basically professing that uh 

118.45 131.73 B: her idea which i kind of agree with to an extent is that um if if the schools became more community schools and were um you know kindergarten through 

131.79 138.22 B: the end of high school instead of being broken down um into economies of scale 

138.23 139.98 B: then it might uh 

140.48 153.31 B: better establish some sort of community because um all the students will really know everybody in their area and older siblings and younger siblings will be attending the same schools and um 

153.10 167.44 B: it'll always there will always be uh a sense of somebody watching over you how the students and you know there's um more of an authority because not only are there older students um but there are of course day teachers and the administration as well 

157.93 158.93 A: yeah 

167.21 168.10 A: yeah 

167.37 169.91 B: and um that made a lot of sense to me 

170.10 171.76 A: yeah i think so too 

172.36 177.16 A: i never really thought of that before but that would be a really good good thing i think 

174.11 175.85 B: no neither had i 

178.95 184.82 B: yeah well um where do you live approximately 

181.15 182.25 A: yeah 

184.28 186.17 A: uh i live in minnesota 

186.01 188.98 B: uh minnesota so how are things over there 

188.97 192.20 A: uh they're not too bad 

193.18 194.16 A: uh 

195.07 198.67 A: i don't know i've i've always been in a smaller town so 

197.76 199.46 B: mhm 

199.83 202.90 A: uh my public school was 

203.13 206.66 A: the whole school was you know kindergarten through 

206.94 212.85 A: um twelfth grade you know we had didn't have you know different schools for different grades so 

208.49 210.09 B: oh wow okay 

213.14 217.38 A: you know it was good there but the place that i'm living now 

217.72 219.84 A: they have oh 

220.60 227.00 A: different ones you know for kindergarten through third and then third through seven then 

227.04 228.28 A: so on and yeah 

227.66 230.13 B: yeah that's how it was for me 

231.62 234.49 B: and um one thing that i 

234.81 243.36 B: um saw at least again my my experience has been i'm close to a major um metropolitan area so 

243.24 250.81 B: um it was a pretty huge school that i went to when i was in public school and one thing is that um i think that it gives a much better sense of 

250.90 254.16 B: of the world around 

254.41 258.87 B: everybody really i mean outside of a small community which i think is very important 

258.87 259.74 A: yeah 

258.97 260.42 B: because um 

260.37 270.32 B: uh i did go to private schools for um tenth eleventh and twelfth grade and i noticed that really um it was kind of jarring for those students to then go 

270.15 280.00 B: to college um for most of them it was okay but for some of them really i could see the um effects of the years and years of insulation 

271.20 272.09 A: mhm 

279.63 280.49 A: (( yes )) 

280.24 281.81 B: and um 

282.22 287.06 B: so um yeah i guess there are always advantages and disadvantages but certainly 

287.24 295.35 B: i'd imagine that uh just like most other things if uh the public schools had more money that would uh certainly make them more better 

295.06 296.03 A: (( yeah mhm [mn] mhm )) 

295.41 310.07 B: um i i have a math degree and i've been out of school for a couple of years and i'm looking for a new job now and one thing that people have been telling me is that i should look for um a teaching position and in new york city especially there are very few 

309.97 321.58 B: math and science teachers such that even without certification they're willing to take people and um still the salary is like twenty three twenty five thousand dollars a year so 

322.02 326.66 B: on one hand it's like nice that i don't need any certification but what is that telling 

327.08 340.22 B: me about these schools that they're taking these teachers and of course it's better to have a teacher with a bachelor than math than no teacher at all but still to not even have a masters let alone a masters in education 

335.72 336.54 A: yeah 

339.99 341.01 A: mhm 

340.37 355.04 B: um that's kind of upsetting and then how are they going to attract quality people when um presumably they could do something different and pot- potentially much less strenuous and make a lot more than like twenty three to twenty five thousand dollars a year 

354.67 355.82 A: yeah 

355.32 366.02 B: so it it's really really tough and i think that if um certainly i don't know if taxes are the way maybe um a better allocation of the taxes would be kind of useful to um 

365.16 366.49 A: mhm 

365.92 370.41 B: kind of attract the teachers the better teachers to to the schools 

368.93 370.03 A: yeah 

372.00 374.93 A: mm and i've always thought that there should be 

375.25 376.50 A: more 

376.62 378.51 A: teachers you know 

379.46 382.96 B: uh definitely the class sizes are really huge 

379.87 380.43 A: (( [mn] )) 

380.82 382.69 A: than yeah yeah 

383.78 387.24 B: and potentially even with what they have now if um 

387.38 400.80 B: if the classes could be somehow divided um maybe every other day or even like half a session be um a teacher could spend with maybe half the class while the other half is doing kind of independent work 

397.23 398.03 A: (( yes )) 

400.46 401.48 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

400.87 406.31 B: then it gives more of a feel of uh a small class size even though the class size is double that i 

406.02 407.21 A: mhm 

406.80 410.12 B: guess that would also be an option i don't know 

408.89 409.80 A: yeah 

412.30 416.41 B: no um what what kind of disability does your son have 

416.45 421.72 A: he was at first diagnosed with um p._d._d. 

421.61 423.16 B: mhm 

422.43 435.48 A: which they say is like under the category of autism but now they've kind of changed that and are thinking that he's um mildly mentally retarded along with uh 

425.78 426.77 B: (( mhm )) 

433.43 434.37 B: (( mm )) 

435.56 437.11 A: verbal apraxyia 

437.16 438.69 B: wow okay 

438.63 450.33 A: so and he's like six years old now he hasn't started talking yet he's at like a two year old level and and i've been trying really hard to get the maximum you know amount of 

450.45 452.38 A: help for him you know 

453.62 456.94 A: i get really frustrated 'cause his teacher 

457.44 460.66 A: needs to take time off during the school year 

461.51 463.08 A: and and 

463.23 464.61 A: in order to um 

464.96 466.79 A: teach him during the summer 

466.74 468.39 B: oh okay 

467.87 469.02 A: so 

471.03 474.26 B: so he's in the public school system then 

471.42 472.62 A: it must be just 

473.13 474.74 A: yes he is yeah 

475.10 477.48 B: and um is there a 

477.73 481.60 B: um like a disabled class or 

481.90 484.95 B: is is he in with the regular population 

485.14 489.79 A: no he's in a disabled class right now he will be going um 

490.18 493.21 A: partially with regular students once 

493.44 495.94 A: he starts kindergarten in this fall 

495.37 497.66 B: yeah that's probably good 

497.13 498.26 A: but 

499.32 501.41 A: and i'm hoping that he will be able to 

501.61 506.75 A: adjust [laughter] okay to that 'cause his his class size 

502.98 504.06 B: mhm 

506.98 512.79 A: you know with the kids with disabilities was pretty smaller probably only about five or seven 

513.03 514.53 A: kids you know 

514.24 525.28 B: yeah potentially another thing they can do public schools in particular with um children with um any kind of um learning disabilities is uh 

525.23 529.64 B: it might be really tough but um if they could be kind of 

529.67 542.42 B: um you know grouped together maybe um spend a little bit more time on the but be grouped together with the same learning disability or ones in the same group that might be helpful because i know when i ah 

539.04 539.85 A: yeah 

542.19 550.39 B: when i was very young and there was um a learning disabled class i mean everybody was completely different and had completely different needs 

548.14 548.89 A: (( yeah )) 

549.82 550.80 A: yeah 

550.93 553.29 A: and that's exactly the way it is here 

553.21 554.17 B: (( mm )) 

556.01 558.52 A: and so i mean he seems like he's the only one 

558.79 563.06 A: actually in his class that doesn't really talk 

562.83 563.63 B: mhm 

563.17 565.43 A: you know the rest of them have 

565.78 567.28 A: many different 

567.71 568.96 A: (( disabilities [noise] )) 

570.21 572.57 A: i don't know if he's getting [noise] 

570.23 571.02 B: yeah 

572.84 575.97 A: the one on one you know attention 

576.24 578.39 A: that he needs either you know 

578.75 579.72 A: with his 

581.01 583.21 A: disability or whatever so 

582.89 587.03 B: yeah yeah that must be frustrating 

586.48 587.70 A: yes [laughter] 

588.87 597.81 B: um have you like have you thought about i guess a topic but what what your what his school in particular could possibly do
