0.03 2.14 A: hi i'm tammy 

1.51 3.81 B: hey tammy this is rob how are you doing 

3.33 5.02 A: pretty good how are you 

4.83 6.13 B: oh not too bad 

6.51 11.39 A: oh let's see ah school systems i think they're a joke actually [laughter] 

10.49 12.55 B: i think they're a joke too 

12.23 14.67 A: really [laughter] uh-huh 

13.19 16.86 B: (( yeah because i went to school and i didn't learn anything so )) 

16.63 30.30 A: ah th- there there are too many students per teacher they just push you through um i i really don't think that the majority i'm not saying all the majority of teachers care about the actual individual's education 

21.86 22.74 B: yeah 

30.26 33.83 B: i would say there's a large percentage that do not yes 

33.54 36.74 A: um i i you know i remember when i was in school um 

36.71 41.00 A: you know there th- there was one teacher i can remember out of out of the twelve years that 

40.85 55.64 A: that really stood out in my mind because he did care about his students he had a farm an- an- and you know after school and on weekends he would actually invite the kids there and we did things on on the farm and stuff but other than that i mean the teachers really didn't spend any one on one time you know what i mean 

56.11 66.17 B: i had a lot of one on one time but you know i i think the majority of people did not i mean anecdotal evidence isn't really good for anything other than you know one of our arguments but ah 

66.68 67.84 A: ah i 

67.03 69.35 B: i don't know it ju- d- it just depends though 

68.92 75.63 A: i i think i'm probably the wrong person to be be doing this kind of ah a of a conversation 'cause my daughter's having problems in school right now 

75.49 76.87 B: oh 

76.07 82.04 A: she's fifteen and she's a a a straight a student um ho- however 

80.41 83.72 B: okay my sister is the same thing i'm with you so far 

83.21 92.48 A: well her grades have have come down to cs ds an- and even one f. because she is bored it started a year ago she asked them to challenge her 

89.70 90.87 B: yes 

92.50 98.65 A: she said you know i here's my homework got it done [mn] and they just leave her sit in class and i just really think it's a joke 

92.79 93.60 B: yeah 

96.79 97.51 B: (( it )) 

98.49 102.64 B: is that see i had this it it's terrible that happens all too often 

99.12 99.70 A: (( [mn] )) 

102.30 114.22 A: yeah i- it does and that they're just they're pushing her through and she's bored you know so she just sits there and there there's way too much time for you know handwriting of notes and and and i don't know they just 

112.64 115.33 B: mischief and not paying attention you 

114.86 116.89 A: right right a- and so i 

116.09 117.31 B: know i'm with you 

116.91 122.01 A: mean even though she knows the work she's not learning anything because she's not paying attention 

121.83 129.77 B: well a lot of times too it's just a lot of rote memorization they don't really teach any actual problem solving skills and or concepts 

129.81 132.60 B: as a you know they just kind of dispense knowledge 

132.15 133.86 A: (( right right )) 

133.58 136.32 B: so i don't i have a problem with that as well 

136.96 137.60 A: (( ah )) 

137.14 138.94 B: (( i don't know what are you going to do i )) 

138.68 139.70 A: um 

140.11 143.56 A: i really don't know ah [laughter] 

142.84 152.73 B: mean like in general i mean there's really i mean th- that's the p- unfortunately the system that ah we're probably stuck with that i'd say it'd take at least twenty years probably to change things significantly 

152.16 159.00 A: i agree i agree um ah i do believe that each person can make a difference um my youngest 

157.94 159.78 B: on an individual level yeah 

158.95 162.94 A: right my my my youngest is is fifteen my other two are out of school 

162.71 176.38 A: and um but but when they were little um you know i did all the the p._t._a. and the volun- the volunteer to help on the playground and you know try to stay involved as much as possible and ah even like you know go in help grade papers whatever could be done 

163.17 163.73 B: (( [mn] )) 

165.33 166.11 B: yeah 

168.10 169.23 B: oh yeah 

176.20 177.06 B: yeah 

176.48 181.50 A: um but it it just it's on a small scale and it doesn't really seem to help 

182.24 185.66 B: every little bit helps though i mean that that kind of thing there 

185.70 195.89 B: the kids w- usually with the parents that are willing to get involved i mean they're they're in such a homelife situation that the school isn't really going to effect their actual education one way or the other 

196.93 197.83 A: yeah 

197.72 212.16 B: i mean it's it's the kids whose parents just don't care that can really get screwed by the school system because a lot of the times like some kids go home and play scrabble with their parents on the weekends or watch jeopardy with their mom after school some kids just go home and you know 

211.95 213.50 A: run the streets [laughter] 

213.11 217.64 B: run around run around with no shoes throwing rocks at each other you know yeah [mn] 

216.01 217.08 A: yeah 

217.26 224.74 A: yeah well i i just i don't know i if i think one of the problems is is the teachers are completely underpaid 

224.96 227.22 A: i i i personally i 

226.36 229.57 B: they are they they don't make much but it'd be it depends 

229.27 240.17 A: well i think it depends on what state you're in the state i'm in w- which is west virginia [mn] the teachers are so underpaid it i- it's it's unbelievable and their their benefits aren't really that great 

231.56 232.46 B: yeah 

233.74 234.61 B: yeah 

240.28 241.34 A: (( i mean they they )) 

240.54 242.18 B: that is always a problem 

241.61 251.41 A: consider considering that they you know each one um has approximately you they're only supposed to have like so many students and each classroom is over quota by about seven 

248.14 248.97 B: yeah 

251.37 252.94 B: see that's a lot 

252.36 265.62 A: y- yes it is um you know they have these standards for a reason you know because the children need to be taught and if you have if you're only allowed twenty five kids in the class and you have thirty seven kids in the class well that's just you know way too many 

256.65 257.48 B: yeah 

265.56 266.20 B: (( yeah )) 

265.96 269.84 A: the i mean some some of these kids don't even have seats you know the the 

269.05 270.59 B: it's a budget thing 

270.00 275.20 A: they they have like tables set in the back so they can sit there these these children aren't learning anything 

274.84 276.11 B: (( uh-uh )) 

275.51 283.68 A: and and i don't know i i as far as other states i can't speak for that but it's i think west virginia school systems are a joke they just really 

279.76 280.55 B: yeah 

282.46 287.20 B: people are always jo- talking about west virgin- west virginian and mississippi 

286.72 298.61 A: are yeah huh it well it's no wonder you know we're the we're the brunt of jokes because you know it is it's true that that the education system here is just it's pathetic kids drop out in ninth tenth grade 

296.21 297.40 B: (( yeah joke )) 

298.60 300.47 B: [mn] that's pretty young 

299.21 301.40 A: they they do they do 

300.65 302.30 B: is it like an epidemic 

302.04 303.48 A: yes yes 

303.52 304.41 A: um 

304.26 314.73 A: a lot of it is the the teachers don't care now i do have to say um i currently r- just not too long ago ran into a teacher um she seems to she seems to care there was a child in school 

314.52 327.35 A: who ah wasn't doing real good he was you know he was kind of a trouble maker um and he got expelled and she isn't now this is has nothing to do with the school itself she is coming to his house after she is done teaching each day 

327.41 335.11 A: and she's not being paid for it she does it so she can drop off like math papers and things like that to to challenge his mind 

335.00 337.51 B: that's nice i mean that's above and beyond 

336.17 336.73 A: (( [mn] )) 

337.11 345.94 A: yes it is i mean but but she is the only one that that i can [mn] you know that i can c- that comes to my mind out of hundreds [laughter] you know that are around here 

346.05 354.39 A: i do i do have to say that we we have a good university um i don't know how that happened but as far as the as far as the public schools no 

346.11 346.88 B: (( yeah )) 

351.39 352.18 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

353.72 355.24 B: yeah 

355.09 361.78 A: no a- and most of them you know they they quit school in the ninth tenth eleventh grade and then have to go out of state to find work 

362.50 365.09 A: y- the young kids that should be in school 

365.12 366.37 A: (( learning [laughter] )) 

365.51 367.57 B: not going out of state to find work 

366.99 370.73 A: yes they're they're leaving to go d- you know to go find jobs 

369.98 372.29 B: then west virginia have some problems 

371.74 373.73 A: yes major ones 

372.74 381.73 B: both the educational and apparently economical which the economic problems lowers your tax base which lowers your e- ah your budgets for your schools 

375.25 376.01 A: yes 

381.08 382.45 A: right right 

382.00 386.43 B: so it's kind of one of those problems that just kind of persist and ah making itself worse over time 

385.87 387.45 A: a really bad cycle 

387.59 392.14 A: it just doesn't seem to be getting any better and and unfortunately it's the children who are paying 

392.22 400.88 B: yes and and us and us ah at the same time because you know we have to live in the world that eventually they w- they will create for us as we age 

392.38 393.47 A: paying the price 

401.03 406.34 A: well they they did ah a a school consolidation thing here oh [mn] a couple of years ago 

406.18 406.99 B: yeah 

406.19 416.70 A: and i have to say that that you know they they built a bigger st- school for the high school students but but in my opinion it actually made the situation worse 

416.72 422.83 A: because they don't have any more teachers but yet they've bussed in these these kids from other places 

422.68 423.86 B: (( oh )) 

422.72 432.12 A: are y- you following me so there's actually more kids per teacher it's just that it's in a bigger building with you know yeah and it it's that doesn't solve anything 

424.05 424.96 B: yeah 

428.62 430.71 B: a bigger building oh 

431.96 432.77 B: (( no )) 

432.19 437.84 A: so they're bussing these kids in and and they're like herding them like cattle they they're not learning anything 

438.13 443.42 A: my my daughter she comes home with you know a backpack full of notes and i'm thinking you know when does she have time to do anything 

443.83 444.39 B: (( [mn] )) 

443.91 453.10 A: and and i asked her you know she said well i'm bored mom you know i t- and and you know her grades were showing it as and bs and then she just got to the point where she kept asking you know i i really 

453.00 459.88 A: um wan- want something else there there i already know this stuff here's my homework got it done in three minutes you know and they were just ignoring her 

460.24 467.62 A: so eventually you know after about a six month period her grade s just started dropping and when we investigated it was because she was bored 

467.84 476.50 A: she says you know w- why should i pay attention she would skip that class and you know go to a friend's class or whatever and just sit there and gab and the teachers allow it 

476.93 479.89 B: that's see that's out of hand i had no idea about that 

478.17 485.21 A: they d- they don't care [laughter] they don't care as long as they get their pay check it's you know everything's fine 

485.62 486.48 A: (( my hus- )) 

485.66 491.00 B: see unfortunately teaching is one of those ah one of those jobs where it's not okay just to do enough 

491.21 494.64 B: because unfortunately enough is make sure they don't kill each other you 

494.00 494.89 A: right 

494.84 495.58 B: (( know )) 

495.93 503.73 A: well w- we are lucky in that aspect the school here um as far as safety y- you know they they they are they are yeah they are pretty good um 

500.33 501.71 B: the kids are safe 

503.57 517.03 A: [sigh] but a- as far as their education it's just it's not acceptable it's it's not i i just i feel so sorry for the kids growing up i actually transferred my daughter last year to another county 

518.41 520.06 B: that had better schools 

519.45 523.16 A: yeah so that she could get the education that she deserved 

523.45 524.40 B: (( yeah )) 

523.80 527.49 A: and and she's sa- you know she di- she was doing really good there and it just 

526.86 529.74 B: where did your other kids go to school have you always lived in west virginia 

529.28 533.41 A: yeah same county lived here all my life so you know

537.50 538.31 A: no 

538.51 552.65 A: no i can honestly say no i did not um i always had a passion for math you know and um i i when i by the time i was fourteen i had a assistant bookkeeper's job for a public service district water company 

552.94 559.54 A: and um i just always had this thing for it but as far as learning it in school no i learned most of that you know 

559.61 560.59 A: at work 

560.73 562.36 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

561.97 564.44 A: yeah ah they just paid 

564.73 573.02 A: i i actually from my high school years i don't remember a a whole lot of learning [laughter] i just really don't because the the schools are a joke 

573.41 576.48 A: the the like i said the one teacher i can remember 

576.27 588.59 A: him spending the extra time you know if so and so didn't understand well he'd chase you down at lunchtime you know hey did you did you get that right or or did you need any more help with that and but he's the only teacher i can think of that did that and i actually 

583.88 584.67 B: yeah 

587.69 588.70 B: (( see now i've )) 

589.07 590.27 A: i'm sorry go ahead
