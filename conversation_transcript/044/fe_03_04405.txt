227.12 230.98 A: weird thing off the top of your head or out of left field 

229.89 234.13 B: yeah no and i've heard questions like that before you know 

234.27 235.54 A: mhm 

234.91 235.91 B: like ah 

236.35 250.20 B: you know if you if somebody gave you like a million dollars or something would you rather have that or have somebody give you you know penny a day and it multiplied by two each day you know and if you you know most people that are like 

250.56 252.27 B: very like [mn] 

252.86 267.70 B: very with their decisions you know they'll take the you know million dollars but if you think about it and logically work it out then you'll see that a penny a day times two for like i think it comes to a year maybe oh you'll make way more than a million dollars 

265.03 266.67 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

267.36 270.97 A: [noise] yeah the magic of compounding certainly ah 

270.34 272.14 B: (( yeah ))

285.68 287.13 B: (( [mn] e- ah ah )) 

285.99 289.04 A: it's tough to go for ten minutes about this topic isn't it

289.45 290.35 A: have you 

291.64 292.44 A: (( huh )) 

291.67 295.18 B: [laughter] not too bad because you can elaborate on it and stuff you know

296.08 298.42 B: (( just ten minutes not too long [laughter] )) 

298.33 302.33 A: have you ah done many of these before or is this your first one or

302.97 303.82 A: ah 

304.44 310.95 A: me too [laughter] yeah i'm just figuring out how we can talk for ten minutes about something like that it's ah 

310.44 312.31 B: probably like an operator or something 

310.96 314.67 A: sort of a simple yes or no answer i guess i don't know what the 

314.08 317.44 B: yeah i thought you were an operator or something [laughter] 

316.70 318.62 A: ah no no it's ah

344.99 345.80 B: (( [laughter] )) 

348.75 352.02 B: i guess it they'll notify you when it's ten minutes 

351.03 354.06 A: you keep going until they tell you i guess huh 

353.75 357.42 B: (( yeah um yeah we have to talk about the topic i i guess you know )) 

357.96 359.47 A: ah okay 

358.30 362.04 B: [laughter] 'cause then you can just talk and be like you know what's up [laughter] 

361.83 371.22 A: [laughter] yeah but that sort yeah that sort of a topic that doesn't open up many doors for philosophical discussion i guess 

363.17 364.26 B: [laughter] 

371.42 379.69 B: yeah yeah [mn] they need to be more more detailed in be more detailed with it you know
