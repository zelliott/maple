0.28 2.58 B: uh hi my name is chris 

2.75 4.56 A: hi my name is deeha 

4.71 6.16 B: (( all right )) 

6.08 8.38 A: so where are you at 

7.31 10.16 B: um i live in atlanta currently 

10.03 11.16 A: atlanta 

10.92 12.35 B: yes and you 

11.55 13.89 A: okay i'm in austin texas 

13.67 14.75 B: oh okay 

15.26 17.91 A: so what do you think 

15.60 16.43 B: (( um )) 

16.53 26.49 B: well um i guess i'm currently a student in college and and i came through the uh the public school system and personally um 

20.13 21.55 A: mhm 

23.75 24.64 A: yeah 

26.40 38.40 B: i went to a public school and the you know my public school was one of the best in pennsylvania but i personally do feel that there is it is a problem with the public school system 

31.93 33.26 A: oh yeah 

37.89 46.96 A: yeah i i'm currently a masters student and um i don't feel like i picked up a whole lot [laughter] in public school 

40.46 41.47 B: oh okay 

45.16 46.01 B: yeah 

46.52 47.42 B: yes 

47.10 61.26 A: personally um it was relatively uh kinda play- played down to the lowest uh [laughter] denomination yeah 

48.30 49.62 B: yeah i agree 

57.59 60.62 B: yes to to the lowest denominator yeah 

60.72 64.31 B: so the the like the dumbest kid kind of 

64.35 66.75 A: brings down the rest of the class 

64.69 73.44 B: is babied along and and the top at but see for uh in my school system mm we have um 

73.49 77.23 B: gifted programs for the kid for the smarter kids 

76.84 88.95 A: yeah well i mean there's hon- there were honors programs too but even now i know my wife's a teacher and the honors programs aren't really much except for the same class that the regular class is [laughter] yeah wi- 

79.62 80.37 B: yes 

81.71 82.65 B: uh-huh 

85.82 87.12 B: (( yes yes )) 

87.66 88.54 B: right 

88.94 95.52 A: with the kids that signed up for the honors class [laughter] yeah yeah not like they're getting a lot extra out of it or anything 

91.83 92.61 B: yeah 

95.00 95.87 B: (( yeah )) 

95.95 97.76 B: uh i think um 

98.54 105.89 B: i think maybe some of the biggest problems are in the cities personally i think that i mean 

103.79 104.67 A: yeah 

105.97 107.42 B: there's so many 

106.13 109.21 A: well yeah even in the high school i went to is relatively raw 

109.11 110.09 B: really 

109.79 113.30 A: yeah anyway i mean it's nothing spectacular 

113.07 114.45 B: yeah yeah 

113.70 117.79 A: not not really pushing the students very hard 

117.66 120.68 B: yeah i think and i think maybe 

118.58 130.35 A: and and they probably can't just because they have a certain amount of kids in there that [laughter] are already having trouble when they're not getting pushed you know i don't know 

125.80 126.61 B: (( yeah )) 

128.83 137.47 B: yes definitely and i mean i think like in uh i mean 'cause i i'm currently living in atlanta and going to school here 

137.30 151.22 B: and i i mean i'm living in some neighborhoods around atlanta that are pretty bad and you see you see you know school age kids just walk around the streets during the day when they should be in school and i mean 

143.93 144.83 A: uh-huh 

151.43 152.39 A: yeah 

151.54 154.36 B: it's clearly it's clearly you know 

154.20 166.72 B: they're not very motivated to go to school because a i mean i think a lot of the times it just might not even really apply to their lives like they they think you know what am i going to do i'm not going to go to college i guess it's on 

161.91 162.82 A: (( mhm )) 

165.49 170.60 A: and they they not have a role model to look up to that went through the system and has something to show for it 

168.16 169.24 B: exactly 

170.32 174.98 B: exactly i mean maybe their parents don't even care whether they go and 

174.49 180.90 A: well not not even to the maybe not care enough but maybe they don't even know what the benefits are 

179.29 180.11 B: right 

180.71 182.52 B: right right exactly 

181.57 184.36 A: if they never if they never went through the process 

184.10 185.52 B: exactly i mean 

184.77 187.84 A: they don- they don't even know what there is on the other side 

187.52 188.58 B: right 

188.06 190.79 A: you know can't even imagine it 

189.00 190.03 B: and 

190.24 194.29 B: they can get it i mean i think that's where the you know vicious cycle 

194.48 196.37 A: yeah exactly 

194.50 195.87 B: becomes i mean 

196.28 203.44 B: you don't you don't know how to better yourself and so you don't even try i mean just kind of you know what's 

201.22 205.01 A: right yo- you can't even picture it 

204.05 212.13 B: what's the point of me going to these classes where i may learn you know some chemistry but i live in the ghetto you know with you know 

212.44 216.55 B: you know like wha- what's the point in learning chemistry if you know 

215.82 218.85 A: right if you don't know what you're going to do with it 

218.20 219.63 B: exactly 

219.09 225.17 A: yeah and a lot of the other problem is that the the teachers 

220.22 221.90 B: (( then the yeah )) 

225.64 228.09 A: a lot of their control has been taken away 

228.09 229.62 B: yeah yeah 

229.05 232.94 A: there is not really a lot you can do without getting sued [laughter] 

232.31 234.71 B: right right i yeah that's 

233.64 234.42 A: so 

234.92 237.46 A: discipline's kinda out the window 

235.07 236.17 B: i mean 

237.60 240.69 B: a lot of kids basically go to school 

241.26 248.35 B: and have no respect for for teachers you know they have no respect for the authorities at the school 

248.35 259.34 A: and and then yeah anyone who is gonna stand up and dish out any kind of discipline they have no no one's going to back them up in administration 

248.58 249.65 B: and i mean 

253.49 254.35 B: (( yeah )) 

259.04 260.96 B: right right exactly 

260.35 261.10 A: so 

261.39 262.52 B: and then 

261.47 263.72 A: what do you expect them to do i mean 

263.09 269.03 B: yeah and parents and i mean and some of those cases like the parents are 

269.18 270.46 B: you know they don't 

269.41 271.81 A: yeah they're not even on the teacher's side you know 

271.25 272.97 B: exactly 

272.74 273.50 A: so 

274.14 275.66 A: [laughter] 

276.09 279.00 A: the problems the list could go on forever 

278.79 281.98 B: yeah there's there's a lot of problems i think 

281.97 283.59 A: yeah 

283.21 283.77 B: (( [mn] )) 

284.60 285.68 A: solutions 

284.83 287.18 B: but [laughter] 

286.96 288.00 A: [laughter] 

287.33 290.87 B: (( solutions yeah the we were supposed to talk about solutions )) 

288.96 290.03 A: so 

290.59 292.00 A: [laughter] 

291.30 292.13 B: (( then )) 

292.53 299.40 B: i don't i i think that the schools need to i mean and this this is probably 

299.83 313.18 B: never gonna happen and probably not a very viable option but i think maybe one way to solve the problem would be to make schools go back to almost like some sort of not like a boarding school where the 

313.06 323.63 B: kids live um at at the school but like something that's not like militant even but something that's very structured 'cause it just seems like like schools these days are 

314.45 315.62 A: mhm 

321.06 321.93 A: right 

323.55 333.63 B: so unstructured that that it just doesn't even matter whether the kids attend classes like i think there needs to be more like discipline and structure to the schools [mn] 

333.05 336.34 A: yeah i i agree with that i don't how they implement it but 

335.68 337.34 B: exactly i mean 

336.88 341.69 A: because an- again any time you try to implement anything like that oh you get a lawsuit 

341.45 343.38 B: exactly exactly 

341.98 346.14 A: or no no backup from the administration to implement it 

344.92 349.36 B: i mean it would have to be some sort of like federal mandate that would say 

350.24 356.40 B: you know like set up some sort of structure like this but you know everything's going 

354.49 356.25 A: yeah 

356.39 368.55 B: i mean and i'm a pretty liberal person but i think sometimes the thing is just getting too liberal like everybody's just like not you know like my kid is not your property and this and that and this and that they should think 

362.01 363.10 A: yeah 

367.15 376.13 A: yeah no i i i can i can see that i'm probably right about where you're at definitely liberal but maybe it's getting a little too liberal 

371.37 372.67 B: yeah yeah 

375.77 379.61 B: yeah things might be just going th- the way where 

376.60 377.39 A: (( you know )) 

379.82 391.36 B: but you know but then i also think like okay so our parents i mean i don't um my at least my parents i don't know about yours but my parents you know grew up in the kind of 

391.54 395.23 B: the structured type school where you know 

396.18 399.62 B: they didn't really have as much i don't know 

400.99 404.08 B: uh it wasn't quite as liberal at least 

403.97 406.36 A: no yeah both of my parents too 

404.09 404.84 B: (( and )) 

405.07 405.96 B: you know 

406.20 408.23 B: so they're all you know 

408.41 411.72 B: in the workforce or whatever but i i mean i think that 

412.15 426.67 B: if i if you just try to think about how things have changed since back then but i mean kids are still you know our businesses are still making progress or kids are still bright we're still making scientific advances all the time you know 

426.44 427.16 A: (( yes )) 

426.82 432.75 B: so i mean in the end it are the schools really failing like at least in terms of 

432.97 433.98 B: i mean 

434.50 439.04 B: progress in terms of you know tech- technological progress i don't know 

437.75 443.08 A: yeah well a- again also that whenever our parents attended school 

443.13 448.98 A: the population in terms of size has grown so much that there's so many more students per classroom 

446.41 447.18 B: (( yes )) 

448.27 450.26 B: yeah definitely 

449.71 453.44 A: and so you know the [laughter] 

450.39 451.23 B: (( yeah )) 

453.45 455.12 B: yeah i mean especially wh- 

453.57 455.95 A: it it just throws everything out of whack 

455.81 460.04 B: yeah and i mean i don't know from what i've read like just 

459.80 471.61 B: down maybe where you are in texas and in california it seems like those places are just getting flooded with people and i've even read like there's i don't know schools in california where the people 

471.73 478.73 B: i don't know they go all year round but they don't go a full week they go i don't know three days a week or something like that 

475.59 476.46 A: mhm 

478.17 480.23 A: yeah i'm not sure about that either 

480.12 482.37 B: but that's pretty crazy 

482.95 484.71 A: yeah 

485.67 489.16 A: so i guess we don't really have a solution [laughter] 

488.68 490.69 B: no [laughter] 

489.79 490.76 A: (( oh )) 

491.67 492.75 B: a solution 

491.97 494.51 A: yeah i don't know yo- 

493.49 496.04 B: solution's very difficult i mean 'cause 

495.22 504.98 A: you [mn] increase salaries for so that you have people that want to be there or people that will stay there so so it makes it worth it for them to invest in it 

497.87 498.76 B: (( yes )) 

498.93 499.86 B: yeah 

503.24 504.45 B: right 

505.38 506.28 B: yes 

505.46 518.81 A: you know it it's not it's not worth it to 'em to invest so much of their time and energy if they're not going to be rewarded for that in terms of teachers and and then with the pay structure where you have coaches making so much money and 

512.62 513.84 B: exactly 

517.91 519.70 B: yeah definitely 

518.79 527.84 A: i mean even in high school and the administration makes so much money and then your teachers are le- left with the scraps right and you expect them to 

526.07 527.01 B: yep 

528.02 531.55 A: give a structured creative environment 

530.98 532.80 B: right right it's uh 

531.83 534.31 A: and and pay for the spies for the classroom 

534.38 539.22 B: yes well and and also take shit from the kids on a on a regular basis or 

538.52 541.63 A: and get no backup from the people making more money than them 

539.95 543.87 B: yeah the administration can just hide behind their desks when 

543.48 544.47 A: yeah 

543.90 549.40 B: yeah the teachers are probably i'm sure facing some pretty scary things some days i mean 

549.47 553.58 B: some kids just get out of control i mean i know i saw it in my high school and 

553.06 553.94 A: yeah 

554.08 559.96 B: you know i wouldn't want to be a teacher dealing with some of those kids 'cause the kids just feel like they can't be touched you know 

557.27 558.37 A: me neither 

560.26 561.43 B: like 

560.80 562.19 A: and they really can't 

561.98 568.79 B: exactly i mean maybe if they if they commit some sort of crime where the police will come okay but other than that i mean 

567.24 569.47 A: yeah but that's about it 

568.92 575.87 B: they can scream at a teacher they can you know throw desks and wha- what are they gonna get uh a detention 

574.95 576.52 A: suspended for a day 

576.44 578.15 B: yeah i mean it 

576.96 579.47 A: yeah and they don't care 'cause they don't want to be there anyway 

579.08 581.79 B: exactly so it's just [laughter] 

580.31 581.05 A: [laughter] 

581.82 587.97 B: that's that's i think a big trouble i mean the the teachers don't get paid a whole lot and they have to put up with some 

588.48 591.63 B: pretty pretty hectic stuff 

591.30 596.65 A: i think and maybe one thing they could do is set up all i mean they already have alternative schools for kids 

596.05 597.57 B: yeah yeah 

596.81 599.89 A: but they could set up alt- alternative schools that have
