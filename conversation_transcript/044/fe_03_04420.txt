0.43 1.52 A: hello 

1.59 3.00 B: yes hi 

3.39 4.73 A: hi there 

4.85 7.89 A: i'm uh i'm i'm uh i'm adam how you doing 

8.04 9.47 B: fine i'm daniel 

9.54 11.50 A: hi daniel nice to nice to meet you 

12.35 15.92 A: so we're supposed to talk about the uh uh the hypothetical situation 

15.93 18.05 B: about the what 

17.05 19.81 A: the hypothetical situation that they just posed 

20.23 30.93 B: yes if they offer us a million dollars to i i i mean my connection is very bad i mean i have and [laughter] i didn't hear exactly what she said she said it was a million dollars if what um 

30.37 35.48 A: if uh uh [mn] but the only stipulation was you could never talk to your best friends again 

36.42 38.37 A: that's that's honestly a tough one 

38.62 40.62 A: that's that's 

41.13 45.48 A: that that's that's a tough one um wh- what do you think you would do do you have any ideas 

46.61 53.57 B: i don't know just i just you know to think about it i mean i i had some very very good close friends in my life 

53.42 54.77 A: mhm 

54.18 58.95 B: and you and you know like friends i thought my our friendship will last forever 

59.26 61.68 B: and now i i don't even know where they are now 

62.10 63.48 A: [sigh] but to 

62.40 71.07 B: so i- uh uh i m- i mean on the one hand you don't want to lose such a friendship but but sometimes these friendships jus- just get just get just get lost you move away 

71.09 77.98 B: and you don't have a connection and then if you had the money at least you would stay with the money or something if you don't waste it [laughter] i don't know 

77.97 92.31 A: i mean uh that's true you will you uh you will i i i thi- i think that's right i think i think you could clearly make new friends you could clearly make make good friends and frankly having a million dollars eases would ease your life in in a lot of ways that that you could concentrate on on friendship 

92.55 102.95 A: uh uh but a- and and i and i have i have no doubt that if i if i never spoke to any of my friends again i could make new ones 

103.22 106.22 A: but would i want to do that 

106.45 107.63 B: well i 

106.46 107.49 A: if that w- 

109.00 109.78 A: go on 

109.44 115.47 B: [mn] yes i i'm just in a special situation because i just moved back from overseas 

115.62 119.80 B: and i l- i left a lot of friends behind 

118.94 120.00 A: uh-huh 

120.27 127.35 B: and the connection is getting weaker and weaker all the time and i really don't have new close friends here yet 

127.07 138.29 A: but what if some some of those friends that you haven't seen in a long time what if they i mean uh one of the things i love most is is when someone calls you out of the blue or you call them or you get an email or you're passing through a town i'm 

127.40 128.31 B: so 

138.12 149.67 A: i travel a lot and when i pass through a town you know wh- where i i haven't been really close with a guy since high school but but i can still you know see him and and and and rekindle that kind of thing i think that's 

149.69 155.07 A: that's real special to me that's i i don't whether it's worth a million dollars but it's special 

155.18 164.06 B: i know i mean i mean i can understand what you're talking about i have a few friends like that but if i ever g- go go by in on germany or somewhere 

164.12 176.35 B: then i would still have the same feeling i mean if i i- i have very few friends that if i was told that i can get a million dollars not to speak to them anymore i would tell this benefa- this benefactor 

176.81 183.60 B: if you're willing to give me a million dollars why do you make such a cruel offer to me [laughter] why are you doing this 

181.97 183.15 A: exactly 

183.68 194.87 A: [laughter] well if you've got a million dollars to give away you get to make the people who don't have a million dollars do awful awful things that's that's that's one of the big [mn] points of having a million dollars [mn] 

195.81 196.83 A: (( hm )) 

197.39 202.34 A: yes i i that that is such a tough one 'cause normally my my my choices are so 

202.33 214.62 A: i i i can can t- totally understand but like the two things like one of the things i value most in the world is friendship but i am really poor i mean you know i'm c- i'm i'm participating in this study for ten dollars or whatever 

215.14 216.19 A: um 

216.55 226.92 A: so and that w- that would all you know a million dollars is enough to really set you up for life if you if you live fairly modestly you can you can comfortably live off of the interest [sigh] but 

227.00 231.09 A: i got some good friends and not only that not only do i have good friends i have good friends 

231.13 245.83 A: who have been so nice to me that i would owe them you know some money like if if my financial burden were eased i i would i w- i would owe to them to you know to buy dinners and pay off loans of theirs and and do nice things like that i 

246.25 259.22 A: i guess also imagine the satisfaction if you turned down the money like how pleased would you feel about yourself and how pleased would you feel about about your friends you know and like and and you could look at 'em and say look what i look look look how much i care for you guys 

260.57 265.75 B: yes i mean i mean it depends also who these friends are sometimes these friends are just people we meet 

265.90 273.57 B: from a job or from some from somewhere and the they were the i mean they they must they might they might think 

273.59 283.49 B: maybe m- my our friendship means to you so much but i think you're an asshole that you gave up a million dollars just to be in contact with me [laughter] 

283.57 284.65 A: [mn] y- 

283.58 287.72 B: i don't know i don't know this is a this is a tough one i mean i mean it's as if they tell you 

287.82 290.36 B: we'll make you rich if you become an asshole 

290.81 291.86 A: yeah 

291.11 295.83 B: uh but i don't know i don't know if you're allowed to say these kinda kinda words here in this study [laughter] 

295.63 303.93 A: uh what a how about this how about if you if you if you agree to yourself you know a a way find a way to take the money and say look this really sucks i can never talk to my friends again 

303.81 311.54 A: but there there's there's no rule against me using some of this money to do tremendously nice things for them but they'll never know they'll think i'm an asshole 

311.51 322.72 A: they'll they'll never know but all of a sudden you know their credit card bills are paid off or ah or their children have a a have have a c- college funds their college is paid for 

323.41 326.44 A: uh you could you could sort of maybe justify it that way 

326.41 340.20 A: and say i've made it all better i mean 'cause i i i know i've i've i i i've i've seen the logic you know in some people you know who have thought about taking insurance policies out and you're killing killing themselves for the insurance money for for to take care of their family 

341.23 346.62 B: well i think if someone offers you a million dollars and not to be in contact with a good friend of mine forever 

346.68 353.71 B: that's a that's not even that's not only cruel but i think that's really criminal to to to avoid 

353.94 357.92 B: one of one of my best friends i mean to take away one of my best friends 

358.19 360.45 B: and if that's criminal 

360.66 370.69 B: and if if that's injustice i don't have to be such a big righteous guy and i can find a way to contact that friend although they have forbidden it 

370.30 371.61 A: [laughter] 

370.49 378.25 B: because because if they if they make me such an offer that's so unjust i don't have to be 

378.32 379.38 B: the pope 

379.66 388.08 B: i mean i i mean i there there are millions of ways to contact people today so they tell me don't call and we'll we're we're we're wiring your phone 

388.12 394.97 B: okay so i'll send him a letter so so i'll i'll go to their houses you know i don't know i mean i i mean i mean 

393.66 394.90 A: okay well i mean 

394.98 400.13 B: i wouldn't i wouldn't have bad feelings cheating if this was the o- if this were the offer 

400.16 409.63 A: well it's set up a hypothetical i mean like so so ah ah ah ah i like your logic though [laughter] the the existentialism of it all it's very well i'll make my own rules 

410.33 413.41 A: um [lipsmack] yeah i i don't know 

414.49 422.18 A: i- that that that that's ultimately a tough one a- and in this in this little conversation i've gone back and forth several times on it i uh 

422.61 424.12 A: [lipsmack] i think 

425.15 430.03 A: so so you're saying that you would take the money and and contact the friends anyway [noise] 

430.58 438.56 B: um well th- that's a possibility the the the most likely most likely what i what i would do if someone came up with an offer like this to me 

438.47 452.02 B: i would say open up the case and show me the million dollars in cash and then i'll think about it i mean first show me the money is this is this real or not but i know that this this is only a hy- hypothetic- but it's [laughter] like you know 

444.32 445.52 A: right 

452.16 455.06 B: in many situations it's 

455.65 460.95 B: very difficult to answer un- until you are really in that situation i 

460.70 464.83 A: yeah million dollars million dollars 

464.56 469.64 B: mean i i mean i mean for me it would be enough even if it were even it were nine hundred and eighty thousand dollars 

469.58 474.62 A: [mn] [laughter] [mn] i'm trying to think like if if i had [lipsmack] 

474.63 484.30 A: if i had the million dollars and no one now i knew now i knew no one except people i didn't really like so now i i i would have to completely start over in the world 

484.41 486.24 A: make myself over 

486.34 492.60 B: fly to club med sit at sit at the bar and give free drinks to everybody for three nights and you'll have lots of friends 

486.72 487.28 A: (( [mn] )) 

492.69 506.62 A: that's yeah well you really have friends where you have those you have those sort of uh uh uh uh gold diggers star fuckers you know who who are just just a- attracted to your money and that's that's that's different like it's always it's always nice to 

506.78 510.19 A: [lipsmack] i still hang out with a bunch of my friends from high school you know which was which was 

510.22 523.51 A: oh almost twenty years ago and and it's sorta nice because like we know each other before we became who we are and so you know so you can you we can call each other on our on our on our bullshit 

524.13 525.08 A: and 

524.14 536.07 B: well well well well i don't know i i really hate people that are attracted to money i mean i mean i think i think that i have a lot of qualities i also have a lot negative things but i have a lot of qualities 

536.03 547.18 B: and you know sometimes when if i go out with a girl i i i like spend all that money to show it i mean i don't know not a lot but i don't show how my real situation is 

547.19 550.01 A: no well that's that that's natural i mean 

548.67 555.81 B: a- and then and then and then i wanna ask her are you attracted to me because of my money because if you are here is the news i don't have money 

555.23 555.94 A: (( [laughter] )) 

555.94 556.76 B: (( [laughter] )) 

556.47 571.33 A: well i guess that that's all part of the of the of the dating scam you don't wanna look poor like it it it all dates back to biology you know like where a girl is bio- biologically looking for a a a a mate who can take care of her and so she wants someone who can protect her from the big bear 

571.39 585.86 A: and uh a- and and which in that case you know she she so so so you have to you can't look destitute on a date you always spend more than than than you but you're right but you but you don't want them to be attracted to that you just want it not to be a factor i suppose 

584.78 595.15 B: but most it more than ninety perc- ninety percent of in- intercourse that goes on in the world is for money [laughter] i mean i mean let's face it 

595.20 598.64 B: but um money is the name of the game now 

598.85 599.89 A: i think so ye-
