4.25 5.43 B: (( who am i speaking with )) 

4.88 7.05 A: oh uh dave from dayton 

6.86 8.11 B: hi [laughter] 

7.41 8.56 A: hi how are you 

8.17 15.57 B: i'm doing great i'm really excited about today's topic 'cause i'm actually a public school teacher but i kinda wanted to hear your comments first [laughter] 

9.19 10.23 A: good 

12.46 13.56 A: oh you are 

14.94 16.76 A: oh sure um 

16.77 21.82 A: well here in dayton and uh a small of where i'm from which is close to dayton 

21.85 27.39 A: they're kinda having some problems with the public schools in dayton much more than uh the smaller town troy 

27.55 36.59 A: in the fact that you really have a two tier school system and it's simply um you've got the public schools which in dayton are rancid um 

37.00 41.44 A: i wouldn't send my worst any kid there you know um 

40.71 41.49 B: right 

41.84 43.13 A: and in troy 

43.18 48.85 A: uh which is the suburb where there is money you know the schools are good but they're not what they were 

48.83 52.08 A: say for twenty years ago because 

51.92 64.23 A: a uh school system called troy christian um opened up uh that the city of troy's really been budding quite well uh a lot of the money's moved in there like upper class homes are there and the city never really 

64.08 69.44 A: um updated its schools to accommodate all that growth so troy christian 

69.50 75.35 A: which used to be really a a christian based school has really budded into 

75.38 77.34 A: not so much a um 

77.67 83.80 A: christian oriented school which it still is but more of a um elitist school you know for lack of a better word 

83.46 84.75 B: mhm 

84.18 85.33 A: and um 

85.48 89.36 A: you know the kids that are coming out of there are just incredible you know um 

90.10 93.16 A: as far as um academics and all that 

93.35 96.57 A: better athletes better everything to be honest with you 

96.74 107.85 A: and um th- the troy school system itself is experiencing a um talent drain you could ca- almost call it the students that are going to troy christian uh from their football team that used to be 

107.94 110.75 A: you know top notch in the region to one that's 

110.76 118.79 A: mediocre now you know to uh just there are standings under uh state testing and all that so 

118.50 121.44 B: and this you think this is because of the the money disparity 

122.71 123.53 A: (( um )) 

123.38 125.97 A: no i i i won- i won't say that because 

125.81 138.66 A: um there's a lot of articles in the paper about the school system and they showed us salaries of the teachers and all that you know the benefits and all that because you know if you work for the state how can you beat that you know 

137.72 138.59 B: right 

138.55 145.90 A: um the as far as like cash spent per student it was three times as much in the public schools 

145.99 148.74 A: you know as to what's being spent on the uh 

148.78 150.97 A: students in the private school 

150.30 151.20 B: right 

151.05 151.93 A: um 

152.32 158.21 A: i don't think enough can be said of adult you know parent input you know 

158.21 171.48 A: uh it it only takes one apple to ruin a bushel we all know that um and dayton more than troy is dealing with that um as as far as problems with that but troy has a few of them itself um 

158.25 159.45 B: (( right yeah )) 

162.21 163.06 B: right 

171.68 175.65 A: but better management you know 

175.26 176.31 B: mhm 

175.71 183.40 A: uh better administration people who care more um i would say it's harder to get into troy christian almost you know as long as you 

183.71 192.30 A: have the teaching certificate um you can hop into troy district you know and dayton easily uh whereas 

190.53 191.52 B: right 

192.39 206.20 A: with uh troy christian um they might lo- look for maybe for like an english major or a chemistry major or something like that from um a a level bible college you know 

204.86 205.96 B: right 

206.24 217.53 A: and uh they're just killing them you know tha- that's the best way to put it and as they continue to grow of course more money gets poured into it 'cause they can jack tuition up more 'cause it's more elitist you know [laughter] 

216.91 223.44 B: right [laughter] that makes sense i know uh we have a program in texas called robin hood i don't know if you've heard of it 

222.82 224.03 A: uh called what oh 

223.54 225.74 B: robin hood the robin hood plan 

225.36 226.22 A: (( uh )) 

225.85 238.07 B: um it's a it's named for a plan they take from our richer public schools um we actually give money to the poorer public schools um within the area to kinda even everything out 

230.37 231.21 A: mhm 

234.22 235.11 A: okay 

237.64 238.47 A: sure 

238.32 253.06 B: but that doesn't necessarily work either we've had lots of repercussions where then everybody ends up being [laughter] low instead of everybody ending up being high which is and so they're they're talking about changing that in the legislature and actually um right now they're 

240.87 241.73 A: no 

253.08 258.79 B: we're going to a legislative session where they're changing all kinds of things even um like you were talking about the 

258.93 265.30 B: how to get more teachers because there's such a teacher shortage um letting teachers um get their certificates more easily 

260.46 261.31 A: (( [mn] right )) 

264.98 266.11 A: mhm 

265.49 269.72 B: not having to take education courses but maybe just passing a test and then you can get your certificate 

269.45 272.73 A: mm yeah i think that's good and um i i don't want to 

273.16 284.80 A: thog you out or anything right but i think some of the worst teachers uh come from educational backgrounds you know and just as i think some of the worst accountants you know what i mean [laughter] uh have accounting degrees you 

274.63 275.42 B: mhm 

284.52 285.35 B: right 

284.72 290.52 A: know just just look at enron you know n._c._i. and all that that speaks miles of itself um 

289.29 290.23 B: right 

290.90 302.81 A: there really has to be like a passion you know i think some of your greatest teachers and so so the biggest tower out there are people who have been in the business you know for um 

303.30 307.77 A: say twenty years and and this is in your higher education like high school um 

305.78 306.61 B: mhm 

307.84 308.88 A: who uh 

309.20 323.32 A: can go in the classrooms and and a they want to be there or else they'd be in an industry making more money um and have something to to pass onto the kids so that there's a a definite willingness on their part 

314.42 315.24 B: right 

322.90 327.40 B: well i think that could definitely happen and and i i mean personally i had 

327.28 330.12 B: education classes so i mean i 

329.98 338.16 B: i'm all for them but i um a lot of my colleagues say that their education classes are worthless and didn't really teach them anything that that helped them in the classroom 

337.94 345.72 B: um we have a teacher this year that actually had been in the industry the graphic arts industry for about fifteen years and then decided 

342.39 343.58 A: (( mm mhm )) 

345.77 348.70 B: her friends works at the school and decided she'd start teaching 

348.98 360.81 B: absolutely hated it she won't she won't be back next year [laughter] i i think it's this i don't think i think it maybe if she would of had to do even five or six weeks of just being in the classroom before 

350.53 351.52 A: oh really 

351.91 353.03 A: (( yeah huh )) 

353.35 353.97 A: (( mm )) 

360.34 363.07 A: sure if job shared with them or something something like that yeah 

360.68 364.27 B: she actually started working there she would of realized that immediately 

363.89 365.05 A: yeah 

364.45 368.11 B: and so i mean if there is some such sort of training program 

368.13 375.54 A: i i there's legislation out there now and i don't and i'm probably speaking wrong but wha- what's it called no child left behind 

374.97 375.88 B: right yes 

375.56 382.10 A: and i don't know who started that bush okay and i i think that's good you know um 'cause 

376.92 377.94 B: bush 

382.26 387.59 A: if you do graduate col- you know from from high school you know or elementary school or whatever 

387.97 390.39 A: you should be able to do certain things 

390.45 391.35 B: (( right mhm )) 

390.75 396.66 A: you know and um i i was a slow learner there's no denying that 'cause you have well at least in troy 

396.69 410.70 A: you had three levels of classes you had the kids who had like learning disabilities and you had the kids that were a step above that and you had the academic classes and then you had like your advanced academic classes and um 

406.36 407.17 B: right 

411.74 414.21 A: sure you know we can't 

414.64 426.67 A: you can't turn schools into mcdonalds where every kid's you know exactly like a big mac you know what i mean they're all exactly the same and that's the last thing the world needs is that carbon copies of everybody but there are certain standards you know 

419.17 420.08 B: right 

426.85 432.84 A: uh what do they say the illiteracy the uh illiteracy rate is higher today than it was 

433.08 434.50 A: a hundred years ago 

434.07 434.93 B: right 

434.59 436.22 A: now how can that be progress 

436.02 442.91 B: yeah well i i i agree that that testing can work sometimes and that we should have standards that 

437.06 437.88 A: (( you know )) 

442.81 449.29 B: that kids should be able to know certain things before they are out of high school that there are things that they should know 

447.23 448.15 A: right 

449.17 462.02 B: i think part of the problem that we as teachers feel there's no child left behind is that it's mandated by the federal government and they've i mean it there's a huge amount um i haven't even read all the things all the rules that i'm supposed to be [laughter] following at this point 

461.51 462.52 A: yeah 

461.90 474.69 B: but um but we know that there's all that legislation there it's an unfunded mandate by the government they say do this it'll be great and it'll help everybody but we're not going to pay any money toward this task 

467.10 468.06 A: mhm 

474.46 475.35 A: yeah 

474.76 480.94 B: and so the school systems are trying to have to come up with that money on their own and of course everybody's having trouble financially 

480.56 484.70 A: oh sure who isn't yeah you know uh do you know the questions you 

481.26 482.06 B: so 

482.37 483.15 B: so 

484.88 488.27 A: you know the they're so i'm thirty four right now 

488.36 492.29 A: now as a kid growing up i remember boy i was just scared to death i wouldn't pass 

492.15 506.34 A: you know to third grade or fourth grade and you know they they'd post uh at the end of the summer who your next teacher was and if you passed you know and you you know you'd run up to the school window and take a look you know i passed thank god you know [laughter] um maybe if 

494.20 495.19 B: mhm 

499.15 499.97 B: right 

506.36 511.49 A: there wasn't such a negative stigmata you know on failing you know 'cause 

510.64 511.47 B: right 

511.64 521.10 A: it is that the beginning of a downward spiral for that child you know and say at third grade you know you you're labelled a mcdonald's worker as a lifer um 

517.08 518.05 B: mhm 

521.72 528.79 A: you know or maybe summer schools you know for students that didn't pass you know in we're looking more one on one 

526.35 527.15 B: right 

528.80 541.19 A: and all that and i don't maybe the kids that are having troubles are often kids whose parents aren't you know as active in their education uh 'cause of working two jobs just to get by and 

539.88 543.15 B: right and i definit- i mean i work in a low income school and that 

542.92 555.68 B: we definitely see the effects of that i mean we had an assembly for um the academic awards all the kids that that did really well this year in their grades and we have seven hundred and fifty students in the school maybe a hundred parents showed 

544.52 545.23 A: (( yeah mm )) 

555.50 557.34 A: yeah oh that's not right yeah 

556.71 561.45 B: so i mean it's yeah it's definitely a problem of of socio economics 

560.82 562.16 A: yeah and you 

562.53 565.20 A: it you know maybe our schools should be 

565.74 575.25 A: and there's no way they wan- i know they don't want to do this you know you don't drop your kid off at the school as a baby sitter you know but if the kids who are having trouble 

575.32 588.60 A: go to summer school you know what i mean to speed them up to the fourth grade if they're coming from the third grade and chances are you know those will be the kids that are of lower economics it would be a win win situation for everybody 

577.07 578.70 B: (( mhm right mhm )) 

588.04 589.13 B: right 

588.47 596.07 A: 'cause if the kid's at home by himself like a latchkey kid which supposedly that's not supposed to be allowed but of course it happens um 

594.75 595.81 B: right 

596.55 599.95 A: the parents would benefit society would benefit because we'd be you'd prod-
