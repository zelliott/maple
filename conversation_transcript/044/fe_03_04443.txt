6.83 8.74 B: always good how are ya doing 

8.23 9.63 A: not too bad thank you 

9.23 11.52 B: well this is my first time so 

11.28 12.79 A: oh i see 

12.04 15.16 B: [laughter] it sounds like we've got a good topic 

13.13 14.66 A: i've done it a couple of times 

15.01 16.26 A: yeah 

15.68 23.59 B: but i'm not i'm not sure enough about the nitty gritty stuff but i think there's a few things that i could talk about what about you 

23.41 28.67 A: uh yeah i think so um i definitely think we have problems [laughter] 

24.77 25.81 B: okay 

26.94 29.96 B: yeah well why don't you start first [laughter] 

29.54 34.80 A: well i'm not sure [mn] i think it's a major problem actually i don't know if this one um 

35.18 45.93 A: 'bout forty and uh it just doesn't seem like that when i went to school that we had any of the problems uh when i say any you know yeah we had a few fights here and there and so forth 

44.64 45.80 B: yeah 

46.42 51.17 A: but just none of the difficulties that are kids are having nowadays i guess you know 

50.56 55.44 B: yeah what do you think it's different in the smaller schools opposed to bigger schools 

55.76 60.71 A: yeah probably i would think somewhat but you know again i i uh 

60.89 69.15 A: i i think even the smaller schools are having problems you know and with uh i i think drugs probably added a whole lot to it 

63.56 64.73 B: yeah 

68.81 74.21 B: yeah and i'm sure there were those when i was growing up but i don't i didn't know that they were going on 

73.69 74.85 A: sure 

74.17 84.07 B: and i was from a very very very small school and so and my my children go to a five a. school so i've seen quite a bit of difference from what i 

76.71 77.82 A: okay 

84.45 87.15 B: went through as to opposed to now 

86.81 88.01 A: right 

87.52 90.56 B: from the small but i think it's because it was a small school 

90.50 92.84 A: now y- your kids go now to where now 

92.48 94.21 B: uh a five a. school 

93.72 94.97 A: what's that 

94.38 103.78 B: uh it's the larger school in texas yeah they're yeah we had a i was in a b. school and then they have the a.'s one a. two a. three a. four a. five a 

96.41 97.29 A: oh 

97.40 98.62 A: i got ya 

103.43 104.81 A: oh okay 

104.06 108.70 B: so the five a. is uh we've got about twenty seven hundred kids in high school 

108.42 109.31 A: okay 

109.17 114.73 B: so it's um i think that ma- makes a little difference but i think the time has made the difference too 

114.40 115.48 A: right 

114.84 121.16 B: because i'm older and i look back and i didn't see that much going on in school i just was naive i guess 

121.83 125.46 B: to what you know what the problems were but 

124.96 128.52 A: i was actually into quite a few things when i went to school but uh 

129.42 134.34 A: [laughter] i guess it's not what they're doing now you know um 

129.84 130.40 B: (( [mn] )) 

132.66 133.78 B: yeah 

133.83 135.03 B: yeah 

134.35 136.64 A: yeah i know i know when i was you know 

136.68 138.98 A: junior high and high school so on and so forth 

139.21 149.49 A: oh i probably spent a little bit of my [laughter] i mean so i wasn't a perfect kid by any stretch of the imagination but you know i mean again we didn't go out 

141.53 144.31 B: [laughter] 

146.34 147.28 B: (( oh yeah )) 

149.54 157.43 A: i mean yeah and you know got into a few fights here and there and but that was about it you know we didn't kill each other [laughter] 

156.13 165.91 B: yeah w- yeah you though we didn't have the worry of guns and things like that you know for 'em to go to school worry about their life you know if something like that was gonna happen 

163.85 165.12 A: sure 

166.10 173.79 B: but i'm i'm kinda concerned about as far as the education part of it also it just seems like 'cause both my 

173.73 187.08 B: sons have already graduated from high school and they're in college now and my daughter's headed to high school next year and i'm just so concerned about how these kids they're getting through school but they're making them take all these 

179.99 181.06 A: mhm 

187.36 191.41 B: awful subjects that they don't even won't ever use again one day 

190.93 191.86 A: right 

191.47 195.62 B: and they can't even balance a checkbook so they can't do anything 

195.68 199.10 B: that normal people do 'cause not everybody's a graduate 

199.28 211.22 B: you know all twenty seven hundred kids are not gonna go into college and they're not gonna be doing those big big jobs that's gonna require the things that they are trying to get 'em to do and 

208.54 209.74 A: sure 

211.41 214.66 B: i just wish that they would go back to some of the basics 

214.33 216.49 A: right right well yeah 

215.42 217.49 B: 'cause that's kinda what i've been having 

217.77 225.46 B: kinda my my problem with things now because my sons are in college and they're doing fine but it's you know there's other kids too 

225.04 226.20 A: mhm 

225.61 236.60 B: and and a lot of 'em don't wanna go to college and they've been forced to take all these high math classes and stuff that they can't even understand when they're in high school 

237.10 243.02 B: and they get out there in the world and they can't can't take care of the the normal things that you have to do so 

242.15 243.91 A: yeah normal life skills 

243.57 245.10 B: yeah yeah 

243.95 247.05 A: yeah i understand where you're coming from there that's 

246.81 247.77 B: [noise] 

247.47 253.32 A: yeah i i haven't had uh lots of i've got a twenty one year old that lives in texas [laughter] so that's good 

252.95 254.34 B: oh really 

253.69 256.62 A: yeah yeah stevensville 

256.15 258.86 B: stevensville and is that close to dallas 

256.92 267.18 A: yeah uh actually yeah it's about uh thirty miles what would it be nor- or i'm sorry southwest of actually fortworth 

266.85 275.71 B: yeah okay yeah 'cause like we get the dallas channels here so i see that sometime on my radar i thought that sounded familiar stevensville yeah 

273.41 279.94 A: stevensville yeah yeah so yeah he's been down there about he he went to i believe he went to texas a. and m 

279.40 288.78 B: well that's where my older son he's a senior at a. and m. texas a. and m. and uh college station and my other son's at bland college the junior college there so 

288.08 289.25 A: mhm

297.12 307.81 B: yeah well that's a good school i really i was very impressed i didn't ever think i would care about it but but the problem with a. and m. is that you know i mean you got 

297.66 299.04 A: (( [lipsmack] but )) 

308.03 314.60 B: i mean it's a hard school it's a very hard school and that's why uh my husband said well if you get a degree from a. and m. 

309.55 312.09 A: yeah oh sure mhm 

314.72 328.17 B: they'll take you about anywhere and any time i mean you're the first one 'cause they know you've had a good education and it it is very it is difficult you know unless you just a brain of a kid that can just you know whiz through everything and 

320.05 320.97 A: right 

327.39 328.45 A: right 

328.21 334.86 B: uh mine aren't unfortunately they have to study [laughter] but it is hard 

331.66 333.88 A: yeah yeah 

334.17 340.17 A: yeah mine's pretty smart he he ended up getting a full right scholarship though from uh for athletics though so 

339.21 341.01 B: oh i see 

340.43 346.43 A: yeah he was lucky in that uh he had the texas state record for triple jump of all things [laughter] 

346.05 347.21 B: (( wow )) 

346.62 351.88 A: yeah i don't know how he did that well he did so 

348.93 350.54 B: [laughter] 

350.79 354.12 B: yeah well that's good yeah 

352.30 354.88 A: (( yeah so it was kinda interesting but )) 

354.74 361.06 B: but he he enjoys it and uh has he said anything about the school as far as education or 

354.92 355.83 A: yeah 

360.65 374.05 A: [lipsmack] to be honest with ya i haven't talked with to him for years yeah him and him and or my mother or his mother and i split up years ago and uh nope haven't haven't heard from him for [mn] gosh about seven eight years 

363.47 364.16 B: (( oh )) 

373.79 376.67 B: [noise] oh oh oh okay 

374.42 376.27 A: yeah so 

376.76 381.45 A: i just know a little bit about what he's doing so i try to keep track of that but no 

378.69 379.85 B: yeah 

380.20 381.24 B: yeah 

381.38 383.39 B: well that's good if you can that's 

382.74 391.33 A: yeah i i try to do the best i can on that and then uh but and i've got a three year old little girl now and then i've got a twelve year old boy so um 

385.10 386.05 B: yeah 

390.84 394.55 B: well w- where your kids go now do they have to wear a uniform 

394.35 395.52 A: (( no [noise] )) 

394.82 400.59 B: at their school well this is the first year that my daughter did in eighth grade and it just was 

400.72 407.02 B: made us feel like we were in russia you know they didn't give us the option to to decide whether our 

403.79 405.06 A: right 

407.25 420.28 B: uh middle school kids would wear 'em or not wear 'em they just said this has been decided and and and nobody that i was talking to was too happy about it now we did find some that thought it was wonderful 

411.83 414.18 A: they will wear them [laughter] 

417.09 418.16 A: sure 

419.86 420.87 A: right 

420.30 426.15 B: but they said for safety reasons that that would be better to see 'em all in like kinda the same colors and 

426.04 438.39 B: um that another middle school there were only two middle schools left that had not got the uniforms and they said if one did the other one would and but i felt that that was not good the school system should've given parents 

430.95 432.39 A: right 

438.28 450.39 B: a say in what their kids were gonna do or not gonna do and and even with the public school we pay taxes you know don't just say well next year your kids will be wearing khaki pants and certain color shirts 

440.99 442.09 A: right 

444.04 445.29 A: sure sure 

449.94 452.75 A: right well not to mention 

451.07 453.50 B: and just put 'em into the mold 

452.83 457.79 A: r- right and you know not to mention some families can't afford that type of stuff but then i guess it does 

457.83 471.71 A: go against the well 'cause you know traditionally that's another big problem too is where some kids can afford a whole lotta you know the hundred dollar tennis shoes and then so there's always been a real class problem with that i think too you know so i don't know 

465.63 466.72 B: mhm 

471.44 475.54 B: yeah well they said all the stuff you know about it but we 

475.51 484.17 B: you know we felt like it wasn't really that much of a problem it just became because everybody else did it then we were gonna do it too and 

478.81 479.99 A: right 

483.31 484.41 A: right 

484.14 495.27 B: and then it changes elementary they don't have to wear 'em then high school they don't have to wear 'em so you just pick those three years to change and that's the most formative years for the kids they're going through a lot of changes and 

494.29 495.67 A: yeah 

495.12 509.57 B: and then they have to wear their shirts tucked in some girls are odd shapes and don't want you know they want to wear 'em out and you know we went over and over all this kinda stuff and and nobody really seemed to care and i think that that was a 

500.96 502.39 A: oh right 

509.62 518.42 B: a bad mark on public schools you know they had a lot of 'em said well we'll just go to a private school where we can there there is one in town that doesn't require a uniform 

511.17 512.20 A: (( oh sure )) 

518.03 519.37 A: right 

518.87 522.28 B: and so we heard all that but that's that's probably my 

522.92 526.92 B: my biggie against the public school [laughter] this this past year 

526.58 531.81 A: right well i think they should get get the parents more involved again so 

527.71 528.61 B: but 

530.99 540.00 B: well if we had of voted then we'd have lost at that time because in elementary they gave us an opportunity to talk about it when it first came into the school system 

539.94 550.20 B: and uh our particular elementary voted not to do it the parents had a say we got to write letters and they when they realized the majority of the parents didn't wanna do it 

545.26 546.13 A: mhm 

549.65 550.59 A: right 

550.17 558.58 B: and so we didn't do it but now you know you get to middle school and then they say this is what you're gonna do and you don't have any say in the matter 

558.13 559.41 A: right 

560.02 561.69 B: i weren't too pleased 

561.36 565.47 A: [lipsmack] yeah well to be honest with ya i think another big problem with 

565.54 571.78 A: schools and this is kinda related more uh is that the parents in the kids' lives 

572.20 577.69 A: you know and i 'cause i i suffer all that all the time with uh 'cause my twelve year old his mother 

578.37 591.76 A: yeah his mother and i aren't together either but i get zero you know report cards zero anything school related and it's just you know yeah he's got a step dad but well yeah does that make up for 

584.85 585.72 B: mm 

591.74 599.85 A: you know what i the values i try to install in him and uh which basically i'm not allowed to do and so i think that you know the single parent families 

594.64 595.78 B: mhm
