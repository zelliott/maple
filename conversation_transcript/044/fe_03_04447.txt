10.20 16.14 B: [noise] oh really and i'm in uh byron 

11.42 13.36 A: yeah i'm in oak river 

16.06 17.25 A: where's that 

16.26 21.03 B: it's about ten miles uh west of rochester 

20.73 23.34 A: very good well nice to talk to you [lipsmack] 

21.60 22.37 B: so 

22.85 24.12 B: nice talking to you 

24.67 27.83 B: [sigh] well what do ya think on public schools 

27.49 38.64 A: um i think they're obsolete outdated and they're failing and [lipsmack] they don't match what i went to school with and therefore i'm uh 

38.73 48.27 A: in favor of scraping them and giving vouchers and letting the citizens of this state and this country decide how they want their children educated to put it in a nutshell 

46.77 47.70 B: i guess 

48.29 61.78 B: i uh i'm actually in favor of vouchers and stuff too where that way we can choose what we wanna do but um you know we we just moved to byron and um the public schools here are excellent you know i haven't 

54.32 55.16 A: yes 

60.92 62.58 A: mhm 

61.94 67.63 B: i haven't found anything wrong um they kept us very informed 

67.43 68.50 A: mhm 

67.91 73.87 B: um the kids are you know doing well on their tests and all that stuff and uh 

74.13 81.68 B: so i think of it depends on exactly what public school system you get into you know and um 

80.48 83.04 A: mhm well i'm sure a great deal of it does uh 

83.11 88.77 A: but overall the the the failure of the system to provide equitable education 

89.30 92.04 A: uh and competency uh 

92.44 97.58 A: uh is is is sadly lacking and holding 

97.42 107.95 A: uh i believe h- holding children hostage well to the n. e. a. and all these other organizations is is criminal uh if you have 

107.97 116.70 A: a good public school where you're at and you're satisfied your kids are getting what you feel they need and that then then um i'm really happy for ya 

116.34 124.50 B: right oh i know that you know it's you know since obviously since i was in school and i'm i'm only thirty four but 

117.75 118.42 A: uh 

124.32 125.88 A: okay i'm fifty two 

124.46 132.09 B: since i was in school you know pardon me you're fifty two okay i mean and and since you know a 

127.25 128.61 A: i'm fifty two 

132.35 136.49 B: a lot has changed even since i've been in high school and what not too so 

135.17 135.99 A: mhm 

136.52 137.84 B: it's um 

137.83 142.27 B: you know i i don't know if if it's our society 

142.22 146.63 B: you know um [mn] just the the simple things as far as 

146.59 152.37 B: you know it seems like the teachers haven't can't have any control over the students because if they 

152.32 157.46 B: spank them or whatever the case may be or put 'em in a corner or something it seems like you've got 

156.37 157.36 A: exactly 

157.36 172.54 B: you know someone breathing down your back saying you can't do this and you do that you know and i think our society is is a little bit to blame for the public school system too in the sense that it's it's strayed so far away from 

160.31 160.99 A: (( yes )) 

162.91 163.96 A: well i 

172.54 175.59 B: what it used to be i guess is what the way i'll put it 

175.20 188.76 A: yeah well i i f- i strongly believe that when uh madeline mary o'hare got god kicked out the schools [lipsmack] back in nineteen sixty three you can mark the d- decline of public education at that point 

182.46 184.00 B: yeah 

186.11 187.10 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

187.69 190.85 B: right right 

188.82 190.63 A: and um 

191.13 196.62 A: and that's that's my op- i in fact i home school now i do not have kids in public school and uh 

192.15 196.09 B: yep you do okay 

196.54 203.50 A: i pay double i mean i pay for the private and public education i i feel strongly about it uh 

200.42 201.32 B: okay 

203.41 208.02 A: not that i not that i uh have to sit 'em in school and pray every day 

207.75 209.69 B: right 

207.93 222.63 A: or that that excludes 'em but at the same time i feel that that the values that they're being taught uh the like you say teachers are being asked to be what they never were they're not they're not social workers they're not they're not supposed to be disciplinarians they're supposed to be educators 

209.84 211.68 B: right 

219.61 220.43 B: no 

222.00 223.70 B: right 

222.64 236.65 A: uh i feel that then uh that um people like me have been excluded from the mainstream and been uh a- assaulted and affronted and therefore uh violated and i still could not look at myself in the mirror 

229.02 231.15 B: right 

233.24 234.09 B: (( yes )) 

237.03 238.04 A: uh 

238.19 239.71 A: and and 

239.80 250.19 A: if i did not do what i thought was right and the best i could for my my children and so i made the decision that my children like i said i felt they're being held hostage and i could not leave them in that situation 

242.82 245.40 B: (( [noise] right )) 

248.11 249.76 B: right 

249.70 263.53 B: right oh i and you know i agree i have actually a sister that's a teacher you know and and she says she says she says she has absolutely very little time to teach because she is she is being the parent in the school now because 

254.56 255.93 A: mhm 

260.31 261.42 A: exactly 

263.53 269.16 B: you know we have both people working or we have so many broken marriages throughout the system that 

267.30 269.49 A: mhm mhm 

269.06 279.86 B: you know she ends up she ends up being a mother more than she ends up being a teacher and you know y- you are you you can't get a lot done when you're put into those type of circumstances so 

273.37 274.21 A: (( mhm right )) 

279.08 292.41 A: yeah the the the public school system cannot substitute for the parents or the home or the family that's been found out they thought they could with all this new psychobabble and p. c. that they come up with for thirty years and now they're the 

282.93 284.25 B: exactly 

284.82 286.45 B: exactly 

289.52 292.78 B: right right 

292.25 306.34 A: the uh ethnicity that is is not there and it's it's uh terrible um [lipsmack] i um feel strongly about it um in fact i strong enough that i vote and i vote along one or two lines of the main issues and one of them is education 

294.37 297.58 B: right right 

299.20 301.17 B: right 

303.85 305.54 B: right 

305.79 307.43 B: yep 

306.38 317.86 A: i get tired of our state you're in minnesota and all you hear is more and more money for education more and more money for education and i wanna stand up and scream what more are ya gonna teach them that you're not teaching them now 

308.33 310.06 B: yep 

310.77 314.03 B: right right 

315.46 317.25 B: right 

317.46 319.22 B: right 

317.98 321.14 A: uh you know i think for the money you have right now 

321.21 329.66 A: teach them what you're supposed to teach them i don't know why you keep clambering for more and more for what show me what you need uh i 

323.07 324.74 B: right 

326.16 327.59 B: yep 

327.72 329.97 B: yep well i 

329.79 333.15 A: i don't get in that debate much anymore because i do it at home 

332.59 334.36 B: right 

333.24 338.92 A: i found out one of the first things i've been home schooling for five years and one first things i found frank was that 

336.96 338.67 B: (( okay yep )) 

339.31 346.64 A: the amount of time just waste waste in the public schools is because of of what we did our home curriculum compared to theirs 

342.65 344.29 B: yep 

346.43 348.06 B: (( isn't )) 

346.57 356.37 A: my son did his sixth grade schoolwork in under five months and that not with any great pressure or anything that was going from eight in the morning 'til noon 

351.63 353.83 B: (( that amazing )) 

354.13 355.83 B: right 

355.88 360.25 B: yep isn't that amazing oh i i completely agree i mean i 

356.39 358.07 A: in the home environment 

360.45 372.66 B: you know i my wife and i actually did consider home schooling and stuff but um we have five little ones and it's you know it takes a lot of patience to be able to home school you know 

369.65 370.24 A: (( mhm )) 

370.26 379.70 A: it's a dedication it it isn't for everybody but at the same time it's for a lot more people than they imagined it it is a great option it's a great viable thing 

373.47 375.22 B: right 

375.72 380.29 B: right right right right 

379.64 388.89 A: uh i encourage it but i don't i'm not gonna say it's the only way to go if you are active parents concerned like you sound like you are and you involved 

381.28 382.98 B: right 

383.18 384.77 B: (( oh definitely )) 

386.11 390.01 B: right right right 

388.85 396.65 A: and you and you advocate for your kids then you can get a a good education i i still believe that but i don't a along with the other stuff that goes in there 

390.90 393.30 B: yep right 

394.00 395.94 B: you know and 

396.71 398.96 A: uh it's terrible 

396.77 397.70 B: (( but i )) 

398.28 401.98 B: right i mean i think a lot of it you know even both my wife and i if we 

402.25 415.23 B: if we both wanted to go into the workforce or what not i mean we could've been making upwards of six figures between the two of us and but that's not something that we want to do you know we chose to have a family and we chose to raise them and 

408.17 410.30 A: sure i'm a stay at home dad 

412.19 413.08 A: (( no mm )) 

415.16 419.44 B: you know and and it's neat because since moving to byron it's kinda interesting that uh 

415.45 416.20 A: mhm 

419.34 429.10 B: you know there seems to be a lot of areas to volunteer the school system they encourage the families to come in and eat lunches with the school with the kids and you know 

424.40 425.33 A: mhm 

427.35 428.67 A: mhm 

428.91 434.94 B: you know it's it i think it is i think it's hit and miss depending on what school district you actually get into 

434.09 444.50 A: well i believe there is a great deal you know not all school districts are created equal if you look here at at the city of minneapolis have spent upwards of ninety five hundred dollars a year per student 

435.07 435.96 B: you know 

438.12 439.86 B: right 

444.50 445.70 B: jeeze 

444.59 446.28 A: and then the abysmal 

446.36 457.91 A: the absolutely pathetic results they get you know i wanna go to legislature and say hey i pay i pay three thousands outta my own pocket i give you four times the product give me back that money 

446.59 448.22 B: (( yeah )) 

448.86 450.48 B: yeah 

452.20 456.70 B: [laughter] 

457.32 459.49 B: yeah oh definitely 

458.01 470.89 A: and i'm skeptical when you see every other commercial is for sylvan learning centers or these other ed- alternative education centers and i'm going well then that's where i should be sending my children and that's where apparently the period are getting educated and not in the schools 

461.94 463.68 B: yeah 

464.61 466.27 B: (( yeah )) 

467.14 468.95 B: right 

469.24 471.88 B: yeah yeah 

470.94 479.24 A: and i bet in byron it's probably as small as a little small community a little tighter bond and you've probably got the best that you can get right now and and i'm really happy for ya 

473.33 475.52 B: right definitely 

477.08 478.42 B: (( right [lipsmack] )) 

479.01 480.80 B: right 

479.29 482.57 A: but but you have to advocate stay on top of it for your children 

481.93 485.28 B: right well we had moved from uh we had moved from austin 

485.05 485.96 A: (( and okay )) 

485.34 497.03 B: and uh you know like i said our kids are young and stuff but you know we actually did not do the public school system down there we actually chose to send 'em to um a private catholic school so 

496.45 500.61 A: that's very good i i i do uh part time too at a at 

497.46 498.34 B: um 

500.64 502.16 A: an academy here 

501.65 503.41 B: yeah 

502.62 513.34 A: simply because i can't offer some of what they offer like biology and like a second language and that my one boy's in tenth grade but uh i'm a stay at home dad frank i i left my job 

505.89 507.22 B: right

546.37 548.16 B: right 

549.22 550.14 B: okay 

549.77 558.08 A: and so one of us had had to be around twenty four seven and and it just happened that she now got this opportunity and this happened but uh

558.48 569.97 A: yeah i i give you all the credit in the world it's it's um it's a different it's a different thing to do but you do it for your children and god's gonna grant a lot of you're gonna get best for that 

559.22 561.12 B: [laughter]

576.02 588.27 B: you know i don't know if i could quite go ahead and do the home schooling type thing but um just because of my you know i mean i have patience but i don't know if i have that much patience and like you say you have to be dedicated to it and all that so 

580.20 581.00 A: well 

588.51 594.01 A: if if you if you have discipline and dedication you can you can buy the curriculums and let me tell ya anybody can do it
