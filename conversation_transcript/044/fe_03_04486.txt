1.62 2.81 B: (( hello )) 

3.03 4.54 A: my name is colette 

4.50 6.29 B: hi my name is mike 

7.56 11.36 A: so i ho- i hope you have kids in school for your honesty in the topic 

11.70 14.28 B: well my wife was a former school teacher 

14.04 17.03 A: oh then you know lots of problems in schools 

17.12 18.68 B: are you a school teacher 

18.42 21.11 A: no i'm not but i i volunteer at school 

20.96 23.10 B: oh so you have children at school 

22.50 24.34 A: (( yeah )) 

23.68 24.37 B: (( okay )) 

25.79 30.21 A: and we just changed schools because of the violence in ours 

30.31 32.40 B: oh the violence where do you live 

32.14 36.38 A: i live in florida o- outside of tallahassee area 

33.57 34.42 B: oh 

35.99 37.36 B: oh that's nice 

37.07 45.42 A: and it got so bad at the school and they were doing nothing about it and i have twin kindergarteners that we ended up changing to a charter school 

49.30 50.82 B: that sounds we- 

50.83 55.43 B: well so th- the violence is a problem in the schools then where you live 

55.05 55.97 A: yes 

56.64 63.32 A: not as bad as you know some of the bigger cities but yeah it's getting to be bad and they're turning a blind eye to it 

63.75 66.56 B: how do you think you can improve it 

66.36 68.03 A: well i know with 

68.05 68.96 A: uh 

70.41 80.01 A: most of the violence we had problems with were on the bus and i think if they had two people on the buses with the kids one you know the driver of course and somebody that could handle the kids 'cause the drivers can't 

80.68 84.88 B: how could they af- you know it's just like with the schools they can't afford that they 

87.56 92.41 A: well we have extra money in our budget that's supposed to go for those things but it hasn't been lately 

92.59 94.61 B: that's a good idea 

95.84 96.86 B: um 

97.67 103.73 B: i think the way they can improve the schools is do what they do in japan they make the kids clean the schools 

104.22 106.44 A: that would be good 

106.69 108.84 B: 'cause um it teaches them uh 

110.00 111.36 B: discipline 

111.51 114.68 B: and to appreciate what you know the schools 

116.53 120.26 B: um i think too that they could go into te- teen teaching 

121.74 124.18 A: well see we have we have that here already 

124.12 137.75 B: oh we have it too i live in uh upstate new york and they have it but what i mean by teen teaching is they should have one math teacher one english one for each subject and then they could broadcast it to the other schools and then they could have 

126.96 127.87 A: oh okay 

138.45 142.32 B: teachers to help the children in each subject 

142.04 143.20 A: right 

145.43 148.12 B: they could lower the budget that way they could combine 

148.34 151.51 B: um superintendents and principals 

154.04 158.41 B: and uh in other words one one principal could run two schools 

158.75 160.24 B: and assistants 

158.88 159.91 A: right 

161.01 163.05 B: that would save money also 

163.93 170.58 A: well we've we just passed a bill in this state that just lowered class sizes so we're into building more schools 

171.67 172.93 B: florida 

172.48 174.33 A: yep 

173.41 176.98 B: well where i live the budget is short and the uh 

177.15 182.97 B: they just fired the superintendent because of he spent a lot of money on travelling 

183.16 183.83 A: (( oh )) 

184.53 198.26 A: well we have you know the lottery here which brings in more revenue towards schools and what they did unfortunately is they im- were supposed to supplement money wi- from the the lottery now they're taking it and the property taxes no longer pay for a school 

189.31 190.36 B: (( well we have a )) 

198.51 200.61 A: just the lottery pays for it 

201.09 212.70 B: well it should be that way in new york state but however they keep cutting the budget and um they cut i mean they keep cutting the taxes and cutting the budget they seem to have money for other things 

212.69 217.98 B: for instance they've just spent eight million dollars on a quick ferry between here and toronto 

219.21 223.16 B: they they came up thirty million short for the schools 

222.56 223.60 A: oh wow whew 

226.90 233.17 B: must a heard on the news that uh the government government of vetoed all the bills so 

233.30 236.08 B: they're gonna be short more money 

239.31 242.08 A: it's frightening how much it costs for schools that 

243.72 249.22 A: gotta be done you know what's if we don't educate them now we'll end up paying later for it 

248.45 255.65 B: oh but they seem to have money to build buildings but they don't have enough money to cut cut the classes and 

256.36 262.05 B: and uh because th- they could use more videos they could use more computers they could use um 

263.44 267.03 B: different system that that than what we have now 

266.81 268.32 A: yeah 

268.80 279.34 B: or su- you said there's violence in schools uh well where i live in rochester new york they cut out a lot of psychologists in the schools they cut out a lot of social workers 

280.35 281.55 B: (( and um )) 

281.98 284.07 B: the classes are too big 

284.15 290.67 B: and a lot of the the teachers cannot uh control the class or th- or that's mainly their 

290.75 293.51 B: job is to control the class they're so big 

296.85 300.61 A: yeah it's that's well that's one of the reasons they need them smaller here 

301.04 307.81 A: you know and well of course we switched our kids all over to charter school where there's only ten children per grade 

308.99 312.15 B: more individual attention is it there in the schools 

312.02 319.03 A: yeah it's so much that not only that but in this particular school they have a teacher and a teacher's aide per classroom 

320.16 324.77 A: and in this area they cut most of the teachers' aides in the in the lower grades 

325.14 327.54 A: and then they cut our 

327.79 333.79 A: science i they cut the science they cut the art they cut the music they cut the p._e. 

334.00 336.62 A: where they only have those one day a week 

336.89 340.62 B: yeah they and they don't have that in the charter school do they the art 

339.87 342.13 A: well in the charter school they get that every day 

343.24 347.28 B: but you you pay for it it's like a private school is it 

346.64 347.49 A: huh 

347.41 348.09 B: oh 

348.10 352.37 B: well the the state funds it uh funds the charter schools also right 

351.02 354.18 A: yes yes the state funds these these are public 

354.63 358.46 B: public schools or so you have vouchers then and then but 

357.82 367.67 A: ah this the one we're on aren't through vouchers we live in a smaller area that you know all you have to do is get your child into it and be one of the ten 

369.95 372.82 B: they must have a big waiting list though don't they 

372.76 373.76 A: well 

373.97 376.28 A: we went up there 

377.01 382.82 A: couple days after we had the problems at the school and went and talked to the charter school and they put our children in immediately so 

384.57 388.52 A: we lucked out in the grade that our kids were all in they had openings 

388.67 390.65 B: (( that's great )) 

391.28 394.08 B: you think they should have more charter schools or 

393.50 396.34 A: i think the way this school is yeah they should 

397.16 399.66 A: it it's it's so much better 

400.90 403.48 A: yeah with small classes plus they're getting 

404.05 410.27 A: [mn] the education with the the emphasis emphasis on education is so much better than at the public school 

410.57 414.52 A: you know they're they're reading more at the school they're they're doing things well 

415.51 418.02 A: it it's not as 

419.06 421.00 A: (( i don't want to say structured )) 

422.11 424.03 A: but it's not as as 

426.32 437.86 A: [sigh] i can't think of the word i want to use the they they teach more they're able to get ha- more hands on and they don't have to do exactly what you know they're to- they here's a curriculum but you decide how to teach it 

438.41 442.79 A: so they know they have children that are you know more visual okay they're gonna teach more visually 

443.42 448.04 A: versus where the regular public schools they all have to do it exactly alike it's more a cookie cutter 

448.26 450.91 B: 'cause there's more children in a class 

450.32 454.23 A: we well and and they don't allow you to deviate from their patterns 

453.78 457.24 B: you do the children take a bus to school also or 

456.56 458.64 A: yes yes they're picked by the bus 

460.69 464.94 B: it sounds like a a great um i know they've opened up um 

465.04 468.96 B: in rochester also but the teachers' union are sort of against 

471.15 477.64 A: and then we lucked out uh somebody donated enough computers where there's almost one computer per student at the school 

478.72 480.27 B: (( that great )) 

482.36 485.37 B: well they're doing that also out there though uh 

485.99 487.87 B: like uh gateway um 

488.08 492.20 B: donated a lot and i._b._m. donated a lot of computers also 

495.38 496.45 B: but um 

496.20 500.59 A: i wish they would of been new but [laughter] but they're computers that's all that matters 

500.97 508.88 B: that's right but it sounds like you you've got a good system there now with your children but do they have all the grades in the charter schools 

508.21 509.84 A: it's k. through eight 

510.35 512.46 B: what happens after eighth grade they have to 

511.83 514.58 A: they go to the public high school where you go to public high school 

516.29 519.94 B: do they have problems with discipline in the high schools or 

519.93 523.35 A: like any other high school yeah i mean it's not as bad 

525.22 527.29 A: they just happen at this school 

528.04 531.95 A: [sigh] we've gotten an influx of 

532.67 534.53 A: lower income to this area 

535.94 542.17 A: and a lot of these kids are from tallahassee have gotten kicked out of the public school there so they've moved down here 

544.53 546.75 B: well they don't have if they if they're 

547.02 553.31 B: over violent they just suspend them don't they have a school that they can send them to for discipline and things 

551.23 552.03 A: no 

552.86 556.03 A: no they don't have a special school for that yet 

555.38 557.12 B: well they had one here 

557.63 562.49 B: and and uh i think it's still operating but of course because of the budget cuts 

562.60 568.14 B: they may not be able to fund it any more so they have to put the children back into the school system 

567.56 569.32 A: oh lord 

569.56 573.97 B: and then since they cut down on the psychologists and social workers 

574.25 576.15 A: yeah and then they end up coming to me 

577.06 577.92 B: (( uh )) 

577.07 579.20 A: i'm a guard at juvenile jail [laughter] 

579.36 582.16 B: but the thing is they disrupt the classes 

582.10 583.60 A: right 

584.34 592.64 B: they have a tutor system where you live also if a child gets thrown out of school they have an individual tutor coming to the house or 

592.98 598.58 A: um i don't know if they have that if they've been kicked out of school i know they have that for children that have gotten 

598.73 599.89 A: you know that are
