45.52 46.32 B: yeah 

46.64 47.73 B: yeah 

47.13 49.31 A: yeah there's quite a bit wrong 

48.80 52.75 B: well what what what in your opinion is wrong where are 

51.64 53.80 A: well obviously well the 

52.78 54.61 B: where's a good place to start 

54.05 61.80 A: well yeah well my opinion i wish that ah teachers could make more money then maybe more people might decide that want to be teachers 

55.53 56.48 B: [laughter] 

61.47 63.09 B: i'll vote for that 

62.52 64.57 A: (( [laughter] one )) 

64.65 72.28 A: um look and the other i don't know if new york is the same but in the state of wisconsin you have to get a special teaching certificate to be able to teach 

72.73 78.85 A: and a lot of the teachers that are teachers that have that i don't feel should be teachers 

80.25 86.13 B: [mn] [mn] it's ah [sigh] it's i think you know the teacher certification is there for a reason 

86.26 92.39 B: and i think they're evolving that um at least in new york to 

92.48 94.04 B: open it up to 

94.32 103.91 B: others a little bit more easily people that you know didn't pursue it the first time but they're you know they're so desperate for teachers especially in some areas like math and science 

104.16 107.58 B: that you're trying to make pathways for people to come into the profession 

107.49 108.75 A: right 

108.15 111.96 B: um and we're finding that ah 

112.44 114.70 B: um some people 

114.93 118.71 B: ah do pretty well coming in they've they've got 

118.90 122.55 B: a good grounding and you know can get started and others 

122.65 126.37 B: ah because they don't get the teacher training 

126.77 131.47 B: um don't do very well and ah pretty quickly pack it up and leave 

131.97 137.79 B: um because the the hurry up programs to get alternative people started 

138.52 143.47 B: ah don't give [sigh] don't give those people all the training that a ah 

143.50 144.69 B: a four year 

144.83 146.74 B: degree in teaching does 

146.21 147.20 A: mhm 

146.85 148.72 B: so it it's a mixed bag 

148.89 158.88 B: like a lot of different things um you know i i think a lot of what's going at public schools at least in new york and new york's no different than most places um 

150.10 152.20 A: yeah i have to agree 

159.04 161.62 B: there are huge loads 

161.70 165.77 B: being put on schools administrators and teachers 

165.98 176.09 B: they're very different ah from the the traditional public schools the setting that you might have gone to and i went to and it's it's a very different place nowadays 

176.36 181.65 B: um with ah special education students being included in 

181.75 189.16 B: in regular classrooms and the the what it takes to ah teach them and manage them 

189.23 192.41 B: and they ways that districts are handling 

192.78 198.17 B: the placement of those kids in the regular classrooms really have a big impact on what goes on in the classroom 

197.76 199.11 A: mhm 

198.66 201.74 B: um it it changes what you do 

201.94 210.36 B: and you know in in any business in any profession when change happens sometimes it happens easily and well and other times it happens a little bit harder 

210.15 211.42 A: right 

210.82 214.89 B: and ah that that's ah you know that dynamic is still there 

215.28 229.21 A: yes i unders- yeah i agree the one thing i've never understood is why i mean i probably know the answer if i thought about it enough but ah why the post graduate or post ah secondary schools you don't require a teaching certificate to 

229.09 231.99 A: teach at junior college or at the university level 

231.55 233.46 B: [laughter] 

232.21 235.85 A: but you re- but you require one for the younger children 

235.88 236.86 B: yeah 

235.92 239.36 A: i mean i could probably see why to an extent 

239.40 247.32 A: um because necessarily people maybe in high school don't or elementary school whatever aren't there necessarily to want to learn i guess and maybe 

247.34 256.30 A: certificate aids in that process and the people in college want to be there i don't know maybe that's why but it always 

253.31 254.21 B: yeah 

256.96 260.29 A: you know struck me as funny i'm a i'm still in u._s. m._b._a. 

260.30 262.69 A: and i can't even go and teach um 

262.86 265.08 A: you know in high school like i would want to 

265.00 265.89 B: yeah 

265.36 270.20 A: um but i could go teach college and i've no interest in doing that 

269.72 270.76 B: [laughter] 

270.50 273.13 A: and so it's interesting 

273.22 277.99 B: yeah i i to me that always stemmed from the the money stream i mean a 

278.00 279.81 B: public institution 

280.09 285.44 B: um you know there's a where the funding comes from and the fact that people want 

286.13 291.54 B: ah government wants ah people that are certified to do a job 

291.60 294.94 B: when the government is footing the entire bill 

295.34 297.83 B: (( ah versus ah well )) 

298.32 301.47 B: traditionally college is a private institution 

301.75 306.13 B: you know let the buyer beware and let the college ah hire the best it can 

306.04 307.34 A: right 

306.73 310.01 B: um with you know the the growth of 

310.13 313.63 B: ah state colleges and and that kind of thing ah 

313.82 321.60 B: it may may may have gotten a little more convoluted than than a simple argument like that but ah i think that's probably at the root of it 

318.65 319.56 A: yeah 

321.42 333.55 A: yeah i i think so to an extent but it's with the junior college for instance i mean maybe not the university level but a junior college or community college i know tax dollars go direct from property taxes go directly to support 

333.33 334.10 B: yeah 

333.58 335.86 A: community colleges in my county 

335.71 336.57 B: yeah 

336.03 339.72 A: and i was i know they don't go to the university in my county but ah 

339.75 350.82 A: um but they don't yet re- they still don't require even though tax dollars go directly to support junior colleges they ah they don't have those same requirements which is fun- probably because more money goes to ah 

346.03 347.00 B: right 

350.87 354.31 A: you k. twelve through that's the junior college a lot of it still 

354.25 356.12 B: yeah i mean i i 

354.76 355.86 A: they just book 

356.17 361.58 B: i don't know the origins of all that i mean the college started out way back when as a 

362.04 365.98 B: ah private institution per se and 

366.12 372.96 B: ah k. twelve started out as a public institution and you know why when the the 

373.18 375.34 B: state colleges grew they didn't 

375.54 379.19 B: create new certifications i i have no idea [laughter] 

378.46 381.01 A: right i i have no idea either 

380.70 381.64 B: yeah 

381.82 385.03 B: but there's ah there's a whole lot to 

385.46 388.82 B: ah public education that that's out there that's 

388.99 399.01 B: well like you said it's certainly changed and its made the job a lot more difficult and at the same time the st- the states i don't know what wisconsin's doing but the states are ratcheting up their 

399.21 402.22 B: expectations and their standards for kids and 

402.74 409.51 B: it's ah it's a lot of change going on all at the same time and people mhm 

407.23 420.36 A: yeah and i and i don't necessarily disagree with that the one thing i wish they wouldn't do and i know a lot of teachers in the state of wisconsin are fighting this idea is to also have continuing education or continuous certification of teachers like they do the kids 

420.48 421.34 B: yeah 

420.94 426.03 A: um the reason why i mentioned that is because i ah also am a securities broker 

426.23 431.36 A: and i have to on a yearly basis ah go through continuing education 

426.44 427.09 B: (( mm )) 

431.29 432.17 B: yeah 

431.67 435.77 A: just to keep up with my licenses and just to ah and for that and for that issue 

435.88 449.57 A: and ah for the fact that teachers aren't required to do that kind of disturbs me because i know there are a lot of um teachers that i feel shouldn't be teachers and are just there because it's an easy job to them and they have tenure 

449.63 451.24 B: mhm mhm 

450.10 454.89 A: and they have no real initiative to make themselves better for the students 

454.57 455.44 B: mhm 

455.01 464.19 A: but yet i'm mandated by the federal government to better myself through continuous education but the government doesn't enforce teachers to do the same thing 

463.85 471.33 B: yeah that that's a real catch twenty two ah and actually new york they are they have changed teacher certification 

466.10 467.12 A: i know it is 

471.36 478.94 B: to make that requirement i mean they they can't go back and ah put the old people under the new regs 

479.01 482.99 B: but people that are newly certified i think it's as of this february 

482.78 483.72 A: (( okay )) 

483.27 486.02 B: ah are required to take 

486.68 495.66 B: something like one hundred and seventy five clock hours of of professional development every i don't know whether it's three years or every five years 

495.39 496.32 A: okay 

496.01 498.02 B: and that and that's a fair chunk 

497.78 502.95 A: yeah i mean it is it is because i'm only required to take twenty four credit hours a year 

498.57 499.75 B: um 

499.92 500.65 B: it 

502.68 505.44 B: yeah in and of itself 

505.58 510.19 B: i mean if if i counted up the hours that i spend in in different ah 

510.26 515.90 B: programs that the school puts on and ah summer institutes and that kind of thing 

515.92 519.71 B: i think i'd be close to that i don't know whether i'd quite make it or not 

520.50 530.76 B: um but ah in and of itself you can you know you can throw people in a room and give them seminar after seminar but if they're not motivated to learn and do something with it 

531.27 533.97 B: it's not necessarily going to change too much either 

533.53 545.56 A: no it's not but it but it's but it's done but that kind of i- instituting that kind of mandate in the securities industry has changed that beyond belief i know it wasn't very effective in the beginning but it's 

534.87 536.11 B: and 

541.87 542.71 B: yeah 

545.38 549.29 A: evolved into something that's become very effective i just think it's a time issue 

549.26 550.06 B: yeah 

549.39 552.56 A: as long as it's a continuous development i think it can work 

552.27 557.64 B: yeah it's ah [mn] the the other issues that schools face 

557.90 562.08 B: ah because it's a public sector is the different demands 

562.30 564.65 B: ah and the different ah 

564.95 567.71 B: ah clients that we serve 

567.87 574.64 B: ah as opposed to the private sector you know if if if you do a good job people come back you stay in business but if you don't they don't 

574.90 575.97 B: and you're out 

575.80 576.76 A: mhm 

576.14 578.86 B: and everybody knows it pretty quick one way or another 

579.28 580.72 B: um 

580.90 587.12 B: the the the the fact that we serve different masters ah all by itself 

587.28 589.70 B: creates a real tense 

589.79 591.18 B: situation 

591.50 593.88 B: ah i mean i'm in the i'm in a 

594.17 596.03 B: ah urban district 

596.21 599.89 B: working with pretty much the ah the poorest of the poor
