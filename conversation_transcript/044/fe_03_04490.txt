15.19 17.20 A: yeah 

15.82 16.64 B: oh 

16.75 18.03 B: i'm harvey 

18.12 19.13 A: harvey 

18.60 19.81 B: yeah 

19.47 20.36 A: okay 

20.01 25.94 B: and um i ar- i was a school teacher i mean i'm retired now 

26.39 31.58 B: so i know a lot about this and i have some real you know opinions on it 

31.78 33.44 B: you know anything about schools 

33.63 34.76 A: (( uh )) 

34.81 37.14 A: not really i went to a suburban 

37.36 42.13 A: uh school district so it's probably not representative of schools in general 

41.97 43.21 B: yeah 

42.83 44.67 A: so that's about all i have 

44.86 46.37 B: well uh 

47.53 51.36 B: so uh you're gonna have to talk about it you know 

50.69 51.93 A: yeah 

51.56 55.22 B: otherwise they won't pay us you want me to start or what 

54.69 58.21 A: um yeah sure i mean what were the major things you saw 

58.66 66.69 B: well i was uh a school teacher for my whole career i did twenty eight years and uh retired in nineteen ninety six 

66.90 75.10 B: and uh it's obvious to anybody who's got an open mind that uh unionism is what is what's at 

75.18 78.74 B: uh what's ruining this public school system is 

79.01 84.76 B: teachers' unions have such a strong grip on what teachers do 

84.80 89.76 B: especially in new york where i where i'm living you know where i did my career 

89.86 91.11 B: and uh 

91.72 95.96 B: i mean they'll they'll deny it to the nth degree you know but uh 

97.02 105.02 B: unions are the ones that prevent uh any kind of changes rule changes that that would benefit children 

105.57 116.36 B: uh in other words the teacher comes first so far as the union is concerned but they'll never admit it they'll always find an ec- you know a way to make it sound like we're doing it for the children 

117.14 122.93 A: what kind of uh i mean what kind of changes did you see balked while you were a teacher that would have helped the kids 

123.30 124.35 B: um 

125.62 126.57 B: well 

127.65 131.21 B: with uh weakening of the unions uh 

132.58 137.84 B: uh you'd be able to get rid of uh incompetent teachers i mean 

137.68 138.68 A: yeah 

137.95 145.54 B: you wo- just wouldn't believe how many teachers we have working now who can't speak or write 

145.70 147.83 B: english properly 

148.35 156.08 B: they're even going overseas because there's a teachers' shortage and they're hiring teachers you know for various subjects not english 

156.36 162.31 B: but for various subjects but i mean if you're teaching math should you be role modeling 

163.08 172.28 B: uh such poor english that the the children don't even know what you're talking about i mean it it's just the it's it's terrible but um 

167.95 169.68 A: yeah 

172.81 182.46 B: nothing can be done i mean that's not a union problem that's a teacher shortage problem the fact that they're hiring teachers who can't speak english but our native born 

182.78 184.85 B: teachers aren't a whole lot better 

184.82 193.09 B: i'm sorry to say you know i know it sounds racist to say things like this but if you would just walk through the public school system 

192.97 206.50 B: in a minority area you would be appalled by the fact that teachers are using the same substandard english as the children are and that's not education that's all there is to it 

206.31 208.25 B: they can't write a sentence 

208.99 212.05 B: and they can't speak properly and it's terrible 

212.08 215.16 B: 'cause you know all learning begins with language 

215.89 218.70 A: (( yeah i )) 

217.56 218.47 B: uh 

218.66 220.54 B: yeah go ahead what- whatever you 

220.87 225.49 B: notice either in your own education or just from watching it on television of whatever 

225.31 229.45 A: i guess i mean from t._v. the two problems i noticed were just 

229.75 231.20 A: some school districts 

230.99 238.50 A: seem like they don't have the resources i'm not sure where they go but i guess the the worst examples they give you on television and i guarantee the schools where there is 

234.21 235.29 B: mhm 

238.30 251.78 A: don't have the resources necessarily to do anything like to set up more classrooms et cetera like i've i've been in a whole mess of school districts where there were just not enough even though they were like well off suburban district there is just not enough room for each classroom 

242.89 243.69 B: yeah 

251.14 252.54 B: absolutely right 

252.44 266.66 A: and i guess the second thing was can't avoid unionization just the fact that there's a shortage of good teachers and the ones that do stay that the that they're protected from being fired or oftentimes by one's even in good districts 

264.91 265.76 B: mhm 

266.25 267.35 B: that's right 

267.40 276.59 B: that's exactly my point it's just that the average person who's not a teacher doesn't realize it's because of unionism that that happens you can't fire anybody 

276.76 279.11 B: or you can do is get them transferred away 

279.13 287.48 B: at most and and that's just a if if you can uh get them to agree to it [laughter] you know once they have tenure forget it 

279.16 279.94 A: yeah 

287.13 288.21 A: yeah 

287.59 289.53 B: they're there to stay if they wanna 

290.14 293.67 B: so that's why every now and then you hear these horror stories about 

294.33 300.51 B: principals who do their best to torture teachers and make it uncomfortable for them to leave 

300.57 310.08 B: so that they will leave you know because that's the only way they have they can't fire them so all they can do is make their lives miserable and hope that they'll say you know i want to get out of here 

304.97 305.85 A: (( mm yeah )) 

311.39 312.23 A: wow 

312.54 313.51 B: it's 

312.74 313.69 A: i mean what wo- 

313.75 318.83 A: what would you do to solve that like 'cause i as far as the teachers i just have no idea what to do 

318.95 321.20 A: or what could be done to solve that 

320.59 327.91 B: well uh i i don't i don't think there's a solution in i mean uh unionism is here to stay for the time being 

328.04 341.61 B: at least in our lifetime i think but from what you the problem that you were talking about lack of resources that's gonna get worse not better why because i think you can tell that uh 

341.56 346.80 B: conservatism is is is getting stronger and stronger in the united states that 

346.91 354.19 B: republicans winning all the elections and controlling all the legislatures and their agenda is 

354.00 364.97 B: is to move towards private schools away from public schools and uh they want to put more education i mean more uh religion into schools and so they divert 

364.90 375.38 B: uh public funds from schools so schools will get worse and worse and the less money they have the worse teachers they'll have the worse books they'll have the worse uh buildings 

375.64 378.19 B: that they'll have and um 

379.36 388.68 B: i don't i just don't see the united states shifting back to a liberal outlook you know in the near term i i just don't see it because of 

388.67 401.88 B: the world situation the the the elector would never vote for somebody who's perceived as weak on you know terrorism or whatever they'll always vote for some you know 

402.13 403.69 B: guy like bush 

403.73 404.68 A: yeah 

404.05 410.13 B: and and he's all for it he he's the leader of this movement of getting away from public education 

410.18 412.86 B: and moving towards a religious type of school 

414.38 415.75 A: well i 

415.53 418.30 B: that's where his voter base comes from 

418.47 419.76 A: yeah i 

420.35 431.66 A: system leaves a lot to be desired especially when it comes to just bundling people out of the public school system and making them the ones who have resources taken out and leaving the rough end 

429.16 430.35 B: yeah 

430.63 432.71 B: that's right and so uh 

433.19 439.09 B: the good teachers like you you mentioned before the good teachers can't wait to get out of there they retire 

439.71 441.39 B: as soon as they can 

441.65 448.73 B: and uh leave it to the incompetents you know it's it's the peter principle and it it's murphy's law all over you know 

448.74 449.99 B: that the 

450.59 454.93 B: the worst survive and and the best can't take it and just go away 

456.01 465.93 B: and that's that's all there is to it it's not gonna get better it's a sad situation you know it's just so depressing that that's why i quit myself as soon as i was uh 

464.53 467.34 A: (( yeah )) 

466.41 469.24 B: uh qualified for a pension i just said goodbye 

469.46 473.34 B: this is getting this is terrible i mean you just wouldn't believe it 

469.68 471.27 A: (( yeah )) 

474.08 478.41 A: do you think i don't know do you think like one of the the 

478.42 492.22 A: kind of drive toward accountability but a smaller level like increasing like the the amounts a teacher can get if their students do well by some sort of measure would help with that or do you think that that's also misguided 

492.64 498.19 B: well it could it could work but the the problem is who's setting these standards and who's really 

498.32 500.15 B: checking up on them i mean 

500.58 504.95 B: i mean you know if some incompetent guy or some really 

505.17 509.30 B: misguided types set up a set of standards 

510.21 518.09 B: that everybody's required to follow because they they manage to push it through a legislature or pass it somehow pass it into law 

518.61 530.23 B: and every you know that's what teachers are complaining about right now that that some some crazy uh criteria were passed here in new york and every teacher has has to uh 

530.11 536.10 B: drive their class towards these uh goals that are don't seem to them to be 

536.17 537.57 B: (( um )) 

538.02 544.34 B: educationally sound like test taking for example i mean didn't you did it ever occur to you you know like 

544.67 547.25 B: what the hell are we taking all these tests for 

547.30 548.30 B: uh 

548.34 550.48 B: what what do they really uh 

550.92 555.06 B: determine i mean unless the unless unless the test is 

555.31 558.38 B: is is crafted by the teacher 

558.39 563.17 B: or someone who really knows what they're they're testing i mean they have these um 

564.98 566.42 B: these uh 

565.60 570.12 A: (( mhm )) 

567.40 572.68 B: uniform tests for a whole for a whole system to take the same exact test 

573.18 579.53 B: and uh to say if you if you don't pass it you're getting left back that's all you're getting left back 

579.69 582.90 B: i mean that just ruins a person's life totally 

583.03 585.01 B: to get left back like that 

585.52 589.50 B: it's it's i don't think it's the right way to go 

589.32 592.43 A: well i don't know my experience with those tests is 

592.74 599.95 A: seemed then like i don't know about the school districts where the teaching's probably not good but in areas where the teaching is adequate it's pretty hard
