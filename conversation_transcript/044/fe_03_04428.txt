2.95 4.73 B: uh hi i'm mike 

4.93 5.84 A: (( hi mike )) 

5.58 7.26 B: (( hi how are you )) 

7.27 9.85 B: is this your first time 

7.40 9.03 A: (( pretty good how you doing )) 

9.14 11.64 A: uh no i actually did this earlier today 

11.42 13.27 B: oh you did right [mn] 

12.50 14.63 A: yeah it's weird they're giving the same question 

14.60 23.95 B: oh no kidding oh wow okay uh okay well uh let's see uh this is my third um uh phone call so 

15.88 16.79 A: yeah 

23.99 25.06 B: um 

25.46 30.26 B: i don't know um if somebody gave me a million dollars and um 

30.46 32.80 B: with a stipulation that um 

33.40 36.45 B: i couldn't speak to any of my friends is that right 

36.31 38.32 A: i think it said just to your best friend 

38.15 40.24 B: oh to your best friend right 

39.50 40.54 A: mhm 

40.72 41.97 B: um 

42.03 43.77 B: (( that would be kind of difficult )) 

44.42 45.47 B: (( but )) 

45.69 49.05 B: i'm thinking in terms of what i can do 

50.48 53.41 B: with the money and uh 

54.62 59.26 B: i think that it would be something along the lines of him getting a big gift 

59.70 61.48 B: and um 

59.87 60.89 A: (( mhm mhm mm )) 

62.01 64.20 B: i think the other thing would be to 

65.11 66.49 B: that um 

67.71 68.99 B: (( i don't know it's )) 

69.77 78.15 B: kinda difficult i you know i'd probably use some of that money you know different charities and things like that 

78.35 79.81 B: and uh 

80.71 83.05 B: i'd probably do some travelling 

84.32 86.39 B: i'm i'm single so 

87.07 91.34 B: there are any any wide variety of things that i could do with mo- 

91.79 92.71 B: (( you know )) 

93.67 95.71 B: it's kind of difficult for me i don't know 

97.02 99.28 B: this is the most difficult question 

99.48 101.45 B: that they've come up with so far 

102.13 103.33 B: what about you 

103.50 110.22 A: yeah thinking from my perspective or what i said earlier today is that a million dollars can buy a lot of friends 

110.08 112.56 B: right yeah 

111.79 116.25 A: and i do have i'm thinking about who this would apply to 

116.44 117.34 B: (( mm )) 

116.72 118.89 A: and 

120.10 124.92 A: i'm thinking about what you said and a lot of it makes sense you know like getting him a nice big gift [noise] 

124.60 125.95 B: right 

126.09 130.16 A: (( and things work out 'cause i mean we're talking about a l- i mean it is a lot of money and it's our )) 

129.86 131.06 B: sure 

130.48 134.01 A: chance to really set probably both of us for life 

134.01 135.75 B: yeah 

136.20 137.23 B: and 

136.45 137.68 A: (( and )) 

143.93 146.71 B: i know uh this this uh 

147.38 149.22 B: uh moral dilemma 

148.75 151.67 A: (( hm )) 

150.29 155.24 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

154.51 162.29 A: [laughter] here's a question what if there was a case uh since we're both single it doesn't apply but say you consider your best friend to be your wife 

155.75 157.05 B: right 

162.69 166.10 B: oh that's right oh gosh 

167.85 170.77 B: i that that would be extremely difficult 

173.97 178.65 B: it i- it def- [laughter] i i think that would be immediately [laughter] 

178.61 192.35 B: be a sit down [laughter] at the kitchen table real fast [laughter] [laughter] oh boy oh boy yeah [laughter] 

183.47 184.18 A: (( [laughter] )) 

185.47 186.53 A: (( [laughter] )) 

190.96 196.05 A: well i i know my father would gladly pay a pay a million dollars to get his wife to stop talking 

195.67 196.37 B: (( right )) 

196.40 208.51 B: [laughter] that's right too [laughter] but y- y- you know the the other thing is the fact what what if you had some kids [laughter] they go along with 

208.44 215.00 B: her [laughter] right oh gosh [laughter] oh 

209.85 210.76 A: (( [laughter] )) 

215.18 216.48 B: (( but um )) 

217.33 218.48 B: i don't know 

219.64 227.80 B: well the way they you know with all of these lotteries the way they're giving away money like thirty three million dollars and all of these kinds of things it just seems so 

228.24 234.00 B: you know and people making a lot of bad decisions when they get the money 

233.93 234.93 A: mhm 

234.33 249.31 B: and i i i've often thought about that you know and it the other thing is the fact that a lot of a lot of times these the people with the most success don't change their lifestyle dramatically at all 

249.50 252.51 B: and the people that that do 

249.65 251.48 A: mhm 

253.13 254.21 B: uh 

255.11 263.53 B: do not have any success [sigh] change their life dramatically and um a lot of um 

264.01 268.01 B: uh not so nice things uh befall them you know 

267.74 271.20 A: mhm are you familiar with uh warren buffett 

268.20 269.32 B: so i've s- 

271.04 273.70 B: warren buffett sure am 

273.41 275.96 A: yeah he's lived in the same house for thirty years 

276.17 278.69 B: and he's one of the richest men in the world 

278.31 279.56 A: mhm 

278.97 285.30 B: that's right drives the same car i think and right didn't that wow 

285.59 287.95 B: just does a lot of travelling 

287.83 288.85 A: mhm 

288.29 290.57 B: yeah oh gosh 

291.11 292.08 B: (( well i )) 

292.36 297.27 B: you know and the other thing i- i mean this would 

297.82 302.03 B: the whole idea of this this m- money 

302.14 308.98 B: coming at the at that time and the price that that you have to pay for it you know this is quite a 

309.03 310.02 B: you know 

310.67 314.29 B: (( ah that you know a lot of a lot of things )) 

315.15 316.43 B: for me i 

316.58 323.86 B: i um i appreciate my friends you know and it just seems like this would be a 

323.88 326.18 B: an extremely difficult uh 

326.24 330.12 B: thing for me to do it's it wouldn't be a 

332.01 333.86 B: it it'd take uh 

335.34 337.93 B: a lot of soul searching i think 

338.19 342.19 B: you know you know there may even be there may even 

343.02 345.66 B: be the possibility that it you know i 

347.48 348.89 B: i'm i 

349.54 352.97 B: might not even take it you know i'd just 

353.51 354.31 B: (( i don't know )) 

354.90 362.87 B: but uh in all likelihood i would but it there there's also that thought too you know that n- not taking it as well 

363.06 363.89 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

363.14 368.62 B: so they they kind of surprised me you know even saying that you know but i mean it just seems like 

369.56 372.62 B: (( you know that your [mn] )) 

373.71 375.21 B: your your whole 

376.77 381.35 B: you know especially when your value system is um 

382.94 384.71 B: is put into question 

385.46 391.24 B: yeah [laughter] so there there there was another thought that i had 

385.57 386.49 A: (( mhm mhm [laughter] )) 

393.46 397.58 A: here's a something a little related but it just reminds of a question 

397.86 403.25 A: a professor of mine asked our class once and is that would you 

400.54 401.40 B: (( yeah )) 

404.27 407.14 A: take a million dollars to change your race 

408.31 411.37 B: oh that's right yeah 

411.63 412.55 B: mm 

413.44 415.46 A: my thought is i don't mind 

416.07 416.88 B: (( mm )) 

416.54 419.07 A: i'm not particularly attached to my race 

418.81 420.25 B: right 

420.01 422.12 A: so yeah give me the million dollars 

422.41 426.29 B: [laughter] yeah 

426.56 427.35 B: (( what )) 

429.38 437.52 A: well it's surprising a lot of people said no to that they have a very strong attachment they're very proud 

432.97 433.63 B: (( w- )) 

435.53 436.73 B: right 

436.91 438.47 B: right yeah 

437.87 444.16 A: there's nothing wrong with that but if you think about it it's just kind of just such an arbitrary thing race so 

443.54 451.20 B: right yeah but race in america is so so damned important 

450.77 451.78 A: mhm 

451.22 451.98 B: it's 

454.80 456.56 B: (( right yeah and i mean it's just )) 

457.30 468.91 B: and then you start looking at you know serbia croatia and in that area there seven hundred years of all of this fighting over religion 

469.05 471.90 B: you know nationality uh 

469.20 469.97 A: mhm 

472.47 474.67 B: and all of those kinds of things 

476.41 479.22 B: and i mean it it isn't even changing colors 

479.46 480.91 A: mhm 

479.69 480.95 B: (( but [sigh] )) 

481.47 485.44 B: yeah that that's another thing that's that is another thought provoking 

486.36 488.45 B: way of looking at things 

488.60 489.51 B: from a 

490.16 491.45 B: but 

493.54 495.29 B: i don't know it just uh 

496.67 498.54 B: seems to me that uh 

499.80 504.06 B: in the situation that they're asking for it's 

502.75 503.79 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

505.06 507.00 B: it isn't something that you 

507.07 513.22 B: would have to you know dwell on for quite a w- for quite a bit before you could really 

514.02 515.95 B: and 

517.32 518.03 B: (( [sigh] [mn] [mn] )) 

518.05 518.89 A: (( it's )) 

519.23 527.51 A: it's hard just having i guess it's different because it's the one friend as opposed to say all your friends or someone in your family 

520.35 521.67 B: objecti- 

522.47 524.09 B: right right 

526.28 529.53 B: that's right and it you know 

530.76 538.26 B: having objectivity and subjectivity you know it just seems like and it's another thing that kinda 

531.64 532.22 A: (( a )) 

539.34 541.00 B: (( like you co- [sigh] )) 

543.77 545.86 B: (( i don't know it )) 

547.56 556.00 A: kind of a funny story the person with whom i spoke earlier today when we asked the q- question his response was that his best friend is dead so it's not really an issue 

550.27 551.59 B: right 

552.27 553.16 B: right 

555.34 568.52 B: [laughter] maybe he could spread a few bucks over uh walden pond and think of him 

567.83 569.44 A: [laughter] 

568.36 575.20 B: (( or something it will [laughter] just something along those lines )) 

575.21 576.70 B: oh gosh 

576.94 578.53 B: yeah 

578.66 580.05 B: (( so )) 

580.75 584.40 B: i guess but um 

584.87 588.94 B: i think the other thing is the fact that i you know if you 

590.64 599.95 B: you know we're we're all down here on for some kind of reason and you just that's another thing i mean the ability to you know you know help and s-
