39.69 43.98 A: uh public school system uh the public school system 

41.66 42.50 B: (( ah )) 

44.70 46.95 A: is a system uh 

47.02 50.43 A: you know it's just a matter of trying to um 

50.78 56.72 A: give the best care possible to our children and the way we do that is raise money 

58.48 59.83 B: (( hm [cough] )) 

59.92 67.84 A: so i you you uh i worked for a year in in special education so i r- realize the need 

67.84 81.44 A: because these people will always be dependent on uh the system all their lives because they're just uh not able to take care of themselves so we have to be able to take care of these people 

78.32 79.68 B: (( hm )) 

81.48 86.62 A: um along with the people that are uh quote unquote normal 

86.54 97.25 A: and the normal people are just gonna have to be able to in the future uh be able to donate money somehow whether it's through taxes or uh 

97.29 98.66 A: fundraising 

99.96 101.58 B: [lipsmack] for public schools you mean 

101.29 106.66 A: yeah now how how how have you ever raised money for the public school system 

101.81 102.37 B: (( [mn] )) 

106.09 115.02 B: no uh we've never had to i uh my career is in atlantic city and uh it was um [lipsmack] 

115.29 119.65 B: oh there were times when we had to uh uh draw in our belts 

119.54 132.21 B: but for the most part uh the atlantic city public schools had the money that they needed uh pretty much to get the job done there were there were lean times of course i i don't mean it was always that way 

132.31 141.53 B: but uh [lipsmack] no i i never had to go out and uh do fundraisers to uh uh get money for textbooks or supplies 

140.14 142.73 A: well that's a whole job in itself 

142.27 143.31 B: (( hm )) 

142.82 152.42 A: you have to learn how to be a fundraiser a salesman and it takes training you have to wanna be one first and then secondly ob- you n- need to take 

152.51 156.80 A: the steps to do that um 

156.90 161.70 A: which are a learning experience so that you can raise money and 

161.82 163.81 A: most of the uh 

164.00 165.89 A: uh salesmen 

166.23 168.38 A: uh make most the money 

168.38 174.95 B: well you what you're saying then is that you think that one of the problems with the public schools is that they don't have enough money 

168.40 169.22 A: uh 

175.22 188.08 B: and that uh okay all right yes i will agree with you on that because i think that uh there are serious problems with the american uh school system right now the infrastructure of it and um [lipsmack] 

175.29 176.17 A: yeah 

188.31 197.14 B: educators know how to correct these problems i think but it does take money and it takes reeducating the public to um [lipsmack] be more 

197.67 204.54 B: codicil to paying out money to schools for uh getting the results that people expect 

204.20 207.75 A: well money uh is not easy to make 

208.11 213.31 A: and this is what one of the things we need to teach the young people while they're in school 

213.47 225.00 A: that they've gotta really they gotta do their homework uh they not only do their schoolwork during the day but they gotta do their homework at night to keep pace 

225.15 226.66 A: with uh 

227.15 230.44 A: the with the uh educational system 

230.41 244.95 B: well i agree with ya there but then uh i i'd like to take that a step for- uh a step further and uh say that parents i think need to be educated too because so many of these kids who come to school are raising themselves 

244.36 258.22 A: yeah i mean it's just incredible without an education uh you know well my mother was eighteen years old when she met my father and they didn't plan me i was an accident and that's they're set up for a tragedy 

245.23 246.54 B: (( and [mn] )) 

257.93 259.06 B: oh really 

258.71 261.30 A: yeah you've gotta be 

261.57 266.95 A: we've gotta teach people that they need to be married before they have children 

267.04 271.42 A: they need to learn that okay because otherwise 

271.46 280.31 A: the american dream is um distorted and it doesn't happen it's very important in my opinion 

281.04 284.55 A: that you plan your wedding and then 

285.48 292.11 A: get married and plan for your children in the future and that takes careful 

292.47 294.52 A: uh planning it doesn't 

293.55 296.03 B: yes it does it takes financial planning 

295.66 298.96 A: now these people that are all you know that um [lipsmack] 

298.99 305.87 A: are getting um have- starting children young it's just holding up the whole system 

306.14 307.42 A: it really 

307.86 309.43 A: because uh 

309.46 310.28 A: they 

310.51 313.97 A: lots of them are are automatically on welfare 

314.05 321.89 A: because they're not married they've got an illegitimate child and automatically uh every the taxpayer who is 

322.05 334.26 A: for the school system is the uh real estate property owners have to pay uh their taxes to support these new families that are unorganized 

334.80 336.14 A: you see what i mean 

334.88 335.44 B: (( [cough] )) 

335.62 338.69 B: (( [mn] yeah i understand what you're saying there uh [lipsmack] )) 

338.52 342.30 A: but i believe that firmly you know uh what's your name again please 

341.65 342.54 B: bob 

342.36 344.81 A: bob this is dan bear i believe 

342.91 343.70 B: (( mm )) 

344.94 346.53 A: that it is 

346.64 350.68 A: the best possible way to education 

350.97 357.07 A: the children is to teach that that they need to 

358.51 359.92 A: plan 

361.09 365.33 A: and uh be very careful 

365.54 367.96 A: about their sexual behavior 

368.50 370.62 A: and be ready 

370.87 375.27 A: to start a family and to support a child 

375.13 376.65 B: mhm 

376.01 385.38 A: we need the mothers and fathers of the child to be able to support the children in their family you know not for them to become 

385.72 386.90 A: (( um )) 

387.11 394.80 A: a member of the welfare system because it just causes too much confusion 

394.82 396.55 A: and um 

396.75 400.08 A: we end up using a lot of money um 

400.46 408.88 A: and we're supporting people just like the special education children i mean it's what happens we get they get supported for their whole lives by 

408.82 417.59 A: the taxpayer who is the one who earns enough money to buy real estate and every year uh i understand that their tax 

418.16 419.49 A: uh 

420.75 422.20 A: there's a 

422.13 431.10 A: uh real estate tax on people who own real estate and these people have to pay this tax every year 

430.94 440.02 A: automatically and that's i think i understand that's on top of their income tax they also have to pay income tax too 

440.00 446.92 A: so the burden is put on the guys that are successful in business the guys that have uh 

446.95 450.41 A: done the right things and planned their families 

450.72 462.31 B: [lipsmack] well that's not always the case [laughter] well number one my daughter teaches or both my daughters uh have taught special education and one of them is a career uh special education teacher 

450.75 451.92 A: and uh 

462.66 471.76 B: and um i've worked with special education students myself and there are many different types of people uh types of learning um 

471.80 482.04 B: deficiencies and uh there are people who are making uh a living who were in special education when they were in school 

481.45 484.30 A: well that's good that that gives us hope 

483.71 493.76 B: yes yes so uh i mean the taxpayer does not uh is not burdened by them once they graduate from school not unless there is something else uh 

490.86 495.28 A: most of them they are aren't they most of uh we have to take care of but i mean 

494.33 495.63 B: a problem 

495.34 498.70 A: most of them are taken care of all their lives 

498.60 508.46 B: but not by the government i mean there are fa- there are families and so forth of uh special education i mean is irrespective [laughter] of class or uh 

500.27 501.24 A: (( what do you )) 

508.55 511.27 B: uh of socioeconomic standing 

511.29 515.11 B: uh there are plenty of people uh with um 

516.13 521.59 B: big incomes who um have children in special education classes 

521.67 528.18 B: and so that not all the special education students are a burden on the government uh throughout their lives 

527.87 532.35 A: well all i can say is that i i worked as a uh 

532.83 534.77 A: professional surfer 

534.89 544.30 A: and uh a carpenter's apprentice and i did my homework at night and went to school at santa monica college and became um 

535.92 536.61 B: a 

541.95 542.78 B: mhm 

544.55 554.10 A: i earned a certificate in real estate which i completed eight courses in real estate i took a year course at uh loma real estate school 

554.43 564.98 A: and um i passed um the real estate salesperson's license and that made me it it gave me a career as a real estate salesperson 

565.02 567.89 A: so i see what happens with um 

568.00 574.63 A: uh i represent sellers of real estate and i see what kinda taxes they have to pay 

574.83 582.50 A: uh to pay and they're the ones that are primarily paying for the public school system 

582.07 596.28 B: [lipsmack] for the public school system yes you're absolutely right but you can't say it's only for special ed but going back to the public school system uh i want to agree with what you said earlier about the uh family situation
