1.08 3.80 B: hello my name is jim 

3.11 5.17 A: uh hi my name is jordan 

5.21 6.76 B: hello jordan 

6.40 7.47 A: (( hi )) 

7.28 9.05 B: how ya doing 

8.07 9.11 A: fine 

9.06 12.97 B: well what do ya think u. s. schools uh are they 

13.00 16.24 B: in trouble or what can be done to fix 'em 

15.38 19.32 A: [mn] well yes i think they are do have some problems [lipsmack] 

21.48 22.84 A: do you think so 

22.80 28.91 B: well i i think so my question is you know what are the problems and how do we identify them how do we fix them 

29.08 30.51 B: uh you know 

31.22 34.20 B: i do know that the funding models that are based on 

34.29 40.68 B: needs to be looked at because a lot of our schools don't have the proper [noise] funds for their teachers or kids and so forth 

40.42 41.54 A: yes 

41.07 53.22 B: so i'll have to ask those questions you know uh why are some schools excellent and other schools not uh you know those are some of the questions that come to mind when i think about public schools how 'bout yourself 

53.30 62.90 A: uh yes but i don't know if they they they al- also talk about probably just p- private schools also and you know you just talking about all schools or is it just talking about public schools 

62.49 70.05 B: i think they're just i don't know the the question really didn't say i i think they're mostly talking about just the u. s. public school system 

69.00 71.07 A: [lipsmack] oh okay 'cause i 

70.18 78.83 B: 'cause private school i mean you know they they have a different set of uh uh marching orders i guess if you will and their funding of course is provided by 

78.84 80.48 B: uh the parents 

80.31 90.62 A: yeah that's what i was saying yeah 'cause i know it's a lot different between a public and private school and i know the public schools have a lot to work on you know a lot of different things you know 'cause i know they don't have a lotta 

91.26 96.14 A: you know um [lipsmack] as for the public and the private schools the privates have a lot of um 

96.40 106.84 A: i think disciplinary actions you know with and a public schools you know they let the children away with different things like that and a lot of children are goaded for like clothing you know they 

106.81 111.89 A: there's there's a different things in why there's different between the public and the p- private schools to me 

111.97 112.72 B: (( [mn] )) 

112.77 120.64 A: you know 'cause a lot of children whether it be clothing what they wear and different things like instead of going in just to study you know to to learn 

120.66 125.92 A: you know they have a lotta peer pressure also so there's a lotta different things going on mhm 

126.49 128.55 B: yeah the public school uh 

128.91 134.91 B: uh again there's uh yeah i guess private school you come from a background where 

134.92 149.19 B: uh there are probably parents or or somebody who could take care of ya after schools and and so forth you know get as much time with the parents and the public school you know a lot of parents are trying to you know get by i mean you know just trying to pay the bills 

139.10 140.17 A: yes 

147.06 152.61 A: who work mhm yeah 'cause a lotta children are latch key kids they have to come home by yourself and 

152.74 160.13 A: you know and they don't have people to watch them you know most of they're home a long time by their yourself before their parents get home because they are working 

160.35 166.61 A: so that's a lotta things to address about that they probably need you know a little recreation after after school 

166.66 169.97 A: somebody to watch them or you know something they can do 

169.79 171.62 B: (( right )) 

170.30 173.50 A: you know something like that would be good too also for the kids 

172.89 175.02 B: well now do you have kids in school 

175.24 184.80 A: oh yes i have um well well the other one's grown they're different ages two two nine two ten and twenty four so 

176.54 177.45 B: (( okay )) 

180.21 182.43 B: yeah i know that 

184.33 188.94 B: okay i've got two uh eight year olds and uh twenty seven and twenty nine 

185.00 186.16 A: [laughter] 

188.56 190.78 A: oh see there's a lotta difference see 

190.51 192.75 B: oh yeah so 

191.10 192.52 A: uh-huh yeah 

192.84 203.17 B: it it is different i mean even different from when the uh the older kids were going to school it seems like today and of course and i live in a different state than i did when the older kids were going to school 

202.54 203.42 A: uh-huh 

203.35 216.18 B: and uh you know uh for a while i live in kentucky and then i moved to florida and when i came to florida my kids were behind in in kentucky they were on level according to their uh written stuff okay 

215.95 217.00 A: mhm 

216.20 219.08 B: but when they got here they were behind 

218.43 222.29 A: [lipsmack] yeah i guess it's in different states i guess how they test them i guess 

221.57 223.76 B: yeah i guess what they're saying is you know 

223.77 227.43 B: the standards might be higher here uh i'm not sure 

227.42 240.08 B: uh you know and i don't know what the accountability is i know it seems like the uh i have like so both of them are in third grade and the interesting thing i find interesting is that they come home with entirely different homework 

240.29 251.34 B: and not even on the same general track you know which kinda surprises me you'd think at least if they were both in third grade that they'd be doing fractions around the same time and so forth 

243.28 244.10 A: mhm 

250.62 261.89 A: yeah that's true yeah they they teach they're probably teaching different on different subjects i guess in different states and there is a lotta difference between the states because when uh i was in alabama and i moved to georgia 

261.80 274.01 A: okay they was teaching different you know i had already had 'cause you know when i was going to school back in the seventies sixties and stuff like that when i moved here they they had what i had in alabama i had already had when i got to georgia 

264.72 266.21 B: (( [noise] right )) 

273.73 275.57 B: really 

274.22 281.42 A: yes uh-huh so they it it's a lot different in the uh in the lessons they weren't the states vary 

282.68 289.05 B: well do you think anything could be done as far as trying to improve the schools and what i mean 

289.17 290.10 A: (( yes )) 

289.46 298.14 B: like you said uh discipline but i mean you know i i kept wondering about the different tracks that like i said just the fact i've got two in the exact same grade 

297.71 298.81 A: mhm 

298.16 305.84 B: uh i find interesting the fact that the teachers aren't even on the same wavelength or uh same chapters at the same time 

305.43 310.45 A: oh okay well [laughter] oh and they're the same age 

309.92 312.12 B: oh yeah they're eight year old twins 

311.75 314.41 A: oh they're twins oh okay they're in different classes 

314.02 315.06 B: yes 

314.90 316.91 A: oh they're not on the same level 

316.71 325.79 B: they're not th- they're well that was just it see we came here to florida and of course they had no idea what they were like they started school here last year and they they're both 

325.76 328.18 B: in different classes okay now 

328.10 332.45 B: what i don't know and of course this class uh started the beginning of the year so i don't know 

332.34 343.83 B: uh what's going on but one will bring home fractions like four or five weeks before the other one does uh division you know and and one will be doing something more on reading one will bring home homework 

337.18 338.32 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

343.76 349.44 B: like this week uh was the last week of school one has no homework the other has homework every night 

349.32 351.87 A: oh so they're in different schools or just the same 

351.18 352.94 B: same school 

352.29 353.62 A: the same school 

353.21 356.34 B: same school just different classes 

355.31 357.21 A: oh i guess it's the teachers then 

356.90 361.41 B: it is the teacher but you know the interesting thing i find is that they're both in third grade 

361.77 369.42 A: and so uh do both of 'em have the same class like they one of 'em is having uh division and the other's having um multiplication is that the same 

368.78 375.09 B: yeah i mean at different times and you'd think that they'd try to have 'em on at least the same track to finish the year out 

375.11 380.68 B: and try to get everything in because at the end of the year one's either gonna be behind and one's gonna be ahead 

379.96 382.37 A: [noise] well that's true but [noise] 

381.13 384.13 B: and so i don't know what can we do 

384.08 388.04 B: and you know wh- do we need to have a unified saying hey you know 

387.99 400.54 B: this is basically how third grade should go and and this is the level they should be at uh i know that's what they try to do what they try to quantify what do you find with your nine year old when they bring home uh when they bring home homework 

400.59 407.58 A: [lipsmack] well i i don't see i i really don't know 'cause i think it's got something to do with the teachers too 'cause it's it's that 

408.07 413.67 A: you know like you say you have two in the same grade so you can tell it's really the teachers it's not um [lipsmack] 

414.61 415.76 A: i don't know 

415.61 417.28 B: isn't that interesting though 

417.20 419.55 A: (( yeah [laughter] [mn] well )) 

418.24 426.62 B: y- you know uh and like i said they were behind when they came here from kentucky and in kentucky they were considered on on level or ahead of level 

419.66 420.64 A: (( you know )) 

425.99 438.08 A: they might not have been behind but i guess that's just how they like like i said different states have like different uh standards you know i don't know what it is 'cause like i said alabama was teaching in front of georgia when i got here 

437.94 451.27 A: the other stuff i had when my mother moved here that was back in the sixties and seventies but you know when i had moved here from alabama to georgia when i got in like the seventh grade i had already had that what i did in alabama 

450.32 453.64 B: so you just lazed the last for a couple of years 

452.12 461.07 A: yeah i was just sitting there bored you know 'cause i had already had that and you know it it it was i don't know i can't i didn't know why you know it was like that 

453.78 455.56 B: yeah 

461.09 464.98 A: [lipsmack] i don't actually get the standards and each state is different 

464.88 477.13 B: do you think that what what part of the problem within the u. s. states is that we might have to standardize for the entire u. s. so that we're able i mean if we look at great britain and which has different uh countries you look at 

476.96 482.34 B: canada which has different provinces and you look at china i'm only using countries that are real big 

479.70 480.59 A: uh-huh 

482.27 496.26 B: it seems like their standards are equivalent across the whole country i wonder if we need something like that here uh to be at least a national standard that hey at at the end of the third grade this is exactly where you should be 

487.12 488.15 A: (( yeah )) 

496.03 502.26 A: now you know i know um [lipsmack] in china you know their children go to school like six days a week there [noise] and 

502.49 507.58 A: you know they're a little harder on their children also there so i don't know 

507.94 514.89 A: i i i don't know how they test their children you know how they their their children i think are a little smarter in china 

515.14 524.37 A: you know as i look at you know i've i've read a lot of data on on their school system and how they teach their children you know so i don't know 

519.96 520.80 B: uh-huh 

524.26 526.84 B: well i've read a little bit myself so 

526.81 535.30 B: like i said and and like i know in great britain i have a friend that's over there and uh they have a standard for the whole country 

534.41 535.40 A: mhm 

535.23 544.82 B: you know and there's certain standards that they have to meet of course the other interesting thing is a public school is actually a private school over there too so go figure right 

542.15 542.97 A: mhm 

543.88 551.24 A: [lipsmack] yeah i know that's what i'm saying so i don't i it's got something to do with the um higher up too besides the teachers 

551.09 560.44 A: something to do with the people that in the school system too like the the other people that are running the school system also so they gotta deal with that too if if there's a difference in the uh 

560.42 567.42 A: different states of the standards of the kids because the children is just only being learnt what they they are being told you know 

567.03 568.13 B: right 

567.39 579.91 A: when you go to a state you you go to the school they teach you that that's what you know you're taught and you go to another state that's what you're taught so it's not that you know the child's fault if they're behind when they move to another state that's what they've been taught 

579.88 584.85 A: so i don't think you know some children do last learn faster than others i know that 

584.24 585.34 B: right 

584.70 595.96 A: but a lot of children they'll not be on the same level so you can't like look at where both eighth graders is on the same level one of 'em might be a faster learner than the other one that don't mean that the other one 

595.92 599.89 A: is not dumb or smart or whatever one of 'em might just pick up quicker than
