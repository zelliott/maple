39.23 40.47 B: really 

39.99 42.33 A: because uh

79.27 83.04 B: i always like when i was when i went to school um 

83.08 90.47 B: i went to ah a catholic school private school but i was always told that it was the public schools that had more of the resources 

90.44 104.34 B: um as far as like you know getting into a better college or what have you than the catholic schools did and the catholic school's more worked along the lines of like discipline and so forth you know but 

94.39 96.28 A: (( right )) 

103.22 109.55 A: well yo- you it might of been to save time but now it's you know it's pretty much equal i i know uh

113.18 114.39 A: sending

120.95 121.86 B: wow 

121.78 122.82 A: and uh 

122.83 130.83 A: but you know they they pay their teachers good they got the support of the parents and uh you know they have control of the class 

127.32 128.72 B: mhm 

130.35 132.12 B: mhm 

131.50 135.39 A: in that they not only just uh just teach uh 

135.76 137.66 A: yeah 

138.09 141.13 A: teach the kids but they they teach 'em how to learn 

141.44 142.41 B: right 

141.80 146.03 A: and uh in public school they don't have time to do that 

145.42 147.79 B: right right wow 

148.24 149.17 B: (( i )) 

149.64 153.76 B: are the so now on on a norm are the private school 

153.96 157.59 B: teachers are are they being paid more than say public school teachers 

157.13 163.70 A: yeah they're probably a little bit uh i'm not sure about the salary but i i i know that uh 

164.41 169.86 A: i've got some good friends of mine that uh their daughter has been teaching uh down here in the connor 

169.76 180.73 A: school system and they've had some of those that are teachers and helpers uh brought up on charges of you know sexual conduct with the kids 

170.98 171.88 B: (( ah huh )) 

180.36 181.48 B: wow 

180.91 185.86 A: and she she walked in the didn't know what to do 

185.73 186.65 B: uh-huh 

186.00 195.13 A: she was ready to quit and she got home that night the the private school she the christian school she used to ah teach at called her 

195.10 208.10 A: and said hey we want you back as a second grade teacher you ready to come she's like just sign the contract and they said well you got until the thirtieth of june to just like sign a letter of resignation to get out of that contract and uh 

208.50 210.40 A: and you're free of it 

209.70 210.63 B: uh-huh 

210.55 217.59 A: so she went in and signed her contract ah took her letter of resignation in uh and uh 

217.61 223.29 A: in september she goes and wo- back to work to the pri- at the private school where she used to work 

223.53 226.16 B: right wow 

225.08 232.35 A: and yeah and she's happy now but you know there's just so much going on in the in the public schools uh 

227.29 228.22 B: uh-huh 

231.99 233.40 B: right 

232.86 238.66 A: we we need to turn it back over to the local and get the government out of it and where they can teach 

239.28 244.09 B: yeah i i almost wonder if it you know if if if the public school system is 

244.16 246.54 B: is becoming out of control 

246.60 251.34 B: because of [mn] what children are learning at home 

250.92 253.82 A: i think i think that's part of it you know 

251.71 252.87 B: maybe 

253.01 265.76 B: yeah maybe their parents are letting them do whatever they like and they think when they go in there that you know that's how they coerce with adults or what have you and you know they just they they'll just you know run free you know 

264.83 271.66 A: yeah i think that's probably part of it ah we got too too many single parent homes and uh 

268.06 269.06 B: (( yeah )) 

271.16 273.26 B: right right 

272.80 283.25 A: and the a lot lot of the kids are either their mommas are trying to raise them and uh the kids are bigger than the mommas and they don't know what to do with them 

282.12 283.93 B: right 

284.82 288.25 B: yeah it's uh very interesting i can't i'm 

288.38 290.31 A: but but money won't fix 

290.93 293.81 B: right exactly exactly 

292.66 302.73 A: it and and that's that's the way they're trying to fix it wi- with the government involved is that they'll throw throw more money at it throw more money at it you know that ain't gonna fix the school system right uh-huh until 

302.31 308.85 B: right because you know now you know with what happened at columbine and kids bringing guns to school i mean 

308.47 309.74 A: (( maybe way after i graduated and now )) 

309.12 320.66 B: i mean when i was and i mean i've been out of high school for about a little over ten years and it's like i mean for someone to bring a gun to school it was like you've got to be kidding me you know it's like you know it wa- it was unheard 

320.33 321.74 A: (( it's you know it it's )) 

324.05 325.79 B: (( of i think )) 

327.43 333.10 A: (( it's just like [cough] you know bringing a book to school [laughter] you know well i i've been out of high school uh over forty years )) 

332.05 332.95 B: uh-huh 

333.47 334.21 B: (( mm )) 

333.80 344.62 A: and whe- when when i was growing up well if you got in sch- got in trouble at school the and you went home and daddy knew about it uh you got in more trouble at home 

343.98 346.06 B: right mm exactly 

347.34 349.76 A: and there's nothing wrong with discipline 

349.64 350.60 B: uh-huh 

351.45 360.53 A: and i think you know we gotta get get discipline back in the in the schools by yeah back in the home first and then in the schools and uh 

361.30 365.88 A: and then uh allow the teachers to to teach and take control of the classrooms 

365.67 367.49 B: right 

367.62 374.02 B: and that's the problem i mean the the the problem comes from lack of control and and it's it's uh i mean 

374.41 376.63 B: you know uh you 

377.21 378.45 B: it's 

378.91 382.02 B: it it's very hard to really discipline some someone if 

382.14 390.41 B: they don't do well in school i mean the only discipline and where it comes from is ah at home because you know the the teacher can't discipline forty students that don't want to learn 

386.60 387.98 A: right 

389.91 391.98 A: no there there's no way 

390.52 391.49 B: you know 

391.60 399.73 B: yeah it's you know almost i don't know if if if they should you know if if 

399.86 407.00 B: i don't know i you know it it's it's very hard because the state's hands are tied wha- what could they do about someone not wanting to learn 

406.91 413.96 A: well you you you probably heard what the te- texas legislation done uh yesterday or the day before 

413.16 414.08 B: no 

413.96 426.42 A: yeah the democrats wa- walked out of the legislative system because they didn't uh they didn't like the some of the some of the plans that the republicans was uh presenting to uh 

426.94 428.75 A: to finance the school system 

428.66 429.73 B: mhm 

429.10 440.71 A: so instead of say- uh staying there hashing it out and trying to solve it well they went to oklahoma so they don't have enough they don't have a quorum enough to uh to do business now 

440.90 442.32 B: (( hm )) 

442.40 443.37 A: (( i mean you )) 

444.63 456.09 A: you you can't throw money at at a at a problem and fix it you have to you have to get everybody working together and until they do well the public school system's just gonna keep on going down hill 

456.06 460.18 B: yeah i i i just wonder if i i mean 

460.49 463.87 B: i always thought of of of school as as if 

464.40 465.77 B: if you come from a 

466.38 470.69 B: if you had to take a sesame street mentality where they use entertainment to teach 

471.23 480.93 B: you know and i'm sure a lot of teachers ha- have have tried that and i'm sure you can't do that with every subject but i mean there there's you know there needs to there [mn] there needs to be a way 

480.98 490.17 B: psychologically to get into these kids' heads and and and to make them to make them want to know more yeah exactly [mn] 

483.51 484.91 A: that's right to 

485.96 487.69 A: make make them want to learn 

489.66 495.14 A: and uh some of the things that they have found that does work uh 

495.35 501.00 A: they take away from the teachers 'cause they say well everybody can't teach that way and everybody got to teach the same 

500.55 501.94 B: (( mhm )) 

501.65 505.48 A: and i don't agree with that you know if a teacher's got something that works uh 

505.51 510.43 A: show it to somebody else and say hey may- maybe that does work let me try it 

511.03 512.29 A: and uh 

512.89 514.92 A: let's get something going th- 

516.22 517.70 A: so as everybody can learn 

517.70 519.03 B: right [mn] 

519.19 522.57 A: but uh but you you you can't uh 

522.92 527.21 A: can't throw everybody in the same classroom and and teach to the 

527.23 533.52 A: to the slower student and expect the the brighter students to be satisfied 

533.21 535.72 B: right exactly 

535.76 536.85 B: (( i i )) 

535.92 537.19 A: yeah 

537.13 546.11 B: it's it's i don't know if if you show these kids examples i know when i was a kid and people'd say well if you don't get good grades you know you're 

545.88 555.35 B: you're going to be um i don't know you're going to be doing sort of lowly job in your life or what have you and you know which is not necessarily the case 

554.72 555.69 A: no 

555.29 562.58 B: you know [laughter] i mean you you could be a high school drop out and invest in real estate and have a million dollars in your bank account you know that's the 

556.15 557.70 A: (( yeah i )) 

561.33 567.64 A: you know i i wasn't a good student in high school but after i got out of high school and went in the air force and uh 

568.19 576.91 A: and got something i wanted to learn and that's what they was there for was was to teach us to do a job that was being trained for 

576.16 577.50 B: mhm 

577.01 578.51 A: and it makes a difference 

578.12 579.43 B: mhm 

579.05 582.52 A: and i've been to a lot lot of different trade schools and uh 

583.69 592.49 A: thi- this is where you're learning this and this is the way you do it and this and and you learn it with the hands on experience then you learn something 

588.86 589.81 B: mhm 

591.89 599.95 B: yeah i i think it but you see of course now that's after high school an- and after high school everyone has their choices as as 

596.30 597.29 A: right
