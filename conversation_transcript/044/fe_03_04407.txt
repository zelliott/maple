0.00 1.54 A: hello 

0.88 2.03 B: hello 

2.10 3.81 A: hi my name is jim 

4.13 5.56 B: and you're from where yeah 

5.55 7.55 A: i'm in ah minnesota 

7.66 9.80 B: i'm larry i'm in maine 

9.65 10.99 A: oh hi larry 

11.60 14.43 A: [laughter] how's it going 

11.66 12.73 B: [laughter] 

13.10 16.41 B: i think oh pretty well and with yourself 

16.34 17.86 A: just fine 

17.98 19.73 B: interesting topic 

19.78 26.40 A: now as i understand it this anonymous benefactor gives us a million dollars on one condition 

26.59 29.96 A: and the condition is that we can never speak to our friends again 

29.56 30.98 B: our best friend 

30.90 32.82 A: our best friend 

31.72 34.92 B: yeah that's that's [laughter] my understanding of it 

34.20 37.13 A: okay okay that sounds right then 

37.69 40.32 B: yeah well i think i would probably refuse it 

40.84 43.24 A: yeah 

41.58 43.07 B: [laughter] 

43.72 48.23 A: we'd have to give up one person or best friend okay well 

46.25 47.07 B: yeah 

48.24 51.35 B: i don't think you could put a price tag on friendship so 

48.43 49.39 A: (( ah )) 

51.08 54.04 A: right i think i really 

52.84 58.62 B: a million dollars won't go far in this day and age so [laughter] 

55.85 59.73 A: [laughter] right there you go 

59.97 66.18 A: well i think i would ah agree with you i think i would do i think i would not take the money either 

66.85 75.60 A: i mean i was just spending a little time this afternoon with my best friend and i would not want to give that person up for a million dollars 

74.97 80.95 B: well yeah i have several that i think were worth that much to me so [mn] 

80.16 82.14 A: well right 

81.50 87.52 B: i i just can't imagine putting a price tag on it i mean how how can you put on a price tag on a friendship 

84.25 85.64 A: yeah 

87.44 88.36 A: no 

87.69 90.86 B: especially people that have been life long friends you know i 

89.73 90.29 A: (( [mn] )) 

90.66 93.06 A: yeah 

91.00 92.25 B: (( mean [laughter] )) 

93.23 98.40 A: now have you lived in the same area for some time so you were able to establish long term friendships 

98.18 101.23 B: ah yeah i actually live 

101.24 104.17 B: very close to where i grew up ah 

103.22 104.24 A: uh-huh 

104.54 108.51 B: not where i was born i was born in ah massachusetts but 

108.29 109.62 A: (( mhm )) 

109.00 115.95 B: my ah parents are both maine natives and they migrated back home not too long after i was born so 

111.80 112.86 A: oh yeah 

115.62 117.17 A: oh yeah 

116.50 128.52 B: i've been in the area since i was three years old so [laughter] that's right yeah and you do you establish some pretty solid connections in that period of time i think 

119.52 123.29 A: that's a life time [laughter] that's a life time you bet 

123.89 124.77 A: yeah 

128.18 129.21 A: (( yes )) 

129.60 132.13 A: ah how old are you now may i ask 

131.22 132.37 B: fifty three 

132.20 133.78 A: okay i'm fifty one 

133.54 134.40 B: uh-huh 

134.58 139.09 A: and my situation was different growing up we moved around a lot 

139.54 142.73 A: but you know i've been able to make friends and then my 

143.04 146.33 A: location i went to high school around here 

146.38 151.36 A: and since i've come back to this area this part of minnesota um 

151.57 157.36 A: i have family and friends in this area and like you say they would be priceless 

156.74 159.89 B: well that's that's the way i see it and 

158.93 161.05 A: yeah 

160.36 165.10 B: the other thing that i see as you get older you you add to your circle of friends 

164.86 166.24 A: mhm 

165.59 166.95 B: (( so )) 

166.73 168.42 A: it keeps getting wider 

168.18 175.38 B: ah yeah yeah and it might be that the person that's your best friend today might not be your very best friend ten years from now 

168.98 169.96 A: mhm 

175.34 176.47 A: mhm 

175.77 183.55 B: but nevertheless ah i would envision that the person that's my best friend today would still be a very good friend ten years from now 

183.29 184.51 A: yeah 

183.84 185.21 B: so 

184.96 186.71 A: mhm mhm 

186.07 188.74 B: (( i i don't see how you could put a price tag on it )) 

188.51 189.35 A: (( yes )) 

189.90 191.64 A: very interesting 

190.63 193.49 B: [mn] well i wouldn't be willing to let's put it that way 

193.19 194.41 A: right 

194.66 207.44 A: and you know if a person was in desperate financial straights that might be a different story or at least i'd have to think twice about it but still i don't see how it would be worth it 

206.84 211.14 B: well you've in- you've raised interesting food for thought on that one but 

210.98 212.65 A: yeah 

211.24 216.90 B: [mn] i i still don't think it would be because i think a good friend would stand by you thick and thin anyway 

216.62 221.29 A: mhm mhm yep yeah that's the definition of a friend in my book 

220.39 222.37 B: that's right absolutely 

221.43 223.72 A: yes indeed 

223.80 232.28 A: yeah you know i wonder what these studies are about 'cause it doesn't seem like it would be the topic itself but rather how people interact 

232.27 233.27 B: (( ah )) 

234.30 240.02 B: we enquired about that a while ago and ah linguistics is what they're studying 

236.24 237.38 A: oh did ya 

239.83 241.81 A: i see yes 

240.54 244.11 B: and what component of linguistics 

244.61 246.12 A: (( mhm )) 

245.08 249.79 B: is unclear to us i think i think it has something to do with trying to 

246.75 247.71 A: okay 

250.07 251.04 B: (( ah )) 

251.14 254.61 B: perfect voice for recording 

254.61 255.77 A: oh 

254.79 259.03 B: for for people that have ah difficulty with oral communication 

259.01 260.13 A: uh-huh 

259.95 265.20 B: and i think maybe they're trying to develop some kind of a a voice recording 

265.19 266.13 A: (( mhm )) 

266.15 267.96 B: that will interpret 

268.55 272.69 B: ah speech from different areas or different regions of the country 

272.34 273.72 A: i see 

273.73 281.51 B: ah i know i've always been told that middle america has the the finest speech and if you want somebody to 

281.87 289.98 B: ah get a message across to all corners of the country you pick somebody from middle middle america to do it because every corner of the country would understand them 

289.79 290.84 A: (( mhm )) 

290.37 297.23 B: whereas if you take somebody like me that's on the north east [laughter] corner of the globe and i try to talk with somebody from texas 

295.23 295.82 A: (( [laughter] )) 

297.01 298.24 A: yeah 

297.50 300.31 B: they might not have a clue what i'm talking about 

299.83 300.96 A: yes 

300.36 305.50 B: [laughter] so i think dialect i think factors into it too 

301.76 303.49 A: well to my ear 

305.29 306.40 A: (( yes )) 

306.67 314.75 A: um now to my ear you have what i would call i guess a a bit of a maine accent but no trouble understanding you 

314.94 320.82 A: i lived ah at one point in my life in ah georgia for several years 

320.84 327.27 A: and there i really did stand out with my speech and there were times i mean it was a very different dialect 

326.97 328.02 B: oh sure 

327.69 340.28 A: down there and you know it does seem like ah newscasters and radio announcers and so on go for a kind of generic pronunciation and enunciation and so on 

338.33 339.18 B: right 

339.79 342.00 B: articulate very very clearly 

341.79 346.36 A: yeah right and in that sense i see their point but then 

342.28 343.01 B: yeah 

346.73 355.69 A: you know regional colors ah i think are still important too that's where many word variations come from and turns of phrase so 

353.26 354.25 B: oh sure 

356.15 366.23 A: you know ah while you were describing what you learned about the study it made me think of voice resig- recognition software or something like that it could be they're trying to improve that 

365.62 369.85 B: i think that may be factoring into it somewhere ah 

368.38 371.54 A: oh yes right 

370.08 373.97 B: i know my wife has a computer that you can talk into and ah 

373.21 375.73 A: oh yeah 

374.30 377.65 B: yeah you ju- you speak into it and it will print out a letter or 

377.29 378.45 A: oh my 

378.15 379.92 B: it will ah print out 

378.79 383.95 A: mhm 

380.50 382.49 B: an email message etcetera 

382.58 390.19 B: and ah it's it's a pretty nice arrangement now i can't talk into it and have it do the same thing because it's used to her voice and not used to mine 

389.90 393.25 A: yeah it's kind of a training that yes 

391.53 392.30 B: right 

393.79 396.37 B: we can train it for me 

393.85 394.83 A: (( yes )) 

395.90 396.97 A: uh-huh 

397.04 405.55 B: but i i have no idea how long that will take every time she uses it it becomes more accustomed to her voice so it becomes more proficient 

401.07 402.15 A: mhm 

402.68 405.28 A: (( yes right )) 

405.43 406.83 A: (( yes )) 

405.77 408.71 B: and i think it's a pretty amazing programme ah 

408.22 410.85 A: definitely yeah 

408.85 414.80 B: [laughter] i have an idea that this study has something to do with you know perfecting that further [mn] 

414.58 415.75 A: okay 

415.80 417.85 A: see that would make a lot of sense then 

417.70 419.51 B: (( oh sure absolutely uh-huh )) 

417.90 419.02 A: (( yes )) 

419.25 422.86 A: yeah 'cause um see i work with computers it's 

423.04 431.05 A: it's kind of my livelihood and right now i'm a graduate student doing some some more advanced work and that's what i want to go back to 

431.54 441.51 A: what i do is mapping with computers but i understand some of the problems with voice recognition software is that there are so many different accents 

441.85 449.37 A: and if they can come up with the more generalized procedure or programme that could recognize 

449.45 458.37 A: ah you know the meaning behind various pronunciations i think that's been the hangup so far in making that widely ah popular 

457.84 459.60 B: i think that's correct yeah 

459.07 462.35 A: mhm mhm 

460.28 462.90 B: and maybe that's what they're attempting to do here 

463.01 465.07 A: that's very interesting 

464.41 473.32 B: my son just got a degree in management information systems unfortunately he's probably two years late he missed the y2k glitch so [laughter] 

468.31 469.60 A: mhm 

472.90 476.18 A: oh there's going to be plenty to do and more and more every day 

476.30 477.57 A: (( i think )) 

477.15 485.85 B: (( well i hope you're right he hasn't had any luck finding a job and he's he's been out of school ah he graduated in october of ah )) 

480.74 481.45 A: (( yeah )) 

487.16 489.86 B: (( zero one i guess it would have been )) 

489.59 490.78 A: oh my 

491.78 496.24 A: well i still think computers will be more and more part of every day life 

496.19 497.47 B: oh i do too 

497.15 498.19 A: sure 

498.45 504.90 B: but ah the networking of them i think [laughter] you know i think that's where the demand is going down and 

498.59 500.00 A: and 

505.14 508.50 A: yeah well the internet bubble kind of burst for a while 

507.90 508.72 B: right 

508.91 512.51 A: but i think that was largely short sightedness and ah 

512.72 519.19 A: honestly poor business practices you know they gave up on a lot of the basic busin- business sense 

519.21 522.12 A: in throwing money at any sort of internet scheme 

522.40 526.38 A: and you know dog food on line may not be the best idea after all 

525.91 530.94 B: [mn] [laughter] i agree i agree a hundred percent with what you're saying 

526.95 529.01 A: you know so 

529.15 532.89 A: and so that's crashed under it's own weight i think but the 

531.93 533.35 B: [laughter] 

532.83 544.73 A: the yeah the basic need for ah as you say network communication and improving commun- computer communication that need i think is as strong as ever 

545.41 552.54 B: well i believe it is but ah i also believe that if a company hires somebody like him 

547.60 549.39 A: mhm 

552.38 554.89 A: mhm 

552.80 553.94 B: (( ah )) 

554.25 556.82 B: you know that there are it's an expense 

556.84 559.79 B: that's not probably paying for itself 

557.11 558.25 A: mhm 

560.10 565.35 B: so i think the economy the economic climate probably has factored into 

560.18 561.23 A: well 

564.91 566.03 A: yes 

565.48 568.51 B: ah a depletion of some of those jobs 

568.09 570.74 A: yeah it is more conservative ah 

570.90 577.05 A: i think environment in ah the economics these days 

577.65 587.19 A: but still the need will be there and if a you know a company can look at even just a couple of years down the road then they would see it as a good investment i believe 

588.07 598.05 B: well i hope so i hope it turns around a little bit for for his sake because [laughter] i mean he's he's really into it and he was really discouraged that he couldn't find employment in his field 

589.08 590.08 A: yeah 

591.45 592.67 A: (( yes )) 

593.99 594.72 A: (( mm )) 

595.27 596.32 A: (( yes )) 

597.78 598.98 A: yeah 

598.58 599.89 B: (( and ah you know he's ))
