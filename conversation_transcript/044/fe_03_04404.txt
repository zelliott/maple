2.33 3.81 A: hi i'm danny 

3.93 5.34 B: (( hey danny how're you doing )) 

5.06 6.51 A: hey gerald what's going on 

6.39 11.25 B: not much man so what would you do if you ah won dollars and you and couldn't talk to anybody 

11.43 17.79 A: um that's tough one fortunately i'm successful i own my own business 

17.90 24.96 A: so i don't know that i would jump at the you know ah million dollars to get to not talk to my best friend 

25.08 29.00 A: then on the other hand they always say friends are here today and gone tomorrow 

28.93 29.74 B: yeah 

29.63 31.42 A: so i don't know what would you do 

31.74 36.27 B: ah i don't know i think well friendship's a little more valuable than 

36.30 38.09 B: so you know 

38.63 47.19 B: you you look at it and it's like you can pretty much have anything you want at your disposal but you know i don't know human reactions are a little more bit more k- 

47.22 58.01 A: right that's what i'm saying i mean it's easy to sit there and say why you can do this you can do that but in today's day and age and at my age a million dollars really isn't going to last a whole lifetime 

47.28 48.61 B: than anything else 

57.89 63.89 A: and ah by the time they get done so i don't know i think the friendship is more important 

57.91 58.81 B: yeah

78.23 80.69 B: oh that's damn right man for real 

80.59 94.02 A: i guess you know in in the long term i guess i would ah definitely probably keep my friend the more i would talk about it i would just stay in touch with my friends and pass on the million dollars although when they say a million dollars it still sounds like so much but when you break it down and ah 

80.84 81.63 B: (( so [laughter] ))

404.48 405.56 B: (( and ah )) 

405.51 416.17 B: he ah he was like well you know i'll i'll make a lot of money off the the referral but you get ten dollars if you make this phone call i was like what i just can't just call it we'll call you up at a like at the time that you say and then 

409.66 413.23 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

416.06 425.17 B: you know you just agreed and do the topic and just talk to somebody i was like shit i'll do it i'll do it even when we're drinking he said all right that's cool so i was like yeah shit man [laughter] 

421.95 436.85 A: right yeah who gives a shit right that's what my friend said to me i'm like he said it helps you out i said i don't care i said you get credit for anything yeah he said he'll get ten bucks i'm like if i'm allowed to do it i don't care that you do it have them call me and that was it 

435.74 437.44 B: [laughter] 

436.90 438.34 A: that was it so 

437.87 445.12 B: that is fucking awesome dude yeah so i don't know exactly what they're doing i think it's a government thing that they're doing [laughter] 

444.20 449.05 A: (( i think they're just trying to i don't know how are you what testing voices )) 

448.86 454.63 B: actually i think so i think that's what it could be because ah you know they give you a topic but you don't have to stay on it 

454.44 461.90 A: right i was just won- i was just wondering that we were breaking the rules 'cause we've been talking about everything else but the topic but i don't think you have to stay on 

455.08 455.91 B: right 

459.52 460.86 B: right i mean 

461.93 472.50 B: no no i think they want to see because ah obviously we both have our our different accents you can tell we're from different parts of the country so they're either trying to identify it that way i don't know 

466.49 472.37 A: (( it right )) 

472.48 484.85 A: right 'cause i know even him i know he they told me that when his wife had called up they had said that th- the introduction when it first started they wanted to test you know test different accents 

472.66 474.12 B: so yeah it's it's 

481.18 481.98 B: yeah 

484.66 494.70 A: from all over like you know spanish accents and everything else and they said that they had tried it numerous times but people would hang up because they couldn't even understand each other 

494.67 495.78 B: no shit 

495.13 504.57 A: and now he said i think they broke it down whereas you know like and those like we'll talk and then different people will talk but they can still keep it going because the survey wasn't working 

504.36 514.49 A: 'cause they would get a guy let's say with my accent but then some guy with a spanish accent or whatever accent i couldn't even understand the guy how could you talk to him for ten minutes for the survey to work 

508.75 510.23 B: (( oh yeah )) 

513.85 515.87 B: (( exactly yeah it's yeah )) 

514.77 518.88 A: so this state you know they let you know what goes on pretty much and ah 

519.09 519.95 B: huh 

519.32 521.08 A: that was it this 

520.26 524.14 B: so what what is this your first time getting on the phone call i guess not huh 

524.03 526.19 A: this this is the first time i've got this 

527.36 529.99 B: yeah okay okay 'cause i'm wondering if they 

528.50 530.71 A: so how about yourself is this your first time 

530.48 537.33 B: yeah yeah yeah i'm just wondering if they they're going to referee us and say hey you know come [laughter] your ten minutes is up or you know 

534.86 535.94 A: [laughter] 

536.66 541.46 A: but i mean they're recording it obviously they're recording but like you said you don't have to stay on the topic 

541.95 547.88 A: about it like so what would you do with the million dollars this way at least we we can at least talk about that again 

541.99 542.81 B: yeah 

545.37 545.97 B: (( yeah ah w- )) 

547.67 551.87 B: well ah ah i guess if i had a million dollars without that stipulation 

549.85 555.79 A: i know if they if they they gave you the million dollars you'd you'd give up your friend what would you do with the money 

553.59 554.97 B: yeah i mean 

555.17 560.53 B: yeah i mean if i if if i had to give up my friend and i still had a million dollars i think i'd i think i'd like 

560.73 572.49 B: cut a little half or or cut cut a little bit for myself to buy the things i've always wanted you know just get you know i hate to be mat- materialistic but you know i've i'm i'm a grad student i'm poor there's certain things i'd like to have 

564.88 566.83 A: right 

572.38 574.06 A: right definitely 

572.81 581.71 B: but um you know a- other than that i'd probably try to ah try to invest it i guess i mean that's probably the first thing i'd research some investments and see what i what i can do with it 

580.57 584.26 A: right and and how old 

581.84 582.67 B: so 

583.31 584.63 B: ah excuse me 

584.31 585.34 A: how old are you
