95.18 96.95 B: yeah that's a good style 

96.36 101.86 A: yeah ah that's one of my favorites i guess as far as comedy goes [mn] jay leno for the most part's pretty good 

102.24 104.15 B: i don't stay up that late 

103.69 106.45 A: oh don't you [laughter] okay 

105.09 107.50 B: no [laughter]

111.61 116.68 A: i i don't always see him but you know i usually fall asleep to him [laughter] 

116.19 122.71 B: yeah are there any particular like movies or anything that you've watched that have offended you 

128.13 131.53 A: isn't that movie jackass supposed to be a comedy 

131.69 136.66 B: oh yeah that one's pretty bad that's a draw the line type thing 

136.11 137.63 A: yeah yeah 

137.37 140.62 B: and you almost kind of want to watch it because these people like do 

140.92 146.02 B: amazingly stupid harmful things to themselves and it's like 

147.27 153.14 B: somebody in the circus doing that it's like you're almost drawn to see it but it's so horrible 

149.23 150.17 A: well 

152.56 164.83 A: yeah yeah and we just had somebody here dive off of a [mn] ah some kids we saw it on the news yesterday [mn] ah diving off of a five storey building into a swimming pool 

164.91 167.36 A: and one of the kids shattered their legs 

165.31 166.38 B: (( oh r- )) 

167.38 170.64 A: 'cause they missed the pool they got hit the edge 

167.72 168.48 B: oh 

171.25 175.59 A: [mn] so you know that's when it gets dangerous that's wrong 

174.67 175.94 B: yeah 

176.08 180.41 A: or if it offends somebody i mean like offends somebody like racial or that type of thing 

180.94 190.10 B: yeah yeah definitely but then a lot of people take themselves too seriously too and they get [mn] i think offended at things that weren't really meant to be 

190.94 192.10 B: taken in 

192.60 205.28 B: like they weren't i mean some people do make fun of people or some people say something that they think is funny and they don't think it would affect someone but it does [mn] i mean some people don't even realise it but and then 

201.92 202.84 A: yeah 

204.23 204.94 A: yeah 

205.38 209.61 B: some people though [mn] i think are overly sensitive 

209.19 210.48 A: [mn] that's true 

210.72 213.65 A: [mn] i i agree with that one hundred percent um 

213.96 222.53 A: [mn] i i have two sons that fit into each example one is overly sensitive the other one [mn] is a total comedian and cut up and ah [mn] 

222.72 227.38 A: often goes overboard without realising it [laughter] yeah [laughter] 

225.51 226.63 B: oh really 

227.65 237.52 B: well there's and yeah a lot of people and you know a lot of people will um when they're feeling defensive or scared will use 

236.37 237.43 A: mhm 

237.56 238.96 B: ah humor 

239.39 249.39 B: as um you know a way to overcome that and then they they're so worrying about what's going on that they don't think about what they're saying and they wind up hurting somebody's feelings 

246.69 247.48 A: yep 

248.82 250.00 A: i agree 

250.80 251.71 B: (( so )) 

251.66 255.03 A: sad but true but that's j- just the way some people react 

255.11 256.59 B: right right 

255.63 259.89 A: i don't think you can stop that you know at least movies and that type of thing we can 

259.91 265.15 A: [mn] shut off i can't stand ro- rodney dangerfield to me he's one of the most obnoxious 

265.21 266.37 B: [laughter] 

265.68 267.97 A: [mn] comedians i've ever seen in my life 

268.04 272.18 B: yeah i- i've never watched him but some of the comedians 

270.55 274.28 A: [mn] roger rodney dangerfield he's a stand up comedian type you know 

273.74 277.55 B: oh i know who he is i know who he is i've just never actually watched him 

276.96 281.21 A: [mn] that's probably why [laughter] [laughter] 

279.13 280.15 B: yeah 

281.15 284.15 B: but and you know too though i mean there are some people 

285.36 288.11 B: that like kind of [mn] 

288.65 290.43 B: like did you ever hear of martin lawrence 

290.75 292.06 A: mm i don't think so 

291.23 298.67 B: he's black he's a black comedian he has had a couple of t._v. shows he's done a couple of movies [mn] and he's done some stand up things and he 

298.78 301.92 B: he makes fun of black people 

302.50 303.63 B: [mn] and it's 

303.85 305.45 B: and he does it 

306.19 319.29 B: and i guess some people would be upset about it because he he he kind of it's not that he puts them down but he makes fun of their their their tactics and the way that they act and you know just the way that they talk 

317.39 319.70 A: and he gets away with it because he's black himself 

319.89 320.91 B: right 

320.55 321.45 A: yeah 

321.13 331.32 B: so and that it and it's like it's funny though people don't really take offen- offence at that but if it were a white person talking about a black person then they'd probably get upset about 

330.72 332.03 A: yeah 

332.08 333.94 A: yeah it's kind of amazing isn't it 

333.97 335.19 B: (( it yeah )) 

334.59 335.60 A: [laughter] 

335.44 339.56 B: it's a very fine line there's not any black and white it's very gray 

339.34 340.64 A: that's for sure 

341.08 344.40 A: [mn] they tend to give us fine lines on these [laughter] 

344.60 346.49 B: yeah 

347.24 349.92 B: hm what else to talk about [laughter] 

349.09 352.70 A: i'm trying to think of something else i'm trying to think of some other comedians oh 

352.79 358.85 A: oh i love tom hanks of course he's everything he's more than one comedian whoopee gold- goldberg 

354.95 356.58 B: yeah he's really good 

358.95 360.80 B: mhm 

359.24 363.34 A: [mn] to me she's just the essence because she 

363.46 366.95 A: brings comedy into some real touchy subjects and just 

367.26 370.04 A: [mn] does an excellent job of it 

370.05 373.41 B: how do you feel about do you ever watch the show will and grace 

373.37 381.70 A: [mn] you know i've kinda have seen it a couple of times [mn] i'm more into movies and you know we have showtime like eleven channels of it [mn] 

381.29 382.27 B: (( oh )) 

381.75 385.21 A: i tend to watch movies rather than sitcoms huh 

383.02 388.32 B: you don't have cable we have the we have the basic cable so we don't get any of those movies 

388.05 392.75 A: ah well they had a deal on showtime you could subscribe for five dollars a month 

388.90 389.66 B: [laughter] 

392.58 393.46 B: ah 

392.77 396.82 A: [mn] and we get on digital we get like eleven channels so 

397.16 401.14 B: well i was just wondering what your thoughts were 'cause a lot of the show is based on um 

401.25 402.72 B: (( people that are gay )) 

402.79 403.89 A: on on what 

404.25 405.57 A: people that are gay 

404.45 405.89 B: people that are gay 

405.98 409.25 B: (( or what is it heterosexual or homosexual )) 

408.51 409.77 A: homosexuals 

410.25 411.50 B: is that when they 

411.71 413.35 B: prefer the same sex 

412.78 413.94 A: yeah 

413.44 419.40 B: i don't even kn- i don't know the technical terms but and then he and and it's funny 'cause the show 

415.31 416.79 A: yeah that's homosexuals 

419.51 425.15 B: i mean like two of the main characters are gay and it makes fun of gay people 

422.79 423.54 A: (( ahah )) 

425.23 429.48 B: [mn] but the real actors aren't really gay but everybody is like okay 

429.22 430.40 A: yeah 

430.26 431.75 B: like people don't 

432.53 440.36 B: like give the show a bad rap or anything i mean i thought that was funny that actors portraying gay people can make fun of gay people [mn] 

440.45 442.52 B: and they don't get offended by that 

440.45 443.22 A: well just like the black guy making fun of black people 

443.29 446.30 B: [mn] right but the thing is he actually is black 

445.88 447.72 A: yeah that's a different ball game 

448.28 456.56 B: and ah [mn] it just surprises me sometimes that they can get away 'cause some of the things that they say are pretty bad like and that's what sometimes makes it funny 

453.32 454.41 A: oh really 

456.15 456.94 A: yeah 

456.68 460.59 B: but maybe if you were gay it would upset you 

461.73 463.33 B: i mean it's hard to say 

461.74 464.45 A: i don't know i'm not so i wouldn't know [laughter] 

463.99 464.93 B: (( yeah i )) 

465.11 469.47 B: just i mean i don't know if you've ever watched anything like that has that ever offended you 

469.54 473.97 B: like even not not being gay it's just hearing that kind of talk 

473.79 480.71 A: it it doesn't offend me unless it would get to the point where i felt really it it wasn't done in comedy it was done in 

474.35 475.17 B: (( [mn] )) 

481.41 483.14 A: (( [mn] you know i i am )) 

483.33 489.57 A: very against racism or any kind of of prejudice type things like that and and um 

488.93 490.11 B: mhm 

489.84 491.59 A: i prefer not to 

491.66 496.87 A: hurt people's feelings if possible in situations like that [mn] um 

494.22 495.04 B: yeah 

497.34 505.02 A: it doesn't mean you can always do it but [mn] if it if it gets to the point where people's feelings are getting hurt then it's wrong 

505.31 509.80 A: and you know people like [mn] rodney dangerfield that's all they do phyllis diller is another one [mn] 

505.32 506.20 B: right 

510.04 511.89 A: (( you know they're just really into )) 

512.04 513.33 A: cut cut cut 

513.81 515.71 B: yeah 

516.24 522.25 B: and a lot of times they think it makes them funny but some other people just think it makes them se- seem like mean people 

522.08 524.73 A: yeah that's that's how i feel about 'em 

525.19 528.93 A: [mn] ah i just [mn] don't enjoy it at all [mn] 

525.22 526.39 B: yeah 

528.66 530.05 B: yeah 

530.15 531.99 A: but i know there are people who do 

532.31 535.88 B: yeah there's a lot of people that do and i think a lot of people that 

534.06 534.96 A: yeah 

535.89 538.26 B: you know they'll make fun of other people to 

538.75 541.69 B: kind of mask over their own insecurities 

542.13 546.51 A: [mn] i'm more apt to make fun of myself than i am of someone else [laughter] 

542.68 544.25 B: you know and they'll they'll make 

546.73 556.43 B: well yeah everybody's different i mean some people will do that they'll make fun of themselves or they'll make fun of other people to kind of as a way of [mn] 

556.50 560.09 B: like hiding their true colors or something or just i don't 

558.46 559.50 A: yeah 

561.93 563.09 B: know but then 

563.39 569.96 B: they kinda get out of hand and end up hurting somebody's feelings and things have gone a little too far 

570.13 571.10 A: mhm 

570.61 572.62 B: and they never realize they're doing it 

572.58 574.77 A: [mn] i think that's true in a lot of cases 

575.90 581.13 A: it just ah gets beyond what they're capable of of bringing back to a 

581.81 583.52 A: [mn] non ah 

583.95 585.15 A: offensive 

585.52 587.32 B: (( yeah )) 

587.41 591.66 B: can you imagine though the people that get paid to write all the 

592.00 594.88 B: comedic lines and 

595.04 597.87 B: you know the shows and the movies and 

597.53 599.89 A: oh yeah it's gotta be a hu-
