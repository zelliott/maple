118.76 127.18 A: mhm well i think the reason that the younger kids think it's funny though is because i mean the adults we've allowed this to happen 

127.11 128.65 B: right well 

127.50 131.39 A: for it to be on television and for the kids to hear this 

131.25 132.19 B: right 

131.97 134.91 A: so we're kind of responsible for it 

132.25 133.11 B: right 

134.90 135.91 B: well i 

135.17 138.86 A: (( and i don't i don't know that there's a lot we could do about it but )) 

135.98 136.91 B: it 

138.88 147.26 B: it- it's sad it really is sad because ah you know i mean i don't even laugh at that stuff because it- it's you know i don't even see the humor in it 

140.38 141.10 A: yeah

168.04 175.54 A: i wish we i could put a stop to that but i'm not i'm not gonna pay to put a stop to it and that's the way most of it is 

173.60 174.48 B: right 

175.38 176.88 B: right right 

176.24 177.14 A: so

238.52 240.46 B: right that's true 

239.57 243.00 A: kids find a lot of things funny and they'll just laugh 

242.65 243.78 B: that's true 

243.67 247.31 A: so but they need to have more 

247.29 260.72 A: go back to like the ah jerry lewis show or the bob hope show with the clean laughter jokes you know i don't either i think it's um

387.80 389.60 A: mhm well 

389.84 404.61 A: yeah it is it is and i really feel like that it's the older generation's fault for allowing this to be published and for allowing it to be on television and of course 

391.31 393.40 B: very bad right 

403.42 409.70 B: but you know in our day and obviously we're in the same day i can tell [lipsmack] ah there were morals 

406.80 407.99 A: yeah 

409.86 411.32 A: oh yeah 

409.97 412.10 B: and today there aren't 

411.97 413.23 A: yeah no 

412.19 416.85 B: and i mean we had principles and we just had some kind of dignity but today they don't 

416.43 418.01 A: they don't that's 

417.13 421.31 B: and what we know is wrong to them it's not wrong and they don't care 

420.51 424.25 A: right yeah i don't know where it got off track but 

421.45 422.28 B: (( a- )) 

423.27 437.98 B: well they took prayer out of schools and they decided that god died and there was no more religious teaching of the lord and i think that had a big bearing on it that now people [mn] think there's nothing wrong with ah homosexuality 'cause that's okay and ah 

425.86 426.45 A: (( [mn] )) 

430.20 431.25 A: yeah 

436.22 437.02 A: (( [mn] )) 

437.79 443.65 A: well because they have it on television on a lot of those ah sitcom things they have you know 

441.79 442.64 B: right 

443.20 447.60 B: very acceptable thing today but it's very wrong [laughter] 

444.47 445.98 A: yeah 

446.65 448.26 A: yeah it is 

447.69 449.80 B: and it's not funny not 

448.88 461.95 A: well it's it's wrong to flaunt it i think on television so that when it's the younger kids are watching this and they think it's all right and that's where they're getting all of this from 

458.37 466.69 B: oh definitely everything's all right oh i know that's right media television magazines everything 

462.47 465.40 A: (( you know yeah sure )) 

465.79 475.08 A: all of this is a taught or learned ah behavior or habit 'cause they sure [mn] didn't have it when they came into the world 

474.29 484.43 B: that's right and we did try to teach them different but you know they went [mn] they went with the media it was too much stronger than us t._v. media [mn] the kids at school and ah 

475.39 477.08 A: (( so yeah )) 

477.49 478.26 A: yeah 

480.30 481.26 A: yeah
