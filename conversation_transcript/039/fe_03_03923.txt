0.60 2.46 A: hi my name is sharon 

2.32 4.36 B: um hi i'm makita 

4.70 5.63 A: hi 

6.11 7.33 B: how are you 

7.18 8.23 A: fine 

8.88 16.66 B: um i guess we're supposed to talk about comedy and how we draw the line um between offensive and non offensive comedy 

8.94 9.50 A: (( [mn] )) 

16.37 17.56 A: right 

17.64 18.45 A: um 

17.84 20.98 B: um i'm not quite sure how to start it [laughter] [mn] 

20.39 23.37 A: i'm not either i'm wondering if they mean um 

23.40 29.03 A: how we stop it if we feel offensive or if we just what we think is offensive and what isn't 

29.76 31.65 A: did you understand the question 

29.85 30.81 B: yeah 

31.83 36.32 B: it was pretty vague i [mn] i don't know 

33.62 34.33 A: (( [laughter] )) 

36.62 37.80 B: um 

38.15 42.62 B: i guess it's whatever we make it out to be i don't know 

41.86 42.84 A: right 

43.31 45.90 A: um okay how i would draw the line 

46.02 51.54 A: between offensive and non offensive i know i get emails sent to me um 

52.55 55.22 A: and some of 'em are forwarded on 

55.32 56.39 B: mhm 

55.85 58.88 A: and those sometimes can be irritating um 

59.31 63.54 A: i guess it depends on who sends it to you and what they think funny is 

62.93 63.99 B: (( right you )) 

63.62 64.72 A: (( but ah )) 

66.30 72.49 B: know i think a lot of times it really depends on the context in which it was told to you 

72.84 73.98 B: um 

74.14 76.33 A: (( ah yeah i i see what you mean )) 

74.15 75.24 B: you know 

76.42 81.18 B: um you know i can hear the same joke from two different people and just depending 

81.17 94.85 B: on how they deliver it um where like what type of person they are you know what their perception is of me what their perception is of the person the joke is targeted to [mn] i- it really affects 

82.46 83.72 A: (( exactly )) 

92.33 93.30 A: right 

95.33 99.88 B: you know how i would perceive it if i would think it was offensive if it wasn't 

99.53 102.52 A: yeah and to be o- offensive isn't just 

102.69 110.46 A: something that's rude and crude but it could be you know bigoted and and something like that and i get really really tired of hearing 

110.76 111.72 B: (( [laughter] )) 

111.37 113.19 A: (( those [mn] really )) 

111.91 112.92 B: yeah 

113.14 115.09 B: actually you know 

115.25 116.61 B: the whole 

116.71 124.13 B: racial differences thing has been like the subject of so many different movies i think the latest one is bringing down the house [mn] [mn] 

123.88 126.38 A: oh with steve martin 

126.40 136.66 B: yeah yeah yeah it gets a little tiring you know [mn] and you know i i can tell you that you know i am an african american woman 

130.89 131.59 A: (( right [mn] )) 

136.26 137.19 A: (( ahah )) 

136.79 137.99 B: and 

137.76 141.27 A: and that was offensive to you that that kind of comedy 

139.95 144.94 B: you know i didn't see it but i heard from a couple of people that they were 

144.70 145.63 A: (( ahah )) 

144.97 147.00 B: offended by it 

147.24 148.14 B: you know 

147.81 151.75 A: would it be because of stereotyping or or just that they're 

152.07 152.79 A: [mn] 

153.45 155.69 B: (( you know it's a little of both )) 

154.08 158.52 A: making fun of something that just that is just getting old 

158.82 163.13 B: ah yeah i think it's a little bit of both you know um 

163.86 166.65 B: all the jokes are starting to become the same 

166.40 167.15 A: [mn] 

166.79 181.31 B: y- you get kind of tired of hearing them and it's not that it makes it offensive some people were offended from day one and they will continue to be and other people are just kind of tired of hearing it so now it is starting to become you know somewhat 

167.80 168.37 A: (( yeah )) 

175.06 176.14 A: right 

181.70 184.64 B: i guess affected by it now because 

184.47 188.81 A: [cough] well see with a steve martin movie i probably wouldn't expect much 

184.95 185.68 B: it just 

189.18 191.71 A: anyway you know i me- i would expect 

191.96 194.64 A: it to be like the lowest denomination of humor 

194.40 195.35 B: mhm 

195.26 199.08 A: that he would head for 'cause he's not exactly high comedy 

196.52 197.48 B: mhm 

198.90 200.41 B: [laughter] 

199.43 200.43 A: [laughter] 

200.89 201.80 A: but y- 

201.17 202.19 B: well 

202.41 203.95 B: i'm sorry go ahead 

203.47 205.21 A: [mn] no i was just ah 

205.51 207.81 A: i was trying to think of 

208.12 208.98 A: um 

209.10 211.50 A: exactly what they meant by the question 

211.62 212.37 A: and it 

211.72 212.93 B: yeah 

212.61 213.18 A: (( [mn] )) 

213.51 215.14 A: you're right it is vague 

215.08 216.35 B: (( [mn] )) 

215.68 216.33 A: (( [mn] )) 

216.54 218.06 B: yeah 

216.72 217.63 A: (( ah )) 

218.29 221.54 A: how do you draw the line between offensive and non offensive 

222.00 222.94 A: um 

223.12 224.46 B: you know i- it it 

223.49 227.48 A: it would be totally a personal subjective you know opinion 

227.19 231.05 B: is and i think i'd do it on a case by case 

230.72 236.28 A: right and i liked what you said about dependent on who said it because i had a step dad that 

236.37 240.21 A: he can make a joke and it would just make you groan 

240.33 241.73 B: [laughter] 

241.11 245.79 A: and you knew when he started talking it was gonna be something that was gonna offend somebody 

245.43 246.34 B: right 

245.82 248.73 A: so because he couldn't make a nice joke 

248.67 249.67 B: right 

248.75 252.69 A: [mn] and then but someone else could say something almost the same 

253.24 254.21 A: you know 

254.35 257.15 A: and it it wouldn't have been as offensive 

257.06 258.96 B: right right 

266.68 273.94 B: ((  )) 

274.10 279.00 B: ((  )) 

279.22 280.54 A: (( i i think )) 

279.95 281.27 B: (( kind of thing but i'm )) 

281.27 281.93 A: (( it )) 

281.54 282.68 B: (( overweight )) 

282.96 288.89 B: (( so if someone in front of me if someone would make a joke about fat people i get offended you know )) 

289.46 290.97 B: (( that's just because like you )) 

290.51 292.09 A: (( pretty much comes )) 

293.04 295.34 A: (( down to for me if i )) 

295.42 309.31 A: (( had to pin point it somehow mhm um like if you're gonna say something that's stereotypical and you actually believe it then that's a problem or you know if you say something to someone )) 

298.05 298.83 B: (( say you )) 

306.56 307.55 B: (( don't know what )) 

309.45 310.23 A: (( that could )) 

310.44 312.33 A: (( possibly take it )) 

312.08 312.75 B: (( their )) 

313.32 314.17 A: (( seriously )) 

314.66 315.57 A: (( then that's )) 

315.63 318.03 A: (( a problem mhm okay right right )) 

317.98 323.40 B: motivations are well do you think you would be offended if another overweight person made that joke to you 

323.44 326.56 A: see i don't think so isn't that funny 

326.00 328.69 B: yeah that's what i'm thinking too because 

327.87 329.40 A: yeah 

328.86 332.82 B: it it it it really is the person who's delivering it and you know 

332.89 334.43 B: 'cause obviously 

333.04 337.13 A: if it's if it's a shared experience it's a whole different idea 

336.75 344.73 B: right because obviously they understand they know where you're coming from they're not saying it in a way that's kind of demeaning to you because 

337.20 338.30 A: of what's funny 

344.83 346.03 B: you know they 

344.86 345.70 A: (( yeah that's )) 

345.71 350.49 A: that's probably the main thing is if it's meant to be demeaning it's offensive 

350.71 351.63 B: right 

351.63 355.79 A: if it's not it's not offensive if it's a shared joke 

357.36 358.21 A: hello 

358.13 359.41 B: (( yes [mn] )) 

358.60 362.09 A: okay i heard a click and i thought somebody hung up 

361.48 363.21 B: (( yeah i heard it too [mn] )) 

362.42 365.39 A: [laughter] [mn] but um 

366.52 371.78 A: [noise] but still there- there's some that if someone says something that's hurtful on purpose 

371.79 372.74 B: right 

372.06 374.89 A: you know in front of me then oh 

374.94 376.50 A: i try to say something 

377.71 379.31 B: right right 

378.49 380.64 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

380.21 385.43 B: yeah i guess that would be it you know or even if i'm 

385.58 388.66 B: you know in the presence of someone who i think 

389.03 391.26 B: would be offended by that 

390.94 391.71 A: (( ahah )) 

391.81 397.48 B: then that's also a problem because i think of that as just complete disregard for 

396.69 397.37 A: (( yeah )) 

397.77 398.63 A: i just 

397.89 401.24 B: the person who is listening to the joke you know 

400.79 403.34 A: ah to me it's offensive if it's hurtful 

403.45 404.45 B: yeah 

403.46 414.75 A: and i mean besides just you know [mn] bothering me if it's just way [mn] way too graphic or something like that or just totally disgusting [mn] but mainly it's just if it's hurtful 

408.71 409.67 B: (( [mn] )) 

412.39 413.36 B: mhm 

415.16 416.27 B: you know 

415.54 416.78 A: intentionally 

417.10 425.63 B: i can't even say that's like black and white for me though because i have heard some things that probably could be hurtful to me or someone else 

425.70 429.60 B: but still i may or may not laugh at it 

429.66 430.80 B: um 

431.23 433.61 B: maybe that's not the best thing to say 

432.93 434.39 A: [laughter] 

433.64 435.93 B: [laughter] 

435.00 436.87 A: (( i kind of know what you mean )) 

436.37 444.32 B: like i'm being honest about it you know like i've heard some jokes that i can't possibly take it too seriously so i laugh 

438.13 439.73 A: right right 

444.30 446.10 A: yeah 

444.36 445.41 B: but then 

445.45 453.14 B: there are some jokes that are just so completely over the line that in no universe would i ever find them funny 

452.74 454.30 A: yeah 

453.67 456.77 B: i mean because they're just that vulgar or 

456.52 459.36 A: oh right yeah like there's 

459.66 461.00 A: there's um 

461.33 463.74 A: the site i go to a chat club and 

463.90 468.51 A: they they get into male bashing jokes and sometimes i'm laughing my head off 

466.44 467.18 B: (( okay )) 

468.32 469.09 B: (( ahah )) 

468.60 470.61 A: but then my husband will walk up 

471.37 477.14 A: [mn] and [mn] it's like it's just not the same it's like trying to explain to him what i'm laughing about 

474.54 476.31 B: yeah [laughter] 

477.16 478.20 B: yeah 

477.85 479.02 A: (( oh god )) 

478.76 482.08 B: i can honestly say that whenever i heard 

482.19 495.48 B: any kind of joke that was about women i usually do not find it funny at all like any kind of woman bashing joke never find it funny like nine out of ten i won't find funny but 

488.33 489.30 A: mhm 

492.05 492.84 A: no 

494.18 497.98 A: no well my sons used to go around telling me blond jokes 

497.79 498.75 B: oh 

498.42 499.92 A: and [laughter] 

499.46 501.28 B: [laughter] 

501.08 513.53 A: my husband thinks they're funny but some of 'em were funny just because i guess i'm not blond but [laughter] but you know i could see how they would be offensive to me 

504.54 505.51 B: mhm 

506.80 508.96 B: [laughter] 

512.69 513.73 B: yeah 

514.24 522.35 A: to me it's kind of like saying you know how many men does it take to screw in a light bulb it's you could put anybody in that position and it's gonna offend somebody 

520.83 521.72 B: right 

522.41 523.49 B: right 

522.87 526.43 A: if they d- if they're in the mood to be offended [mn] 

526.59 527.44 A: (( does that make )) 

529.03 530.94 B: if a joke just kind of like 

531.21 532.68 A: (( sense [noise] )) 

532.83 533.74 A: hello 

533.81 534.73 B: yes 

534.36 536.72 A: it's starting to break up or something but 

536.14 540.83 B: oh yeah 'cause i'm on my cell phone and i don't have that much to go [laughter] 

538.35 539.59 A: oh 

540.12 545.14 A: oh that's amazing that we're having such a good connection with you on a cell phone 

542.47 543.36 B: um 

544.98 548.17 B: [mn] yeah it's actually my bars in this house are 

548.30 551.53 B: are bad like i get very little signal in this house 

551.32 552.43 A: wow 

551.82 557.11 B: so when i gave my cell phone number i probably wasn't thinking that well but [mn] [mn] 

556.66 561.82 A: [mn] i know i i gave my cordless because i hadn't tried my husband's yet it's a cell phone i 

561.92 566.32 A: might try it but like you said you'd have to find a really good place to connect 

566.03 569.66 B: yeah i haven't found one in this house yet so 

570.16 572.01 B: (( at least not a quiet place )) 

571.74 572.73 A: (( ah right )) 

572.41 573.47 B: um 

573.49 574.68 B: but yeah 

573.51 575.93 A: back to the subject [laughter] 

575.13 577.35 B: (( [laughter] )) 

576.57 578.88 A: it's hard to stay on it um 

579.06 586.67 B: yeah the jokes like you were saying where you could probably hurt anybody in the punch line and it would work just as well 

582.45 583.27 A: (( mhm )) 

586.98 592.57 B: [lipsmack] not offensive probably unless they're coming from someone who really just has some kind of 

592.85 595.15 B: you know yeah 

592.93 596.54 A: vendetta kind of thing yeah that's what 

595.64 599.89 B: as opposed to jokes that are like just tailored to offend
