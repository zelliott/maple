34.62 39.43 A: this is my first one so you're gonna have to lead me into doing this [laughter] 

37.97 49.33 B: [laughter] well we just talked about the chosen topic which was comedy [mn] and actually that's a pretty cool topic for me because i i'm i'm a a funny girl i mean 

42.67 43.62 A: okay 

48.40 49.99 A: i am also 

49.70 52.86 B: i'm a cl- i'm the clown [laughter] are you

55.19 56.92 A: yes yes 

56.59 64.65 B: [laughter] wonderful yeah i think i mean i- it's true what they say that laughter is the best medicine and 

63.00 66.09 A: oh it certainly is it certainly is 

64.79 72.85 B: i- i'd rather be giggling and screaming and going into hysterical laughter than [mn] dwelling on 

72.87 74.54 B: anything else in this 

73.90 78.15 A: oh yes and you can get pretty depressed about the world [laughter] 

74.71 76.20 B: world it's 

77.63 81.65 B: oh yeah so i mean i guess the topic 

81.88 96.49 B: they're asking where do you draw the line when isn't it funny when is when is it crossing the line and i i think that goes into [mn] i don't know my opinion is [mn] when when people get offended by comedy 

84.36 85.22 A: mhm 

85.93 86.92 A: mhm 

96.49 97.61 B: and 

97.74 98.67 B: and s- 

98.98 102.64 B: to be honest with you i i laugh at everything even when 

102.68 109.63 B: even when somebody makes jokes um about my race and and if somebody that's my in my 

106.96 108.19 A: mhm 

109.91 112.61 B: the same race i'm i'm hispanic 

112.28 113.25 A: mhm 

112.63 120.16 B: if somebody tells a hispanic joke i don't get offended i take it for what what i take it in the spirit in which it's intended but 

119.02 120.72 A: sure sure 

120.22 123.67 B: when there's comedy that actually hurts somebody 

123.41 124.32 A: yes 

124.01 127.61 B: where there the spirit is intended to really hurt somebody 

126.97 127.82 A: yes 

127.93 137.97 B: or there i- if it's a practical joke that does actually cause somebody harm or it's at somebody's expense then i i don't agree with that 

137.94 148.98 A: and some of them are are pretty obvious and blatant that it's intended for harm and it's intended to embarrass or hurt someone's feelings 

148.76 150.54 B: exactly 

149.45 155.57 A: and i i think that's way overboard there's lots of funny things that don't have to do that 

155.37 159.71 B: right there's there's other ways to have fun and and and 

157.57 158.53 A: oh yes 

159.84 171.56 B: [mn] using somebody else to get a laugh and not caring what's going to happen to their feelings or even physically um to this person [mn] i i don't agree with that 

162.87 163.82 A: mm 

171.49 179.05 A: and i don't know ah hispanics may be very different from the black ah race but [mn] um 

179.16 183.96 A: a lot of the blacks around my area are extremely sensitive 

183.96 185.22 B: oh really 

184.11 189.58 A: and and they get hurt their feelings hurt over anything 

189.41 196.73 A: in fact it's almost as if they're overly sensitive i mean like they make an effort to be overly sensitive 

196.52 205.01 A: now i don't know about hispanics we're beginning to have a lot of hispanics move into our area but ah i've not seen them um 

201.55 202.90 B: mhm 

204.82 218.79 A: the the blacks in our area seem more persecuted i mean they they just and if you don't mean it that way they tend to turn it that way it's like they get some kind of pleasure out of being the the downtrodden one 

208.71 209.66 B: oh 

218.76 229.95 B: yeah i i agree with you i i know i've i've i have we don't have a whole lot of um black americans in our state there's um 

230.04 237.95 B: there's some in albequerque but i- in the town i live in i live in the capital in the state capital in santa fe 

232.28 233.24 A: mhm 

238.06 247.82 B: um we don't have a lot of blacks it's a multicultural community so it's anglo native american and spanish hispanic 

241.22 243.26 A: mhm mhm 

247.90 253.04 B: and um anyone i i have friends of all cultures of all races 

253.27 258.39 B: i let them take the first step if if they're okay with with 

256.43 257.51 A: right 

258.41 259.99 B: joking around or 

260.20 272.91 B: a- and it includes religion too if they if they're okay with it then i'm okay with it but if if i say something and they they may get offended i'll apologize and i'll say i'm sorry you know i 

265.43 266.32 A: (( yeah )) 

272.89 276.87 B: i don't mean offence and i'll i won't do that again but i i am 

277.18 279.81 B: (( an outright come- comedian )) 

279.91 284.43 B: i mean i'll i'm very dramatic and very silly i'll i'll get into 

284.47 286.12 B: telling stories 

286.27 292.81 B: and just getting people to laugh that's my happiness if i can get somebody to laugh i'm happy [mn] 

289.29 290.54 A: yes yes 

291.99 294.13 A: yes i understand 

292.85 299.90 B: but i i won't i won't cross the line so i i think there is a a line that can be crossed 

300.05 302.39 B: and um there are 

301.03 309.83 A: it's kind of an unspoken line and like you say in some areas you let the other people take the lead and then you follow what they're comfortable with 

309.54 310.63 B: right 

310.33 316.59 A: but um i just don't think it's ever necessary to make it at someone else's expense 

316.77 319.94 B: right or there's times that i'm on the internet 

320.00 325.48 B: or i'm channel surfing on the t._v. and and i come across some certain comedy 

325.52 328.12 B: and it is crass and rude 

326.87 327.90 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

328.42 329.93 B: i won't watch it 

330.04 331.14 A: (( [mn] well )) 

330.07 338.46 B: i mean i'm i i [mn] i can i can take the comedy out of something but if it's something that's really degrading 

337.86 338.89 A: yes 

338.76 340.26 B: i won't watch it 

340.11 343.44 A: and it seems like we're kinda obsessed with um 

342.66 343.62 B: [laughter] 

343.69 357.00 A: making the best movies um take the best movie and add a whole bunch of colorful language to it that really doesn't do anything to add to the plot it just kinda takes away from the whole 

357.10 359.18 A: ah experience to me 

359.21 359.97 A: um 

359.25 360.83 B: oh i agree 

360.12 363.20 A: and i think it's as if 

363.20 375.30 A: the more vulgar it is the more people are gonna rush out and see it or something and i i hope that's not the case but obviously it is or they wouldn't keep doing that 'cause they're making lots and lots of money on it 

375.45 377.28 B: yeah i agree with you 

377.47 389.07 B: there's times or you know what there is one thing that i do have an opinion on i don't know if you've ever seen it on t._v. but that jackass on m._t._v. and then they made a movie in the theatres 

388.92 390.82 A: no i haven't seen it 

390.45 399.48 B: it's it's called jackass and what they do is they they pull these stunts that are real dangerous like they'll put somebody in a shopping cart 

399.19 400.53 A: mhm 

399.93 403.88 B: and they're they're filming it going down a flight of stairs 

403.59 404.80 A: oh my goodness 

404.27 417.94 B: and they this shopping cart goes flying the person ju- you know goes flying out of the shopping cart obviously getting hurt they do things like that in the movie i don't think those kind of things are funny 

418.06 418.96 A: no 

418.32 427.35 B: i mean they're i i'm all for practical jokes i'm all for you know hiding behind the door and and then popping out and and or i'm 

424.62 425.48 A: yes 

428.02 435.22 B: i mean i'll pretend i'll faint and somebody'll come around and i'll say i'm just kidding you know i'm i'm a goofy girl 

435.39 440.62 B: but those kind of that kind of comedy i'm not [mn] i'm not all about that at all 

435.69 436.77 A: well i'm 

439.35 446.25 A: well i'm i'm middle aged i'm probably much older than you are but i um i find m._t._v. 

441.31 442.57 B: [laughter] 

446.39 450.36 A: offensive most of the time so i don't generally turn it on 

450.26 453.06 B: yeah i- it's gotten real bad [mn] 

452.24 466.48 A: my boys are grown and married and um i don't have it on i'm very careful when i have my grandchildren in because [mn] you can just have the news on nowadays and there's some things on there that i don't want my grandchildren hearing 

466.50 467.59 B: right 

466.58 470.40 A: so um i don't i don't have much to do with m._t._v. 

470.40 475.79 B: no i- its not music television any more they don't show music videos 

473.32 478.71 A: no it started out that way but i think it's gone downhill quite a bit 

475.94 477.16 B: (( no [mn] )) 

479.48 482.80 B: no i don't like to watch the comedy shows they they 

483.16 488.74 B: air on m._t._v. because to me they're it's not the kind of comedy i like i like 

488.91 492.13 B: shows on t._v. that are are like um 

492.58 496.76 B: [mn] s- satires like everyone loves raymond or 

495.36 497.38 A: yes yes i do too 

497.29 502.87 B: or seinfeld you know i love to laugh at shows like that that comedy is funny 

498.79 499.64 A: yes 

502.93 503.95 B: um 

504.13 507.63 B: i don't really think they cross too many lines in those shows 

507.77 508.72 B: but 

508.97 511.38 B: shows like married with children 

511.53 512.79 B: um 

513.39 517.19 B: [lipsmack] and like i said some of them on m._t._v. i 

516.14 517.86 A: i don't care for those 

517.13 528.54 B: i think they do cross the line and i wouldn't want my family watching it i have three boys they're all you know younger the youngest one is seven the oldest one is fifteen 

528.64 531.67 B: i wouldn't let them watch those kind of shows 

530.63 532.36 A: yeah yeah 

532.18 538.75 B: i let my oldest son watch seinfeld with me even though there are some adult situations in that comedy 

538.22 539.11 A: yes 

538.84 545.17 B: i think he's mature enough to understand it and you know he's not going to be influenced 

544.74 549.80 A: it's better for him to watch it with you because he's gonna get a lot of it outside of your home 

549.58 550.76 B: right 

550.88 552.10 B: (( [mn] but there [mn] )) 

550.90 558.37 A: and it it's better that he get his first taste of it with you beside him to explain if there's something he doesn't understand 

557.98 562.94 B: exactly but i've caught him watching other shows like south park 

562.95 565.61 B: it was it's a cartoon that's very vulgar 

564.12 565.47 A: (( yes ahah )) 

565.75 569.09 B: and i said i'm not i don't like that cartoon 

569.14 576.98 B: i don't like it i don't i'm not happy with you watching it i didn't forbid him to watch it but i just expressed how i wasn't 

569.15 570.03 A: yeah 

577.19 582.87 B: it wasn't a a good cartoon for him to watch and he respected me 

581.10 582.52 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

583.37 597.41 B: so he he didn't watch it any more i didn't know it was anything like that i didn't think some of the stuff that they were doing on there was funny and it was all the rage all the kids were watching it and i sat down and watched it with him once 

594.49 596.27 A: oh yeah 

597.40 599.89 B: and i said uh-uh [mn] this is not
