212.30 213.35 B: i don't know 

212.34 224.04 A: i think it's gotten gotten to the point of sickening it it it there is a point that a some of it was humorous but it's the world has gotten to where it's ah 

215.25 216.27 B: yeah 

225.25 227.22 A: overboard with it

284.86 286.44 A: for the most

317.14 319.34 A: that kind of stuff that is 

319.54 321.40 A: sick humor 

320.67 322.37 B: yeah i think that was 

321.85 325.32 A: when somebody's getting hurt that's not humorous to me 

323.45 324.36 B: yeah 

324.74 328.45 B: yeah ah yeah i don't i don't like that too much either [mn] 

327.83 341.81 A: and the the kid falling off riding his bicycle and his foots slips off the pedal and ah i've seen this one time and you know where he lands that ain't funny even if it was a girl or a guy that kind of humor sucks to me 

341.39 342.27 B: yeah 

342.88 343.77 B: yeah 

342.98 354.73 A: that's what that my my family sometimes the people i live with they'll turn that on and i say i don't want to watch that why i said it makes me mad [laughter]

365.35 366.40 A: (( ah )) 

367.58 370.33 B: so but i i just think you know it's it's 

370.60 372.79 B: kind of extreme at times 

370.72 371.81 A: i think it's 

372.69 382.84 A: i think it's bad humor to talk about people's misfortunes too you know what i mean like something that like ah if they've been molested or 

376.54 378.15 B: yeah yeah 

382.55 393.95 B: yeah well the the other thing is i guess it's the whole like like the stereotype things you know the the ethnic jokes and things like that you know whether that's funny or not i mean 

383.14 384.40 A: or 

394.38 395.33 B: you know 

394.72 398.79 A: you mean ethnic racial jokes yeah

399.75 400.41 A: (( [noise] )) 

400.68 409.58 B: i mean i guess it just depends you know what what you you you're careful what you say because you don't want to offend you know someone so it's i guess it's better to 

407.11 407.95 A: (( right [noise] )) 

409.65 412.68 B: you know if someone tells it it better be about their own 

412.84 414.83 B: group you know [laughter] 

414.12 416.34 A: right because it's 

414.84 418.31 B: rather than telling it about somebody else you know it's it's not 

417.06 418.08 A: [laughter] 

418.80 419.64 B: you know 

418.93 420.41 A: exactly

494.23 495.23 A: yeah 

494.67 496.63 B: because somehow you just didn't 

497.06 499.01 B: you know just didn't want to ah 

499.09 501.15 A: [mn] that comes with ah 

499.34 500.09 B: ex- 

503.66 504.31 A: w- 

504.43 517.03 A: i don't know if this will sound offensive or not but ah that comes with having kids and and the extra responsibility that you didn't have before and the extra 

514.44 515.46 B: right 

515.68 529.14 B: and then you think well gee that's funny nah that's that you know you don't want the kids to see certain things you know you just don't want them exposed to certain things and so it you know becomes you become different about it you know just 

521.40 522.85 A: (( mhm )) 

529.29 535.59 A: i live with a six and eight year o- or six and a nine year old that ah

555.62 556.53 B: mhm 

556.90 560.38 A: you know it this is off the subject of humor but 

561.28 564.07 A: ah they thought it was funny 

563.91 564.94 B: (( oh okay )) 

565.24 566.31 A: okay 

565.88 566.79 B: yeah 

566.59 573.07 A: but because they don't i don't think their mind is developed enough to understand 

572.51 573.83 B: yeah 

573.87 575.94 B: yeah well that's the you know 

573.88 575.36 A: the serious 

576.17 577.70 B: i guess they don't ah 

579.06 586.16 B: i don't know understand whether it's real or you know just fantasy they don't make that differentiation yet you know 

586.04 591.31 A: right they they don't comprehend the severity of 

591.54 596.10 A: getting into other people's stuff or taking things that don't belong to 'em until 

594.60 595.80 B: (( so right )) 

596.65 599.89 A: till something happens and you've got to i feel that
