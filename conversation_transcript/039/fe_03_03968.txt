58.73 61.97 B: cross the line into uh being more like a sexual harassment 

63.24 65.52 B: and some kind of bad humor like that so

67.70 69.54 A: i learned that lesson the hard way

80.06 80.55 B: uh-huh 

80.66 82.24 A: even my my humor base but 

82.48 83.53 A: every once and awhile i'll slip 

83.66 83.92 A: so 

84.37 87.95 B: yeah you have to watch what you're saying especially if you're used to being around people that 

88.35 96.51 B: you can normally be like that er because i i guess i'm in the same sort of situation because i got into a supervisory role and i had to watch and i'm actually over 

96.71 100.23 B: men that are older than myself and i have to kind of watch what i'm saying 

100.89 102.73 B: otherwise i could get my 

102.86 108.04 B: self in trouble even when it comes to other races and things like that because i had not normally worked with 

108.44 113.06 B: lots of different races or anything and you know there's some funny humor that you don't mean to be 

113.45 114.08 B: mean 

114.55 115.00 A: right 

115.20 117.81 B: but it just comes out that way when you don't mean it to be

119.58 120.51 B: i live in texas 

121.33 123.64 A: okay i'm i'm uh i'm in atlanta georgia

131.35 133.88 A: i'm a restaurant manager i had to learn spanish 

134.53 135.05 A: and 

135.15 135.69 A: there's 

136.22 137.05 A: there's still 

138.34 141.45 A: different different mind-sets that i still can't wrap my mind around 

141.68 146.79 B: oh no you're you know what we're very similar then because i'm actually from michigan and just moved here about 

147.05 147.72 B: six years ago 

148.41 151.25 B: and now i'm uh recreation center supervisor 

152.10 153.13 B: so i work in a 

153.52 162.76 B: a highly hispanic area myself and i'm anything but hispanic and i have a very hard time with having to route my humor that we used to have up north 

163.18 163.58 A: right 

163.55 165.47 B: to being appropriate for in the south 

166.75 167.99 B: so it's kind of funny that 

168.12 168.57 B: we're 

168.91 169.91 B: similar in those ways 

171.10 171.45 A: but 

171.59 172.04 A: i 

172.24 174.13 A: do you ar- do you enjoy um 

174.41 175.58 A: the humor on television and 

176.22 176.83 A: and uh 

177.69 178.86 A: watch watch comedies

186.20 187.21 B: mostly that one 

187.89 189.08 B: that's the one that i like to watch 

189.58 192.38 B: they do say some pretty crass things that i probably would never say at work 

193.25 196.02 B: or even i'd tell my friends but i think it's hilarious 

197.26 200.47 A: i can't help it i i even i i even enjoy like 

197.41 198.00 B: (( so i can )) 

200.80 204.67 A: which is strange as a as a female but i even -joy enjoy things like like 

204.98 209.24 A: sam kinison and um some of the raunchier comics 

209.46 210.52 B: see i've never even heard of them 

211.57 212.01 A: oh he's 

212.38 214.09 A: he's he's horrible 

214.01 214.96 B: is he bad 

214.95 218.73 A: oh yeah well he's not not anymore he's dead but um 

218.17 218.69 B: oh 

218.94 220.60 B: like what kinds of jokes does he tell 

221.39 222.17 A: oh he'd tell 

221.56 223.36 B: or like what kinds of things did he hit on 

223.91 225.05 A: he would he would just 

225.32 226.57 A: tell horrible 

227.70 231.81 A: horrible stories about about lesbians and about 

231.79 232.41 B: ah 

232.12 233.40 A: um about 

233.19 233.50 B: yeah 

233.69 241.02 A: sex with corpses and and it was hilarious i'm i'm i'm i'm in my apartment by myself laughing my ass off and then 

235.72 237.62 B: oh god 

241.91 247.24 B: but your friends you're thinking okay if my friends saw me laughing my ass off at this 

246.49 248.47 A: i should be offended right now 

250.22 253.16 B: like how dare anybody say that that's disgusting 

255.13 260.22 B: yeah i have to agree with that there are some things that are really funny but you wouldn't want to be caught laughing at 

261.32 263.12 B: some of the time 

263.09 264.69 A: most of the time i think 

264.36 265.96 B: yeah yeah 

266.75 267.18 A: but 

268.94 271.04 A: have you have you done this this study before 

271.36 273.30 B: this is my second one actually 

273.79 278.28 B: and i did it on the same i think i did it on the same topic like an hour two hours ago 

279.12 281.26 A: oh see i did one um a few 

281.37 282.11 A: weeks ago 

282.74 284.79 A: um about terrorism 

285.03 285.77 B: really 

285.72 286.62 A: so i was 

286.77 287.53 B: how interesting 

287.51 288.44 A: i was kind of 

289.03 292.32 A: like okay cool different topic because that was kind of uncomfortable 

292.44 294.03 B: yeah this is at least a little bit more 

294.76 295.97 B: humor-related 

297.85 300.53 A: it's hard talking to strangers about serious things on the phone 

297.91 298.43 B: oh 

300.71 302.32 B: yeah i can terrorism 

302.50 304.34 B: probably wouldn't be a good one 

305.17 309.41 B: but the humor one i know i the person i talked to earlier was from california 

310.21 311.58 B: and um they 

311.92 312.93 B: were talking about 

313.05 313.86 B: um just 

316.54 317.44 B: work place 

318.32 319.34 B: humor and 

319.50 322.08 B: mostly just about work place humor and how 

322.69 323.82 B: the lines can be crossed 

323.92 324.68 B: so easily 

325.22 325.56 A: right 

325.29 327.06 B: especially when you're supervisoring a m- 

327.18 328.25 B: supervising a male 

328.46 331.56 B: but then the male starts making jokes with his other friends around you 

332.31 333.42 B: it's hard to know 

333.81 335.66 B: where the lines are 

336.16 342.63 B: with them and when you can laugh with them or not and then when not to take it seriously and when to take it seriously and then where to draw the line at 

344.37 346.80 B: so i don't know it's difficult 

348.11 351.30 B: especially where i work because i work at a recreation center so i have several 

351.74 359.77 B: men that will come in to play basketball and they will come in and tell us jokes in the lobby and i'm like okay that's not appropriate to be talking about in a recreation center 

360.41 361.99 B: you don't need to be talking that way 

363.16 366.36 A: i c- i probably i probably say that about six times a day 

366.72 372.64 B: yeah but then you could go home and you'd probably say the same thing it wouldn't be a different story too 

373.40 374.12 B: but yeah it 

374.82 377.74 B: so depends on where you're at and what you're doing at the time 

378.39 379.28 B: i think so 

379.41 381.36 B: i would agree with what you said earlier 

382.52 383.82 A: have you found that your your 

383.95 385.32 A: humorous tastes have changed 

385.86 387.18 B: oh definitely 

386.18 387.02 A: as you've gotten older 

387.52 389.19 B: definitely when i was in college and 

389.73 390.93 B: doing the whole dorm 

391.69 393.06 B: thing and the partying 

393.18 396.09 B: bar scene i definitely had a different 

396.36 398.05 B: humor than i do now and uh 

398.40 401.52 B: i've only been out of college for about i don't kn- six years now 

402.33 404.41 B: so uh but being married and being a little 

405.11 409.51 B: older i'm not as into all that as i used to be so 

410.54 412.61 A: my phone is beeping so if i if i hang 

412.84 413.98 A: if i hang up it's not 

414.10 414.73 A: intentional 

414.99 416.14 B: oh no problem 

416.18 418.20 A: i just want to let you know um 

420.52 422.63 A: god this is a long ten minutes 

423.58 425.15 A: and i lost my cigarette

438.18 439.74 A: and i just i i've 

439.99 442.86 A: i changed companies and this is a really good job market for what i do 

443.37 444.98 B: oh that's good 

446.27 446.82 B: yeah i can 

446.31 446.62 A: but i 

447.03 448.03 A: i don't like the city 

447.12 447.86 B: (( care for the weather )) 

448.83 449.72 B: you don't like the city

450.79 451.81 B: oh see i do 

451.97 454.28 B: i like well i like the city but i like the weather

467.12 469.60 B: and speaking of like humor even with dry humor 

469.96 472.52 B: my husband is probably the most dry humor person you've ever met 

474.13 477.03 B: he's one of those people that you don't know half the time if they're serious or not 

477.84 478.89 A: i love dry humor

493.01 493.84 B: oh yeah 

494.74 497.20 B: yeah my husband will say things that 

507.73 512.79 B: i have a hard time not taking things as seriously now that i'm a little older than i did then 

513.35 514.48 B: even when we first met 

515.58 517.01 B: i don't know if you have those same things 

517.81 518.44 A: i uh 

519.33 523.22 A: i'm i'm single and i haven't i haven't experienced living 

523.66 525.69 A: with someone else's maturing humor 

526.02 526.63 B: oh yeah 

526.35 529.27 A: think that would that would that would be really interesting 

529.51 531.13 B: yeah because i'm i'm about 

531.65 533.37 B: two and a half three years older than him so he's 

534.15 535.46 B: still got this humor that 

535.61 536.32 B: sometimes 

536.46 542.85 B: i'm just like okay i could handle it three years ago but right now i just can't take it just be straight with me tell what you're 

543.03 543.99 B: doing or don't 

544.13 545.58 B: make these faces at me 

546.66 549.88 B: so i need it straight now where i used to be able to just pick up on it 

550.32 552.46 B: he's like you cannot read me at all 

553.83 554.88 B: when he's making jokes 

557.39 558.12 B: i don't know 

560.74 562.50 B: this is a late call it surprised me 

564.53 566.78 A: i think the last one i got was really late at night too
