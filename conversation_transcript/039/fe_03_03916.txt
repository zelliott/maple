68.60 79.58 B: ah in terms of comedy and humor um basically what controls that is the culture the interwovenness of the cultures of the world 

79.62 80.82 A: mhm 

80.04 87.08 B: um what is humor in one culture may not be accepted as humor in the other culture 

87.19 88.80 A: well that's true that's true

88.70 101.08 B: it's also a question of understanding humor there are international i mean humor i mean that could be expressed in any culture probably but there are those which are embedded within specific cultures isn't it

132.51 136.59 A: [noise] what types of humor that would upset me 

135.96 137.04 B: (( yes )) 

137.22 146.12 A: um [noise] i like let's say for example anything that like just you know draws [noise] or makes light of um 

145.54 146.26 B: [noise] 

146.38 147.33 A: (( some )) 

147.71 149.38 A: racial bigotry 

149.48 158.85 A: like you know just picking on different ethnicities for really no purpose i mean just just to expand upon just a a racial ah 

149.66 150.62 B: yeah 

159.31 169.38 A: what am i looking for just a racial stereotype i think that humor's kind of lame and unacceptable and ah anything that kind of pokes fun at just being um 

165.98 166.89 B: yeah 

170.26 183.54 A: ah just evil one person or another i mean i enjoy um [laughter] a good joke now and then but i think if it's just at the excuse of someone else it's kind of over the top 

182.99 197.17 B: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah now that's right that's right ah basically ah anybody with um a clear ah you know mind would ah not accept those kind of humor that would ah portray others as ah 

197.26 209.92 B: as as probably bad or as probably um incomplete you know those kind of humor will not never be accepted by any civil minded person i 

203.74 205.45 A: right 

209.71 211.34 A: right 

210.03 212.22 B: (( would think ah but then )) 

212.61 214.37 B: (( ah there are )) 

214.74 220.84 B: cultural blended kind of humor where people talk about um 

220.99 223.29 B: specialty nations 

223.45 228.06 B: (( um which are our thoughts are not acceptable i would think )) 

224.97 225.95 A: you mean 

228.43 235.21 B: ah i i i'm referring now when it comes to intimacy you know we th- this world has been a 

228.74 229.80 A: that's true 

235.74 237.03 A: right 

236.01 247.77 B: ah and the moment you move from one region to another you would want to sort of joke with someone other p- other people don't look right and you'd like to express some kind of ah 

247.59 255.75 B: you know express comedy express humor ah but if you know if that is not making 

256.16 258.36 B: person b. feel 

258.80 264.50 B: humiliated or feel bitter ah then that's probably a good humor 

264.35 269.19 A: that's true that's true i think there's definitely a ways to use um 

270.65 273.18 A: maybe not stereotypes but just ah 

273.48 283.60 A: maybe just understandings of the way the cultures react that'd be i mean it's good to poke fun at in in more or a joking light than just a a derogatory light 

276.83 277.76 B: yes 

281.35 293.87 B: [noise] that's right but then we have got issues where we see a lot of films on the t._v. you know media you know printed media on and and electronic media actually on t._v.s and and all these 

293.01 293.62 A: (( [noise] )) 

294.03 296.13 B: ah sometimes they 

296.76 299.72 B: profile you know 

300.13 306.99 B: um i i would think some issues that are very sensitive or that are of um 

307.06 308.61 B: (( um )) 

308.72 312.02 B: ah racial nature i would think 

312.08 320.61 A: that's true that's true just because it's an easy laugh and it's a very low common denominator of humor that that people can get really quickly 

318.17 318.73 B: (( [mn] )) 

319.56 327.99 B: you are right you are right you're right and maybe those are the kind of things that needs to be looked into on the discouraged it of course 

328.17 330.94 B: um if we want to create um um 

330.91 343.56 B: a society that is um is is is is is free to interact with each other without [mn] really looking down upon each other ah i would think ah 

341.95 343.63 A: right 

343.61 350.63 B: that that you know for for a generation i mean the younger generation like ours i would think i'm not i'm not too sure how young you are but 

350.29 351.25 A: [laughter] 

350.76 354.64 B: um ah [laughter] i would say that [laughter] yes 

351.95 353.79 A: (( i think we're in the same generation )) 

355.51 358.13 A: um it's interesting though that ah 

358.77 363.89 A: that ah you know the way that media tries to portray itself as as um 

359.93 360.83 B: right 

363.95 370.90 A: as just representing a core value of of freedom of speech i think there's also a limit to what is acceptable in freedom of speech 

370.79 372.21 B: exactly 

370.91 371.91 A: i mean 

372.24 377.01 A: there is a limit in everything to good taste and what's not considered good taste 

372.62 373.73 B: (( i )) 

376.96 378.70 B: right um 

378.79 383.81 B: in in any even um sphere of life ah 

383.78 392.37 B: (( there is nothing really that one can say ah you have you can do one can claim absolutely ah )) 

392.28 400.58 B: freedom of speech as such where the freedom of speech of one person and the other person's freedom of speech 

400.67 406.43 B: and so we have to accommodate each other in terms of those kind of ah of things when we are talking 

406.41 415.88 B: things that will upset another person ah i'm talking from experience ah because um i have experienced a lot of things in 

416.24 418.35 B: (( of racial in nature )) 

418.38 419.85 A: really 

419.31 421.00 B: yeah oh yes 

421.56 430.08 B: um but then ah sometimes people do these things without really knowing that they are harting or hurting other people 

429.87 430.66 A: (( mm )) 

430.47 433.24 B: (( ah some do it deliberately )) 

430.70 436.00 A: i understand yeah that's that's really where the problem lies 

435.98 443.63 B: (( exactly but um e- to come back to the the the concept the thing is the )) 

443.78 448.40 B: younger generation i mean the younger the people are [mn] 

447.71 451.95 A: (( [noise] [noise] yes )) 

451.52 458.42 B: ah what i'm saying the younger i mean the generation you know the the more we have young people the better 

454.40 456.49 A: (( i am [noise] )) 

458.55 464.21 B: because we tend to understand each other's cultures and accommodate each other 

464.32 471.20 B: and when we joke or when we d- d- display comedies then we are aware of these issues 

472.03 475.96 A: that's true i mean comedy does definitely bring people closer together 

476.28 477.31 B: right 

476.65 481.44 A: and it allows them to interact on ah more familial level 

481.59 489.65 A: or at least they can they can laugh together and they can joke together and it and it sort of breaks the ice and it and it helps people just relax 

481.64 482.92 B: that that's right 

487.73 488.85 B: (( well yeah )) 

489.48 495.16 B: (( oh yes have you ever been ay exposed to international kind of culture )) 

495.35 507.19 A: oh yes i have yeah i've actually spent a year i spent a year in europe when i was in high school and my college ah university of michigan just had a very large international student population

508.74 520.87 A: so i've been i've been pretty well exposed to international culture i don't think i'm a very like i don't think i know the in- intricacies of every culture but i've definitely learned at least some um bits of culture about other cultures
