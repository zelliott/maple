1.71 2.90 B: karen 

2.66 4.82 A: (( renee how you doing )) 

4.71 6.20 B: good how are you 

5.82 7.19 A: i'm okay 

7.85 9.89 A: (( ah the topic is comedy )) 

10.46 11.66 B: [sigh] and humor 

11.71 17.99 A: yeah how do you uh ah distinguish between comedy that's good and bad 

18.02 19.00 A: right 

18.14 28.13 B: um i would say if it's not insulting to another person and if it's insulting then i consider it to be bad humor and in bad taste [noise] 

27.91 28.83 A: (( mm )) 

29.89 31.88 A: well i think comedy 

32.18 36.15 A: is just comedy because i have seen 

36.30 37.88 A: like um 

38.06 42.38 A: b._t. i have seen comedians that 

42.85 47.17 A: address people in the audience and they think it's hilarious 

46.97 50.40 B: like a comedy den type of a atmosphere 

50.29 51.51 A: yeah 

51.04 51.98 B: okay 

51.88 59.84 A: i think that's pretty cool as long as somebody can take a bad situation and turn it into a funny situation 

53.40 54.52 B: mhm 

59.88 60.89 A: it's okay 

61.10 66.91 B: a good one okay i agree with that we've gone to ah some comedy dens and stuff those are fun 

62.73 64.16 A: [laughter] 

67.48 71.04 B: it's a good way to get out and i agree with that too 

70.83 77.42 A: yeah and i think i think some comedy now where it's so they 

77.64 83.92 A: they have a lot of foul language and the whole family can't enjoy it 

84.51 87.91 A: i think that is that needs to be addressed 

88.04 91.12 A: because everybody wants to laugh 

91.17 94.31 A: and nowadays it seems like 

94.62 100.26 A: the comedians are getting more and more graphic you know what i'm saying 

99.33 101.41 B: mhm i do yes 

101.09 102.42 A: so 

102.52 106.53 A: i want to be able to take my kids to a comedy show 

106.67 109.30 A: and the whole family have a good time 

109.27 112.50 B: and not have to worry about what they're going to say or if it's going to 

111.34 113.18 A: exactly 

112.82 116.75 B: they're going to be repeating it and it's going to be something you wanted them to learn 

116.28 125.09 A: exactly right so that's one of my main issues with comedy and i think that maybe 

117.05 118.01 B: (( yeah )) 

125.22 132.04 A: some of the comedians because i've watched like ah different shows where they have trials like um apollo 

131.90 132.96 B: mhm 

132.92 139.16 A: some of the comedians like that they need to be given more of a chance than what they are 

139.31 141.66 A: because they're pretty funny 

142.16 146.25 B: they are they need to have like a star search or something like that for 'em 

142.24 143.62 A: [laughter] 

146.13 148.37 A: for just for comedians 

146.28 147.63 B: mhm 

147.78 149.24 B: mhm 

148.63 152.56 A: and the ones like i said that's graphic they need to 

152.92 156.24 A: maybe edit that edit some of the those things out 

156.41 161.86 A: you know but i don't i think that making a joke out of 

162.49 164.04 A: a bad event 

164.46 166.27 A: is not too good either 

166.04 167.25 B: mhm 

166.54 170.57 A: like i see some comedians joke about the nine eleven thing 

170.33 172.44 B: mhm that's in poor taste 

170.63 175.15 A: that was not funny no way shape or form 

172.86 174.09 B: i agree 

175.70 179.96 A: so they might need to you know address that or something yeah 

179.58 180.69 B: mhm [noise] 

180.77 184.77 B: (( i agree with that too because they're not funny situations )) 

182.01 183.03 A: [laughter] 

184.72 185.65 A: right 

185.84 191.73 A: it it it has to be something that you can look really look back at and laugh 

191.93 197.19 A: it can't be something that's where you look back at it you're like oh my god you know 

196.29 201.44 B: mhm but it could be a tragedy situation and there's definitely no humor in that 

201.03 202.49 A: exactly 

202.50 206.49 A: exactly but as far as yeah as far as um 

206.67 214.97 A: the comedians that pick people in the audience and talk about them their weight and stuff like that that doesn't really bother me too much because nine times out of ten 

215.07 216.96 A: the person is laughing 

216.64 219.10 B: mhm and they can think it's funny too 

217.34 219.99 A: (( you know what i mean huh )) 

219.45 220.64 B: mhm 

220.51 221.66 A: [laughter] 

220.99 226.07 B: yep [mn] if everybody's there they're all there to have a good time and laugh and mm 

221.94 222.81 A: so 

226.69 227.78 A: right 

228.23 233.45 A: right so that's how i draw the the the line between 

233.71 237.20 A: basically what's funny and what's not you know 

237.11 239.97 B: i think you had a good point too 'cause i've seen a couple 

240.21 248.81 B: things that people made humor out of ah like you said the nine eleven and and that's i don't agree with that it's in poor 

244.39 245.36 A: right 

247.86 261.84 A: but then on the same hand we have comedians out here that are talking about saddam hussein and what's going on in iraq that is just hilarious [laughter] [laughter] i mean so 

257.44 261.47 B: taste [laughter] that's funny [laughter] 

261.70 267.39 A: there's a a a drawn line depending on the events behind the situation 

267.29 268.54 B: mhm 

267.81 273.43 A: (( you see what i'm saying and for some reason a lot of i'm noticing a lot of the comedians )) 

273.38 285.18 A: are talking about the difference between white people and black people and how they do one thing one way and one thing another that's starting to get a little old 

284.79 285.92 B: mhm 

285.26 286.93 A: (( you know what i'm saying because )) 

286.19 286.97 B: because 

287.74 295.58 A: we're all people [laughter] so i don't think that's something people i think people take offence at that sometimes 

289.43 290.84 B: right 

295.55 297.62 B: mhm i agree with that too 

296.06 297.14 A: you know 

297.56 302.43 A: 'cause they have like the uh like i said b._e._t. black entertainment television 

302.55 303.96 A: and 

304.18 309.95 A: it might be approximately a handful of white people in the audience they don't want 

309.99 313.39 A: (( to i don't you know not necessarily think that )) 

313.76 327.63 A: (( you want to hear that you know what i'm saying if i was that person sitting in the audience of in the minority of whatever group they were talking about i would be like i feel a little out of place you know what i'm )) 

315.57 316.32 B: right 

325.74 326.77 B: mhm 

326.91 329.78 B: mhm well if they want people to come again and listen to their 

329.87 334.30 B: comedy they've got to make it for all audiences to listen it's 

332.44 335.92 A: saying exactly exactly so 

336.16 339.20 A: that's basically how i tell the difference apart 

339.26 341.24 A: between the the two 

342.36 343.85 A: so anything else with you 

344.22 347.40 B: (( um i'm just trying to think what else )) 

347.89 348.91 B: um 

349.50 353.64 B: i think too like if they pick on kids it's the like a 

354.85 357.80 B: comedy central or or comedy 

358.10 364.06 B: place you how you said you could bring your kids and stuff um i think if they are going to gear it towards families then 

360.43 361.34 A: uh-huh 

364.13 368.15 B: they should be in good taste of what they pick on kids for 'cause it could affect 

368.52 373.90 B: if they're going to pick on how they look or something like that it should just be good family fun 

373.53 376.85 A: right exactly yeah 

375.41 377.75 B: kids get sensitive and 

377.86 380.10 B: if they're picked on in the audience 

378.14 379.42 A: (( 'cause )) 

379.59 383.27 A: yeah 'cause you have to remember that kids get picked on 

383.52 398.42 A: at school so they definitely don't want to go out on the night with mommy and daddy to this comedy show and get singled out in the audience i think that's pretty tough on them too you know so that's ano- that's a good point what you just said there 

384.41 385.49 B: mhm 

390.51 392.23 B: right right 

393.18 394.34 B: mhm 

398.71 403.20 A: [mn] so they gave us a hard topic tonight 

400.73 402.01 B: (( i think it would be )) 

402.60 407.14 B: they did [laughter] 

403.27 415.36 A: [laughter] so yeah that's basically it for me i mean and i think comedy can be informative too i like comedy that's informative 

415.69 416.65 A: (( that's )) 

416.94 419.36 A: you know how do i explain this 

419.41 427.22 A: comedy that relays both points of view in a humorous manner 

427.81 429.97 B: mhm that's a good point 

428.46 430.40 A: on a particular subject 

430.43 432.33 A: i like comedy like that 

432.47 433.72 A: i really do 

433.82 435.38 A: like um 

435.81 439.19 A: okay say for instance they're talking about 

439.41 449.34 A: men and women relationships and things like that it could be very informative because it's telling you how a man thinks 

449.16 450.32 B: mhm 

449.98 456.50 A: but it's tell you what a woman's going to respond and vice versa you see what i'm saying 

455.24 460.12 B: everyone can relate to that [laughter] 

457.99 463.15 A: [laughter] i like stuff like that that's that's pretty cool with me 

462.92 464.53 B: i do i like that too 

464.25 465.34 A: yeah 

465.88 466.79 B: (( and that's )) 

466.09 471.07 A: i just i just i'm not too much of a comedian person 

471.12 473.29 A: even though i do have my 

473.33 475.17 A: pick pick for 

475.28 477.77 A: comics uh and things like that 

477.96 483.97 A: but i don't watch too many comedians or things like that but when i do try one on t._v. 

479.83 481.28 B: mhm 

484.47 493.41 A: he has to be absolutely hilarious i have to be cracking my fast for me to actually stop and watch this person 

487.73 489.82 B: [noise] 

493.26 494.66 B: mhm 

493.89 501.42 A: you know what i'm saying he has to have i think a good comedy show is a person who has the um 

501.96 505.83 A: the facial expression like jim carrey 

505.54 508.79 B: he's funny he's one of my favorites [laughter] 

506.23 512.61 A: he is funny no matter what the heck this man does he is funny 

509.29 510.48 B: [laughter] 

511.11 512.22 B: [laughter] 

512.66 523.34 A: okay so i like com- comedians like that this have the facial expression they have the body movements and they have the jokes all tied in 

522.76 524.20 B: (( [laughter] )) 

523.43 526.81 A: i think that is a good comedy right there 

526.63 529.80 B: they need to have more of those around [laughter] 

529.41 542.61 A: yeah [laughter] yeah they sure do [laughter] 'cause i see i see a lot of comedians they look like oh that's another thing when i see comedians look like they're struggling to get a laugh 

532.49 534.65 B: [laughter] 

543.05 545.48 A: i don't think that's very good comedy 

545.19 546.01 B: no 

546.16 547.21 A: i think 

546.23 550.50 B: i mean you can you can tell when you go to a show if they've 

550.66 552.53 B: they're brand new or 

552.25 553.95 A: right right 

552.83 553.76 B: yeah 

554.23 556.67 A: i don't think that's very good comedy i think that's 

555.64 558.48 B: and it's awkward 'cause nobody's laughing and then 

558.08 559.97 A: yeah [laughter] 

559.03 564.94 B: everybody's making a joke out of the guy [laughter] 

562.00 563.73 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

564.24 567.71 A: right right right i think maybe they should um 

568.06 577.93 A: let people like that practice more or something like that before they get on live t._v. and things like that 'cause i've seen several comedians on live t._v. 

577.81 586.10 A: that it's just like what is he talking about [laughter] [laughter] this is not funny at all 

580.51 583.17 B: [laughter] 

586.31 587.54 A: so 

587.83 590.32 A: i just i just like to be um 

590.41 599.33 A: i just like to have somebody just make me laugh you know like jim carrey like i say he is just funny all the way around we need more comedians like that [laughter]
