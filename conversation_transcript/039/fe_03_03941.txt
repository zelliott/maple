60.02 73.85 B: i'm not black but i just i don't know like i don't think black people found it funny like i'm sure some did but [mn] it's kind of like you know why does queen latifah have to be out of prison why you know because she's black [mn] like i don't know 

72.71 75.40 A: yeah i think it's also like 

76.28 77.12 A: (( [sigh] )) 

77.17 79.04 A: i mean i think there 

80.37 82.70 A: are some things that are i mean 

82.74 85.19 A: they could be funny you know but um 

85.09 94.81 A: there are some jokes that are just like so tired and that seems to be wh- why people making comedies about black people always seem to be about [mn] like this one where it's like oh there's a white guy 

94.66 102.09 A: and he is acting black and it's funny because he's a stiff uptight white guy but he's acting black 

99.39 100.78 B: exactly 

101.52 108.50 B: do you know that commercial that's like you know [mn] um it's it's a i don't know what it's a commercial about but he's like um 

108.41 122.97 B: painfully unfunny comedy you know it's sold out and then the guy's talking to his wife and he's like but we can see you know a sequel that has no point for you know at eight o'clock or and they're just talking about the movies for what they are 'cause they're basically all the same 

122.87 124.59 A: (( i don't know i've never seen that )) 

124.00 136.26 B: it's it's a pretty funny commercial and he's just talking about like all the movies and they're just generalizing all the titles and it's like oh it's about a cop that loses his partner and then goes ransacking and then wins the day like how many movies have you seen like that 

125.52 126.51 A: [laughter] 

129.21 130.17 A: mhm 

136.08 137.72 A: mhm 

136.75 142.27 B: so i think all the comedies are pretty much i don't know i haven't seen really an original comedy in a long time 

143.26 147.57 A: hm i saw zoolander pretty recently and thought that was funny 

146.95 151.87 B: i didn't see that is that the one with all the ah comic heroes 

148.17 149.04 A: (( oh )) 

151.82 155.04 A: ah no that's the one that where they're spoofing male models 

155.14 156.65 B: oh i didn't see that one 

155.91 158.99 A: and it has like ben stiller as a male model [mn] 

158.23 162.62 B: i i think ben stiller's pretty funny like i think the things he does is pretty cool 

162.52 176.87 A: yeah i mean nobody would ever think that he's actually a male model in real life [laughter] from the way he looks but he's like he has all these like looks that he has perfected and they're all exactly the same look where he just like turns his head and like looks sultry into the camera [laughter] 

166.10 168.02 B: [laughter] 

175.92 177.44 B: [laughter] 

177.02 184.31 A: and like he's really dumb unless the jokes revolve around all the male models being really stupid but they're usually pretty funny 

184.00 186.83 B: i thought adam sandler movies were pretty funny too 

186.54 188.91 A: (( [mn] oh really i haven't seen him for a long time )) 

188.69 191.19 B: really i don't know i saw like big daddy 

191.21 196.33 B: and a couple of others but um all right comedy in bad taste 

198.21 199.33 B: i don't know 

198.59 199.39 A: (( mm )) 

201.23 207.13 A: have you seen the thing on the internet um i think it's called like super furry friends or something

206.71 208.65 B: no what is that mhm 

208.39 209.50 A: um 

209.69 218.04 A: i- it's like a bunch of really cute little cartoon characters but um i mean the whole point is just to be shocking basically 

218.17 222.71 A: so it's like little cute cartoon characters like cartoon squirrel is like 

224.86 235.04 A: [mn] and then ah like an acorn will like fall on the on the squirrel because she's like climbing a tree and like crush her and you know go into her eye or something like that 

234.20 236.13 B: that's like horrible 

236.14 237.48 A: it's like what 

236.83 238.32 B: it's horrible 

237.95 239.76 A: yeah [laughter] 

239.41 241.75 B: my god i mean it's funny for us 

240.56 246.68 A: but i mean it's like basically like every punch line is just like something horribly violent happening to the characters 

244.93 246.35 B: pretty much 

246.92 249.51 A: and like blood spraying everywhere and stuff 

248.91 254.28 B: i don't know well what about like okay speaking of lets say tasteless comedy what about like chris rock 

254.54 258.25 B: like some of the stuff he says is funny but some of it is just kinda

314.21 317.41 B: okay that's like number four i'm just trying to get you to get chris rock 

317.38 318.59 A: yeah 

318.14 321.45 B: okay when does comedy become tasteless 

322.21 323.24 B: [laughter] 

323.14 324.07 A: (( hm )) 

323.60 324.79 B: tough question 

326.85 330.46 B: i think when its just taken too far when it's not 

331.07 345.50 B: obviously not meant to be funny where it's just just hurting people basically 'cause you're mad or whatever like i don't know i guess some i guess some white people do it to black people or other minorities and they think it's funny but i don't think so 

345.42 349.73 A: mhm yeah i would agree with like the minority comedy thing because 

350.19 354.54 A: [mn] um i think like a lot of the time like i'm of 

354.46 365.22 A: chinese descent and um like a lot of the time when i see movies where they have like chinese characters and like in american comedy films like i find it pretty offensive because [lipsmack] 

365.38 373.29 A: um in some cases like it's funny like i just saw shanghai nights and i thought that was actually pretty funny like i wasn't offended by it 

373.35 380.61 A: but i think the difference is that um sometimes they'll be making fun of stereotypes and sometimes they'll just be making fun of um 

377.81 379.05 B: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

380.92 384.71 A: you know things that are actually kind of true and that's why it's funny you know 

384.29 387.45 B: mhm what about like did you ever see like margaret cho 

387.73 390.78 A: um no i've heard she's really vulgar oh 

390.16 396.31 B: yeah she is and she's like i mean she makes fun of her mother all the time and her mother i think they're japanese 

396.12 397.31 A: she's korean 

397.02 401.18 B: i'm sorry she's korean and she just she makes fun of her mother 

401.21 405.22 B: and it's it's funny because but at the same time like 

401.22 402.02 A: mhm 

405.31 408.96 B: but she's mak- like it's okay because she's making fun of her mother 

408.77 409.52 A: mhm 

409.88 411.36 B: so i don't know 

412.67 418.29 B: but like um do you ever watch like b._t. and you see like kind of like the black people making fun of the black people 

418.06 419.42 A: mhm 

418.96 427.69 B: i don't see like i don't know if that's tasteless or if that should actually happen just because i don't know it seems sometimes like they're putting themselves down 

427.97 441.63 B: like you know i was watching it the other day and like [mn] black people you know love to drink liquor or something like that and e- everybody just started laughing and you know they progressed in the joke and stuff like that [mn] i don't know if that's like 

441.67 444.30 B: i don't know i just don't know like if it's 

444.47 450.84 B: funny because it's actually true and they can relate or if it's funny because it's comedic funny 

450.67 451.46 A: mhm 

451.43 455.40 B: see like why is and then you get into the all ethical of why is something funny 

454.66 459.16 A: yeah i mean i think some things are just funny because 

459.88 463.32 A: well i mean like have you heard those really offensive jokes 

463.50 464.86 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

465.65 467.39 A: (( i mean like [cough] )) 

467.52 479.15 A: i don't even really want to repeat them but you know there's like really offensive jokes that are just kind of like puns or [mn] or whatever um but they're based on like really offensive racial stereotypes 

478.87 480.48 B: oh yeah like um 

480.68 484.20 B: what about like polish jokes or like jewish jokes 

484.27 487.30 A: yeah like that kind of jokes or 

485.31 486.41 B: or 

487.15 490.97 B: yeah there's like oh there's there's three guys 

491.27 497.79 B: i don't know it's like oh what did the it's just it's some of 'em are stupid like what did the eight year old black kid get for christmas 

498.12 499.54 B: your bike 

498.39 499.19 A: what 

499.64 500.85 A: (( oh okay [laughter] )) 

500.40 503.08 B: [laughter] see like why is that funny 

500.89 501.79 A: (( yes )) 

503.49 509.11 A: or like why what's the difference between a black man and um 

509.12 511.81 A: and a pizza i think it's one that i heard 

511.31 513.68 B: like six inches or something i don't know 

514.10 516.83 A: oh [laughter] no um 

517.01 519.26 A: the pizza can feed a family of four 

520.80 522.51 B: (( oh i get it okay )) 

520.83 521.39 A: (( [noise] )) 

522.95 526.82 B: see like i i don't know like some of 'em are funny some of 'em aren't 

526.77 527.87 A: mhm 

527.27 533.09 B: and i just don't know why and i don't know what crosses that line and that's i guess that's what we're supposed to be talking about 

532.87 534.28 A: mhm 

533.76 538.52 B: ah it's weird like ah you know what's the object of a jewish football game 

538.97 541.02 B: they get the quarterback 

539.51 540.28 A: (( [mn] )) 

541.32 543.40 A: oh [laughter] 

542.99 545.15 B: (( so like i don't know )) 

546.10 549.72 B: i don't know see that would be tasteless probably to a jewish person 

549.58 550.62 A: mhm 

549.95 551.36 B: but i'm not jewish 

551.89 560.87 B: so i don't know it's weird i guess everyone takes offence to their own ethnic or social class that's being made fun of i guess 

560.56 561.97 A: mhm 

561.32 569.80 B: if that makes any sense so like if you were short you'd be overly sensitive to short jokes or if you were fat you'd be overly sensitive to fat jokes 

569.58 570.83 A: mhm 

570.25 573.31 B: so oh okay here's one did you see the nutty professor 

573.08 573.83 A: (( mm mm )) 

573.82 583.96 B: oh man [laughter] we've never seen the same movies okay 'cause there's just a scene they're just doing your momma jokes and they just took it too far 

581.82 582.75 A: mhm 

584.40 586.15 A: oh no i didn't see it 

584.84 593.92 B: 'cause he was he was he was fat and he was just doing like so many fat jokes and then it just like hurt his feelings like it was funny after a while and then they just did too many of 'em 

593.34 594.62 A: [laughter] 

594.46 596.56 B: so it's just crazy 

596.69 597.90 A: mhm 

597.10 599.26 B: (( how long are we supposed to talk for )) 

599.05 599.89 A: ten minutes
