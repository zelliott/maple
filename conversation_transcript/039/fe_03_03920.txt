397.21 398.47 A: mhm 

398.34 399.57 B: oh 

398.80 402.18 A: and i'm sure you've heard of the spongebob squarepants craze

403.01 403.89 A: that's 

404.43 406.88 A: real stupid [laughter] 

405.47 408.35 B: oh is it oh i've not seen it either 

410.07 414.16 B: [mn] oh so our topic is comedies is that what we're supposed to be 

414.22 415.89 A: yeah i guess 

415.53 417.39 B: i've not done this before have you 

416.99 419.02 A: no [laughter] 

417.64 418.75 B: oh 

418.85 422.92 B: oh th- they were wrong they put two inexperienced people together [laughter] 

421.81 423.14 A: yeah really 

423.16 423.91 B: (( [laughter] )) 

424.11 431.69 A: but um no like i said this is a tough one for me because i don't really watch too many of the the 

424.24 425.00 B: oh 

432.07 437.07 A: newer comedies i tried to watch friends before because i heard so much about that 

436.50 437.97 B: mhm 

437.14 439.35 A: but i just really couldn't get into it 

439.05 439.99 B: (( mm )) 

440.47 441.05 B: (( [mn] )) 

440.99 443.07 A: so i would have to say 

443.84 450.51 A: probably the only one that still comes on prime time that i watch is um [mn] will and grace 

450.26 451.14 B: (( mm )) 

451.66 458.82 B: now how does that rate i- in comparison to you know the sex or the language i guess language wouldn't be too bad but 

458.91 460.65 B: you know the relationships 

459.15 462.39 A: there's a lot of sex in it yeah 

460.82 461.81 B: oh is there 

461.97 462.74 B: (( oh )) 

462.60 465.16 A: well it's about um [lipsmack] th- ah 

466.30 471.59 A: there's four main characters on the show two guys that are both gay 

471.40 472.25 B: (( mm )) 

471.86 475.62 A: and then two girls that are are um 

476.10 477.61 A: heterosexual 

477.59 479.14 B: oh okay 

479.09 479.77 A: (( so )) 

480.00 480.82 A: it's 

480.13 481.14 B: right 

480.89 482.05 A: but it's 

482.16 489.40 A: you know and th- and that's one you know i mean that's the thing like i said you know like that one i can't watch with my son in the room 

489.34 490.32 B: right 

490.43 491.48 B: right 

491.26 492.53 A: so you know 

493.56 498.10 A: [lipsmack] there really aren't too many on any more that i can watch with him in the room 

498.63 510.76 B: i know and that's why i never start with those because my kids were younger when those shows first came out so i just never got into them be- you're exactly right because of the kids and so you're right there i don't i think reba is the only comedy that we watch 

510.41 511.36 A: yeah 

511.66 516.77 B: 'cause [mn] well we like touched by and angel but that's not considered a comedy probably it's not a comedy 

515.57 519.56 A: no no we love touched by an angel we watch that every night 

519.49 521.61 B: but comedies 

522.01 527.36 B: and we don't get like i said we only have the antenna so we don't get a lot of channels we don't get the older stuff at all 

526.96 534.36 A: yeah yeah [mn] you see that's most of the channel ah ah we watch a lot of the um hallmark channel 

527.59 528.47 B: you know 

534.12 535.27 B: mhm 

534.49 543.80 A: because they run touched by an angel every night and um you know perry mason and quincy and stuff like that you know that you didn't have to worry about 

541.51 542.70 B: oh 

543.30 544.44 B: right 

544.09 545.97 A: you know kids looking at 

545.52 546.67 B: right 

547.13 549.60 A: so yeah we watch that a lot 

549.69 551.57 A: (( um [mn] )) 

551.80 556.95 A: we watch um the family channel and [mn] ah
