0.07 3.76 B: hello my name is gaskins i live in virginia 

3.33 6.34 A: my name is jerry and i live in wisconsin 

7.42 9.13 A: (( how are you tonight )) 

8.35 10.02 B: i'm doing fine 

9.70 10.89 A: good 

11.30 13.49 A: [mn] so the topic is comedy 

13.32 14.33 B: yes 

13.71 15.45 A: where do you draw the line 

15.27 16.18 B: right 

16.40 17.74 B: [mn] um 

18.63 21.11 B: [lipsmack] well basically i think that um 

21.20 24.91 B: good comedy or good humor consists of 

25.06 29.60 B: um number one not trying to be offensive towards other people 

29.79 30.85 B: (( [mn] um )) 

31.24 35.57 B: [lipsmack] especially i know today even with ah race or religion 

35.87 36.86 B: um 

38.43 42.75 B: [mn] because you know a lot of people think that um 

42.76 50.09 B: you know it's funny to make fun of others as far as their ra- their race or religion is concerned but 

50.63 56.62 B: you know ah then again too i always think you know well would we tell the same joke in front of that same person 

57.11 65.69 B: and so i always try to keep that in mind if i'm going to listen to anything on television or read anything or [mn] be in a group setting you know 

65.61 74.85 B: would this type of joke be acceptable to whoever if if if it's a person that's going to be the object of the joke would it be acceptable to them 

74.90 77.48 B: if they would have listened to the same joke 

78.44 80.41 B: what about you what do you think 

80.39 92.44 A: i would of said the same thing you've said [laughter] word for word almost [laughter] absolutely i think ah people being the butt of jokes ah it depends on who you're telling the joke to 

81.99 84.65 B: (( [laughter] )) 

85.54 87.02 B: [laughter] 

92.12 93.17 B: right 

92.59 96.42 A: you know um [mn] but how do you draw that line today 

96.10 97.17 B: mhm 

97.46 100.00 A: you know we're talking about t._v. media 

99.84 100.86 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

100.06 103.09 A: i'm i'm assuming that's what we're really talking about is the t._v. 

102.70 103.77 B: (( yeah mhm right )) 

103.30 108.02 A: you know i don't ah permit i have a teenage son i don't permit him to watch 

108.29 113.44 A: you know those types of comedy shows on comedy central ah because of that 

114.00 117.69 A: unfortunately he's going to experience that at some point in his life 

117.80 121.15 A: you know so i try to ah to use my better judgement 

121.59 122.53 A: you know 

123.31 128.17 A: i i don't ah i don't like to be the butt of a joke and i don't like anybody else to be the butt of a joke 

127.80 129.08 B: right 

128.42 131.53 A: you know that's that's primarily how i feel the same way you do 

131.27 132.18 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

131.87 134.62 A: do [lipsmack] 'cause i don't like to offend anybody about anything 

135.28 145.97 A: i like peace [laughter] i was born in the sixties [laughter] but i wasn't a big sixties big you know big person but you know i i really am into this love and peace and kind of a thing you know 

136.55 138.40 B: exactly [laughter] 

138.92 140.51 B: [laughter] 

145.62 146.69 B: right 

146.02 147.93 A: let's all try to get along with each other 

147.55 148.89 B: exactly 

148.66 149.39 A: you know 

149.21 154.84 B: another thing too i think that's um you know a big part of humor is like sexual content 

155.06 157.89 B: or moral content for for example 

158.09 159.04 B: um 

160.13 171.38 B: [lipsmack] you know we we all we joke around you know every once in a while um when i mean we you know we get together with friends you know we might say something that might sound a little bit off color but 

171.56 172.61 B: um 

172.77 177.39 B: basically is it going to be something that is just totally repulsive you know 

177.31 178.36 A: right 

177.91 179.47 B: [mn] um 

179.72 186.07 B: yeah i stay away from from anything that is just too i guess raw or hard core nature 

186.20 187.05 B: um 

187.28 198.18 B: [lipsmack] and some- sometimes too you know people can call these things jokes and you know people sit around and laugh at them but really it's not it's just it's being sick minded [mn] 

197.77 203.70 A: it is and there's a lot of sick people out there today i just don't associate myself with those types of people 

203.16 204.77 B: (( yeah [cough] me neither right )) 

203.82 206.35 A: i really don't i really am very ah 

206.58 217.52 A: i tell people my husband my family and i live in a quiet little home in the country and we mind our own business we don't ah i mean we interact with people that we work with but that's as far as it goes 

217.34 221.54 B: mhm right i'm pretty much the same way too i live out in the country here and um 

217.81 218.79 A: i just 

222.28 224.20 B: [lipsmack] and i know that 

224.21 229.30 B: [cough] i grew up in i grew up in virginia beach actually and um 

228.07 229.05 A: (( okay )) 

230.31 242.68 B: [lipsmack] i know that there was a lot more exposure to things than there is coming to a rural area [mn] but and one thing i can say is that i never picked up on hanging hanging around um 

243.67 247.36 B: [mn] ah i guess the the rough crowd when i was in school 

247.03 248.07 A: mhm 

247.60 260.83 B: um i was always taught to be res- respectful and and kind to others [mn] and to stay away from people that were gonna you know do or say dirty jokes and things like that so i never grew up around that um 

261.35 266.46 B: [lipsmack] i was i was basically raised up to to be a good sound moral person 

266.38 267.17 A: yeah 

266.78 270.75 B: and ah you know i really value that a lot i really do 

270.51 276.11 A: and the older you get the more you value it especially when you have children and you passed on those values to your children 

273.61 274.61 B: (( mhm mhm right )) 

276.16 277.87 A: and i'm seeing that in my child 

277.95 291.59 A: i've got nine other brothers and sisters who've got a bunch of kids and they all very well respected adults you know my brothers and sisters are the children are something else to speak of um they don't get what they need at home and i've always believed 

281.08 282.10 B: oh wow 

284.29 285.01 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

292.07 295.42 A: that what you get from home is what you take with you through life 

294.94 296.26 B: (( exactly mm )) 

295.83 300.08 A: and um i'm not a perfect parent i wasn't given a handbook 

300.35 303.12 A: ah but i've certainly taken what i was taught 

303.24 308.72 A: growing up and i have passed that on to my son and i'm very surprised that he's turned out as good as he has 

308.25 309.51 B: yeah 

308.90 314.43 A: you know i mean he is he is a good teenager he knows where there is trouble and he stays away from it 

314.56 325.11 A: he doesn't he's not a racist he's not been out he's not anti war he you know what i mean he's just a good solid sound child and that really comes from your upbringing 

320.58 321.62 B: (( mhm mhm [mn] )) 

325.37 331.75 A: [mn] and i believe living out in the country and staying out of the big cities is is the way to do it today it's the only way we're gonna save our children 

329.25 330.33 B: mhm 

332.39 335.00 B: that i mean that was the [lipsmack] 

335.64 343.37 B: ah that was like the happiest day of my life when my father decided to move here to the country too when he retired here to this area um 

343.68 346.33 B: [lipsmack] but back on the topic real quick um 

346.82 350.12 B: [mn] i think too we also have to to look at um 

350.29 354.22 B: when we tell a joke you know what is our goal what is our objective 

355.04 356.43 B: you know um 

356.71 364.38 B: [mn] again going back to dirty jokes 'cause i think [mn] you know when you think of a topic like this you automatically think of the dirty joke um 

364.77 370.97 B: [lipsmack] you know i- is is the goal to make somebody feel uncomfortable is it to be sexist um 

371.07 373.51 B: one thing i can say i've had a 

374.07 378.66 B: kind of a uncomfortable time with is when i got into the work force um 

378.83 381.43 B: i'm only twenty one i'll be twenty two in july 

381.57 389.72 B: but when i got into the work force i had to really really guard myself against people in the work place wanting to tell 

389.75 391.81 B: um off color jokes 

392.13 399.74 B: [lipsmack] because it's so easy to catch yourself all of a sudden you know you're just typing away working away and it's so easy to catch yourself 

400.00 404.14 B: laughing at something you normally wouldn't laugh at before [mn] 

403.55 404.45 A: sure 

404.15 405.36 B: and ah 

405.62 410.59 B: so i've really had to guard myself against that and now i've i've learned to 

411.08 421.40 B: to try to filter it out or i've learned to if it just gets out of hand wherever i'm at i've learned to speak up and say hey look you know you need to take that somewhere else 

421.15 424.22 A: right but again i think it also comes with a lot of maturity 

423.80 424.78 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

424.43 432.53 A: you know when you're very young and you're in your teens e- or twenties even going into into your early thirties you ah want to be accepted by people 

432.29 433.15 B: right 

432.80 444.52 A: so you want to to laugh at their jokes so that you'll be accepted when you get to be my age [mn] in your late thirties going into your forties it's not ah it's not funny any more i don't need to be accepted by anybody 

436.10 437.12 B: mhm 

438.28 439.07 B: (( [mn] )) 

444.24 455.35 B: right and that's that's the point that i think i'm at right now is i'm learning to actually just be able to stand up and speak up for what i believe is right [laughter] you know 

444.66 445.56 A: you know 

453.75 458.72 A: you know and it's it's a good feeling isn't it it's a very good feeling 

456.01 459.05 B: yes it is it really is a good feeling 

459.20 459.88 A: huh 

459.77 461.23 B: [laughter] 

460.63 472.99 A: it is i know i've i've travelled a lot in my life and have met with a lot of different types of individuals ah different colors religions it doesn't matter and i look at them as i see myself in the mirror every day 

472.59 474.03 B: (( mhm exactly right )) 

473.44 476.40 A: i am a human being and i like to be treated with respect 

476.71 478.83 A: and ah they deserve the same 

478.50 479.62 B: mhm 

479.02 481.51 A: we are all made by the very same one person 

481.21 482.32 B: right 

481.72 490.21 A: you know not to get on a religion subject but you know we are all one per- you know what i mean we are all human beings and we all should be treated that way 

483.82 484.97 B: (( right i understand )) 

486.99 487.93 B: (( right yeah yeah [laughter] )) 

490.52 501.22 A: so yeah the comic thing like i said i will make i can make you laugh i can make you smile just by smiling at you i don't need to tell you a dirty joke or a sexist joke [mn] that's what i do every day at my job 

500.86 501.90 B: right 

501.30 504.16 A: and that's my reward every day when i come home 

503.76 504.81 B: mhm 

504.18 507.54 A: is knowing i made somebody smile for whatever reason 

507.11 508.42 B: exactly 

507.83 514.05 A: and ah that's that's my comedy my comedy routine every day [laughter] is to make you smile 

512.61 513.44 B: (( [mn] )) 

513.70 521.05 B: yeah um personally you know i'm i'm a christian and it's just like what the bible speaks about um you know 

521.15 526.78 B: laughter worketh like a medicine or a merry heart worketh like a medicine or something like that that verse 

526.44 527.59 A: yeah 

526.84 532.86 B: and you know comedy or humor is to be used to help um heal your soul 

533.00 543.08 B: in in a way if you're having a down day or you're feeling a little bit depressed it's it's there to help pick you up and to um i guess help others around you 

543.15 548.29 B: or show others around you hey you know i love you i care about you i want to make you happy 

548.46 549.69 B: and um 

550.19 554.93 B: [lipsmack] you know our society has just wandered so far away from 

555.42 568.04 B: just having natural i guess natural pleasures and they get you know drug use alcoholism all those different things and it's like people are just not satisfied with a clean joke 

568.10 576.85 A: no they're not but there's a lot of really sad things going on in this world today and i can see in some aspects of a comedian 

572.06 573.16 B: mhm 

577.01 578.65 A: [lipsmack] ah like chris rock 

578.35 579.48 B: mhm 

578.82 582.63 A: for an example he well he has a very sad life 

582.36 583.36 B: (( yeah right yeah )) 

582.87 592.40 A: he does a very sad life but he takes it out on his comedy routine to make other people laugh and if you've ever heard the term [mn] when you're sore and you're hurt 

592.54 595.90 A: you you use that to make other people laugh 

596.02 599.05 A: and that that just tells you how much pain 

599.39 599.89 A: and
