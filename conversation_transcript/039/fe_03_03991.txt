37.43 43.33 A: hm i mean i generally look at it as intent you know like um [mn] 

43.36 51.77 A: i think if it's if you know if you know who you're talking to and what you're talking and if you know the person's history then you can get away with a lot more than 

49.25 50.21 B: mhm 

51.82 57.72 A: you know i mean [mn] i'm not talking about blatant racism or sexism or anything like that but 

57.07 68.15 B: yeah i i guess the company that you're in at the time [mn] really um is important i guess you really have to use discretion depending on who you're with [laughter] 

67.92 68.93 A: uh-huh 

68.95 73.40 A: this is sort of a dear subject to my heart 'cause i'm a stand up comic so

73.71 76.87 A: yeah so i think a lot about this and it's 

77.09 81.32 A: i don't know it's very weird like going to different places i can 

81.82 87.05 A: like you know i i i do a lot of jokes about racism and i use a lot of irony 

85.03 86.05 B: mhm 

87.03 98.88 A: and if i play black clubs th- they're down with it i i play at indian casinos and stuff like that people are down with it but when i play predominantly white clubs they get all nervous they're like oh can you talk about that [mn] but um

114.76 116.12 A: (( so what do you think )) 

116.57 125.45 B: ah well like i said i think it really depends on the company that you're with at the time you know and and what type of humor it is 

125.47 126.50 A: uh-huh 

126.51 129.53 B: what type of humor do you do on stage

136.06 142.10 B: like what are what are your topics that you usually um t- use to for your comedy routine 

142.37 145.24 A: um well i used to um 

145.50 152.48 A: want to be a marine biologist i have a degree in that so i talk a lot about that um [laughter] which ah

179.04 180.12 B: oh 

180.53 182.92 A: here in portland which is 

183.13 187.31 A: a very dog friendly city but not that that has much to do with comedy though so 

186.53 190.01 B: [laughter] are there many comedy clubs there 

190.09 192.90 A: um there's only one actually um there's a 

192.96 198.32 A: um you know i tour a lot i'm gonna be a i'm actually doing a three week tour of california in july so 

198.10 199.76 B: oh that should be fun 

198.53 199.37 A: (( you know )) 

200.08 214.66 A: yeah it's way whether way better than usually which is like montana and places like that see that's weird like i stopped doing a lot of my racism jokes there because people were laughing but with no shred of irony and i started to feel kinda creepy about it [mn] like it was 

205.47 206.37 B: [laughter] 

207.56 208.76 B: [laughter] 

213.17 214.57 B: [laughter] 

214.72 217.54 A: like no no you don't understand so 

217.88 221.91 A: [mn] i don't know and people are always coming up to me and just telling me jokes that are just 

222.14 229.26 A: out and out offensive [laughter] you know like you can use that in your act i'm like yeah if i wanted to get pounded or something or [mn] but 

223.55 225.32 B: [laughter] 

227.92 229.75 B: yeah [laughter] 

229.85 235.59 B: i guess you have to be careful about what you joke about depending on where you are what part of the country 

230.22 231.44 A: anyway 

235.52 244.37 A: mhm [mn] but you know and [mn] i don't know i i just think a lot of it is in the teller you know like and you know i guess being as um 

244.44 253.61 A: it's easier for me to talk about you know i'm italian from the east coast and i can talk about that and ah it's harder for other people to talk about that 'cause that's not them you know 

249.03 249.93 B: mhm 

253.69 266.92 A: and [mn] i work a lot of black karma i actually talk about racism all the time and that's fine you know and because it's like more directly something impinging on their lives you know and um [mn] so i think it's ah you know 

263.25 265.00 B: (( mhm )) 

266.80 271.34 A: if it's coming from your experience it's a lot easier to talk about pretty much anything you know [mn] 

271.46 272.38 A: like 

272.63 279.07 A: you know if it's something that is directly from you there's a lot more room to talk about things that might normally be risque subjects you know 

279.39 280.19 B: (( hm )) 

279.42 280.98 A: so [mn] 

280.72 291.92 B: [mn] w- well how do you do you like draw the line at with certain topics depending on what part of the country you're in and the type of audience that you're playing to 

292.19 301.84 A: unfortunately yes you know and i'm trying to get away from that you know y- you notice comics who are more established and they have the ab- like you know they have people who come to see them as opposed to coming to see comedy 

301.74 312.75 A: and i really can't talk about you know i do some edgar allen poe jokes that don't really work real well in eastern montana you know [laughter] like um [mn] so [mn] i mean so that's ah 

306.96 307.82 B: [laughter] 

308.36 309.74 B: [laughter] 

312.82 321.19 A: when i'm in a place like s- seattle or san francisco i can usually talk about whatever the hell i want you know or back in baltimore or whatever so [lipsmack]

502.60 513.31 A: yeah but if you like that's kind of like he is brilliant at looking ah like he's just coming up with stuff but the thing is you know after thirty years of doing comedy he's got pretty much a joke for anything you know 

510.56 511.58 B: mhm 

513.31 518.96 A: and that's the cool thing is when you can make people see- seem like they're like what you're saying is just off the cuff you know 

518.24 519.22 B: (( mhm )) 

519.10 520.32 A: and um 

520.43 535.09 A: you know [mn] and l- like a lot of people like you see comics talking to cr- people in the crowd and they'll ask like a question and you always get like the k- the trick is to always give like a yes or no an- the the question has to have like a yes or no answer and they'll have a joke written for each answer so 

531.92 532.82 B: (( mhm )) 

534.18 535.38 B: [laughter]
