52.52 54.16 B: (( and ah ))

63.42 64.71 B: (( it )) 

64.42 71.27 A: you shouldn't be limiting them but at the same time you don't want to expose them to too much at you know exactly 

69.25 70.64 B: (( right )) 

70.65 79.21 B: in fact there was a couple of times whenever i was ready to look at something and one of the kids walked through and go we can't look at that it's t._v. fourteen 

79.13 90.50 B: and i looked at them i was going hey it's working you know so i changed it you know i changed it and and i thought hey they are paying attention so and

84.72 85.98 A: right right 

87.78 91.19 A: exactly i mean that's that's the way to have it you know 

91.05 94.71 B: yeah and and like anything else it's what they're g- they're used to 

94.58 95.76 A: (( right right )) 

94.84 97.22 B: if they're used to the environment 

97.36 102.28 B: and i'm not talking about anybody else but i guess i am i have a cousin that lives next door 

102.29 103.10 A: uh-huh

107.91 109.10 A: (( right right )) 

112.47 113.37 A: right 

112.76 125.46 B: so i've noticed that when they're when something is on that's fairly open my kids will will not make a big deal of it but there's things to play with there's other parts of the room or they can go next door and play 

118.33 119.10 A: uh-huh 

125.45 126.87 A: exactly 

126.27 128.27 B: and that's what they do so 

127.92 133.58 A: well that's that's that's actually the they're responsible and you know getting s- 

132.86 136.72 B: but now i i'm n- i'm going to tell you the truth 

136.80 137.63 A: uh-huh 

136.86 139.66 B: i'm fifty two so i've seen 

138.36 139.14 A: uh-huh 

139.80 147.03 B: the when comedy first came on television and i was younger where my kids are now 

143.03 143.93 A: right 

147.01 148.11 A: right 

147.18 151.69 B: and what they're showing now and ah there's quite a swing 

151.89 153.03 A: yeah 

152.39 154.64 B: there is quite a swing and ah 

154.67 156.10 B: it's ah 

157.21 159.70 B: i guess it's just a sign of the times 

159.38 171.04 A: yeah exactly i mean i'm only i'm only eighteen actually but you know i i definitely do you know my my memory doesn't go nearly as far back but i definitely do remember 

170.89 184.55 A: the difference between the cartoons and you know the stuff growing up as a kid as compared to what's what's on t._v. now what's accessible to someone you know you know five or six years old now i mean it's insane 

174.98 176.10 B: right 

182.79 183.93 B: sure 

184.14 185.22 B: well 

185.34 191.50 B: in your generation things come a lot quicker than they did in mine 

188.01 188.82 A: uh-huh 

190.05 191.51 A: yeah 

191.84 198.38 B: you know ours was a [mn] where people that ah in certain type of ah 

199.20 210.48 B: religions and i'm not trying to get into it but they weren't e- they they thought leave it to beaver and father knows best was really pushing the envelope back then 

209.82 210.86 A: really 

210.60 212.67 B: yeah and 

211.54 213.45 A: wow and [laughter] 

213.16 217.76 B: and ah well even showing lucy some of the old lucy shows 

217.38 218.23 A: uh-huh 

217.90 224.67 B: where they actually had a double bed and they would show that i mean i- it was like i'm not believing they're showing this you know 

224.06 225.86 A: [laughter] 

224.81 236.53 B: where nowdays it is nothing for it to go way past that way past it i mean there's almost ah nothing left to the imagination if you really look at it 

230.34 231.67 A: (( i know )) 

236.18 244.56 A: well that's true i mean yeah the it's it's really it's really yeah gone way past any sort of you know line 

236.74 237.66 B: (( you know so )) 

241.67 242.49 B: you know 

244.56 247.30 B: you know you mentioned cartoons a while ago 

244.60 245.65 A: that 

247.17 248.91 A: right 

248.13 255.11 B: with myself growing up and really starting to pay attention to cartoons was probably in the middle fifties 

255.20 256.04 A: uh-huh 

255.43 263.13 B: and then of course they they they stayed fairly strong into the seventies because i can remember ah the cosby kids 

263.13 263.99 A: right 

263.16 274.00 B: you know being a a a big deal on saturday morning and me being in my probably thirties getting up making sure i was going to watch that you know but ah 

271.24 272.67 A: [laughter] yeah 

274.67 288.08 B: it one thing i have noticed about the cartoons my ki- my kids watch tom and jerry which is cool you know [mn] that that's still pretty neat but you can tell the difference between the old ones 

277.81 278.48 A: (( uh-huh )) 

280.56 281.55 A: right 

281.74 283.33 A: yeah 

285.18 286.83 A: right 

287.96 290.54 A: right yeah yeah 

288.16 293.77 B: and the new ones the old ones really had distinctive detail 

293.96 294.79 A: yeah 

294.21 306.45 B: and and and even the coloration and the and the artistry in it was is you can tell where the the computer came in and did even the difference in the music 

303.21 304.72 A: right 

306.34 307.42 A: yeah 

306.80 307.84 B: (( so [mn] )) 

307.70 310.22 A: i mean it's a lost art almost yeah 

309.54 315.55 B: well i believe that's right because people used to actually draw those by hand 

314.82 317.58 A: exactly every frame by frame right 

316.81 325.74 B: right and then flip through it and that's how they and it took days weeks you know to to get a a little eight or ten minute stint you know 

320.06 320.71 A: (( uh-huh )) 

325.23 327.56 A: (( right right )) 

325.78 334.15 B: going and those things like i said i'm aging myself i used to watch tom and jerry in between movies 

334.24 335.12 A: right 

334.35 336.72 B: that i had to go to a movie house and watch 

336.58 338.07 A: right right 

337.09 343.72 B: but and now i don't think they even ah i hadn't been to a movie in so long i don't think they do that anymore 

343.18 345.88 A: no they yeah they definitely don't yeah 

345.19 349.26 B: they'll preview a movie that they want you to come back and see 

348.96 350.04 A: right 

349.42 354.62 B: but very rarely or even at all will they ever show a cartoon you know 

354.58 358.14 A: yeah i don't i don't remember that ever you know 

357.46 362.17 B: yeah well then it it's a and i think once again it's the mindset 'cause 

362.39 369.60 B: here we go again it's pretty neat you know you being on the younger end and me being on the other end because movie houses to me 

366.99 367.84 A: right 

369.43 370.26 A: uh-huh 

369.64 372.13 B: sat four and five hundred people 

372.08 373.18 A: wow 

372.69 374.60 B: movie houses today 

373.93 376.17 A: that's unbelievable yes 

375.27 378.39 B: sit sit very very ah 

376.31 377.51 A: [laughter] 

378.44 383.06 B: i would say less than a hundred you know i i may be wrong 

382.26 384.58 A: oh yeah i mean yeah 

383.29 387.36 B: they're like little alleyways instead of these big theaters you know 

386.53 389.94 A: right yeah and that's that's an experience in itself 

389.94 392.85 B: and and where what part of the country are you from 

392.57 394.79 A: i'm ah from new york actually 

394.10 397.68 B: from new york okay i'm from fort worth texas 

395.08 395.80 A: yeah 

397.36 398.35 A: oh okay 

398.04 406.86 B: so in texas when i was growing up there used to be two things that were fairly prominent a lot of drive ins 

400.81 401.56 A: uh-huh 

406.68 407.51 A: uh-huh 

407.25 411.74 B: and then a lot of ah movie houses in neighborhoods 

411.65 412.72 A: oh really 

412.56 425.65 B: and then there were like four of 'em downtown that were the big movie houses that's what i was saying they were even double tiered they're like ah carnegie hall you know they were they were that large i mean and they had stages 

421.46 422.58 A: wow 

423.72 426.24 A: that's that's incredible 

425.85 439.23 B: the whole bit you know but of course they're not there now they're all knocked down or i think one of them is actually ah been made into a ah portion of a parking lot and a a downtown apartment you know how they make 

427.48 428.30 A: [laughter] 

430.95 431.92 A: oh 

438.09 439.09 A: really 

439.16 452.60 B: make these uh old ah office buildings if they're not being used as offices they'll make them into these warehouse slash apartment looking things so that's what they're sort of ah gearing to 

439.35 440.60 A: (( that's tragic )) 

447.35 448.31 A: right 

452.84 455.36 A: exactly yeah that's that's 

453.31 463.73 B: but um yeah and like like where you have movie houses now there's like eight or ten together or more like the big tinseltowns you know there's twenty or thirty of them there 

459.39 460.03 A: (( yeah )) 

463.24 465.00 A: mhm yeah 

463.70 468.53 B: you know and and ah and that that was just uncalled uncalled for of course 

469.12 474.75 B: the drive ins i can't name you one here a- around here there's some in 

473.19 479.57 A: yeah i've i've never been to one in my life actually i think there's one around where i live but [laughter] 

475.86 477.50 B: really 

479.42 486.79 B: yeah now those were neat because in in the summer you could go and just sit out put the speaker out and just sit on the car 

479.71 481.04 A: i've never been to it 

482.53 483.32 A: uh-huh 

486.59 488.14 A: yeah exactly 

487.12 488.01 B: you know 

487.94 502.25 B: watch the movie and if you wanted to go get something to eat you could you know and ah it was pretty neat but that those went by real fast i mean they're still here in texas but it's in the very small small towns 

492.08 493.07 A: (( right )) 

494.03 495.03 A: yeah 

498.59 499.25 A: uh-huh 

501.86 503.21 A: right right 

502.29 509.33 B: you know to where it's ah they probab- the only way that they can actually get cable is probably by dish 

509.52 516.75 B: and be and be tuned in that way yeah and they're they're probably not on a a mainline cable like we here we are here 

509.55 510.87 A: oh right 

516.53 518.20 A: (( right right )) 

516.90 524.29 B: you know but um as far as the comedy back again because we need to get back on that if ah 

521.63 522.53 A: [laughter] 

525.44 529.01 B: i think a lot of the comedy these days 

530.07 533.56 B: is just as funny as it was when it first started on television 

533.46 534.68 A: right 

534.05 545.92 B: you know it really has it it's ah it's taken a little bit like we've said before a different mindset there's a lot more things that are open but ah oh 

543.42 544.62 A: mhm 

546.51 553.20 B: but there's been a lot of guys that [mn] have gone through comedy that were i guess what you'd call the ah 

550.47 551.32 A: (( yeah )) 

555.05 563.60 B: the first guys on online you know that that actually took all the flack for doing what they did when when in reality you could go 

557.22 558.36 A: right right 

560.91 561.97 A: yeah 

563.44 576.29 B: on your television in new york like i can here in fort worth and go right through the channels and hear the same thing and now it's acceptable on television in your own house 

567.21 568.04 A: uh-huh 

570.98 573.17 A: exactly yeah 

576.18 583.55 B: where back then when these guys were you know ah burning the pass for these guys that are on television now 

576.38 577.56 A: (( right )) 

583.90 587.67 B: ah they were doing it in theaters and live shows 

587.31 589.31 A: yeah exactly 

588.00 589.92 B: you know and getting arrested 

589.96 592.63 B: for saying a few choice words you
