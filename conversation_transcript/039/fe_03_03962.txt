51.95 53.10 A: (( oh [mn] )) 

53.75 55.75 A: well the 

56.36 60.39 A: poking fun at different races now i don't do that 

61.14 63.04 A: um or 

63.58 64.61 A: you know 

64.65 68.33 A: sexual comedy or anything like that i don't go for that either 

68.78 73.76 B: [mn] well we we seem to have a a familiar ah agreeance on that one um 

72.72 74.20 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

74.06 80.88 B: ah because you know ah i'm an up and coming actor ah i'm i'm trying to get into the business anyway which 

80.71 91.39 B: that may be a comedy in itself but ah [laughter] um when i look comedy i i feel that ah you h- you hit it right on the head when you said ah 

91.39 103.64 B: w- we needed to stay away from um race comedy um in the sense that um this is how i feel i feel that if you are a certain color 

95.94 96.77 A: right 

104.52 108.30 B: and you live that race 'cause you are that race 

108.32 109.30 B: (( um )) 

109.87 111.24 B: it gives you 

113.21 122.31 B: [mn] it's okay for you tell jokes about [noise] okay like [noise] for instance i'm white it's okay for me to make fun of white culture because 

122.55 136.07 B: i am a white person dealing with being a white person and so the only thing that i know is how it feels to be a white person [noise] um whereas a black person i feel that their humor is funny if they're a black person 

130.33 131.29 A: right 

135.91 150.90 B: um and they an- and they're joking about black humor because that's what they know and that's that's what makes me laugh but when it's a white person that's making fun of black people or um you know [mn] to me that's not funny because 

140.99 141.74 A: right 

150.89 155.68 B: if you don't know what it's like to live a day in that person's shoes 

156.35 161.02 B: you have no right to make jokes about it 

160.35 161.41 A: right 

161.24 163.06 B: um so 

163.30 171.88 B: i totally agree with you on that and then the other thing the vulgarity thing um i don't think humor should be strictly g. rated um 

166.92 167.90 A: oh yeah 

172.05 175.24 B: but there needs to be good taste um 

173.80 175.72 A: yes yes 

175.87 189.37 B: sexual humor i i- it just doesn't appeal to me i think i think one of the greatest actors is robin williams n- notice i said actors um he is not a great stand up comedian 

183.50 184.60 A: oh yeah 

189.34 190.26 A: yeah 

189.65 194.98 B: um i don't feel that he is because when he's given a script 

195.45 202.13 B: [mn] he's on fire and he knows what he's doing but when he's doing stand up the only thing he knows how to do 

202.30 208.06 B: is to talk about sex and use a cuss word here and there and i mean 

208.08 211.86 B: if you've ever listened to robin williams stand up it's very vulgar 

211.45 212.53 A: right 

212.16 213.23 B: um 

213.73 220.37 B: and to me i just a- and even in interviews i just don't listen to him you know 

220.35 234.91 B: when he does stand up or interviews because i don't laugh at anything he does when i watch his movies it's a different story because you know [laughter] h- he he has he has somebody else that's you know telling him what to say and stuff um 

233.84 234.91 A: yeah 

235.45 244.77 B: [lipsmack] and there's a lot of things that i think are funny um i think physical humor is funny um like if someone trips and falls 

244.80 259.03 B: and they over embellish that they've tripped and fallen and they want the whole world to know it i think that's funny um because we've all done it we've all been there um and we've all wanted to cuss and say those four letter words that we know we're not supposed to 

247.48 248.46 A: yeah 

249.52 251.05 A: [laughter] 

253.85 254.88 A: oh yeah 

259.38 263.27 B: but it's funny when we see it happen to other people 

263.06 264.00 A: yeah 

263.28 268.31 B: [noise] um and it's not making fun of people and it's it doesn't hurt 'em because you know 

268.38 272.90 B: we've all done that so that's when it's humor that relates to the audience 

273.20 277.08 B: [lipsmack] i think that's funny but there again i said in good taste 

276.80 277.80 A: oh yeah 

277.13 277.91 B: (( um )) 

278.21 285.55 B: like h- [mn] what kinda what kinda comedies do you like i mean what- what- what's your favorite comedy of all time 

288.00 292.06 A: (( [sigh] well i you know i just really like to watch stand up )) 

292.24 294.59 A: and you know like comedy central 

294.33 295.77 B: (( [noise] [noise] oh yeah )) 

295.19 307.10 A: you know i like to watch that you know and i am more for you know i'm white also but i really tend to go more for the black comedians because they just they're just funnier 

308.17 309.47 A: you know it's 

308.54 312.09 B: [laughter] yeah i mean they they they i'm sorry 

309.65 312.87 A: it's like they've been around the block [laughter] 

312.69 314.21 B: [laughter] 

313.66 315.24 A: [laughter] 

314.27 316.06 B: i guess so um 

316.52 319.68 B: (( h- how old are you do you you mind me asking ))

320.93 321.74 A: yeah

329.57 333.08 B: that's that's a compliment to you so um [mn] 

331.57 333.28 A: [laughter] 

333.18 338.37 B: ah now you know and comedy's changed so much over the years ah [mn] 

338.90 343.74 B: i'm i'm twenty three years old and i watch t._v. land because 

343.94 356.19 B: [lipsmack] i love the i love lucy's i love leave it to beaver and um maude and happy days and stuff like that because that's when humor was wholesome and it was i mean it 

354.29 355.32 A: oh yeah 

356.25 356.83 B: (( [mn] )) 

357.21 362.49 B: today we've got and ah today we just have humor that just [noise] 

363.60 370.25 B: and the- they break some of the [mn] i mean okay for instance i'm just going to put it out there jackass 

370.36 371.60 A: yeah 

371.35 377.79 B: i mean you know i'm a writer too and i'm like gosh if i knew that i can swim in a vat of 

378.23 379.46 B: feces 

379.52 381.37 B: to make a million dollars 

381.39 396.34 B: you know i mean ah but the thing that's that's more scary is not the fact that they're making the money off of it but it's the fact that people are buying into it i mean shock humor is becoming so popular today and i really don't 

381.44 382.64 A: [laughter] 

391.16 392.18 A: i know 

394.13 395.11 A: yeah 

396.31 408.61 B: i'm not you know that doesn't turn me on it doesn't you know i don't look at that shock humor and i'm like oh gosh i really want to watch that um [lipsmack] because it's [noise] it's degrading it's stupid and it's 

409.12 413.78 B: [mn] i think it's just a waste of the industry's time [mn] um and it 

411.47 412.47 A: yeah 

413.79 421.82 B: and it cheapens the human psyche too for for them to think that we're that stupid to ah 

421.98 423.89 B: to find humor in that 

423.21 429.08 A: yeah i i do have to admit i i finally broke down and rented it 

424.17 425.56 B: so 

428.77 431.07 B: [laughter] 

429.73 431.94 A: (( because i i was just a )) 

431.50 441.75 B: did did you have your hands covered over your eyes because i still i i still haven't done it you know it took me a long time before i saw scary movie and i was like okay 

433.96 436.00 A: yes yes 

441.56 446.70 A: you know i and i thought okay some of them things in there it's like okay 

441.94 442.83 B: um 

446.70 447.90 B: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

447.24 451.55 A: peeing on a snow cone and then eating it i don't think so 

451.41 455.25 B: (( [laughter] oh yeah see tha- that's just gross to me and it sucks )) 

454.26 463.55 A: yeah and then the little alligator biting your nipple i mean okay w- what's so funny about that that just plain hurts 

460.50 461.62 B: [laughter] 

463.43 464.65 B: yeah 

463.89 467.56 A: you know it hurts just to watch it [laughter] 

468.82 470.55 B: well you know [mn] 

471.54 478.33 B: and i i think you know we- we're still young there with everything that's coming out especially the age of reality television 

478.41 479.33 A: yeah 

478.46 479.52 B: i 

480.67 495.09 B: [mn] i you know i'm really scared to see what's going to happen in television ten fifteen years from now i mean what we think is funny right now it's probably not going to be when we get to be thirty forty years old and ah and ah 

485.46 486.43 A: i know 

492.77 493.68 A: yeah 

495.23 497.49 B: they'll probably come up with um 

497.37 511.16 B: you know comedies about tomatoes and the dramatic life of a tomato or something um [laughter] you know i i don't know or the the colonary migration of gnats i i i just i just don't know i mean but 

502.53 504.34 A: [laughter] 

507.89 509.23 A: yeah 

510.96 516.01 B: i think in all honesty you know you you have to be the judge if 

515.07 516.41 A: yeah 

515.94 520.95 B: if if you're someone that likes to entertain people and make people laugh [mn] 

520.80 531.66 B: or you know ah you know how you get together with people and you want to tell a good joke i think if you have a doubt for one minute in your mind [lipsmack] that it possibly could offend someone 

531.52 540.22 B: then i think it's best unsaid and also too you have to it depends on who you're talking to if you know the people that you're talking to and you know 

540.43 544.37 B: um the relationship that you you have with that person 

544.49 552.98 B: um and it's okay for you to be a b- be vulgar with 'em or whatever i mean i'm not i'm not advocating that but i'm saying if it's 

548.16 549.12 A: right 

551.94 552.82 A: right 

553.07 561.06 B: if you have that common ground that you can pretty much it's more like a brother sister or brother brother whatever kind of relationship and ah 

559.28 560.28 A: yeah 

561.62 564.10 B: nothing's taboo then 

564.14 565.24 B: um 

565.67 568.20 B: that has to be for the the 

568.23 573.53 B: the the sender and the receiver [noise] of of the the joke 

570.80 571.82 A: right 

573.45 574.35 A: yeah 

573.66 577.45 B: um and that's ultimately i think what [noise] people have to 

577.86 583.02 B: [lipsmack] have to decide when they do that five minute stand up routine or whatever and ah 

581.96 582.95 A: yeah 

583.56 589.54 B: and ah or an- and let's take it on a bigger scale look at um the dixie chicks 

589.41 590.31 A: yeah 

589.64 596.70 B: she was in her right to say what she said but there's a time and place for everything 

595.96 596.89 A: right 

596.78 599.89 B: and she might have said it in a
