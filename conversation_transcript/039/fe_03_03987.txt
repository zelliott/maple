12.80 16.34 B: i don't know i would say maybe drawing the line at um

34.22 36.06 B: which is true um 

35.59 40.67 A: and where i [noise] personally draw the line for myself is when it makes me uncomfortable

40.69 48.32 A: that's i mean you know what i'm saying everyone's got to draw their own line i mean if something's off color i mean there's off color jokes i wouldn't tell my mother 

42.04 43.30 B: yeah 

48.23 51.26 B: [laughter] but you'd definitely tell your best friend yeah [laughter] 

48.55 52.00 A: but i would tell my friends yeah you know 

51.80 55.14 B: i think it's maybe just relating to the situation you know 

55.09 69.17 B: um like i work in a store and we [lipsmack] we always you know say that like someone's gonna fe- be offended no matter what 'cause you know we've had people oh they feel like such and such an employee was rude to them even though the person was perfectly nice and you know sometimes people just 

55.87 56.73 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

61.76 62.85 A: mhm 

66.86 68.00 A: mhm 

69.35 73.74 B: they just want a reason to to ditch you know [laughter] they just want a reason to complain 

71.78 72.73 A: this is true 

73.76 77.25 B: (( and [lipsmack] i don't know sometimes i think it's funny though when )) 

77.31 79.74 B: people make fun of themselves 

79.12 80.62 A: mhm 

80.01 89.69 B: like if you grew up in a small town and you make f- you know make like trailer park jokes or something and you're like oh that's you know where i came from maybe 

88.88 89.81 A: yeah 

89.70 94.52 B: maybe it's funnier if you relate to it and you you're not yeah like you said you're not offended yourself 

94.21 95.23 A: mhm 

95.29 106.51 A: [lipsmack] that's i uh that's where i draw my lines is if if if it's so off color that it's an un- i mean it's an uncomfortable kind of funny yeah it may be funny 

97.92 99.09 B: mhm 

100.94 102.01 B: [laughter] 

104.24 105.62 B: mhm 

106.69 107.94 A: but 

108.54 109.44 A: y- 

109.46 110.53 A: you know 

109.49 112.07 B: you don't want to say it yeah 

111.02 114.65 A: yeah it's just like um how am i trying to put it 

115.17 118.40 A: it it's funny and other people might find it humorous 

118.63 125.39 A: but it's just sort of an uncomfortable feeling that you get same like the same way like with sexual harassment 

125.20 126.34 B: mhm 

125.72 135.05 A: you know er people different people have different things that they find to be harassing some people you can't say hello to an opposite sex 

134.94 138.99 B: and they're gon- yeah they're gonna think oh he was looking at yeah 

135.76 137.65 A: and they're gonna say that's harassment 

138.20 140.79 A: and other people will go 

140.83 143.72 A: you know a hundred and eighty degrees out the other way 

144.13 146.93 A: i mean some people you can't tell a knock knock joke to 

147.00 148.71 B: [laughter] and they'll yeah or they'll 

148.73 152.81 A: and they'll say that it's bad taste now i've heard 

149.24 151.38 B: they'll freak out about it 

152.95 156.87 A: i've heard you know jokes that i have found in poor taste 

156.94 160.55 A: and that i would consider bad comedy i don't think it's 

161.88 166.70 A: i think it's in bad comedy believe it or not for comedians to get up 

166.95 168.11 A: and 

169.99 171.34 A: (( [lipsmack] to )) 

171.57 175.97 A: er go on about something that somebody doesn't have any control over 

176.30 180.67 B: [laughter] like disabilities or something like that maybe yeah 

176.78 177.55 A: um 

178.51 184.53 A: yeah i don't yeah like retarded jokes and stuff like that i don't particularly find humor but 

183.53 188.48 B: no i agree with that i think it's i think it's funny if people joke about 

189.00 190.59 B: (( um [sigh] )) 

189.92 194.23 A: situations like you said where you grew up from and where you come from 

191.31 192.76 B: yeah 

194.68 195.66 A: i don't 

194.97 198.10 B: sometimes even stereotypes if it's 

198.24 204.81 B: something that people can in general laugh at or if it's you're making fun of the fact that the stereotype is so 

205.67 209.34 B: you know badly blown up blown up in proportion or something like that 

209.04 210.01 A: mhm 

209.36 212.42 B: yeah i agree it's not it's not really fun when you make fun of someone who 

213.17 215.26 B: has no control of the situation 

215.36 219.97 A: they um there was a television show not too long ago um it's called any day now 

220.06 221.22 B: mhm 

220.52 225.48 A: it's on my uh it's on lifetime but my my husband calls it the the man hater's channel 

224.90 226.45 B: yeah [laughter] 

225.77 228.94 A: um and have you ever watched any day now 

228.95 232.14 B: (( um i don't think i actually have )) 

231.29 234.11 A: okay well it's about a white woman and a black woman 

234.19 235.06 B: okay 

234.55 241.20 A: and it's their relationship from when they were a child all the way growing up about their friendship and about how they've dealt with different issues 

241.98 246.35 A: um mostly race related but in their life time how they relate to everything 

242.26 243.58 B: that's kind of cool 

246.76 249.61 A: and one of the main characters 

249.62 253.74 A: had what she felt was a weight problem she was overweight but not that much 

254.14 261.24 A: but she'd gone to a comedy club in the thing and the comedian started making fat jokes 

261.10 262.45 B: mhm 

262.87 270.44 A: and there was a heavy set woman in the audience who really took offense at it because everybody was laughing 

270.54 272.34 A: but to her it wasn't funny 

272.06 274.36 B: yeah 'cause it was a serious problem 

272.64 273.95 A: because it was more 

274.04 274.88 A: huh 

274.53 277.57 B: because it was more of a serious problem that she probably couldn't 

274.92 275.72 A: yeah 

277.72 289.21 A: right right and i mean even if it's not a serious problem i mean if you're heavy you're heavy it's a fact of life but it made her uncomfortable so she was offended by offended by it and you could tell 

284.03 284.86 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

289.26 290.85 A: at the table 

291.11 296.84 A: emmy which is the white girl she kind of was like ha ha ha you know laughing with the comedian 

296.72 297.88 B: mhm 

297.31 300.46 A: but her friend renee didn't 

300.77 309.40 A: and later they were talking and she was like well why didn't you laugh and she says well i could clearly see that it hurt you and why would i laugh at something 

309.59 311.50 A: that i could see hurt you 

311.66 313.09 B: mhm 

312.48 315.11 A: so i guess that's sort of like where i draw 

315.49 320.37 A: where i think it's in bad taste like if you're hurting the people around you with with the jokes 

319.31 321.36 B: no it's not funny yeah 

320.44 323.23 A: then it's not funny and it's in bad taste 

323.49 324.80 B: i agree with that i you 

325.06 327.93 B: know i hate when people come in or we get um 

328.81 333.61 B: it's kind of a weird situation we get um [lipsmack] a lot of shoplifters in our store 

333.36 334.28 A: mhm 

333.67 337.08 B: and a lot of them tend to be african american woman 

336.99 337.92 A: mhm 

337.26 344.27 B: and we'll get you know like sometimes we joke about it we call them you know that they're shoplifting sisters but uh er you know it's like 

344.22 353.58 B: it's a joke between us and that we would never go up and assume that like everyone who you know is black is shoplifting or something like that and it's funny because i know that they 

350.58 351.46 A: right 

353.82 357.47 B: there's some of the girls that do shoplift make jokes about us we've heard them 

357.70 360.51 B: you know saying stuff and it's kind of funny how [lipsmack] 

360.79 361.57 B: like 

361.82 368.66 B: it kind of makes you realize like hey that's not funny [laughter] you know they're laughing saying oh they're stupid and we got out of here with all this stuff and 

364.66 365.50 A: yeah 

368.74 376.33 B: but it it does it's it's kind of funny you know to know we're crossing the line when you look at you take someone else's perspective on it and think 

375.06 376.04 A: mhm 

376.43 378.78 B: oh well maybe you know 

378.46 380.54 A: maybe that wasn't so funny 

380.16 381.64 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

380.63 383.82 A: yeah i mean i work i work for nine one one 

384.09 387.62 A: and so there's a lot of jokes that we have 

387.70 391.11 A: that a lot of other people would find in very poor humor 

390.58 391.86 B: yeah 

391.19 393.87 A: but with the job you 

394.41 399.97 A: i don't know there's there's things that we would j- i would never i couldn't ever really joke about them 

400.50 403.40 A: with somebody who's not been through it you know what i mean [noise] 

402.56 404.92 B: [laughter] i'm sure it's a very 

405.09 408.68 B: just stressful and emotionally taxing job to hear 

409.06 411.89 B: you know to take different calls and hear the things that are going on 

411.42 412.54 A: mhm 

412.68 414.39 B: and it's probably just how 

415.17 421.55 B: if you all relate to it and that's how you kind of separate from what's you know what's happening 

417.80 419.24 A: yeah 

421.28 426.56 A: right but if i were to make like a a morbid dead joke to somebody else 

426.69 429.96 A: you know somebody that wasn't there or didn't know the situation 

430.09 432.62 A: i'm sure they would find it in bad taste 

432.07 434.65 B: and you know think oh my gosh [laughter] 

433.52 437.54 A: and offensive and be like oh my what in the world is up with her 

434.67 436.02 B: yeah 

437.44 441.61 B: [laughter] it is sad that our society's so 

438.15 439.19 A: (( you know )) 

442.15 446.43 B: you know we're such a diverse society but so many people still t- take offense to everything 

446.32 447.37 A: right 

446.58 452.89 B: you know we s- we had a couple of ladies we said hi guys as they walked in the store and they threw a fit we're not guys 

453.84 456.08 B: (( and i thought when you say it you know )) 

456.23 464.26 B: guys doesn't necessarily mean that you know you're not saying hello gentleman or hello men but it's just funny that somebody would actually take offense to that 

464.26 468.34 A: yeah [noise] and i guess and that's the other thing too i mean 

468.93 469.49 A: (( er )) 

470.08 474.92 A: i mean i know i know i i don't think jokes are funny when they make me uncomfortable 

475.24 480.19 A: and i guess that's that's where i draw the line but everybody i mean 

475.28 476.51 B: yeah 

480.01 481.11 B: (( [cough] )) 

480.55 485.66 A: you could like i said knock knock jokes could make you uncomfortable and you could draw the line there 

486.05 488.59 B: i just really tr- try to feel out the 

488.93 496.69 B: you know the the people around and if somebody is uncomfortable you know i don't think it's right either to keep telling something if the people around you are 

496.72 509.28 B: obviously you know yeah and giving you the look to okay that's enough you know i think that's that's kind of something to take into consideration or it's one of those where if you don't know the people you kind of 

497.91 499.23 A: uncomfortable 

502.11 503.34 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

509.71 514.64 B: just tell jokes about the weather or something like that and you kind of stick away from 

515.25 517.55 B: i think a lot of it depends on the situation 

517.37 518.41 A: mhm 

517.71 520.28 B: you know if you know you're with your friends and 

520.86 522.09 B: you know she'll 

522.47 531.75 B: you know maybe yeah like the sh- the show you said you know there's a black lady and a white lady like maybe you know when i'm with my friend who's just as black she'll make jokes about 

531.81 532.86 B: you know 

532.95 541.57 B: the people of her own race and so then like you know you understand it it's like oh it's okay to make [noise] you know and kind of go along with it but you wouldn't do that to maybe someone you just met 

534.41 535.25 A: mhm 

541.36 542.77 A: no and 

541.69 545.07 B: and probably a lot of it is how familiar you are 

544.69 548.63 A: with somebody yeah no that that's true because 

545.77 546.99 B: yeah 

548.66 549.61 A: um 

551.22 554.09 A: well like i said like the nine one one operators 

554.18 563.77 A: we all like i said we all joke in one way and it's stuff that i would never joke to somebody else about you know you might joke and say you know if that person calls for an ambulance 

558.77 560.14 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

563.84 566.78 A: i might send them one you know thirty forty minutes later 

566.52 567.53 B: [laughter] 

567.07 569.77 A: and you're joking because 

568.71 572.03 B: it's not gonna really happen yeah [laughter] 

570.49 576.93 A: yeah you know 'cause there's no way that you know i wouldn't care if it was my worst enemy you know you'd send them 

577.04 580.78 A: but uh you know joking around you might say that to them 

577.09 578.42 B: of course 

580.91 582.71 A: but you could see how that would 

583.17 584.78 A: make other people 

585.71 589.27 A: they would think it was in bad taste to joke around like that because 

589.38 592.46 A: my gosh what if that really happened or what if 

591.95 593.22 B: yeah their 

592.82 593.80 A: you know 

593.34 599.89 B: mom passed on because the ambulance didn't get there in time or it's so hard because you just never know with some people 

595.51 596.91 A: mhm
