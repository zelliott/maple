482.35 483.57 A: [laughter] 

488.16 491.35 B: has such a lack of respect um 

490.02 496.04 A: [mn] yeah vu- what i would call vulgar humor i do not like vulgar humor at all 

492.90 493.82 B: right

503.41 505.16 B: [laughter] 

513.40 520.96 A: [lipsmack] well i don't know a little bit of that but i think you have to be very careful because people can get very upset very quickly 

514.46 515.40 B: yeah 

516.30 517.49 B: right 

519.02 523.81 B: especially when something serious has happened and all of a sudden they make 

522.05 522.92 A: yeah 

524.16 530.82 B: you know something that that's funny out of it especially i don't like my president being made fun of any of 'em

537.07 537.86 B: oh 

540.63 541.48 B: mhm 

545.13 546.56 A: ethnic jokes 

546.22 555.48 B: well i think it's probably people see it more humorous now than they ever did um yeah you know it's now there's the ah 

550.81 551.93 A: really 

553.09 554.02 A: (( mm )) 

555.02 555.85 A: (( [noise] )) 

556.18 571.14 B: it it you see so many black comedians now that are comedians that you know and and they do a lot of ethnic jokes you see a lot of ah jewish there's quite a mixture of different people and and they usually stay with their 

560.45 561.98 A: oh 

563.32 564.69 A: right

575.22 576.64 A: (( right you )) 

575.66 580.10 B: and if it's in fun it's okay but it can be sometimes very hurtful 

578.52 581.86 A: have to be careful yeah i think maybe 

581.88 585.32 A: up here too we have a lot less [mn] 

585.50 594.82 A: probably ethnic humor [mn] just in in terms of local things just because this is such a diverse area of the country really we're um 

594.29 595.56 B: everybody 

595.32 597.03 A: oh yeah we 

595.96 597.53 B: it's a melting pot
