2.51 3.47 B: hi 

3.52 8.49 A: um [lipsmack] this is my second one i didn't do very well on the first one so 

8.15 11.63 B: this is my first one [noise] i've never done it before [noise] [noise] 

9.49 10.54 A: it is 

10.98 17.86 A: well let me say what i learned from the last one and that is i think we're supposed to really kind of keep talking about the topic until 

18.10 19.37 A: it's time 

18.34 19.20 B: okay 

19.57 21.67 B: so tasteless humor [noise] 

21.39 25.06 A: well i got it um i just heard humor 

25.35 28.67 A: and what's the what's the line between 

28.72 30.53 A: (( what's tasteless and what isn't or something )) 

32.20 38.50 B: [noise] [noise] okay and so my feeling on that would be anything in regards to um 

35.27 36.25 A: mhm 

38.58 41.06 B: [noise] race sexual orientation 

41.07 42.79 B: um religion 

43.08 47.88 B: [noise] and um political beliefs anything that [noise] that is um 

44.98 45.97 A: (( uh-huh [noise] mhm mhm mhm )) 

48.22 51.73 B: against somebody's own beliefs i guess that'd be tasteless 

52.65 57.32 B: [noise] um i [noise] i work in a profession where i deal with people [noise] every day 

57.73 66.49 B: and different people and i draw a line at [noise] you know things regarding them that i might not know 

66.87 68.67 B: [noise] and um would [noise] 

67.72 70.08 A: mhm right you have to deal with that every day 

69.65 77.40 B: right so i limit my conver- -sation [noise] to maybe if i said something funny it would be in regards to me [noise] versus them [laughter] 

75.23 76.78 A: [noise] right like 

77.13 79.14 A: like self deprecating 

78.66 82.98 B: right maybe something funny i did or my children did versus um 

83.22 85.29 B: [noise] an actual topic i don't 

84.41 85.38 A: uh-huh 

85.64 87.52 B: ever tell jokes 

86.98 87.98 A: uh-huh 

88.15 89.49 B: (( 'cause i think that uh )) 

88.37 90.47 A: yeah it's kind of dangerous [laughter] 

89.75 92.14 B: yeah i think so i um [noise] 

91.06 95.83 A: well what do you think about what's in the media 

95.98 102.72 A: um in terms of humor and it's acc- and like it's accessibility to to the general public 

102.98 107.31 A: like i just happened to have the comedy channel on a little while ago and 

106.72 107.63 B: uh-huh 

107.44 111.75 A: you know that's and if you have cable you can get the comedy can- channel [laughter] 

111.19 112.25 B: right 

111.97 114.64 A: and then just in the general media 

114.62 121.50 B: [noise] um you know what television wise i i i never am offended by anything that goes on 

121.60 122.41 B: [noise] on 

121.78 122.34 A: (( mm )) 

122.55 125.47 B: like on the comedy channel or on television 

123.91 124.81 A: mhm 

125.59 138.32 B: i don't uh i don't think i've ever been offended by [noise] anything i've seen [noise] necessarily like in newsweek or anything political personally even if it is against my party or my beliefs 

133.07 134.09 A: (( uh-huh mhm mm )) 

139.14 152.11 B: if it comes from a particular person that's when it would seem offensive to me just for me [noise] um if it's a personal one on one conversation it's just mostly uncomfortable 

144.98 146.83 A: uh-huh uh-huh mhm 

152.53 153.58 A: right 

153.27 161.25 B: i um [noise] i don't you know i don't mind seeing cartoon [noise] figures of the president or 

160.53 161.47 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

161.34 162.68 B: or um 

163.44 165.03 B: you know people 

165.49 167.57 B: um in political 

167.83 173.37 B: power [noise] that doesn't bother me it's not offensive [noise] to me but but 

171.16 172.33 A: mhm okay [noise] 

173.45 174.80 B: if um 

175.25 180.94 B: somebody were to make a racist comment to me directly it would offend me i guess is how i feel 

179.46 180.76 A: right 

181.06 185.82 B: i guess if if it's if i'm if i'm reading somebody's personal [noise] opinion 

185.61 186.63 A: uh-huh 

185.89 187.91 B: through it it would bother me 

187.73 190.28 A: well like we we s- we see 

190.48 194.13 A: um uh politicians being 

194.28 196.82 A: you know made fun of all the time 

196.76 197.84 B: mhm 

197.82 202.99 A: so for you is it is it about the topic or the person or 

203.41 217.30 A: like well like how it well what it maybe the best way to ask is give me an example of something that you feel has draw- has crossed the line and is tasteless humor and tell me kind of what aspects of it did you 

217.31 221.63 A: did you consider to to be the cause of crossing that line mhm mhm [noise] 

221.33 226.28 B: somebody at my work had said something in regards to um 

226.41 229.65 B: [lipsmack] speaking of asian people as oriental 

229.87 234.40 B: and um kind of making a joke in reference to oriental 

234.51 239.58 B: and in my feeling that would be a food or a carpet not a person 

239.27 240.43 A: (( oh uh-huh )) 

239.71 247.67 B: and just uh the ignorance of that [sigh] was so uncomfortable even though it was um 

248.50 255.60 B: a joke i felt like they were saying a joke but just by using that reference to me it was just very uncomfortable 

254.63 259.46 A: uh-huh [noise] uh-huh so it was a joke rather than them just being ignorant 

255.82 256.95 B: and then they 

259.16 269.08 B: the the joke was in regards to an asian person but they didn't use the word asian they used the word oriental and there was an asian person standing there 

268.54 270.47 A: uh-huh ooh and how did they react 

270.25 275.49 B: um not very good [laughter] i mean everybody felt extremely uncomfortable 

271.79 272.84 A: yeah 

275.08 276.12 A: right 

275.79 278.90 B: and um i guess i felt like 

279.41 285.66 B: that was a a stepping over the line especially when it had to do with somebody's race 

286.17 287.41 B: and um 

287.90 297.57 B: i've also [sigh] felt like the same feeling when people have referred to women in the same ignorant fashion as joking but not 

298.15 299.58 B: but um 

300.10 307.07 B: [lipsmack] just using terms like broad or chick or something like that that that seems offensive to me 

303.23 304.57 A: (( right right mhm mhm )) 

306.06 309.80 A: mhm right yeah that's funny i i have a friend who um 

310.17 321.46 A: [lipsmack] he does refer to women that way and i had to tell him i've known him ever since kindergarten and i told him the other day flat out i said when you're in my presence don't then don't talk about women that way 

321.53 324.62 A: i mean he thought it was funny i didn't think it was funny at all 

324.36 330.61 B: [mn] no i didn't i don't either i don't i don't feel that it's funny whatsoever i 

325.08 326.00 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] mhm mhm mm )) 

330.68 337.55 B: i don't you know i work in a profession with a lot of gay and gay men and i i don't 

337.75 339.24 B: to me like 

339.28 348.83 B: television shows like will and grace i don't find it offensive as far as the jack character the characters who portra- portray gay people 

348.85 357.45 B: 'cause there's a whole range of them but it seems like my friends that are gay think that that's just just their typical way of just you know 

357.82 360.46 B: and they find that humor offensive 

359.83 363.63 A: mhm mhm mhm mhm right so it's kind of interesting to summarize um 

364.19 365.43 A: well like [sigh] 

365.91 368.86 A: well first of all i would say that i think today 

369.05 377.91 A: we have to be a lot i think people are very sensitive and that's not a judgment it's for right or wrong or indifferent and people are sensitive 

372.52 373.56 B: mhm 

377.24 378.33 B: mhm 

377.94 381.13 A: and i think we have to be very careful about 

381.78 386.83 A: the jokes that we make because if you offend somebody it's just 

387.59 389.55 A: not it's not funny [laughter] 

388.88 390.53 B: no it isn't funny 

389.96 392.41 A: yeah if you hurt somebody um [lipsmack] 

392.85 395.76 A: and um in terms of 

395.94 400.11 A: of oh i'm trying to think about it you know inner personally well 

400.11 413.10 A: depending on your audience i guess you just use your own judgment about what you know about them and then in in the media in terms of what's accessible i mean that's really part of what our country's based on and that's free speech 

403.59 404.42 B: right 

406.00 406.78 B: right 

412.84 413.67 B: (( [noise] right )) 

413.30 419.87 A: and so i mean you can't really sensor even though you might not find it funny but you can personally say 

419.95 421.04 A: um 

421.09 424.33 A: you know i'm not gonna watch that i'm not gonna 

424.50 427.24 A: subscribe to that publication or 

427.47 429.39 A: whatever you need to do 

430.25 433.69 B: so humor in regards to um 

433.73 440.33 B: just um jokes is there a certain limit that you feel is offensive or non 

439.94 443.63 A: mhm well i think we're in agreement that um 

443.91 445.19 A: if it's 

445.50 448.40 A: something like i would consider um 

449.94 451.68 A: i would consider 

452.01 460.68 A: that i would consider [noise] my audience you know whoever i'm around like to my best friend i might be able to say something because they know me 

453.88 455.40 B: (( offensive [noise] uh-huh )) 

460.68 468.26 A: and how you know that like between us it might be something that we think is funny because we know each other 

460.77 461.62 B: uh-huh 

467.95 468.90 B: uh-huh 

468.36 472.91 A: like they would know that i'm not racist but i could say something that was 

469.84 472.02 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] right [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

473.11 476.76 A: i don't know a little bit funny that might have something to do with race 

477.37 478.79 A: but um 

479.09 481.41 A: in general um 

481.66 491.25 A: i'm the same as you i don't think anything that can hurt somebody is funny but by the same token people are so sensitive today 

491.51 495.25 A: that you really don't know what's going to offend someone 

495.44 496.32 B: right 

495.96 500.48 A: so it's it's a tough call and i think the bottom line is you have to be hyper careful 

500.34 501.27 B: right 

500.80 503.86 A: not to [laughter] um even risk 

503.93 506.48 A: saying something that might be offensive to someone 

507.03 511.54 B: and it is amazing when dealing with the public every day it it's 

512.31 522.04 B: i think i just from doing it for twenty years i think i'm very cautious and i'm overwhelmed by what some people will say and get away with 

516.61 517.82 A: (( yeah i think ya )) 

521.25 523.54 A: right now see that's a good word caution 

523.88 528.18 A: yeah i think i think it's wise to be [laughter] very cautious 

523.94 524.73 B: yeah 

528.14 529.65 B: right i agree 

528.27 529.29 A: um 

529.66 536.51 A: i think that um a l- i mean look at politicians and all sorts of public figures they 

536.51 544.76 A: they have felt almost overly [noise] comfortable with their audience and later on it's come back to [noise] bite them [noise] people are [noise] very sensitive [noise] [noise] 

544.87 558.02 B: i think so too i i do think that i can you know as far as humor goes i i tend to play on myself and and what what i think is funny about something that i might have done versus 

557.49 558.81 A: (( uh-huh [noise] right )) 

558.12 563.60 B: other other people i don't like to use other people for yeah as a reference 

559.08 560.09 A: i think that's 

560.21 561.68 A: that's safe 

561.94 565.35 A: yeah now now i like i like the way you've stated it you wouldn't 

565.42 570.18 A: you wouldn't um you know use other people as the basis for your 

570.31 571.36 B: humor 

570.82 572.17 A: for your humor 

571.86 572.70 B: (( right [noise] )) 

572.37 573.59 A: i think that 

573.72 576.17 A: pretty much sums it up and i think um 

576.23 576.79 A: [noise] 

577.35 583.93 A: the things that are [sigh] tasteless i guess what crosses the line into being tasteless is that was that the question 

583.63 584.88 B: yeah i 

584.90 591.21 B: i think anything that's sexual around people i think that um anything that's 

587.15 588.61 A: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

591.43 594.76 B: racial i think anything that's um 

594.89 598.50 B: against religion or certain ethnic groups 

598.10 598.47 A: (( mhm )) 

599.43 599.95 B: (( i i ))
