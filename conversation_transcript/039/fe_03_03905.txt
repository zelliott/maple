61.17 62.39 B: i don't care for 

62.53 70.52 A: no so many do though i mean they just use it as an excuse i think [sigh] when they want to do something to someone and 

67.61 68.89 B: (( that yeah )) 

71.47 74.23 A: i don't know if they just don't want to be blamed for it or 

74.39 77.16 A: they think they can get away with it or or what it is mhm 

75.95 79.25 B: i it's getting away with it i think that they just have 

79.58 83.82 B: [mn] some anger or something or something that they want to get rid of and um 

82.22 83.20 A: mhm 

84.35 86.55 B: i guess they feel that's acceptable 

86.28 87.70 A: yeah yeah 

86.98 88.65 B: but you know i guess 

89.10 93.02 B: i guess i don't tell people when i think they've crossed that line 

93.21 95.30 A: mhm well i do 

95.32 96.84 A: [laughter] i do 

96.49 98.35 B: i wish i did 

97.44 107.69 A: if it's someone that i know well enough if it's someone that i don't know well i won't say anything but if it's someone i know then i don't mind telling them that i don't think that's funny [laughter] 

99.23 100.11 B: uh-huh 

106.97 108.60 B: [laughter] 

108.21 110.89 A: you know that's really not a joke you know 

110.69 112.30 B: yeah 

111.40 112.42 A: (( and um )) 

112.69 116.30 A: (( especially because you know i've got grandchildren that every once in a while )) 

116.41 122.72 A: (( you know i've got one that's ten and occasionally does this because that's what his friends do )) 

122.37 123.79 B: right 

123.06 126.80 A: and so i was just joking well no it's not a joke

128.52 129.31 B: (( well )) 

129.61 130.34 A: (( no )) 

131.00 135.61 A: and if they think think it's acceptable when they're with their friends then 

135.97 137.98 A: you know they have to know the difference 

137.65 142.80 B: well i think that's what they do they test it out uh with the adults in their lives to see 

141.27 142.26 A: mhm 

142.82 145.57 B: if somebody's going to say no don't do that 

143.84 144.59 A: yeah 

145.07 149.89 A: yeah and it's too bad though when you get some adults that do it and the kids think it's okay 

150.06 151.02 B: yeah 

150.48 151.48 A: (( you know )) 

151.73 153.35 B: yeah that's very true [mn] 

151.82 154.08 A: they watch it and they follow 

154.50 155.89 A: (( you know but )) 

156.68 159.36 A: no and i think there's some too that's uh 

160.35 164.23 A: the other kind had the when the guys are talking [laughter] you know 

164.43 167.43 A: (( some of those guy things are not very funny you )) 

166.25 171.58 B: oh yeah i don't like that and i don't like really you know bathroom humor 

170.95 172.52 A: (( know yeah )) 

171.90 176.08 B: and things like that and i don't like a lot of bad language in jokes 

176.12 177.15 B: (( you know )) 

176.22 179.02 A: no yeah i don't think it's necessary 

178.21 180.59 B: i guess if i couldn't tell my mother 

180.20 181.35 A: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

180.75 182.77 B: (( [laughter] )) 

181.79 182.93 A: yeah that's 

182.99 188.22 A: a that's a good way to judge it you know really i i guess i kind of tend to think that wear too 

188.64 194.85 A: there are some things you know if you can't tell your mother then maybe you had better not be doing it or saying it you know 

192.90 198.18 B: [laughter] exactly [laughter] 

195.42 196.66 A: (( but )) 

197.11 199.52 A: my mother certainly would have been a good judge on 

199.37 208.33 B: [laughter] well maybe my mother's not the best judge yeah i mean we didn't have a lot of funny things then [laughter] 

205.61 207.59 A: (( that yeah )) 

209.15 210.40 A: oh really 

210.76 211.49 A: but 

210.92 211.82 B: um 

212.01 213.77 B: so [sigh] 

213.83 215.49 B: do you find 

215.83 220.67 B: like humor that's directed at a particular group funny 

220.64 221.96 A: no 

220.95 232.91 B: even though it's i mean like i don't know if you have grandchildren you're probably about my age you remember polack jokes when we were kids now i thought those were funny and i guess they're not really directed 

227.33 229.09 A: yeah yes 

232.72 237.19 A: no not really and some of them can be funny but 

234.72 235.63 B: (( [sigh] )) 

237.28 243.06 A: ah around here we have a lot of french jokes because we're close to canada okay 

240.17 241.43 B: mhm 

242.14 243.12 B: mhm 

243.21 244.63 A: (( [laughter] and uh ))

246.85 248.78 A: [laughter] okay 

249.19 257.16 A: we we do well my husband has a friend a good friend of his that is part french and of course we hear a lot of with just that 

256.55 257.38 B: (( oh )) 

257.46 259.74 A: but it's taken he takes it well 

260.07 261.32 A: i always 

261.44 263.90 A: i i don't know i'm just not that way 

264.26 265.17 A: if 

265.20 268.61 A: you know if it's a joke in general and there's not someone 

268.77 277.77 A: that's french in the house or in the area then fine then i don't mind it but if i don't know that person and don't know if they'll be upset then 

270.22 271.25 B: mhm 

278.05 280.17 A: i'd rather not not hear it mhm 

279.20 287.56 B: yeah and like blonde jokes i don't care for those i just or anything that that kind of stereotypes i guess like men jokes you know 

281.69 283.48 A: mhm mhm 

285.97 286.81 A: mhm 

287.03 288.44 A: yeah yeah 

288.09 290.86 B: and things like that but then i 

288.73 289.55 A: (( well )) 

290.81 292.37 A: what would we have left 

291.05 296.53 B: (( was about to say that exactly what what what's left to laugh at [laughter] yeah )) 

294.74 297.47 A: yeah there's only so many animal jokes we can have 

296.93 302.79 B: [laughter] elephant jokes i guess [laughter] 

300.34 302.01 A: (( yeah yeah yeah )) 

302.11 305.82 A: but some i guess it just depends on how they're 

305.88 308.46 A: told you know and how people use them 

308.07 309.24 B: mhm 

308.86 309.79 A: you know 

309.92 313.54 A: i have a granddaughter that wants she has very long blond hair 

313.79 321.62 A: and she's eight years old and every once in a while i come out with when she's really silly i have to tell her she's being a blonde you know 

320.73 322.63 B: [laughter] 

321.64 323.87 A: but she knows i'm joking so 

323.20 324.33 B: right 

323.95 324.97 A: and 

325.14 326.47 A: you know it's it's just 

327.73 329.16 A: a funny thing 

328.74 329.88 B: mhm 

329.82 330.96 A: (( but )) 

331.41 337.60 A: you know i always make sure i tell her you know make sure she realizes it and remembers that this is a joke 

337.15 342.66 B: right well i think that's important i think it's a good thing to teach children how to laugh 

342.64 344.80 A: yes they have to know that 

343.16 347.78 B: um even a little bit at themselves you know to keep that 

345.51 347.16 A: mhm mhm 

347.56 352.07 A: right because if they can't then they don't don't know i think they'd 

352.27 353.26 A: be too 

353.20 355.26 B: they grow up too sensitive 

354.14 354.91 A: (( sensitive )) 

355.15 356.48 A: too sensitive 

356.04 357.07 B: yeah 

357.32 363.73 B: and you know a good sense of humor is really important in developing friendships and keeping friendships 

360.15 361.18 A: mhm 

362.67 365.58 A: oh yeah yeah it is 

363.84 364.81 B: you know 

365.16 366.02 B: um 

365.72 367.95 A: and they have to have that [laughter] 

367.29 369.49 B: yeah exactly 

367.99 368.97 A: mhm 

369.62 370.28 A: (( you know )) 

369.84 380.74 B: but i guess i feel i can tell jokes about my my heritage although i don't like other people do it [laughter] 

373.98 374.89 A: mhm 

375.74 380.89 A: (( yeah yeah yeah yeah that's true yeah i wonder why it doesn't offend me you know if i )) 

382.33 383.30 A: (( can say it )) 

384.30 386.74 A: yeah i never thought of it that way 

387.15 388.00 B: huh 

387.44 389.64 A: but that's true though people do 

390.02 391.20 A: do that 

390.60 395.24 B: oh yeah especially comedians you see comedians on on t._v. all the time

402.09 402.98 B: (( uh-huh [sigh] ))

408.10 410.11 A: i don't know they think it's funny 

409.92 414.24 B: well i i don't like humor that's mean spirited you know 

412.66 416.09 A: yeah yeah and so much of that is on these 

416.22 416.76 A: (( i )) 

416.89 419.44 A: don't know i don't know what they call them even 

419.04 420.31 B: well they're like
