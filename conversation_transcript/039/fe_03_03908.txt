56.39 59.57 B: [lipsmack] i just am not into t._v. no more [sigh] 

59.56 65.77 A: well i like i like to watch comedy central i won't deny that and i particularly like um 

66.02 69.01 A: [lipsmack] oh i can't even think of her name margaret cho 

69.48 71.09 A: and i like 

71.44 76.20 A: well i've always liked people like nipsy russell because that's the old time comedy 

75.55 77.03 B: yeah

108.73 110.10 A: [mn] and of course 

110.38 116.49 A: i guess if if i had to pick an all time favorite i think i would have to go with bill cosby

117.14 118.53 B: (( bill cosby )) 

119.77 121.25 B: yeah

125.67 126.90 B: mhm 

126.64 130.48 A: and he is because he's a family person i guess 

130.19 131.24 B: yeah 

130.64 137.52 A: and the some of the things he said about his mom and dad and how he was raised they'd i they'd cracked me up today

190.41 192.02 B: (( [mn] ah i'm [mn] )) 

192.90 201.71 B: like i said my husband he watches most of the comedy stuff i just can't get into t._v. i think it's about two years now 

202.13 206.41 A: [mn] oh i use i to tell you the truth i use it for company 

206.66 207.37 B: (( okay )) 

206.74 208.40 A: (( because um [lipsmack] )) 

208.48 209.51 A: i'm a widow 

209.41 210.42 B: (( ahah )) 

210.18 222.07 A: and a lot of times i'll just slip on comedy central to see who's on i like sinbad [mn] he's raunchy and he uses some some tough language sometimes but he's funny 

218.40 220.07 B: yeah i've heard him talk 

222.27 225.70 A: [mn] and as long as it's not taken to the extreme 

225.43 226.57 B: yeah 

225.97 230.56 A: and that's where richard pryor has gone you know he's gone to the extreme 

230.25 231.26 B: [laughter] 

231.11 236.43 A: [lipsmack] but i still would love to go back and listen to some of his first shows 

236.10 237.68 B: oh yeah 

237.09 242.25 A: 'cause i can remember one night we were going across the country with our kids when they were little 

242.02 242.89 B: (( mm )) 

242.86 254.71 A: and they had gone to sleep and we were laying in bed watching t._v. and he came on and i don't remember what the routine was but i literally was crying i was laughing so hard 

254.67 258.76 A: and any time i can laugh like that you know they say that's healthy 

258.26 265.33 B: [laughter] yeah but he had that ability to just bring it out you know i mean 

265.41 266.77 B: i don't know i just 

266.18 268.65 A: and dick gregory was funny too 

268.82 272.12 A: and then he got as bad as richard pryor 

273.15 275.53 B: how about carlin do you like him 

275.27 281.92 A: i do and now that he's older he comes out with some of the funniest things that i've ever heard 

276.06 276.94 B: yeah 

282.10 285.19 A: i get a people send me a lot of his um 

285.41 288.30 A: his jokes and sayings email 

287.89 288.86 B: (( yeah ahah )) 

288.56 290.31 A: and i'll sit there and laugh 

290.37 294.08 A: and i've thought if anybody could see me doing this they'd think i was crazy 

295.27 296.08 B: [laughter] 

295.40 298.70 A: but he has that dry sense of humor you know that 

298.98 299.83 B: (( [cough] )) 

299.32 303.45 A: that is um what do i wanna say indicative of our age 

303.18 304.64 B: (( definitely [lipsmack] )) 

304.69 306.72 B: yeah we've got a lot of his 

306.79 312.25 B: tapes and c._d.s and everything that we can listen to in the car 

312.56 314.79 A: i know when my mother passed away 

312.76 313.49 B: (( [mn] )) 

315.01 316.63 A: [mn] she had some um 

317.25 318.51 A: (( [mn] some )) 

318.83 321.34 A: eight tracks that's what they were 

321.03 321.97 B: (( ahah )) 

321.75 322.86 A: and 

322.88 326.71 A: some i can't remember who oh red foxx 

326.64 329.59 B: (( oh gosh [laughter] [laughter] )) 

327.64 328.59 A: [laughter] 

328.63 332.50 A: and he used to be really vulgar and then he got funny 

333.47 335.45 A: and and moms mabley 

336.34 340.96 A: and we just we were shocked to death at some of the things he said when we were kids 

340.97 342.15 A: she said 

342.53 343.19 B: mm 

342.68 353.67 A: and we used to to sneak the records out of our parents' collections and have slumber parties and listen go in a closed room in the basement and listen to moms mabley 

347.28 348.28 B: (( ahah )) 

353.26 355.17 B: oh i hear you yeah 

355.47 357.63 B: been there [laughter]

359.80 361.19 A: oh yes of 

360.36 362.34 B: oh yes [laughter] 

362.08 363.05 A: course 

362.54 363.36 B: (( [cough] )) 

363.59 364.96 B: we'd do it again 

363.64 367.00 A: we weren't supposed to know that those things existed i guess 

366.46 367.65 B: (( no )) 

367.30 372.38 A: and that's kind of the way i felt when my kids were growing up too you know you can't listen to that 

372.36 374.59 B: i know i did the same thing 

374.87 376.75 A: they mi- they don't ah 

378.09 382.23 A: at least mine don't they don't watch the funny stuff 

382.73 385.99 A: they'd rather watch the reality shows and things 

386.14 389.18 A: and i can't sit through one of those to save my soul 

389.08 392.11 B: (( really [mn] mm )) 

391.83 395.11 A: i'm i'm just not into reality t._v. 

395.33 398.49 A: i guess i'd rather live in my fantasy world [laughter] 

398.30 405.96 B: [laughter] well i have one show i watch during the day one of my soaps i've been watching for twenty seven twenty eight years now 

406.22 408.87 B: and i watch survivor when it's on 

408.72 411.45 A: which one which soap do you watch 

411.11 412.48 B: all my children 

413.73 419.89 A: [mn] i used to wa- ah my the only soap i ever really got into was another world 

419.87 421.75 B: i used to watch that one 

421.19 424.72 A: and i liked it because i liked macdonald carey so much 

423.78 424.86 B: (( ahah )) 

425.27 431.38 A: [mn] and ah looking back at the soaps when my kids were little th- that's when i watched 'em 

431.50 433.13 A: um [mn] 

433.41 436.22 A: i guess there wasn't a whole lot of humor in them 

436.71 440.52 A: [lipsmack] but i bet if i saw them today the shows that were were 

437.24 437.86 B: (( [mn] )) 

441.00 444.36 A: going on back then i'd probably laugh myself silly 

444.05 447.06 B: i know i don't even think another world is still on is it 

446.43 447.65 A: it's not 

447.23 448.81 B: i didn't think so 

448.57 450.68 A: all my children is the big one 

450.38 452.82 B: (( yeah i )) 

453.20 459.05 B: that's just been my favorite out of all of 'em when they changed times on 'em i used to watch all of 'em 

459.14 460.38 A: where do you live 

460.42 462.15 B: in florida 

462.30 464.01 A: [mn] that's a good place 

463.53 464.70 B: where are you 

464.48 466.96 A: i'm in maryland 

465.80 466.88 B: okay

473.33 475.53 A: to go and i just don't 

476.38 477.20 B: oh 

476.54 481.48 A: and sometimes i think i'm foolish for not going because like i say i love to laugh 

481.92 485.36 A: my philosophy is you know it's better to laugh than to cry 

486.87 498.12 B: [laughter] i know i get so many jokes on line and i'll sit in here i'll just be cracking up my husband's in the living room watching t._v. and he thinks i'm crazy sitting in here 

498.29 504.91 B: [mn] but i have a lot of people that send me stuff and then you know we forward it on to the next person 

503.81 505.79 A: [mn] that's right 

506.01 508.48 A: they go all the way around the world and back 

507.51 512.87 B: yeah they do i got friends in africa and [mn] i mean just 

513.23 515.33 B: australia you name it 

514.86 517.42 A: whatever happened to the good old days 

516.72 518.44 B: mhm 

518.26 520.36 A: when we wrote letters 

520.66 528.25 B: [mn] yeah i'm waiting on a friend of mine in central america to get a computer because i have to write to her still [laughter] 

527.61 528.69 A: [laughter] 

529.38 531.68 B: [laughter] it's just so time consuming 

530.80 533.42 A: you see we're getting lazy in our old age 

533.00 534.35 B: [laughter] 

534.77 536.26 B: (( yeah )) 

535.68 541.75 A: i'm lucky though my son [lipsmack] my daughter lives in england right now but my son is in baltimore 

541.42 542.42 B: (( ahah )) 

542.05 544.86 A: and he has the same sense of humor that i do 

545.20 548.28 A: and so when we find something on t._v. or 

548.38 556.34 A: something that you know was funny when he was growing up and we'll sit and laugh and people'll look at us like what's wrong with them 

556.67 557.75 B: i know 

557.53 562.01 A: and i don't i don't know when it became inappropriate to laugh 

563.01 574.76 B: i don't know we d- we do a lot of laughing around here ah it's just well me and my husband and my youngest daughter and my grandson is here right now for a few months but 

575.35 578.01 B: we're just always cutting up you know 

577.84 580.19 A: oh well of course with the little ones around 

579.78 585.15 B: yeah the baby's four and he you know he keeps me going and 

586.40 588.90 A: is that the only grandchild you have 

588.76 594.54 B: [mn] well i have a granddaughter she's three and we don't get to see her that often 

595.00 599.89 B: but with the four year old here i'm telling you [laughter] all the t-
