0.38 2.05 A: hello i'm ryan 

1.99 3.57 B: i'm brian 

3.28 4.54 A: hey brian 

4.63 7.47 A: um i missed the first part of the 

7.55 8.71 A: topic 

9.10 10.10 B: me too 

9.79 19.24 A: [laughter] i i basically know that it's about how something about how can you tell the difference between something and humor and bad taste 

19.22 23.99 B: yeah i got the second half but the first half was kind of quiet 

23.33 31.75 A: [laughter] well i guess we'll just kind of talk about i guess humor and what we think of it or whatever what do you think of 

32.20 37.14 A: do you do you think there's a lot of humor out there that's good and bad or what 

37.38 42.53 B: well yeah there's there can be two different types of humor there's ah humor where you 

42.55 48.25 B: want to make someone laugh and the humor where you're actually going too far and you hurt somebody you know what i mean 

47.21 48.09 A: sure 

48.22 49.18 A: yeah 

49.39 52.14 A: i think i think that's right i think there is 

52.66 60.26 A: you know very innocent humor where people are just yeah making you trying to make you feel good or make you laugh and then there's 

60.47 63.13 A: ah stuff that's pretty offensive to 

63.69 68.60 A: even you know a small group or maybe a lot more who knows but 

68.08 69.78 B: mhm 

69.73 70.83 A: yeah it's 

70.90 77.61 A: [mn] i don't know i i like humor but there's there's probably a lot of it that is in bad taste to me 

77.01 79.00 B: yeah 

78.21 79.26 A: so 

79.83 84.44 B: there can be o- there can be a fine line drawn where it can end and keep going 

85.27 92.35 A: yeah and and like i don't know i haven't seen a lot of the stand up comics live or anything 'cause 

92.49 95.54 A: they are kind of [laughter] some of them are pretty ah 

95.77 100.01 A: in bad taste some of them some of them are funny you know i i don't know 

97.41 98.27 B: yeah 

100.34 101.60 A: (( like ah )) 

101.68 107.52 A: um bill cosby i've i've seen a little bit and he's fairly reasonable and 

106.92 113.16 B: yeah he's he's an older type comedian these new type comedians are just trying out there to 

113.17 116.00 B: try to make anybody laugh no matter what they have to say 

115.74 118.22 A: right you know i mean 

118.75 123.76 A: i i haven't seen much of him but like eddie murphy um 

123.84 130.09 A: d- crosses the line i think a lot of the time i think he's a funny guy but he crosses the line a lot of the time 

130.64 132.41 A: so i don't know if you've 

132.42 134.21 A: seen much of him but 

133.81 138.56 B: not really i don't really watch a lot of stand comedy very much either 

137.17 147.63 A: [laughter] me me either i'm kind of stretching to tell you the truth [laughter] just stretching to make it you know the how ever many minutes we're supposed to go but 

141.34 142.18 B: yeah 

147.24 148.41 B: ten [laughter] 

148.01 149.34 A: yeah 

149.43 156.14 A: so i guess they mostly want our voices anyway they're just trying to give us a topic to talk about it's [laughter] 

157.03 158.10 A: so 

157.10 159.60 B: mm could could have been a harder topic 

159.42 173.78 A: yeah that's true i've i've o- i've done this once before and it was sports and um i could have talked for a long time about that but for some reason i got cut off [laughter] so that one ah would have been pretty easy 

166.84 168.20 B: mhm 

169.60 170.57 B: [laughter] 

174.07 175.00 A: so 

174.14 178.63 B: yeah my o- last one i did was on the minimal wage so you had it better than i did 

178.13 179.36 A: on what 

179.05 180.55 B: (( minimum wage )) 

180.06 181.20 A: oh really 

181.37 194.63 A: wow so i i would assume they're trying to get stuff that a lot of people can talk about but you know there's only so much you can say about stand up comedy or you know like i guess if we disagreed you know but 

191.21 192.49 B: yeah 

194.85 196.75 A: it's i don't know 

196.93 197.91 A: so

389.45 395.37 A: and and he fishes you know up in alaska he would fish because it was light all day 

395.41 403.04 A: from oh gee around eight or ten in the morning till two in the morning [laughter] so it was pretty much you know 

403.05 410.30 A: sixteen eighteen hours a day and that would have been pretty intense for me but i'm sure i would have enjoyed the scenery

413.90 414.89 A: oh really 

414.84 419.42 B: yeah that pretty much the same thing that you just talked about you just go to hike

450.79 451.74 A: um 

451.89 464.89 A: walked around and it was we were looking for elk and different wildlife and it was it was really neat but it rained the whole time [laughter] so it was ah as fun as it could have been if if it wouldn't have rained 

464.44 470.57 B: mhm yeah we don't got them big game we just got pretty much deer and small birds 

465.64 466.59 A: so

484.61 485.49 A: (( but )) 

485.80 490.71 A: i like it if there's deer but there seems to be quite a few elk here in utah but
