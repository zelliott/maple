15.11 24.47 B: yeah yeah bare with me because [cough] i've got a sinus infection i've been really uh sick this week and my voice is kind of messed up and i might cough so 

21.54 22.69 A: oh okay 

24.19 25.40 A: oh no problem 

24.78 30.50 B: yeah um [lipsmack] that's an interesting topic we're supposed to draw a line between the humor 

30.44 31.92 A: yes [laughter] 

31.11 34.58 B: and what what's acceptable and not acceptable 

33.68 36.90 A: right i don't know there's kind of like a fine line 

37.18 39.04 B: yeah 

37.23 46.86 A: when you er because i mean uh uh some people think some you know stuff is funny and other people don't think it's funny and i don't know it's like you kind of like got to have to stay in the middle 

46.56 50.35 B: [noise] right that's a good point yeah kind of 

49.40 58.26 A: and uh 'cause i know you know i laugh at a lot of stuff and even stuff i shouldn't be laughing at you know 'cause it it might be offensive to some people but um 

56.34 57.30 B: uh-huh 

58.33 65.58 A: i mean it's like hard to draw the line it's like eh sometimes whatever you say you're gonna step on somebody's toes somebody's gonna be mad about it 

60.61 62.31 B: (( [noise] [noise] that's right )) 

64.85 66.09 B: that's right 

65.86 75.74 A: and then you know sometimes people when they do comedy it's like you know their real life experience and all that so y- [sigh] i mean i don't know that's kind of hard 

70.64 72.29 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

75.09 78.36 B: [noise] it is kind of hard i think i think there is um 

78.49 90.76 B: [cough] there's something i feel real strongly about though about humor [mn] and i had a problem the last well two weeks ago with um a person that's been a friend of mine [mn] and um 

89.03 90.25 A: mhm 

90.74 93.66 B: sometimes you know people can tease people 

93.22 95.09 A: yeah mhm 

93.78 98.17 B: and they're teasing but when they're teasing they're really 

98.80 103.45 B: tea- er they're really doing something that has to do with their own s- insecurities 

102.85 104.41 A: right uh-huh 

103.34 115.70 B: and they use humor to do that and that to me is not acceptable at all yeah and since that just happened to me it's kind of fresh in my mind 

105.70 106.74 A: right 

108.85 110.96 A: oh no not for me either mhm 

111.03 112.18 A: that's true 

115.04 116.52 A: right 

115.88 118.94 B: yeah and but but i've seen that 

116.65 117.84 A: (( 'cause it )) 

118.99 126.21 B: i've seen that happen before and it's happened to me before and i've lost a friendship or two over it because i won't accept that 

123.87 127.30 A: really that didn't i don't blame you 

126.79 129.47 B: mhm yeah i won't accept people 

129.49 130.57 B: um 

130.91 135.14 B: you know a- and usually it's people who are insecure that do it 

134.51 140.08 A: right uh-huh yeah they're like trying to find somebody else to you know to pick on that'll you know build theirself up 

135.55 136.81 B: which is what i fi- 

139.82 149.11 B: right yeah that's right you know they build themselves up and then they use humor and then they say oh i'm just teasing you oh i'm just razzing you 

140.47 142.18 A: mhm 

143.60 144.49 A: right 

146.48 147.66 A: (( uh-huh )) 

149.08 150.15 A: [laughter] 

149.51 153.14 B: and that so that's a part of humor that i don't find 

153.56 156.88 B: acceptable or um sometimes 

156.94 158.02 B: people 

158.12 164.55 B: use it i mean i think there are people that u- that that use humor and then use it because they are 

164.63 165.94 B: insecure 

165.51 167.01 A: right mhm 

166.24 168.86 B: and they use it in their lives but 

167.97 177.39 A: yeah that's true you know you know to make fun with you know other people you know or to dog other people you know so they can get a good laugh you know a lot of people do that 

169.76 171.14 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

176.67 181.95 B: oh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah and it r- like you say 

177.48 178.67 A: mhm 

182.32 190.18 B: [cough] i think it raises er somewhere another in their i- in within their insecurities it raises them s- them up 

189.41 191.56 A: right mhm 

190.56 193.09 B: and then it de-elevates er 

193.41 197.67 B: you their target and then it elevates them and uh 

194.31 196.05 A: right uh-huh 

196.66 197.70 A: right 

197.71 201.46 B: that's really kind of a sore spot with me this past couple of weeks 

201.20 213.02 A: [laughter] yeah i don't blame you 'cause it i mean y- it's like you know everybody can take so much you know in good fun and stuff and then it comes to a point where you know it's not being funny you know and then you're like hurting people's feelings and stuff 

201.53 202.66 B: (( [laughter] but then )) 

208.37 209.63 B: (( right [noise] )) 

212.35 221.46 B: oh yeah yeah and it's like er um it's almost like you know they're teas- er they're using teasing to accomplish something 

213.44 214.17 A: mhm 

221.03 222.70 A: mhm they're just like bullies 

222.66 229.41 B: yeah it's kind of like a bully thing yeah that's right it is it's kind of a bully thing except they're using t- humor 

223.15 226.28 A: mhm [laughter] mhm 

229.11 230.01 A: right 

229.47 235.29 B: as the outlet and thinking that they can um i suppose they get by with doing that 

234.56 236.51 A: mhm exactly 

235.81 238.97 B: i wonder sometimes too if people [noise] are aware 

239.55 241.04 A: (( [mn] hm i never )) 

239.99 244.39 B: aware of it but whether they're aware of it or not it's unacceptable to me 

243.51 245.23 A: right yeah that's true 

245.14 246.26 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

245.35 256.22 A: because you know in the long run and you know you can hurt you know somebody's feelings and stuff and you know and sometimes you know people now are like on the same level that you're at you know what you're playing or teasing and stuff so they can have 

249.66 250.81 B: mhm 

255.31 257.75 B: oh yeah yeah 

257.07 258.95 A: it's like well you got to be kind of 

259.45 265.89 A: i don't know you got to like really know the person know they uh you know accept so you know you won't you know hurt their feelings or anything 

263.77 264.73 B: (( mhm )) 

265.53 267.90 B: mhm and i think it comes down 

266.07 267.21 A: you know you might want 

268.40 273.67 B: [cough] like in the situation that i had uh it came out over a period of time 

273.23 274.58 A: mhm 

274.49 280.51 B: [noise] and it was like um [noise] you know that they're using humor to um 

281.23 286.94 B: uh using humor to get even to get information from me that was really not any of their business 

286.09 288.34 A: business right mhm 

287.33 290.95 B: you know oh well i'm just razzing you oh i'm just aggravating you 

290.90 292.63 A: well stop [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] 

291.98 300.10 B: yeah yeah that's what i finally did and and i've ended a friendship because of it which is kind of sad but 

296.77 298.30 A: oh man 

299.84 300.81 A: (( er right )) 

300.13 303.94 B: [cough] um but i have a lot of friends so i'm not going to worry about it but um 

303.39 304.31 A: right 

303.96 311.37 B: but it was a r- a week ago i was pretty upset about it [mn] you know compared to now but um yeah but um 

307.54 309.06 A: yeah i don't blame you 

311.57 313.92 B: yeah but i'd say that would be definitely 

313.97 319.59 B: [noise] when people do that that's not acceptable also i don't like a lot of dirty humor like 

319.03 320.51 A: oh yeah [laughter] 

319.96 324.61 B: i don't go to comedy clubs but you know the kind of stuff that they do at comedy clubs 

320.80 321.40 A: (( [laughter] )) 

323.67 329.41 A: yeah that's what i was just about to say about you know the comedians and stuff and they they just get everybody 

326.66 328.29 B: yeah 

329.29 330.18 B: uh-huh 

329.64 335.21 A: you know with their broad humor and you know there's a lot it's like dirty or you know who's gonna offend somebody 

331.53 333.21 B: oh yeah 

334.82 347.30 B: oh yeah absolutely yeah some of it would offend me i think if i went i've i think i've only been once and it's probably been twenty years ago but yeah it didn't it was something i didn't like uh 

339.59 341.33 A: (( m- mhm )) 

346.40 347.42 A: right 

347.46 350.91 B: and even seeing it on t._v. i've seen them on t._v. too 

351.01 352.12 A: really 

351.09 351.88 B: i 

351.89 354.92 B: yeah you know on some of the stations where they 

354.84 356.34 A: yeah mhm 

355.37 360.91 B: you know where they have a come- a stand up comedian yeah i don't care for that the stuff that they 

357.51 358.90 A: (( comedian uh-huh )) 

361.13 369.71 A: and they just talk about a broad range of stuff they're gonna hit everything from the you know from the races uh you know mm you know just everything 

364.51 366.08 B: oh yeah 

367.35 368.52 B: right

376.04 378.71 B: oh all kind- yeah all kinds of stuff 

378.17 385.38 A: and then when you think about it it's like it's kind of hard like what can you talk about that you won't offend somebody but as long as you keep it in good taste 

385.22 393.17 B: yeah that's right yeah i guess i'd be more for me it'd be more acceptable to do maybe family kind of comedian stuff 

392.60 394.37 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

393.47 399.28 B: you know you know more like more like s- little uh i love the cartoons the family circus
