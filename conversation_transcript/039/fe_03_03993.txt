0.06 1.21 A: hi this 

0.09 1.26 B: (( hello )) 

1.38 2.88 A: hi this is julie 

2.51 4.03 B: hi this is nancy 

3.81 5.01 A: hi nancy 

4.68 13.16 B: i i think on our topic it would really depend on the situation but i i would think probably not but 

13.22 17.70 B: i i guess it would really depend on [laughter] what the situation was 

17.96 20.62 A: i think that i definitely would 

20.97 34.45 A: um almost in any situation i think that if i had to choose a loyalty for a close family member or a friend or a loyalty towards society my loyalty towards my loved one would be stronger 

34.80 38.65 B: probably but i i just would want more details on this 

37.97 39.72 A: yeah i guess i mean 

39.94 52.73 A: in the case of [sigh] um [laughter] you know something that i definitely felt a i yeah again with the detail if i felt strongly about whatever it was that they had done wrong 

52.35 55.18 B: i mean if we're talking about speeding i could care 

55.10 56.42 A: right 

55.68 62.97 B: you know murder or something truly bad you know then i'd have an actual problem but 

62.34 66.93 A: and possibly again you'd have to know the circumstances surrounding that murder too 

66.34 67.94 B: yes exactly 

67.32 70.37 A: i mean obviously if it was you know 

70.10 72.50 B: self defence yeah you'd defend your family 

72.24 78.37 A: or your sister's been battered for years by her husband and she snapped 

76.91 79.56 B: yeah he nee- yeah exactly 

80.06 84.07 A: so i mean i guess then again it depends on the situation but 

84.10 89.48 A: um i think that i'd dem- definitely lean toward yeah i would perjure 

89.73 90.98 A: myself 

91.31 97.05 A: [lipsmack] for a family member especially i i mean my initial response was no absolutely not 

97.15 104.10 A: but then as i thought about it like i mean i i consider marriage sacred and i consider myself and my husband as one 

104.24 105.10 B: right 

104.68 110.32 A: and i would do it for myself so of course for him almost in no mater what the circumstances were 

110.29 114.30 B: well and part of my problem is is that i can't lie worth a damn 

113.94 116.39 A: (( [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

115.55 117.19 B: well and and that i mean 

117.35 126.97 B: i always laugh because we always played poker in my family when i was a kid growing up which is why i never play it with anybody else because i learned that that was a fast way to lose money 

126.34 129.66 A: (( [laughter] )) 

128.62 134.16 B: and i'm one of those people that if a thought passes through my head you can read it straight off my face 

133.53 135.61 A: [laughter] 

134.79 136.65 B: it's unfortunate but 

136.67 138.81 B: it's it's a fact that i know 

136.82 143.09 A: no it's probably actually a good character trait a- i'm definitely the opposite 

142.81 146.52 B: you know or or else it just means i have no self control over the 

146.48 147.95 A: [laughter] 

147.07 149.13 B: -er my face but you know 

149.22 154.74 A: and i can easily tell somebody what they want to hear and make them believe me whether it's true or not 

154.36 155.25 B: yeah 

154.98 155.92 A: so 

156.56 158.19 A: and i mean again 

158.27 160.49 A: i guess if the perjury is 

161.53 165.72 A: you know in a court of law or are we talking about you know [mn] 

166.04 168.11 B: a civil case or 

166.98 169.45 A: yeah exactly 

169.29 172.67 B: you know but i just i just think that 

174.05 177.28 B: [sigh] sometimes lying is better than telling the truth and 

176.90 178.04 A: [laughter] 

177.45 182.76 B: sometimes it isn't it just depends on what purpose the truth is going to serve 

182.32 190.08 A: well i think society must expect spouses to lie for one another which is why they don't make you testify 

189.70 190.90 B: exactly 

190.60 193.41 A: (( because they know [laughter] that you're likely to )) 

193.68 198.21 A: you know have that loyalty or that bond that is going to override 

197.85 199.04 B: yeah 

198.55 200.57 A: maybe the right thing to do 

201.14 210.67 A: and and i'm not so altruistic that i honestly believe that people do respond in the right way just for the sake of doing the right thing [noise] 

210.71 215.54 B: well unfortunately we are we are not such a honorable 

215.81 219.30 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

217.93 220.75 B: people anyone anymore i think 

221.33 223.68 B: (( i think we're a little more real that that )) 

224.11 235.93 A: well and society has forced [noise] us to be because in the past where we historically lived around family members that taught us the right thing and um [noise] you know in 

236.32 239.00 A: [noise] macro societies if you will 

239.39 242.03 A: and that has basically dissipated 

241.64 242.34 B: yeah 

242.21 250.02 A: over the course of human kind or at least in our society so that we're living with strangers where that loyalty doesn't exist 

249.66 251.00 B: (( yes yes exactly )) 

250.49 251.41 A: i mean 

251.61 256.42 A: in the past you probably would have felt that loyalty [noise] for that society because it would have been 

257.26 258.29 A: you know 

258.56 261.10 A: an an extended family so to speak 

260.74 261.95 B: (( yeah [mn] and )) 

261.93 265.18 A: whereas now we don't know our neighbors we wave 

265.25 268.91 A: but don't cross the threshold into their house very often 

269.49 270.98 A: and 

271.12 272.39 A: so of course you're 

271.88 272.91 B: can't trust 

273.23 274.12 A: right 

276.32 277.15 A: so 

277.16 281.11 A: the last time i did this the topic was significantly easier 

280.79 282.27 B: [laughter] 

281.63 283.01 A: [laughter] 

283.29 287.26 A: which made it easier to talk for ten minutes have you done this before 

286.67 291.05 B: oh i did one with a guy [mn] apparently had no conversational skills 

290.86 291.93 A: oh no 

291.40 294.43 B: it was pulling teeth to get a response from him 

294.00 295.72 A: [laughter] 

295.61 299.93 B: it was the first but i couldn't figure out why he was participating 

299.33 301.68 A: he wanted the ten dollars 

300.85 302.20 B: i i 

302.21 305.90 B: apparently but he didn't understand that he had to actually respond 

305.30 308.28 A: [laughter] that would have been awful 

308.00 309.19 B: (( it was )) 

309.37 310.91 A: [laughter] 

309.89 316.53 B: he was he was difficult and i'm a chatty kathy i mean i can talk to anybody about anything and this was this was a tough bell man 

316.35 320.62 A: well you probably had to be because it sounds like you had to carry the whole conversation 

320.26 322.02 B: yeah that was pretty much the deal 

321.84 323.50 A: [laughter] 

323.07 326.06 B: that was that was pretty much the deal 

326.00 330.57 A: and and that's bad enough in any situation but particularly in this where 

331.06 333.98 A: you're supposed to carry out [laughter] a conversation 

332.85 333.69 B: (( [laughter] yeah yeah )) 

334.64 339.13 A: i mean it's bad enough if you're stuck in the car with somebody or something but 

339.19 340.94 B: oh true true 

340.59 341.81 A: [laughter] 

341.87 343.89 A: so what part of the country are you in 

343.72 345.46 B: [sigh] um dallas 

345.42 346.48 A: oh wow 

345.73 346.65 B: (( texas )) 

347.08 348.44 A: so is it hot there 

348.38 349.15 B: (( ooh )) 

349.52 352.29 B: yes and it's very humid today it's it's 

352.04 355.23 A: yeah we're in central florida it's pretty hot here too 

354.90 362.65 B: and we've i don't know if you all have been having this problem or not but we've been having problems with the smoke from the agricultural fires in mexico and central mexico 

362.06 368.69 A: oh no we haven't had that we've had wild fires in the past where for the whole summer it's smells like a campfire 

368.21 369.48 B: yeah 

368.85 372.59 A: but so far this year we've been blessed and not had to face that 

372.39 378.37 B: oh no it's it's been pretty bad they're projecting this is going to be a bad summer for us already 

372.91 373.78 A: but 

377.92 379.26 A: oh no really 

378.74 382.16 B: yeah we had a bad summer in ninety eight where it was um 

382.44 387.82 B: it was awful oh god it was so awful and they're projecting it to be just as bad this year 

387.57 391.35 A: oh that's terrible and then do you have water restrictions and things too 

390.73 395.07 B: yes sometimes we do and it always amazes me the people who have no clue 

395.28 398.56 B: that watering at three o'clock in the afternoon is stupid 

398.19 400.15 A: [laughter] 

399.55 400.32 B: (( hello )) 

401.01 403.61 B: you know eight o'clock nine o'clock 

403.79 405.23 A: well um 

404.84 409.53 B: or you know four o'clock in the morning you water for ten minutes or twenty minutes 

408.96 417.26 A: right when when we have water restrictions imposed they will fine people just based on a neighbors say so 

417.18 418.87 B: ooh my goodness 

417.67 419.87 A: which is kinda scary 

419.65 420.84 B: oh yeah 

420.22 428.50 A: i mean if somebody had a vendetta against you they just call up and say oh yeah i saw her watering on an even day and her house number's odd 

428.06 429.45 B: [laughter] 

428.72 429.95 A: (( you know [laughter] )) 

430.08 433.43 A: and boom you're slapped with a fine just on that say so 

433.36 434.60 B: oh my goodness 

434.55 436.16 A: it's kind of um 

436.68 438.44 A: gestapoish huh

439.13 440.12 A: [laughter] 

440.10 444.41 B: well it doesn't usually get quite that bad in dallas if 

445.11 450.22 B: (( you were in austin i could see that happening austin is like a breeding ground for eco terrorism )) 

450.01 451.07 A: oh really 

450.70 455.15 B: oh well it i i have for instance some relatives in austin who 

455.30 460.02 B: have a lovely piece of property that they can't build on because there's some endangered bird 

459.92 461.68 A: [laughter] 

460.40 463.41 B: that nests there four months out of the year 

463.43 464.75 A: that's funny 

464.27 470.01 B: they didn't find out about this until they'd owned the property for a couple of months and they have been able to even sell it 

469.87 471.45 A: because of the bird 

470.82 474.59 B: yeah and that's fifteen years now they've been stuck with this piece of property 

473.99 476.97 A: is it a species of bird or one particular bird 

477.71 480.00 B: [sigh] i don't remember 

480.38 483.34 A: because i'm not above [laughter] 

482.48 489.40 B: yeah well see the problem there is they you know now that they know the bird's there if it suddenly disappears 

489.66 494.52 A: well i he must have eaten something bad i'm not really sure what happened to him 

490.18 491.54 B: these people would

517.45 518.45 A: [laughter]

588.69 590.99 B: how long does the reimbursing take 

591.22 599.89 A: it just depends like i did a restaurant shop um [lipsmack] probably two weeks ago and um they paid 

597.26 598.17 B: (( uh-huh ))
