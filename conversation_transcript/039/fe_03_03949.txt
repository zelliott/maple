5.32 7.41 B: i'm doing pretty good how are you 

6.94 17.65 A: i'm all right just had a long day today so ah let's get into this ah what do you feel of what's acceptable comedy i mean you know and unacceptable 

12.31 13.28 B: okay 

18.30 27.23 B: well um have you ever heard of blue humor um i i do not feel that blue humor is very acceptable um because 

27.52 33.11 B: ah i i think a lot of times if you use vulgarity and um 

33.30 42.46 B: colorful words or obscene words to to dress what is supposed to funny um i don't think you have much material at all 

35.47 36.38 A: (( mm )) 

42.38 43.28 A: (( mm )) 

42.49 47.11 B: um and so that kind of humor doesn't appeal to me at all [laughter] 

45.78 50.14 A: ah well i never heard of it as blue humor i just probably heard of it as 

50.13 56.72 A: being raunchy or bad taste but i mean i guess it's to each his own and how they feel about it you know i'm 

52.23 53.21 B: yeah 

56.59 70.69 A: to me it's like one of those things of depending how a female feels during the time of the month something could be politically correct some things can't be you know it just depends on how the person's temperament and mood and their upbringing 

61.82 63.10 B: [laughter] 

67.25 68.43 B: right 

70.61 82.20 A: me um you know i'm in you know i- i'm pretty laid back i have a pretty conservative family life you know we're we're cool with [mn] you know we make waves but nothing out of the ordinary but it's i mean you know 

80.26 81.55 B: right 

82.04 92.54 A: you hear you i mean you hear the good with the bad it depends if h- how you can roll with the punches if you ca- a- and they say if y- they have a saying if you can't you know if you can't take the heat get out of the kitchen 

86.96 88.21 B: right 

92.45 102.59 A: so i'm feeling you know it just depends on the person you know ah how how sensitive they are because there's a lot of people that are very sensitive in this world and i'm feeling that maybe 

92.55 93.54 B: right 

102.56 109.09 A: th- what you call blue humor blue humor or you know something that's a bit raunchy or a bit you know risque 

106.06 106.75 B: (( yeah )) 

109.04 120.67 A: eh may not be somebody's cup of tea so ah just depends on a person's personality and what they feel they can take [mn] depending on their sensitivity level i think if somebody who's super sensitive 

111.57 113.50 B: (( right exactly )) 

119.08 120.56 B: right 

120.57 122.82 A: or just you know 

121.02 122.18 B: right 

122.71 137.25 A: you know is a wuss or whatever you know you want to call it you know i think that that's you know how they perceive you know you know how stuff is happening and they're you know laughing they mig- what you may think is funny or a little bit raunchy or what you call blue 

125.31 126.86 B: right 

129.01 130.16 B: right 

137.10 146.24 A: may you know may b- maybe have somebody's stick up their butt so i just it it it just depends on the person's personality and how they take it how about yourself 

140.74 142.99 B: right right absolutely 

144.34 157.94 B: yeah ah an- and i i do agree with that just um to some extent [mn] h- however i do feel that like um jokes that are demeaning and degrade ah the human psyche or um 

156.38 157.27 A: (( mm )) 

158.85 169.37 B: [mn] you know i think that that it is true that you can find a lot of humor in real situations and real life and stuff but i th- i i think when 

165.69 166.64 A: yeah 

166.73 167.75 A: oh yeah 

169.37 182.14 B: um we all know what it's like to be made fun of or whatever um and i i don't i don't think that um that type of humor's appropriate as well if if it's something that's going to um 

172.69 173.53 A: (( yes )) 

182.50 193.92 B: [lipsmack] have a catalyst result and and make people feel bad and because people do have people do have emotional tracks and sometimes um [laughter] 

184.28 185.20 A: yeah 

185.94 186.97 A: mhm 

191.03 192.52 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

194.17 195.67 B: sometimes you know 

196.05 203.10 B: something that comes out funny like if a standup comic says something um they have to be careful of 

198.45 199.54 A: mhm 

200.53 201.73 A: mhm 

203.22 212.94 B: the kind of jokes that they do say because especially in the in the age of lawsuits and everything that we have now that they just have to be careful that [noise] 

209.85 210.95 A: mhm 

213.79 216.52 B: that they don't push the envelope in in case they 

215.53 221.60 A: well a lot of people l- like to do a lot of shocking things because they want to get a rise out of somebody 

219.38 224.45 B: exactly well right jackass is a perfect example of that 

223.61 227.03 A: oh yeah exactly i mean they they use a lot of things that are 

224.66 226.73 B: [laughter] 

226.81 231.28 A: that are you know somebody normally won't do and somebody who is just not sane in the mind 

229.26 230.14 B: right 

231.06 245.81 A: you know sa- you know who's who's sane in the mind won't do but somebody who is not so doesn't have everything all up together upstairs would do things and would do something to get a rise to raise your eyebrows i believe that's happened like you know things in poor taste 

243.75 245.26 B: yeah 

245.63 249.84 A: something of the person's skin color ah their weight 

249.02 253.12 B: well well i would yeah right 

249.75 261.65 A: or you know or something of of a of a of of of them being challenged physically or something or you know their mental capacity that's always in poor taste that's always drawn the line right there but if something 

256.67 257.87 B: right 

261.09 262.42 B: right 

261.49 270.60 A: you know something else i mean you know there's political there's you know sexual there's they have a whole bunch of things it's just how you take it and how you perceive it and and how you digest it 

263.26 264.32 B: yeah 

267.88 269.25 B: right 

270.46 284.25 A: if as i said if somebody has a stick up their butt or not exactly so [mn] you know pri- you know prim and proper you know can like take it or casual you know i can take it both ways but it just depends for me it's like this 

275.66 277.22 B: right 

284.19 288.64 A: it depends it's just like a female it depends on the time of the month and what mood you're in 

287.67 291.64 B: yeah exactly and you know as an actor [mn] 

291.85 305.95 B: um i wonder that some of the things that are funniest are farts and falls um [laughter] when when you know i mean it's not funny to the person it's happening to but like when someone trips [mn] over something or stubs their toe toe 

295.75 296.98 A: oh yeah 

302.47 303.63 A: mhm 

305.15 306.34 A: oh yeah 

305.77 310.29 B: um a- a- the some of the things like that are so funny um 

310.36 320.60 B: the kind of humor that i do like that i think is acceptable and and um is like monty python and the holy grail um i love like british humor and stuff because 

317.33 318.64 A: oh yeah 

319.86 328.19 A: yeah british humo- british humor is funny you have to kind of have a different kind of mindset for it because it's kind of you have to kind of 

325.41 329.56 B: exactly because it's more of a complex humor yeah 

328.66 337.07 A: it's a little bit on the int- eh i think it's a little bit more on the intellectual side something more that more ah what you call it yuppie humor or something like that or something 

334.08 335.20 B: right 

336.03 340.42 B: exactly it is um it's humor that makes you have to think and ah 

339.59 341.95 A: (( exactly and i- it's nothi- )) 

340.55 346.77 B: um and once you get the punch line it's just like ho- so hilarious that you just have to keep watching it you know 

345.63 348.47 A: exactly exactly 

346.64 360.50 B: um because you don't know what they're gonna do next and i like the kind of humor that does keep you on the edge of the seat in the sense that like um you're waiting for that punch line and sometimes you know they can tell like a ten minute joke or whatever 

348.92 349.79 A: (( [noise] )) 

351.53 352.75 A: (( [noise] )) 

356.26 357.78 A: exactly 

359.99 361.11 A: mhm 

360.39 367.70 B: and um you still don't get to the punch line i also like um running gags um 

366.69 367.72 A: (( hm )) 

368.01 369.52 B: you know ah 

369.36 373.54 B: where they have a punch line it's hidden in there somewhere 

373.22 374.02 A: hm 

373.35 386.07 B: but [laughter] you know i- it takes like [mn] several [noise] segments before you get to the end of the punch line and sometimes those are really funny because it takes you like kind of on a comedic journey if you will um [mn] 

379.52 381.09 A: exactly 

384.73 385.78 A: (( ah )) 

386.01 394.93 B: so i i don't know like [mn] y- you know and i'm f- for me um as an as an actor looking at it from that perspective 

395.11 400.76 B: i have more of a i mean i'm more of the funny than of the drag and i 

400.12 401.61 A: mhm 

401.01 406.25 B: one of the things ah that as a person who tries to make people laugh is 

406.18 419.74 B: you don't talk about people's mommas [laughter] and [laughter] and ah you know and that's just like the biggest thing you don't talk about people's mommas and sisters and then like everything else is pretty much tab- you know like 

408.29 409.49 A: oh no 

416.02 417.18 A: oh yeah 

418.60 419.86 A: yeah 

419.78 421.61 B: well it's free game 

419.92 424.56 A: and as i said a person a person's humor and what's tasteful and what's not people 

424.39 426.16 A: just want to get a um 

425.98 440.62 A: you know what you want to do shock or they want to see what kind of reaction you get and sometimes a shock is good but sometimes if it's in such poor taste that the humor's gone o- out of it the flavor has gone you don't you don't ha- you don't know feel nothing for it it's just it's not there but you know 

428.58 429.58 B: right 

433.90 434.96 B: right 

437.05 438.05 B: right 

438.35 439.51 B: right 

440.07 446.31 B: [mn] and also something else that's really funny too and sometimes is acceptable is it um 

442.79 443.59 A: (( mm )) 

446.66 461.43 B: like humor that um is overly stupid like if in a in a like in a situation that you know that like i mean is so unrealistic that it couldn't possibly happen in a million years you know 

449.94 451.85 A: [laughter] 

453.59 454.58 A: yeah 

457.08 458.24 A: yeah 

460.41 461.05 A: (( [laughter] )) 

461.27 467.16 B: but i mean it's just over exaggerated and over i mean exemplified and i mean 

467.26 479.21 B: it's stupid when you look at it but it's just so funny like i was watching a commercial for dairy queen and they turned the two blintzes over and you've probably seen it where they're like da da da da da da whoo whoo 

473.31 474.28 A: mm 

479.61 480.24 A: (( [laughter] )) 

479.64 481.26 B: and i mean it's just like 

481.56 485.28 B: i mean it's so stupid but it's just like ah 

481.73 482.45 A: ah 

484.29 489.35 A: it's funny it's you have to be in that certain mood you have to be either demented or childish or something 

488.66 490.02 B: (( yes [laughter] )) 

489.16 499.73 A: but it's funny because i know something so silly and so benign could be very humorous and i mean that's funny because it doesn't hurt anybody it's i- it's stupid it's funny 

496.68 498.30 B: (( [noise] right )) 

499.53 514.44 A: and you know it's a you get a good laugh out of it you know even though it's ridiculous those are the kind of humors that are funny an- and there's some that are just so stupid or in so bad taste they're just like okay [laughter] what did they do that for you know so 

503.03 504.47 B: right 

511.77 512.78 B: yeah 

513.84 527.34 B: well you know bill maher and i i think he's a very intelligent um sarcastic um comedian and he's kind of like on the lines of dennis moore a lot and he got into a lot of trouble because of something he said um 

520.63 521.67 A: mhm 

527.29 534.59 B: it was either about september eleventh or terrorism or whatever but he made a joke and it was just inappropriate and the networks 

530.08 531.00 A: (( mm )) 

532.42 537.30 A: mm maybe that's why they pulled maybe that's why they pulled him off and have jimmy kimble now 

534.63 536.61 B: yeah 

537.08 544.49 B: exactly i mean you know the network was like you can't do that and you know needless to say he's looking for a part right now 

542.54 545.75 A: well that's why the show was called politically incorrect 

545.36 547.04 B: (( right [noise] )) 

546.14 548.42 A: i mean it's not because he was saying 

548.19 561.89 A: satires and jokes that weren't in good taste not everybody's ears is going to be liking this the neilson family is not going to digest it well this is why that had it after hours after twelve o'clock midnight 

554.84 556.86 B: i know exactly 

560.20 561.43 B: right 

561.57 562.78 B: right 

561.71 572.11 A: due to the fact that some things he w- he was on comedy central and then they brought him over to p- you know to a regular station to see i mean because it was risque show it was just he 

568.75 569.92 B: right 

570.80 583.79 B: and i think the guy i think the guy is genius you know i just think you know it was just he he had something to say to get off his chest and the way that he said it and how he said um 

578.95 580.10 A: mhm 

580.15 581.16 A: mhm 

583.78 594.81 A: well he had to be sly about it you know but then things got out of hand and then he was like getting a little bit too cocky and but also you're gonna step on toes that's why the show was called politically incorrect it wasn't 

583.86 585.05 B: his punch 

585.81 587.40 B: exactly 

589.88 591.15 B: (( right right )) 

594.05 595.20 B: [laughter] 

594.94 599.89 A: it wasn't called politically correct it wasn't called you know the bill maher show you know
