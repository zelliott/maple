23.17 23.94 A: (( i don't )) 

24.44 30.20 A: i mean it sounds easy to say that now i guess and it's har- a little different i guess once you have a situation in front of you 

29.91 32.31 B: circumstances and all that 

30.66 33.99 A: yeah the circumstances and you think about it but 

34.35 42.69 A: i would be i mean it'd be ha- really hard because i'm sure they [mn] the idea is that you probably might damage [laughter] or might help them 

42.62 43.58 B: right 

43.52 46.95 A: i i mean they don't really say but that's what it sounds like [mn] 

46.75 48.09 B: yeah 

47.29 48.73 A: you could imply that

57.10 59.75 B: ah i'd rather just stay out of the court room altogether [laughter] mm 

58.81 64.40 A: oh like definitely [laughter] yeah i try to avoid it every time every chance i can [noise] 

64.64 69.33 A: mm i mean 'cause you know i don't i haven't gotten called yet to do jury duty so 

68.99 70.55 B: yeah i haven't ever either 

71.59 72.45 B: so 

71.95 74.83 A: so i'm glad to be avoiding it [laughter] 

74.35 82.23 B: yep i don't know perjury yeah i mean i don't know i just maybe i wouldn't think i don't lie too much [laughter] only white lies not like a major lie 

80.58 81.54 A: yeah 

81.87 91.55 A: right yeah little lies are [mn] like well you don't want to hurt someone's feelings and stuff like that but this is more you can also go to jail 

87.46 88.44 B: yeah 

92.22 94.05 B: true unless your name's clinton 

94.61 95.49 A: [laughter] i'm sorry

96.89 99.24 A: oh that's right [laughter] 

98.16 100.00 B: [laughter] 

99.77 103.70 A: yeah unless you have a lot of money or you are able to somehow 

103.92 105.61 A: get away with your lie 

106.08 109.77 A: but i always think i get caught i mean no matter what 

108.33 110.35 B: i i do too 

109.96 111.82 A: i'm not a good liar [laughter] 

111.13 115.29 B: uh yeah i tell white lies to my boyfriend it's like it never gets by 

115.31 123.97 A: [laughter] oh i guess he knows you so yeah yeah um i would just be nervous and li- probably mess up they'd start asking 

115.53 117.06 B: [laughter] 

117.85 119.01 B: [laughter] 

124.12 126.64 A: you know the 'specially when you have to deal with l- 

126.66 128.36 A: lawyers and [noise] 

127.67 132.63 B: mhm and they coerce and they don't let you go until they hear what they want to hear [laughter] 

129.53 130.75 A: yeah 

131.97 137.40 A: and they confuse you [laughter] and then suddenly you're like uh you were just you know 

133.72 134.73 B: (( yeah )) 

138.03 140.15 A: s- did it and lied 

140.37 141.77 A: (( um mm mm )) 

143.11 150.28 A: so i would just tell them well you know what the way i am i'm not c- probably going to help you even if i did try and lie they're going to catch me [laughter] 

143.20 144.37 B: (( i agree )) 

149.76 150.97 B: yeah 

150.30 152.87 A: that'd be my way out to you know 

151.83 153.85 B: i just feel like i'm staying out of it 

153.64 154.45 A: yeah 

154.84 156.85 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

157.24 160.15 B: i don't know i would hope they probably never [laughter] put me in that situation 

160.94 165.13 A: yeah you never know sometimes you know things that happen yeah 

165.65 166.47 B: (( well )) 

165.73 166.89 A: who knows i 

167.37 171.79 A: mean um i don't know yeah thank god i haven't had any friends in trouble 

171.48 176.47 B: (( yeah yeah i don't i don't or something i don't know it's kind of topic for me )) 

176.12 177.60 A: yeah me too 

176.72 180.31 B: i don't have too much say and i'm like no i wouldn't [laughter] pretty cut and dry i 

180.38 181.96 A: yeah exactly 

180.96 184.42 B: don't know what would take me to i mean to get me to i 

184.83 193.18 B: don't think i would i mean when it comes down to it i mean if you do something then you know what [lipsmack] sorry you should have been more careful but i'm not going to cover someone's butt though 

193.10 198.32 A: exactly and i guess i don't have i don't have to think about something like that because i 

198.44 202.27 A: i generally hang out with friends and i mean family that are 

203.38 210.22 A: i mean i don't like well i don't i don't have any family i would say that i'd think would ever get into real serious trouble or anything 

209.28 212.25 B: yeah i don't know anyone who's ever been [laughter] in serious trouble 

211.55 220.38 A: exactly so i mean i imagine if you're around you know if your family has that and then [laughter] you probably are more likely to have that situation come up 

219.41 225.04 B: yeah i'd be more the person turn 'em in be like ha ha go [laughter] 

223.46 224.42 A: yeah

542.71 544.37 A: whatever it's like 

545.67 550.09 A: yeah it is i mean people definitely do have things tougher and 

549.46 551.29 B: there's always someone worse off

579.37 581.17 B: (( oh they didn't say that to me )) 

586.66 590.51 A: and i guess a hypothetical would be well what if you had you know this sit- you know 

590.93 592.08 A: you were 

592.60 596.57 A: you had to would you do this perjury mm mm
