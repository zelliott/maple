0.90 2.95 B: hi melanie i'm jan 

3.09 4.05 A: (( how are you )) 

3.74 5.25 B: fine how are you tonight 

4.97 5.89 A: (( good )) 

5.93 9.82 B: so what's your take on when the comedy crosses the line mhm 

9.78 10.82 A: um 

10.84 13.06 A: [noise] i think well 

13.33 14.84 A: speaking from 

14.97 18.78 A: somebody who's [noise] grown up in a pretty religious family 

18.32 19.32 B: mhm 

18.84 20.78 A: i would say that i 

21.35 24.29 A: i'd probably draw the line when it gets a little too 

24.32 26.54 A: you know inappropriate for children 

26.81 29.42 A: um if it gets a little vulgar 

30.41 32.60 A: um i mean i [noise] [sigh] 

34.26 36.56 A: if it's crude or like 

36.71 43.13 A: i don't know something that would make me embarassed in front of my parents that's probably where i would draw [laughter] the line 

43.42 44.75 A: you know and 'cause 

44.83 45.72 A: um 

46.58 51.99 A: i don't know i mean growing up i i really didn't care i mean i i knew when something bothered me 

52.25 53.37 A: but 

53.39 54.44 A: um 

55.08 58.74 A: i'm more into the stupid funny kind of stuff anyway [laughter] so 

57.92 59.13 B: (( mhm mm right right )) 

59.72 63.67 B: uh and really that's basically how you know i was raised 

63.78 72.86 B: you know where we went to church and everything and i agree er for instance redd fo- somebody like redd foxx or eddie murphy 

73.11 74.84 B: and richard pryor 

74.74 76.07 A: mhm 

74.86 77.39 B: you know eh on tour 

77.45 83.47 B: those are all really rank uh you know they they just go into the neverlands you know [laughter] 

82.79 87.71 A: yeah well yeah people like howard stern and you know people 

85.66 95.26 B: right right a- and actually uh you know not only do i think it's distasteful but these these people when they talk like that it just it kind of 

95.43 97.67 B: gets my ire up you know 

97.08 98.50 A: yeah 

97.77 102.72 B: because i've if i just feel like there's nothing sacred any more 

100.78 102.26 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

102.72 116.26 A: well i was watching um [noise] that new i know they did star search a long time ago but they had a new star search out and they had a comedian get up and he was just saying really vulgar things and the uh the judges didn't like it 

108.22 109.14 B: mhm 

115.98 116.91 B: mhm 

116.25 121.39 A: 'cause they had another person come up and talk and he was saying just normal funny jokes and 

120.56 121.50 B: mhm 

121.83 126.10 A: um i thought that was really interesting how um 

126.58 139.90 A: you know people say that the world is you know going down and everybody only thinks that crude things are funny and but it showed me that there still are people out there who don't appreciate it and we're not the only ones 

138.02 138.92 B: right 

139.30 146.06 B: right and i would hope you sound like you're kind of young but i don't know i would hope that 

140.36 141.10 A: um 

146.11 146.95 B: that 

147.12 151.96 B: a lot of the younger people have the same attitude that you have about it because 

151.69 152.81 A: mhm 

152.15 154.40 B: that's my deal with uh 

154.43 155.04 A: (( [noise] )) 

154.65 157.21 B: you know the [sigh] i mean 

158.00 166.29 B: comedy uh the rap music industry it's all there's you know it's no holes barred and i feel like 

163.59 164.88 A: yeah 

166.36 173.38 B: you know i tell i tell the young people i know uh with [noise] with exposure to things like that it's just you know 

173.91 181.83 B: you didn't have that when i was growing up and uh it's just not right some things should not be known [noise] you know 

175.91 177.80 A: yeah 

180.86 183.03 A: well it's you know it 

181.91 183.54 B: or discussed 

183.12 187.58 A: it's obviously taken effect on you know my generation 

187.62 201.23 A: because um i'm twenty but i'm i have noticed it i mean you know all the the movies that were popular when i was in high school and stuff and the jokes that were funny they just weren't i don't know they were more on the 

189.21 190.25 B: yeah 

201.66 204.84 A: you have to be disgusting to be funny you know 

203.85 210.78 B: would you would you say that that is er kind of a general attitude in people your age you think 

210.65 212.85 A: um yeah i'd say so 

211.45 213.95 B: uh of the people you hang with 

213.44 218.63 A: um yeah most of well i usually hung out with people who were more 

218.82 226.90 A: um who have the same interests and beliefs that i did and so but i could but there were other people around me that were 

220.67 221.69 B: right 

222.20 223.11 B: right 

225.65 226.61 B: mhm 

227.01 236.92 A: into all the the gross humor and things like that and they'd you know they'd say they'd tell you jokes like that in class and you 

230.29 231.24 B: mhm 

237.84 242.52 A: you start to wonder you're like why does that why do you think that's funny 

242.44 243.47 B: mhm 

243.00 244.97 A: because i mean 

245.07 249.85 A: especially when they're talking about like the human body or something that's something very personal to people 

249.35 250.39 B: right 

249.96 251.50 A: and [sigh] 

252.13 255.67 A: (( i don't know i just don't [noise] i don't think it's appropriate to [laughter] )) 

255.95 266.22 B: well it and also to me uh you know i'm kind of an oldish er i mean i'm not real old [laughter] probably to you i am i'm like your mom's age probably but uh 

266.80 267.64 B: (( uh )) 

268.02 272.17 B: not from a feminist point of view view but i feel like uh 

272.73 278.98 B: when when they when the comedy reaches that rank point they're typically degrading 

279.08 280.06 B: women 

279.62 281.00 A: yeah they are 

280.45 294.90 B: to do it er to get a laugh and and that's another thing that really gets i mean it really i i real- i take real personal issue with it you know and like i say when it gets like that it actually gets my ire up because i think 

283.22 284.16 A: mhm 

289.17 290.70 A: mhm 

293.97 295.42 A: (( yeah yah )) 

294.98 297.39 B: you know shame on you [laughter] 

296.55 298.10 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

297.79 298.95 B: (( and i )) 

299.03 302.15 B: i'm glad to hear that you know the people that 

302.22 307.57 B: that you hang out with anyway that that's a generalized feeling among them because 

308.28 317.47 B: i it's it's naive and wide eyed but but if comedy and our lifestyle and our behaviour to each other could go back to more like 

317.28 323.91 B: the cleaver family we'll say [laughter] then then what you know i think it's about time for that 

318.64 320.65 A: yeah yeah 

323.79 330.42 A: well i mean it's still funny stuff too you know it doesn't have to be disgusting to be funny 

326.57 328.42 B: right right and 

329.17 334.56 B: cr- i mean yeah i mean laurel and hardy and charlie and chaplin you know [laughter] 

333.80 334.98 A: yeah 

334.63 337.84 B: er great comedians and they didn't even have to talk 

337.25 338.70 A: yeah 

338.42 352.38 B: so and and like martin short now he'd you know i really appreciate his comedy because it's a- and uh you know i've never even heard the man say a curse word which is better than i can say but uh er 

344.47 345.44 A: mhm 

350.71 351.88 A: yeah 

353.12 354.07 B: when you 

354.08 364.10 B: you know when you get into the the really nasty stuff that and it uh yeah i feel like if it's not appropriate for the children then it is not appropriate for me either because 

363.13 365.31 A: yeah er well exactly 

364.69 367.31 B: what kind of example would we be setting 

366.71 368.79 A: setting for our kids yeah [noise] 

367.69 369.95 B: right so 

370.62 371.42 B: uh 

372.31 378.23 B: i think it's like many things in life uh er anything can go too far a- and 

376.69 377.79 A: mhm 

378.57 384.73 B: uh you know i was watching insomniac last night and one section of it was you know 

384.82 394.35 B: er pretty appalling to me and i thought i know this dave guy is kind of out there but there wasn't er er yeah he didn't really need to eh go there 

386.62 387.64 A: mhm 

393.92 407.93 A: yeah well there's a line that people will tend to cross a lot and it's just not necessary 'cause sometimes you know it'll offend people more than it'll [noise] make them laugh so you're just digging yourself into a hole if ya 

394.98 395.84 B: uh 

397.93 398.95 B: yeah 

400.19 401.11 B: yeah 

404.41 405.27 B: right 

407.47 408.17 B: (( mm )) 

408.81 410.17 A: if you do that 

409.80 415.02 B: well i saw and another thing er another area of course that i eh eh 

415.06 417.76 B: draw the line at on comedy is um 

417.79 419.52 B: (( um religious )) 

419.95 421.17 B: blasphemy 

420.75 421.90 A: yeah 

421.25 422.13 B: you know 

421.97 423.88 A: yeah exactly 

422.57 430.45 B: er i know you know i paid to see george carlin and and he was it you know i found out later on that he was an atheist and 

430.51 433.99 B: and he said a lot of blasphemous comments 

433.60 434.68 A: mhm 

434.29 435.36 B: and 

435.10 444.91 A: well i am i am um in a religion that gets teased a lot you know the um [lipsmack] i mean i i can i can take it and i [noise] 

443.54 444.53 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

445.00 449.08 A: but there's a certain point to where it you know 

450.27 459.42 A: [sigh] where people just need to especially when they don't know everything about the religion you know they just are basing it on what they've heard from other people 

456.05 456.99 B: yeah 

458.75 459.87 B: yeah 

459.60 469.23 A: and uh so that's the thing that always gets me upset is when they do when they say things that they know nothing about you know i can take the um 

469.49 473.20 A: you know the mormon jokes about missionaries and all that kind of stuff 

473.38 475.48 A: but to a certain degree 

475.63 486.64 A: but when they start [sigh] um actually saying things about the doctrine [noise] it's [noise] you know it's something that they don't know anything about and i just 

480.99 482.47 B: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

485.12 485.91 B: right 

486.95 489.09 A: try not to listen to it but 

488.28 489.28 B: mhm 

489.51 493.47 A: yeah there's and and it well it goes uh it goes the same for any religion 

493.74 499.47 A: that you know peo- i d- i don't know anything about other i mean know very much about other religions and i wouldn't 

499.53 501.09 A: poke fun at them 

500.87 502.49 B: yeah yeah 

501.52 505.10 A: for the things [sigh] that you know they do so 

504.18 505.03 B: yeah 

505.78 509.44 A: but yeah th- that's that's a big thing that i've noticed too 

510.57 511.69 B: (( yeah yeah and )) 

510.61 511.47 A: (( i'm )) 

511.68 517.19 A: i'm i'm my community is pretty much all the same religion but it 

515.04 515.96 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

517.59 518.55 A: um

527.30 528.07 B: (( hm so )) 

529.63 538.73 B: yeah i i think uh howard stern needs to get a life and all those other rank disgusting people they need to get a life and 

534.36 535.76 A: (( yeah oh no kidding )) 

538.76 546.85 B: uh you know go get a job flipping burgers at mcdonalds or something er i i would never ever like i say it upset me that i 

542.01 543.17 A: (( i know )) 

547.06 549.52 B: found out that that i paid 

549.63 556.75 B: george carlin any money you know when i found out that you know the things he had said 

551.12 552.06 A: mhm 

555.72 557.56 A: yeah 

556.95 561.77 B: not necessarily that he's an atheist because i don't care about that that's his choice 

560.92 562.49 A: yeah 

561.80 568.66 B: but because he was poking fun at god and and like yeah and i said no uh i can't go there

575.17 580.12 A: mhm well it's it's terrible that they're getting paid to do things like that 

579.12 582.92 B: right right when we er you know uh 

583.01 588.46 B: and what's a sad s- statement for society is that like [cough] 

589.47 596.63 B: i'd say probably an eddie murphy uh c._d. would outsell a weird al yankovic c._d. you know 

594.96 595.98 A: mhm
