0.27 2.36 A: hi my name's carlos 

1.95 4.95 B: hi i'm james finley how're you doing 

4.47 5.86 A: great how're you 

5.52 7.39 B: i'm doing well 

6.80 15.40 A: good um perjury i doubt i would i mean i- i'm i'm sure i would not um yes 

13.10 18.90 B: you're sure you would not i'm not sure i'd be able to say that outright just because ah 

18.97 28.05 B: i i think that someone that it was someone i cared about enough to ah to lie for um if they're that kind of person i would ah 

24.75 26.40 A: mhm 

28.12 36.22 B: i would i would they would definitely not want me to lie but i think when i am faced with the decision right in front of me i'm not sure i can make that decision 

31.19 32.11 A: mhm 

36.38 40.67 A: okay perjury meaning mainly to lie 

40.58 43.60 B: yes m- meaning to lie 

41.28 42.29 A: okay 

43.48 45.50 A: meaning to lie well 

44.42 46.16 B: (( right )) 

46.03 51.37 A: [mn] yeah you i guess y- you have a you definitely have a point um 

51.39 56.07 B: i mean i guess i guess it also depends on like how that'll affect other people 

51.45 52.92 A: (( you know that )) 

55.98 56.85 A: right 

56.12 62.61 B: because um if it's only affecting like if it if it were something that if i lied it only have effect on me 

62.43 72.97 B: then that's one thing also but if it's going to affect other people that you know that are innocent um then that's another thing that i'd have to take into account too what do you think 

72.31 84.65 A: i think ah i think you're absolutely right i think the premise of um where the lie would take place would have a big influence on on my decision as to whether i do it or not 

84.62 91.35 A: um and the outcome of it as well i mean of course you know it it it it would depend on 

91.71 100.40 A: several different things you know i i there is nothing i can't imagine not doing for you know the daughter that i one day may have you know 

99.67 100.94 B: mhm 

100.51 102.43 A: so um [mn] 

102.30 115.90 A: i- i- i- i guess the premise and the outcome of it would play a big role um my initial um reaction to anything that is that ah that has to do with dishonesty or or 

115.74 120.78 A: anything that has to do with um illegal matters is just you know 

120.81 125.78 A: um i'm just that straightforward and i just don't play that way 

125.16 125.62 B: (( [noise] )) 

125.48 130.47 B: well that's that has to do with your character i mean [mn] that's i mean that's if you ch- if you you know 

127.21 128.49 A: r- right 

130.36 142.62 B: change that then you know then you're losing a lot of yourself but i mean i think i think a big question is like what the the perjury or the lying would be about too i mean [mn] you can say like outright like 

142.43 147.83 B: basic like because of my character like [noise] i will not lie i'll not do this stuff um 

148.07 157.71 B: but ah i mean on a on a higher level there's a- so many kinda like exceptions to that rule that it's hard to be able to say that outright 

154.38 155.59 A: exactly 

157.43 159.72 A: exactly yeah you're absolutely 

159.61 169.73 B: mhm [mn] so like i guess the question to ask for you is um would it make a difference ah what the um [mn] what the outcome of your lying would would result in if you lied 

160.45 162.41 A: (( right )) 

169.50 176.04 B: if they would save money or if you lied and they wouldn't have physical harm if that'd make a difference to you 

175.94 177.77 A: that would make a [mn] 

177.83 185.02 A: world of a difference to me you know if if it's a lie concerning something as trivial as well i mean 

178.77 180.60 B: [laughter] 

184.79 186.80 A: maybe not trivial because 

186.60 197.32 A: i mean when it comes to say money it may not be trivial because we may be talking about millions of dollars it may be trivial 'cause we may be talking about three hundred dollars you know 

192.27 193.90 B: yeah mhm 

195.96 197.03 B: (( uh-huh mm )) 

197.20 204.83 A: if it's a life and death situation if it's bodily harm injury i would i would more than likely do what i have to do 

204.50 205.35 B: uh-huh 

205.17 207.25 A: however um [mn] 

207.75 213.25 A: i'd i that that's what i mean by th- the outcome of it you know 

211.64 220.35 B: [noise] mhm [mn] so so the amount of money makes a difference to you like if ah say a couple of hundred dollars were involved or if a couple of million dollars were involved 

217.70 218.39 A: (( [noise] )) 

219.90 223.71 A: no that's what i mean i it would not make a difference i mean 

221.25 222.07 B: okay 

222.50 224.46 B: it wouldn't make a difference okay 

224.32 229.08 A: (( it the [mn] i i i would say i would i would have to say )) 

229.46 233.65 A: it it would have to be you know something related to 

233.76 245.40 A: um bodily harm injury you know life life or death situation and um and of course i mean you know depends on also 

245.77 256.24 A: the premises of you know [mn] what are you lying about you know i mean because if you're like you said i mean yo- you encompassed 

250.35 251.36 B: uh-huh 

256.19 265.76 A: a lot i- in with your initial statement meaning you know if if any other people are going to be effected directly effected by it then 

266.19 270.97 A: more than likely not and and i couldn't agree any more with that you know um 

267.73 268.73 B: mhm 

271.79 274.21 B: [lipsmack] now does it make a difference what the um 

272.64 273.20 A: (( [mn] )) 

274.03 286.46 B: who the person is that the outcome's going to be coming against like um say we- we- we're gonna stick with bodily harm because um that's what we both said would we would ah we would lie for or [mn] commit perjury for 

284.34 285.95 A: mhm 

286.27 299.10 B: um now if it was someone that might have bodily harm that wouldn't be you know wouldn't be death it'd be bodily harm to someone you don't know as opposed to someone you do know would that make a difference to whether you would commit perjury 

299.59 305.69 A: absolutely not absolutely not um i would y- 

301.14 302.48 B: it wouldn't 

305.71 306.95 A: (( y- you know it )) 

307.00 309.04 A: i would not 

309.23 312.80 A: i would defend with as much might 

312.90 316.72 A: a person i didn't know than a person 

316.97 318.41 A: i did know 

318.76 321.44 A: family or not if this person 

321.33 335.08 A: is in is in danger ah in you know bodily ah or life and death danger i'd i'd that is that's the way i am i'd i would fight as with as much might with f- for 

321.86 322.43 B: (( [noise] )) 

334.95 337.65 A: anyone who um 

338.15 341.03 A: who would be ah in in in dan- 

341.53 343.15 A: in that sort of danger 

343.62 344.44 B: (( [mn] now wh- )) 

343.77 346.19 A: whether i know the person or not 

345.80 352.63 B: now what do you think about the repercussions of it like would the repercussions of your lying to you would that make a difference 

353.48 358.58 B: to ah yes your personal personal repercussions yeah 

353.58 354.93 A: to me [mn] 

355.15 356.36 A: certainly 

358.98 361.40 A: you mean um if i 

360.18 361.03 B: like 

361.30 376.24 B: like like the difference would be like would you um commit perjury to save someone you didn't knows um you know from getting a bodily harm if it just hurts your reputation or would you commit perjury if it would like cause you physical bodily harm 

377.77 378.34 A: (( [mn] )) 

378.36 379.59 A: well 

379.88 388.56 A: [mn] i guess um the best way i can think of answering that question is i would commit perjury if 

389.10 389.66 A: (( [mn] )) 

389.78 393.13 A: such person was in grave danger 

392.82 394.13 B: mhm 

393.50 400.68 A: and no one else would be gravely effected by me by my actions 

400.61 401.39 B: (( okay )) 

401.50 406.63 A: okay so in other words i mean if i'm including myself most definitely [noise] yes 

402.79 404.16 B: including yourself 

405.18 405.94 B: okay 

406.01 407.16 B: (( all right [noise] )) 

407.18 409.62 A: i mean if i you know if i 

409.69 410.80 A: would ah 

411.58 412.42 A: (( [noise] )) 

412.52 416.37 A: sorry um if i would ah if i would be 

417.16 418.76 A: you know if i [mn] 

420.47 427.02 A: borrowing from peter to pay paul in a situation like that then i mean no you know it's 

426.71 427.70 B: uh-huh 

427.04 430.71 A: be- because it wouldn't be fair to that someone who 

430.83 432.22 A: i didn't know 

432.00 434.42 B: kind of defeats the purpose of doing that huh 

432.25 433.33 A: even if i 

433.82 435.81 A: exactly 

434.60 436.87 B: uh-huh [mn] i read ya 

435.86 441.65 A: that's why i that's what i sorta mean by the you know the premises of it i mean it 

440.00 440.92 B: uh-huh 

442.77 446.52 A: that would that would play a big big role also 

447.15 448.67 A: in my decision making 

448.14 455.27 B: [noise] yeah there's so many ah issues involved here i can't i don't know if i could say outright yes or no but um 

455.67 458.31 B: my my general rule is um 

458.33 460.48 B: if it helps someone that's 

460.60 472.12 B: in need oh yeah what about that what if what if the person you would be saving is like a a bad person they'd done a really bad thing um that's you know disconnected from the um 

472.44 483.33 B: the i don't know the the harm or whatever's going to come to them now or if they're like a holy person or a very righteous person you know someone who's done a lot of good for people would that make any difference 

481.82 482.80 A: right 

484.23 485.17 B: to you 

484.23 485.31 A: (( um [mn] )) 

485.97 489.41 A: well yes it would make a difference to me 

488.63 497.99 B: i mean if you knew that they had a history of doing horrible things and you had a you were in a position to like save them by lying like would you do it 

489.67 491.00 A: it would 

498.82 500.14 A: [noise] again 

500.04 501.83 B: [laughter] 

500.19 509.61 A: um [mn] it would depend you know it would depend on on what repercussions my lie would would my committing perjury would would ah 

502.38 503.32 B: yeah 

509.65 512.19 A: implicate you know um 

510.48 511.94 B: (( [noise] okay )) 

512.23 513.70 A: it would i mean 

514.05 519.11 A: [mn] of course ah you know one is no one can be the judge hello
