13.97 15.65 A: (( [laughter] [noise] in bakersfield )) 

16.43 20.65 B: so i think they want us to talk about comedy and what we don't like about it 

16.52 17.75 A: anyhow 

20.41 25.82 A: uh whether we think there should be guidelines and you know what's acceptable and what isn't [noise] 

23.65 24.62 B: yeah 

26.08 30.35 A: and i to me a lot of it depends on where you're at who's with you 

30.83 33.26 A: [noise] you know and where the comedy's coming from 

33.34 36.73 B: i think so too um you know some jokes you wouldn't 

35.26 40.30 A: you know if you're at a nightclub with a bunch of adults [noise] it's gonna be geared towards that 

40.05 41.08 B: right 

40.58 42.69 A: [noise] but i don't think it should be 

43.17 46.18 A: on primetime television when children are up 

46.33 48.07 B: i agree um 

46.96 50.51 A: where they can you know even accidentally they can get to it 

49.88 51.69 B: [laughter] 

51.05 52.00 A: (( you know )) 

52.27 55.38 B: well they're gonna get to anything they want to if they want it bad enough 

53.89 60.17 A: that's right but i'm talking about small children 'cause i have like a four year old and a [noise] six year old grandchild they're always over here 

59.90 61.20 B: yeah 

60.97 63.63 A: [lipsmack] and matter of fact the six year old's here right now 

63.86 78.57 A: and [noise] he just starts flipping channels he knows most of the channels he wants but every once in a while he does a male thing you know where he's pushing the button up up up up and it goes from one channel to the other well you think there's something i don't want him to see even for a second you know 

71.89 72.94 B: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

77.09 78.33 B: right 

79.34 80.83 A: (( [noise] [lipsmack] and uh )) 

81.17 87.88 A: he's pretty good though but th- basically i i just feel that you know it accounts on where you're at who you're with 

88.36 92.54 A: i don't mind off color humor if it's in the right place and the right context 

92.17 98.93 B: well i just don't like it when they get too sexually explicit especially when they're always using the f. word i mean 

95.33 96.37 A: yeah 

97.81 101.69 A: yeah yeah well that that's just vulgar that that's not funny 

99.85 100.70 B: (( yeah )) 

101.32 104.92 B: right some of them they just it's f. every other word and they just 

103.87 108.69 A: yeah yeah and you know um like billy cosby is the perfect example of a comedian to me 

108.07 109.01 B: yes 

109.01 113.59 A: he was a gentleman his humor was hilarious [noise] but it was real 

113.90 116.63 A: [noise] he didn't have to get done to the you know 

116.57 117.48 B: right 

116.73 121.46 A: the vulgarities that they use nowadays i mean it's even in their music you know 

122.24 125.28 A: and uh and i love music [noise] 

125.10 131.68 B: i think they're they're trying to do a lot of it it's just shock value they don't have enough content to what they're trying to be funny about so 

128.14 129.02 A: yeah 

131.49 138.97 A: well i don't know how old you are but i all i know is i think the fact is that even though i was a only child and i was a latchkey kid [noise] 

139.39 140.27 A: uh 

140.82 143.53 A: kids my age generally had a parent home 

144.18 145.16 A: you know 

144.81 145.74 B: right 

145.81 153.80 A: and [noise] a lot of it is the kids do not have somebody at home now while they're you know when they get home from school 

154.34 168.71 A: [noise] and so they're they have free range i mean you can say don't watch this don't watch that unless the parent takes the time to go through figuring out [laughter] how to use these things that come with the ta- t._v. or the cable and how how to block it out 

168.22 173.62 B: well then a lot of times the kids can figure it out they they're more technology savvy than we are 

170.22 172.34 A: (( oh they they're not stupid they know )) 

173.10 177.96 A: oh yeah [noise] [lipsmack] and it isn't difficult for them to figure out your passwords either 

177.49 181.01 B: [laughter] no [laughter] you got to make it simple enough to remember 

178.50 180.22 A: [noise] not at all yeah 

180.77 181.47 A: (( you )) 

181.86 186.74 A: know it's generally one of their birth dates or something [laughter] like that something that's [noise] memorable 

184.73 186.10 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

187.72 191.74 A: [noise] yeah they're they're pretty smart too smart on some things 

191.92 194.79 A: [noise] but uh no i [lipsmack] i love humor 

195.48 202.68 A: and i don't mind a little bit of vulgarity but when that is all there is to it and there is no comedy then what's the point [noise] 

202.34 203.34 B: right 

203.02 206.44 A: you know i might as well just go down and listen to the truck drivers 

206.46 214.59 A: [laughter] you know they're not trying to be funny it's just part of the language and there's a lot of truck drivers i know that would not use that language in front of a woman 

214.31 215.65 B: right 

215.00 215.87 A: (( you know )) 

216.31 221.79 A: [lipsmack] so i i i just don't understand it it's s- it's more like a shock value nowadays 

221.92 223.95 B: i think you're right um 

223.26 224.86 A: yeah 

225.51 232.25 A: i remember what's his name [noise] oh the comedy comedian supposedly everybody hates 'cause he's such a 

232.79 236.60 A: [noise] especially the feminists are really against him oh what was his name [lipsmack] 

238.51 240.27 B: [noise] it's not coming to mind 

238.84 239.52 A: i 

239.58 242.41 A: i can see him i can see him in front of me 

241.40 242.15 B: [laughter] 

242.46 244.22 A: he made a movie 

246.37 247.34 A: (( [noise] [noise] but )) 

247.40 254.06 A: i- it it's just vul- i mean h- it's just foul mouth all the way through and yet he did do some comedy 

251.72 252.67 B: (( [noise] [noise] right [noise] )) 

254.33 259.61 A: but i just sit and nobody wanted to listen to him 'cause he would just you know put down females all the time 

259.83 263.13 A: and with the vulgar mouth you know who needed to listen to him 

263.06 275.78 B: well then there's also the guy bashing you know they they you know the women get up there and then they can't say anything nice about a man i mean like you know you can tell aggie jokes or polish jokes and stuff like i think it depends on 

266.06 267.05 A: oh yeah 

268.81 269.75 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

273.90 274.70 A: right 

274.89 282.21 A: well you take a polish joke or a jewish jokes you can apply any nationality to any of those jokes and somebody's gonna think it's funny 

281.79 282.71 B: (( right [noise] )) 

282.46 283.39 A: you know 

284.13 289.62 A: [lipsmack] and see like cosby he never he never did anything that would put down his race [noise] [noise] 

284.35 285.56 B: and 

289.59 300.30 B: well the thing too is you can tell a joke about every day life because you're you're looking at it slightly off balance from what the way the rest of us are just you know running through life and you can make it funny 

296.99 298.17 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

300.02 300.89 A: yeah 

300.07 306.21 B: and you can make it where you're not really offending anybody and you're actually making people think a little bit 

305.96 307.38 A: [noise] that's right 

307.50 313.13 A: [noise] an- and you know there's more humor i think in just our every day lives [noise] you know 

313.46 317.17 A: i watch these grand kids of mine and they they'll bust you up 

317.21 322.40 A: and just on words that they're understanding one way and we're saying another way 

322.01 323.03 B: right 

322.94 325.95 A: and they don't relate to it at all [laughter] you know 

326.21 329.08 A: i mean and there there's just too much humor in life 

329.55 340.98 B: [noise] [noise] unfortunately unfortunately i should say most of us don't look for it we we wait for it to kind of hit us over the head if we look for it a little bit more i think we'd find it a lot easier than and it'd make life a lot easier 

335.56 336.47 A: yeah 

340.61 343.95 A: yeah yeah well you know a lot of people didn't care for roseanne 

344.08 345.28 B: i don't 

344.97 349.51 A: well as a stand up comedian i didn't think she was so great but i loved her show 

350.07 355.59 A: because to me she dealt with life as a realist instead of candy coating it 

355.83 363.22 A: and she had all the problems that you know anybody could possibly have and she dealt with them strongly i felt 

357.86 359.19 B: (( yeah [noise] right )) 

362.54 370.79 B: well i wouldn't even watch her show though because i didn't like her in real life because her stand up comedy or you know grabbing her crutch it you know to me it 

365.92 368.32 A: oh see i didn't care for her stand up comedy 

369.29 372.46 A: yeah she's a bit vulgar in her stand up comedy whereas 

370.84 376.41 B: yeah and if i watch her show i feel like i'm endorsing her somewhat so i don't even watch her show 

374.76 379.41 A: yeah yeah but see i enjoyed her show just like i i like uh [lipsmack] 

380.51 386.67 A: oh i wouldn't i wouldn't want the grand kids seeing it 'cause i feel they're too young for a lot of the stuff on there 

386.91 389.85 A: um [lipsmack] my wife and kids 

389.27 390.87 B: yeah 

390.80 395.17 A: because he's so strict and he's so against everything you know 

395.93 398.32 A: but it was all stuff he did as a kid 

398.03 399.16 B: right 

398.54 399.54 A: you know 

399.28 403.11 B: we got away with it but we don't want our kids to get away with it yeah [laughter] 

401.13 405.68 A: that's right you know and i really enjoy his show you know 

404.19 407.22 B: yeah i like it uh damon wayans

412.92 413.99 A: (( uh [lipsmack] )) 

414.39 423.80 A: he comes from four boys that were in trouble and everything else and it wasn't 'cause of the kind of home they came from but they learned real quick too that this isn't the way to live 

424.26 425.23 A: (( you know )) 

425.59 436.86 A: and i guess in his own real life uh h- his daughters have a hard time their boyfriends have a hard time bringing home dates [laughter] bringing them home to meet dad so i br- i guess he brings it over into his show yeah 

431.74 432.86 B: [laughter] 

436.16 437.66 B: yeah 

438.34 443.85 A: yeah to me cosby was just about the him an- and the old timers like bob newhart

471.11 478.91 B: but if you if you were not knowledgeable you wouldn't have picked up on it so you had to be a little bit more mature an- and i think that's the way jokes ought to be 

472.01 473.09 A: [noise] but it was not 

474.37 475.52 A: that's right 

476.23 477.12 A: right
