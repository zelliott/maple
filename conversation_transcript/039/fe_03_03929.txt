348.40 362.24 A: yeah so so i think there's a lot of stuff out there as long as it's not vicious and and as long as it's not ah ah so called dirty um i think it's fine i think that ah you know we all need to laugh and ah 

362.32 364.11 A: in our lives you know 

363.95 368.06 B: you know it's kind of funny how the difference in what

374.12 381.10 A: yeah that's true that's true absolutely and i think politics is always great ah great for humor 

375.30 376.27 B: uh-huh 

380.50 381.45 B: uh-huh 

381.14 389.28 A: because um ah how politicians and and people in the limelight continually put their foot in their mouth 

388.69 390.19 B: [laughter] yeah 

389.11 397.73 A: a- always makes me laugh because because you would think that by this time they would they would learn and and still they do what they do 

397.36 398.88 B: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

397.98 400.95 A: and and that never ceases to me amaze so 

401.29 413.88 A: so i get a kick out of that um now now how does this work that when this is done um they'll let us know when ten minutes i- has passed i mean i have a i have a clock on the computer actually

413.62 415.12 B: (( evidently )) 

415.01 416.21 A: yeah and 

415.30 422.06 B: because it's usually it's the computer that's getting us all together and everything 

421.48 425.84 A: and if and if they like us the first time they'll call us again 

425.82 432.06 B: i think so i that's what i understood and and i think there's three of 'em 

428.95 430.22 A: okay
