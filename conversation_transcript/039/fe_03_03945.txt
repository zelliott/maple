9.10 10.01 B: (( oh okay )) 

10.37 11.69 B: (( oh okay )) 

11.65 12.67 A: um 

12.85 18.84 A: [cough] i'd like to start with [mn] i feel that anything that's degrading to any race or 

19.27 22.24 A: um sex is not acceptable 

21.82 25.43 B: [mn] [mn] i i agree with that i think um 

25.45 26.45 B: like 

26.66 28.86 B: the topic um 

29.40 33.12 B: humor can be taken several different ways and if 

33.15 38.76 B: you know i think most people know where that line is that and they shouldn't cross it 

38.86 39.78 B: um 

40.09 44.37 B: i don't i don't know why some people think that degrading others or 

44.54 55.82 B: m- making comments about either their ah religion or their race or their political views um or making fun of them um that isn't humor really 

55.77 59.73 A: i totally agree it's degrading to a person and 

60.02 61.12 B: that's true 

61.70 62.59 B: um 

62.96 69.05 A: i think it varies too whether or not you know the individual who for instance would be telling the joke or not it's 

68.53 69.51 B: right 

69.31 72.79 A: they know your feelings on certain issues 

70.85 71.99 B: mhm 

72.41 74.95 B: well yes among friends you know 

74.86 76.09 A: mhm 

75.02 78.34 B: i think we all may be crossing the line a little 

78.63 87.16 B: with just ah with two people that know each other they take it a different way but um it's very hard to 

84.01 84.86 A: right 

87.25 88.78 B: um accept 

89.35 91.73 B: some of the remarks that people make even 

92.16 95.24 B: on shows on t._v. that 

94.72 98.13 A: well yeah i was just thinking about like jay leno or letterman 

95.29 96.24 B: comedy 

97.50 105.97 B: oh oh yeah so you know when when somebody like that does it in a public forum um it's very hard um 

106.08 109.09 B: i think most of us know 

109.40 110.60 B: where 

110.62 114.07 B: we shouldn't be going in a group that we don't know 

114.17 115.08 B: and um 

114.25 115.11 A: right 

116.26 117.88 B: go ahead 

117.43 119.75 A: oh no no go go on [laughter] 

119.11 121.51 B: [laughter] okay well no i mean 

121.95 127.07 B: [cough] i don't think it's right for public figures whether it's a politician 

127.14 130.35 B: and they do a lot of times say things that 

130.36 135.94 B: like they come back later and say oh i apologize i didn't mean that well if they 

135.14 138.73 A: well it's too late because you've already seen their true colors 

138.12 147.18 B: yes yes and you know i know the old saying sticks and stones can break your bones but words can never hurt me yes they can and 

146.41 147.56 A: mhm 

147.32 155.86 B: i think if they know if they know that it's so bad that they have to come back and retract it then why did they say it in the first place 

155.99 161.99 A: [mn] right right and then um your impression of that individual has also decreased a lot 

161.57 166.91 B: very much so and it happens a lot unfortunately in the political arena 

166.96 167.84 A: mhm 

166.97 170.02 B: and i listen to some of them say things i think 

170.19 172.83 B: what are you thinking you know [laughter] 

172.16 174.77 A: oh exactly exactly 

173.80 175.47 B: (( [laughter] i know )) 

175.52 183.60 B: ah and you pretty much know when somebody like that is making comments you know yourself that that isn't humor 

183.82 184.67 A: right 

184.00 185.88 B: so you would think that 

184.80 187.02 A: that it's just plain old inappropriate 

186.64 188.81 B: exactly so if ah 

189.21 195.44 B: if they know enough to apologize then wouldn't they know enough not to make remarks 

195.64 203.63 A: you would think so [mn] i can understand it's hard to be p._c. all the time [mn] but especially when you're in the public's eye it 

197.16 197.73 B: (( [laughter] )) 

200.57 201.52 B: right 

203.67 206.94 A: there are just lines as you said that you don't cross 

206.72 210.57 B: exactly i agree totally it's um 

212.19 215.48 B: [cough] [mn] i don't really understand why people 

215.68 224.04 B: have to say things that i mean we all have our private thoughts about religion politics humor you know 

223.36 224.44 A: mhm 

224.33 225.95 B: (( but ha- )) 

226.52 233.38 B: having that feeling yourself doesn't mean that you should put it out there for the world to hear you know we all 

232.73 235.83 A: well and especially when they're people that we respect 

235.64 236.69 B: right 

236.16 238.37 A: or people that we should respect [mn] 

237.92 239.35 B: [mn] that's true 

239.24 240.48 A: yeah 

240.82 244.01 A: um have you ever been to like a comedy show or 

245.04 245.92 B: um 

245.29 247.50 A: any any type of comedian 

247.44 249.18 B: well just um 

249.99 254.41 B: no i can't really say in in person i can't say that i have been 

254.62 255.61 B: (( have you )) 

255.07 257.91 A: no but i i recently went to one and 

257.66 258.58 B: did you 

257.98 260.94 A: he wasn't very fond of females 

260.88 262.07 B: oh 

260.97 267.15 A: and his whole show was based on degrading women and i walked out of there so pissed off 

266.49 268.59 B: oh no kidding 

268.42 275.39 A: i just couldn't believe that anyone and it was at least seventy five percent women in the audience and i just couldn't believe that he would do that 

272.49 273.67 B: (( mhm )) 

274.64 280.70 B: my goodness he wasn't playing to the house then was he he was making it too personal 

277.96 278.96 A: no 

280.69 281.56 A: right 

281.04 284.27 B: ahah that must have been an uncomfortable evening 

284.00 287.21 A: yeah it definitely was one that i wouldn't repeat [laughter] 

286.99 291.87 B: no i'm afraid not well did anyone else leave also were they 

291.44 302.67 A: um i i was actually with a group of men so they they didn't they kind of sympathized but [mn] you know to them it was funny and i was sitting there thinking this is not what i stand for 

301.24 302.05 B: (( mm )) 

303.03 304.25 B: (( well [cough] )) 

304.29 318.68 B: there are more than a few differences between men and women and i think if it's an all male group fine you know whatever but if it's a mixed group you really have to watch what you say because you don't know how 

312.29 313.33 A: mhm 

318.88 321.97 B: [mn] someone's going to take it and 

321.13 322.21 A: definitely

327.48 330.33 A: yeah in in the audience there were yeah 

329.25 330.56 B: yeah okay

344.62 345.61 A: okay 

347.01 348.32 A: oh [mn] 

350.88 356.77 B: [cough] theatre here that they have um the shows revolve [mn] it's 

357.15 363.31 B: they have like a comedy group or they'll have a musical group or poetry or whatever 

363.36 367.28 B: and i haven't been myself but i know 

363.38 364.25 A: mhm 

367.31 372.42 B: i have a friend who had been when they had a comedy night and she said 

372.99 381.93 B: i c- maybe it's me she said i don't i just don't find any of what they said funny and so i asked her for some examples and 

382.14 391.89 B: she was right you know it's it's ah this is a kind of a small area the native north carolinians already kind of resent 

386.86 387.72 A: mhm 

391.91 397.74 B: people who move here and try to change the mountain into what they what they left 

395.65 396.51 A: mhm 

397.76 407.71 B: and um they don't take real kindly to people making a- and it really is making fun of their hometown area whether 

407.14 408.75 A: oh i can imagine 

408.21 417.52 B: right i mean it's it's sort of like going um on t._v. and slamming one whole section of the country and ah 

418.68 420.40 B: even when th- 

421.01 425.14 B: when they were talking and telling jokes and doing things and stuff 

425.45 430.40 B: e- even he has to know that this stuff is not funny and 

430.48 434.06 B: she called the management on the way out and said i will never come back 

434.20 444.38 B: and i don't know what i cant remember now what he said but it was bad enough that it turned her against maybe returning some for some other type of show 

444.79 445.69 B: (( so )) 

445.97 447.83 A: that's so sad too 

447.31 458.39 B: yeah it is it is especially when people come here from other places and then make fun of the natives here no wonder they want everybody to go home you know [laughter] 

457.54 462.56 A: oh right right well it's almost like some of the comedians are just scraping the bottom of the barrel 

462.11 463.48 B: mhm 

462.82 467.43 A: you know everything's been done so now it's pick on anyone we can find [mn] 

466.86 468.61 B: well it's like 

468.64 472.47 B: wha- what limit can we reach um you 

472.60 487.25 B: know where where do we go that it isn't far enough and ah i don't find profanity humorous ah whether it's jokes being told by male or female its offensive you know ah they 

476.47 477.36 A: mhm 

484.75 485.64 A: mhm 

487.21 489.74 B: they don't stop to think that you know 

490.32 496.31 B: the joke of the day isn't always um well received by the audience 

496.27 502.56 A: right you have to consider that audience but you make a good point too that it seems like a lot of people push the limits 

498.10 499.07 B: mhm 

502.13 503.39 B: oh they do 

503.15 505.54 A: when is it that you're gonna stop me 

505.11 506.10 B: mhm 

506.11 514.82 B: it's like well we've done all we've we've gone as far as we think we can go so now what else can we do sure profanity um 

514.89 524.94 B: ah i don't i would never go to a night club would never go to anywhere that there were male or female strippers it's not funny you know 

523.11 523.78 A: no 

524.85 528.05 A: no not at that is not entertainment 

527.43 530.87 B: no no and i you know sure [mn] 

530.90 533.78 B: it's like when they talk about television 

533.86 546.17 B: you shouldn't wanna let your well parents will say well you shouldn't be putting that on t._v. and they say well just turn it off well it isn't that simple you know the parents if you're out somewhere you don't know

555.96 557.25 A: mhm 

558.94 563.17 B: i- it's just a really fine line that you have to walk between 

563.23 568.30 B: whether you're politically correct or or humorous and there are some 

568.37 573.16 B: there are some comedians that are just knockdown hysterically funny 

573.21 576.13 B: but unfortunately there are not as many 

573.33 574.31 A: mhm 

576.16 579.20 B: clean comedians as there used to be
