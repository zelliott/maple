3.29 5.33 A: hi i'm tammy [laughter] 

5.13 7.26 B: hi tammy 

6.32 8.74 A: hi you know actually when i was um 

8.91 14.78 A: in college i did a documentary um for one of my ah 

15.01 18.76 A: my video classes on comedy so 

18.90 30.21 A: i i pretty much have been very familiar with this topic and i don't really think that there's anything where i would draw the line because if it's funny it's funny it may not be funny to one person but somebody else or someone else 

30.66 36.73 A: see i don't believe that you can really insult anybody um unless some people don't like to make fun of handicap 

36.76 43.51 A: or you know things like that that [noise] you know it may not be funny to them but some people may think it's funny 

43.76 46.63 B: right i think if you go into that topic 

47.11 49.06 B: ah you're open for anything 

47.57 55.29 A: [noise] yeah especially if there are handicapped comedians that are going to make fun of themselves and if they can do it why can't somebody else 

55.39 56.73 A: (( i mean it's really )) 

57.34 60.42 A: not too much i mean i probably wouldn't um 

61.25 63.30 A: you know if it was like maybe 

63.61 71.84 A: a person that somebody really like a a major role model to society that just passed away or something i probably wouldn't make fun of them 

71.95 73.02 A: um 

74.00 79.98 A: you know 'ause that's kind of [mn] if it if it's something that would make people sad to make fun of i wouldn't do it but 

80.09 81.34 A: otherwise it's 

81.61 86.34 A: pretty much funny [laughter] i i don't believe in overdoing it like um 

86.59 90.94 A: you know like all the michael jackson jokes and all that stuff that's kind of like beating a dead horse it's 

91.05 93.43 A: not too much as funny as sad anymore 

95.40 97.20 B: right 

95.98 99.26 A: i really can't think of much that i would think 

99.74 102.08 A: would be tasteless anyway 

101.92 105.05 B: well let's see i'm not sure ah 

106.12 112.35 B: i mean if you're in a club and someone is making fun of someone with crutches or you know and they're making yes 

108.15 120.40 A: see no but it can be funny i mean it won't be funny for them [laughter] or they might laugh but i mean you know it's 

114.15 115.23 B: (( no yeah )) 

120.42 126.62 A: everybody has their own view of what's humorous um i i've heard people make fun of the war 

127.16 131.66 A: but there's probably people that are over there fighting it that don't think it's funny but 

132.59 136.11 A: you know people like me i mean i've laughed at some of the jokes [laughter] 

136.33 142.32 B: that right yeah well w- okay so would they draw the line on death 

138.73 140.51 A: (( [noise] )) 

142.72 143.42 A: no 

143.64 145.24 A: because we all have to die 

144.97 149.50 B: because everything's open when you go into a club so it's got to be in a club then 

149.20 156.06 A: yeah i i mean anything i've gone to comedy clubs a lot but you know we're all going to die nobody's going to live forever so 

149.92 151.29 B: because then you're 

153.49 154.37 B: yeah 

156.66 158.04 A: why not make fun of

163.50 166.08 B: that kind of stuff you know you draw the line 

165.87 169.58 A: i mean if somebody said to me ha ha you're going to die in a week 

169.80 172.52 A: you know i don't think that'll be too funny but 

172.78 176.02 A: i mean if they're talking about five years from now 

176.26 178.08 A: i might laugh a little bit 

178.70 183.62 A: you know if i had like cancer and i knew i was like you know i was in the hospital and i was getting ready to die of course i wouldn't 

182.15 182.85 B: (( right [noise] )) 

183.66 184.64 A: from that 

185.42 189.30 B: there you go h- so hospital would be off rules 

189.25 191.38 A: well i i mean it depends on 

191.46 195.78 A: if somebody's on knocking on death's door i don't think you should poke fun of it 

196.50 197.65 A: yeah that's kind of 

198.12 203.46 A: cold [laughter] i mean you don't want to be mean being mean and being funny aren't the same thing 

202.19 206.04 B: (( right right [noise] so then comedy how about sexual comedy ))

208.99 210.09 A: um 

210.35 216.63 B: i mean the way the internet is you can find some funny jokes on there and dirty pictures and you know 

211.85 212.79 A: yeah 

213.66 221.97 A: oh yeah i get 'em all the time and i love passing jokes on the internet but i don't find too many um i mean i like male bashing jokes sure

223.45 225.97 A: yeah i mean i pass those myself 

225.40 226.37 B: yeah 

227.14 232.05 A: but most of the womens are all the same you know it's usually some blond chick they're making fun of 

232.23 233.60 B: (( oh yeah )) 

232.48 238.30 A: you know and h- i mean how many blond jokes can you possibly hear before it all starts sounding corny

237.94 239.26 B: right 

239.60 241.65 A: you know and and it 

239.62 244.35 B: of course that could be discrimination then about the the red headed chick 

244.42 246.90 B: how come there's no jokes about red heads 

246.72 248.93 A: because they're not funny they're ugly 

249.92 258.89 A: [laughter] i mean you're not going to i mean that's the only jokes you could about red headed people is that they're they're ugly and [laughter]

270.90 271.74 B: (( year )) 

274.38 276.74 A: gender jokes are definitely 

277.12 279.80 A: i'm all for it i'm into ah ah 

279.86 287.28 A: any ethnic jokes that those are funny because ah comedians will make fun of their own ethnicities so they could do it aye why not 

284.96 288.26 B: yeah yeah so who is your favorite comedian 

289.88 293.14 A: right now like stand up or just like in a movie 

292.87 295.31 B: well like all time comedian

297.33 298.52 A: richard prior 

298.31 300.08 B: bill cosby 

299.47 300.74 A: richard prior 

300.18 301.50 B: richard prior 

300.88 303.48 A: because everybody copied him he was like original 

303.76 304.62 B: yeah 

303.82 316.30 A: because he tells he made fun of himself most of like if you look at like right along sunset strip most of the stand up was him making fun of the stupid mistakes he made you know like when he did drugs and when he did this and when he you know the 

306.00 306.86 B: yeah 

312.37 313.29 B: right 

316.31 330.55 A: so and it was funny he you know and i think it's you know that he he made made comedy where it's there's no limits you know anything goes anything's funny especially when it came to making fun of himself so if he could do it then 

328.29 329.21 B: (( [noise] [cough] )) 

330.82 333.71 A: i can make fun of him and i'm sure he'd probably laugh 

335.18 340.48 A: so he started i mean there was like a lot of new guys that are good too but you know he's you know 

340.64 346.03 A: he's major you know of course is is funny and bertie mack 

346.26 347.44 A: chris tucker 

347.05 349.50 B: right bertie m- i've heard of that 

349.49 354.43 A: um he's got a t._v. show on fox and he was in a couple of movies 

352.43 356.02 B: oh yeah okay i think i saw that not too long ago right 

354.84 361.10 A: yeah yeah chris rock a lot of people don't like him because i think he offends people like when he did the ah 

361.07 372.85 A: some of the he hosted some of the music awards and he was making fun of some of the celebrities they didn't laugh but i laughed [laughter] i mean they didn't think it was funny because they did some stupid things that he brought up and threw in their face 

372.64 377.19 A: but they shouldn't have did those stupid things if you don't want people to make fun of it then don't be stupid 

377.63 382.53 A: and so they yeah he he was he's a very raw comedian he does not care 

382.79 387.72 A: (( if you're going to boo him or whatever if he has something to say and he thinks it's funny he's going to say it but he's )) 

388.01 391.76 A: he's kind of right on top of my list of people that i i would go see 

391.93 394.18 A: you know a movie or in concert 

394.19 394.85 B: (( mm mm )) 

395.94 402.18 A: you know i i've met martin lawrence before and i think you know he's got a a personality where he's just funny all the time 

403.05 404.13 B: (( oh i see )) 

405.14 407.19 B: yeah bill cosby was fun 

407.61 418.35 A: he was he was fun funny because he did he was a clean comic he didn't swear it was a family thing he made fun of his own family too he made fun of himself ah 

419.60 422.23 A: you know he didn't have to make fun of other people 

422.66 428.20 A: to like to make other people laugh because there was enough just going on on around him that was good 

428.26 430.91 A: um he didn't insult anybody 

431.44 432.40 A: um 

432.75 438.64 A: doh what was his name andrew a lot of people didn't like him because they said he was insulting i thought he was funny 

439.22 440.70 B: (( hm )) 

439.97 442.47 A: he was absolutely hilarious you know he you know 

442.86 445.68 A: he could have insulted me and i would have laughed 

448.11 452.26 A: because it's the way he throws the punch line that makes it funny even though it's a 

452.36 453.68 A: (( he might say )) 

452.68 455.83 B: hm so do you think women are more comical or men 

456.22 457.01 A: men 

457.92 459.58 B: yeah 

459.07 461.28 A: women are too worried about ah 

461.41 467.39 A: being dainty there are some women that don't care what they say but most of us have an image we don't want to be 

467.90 470.48 A: ah too raw i guess 'cause 

470.59 478.02 A: you know our our mothers are probably watching the show you know where guys can kind of come saying anything and they're not going to be called ah 

478.35 481.91 A: you know negative names or anything like that that women can 

483.84 486.56 A: but the i mean women are funny i would say they don't 

486.68 488.67 A: women aren't as insulting
