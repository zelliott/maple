3.64 6.08 A: ah my name's fanny hope [noise] 

5.64 7.26 B: hi nice to meet you 

6.87 8.05 A: likewise 

9.01 16.21 A: um i guess you heard the ah the the topic of the day um how do you draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable humor 

16.49 17.85 B: um well 

18.00 22.00 B: for for me it it just kinda depends on um 

22.98 27.95 B: acceptable behavior for me is um humor that has a good punch line 

28.31 31.04 B: but doesn't hurt people's feelings 

30.62 31.63 A: mhm 

31.53 34.82 B: um it's one that like 

35.29 42.02 B: [lipsmack] i don't agree with humor that has a lot of vulgarity in it ah as well as obscenities and ah 

38.60 39.73 A: mhm 

42.57 48.60 B: to me if it's good wholesome humor that's acceptable to me [laughter] how do yo- how do you feel [noise] 

45.90 47.29 A: right right 

48.10 52.98 A: um pretty much along the s- it's the same lines principle wise um 

52.87 54.01 A: (( i )) 

53.89 67.88 A: [mn] um i often feel out of step with ah a lot of humor that's on say you know television or something these days um it- i mean it s- it seems to be pretty common these days but it wasn't what ah i was brought up with 

67.97 82.00 A: um but i mean i i know that even if you don't count vulgarity a lot of people make jokes at the expense of people that they're talking to you know or they're in the room or something you know and especially this happens in families and i 

76.84 77.74 B: right 

81.38 82.25 B: right 

82.11 96.72 A: just don't don't think that's right um you know i mean a certain a certain amount of of sort of affectionate teasing can go on among families or friends or co workers but a lot of people i think will will use humor as a cover to say something mean 

84.75 85.84 B: i don't mean a 

96.61 104.71 A: and then you know say hey can't you take a joke you know and and what are you supposed to say no i mean no one's going to say that 

102.38 103.73 B: right be- 

104.79 106.00 B: because i 

106.02 107.25 B: oh i'm sorry 

106.91 108.10 A: go ahead 

107.86 115.17 B: oh okay um i i was just going to say because some humor some humor if it is taken in such a um 

115.27 119.45 B: drastic like if it's taken in a wrong direction um 

118.20 119.10 A: mhm 

119.49 125.28 B: the humor or the words that make up the humor from the giver um 

124.00 124.92 A: (( mhm )) 

125.32 132.05 B: could cause a seri- ac- serious actions um and and we do see this like um 

131.89 140.70 B: so many countless times where a joke been made been made and fights have broken out or riots have broken out over 

139.85 147.26 A: or or you mean like a politician saying oh ah i didn't realize what i said was offensive if anyone was offended 

145.62 151.21 B: exactly right exactly because i think i think it becomes unaccepta- 

151.23 153.39 B: -acceptable humor when 

153.75 165.24 B: someone has been offended um and and that's something that i think stand up comedians um sitcom comedians or or just you know just to make a joke in general i think if it's 

155.48 156.56 A: right 

165.83 173.81 B: if it's if you if you have any second doubts in your mind when you tell a joke or you think something's gonna be funny when you say it 

173.38 174.45 A: mhm 

173.79 177.58 B: the i think it's better left unsaid um 

176.06 177.40 A: right 

177.47 188.83 B: because there is an element of words um and and i think that people cross the line and i think celebrities do that a lot too um but you know ah [mn] 

186.27 187.67 A: mhm 

189.24 198.28 B: the only thing that's different is the media puts them up on the pedestal so you know everything that they say is is in the spotlight so um 

192.83 194.77 A: yeah 

197.35 198.39 A: right 

198.81 199.85 B: (( [mn] but )) 

200.12 213.57 B: i will say the kind of humor that i do like is um i like humor that is extremely unrealistic like um putting people in a situation like on a crowded bus and and someone 

206.72 207.78 A: mhm 

211.10 212.02 A: uh-huh 

213.63 224.43 B: you know lets wind and someone just over exaggerates about where the smell's coming from and this is used many times as an improvisational exercise 

219.91 220.92 A: uh-huh 

223.87 225.72 A: yeah 

224.35 233.79 B: and and people just you know take a s- a natural phenomenon that happens to everybody and just overly like 

230.11 231.12 A: mhm 

233.95 242.43 B: i don't know overly um exaggerate it i think that can be funny i think when someone like trips over a chair 

236.76 237.93 A: mhm 

241.75 242.84 A: mhm 

242.24 249.12 B: and you know like not only trips over their chair but does a flip and all this kind of stuff and they're really like 

247.53 248.34 A: mhm 

249.11 259.47 B: living it up that they've tripped over this over the chair and the want the whole world to trip ov- ah know that they tripped over it i mean i think that can be funny [noise] and just the [mn] 

251.78 252.67 A: mhm 

255.10 258.16 A: yeah 

258.18 262.47 A: oh sure physical humor is one of the you know the oldest types of humor 

262.53 264.01 B: i mean look at 

262.88 264.66 A: always a classic 

263.92 278.26 B: right and and you said you know you were brought up with different kind of humor well i do love the classics and i i used i mean i still do i like like the i love lucy and the golden girls and and i mean back when humor 

274.06 275.00 A: mhm 

278.32 285.24 B: like they didn't have to put a four letter word in everything just to [laughter] just to make it funny i mean lucy did some of the most 

281.07 282.25 A: right 

283.37 284.47 A: right 

285.63 292.46 B: awesome things with comedy and it was just it was just wh- wholesome and it wasn't like 

292.85 298.76 B: you know she wasn't she wasn't flaunting her body she wasn't you know like 

298.95 304.53 B: degrading anybody i mean she was making fun of herself and i think that's funny i think 

302.67 303.64 A: (( uh-huh )) 

303.70 305.05 A: oh yeah 

304.66 312.17 B: i think that's incredibly funny if you can learn to laugh at yourself then you know the whole world laughs with you instead of at you 

306.39 309.51 A: oh yeah mhm 

311.80 325.61 A: oh yeah i mean lucille ball was one of the greatest comedians in the world um i mean i'm not about to say that you know all humor has to be g. rated um yeah you know i mean i've i've i've been known occasionally to you know to laugh at dirty 

312.18 313.11 B: so 

318.89 322.47 B: [noise] no i'm not saying that either but but if [noise] 

323.74 327.46 B: [noise] i'm sorry i'm i'm still here [laughter] 

325.90 333.19 A: j- oh okay i've i've been known occasionally to you know to laugh at at at dirty jokes and tell one or two myself but 

331.30 332.00 B: (( [noise] )) 

333.27 338.74 A: um you know it's it's just such an idiosyncratic thing how people are going to react i mean [mn] 

338.85 349.36 A: you know it's i mean a lot of jokes are based on the assumptions that you know this is the way men are this is the way women are this is the way different ethnic groups are i mean there's a reason that 

345.77 346.72 B: right 

349.26 357.74 A: a lot of humor is based on race and ethnicity and stuff i mean you know it- it- it's a it's big material especially for a lot of black comedians 

353.44 354.33 B: right 

357.87 360.78 A: and it- it's because you know i mean 

360.84 367.82 A: to the extent that any of that stuff is justifiable it's 'cause humor can be a way to illustrate 

367.65 377.76 A: and you know either to try and satirize the you know the bad stuff out of existence or you know kind of reconcile us to the stuff that that we can't change you know 

371.50 372.41 B: (( [noise] )) 

372.92 374.22 B: right 

377.33 378.92 B: right exactly 

377.54 391.85 A: aren't men wacky and aren't women wacky and aren't all these other people wacky that that we're living with or ah you know aren't our own you know in group ways [mn] you know an odd funny thing um you know i mean i i i think 

391.83 397.72 A: politicians and most of us you know in the business world and stuff have generally gotten into their heads that 

397.83 405.93 A: you know like racial jokes about other people are just not okay but you know i mean i've sometimes heard people be 

403.25 404.23 B: right 

406.19 410.78 A: funny because they were being insightful 

410.81 425.32 A: in terms of of jokes that are about um you know i mean i- it's generally easier to tell if it's about your own you know a group you belong to whether you're a woman or a man or you're black or you're jewish or you're you're japanese or whatever um 

418.76 419.67 B: right 

421.12 421.96 B: (( right )) 

424.29 425.12 B: right 

425.42 429.72 A: you know i mean th- th- th- the reason why people laugh at those things 

429.93 437.83 A: you know that's that's not you know some- i mean that's something that everyone can laugh at is that that it has got kind of a nugget of truth there 

434.91 435.79 B: right 

437.66 445.48 B: well you know what i think is so um the thing that i like so much about um certain comedians is um 

445.28 455.71 B: well i'll take example margaret cho i mean she does a- she does a lot of things that are vulgar but when she when she makes asian jokes or whatever i laugh at those 

449.89 451.20 A: mhm 

455.75 464.26 B: not because i'm prejudice against asians but because she's an asian making fun of asians you know i mean it's 

457.97 459.12 A: right 

462.11 470.17 A: yeah and and and it's not just you know like koreans are dumb or something i mean she's she's she's telling a joke in a way that gives some insight into 

466.08 467.60 B: (( r- r- )) 

468.78 475.55 B: to illustrate the s- right she does it to illustrate the stupidity of those stereotypes and i think i mean 

473.78 481.99 A: yeah or or to say or to give you an idea of like what it's like to be korean or you know i mean like my big fat greek wedding i don't know if you saw it recently i thought 

478.09 479.40 B: exactly 

480.81 481.84 B: (( mhm )) 

481.81 489.90 A: some of ah the humor was kind of lame um on the other hand one of my best friends from childhood is greek american and 

482.05 482.95 B: (( i did )) 

490.00 496.67 A: a lot of the time i was just kind of like tickled watching that movie 'cause like so many of the details were so accurate 

496.50 497.66 B: (( exactly [mn] )) 

496.54 509.87 A: and you know i mean if you didn't necessarily growing someone greek growing up you wouldn't necessarily know but it could give you an idea of you know what you know s- sort of like one thread in the fabric of america you know [mn] 

500.07 501.18 B: right 

502.13 503.08 B: right 

503.71 504.57 B: uh-huh 

508.59 509.85 B: right because it 

510.17 524.48 B: i- i'm so- i i was just going to say i- it draws you into their world you know it's not it's not like an outside force like you know like sometimes when white comedians make fun of black people or when black peop- black comedians make fun of whi- 

511.01 512.37 A: no go ahead 

514.04 515.56 A: yeah exactly 

521.21 522.09 A: yeah 

523.03 526.42 A: (( they're not they- they're not speaking from a position of knowledge about )) 

525.98 528.91 B: right and and to me [mn] that 

528.50 532.89 A: (( it )) 

528.97 537.83 B: that's an injustice because [noise] in a i mean if you are black you have the right to make jokes about black people because that's what you know 

537.33 538.51 A: right 

537.81 547.61 B: i mean that's your frame of reference you know and you have i mean it's just like i'm white and i can talk about all the hillbillies and all the rednecks and and 

539.61 540.89 A: right 

545.54 547.55 A: mhm 

547.64 550.28 B: like [mn] people that just have no commonsense of 

548.36 554.56 A: yeah or or my family's from new england and i can talk about how you know sort of uptight and repressed we all are 

553.26 566.68 B: right and to me that's acceptable because i'm white like i can make fun of white people because i'm white i mean [mn] they're not gonna call me a racist or whatever because i'm making fun of white people you know [noise] 

556.64 558.22 A: yeah exactly 

563.20 565.03 A: (( yeah )) 

565.03 572.03 A: well i- you know or talk about whatever you know the the customs and habits are of where you come from 

571.81 581.59 A: that if anyone else is i mean i i only pick up on the term hillbillies 'cause you used it and also you sound like from your accent like you're from ah the south or appalachia maybe 

571.89 573.22 B: exactly 

576.47 577.65 B: [laughter] oh yeah 

580.99 591.12 B: well ah i was raised in wisconsin um and i i spent the last ten years in texas so um so my accent 

588.39 589.58 A: oh okay 

590.18 592.33 A: so kinda splitting the difference then 

592.10 597.78 B: [laughter] yeah um and and it's ah it's real interesting but ah i've liv- 

595.89 597.95 A: yeah you know or like you're 

598.20 599.52 A: go ahead 

599.08 599.89 B: (( i i was ju- ))
