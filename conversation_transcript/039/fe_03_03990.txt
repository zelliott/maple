52.14 53.63 A: yeah 

52.74 54.38 B: uh it takes me 

54.53 57.01 B: some time to process it [laughter] 

56.03 60.75 A: [laughter] yeah sometimes it's slow yeah sometimes it can be a little like over the [noise] head 

57.35 58.36 B: (( [laughter] )) 

60.56 61.66 B: (( uh-huh ha )) 

61.29 62.40 A: (( but um )) 

62.83 65.66 A: uh yeah i really enjoy you know doing just 

65.67 72.51 A: seeing something that's really humorous and makes me laugh it's like trying to [mn] brings out or sorts of emotions 

70.11 70.98 B: uh-huh 

72.38 73.31 B: right 

72.80 85.13 A: [lipsmack] er and actually it's funny 'cause the the the topic was you kn- er what we're supposed to talk about is when it's when it goes a little too far and it's in bad taste and it's like er for me it's always easy to say oh you know that's 

85.09 89.45 A: that was totally uncalled for and that's bad taste but in saying that sometimes it's actually funnier that way it's 

89.21 90.19 B: yeah 

90.10 95.24 A: horrible because it like brings you out laughing when you know it's like i don't know like [mn] 

95.72 104.03 B: [laughter] that's that's the thing i mean you know you can have all kinds of um you know discriminating jokes that make you laugh for some reason but 

95.73 98.22 A: (( [laughter] you definitely [laughter] [laughter] need a good sense of humor )) 

100.45 101.18 A: (( [laughter] [cough] )) 

103.43 104.81 A: mhm 

104.16 108.00 B: once you think about them they they really are discriminating [laughter] 

107.27 109.87 A: yeah and they can be offensive but like you know 

109.00 111.16 B: they are offensive yeah 

110.58 124.60 A: and to me it's almost like i recognize that they're offensive but i don't take it personally but i'm like oh well that's a really offensive joke and i can see how other people would get hurt by it but usually i don't really take offense to it personally 'cause i know they're just doing it for you know good humor and i think it's 

118.46 119.36 B: right 

123.74 129.71 B: right right yeah that that's what i i agree that you know jokes have to be jokes and 

124.90 125.61 A: [laughter] 

129.25 130.45 A: mhm 

129.82 133.13 B: uh whether you know we should not take them personally 

133.05 134.51 A: yeah 

133.54 135.47 B: (( and if you er you know )) 

135.89 142.53 B: yeah and and it's true i mean if you think of them they [laughter] they can be very [laughter] offensive [laughter] [laughter] especially stand up comedy [noise] 

140.37 147.46 A: they really can and for some it's horrible that they actually sometimes they're not being funny in that way just the other night i was watching uh um [lipsmack] 

147.48 149.43 A: uh dennis miller like 

149.55 158.55 A: stand up thing with my boyfriend and er i mean and some of it was just so it was like you know that's just horrible that he's saying it but at the same time it really did make it funnier in some ways 

158.14 159.10 B: yeah 

159.17 159.99 A: um 

159.92 165.51 B: yeah they do have to pull to pull on the on the audience when they do er when they do the stand ups it's 

165.58 176.23 B: it can be very offensive especially when they start pointing at people and [laughter] you don't [laughter] even know [laughter] mm but then again like you said you know you have to you have to keep it away from being personal so 

169.04 170.84 A: (( [lipsmack] oh yeah )) 

176.29 183.39 A: right and then i guess a lot of it in comedy is just eh that's what it is it's just taking things like every day things and kind of 

177.07 177.75 B: (( hm hm )) 

183.81 189.37 A: and and different types of people and you have to you know categorize and stereotype to make something even funny you know 

189.05 191.28 B: mhm right right yeah 

190.34 192.46 A: (( no and well we're living it and so you don't have to but [noise] )) 

192.60 195.93 B: i think stereotype is a bit way too off comedy [laughter] 

195.24 197.59 A: uh-huh yeah hm 

196.88 197.76 B: yeah 

197.89 199.82 B: but i mean i i guess [noise] 

200.71 204.66 B: to me drawing the line would be really awful um 

205.03 206.04 B: um 

206.24 208.04 B: (( dirty jokes you know [laughter] )) 

207.95 209.10 A: yeah huh 

208.29 210.52 B: i think that would be to me would be the 

210.66 212.06 B: the draw line 

211.86 214.53 A: [laughter] yeah i know 

212.47 215.36 B: oh you know [laughter] [laughter] 

214.61 217.95 A: (( yeah 'cause after a while you get to the point where you don't even want to hear it you know )) 

217.36 224.13 B: yeah exactly i mean at that point it's like well you know you don't have anything er to offer me no more laughs [laughter] 

222.76 224.21 A: yeah 

224.44 225.67 B: but um 

225.89 227.86 B: [lipsmack] i don't know i can't 

228.40 230.25 B: you know i can't imagine 

230.89 232.65 B: yeah discriminating and 

232.77 236.51 B: i i laugh about it but you know so i i don't know 

236.99 238.39 A: (( [laughter] )) 

236.99 244.22 B: [lipsmack] it it's h- it's hard [laughter] it's hard to put up the pinpoint uh a 

244.59 246.11 B: you know a line 

246.14 250.94 A: right and sometimes [noise] if you're used to like humor like i have um 

250.96 259.63 A: actually my family they they they have a website where they run like politically correct jokes and they're really not that [noise] funny sometimes [laughter] you know like you're almost like 

255.88 256.73 B: (( uh-huh [laughter] )) 

259.75 262.91 A: they can be but they k- they kind of draw on the same 

263.08 264.42 A: um like 

264.47 267.98 A: the same kind of um char- like stereotypes 

267.65 268.49 B: uh-huh 

267.99 278.47 A: but instead of you know using a certain race or certain class of people they just like go g- make it generic so that it's not actually offending any one group of people 

278.16 279.24 B: yeah 

278.85 282.92 A: they'll like make up you know it's the people from like antarctica or something 

282.70 283.57 B: right 

282.95 286.45 A: and we'll use them in the joke 'cause there are no people from antarctica so it's like 

286.55 287.36 B: uh-huh 

286.64 297.01 A: [noise] that kind of thing but they're using the same kind of stereotypes but de- de-categorizing them i guess from any one specific group of people to make them funny so here is where you have to like 

296.87 303.94 A: give a group or you know a specific group of people fault and make fun of it and that's kind of where it draws it's humor whether 

299.06 299.97 B: yeah 

303.66 304.51 B: right 

305.75 313.03 A: to really not be offensive about it is just you know make that [noise] whatever group of people you're categorizing like that like unclear i guess [laughter] 

312.35 313.96 B: (( yeah hm )) 

313.12 314.97 A: [noise] so 

315.11 315.78 B: hm 

315.12 315.73 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

316.18 321.47 B: well the the other the other kind of jokes i i kind of like is the is the not 

321.50 325.03 B: um humor is the plain words you know [noise] 

324.73 326.31 A: mhm yeah 

325.64 327.68 B: or if you just um 

328.78 329.67 B: (( [mn] [noise] you know )) 

330.43 336.15 B: first posing syllables and stuff like that to give different different um words different meanings and and 

333.34 334.32 A: mhm 

336.52 338.60 B: stuff like that that's what i like [mn] 

338.31 344.68 A: [noise] yeah just yeah comedy that's a little bit more clever and yeah that can be [noise] really enjoyable too 

341.21 342.89 B: mhm 

344.76 345.93 B: (( [noise] and funny )) 

345.28 346.13 A: mhm 

346.43 347.43 A: (( [mn] [lipsmack] )) 

347.50 348.46 B: i think it's 

347.76 349.22 A: (( and where do )) 

349.32 357.29 B: hard to pull on that humor [laughter] because it's a little harder to [noise] produce i think and to make people understand it like in the flesh 

351.54 352.29 A: yeah 

357.47 358.78 A: mhm 

358.13 358.91 B: (( so )) 

360.27 361.17 B: yeah 

360.32 362.13 A: yeah whoever's 

362.15 372.10 A: up there giving the comedy whether it's stand up or someone writing it i mean they really do have to be clever to make something really educatable because sometimes it just comes out really cheesy i feel like most of the comedy or 

368.27 369.28 B: mhm 

372.29 374.38 A: that's intended to be humorous is 

374.07 374.87 B: right 

374.84 379.62 A: it's just horrible [laughter] like when they try it's like you can tell that they're trying too hard or like 

376.01 377.55 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

379.05 380.59 B: [cough] right [noise] 

380.80 382.22 A: and and also 

381.32 385.09 B: yeah they're trying too hard and they can't make it [laughter] 

384.55 388.91 A: yeah and then you're just like uh i mean it's not even that it's in bad taste it's just bad 

388.56 389.44 B: uh-huh 

389.61 396.93 A: and like in t._v. sitcoms is one of my pet peas is how they actually throw the laughs in for you like you're obviously watching at home and it's not 

396.92 397.72 B: (( mhm mm )) 

397.07 403.75 A: and most of them aren't taped in front of a live audience any more but they still put the laughs in there for you just to like oh remind you you're supposed to laugh here 

403.97 410.71 A: mm but uh it kind of bothers me it's like uh this is not funny you know when i saw it that cue doesn't really help 

404.33 405.35 B: right 

407.94 408.84 B: yeah 

410.49 418.30 B: [laughter] yeah er i think and also it's a little synergy if you are actually watching it in a club 

411.38 412.39 A: [laughter] 

418.47 425.58 B: where everybody's actually laughing whether you like like it or not you end up laughing but it's a part of synergy i think 

423.12 424.55 A: (( right )) 

425.48 435.09 A: yah yeah and i think they try to do that like with the t._v. sitcoms but i don't know if it really works 'cause you're totally so removed from it when you're like in your house i mean you just 

425.99 426.63 B: (( hm )) 

429.85 430.67 B: uh-huh 

433.13 434.00 B: right 

435.11 440.53 A: i- if you actually pay attention to it that laugh comes on like every ten seconds on any like sitcom show 

440.33 441.63 B: yeah [laughter] 

441.15 445.91 A: there's a kind of comedy one and i says once i notice it's there it sort of shocked me [laughter] 

445.59 452.59 B: [laughter] yeah they always have to have the lights applause now [laughter] [laughter] 

450.07 452.00 A: yeah exactly you're like 

452.73 462.74 B: [laughter] laugh now cry now [laughter] i think th- [laughter] there's a good humor you know they should make a show about that [laughter] 

461.96 462.57 A: (( oof )) 

463.04 470.54 B: [laughter] the audience and how they react to the light [laughter] are they actually watching the show or are they waiting for the lights to 

463.21 463.83 A: (( [laughter] )) 

470.19 472.38 A: another reality t._v. show 

471.68 472.49 B: [laughter] 

472.61 475.57 B: (( [laughter] )) 

472.79 473.68 A: [laughter] 

475.00 478.41 A: behind the scenes reality t._v. in the audience [mn] 

477.90 487.32 B: yeah [laughter] and the audience will be the show that'll be a good one [laughter] [noise] anyway well i don't know what else to tell you about [laughter] you know [laughter] 

483.25 483.93 A: (( hm )) 

486.93 492.03 A: yeah i'm just trying to think of like er things that relate to being in bad taste and i mean [noise] 

491.84 492.77 B: mhm 

492.20 496.24 A: [lipsmack] there's a lot of it out there it's really easy to be offensive in any way but 

496.67 497.69 B: (( [noise] mm uh )) 

497.09 497.88 A: (( um )) 

498.42 507.60 A: [lipsmack] i do feel like there's so much of it that happens in our in our society that like is offe- like offensive things that don't have to do have anything to do with comedy that it kind of er like 

498.51 499.27 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

508.17 520.06 A: way down but for some reason when someone just you know blatantly talking about it and actually poking fun at the idea and you know basically satirizing our society people get so offended by it and well you know what 

514.28 515.04 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

520.22 523.10 A: uh that's just comedy it's just there f- for like 

522.21 523.01 B: right 

523.56 530.02 A: that's what it's there for just to laugh and in a lot of ways it can bring a lot of issues up that people avoid otherwise [lipsmack] 

525.98 526.80 B: mhm 

529.28 542.28 B: right [noise] yeah uh er you know ev- every group is going to have jokes at one time or another you know you can make polish jokes but then you go to poland and you have jokes about some- somebody else you know [laughter] 

536.30 537.53 A: mhm 

541.85 543.21 A: exactly yeah 

542.70 555.89 B: or [laughter] the polish groups says uh you know jokes about americans who knows you know [laughter] and [lipsmack] and so that that's that's how it is i mean y- y- you pick whatever stereotype that that everybody in your society knows 

546.59 548.43 A: (( exactly yeah even that )) 

555.80 558.02 B: more about 

555.90 556.65 A: (( [lipsmack] mm )) 

558.04 559.43 B: and you use that 

559.32 560.58 A: (( right mm )) 

559.75 561.53 B: and that's pretty much 

561.81 564.92 B: what happens and [mn] you know i 

564.95 565.87 B: um 

566.01 578.08 B: i i i'm from portugal and we um portugal used to have colonies in africa until nineteen seventy five in seventy five they became independent and uh 

578.33 584.19 B: after that the jokes all became about the new presence of the colonies 

584.26 586.38 A: mhm [laughter] 

585.19 590.22 B: because everybody was mad that they [laughter] that the people that lived there had to leave 

587.20 588.55 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

590.00 590.94 A: mhm 

590.25 595.83 B: and so they were mad about having to er to to leave all their their things behind and leave hm 

595.97 599.89 B: and so their retaliation was let's pick on these
