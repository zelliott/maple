42.76 44.55 A: so it's about humor [mn] 

44.05 49.52 B: it [mn] from my understanding it's where do you draw the line between tasteful comedy and 

49.63 52.11 B: you know humor that's in poor taste

107.97 109.38 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

120.24 132.79 B: and the whole joke the entire show was that the aids he meant like a. i. d. e. s. like helpers he had these he had like a personal trainer and a nutritionist and stuff and he kept going around saying 

120.35 120.91 A: (( [mn] )) 

127.65 128.57 A: mhm 

133.01 141.07 B: everyone should get aids and i gave my girlfriend aids and you know we want to have kids with aids and my friend is has always been [mn] you know she

141.28 149.12 B: always works in like she since high school has volunteered for that's her cause you know so we're doing the aids walk and she you know talks 

149.38 158.05 B: to you know educating people about aids and she was just so offended by this and so offended that i found it funny but you know it's kind of like 

158.60 159.59 B: (( [mn] i )) 

160.30 170.84 B: i'm not exactly offended by any of that you know and it is it was kind of funny and the show was funny but i can see why people but i just i i can't take any of that too seriously she was saying that um 

170.76 176.57 B: little kids would watch it and laugh at it and think that aids is a joke and whatever but it's not meant for kids 

176.55 177.39 A: right 

176.69 183.04 B: you know you assume that people that watch these things are intelligent enough to know that you know a. that it's not a joke but you know 

183.41 184.32 B: (( i don't know )) 

184.72 186.29 B: what do you think would that offend you 

186.23 188.54 A: oh no it doesn't no- not too much 

188.60 191.88 A: stuff like that offends me [mn] because you know there's so much 

189.71 190.94 B: [laughter] 

191.91 206.51 A: like i said you know a lot a lot of these movies on right now are they're so stupid [mn] that that's what you know where you get the comedy out of it like a lot of stuff that jim carrey does i mean just stupid [laughter] um 

197.36 199.03 B: [laughter] 

200.76 201.82 B: yeah 

202.84 204.05 B: mhm 

207.11 211.91 B: yeah i don't know like i just i i don't think that 

211.95 224.80 B: hearing stuff or talking about aids in that manner is going to have as much effect as having jackass and stuff that's gonna make people go out and hurt themselves it was on the news yesterday they had um 

222.33 223.36 A: yeah 

224.84 234.08 B: these kids that were imitating jackass they jumped off a five storey building and one of them shattered into into a swimming pool but one of them hit the side 

227.07 227.99 A: mhm 

229.37 230.40 A: oh 

233.71 234.56 A: (( no [mn] )) 

233.98 241.20 B: of the swimming pool and shattered his leg and i mean that's been going on for ever you know all these stupid shows and don't try this at home and blah blah blah but if it's 

240.05 241.03 A: yeah 

241.47 246.17 B: if it's actual spoken comedy i don't know how bad that can really be 

246.40 249.68 B: it's just when these kids go out and you know try to recreate jackass [mn] 

249.59 250.73 A: (( [mn] right )) 

250.99 252.05 B: but even that 

251.05 256.76 A: and th- and then they're they'll sit there at the end of movies and say don't ever try to do this 

256.24 257.71 B: [laughter] exactly 

256.79 262.95 A: you know like jackie chan they go through all this stuff that he does and then at the end he'll say well don't ever try to do this at home 

258.15 259.65 B: [laughter] exactly 

263.06 265.53 A: like they're going to listen to him you know 

264.14 268.46 B: well right then i mean stupid people will do these stupid things whether or not they see it on t._v. 

268.46 269.47 A: (( right [mn] )) 

268.67 276.35 B: i mean i'm sure it doesn't help to see these things but i don't know i don't know if if if you you need to get rid of it altogether just because a couple of kids were dumb 

277.25 278.13 B: [sigh] 

277.61 279.29 A: (( right well i'm just )) 

279.44 292.95 A: um that's what i mean like you know people are going to um do what they're gonna do anyway and i'll think t._v. you know [mn] they might can say influences you but if it wasn't in you to go along with it anyway you know 

284.30 285.21 B: mhm 

293.07 301.97 A: it's just the kind of character that person is y- you know some people are going to go along with it whether they've ever seen it or not they're gonna or some way or another they're gonna find a way to do [mn] you know 

295.24 296.49 B: (( and yeah )) 

301.20 305.66 B: exactly and i mean the in terms of humor like 

305.55 319.82 B: if i find south park and the simpsons stuff like that they're really really intelligent shows i really really believe and i'm not harping on the south park thing but i just think it's like a good example of it because it's really funny but it's really offensive to a lot of people 

319.38 323.00 A: yeah yeah well i mean [mn] even like the simpsons you know it's like 

319.97 320.92 B: but i 

323.11 324.84 A: it's like people um 

325.13 330.88 A: i think they're funny i don't find them offensive at all and it's just a lot of common sense you know 

327.48 328.40 B: yeah 

329.64 332.33 B: right and it's just it's just a lot of it is 

332.25 334.69 B: so smart too their humor 

334.59 337.51 B: it's like it's not just you know 

334.70 335.47 A: well 

337.34 344.13 B: fart jokes and toilet humor or whatever a lo- lot of it is like this wednesday they had one of the characters on south m- 

343.93 353.09 B: sou- south park cartman just farting in one of the other guy's face for like five minutes [mn] but the rest of it it was smart the sh- show was about they had did you see it this wednesday 

346.42 348.28 A: oh yeah [laughter] 

352.99 354.60 A: no i didn't see it 

354.50 355.76 B: see i could take 

354.61 356.76 A: i'm so busy all the time [laughter] 

356.10 368.36 B: i could take up this whole ten minutes telling you about south park so but it's it was um [lipsmack] they had aliens come in it was like a throwback to another episode that they had done with aliens in it and it turned out that the aliens were 

368.49 371.95 B: had planted these anal probes in all these people 

371.43 372.63 A: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

371.84 378.38 B: so that they could have satellite dishes because it turned out that earth was a reality show in like the galaxy 

378.10 378.96 A: mhm 

378.25 387.22 B: and they had brought together you know the like and asians and jews and deer all on the same planet and they were they keep fighting and look at these wars and blah blah blah so 

387.26 396.42 B: i don't know so half of it was c- cartman he had the anal probe in his butt and was farting in the other kid's face so i mean half of it [lipsmack] is 

391.66 392.29 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

393.64 394.63 A: [laughter] 

396.50 403.24 B: stupid fart jokes but at the at the same time like it's a funny concept to think that you know earth is so screwed up because 

403.24 412.20 B: aliens put us all together so that they could have a reality t._v. show like the real world you know so i think it's worth something it's not like it's just stupid and you know offensive 

405.89 408.51 A: oh yeah [laughter] yeah 

410.92 416.73 A: well i think you could even go like all the way back to you know all in the family and archie bunker 

416.23 418.22 B: yeah exactly 

416.88 429.86 A: i mean i mean a lot of people got offended with that now i i thought it was funny i i loved it and the thing of it is is i think a lot of people coulda learned from the comedy of it you know they th- they showed the ignorance of man 

419.71 420.73 B: mhm 

426.39 427.60 B: that's right 

429.45 430.66 B: right 

430.03 431.52 A: and um th- 

431.94 437.07 A: they did it with hu- they used humor to show the ignorance so maybe people could understand more 

436.69 438.10 B: (( right )) 

437.17 440.80 A: and bring out what s- what might be up inside of them you know 

440.06 454.66 B: right and it it was never you never thought that the people that wrote the show were archie bunker you never thought the people were really that bigoted and you know like racist and all the rest of it but by watching it you it just shows you you know how stupid it is to be like him 

444.66 445.57 A: right 

448.14 449.93 A: right yeah 

454.36 455.87 A: mhm right 

454.97 460.88 B: so i mean there's you know i d- i don't think you can draw the line at just it being offensive that's it there should be no archie bunker 

460.58 469.46 A: i think it yeah right and it it if anything it exposes y- you know all the stupidity and you know the ignorance and i think that's good 

466.16 467.95 B: (( and even yeah )) 

469.00 470.08 B: mhm 

469.66 480.84 A: you know um same thing with the jeffersons you know it exposes a lot of stupidity a lot of racism and i think that's good i think you know 'cause there's so many people that are so ignorant 

472.53 473.56 B: yeah 

480.37 481.48 B: mhm 

480.85 487.59 A: that using humor to expose it might help them understand you know might help them to come out of it 

485.88 486.71 B: yeah 

487.17 494.53 B: and there's less of that today too i think i think people are almost more scared now than they were back then to make shows like that 

494.36 495.24 A: right 

495.14 504.79 B: i mean there's a different kind of like offensive stuff going around now but in terms of that where you can actually learn something but then i i mean i can't really think of m- many modern day examples of that kind of thing 

504.64 505.72 A: right 

505.63 507.25 B: which is i don't know 

505.80 509.15 A: [mn] i know you don't you really don't see it too much um 

508.34 513.22 B: i mean now it's all like friends which is a good show and i like it but i mean you know 

511.19 512.18 A: yeah 

512.55 514.73 A: what about married with children [laughter] 

514.05 521.53 B: yeah th- th- i mean that that too it's the same kind of thing but but that hasn't been around for a long time they've been off the air for what like ten years or something 

520.97 522.89 A: yeah that's true 

521.57 529.76 B: it's like now i i mean i keep talking about south park but that's a different kind of thing i mean in terms of these things were on the networks 

529.69 530.47 A: (( mhm mm )) 

529.96 533.81 B: i i don't know that there's much of that around now it's all kind of like 

533.92 540.21 B: i mean will and grace i guess is sort of i mean but it's not offensive it's just you know that they 

538.16 539.23 A: right 

540.37 542.38 B: are you know breaking 

542.39 545.17 B: certain norms by having gay characters 

544.95 545.93 A: mhm 

545.27 551.50 B: and it's funny but i don't think it's as outwardly offensive as you know the jeffersons or 

546.53 547.35 A: yeah 

551.29 552.30 A: right 

551.66 556.00 B: (( all in the family i don't think there's as much of that around any more i'm trying to think of an example )) 

554.22 567.59 A: i mean even even um rugrats [laughter] you know [mn] i mean i think they're still playing that but ah i mean even that you know they they um take their experiences with their own real children and use it in there 

557.30 558.49 B: [laughter] 

559.81 560.90 B: yeah 

567.41 568.64 B: oh yeah 

568.03 569.52 A: yeah 

568.90 574.03 B: i like that show it's cute it's for kids but i mean like adults can watch it too you know 

569.84 571.09 A: yeah i do too 

573.75 583.74 A: yeah and and you know there's a lot of stuff in there too even you know that i i think there's a lot of people that think that it's terrible for their kids to watch something like that and i think it's really cute 

581.71 582.67 B: really 

582.90 585.54 B: it's adorable i love that show 

584.86 591.81 A: yeah and it's funny you know and and um and they and they use really real life experiences from their own kids 

591.21 592.23 B: mhm 

592.24 595.28 A: so [laughter] i think there's a lot you know 

595.35 599.89 A: using humor for that i like i said i can i think you can learn a lot from
