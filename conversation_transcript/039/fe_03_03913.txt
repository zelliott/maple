0.63 2.36 A: (( hi how are you doing )) 

1.86 3.87 B: oh good this is rick 

3.84 5.61 A: oh i'm dean how are you doing 

5.53 6.64 B: (( good dean )) 

6.31 7.69 A: (( all right )) 

7.10 8.62 B: where are you calling from 

8.18 9.51 A: i'm in new jersey 

9.48 11.35 B: i'm in atlanta georgia 

11.31 13.84 A: oh right 

13.26 16.61 B: so i might have a little accent [laughter] 

15.01 18.58 A: okay oh well i may have an accent to you then also i guess 

17.71 18.45 B: (( yes )) 

18.65 19.59 B: yeah 

19.89 21.15 B: that's okay 

21.49 29.62 B: so i guess the topic was how do you draw the line between um humor and i guess ah off color or indecent humor or something [mn] 

29.27 33.14 A: yeah w- when it's gone too far i guess when the humor's not 

32.57 33.64 B: yeah 

34.41 35.94 A: (( i don't know how do you ah )) 

35.72 48.22 B: i i i don't know i think it kind of varies by the audience you know i think like um it would depend on you have people in the group that um sensitive to certain topics you know 

47.89 53.93 A: yeah d- i guess it depends who the comedian is and and you know like you say the audience and how they ah view the humor 

48.34 49.11 B: like 

54.44 66.69 B: yeah it it seems like ah one thing happens in a lot of these comedy clubs is ah alcohol seems to make everything acceptable [laughter] once once everybody's had a few drinks they pretty much open up to most anything 

62.42 63.84 A: yeah sometimes 

66.88 80.49 A: well i've also seen too if you watch some ah ah in my area they have a black entertainment channel where i mean if i turn that on myself they're always talking about white people and me myself i'm a caucasian gentleman so i take a lot of offence to that 

72.33 73.36 B: yeah 

77.90 78.90 B: yeah 

79.88 87.46 B: yeah i'd i i agree with that that's that goes back to the i guess the the audience that you have you know 

86.74 89.70 A: yeah well they you know obviously they have a black audience so 

87.48 88.26 B: (( like a )) 

90.01 93.30 A: you know they they go ahead and they can make the ah jokes about white people 

93.37 96.04 A: so ah racism i guess ah 

93.40 94.37 B: mhm 

96.37 98.92 A: that can cause a problem too depending on your audience 

98.82 101.82 B: yeah yeah i i i agree 

101.41 105.73 A: well any ah minority group for that matter or you know people who are talking ah 

106.09 109.13 A: um you know ah just women in general 

109.15 110.18 B: mhm 

109.45 115.12 A: if there was just bad jokes about women and there was a bunch of women in the audience they would take offence to that or ah 

114.36 115.37 B: yeah 

115.78 118.14 A: you know any any generalized ah 

118.40 119.61 A: group of people 

120.17 125.30 B: yeah and it seems like the line is being pushed out or blurred um 

125.33 131.16 B: there was a time when a lot of humor that's acceptable now was not even tolerated 

131.55 132.38 A: yeah 

131.82 142.24 B: you know it's like ah ah limits are being pushed i guess people become more and more i don't know if it's jaded or used to or more accepting ah in some ar- some 

142.66 146.91 B: areas or with certain type of humor that they wouldn't have put up with years ago 

146.60 148.68 A: yeah i i don't think that ah i 

148.76 154.69 A: don't think that they should accept that i i think you're right i think that they have ah probably i think crossed the line 

154.80 161.59 A: ah in humor i mean if you talk about stuff that like my my dad or you know my granddad talked about stuff ah 

162.00 176.19 A: we won't you know everybody takes a lot a lot of things lightly these days and you know the humor ah people talk about and people just blow it off and say yeah and they laugh and i mean if you even said some ah some of the humor that they come out with today and even just mention that 

165.88 166.86 B: mhm 

169.48 170.61 B: yeah 

175.96 177.99 A: you know in earlier days 

178.11 182.08 A: um [mn] man you might have got a butt whipping or something [laughter] 

182.00 185.33 B: well yeah i know i agree ah it seems like ah um 

185.67 190.87 B: it seems like it's a cheap laugh when a comedian uses an off color joke or um 

190.98 201.80 B: or says something ah you know dealing with sex it tends to be a un- people kind of laugh as k- almost like they're nervous you know it takes a lot more ah ah 

199.29 200.26 A: yeah 

201.80 208.89 B: i think skill to make an audience laugh without having to resort to the cheap ah you know the cheap laughs 

208.66 214.55 A: mm i agree and the cursing also i think is is gotten out of hand um with with the comedy 

209.51 210.92 B: like like 

214.49 215.53 B: mhm 

215.05 226.44 A: where ah you see the comedians on h._b._o. or movies you can rent or whatever a lot of them have a lot of curses in it i mean ah i'd rather watch a comedian who can make me laugh without without using a bunch of curse words 

220.14 220.96 B: yeah 

226.30 228.78 B: yeah like bill cosby or somebody like that 

227.75 237.55 A: yeah bill cosby i mean there there's a gentleman who's who's a great example of a i think a great comedian you know ah you know he's kids love him you know he's ah more geared towards a younger audience 

232.44 233.42 B: mhm 

237.83 250.22 A: and ah actually ah ah an older audience too for that matter because but he can make you laugh without using racism jokes or without cursing so much and even i've heard live recordings of of ah bill cosby ah 

251.10 255.07 A: and ah they you know without curses you know good clean jokes 

255.08 256.29 B: (( yeah )) 

255.24 259.09 A: and they they were funny i mean the humor was great one of the great comedians of all time 

257.80 258.58 B: yeah 

259.03 270.62 B: i think so i think anybody that's can can make a group of people laugh without um getting down to cursing or or vulgar type of um you know references 

270.65 276.19 B: i think that takes a lot more talent and it's easier for these guys breaking in just to go right for the cheap laughs 

275.88 277.47 A: yeah i agree 

277.34 278.42 B: and they do it 

280.23 289.02 B: so i mean i that's one of the reasons why i i used to like to go to comedy clubs but they've gotten so um ah crossed the line as you say that i don't 

289.35 291.56 B: care to go to them that much anymore 

291.60 300.98 A: yeah also i tell you what i don't ah really ah care for either is comedians if you go to a comedy club you see ah even if you haven't been to a comedy club yourself you could see it on t._v. on shows and stuff 

300.87 313.61 A: they ah they show you the comics actually do ah use participants just from the audience not even participants just picking them out and ah you know making fun of people whether it be their physical appearance or maybe um 

310.64 311.70 B: yeah 

314.01 319.94 A: someone they're with or you know they sometimes they could turn into a worth and materialistic thing where 

319.78 330.73 A: if they can't afford to wear nice clothes you know just stupid stuff like that and they ah you know they shouldn't make ah fun of that because i mean you have the whole place laughing at one guy or something i've seen that happen before and 

323.26 324.22 B: yeah 

330.13 331.62 B: yeah i have too 

331.52 332.78 A: yeah so that's 

331.76 346.51 B: like that like in atlanta here they have a a some ah gay clubs down here and and they will pull somebody out and say they're s- you know they'll use them as a as an example say of straight person and then they'll make they'll make them the butt of the jokes you know 

346.10 347.30 A: yeah 

346.72 350.61 B: and everybody laughing at them and do stupid things so 

350.62 352.24 B: i don't care for that 

352.21 363.42 A: yeah it's not good to take some ah an individual and make his ah you know hurt him emotionally you know what i mean to to just get a laugh at and it's like yeah you know maybe you should find a different line of work 

363.45 364.96 B: yeah yeah 

363.82 367.40 A: if you're going to be a comedian that you know gets your laughs at someone else's expense 

367.70 378.73 A: i mean he's there to somebody pays a bill to go in and see a comedian and ah you know he gets laughed at that's not supposed to be he's coming there to see good you know good jokes and he wants to laugh too he doesn't want to be made fun of 

367.79 368.60 B: yeah 

378.80 379.89 B: that's right 

379.92 380.77 A: you know 

380.56 386.43 B: that's right that's right that so i mean i think i think making a a joke where you make fun of somebody's ah 

381.21 382.01 A: yeah 

386.47 394.08 B: i don't know religious b- beliefs or somebody's ah um you know morals or something like that i don't think that's right 

393.90 405.16 A: morals and values yeah that that's another ah example of crossing the line it's they're just things that ah it's it's not on i don't think it would be that hard to not do that and still be a successful comedian 

394.34 395.49 B: i think that's 

398.31 399.48 B: mhm 

406.42 408.71 B: yeah well you'd think you'd think it wouldn't be 

407.93 412.16 A: you stay away from the racism and you know try to stay away from the vulgar language 

412.17 414.24 A: and um you know um 

415.34 424.66 A: i'm sure you could find you know humor i've seen it you know people laugh every day and and it's not cursing and and religion and making fun of people and racism that makes them laugh 

418.60 419.48 B: yeah 

419.70 420.60 B: yeah it 

421.02 421.58 B: (( [mn] )) 

424.53 425.45 B: mhm 

425.74 432.43 B: it'd be nice to have some humor that an entire family could watch and not have to worry about it being you know x. rated or r. rated or whatever 

432.14 434.00 A: yeah 

433.40 440.74 B: 'cos i mean that there used to be ti- a lot of good comedy shows on t._v. that families could sit around the t._v. and watch or go to a movie and watch 

440.49 441.80 A: yeah 

441.20 446.55 B: but [mn] think of how when's the last movie you seen that you could actually take a child to that was comedy 

447.28 450.43 A: yeah well without without curse words or you know 

447.89 449.78 B: other than a cartoon 

449.85 450.74 B: yeah 

451.11 458.60 A: [laughter] if you look at everything ah these days i think is probably rated r. you know [laughter] most most movies for that part anyway 

455.75 456.55 B: mhm 

458.51 459.90 B: right right 

458.99 464.91 A: and the ones that are for kids geared towards children are just i i guess cartoons like disney movies and 

464.29 466.22 B: yeah they're pretty much cartoons 

465.72 476.31 A: if you look for something ah i mean the whole family can ah me myself i'm i'm an older gentleman not old but you know i'm thirty and i don't want to you know go with a kid and go look at a cartoon 

476.59 478.44 A: i want to go see a movie 

477.87 479.64 B: yeah i know i know 

479.32 483.95 A: you know it's it's hard to see a some kind of comedy and i love comedy myself 

483.87 490.30 B: yeah yeah they used to have ah like the son of flubber and all that stuff remember all those the nutty professor 

490.24 491.37 A: yeah 

490.86 494.27 B: and all those things that you know you could take a family to see and they were funny 

494.15 498.20 A: i just saw that a couple of days ago at a a rerun on my t._v. the nutty professor 

497.29 498.25 B: mhm 

498.73 503.64 B: yeah i mean but i mean not the new ones not the ones with eddie murphy but the old ones where 

503.69 509.58 B: where he made like the the shoes that you know that would make you bounce really high remember those the 

508.46 510.33 A: yeah yeah yeah 

509.69 510.99 B: very first one 

510.72 512.00 A: yeah 

511.46 518.08 B: and then look what they've done to the l- latest r- you know ones well i guess is it who plays now it's eddie murphy i think isn't it 

517.76 519.38 A: yeah 

518.82 521.12 B: yeah i mean that's ah it's 

521.28 523.29 B: it's not you know it's not like ah 

524.05 529.15 B: for most people they couldn't take their entire family to it they young kids you know you wouldn't take young kids to some of that 

529.02 533.06 A: yeah see eddie murphy's another one i've seen two sides of him i think he's a great comedian 

533.35 539.49 A: ah i've seen him in in the standup where he w- he cursed a lot and stuff like that and then i've seen him in things like the nutty professor 

533.62 534.63 B: mhm 

539.52 542.55 A: and ah like forty eight hours or um 

539.54 540.64 B: mhm 

542.16 544.94 B: yeah some some of things he's been good in 

542.75 543.74 A: where he was 

544.85 557.44 A: yeah he was funny and um what was it beverley hills cop i've seen him in that beverley hills cop two you know i've seen him in those movies and and that was good and there wasn't so much cursing but i mean still you know he's a great comedian because it's funny movies you know [mn] 

549.39 550.99 B: mhm yeah 

558.21 568.40 B: and now and now these these things that are jackass the movie i mean that's that's a comedy but i mean it's it's stupid and it's not something you really it's not really i don't think wholesome entertainment 

568.07 570.03 A: yeah that guy's actually i think um 

568.54 572.18 B: and give people all kinds of bad ideas you know 

571.42 573.64 A: yeah they're giving kids bad ideas 

573.43 574.84 B: yeah yeah 

573.82 579.09 A: is what they're doing but the physical stuff they a lot of kids out there are hurting themselves trying the stupid crap you know 

575.00 575.81 B: right 

578.76 581.47 B: they would have never thought about it until they saw it on a movie 

581.21 583.37 A: yeah exactly 

582.77 587.80 B: and yet ah it's people's choice for for going to see humor i think it's 

587.99 593.01 B: some of the movies and things that are coming out that are comedies are just ridiculous 

592.87 595.44 A: yeah yeah i agree 

594.16 596.58 B: ah i think they're just degrading 

598.38 599.73 B: so
