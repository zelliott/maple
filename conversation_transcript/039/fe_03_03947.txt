60.53 62.57 A: you know how or how you 

63.11 69.53 A: y- they know how you know they'll know how you r- you know how each r- will respond to certain things 

66.32 67.08 B: (( how y- )) 

68.92 76.34 B: yeah and like they know like if say something that's probably inappropriate i mean they know that how you're how you're meaning it and like you're not going to be 

69.95 71.65 A: yeah 

73.59 75.31 A: mhm 

77.04 80.17 B: like saying something vulgar or racist or whatever just it 

80.14 81.22 A: mhm 

80.33 83.15 B: could be or that well they know you're just joking 

82.60 85.80 A: yeah and if you don't know the person 

83.71 84.66 B: but 

85.85 99.07 A: you know you would you would think not to go that far with them you know because you don't know you know you don't know what they're going through you don't know if they're having a bad day any it could be anything you know you got to know where to draw the line 

91.50 93.46 B: exactly yeah 

95.45 96.33 B: yeah 

99.52 105.39 A: you know you can't can't just joke with any old person not everybody likes to joke with any old person 

102.85 103.66 B: (( well yeah what )) 

105.60 110.98 B: do you think about as far as like like in music or t._v. and movies whatever 

111.98 113.82 A: what what draws the line 

113.63 118.29 B: yeah 'cause like that's just out to the public and they don't it's not like people they know 

118.68 120.46 A: well 

120.98 125.86 A: well far as as far as music you know 

126.47 136.76 A: [mn] is there's only i mean it's like you can't take it to heart you know what i'm saying they doing it to make money you know what i'm saying and that's probably they they saying about how they live 

130.12 130.96 B: yeah 

131.72 132.80 B: exactly 

136.58 142.56 B: yeah exactly and even if it even if it's like not for money and it's like like and all that 

136.89 138.36 A: you know and they doing it all 

143.90 145.06 A: yeah 

143.91 148.42 B: but they that's what they know so that's what they sing about or write about 

148.39 149.64 A: yeah and um 

149.44 163.89 A: they might it might be like negative and stuff like that but i mean like it's going to be hard to sell all positives because the world ain't all good it's good and bad and what they rap about is good and bad you 

152.96 153.93 B: yeah 

158.26 159.24 B: exactly 

160.19 161.04 B: exactly 

163.72 164.84 B: mhm 

164.19 167.80 A: know what i'm saying they rap about what people can feel 

167.82 168.74 B: yeah 

167.85 176.25 A: you know what i'm saying like people they hard of heart because not everybody had it good not everybody had it hard so what they do is they try to relate to everybody 

173.61 174.41 B: yeah 

176.36 180.73 A: and to be in that you know position you have to relate to everybody 

181.10 182.37 A: (( you know what i'm saying )) 

182.44 188.21 A: and there's going to be some people out there that don't like it some people out there that do but the majority is 

188.28 194.19 B: yeah and like as far as like movies and stuff i mean i really don't get offended by that much stuff i think 

193.60 195.00 A: yeah 

194.32 199.64 B: it depends on like what kind of people you've been around like if you've been around like a lot of different types of people and stuff then 

199.23 201.32 A: mhm 

199.82 205.20 B: you probably won't like get offended or but if you haven't then you might um 

205.13 209.12 A: (( yeah as far as movies you understanding i'm saying )) 

209.22 210.60 A: it's only acting you 

210.64 211.79 B: exactly yeah 

210.69 215.34 A: know what i'm saying it they that's that right there 

215.45 221.78 A: some people have weak weak minds some people think that everything they see they should do 

218.30 219.11 B: yeah 

221.84 222.92 B: yeah 

222.30 231.98 A: you know what i'm saying and they don't they don't stop to think well that's that's fake you know that that's not real i shouldn't really go do that 'cause they getting paid for that you 

231.83 232.93 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

232.36 243.20 A: know what i'm saying they not they not showing you the consequence or what could really happen and you make they not showing you what could really happen down the line if you do what they do in real life 

242.88 244.14 B: mhm 

243.73 248.29 A: you know what i'm saying because if they was really doing that in real life they wouldn't be on t._v. 

244.74 245.66 B: yeah 

248.18 249.24 B: (( yeah right )) 

248.63 252.46 A: making movies making money like that they'd be locked up somewhere

257.92 263.10 B: well like things that are controversial and joking is a way to like to make like 

262.91 273.86 B: i mean they might not be things that you think you should joke about but that's the way to like speak out against you know what i'm saying if you joke about it that's a way to like everybody can like protest or something or 

269.28 270.87 A: mhm 

273.67 280.46 B: they don't like but like can joke about it as a way to like kind of protest if you know what i'm saying
