14.04 16.37 A: [mn] yeah nice to meet you [noise] 

16.38 22.34 A: so we're supposed to talk about acceptable and unacceptable comedy where we draw the line 

22.32 23.34 B: yeah 

23.10 24.57 A: [noise] that's a tough one [noise] 

24.16 26.73 B: yeah i don't draw the line too far though 

27.34 30.36 B: i mean er i i really don't have a line 

30.66 32.84 B: i have a pretty good sense of humor 

33.66 37.48 A: [noise] [noise] what do you do when someone else tells a joke that you don't 

37.61 40.14 A: exactly approve of 

40.32 41.54 B: um 

42.62 45.25 B: i'll just tell them that that wasn't funny [laughter] 

45.49 50.38 A: [noise] do you ever just [noise] kind of ignore it and [noise] i guess that 

49.13 52.90 B: the only jokes that i don't that i find offensive are black jokes 

53.06 55.92 A: yeah i don't like that but i also don't like um 

56.10 65.19 A: [noise] some nationality jokes you know like making fun of chinese or asian people or something like that you know i don't like that 

58.18 60.26 B: yeah racist jokes 

63.26 64.14 B: yeah 

65.45 66.46 B: yeah 

65.67 69.47 A: [noise] especially if it uses words that i find un- unacceptable 

69.41 70.47 B: yeah 

70.60 73.34 A: slang words or nicknames or something 

70.82 71.74 B: yeah 

72.97 84.81 B: well i don't have a problem with if it's a person that you know is that i'm close with and i know that they're not really being racist that that's just a joke then i then i can accept it 

82.44 83.34 A: uh-huh 

84.19 94.77 A: yeah the source has a lot sometimes at work when someone tells an off color joke that that's kind of a hard situation [noise] you know if it's somebody who's your equal 

95.12 103.05 A: it's okay i think or it's easy to say you know i don't think that's very funny and it's not very appropriate for this [noise] for this location 

103.08 106.36 A: but if it's your boss or something that's kind of tough 

106.65 108.43 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

108.54 112.73 A: [noise] i don't know why bosses should be telling those kind of jokes anyway but 

112.39 114.31 B: [laughter] yeah well 

112.95 114.75 A: er i have had it happen 

114.74 122.82 B: yeah well i i think that any kind of superior uh needs to watch any kind of jokes unless they have a certain kind of relationship with their employee 

123.04 125.00 B: because um 

125.43 126.74 B: i think that uh 

127.61 133.66 B: you know er em like for instance you know a guy call i'm i have a mental illness 

133.40 134.33 A: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

133.85 136.25 B: i'm borderline personality disorder 

135.96 136.84 A: uh-huh 

136.65 148.11 B: and um one of the staff of the programmes i go to made a joke about another client calling him retarded so you know and i didn't find it very funny 

143.99 145.13 A: (( ooh )) 

147.99 150.41 A: no that's definitely not appropriate 

148.48 151.51 B: because then that makes me think of how he thinks of me 

151.24 152.20 A: (( yah )) 

152.48 153.45 B: so 

152.86 156.72 A: in that position you'd think someone would be sensitive 

156.55 157.62 B: yeah 

156.79 158.68 A: you know or they'd be understanding 

159.15 161.33 B: yeah well [noise] i don't think 

160.33 162.90 A: [noise] the trouble is too i've noticed that if you 

163.32 173.08 A: [noise] if you hear a joke from someone that you don't like and you don't say something the first time then you're liable to hear more jokes in that same vein 

173.48 177.41 A: [noise] and that makes it hard so then you have to [noise] say something 

177.35 180.01 B: (( yeah yes i uh )) 

180.05 188.70 B: you know and the one there's the the more i think the jokes that i i don't really find offensive and most people mind is that i don't find sex jokes very 

188.61 196.51 B: i find them funny because they go both ways because you know we have just as many jokes for men as they have for us 

190.04 191.00 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

196.20 200.29 A: yes what about blonde jokes do they they either bother you 

197.00 197.99 B: so 

199.23 203.66 B: those i'm i'm blo- i'm a natural blonde myself and i do not find them offensive 

203.31 213.90 A: oh you don't okay i don't either er if for a instance you can you could say okay it's a it's a brunette joke [laughter] or c- i'm a brunette so [mn] 

203.93 204.99 B: no 

214.58 217.64 B: do you find brunette jokes offensive [noise] 

216.85 224.76 A: no no i wouldn't i don't find blonde jokes offensive and i don't find brunette jokes offensive i just figure that's kind of one where you can 

224.95 232.54 A: you know it doesn't really i- it it's not really an offence to to the blonde or the brunette or whatever it's just a joke you know 

232.07 244.07 B: [mn] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah i mean i think that maybe it's just i- it all depends on if it's er like with the mental illness for instance for example it's something that somebody cannot control and it's not very funny 

233.12 234.57 A: they don't bother me 

243.71 245.03 A: (( right [noise] )) 

244.14 254.01 B: you know and it is st- it's stuff that you know and if people if somebody makes a racist joke that is actually racist [noise] then i also don't find that funny it's just 

254.16 260.71 B: if you if the jokes are coming from hatred for that type of person [noise] then i don't find them funny 

259.64 262.14 A: mhm yeah you and you can usually tell 

261.84 263.81 B: yes you can i mean [noise] 

262.54 266.64 A: even if it's someone you don't know just by the way they're telling it or you know 

266.32 267.43 B: yes 

267.67 273.60 A: what about religious jokes like you know a priest a rabbi and a something walk into a bar [laughter] did you ever 

267.72 268.61 B: and you 

272.95 282.71 B: uh i i've hear- i've heard that i don't really remember it you know exactly but i i don't i'm not a very religious person so and i don't find it offensive um 

282.81 291.49 A: [noise] yah i don't i don't either i figure well they're kind of covering a lot of different denominations [laughter] in one so [laughter] 

283.05 284.03 B: mm because 

290.26 291.23 B: (( yeah uh )) 

291.57 301.44 B: i uh i just think that mm 'cause people you know actually there there's really no hatred for one religion i mean everybody has their own opinion but actually there's no 

295.16 295.73 A: (( [noise] )) 

302.02 312.98 B: nobody like where i live we don't really have that much hatred for any religion but i mean there's only one and that's a jehovah witness because er they really pressure people 

306.05 307.12 A: sure 

310.27 311.14 A: uh-huh 

312.93 314.18 A: yeah you know er 

314.31 327.85 A: when i was younger we used to have a lot of jehovah's witnesses come to the door but i can't i can't remember the last time it's been years and years since anyone's come around maybe they don't do that kind of thing any more i don't know
