238.58 240.35 B: when and if he did that to them 

241.62 245.18 B: and he he you could tell that he knows that's not right

280.62 281.67 A: um 

281.94 285.55 A: but as far as talking about strangers and 

285.61 286.94 B: (( yeah )) 

286.63 292.46 A: the way they do it on television and broadcast things about certain people's weight or whatever 

291.53 292.89 B: (( [noise] right )) 

292.47 294.60 A: is that's kind of 

295.39 301.49 A: i would think that you'd have to run into those people those same people at some point you know 

299.81 304.59 B: [noise] yeah [noise] 

301.67 306.22 A: and i wouldn't want to to do that [laughter] i wouldn't want to uh see them after saying those things about them

310.57 316.94 B: i mean i can laugh at myself and make you know make a real idiot out of myself but to do that to somebody else and have them 

317.03 319.96 B: uh i don't think so not if i have to see them again 

320.70 323.58 A: you know i think too there's some things
