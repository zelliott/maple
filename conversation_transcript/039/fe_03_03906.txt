0.24 1.41 A: hello 

2.55 3.51 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

3.30 4.25 A: hello 

5.64 6.94 A: (( hello [mn] )) 

9.39 10.29 A: hello 

9.46 10.04 B: (( [noise] )) 

10.77 12.30 A: (( is anyone there )) 

11.71 12.79 B: hello 

12.37 13.25 A: (( hi )) 

13.02 17.97 B: hi i got cut off in the middle of the instructions it was something about comedy 

17.71 24.00 A: [mn] actually it was like how do you draw the line between humor that's 

24.26 30.32 A: [mn] acceptable and humor that's unacceptable [laughter] i think that's doable 

26.74 27.80 B: okay 

27.88 29.00 B: (( all righty )) 

29.80 32.49 B: okay we could talk about that i'm felicia by the way 

31.98 33.52 A: hi felicia i'm kim 

33.28 34.27 B: hi 

33.83 34.51 A: (( [mn] )) 

34.58 37.63 B: okay let's see how we should talk about this um [mn] 

36.30 37.37 A: okay 

37.88 39.12 B: i don't know what 

38.36 44.74 A: i guess [mn] to me it depends first of all on who you're talking to [laughter] [laughter] 

41.93 47.57 B: exactly and i agree a hundred percent a hundred percent and and who you're with when the discussions 

46.16 53.21 A: yeah i mean obviously the things you say to your friends you can't say to your mother or to your boss or you know 

50.34 51.39 B: mhm 

51.83 59.45 B: right or or say when younger children are around or something of that nature right and i i agree with that because a lot of different [mn] 

54.76 56.40 A: exactly 

59.50 65.19 B: levels and topics can be extremely funny if it's in the right company 

64.03 68.33 A: (( with the right i think it also depends on how well you know the person too )) 

67.24 78.35 B: yes because if it makes you uncomfortable you may laugh but not because it's comedy but because of embarrassment perhaps so you know [mn] laughter doesn't necessarily mean that you think it's funny 

70.29 71.41 A: right 

74.07 75.22 A: right 

77.94 83.18 A: [mn] that's yeah there is there's plenty of uncomfortable laughter out there that's for sure yes 

78.48 80.58 B: right in a situation like that 

81.79 82.96 B: mhm 

83.36 93.70 B: no but that i a hundred percent agree with you on that and it also depends i think on who who delivers it to you and if you're going to like a comedy show or a a um a performer 

93.45 94.42 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

93.86 96.84 B: certain people you don't expect to say certain things 

96.21 105.87 A: yeah that's true and i think some you know that could [mn] also go where you might think something is funny but then youre surprised by the person who said it or [laughter] 

97.27 98.16 B: and it 

103.78 110.50 B: right and then right and you can't react in in the right way because it's em- almost embarrassing to hear it coming from 

110.15 111.29 A: that's right 

110.71 121.57 B: like you're saying if your mother tells you a joke that you don't expect to come out of her mouth you're more appalled and you may laugh out of nervousness but probably not something that you would ah call comedy 

114.41 115.52 A: yeah 

117.25 118.24 A: [laughter] 

120.52 122.91 A: that's true that is very true 

122.39 123.56 B: mhm 

123.13 124.86 A: (( um let's see )) 

123.86 128.20 B: so it's really subjective to the deliverer and and everything else 

127.91 132.61 A: i also find too that i my sense of humor can be different with different people too 

132.27 133.36 B: mhm 

132.71 147.31 A: um like with my fiance who will obviously would know me the best you know we we kind of have our own little refined humor thing that we have going and then i kind of laugh at different things with different people that i know depending on my you know relationship 

146.80 147.77 B: true 

147.31 154.92 A: and the the st- kind of almost like the standing they have in my life like you know people i work with or um 

153.32 156.19 B: mhm right you have to wear a different hat 

155.95 156.96 A: yeah 

156.32 159.77 B: in different situations for various reasons 

157.75 158.78 A: yeah 

159.07 162.65 A: yeah that's very true i never thought about that before [mn] but you do 

160.10 161.17 B: (( and also )) 

162.57 176.36 B: mhm and also like you said if you share um a bond with someone um you find certain things funny because it may remind you of things you had discussed or an in inside joke you know that other people won't even get 

171.38 172.56 A: oh yeah 

173.79 175.38 A: exactly 

175.49 178.03 A: we've got tons of those [laughter] 

176.61 180.86 B: right like when you say oh i guess you had to be there or something like that right like 

179.61 186.00 A: [laughter] i mean some of the jokes are almost to the point where it's like a one word thing we can say that word and we just know automatically yeah 

184.85 189.21 B: right and you bust out laughing right for no apparent reason but for some some ah 

186.06 188.66 A: (( [laughter] )) 

189.34 193.31 B: deep connection that you have on that one thing absolutely i agree with you on that 

192.67 194.18 A: exactly 

193.55 194.99 B: and even um 

195.09 199.17 B: with children too ah sometimes um laughter is infectious 

198.64 199.70 A: (( yes )) 

199.32 203.55 B: and ah if you have the giggles i mean i remember being young 

203.57 212.80 B: and going to church services with my family and if one of us got the giggles for no apparent reason there was no way we could stop even if it wasn't funny 

207.90 209.45 A: [laughter] 

211.07 212.00 A: yes 

212.19 213.26 A: yes 

212.68 221.85 B: you know and and i kind of miss having that spontaneity at times because i can remember being [mn] like tears running down my face laughing over something that [mn] 

219.75 221.14 A: oh yeah 

221.60 226.31 A: i know i don't think i've done that in a long time and that was good stuff [laughter] 

223.04 224.15 B: mhm 

224.42 231.29 B: yes it was and that's one thing that makes you say all right that was that was real life you know not so serious and everything 

228.85 229.79 A: yeah 

231.05 234.35 A: and kids are fun you know i thinking about that too i've 

234.13 239.16 A: come in contact with kids more lately i have a friend who has two daughters and i don't have any kids myself 

238.94 252.42 A: um but ah you know i really enjoy 'em and um they have two daughters and they're real jokesters and they're always kidding around and every time i see them they've got some new [mn] joke to tell and um [mn] you know so that now i kind of try to when i hear jokes i 

247.77 248.72 B: mhm 

252.28 260.88 A: kind of try to think okay is that something i can tell my friends' kids so i try to remember it and um you know so i can give 'em a few jokes back [laughter] 

255.43 257.61 B: right mhm mhm 

259.22 269.81 B: right and it's also fun to look at [mn] i have a twelve year old and she's you know in that that child young woman stage so it's not the same but when they're little and they have that 

266.32 267.28 A: (( yeah )) 

270.05 282.18 B: that real genuine laughter and that real genuine awe kind of face it's kind of nice sometimes just to catch that [mn] and it kind of brings you back you know you forget like the simple fun 

274.23 275.48 A: (( yeah )) 

278.44 279.78 A: yeah 

281.89 283.02 A: yeah 

282.23 293.32 B: you know and and laughter that you can get out of seeing a puppy rolling in the in the mud or something or now you say oh my god i have to wash this dog or bring him in the house and the carpet but then you look at your child's face and they're like 

286.90 287.97 A: right 

293.44 300.30 B: th- they're just filled with with happiness so [lipsmack] yeah comedy is a good thing we could use more of that in the world right now 

295.53 297.95 A: (( yeah [mn] that is )) 

299.84 302.81 A: i agree with everything that's going on 

301.90 306.60 B: mhm real real i i almost like slapstick because it means nothing 

306.37 307.54 A: yeah 

306.94 310.27 B: you know it's not targeted toward any group it's not [lipsmack] 

310.55 320.43 A: y- you know it's yeah and you know it's funny it's like the worse things get in the world the more i just wanna see these stupid comedies you know i i 

310.85 312.19 B: (( topical )) 

318.89 323.41 B: mhm where the guy walks into the ladder and hits him in the head that kind of a thing 

322.29 331.11 A: yeah like something about mary that's just like so ridiculous and just so out there you know those types of movies that [mn] you know or even t._v. like i don't 

330.98 342.40 A: want to watch the news any more you know i don't wanna see you know the war movies i don't wanna see any of that kinda stuff any more i just wanna [mn] watch the goofy things that make me laugh so i don't have to think about it 

332.47 333.50 B: right 

340.95 354.50 B: and mean nothing right like even the late night talk shows i mean they can be really funny but they're too topical sometimes and they hit home too much and it's it's it's a sad thing it's a sad thing 'cause they're really everything is way too serious 

343.10 344.81 A: [noise] oh yeah 

347.11 348.51 A: they really are 

348.73 350.31 A: i know it 

350.60 351.94 A: (( is [mn] )) 

354.63 360.73 A: yeah i- i- isn't it part of the problem too is people just you know they do they take things too seriously 

354.71 356.65 B: [mn] we can use a little more humor 

360.17 361.32 B: mhm 

360.68 370.78 A: and um you know people are kind of full of themselves in a way sometimes you know with [mn] as far as their opinion's right and you know that's it that- that's the only way 

368.92 369.74 B: true 

369.98 372.13 B: and it even comes across in their comedy 

371.62 372.81 A: yes 

372.18 380.37 B: and and that's a sad thing that's it's true it's so true and that's why [mn] a lot of times you know i i don't mind when my daughter says to me oh can we go to the 

380.36 392.88 B: i don't know some lizzie mcguire movie or something i'm like yeah let's do that you know because it's never going to touch on anything well now they do actually sadly enough but most times they don't touch on anything that's that's real you know 

389.00 390.28 A: do they really 

391.82 395.52 A: or topical or political or anything like that 

392.99 394.14 B: yeah 

394.65 402.50 B: because even it's a sad thing like even the disney cartoons or the you know the children's channels now with the cartoons they they seem to touch on 

402.39 403.70 A: yeah 

402.82 413.80 B: on things you know at times it's humorous because sometimes it's good to have like a little adult topic in there that you can kind of laugh at like an undertone but when it gets too [mn] too real 

410.27 411.58 A: exactly 

413.41 414.69 A: yeah 

414.12 418.54 B: especially like you said nowadays there's just too much stuff out there that's frightening 

418.26 423.35 A: i agree and you know what's funny is i've never been into like the whole i mean i because i told you i don't have kids 

422.68 423.60 B: mhm 

423.24 434.97 A: and i've never been into like the whole disney movie thing and the you know just it hasn't really been my thing but i notice now as i've you know this whole thing has been going on like i wa- i watched shrek last night for the first time 

428.14 429.06 B: right 

433.61 438.30 B: you're looking for things like that right mhm that was a great movie wasn't it 

435.04 444.02 A: yeah and i loved it it was so it was oh i couldn't believe what a good movie that was and i had heard so much about it i'm like oh you know it's just one of those kids' movies and everyone's saying 

438.84 439.84 B: mhm 

442.78 444.03 B: mhm 

443.83 451.33 A: just watch it just watch it and i loved it i just loved it i was i loved getting into it and it was fun and it was light and it was [mn] you know 

450.84 455.37 B: it was an escape mhm and you could have a good laugh without feeling [mn] 

451.68 452.75 A: yeah 

455.27 467.07 A: and and back to the topic and there was nothing really offensive about it it was it was a movie that i think appealed would appeal to a lot of people and make people feel good about things um you know in a non offensive way 

455.58 457.18 B: guilty almost 

458.78 459.78 B: mhm 

461.96 462.96 B: mhm 

466.58 469.56 B: mhm absolutely and it had a nice little meaning too 

469.24 470.29 A: yeah 

469.63 475.07 B: you know which you know accept everyone and whatnot yeah i- it was that was a nice movie i liked that i've seen it 

475.09 482.22 B: i do- don't want to admit but i've seen that several times because we happen to own it [laughter] but that's one i don't mind i don't mind that one 

477.23 480.67 A: [laughter] have you [laughter]

483.00 483.72 B: it's
