96.65 111.47 A: do you listen to like um [lipsmack] uh what do you call it jokes uh jokes that are that are that are yeah yeah i don't like that now i draw the line there [laughter] but 

102.54 105.55 B: (( discriminate to discriminatory )) 

107.52 109.72 B: (( [noise] yes definitely )) 

110.05 111.78 B: well and um 

111.87 117.63 B: sometimes i guess it also depends on like the age [noise] group watching you know what i mean and that's 

115.48 117.49 A: yeah that 

117.69 125.04 B: as far as it goes like movies uh like the ratings on them but nowadays sometimes the ratings on movies aren't even 

125.01 128.50 A: [noise] that accurate right 

125.34 126.15 B: right 

126.44 132.99 B: yeah yeah really like p._g. thirteen sometimes still kids shouldn't you know younger kids shouldn't be seeing that stuff 

131.67 135.77 A: (( [noise] mhm so how long have you been doing this survey thing )) 

136.07 140.56 B: um actually just this year this is my only like second call 

140.22 141.23 A: okay 

141.15 142.33 B: (( how long have you )) 

142.34 144.88 A: just a couple i've had a couple of them too 

144.35 145.68 B: yeah 

145.11 151.05 A: and i i think they're interesting but um better get back to the comedy i guess [laughter] 

147.07 148.04 B: yeah 

149.14 164.09 B: yeah [laughter] yeah um i'm a i'm a college student and a lot of times they're bring in um actually just recently we had a um comedian come into campus and uh my room mate went to it and she said like 

160.59 162.24 A: (( [laughter] )) 

164.86 177.96 B: that he was really really funny but sometimes um he was really discriminatory towards like certain people like you're but he's making jewish jokes and he insulted like african american he was making african american jokes but like 

172.41 174.31 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

177.90 186.02 B: obviously like if somebody else like if like a white person an asian you know made that comment then that'd be like offensive you know what i mean 

183.39 184.35 A: (( [noise] mm mhm )) 

185.42 187.20 A: [noise] yeah well 

186.21 189.88 B: it's kind of like weird where you draw the line between that 

189.44 192.91 A: i but i think any jokes like that that are cultural 

192.99 193.95 B: (( mhm )) 

193.22 195.45 A: you kind of like have to draw the line 'cause 

195.42 197.07 B: (( yeah definitely )) 

195.75 204.43 A: i mean everybody's everybody's human and everybody has feelings and [noise] no two people are alike even though they might be the s- of the same 

204.55 205.73 A: (( [noise] culture )) 

205.55 206.87 B: right right right 

205.97 209.76 A: and jokes like that sort of like s- stereotype 

208.21 209.37 B: offend you 

209.88 212.12 B: yeah yeah definitely 

210.68 211.57 A: and uh 

211.74 214.97 A: i don't think that that's a cool thing to do [laughter] 

213.82 215.72 B: (( no no not at all )) 

215.06 216.33 A: [laughter] 

215.90 217.87 B: no and um 

216.50 217.65 A: but uh 

218.02 219.42 B: (( go what were you going to say )) 

219.22 225.91 A: i was just going to say but comedy is my thing because laughter is music is uh medicine for the heart 

225.77 235.93 B: yes yeah i lo- oh i love to laugh too but i just uh like stand up i've never like really sat down and watched like i have like a lot of of robby robin williams 

226.00 226.57 A: (( [noise] )) 

228.54 230.26 A: yeah 

235.35 236.90 A: yeah 

235.96 242.18 B: he's a popular d._v._d. but some of the stuff like you watch and you're just like is he really is that coming out of his mouth you know what i mean 

240.81 246.95 A: right or can they even say that [laughter] in the public or you know whatever 

242.27 243.15 B: so 

243.90 246.89 B: yeah like sometimes yeah definitely 

246.95 249.45 B: definitely crosses the line but 

248.36 262.93 A: [noise] mhm but a lot of times um there's no ratings well yeah on things that are live of course but um on t._v. there's a lot of things that i think are put on there that shouldn't be because 

257.00 258.11 B: yes 

262.92 271.53 A: even though they may have those things where you can block kids from seeing it kids a lot of kids watch stuff like that and i don't think that's a good thing [laughter] 

265.90 266.94 B: mhm 

268.38 269.48 B: yes 

270.68 274.76 B: yeah and like because that just shows that it's acceptable [noise] 

274.15 276.42 A: yeah it does and it 

274.94 277.59 B: and that says and that's not acceptable no 

276.84 283.33 A: and it shouldn't be it shouldn't be even if it is for money or what have you but you're right it's not acceptable 

282.88 291.50 B: right right 'cause that's how like that's how society will grow up and that will just become acceptable and like consented morally that's not right 

283.94 284.92 A: (( [cough] )) 

290.93 295.57 A: mhm [noise] and see the little things mean a a lot especially [noise] 

292.27 293.19 B: like 

295.78 296.56 A: with 

296.62 300.75 A: you know especially with uh the way the world is today [laughter] [noise] 

297.72 299.87 B: yeah even the language 

300.32 303.11 B: yeah even just language you know 

302.60 305.05 A: mhm yeah 

303.70 309.51 B: 'cause it's thrown here thrown there on stuff like that and kids are watching it then it's going to be no big deal 

308.68 310.45 A: (( [noise] yes right )) 

309.85 312.17 B: for that to come out of their mouths or whatever 

311.53 316.14 A: right and they will repeat it [laughter] 

313.92 314.76 B: yep 

314.77 317.79 B: [laughter] yep definitely so uh 

316.41 321.29 A: and and not only repeat it but they'll try it 

320.12 326.32 B: yeah yeah and that becomes very offensive so that's where the problem comes in but that that's with any media 

322.70 325.56 A: mhm it does 

325.96 327.72 A: yeah 

326.47 329.43 B: you know what i mean not not even just comedy 

329.09 331.46 A: yeah yeah 

329.79 334.00 B: but um [lipsmack] did you recently see the movie old school 

333.85 335.57 A: old school no 

335.15 337.10 B: yeah it's with will ferrell 

336.92 337.77 A: (( uh-uh )) 

337.09 351.79 B: that was that was really really funny but there again i think the rating was p._g. thirteen and it was a little bit iffy 'cause there was some nudity and uh i don't know but it was it was really funny but not one that the kids need to see you know 

339.16 340.00 A: okay 

343.51 344.44 A: okay 

345.06 346.00 A: ooh 

350.92 354.04 A: mhm mhm well 

352.45 353.89 B: yeah but 

354.09 358.87 A: yeah i think a lot of times today they put stuff on if you got money you can buy 

359.06 366.31 A: a t._v. or a song or a show you know [laughter] and i don't think i think that takes away from the quality 

359.44 360.28 B: yeah 

362.07 363.08 B: yeah 

366.09 367.21 B: mhm 

366.59 367.50 A: of the 

367.67 369.48 A: whatever it is that you're doing 

369.54 375.81 A: but money today talks over anything [noise] it's more like [noise] who you know [noise] and how much you got 

374.51 375.42 B: (( yeah )) 

375.80 377.37 B: right right right 

378.16 384.26 B: a- and because they'll wear yeah exactly they'll wear anything if you've got the money to pay them or what have you 

383.08 385.60 A: mhm mhm 

384.28 393.79 B: no matter how many like whatever criticism they get for it they'll still put it on 'cause they're not the the people criticizing aren't the ones turning out the money you know what i mean 

387.83 390.03 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

392.20 394.33 A: that's right so they'll put it on 

394.58 397.48 A: but um that sucks [laughter] 

395.10 395.91 B: (( [sigh] )) 

396.86 398.46 B: yeah yeah 

397.81 398.88 A: [laughter] 

399.06 402.60 B: (( but i don't know what else i like about )) 

403.02 411.02 B: [lipsmack] comedy just um i gue- yeah like you're seeing it live you really can't control live comedy but so they don't put ratings on live comedy 

406.53 407.93 A: (( mhm )) 

408.52 409.34 A: (( uh-huh )) 

410.63 414.32 A: i don't think so i think it's not down here anyway 

412.14 413.09 B: yeah 

414.41 419.18 B: yeah well a lot of times that's on like like h._b._o. some channels you have to like buy 

418.85 420.67 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

419.26 430.92 B: you know but even so how many a lot of people have that you know what i mean so kids flipping through channels they're they can watch that er i mean when they're they're at home alone they can easily watch that you know 

422.64 425.71 A: yeah yeah [noise] 

429.95 437.41 A: watch it yeah yeah and if if they don't have like a what do you what do you call it that rating lock or what have you 

436.68 438.21 B: yeah 

437.65 446.85 A: yeah and the kids what they do eh what you tell them not to do [laughter] first [laughter] so that's why i think it's important too that 

441.95 442.82 B: right 

443.05 444.36 B: right right 

447.02 450.84 A: the comedy of stereotyping people is not a good thing 

450.10 454.64 B: yeah mm no no no no that's yeah you definitely need to draw the line there 

453.97 457.19 A: there yeah yeah but um 

456.23 459.01 B: but people they're there to make money that's what it's about 

458.24 464.86 A: of course that's what i was going to say it's about the money it's about that dollar now [laughter] 

461.05 462.00 B: mhm 

463.17 466.27 B: [laughter] definitely um 

465.10 466.16 A: anything 

466.63 468.04 B: (( go ahead what were you going to say )) 

467.20 470.18 A: anything if you got money you can buy anything you want 

469.99 471.16 B: mhm 

470.31 471.92 A: in the u._s. of a you 

472.08 474.09 B: yeah [laughter] yeah 

473.52 475.22 A: can get away with it so 

475.44 478.13 A: i mean you you do have to draw the line somewhere 

478.28 479.89 B: yeah um 

478.88 484.04 A: 'cause there's a lot of garbage within comedy within violence within 

484.37 487.04 A: er within really an- any and everything today 

487.34 496.14 B: yeah yeah definitely um the co- what i was going to say about uh comedy like the more the more people watch it the more 

495.66 497.45 A: (( yeah accepted )) 

496.29 502.94 B: they wa- it just becomes acceptable you know if if they're really doing racial you know 

497.87 500.01 A: acceptable right 

503.49 508.89 B: slurs that's really bad that just becomes acceptable or cult- like ster- the stereotyping 

504.08 505.70 A: (( mhm )) 

507.72 509.70 A: (( ex- yeah it's )) 

508.99 516.58 B: it just it's not it's no longer um a ridicule yeah it's it's normal it becomes the norm 

511.90 513.49 A: a taboo it's 

513.68 518.73 A: yeah and it it is normal and that's that's not a very good thing 

518.50 531.95 B: no [laughter] not at all but then again where do you draw the line what between like making people laugh you know what i mean like if you uh what topics do you talk on about talk about then to make people laugh but keep it clean humor 

519.22 520.37 A: (( [laughter] )) 

529.04 531.12 A: yeah yeah 

531.53 533.87 A: yeah yeah 

532.41 534.88 B: and humor is hard to keep clean 

534.45 539.41 A: it is hard 'cause you can laugh at every almost everything [laughter] 

538.66 539.87 B: mhm 

539.58 541.83 A: but that's that's the problem 

542.15 546.85 A: because um it it's hard to actually be able to 

542.51 543.43 B: yeah 

547.60 559.48 A: [sigh] monitor it very hard to monitor it [lipsmack] and a lot of times today things aren't monitored the way they should be they're monitored by that money the dollar bill 

549.33 550.72 B: (( mhm right )) 

551.93 553.57 B: (( yeah it's )) 

559.32 560.32 B: right 

559.75 561.76 A: [laughter] so [noise] 

560.82 563.12 B: (( right if it what )) 

561.87 563.03 A: so it's 

563.21 566.68 A: it's all it's all a business 

563.31 564.30 B: (( was i gonna say )) 

566.73 568.68 B: mhm mhm 

567.81 569.22 A: it's all a business 

569.33 572.91 B: yeah isn't it isn't it a good uh topic 'cause it's 

573.73 575.44 B: very controversial 

575.19 580.31 A: [noise] it is it is and everybody has opinions [laughter] 

579.15 589.08 B: and there and what and there is a big question mark is where the solution comes along and where to draw that line [laughter] [laughter] so i guess that's another aspect of that 

585.68 587.61 A: right right 

587.84 596.50 A: but too i think you know what i think you can you can also say you can draw the line depending on where you are in your personal life because i'm a single parent 

594.91 595.73 B: (( yeah )) 

596.59 597.67 B: yeah 

596.91 599.89 A: and there are certain things that i know that i can't allow
