20.77 30.45 A: [mn] [noise] i mean i don't know whether they're talking about live comedy comedy on television comedy on the internet you know a lot of i get a lot of jokes forwarded to me on the internet [mn] 

30.05 34.16 B: well i think that comedy is comedy no matter where the source is 

34.31 35.57 A: right 

34.95 38.98 B: how would you draw the line between acceptable and bad taste 

38.62 39.81 A: (( well [lipsmack] )) 

42.58 45.16 A: is it something i'll show my kids 

45.09 46.75 B: i i beg your pardon 

46.16 49.14 A: you know is it something i'm gonna be showing my kids 

48.87 53.06 B: well i think that's one criteria for drawing a line don't you 

51.13 52.02 A: yeah 

52.59 58.77 A: yeah exactly you know and if it's not acceptable for kids is it something i'd be proud to show my mother 

58.98 65.91 B: oh that's an interesting ah an interesting question [laughter] being as i'm probably old enough to be your mother 

65.17 67.60 A: [laughter] 

66.78 73.23 B: [laughter] ah well i i agree with you there of course the- there are multiple other things that i 

72.47 73.55 A: oh sure 

73.48 79.87 B: can be in bad taste too i mean i've seen some humor which i've labeled as sick humor 

75.47 76.46 A: oh yeah [lipsmack] 

79.58 82.24 A: oh yeah there's a lot of it [laughter] 

80.35 81.92 B: you know some 

82.16 86.46 B: sometimes i think it is really in bad taste to make fun of 

87.19 89.14 B: those with handicaps 

88.96 90.19 A: mhm 

89.57 94.30 B: no matter whether the handicap be a physical one a mental one 

94.36 96.96 B: or or even um 

97.19 104.11 B: learning disabilities are are also handicaps and sometimes i think that type of comedy is in bad taste what do you 

103.25 108.61 A: right oh yeah [mn] and a lot of the ethnic jokes and 

108.02 109.87 B: yeah 

109.15 110.36 A: [mn] you know 

110.39 120.63 B: yeah i mean i i think there's ah a multitude of criteria that can be drawn where good good taste humor versus bad taste humor 

120.63 129.88 B: and then again and maybe it's just me i think that sometimes the um the criteria's determined by the state of mind in which you're in when you watch the humor 

129.68 130.74 A: right 

130.71 131.69 B: i mean 

130.89 132.13 A: right 

131.81 137.28 B: i i mean 'cause i- i'll be honest with you you know the first time i saw airplane the movie 

136.69 137.67 A: uh-huh 

137.44 139.58 B: that's probably way before your time 

138.92 142.99 A: oh no i remember it vividly [laughter] i have a brother who's a pilot [mn] 

142.24 150.05 B: oh okay we- i'll be honest with you the first time i saw it i thought i was go- excuse my language but i thought i was gonna pee my pants it was so funny 

149.46 150.35 A: uh-huh 

150.11 158.95 B: but the second time i saw it i thought oh that's really bad taste i mean there were multi- a multitude of things that were really in bad taste 

158.53 159.64 A: right 

159.35 161.97 B: not only the first one but the second one 

161.48 162.65 A: yeah 

162.07 163.27 B: um 

163.52 166.62 B: well i've ta- i've talked for a while it's your turn [mn] 

165.79 178.73 A: [laughter] well you know like i said is it my criteria you know for me is is it acceptable for my kids or for my mother you know but then again you know when i said for my kids because i try to teach my kids 

180.28 182.40 A: you know to be 

183.27 184.75 A: how um 

184.45 186.38 B: broad minded 

185.70 189.45 A: broad minded and to be conscious of what other people's feelings are 

189.04 190.31 B: yeah 

189.66 199.27 A: you know and you know we come from a i come from a very large family and like so like you said like people with handicaps you know my dad only has one arm 

199.48 200.58 B: mhm 

199.59 204.47 A: from a farming accident my husband has lou gehrig's disease so he's in a wheelchair 

201.32 202.68 B: yeah 

204.21 205.53 B: wow 

204.84 205.93 A: you know 

206.22 209.09 A: [mn] so we've dealt with a lot of that in our family the kids are- 

209.30 215.21 A: [mn] you know i don't want them making fun of people like that because we we live it 

213.00 214.10 B: right 

215.00 216.09 B: yeah 

215.48 220.04 A: you know we have a i h- a nephew who even though he's in his twenties 

220.22 227.99 A: mentally is about a four year old you know so you talk about developmental handicaps and stuff see we live those kind of things 

222.47 223.61 B: oh 

227.57 228.71 B: yeah 

228.12 233.00 A: you know so you know [mn] is it something i want my kids to learn is funny 

232.62 241.10 B: that- that's right because you know when you living with those type of situations in your family then to your kids that- that's just everyday 

240.91 241.80 A: right 

241.23 245.72 B: so they don't point at those type of people and laugh because they're used to seeing 

245.28 250.72 A: right and they don't want people making fun of their grandfather their their cousin or their dad 

250.14 258.22 B: it right um bu- but then you know that's that's that's a a key right there is something that you're used to 

258.28 260.19 B: you don't make fun of 

259.63 261.70 A: right right 

260.58 270.96 B: ah and i know exactly how you feel i'm also from a large family and although i am not ah several of my sisters are rather 

264.89 265.77 A: uh-huh 

271.12 272.05 B: obese 

271.70 273.33 A: mhm mhm 

272.73 278.21 B: and it's amazing at the jokes that are made about people that are fat 

277.62 281.43 A: yeah that's one of the few things left that they do still make fun of and is still 

281.58 283.83 A: politically correct to do so 

283.46 296.98 B: yeah and you know another thing and and i have to be honest and say i'm i'm guilty of it simply because i have one sister out of the whole sch- schm- schmeer of sisters i have and my best my friend are both blondes 

296.74 297.89 A: mhm 

297.46 308.69 B: and i guess that there are times and it's more so with my best friend than with my sister when ah a couple of times she's gotten upset about my blonde jokes 

308.29 309.35 A: yeah 

309.07 313.52 B: and so i guess even that can be in bad taste at times 

312.82 313.79 A: sure 

313.87 317.44 A: oh sure there again like you said all depends on how it's said 

314.80 323.85 B: course i try to explain to my sis- my best friend the [noise] only reason why i make the blonde jokes from because both of the men i was married to left me for younger blondes 

323.58 325.14 A: (( ah )) 

324.35 327.60 B: i feel i have a right to make [laughter] fun of blondes 

326.48 328.74 A: (( there you go [laughter] )) 

328.24 332.66 B: that's definitely a rationalization and i realize that 

331.38 334.29 A: yeah yeah 'cause not all blondes are that way but ah 

334.53 335.45 B: yeah 

334.63 336.96 A: i could see where that would come from yeah 

336.56 342.72 B: yeah but i mean you know my best friend has a bachelors degree in nursing ah so she's not stupid 

340.74 341.69 A: uh-huh 

342.53 345.11 A: no [mn] i'm a nurse as well so 

342.95 345.95 B: but she is subject to those little 

346.18 349.37 B: air pockets i guess you could say [laughter] of the brain 

349.46 350.98 A: yeah 

350.37 359.14 B: where i mean i even use the phrase oh i must have had a blonde attack you know but in a way that is humor that's in bad taste 

358.77 359.87 A: right 

359.31 363.37 B: 'cause just because somebody has blonde hair doesn't mean they're an airhead 

362.84 365.32 A: right exactly [mn] 

366.09 373.08 B: but let me see what else ah so did we really answer the question how do you draw a line between 

373.17 387.53 A: [mn] i don't know you know i mean like i said i know what my criteria is and stuff you know 'cause i don't want my kids growing up to do things you know i want them to be sensitive to how other people feel about things you know [mn] and we are 

385.06 386.07 B: right 

386.28 396.43 B: well let me ask you a question you know when your kids aren't there and when your mom's not around [mn] have you ever been you know whether it be watching listening to or whatever 

387.82 388.63 A: mhm 

389.89 390.64 A: (( mhm )) 

396.73 409.65 B: ah to comedy now you're by yourself no kids no mom have you ever been watching ah a comedy um and drew a line and said oh no i'm not going to watch that 

399.64 400.35 A: (( mm )) 

400.50 401.68 A: right 

408.90 410.26 A: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

409.96 413.25 B: well what was it that you were watching that made you draw that line 

412.58 417.47 A: well i- i- if it's very sexually explicit i don't listen to it 

417.20 418.19 B: okay 

417.72 422.80 A: you know and if it's something we are v- we are major churchgoers 

422.35 423.55 B: mhm 

422.82 423.82 A: [lipsmack] you know 

424.00 427.68 A: my husband was a deacon in the church for years and years and years and it's 

427.72 431.62 A: no you know if if their hu- their type of humor is 

431.73 435.39 A: degrading to my religion i'm not listening to it 

434.78 441.23 B: right yeah okay good i was just that was a personal curiosity question 

437.64 438.53 A: (( you know )) 

440.66 441.61 A: uh-huh 

441.27 443.76 B: if you'd ever been in the situation 

443.17 444.19 A: oh sure 

444.38 450.36 A: yeah you know and i mean a lot of the jokes are sexually explicit you know and they're f- they're funny 

450.07 451.15 B: yeah 

450.46 453.28 A: you know and like i sa- i am a nurse i'm you know so 

453.15 454.47 B: (( oh so am i )) 

454.30 456.32 A: (( you know are y- are you an l._p._n. )) 

456.15 457.42 B: i'm an r._n. 

457.12 458.06 A: me too 

458.00 459.40 B: oh okay

463.55 466.03 B: (( oh i i specialize in dialysis )) 

465.75 470.06 A: oh we get a lot of those in our i._m._c. units because of the potassium 

466.65 467.73 B: yeah 

468.74 470.51 B: (( so well i )) 

470.65 474.98 B: mean i've done some s._i._c._u. well of course i've 

475.34 480.68 B: i've worked in i probably think every available area that an r._n. can work in 

478.85 479.81 A: mhm 

480.64 484.32 A: [lipsmack] well you know nursing humor can be pretty um crude 

480.87 481.91 B: um 

484.59 488.21 B: ah aint that the truth [laughter] ha 

486.07 488.23 A: yeah [laughter] 

488.37 493.77 A: yeah you know 'cause we see it all and hear it all and yeah [laughter] [cough] 

489.44 490.56 B: yeah it 

492.09 493.05 B: yeah 

493.48 499.95 B: but you know a lot of times i mean ah if you're looking at the medical side of the medical humor 

497.53 498.09 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

499.58 500.49 A: (( uh-huh [lipsmack] )) 

500.10 504.93 B: a lot of times that humor is nothing more than a stress release 

504.75 513.31 A: oh sure oh yeah and a lot of the stuff that i will listen to or participate in at work i would never do outside of work 

512.90 518.88 B: yeah i ag- i agree with you there i agree with you just out of curiosity where do you live 

518.68 520.27 A: [lipsmack] central illinois 

520.50 522.35 B: oh really 

521.41 529.22 A: yeah we- right now i have no power i'm sitting on basement steps using my old telephone because my other one won't work [laughter] 

526.35 527.78 B: [laughter] 

528.99 529.71 B: (( yo- )) 

529.86 533.61 B: you're not in oh you don't you mean you don't have any electricity 

533.05 539.87 A: no we have no power we've had tornadoes and severe thunderstorms and flooding i barely got home from work fo- through the floods [lipsmack] 

538.56 550.40 B: well yeah i know that they were ta- 'cause ah my dad right now is in ah northern kentucky with my one of my sisters i was ah raised in northern kentucky like right across the river from cincinnati 

545.02 546.70 A: ah and where are you from 

549.77 550.73 A: oh uh-huh

560.02 561.50 B: twenty five years 

561.18 562.23 A: ah 

561.89 575.88 B: and ah but the advantage of that that specialty area is that even more so than like you know step down unit or ah i._c._u. there's such a demand for dialysis experienced nurses 

575.61 576.89 A: yeah 

576.29 585.03 B: that um you know i find it very easy and also essential that about every five years to take a break from it 

585.35 586.97 A: [lipsmack] i can imagine 

586.67 599.89 B: i mean there's a there's a high burn out level and in fact when i first got i- into it after the first year i said oh [mn] oh no this is too boring 'cause you see the same patients you do the same treatment they have the same pro 

596.97 598.25 A: (( day after day ))
