67.53 72.78 A: uh like i personally i agree with you sometimes i think it just depends on 

72.93 77.62 A: for me it depends on how like if i can tell if the person 

77.81 82.61 A: or telling a joke and trying to be humorous means it in a certain way 

82.59 93.53 A: but i also like i also think that humor is in bad taste when there's a whole lot of cursing or vulgarity in the humor you know what i'm saying 

92.99 94.23 B: mhm 

93.60 104.78 A: like i find that that obscures the point you know like i can't understand it i have to i think i have to sit through horrible english i can't understand that like 

103.27 104.70 B: mhm 

104.77 111.26 A: but what actually as you were saying i watched this movie um a few years ago called the other sister have you seen it 

110.72 112.73 B: no i haven't what is it about [noise] 

112.74 123.44 A: it's about um a girl well juliette lewis plays this like mentally retarded girl who lives in san francisco and it's supposed to be a romantic comedy 

118.73 120.05 B: mhm 

123.47 127.64 A: and this guy named um this actor named giovanni ribisi 

127.44 128.31 B: mhm 

127.83 131.06 A: played another retarded boy but like 

131.47 136.65 A: in the preview there were like there's a scene where they're trying to like 

136.69 144.25 A: establish like some relationship and so like an intimate relationship so they look through the book called the joy of sex 

144.24 145.11 B: mhm 

144.57 153.26 A: and um she's like oh well i like page one forty nine but i don't like page one sixty something and it was just really like 

153.51 162.80 A: [lipsmack] like i didn't think uh based on based on the previews alone i was like that's not funny i don't want to see that movie but then it came on regular cable and i watched it 

162.94 172.69 A: [lipsmack] and while i still didn't think it was funny i understood what the point was you know what i'm saying like i didn't think it was funny that they were making fun of 

169.17 170.28 B: mhm 

172.76 180.04 A: or that the movie mak- the film makers were making fun of the or trying to use the people's mental like

280.68 291.29 A: a lot of comedians and like jokes and everything have gotten more and more foul like it takes shocking people to make them laugh you know what i'm saying 

290.67 296.84 B: mhm oh the last time i was at the movies i just came from the movie identity and it's about this guy with a multiple personality disorder 

291.45 292.52 A: whereas 

296.77 298.11 A: oh really 

297.04 305.96 B: and people were getting violently murdered and every every time someone was murdered they were laughing i i felt like yelling shut up how stupid are they you know that's not that's not funny 

304.42 315.93 A: yes exactly exactly you know you'll be sitting there and like that i think you know with the mov- and whatever movies people think certain things are funny whereas 

314.83 319.69 B: yeah it makes you worry look what they're desensitized to it at an early age that's probably why [laughter] 

319.06 320.50 A: well you said what 

320.11 323.61 B: well they're desensitized to it at an early age they see all this violence 

322.29 325.42 A: of course of course and you know like 

324.35 325.85 B: that's probably it 

325.83 334.17 A: what is that channel that um [lipsmack] was it ren and stimpy no it yes ren and stimpy and then the little simpsons cartoon 

333.81 336.49 B: i don't know i don't watch that [laughter] 

335.46 345.29 A: oh okay well there's this like car- i watch a lot of toons [laughter] there's this cartoon on the simpsons and like the ch- the little characters are always killing each other 

345.40 346.92 A: and like uh that 

345.57 349.36 B: and little kids are watching this so that's really good for them [laughter] 

348.36 360.07 A: exactly and you know the simpsons has been on for like twelve years so just think about it that's like almost nearly an entire generation of children or of people who 

357.81 361.53 B: mhm that explains it very well [laughter] 

360.42 372.19 A: exactly who've grown up seeing like oh it's funny to kill someone i mean like wylie coyote and little road runner that was tame compared to some of the stuff that's in cartoons these days 

372.38 376.42 A: you know i mean like just think about where the world is going to be 

375.88 381.51 B: yeah i well i [laughter] i'm afraid to [laughter] [laughter] 

377.00 378.17 A: [laughter] 

378.24 389.91 A: [laughter] i know [laughter] [laughter] things are just so like you really have to be like oh my goodness if i ever have children what is going to be funny to them like oh no there should be no television 

388.59 399.26 B: well hopefully uh they'll uh they'll have my exact sentiments [laughter] and they'll they'll think everything else says uh i don't agree with it it's no good [laughter] [laughter] but it doesn't work that way 

393.63 394.51 A: [laughter] 

396.69 398.87 A: yes i know 

399.46 401.91 A: i know oh my goodness i mean 

402.48 408.21 A: i think that has something to do it definitely has to have something to do with probably like television and everything 

407.31 408.23 B: mhm 

408.13 418.19 A: because i know when i grew up i used to read a lot and i don't remember like thinking that certain things that my friends thought were funny i don't remember thinking that was funny because 

417.00 418.86 B: you sound a lot like me 

418.73 420.45 A: yeah [laughter] 

419.21 427.44 B: yeah i used to get made fun of 'cause i i i knew like i i would read stuff over the summer and knew the answers on the first day and see i'd read science books over the summer and like they made fun of that 

427.47 429.92 A: oh yeah like i didn't well 

428.40 432.21 B: you know what that's all right i'll make a lot more money reading my science books [laughter] 

431.24 437.95 A: right you know like i'm well like i'm an english teacher so i would always read the novels and everything 

436.64 437.93 B: exactly 

438.05 439.85 A: but it's still like 

439.92 446.37 A: reading er to me you know you know since this whole new sophisticated world of humor 

444.81 447.43 B: you sound very cool [laughter] 

446.56 455.64 A: you know [laughter] but like this whole thing now with the television like now i'm making up for not having a television when i was younger 

454.37 458.17 B: oh yeah i watch television constantly it's on now i have it on mute so i can hear you [laughter] 

457.65 472.05 A: oh right i turned mine off [laughter] so um yeah i just i'm just confused as to like uh what i don't know what people are thinking when they let their kids watch the stuff when they when like i don't know 

471.03 475.92 B: i don't know i i've been to r. rated movies and i saw little kids in the audience i just don't understand it 

475.39 483.75 A: of course of course like i went to see the wild thornberrys i don't know if you know what that was but it's like this nickelodeon movie 

483.72 492.95 A: and i thought it was so funny but the kids in the audience were laughing at like what i felt were the wrong parts of the movie you know when there's 

492.97 496.18 A: something violent coming up or something that should be sad 

495.21 497.67 B: that is a very very bad sign 

497.53 509.45 A: right you know like mm right of course it is i was like no no children we're supposed to be laughing when the parents are making jokes not when the elephants are about to die you [laughter] know like 

498.26 499.76 B: (( [laughter] yes it is )) 

508.58 518.19 B: it is that is a very frightening prospect i think the uh my profession is going to be very lucrative 'cause i'm studying to be a psychiatrist [laughter] i think i'm gonna have a lot of patients 

514.55 515.53 A: right 

516.19 517.69 A: (( oh of course )) 

518.16 525.78 A: of course of course because the children now growing up now are going to be totally confused as to [laughter] what is hilarious 

523.98 525.05 B: right 

525.18 529.01 B: is it you mean it's not okay to kill my mommy [laughter] 

527.68 539.77 A: you'd be right exactly you know wasn't it funny laughing and carrying on in fact i don't know well you you're in philadelphia did you hear like the little sniper boy or whatever thought it was funny that he killed someone 

539.38 540.80 B: that's horrible 

539.79 547.77 A: well right he was like laughing about it and i i was like i fail to understand what is funny about that i just 

546.67 549.51 B: does he understand that this is not a movie [laughter] 

549.15 554.49 A: uh yeah exactly but you know he probably somebody's probably asking him telling him 

550.52 551.64 B: uh-huh 

554.31 565.65 A: trying to give him or his family millions of dollars to write his little stories for to for made for television movie and you know that'll feature prominently the part where he confessed it and is laughing 

565.55 567.11 B: mhm 

565.69 569.29 A: i just don't understand i'm so [laughter] like 

569.32 575.53 A: disturbed by that seriously i don't know i think it'll take like something major for where 

576.16 587.39 A: for people to think that you know normal stuff is funny [laughter] different things that are supposed to be funny are humorous i think it'll take like people to finally get disgusted by hearing 

579.92 581.15 B: mhm 

587.44 592.89 A: cur- cursed words and people talking about peoples' sexuality or ethnicity or 

592.58 599.89 B: that's right i mean like i mean i use it when i'm angry but some people use it uh they n- they just never stop i fucking went to the movies i fucking came home i fuck- you know [laughter]
