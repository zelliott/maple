24.10 27.39 A: yeah yeah how do you draw the line as to 

27.57 29.58 A: what you like and what you don't like 

27.92 28.95 B: y- y- 

29.61 31.85 B: (( yeah i think )) 

32.27 40.72 B: for you know good taste of humor that you can find some wise idea wise opinion 

40.46 41.65 A: mhm 

41.66 43.58 B: not only some kind of 

45.12 47.17 B: joke that is you know 

47.06 48.32 A: yeah 

48.24 57.13 A: i tend to like more jokes that everyone can associate with you know a lot of them i kind of feel sorry for comedians sometimes 'cause 

52.96 54.77 B: yeah 

57.00 63.62 A: you almost wonder if they're going to get shot when they go back to their car [laughter] you know 'cos they they get so offensive sometimes to different 

64.16 67.45 B: yeah and that's some comedy 

65.15 65.99 A: rude 

68.14 79.37 B: some comedy and they just want to make you laugh you know that's make you laugh but after after laughing you've got nothing but some different ah when you laugh 

71.06 72.47 A: exactly 

79.47 87.95 B: you can learn something you know from you know from the talk between the actors actor and actress so 

88.14 94.35 B: [mn] i think maybe their ideas are wise i just call it wise you know 

93.92 94.99 A: mhm 

94.61 98.74 B: and it's kind of lesson from life so 

98.98 101.50 B: so i think this kind of 

101.88 105.46 B: humor must be good taste so 

105.89 107.42 B: but you know some 

107.47 116.77 B: for otherwise some other comedy it's just kind of wrong just to want to make you laugh say some bad words and you know 

116.92 126.34 B: [laughter] if all we laugh they laughed first so [laughter] yeah so it 

121.65 124.89 A: (( [noise] yeah it always make you feel better [laughter] )) 

126.37 135.27 B: just as they want to force you to laugh not want to you know laugh from your heart your inner part your heart 

134.94 136.05 A: mhm 

135.39 137.86 B: so ah so i think 

138.04 140.32 B: [lipsmack] can judge this 

140.44 141.37 B: is 

141.48 144.21 B: you know is kind of criteria to 

144.29 151.45 B: judge it is good taste or bad taste just of humor or just a k- kind of common joke joke or 

151.17 152.72 A: yeah something that 

151.84 155.31 B: something like this yeah so 

153.04 154.03 A: yeah 

155.43 158.76 B: (( you know it's kind of h- har- hard to to ))

163.65 164.65 A: yeah i 

164.30 169.15 B: sometimes you know most of the times it always makes you laugh

274.17 275.25 B: [laughter] 

275.99 277.15 B: (( you )) 

277.83 284.18 B: say you and you may think oh if i laugh i will feel much so stupid 

284.34 285.36 B: you know 

284.47 286.15 A: [laughter] mhm mhm 

285.43 286.46 B: (( so you )) 

287.10 299.94 B: that that is so bad so so low if you laugh yeah it's kind of oh i just think of myself as so st- stupid if i i laugh too 

297.45 298.76 A: [laughter] 

299.67 300.89 A: mhm 

300.26 305.53 B: no no not this is not me i think [laughter] 

304.26 309.86 A: i've done that before if i don't really get a joke but everyone else is laughing and i figure i better laugh now 

309.74 310.99 B: [laughter] 

310.04 312.24 A: [laughter] you know even though i didn't 

312.47 314.89 A: get the joke originally or whatever 

315.08 320.96 B: yeah because you know in in nowadays a t._v. show there's always kind of 

321.24 322.99 B: ways of laughing 

322.93 324.06 A: mhm 

323.29 327.42 B: it seems and just um you know from from the t._v. 

327.60 333.84 B: so so sometimes you think it's not it's not humorous 

333.93 341.25 B: it's only just like a joke but you know there's always some kind of laughing sound in the t._v. from the t._v. 

340.92 342.00 A: yeah 

341.42 347.61 B: and there maybe you think it is disgusting because you don't think it you don't think it is 

347.67 351.41 B: interesting or or humorous but they always 

351.56 354.03 B: laughing sound so 

355.08 365.99 B: the things like director of the t._v. show want to force you to laugh so it's and it's k- i think it's it's a bad experience bad feeling 

360.29 361.44 A: (( mhm mm mm )) 

366.06 366.84 B: so 

367.59 378.58 B: just if like maybe a director thinks the audience are so stupid [laughter] sometimes i think so because you know [mn] maybe they thinking 

379.53 382.36 B: humorous but i don't i don't think so 

382.54 383.70 B: (( it's going )) 

382.56 385.05 A: you think it goes too far sometimes 

384.85 386.75 B: yeah so 

386.99 388.83 A: depending on the situation 

388.47 402.57 B: yes depending on the situation so because you know everyone has his own judgment yeah maybe i'm i can judge it it's humorous or not it's laughing or 

388.85 389.79 A: yeah 

402.83 404.72 B: it's kind of you know 

404.85 414.87 B: um humorous or just a joke or just a [lipsmack] very very wrong [laughter] or if there you know dirty joke so 

414.40 415.59 A: mhm 

414.95 422.33 B: if it is humorous i will laugh if if it is not i won't and i will feel 

422.47 423.19 B: oh 

423.76 424.61 B: you are 

424.69 427.32 B: (( [laughter] yeah uh-huh )) 

425.62 433.99 A: yeah i think you find the more risque stuff kind of when you pay for it yourself you know like when you go to a comedy club they tend to be more 

430.64 431.83 B: yeah 

434.31 435.94 A: (( i don't know questionable )) 

435.94 437.86 B: yeah 

435.97 437.19 A: rather than 

438.41 441.59 A: just sort of you know a the t._v. or something 

441.76 446.33 B: yeah i think it especially for the more educated person 

446.28 447.54 A: yeah 

446.53 448.07 B: yeah and 

448.21 459.72 B: maybe they will ask such kind of question more often than common people because m maybe they like to think about everything think about a joke [laughter] 

458.52 463.57 A: well yeah they can get more into political stuff you know you know and um 

461.65 464.45 B: (( yeah sort of political stuff mm )) 

464.65 477.31 B: because some common people maybe you know [laughter] i'm not kind of discrimination i just want to mention maybe the people that are less educated ah want to just ah [lipsmack] 

477.73 486.19 B: maybe follow watching t._v. say to t._v. ask to do v- it they didn't like to think about 

480.40 481.33 A: yeah 

486.20 496.25 B: everything they just oh yeah the t._v. said the t._v. says so ah that that must be right so you know [laughter] 

492.96 494.16 A: mhm 

494.58 497.71 A: and just don't question things they say oh a lot of t._v. 

496.77 499.29 B: (( no they didn't ask question )) 

500.49 505.72 B: in fact they didn't ask they just sort of it it must be right 

502.34 503.37 A: mhm 

504.84 505.94 A: mhm 

506.23 509.87 B: in fact [mn] it is not so 

510.24 524.11 B: so i think mm each person every person may ask question may you know judge the problem judge of the situation by him or hi- herself so not just kind of follow 

524.20 527.11 B: (( follow what the t._v. said or not )) 

524.22 525.15 A: yeah 

526.92 528.12 A: yeah it's all 

528.13 530.36 A: individualized i guess as to 

528.53 529.35 B: so 

529.37 531.60 B: yeah yeah yeah that's true 

531.72 536.94 A: background and all that what you may find's offensive someone else may not you know 

531.73 532.63 B: that's true 

536.84 550.24 B: yeah so i think this is very important so otherwise every person has the same idea same opinion that's kind of disaster [laughter] yeah 

546.89 548.15 A: mhm 

549.01 554.93 A: which is i guess why the comedians have their own little individual followings you know certain people like certain comedians 

554.70 557.16 B: yeah 

556.75 560.13 A: i can pretty much tolerate any of them but i have to be in the mood for 'em 

560.03 561.44 B: [laughter] 

561.87 569.82 B: yeah but yeah so some ah some comedians actually are very great i think yeah so 

567.96 569.10 A: mhm 

570.23 571.86 A: (( who are some of your favorites )) 

571.74 573.05 B: yeah they they 

573.17 577.28 B: if you you know for a common joke if you watch the 

577.23 589.30 B: this at first time maybe you will laugh but when you meet at the second time yeah you think oh no i won't feel won't laugh again but you know for the [lipsmack] good taste ah 

579.56 580.43 A: mhm 

586.41 587.46 A: right 

589.83 597.15 B: humor you will laugh again again again because you know it's kind of like mm maybe 

597.63 598.69 B: you think ah
