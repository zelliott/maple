31.70 32.83 A: humor 

33.28 36.75 A: well i mean you really can't draw a line with humor

41.37 49.29 A: but certain things that people think is other people think is funny it might be funny it might not be funny to you and the 

50.00 51.12 A: same thing 

51.51 54.95 A: with anything else so you can't draw a line i don't think 

56.12 63.04 B: do you do you have like any preferences when it comes to humor like anyone that you listen to like i don't know who your favorite

82.03 82.64 A: (( yeah )) 

82.51 88.99 B: he he's the only guy that i know that would actually touch subjects on things that most people wouldn't even think to do i mean 

88.78 89.74 A: mhm 

89.11 98.65 B: 'cause it's so far far out there that you know it's just someone who's just walking in to watching it they're like well what- what's going on you know i don't understand 

97.70 98.77 A: right 

98.69 101.04 B: 'cause he he just comes out of nowhere 

101.18 103.91 A: yeah but he can make serious things funny 

103.72 105.38 B: oh oh yeah 

104.38 107.35 A: i think that's that's that's what so good about 

107.14 109.67 B: yeah that that's personally what i think i mean 

109.79 110.37 A: (( him )) 

110.40 117.83 B: there was this one i mean he was talking about sesame street and um i turned around just like what what how is he doing this you know 

118.07 118.67 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

118.45 124.17 B: i mean he is by far one of the best ones to come out today it's just it's amazing to me 

124.04 125.25 A: mhm 

125.83 126.98 B: (( but like )) 

127.00 128.10 B: (( i don't know like )) 

128.84 133.47 B: do you think that like most comedy is acceptable in the way it's pre- like presented 

134.13 134.87 A: (( mm mm )) 

136.28 137.10 A: no 

136.94 137.85 B: (( no [mn] )) 

138.65 139.92 B: (( like what do you mean )) 

140.24 141.94 A: (( [mn] it's like i don't i don't )) 

142.02 144.30 A: (( like i said before you )) 

144.32 149.81 A: me personally i don't think they should draw any line i guess if somebody was getting like 

149.87 152.70 A: actually were getting hurt by something that's 

153.10 154.59 B: it's true i mean 

153.72 156.88 A: when they could draw the line but other than that get 

157.33 159.28 A: (( over it make people laugh )) 

159.08 163.88 B: just go [laughter] like i i personally don't think there should be a line 

160.80 162.00 A: yeah 

164.04 172.89 B: ah i think that no matter what like my honest opinion is if that person finds humor in it more power to 'em because 

173.13 176.51 B: you know there's gotta be some other people out there that think it's funny 

176.40 177.42 A: mhm 

176.90 180.60 B: i i just like the only thing that i don't agree with is if 

180.91 185.00 B: they're talking about something that like might hurt someone else that they know 

184.83 185.74 A: right 

185.25 188.52 B: like that's the only time i don't agree with it and i think it's wrong 

188.36 189.27 A: right 

188.76 194.94 B: you know 'cause sometimes like they'll bring in like their ex girlfriends or whatever and you know it it kind of sucks because 

194.62 195.90 A: yeah 

195.27 198.35 B: you could be that person and you turn around and you just like 

198.49 200.42 B: (( why [laughter] you know )) 

199.42 201.25 A: (( why is he talking about me )) 

200.72 203.70 B: yeah like thanks a lot [laughter] 

204.41 206.92 A: (( i didn't even think they thought like that )) 

206.56 211.17 B: oh yeah exactly it's like you know last think you knew they're you know things were 

211.61 224.23 B: decent or whatever but i think that that's the only line that i would think would should not be crossed is if it's about someone like someone that you have a relationship with or like if it was a family member 

224.16 225.05 A: (( [laughter] [mn] mm )) 

224.69 228.09 B: and i mean i just don't think that's fair at all to that person 

228.19 231.18 A: right personal no personal stuff 

228.73 229.87 B: but i mean 

230.85 245.72 B: exactly but i think that's also why i really like dave chappelle is like 'cause he's so open minded abut everything and you know he has his limits and he he but at other times he does like to exceed it i mean 

240.31 241.58 A: (( right [mn] )) 

244.34 245.32 A: mhm 

245.82 252.57 B: the whole there was the one episode like i watched and he went on about like the k._k._k. and i was i was shocked 

252.34 253.48 A: (( [laughter] no )) 

253.09 255.37 B: i i don't know if you saw that one but 

254.78 256.68 A: (( i didn't see that one [mn] [laughter] )) 

256.04 260.91 B: oh goodness it was it was something that i did not expect to see 

260.83 262.01 A: [laughter] 

261.10 264.63 B: it had to be like the funniest episode yet though i mean 

264.96 267.24 B: (( i i turned around like who )) 

266.37 269.82 A: i can just imagine him doing something like that that's why it's 

268.82 271.33 B: oh [laughter] 

270.71 272.22 A: so weird 

271.80 277.08 B: it's hilarious though just the fact that he can he can poke fun at humor that like 

277.28 279.32 B: you know i i think it's because 

279.17 288.11 B: maybe because like his ethnicity you know and it's like it's easier for him to poke fun at it [mn] but he turns around he turns it around and makes it towards himself 

281.94 283.05 A: mhm 

284.58 285.39 A: right 

288.04 294.95 B: you know so like he doesn't cross any barriers or any lines with it and and i i think that's why he's such a great guy i mean 

288.19 289.15 A: (( right mhm )) 

295.45 297.35 B: i just think it's awesome 

297.24 299.56 A: (( [mn] right i think that he is too )) 

300.19 301.08 B: um 

300.28 302.17 A: (( and who else )) 

302.68 305.36 A: who else is like that that can be funny 

308.09 308.89 B: like 

308.12 309.10 A: i think 

309.98 312.16 A: maybe jamie fox maybe 

311.77 315.36 B: yeah sometimes yeah he's up there definitely 

312.19 313.03 A: (( sometimes )) 

315.33 316.60 A: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

315.97 317.49 B: [laughter] 

317.51 318.34 B: i i 

318.40 322.14 B: i don't know like i mean even his show is pretty funny but 

322.33 327.34 B: that's the only time i've i don't think i've ever i can ever recall like seeing him on stand up or anything 

327.73 328.60 A: (( ahah )) 

328.47 330.79 B: but i i do think he's a funny guy

427.44 428.67 A: [laughter] 

434.69 435.82 A: mhm 

435.36 441.50 B: you know it's it's just an eye opener and it it it's definitely evolved from what it used to be 

441.38 442.34 A: right 

441.79 452.98 B: you know i- it's not that dry it's actually like it's just yeah it- it's completely in your face these days and it's like if you can't accept it then there's gotta be something wrong 

445.11 446.10 A: funny 

446.12 447.54 A: [laughter] 

452.86 454.19 A: [mn] with you

458.10 460.02 B: exactly and 

459.13 463.41 A: but like that's that show jackass that goes too far

467.79 468.73 A: (( [laughter] that )) 

468.89 471.37 A: goes a little bit too far [laughter] 

471.13 472.12 B: well 

472.01 473.74 A: the things that they do 

473.08 475.50 B: [laughter] 

474.85 475.89 A: i don't 

476.25 478.72 A: i'm like ooh that's just really disgusting 

478.59 481.68 B: i- if they find humor in in their own 

481.97 485.82 B: their own physical harm then more power to 'em i mean 

485.25 485.93 A: yeah 

486.40 491.54 A: there's one episode that they keep showing about the boy beating up his dad 

491.74 495.17 B: (( [laughter] yeah yeah yeah )) 

493.97 502.97 A: (( his dad doesn't do anything to him he all of a sudden he just started whipping the crap out of him and they're just like why is he doing that to his dad mm oh yeah ))

511.04 519.72 B: and i think it's the guy's name is rob himself is what they call him and i mean it's an ongoing thing and i i think it's funny in the sense that 

519.98 522.69 B: they have the balls to do it you know 

523.08 531.38 B: but at the same time i'm just like why why go why push the limit why hurt yourself like that you know 

529.97 531.02 A: right 

531.76 533.62 A: you could actually hurt yourself 

533.20 534.53 B: exactly 

534.02 535.34 A: [laughter] 

534.55 540.78 B: i i mean i've met i've met the two two guys rob and chad at a concert and you know 

540.82 548.08 B: just aside from all the crap that they've done they're really down to earth guys they just got a couple of screws loose up there because of it 

547.76 548.75 A: [laughter] 

548.50 561.22 B: you know a- and it's it's just a trip i i mean just to think that people can actually do that to themselves and then like have like so many people go out there and buy their their movies and 

552.67 553.50 A: (( [laughter] )) 

560.58 561.65 A: right 

561.15 565.64 B: just eat it up like it's candy you know it's dis- it's almost disgusting 

565.43 566.64 A: mhm 

565.73 567.57 B: [laughter] 

567.46 568.08 A: (( mm )) 

567.64 569.71 B: but i i mean 

569.97 584.08 B: i i couldn't ever find myself in that situation i mean so there's definitely some kind of thing that's wrong in that kind of humor but [mn] ah if they if they like hurting themselves then go for it [mn] i guess but 

582.99 583.89 A: (( right you )) 

584.27 587.59 B: what am i going to do about it [laughter] 

586.57 593.83 A: can't do anything about it that's what i mean that's that's all that humor thing can't draw the line 

593.67 595.34 B: exactly i mean 

595.86 599.95 B: i i totally can understand that i mean i i just don't think there should be a line
