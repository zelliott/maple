15.85 18.96 B: okay have you have you idea what we're supposed to do 

19.00 30.70 A: ah yeah we talk about the topics for at least eight minutes they said but it was um humor like ah yeah how can you like where do you draw the line between it being inappropriate and appropriate 

24.15 25.33 B: comedy 

31.33 32.28 A: i guess 

32.52 33.76 B: (( okay [noise] )) 

32.63 34.43 A: (( that's what the topic was )) 

34.67 35.78 A: um 

35.99 40.37 A: [mn] firstly i'd just say like if i depending upon the situation you know like 

40.75 46.41 A: where you're at and stuff like that if you're at a business party you don't want to be telling vulgar jokes or 

46.71 50.21 A: (( such i don't know [laughter] )) 

50.47 51.13 B: (( i )) 

52.16 55.05 B: wonder if they mean like on television or 

52.31 53.31 A: (( you know )) 

55.30 56.35 A: (( yeah i )) 

55.44 58.51 B: just in comedy in general or what 

58.04 59.21 A: (( don't know )) 

58.96 60.97 B: i'm not too too 

61.53 66.18 B: got my ah confirmation number back on the email 

66.09 67.32 A: mhm 

67.05 72.46 B: and then all of a sudden my phone just rang tonight and it's like whoa weird [laughter] [sigh] 

70.88 77.27 A: yeah that happened to me too the first day it was like the first time like i said that i was when they called 

77.72 79.81 A: also it was kind of weird [mn] 

80.49 87.76 B: okay but i agree with you on business shows and stuff like that where there's no children 

88.00 92.02 B: then i can tolerate a little bit more than i can on television 

88.25 88.90 A: yeah 

92.11 93.24 A: mhm 

92.84 96.98 B: on comedy club and and h._b._o. and stuff ah 

97.00 99.91 B: i prefer humor without the four letter word in 

100.04 101.11 A: yeah 

101.00 105.92 B: [laughter] so honestly i like the old humor of like red skelton 

106.16 107.64 A: well i think that 

106.35 107.35 B: um 

108.35 110.98 B: yeah without eddie murphy being 

108.49 109.55 A: (( but um )) 

110.99 112.98 B: m. f. and every other word 

113.70 117.51 A: yeah i think and i think that like humor that doesn't have to depend upon 

117.53 123.39 A: vulgarities or embarrassing situations is more sophisticated and intelligent than 

124.68 130.38 A: like humor that just is like for shock value you know 

129.45 131.41 B: right exactly 

130.62 135.34 A: you know a it takes more it takes more of a wit to do that you know 

132.70 133.83 B: can be 

135.49 139.40 B: sinbad can be good and so can robin williams 

137.67 138.79 A: mhm 

139.42 142.08 B: but at some point they draw the line too 

142.10 143.31 A: yeah 

143.10 145.00 B: whereas george carlin 

145.56 148.92 B: my husband likes him i'm not thrilled with him 

149.21 150.22 A: mhm 

149.51 151.45 B: because of the language 

154.04 158.74 A: yeah i wonder if it's like different between men and women too like how much they 

159.16 162.31 A: they accept how much they don't you know like 

162.92 170.90 A: because it's always funny like when when like my little brother he's always like running around like doing gross stuff and so maybe it just carries on and there's ah 

171.26 172.36 A: um 

172.58 175.38 A: [lipsmack] like increased you know when they get older 

175.71 176.29 A: [mn] 

176.65 182.60 B: [noise] and it gets worse too [laughter] too 

178.88 181.38 A: yeah [laughter] 

181.78 184.67 A: more and more extreme as they get older and older 

183.79 192.08 B: right you know it used to be funny when when guys would sit there and just make you know crude remarks but now they make crude hand signals and 

191.95 193.00 A: mhm 

192.10 194.34 B: body language and stuff too it's 

194.98 197.10 A: and and they find it funny but lots of 

197.20 199.52 A: ah it's not you know like 

199.76 200.89 A: (( i don't know )) 

200.06 201.48 B: (( embarrassing )) 

201.82 204.07 A: (( exactly i don't think so )) 

204.52 205.84 B: you know um 

208.24 214.43 B: men used to be that they would watch what they say around women now they just don't care 

213.21 215.14 A: now mhm 

214.72 218.39 B: but i think a lot of it's on the women too because they tolerate it 

218.08 219.47 A: exactly 

219.90 228.22 B: you know where i'll get up and walk away or just like leave the conversation or throw this look like h- hum enough 

225.51 226.45 A: yeah 

229.14 230.86 B: women do that well too 

231.69 232.90 A: yeah

235.12 235.68 A: (( [mn] )) 

238.70 241.37 B: there's not too much humor on t._v. 

241.44 244.34 B: with kids that doesn't have the violence in it 

243.92 244.97 A: mhm 

244.98 246.87 B: or even in shows
