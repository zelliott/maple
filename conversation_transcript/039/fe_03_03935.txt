291.37 292.43 A: yeah 

298.77 299.52 A: (( uh )) 

300.55 307.39 B: or anything about him but he did a lot of dirty jokes you know what i mean i i now 

301.87 302.81 A: yeah 

304.78 305.85 A: yeah 

306.41 318.52 A: i ah ah i'm not particularly a fan of that kind of comedy i i i rather like comedy of the kind you know which is universal any age group would like to appreciate 

310.30 311.19 B: okay 

318.69 328.80 B: now here's one that you may know and i don't know because ah it is red fox red fox had many many ah dirty comedy albums 

328.22 331.52 A: yes ah i i i i know about it 

330.92 339.94 B: yeah and i only heard maybe his jokes but i never did hear his his albums but h- he had a great business going there [laughter] 

338.98 344.11 A: um well maybe from business point of view yes but my personal opinion 

342.31 346.89 B: albums very successful route his albums going out and everything like that 

346.29 347.50 A: i beg your pardon 

347.23 351.59 B: he had a lot of very successful ah dirty albums you know 

351.37 353.11 A: (( ah yes um [mn] )) 

353.35 365.08 A: those those are definitely bad but as i said you see um anything which is said ah maybe as a humor but if it if it offends anybody's feelings or 

364.92 369.15 A: you know tries to um sort of 

368.58 371.47 B: hurt them right mhm 

369.35 374.59 A: yeah th- th- that ah to me is not that really acceptable 

375.09 376.22 B: well 

376.09 384.65 B: ah i see it all the time ah where the black comedian says black jokes to the black audience 

384.29 385.55 A: yeah yeah 

384.44 395.62 B: but they're they're not offended with it yet you can't cross the line and you know say something to another race if you were a am i right about that 

395.02 396.19 A: yip yip 

396.43 401.11 A: you're right but um you know ah you have this um wonderful 

401.19 407.29 A: night show ah here even he's not exactly a comedian but um 

407.35 413.33 A: um you know the one that comes um jay leno that's right yeah and ah 

411.06 413.09 B: oh yeah uh-huh he's a s- 

413.19 423.07 A: i i do appreciate ah um quite a bit of his humor but sometimes i feel that the sarcasm in it um goes a little beyond the limit 

423.44 436.55 B: yeah well he's w- a true stand up comic and that and that's very difficult because ah it's ah tr- you know training and and practice now of course robin williams you know robin williams 

426.11 426.94 A: yeah 

435.88 437.06 A: yeah yeah i do 

436.86 440.04 B: now he's like a natural 

440.12 449.75 B: ah comic he just never stops [laughter] y- you know what i mean and that's very ah unique his ah comedy ability but he's also a great actor too 

442.88 443.85 A: uh-huh 

449.06 454.27 A: yeah yeah yeah you're right um and um 

454.34 469.31 A: mm you know um there was this other wonderful actor i'm forgetting his name again because most of these movies i have seen in the nineties and the eighties so i i tend to remember more of those names like tom hanks and 

464.49 465.49 B: mhm 

469.27 479.11 A: other things but in case of jay leno ah one thing that i like is about you know he picks up topics which are quite contemporary you know very current 

478.23 480.64 B: right yeah up to date mhm 

479.57 486.48 A: yeah up to date and ah even his presentation is quite up to date he he takes pains to 

486.04 489.60 B: would how do you compare him to letterman ah his competition 

489.79 498.82 A: ah well um equally i [laughter] the there there's ah i would rather still prefer jay leno 

492.02 493.00 B: (( [laughter] )) 

499.22 500.42 B: yeah well i guess that ah 

500.20 503.56 B: like to me letterman's a stand up comic 

503.33 516.79 B: ah um well not a stand up comic but he's more of being stupid saying doing things stupid things you know where leno is really a a stand up comic ah which you see in a regular comedy show and comedy club 

509.52 510.89 A: right 

515.35 524.91 A: yeah yip ah th- that's true um here um even sometimes when i watch the oprah winfrey shows 

524.54 525.58 B: mhm 

524.95 529.71 A: um yeah i i do appreciate some of the humor there also 

529.47 537.07 B: well what do you as a guy to a guy and guys tell dirty jokes what do you think about dirty jokes [laughter] from guy to guy from guy to guy 

532.85 533.72 A: yeah 

535.00 542.22 A: dirty jokes are f- dirty jokes are fine but as i said er only in that circle which can appreciate them 

539.41 540.28 B: would you 

541.49 545.20 B: well would you tell a dirty joke if there was a woman by 

544.62 557.90 A: no i i i would ah i i would certainly ah restrict myself but yes if guys are sitting around and um they they're able to establish a rapport among themselves there's a drink going on 

545.32 546.00 B: (( okay )) 

557.73 560.97 A: why not er er er humor's the spice of life 

560.81 562.53 B: yeah it's quite interesting ah 

561.99 563.29 A: yeah 

562.95 575.13 B: there are some really interesting ah you know jokes ah ah and you know i i was reading a book on how to tell a joke in the essence of what jokes are and a good joke is when you 

572.56 573.45 A: yes 

575.02 582.61 B: ah change the ending and it's completely what the person didn't think ah the ending would be 

580.91 589.24 A: that's true the the the unexpected nature ah actually adds to the the thrill of the joke 

589.27 597.11 A: ah you know ah person is not able to anticipate and all of a sudden you know mm ah it's boxed them up you know [mn] 

596.01 599.89 B: well h- okay i'll i'll do it real quick it's a real quick joke
