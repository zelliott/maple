0.20 1.85 A: hi i'm steve 

1.56 3.05 B: (( hi i'm tasha )) 

3.56 4.41 A: (( tasha )) 

4.32 5.38 B: yeah 

5.21 6.69 A: well good evening 

6.61 8.28 B: good evening how's it going 

7.82 12.37 A: okay [laughter] i think that's a really tough topic 

12.88 15.44 B: what kind of comedy is appropriate 

14.99 16.49 A: mhm 

16.44 18.92 B: wow wanna start [laughter] 

18.27 29.53 A: [laughter] well i- i think it's tough because it all depends on how well you know somebody ah as it just depends on what's considered offensive 

25.47 26.96 B: [noise] that's true 

29.58 34.13 A: and you don't know what's offensive unless you know what someone's background is 

34.19 35.83 B: that's very true 

36.24 48.71 B: that's very very true i've definitely um i've been to see some comedians and i've seen some that are like i went to see jamie fox once with my boyfriend um and 

46.62 47.53 A: mhm 

48.87 50.53 B: and not only was it 

50.96 54.04 B: off- offensive because a lot of it was um 

54.35 58.94 B: [mn] it was racist but you know racist against whites which is fine you know fine 

58.97 71.16 B: um that's i guess the audience that he plays to but it wasn't funny so it was horrible like we spent all this money to go see him and we were like oh this is terrible 

64.00 64.95 A: mhm 

72.40 73.56 B: but um 

72.56 85.10 A: yeah it's real tough the fine line between making fun of a a group of people and making fun of what we know about a group of people ah and um 

85.32 91.72 A: yeah i think there there may be a few things you can draw the line on ah you know ah making fun of ah 

93.45 94.83 A: [sigh] 

95.12 102.98 A: well i say racism is- isn't funny but um i r- i mean i know i've heard funny routines about racism so it's 

101.60 103.67 B: (( [mn] yeah totally )) 

103.16 105.45 A: just a matter of how it's done i guess 

105.29 108.95 B: right very much so um i've definitely heard 

109.08 110.05 B: (( um )) 

110.15 123.54 B: y- a r- yeah a comedy routines with like a racial spin on them they're hilarious but they're not in such a way that's offensive like i i've also gone to see comedians where maybe they'll make fun at they'll make racist jokes 

121.82 123.15 A: i'm on the phone nancy [noise] 

124.39 125.80 B: i'm sorry can you hear me 

125.38 126.78 A: yeah 

126.23 129.53 B: okay they'll make jokes but they'll make 'em about everyone 

129.61 136.53 B: you know i- they don't just single out one particular group um rather they you know 

133.58 134.45 A: (( mhm of )) 

137.39 142.11 B: every group they kind of you know make fun of and play on including their own 

142.32 149.71 B: so i think that's usually you know the best way to go about that kind of humor but um 

149.43 157.59 A: course that's how it all started years ago ah at least in america in vaudeville they did they made fun of you know ah 

158.71 165.12 A: ah four or five groups and and at that time it was considered acceptable but um 

165.19 166.98 A: and of course i i don't know 

167.24 169.16 A: i- in other cultures 

169.49 174.88 A: do people make fun of like do the indians make fun of the pakistanis do the 

174.94 188.44 A: do the the kurds make fun of the iraqis or is it you know i- is it just americana or western european that have done these slighted jokes ah 

187.56 188.76 B: you know i'm 

188.81 190.83 B: i'm a little sure of that 

190.90 199.77 B: um as far as like one group verse to another but um my dad's friend um like a caribbean culture south american 

199.41 200.50 A: mhm 

199.82 202.10 B: and um like 

202.14 206.01 B: poking fun at each other is very much part of the culture ah 

205.97 211.94 B: like if you're overweight they'll they they nickname you if you're a woman they call you fat cow 

211.86 225.87 B: you know if if you ah have big feet they call you big foot like it's really funny you know they come up with all these names when i was there um i'm quite a bit lighter skinned than everyone so they call me white gal and it's like you just have to accept it for what's 

226.68 233.49 B: that they just take like whatever your worst trait is basically and poke fun at it and call you that as a name and you just 

233.64 235.55 B: kind of deal with that 

235.57 237.39 B: it's kind of strange but 

237.11 240.80 A: hm i guess the assumption is it doesn't hurt anybody's feelings 

237.55 238.75 B: i don't know 

240.65 241.73 B: right 

242.02 248.11 B: yeah i'm sure that if you grow up in that sort of culture it wouldn't tend to hurt your feelings you know 

248.13 254.55 B: it's more um a think a a lot of people are overly sensitive about um 

254.61 255.45 B: you know 

255.81 261.25 B: jokes and a lot of people have well seen them for what they're worth i don't know 

261.84 268.89 A: yeah i guess the the i grew up in the midwest and and and the jokes were purely out of ignorance where 

269.13 272.52 A: ah racial jokes done well seemed to be 

273.00 276.37 A: those done out of personal experience um 

277.07 280.55 A: ah at least what we see on a daily basis 

281.54 282.49 B: right 

283.24 284.24 B: um 

285.69 289.70 B: [lipsmack] i don't know [laughter] i don't know what to say i'm like oh it's a strange topic 

289.37 290.57 A: [laughter] 

290.99 292.75 A: well i i've been to ah 

293.03 305.32 A: i took my girlfriend on her birthday to the comedy club in los angeles and um i was surprised there were like five comedians and there weren't any racial jokes all night but there was a lot there were a lot of ah 

306.53 308.15 A: (( ah jokes )) 

308.28 313.19 A: ah you know off color jokes um toilet jokes ah 

310.87 311.45 B: (( mm )) 

313.25 318.52 A: um there were there were chauvinistic jokes there were ah jokes about men and women 

318.63 319.49 A: but 

318.67 319.71 B: right 

319.29 327.44 A: i didn't hear the jokes that i expected ah you always would expect one or two of the comedians to cut loose with some of those 

327.24 334.91 A: um and that was just just at the time well it was in january so it was 

335.03 342.91 A: there were some jokes about iraq and there were some jokes about ah political jokes but no racial jokes 

343.45 344.48 B: yeah 

344.51 345.47 B: um 

346.28 351.55 B: i think that usually those are the jokes that i'm the most offended by and then probably 

350.56 353.31 A: (( mhm )) 

353.18 354.86 B: beyond that it's 

355.55 366.60 B: ah i get a little bit offended about just like you were saying when people make jokes and they're just purely ignorant about what they're talking about like that's upsetting to me you know 

366.81 368.03 B: it's like 

368.55 376.14 B: th- that to me seems like it's in poor taste if you're just kind of taking some kind of blanket statement and turning it into a joke like 

376.49 380.36 B: that that always touches a nerve with me and that'll upset me 

380.66 384.40 A: you mentioned jamie fox wh- who who do you like 

384.50 388.12 B: [lipsmack] um for comedians i don't know you know like 

386.50 387.38 A: mhm 

388.62 392.58 B: i love um i don't know if you've ever read maxim magazine 

392.97 394.24 B: it's like a met- 

393.03 395.59 A: ah i've seen it haven't read it mhm 

394.88 402.47 B: it's a men's magazine um but i love it i think the writing in that is hilarious great writing i think like 

402.49 413.88 B: i don't know i no real notable comedians um it's more like where i live there's a ca- there's a place that has comedy on thursday nights and we go maybe like once every couple of months and 

413.78 422.93 B: sometimes it's hilarious you know like i'm pretty open with the kind of humor that i like it's just that particular comedian i was i was so surprised um 

423.46 431.81 B: i also we we rented like a martin lawrence video it was like martin lawrence live recently and that was terrible too it was the same kind of thing it was all 

432.01 437.03 B: like geared toward the same kind of joke and it was like not funny you know [laughter] 

436.50 437.61 A: yeah 

437.20 439.39 B: i guess if you're not part of that 

439.62 443.07 B: culture you don't understand it so it's not funny but 

443.39 448.38 B: i definitely expected something a lot different than what i got out of it and we turned it off after ten minutes 

448.37 449.02 A: (( mm )) 

449.01 450.65 B: we just didn't think it was funny 

451.35 452.52 B: but um 

451.51 460.73 A: well i guess i i i enjoy like probably ro- robin williams the most because he's so quick witted and he can do a lot of improvisation it's 

458.17 459.02 B: yeah 

460.85 463.76 B: yeah i love him i think he's hilarious

467.97 475.60 A: well um well i go back i like ah a lot of the guys out of the sixties um 

476.54 488.64 A: ah well well bill cosby got his start basically he just talked about slice of life and day day in and day out little things that he made fun of usually family situations 

488.63 492.91 A: and ah richard prior early ah before he got 

493.05 506.59 A: to be racist and i'm not mostly talking about drugs and and other things um and then a coup- ah um the hippy dippy weather man ah george carlin from the sixties yeah

520.30 521.23 A: yes 

520.44 525.82 B: he's the one with the whole like you know you're a redneck if and like that to me is funny 'cause that's kind of 

525.71 537.10 B: not offensive you know everyone even people that probably are rednecks can probably relate to it you know to like you know you're a redneck if you have more ten more than ten dogs living under your porch stuff like that 

536.48 538.38 A: mhm 

537.74 538.90 B: but um

549.44 551.48 B: (( i don't know [laughter] sorry [laughter] )) 

552.35 557.86 A: yeah i'd have to go look at a newspaper and see um see if there are any other names that come out but 

557.99 562.26 A: ah did you have a clown or anybody who had a s- a a 

562.27 564.91 A: a natural sense of humor in your high school

578.72 579.89 A: (( ah )) 

580.27 593.70 A: fall kind of guy and the other one was real deadly serious so they were opposites and they were both really good and and they're just natural they could always get us laughing we always wanted them to be around just because they could always make everybody laugh 

587.97 588.88 B: (( oh )) 

593.54 594.60 B: yeah 

593.65 595.79 A: never took anything too seriously
