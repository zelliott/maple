387.51 398.66 A: when i was a little girl about seven and i just remember it being a big huge city but other than that and of course we didn't get a chance to see any comedians [laughter] because i was too little 

397.17 399.34 B: yeah you're in cleveland huh 

399.03 403.37 A: mhm so you probably have an opportunity we have an improv here 

400.14 401.11 B: okay 

403.25 414.39 A: and we go down to the improv sometimes but um lately they just they had kind of comedians that are just boring you know there's there's none of the good stuff out there 

414.39 422.58 A: there's nobody up and coming that's been at least been around cleveland that's really good but you guys probably get all the greats 

418.87 420.37 B: yeah 

422.44 429.31 B: yeah there's there's a lot of greats out here and ah you know but speaking about comedy you know it's like um

435.30 436.37 A: mhm 

435.98 437.32 B: and um 

437.49 449.40 B: you know they have like the regular circuit of people coming through and it was interesting i mean some of them were just i mean just like getting laughs some nights there would be like a very light people and ah just 

446.81 447.37 A: (( [noise] )) 

449.42 456.74 B: people there or just getting laughs up there and some of them would resort to to like you know kind of raunchy humor 

456.35 457.44 A: yeah 

456.88 458.50 B: just just to get laughs 

458.84 472.74 A: well you know i i know with well i think that's what eddie murphy did because a- when i first saw him he would tell good clean humor you know and he would just be so funny and then it seemed like after i saw him [mn] 

460.28 461.22 B: (( you know )) 

468.13 469.99 B: yeah 

472.98 478.38 A: after he got more and more famous it like was getting worse and worse did you notice that 

477.81 481.99 B: yeah well raw was like the epitome when it got that movie he did even you know 

481.38 490.42 A: yeah yeah it got really really bad and ah robin williams is another one his his humor if you've seen him

497.39 504.22 A: no i don't go see him anymore because he's just like too dirty everything's like filthy now is that 

503.25 504.40 B: oh really 

504.26 506.25 A: was that your experience 

505.91 510.82 B: well i mean i remember him back years ago and i just thought he was so brilliant you know 

510.28 511.32 A: yes 

511.23 512.54 B: i mean ah 

512.36 526.53 B: but um and then they put dennis what's his name he was just like too cynical for me um he was he was very b- intelligent too but i i just don't li- he was like i mean he was so far up there that you had to really be up on all the current events 

517.05 518.02 A: yeah 

526.39 529.21 B: and everything to even understand his humor you know 

529.35 533.91 B: ah have you ever dennis miller have you ever did you ever used to see him when he was doing standup 

533.74 536.95 A: no i haven't seen him in person i've seen him on t._v.

540.38 541.49 A: yeah 

541.31 549.16 B: it was very very sophisticated humor i mean like ah you had to r- like i said you had to really be up on politics 

548.94 560.83 B: and a lot of things and that was an interesting slant to humor you know ah but as far as ah i mean i liked it you know but sometimes i just like you know sometimes you've just got to come back home you know and get the ah 

561.29 565.21 B: like you said and family stuff is always something that everybody can relate to you know 

565.30 569.70 A: yeah that it the older i get the more that's what i prefer 

565.87 566.63 B: (( so )) 

569.51 584.13 A: is just good wholesome humor and i i really having kids now i really draw the lines at a lot of this [mn] robin williams does an awful lot of sexual innuendo and stuff so i wouldn't want my 

569.92 571.81 B: yeah 

583.12 586.14 B: oh he does okay yeah 

584.42 590.50 A: yeah in in in certain arenas now if you see him on network t._v. of course he can't
