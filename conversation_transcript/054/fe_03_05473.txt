64.36 65.30 B: (( and it's )) 

66.06 69.09 B: around a hundred dollars and it worked for me 

68.44 69.48 A: (( mhm nice )) 

69.34 74.32 B: it sure seemed to help you know i i kinda i turned thirty five 

74.89 85.39 B: and i just was tired of not being able to breathe anymore so and i said i i'm not gonna live to see forty if i keep i had smoked since i was fifteen pretty regularly 

78.03 79.94 A: mhm [laughter] i understand 

84.91 85.82 A: (( ah )) 

85.79 86.77 B: so 

86.83 88.21 A: (( yeah i'm i'm tw- )) 

86.91 89.83 B: it seemed to me where enough was enough you know 

89.42 94.39 A: yeah i'm twenty eight and had ah i've smoked s- pretty much since i was about ah nineteen or so 

94.08 95.12 B: uh-huh 

94.54 105.26 A: and ah yeah i can i mean i can tell a difference when i'm not smoking that it like for example even just a few cigarettes a day i can tell my performance in the gym you know drops down and ah it's not as good as it u- should be 

102.54 104.19 B: oh yeah [noise] 

105.23 106.69 A: let me ask you this um 

106.62 120.75 A: [lipsmack] what ah in florida they just ah passed an amendment in last ah i think last november's election that you can't it was similar to california you can't smoke in bars and and um and ah a- eateries you know restaurants things of that nature 

120.03 122.50 B: [noise] yeah correct 

120.62 122.80 A: what what do you think of something like that 

122.40 130.49 B: ah ah bars i have a hard time with i think you should be able to go to a bar and smoke if you want 

126.86 128.10 A: [laughter] 

129.80 131.01 A: mhm 

130.39 131.80 B: restaurants 

131.67 139.39 B: i've gone to vegas where the i- if they split it up in smoking and non smoking sections i think there's ways around it 

139.22 151.76 B: i just don't think the restaurants or the businesses would put the money into putting the proper ventilation to make smokers and non smoker sections and i 

150.08 151.41 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

151.91 158.86 B: i don't know i guess there's no way around it really if the easiest solution is to not smoke at all in 

158.87 161.08 B: in them type a places 

160.72 161.97 A: right 

161.37 169.50 B: 'cause i guess i guess from opinion ah the person who doesn't smoke should have the more rights than the person that does so 

169.07 173.37 A: i think so it is an optional thing it's not necessary for survival after all 

171.08 171.87 B: [mn] 

172.74 175.45 B: yeah exactly 

173.94 181.81 A: well i'll tell you a story even when i was a i rarely ah i was about a pack and a half a day smoker and e- even during the midst of that i went out to california for a business trip 

178.60 179.69 B: uh-huh 

181.18 182.88 B: yeah 

181.82 187.91 A: and so i was out you know in ah irvine went to a club out there and ah they are very strict about their non smoking 

185.53 193.93 B: mhm yeah i grew up in california and but i left before they ch- made that law so 

190.05 191.12 A: yeah 

192.97 207.83 A: w- i tell you what though even though i was a smoker i loved it because you could go outside and smoke but like and the next morning when i got up um you know after partying all night you know a business trip i didn't have that i wasn't choked with smoke you know even even though i was a smoker i was like hey this is i mean i i loved it it was 

196.07 198.06 B: really uh-huh 

203.17 206.72 B: (( yeah )) 

207.28 214.96 B: ver- very true i've known from nights of partying and smoking it [laughter] those are the worst mornings after that 

207.67 208.45 A: (( great )) 

213.65 221.78 A: right and i loved it i i mean i i just i said why i i i didn't feel like dirty and grimy and you know it just is is wonderful 

215.73 217.49 B: (( yeah )) 

219.35 221.92 B: uh-huh oh yeah really 

221.98 232.02 B: yeah i know here in utah they just have you could smoke in bars but it's because they call 'em private clubs ya gotta buy a membership 

229.53 230.34 A: ah 

231.86 232.81 A: okay 

232.39 234.66 B: to go to the club 

233.89 234.85 A: (( got ya r- )) 

234.70 241.90 B: and so that's how they get around smoking anyways and hard liquor too for that matter of fact 

241.02 245.20 A: [laughter] yeah we have no problem with hard liquor here in florida it's everywhere if you want it 

243.32 243.91 B: (( uh-huh )) 

244.77 246.39 B: yeah [laughter] 

245.33 258.57 A: yeah it flows like water ah living out ah here's another ah question on the topic um you've seen you've seen those truth commercials right with the what do you think of those i actually think um they turn me off because i i just don't like smart aleck kids [laughter] 

249.44 250.34 B: sure 

251.93 253.55 B: yeah 

254.04 255.08 B: (( [noise] )) 

256.17 257.07 B: uh-huh 

257.85 259.72 B: yeah 

258.73 260.69 A: you know do you do you like those or 

260.63 272.03 B: ah i think maybe they're good for the kids for the younger people who don't smoke maybe they might get through to it but i agree with you as an adult i don't know if i really like 'em 

265.90 266.75 A: mhm 

271.69 272.58 A: mhm 

271.90 276.20 B: because you're not really telling me nothing i don't know already so 

275.71 288.06 A: right and i d- i i also don't trust them they seem a little bit slanted i mean ev- everybody knows that smoking is bad for you that's not the question of the but the delivery behind it i- it seems very more politically motivated than 

276.23 277.19 B: and i 

281.68 284.07 B: y- yeah 

287.48 296.45 B: it is very biased but i know there was one commercial that you know speaking of breaking up with the girlfriend and smoking it really kinda hit me you know 

296.78 300.61 B: the one that had the kept on stressing when it's 

300.51 313.18 B: well you stink and you can't get a date kinda thing and and stuff and it kinda hit home i'm like being a single person myself and i was like you know what there is some truth [laughter] to that one [laughter] 

304.13 305.60 A: [laughter] right 

311.40 317.02 A: [laughter] but it's true you know when i was a smoker i'd for ah girls that smoked to date 

316.72 318.60 B: yeah 

317.21 321.96 A: yeah they you do ah open up the playing field so to speak more when you are a non smoker 

321.88 328.25 B: of course yeah because there's a lotta girls that won't date guys that smoke for obvious reasons ah 

327.43 336.41 A: sure sure and and nowadays even though i'm i'm a kinda of i've only been smoking back smoking for a week but if if i were to look for another girlfriend now it'd be a non smoker you know 

336.14 338.06 B: (( yeah )) 

336.69 339.42 A: (( yeah do you smoke in your home or did you smoke in your home )) 

338.84 341.42 B: i did yeah 

339.83 347.43 A: yeah i i never did that i i smoked in my car like a fiend but i never smoked in the house i always went outside you know w- 

343.31 347.03 B: yeah [laughter] course ah 

347.47 351.11 B: yeah i was famous for sitting at the computer or something 

350.84 351.75 A: (( ah )) 

350.98 360.64 B: i have kids so if the kids were around or or if it or if it was my weekend with the kids i wouldn't smoke in the house but 

359.67 360.87 A: right 

360.63 368.78 B: beyond that i just especially here in utah sometimes the winter gets pretty cold you know and you don't you're [laughter] not going outside to smoke so 

365.57 366.66 A: oh yeah 

368.02 373.48 A: [laughter] well i was in new hampshire one christmas and um i've never really been up north too much and 

370.95 371.51 B: (( [mn] )) 

372.85 373.87 B: uh-huh 

373.50 387.69 A: and i go outside to smoke a cigarette in the morning and it's like negative six and i and i take that first breath of air and oh man my lungs just froze up and i'm out there smoking a cigarette and l- you know in my sweat my sweat suit and i'm like this is insane [laughter] it's absolutely insane 

376.80 378.97 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

379.20 380.11 B: oh 

382.24 384.00 B: (( [laughter] )) 

387.03 399.00 B: yeah [laughter] florida like i said i grew up in lived eighteen years in california and palm springs you know in the desert so it's okay to go outside during the winter 'cause it's still sixty fifty at the worst [laughter] you know 

393.66 394.33 A: mhm 

398.48 401.36 A: right that's pretty much like it is here in florida 

401.09 403.01 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

401.91 409.49 A: well d- do you think the ah the government should have more of a hand in um in anti smoking ordinances and then getting people to quit smoking 

409.15 415.80 B: no i think it's totally i think less government the better and that it's a personal choice either way 

415.33 417.65 A: right well how about you know where where 

416.80 427.91 B: w- where where it infringes on other people then i think yes then it's allowable for the majority you know we live a democratic society and the majority should rule so 

427.02 437.44 A: yeah right on i'm with you there i agree with that it um sometimes it seems like the government wants to protect us from ourselves and that never works you can't legislate you know smart thinking or morality so 

436.85 438.23 B: yeah 

437.57 440.05 A: yeah i i i i agree with you completely 

439.10 440.91 B: (( mainly true )) 

440.31 445.45 A: you know so can you smoke outside in like on public streets in utah or are they pretty tough on that 

445.09 452.75 B: oh yeah you can smoke just about anywhere you want except for you know the public pool they won't let you smoke in there and 

452.14 453.31 A: right right 

452.62 460.14 B: or other the other public places but as far as on the street or whatever i- or a park there's no laws against it so 

459.76 472.16 A: oh that's good ah do you have anything ah do you have any other opinions about ah smoking or not smoking and what we can do to help the problem because it does create quite a burden with health care and you know the health care industry is in trouble as is 

471.54 475.86 B: yeah that's very true ah [sigh] 

474.31 475.24 A: yeah 

475.77 476.92 A: (( i mean the the )) 

476.13 479.60 B: besides banning it entirely [laughter] i don't know 

479.36 488.25 A: well you know there have been times when i was trying to quit where i wished it'd become illegal or at least very hard to get ah because i know that that would've helped me quit along you know along the way 

482.90 484.47 B: yeah 

487.10 494.34 B: mm or else be like canada and make 'em seven dollars a pack and make the tax so high [laughter] that no one will 

490.59 491.76 A: ouch 

492.82 493.77 A: (( [laughter] )) 

494.39 498.21 B: [laughter] not only k- does it kill ya but it'll break you too 

497.95 503.94 A: right well when i started smoking you could get 'em for a little bit under two bucks a pack and then now here in florida they're ah 

502.99 504.86 B: yeah 

503.95 515.20 A: they're al- depending on the brand they're almost four bucks like three eighty nine something like that i mean that and that certainly was a deterrent for me too 'cause i realized how much i spent on it a year or a month or a week even and i said why 

507.16 508.18 B: uh-huh 

513.25 516.07 B: yeah i've added it up 

515.48 519.25 A: yeah i can i can do a lot better things with money than killing myself [laughter] 

518.43 525.98 B: i remember when they used to be seventy five cents in the machine at the country club when i first started as a kid sneaking in there [laughter] buying 'em 

525.35 527.47 A: or you could find that money on the street 

526.91 528.90 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

527.58 540.20 A: [laughter] that's interesting we know r. j. reynolds are particularly um you know they they they're b- they've been accused of marketing to kids with like cartoon characters like a like camel i guess or is that philip morris but 

537.12 538.32 B: (( a- uh-huh )) 

538.51 540.72 B: yeah uh-huh 

540.27 546.02 A: you know and marketing to kids and youth 'cause they have to replace the stock of smokers of i've never really actually 

541.70 543.66 B: yeah 

546.48 550.62 A: thought that was true have you ever thought that was true that they marketed the youth 

549.25 555.63 B: i i i think so i kinda believe it i think kids are a lot more success 

551.97 552.84 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

556.00 570.52 B: susceptible to it and and they see stuff like that my suggestion would be to help solve the problem is to help get it away from the kids the people starting it more so 

570.56 574.83 B: make it less uncool and maybe even 

574.88 579.18 B: maybe now that you bring it up a ban on a- advertising entirely 

579.14 584.29 A: mhm right well you know they did that with ah with cigarettes i guess you can't do it on t._v. and you can't 

583.38 590.19 B: yeah you can't do it on t._v. but i'm saying maybe take it out of magazines and billboards and out of the stores too 

587.76 588.81 A: mhm 

589.88 596.93 A: right well that's one reason i don't know if you're a racing fan ah i'm not particularly but nascar um they're they just switched to nextel and 

593.85 599.89 B: yeah yeah nextel i read about them they couldn't yeah 

598.99 599.95 A: yeah the they
