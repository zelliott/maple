16.92 17.76 B: yeah 

19.61 24.40 B: [sigh] well i mean b- basically i you know i keep my ear to the ground of course i'm not [sigh] 

24.27 36.13 B: i'm not in the education field either but ah [sigh] you know we did go through t- the i did go through the public school system so [sigh] if nothing else that [sigh] makes me somewhat of an a- [laughter] authority on it [sigh] 

35.13 42.55 A: [noise] [sigh] yeah sure i a- actually went through mine like catholic schools in san francisco area [sigh] um 

40.60 41.64 B: oh uh-huh 

42.47 50.99 A: [mn] a- ah w- went to public s- schools but not in the u._s. um so [sigh] i don't have f- first hand knowledge of public schools in the us [sigh] 

47.05 48.30 B: oh okay [noise] 

51.32 55.04 A: um i understand there's a voucher system u- um 

52.97 55.66 B: (( [noise] )) 

55.12 60.93 A: i i i'm of two minds ah i i a- agree [noise] that it's good for people to be able to 

60.94 70.76 A: [sigh] put their kids where they think their education would be best and [noise] and to use money [sigh] to do that is very good but then also we're also leaving behind [sigh] 

63.99 65.43 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] mm )) 

70.90 80.17 A: a- ah a segment [noise] of the population that i think needs t- the public school system [sigh] so i do believe the public school system needs to be [noise] kept up and kept funded 

82.70 83.55 A: (( do )) 

85.49 87.25 B: (( [noise] [sigh] yeah )) 

86.53 88.25 A: you have thoughts on that [noise] 

87.63 97.51 B: well ah as i u- understand it russia had a v- voucher system as far as schools and other items [sigh] and ah the people were selling their vouchers 

91.33 92.75 A: [mn] no kidding 

97.12 103.37 A: [sigh] [noise] [laughter] a- ah on the black market then huh [sigh] so how did that work they would [noise] 

100.67 102.03 B: yeah 

102.75 112.10 B: well basically if if you got the voucher you got to a- ah d- do whatever the program within that voucher said and people were desperate for equality there [sigh] and ah 

108.48 109.82 A: (( huh [sigh] )) 

111.90 118.12 B: [sigh] they sold their vouchers and unfortunately you know how it goes [sigh] t- they they bought things they shouldn't have bought with them 

115.19 115.98 A: (( [noise] so )) 

116.92 125.28 A: [noise] so their children kept going to public schools and they sold it [sigh] and those people would use that voucher then to pay for private schools [noise] [noise] 

119.51 122.03 B: (( [sigh] mm right public that's [sigh] y- )) 

124.36 134.36 B: yeah [sigh] and then you know another thing you have to realize as far as the quality of schools or the private schools versus the public schools is [sigh] you know t- the the bottom line are you in california 

134.12 135.05 A: yes 

134.69 146.93 B: yeah [sigh] well you know we have a lottery [sigh] here [sigh] and and that's supposed to go to the schools [sigh] and and yet these schools are in s- still such bad shape which makes me wonder w- where's the lotto money going 

137.55 138.72 A: (( [noise] right )) 

140.46 141.36 A: (( right [noise] )) 

145.99 157.51 A: [sigh] y- yeah i think a lot of money is eaten up by b- bureaucracies [noise] [sigh] that ah you know have n- no interest in g- giving their money back to schools they they the like the money and they want to keep it [noise] [sigh] 

156.12 164.07 B: [noise] well nu- number one ah our lottery and our lotto is run by bally's [sigh] which is the c- casino out of new jersey 

161.60 162.71 A: (( right [sigh] [noise] )) 

163.77 165.04 A: sure y- 

164.42 167.38 B: so there's the number one problem right there [sigh] 

166.77 169.48 A: (( yeah [laughter] i know [laughter] [sigh] [noise] )) 

167.59 179.39 B: cal- california is not running california's l- lottery where the monies are going to the schools [sigh] i think the handwriting's on the wall there you should ah you know [sigh] be m- more people should realize that 

172.70 174.03 A: (( y- yeah )) 

178.72 183.41 A: [noise] right yeah th- that is a [sigh] something i didn't know of t- that it was bally's [sigh] 

182.90 185.06 B: but they don't and and ah [sigh] 

183.66 184.79 A: (( [noise] it [noise] [noise] )) 

185.15 199.53 B: a lot of what's going on in the public schools now [sigh] um [lipsmack] we we're spending money on t- the wrong things [sigh] you know um basically i i used to live in a little east los angeles suburb of los angeles called montebello [sigh] 

199.61 214.22 B: montebello's answer to teen pregnancy was to create a c- child care in and b- build a c- child care center [sigh] instead of educating them that hey if you you're not married if you're not in love [sigh] if you're not of age and can't handle taking care of a child [sigh] you 

206.05 206.95 A: (( uh-hum )) 

213.74 215.13 A: (( [noise] uh-hum [noise] right )) 

214.41 216.10 B: probably shouldn't be having one 

215.65 221.47 A: yeah [sigh] that s- seems to be that [laughter] that should be your first priority [sigh] teaching that [sigh] 

219.63 220.77 B: yeah you know 

220.90 233.01 B: so the money's not going into this and that's why you see a lot of when you drive by a public school [sigh] you see a lot of portable schools [sigh] you know the kind like like like i want to say [sigh] mobil- mobile homes y- 

227.87 229.09 A: (( [noise] right [noise] [sigh] )) 

232.00 235.21 A: yeah the prefabs yeah the prefab building [sigh] yeah [sigh] [noise] [noise] 

233.31 239.08 B: yeah e- exactly and [sigh] what what's been coming up a lot well the mobile ho- 

238.93 242.23 B: those mobile home schools have been found not to be safe 

241.59 242.98 A: (( uh-hum [noise] uh-hum )) 

242.09 256.27 B: [sigh] because we're cutting money on costs for schools [sigh] yet for example in my montebello high high school example [sigh] they built the built the child day care [sigh] bottom line is if you're responsible enough to take it you know to have a child you should be working 

254.17 255.73 A: (( [noise] uh-hum [sigh] )) 

256.08 259.69 B: [mn] and you should be working to pay for that responsibility [sigh] 

256.58 257.75 A: (( yeah uh-hum [noise] [noise] )) 

259.48 271.80 B: i i mean and there's a lot of cl- classes that get get ah funded that shouldn't be [sigh] you know they're teaching fourth graders [sigh] ah in in one school out here [sigh] ah down in southern california [sigh] how to put on a condom 

271.68 273.03 A: (( [sigh] no kidding )) 

272.68 273.89 B: yeah 

273.09 275.52 A: (( [sigh] i hadn't heard that one [laughter] )) 

274.62 284.85 B: that's money in our public schools [sigh] going to fund something [sigh] that shouldn't be funded you know they they got bananas out there and and these are fourth graders 

275.84 276.62 A: that's 

276.84 278.29 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

279.31 281.92 A: (( [noise] uh-hum )) 

284.46 290.63 A: yeah it's a- ah definitely [noise] something that [laughter] should not be taught to fourth graders i think [sigh] but yeah [noise] 

289.42 298.38 B: no i mean we're we're like robert bourke wrote in his b- book we're slouching toward gomorrah a- and you know we're pro immoral society 

296.76 297.73 A: right 

297.91 309.05 A: right [sigh] yeah i've heard a [noise] a theory that ah society gets more and more lax [sigh] ah because they they nothing shocks them anymore [noise] [laughter] [sigh] and ah [sigh] 

307.63 308.56 B: (( yeah i )) 

309.21 311.15 A: and a- and therefore 

311.44 315.56 A: you you you just keep getting worse and worse [noise] [sigh] um [sigh] y- 

313.73 314.50 B: (( know )) 

314.91 319.15 B: well there there's no more right or wrong it's just ah well that's different 

318.56 320.38 A: yes right [noise] 

319.62 330.20 B: you know you can't have that anymore it there has to be a right and there has to be a wrong [sigh] 'cause pretty soon everything gets acceptable [sigh] and it a- as it is within our school system you know like 

324.22 325.09 A: (( [sigh] uh-hum [noise] )) 

330.14 334.63 B: ah you know in the public schools remember that mary kaye laterno who ah 

334.49 337.87 B: took a fourteen year old to vegas and had sex with him and 

336.89 338.28 A: (( [sigh] [noise] [lipsmack] right )) 

337.69 349.35 B: all that [sigh] she got ah she got sentenced to ah basically probation and [sigh] people you know there's that thing about oh oh well you know [sigh] hey that was every boy's dream well no no it's not you know 

348.39 349.76 A: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

349.14 353.45 B: that may be a young boy with an older woman but you know that will scar him 

353.13 355.18 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] [noise] exactly yeah [sigh] )) 

354.05 363.23 B: it floors me that [sigh] that's acceptable yet if it were the other w- way around [sigh] where it was a male teacher and a female student oh [sigh] well shame on you 

361.72 364.24 A: [noise] they'd be hung by now yeah [laughter] 

363.34 372.75 B: yeah exactly he he'd probably be in prison [noise] you know he wouldn't have got probation [sigh] you know and there there's there's a a double standard there 

366.31 368.45 A: (( [laughter] [noise] oh definitely yeah [sigh] )) 

368.78 369.65 A: no 

371.81 373.33 A: (( [noise] yeah [sigh] )) 

372.89 374.44 B: (( and and [cough] [sigh] )) 

374.32 379.34 A: so what do we do we we reallocate money more money towards the schools or 

378.20 388.27 B: well no i i i think if we're going to give money to schools [sigh] ah you know as as a tax payer we should [noise] be leery or there should be some c- conditions on that money 

387.32 390.39 A: [sigh] [sigh] [noise] [sigh] so tighter reins on where the money goes 

388.65 389.75 B: yeah 

389.79 396.16 B: yeah well ah you know ah it s- should be f- for oh i don't know education comes to m- [laughter] mind 

394.87 398.19 A: [noise] [laughter] 

396.98 407.08 B: and you know ah in in the same sense 'cause when i went to high school i went to high school out here [sigh] and ah my social studies teacher was basically a baby sitter 

401.57 402.63 A: (( [noise] uh-huh [noise] )) 

406.96 410.76 B: [sigh] and he's getting paid [sigh] m- much b- better than a baby sitter 

410.49 411.65 A: (( yes [noise] [noise] )) 

410.63 422.37 B: he he he would tell us [sigh] okay read this chapter and answer the questions in the back of the book and one time i i went up to him and i asked him a question [sigh] he had the social studies book up like he was reading it but inside the book was a magazine 

422.24 423.20 A: huh 

422.79 430.03 B: so he was sitting there reading a magazine and drawing a teacher's salary [sigh] if you're going to baby sit you deserve a baby s- sitter's salary 

425.37 426.97 A: [sigh] no kidding 

429.48 431.91 A: (( [sigh] [mn] [sigh] yeah [noise] so you )) 

430.62 435.00 B: and you know there's no litmus test for teachers that's another problem [sigh] 

434.48 435.77 A: (( uh-hum )) 

435.17 440.34 B: you know the the quality of education ah got begins with the quality of the educator 

440.20 441.88 A: (( [noise] [sigh] yeah [sigh] )) 

441.24 442.21 B: (( you know )) 

442.10 452.35 A: so how but you know how do we get [noise] better educators when t- they can get more money outside of the school system or or in the in the private school system 

451.89 454.32 B: yeah [sigh] well i mean 

452.92 457.40 A: [sigh] [sigh] how how how do we lure them back to public school teaching [noise] [noise] 

456.61 466.45 B: well you know there are certain professions that that gets that get ah tax incentives you know and tax breaks [sigh] for doing something in the public sector and providing a public service [sigh] 

466.37 472.16 B: and um y- you know maybe tax credits for teachers who choose public school or [sigh] if you're going to college 

472.00 482.30 B: [mn] and you get yo- you you want your education subsidized you know it's a lot like like they they do for example if i applied to be a real estate agent [sigh] 

476.81 477.73 A: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

482.01 482.98 A: right 

482.40 493.62 B: century twenty one would pay f- for me to go through real estate school [sigh] but when i got out i better be working for century twenty one [sigh] for a contracted number of times you know [sigh] like the military 

488.37 489.44 A: (( [noise] right [noise] uh-hum ))

520.55 526.91 B: you know for a certain number of time you're contracted if you have contract teachers [sigh] where you know um [lipsmack] 

526.69 537.96 B: they get their education paid because believe you me [sigh] you know i went through i went to a an out of state c- college here 'cause i saw the quality of california education and i didn't care for it [sigh] um 

533.00 534.04 A: (( [noise] [noise] uh-hum [noise] uh-hum )) 

537.77 544.51 B: [sigh] ah that's an expensive venture and and most people don't have that money and the cost of school is rising 

542.65 543.61 A: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

544.37 545.27 A: (( right [noise] [noise] )) 

544.54 555.26 B: [sigh] so if ah i- you know the government says hell we'll help pay your your primary education to get your primary education degree [sigh] but when you come out [lipsmack] you know you ah [sigh]
