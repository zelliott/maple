4.63 5.83 A: nice to meet you too 

5.52 7.90 B: all right well uh 

8.10 10.17 B: our topic over here is uh 

10.47 16.87 A: it's what you do we what do we think of the uh the school system and what could be done to uh to correct it so what do you think 

12.27 14.06 B: the school system 

16.30 19.95 B: well uh uh i guess school system's got a 

20.26 27.73 B: i don't know has a lot well i been i been abroad so i've seen different you know countries and their systems and i just came from japan 

27.41 28.24 A: uh-huh 

27.61 39.11 B: for a long stint and you know seeing how their their their children are prepared they go to school like six days a week and even on sundays they they they're so dedicated that they go 

34.17 35.22 A: (( uh-huh so )) 

39.21 53.19 B: to to a a like training program to help them whatever they're weak in you know if they're you know if they're they're one of the smarter people in their in in their in that whatever field like if they if they're bad at science or something like they'll 

53.35 57.40 B: they're not the best so they'll they'll keep striving to be the best and it's like [mn] 

57.32 69.23 B: you know we have to try to maybe instill that that sense of motivation to the children like these days like i went to public high school in new york city and it's like there was such a it was so 

69.56 73.23 B: there was no um [sigh] how do i say this there was no 

73.43 78.26 B: res- no like self control the students kind kind of did whatever they wanted to do 

78.51 82.81 B: and uh even the even the graduation i just went to a graduation for for my little sister 

82.87 88.89 B: and it was just like the students were kind of wild and kind of did whatever they wanted to do and i don't know 

88.97 89.91 B: it's like 

89.25 93.11 A: what do you think is the reason for that why why what about public schools make that happen 

92.56 94.26 B: (( well i i think it's a r- re- )) 

94.39 97.04 B: a reflection on what our society you know 

97.08 98.93 B: to tell you the truth but um 

98.59 99.32 A: (( oh )) 

99.32 110.19 B: you know but i i think you know obviously japan and and and uh u._s._a. are two d- totally different societies in the way they operate but i think what our school system it should there should be 

110.65 115.46 B: more emphasis on on on students actually learning information because sometimes 

115.33 125.66 B: they're just they just p- they just uh go on without actually learning from there i mean i i was in high school there were students who were in my l- my uh grade level who 

125.68 130.85 B: really couldn't really read that well you know there's a real emphasis on on like just 

128.02 128.78 A: yeah 

130.75 141.44 B: getting them through the system and having a set quota of like we have to have we have to keep these numbers going keep these kids graduating and a lot of teachers are are afraid to like fail students 

141.33 145.72 B: for fear of the students and for the parents and what it'll do to the whole system 

145.55 146.70 B: you know whereas 

146.50 161.35 B: you know if you if you send a child back if he can't read you know that's an important thing [mn] that's uh not gonna affect not only us but like us our society because that's our future you know the children of today are are the leaders of tomorrow right so it's like [laughter] 

156.90 157.75 A: (( so what )) 

161.74 166.13 A: so why do you think that why do you think public schools do that what do you think we can do about them to make a difference oh uh-huh mm 

165.03 176.67 B: well i mean one i well for one i'm i'm a i'm a musician anyway but uh i'm a big advocate of music in the schools and we don't have a i don't think we have enough music in schools i think music is a great great way for children to 

177.30 182.58 B: [noise] to uh uh open their uh their their minds creatively you know the creative 

182.74 197.16 B: brain cells and um it'll it'll it'll get them more involved in school maybe they'll i mean they'll wanna they'll wanna be a part of school like i used to i used to love to go to school just to be on the chorus but i mean i had to attend my other classes as well i w- wasn't 

183.42 188.10 A: hm 

196.99 204.00 B: so motivated to be in other classes but i knew that knew where to get to stay in these theater programs or whatever i had to 

203.89 218.87 B: you know continue my keep my grades up so you know but i mean to the the music programs i think music should be in e- in every school and i think our music and the the arts in general for children so they can explore creative stuff our children 

219.12 225.50 B: they don't have a feeling a a sense of what they can do for for this world they they have a i i i've s- 

225.31 237.88 B: i can see just about or or talk to when i every time i run run across younger people they're always like very apathetic they really don't care i don't know what i'm gonna do i don't know about this i don't know about that really have no clue and it's e- kind of 

237.88 249.95 B: you know it's just i think it's par- partially their parents but i mean it's also you know our system you know if if we had something i mean i know some some students from like say private schools catholic schools they have [noise] are much more 

249.82 258.90 B: uh kind of one on one thing the the the prof- the the teachers are cons- you know really concerned about their students you know and uh maybe the ones 

258.90 265.04 B: in public schools they really sometimes they're really not you know they they really uh it's kind of hard before them because they're 

265.21 273.48 B: they're fearful of the child- the students you know students are violent students are this students are that i mean the worse case scenario of students you know i mean not not all of 'em are like that so 

273.41 286.61 B: but i mean even in my school i remember people you know just uh lighting off um m. eighties in by the hallway and throwing 'em and you know all kinds of cr- i mean it was it was like it was like you know i've seen it out out of a movie or something and it was it's just 

286.98 295.01 B: it's it's it's really a hard thing to put a put your finger on you know because it's like it's such a broa- i mean there's so so many schools 

295.08 309.12 B: and there's so many uh different like so many school different school systems like from new york to to to p- pennsylvania it might be totally different you know how how they run their systems like they're you know i mean it's not that different but it's like 

309.29 315.94 B: you know there's there's slight differences they help help their students out maybe like in pennsylvania they over here they might not do you know 

317.30 319.19 B: [noise] how what what do you think about it i mean 

318.80 326.31 A: well i think that a lot of it has to do with money i think the reason why why why schools are the way they are is 'cause the t- and why the teachers don't care is they're not getting paid enough to care 

325.58 327.07 B: of course [noise] 

326.47 328.00 A: well that's a big part 

328.01 333.86 A: so you know unless unless we as a society want to allot more money to to the schools and teachers and to 

333.64 348.38 A: you know 'cause it's 'cause it's also a matter of talking about raising the standards for kids it's also a matter of raising the standards for teachers it's like keeping teachers around who are not effective but the problem is that the teachers who are you know if they fired teachers who were ineffective they wouldn't initially have people come to take their place 

337.85 339.79 B: [noise] yes [noise] 

348.23 358.60 A: you know and the te- so the teachers you know you have to hire good teachers and train them and and you know expect a lot from them and uh and make sure the k- that the you're right we do have to make sure we expect it form the kids as well 

358.43 365.10 A: yeah i don't know uh why they keep passing kids through with instead of uh instead of uh you know keeping them back until they learn stuff 

359.40 361.73 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

363.80 372.57 B: i mean seriously [mn] there was some there were some students there i mean when when they're asked to read something out in you know just something basic i mean read a read a 

372.46 379.88 B: paragraph read this they are very fearful and when they do you can tell why because they just don't have the comprehension they can't even i mean 

379.65 391.24 B: they they don't understand words they i mean they they look at you know a word as being large and they you know get flustered you know and it's because they're fear- because they don't they're not using that part of the head you know the their brains [mn] 

384.64 385.53 A: yeah 

391.33 401.65 B: you know like atrophied because they haven't even got a chance to ex- you know there's some really smart kids out there and just they haven't had a chance whether whether it be their environment whether it be their parents wheth- whether it be their 

402.19 416.97 B: just themselves maybe you know some students some people just really don't care you know but i think young people are so so uh you know like their their minds are like uh very cl- like clay you know and they're still so able so able to be molded you know it's like 

415.75 423.17 A: well i don't think people value school today very much the way they used to i don't think i don't think that kids or parents think it's really that important i mean they th- somehow think that 

422.97 433.88 A: what worries me is that people a lot of people think that it doesn't really matter that it's all you know the world is so disorganized anyway that it doesn't matter whether you go to school or don't go to school you're you're you're you're not gonna get what you need anyway so 

433.30 435.45 B: [mn] mm people use those those uh 

435.24 448.34 B: those like staples of uh of not going to school like oh albert einstein didn't finish high school i mean or i mean but not everybody has albert einstein's ability and he did finish school eventually you know so i mean if people people do their research he he ended up you know 

439.20 440.00 A: right 

444.47 445.36 A: yeah 

448.23 452.25 B: i mean he didn't he didn't do you know go do the do the straight you know 

452.32 456.29 B: uh you know twelve years of school and whatever you know but i mean 

457.09 465.33 B: he did what he need needed to do and he has proven himself i mean the children these days have not proven themselves and that's what you know i mean oh i can do this and then 

465.35 466.11 B: even 

466.43 481.13 B: even looking right now just yesterday they had the uh n._b._a. draft you know and they're drafting high schoolers you know kids who are seventeen eighteen the these young kids the the first first pick ninety million dollars hadn't done done a thing yet now i mean 

469.75 470.91 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

475.43 476.36 A: yeah 

478.83 482.65 A: right right what kind of a what kind of a message does that send the kid 

481.51 484.35 B: yeah because now he's he's thinking well money 

484.24 489.66 B: or or a college degree i mean and not many kids who wanna go to college they go you know what i can 

489.43 503.55 B: i can become a musi- a music start at at fifteen because somebody else did it you know y- and the the more the younger people are doing things the more the people wanna emulate them and say you know what i can oh [lipsmack] i don't need education i can become a music star 

491.75 492.60 A: right 

502.32 507.90 A: yeah well the sad part is what they don't realise is that even to be an artist you have to be educated you can't you know you can't 

505.90 509.46 B: oh and it takes it's a lot of hard work and preparation and you 

508.71 520.40 A: no but but it's not only preparation you have to know you know if you're gonna be a writer if you're going to be a musician you have to you have to know the world you can't you can't be the r- the really good artists have you know are not are not uninformed they know what's going on in the world 

515.58 516.35 B: (( [noise] )) 

519.37 529.88 B: and the they touch people by knowing or having a wealth of knowledge about different things even even young younger ones i mean there there some great artists that are pretty young and they're but they're just so smart i mean i don't 

521.42 522.31 A: yeah 

522.61 523.57 A: right 

529.64 536.82 B: i listen to them and i think wow and their music and their lyrics and it's just you know where does it come from i think it comes from their their their 

536.60 546.41 B: their upbringing their education and they they actually have something to to say and they can say it you know in educated manner you know without sounding like you know like a boob you know 

537.52 538.46 A: yeah 

546.00 553.31 A: yeah the whole the whole system's gotta be rehauled i think i think that that probably i i kinda wish that they'd just go to an all magnet school 

552.73 554.77 B: yeah 

553.23 559.63 A: where sort that everybody that everybody had to figure out something that they were that they wanted to do and they had to apply to a school so that there was 

559.41 570.15 A: you know i mean that would probably mean that there'd be some schools that would really be just people who really didn't care but at least at least they wouldn't hurt anybody else and th- those people could be worked on some how but at least they wouldn't keep other people back 

567.87 569.02 B: yeah because 

570.17 578.40 B: and 'cause i i mean i had a buddy whose uh whose whose uh son came here from england and he would come back and forth from england to 

578.37 581.45 B: to uh to the states and he would spend maybe spend you know 

581.38 586.55 B: six months here or whatever and he might go to school here or her might just uh just be here for the summertime 

586.20 587.15 A: yeah 

586.44 599.89 B: and he was explaining the school system and it's like well it's almost like a college you know it's like it's almost they have you know courses they have to take and they have a se- and you know when you treat children like that and you treat them in give them some responsibility
