134.70 135.74 A: well 

136.64 138.60 A: i don't think that they should be 

139.87 142.57 A: i don't know i i i think that um 

144.28 144.84 A: (( [mn] )) 

146.09 149.56 A: certain books about certain lifestyles 

149.86 151.37 A: is um 

151.61 160.23 A: i i don't want my children want them to be exposed to that and i might be narrow minded but that's the way i feel

166.18 167.78 A: well um 

169.61 179.08 A: a homosexual lifestyle i don't think that uh i don't think that i don't agree i don't believe that that's right i don't believe that my kids should have should be able to have access to 

171.03 171.93 B: okay 

179.12 182.87 A: um books that promote homosexuality or 

183.11 185.41 A: (( um or promiscuity ah ev- uh you )) 

184.86 185.70 B: uh-huh 

185.71 200.52 A: know or books like that and i knew that when i was in high school you know there was books of that nature in there and it was wasn't uh well known about but if you wanted 'em you could find 'em 

202.12 210.09 B: um do you believe this more because of personal reasons or more of a religious because of your religious feel- beliefs 

211.09 217.54 A: i believe that uh um well that my my religious beliefs are my personal beliefs 

217.02 217.98 B: okay 

218.36 219.70 A: (( um i i don't )) 

220.30 222.22 A: it's i don't 

221.27 223.80 B: so th- they work together i guess 

223.36 226.87 A: right right i don't believe that um 

229.12 233.92 A: [mn] this is really getting off the topic here but i don't believe that being uh 

234.47 238.03 A: a homosexual is wrong i just believe acting on it is 

237.92 239.55 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

239.92 243.01 A: and so i'm going to have and i'm i you know 

243.40 246.55 A: that's me [laughter] that's wh- and that's why 

246.91 252.21 A: you know don- i just don't want my kids exposed to that stuff if i can protect them as long as i can 

252.52 254.56 A: i'm going to do so [noise] 

254.05 258.35 B: but you know you know sooner or later they will 

257.68 259.58 A: oh i'm sure they will 

260.30 262.67 A: but hopefully they'll have enough um 

262.96 266.23 A: uh background to make good decisions 

265.68 266.62 B: okay 

266.85 269.04 A: um i i don't know i 

269.96 272.23 A: (( it when i was in high school )) 

272.61 273.73 A: um 

274.04 278.36 A: i know i just didn't in general in everything i didn't make the best decisions 

278.36 279.73 B: mhm 

279.53 284.89 A: so hopefully they'll have a little more background to make their decisions on before they're exposed to that kind of stuff [noise] 

284.44 285.32 B: okay 

287.50 290.19 B: yeah th- i mean i guess 

290.46 293.35 B: all of this arises mainly from religion 

293.32 294.36 A: mhm 

293.84 298.99 B: and like th- the one of the main things like jews and the nazis 

298.75 300.52 A: mhm 

300.00 305.52 B: those type of books also and i think religion has a big part in all of this 

305.80 307.36 B: and the books i guess 

309.50 312.15 A: i mean do you feel that um [lipsmack] 

313.43 316.06 A: uh books about 

316.32 320.54 A: [lipsmack] sex education should be available to students in in high schoo- in 

320.90 323.12 A: in junior school libraries 

322.82 328.46 B: i think the more a student is educated in anything 

328.65 331.90 B: is better for the student 

331.91 336.66 B: 'cause everything i've learned i've pretty much like it's helped me in some sort or another 

336.60 337.37 A: (( mhm )) 

336.79 342.62 B: and i guess the more you know the more you can like 

342.92 346.67 B: um react to things in a correct manner 

347.05 350.95 B: and i think i think you should get a taste of everything in a sense 

350.27 351.54 A: mhm 

352.44 353.63 B: so you can 

354.00 356.56 B: react well to it in any man- 

355.32 356.77 A: do you have any children 

357.16 358.87 A: james do you have children

420.05 424.18 A: [noise] [sigh] you learn as much as you can stay in school as long as you can [noise] 

425.43 426.07 B: (( [noise] )) 

427.84 431.41 B: i guess we shouldn't get off off topic too much [laughter] 

430.76 432.93 A: uh yeah you're right we shouldn't 

432.97 434.03 A: um 

437.11 438.23 A: (( [lipsmack] would [mn] )) 

439.32 441.64 A: what would you consider 

443.31 447.30 A: um unacceptable to be in a library right now if anything 

448.28 449.87 B: unacceptable 

449.36 452.80 A: uh what kind of books would you consider unacceptable [noise] 

454.19 455.36 B: (( i guess )) 

458.89 460.40 B: uh 

462.50 464.79 B: (( i don't know what to tell you um )) 

465.28 466.01 B: (( [noise] )) 

467.96 475.01 B: mm i can't really think of something that totally stands out that i would like not want to see 

475.62 477.52 B: you know obviously 

478.83 483.24 B: um homosexuality isn't something that should be like all over the place 

483.30 485.32 A: mhm 

485.63 491.43 B: and for like younger like places where younger 

491.64 494.85 B: um younger people go to i guess 

495.33 497.04 B: even um 

497.19 499.97 B: anything having to do with sex shouldn't be there either 

502.12 507.33 B: [noise] because they're just too young to like even w- want to know about that stuff 

507.39 509.20 A: mhm 

510.46 516.39 A: what do you think about private schools i mean does a private school have a right to tell the kids [noise] what books 

515.56 518.66 B: [mn] well private schools i mean 

519.49 521.60 B: they're set up in a way 

522.01 525.31 B: that they're kind of allowed to do what they want to do 

525.26 526.86 A: mhm 

527.31 529.85 B: and so if they don't want their students 

530.39 534.36 B: to be reading some type of books i guess it's all right 

534.75 546.29 B: because i mean the people if if they if they want their students to read that kind of books then go to a regular school you're paying to go to a um private school and i guess 

546.85 550.47 B: not reading a certain type of book will come with it obviously 

549.94 551.13 A: mhm 

550.82 556.23 B: and i guess plus the private schools are also um 

556.53 558.29 B: based on religion 

558.37 559.14 A: (( mhm )) 

558.39 560.14 B: different religion so 

561.14 565.37 B: that will help 'em also prevent certain types of books from being there 

567.24 575.14 A: so do you think the government has any business telling the public schools what books they can and cannot have in the library 

574.59 575.61 B: of course 

576.25 577.36 B: of course 

577.62 582.43 B: 'cause there are many things that just i guess shouldn't be taught to students 

582.90 587.83 B: i mean a library could have a book about like bomb building of course it shouldn't be there 

587.72 588.65 A: uh-huh 

588.59 594.37 B: and the government puts a stop to it and makes makes it safer for us 

594.97 598.67 A: so you believe in some cen- some forms of censorship 

598.60 599.95 B: (( yeah [noise] ))
