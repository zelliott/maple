452.26 453.08 A: (( uh [mn] )) 

457.88 465.56 B: myself since i just you know i have a basic idea of what affirmative action is which is hiring people based on uh 

462.53 463.87 A: (( uh-huh mhm mhm mhm )) 

465.73 479.34 B: i believe it's about hiring them you know due to race or you know like uh a certain company might need to hire [noise] you know so many minorities whether they be black hispanic [noise] 

479.23 484.30 B: um [noise] uh so many women [noise] y- you know 

484.22 485.18 A: oh yeah 

484.38 488.71 B: [noise] um i i i believe that's that's the basic uh 

488.83 493.41 B: concept behind affirmative action [noise] and uh 

491.31 492.43 A: mhm 

493.45 496.47 B: (( and that's [mn] you know )) 

494.58 501.02 A: i would well i i would uh agree with uh part of it not all of it 

500.47 502.05 B: right 

501.39 505.70 A: so like like you said if you're like the 

505.79 508.33 A: having hi- you have to hire a certain amount 

508.35 511.32 A: of a person of a certain 

508.41 509.44 B: right 

511.33 514.56 A: uh a certain race or a certain uh 

514.60 515.78 A: (( certain [noise] )) 

516.29 524.35 A: uh certain uh gender or something like that that'd be hard for uh for some companies right 

519.49 520.69 B: mhm 

524.06 525.17 B: right 

524.55 525.44 A: uh 

525.70 540.60 A: for like laborers or something like that like the womens are are are like uh not physically it's not capable of right and like and like uh construction and stuff like that like 

528.63 529.78 B: mhm 

535.48 537.24 B: right 

540.01 542.64 B: right 

541.18 544.25 A: (( it's uh like uh the iron workers )) 

543.91 546.77 B: mhm 

544.34 550.20 A: uh like hardly hardly any womens like works there right but 

549.60 550.49 B: right 

550.67 556.76 A: that's what i think but uh but race race is like 

557.62 559.51 A: it's different right it's like 

560.23 561.30 A: people 

560.69 563.57 B: (( right )) 

562.15 571.74 A: if they're qualified they they'll hire 'em but like if they're not qualified they're they're forced to hire them so i i'm a little bit against it 

568.51 570.30 B: right 

571.85 572.90 A: and so 

572.24 574.35 B: right well someone should be uh 

575.23 580.20 B: y- you know qualifi- definitely you know definitely be qualified for 

580.49 583.36 B: for the job and not hired y- you know 

584.19 591.10 B: uh because of you know their race or gender [noise] [mn] a- y- you know um 

587.46 588.59 A: mhm mhm 

592.47 599.95 B: now i know with uh [sigh] i don't know if this is part of affirmative action but i know um
