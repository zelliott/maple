35.55 36.46 A: (( all right )) 

35.69 39.37 B: i mean i don't think we even have to disagree though do we 

38.76 44.38 A: i have no idea i really don't know how this works i just kinda signed up for it 'cause i thought it was you know it's going to 

44.42 45.41 A: and giggles 

45.03 47.94 B: yeah cool it's like ten dollars why not 

47.32 52.02 A: why not exactly exactly so like what was the topic again censorship with 

48.50 49.52 B: so 

51.07 55.33 B: yeah censor- should scho- yeah in schools 

52.42 53.93 A: with reading books 

54.50 60.15 A: all right well let's i i'll take the side of yeah there there should be no censorship 

55.48 56.39 B: so 

59.57 61.43 B: yeah there shouldn't be uh 

61.77 64.57 B: so okay so you want me to take the other side all right 

63.86 70.37 A: i did i mean all i i i it's okay now i got ya now i got ya no you can take that there shouldn't be and i'll take that there should be how's that 

70.00 72.05 B: it it's fine um 

71.18 73.61 A: [laughter] 

72.70 76.51 B: so okay yeah so there shouldn't absolutely not be uh 

76.92 89.22 B: there there shouldn't be censorship because i mean you know th- when does it stop if you start at you know you start at taming of the shrew or something like that you know wh- when does it get to a certain point where 

89.67 96.86 B: a- anything that's uh objectionable is is is banned and and that's you know okay have that 

93.81 94.69 A: okay 

96.25 101.53 A: now let's now let's take on on the the other side of the coin where you say well 

101.56 105.64 A: you have a book like um 

105.92 108.49 A: i don't know uh catcher in the rye 

108.08 109.39 B: right 

108.75 109.73 A: where 

109.97 119.91 A: you could argue that it is corruption of the young and if you read plato's apology which is basically the trial of socrates who was on trial for 

119.88 123.57 A: corrupting the young well it falls into the same category where 

123.51 132.36 A: the young are going to get the notions of homosexuality and things that are deemed taboo or bad in our society and why 

132.18 145.06 A: why it's you know everything that we talked about is for the children then why are we going to teach the children all these things that our society deems bad now i'm not saying that i agree with it i'm just playing the other side of the coin 

144.25 145.56 B: right right 

144.99 150.14 A: i don't i i personally believe that there should be no censorship whatsoever that 

149.15 151.37 B: right absolutely because 

151.74 159.00 B: the the thing with children the thing that always gets me when people talk about how they want to protect children is that children are be are become adults 

159.07 172.10 B: and if you you keep all these things from them and are so worried about protecting them and they become adults they they have no knowledge the point of being a child is to learn 

171.98 173.19 A: exactly 

172.11 178.17 B: and you have to learn everything you know you have to learn everything in order to be a a 

178.62 180.71 B: you know to be a productive adult 

180.71 185.14 A: right and and the only way to learn things is to read things [noise] 

184.24 196.08 B: well to read things to experience things to see things you know you can't th- this idea that children have to be protected from the world is ridiculous because when they become adults they're not prepared for it 

196.33 198.03 A: no not not 

196.87 199.15 B: and the ones and the ones that are 

199.27 202.11 B: you know they become like they're they're victims 

202.42 206.72 A: mhm and and they play the card of you know well you know 

206.84 210.50 A: this is why i'm like this and this is why i'm like that and it's 

210.62 212.95 A: and in order to have 

212.97 215.80 A: you know a a society where 

215.67 223.52 A: 'cause we're never going to be able to be to the point where it's going to be everyone's going to be on the same side there's always going to be those that think well because of the more indignation of 

223.49 232.11 A: certain books a certain television show certain movies certain music that it's going to corrupt the young and it's n- you know it's it's in the a philosophy of western thoughts for 

232.12 245.98 A: you know five thousand years and it's it's something that we need to kinda you know we say this to every generation is we net to get information for the younger children to understand what is right what is wrong what is just and what is unjust 

246.08 247.90 B: (( right )) 

246.47 260.63 A: and is you know it's hard to do that when you ha- when you're censoring stuff it you know you need to have the marketplace of ideas you need to have everyone being able to have their say 'cause through that the truth will come out the truth you know if you're going to follow that that kind of logic 

260.14 262.91 B: yeah absolutely absolutely 

262.19 268.87 A: so by by having the censorship of of books in schools you you're not you're you're 

268.96 271.25 A: you're stifling a child's 

271.61 273.90 A: cognitive and educational purposes 

274.06 276.84 A: they're not they're not going to be able to understand what's 

277.26 282.00 A: you know what is real what is what is going on you know it's it's it's it's 

282.27 284.93 A: it's hard it's very very very hard 

284.72 293.80 B: i think the other part of it then also is who makes the decision of what should be banned and what shouldn't and what is their agenda 

291.05 292.77 A: right and and that 

293.15 296.76 A: right e- e- exactly exactly and that's you know that's 

297.60 299.34 A: that's that's the hard part [sigh] 

299.06 303.49 B: if you have you know if you say you have a person who's very religious 

303.58 309.00 B: then they're going to want to ban all sort of things that go against their religion 

308.93 310.69 A: yeah 

309.59 313.70 B: whereas a person who's secular might want to ban all things that are religious 

314.05 322.12 B: and neither one of those is good you know and 'cause both sides should be able to be heard or 

321.62 322.29 A: yeah 

322.35 330.02 A: you're not going to you know people their the problem with people is that they they don't like to listen to other sides of uh other viewpoints but 

330.15 341.74 A: we're so set in our ways where we can't be able to listen to what people are saying without all of a sudden getting all defensive if it doesn't agree with our beliefs and our values 

341.52 353.60 B: no you're a absolutely right i i've one of the things i've seen by going online and stuff like that is how people put themselves inside of these l- little communities where everybody agrees with them 

353.01 354.70 A: oh that's horrible 

354.14 354.61 B: and 

354.60 360.74 B: anyone who comes in that doesn't agree is is like completely uh you know 

360.73 372.76 B: attacked or flamed or whatever they want to call it you know and and it becomes like just these sort of sycophants that all believe in the same thing and and it's ridiculous 'cause no one wants to hear any sort of opposing view 

372.78 375.81 A: mhm yeah and and it's 

374.80 375.36 B: (( [mn] )) 

375.88 383.00 A: and once someone says an opposing view on one of these web sites then it all all shit breaks loose 

382.49 384.31 B: (( yeah well )) 

383.21 395.94 A: whereas you know if you go if you go on to a a web site that's talking about anti bush and then someone comes on and says well bush is great that person that says bush is great is is going to get chastised by the rest of that site 

395.57 402.42 B: he's going to be attacked by everybody in it be- because they don't want anyone coming in there who disagrees with them 

397.57 398.89 A: yeah it it's 

401.39 404.71 A: no not not at al- mean wh- what do you do for a living 

404.67 406.56 B: uh i'm a student 

405.93 407.53 A: you're a student okay 

406.58 408.28 B: yeah 

407.94 410.10 A: now i guess that's you know one of these 

410.22 412.63 A: wh- [laughter] i should have figured that out with the uh 

412.80 417.20 A: i can only see really students participating in this thing student what do you study 

416.97 418.63 B: uh computer science 

418.57 419.42 A: okay 

419.39 420.40 B: what about you 

420.45 427.21 A: um i i actually just finished grad school and i'm starting a phd program in the fall for communication 

427.00 429.20 B: oh really that's cool 

427.93 428.85 A: yeah 

429.23 431.44 A: so yeah i'm i'm the perma student 

431.51 433.96 A: [laughter] i realize that i don't want to get a job 

433.65 437.08 B: yeah no who wants a job [laughter] jobs suck 

435.17 436.02 A: no 

437.08 438.21 A: [laughter] 

438.43 442.36 A: yeah so it it's basically you know i just stay in school get 

442.20 455.04 A: you know the education and hopefully make it better [noise] and do this you know and and this all ties back to censorship where i you know like being in front of a classroom i can i am the ultimate censor where i can tell them what to read and what not to read 

454.34 455.56 B: right right 

454.93 467.94 A: but i don't tell them what not to read i give 'em well this is what you should read this is what i'm telling you to read and if you find something else please read it and if it's an opposing view let's discuss it in class if it makes it that the class that much more fun 

469.19 471.17 A: (( [lipsmack] where where are you located )) 

470.66 472.94 B: um i'm located in new york 

472.63 475.05 A: (( oh you're in new york okay i'm in i'm in jersey )) 

473.33 474.54 B: (( yeah )) 

474.96 476.22 B: new jersey 

475.86 477.50 A: yeah my thoughts are ever 

477.92 479.46 B: yeah um 

479.99 485.61 B: what so but you know what i tell you one ting about communications 'cause i actually had to take some some of those classes 

485.37 486.17 A: uh-huh 

486.17 494.94 B: and uh it's actually very fun it really is it's it's if i wasn't into the computer thing i would have definitely have gotten into that because 

494.06 494.85 A: (( yeah it )) 

495.10 496.32 B: because it 

495.10 496.96 A: it's a it's a yes

497.78 498.98 A: (( no no just continue )) 

498.80 509.59 B: oh i just i was you know it's it really is it's a lot of fun it's uh the whole 'cause it you know i mean who w- who doesn't want to be like on the radio or television or something like that 

509.00 510.90 A: nah i mean and there's there's 

511.12 518.96 A: but you know that's one of the things that i try and tell the students is that there's [noise] the communications field really and literally is wide open 

519.50 522.87 A: anything that you do is going to involve communication 

522.52 524.44 B: (( right )) 

522.98 529.43 A: it could it could be through television it could be through film it could be the through radio through newspapers through 

529.61 543.68 A: you know interpersonal rea- interactions you know students students ask me you know like w- w- why do you why are you going for your 'cause i also teach you you know w- why are going of for you ph in communication when you can go out and get a job well i can go out and get a job but i don't you know 

537.15 537.89 B: (( mm )) 

543.88 549.96 A: i want to be the you know a professor and be able to explain to you to you guys that like hey look you know 

550.00 557.47 A: the world out there thinks in numerous ways and this is the way that i like to think about the world through a communication process 

557.76 562.34 A: and i you know that's essentially one of the things that we talk about 

562.43 564.30 A: a lot is censorship 

564.83 567.94 A: and i you know i don't know that much about computers 

567.49 569.07 B: mhm 

568.55 571.17 A: i don't know do you do you study um 

571.21 575.34 A: like online stuff or do you study the actual computer itself 

574.49 577.36 B: ah like i- it just basically like 

577.23 589.09 B: [mn] technology in terms of uh programming stuff like that the whole general sort of science of it but in that too there's a lot of censorship and what can be 

580.91 581.99 A: okay 

588.96 596.84 B: accessible like they just had the the war with public libraries being able to uh not have filters 

596.96 599.95 B: and so that now that the c- public libraries libraries ha-
