460.83 463.42 A: what did we say and what did we agree to 

462.70 469.36 B: [laughter] yeah that's the thing 'cause my dad w- he had wh- he was working with his um brother in law and a friend of his 

463.92 464.70 A: and if 

468.88 470.12 A: (( uh-huh [noise] [mn] ))

475.12 488.82 B: [mn] that's enough of that the other brother in law is like whoa he's like [mn] he wasn't he didn't want to pay his part of the rent for the uh spa- office space he didn't want to do anything so my dad had to like leave on his own again to like start up his own business again like for the third time [noise] 

481.14 482.04 A: yeah 

482.71 484.02 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

488.68 490.02 A: wow 

488.90 489.67 B: [mn] 

489.98 492.24 B: which was like you know [mn] 

491.98 497.56 A: [mn] [noise] so your father had to kinda like s- start again for the for three eh three times 

494.88 496.61 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

496.62 497.58 B: (( [noise] yeah [mn] )) 

497.83 505.62 A: oh well [lipsmack] yeah when i when we qu- quit talking i'll remember that you know [mn] 'cause there are a lot of 

503.70 505.33 B: yeah 

506.16 512.09 A: [mn] times we get discouraged and i yeah that's cool i mean that he didn't give up and didn't quit okay 

511.52 521.92 B: yeah 'cause he was working actually for a company [mn] and something happened and he got fired or laid off or something so it was like you know what i'm starting my own business [mn] 'cause he actually started working off i mean from home 

514.40 515.57 A: [mn] okay 

521.51 524.19 A: [mn] oh right oh right oh right 

521.84 527.94 B: [mn] until he had enough money to like save up and you know be able to rent space office space and stuff 

524.53 525.56 A: oh 

527.36 529.17 A: (( [mn] [mn] [noise] okay [noise] )) 

528.93 530.60 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

529.45 535.26 A: so he he had his home [mn] his office was in his home oh [laughter] [mn] 

533.20 535.04 B: yeah 

535.72 537.05 A: excellent 

537.33 545.09 A: [mn] you know i i really admire people who [mn] start out kind of humbly and they're like self made people [noise] 

541.49 548.94 B: yeah yeah true true i'm like i wish i had that kind of you know [mn] like [mn] 

549.03 557.45 B: business sense and savvy to like you know to do all of that you know to be like that successful and like enjoy myself [noise] yeah [mn] 

550.32 551.50 A: [laughter] sense 

556.40 557.79 A: [mn] well your 

558.07 562.10 A: your father like took a chance that everything would work out and he could do it 

561.56 563.25 B: yeah 

562.71 575.27 A: and because like i i admire my uncle much more than my cousin 'cause my cousin inherited everything [mn] and by the time he he died my cousin everything was done for her 

567.34 568.42 B: [laughter] 

569.22 571.05 B: yeah

578.72 584.37 A: she has the skills and she has the know how [mn] but [noise] it was all like placed in her lap 

579.96 582.63 B: yeah 

583.70 592.97 B: yeah [mn] plus uh p- i think she probably had to learn it she was around her dad a lot right so she probably picked up a few you know tricks of the trade and all that 

588.24 589.63 A: [mn] she 

590.29 591.44 A: yes as 

591.52 599.95 A: yes [mn] and like she would [mn] work at the nursery she work [mn] you know behind the cash register 'cause he was like [mn] getting her ready 

597.29 598.98 B: yeah 

599.42 599.95 B: yeah
