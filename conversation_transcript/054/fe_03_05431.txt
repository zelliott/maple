9.85 11.03 A: oh neat 

10.90 25.71 A: all the way across the country [laughter] [sigh] okay [sigh] well how ah i know public schools here i guess we s- should get right to the topic [sigh] um have a gotten a bad rap in orlando mostly because of ah parts of the transient population and some other things how are public schools in washington [mn] 

12.43 13.30 B: yep 

25.62 33.69 B: [sigh] u- um they're not too bad [sigh] ah washington state's [sigh] budget is bad and we're we're currently ah [sigh] 

33.83 45.87 B: struggling with our governor to [sigh] he made some promises when he was elected to office and and [sigh] now it seems that he's opting to ah back out of them and so 

43.80 44.88 A: (( uh-hum mm )) 

45.89 53.72 B: [sigh] the teachers and t- those [sigh] individuals that work in the school system are rallying rallying to ah 

54.05 56.82 B: convince him to carry through with his promises 

56.63 59.96 A: [laughter] uh-hum okay [sigh] so is he cutting back budgets and [lipsmack] 

59.71 60.95 B: (( well ah )) 

61.88 75.66 B: [sigh] [lipsmack] b- basically it comes down to the boeing deal i don't know if you've seen it on the t._v. they've been ah boeing is going to be building a new airplane he's g- going to give them [sigh] ah three billion dollars in tax breaks 

69.27 70.49 A: (( uh-hum )) 

75.22 76.87 A: [cough] nice [sigh] 

76.25 88.74 B: s- so it's not we we're looking at it from the point of view you know what's the most important here sure w- we're having building a new airplane would be j- jobs an- an and in y- you know [sigh] that process but 

85.91 86.76 A: uh-hum 

88.82 94.06 B: [sigh] i think the schools are more important an educated workforce is far more important than [sigh] 

95.31 96.38 A: oh [lipsmack] yeah that has 

95.32 98.18 B: or as important anyway [sigh] 

97.32 107.50 A: right [sigh] well i think um as as far as w- what goes on here in florida every governor and every public of- official for the past um [mn] i don't know maybe fifteen y- years has talked education 

107.29 110.88 A: [sigh] they instituted a lottery here um i graduated high school in 

110.77 125.45 A: ninety t- three [sigh] ah they instituted a lottery here back wen i was in like fifth grade s- so i guess well i would be able to do the math if the schools were good [sigh] but um the lottery is supposed to feed public education a- and instead it's turned from a um [lipsmack] rob peter to pay paul scenario 

125.23 128.54 A: they use lottery money sure but they t- take the funding away elsewhere [sigh] 

125.39 126.71 B: (( yeah )) 

128.51 143.40 A: and what th- what part of what that's caused and part of the crisis i don't know if it's really like crisis but part of the problem i see here in public schools is that [sigh] ah they are underfunded they are ah dealing with a v- very large classrooms and you know o- one teacher to many classrooms or many students um [lipsmack] 

140.05 141.26 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

143.32 158.01 A: it's hard to get across and give individual attention to every student [sigh] i it's un- not uncommon for teachers to buy supplies out of their own income which here in the state of florida at least is ridiculously low um in especially for somebody with a four year degree [lipsmack] 

156.98 157.77 B: (( yep [noise] )) 

157.84 164.57 A: and so they're running short on supplies they ah are under funded over crowded [sigh] and ah 

164.51 177.55 A: then we also have t- the it's not it's a challenge to integrate s- so many people from different ah social and ethnic backgrounds and not offend somebody so we're also really c- clamping down on [sigh] what can and cannot be said in the classrooms to the point where [sigh] 

177.38 180.92 A: it almost becomes unreasonable [mn] and so 

179.42 181.19 B: yeah same here 

180.86 193.82 A: yeah so you're you're you're ah stiffling the flow of education and um and of thought and language back and forth [sigh] ah nothing gets anybody of any ethnic groups by any means but um [sigh] you know certainly there has to be some give and take there [noise] and it's 

184.12 185.12 B: yep 

192.64 194.67 B: yeah i agree 

193.89 195.62 A: [sigh] yeah and even 

195.45 209.91 A: ah even more important than an educated work force in my opinion is is an educated person a whole person somebody that can ah [laughter] deduce and [sigh] and reason [sigh] ah what wa- what were your p- public school exp- experiences like [sigh] were you in public school uh-hum 

201.09 203.34 B: mm true very true 

209.32 213.78 B: oh yeah i ah grew up in indiana originally [sigh] and ah [sigh] 

212.38 213.24 A: (( okay [sigh] )) 

213.80 219.10 B: my school was ah well that's the that's the [sigh] um 

219.37 225.16 B: t- the green belt part of the country there and so my school was little i graduated in ah 

225.49 227.22 B: [sigh] nineteen seventy eight [sigh] 

226.78 227.89 A: (( uh-hum )) 

227.47 231.19 B: and ah you know there was there was all of ah 

231.44 235.56 B: twenty eight students in my graduating class and eleven of us were boys 

235.08 236.75 A: uh-hum [laughter] right 

236.04 243.64 B: [sigh] ah but my wife on the other hand was b- born and raised here in washington state and there was s- something like ah a couple of hundred [noise] 

243.76 247.13 B: six hundred she says s- students in her class 

245.25 246.18 A: (( wow uh-hum mm )) 

247.16 248.72 B: (( [sigh] so [sigh] )) 

248.76 255.86 B: ah there again your point about being over crowded [sigh] that's also a location thing i think you know [sigh] 

255.49 256.77 A: (( uh-hum )) 

256.48 265.60 B: m- my school when i went to school didn't s- seem to have a problem with funding or overcrowding it was just a a r- rural school 

265.61 269.21 B: you know out in the the cornfields basically [sigh] 

269.22 270.62 B: and so [sigh] 

270.79 282.88 B: but ah here in washington state there are a lot of teachers that are leaving here because of their income level and going to california or other states that are offering them more money per hour 

276.87 277.93 A: (( uh-hum uh-hum [noise] wow uh-hum [sigh] )) 

282.58 283.80 A: okay you uh-hum 

282.94 286.32 B: and that's one of their b- big issues with the governor is 

286.73 292.55 B: [mn] that's one of the things he promised [sigh] and he's wanting to back out on it now so [noise] 

292.36 300.15 A: [sigh] ah that that's tough and we're having we're having a teacher crisis here as well we're trying to draw people from other other states give them bonuses to come here [sigh] 

300.04 314.34 A: um but i'm sure we're drawing from some of the poorer states in turn because ah th- they're still not being paid very much [sigh] how do you v- view the youth coming out of um the schools today i can tell you we use interns at ah the company that i work f- for and they're in college by this time 

314.22 325.90 A: [sigh] but um s- some of them seem to be r- really on the ball um from public education um others i kind of look at and say w- what's going on here you also have a four year degree huh [laughter] you know and [sigh] ah 

325.75 331.67 A: some of the youth i look at including my brother who um smart kid but [sigh] public school really didn't do him 

331.67 332.89 A: so well 

331.79 334.02 B: any good yeah y- 

332.72 337.08 A: yeah he he kind of fell fell through the cracks a little bit in some cases [sigh] do you ah [sigh] 

336.90 349.75 A: do you um see um a difference between [sigh] not just the generation gap between the kids now and when you were growing up and maybe um [lipsmack] their ability to cope and adapt from adapt from ah [noise] the education they got in public schools [sigh] 

349.11 351.85 B: yes i do [sigh] they they're [sigh] 

350.15 351.02 A: (( yeah uh-hum )) 

352.03 353.66 B: (( you know a a a um [lipsmack] )) 

354.51 364.14 B: i've got a twenty one year old son that ah [sigh] i don't [sigh] you know he he he finished school but i he just [sigh] um 

360.31 361.14 A: (( uh-hum hm )) 

364.34 368.74 B: [lipsmack] i don't know [sigh] h- he j- just isn't as mature 

369.68 375.52 B: or wasn't as mature at that time as as i h- had expected him to be i guess i don't know 

375.68 384.10 B: [sigh] but yeah there a- are a lot of ah a- a- ah there are two young fellows that that ah are in the country i work with that are j- just ah [sigh] 

384.46 394.96 B: i mean yeah like you said they're smart [sigh] but maybe it's more um what i'm looking at is the attitude i- it seems to me t- that they have this ah um 

391.05 392.06 A: (( [sigh] uh-hum oh )) 

394.99 409.55 B: you know i accomplished high school now t- the world owes me something kind of thing and i'm like you know hey [sigh] you got to work just like the rest of us you know you come in you do your time you get your monies you know and [sigh] i don't know [sigh] 

397.85 399.78 A: [laughter] 

402.52 403.93 A: right right uh-hum 

406.37 407.21 A: (( uh-hum )) 

409.27 420.83 A: [mn] oh that that is interesting well so you would say that definitely then the public schools need to be addressed and and ah d- something needs to be done to raise education level or may be the accountability level [sigh] all the way round [sigh] 

417.97 420.11 B: oh yeah definitely 

420.38 421.93 B: all the way round 

421.36 433.51 A: yeah it it one thing they it's a little bit off top- sub subject but ah professional ball players some of those guys get you know out of college with a degree in communications apparently and they can't p- put three words together to make a sentence [sigh] a- ah 

432.63 434.18 B: (( [sigh] some of 'em yeah it's )) 

433.58 437.40 A: (( s- some of 'em you know i wouldn't want to classify all of them [sigh] um )) 

437.75 450.19 A: i mean certainly it it doesn't do every kid [sigh] um t- the way it should e- especially if it's a mandatory compulsory thing that you have to go to a public school [sigh] it seems like they should be able to c- come out with um [mn] a certain education level 

450.36 451.97 A: (( you know a certain education that they )) 

450.72 462.22 B: yeah [sigh] there was a [sigh] with my so- my oldest son there was a deal here [mn] this was ah let's see it was eighth ninth grade in school [lipsmack] and ah [lipsmack] 

459.34 460.24 A: uh-hum 

463.36 471.24 B: w- ah parent teacher conferences okay i had to go in to the school with him and sit down and talk with the teacher about his progress well [sigh] 

465.98 466.75 A: (( uh-hum )) 

471.33 474.42 B: he was getting a low grade in mathematics 

474.02 475.23 A: uh-hum 

474.63 486.07 B: [sigh] so we sat down with the teacher and as it turned out [sigh] the reason he was getting a low grade in mathematics is because he hadn't done his homework but yet she had seven or eight tests 

486.34 499.03 B: [sigh] for the year or t- the sum- trimester or whatever it is we were t- talking about [sigh] sitting here on the desk that he had taken in in the math course and he'd got an a pluses on 'em the test 

493.64 494.46 A: uh-hum 

498.22 499.93 A: (( uh-hum uh-hum [laughter] right [sigh] )) 

499.58 510.66 B: so my argument was o- o- okay granted he didn't do the work like he should have [sigh] but if he's getting a pluses on the test it proves he knows the material 

505.39 506.32 A: (( uh-hum )) 

508.15 509.23 A: [laughter] 

510.22 511.54 A: yeah 

511.10 517.05 B: why is he failing [sigh] well g- basically it come down to he didn't do the homework 

516.62 518.99 A: (( so he didn't complete the assignment )) 

517.98 519.45 B: (( [sigh] right )) 

518.86 525.38 A: yeah [sigh] and i you know i had the problem one of my m- most memorable experiences was from one of my humanities classes i had in high school [sigh] 

525.15 538.41 A: and i i was getting a d. even though i was acing all the tests i knew well not acing i was getting you know like ah high bs lowest [sigh] and the reason why i had the d. is because i refused to keep a folder of my past work [mn] 

538.18 549.80 A: and and i argued and i mean i took even even i had to take it to the principal and i said this is r- ridiculous i've already been graded on it i mean why is this [sigh] you know [sigh] a significant [laughter] portion of my grade i've already done this work this is 

549.69 558.14 A: you know why am i keeping a folder and being graded on how i keep a folder and this is humanities this is not organization this isn't anything else [sigh] and so it sometimes it 

558.02 570.69 A: maybe what i'm hearing is that they're missing the focus i mean t- the real thing is that you know he learned how to do the the computational problems and he could do them well why is he getting a bad grade because he didn't do the homework obviously he didn't need to [sigh] ah 

560.45 561.66 B: right 

569.62 573.11 B: yeah that that was my point you know if he knows the material 

571.15 571.98 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

573.28 575.23 B: why dread through [sigh] 

575.31 587.24 B: the homework ah ah [sigh] i shouldn't say dread i mean i realize that that the homework is a a practice for those who don't but my point for him was [sigh] you know here's all these tests and everyone of 'em was 

576.23 577.09 A: (( uh-hum [noise] )) 

587.44 599.89 B: [sigh] well above a passing grade on the test and yet she was going to give him a d. minus or so in the class and i just couldn't understand that i mean i could could see if his tests were [sigh] low scores as 

590.11 591.34 A: uh-hum 

595.78 596.88 A: (( uh-hum ))
