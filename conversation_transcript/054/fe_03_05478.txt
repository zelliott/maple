170.17 172.28 A: yeah that's the only thing you can do 

173.69 174.98 A: an individual 

174.83 182.53 B: mean these people that were over there i mean you know who's you know when you go to work in the morning at eight something in the morning or any ti-

229.99 241.08 B: well that's the whole thing see it depends on the type of an attack that it would be now if it's some type of radiation to get and and unless you got a unless you got a bunker 

234.03 235.30 A: (( yeah if )) 

235.50 239.24 A: if it's radiation the food supply won't even any good nothing 

240.65 241.56 A: yeah

244.71 245.27 A: (( [mn] )) 

247.23 259.32 B: politicians and you got these uh ten feet lead thick walls concrete and lead or whatever else they you know and then maybe you flown in all sorts of stuff that wouldn't be able to penetrate right 

251.22 252.08 A: yeah 

257.83 260.81 A: only thing you get through that after 

260.94 262.14 A: gamma rays 

262.41 271.29 A: would come through you can have twelve inches of concrete and your gamma lose a in going through the twelve inch but you'd still make 

265.87 267.71 B: yeah 

271.32 274.69 B: really yeah gamma rays will still get that far 

271.39 275.76 A: it yeah yeah unless it's been what's that 

275.55 278.83 B: (( i said gamma rays will still get that far wow )) 

277.16 281.13 A: yeah they they uh they penetrate about anything 

282.52 287.42 A: but they uh they after a while she got into the stuff between 

282.73 283.89 B: wow 

289.00 295.71 A: somebody about the worst thing you could do in nuclear would be uh your dirty bombers suitcase bombs 

293.64 294.49 B: oh 

295.14 299.57 B: (( yeah it would be yeah like i said i wouldn't even )) 

299.81 307.98 B: if it something like that well let's just go terrorist uh on it if was to go into the thing back in the uh 

308.10 311.38 B: in from satellite like when reagan was up 

311.00 312.67 A: yeah yeah 

312.42 326.99 B: that would be the end if you had one pushing button y- you know you'd have china russia you know that would be it be the fourth of july for like maybe a a [laughter] i don't know how long they last and that would be the end of mankind 

313.22 314.35 A: oh yeah 

315.03 315.89 A: yeah 

315.99 317.70 A: (( yeah )) 

318.73 320.21 A: yep that would be 

326.04 327.95 A: i guess it's best with 

330.10 330.97 A: the 

331.01 332.73 A: with the old man upstairs 

332.65 338.12 B: right and whoever you are uh whoever you believe in yeah that's that's that's for sure that's for sure 

335.11 336.52 A: (( that's right )) 

337.03 337.81 A: yeah 

338.32 340.62 B: that's definitely because uh 

338.94 342.86 A: yeah it's probably best preparation you can do because 

342.96 344.27 A: you're helpless 

344.29 355.43 B: yeah that's what i mean that's what i said when i heard topic it was like you know and preparation for terrorist attack and how would it affect you and you know took on terrorism and it's like uh it's 

347.10 347.66 A: (( [mn] )) 

350.87 352.78 A: (( [laughter] you )) 

355.69 363.81 B: it's a catch twenty two there's nothing you can do and there's few people that that are prepared you know i mean how what 

361.36 364.87 A: can have the government prepared but they can hide a few of their people but 

364.61 371.03 B: that's about it 'cause i mean how are you gonna hide i mean w- like when they hit the pentagon with that plane 

370.35 371.26 A: yeah 

371.02 384.76 B: i mean that just that was a mind thing but imagine if they really you know if if god forbid if they would've been organized and would you know had like uh amassed a mountain of these uh kamikaze pilots or whatever the heck they were 

384.63 389.54 B: they could've destroyed the pentagon you know thank it wasn't thank god 

385.79 386.83 A: that's right 

389.65 393.47 B: but i you know i'll be honest i i i have faith 

393.54 398.92 B: in defence that we have in this country against terrorism i do have faith 

397.24 399.42 A: (( i do too 'cause you know )) 

399.13 400.30 B: because um 

399.69 403.38 A: there hasn't been since then and i guess we have to 

402.42 403.46 B: no 

403.95 404.71 A: (( i )) 

406.25 410.68 B: i i would never you know like i said as far as the terrorist things go 

410.57 417.31 B: i i'm behind i'm behind this country a hundred percent it's my country i'm proud of it and like i said you can't do nothing about 

414.39 415.29 A: am too 

417.08 418.89 B: uh as far as uh 

418.82 432.95 B: politicians and terrorists are concerned you're gonna always have the good and bad in in political arena you know all you can hope for is the lesser of two evils that and you know and you vote 'em into office and that if terrorist attacks come while he's in office 

423.85 425.07 A: (( that's right )) 

433.04 435.74 B: (( that they're the type of uh leader )) 

435.78 439.65 B: that has a head on his shoulders and knows the best 

439.39 440.17 A: (( yep )) 

439.95 444.45 B: you know out at that point for the people of the country because 

441.34 442.08 A: yep 

444.55 450.13 B: i wouldn't want that i wouldn't want that responsibility on my shoulder in the in the case of an attack 

448.37 451.15 A: anybody wants that job deserves it 

451.45 459.18 B: yeah well like i said god bless 'em god bless 'em you know because they got some decisions to make 

453.44 454.97 A: (( that's what i'd say )) 

455.24 457.02 A: yeah well 

457.74 461.56 A: (( one thing yeah )) 

462.02 475.99 B: oh yeah yeah that's for sure that's for sure i mean now you got people that are saying about well where are all these weapons of mass destruct- the difference in my eyes is there's no difference because it was the regime that was dic- he was a dictator anyway 

462.98 463.83 A: (( yeah )) 

474.91 479.93 A: and on top of that e- even though they haven't found the weapons they've found all the plans for them 

479.90 484.38 B: right and on top of it you know you got a guy like that a guy like 

484.48 489.43 B: you know you got loose canons out here you got these individuals that they have this 

489.48 494.75 B: you know [mn] this vendetta against america and americans 

493.61 494.51 A: yeah 

494.82 507.29 B: so i mean y- y- you know it's it's like i said these people went over there attack and this this war over there and was pro everything american and now all of a sudden it's like they're against 

507.24 516.31 B: wait a minute just helped get your country back or you know trying to help you get your country back on its feet and saved you from dictatorship and now you start you know they're killing these people 

512.14 513.32 A: that's right 

514.57 519.62 A: well he's he's still he's still running around running directing things hide out 

518.59 531.40 B: and this is all all of this boils down to terrorism it all boils down to terror- because terrorism and the fact that this guy terrorized his whole country terrorized the people in the country you know 

521.48 522.69 A: that's right 

529.24 530.74 A: they were scared death of 

531.21 543.20 B: yeah scared to death he's tried to terrorize the americans you know [mn] over the years and like i said uh thank god we had a president like we did that it was like okay you know 

536.62 537.58 A: (( him yep ))
