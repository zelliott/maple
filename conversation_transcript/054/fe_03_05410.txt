18.26 20.13 A: mhm 

18.63 27.79 B: [mn] i mean because we uh form relationships with our best friends you know and i guess it would determine on 

27.78 34.61 B: [lipsmack] oh pretty much you know how close you were to your best friend don't you [mn] don't you think 

31.71 32.62 A: yeah

37.30 38.95 B: (( [noise] yeah [lipsmack] )) 

39.24 40.56 B: and uh 

41.30 49.18 B: [sigh] i don't know i i i don't know how you feel but i tend to think for that kind of money i could make a new best friend you know what i'm saying 

49.50 52.53 A: yeah i think i'd do the same thing myself 

52.02 53.83 B: yeah 

54.07 55.08 A: that's what i 

54.15 54.99 B: yeah 

56.92 58.29 A: especially right now

77.37 79.10 B: yeah i'm over here in hollywood dude 

79.22 80.25 A: oh okay 

80.03 90.80 B: anyway it's quite interesting that anonymous benefactor would offer something like that but i i tend to lean with the fact that you know hey i could make me a new best friend you know 

91.02 91.90 B: and when 

92.05 98.32 B: when with with that money i- it well let's be honest mike it's all about the ladies isn't it 

97.93 99.21 A: pretty much 

99.07 102.75 B: (( yeah you know what i'm saying but but uh )) 

102.80 104.94 B: you know i mean because 

105.03 107.37 B: our best friends will change 

107.72 108.89 B: you know you're not 

108.96 114.01 B: unless in rare exceptions you're not gonna have the same best friend 

113.07 114.02 A: (( mhm yeah [noise] )) 

116.07 124.55 B: i mean that's what i think you know [mn] because you don't live most people don't live in the same area you know 

117.78 119.50 A: mhm 

119.77 120.59 A: yeah 

124.60 126.34 A: yeah 

125.28 127.20 B: you know they move and [noise] 

127.56 132.99 B: y- you really can't keep a best friend if you're clear across the other part of the country 

132.21 133.91 A: yeah 

133.04 137.06 B: [noise] like i came from texas and my best friend's still in texas so 

137.08 140.79 B: well actually my best friend now lives out here 

141.06 142.29 B: but uh 

143.34 147.79 B: you know friends come and go and everything like that 

147.06 148.03 A: (( [noise] uh-huh [noise] )) 

147.98 150.51 B: i i j- i just think that uh 

150.73 154.99 B: [noise] that's probably too b- too much money to uh pass up you know 

155.02 156.13 A: (( [lipsmack] uh-huh )) 

155.59 161.03 B: [noise] and and we would we'd find a new best friend you know 

160.95 162.45 A: yeah 

161.84 162.85 B: um 

164.90 166.63 B: (( [lipsmack] and um )) 

167.48 169.51 B: you know i mean and 

169.58 175.00 B: you could do so much with with that money you could help people you 

174.04 175.62 A: mhm 

175.93 184.57 B: know l- like i've got a mom who's sick and needs treatment and i i'd take that money and spend it on her treatment so really i in r- reality you know 

181.25 182.01 A: yeah 

185.08 191.33 B: you you gotta weigh the cost of hey a best friend versus someone you could help 

193.12 198.31 B: and i and i think helping my mom's a lot more important than having a best friend 

197.53 198.31 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

198.37 199.54 B: you know what i'm saying [noise] 

199.56 201.30 A: yeah 

200.36 202.10 B: (( yeah )) 

202.31 203.63 B: and uh 

203.76 205.99 B: you know with uh [lipsmack] 

206.14 211.01 B: with with with that [cough] [mn] you know i mean 

211.16 215.42 B: i tend to lean to the fact that i i'm my own best friend you know 

215.48 216.20 A: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

215.58 218.77 B: so it'd be h- be hard not to speak to me ever again [laughter] it 

219.24 224.79 B: gets a little weird you know what i'm saying yeah [lipsmack] but uh 

221.11 222.42 A: mhm 

226.35 231.21 B: but it is an interesting dilemma you know it's not something you can just 

229.00 230.02 A: yeah 

232.16 240.36 B: just say yeah i'd take the money or no i wouldn't take the money it's something you'd have to think about you can't just off the cuff go 

236.27 236.96 A: (( mm )) 

240.55 242.26 B: (( see ya you know )) 

241.53 243.21 A: yeah 

244.32 248.77 B: i i i just don't think that uh 

249.31 262.34 B: you know it's it's not something easily done but i i think i'd take the money and say you know say goodbye to my best friend 'cause i i'm pretty sure i i'll make a new best friend but anyway this is a test so 

262.55 265.50 B: give me your thoughts so they can hear your speech patterns 

265.67 266.82 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

267.53 269.58 A: i'd pretty much do the same thing 

268.99 270.72 B: yeah 

269.98 271.80 A: mhm 

272.88 275.93 B: you know and and look at the economy we're in right now 

276.24 277.26 A: yeah 

277.10 277.97 B: (( you know )) 

280.16 281.77 B: are you working 

281.68 282.73 A: who me 

282.38 283.58 B: yeah 

283.14 284.35 A: not right now 

284.11 285.34 B: me neither 

285.27 286.79 A: (( is that right )) 

286.16 289.48 B: yeah i got fired back in april 

288.69 289.25 A: (( mm )) 

289.40 290.43 A: (( [mn] for what )) 

290.71 291.56 B: huh 

291.56 292.47 A: (( for what )) 

292.65 293.63 B: uh 

294.02 297.76 B: well i cussed on the floor of the call center i used to work in public storage 

298.51 305.95 B: and uh someone overheard it i didn't cuss to a customer someone overheard it see that's another factor if you're working and making good money 

307.18 314.66 B: you know you're not you may not take the million dollars but you and are in uh in the same boat you know what i'm saying 

310.90 312.16 A: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

315.98 317.20 B: and so 

317.41 319.43 B: you have to look at it that way 

320.17 326.71 B: [noise] i need you know the needs of that money outweigh the fact of having a best friend 

325.93 327.89 A: mhm 

328.42 329.52 B: (( [noise] i don't know )) 

331.67 338.69 B: but then you know in the same respect a lot of people who are married their best friend is their wife you know 

338.76 340.72 A: mhm 

339.91 343.33 B: and that's a lot more there's a lot more at stake 

342.98 344.75 A: yeah 

343.71 345.42 B: in that situation 

345.48 347.96 B: that that might be a different story you know 

348.64 350.01 B: are you married 

350.06 351.30 A: (( who me )) 

350.70 353.64 B: yeah yeah me neither dude 

351.56 352.35 A: (( uh-uh )) 

354.10 354.88 A: so 

354.70 359.09 B: married and unemployed come on down ladies [laughter] 

356.50 357.37 A: is that 

358.09 359.14 A: (( [laughter] )) 

359.51 362.12 B: [noise] but have potential [laughter] you know [mn] 

363.57 364.55 B: (( um )) 

365.06 368.58 B: so i think because you and i are in the boat we're in 

368.61 369.65 B: (( [noise] [noise] you know )) 

368.70 371.16 A: we're just the same 

370.35 372.63 B: we we w- we'd have to take the money 

372.60 374.32 A: yeah 

374.09 374.94 B: (( you know )) 

375.11 377.61 B: are you collecting unemployment 

377.29 378.90 A: (( [noise] nah i mean )) 

379.10 381.36 A: [lipsmack] they didn't wanna give it to me because 

381.70 392.27 A: i told 'em i quit 'cause i don't get i so i quit anyways right and i i messed up and told unemployment that so they was like oh no you gotta go back to work [noise] 

385.75 387.54 B: (( o- yeah )) 

391.91 396.44 B: well you know what [mn] there's some extenuating circumstances there you know 

396.99 398.99 B: where'd you work

424.33 426.36 B: (( you know but uh )) 

426.67 428.91 B: you know getting back to our subject 

429.73 434.42 B: i i tend to wanna know why an anonymous benefactor would do something like that you know 

434.48 436.37 A: mhm 

434.77 439.15 B: do they just have so much money that uh 

439.79 446.80 B: you know they're willing to do something like that you'd have to also consider motivations you know 

446.84 448.17 A: yeah 

447.49 450.71 B: like what's a person's motivation to do something like this 

450.89 452.16 A: (( only )) 

452.47 453.42 B: (( you know )) 

452.81 455.15 A: only thing is money 

455.28 458.86 B: exactly i mean if they had more money than god you know 

460.56 468.10 B: but i i you know in summing up i think that you and i would do the same thing simply because the boat you and i are in 

468.24 469.87 A: (( mm yeah mhm )) 

469.14 470.13 B: you know 

470.54 475.56 B: if we were working making good money something like that might not be s- so uh 

477.37 479.41 B: you know important 

479.38 480.39 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

480.20 483.51 B: and then like i said at the same respect if uh 

483.97 484.81 B: [mn] 

485.14 486.24 B: if um 

486.32 489.24 B: you know we were married and our best friend was our wife 

489.06 490.35 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

490.33 492.24 B: then that's that's another issue 

495.60 498.17 B: you know for another time 

499.36 500.35 B: so 

500.70 504.37 B: i don't know but it's an interesting question and it's 

504.45 507.44 B: it's not what i expected when i picked up this phone you know 

507.40 509.17 A: yeah 

508.54 510.28 B: you know what i'm saying

533.04 533.66 A: (( yeah )) 

533.14 537.69 B: but like i said the topic's very interesting and uh i think that uh 

538.14 540.09 B: [lipsmack] anybody who 

540.53 548.88 B: you know wouldn't take the money must really have a great best friend of like i said their best friend is you know pretty much their wife 

549.34 550.93 A: or if they already have money 

551.28 554.26 B: [noise] yeah that too man that too 

556.01 560.56 B: y- y- you don't know how important money is until you don't have it you know 

559.68 561.37 A: (( [laughter] for real )) 

560.88 562.93 B: (( you know what i'm saying ))

587.54 590.82 B: we're doing this study it's an interesting question 

591.11 594.34 B: poses a thought and a dilemma in my own mind you know 

596.44 597.77 B: (( and um [mn] ))
