0.40 1.77 B: [noise] 

6.85 8.74 A: hi i'm geoff 

6.95 7.96 B: (( [noise] )) 

12.03 13.40 B: (( hi i'm newich )) 

15.10 16.25 A: good to meet you 

16.15 17.33 B: same here 

18.62 25.74 A: th- this is an interesting topic for me because i i've taken college english courses which 

27.10 28.10 A: were 

28.64 30.39 A: which focused on this 

30.44 31.85 A: topic 

31.69 34.40 B: i see the censorship of certain books 

34.67 35.66 A: (( yes )) 

36.31 39.55 A: and censorship in text books 

39.66 41.80 A: for example um 

43.34 47.21 A: one of the big topics i think is 

48.12 54.46 A: talking about um evolution the theory of evolution in 

55.22 56.98 A: school text books 

56.68 57.92 B: i see 

57.82 59.57 A: for um 

59.64 68.75 A: example i never studied evolution until i got to college it was just not part of the curriculum 

67.63 68.98 B: wow 

69.73 72.02 B: i i wonder if that is um [lipsmack] 

72.25 77.84 B: if that's unique to certain geographical areas in the country or if that's nationwide 

78.68 79.94 A: i think 

80.47 83.83 A: in large part it's it's 

84.33 89.30 A: pretty common across the country because it's still 

89.41 95.62 A: controversial i guess with uh especially the christian church 

95.29 96.57 B: right 

95.96 100.40 A: and the evangelical sects 

101.74 110.10 B: now now how do they they do they read do they simply not mention it or they replacing it do they replace it with creationist theories or 

109.63 115.28 A: um well in my experience they just completely avoid the topic altogether 

114.99 121.08 B: wow so so and school children just go through without learning who darwin was or 

121.71 123.19 A: pretty much 

123.24 134.19 A: um i the only time i remember hearing about it really was in history class where it talked about the scopes monkey trial 

133.63 135.85 B: right right 

134.67 136.87 A: in tennessee 

137.04 138.77 B: uh it's pretty amazing 

138.95 144.70 B: what about when it comes to fiction work um uh do they still have lists of banned books 

144.90 148.46 A: uh definitely um 

149.50 151.69 A: i think 

152.50 157.28 A: in my high school library my librarian was 

157.35 164.67 A: kind of liberal and she every time banned book week came round she would have you know big 

165.29 169.84 A: um presentation with you know all these banned books 

169.43 170.67 B: right 

170.66 173.53 A: so she went to a lot of effort to 

174.20 175.29 A: (( i guess )) 

175.82 178.33 A: fight censorship in her own way 

179.71 186.06 B: [mn] i i just i never experienced it so i'd well may- maybe i have and i don- just not aware of it 

186.28 189.99 B: and but i knew there was a a bit of a uproar 

190.19 194.75 B: when um we would have to read passages aloud in books like huckleberry finn 

195.11 201.82 B: and certain you know passages where what we would call uh politically incorrect nowadays 

201.88 208.73 A: [noise] oh yeah that huckleberry finn is a really big one on banned book lists 

208.49 209.65 B: i see 

209.80 211.46 B: and i i remember um 

211.79 215.41 B: other schools read uh salinger catcher in the rye 

215.42 222.55 B: and that was just not on our reading list we didn't have to deal with it i remember seeing something in the paper about it 

223.59 225.69 A: yeah um 

226.31 232.70 A: my most interesting experience was um 

232.83 236.98 A: with a book called the sintar by john steinbeck 

236.61 237.88 B: mhm 

237.29 244.57 A: it kind of just gratitic- gratuitously includes you know the f. word [noise] 

243.64 244.83 B: right 

245.79 250.06 A: which was kind of funny t- to me because i think i was in 

250.41 252.26 A: junior school 

251.67 253.40 B: i see [laughter] 

253.06 262.14 A: and i just found the book and i was like really into mythology and that sort of thing at that point in time so i it kind of caught my eye 

262.22 264.42 A: but it was a really 

265.62 268.84 A: strange little thing to find 

267.32 272.30 B: uh i see and i guess that's the age at which it seems most exciting to find these sorts of books i 

272.45 276.16 B: mean if you pick up a you know a particularly salacious book 

276.61 280.02 B: at at that age then maybe if that's what uh 

280.23 283.88 B: you know concerned educators are so worried about 

284.89 290.60 A: i think in a lot of cases they're more worried about 

290.64 294.38 A: controversial ideas really and they they 

295.15 297.81 A: attach on to you know the 

299.68 302.18 A: dirty language or you know 

302.24 307.85 A: sexual references and so on just to i guess 

309.75 311.71 A: validate their 

311.84 314.71 A: concerns really 

312.76 314.58 B: right 

314.68 315.24 B: (( [cough] )) 

316.03 317.44 B: but it's inter- i mean 

317.50 320.45 B: when we're in they don't sanitize [mn] uh 

320.76 324.86 B: they can only sanitize it so far i suppose right 

325.23 326.65 B: i mean uh 

327.71 334.86 B: th- they they if they want to teach these books which are deemed as classics and these books which everyone should grow up knowing 

327.85 329.54 A: yeah that 

335.34 339.85 B: you know them books like huckleberry finn or books by steinbeck 

340.01 342.00 A: yeah 

343.42 345.26 B: i is there more um [lipsmack] 

345.64 348.06 B: with the with more recent events 

348.19 351.87 B: is there uh growing censorship over books that 

352.82 364.06 B: portray kids making bombs or things like that would it be possible for a a student to go and get a copy of the anarchists cookbook in a school library or 

364.49 367.53 A: in the school well i don't think that's 

368.39 372.59 A: necessary to have that in the school library because 

371.67 373.58 B: i see [laughter] yeah that's true 

372.74 379.24 A: you you can download it off the internet there there are hundreds of places you can find that about 

379.53 382.70 A: i think with the the growing 

383.82 387.66 A: influence of the internet a lot of censorship 

389.03 390.72 A: is you know 

390.83 397.40 A: becoming less and less effective because you have so many more alternative sources 

393.36 394.31 B: right 

397.28 401.75 B: well now we just had that supreme court decision right it was out last week 

401.99 405.85 B: about uh filtering in libraries on web terminals 

405.50 407.76 A: right right [mn] 

408.53 412.46 B: and uh what did they say that it was constitutional for them to filter 

412.80 413.64 B: so 

415.41 420.74 B: although i i don't see how they i didn't see it as too much of a burden i mean if if uh 

421.23 431.75 B: if some site which i legitimately want to see something on for example i guess breast cancer or sexually transmitted diseases i i suppose the computer would normally block these key words 

431.91 437.49 B: but if i really wanted to see those sites it's not too much of a burden for me to go to the library and ask them to unblock it 

437.88 441.42 B: so i wasn't sure what all the uh fuss was about 

442.36 444.48 A: me either really 

444.38 445.90 B: yeah huh 

447.27 451.36 B: so what else did you do you the college course that you took what else did that address 

451.54 452.71 A: [mn] um 

453.12 455.07 A: it talked about 

456.25 459.26 A: authors for example who were 

460.15 466.71 A: [cough] exiled from their native countries because of works they had written that were 

467.01 470.91 A: not in line with the the current political 

471.52 473.02 A: situation 

472.79 473.71 B: wow 

473.11 473.67 A: (( [cough] )) 

473.76 474.74 A: for exa- 

473.76 478.56 B: sorta like uh the satron salmon rushdie right after satanic verses 

476.81 486.66 A: right right that that we um we didn't read satanic verses because it was too big a book but we did we read uh 

483.84 485.04 B: right 

487.01 487.98 A: (( [lipsmack] his )) 

488.38 492.96 A: children's book uh haroun and the sea of sea of stories 

492.29 493.94 B: mhm 

493.06 498.03 A: which talked about a talked a lot about the the conflict between 

498.13 501.40 A: pakistan and india over cashmere 

501.10 502.24 B: i see 

503.17 504.31 A: (( that was )) 

503.23 506.58 B: or was that in dud that book also get him in trouble or 

506.63 507.76 A: um 

507.78 510.08 A: i don't really think so 

509.91 510.91 B: i see [laughter] 

511.61 512.17 A: (( [cough] )) 

511.83 516.16 B: well once he i guess he had been catapulted into the spotlight by that initial 

515.89 522.01 A: [mn] definitely it it did wonders for his career 

516.59 518.26 B: on his head 

521.39 523.58 B: yeah i can imagine [laughter] 

524.68 528.41 A: but it w- it was the first book he had written since 

528.63 534.84 A: the satanic verses and it was something like ten years later i guess and um 

535.27 538.18 A: so he was really careful 

539.24 544.34 A: when he talked about you know for example the 

545.00 549.65 A: hinduism versus islam conflict 

547.98 548.81 B: right 

551.45 553.97 B: you know are there earlier examples or 

554.60 556.82 B: or have you has this thing been going on since 

557.07 561.14 B: for for you know since all of time or is it more recent that 

561.40 564.29 B: people like authors get exiled [laughter] 

564.22 571.95 A: i think well i mean y- there's like in western civilization there's 

571.90 579.55 A: you know the examp- [cough] example of socrates being forced to take the hemlock 

578.14 578.86 B: ta- 

578.93 580.87 B: yeah right the poison 

580.74 587.28 A: which in in my banned books class that was you know the very first thing we read 

587.26 596.16 A: and i think any time you have someone who speaks out in a dissenting 

596.24 599.89 A: way there i- authorities are going to
