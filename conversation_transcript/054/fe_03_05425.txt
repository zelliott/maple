233.45 235.07 B: that's you know 

235.00 248.01 B: kind of a big range of t- time but like within two years after i was there [sigh] people were not allowed to s- stand in the cafeteria [noise] you had to sit at your table the whole time unless you were going into the lunch line it's like [sigh] [laughter] 

237.14 238.16 A: (( [sigh] yeah [sigh] ))
