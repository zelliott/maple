464.76 468.30 A: you know i've got a guy that runs well i got a guy 

468.66 477.33 A: the chief executive officer of our company cedar fair limited is not a college graduate he is actually a college dropout 

477.72 483.05 A: and uh you know that kinda gives all of us other college dropouts a little bit of a 

483.08 486.00 A: incentive to keep the nose to the grindstone 

486.32 497.56 B: yeah well i mean it's yeah well and especially when you're dealing with management i mean like they said i mean mm it's not something you can learn in college i mean [sigh] 

490.53 491.44 A: right 

497.19 501.72 A: it's it's real world uh experience 

501.60 511.66 B: yeah i mean i'm the oldest of eight and yeah i mean there's there's you know there's just things that you learn having to deal with that many different personalities that you'll never learn by [sigh] 

506.79 507.85 A: uh-huh 

512.70 523.33 B: i mean there's no theory behind how to how to make somebody you know happy enough to [laughter] to work and keep the customer happy [laughter] you know 

520.28 521.68 A: right 

522.69 530.81 A: that's that's true a- and a- but it's a learned experience 'cause once you're in that type of a position in the service position 

526.72 527.93 B: yeah 

529.30 529.97 B: (( [noise] )) 

530.85 531.93 A: um 

532.34 537.14 A: you'll know when you didn't please the guests and and eventually you'll learn when you do 

537.30 541.91 A: so it's sort of that type of uh [laughter] trial and error almost 

537.59 539.42 B: oh yeah 

541.25 548.73 B: yeah well i mean one of my favorite managers i mean he got stuck with a store nobody wanted and he turned it into a big thing

560.30 561.17 A: yeah 

561.29 563.09 A: yeah 

566.41 570.38 B: oh i mean yeah i mean if you're willing to work at it you'll always 

570.80 574.86 B: [laughter] well always manage to turn things around 

573.33 574.93 A: [noise] [noise] that's that's true 

575.01 575.83 B: mm bu- 

575.87 581.08 A: i suppose we should try and pull this back into affirmative action though and 

577.95 578.92 B: oh 

579.16 586.15 B: [laughter] well yeah i mean i'm [mn] personally i mean i think affirmative action did like i said did quite a bit of 

581.63 582.84 A: [noise] 

582.85 583.94 A: [noise] 

586.22 592.65 B: good i don't think it's i mean i mean there's always there's you can get a study that'll say either way 

586.82 587.98 A: yeah 

588.59 590.52 A: [noise] 

592.45 593.44 A: right 

592.80 599.06 B: one study that'll say oh affirmative action is done we don't need it anymore and then another study will say oh but [mn] 

599.42 599.89 A: right
