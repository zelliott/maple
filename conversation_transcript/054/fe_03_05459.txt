230.68 232.74 B: court of appeals in ontario 

232.84 237.82 B: uh struck that down and what's dangerous for us in canada is that uh 

239.02 242.62 B: [mn] uh our federal government can 

243.24 247.13 B: appeal that to the federal supreme court 

247.26 251.32 B: or a national supreme court and they're not intending to do that 

251.37 262.53 B: um even though somebody took a you can call it a straw poll i guess because it's not statistically valid but uh just phone in to this newspaper this one newspaper is finding out that 

252.19 252.86 A: (( yep )) 

262.50 266.53 B: eighty percent of canadians uh really disagree with the decision 

267.01 272.74 B: and we're evangelical christians and one of the things that uh 

272.84 279.49 B: there there's a book in the bible called romans and the very first chapter describes the slide of a culture into decay 

279.58 282.11 B: uh it says although they knew god they 

282.20 283.17 B: uh 

283.11 297.34 B: didn't glorify him as god nor were they thankful and then it gives about seven steps and the very bottom step to hell or destruction of a society as well is uh and that they knowing the righteous condemnation 

292.54 293.59 A: (( [mn] right )) 

296.23 297.04 A: yeah 

297.29 303.96 B: against those who practice such things and one of those things is listed as homosexuality uh not only 

304.01 317.32 B: uh practice these things but condone others that do it and that's what we're doing now in both our countries if you're from california uh your supreme court just struck down i believe a texas law 

313.43 314.57 A: (( right )) 

317.85 318.61 B: uh 

318.69 333.28 B: and so in both our countries are at the highest level of our government and its governments that enforce morality not churches governments say hey killing people is wrong stealing is wrong running a red light is wrong um 

333.51 335.78 B: perverse acts are wrong 

335.91 337.37 B: and uh 

337.77 352.02 B: and the it's the government the church has doctrines and the government's supposed handle morality and and uh and enforce righteousness and uh at at the highest level of governments uh uh both our countries are saying hey that's okay you can do this 

342.01 342.72 A: (( well )) 

352.16 359.76 B: and uh the bible says woe unto you in your calm uh evil good um it usually is the 

360.11 361.74 B: a culture in decline 

361.81 365.71 B: uh and as far as i can tell both our cultures way in decline 

366.13 371.51 B: so i you know what i think is i'm i'm afraid uh we have a large family we have twelve children 

371.98 375.17 B: and um i'm i'm afraid uh for 

375.42 378.38 B: the world they're gonna grow up in they're gonna have to 

378.84 379.75 B: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

379.83 388.86 B: they're gonna have to make a stand uh in the same way that christians in communist countries had to make a stand uh before um 

384.83 387.60 A: mm right um 

387.99 389.17 A: well i 

389.03 390.70 B: uh those countries 

389.32 391.17 A: i personally feel um 

391.44 396.63 B: on themselves because of their own their stupidity and their denial of god's law 

391.50 392.50 A: that 

392.97 394.42 A: well i mean i 

394.61 395.18 A: (( [mn] )) 

395.51 398.88 A: i'm a christian as well but um are 

396.91 401.14 B: and now our country which both our countries especially yours which 

398.89 411.15 A: christians as well but yeah i feel that you know at the same time that you have to give everybody a free will and while everything that i mean while there are some things such as killing rape or 

401.41 404.77 B: stood against that uh is now making 

404.96 406.91 B: similar mistakes or worse 

408.87 413.62 B: uh so we're i i i don't you know i'm i'm a little nervous about what's going on 

411.19 417.94 A: incest something like that um that generally um we can all from different cultures and different religions um 

418.74 426.87 A: agree on i think that uh sexuality's very in general is a very sensitive issue and it 

424.35 425.21 B: mhm 

426.44 428.00 B: you're what is sorry 

427.51 443.48 A: (( um )) 

428.47 429.74 B: oh good to hear 

450.01 456.78 A: you know uh-huh but i just think that i think one of the things the supreme court said was that they can't um 

457.49 458.37 A: (( with )) 

457.85 461.14 B: actually well most cultures agree on whether you go to 

460.23 463.95 A: our constitution one of the things provided in the constitution 

461.62 469.83 B: uh christian or catholic uh all religions uh equally um condemn 

464.31 476.62 A: is that there's a right um for privacy and to make um your own decisions in private so they're not they're saying that they don't it's not necessarily saying that they condone that behavior but they're saying 

469.85 473.74 B: perverse sexuality this this isn't a religious freedom issue 

473.97 480.07 B: uh it's amazing how our governments are ignoring the consensus of religion 

476.81 480.49 A: um it's your own choice the government can't tell you 

480.20 482.28 B: against these perverse acts 

487.56 490.15 A: (( um )) 

489.52 490.71 B: [noise] 

490.32 501.66 A: well it's well it's just saying i i think i feel it's just wrong that you just have the uh ability you know to do that if you want the government's not gonna make you do it so i don't think the people are gonna go out 

501.66 505.45 A: you know flaunting that they're you know that they're homosexual 

513.56 518.76 B: okay but as soon as they legalize same sex marriages is it a private thing anymore 

521.00 525.09 B: now it's becoming publicly certified 

540.32 543.26 B: oh that's exactly what they're gonna do um 

543.57 547.03 B: in our cities in canada our 

547.63 553.15 B: one of our mayors refused to have a gay pride day now we'd hardly have a heterosexual pride day 

553.38 555.33 B: uh in any city i know about 

555.68 562.22 B: this mayor refused to participate in uh in a gay pride um 

562.35 575.23 B: march which pretty well all our cities have now and he was censored and in fact i think he i believe he was fined um the thing is his next election he got in with an overwhelming majority 

575.68 576.87 B: (( uh )) 

576.96 582.09 B: and why is because most of the people in his city are saying hey 

582.14 583.58 B: um don't 

584.46 589.46 B: they that's exactly what they're doing they are flaunting this saying hey don't push this on us 

589.54 599.89 B: and if they want same sex marriages they're uh they're it's coming way out of the closet here they're saying hey we want you to legitimize what we're doing
