0.00 1.64 B: hi my name's scott 

1.33 3.35 A: [lipsmack] hi my name's robert 

4.54 7.69 B: okay what do we do we just go from here or what [laughter] 

7.46 13.57 A: um i guess so uh uh um i want to make sure that i heard it correctly that was it feminist action 

12.97 14.77 B: no affirmative action 

14.13 15.77 A: affirmative action 

15.09 19.67 B: that's it they they want to know do you think it's a good hi- hiring policy 

16.62 20.55 A: yeah yeah yeah right 

21.28 26.72 A: uh we- yeah well i'm in favor of o- of affirmative action uh hiring 

26.50 28.48 B: okay for what reason 

30.43 35.07 A: [lipsmack] well uh i suppose i would align myself with the opinion 

35.39 38.02 A: expressed by sandra day o'connor 

37.99 38.99 B: okay 

38.83 42.64 A: uh that uh a society does depend on 

43.13 51.36 A: its uh ability to reflect the uh demographics of the country in its main institutions 

52.12 53.51 A: (( how how do you feel )) 

53.03 64.34 B: [mn] well huh see [mn] i i guess i can either way on it because i i do believe that there needs to be some equality and i guess uh what essentially o'connor's saying 

64.19 79.18 B: that you're right that it needs re- there has to be people coming up a- an ecology it creates a a better environment if you have you know blacks latinos whites all going through to school together as opposed to just you know one they had just had one demographic 

78.98 84.78 B: but [lipsmack] at the same time if i happened to be the more qualified person that didn't 

84.85 90.69 B: get picked i [laughter] you know i i i think that'd be highly unfair so 

90.75 97.46 B: it's easy to say you know you know it's better for the population but would you want i mean i guess the the big 

97.67 109.03 B: ticket is is that would you want the best possible doctor you could have at the time of surgery or you would you want the doctor that is not the most qualified 

109.75 111.86 B: just because they had to pick a number 

113.46 114.99 A: uh well [cough] 

116.82 120.65 A: i'm not sure that uh [mn] the matter of 

120.84 123.34 A: [cough] excuse me of um [lipsmack] 

123.56 127.43 A: refined skills is really the the central question 

127.91 129.10 A: (( uh )) 

129.22 137.80 B: because what was it that the the the sandra day o'connor case that you picked that was for law school in what in detroit or in uh michigan somewhere 

138.75 143.07 A: [sigh] uh it was for the yeah right the graduate law school at the university of michigan 

142.79 151.36 B: [noise] and it was for a girl who wasn't accepted at the time and she had you know better scores and because of the point system they used for that college 

150.74 159.44 A: well you see the the law school did not use a point system it was the undergraduate college that used the point system and and there was another 

155.56 156.43 B: okay 

159.62 163.82 A: court opinion which declared that unconstitutional 

164.24 165.21 A: um 

164.32 170.60 B: okay so so the- they declared the point system uncon- well that was a state law though that was the st- that was the state of michigan's 

165.24 167.02 A: (( yeah )) 

170.70 174.66 B: uh state supreme court that de- decreed that unconstitutional though 

175.05 176.97 B: it wasn't the okay 

175.10 180.18 A: oh no no no it was the u._s. supreme court issued two opinions on the same day 

179.18 180.09 B: okay 

180.33 183.14 A: and and uh both on university of michigan 

183.04 183.90 B: okay 

183.71 193.26 A: and the the undergraduate system which used this [mn] this rather strict point system was declared by a six to three vote to be unconstitutional 

192.72 193.62 B: okay 

193.86 204.62 A: and uh uh but the law school uh system in which they used more flexible criteria of of abilities and so forth 

196.60 200.47 B: (( mhm )) 

205.47 208.03 A: and and of race impact 

208.57 214.29 A: uh that was the op- op- opinion approved five to four and and written by sandra day o'connor 

214.23 215.10 B: okay 

215.96 220.24 A: [lipsmack] so i i am you know uh uh uh [mn] 

220.36 223.21 A: i am uh uh in agreement with th- 

223.42 224.76 A: the 

226.08 231.43 A: uh creative -ive -ive uh uh flexible kinds of um interpretations 

231.22 232.96 B: okay now 

231.97 232.98 A: because 

233.00 235.64 A: just to finish uh one point uh 

233.05 233.89 B: go ahead 

233.90 242.35 B: (( mhm )) 

236.38 241.96 A: the uh for the most part uh the michigan and i think other universities have found that 

242.38 247.46 A: that blacks who who were admitted and uh probably other minorities also 

247.61 254.22 A: who might have had um a a slightly lower uh g._p._a. or or whatever 

255.24 261.49 A: did manage in in the course of their cour- uh you know of their four years of study or whatever 

261.76 275.53 A: to uh come out to be at least be comparable to their fellow students uh who also were admitted so it it apparent- there's apparent there's an apparent gulf here between 

270.10 271.00 B: (( [noise] )) 

276.33 283.21 A: the uh ability to take tests or cu- for people coming from certain uh cultural or ethnic backgrounds 

282.96 292.47 B: okay bu- okay now now we're up to the graduate study though [noise] they had four years of college already before they got to the graduate study and 

289.88 291.35 A: right 

292.58 297.92 B: so you're saying that after the four years of college they improved their study habits 

297.96 303.59 B: by having that chance of going to med school or law school or whatever school they ended up going to 

304.38 306.87 A: [lipsmack] they they approved they improved vis 

307.01 310.55 A: a vis uh their standing class standings uh 

310.76 312.61 A: uh of their fellow classmates 

313.58 319.04 A: there there's been some kind of um national study i can't refer to it in in precise terms 

319.87 322.62 A: but those who who uh 

322.94 325.89 A: we- you know were selectively admitted 

324.32 327.47 B: (( mhm )) 

326.70 332.11 A: tended to improve their relative standing uh uh to their other classmates 

334.29 335.96 B: hm 

334.45 341.43 A: [lipsmack] so apparently you know they um um it's not just michigan but several uh colleges and universities have 

341.44 350.54 A: tried to incorporate that kind of admitting admission consideration and they seem to be tapping into something 

350.62 356.86 A: [mn] that is not reflected in in uh grade point average or you know or standardized tests 

358.37 364.90 A: [lipsmack] just from my own personal experience i mean i have two daughters um both are in college one is in graduate school 

364.46 366.26 B: mhm 

365.70 368.84 A: and both of them were poor test takers 

368.62 369.57 B: okay 

369.84 371.17 A: and uh 

371.20 375.31 A: if it were on- and you know and they're not a minority 

376.08 387.88 A: [lipsmack] uh they're s- standard caucasian [laughter] and uh if it were if just the the g._p._a.s uh would have been used or or but especially a._c._t. scores or s._a._t. scores 

378.71 379.65 B: okay 

387.67 389.45 B: right 

388.61 393.06 A: uh they would not have gotten into the uh colleges w- which they got into 

393.20 402.01 A: it was their other uh essays and and other considerations uh in uh other uh out of class activities 

402.24 404.41 A: that made them more competitive [noise] 

404.44 407.75 B: okay but competitive against whom 

407.72 421.68 B: i mean [mn] 'cause eventually you're drawing the line at who you're being competitive against you're being competitive against the person who does take the s._a._t.s well who does do the a._c._t.s well who did have a high g._p._a. in school i mean 

421.80 425.74 B: where do you cut that off because it basically what you're saying is that 

425.68 432.82 B: white males are the people that everything else is standardized against or asian males 'cause i guess the asians now have a 

432.75 441.16 B: uh [mn] they're not favored as high anymore in graduate admissions or even college admissions any more because they are predominantly there 

439.35 441.82 A: but don't they still don't they still have higher 

441.92 447.23 A: uh g._p._a. or or s._a._t. and uh uh scores than whi- uh caucasians 

447.03 460.14 B: yeah they do but and and and they're favored less now because they're say- we- at least that's what i heard out of u._c._l._a. because that um they were they were saying that that their their minority status is kinda wavering now because it's it's forty percent of the school 

461.57 470.51 B: so they're not you know are they are they really the minority anymore so they they've kinda removed that you know standard there but 

464.48 466.22 A: mhm 

470.66 482.58 B: i mean at one where do you draw the line i mean because asians they've gotten in for culturally wise i mean they they're they're they're driven from the very beginning their parents are very supportive of educa- education uh instead of you know going to ca- 

482.52 487.92 B: to basketball camp they send them to study camps they that's what they're really geared at you know 

488.65 490.51 B: raising their children like 

490.09 491.65 A: mhm 

490.72 491.82 B: so 

492.05 494.08 B: should they should they be 

494.21 498.38 B: rewarded for that or should they be you know well since 

498.83 512.99 B: the the african american parents didn't do that should they be re- rewarded for not doing that or is it just a cultural thing that we all we have to just accept a to and and move on with i you know [mn] someone's going to get burnt some way 

513.40 516.69 B: 'cause there's only so- you know so many spots in a school to go to 

516.82 523.13 B: and i do- i don't know if if i was the if i was the person being burnt i'd be very bitter about it 

523.70 534.00 A: [lipsmack] but the question is how many how many criteria enter into an assessment of not only uh of a student a pro- or a prospective student's ability 

534.15 534.96 A: (( you know )) 

534.93 536.52 B: right 

535.90 538.88 A: oh i thought we gotta quit [laughter] uh 

537.23 538.55 B: [laughter] 

538.94 541.81 A: of a prospective student's ability but also 

541.95 546.42 A: you know the contribution they can make to let's say a class uh 

546.43 550.72 A: in a particular discipline or to a university 

548.33 549.29 B: mhm 

551.35 561.15 A: uh uh i mean i don't would you be in fa- wo- i you know i'm white would you be in favor of uh a a university that had uniform uh white students 

551.37 552.40 B: (( [lipsmack] but i mean )) 

552.88 554.47 B: right 

561.58 573.97 B: uniformed white stu- oh like you mean a hundred percent white n- no i wouldn't be in fav- well not necessarily because i would be in favor probably of the people who had you know if there was a standard code that you had to hit 

564.12 565.83 A: yes or close to it 

574.03 583.36 B: i'd be in favor of whoever could hit that standard so i mean we all know right now that women are the pre- you know the predominant college students right now asians 

583.26 595.34 B: you know have like you said higher s._a._t.s higher scores [mn] i don't think it'd be a predominant white school anymore in the regards to the e- e- predominantly male white school i do- i don't think it would anymore 

595.83 599.62 B: i th- i think we're we've moved on to a time that
