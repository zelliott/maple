82.34 83.13 B: (( uh-hum )) 

84.64 85.84 B: right 

87.84 100.89 A: it's so bad for the student because i can you know i i would sit in class and i would just see the student just struggle [sigh] and the student o- obviously needed help academically and probably behaviorally [noise] too [sigh] but um 

99.25 100.35 B: right

104.92 112.70 A: they're not really getting any h- help [sigh] from the school and [sigh] i guess you have to put some of the blame on the parents too [sigh] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

111.82 120.21 B: well that's what i was just going to say to you [sigh] do you also feel that the parents are also responsible for the children's you know behavior and [sigh] you know academics [sigh] 

120.09 134.47 B: or do you think it's only the teachers but ah [sigh] you also agreed the parents [sigh] a- are also responsible y- you know in b- bringing up their children you know to be responsible and [sigh] making sure they do their homework and you know [sigh] f- follow instructions in class right [sigh] 

132.54 142.64 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] mm [noise] [sigh] most definitely most definitely i do think the parents [sigh] needs to take some of the blame too it's not all the s- it's not all the school you know

181.80 184.80 B: [sigh] m- mothers and fathers both work so a lot of times [sigh] 

184.61 199.06 B: there's no one home so they can cut school or miss classes and the parents don't even know [sigh] what happened with their children they think the children go to school in the morning then they leave to go to work you know what i'm saying [sigh] and [sigh] it probably is the same thing in pennsylvania where you're at you know what i'm saying [mn]

371.59 372.22 A: (( [noise] )) 

374.97 377.03 A: (( [noise] right [noise] mm )) 

378.57 392.99 B: um you have to do more than just send the kids to school you have to make sure [sigh] that they're ah ah [sigh] you know behaving in class and they're coming home and doing their homework and then going out to play and they're [sigh] you know respecting the teachers and d- doing the right thing but a lot of parents 

392.83 406.59 B: aren't aware what the kids are doing [sigh] 'cause they work or even if they don't work [sigh] they believe what the the children tell them so they think everything's all right you know and the kids aren't going to tell their parents [sigh] that they used the and ah bad language or 

405.74 407.06 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] no ))

412.70 426.23 B: um i don't have any homework [sigh] and the parents probably believe [sigh] the children so that's why unfortunately [sigh] you know it's not only the t- teachers that are responsible [sigh] the parents also have to take part of in children's [sigh] um you know ah 

426.45 435.04 B: [sigh] ah academics and know make sure that the kids are doing what they're supposed to do so they turn out to be [sigh] decent human beings [laughter] 

429.51 431.14 A: (( [noise] mm [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

433.96 441.71 A: [noise] [lipsmack] i think yeah i i agree with you the parent is responsible [sigh] the school is responsible but i think 

438.30 439.06 B: (( yeah )) 

439.63 441.02 B: of course yes 

442.05 445.93 A: [sigh] the person who's most responsible is the student [noise] 

445.55 447.52 B: oh yes of course you're right 

446.82 457.43 A: and ah the the the st- nowadays the the students [lipsmack] you know they ah most like half of the the ones i've met half of them 

456.17 457.36 B: (( uh-hum )) 

457.77 466.90 A: [lipsmack] don't see get they they don't they don't see themselves g- going to college they don't see themselves continuing school after high school [noise] [noise] [noise] uh-hum [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

464.89 465.70 B: no 

465.81 476.59 B: no you're absolutely right i know i hear them talking you're absolutely right [sigh] and i don't know what they t- think's going to happen to them [sigh] you know i'm saying sure if their parents have a lot of money [sigh] sure you don't want to go to school so you figure okay my parents [noise] 

476.41 490.89 B: um will give me money [noise] after school and y- you know i'll open up a business or i'll do whatever i want but a lot [noise] of these students don't realize their parents don't have a lot of money [sigh] and they have to make something of their lives and you know it's their like you saying and you said it 

490.68 504.43 B: that these children themselves [sigh] don't see what's going on and don't realize what they're getting into so they just keep d- doing whatever they want to do [sigh] and then they're the ones that are going to be responsible for themselves so y- you know when they turn eighteen years old 

504.14 512.82 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [lipsmack] what what do you think would be a [noise] consequence for a s- student like [lipsmack] [sigh] [noise] a- a- ah who's 

512.93 522.72 A: [sigh] just [noise] ah you know behaving himself in appropriately in class in you know just ah so [noise] you know they're just so impulsive [sigh] i mean what what do you do with a kid who [sigh] 

518.95 519.95 B: uh-hum 

522.60 534.92 A: who acts up in class and in school this is a situation i'm in i'm working with a kid who the kid's been suspended so many times that [lipsmack] the school's i- is s- sending him to an alternative school 

526.76 527.54 B: right 

529.22 529.93 B: right 

534.19 535.31 B: okay right 

534.73 538.92 A: but the waiting l- list for that school that alternative school's [noise] so long 

538.42 539.61 B: (( uh-hum )) 

539.03 543.06 A: [mn] the kid has no choice [noise] but to continue going to that school 

542.40 556.92 B: well the kid needs therapy there and that's another thing but you see [sigh] the schools can't force the parents to send the kid [sigh] to see a p- psychologist or um you know or a psy- or a psychiatrist [sigh] or you know g- 

555.05 556.67 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] right [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

556.75 566.83 B: go for therapy but apparently the a lot of these young um i'll call them kids but these young people do need um you know p- professional help 

563.42 564.23 A: (( [sigh] [noise] [sigh] )) 

565.47 568.43 A: (( [noise] [noise] oh a lot a lot [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [sigh] [noise] )) 

566.91 576.78 B: right right and unfortunately [sigh] it's not available in the public school system even in the catholic or [sigh] you know whatever k- kind of [sigh] religious school systems there are [sigh] 

576.72 590.28 B: you know what i'm saying they have guidance councilors [sigh] but they don't have [sigh] um you know psychologists or psychiatrists [sigh] that um the children can go see to d- discuss their problems or find out what's going on or find out [sigh] why they're doing things so 

589.18 591.07 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] right [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

590.09 599.90 B: that's something that [sigh] you know needs to be addressed also and you know parents [sigh] if they know their c- child is having [sigh] a lot of problems in school [sigh] um and there's a waiting list to get into
