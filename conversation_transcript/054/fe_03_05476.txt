131.48 133.22 B: yeah no kidding [noise] [noise] 

142.24 153.43 B: yeah i'm sure there's a huge population of muslims over here that are fe- that are feeling very uncomfortable you know like because their their actual the religion is calling to them to 

147.54 148.43 A: right 

152.43 161.00 A: [noise] and we should be uncomfortable 'cause they over here we done taught them all kinds of things you know what i'm saying if they wanted to go postal on us they could [noise] 

156.23 158.30 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

158.34 159.40 B: yeah 

161.80 167.94 B: yeah yeah well i mean i don't really agree with w- like what's the government's doing you know in general 

167.84 169.37 A: [noise] no me either 

168.02 171.11 B: so like i i sought of feel like if it's 

171.10 184.29 B: if it's if it's gonna come down to like you know there's pre emptive war kind of thing then if we do get attacked i mean although i'm gonna be very sympathetic to the victims and all that i mean at the same time i i we kind of have it coming 

183.64 185.76 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah because we shouldn't be 

186.46 192.56 A: [mn] all in other countries you know meddling and worrying about stuff if it don't affect us 

191.30 192.15 B: right 

192.85 204.56 B: right and it's like we're we're selecting countries like you know like iraq for example like mean they they don't even have nuclear weapons there's other country there's other countries in the world that have nuclear weapons 

203.91 206.27 A: yeah they will on us [laughter] 

204.67 211.35 B: you know that that are i mean in my opinion like whether you know like i i think like a country like israel 

211.24 224.22 B: you know like the fact that we're supporting [noise] palestine and all that like that's that's much more of a of like a real threat to me i mean there's not even a real threat like like like it's all pre emptive war is a step away from globalisation you know 

217.19 217.75 A: (( [noise] )) 

224.17 224.82 A: (( mhm )) 

224.22 227.04 B: i think so it's like i don't know 

227.16 231.24 B: it's definitely uh it's a tough situation and the media's just feeding everybo- 

229.57 232.16 A: (( right )) 

231.63 236.94 B: as as long as they can convince the general public that they have something to fear 

237.15 241.72 B: you know and they're like security is at stake then the government can pretty much do anything they want you 

239.19 240.15 A: mhm 

241.59 247.46 A: yeah i feel that's how this this while we're worrying about one thing they're doing something else 

242.18 243.61 B: know and so 

247.48 249.20 B: yeah 

248.07 252.98 A: you know it's to kind of take your mind away from the the main thing 

252.64 265.94 B: yeah like when president clinton was getting that whole mon- monica lewinsky coverage in all that we were bombing bosnia you know and that was like and that was like in the middle pages of the newspaper on the front page is a picture of monica lewinsky you know 

256.85 257.99 A: mhm 

259.09 261.40 A: right exactly 

265.07 269.12 A: [noise] right like we care about w- what she's doing you know what i'm saying 

268.50 269.96 B: yeah right 

269.27 271.37 A: (( i can care less who sucks his dick )) 

271.42 280.03 B: and like the fact the rest of the world was like kind of laughing at us when all that was going on because yeah like they have all those problems too you know like men are just men 

280.10 283.01 B: you know like they they do those things and uh 

283.17 291.29 B: and but like o- over in other countries they don't you know like the media doesn't care like like none of the citizens care you know as as long as 

289.72 292.76 A: (( [noise] no because as long as they're running the country )) 

292.12 296.44 B: right as long as they're doing their job man you know then it doesn't matter what they're doing in the bedroom you know 

296.85 302.58 B: so i i don't know i think i think the country really freak out everybody would get really scared 

302.35 311.69 A: yeah yeah they would go a bit wild they would buy guns and nail their windows up and make bunkers out of their homes and you know it would be crazy 

302.93 304.17 B: yeah 

305.69 306.88 B: yeah 

309.42 310.64 B: [laughter] 

311.31 316.67 B: especially like a lot of people with money [noise] it would be like titanium bomb shelters and yeah and then 

313.65 317.92 A: yeah they'd buy up all the food and everything you won't you won't be able to buy anything to eat 

317.82 329.07 B: yeah i mean if the if if it really came down to a serious threat i think the majority of the population wouldn't be able to do anything anyway [noise] because there's so many people with money that would just like [mn] that would just act immediately you know 

326.84 327.99 A: right 

328.24 332.19 A: everything else would freeze you're right 

329.81 338.91 B: yeah so everybody else would be fucked you know [laughter] and to me that's not that's not patriotism that's not nationalism you know that's like that's greed you know 

332.48 333.87 A: you're right 

336.24 337.50 A: (( i know )) 

339.07 345.16 A: [noise] so i don't know what i'd do i know i'd stay in my house like i do most of the time anyway 

344.95 346.63 B: yeah right [laughter] 

345.29 348.97 A: [noise] because i won't be having to worry about no terrorists 

348.65 350.53 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

349.24 355.98 A: [noise] [noise] in the event that they come over here [noise] i'll just lock my door [noise] yeah i'll buy me [noise] some food and be 

356.24 358.80 A: (( [noise] in the house [mn] [noise] [noise] w- )) 

357.62 358.54 B: yeah 

359.73 361.66 B: i'd probably be doing the same thing man 

362.12 363.24 A: what did you say 

362.27 363.18 B: (( i mean )) 

363.25 369.22 B: when it comes down to something like that it's just it's basically about looking after yourself you know 

368.34 370.85 A: basically that's what we have to do anyway 

370.70 384.45 B: yeah right i i i think our government's like set up you know [noise] like the wealth is distributed in the world and you know i mean basically if there's lower and middle classes that are working to jay two day jobs you know like to to just make it 

382.54 384.83 A: right right just to survive 

384.49 390.77 B: just to survive and the tax breaks that we're not getting are supporting the tax breaks that the rich are getting 

390.83 397.43 B: and that the corporations are getting and so like that elite sort of population on top of everything [noise] is basically what's 

397.29 406.61 B: is basically just you know like our government is now acting like a corporation where they like basically pay the people on the bottom nothing so and the people on the top just make all the money you know 

403.01 405.45 A: (( [noise] [noise] they not trying to help us )) 

406.28 408.19 A: you're right 

407.13 417.40 B: and that's what that's like what the government's doing and so um so of course they're gonna be all about you know like taking out corporate taxes and everything 'cause that's the same way they work you know 

409.78 411.67 A: [noise] you're right 

417.53 420.73 B: i [noise] i definitely think we need a new president in the next year 

420.62 422.52 A: (( we need to do something man [laughter] )) 

422.19 424.08 B: (( [noise] yeah [laughter] )) 

423.78 429.97 A: i'd say that if if we get under attack by terrorists man that that means it's time for us to die 

429.89 442.40 A: if they got all the way over here [laughter] you know inside the united states being able to do this this time it's time you know they got no business getting all the way over here to the point where we're under attack 

431.91 433.28 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

437.32 438.76 B: (( [noise] [noise] yep )) 

441.75 443.49 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

442.51 444.99 A: i mean inside the states come on 

445.09 453.90 B: you know i saw uh i saw a picture of an american flag that instead of the stars [noise] on the flag it had a bunch of little [noise] corporate logos 

453.69 454.86 A: for real 

453.92 457.73 B: like macdonalds and it had like microsoft and it had like you know 

456.86 458.47 A: (( oh get out of here )) 

457.80 469.07 B: a._w._o._l. time warner and all that shit and and you know and it's like that's that's fucking i think i think that's really how it is man yeah and you know i was thinking like it'd be a really good shirt [noise] 

459.71 461.50 A: (( get out of here )) 

462.69 464.91 A: that's really how it is right 

469.10 476.91 B: if you had uh [noise] like o- on the back side you had that kind of [noise] flag you know with like a a line you know a circle with a line through it 

476.67 477.78 A: mhm 

477.18 479.51 B: and then on the front you have like the real flag 

479.82 484.98 B: [noise] you know it's like i'm i'm it's like i believe in the real ideas of america not the corporate bullshit that's going on 

484.45 486.10 A: right right 

485.23 492.15 B: you know freedom for all people like you know [noise] and uh equality and like globalisation and all that but uh 

490.38 500.29 A: [noise] yeah 'cause it definitely has changed 'cause we're too much we're too involved in other people's affairs [noise] you know 'cause i'm like whatever happened to bin laden 

493.27 494.31 B: yeah 

498.44 499.42 B: (( [noise] )) 

500.38 502.32 B: (( [mn] [noise] yeah exactly )) 

501.15 507.61 A: do you know that was supposed to be the major thing and [noise] at the same time we were over there making a war [noise] [noise] 

502.87 503.54 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

506.64 520.91 B: right and then at first our attention turned to iraq because they thought that it was based with evidence from the al qaeda like that the taliban was connected to iraq and then as it went on the evid- like the the like reason for going over there kept changing 

515.78 517.57 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

520.95 526.27 B: you know then it was oh no now they're not connected with the taliban now we're going over there to free the people 

525.91 529.13 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah now yeah they had nuclear weapons )) 

526.30 527.63 B: (( you know what i mean [noise] )) 

528.53 536.36 B: yeah yeah then it was mass destruction and then it was the liberation of the people you know and it's like the reason kept changing because nobody was buying anything and [noise] [noise] 

531.83 533.06 A: right 

534.87 540.99 A: because they didn't have a reason it was because the president feel like he wanted to do something crazy 

537.02 540.11 B: (( right )) 

540.74 545.19 B: [noise] [noise] you know and i mean the only thing that makes sense to me is that it was oil 

541.07 542.21 A: [noise] 

545.33 546.66 A: [noise] 

545.86 550.69 B: you know like it's gotta be the oil over there that they're after that's the only reason they would've picked 

547.94 551.96 A: yeah yeah 'cause that's the only thing is as a resource 

551.92 565.48 B: yeah that's the only thing they would've picked you know as opposed to like making the country with solar cars and you know running off of like natural power that won't run out and won't hurt the environment we can't do it because the oi- the oil industry's too strong 

561.00 562.87 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

565.38 571.88 B: they have too much money and if we were to like pass those laws they would like thousands and thousands of people would be out of a job you know 

569.80 571.44 A: [noise] 

571.57 572.89 A: (( [noise] [noise] right [noise] )) 

572.13 574.52 B: and so that's why it's not happening you know 

575.24 577.27 A: i don't know i don't know 

575.31 581.36 B: so i yeah it's i think it's definitely messed up i think people would freak out if we got a terrorist attack 

581.51 591.81 A: [noise] they don't have no choice [laughter] you don't have no choice i mean we don't have no tanks in the back yard to pull around to the front you know drive up on the lawn [noise] 

583.70 586.86 B: [noise] yeah right [laughter] [cough] 

591.14 599.89 B: yeah you know and and especially after everything that united states has done to other countries i don't think [noise] if if anybody [noise] can attack like 

592.09 593.76 A: (( so what could we do [noise] ))
