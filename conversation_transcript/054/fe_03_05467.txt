0.62 4.00 B: good afternoon i'm chuck gillis how are you 

3.52 6.81 A: how you doing my name's uh michael johnson how you doing chuck 

6.30 8.04 B: okay michael 

8.24 10.96 B: uh i don't know did you ever smoke 

10.44 17.51 A: no i've never smoked before um so i i it's something that i'm probably uh i'm probably a biased opinion here so 

16.82 22.26 B: [laughter] well i smoked i never smoked at all for about uh 

22.45 35.27 B: twenty three years then uh i get out of college started to work and then uh as i was working other people that i travelled with i did a fair amount of travel they seemed to smoke 

35.30 47.86 B: so first thing you know uh you try one cigarette you try another one and after so many months um it seems like you're hooked on it and you start smoking [laughter] 

47.22 49.90 A: right so are you still smoking currently now or 

49.29 50.39 B: (( no )) 

50.24 57.22 B: uh i was never a um committed smoker you might say i smoked maybe for [sigh] 

57.05 71.56 B: four or five years just uh but um i guess i never truly got hooked 'cause i i couldn't smoke in the morning i would smoke after i got to work in the morning but not early morning as soon as you get up 

58.29 59.42 A: oh okay 

68.76 69.56 A: right 

70.86 71.64 A: (( righto )) 

72.29 78.92 A: so how do you feel about you know they they ban the smoke now i guess you have a little sympathy for both ways i guess 

78.66 89.29 B: uh in a way i do uh [sigh] i'll tell you they for example they banned smoking uh where i live in ocean city on the you can't smoke on the boardwalk 

89.74 102.67 B: [mn] presumably it was for uh safety reasons but it seems a little ridiculous they have little squared off areas where they do permit people to smoke and it just seems to me 

100.37 101.12 A: mm 

102.55 109.56 B: um it doesn't make a lot of sense uh most people who smoke don't go there [laughter] 

108.81 109.97 A: right 

110.24 111.08 B: so 

112.07 125.76 A: yeah i i i can see it both ways i just i um i don't i don't wanna go you know seclude the smokers and keep them out of everything and so they can't enjoy their lives you know they chose to smoke that's 

125.56 136.55 A: that's on them man you can see like and second hand smoke is on the increase so i mean it it goes both ways but i i for one don't like to have smoke around my food when i'm eating so 

135.97 146.40 B: well when you go into a restaurant usually uh um or at least when they could smoke uh you usually asked uh if you could sit in the non smoking section 

146.05 155.80 A: right but still even though 'cause they would be right next door to each other or right across the room and uh to to i mean you still get the smoke that carried over 

155.65 156.92 B: that's true 

156.57 166.22 A: so um i i'm i'm for one i i'm am in florida and they just july first they just passed a no smoking in in um restaurants not even including bars so 

165.85 167.16 B: right 

166.49 176.96 A: so that's one thing i'm i'm positive about you know but i i can understand the smokers they want to eat and they wanna light up a cigarette after they eat they i guess they should have the right to do so but you know 

176.67 190.93 B: well the the one that d- disturbs me a little bit is is for the small uh shop owner or uh restaurant where historically people have gone there to eat and smoke 

190.88 194.64 B: and it's very difficult for them all of a sudden to say 

194.84 209.78 B: i can't segregate and yet uh it doesn't seem right that they have to totally ban smoking it seems to me you know if you go in there you're going to smell smoke and if you don't wanna smell smoke don't go in there 

201.52 202.56 A: yeah 

209.18 218.82 A: yeah and i i totally agree with you there especially like like a waffle house or house like that something very small you know you know you gonna if you going in there you gonna get some type of smoke 

218.61 226.94 A: but you just like you said you you made a conscious decision to say hey i can stand this 'cause i like to go here and now like you said 

225.70 226.49 B: (( mm )) 

227.32 232.98 A: even for like those small joints that hey that might be the majority of their customers so 

232.31 234.03 B: that that is true 

233.43 234.38 A: so 

234.53 236.76 A: so you really putting them on the [mn] 

236.34 250.55 B: yeah well the the one place i really think it was a good idea that they stopped was on the uh airlines when they stopped smoking uh having people smoke on the airlines i thought that was great and that was a number of years ago 

243.59 244.57 A: and oh yeah 

250.14 256.40 A: right i totally agree with you there 'cause i remember one time that stuck i was in the rear of the of the airplane and um 

256.70 258.88 A: i just couldn't breathe [laughter] 

258.26 259.48 B: (( yeah that's )) 

259.08 265.70 A: it was that bad 'cause they tried to desegregate it but uh it just it was just it was not good enough 

260.21 261.20 B: yeah 

265.78 266.49 A: just 

265.83 273.60 B: well the the strangest thing many years ago i was on an airplane we were happened to be over in europe flying 

273.52 282.87 B: and i think it was an italian airline as i recall that the strange setup they had you could smoke on one side but not the other side 

282.61 283.80 A: [laughter] 

283.02 296.05 B: you know what i mean they might as well have just forgotten that i mean it was bad enough when no smoking in the front you could smoke in the back uh even then you still had uh you still had the influx of the smoke coming 

285.52 286.34 A: [laughter] 

289.88 291.08 A: right 

295.71 307.97 A: definitely you certainly definitely did but um i i and i guess they're g- i guess they're gonna but next thing is where you draw the line at i guess i that and that's probably gonna be the next question coming 

304.40 305.76 B: yeah 

307.99 315.67 A: you know i and i don't know where would you because now you now you got the the smoker thinking like he's a a criminal or something [laughter] you know 

315.55 316.62 B: yeah 

315.90 325.99 A: and he just even though he cigarette ads are now even telling you they're addictive and you know the person chose to smoke they have that right you know 

325.91 338.60 B: uh yes i and i tell you i'm not totally convinced uh about the second hand smoke um i guess i do believe it's not good for you but i'm not totally convinced that 

338.68 347.26 B: that causes the the cancer that they seem to have been pushing that that's what causes cancer 

347.60 359.03 B: i don't know it just seems to me i've been around people that smoked or been with people smoked a long time and it doesn't necessarily follow that you end up with lung cancer 

358.82 366.76 A: [lipsmack] a- and you know that's true 'cause yeah people that smoke ninety years live ninety years and never have any problems i mean i i 

365.18 366.41 B: yeah 

366.95 367.89 A: you know 

367.92 375.12 A: i just think that like they like you just said i don't think there's really no definite proof that um 

375.75 380.59 A: even second hand smoke can you know lead to i guess it's called emphysema or whatever it's called 

379.70 381.72 B: right emphysema right mm 

381.04 382.51 A: yeah and um 

382.67 390.32 A: but all i can show that the damage that it does that it does to the lungs i guess they can show that and i and but all the time you know 

390.60 397.73 A: i mean who knows you know eating and a lot of things that you do throughout your lifetime will cause damage to your lungs you know 

397.66 400.65 B: [noise] mm does anyone in your family ever smoke 

400.40 407.49 A: no i've never had anyone in my family smoke i've had some people smoke something illegal [laughter] 

405.13 406.11 B: (( [laughter] )) 

406.86 410.94 B: but regular uh cigarettes or cigars or a pipe 

408.82 409.91 A: but um 

410.53 422.77 A: no i've never had anyone that smoked cigars or pipes either i got i have a very small family and nah i've never been and i've had my mom she's dated a couple of boyfriends that smoked 

415.90 417.77 B: mhm 

422.13 423.28 B: mhm 

422.69 425.95 A: and then that that bothered me a lot you know 

425.62 426.67 B: yes 

426.08 427.20 A: 'cause um 

427.35 437.00 A: you just don't wanna i and i hate going into a house that you can just smell smoke and you could smell smoke on people's breath you know it just 'cause i'm in the navy and 

437.07 442.04 A: as you smoking and navy pretty much goes symo- you know synonymous you know so 

441.49 443.16 B: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

442.68 447.50 A: but uh actually actually they're cutting down in the navy but you know they uh 

445.74 451.07 B: [laughter] well i have a i have a daughter and uh son in law 

451.02 461.90 B: both of 'em put twenty years of service in in the navy and they both smoked while they were in the navy and they believe it or not they still smoke 

461.25 463.74 A: [laughter] yeah 

462.66 468.75 B: and one works in the pharmacy and the other works in the area of uh xray 

468.46 469.41 A: uh-huh 

469.38 476.27 B: and uh you would think that they both would say that's stupid you shouldn't be doing that any more 

476.18 481.09 A: you are you're absolutely right on my shift i'm on we have what we call a hospital corpsman 

481.18 492.50 A: all three we have three of 'em on board and all three of 'em smoke you know [laughter] you would think that they would be the guy that pushes you know the health you know healthiness and say hey that's not what you wanna do but they 

490.06 496.28 B: r- right you you certainly would think so because they see what happens 

493.56 494.55 A: (( [laughter] right mm )) 

496.67 510.31 B: uh but they uh somehow people i guess it's true people become addicted and they can't stop i i know that's the case with my daughter and and son in law i know that they have tried to stop 

510.23 516.29 B: and they can't they've done it for so many years that they just can't stop smoking 

516.24 520.03 A: yeah i had a friend and uh he's a principal now and um 

520.43 525.77 A: he was like he was like he he started working he was working a part time job while he was teaching and um 

526.00 539.31 A: got around with people that smoked in the afternoon and he like you say he's pretty much picked up the habit from there and he just could not stop and he's tried everything and and he's a healthy guy like loves to work out and stay in shape and but 

539.33 546.24 A: there's something he he doesn't smoke in the house when he's at home but you know every time he leaves the house you know you know what he's gonna go do so 

545.55 553.84 B: yeah yeah [laughter] he has to go out sm- outside or in the garage to smoke huh yeah i guess there are situations uh like that 

546.78 547.85 A: [laughter] 

549.72 551.06 A: (( right so mm right )) 

553.86 554.97 B: so uh 

554.98 568.25 B: but uh well i know in in my family my my father smoked my mother never smoked and now my wife has never smoked i don't think she's ever s- tried one cigarette 

568.38 577.68 B: and uh which is fine and uh i have five children and i think at one time um two or three of 'em smoked but now 

577.72 585.65 B: we just have the one left and the one uh one left smoking and i just can't believe that she still smokes [laughter] 

586.42 598.11 A: yeah i mean with all the the negative publicity that smoking is getting you would think that they would be in danger of you know but i ge- like you said if if it's if it's addictive it's addictive uh 

598.75 599.89 B: yeah and it's
