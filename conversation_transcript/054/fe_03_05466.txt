58.62 68.23 A: [mn] yeah it actually went into effect two days ago but i know a few places that still allow it you know it just it depends if they're like chains or whatever like danny's or whatnot they stopped uh 

68.65 78.43 A: the smoking section and all that i mean i don't care i mean i know that it bothers non smokers for smokers to be sitting at the next table and i don't mind you know i don't mind not smoking while other people are eating

88.44 95.89 B: i'm curious as to why i mean it really does it does bother me when people smoke in restaurants 'cause i think you know it's sort of a strange um 

96.87 106.78 B: that it's a it's just a weird thing to a non smoker interesting as to why anyone would smoke after eating because it's such a seems like such a weird taste to put into your mouth after eating you know

129.39 130.45 A: it's a 

130.44 132.50 B: it's a sort of a it seems 

132.85 137.33 B: it would you'd think it would i think it would fire you up more than it would relax you it's weird oh 

132.94 133.75 A: (( what's )) 

137.18 141.54 A: that yeah it depends on the situation it could be a stimulant or a depressant you know
