23.15 36.50 B: [cough] a million dollars cannot buy friendship so the thing is is that i would have to say no to the money [noise] because [cough] friendship is that thing that you'll always have and a million dollars is something you won't have all the time 

38.41 40.78 A: okay w- what's the question 

41.35 51.33 B: what would you do if you had a million dollars if you the only thing is is that um [cough] you'd have to say goodbye to your best friend and never talk to your best friend again 

51.36 56.68 A: [sigh] well i'd probably do that because i could probably arrange to send him some money 

56.45 62.72 B: but you'd have n- the thing is is that you would have no contact or anything with him you can never talk to him [noise] again 

62.86 65.43 B: or have any contact with him 

62.86 64.16 A: yeah mhm 

64.83 65.81 A: right 

66.45 67.14 B: (( [cough] )) 

67.57 69.26 A: i'd probably take the money 

67.61 68.75 B: and so you 

69.07 70.57 B: you'd take the money 

69.68 71.07 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

71.28 74.27 B: yeah why is that 

73.94 81.48 A: well because i'm getting on in years and neither one uh neither one of us have much time left and so may as well uh 

79.28 81.10 B: mhm 

82.66 84.07 A: get the money 

83.85 86.51 B: right what would you do with the money 

87.44 88.50 A: well 

88.76 92.61 A: what would i do with the money pay off debts get the 

92.88 94.19 A: things in order 

94.25 95.39 B: mhm 

94.82 100.81 A: and probably send some surreptitiously to him n- not having the contact with him [noise] but 

98.61 99.54 B: right 

100.35 103.51 B: right through another source 

103.11 104.19 A: right 

103.81 108.33 B: give the source that money and say d._o. whatever you would like to do with it 

105.78 106.73 A: mhm 

107.60 108.57 A: right 

108.55 110.82 B: [cough] right i i 

109.77 112.82 A: and the rest of it i would use for travel probably 

112.51 121.80 B: mhm mhm right [cough] you know like i said it would be very hard for [noise] me to say goodbye to my friend so 

121.83 126.51 B: i i don't think i could do it you know a million dollars i i know is a lot of money 

123.86 125.40 A: (( okay [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

126.86 137.45 B: but but because i'm still young and my friend is still young [lipsmack] i- it'd be it'd be really difficult to to say goodbye to a million dollars 

137.85 142.85 A: [noise] yeah but uh being young you'd have more to give up in giving up your friend 

142.33 144.59 B: mhm mhm 

145.38 146.50 B: (( mm so ))

170.12 172.20 B: [laughter] 

173.07 177.29 A: i think we're supposed to talk for ten minutes or something like that but the 

176.36 177.33 B: (( [noise] )) 

177.45 179.49 A: the woman on the phone uh 

179.73 182.38 A: i don't know if it's a recording or what but uh 

182.68 186.40 A: she's not very clear or i'm hard of hearing or something 

185.86 193.52 B: y- i i couldn't understand her either that [noise] well but what she said is that we had to talk about the million dollars and what would we do

194.49 195.40 A: (( mhm ok- ))

197.55 198.76 A: mhm 

201.59 209.95 A: mhm seems like a pretty [noise] silly hypothetical question i don't thi- see that many people running around throwing a million dollars this way and that

223.06 226.00 A: take the million dollars what would you do with it 

225.58 237.31 B: if i took the million dollars i'm getting married in a week so i'd i'd be like telling my wife that uh the person i'm getting married to is that [noise] we're gonna be going and uh we're having a huge wedding
