1.95 7.17 B: [noise] good evening jim this is michael i didn't hear the tone [laughter] 

5.25 8.28 A: (( [sigh] well it was a very light tone [laughter] )) 

7.23 11.19 B: i probably can't hear it o- over the fans here 

9.84 13.74 A: [laughter] i see a- are you in san francisco where it's boiling or 

13.65 19.50 B: i am [noise] i'm actually in b- boston where it is quite warm [sigh] [sigh] 

17.67 26.36 A: [sigh] a- ah okay i- it's a d- different coast but same heat [lipsmack] [sigh] yeah about the schools [sigh] um it seems to me that ah one thing people ah 

26.17 37.95 A: the people aren't ah m- making sure the kids stay in school there's no truant officers any more [sigh] and often parents aren't a- aware that their children are not s- a- ah going to school 

35.22 35.81 B: (( [sigh] )) 

38.38 40.66 A: [sigh] ah also they don't seem to be ah 

38.72 40.23 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] )) 

41.25 43.93 A: giving them enough pressure there are not enough ah 

44.92 48.71 A: [sigh] challenge [sigh] f- for ah many of the kids [sigh] 

49.16 63.92 B: what i [noise] they're i i i i'm sorry i forgot which part of the count- i didn't hear which part of the country you were in [sigh] oh the other end of the country [sigh] [sigh] here in in in boston they've [sigh] instituted this new challenge at least in the high schools 

55.10 56.67 A: oh san francisco 

57.76 59.16 A: right [laughter] 

63.58 64.43 A: o- 

63.89 70.18 B: [sigh] the um [sigh] you have to p- pass this test called the m._c._a._t.s in order to graduate 

69.81 71.45 A: (( oh o- oh uh-huh )) 

70.27 73.72 B: [mn] a- and this was the first year that um [sigh] 

73.57 81.12 B: that it was a requirement i i think the the idea is this is a way to measure [sigh] 

76.27 77.31 A: uh-huh 

81.11 92.27 B: how the students are doing in school and make sure that [sigh] that students aren't [sigh] aren't being a- allowed to just coast through school and and get out without a [sigh] a base level of education 

92.37 100.77 B: [sigh] and [noise] t- there has been lots of controversy over this test [sigh] um some people say you know if you're not good at taking tests 

100.67 111.10 B: this isn't a fair [sigh] a fair way to do it [sigh] or if you just aren't smart enough to be able to take this test [sigh] that doesn't mean you shouldn't graduate from high school 

111.71 117.70 A: [mn] [noise] [laughter] we had s- some years ago um a kid sued t- the city school system because ah [sigh] 

117.87 125.02 A: he c- couldn't read and write although t- they graduated him and [sigh] he lost his he lost his suit but ah 

122.06 122.62 B: (( [sigh] )) 

123.96 127.23 B: (( yeah )) 

125.29 128.30 A: sounds like som- you're advocating b- [laughter] back there 

127.72 130.72 B: [sigh] [laughter] [sigh] oh it's 

128.86 129.99 A: [sigh] i 

130.13 135.97 A: we've had a- also the same t- thing a- ah a test that you're supposed to take to graduate but um 

136.02 141.58 A: [sigh] and we've had lots of c- controversy i think they backed off of it n- now i guess we're not going to be doing it 

139.64 140.24 B: (( [sigh] )) 

142.44 143.60 B: a- ah 

143.68 147.49 B: [sigh] no they [sigh] they're doing it here i don't think that that's 

147.63 155.51 B: [sigh] i i don't think that that's a a good solution it it's it's trying to address the problem but [sigh] um 

155.45 168.37 B: being able to pass a test is not the same thing as being [sigh] able to [laughter] learn how to [sigh] how to read and and how to do basic math and [sigh] and how to function in society 

168.10 169.57 A: (( [sigh] oh uh-hum [noise] )) 

168.14 179.11 B: all that being said [sigh] it's a wonderful thing that we have this this public school system in this country where everybody [sigh] is not only 

178.91 189.94 B: allowed [noise] but is you know theoretically required to [sigh] to go to school we ah [sigh] our literacy is [laughter] much higher than places that don't have public education 

190.27 197.19 A: [sigh] well yes it is go- good that we have public education [noise] but i think there should also be [sigh] free to ah 

197.37 207.64 A: go to any p- private school they want to [mn] ah with some sort of [sigh] state aid maybe not ah ah as much as it costs i mean say it costs five thousand a year to go 

207.88 215.12 A: [sigh] ah for public school education well then g- give 'em two thousand five hundred to g- go to private school make sure that they ah [sigh] 

215.37 217.83 A: s- still ah meet their requirements 

217.86 222.68 A: ah through the private [noise] school and you'd also save money you can spend elsewhere [noise] ah 

218.79 219.40 B: (( [sigh] )) 

223.03 224.52 A: [sigh] in the public school 

223.27 237.06 B: [sigh] [sigh] that that could work if a private school would be [sigh] ah th- the argument [laughter] against that of course [sigh] um to play devil's advocate private schools get to choose w- who they admit [sigh] 

237.24 248.66 A: [sigh] yeah but then y- if you don't give them the full amount of the cost ah you'd have that m- money left over to put it apply back to the public schools for [sigh] people who are [noise] on the lower end 

246.17 251.02 B: (( [noise] [sigh] [sigh] mm r- right )) 

249.78 260.67 A: [mn] [sigh] i do think the s- the public ah the ah teachers' union rather has a lot to do with this they're afraid of ah public schools like to keep them out of business as much as possible 

256.01 256.96 B: (( [sigh] )) 

260.36 267.58 B: [noise] oh they they are and we [sigh] we could talk about [laughter] if we're talking about teachers' unions [sigh] you start talking about [sigh] 

267.47 280.22 B: the um the teachers themselves and the the tenure process of once [sigh] once you have taught for a certain amount of time the difficulty [sigh] in removing less than adequate teachers 

271.41 272.47 A: (( uh-hum )) 

280.45 283.84 A: [sigh] yeah ah we h- have that too 

283.91 293.53 A: [sigh] ah here we have the ah prostitutes' union ah they were trying to unionize they haven't yet dealt with the question of seniority [mn] [laughter] 

287.56 288.34 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] )) 

290.47 294.90 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

294.18 297.29 A: but we'll h- have to wait to see how that works out [sigh] 

296.98 300.15 B: [noise] oh wow [laughter] 

298.71 299.86 A: (( [laughter] )) 

300.24 308.34 A: um [mn] we spend i think we're about the forty ninth or forty eighth ah in the amount of p- per pupil money we spend 

308.04 312.15 B: as as in highest or lowest [sigh] really 

310.03 315.32 A: [sigh] ah lowest [laughter] right [sigh] we used to have a good school system [sigh] 

314.96 316.29 B: oh wow [sigh] 

315.75 318.02 A: but that sort of went south [sigh] 

318.25 321.47 B: [noise] [noise] right so you're you're right down there with mississippi 

320.99 322.97 A: (( [noise] y- yep [sigh] [noise] uh-hum [noise] )) 

321.81 332.91 B: or alabama or whatever [sigh] the [sigh] i i'm i'm s- surprised [sigh] wow so who's [laughter] 

323.72 324.70 A: (( mm )) 

330.61 334.41 A: well i don't think the public trust the ah school system out here 

334.83 336.23 A: [mn] um 

335.21 349.50 B: and and so it just doesn't g- get the funding that you need to have [sigh] adequate education that's i mean it all a l- lot of it comes down to [sigh] where people are willing to have their tax dollars go [sigh] 

349.08 354.03 A: [sigh] [sigh] well for instance we um we voted a big bond issue to rebuild the school 

352.98 353.62 B: (( [sigh] )) 

354.50 366.91 A: a- a- ah the money ah was the bonds were sold [sigh] and the money sort of disappeared the school was still not built it hasn't even been begun yet [laughter] [sigh] but the money's no longer there 

358.66 360.45 B: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

362.25 363.86 B: oh my [noise] 

363.87 364.81 B: (( [sigh] )) 

367.69 370.55 A: [sigh] their lousy accounting system [sigh] 

367.71 368.92 B: that's 

370.36 373.65 B: oh that that is [sigh] that's despicable [noise] 

373.37 378.53 A: they must have all been graduates of san francisco public schools [laughter] 

376.98 382.94 B: [laughter] yeah either that or they um they studied a- accounting at enron [sigh] 

382.04 392.31 A: ah one of those yeah [laughter] [sigh] but we've um we've got problems s- you know w- i f we voted the money they'll probably misspend it [sigh] and ah 

391.58 395.04 B: [sigh] just not on the right things 

392.39 393.38 A: so 

394.48 395.67 A: right [sigh] 

395.31 407.09 B: [sigh] there was [sigh] i'm u- um [mn] i saw an i- issue i mean this is just a a t._v. show boston public the um the last episode of the season [sigh] they had a h- huge cut 

402.19 402.94 A: (( uh-hum )) 

406.88 419.69 B: in the in the show in in the school and they were saying they were going to have to give the teachers [sigh] and the solution that they came up with was not f- firing any of the teachers keeping all their teachers [sigh] but c- cutting all funding for s- sports 

420.29 421.60 A: (( uh-hum )) 

421.15 423.90 B: and then to get b- because 

423.89 437.58 B: since the community wouldn't [sigh] um come up with money to [sigh] to go and and fund more teachers [sigh] they figured they could get the community to come up with money to fund sports because people [sigh] seem to be more passionate about having a football team at their school [sigh] 

437.50 440.96 B: than about having [sigh] enough math teachers 

437.89 439.11 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] [laughter] )) 

440.77 443.82 A: [sigh] yep i can well see that [sigh] 

442.01 442.58 B: (( [sigh] )) 

444.77 450.87 A: um back in ohio some years ago we had you had to vote to increase funding for the schools 

451.34 463.48 A: [sigh] and um i think it was on so many m- mils per dollar of the um assessed value or something like that [sigh] [sigh] if the b- um bond me- if the measure didn't pass [mn] 

452.14 452.71 B: [sigh] 

458.12 460.01 B: (( [sigh] right )) 

463.77 466.66 A: what the schools would do is is simply close early 

467.19 471.50 B: [sigh] [noise] and that just doesn't that doesn't help students learn [laughter] 

469.98 479.73 A: [sigh] well what happens is [noise] when you close early and s- send the kids home for two weeks b- before their parents were expecting that they'd be home [laughter] 

477.07 488.90 B: [mn] then [laughter] you'd have two weeks of day care to pay for which is going to cost you more than [noise] [sigh] than what you would have probably paid in increased [laughter] t- taxes for to [sigh] to to keep the schools open [laughter] 

485.62 487.09 A: (( [laughter] [sigh] a- and )) 

487.13 493.11 A: and then the next year they'd pass the bond issue [laughter] 

489.88 494.82 B: [noise] [laughter] a- ah sort of intimidation [laughter] 

493.89 501.16 A: y- yes e- [noise] either give us the money or we'll send junior home [laughter] you'll have to put up with him 

496.68 509.84 B: [laughter] [sigh] oh that works if you have people [sigh] paying the [sigh] the the tax that have kids [laughter] that will be coming home early 

509.36 515.23 A: [sigh] [sigh] well that was before the pill so there were lots of kids in every family [laughter] 

513.94 522.32 B: [noise] [noise] [sigh] i think [sigh] you know e- education is the the best investment that we can make [laughter] in the country and they 

522.15 534.91 B: for for the future of the country and the future of the economy [sigh] a- and unfortunately it it doesn't seem like ah enough americans agree with that point of view [sigh] [noise] 

533.66 541.02 A: [sigh] [sigh] well if as is in s- san francisco you ah the money you give is ah thrown away then it's not an investment 

540.98 542.63 B: (( [noise] [mn] true [sigh] [noise] [sigh] [sigh] )) 

541.97 547.67 A: [sigh] and we want to see some results from this huh [sigh] and ah the teachers [laughter] [sigh] 

544.01 551.33 B: so what what's wrong [noise] why aren't you [laughter] electing people that are accountable [sigh] 

550.91 559.82 A: well we have a a strange way of [sigh] m- managing ah the problem with the obviously deranged we elect them to the board of supervisors [laughter] 

557.81 564.93 B: [sigh] [noise] [laughter] [sigh] oh that's [sigh] ah i i suppose that's one way 

563.68 564.49 A: i mean 

564.73 573.01 A: well really i mean y- you if you want [sigh] if you have a job that [sigh] ah requires some knowledge [sigh] of ah say 

573.21 579.15 A: [sigh] ah schools then you elect somebody to the school board who knows absolutely nothing about education 

578.87 584.47 B: [sigh] ah [sigh] isn't that the um the peter principle [noise] [laughter] [laughter] 

582.00 588.97 A: [sigh] w- [laughter] w- well [sigh] i think it goes beyond that as i say we don't want people who know about education to be on the s- [laughter] school board [sigh] 

587.60 590.79 B: (( [laughter] )) 

589.08 595.42 A: i s- suppose t- the less the less for a new ah [sigh] fresh outlook [sigh] or whatever 

595.43 599.96 B: [sigh] r- right which w- w- might work if they were looking in the right
