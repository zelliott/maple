449.42 451.02 B: (( [cough] right )) 

450.37 456.62 A: but you know there's always counselling and doctors but you know you can't force someone to go uh [mn] mm [mn] 

457.20 465.91 B: [noise] well it's tough and you know i've never been married but i can only imagine like it's probably just you know the relationship to the extreme and then 

466.24 467.65 B: you know if uh 

467.83 482.44 B: one person isn't happy then they have other obligations besides you know just just the uh partner and stuff you know if you've got kids involved [noise] and things like that it's just a shame when things don't work out and you know and people don't want to work on it but uh 

481.93 483.78 A: yeah yeah like the ol- 

482.61 489.73 B: or well it's you don't want to you don't want to dwell on it though i mean you sound like an intelligent enough guy i mean you

502.87 503.79 B: really 

513.81 518.14 B: yeah you know it's it's tough and you know sometimes it's just like 

518.09 525.41 B: you know it wasn't meant to be or whatever and you know there's no real predictable science to it you know you can't tell if 

525.37 538.14 B: if they're going to be happy forever or change their mind or whatever you know if if you're really good friends to start with and then you have a relationship and then maybe find out that you're not you know the greatest uh couple 

538.36 540.94 B: you know that that could be tough too but uh 

541.34 548.86 B: i don't know i guess you just you just get lucky i guess and and it happens and you just got to just got to go out and do it 

548.91 553.79 A: [noise] [noise] yeah but you know as well as i do when you have problems you're supposed to talk not walk
