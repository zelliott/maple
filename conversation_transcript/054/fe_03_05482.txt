0.00 1.07 A: hello 

0.71 1.97 B: (( hello )) 

1.93 3.27 A: hello this is alan hey 

2.53 4.47 B: [noise] this is marty [noise] 

4.25 5.11 A: marty 

4.56 6.79 B: did you catch what topic was 

6.50 9.62 A: yeah something about uh uh 

8.33 9.05 B: (( [noise] )) 

9.64 12.16 A: uh uh uh televising uh 

12.25 15.84 A: criminal uh trials with high profile people 

13.01 14.30 B: (( [noise] criminal trails )) 

14.73 15.82 B: okay 

16.68 19.97 B: well like the o._j. simpson actor right 

20.02 22.05 A: yeah i'm guessing that's what it would be 

21.87 24.15 B: (( well what do you think about it )) 

25.09 37.72 A: uh well it made for interesting t._v. for a while but uh it was almost like too much emphasis that's all the news was on and i think um if it's a high profile it's it's 

32.29 33.22 B: (( yeah kind of )) 

37.86 44.34 A: the ones that really will be pushing that will be like uh the broadcast networks and the news networks because it provides a 

44.41 48.64 B: like c._n._n. and stuff like that yeah it seems like with like uh 

44.90 46.71 A: ch- chance to fill up some of their news 

48.51 49.44 A: right 

48.80 50.04 B: the uh 

50.23 56.91 B: o._j. trial though it was like on all channels even the a._c._c. and n._b._c. it's like twenty four hours a day almost 

56.65 57.64 A: (( [laughter] )) 

57.66 58.88 B: (( daytime )) 

59.82 61.31 A: yep that's right 

60.64 63.19 B: [laughter] no kidding 

61.76 64.85 A: he didn't get that much attention when he was playing football 

64.25 66.09 B: i don't know it's kind of a 

66.44 71.84 B: what they're looking for is you know what we think about the you know should it be done and i 

72.48 75.01 B: you know me personally i kinda think that uh 

75.63 83.10 B: the whole concept of the criminal justice is that your face your accuser and your jury and you know and uh 

83.36 87.32 B: that as many as can fit in the the courtroom so 

87.56 91.79 B: therefore by pinning onto the it kinda adds a lot of pressure and and uh 

92.08 95.40 B: staging and stuff like that by the lawyers don't you think 

99.88 101.71 A: yeah it does and uh 

102.01 108.81 A: and what you you and thinking back about the o._j. trial you think about how successful the lawyers in that case 

108.68 120.45 A: have been since the trial took place would never have been a success or probably without it having been televised so it's and any lawyer is gonna say yeah let's do this 

110.16 111.48 B: (( mm right )) 

114.42 115.33 B: sure 

117.76 125.78 B: yeah kinda puts added pressure on the jury to to come up with really non biased answer which is kinda jury has to do is to be biased right 

120.49 124.58 A: but um whether or not it's good for the client or not um 

127.88 128.89 B: so 

128.99 132.95 B: it kind of hampers the criminal justice system altogether in a way 

131.71 132.70 A: that's right 

132.77 133.70 A: (( that's right )) 

140.02 146.72 A: right but but you you think now just about every every facet of government now is televised uh 

144.26 145.22 B: (( mhm )) 

147.54 152.52 A: with the uh house and and and the senate both being televised on cspan 

150.20 152.58 B: yeah court t._v. and something like that 

152.69 154.62 A: and of course there's a um 

154.82 155.83 A: a uh 

156.34 158.74 A: a trial channel i guess is what they call 

159.58 169.41 A: it court t._v. yeah yeah which would televise not on- i i don't guess federal cases are allowed to be televised but a lot of state cases apparently can be 

162.28 164.68 B: i got like divorce courts like that even 

170.42 171.70 A: (( and let the cameras )) 

173.58 180.75 A: right uh i you know i can see good i can see points both ways i i guess if um 

176.60 177.46 B: (( it's yeah )) 

181.32 189.60 A: someone thought they weren't getting a fair trial if it was being televised you might be able to get more attention if if if you uh you know if it was a 

190.29 205.25 A: uh somebody thought they were being railroaded to a a tri- on a trial but i don't imagine that happens too often but i guess if it was televised it might make uh every you know i guess it would also point out uh if you were getting bad representation by your lawyer 

194.40 196.07 B: [noise] well there's that i 

200.20 201.14 B: sure 

207.36 214.61 A: but i but i agree with you it's you know it it almost makes it like a circus um cir- sort of a circus atmosphere and 

211.94 215.98 B: [noise] right so they better come up with some shockers and stuff like that don't they 

214.81 218.22 A: have it televised and everybody tuning in to watch it 

216.60 220.14 B: but you know something else you might think about but you know in this 

218.86 224.10 A: and if if something exciting doesn't go on then it they don't feel like it's been a successful day 

220.60 224.31 B: in the whole concept of uh you know fairness 

224.46 228.74 B: is um you know if you publicize or televise 

227.67 228.43 A: yeah 

228.81 230.52 B: one person's trial 

231.27 234.20 B: such as o._j. simpson or or anybody else it 

234.61 237.02 B: it uh may be no and uh 

237.87 242.93 B: you know and it and it whether it helps them or hurts them is it really fair 

242.90 254.04 B: because of the fact that you know there's trials that go on in the country every single day thousands and thousands of trials that never make it even into the local newspapers much less t._v. so 

254.13 263.33 B: you know even in that whether you consider it good or bad somehow biases um the difference in the outcome between a 

263.34 265.79 B: a noteworthy or pub- you know a 

265.91 274.36 B: publicity type trial versus you know the average joe who goes out here and just trying to trying to observe his freedom you know 

274.96 276.80 B: so you gotta wonder 

286.57 287.49 B: right 

288.77 291.35 A: yeah it's yeah yeah it's a 

292.49 293.62 A: it's a uh 

293.25 294.19 B: sure 

293.75 304.73 A: and it's not just uh high profile it seems like it's e- either like for instance it would be an actor or an actress or something like that or a politician or whatever but uh 

299.09 301.79 B: right jeff norma or something like that 

304.68 305.48 B: (( mm )) 

304.95 315.84 A: it either if that's gonna happen then they're gonna televise it they're gonna have a lot of news about it uh the other choice would be uh some kind of an unusual twist like a heinous crime or 

311.06 313.82 B: what i tell you an example would be that uh 

313.87 317.07 B: and i hate to say it because i can't think of any name but um 

316.86 322.28 A: right something like that that people would tune in you're right just the ordinary run of the mill [laughter] murder 

317.50 322.93 B: you know the actress who recently you know and i say when i say recently i mean like within the six months 

322.72 328.51 A: or other types of trials of course wouldn't wouldn't be wouldn't even be thought about being televised 

323.13 325.80 B: um and she was arrested for shop lifting 

326.32 328.61 B: you know who i'm talking about so 

328.82 331.27 B: you know i'm kinda thinking you know 

331.36 334.68 B: one way or the other the question is which way you 

335.60 346.36 B: know is it really fair that that they get so much publicity and there's so much on what jury decides how the judge acts and how good a lawyer and how 

344.36 345.20 A: yeah 

345.74 346.76 A: yes i do 

347.13 349.35 B: aggressive the d- you know uh 

349.90 352.94 B: the uh state attorney is you know 

353.18 354.81 B: stuff like that 

357.54 358.42 B: yeah 

364.52 365.68 B: right 

370.08 370.92 B: uh-huh 

372.10 373.19 B: i think the 

373.25 375.76 A: (( right yeah if the )) 

374.34 375.72 B: yeah especially if the 

376.75 379.99 B: oh especially when you're um you know 

376.95 379.33 A: that's gonna make or break their career isn't it 

379.42 390.79 A: you know y- y- you'd be seen as a uh as an aggressive person who's going out to to get out and get that person maybe he has a future in politics or if it's a defense attorney you know what a great 

382.13 387.81 B: there's you know no doubt as to the guilt and still get a a a not guilty verdict 

387.98 388.79 B: you know 

389.23 392.79 B: uh just altogether i think the concept 

391.15 393.91 A: what great publicity for my client and for my firm 

393.61 396.91 B: uh i don't know like twenty years ago or so 

395.34 400.67 A: especially if i get him off then i'm set for life because i'll be known as the lawyer that can get you off 

397.36 406.62 B: it was just unheard of to have even the concept the concept of put- allowing a t._v. camera or even a still camera in courtrooms was was unheard of 

411.44 412.89 A: right 

412.39 413.23 B: yeah 

413.68 414.88 B: yeah 

416.87 425.70 B: which which kind of alleviated the all the participants of any kind of um anxiety about publicity and stuff because they weren't getting their picture taken 

425.73 429.73 B: wasn't being televised and therefore the focus was entirely on 

429.87 431.41 B: uh what was happening 

431.47 437.30 B: so far as the case itself it didn't have anything but the publicity and i think that's that doesn't having 

432.08 440.67 A: yeah i can remember as a as a child watching t._v. uh news and and any type of main case all you would get is the drawing a fellow would come in and do a drawing of 

437.99 444.62 B: criminal justice really boils down to whether or not a person is spending the next twenty years or the rest of their life in jail 

440.84 442.72 A: what took place in the courtroom 

450.90 453.49 A: right 

459.74 460.84 B: (( [noise] right )) 

463.46 464.40 A: i 

468.02 468.94 B: right 

471.12 473.54 B: i agree with that yeah that way 

473.82 475.02 A: right 

475.11 477.35 B: it'd be a gamble on either side wouldn't it 

475.60 486.67 A: i don't know how individual states work if uh if it's totally up to the judge to say um yes this can be televised or no it can't be televised or whether 

477.68 478.89 B: [laughter] 

479.65 481.25 B: be kind of neat if uh 

481.60 484.03 B: could have a choice although you know 

484.25 485.27 B: i've never been 

485.49 488.54 B: accused of any kind of crime where i had to you know 

486.66 490.87 A: it he's required it's required to be televised without his decision 

489.01 495.24 B: make that kind of choice but uh you know if i did find myself accused i'd it'd be neat if i could say well i'd like 

491.26 494.02 A: it seemed to me he might be able to work out some kind of a 

494.09 496.01 A: a plan or both both 

495.57 498.77 B: i'd like for it to at least to be on my local cable channel 

496.21 500.25 A: the prosecution and the defense both would have to agree upon uh 

498.95 501.31 B: you know there wouldn't be nothing wrong with that 

500.95 502.71 A: before it would be televised 

501.37 503.76 B: (( yeah )) 

504.82 506.68 A: as as well as the court 

508.85 512.08 B: it would the people the people involved maybe uh 

509.19 510.24 A: sure would [laughter] 

512.49 515.50 B: maybe a witness or something might be able to see what was 

515.40 520.67 B: going on in the trial maybe they that would be the only person in the whole county that would be interested but here they are 

520.64 534.40 B: watching it saying what this is totally unbearable because i saw what happened you know and were afraid to come forward after they saw the progress of the trial maybe they were coming forward to the defense attorney and say hey i'd like to speak up it could change the course of a man's life you know 

532.05 533.40 A: that's right 

534.90 542.81 A: right and if it's a local a local trial then it you'd you'd at least be assured of getting a fair trial 

541.41 542.25 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

543.01 549.66 B: [noise] i guess really the end of it isn't it i mean the fact that there's always pros and cons to [noise] anything but freedom of choice 

549.79 552.28 B: seems to either prevail in uh 

552.85 560.32 B: in our country right now and it maybe there should be just more than anything else maybe the way that it should go is that uh 

559.89 562.07 A: (( right )) 

568.14 571.38 A: (( [noise] right )) 

572.24 580.02 A: so i guess we did- didn't determine either way whether we [laughter] we we determined that there's good points and bad points to it 

582.76 587.89 A: yeah right
