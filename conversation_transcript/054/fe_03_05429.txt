70.25 71.28 B: and texas 

71.35 75.38 B: texas is one of worst states for for kids school system 

74.79 75.83 A: (( [sigh] huh [sigh] [noise] )) 

77.20 82.10 B: um [noise] i think a lot of times what they do is also what do you know about this ah 

83.41 88.43 B: um this socialization graduation thing have you heard about that 

87.91 90.93 A: mm i don't t- think so i don't know what is it [noise] 

90.67 95.06 B: well it's like when a kid is like say you have twins that are in 

95.32 96.58 B: second grade together 

96.65 109.06 B: one of them's doing really really bad and probably shouldn't pass but instead of humiliating the kid and failing him [sigh] they let him go ahead and pass with his o- other sibling and to me that's just crap 

96.71 97.67 A: okay 

108.13 111.45 A: [sigh] [noise] [sigh] oh boy [laughter] [sigh] yeah that sounds s- sort of bizarre 

111.41 112.63 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

111.75 115.18 A: (( [sigh] [laughter] ah yeah [sigh] [noise] [noise] )) 

114.14 118.74 B: so i would say right there you know that just is just not acceptable 

118.96 125.88 A: [mn] yeah i mean i i have a major p- problems with public schooling system um and i'm twenty two 

125.91 136.98 A: [sigh] and so it hasn't been that long since i've been out of high school and like i hated every moment of of being in school because i i think it's just an awful place [sigh] it's a bad place to learn [sigh] 

137.17 150.77 A: and you have mean teachers that don't like kids [sigh] and it's like t- the the one thing you learn there is t- the feeling of humiliation [laughter] [sigh] more than anything else and it's like [sigh] it's just not a good atmosphere for anything 

146.32 147.24 B: yeah 

150.66 159.13 A: um a- and i don't know i i don't really know what to do about it i i just i think there's something s- severely wrong with the way things are done because [sigh] 

159.26 167.28 A: they don't [sigh] they don't make learning enjoyable at school [sigh] and they try to do it by making you do s- stupid projects [sigh] but like 

167.17 180.02 A: that's not really why learning is good you know learning is good because you're supposed to just naturally enjoy knowledge [sigh] but they don't present it that way they they make it seem terrible and then everybody hates it [sigh] so [sigh] i don't know th- there's this 

179.86 185.37 A: there's m- mostly social problems with s- schooling i i or public schooling i think 

185.31 186.27 B: yeah 

185.70 188.56 A: not that not that private schooling is much but [sigh] mm 

186.51 187.90 B: (( well )) 

188.72 192.62 B: i would think um too you know most countries 

192.96 205.81 B: um spend a lot of ah a lot of government funds and so forth on you know the schools themselves and [sigh] the um the teachers you know and i think it all kind of starts there 

205.90 207.45 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

206.18 215.54 B: [sigh] you know you get g- good teachers in these people are they're not happy with what they're doing a- a- ah from what you're telling me and it just it's not a good environment 

213.68 220.55 A: yeah i i mean the t- the part of the problem which i realize it's g- good for teachers you know since it's when they they got um 

221.63 227.21 A: [lipsmack] ah what's it called um [sigh] i forget the word [sigh] where they can't be fired ah tenure 

227.37 228.10 B: yeah 

227.38 232.85 A: because like i i i have a [sigh] a friend of the family who she she has a seven year old daughter [sigh] 

232.68 243.08 A: and her teacher has tenure and it's like this this little girl samantha she's six years old [mn] she was having a birthday party and the teacher h- humiliates her in front of the class and says 

242.99 256.69 A: [sigh] samantha and like she hated two other kids these are bad kids [sigh] they're not good you shouldn't hang out with them don't go to samantha's birthday party [sigh] and like how could you do that to a six year old [sigh] and then because she has tenure there's nothing they can do about it i mean you [sigh] 

256.46 263.17 A: they filed like a write up on her but it's not like she could get fired or really get into any kind of trouble [sigh] you know for something like that [sigh] 

261.51 262.49 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

263.29 266.89 A: like that's the kind of thing that'll like will stick with a kid for life you know 

267.28 269.99 B: yeah [sigh] i i think ah well 

268.56 269.35 A: (( [sigh] so [noise] )) 

269.93 284.11 B: ah [mn] it should be two fold then you should have you know ah more government funding in this country for schooling and then on top of that j- just along with that if they're spending the money and g- giving the teachers more money then there should be strict guidelines 

276.37 278.66 A: yeah that i totally agree with 

284.16 287.48 B: (( [sigh] you should have ah you know the teachers should ah )) 

288.54 290.06 B: be more accountable 

290.13 291.95 A: [sigh] [sigh] yeah i mean it's 

290.43 292.19 B: held more accountable [noise] 

292.18 299.11 A: just the whole system is out of whack [sigh] it's like [sigh] the school district i went to was pretty wealthy [sigh] and um i 

299.28 304.20 A: i think in my senior year in nineteen ninety eight they [sigh] they released in like just like village 

304.44 310.27 A: ah newspaper kind of thing a- all of the money that all the teachers in the district made and it's like [sigh] 

310.89 322.85 A: some like some of the good teachers weren't paid very much and then [sigh] i i and i swear by this we had a gym teacher [sigh] who was paid seventy two thousand dollars a year to teach gym like [laughter] 

322.81 323.87 B: was it a 

322.84 327.92 A: i don't know that just sort of blows my mind th- [laughter] [sigh] that you could get that much money 

325.92 330.10 B: he wasn't a coach or anything like that was it a coach or something 

329.53 339.61 A: [sigh] i mean he he did some coaching too but like [sigh] i just i still don't fathom how that's possible [sigh] but it's just because he w- he worked his way up in the ranks the guy actually he um 

339.88 350.03 A: [lipsmack] he played in in the ah major league baseball for p- philadelphia a- at at some point in his life i i don't [laughter] i mean i i don't know [sigh] i don't i don't understand 

348.46 349.90 B: i do have 

350.02 352.57 B: yeah i do have a friend that um 

352.70 357.25 B: [lipsmack] she's a high school teacher and she does like the ah cheerleaders 

357.20 358.15 A: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

357.26 368.24 B: and th- any time after like like coaches teach ah cheerleading things or like [sigh] or like drama teachers they get extra money [sigh] f- for 

367.09 368.19 A: (( [noise] yeah [sigh] [noise] )) 

368.15 376.87 B: s- staying later and and doing those ah being a a like a club ah sponsor or things like that that might explain why 

374.58 376.88 A: [sigh] right yeah i will admit all that make sense [sigh] 

377.08 382.07 B: yeah 'cause they're spending i mean a co- a football coach or baseball coach do all that travelling they do all 

382.16 386.96 B: spend a lot of time with the kids that kind of thing um but ah 

384.41 385.71 A: (( yeah [sigh] [noise] [noise] [sigh] )) 

387.76 393.00 B: you know i i i agree with you i think that sports are ah taking on too much of an emphasis 

393.14 395.86 B: [sigh] in our society [sigh] and ah 

396.34 398.84 B: (( you know you could see it in the school system big )) 

398.13 405.75 A: yeah i mean sports are good don't get me wrong about it i think they're very e- essential to ah to a child's upbringing to a to a degree 

403.58 413.27 B: time yeah but there is a limit like that whole the brawn james thing gosh here's a little high school kid and [sigh] e._s._p._n. was ah na- televising his games come on 

413.18 426.23 A: [laughter] yeah t- there is like a limit i mean [sigh] i know in my school it's like in my high school it would cost more money [sigh] to turn to have the lights on during a football game at the stadium [sigh] than 

414.62 417.17 B: ah talk about poison that kid 

426.19 429.60 A: you know just for one game it cost more money than like [sigh] 

429.52 433.08 A: the entire like earth science department had for a whole year [sigh] 

432.90 446.66 A: and it's like i mean i realize you know there's some kind of c- costs like electricity that you can't get around but [sigh] there seems to like it's kind of unfair that [laughter] [sigh] that sports have this much more m- monetary emphasis than s- science 

441.45 442.96 B: (( y- yeah )) 

446.99 454.74 A: um but i don't know i mean i i there's there's other problems too like curriculum problems i think is a big thing um [sigh] the one thing 

455.08 459.56 A: i mean i'm a philosophy major well not any more now i have my degree in it but [sigh] um 

459.57 463.77 A: it i find it really bizarre that p- philosophy is never taught 

464.01 469.86 A: in public schooling because th- that's the one field that l- links all of your knowledge together 

469.80 483.53 A: [sigh] and the other thing that goes along with that is the subject of logic like i don't know why that's never taught because if if school is to make you smart you'd think [sigh] you'd want to teach logic to people because that's the one t- thing in particular that and math that really sharpen your mind [sigh] but 

483.41 486.28 A: they don't do it it it's very strange to me 

486.46 491.28 A: [sigh] but i i i don't know i'm sure there's some kind of reason for it maybe maybe [laughter] [mn] [noise] 

490.58 492.95 B: [sigh] [sigh] yeah i don't know um 

493.84 495.48 B: (( i i'd ah )) 

495.99 498.20 B: i i you know i hate to put 

498.48 500.98 B: big government in it and stuff but 

500.42 502.44 A: (( [laughter] [sigh] yeah [noise] [noise] [sigh] )) 

501.91 514.26 B: but you know a- ah more most of like england and o- other countries that ah canada for god's sake they have so much better schooling [sigh] because their government is more involved um 

514.83 524.89 B: and you know if they want to go to college they don't have to spend all this kind of money you know you can go to a second tier or third tiered college basically for free yeah 

520.42 522.16 A: yeah 

524.85 538.09 A: [sigh] i mean i think the government should give money but they should i don't think t- the federal government should have too much of a say in where the money gets s- spent i think that should be at a local level [sigh] 'cause i i i don't i don't know [sigh] i don't trust the government too much for that [laughter] 

537.43 538.73 B: yeah 

538.14 541.18 A: i mean you need well see i don't know if you know this 'cause ah i 

541.07 554.14 A: was taking a history of psychology class and we were talking about statistics but [sigh] um there's a book i think it came out in nineteen ninety four called the bell curve and it [sigh] they did i- intelligence test studies [sigh] ah on people all across the united states and um 

554.16 563.32 A: [sigh] the average i._q. of of w- white people in the u._s. is one hundred but the average iq- q. of blacks is eighty five [sigh] which is something substantially lower [sigh] 

562.77 564.45 B: (( right [noise] right [noise] right )) 

563.46 564.45 A: (( and like )) 

564.48 571.50 A: t- that is like absurd because i mean th- obviously you know people are h- human there's nothing like inherently different [sigh] 

571.31 585.51 A: and like it's just because their schools suck and they're under funded [sigh] i mean it's wrong [sigh] i mean y- you have all these problems with like affirmative action but [sigh] if black people and minorities were e- equally educated and better educated we w- wouldn't have the need for it you know [sigh] 

585.81 586.88 A: (( but [noise] [noise] )) 

586.11 599.89 B: right well that that's where [sigh] that's where i think ah i i'm going to have to disagree with you on the fact that you said [sigh] that the government should s- spend more money but not spend more t- time in there because [sigh] you know if you give it to the local locals then
