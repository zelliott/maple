0.81 1.86 B: (( hello )) 

1.50 2.81 A: hello 

2.75 5.20 B: hi this is this is dmitri [mn] 

2.97 3.74 A: hi 

4.85 7.40 A: dmitri it's jay how are you 

7.07 8.30 B: good how are you 

8.11 16.16 A: pretty good i this is the first time for me [laughter] same all right then i guess they want us to keep to the topic of 

10.82 12.87 B: yeah [laughter] same 

16.10 17.12 B: yeah 

16.41 21.07 A: of censorship within [sigh] reading books in schools 

20.35 23.15 B: yeah private versus public i guess schools or 

22.40 27.97 A: i i did i didn't get whether it was private or public um but i guess 

27.10 33.50 B: i thought they just mean general if uh schools have the right to uh uh have students read certain books 

33.33 42.38 A: yeah well you know there are two way there are two thoughts on that one if it's private then i guess they have whatever they right they wanna do 

36.98 37.68 B: (( mm )) 

38.32 39.21 B: yeah 

42.17 43.52 B: yeah i agree 

42.80 55.27 A: uh you know that your you you're paying you have the right to take your child out of that school if you don't like it [sigh] um on the level of a public school [mn] [mn] 

48.11 49.04 B: yeah 

53.83 57.89 B: yeah it's a little different because you know it it's the gover- it's 

57.73 68.45 B: run by the government but you're not paying for your child to go there but at the same time i mean i think uh teachers and and the school system have a right to 

68.33 74.00 B: try and offer the children as best [mn] education as possible and if that takes reading certain books 

74.12 78.84 B: then i think that's just granted with you sending your child to school period 

78.75 87.11 A: so you see no um book that you would say is 

87.62 88.18 A: (( [sigh] )) 

88.27 90.23 A: one that should be 

90.56 93.69 A: [lipsmack] what's the word um banned from the school 

92.00 92.92 B: censored 

93.40 102.75 B: well i i feel i feel like if it's a certain book that causes controversy but it presents uh an extreme form of view or one view that's not favored 

102.58 116.71 B: then in that case the school may just uh offer another book that offers a [mn] opposite view i mean i- in regards to me like religion versus evolution something like that um if it's something like that then a school can present two books but 

102.69 103.55 A: (( sorry )) 

112.92 114.08 A: okay 

116.67 126.86 B: usually if if it the book doesn't cause controversy and it's middle of the road uh or presents two views itself then i i don't see any problem with the school making that decision 

126.62 127.42 A: (( [mn] )) 

127.82 131.23 A: here in my thought goes more like this 

131.40 137.12 A: [mn] the reason i'm not for book banning on any level 

136.81 138.25 B: mhm 

137.41 149.45 A: [sigh] um i do believe though that there's a possibility that a parent can can [sigh] have a voice in saying that i don't want my my child to read that particular book 

149.01 149.98 B: mhm 

149.38 155.76 A: but i don't think the parents should be able to say [sigh] hey nobody in the school can read the book 

155.42 157.93 B: yeah yeah that yeah that's 

157.27 163.28 A: [mn] you know um i mean i'm you know i i'm a believer that let's say [sigh] 

163.60 165.21 A: you know if you [sigh] 

165.25 170.25 A: if we [mn] don't write about world war two and the atrocities 

169.98 171.23 B: (( yeah )) 

170.68 177.30 A: that occurred and we pull the books outta the school [sigh] how long 'til we forget 

177.00 178.25 B: what happened 

177.68 190.73 A: what happened and that the possibility begins to [sigh] ignite all over again um i mean i'm a pretty much when i consider myself 

178.61 179.64 B: yeah 

184.49 185.74 B: yeah 

192.09 201.75 A: [sigh] what side of the line politically [sigh] i i ride or socially i sometimes you know i used to think of myself as a liberal [mn] 

197.66 198.53 B: mhm 

200.96 202.25 B: (( yeah mm )) 

201.83 204.77 A: but [mn] then again i'm 

204.91 209.74 A: i don't i don't consider myself a liberal any more i consider myself 

209.98 211.40 A: [sigh] per topic 

211.44 212.76 B: mhm 

212.01 216.64 A: uh for instance [sigh] a lot i have i have an eleven year old 

216.26 217.56 B: mhm 

217.57 226.65 A: [lipsmack] so i can be conservative on topics now that i might not have been you know before he was born 

223.03 223.89 B: yeah 

226.20 227.69 B: yeah yeah 

226.86 233.55 A: you know i was like okay everybody for themselves and then i realized well everybody for themselves just doesn't work [sigh] 

233.16 234.28 B: yeah 

233.68 238.06 A: and in school i want as much 

238.77 240.34 A: variety 

240.08 241.49 B: yeah yeah 

240.46 252.25 A: available whether it be with you know once you stop with books then you can say well [sigh] we don't want books written by so and so and we don't want people who look like so and so i mean [sigh] where do you stop the freedom 

244.85 245.71 B: yeah 

248.02 248.86 B: yeah 

250.38 251.19 B: yeah 

251.96 256.49 B: yeah p- personally i mean i'm i don- i don't have an eleven year old i'm only eighteen 

256.35 267.98 B: [sigh] um and i just came out of of a private school that uh basically presented all its own books its own classes you know i the [mn] and there hasn't been any controversy really over books [sigh] 

267.89 273.15 B: so i believe i i i agree with you i think there should be a variety [sigh] um i mean i can't see 

273.41 283.46 B: for books that concern history i can't see that ever being a problem or i can't imagine that being banned because that's history that's facts i mean you need you need to look at it uh 

282.27 288.88 A: [mn] well there are a lotta peo- i mean yeah i'm sure that woul- i mean you're are you from new york area 

286.03 287.17 B: yeah i mean 

288.22 289.95 B: yeah i'm from the new york area 

289.14 304.10 A: okay [sigh] now let me pose that questi- that same statement that you made and say we came from rural south or north carolina [sigh] and a skinhead said well that never happened so that version of history is totally wrong 

294.55 295.41 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

305.32 308.10 B: that in that case i mean [mn] 

307.86 316.20 A: you know there's a whole other spectrum you know [sigh] we talk from you know we come from a very [sigh] open part of the country 

308.89 309.95 B: yeah 

315.42 316.51 B: yeah 

315.97 327.45 A: and [sigh] you know you can go to the south in in t- i remember when i was your age i went to texas in southern texas brownsville and they had never seen a jew 

322.16 323.06 B: (( mhm )) 

325.79 326.78 B: mhm 

327.53 328.44 B: wow 

328.29 330.68 A: and they asked me where my horns were 

330.86 333.04 B: [mn] yeah i've heard that's that's incredible 

332.17 336.62 A: [mn] okay so my point being is that 

333.35 334.09 B: (( [mn] )) 

337.43 348.42 A: [sigh] [mn] we're in agreement we are really in agreement in in that there's no question in my mind that [mn] i mean they would book they would ban look how many people wanna ban harry potter 

339.94 341.20 B: oh yeah yeah 

348.18 351.85 B: yeah it's because of the witchcraft and all the christians were against that yeah 

350.39 357.76 A: right y- you know there's a whole big christian movement but then there's a whole other christian movement that says [sigh] that's crazy 

357.61 358.54 B: yeah 

358.01 367.00 A: y- you know [mn] to allow one to allow one group to say that another group can't do something 

366.88 368.07 B: yeah 

367.42 375.16 A: is wrong it's all right for one group to say that everybody can do it and then you have your choice of whether you don't want to [sigh] 

375.06 385.67 A: or you know or do want to it goes goes to the internet i mean as a parent i lock myself ou- my child out of [sigh] certain you know outta sites 

376.39 377.22 B: yeah 

385.32 386.46 B: yeah yeah 

385.68 389.23 A: because i i don't want him to be there but when he's eighteen 

388.93 390.19 B: yeah i mean that's 

389.43 392.03 A: am i gonna be able to lock him outta the sites 

391.19 393.05 B: mm no yeah yeah 

392.22 394.25 A: no [sigh] so 

393.05 402.96 B: i mean yeah it it's a huge gray area especially in this day and age where [sigh] where you have the internet you have t._v. you have everything i mean it's not just reading books any more it's there's so m- 

402.80 415.34 B: children are so [sigh] you know uh exposed to everything out there it's just and it's so hard now for parents to try and control it [mn] it's uh it's really it's hard i [mn] i can see how it would be hard for a parent to 

414.44 419.43 A: [mn] [sigh] look how the i don't know if you read about the uh new york law school professor 

419.31 420.88 B: no no 

420.25 434.73 A: um he there were two he called for technical work on his computer two technicians [sigh] came worked on his you know came to work on his computer [sigh] and they found the largest pornographic website ever found by the 

426.99 427.91 B: mhm 

435.32 441.22 A: the [mn] i shouldn't say the largest pornographic website [sigh] the largest collection of pornographic 

441.41 442.78 A: child 

441.42 442.37 B: images 

444.12 445.51 A: photography 

445.35 446.59 B: jeeze 

445.91 446.98 A: ever 

447.01 451.57 A: and this is by a respected professor 

451.42 452.55 B: yeah 

451.50 465.58 A: and all the controversy that this brought up about well [sigh] should they have been allowed to look at his thing and is child por- pornography a victimless [mn] victimless crime 

459.22 460.18 B: yeah 

465.01 466.26 B: yeah 

465.51 475.68 A: and the whole fact of the matter is is that [mn] you know my viewpoint is is that child pornography can never be a victimless victimless crime because how can a five year old [sigh] 

473.86 474.90 B: yeah 

475.52 483.80 A: make up their mind whether they wanna do something or not [sigh] you know so and and yet you know who got fired the technicians 

477.89 479.49 B: yeah yeah yeah 

481.90 482.77 B: who 

483.65 484.84 B: jesus 

484.75 498.95 A: they got ta- they got fired [sigh] the professor of course got uh i think he eventually got canned i'm not sure but it took a long time [sigh] he negotiated an out [sigh] and he's fighting the courts 

496.00 496.89 B: (( uh-huh )) 

499.20 500.86 B: yeah that's incredible 

499.31 510.08 A: i mean you know and and so i- it's all [sigh] you know basically going back to the same story of what is [sigh] 

510.21 523.71 A: what should be allowed and what shouldn't be allowed and you know in schools i can't imagine that there's any book that should be banned [sigh] but i but then again if a book 

512.70 515.55 B: yeah and who decides [noise] 

523.85 526.53 A: with pictures like that were put together 

526.34 527.69 B: yeah yeah 

526.98 528.43 A: i'd wanna ban it 

528.36 540.99 B: yeah yeah well [mn] i mean it it just seems like [mn] common sense should be a factor i mean yeah there's a huge gray area but i mean when it comes to certain books like what you said that's obviously you know 

541.04 547.50 B: it seems like that has to be banned um but again who makes the decision 

547.51 548.55 B: (( you know )) 

548.04 559.10 A: that's exactly it you know those that that's why porn- regular pornography is not banned because it's you know it's freedom of choice 

549.83 551.84 B: that's that's the thing 

555.59 556.83 B: yeah 

558.91 560.32 B: yeah yeah 

559.45 570.56 A: where child pi- pornography would be not freedom of choice and it's considered child abuse and that [sigh] and they wanna you know they consider that [sigh] 

564.75 565.77 B: yeah 

570.39 584.25 A: not only is it child abuse by the person who takes the pictures or is involved in the act [sigh] but anybody promoting it by looking at it is [sigh] is part and parcel to the conspiracy 

575.24 576.08 B: yeah 

577.11 578.01 B: yeah 

579.88 581.09 B: yeah 

584.06 584.87 B: (( yes )) 

584.92 586.77 A: [sigh] and that i agree with 

587.06 590.85 A: you know that it's amazing and and you know they're sick people 

590.79 599.89 B: yeah yeah i mean th- they [mn] that's that's seems like a case that's just that's easy to evaluate you know like child pornography
