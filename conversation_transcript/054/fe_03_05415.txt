0.00 1.12 B: hi 

0.88 2.75 A: hi good evening how are you 

2.15 4.15 B: i'm fine thanks how you doing 

3.51 6.04 A: i'm doing pretty well this is my first time doing this 

5.36 6.45 B: yeah me too 

6.08 12.03 A: [laughter] right on okay so the topic uh then is the anonymous benefactor it's a tough question huh 

11.67 13.21 B: yeah 

12.14 14.44 A: okay where where are you by the way 

14.11 17.44 B: uh dower county pennsylvania and you 

16.05 18.53 A: oh okay uh orlando florida 

18.01 18.99 B: oh okay 

18.55 20.05 A: yeah sunshine state 

20.12 22.53 A: well have you ever run into that question before 

22.87 27.06 B: [lipsmack] no only that time they had that movie about that um 

27.19 29.76 B: guy who was offered a million dollars to sleep with his wife 

29.50 32.65 A: oh okay that's a tough question too huh [laughter] 

31.13 32.03 B: [laughter] 

32.79 40.06 A: well i the uh i i guess we're supposed to share our thoughts on that on that topic um the i guess this is the first this is n- you know first time for me so 

38.73 45.01 B: you know my initial reaction was that you know you take the money and you can always find another best friend 

44.58 46.10 A: right right 

45.50 48.89 B: but [sigh] i guess if he's your 

49.30 54.58 B: truly best friend then then it's probably not acceptable thing to do 

50.86 51.77 A: mhm 

54.80 67.60 A: yeah i would say i would say so um my i know my uh close friends have helped me out of quite a few jams whether it be just uh like a real life jam or an emotional jam whatever you know it's always good to have a uh buddy to talk to you know mhm 

66.66 72.14 B: yeah there's no question i have a guy that i've you know i'm fifty three and i've known him since i was ten 

72.27 83.04 B: and he's in chicago but we talk on on online about once a week and i see him maybe two three times a year and that's who i was thinking about when it came up so i can't sell the guy out for a million dollars [sigh] 

77.70 78.85 A: like oh you wouldn't 

82.41 92.26 A: right yeah and yeah i have the same thing i i've known this guy since i was uh five we grew up in the same neighborhood went to the same college you know and all throughout school we we used to fight each other we used to 

83.88 84.44 B: (( [sigh] )) 

91.70 92.95 B: right 

92.29 106.19 A: yeah everything but we somehow ended up really close friends even though we have different philosophical views on a lot of things and perhaps it's because of those reasons and and uh i really can't imagine uh tossing away that friendship for a million bucks though it is quite tempting 'cause at the moment i 

95.35 97.28 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] )) 

105.95 108.67 A: i am in a financial jam [laughter] so 

105.96 111.39 B: [noise] [laughter] yeah yeah really uh a million dollars is a lot of money but um 

111.41 121.02 B: [sigh] you know i have this view this really strange viewpoint about money it's just a way to keep score and i'm kind of losing at the moment to but um 

114.42 115.40 A: mhm 

116.61 117.57 A: okay 

121.06 129.87 B: it's it's just a way to keep score it's more or less that you'll leave your kids when you're dead so in the long run it probably doesn't al- matter all that much 

125.90 126.93 A: right 

129.61 137.00 A: no it doesn't it doesn't uh matter as far as you know the success or the value of the person how much money they have obviously but i mean 

133.39 133.95 B: (( [sigh] )) 

136.11 137.34 B: yeah no question 

137.02 138.85 A: yeah but there are some things that uh 

138.08 140.58 B: yeah yeah to have a roof over your head and 

139.88 151.57 A: yeah exactly a car to drive especially in florida we have crappy public transportation so that well that's an interesting uh viewpoint on that do you have any like particular religious viewpoints on that or or is just uh yeah 

142.97 144.34 B: yeah i understand 

145.98 147.35 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] )) 

150.64 153.68 B: religious gee that's a good question um 

154.69 157.37 B: religious viewpoints i don't think so 

158.18 169.13 A: i i'm just thinking about uh i'm not i'm not pushing anything o- on you of course you know but um i mean from a christian viewpoint [lipsmack] you know just the value of money uh compared to a friendship 

165.20 165.76 B: (( [sigh] )) 

168.64 175.00 B: oh sure i think that's true of any religion um you know the ten commandments do not covet thy neighbor's stuff 

169.35 170.06 A: and 

174.47 176.10 A: [laughter] exactly 

175.43 178.59 B: you know it really comes down to money um 

177.27 178.38 A: mhm 

178.86 181.91 B: unless the wife is really sharp but um 

181.04 182.53 A: [laughter] 

182.20 188.52 B: um so i think that we're both standing on this we're not selling out our best friend for a million dollars 

188.16 193.21 A: yeah i think that'd be it um now i think we've covered about two maybe three minutes [laughter] so 

192.38 194.18 B: (( how long are we supposed to do this for )) 

193.51 197.30 A: uh ten minutes yeah um 

194.28 195.45 B: really 

195.57 199.22 B: and and then there like a bell goes off and you go to round two or 

198.90 204.47 A: i guess so or or the call ends and we leave comments about what our experiences were like something like that 

204.34 215.54 A: um can you think of any other angles to discuss it can you maybe get around the million dollars like okay you get the million dollars and oh sure i'm not gonna talk to my friend again i mean w- what is there an ethical catch in there that uh they can mhm 

209.44 210.00 B: (( [sigh] )) 

214.52 218.57 B: well i yeah i think there i think it's a it's a do or don't i th- i don't think there's 

219.47 225.55 B: i mean if you're gonna sell out your friend you can get around it i'm sure but [mn] the other question is 

225.95 231.00 B: [sigh] the million dollars is an arbitrary number what happens if it's ten million dollars 

231.15 232.58 B: does it make a difference 

231.33 232.29 A: ah 

232.55 237.60 A: that's [laughter] i'm sorry dave but you gotta go [laughter] 

235.56 238.12 B: he's gotta go truly i mean and again 

238.39 240.34 B: the way i think about it now 

240.61 244.48 B: you know you talk about all these ball players that are making like a hundred and sixty nine million dollars 

243.80 245.20 A: mhm 

244.69 248.17 B: to me there's no difference between twenty million and sixty million 

247.98 249.16 A: right 

248.58 250.47 B: 'cause they're both fine [laughter] 

249.79 252.93 A: yeah both and almost both equally unattainable mhm 

251.91 257.63 B: exactly and it's so therefore you know it's like [mn] when the powerball lottery gets to be like a hundred and fifty million 

257.96 259.10 B: um 

260.12 265.75 B: people say i'm gonna play now but they wouldn't play when it was thirty million why is that gonna change their lifestyle 

263.26 264.13 A: right 

265.54 267.47 A: [laughter] exactly 

266.62 271.58 B: thirty million's fine you know i'll i don't play the powerball but thirty million would be just fine 

268.31 269.05 A: i 

271.15 274.50 A: yeah you know i really can't support myself on thirty million dollars but 

273.50 276.03 B: yeah really i need to go for the one sixty 

275.42 282.96 A: yeah yeah well i think um we we get some of that powerball craze down here when it gets real big it gets on the news and everything and mhm 

280.51 282.03 B: oh absolutely 

282.33 294.10 B: and i you know i'm i will do that when it's like a hundred and seventy i'll go spend ten bucks on l- on the thing but i don't do it on lower levels because that means i would do it every week and lose ten bucks every week and that's just silly 

293.81 297.00 A: right exactly you know i took a statistics class not too long ago 

296.90 302.66 A: and they were talking about uh like insurance companies use a partic- a par- a particular formula to um 

302.50 311.95 A: estimate the value of a dollar and so the value of a dollar that you play in lottery uh with the florida odds here it's like one in like twenty one million of winning the jackpot something ridiculous 

309.93 310.81 B: right 

311.92 320.54 A: uh the value of that dollar is something like negative eighty cents [laughter] so yeah as far as the return yeah i mean it's absolutely ridiculous the uh 

316.30 317.29 B: really 

320.49 328.46 A: the uh the chances on it and it's it's a suckers game it's a fool's game but still the allure of that a hundred and fifty million dollars 

326.48 336.74 B: oh there's no question and [mn] and it and it's also i i don't know what the statistics are but i would think that most people that play it are the ones that can least afford to play it 

336.38 338.01 A: i've seen that mhm 

337.06 340.67 B: 'cause they're living out the dream and i was in front of this lady the other day 

340.72 350.97 B: at a gas station and she was in her seventies and she didn't have a dime and she was playing all k- she was playing daily lottery she was playing instant lottery she was just she must've spent fifteen bucks 

351.20 353.74 B: took her a long time too and i'm thinking 

352.85 354.06 A: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

354.33 358.55 B: she just pissed away fifteen dollars and that's that's you know it might be 

358.96 366.73 B: that was all she does for a week but but still it's it's you know it's kinda silly she's better off going and playing blackjack or something 

366.12 380.56 A: yeah it is or maybe picking up uh some part time jobs i don't know if you've got grocery stores up like do- up there like we do i'm sure you do like where you know a lot of older people work in bagging and things like that greeters at walmart whatever you know the the here's another angle on that uh million dollar question 

380.64 388.14 A: [lipsmack] uh would you i mean you you mentioned you could probably make a new best friend i mean well i guess they're trying to 

387.34 389.29 B: that's right with a million dollars 

388.67 395.65 A: yeah i mean you could buy a lot of friends with a million dollars [laughter] uh w- do you think you could replace that friend of yours 

389.87 391.47 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

395.77 402.99 A: like um i mean over time of course not overnight you know then find the same emotional bond and attachment with somebody else or do you think it's impossible 

403.03 412.94 B: uh well i i know from my own experiences i guys that were my best friend um high school let's say high school college and then 

412.97 415.79 B: in my early thirties um 

416.61 424.91 B: he got involved with this woman that was kind of shady and whatever and we s- sort of broke off and it's been twenty years and i haven't spoken to him um 

421.16 421.89 A: okay 

425.61 438.47 B: has it you know every once in a while i wonder what he's doing but it hasn't affected my life so and i would've considered him if we had this call thirty years ago my best friend so can you get a new best friend yeah i think you can 

429.41 430.64 A: (( right mhm )) 

438.49 439.72 A: right 

439.08 447.71 B: uh as you age as you move as you whatever but [noise] like that guy from chicago there are guys that are your friends you know for will be friends forever 

447.21 448.39 A: exactly 

447.75 448.94 B: so 

449.37 453.00 B: would i give a million dollars to i probably wouldn't so 

452.21 461.60 A: all right well uh are you married okay what if your wife was like critically ill i mean god forbid you know i mean or other situation like that about to lose the house 'cause the economy took a dive 

454.03 455.25 B: yeah 

457.49 458.29 B: right 

460.92 462.72 B: yeah then i'd probably do it 

462.47 472.26 A: yeah i mean i think that's where where i draw the line if i was about to lose uh property or a loved one needed surgery or some- something like that where it's just a dire circumstance i'd i'd think that uh 

471.40 481.18 B: yeah and that's you know and that's just that's the difference between the money just to keep score to buy a car or to buy a better house that's talking about you know situations where 

476.85 477.79 A: right 

481.58 487.59 B: um you would do whatever you would need to do to save your family or feed your family or whatever 

487.06 493.80 A: mhm yeah in that in that case i think i'd have to have to take it and uh hopefully my best friend would understand you know 

493.68 496.42 B: (( see him in see him in the next life )) 

493.92 495.37 A: the face of the earth 

496.21 497.76 A: (( yeah exactly )) 

496.87 509.06 B: talk to you next time um yeah so i i i think that there are different parameters and i think that the concessions that we both came to is that we wouldn't do it but if there were circumstances 

507.02 508.10 A: mhm 

509.06 514.42 B: that there's a ninety percent chance we wouldn't do it but there are circumstances that we'd say that we would do it 

513.83 517.74 A: yeah i i think so then depending on how dire they are what kind of work do you do by the way 

517.19 519.64 B: i sell medical equipment yeah 

518.44 528.64 A: oh really cool yeah i'm in i'm in marketing i work for uh a company down here i'm in the marketing department and i used to be in sales actually printing and things like that so and uh you enjoy that mhm mm 

528.83 543.24 B: it not as much as i used to it's uh the medical field is really hurting um the doctors are getting a lot less reimbursement with managed care so i've been doing it for like twelve years and back you know ten years ago 

539.00 539.92 A: mhm 

543.34 554.06 B: doctors bought equipment based on what they were feed for service and now they're they're not buying that much equipment the or replacing equipment because they're getting a f- usually a flat fee from the insurers so 

553.73 554.86 A: mhm 

554.21 556.43 B: we we do definitely have a uh 

556.63 561.41 B: national health crisis in this country that will come to fruition at some point [noise] 

561.09 566.95 A: you know i believe that i have a a girlfriend that um sells for cardinal you know like uh there's the uh 

567.14 581.44 A: instruments i guess and uh it's phone sales for her and it's tough um and that's that talk about a tough industry uh she's somebody actually [laughter] who could actually use the million dollars you know um to uh to help out with some of things she's got going on that uh yeah so 

567.67 568.79 B: right sure 

581.30 582.36 B: (( commission )) 

582.23 590.67 A: um the her her she's mostly commission yeah from what i understand i mean like it's a little salary it's not much at all you know it's like twelve a year or something like that 

590.17 599.95 B: i used to work i worked for one company eleven years and they sort of went under and i worked for a company called more medical which was more supplies there in connecticut and i tr-
