1.02 2.86 B: hi there the name's ivo 

1.06 2.24 A: greetings [lipsmack] 

3.47 13.89 A: greetings good afternoon my name is harvey golladay i'm with the christian youth foundation i live in las angeles california and i would like to direct myself to the topic quickly if i may 

13.86 15.83 B: absolutely 

15.19 16.94 A: so uh 

16.87 25.66 A: friends i think friends are more honorable than money and i think money is uh honorable and incredible in its own place 

25.45 32.57 A: i think you cannot mix the two in regards to relationships as well as any matter 

32.39 36.42 A: of um collateral that's the situation that i have 

36.23 49.93 A: there's no matters of a connection between money emotions or human kind money is supposed to be designed for the betterment of human kind regardless so that's my comment in regards to that 

49.18 51.97 B: that's cool i i can certainly respect that i 

52.06 61.36 B: i have about the same opinion um i call money the the way that we trade our time and and things that we make 

61.41 70.92 B: um for other time and things that other people make um and uh shouldn't have anything to do with uh friendship i quite agree with you 

71.73 83.50 B: yeah a million dollars uh if i traded me be- you know spending time with my best friend for a million dollars then i'd have to live with myself for having done that and uh i'd certainly see 

83.53 86.35 B: you know no reason why i would go that route 

87.48 99.26 A: now in regards to your comment in regards to everything in relation to what is happening today in uh money i think that money is a definite factor that has uh taken 

99.15 105.21 A: the precedence over moralities and some other factors that are in keeping with uh 

105.07 107.11 A: (( human uh ethics as well as uh )) 

106.88 107.78 A: (( the um formulation )) 

107.64 122.21 A: ((  )) 

121.99 124.66 A: (( the world today has moved away from you know )) 

124.56 126.88 A: (( the biblical structures in which we're )) 

126.71 135.57 A: ((  )) 

135.37 142.90 A: (( change that would actually uh you know be practical you'd have to go in baby steps to get from where we are now to to )) 

144.17 149.49 B: um well yeah i i guess i generally agree with you that i think that uh 

149.74 155.25 B: that the idea way back when of of coming up with some standard way of 

155.45 166.54 B: uh trading things and using gold or or whatever to be the standard way of doing that even before gold salt was the big trade uh the form of trade 

166.38 175.43 B: and then eventually we got to abstract money which doesn't really directly relate to anything but um yeah i think once once things start uh 

175.89 189.42 B: to abstract to to be you know paper money not backed up with anything or even electronic money that you don't even see directly um that uh people started to lose their sense of uh 

189.67 202.35 B: you know of of what was real in relationship to money and uh it started becoming an end unto itself and uh people lost their sense of uh 

202.59 206.47 B: uh i guess reality in relationship to it 

206.38 207.11 A: where 

207.68 209.16 A: (( we should be )) 

209.67 211.95 B: well i think 

211.96 215.25 B: i think one one direction for a solution 

216.02 229.86 B: is uh is that people you know if people on a daily basis interacted with smaller groups that had more personal accountability and more personal connection 

229.96 235.51 B: so you know for example if companies were largely fifty people or less 

235.60 241.61 B: then you know if people su- made some if a if a individual person made some 

241.73 243.75 B: you know serious 

244.21 252.18 B: ethical decision they'd be thinking about real people that they knew as opposed to this you know a big mega corporation with 

248.76 250.02 A: (( um )) 

252.29 265.00 B: you know a hundred thousand or or a million employees um people no longer think about individuals they think about statistics and they don't therefore they make decisions based on numbers which they don't care about 

265.57 266.66 A: (( because you )) 

266.90 270.47 A: (( know nobody wants to make a big change all at once )) 

270.66 271.85 B: (( you know )) 

271.04 272.89 A: (( everybody wants things to be )) 

273.04 274.44 A: (( fairly familiar but )) 

276.61 280.00 B: (( what i mean so from the point )) 

281.08 282.27 B: (( of )) 

282.31 283.53 B: (( view of the )) 

284.06 287.12 B: (( government what is your suggestion in regards )) 

287.96 288.71 B: (( to )) 

289.01 289.87 B: you 

290.74 291.81 B: (( know )) 

292.51 293.85 B: change 

295.72 296.87 B: (( you )) 

297.48 299.59 A: right 

298.47 300.27 B: could make baby steps 

300.30 305.59 B: in the direction of smaller companies with um 

305.73 307.37 B: with less 

307.48 308.60 B: uh 

308.72 316.96 B: you know less laws and rules that uh dictate that decisions have to be made based on money versus ethics 

316.96 318.91 A: right 

317.73 326.70 B: 'cause one of the big things that i see as a problem right now [noise] is um public companies that have stock there are a ho- there are a whole bunch of laws that say 

323.86 325.19 A: right 

326.61 332.97 B: how they have to run their business so that the stockholders can make a maximum profit 

333.51 337.00 B: so the big companies are always making these decisions 

337.08 347.18 B: based purely on money and not on you know the the human ethical concerns involved i think reforming those areas would be really a good step [noise] 

347.91 352.18 A: so basically uh private sector should uh 

352.11 364.44 A: uh make the efforts and then it should be transmitted into the government because private sector is government and government is private sector more or less or people 

363.18 366.36 B: (( yeah i i i'd pretty much agree with that )) 

365.71 377.00 A: yeah i think that's pretty much the case where there definitely needs to has to be a change for the moral structure to evolve and for the uh 

377.01 388.14 A: unethical things uh immoral things to sor- sort of disappear slowly i think that would be the best case for a better world 

388.01 390.96 B: yeah i i completely agree with you that uh 

390.27 396.68 A: and so money is just a vehicle for some other things that doesn't deal with 

396.54 399.50 A: relationships in regards to 

399.35 413.79 A: um who's the best and how human kind should be treated and so although it's pretty difficult to turn your back on an enormous amount of money being addicted to it as we have been 

413.71 426.57 A: having everything that we can get when we do have it and just to uh push it away and say friendship is more i think that's uh a landmark for an individual to have that kind of a quality 

426.65 432.23 B: absolutely absolutely i i quite agree and it's all too rare currently 

433.17 435.06 A: so where do we go from here 

434.79 436.13 B: (( [laughter] )) 

436.18 437.45 B: well um 

437.47 443.31 B: you know i happen to be starting up a small company and i i am gonna be writing into the 

443.50 444.60 B: uh 

444.81 450.78 B: writing into the uh operating agreement of the company that it's going to stay small and private 

449.77 455.78 A: well congratulations in that regard and hopefully god will bless you with success 

452.57 454.13 B: yeah thank you i will 

455.57 458.34 A: because having a different approach 

455.58 456.57 B: i'll need 

458.14 470.49 A: yeah to uh to what we are accustomed to is uh you know a landmark and uh to put things aside and to have the moral structure 

470.28 481.52 A: as a paramount uh design of actions and concern is a very is is a big landmark i mean this is something that the mormons and the other people 

481.31 490.19 A: that have been able to set america up or other lands uh with ethical uh wellbeing this is what we need to return to 

490.51 492.94 B: i hope so i hope so i hope 

492.16 497.60 A: and i want to say to you congratulations and what is your company all about 

496.91 504.46 B: um well it's uh it is a new kind of financial service something that doesn't exist yet 

504.31 519.11 B: um so i'm not really giving out the details but it's something that should help you know people well actually i think on average it'll help um you know individuals and small businesses that aren't that well off that don't 

519.22 528.06 B: uh that don't have people to manage their finances and so forth but it's uh it's a pretty basic service that i think a lot of people will b- will find useful 

528.24 533.60 A: well then uh of course i'll be looking out to see exactly what it is 

533.38 543.51 A: and be uh looking and also looking out for any changes that are positive that will uh create the restoration of good morals 

543.21 553.45 B: thank you yeah the the company name um if if it gets trademarked properly i don't know for sure if that'll go through yet but the company name is currently franklin revere 

554.03 565.22 A: franklin revere that was something to do with one of the landmarks of the american uh uh history was it paul revere or something paul revere that's it 

555.42 556.15 B: that 

562.81 563.79 B: uh yeah that's 

564.33 568.14 B: that's why it's named the company's named after ben franklin and paul revere
