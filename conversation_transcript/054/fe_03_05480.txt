125.42 136.60 A: i don't basically well i think that that's the that's the one that sticks in my mind the most and also the yeah the the other one would be 

133.80 134.69 B: (( mm )) 

134.96 138.17 B: (( mhm )) 

136.73 147.95 A: yeah [laughter] yeah o. o._j. w- w- was such a controversial thing uh that when they did his movie they they went through the whole trial process

142.92 146.83 B: (( mhm )) 

147.99 153.78 A: and in the front of the movie they had he had fought them so hard after

184.74 188.18 A: that was like in seventy eight 

186.90 195.30 B: uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and i think ted bundy was was his trial televised ted bundy the guy was a lawyer that's killing the 

188.95 196.98 A: but the it it took it took them twenty years to catch him so he didn't didn't really get to go into the 

197.00 199.72 A: spotlight near as much but uh 

203.90 204.46 A: (( [mn] )) 

205.67 210.85 A: but right he was killing he w- i think he was killing young women but 

208.30 209.37 B: uh-huh 

210.62 221.13 A: they wanted to televise most of most of his stuff was all in the in the uh news media anyway so he had trouble getting a a jury seated 

212.19 215.83 B: (( mhm )) 

219.09 223.44 B: (( mhm )) 

221.30 227.86 A: whereas o._j. had his own jury consultant and he had his own uh

243.51 244.53 A: um 

245.23 246.19 A: but what 

249.57 252.52 A: it's it's almost um 

252.70 260.29 A: to the point where they wanna televise everything so then the the jury r- to the point where they wanna go and sit in with the jury a- 

253.16 262.49 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

260.99 265.96 A: where they're making the decision which then might actually uh

264.18 267.34 B: (( i can't talk right now i'm on the line let me call )) 

266.22 273.71 A: interfere with the jury process i don't know that's that's the next step you know you getting a cellphone call there james 

267.66 269.30 B: (( you back it's it's )) 

270.27 275.19 B: um yeah but don't you think uh these televised things have anything to do 

275.25 285.21 B: um well i mean r- uh ratings rating interests you know as opposed to well what do you think the 

275.89 277.24 A: uh 

278.87 280.11 A: okay 

285.14 295.00 B: i mean purpose of i mean the the ultimate um goal uh o- of one of the televised uh um 

295.19 300.20 B: uh case do you think it's for the more to 

300.75 315.28 B: so so the world can you know get get uh inside as to their guilt or innocent or do you think it's more to do with trying to get ratings mhm 

317.91 318.94 A: it's for 

327.80 336.86 A: i thi- i think it's more to uh it's more for ratings and also to paint a picture of the person they're trying to defend 

329.94 335.52 B: mhm hm hm 

336.71 343.46 A: from the defense's point of view as either you know usually uh there's 

337.54 338.27 B: (( uh-huh )) 

340.45 342.51 B: yeah 

343.34 346.40 A: if it's a public figure we wanna pre- 

343.54 349.04 B: mhm have you yeah but i don't know that then there may be a fair thing about the publicized 

346.24 355.19 A: preserve his image and make him better than he really was you know or something like that i i don't know i don't know how you feel about that one but it's 

348.84 360.02 B: trials is we also see his side i mean that's not left out we get a chance the world gets a chance to [sigh] uh for him to present his side also so 

354.96 362.14 A: it's li- or if they wanna if they want really wanna go after somebody they they use the media to make him a villain 

360.20 363.26 B: uh if folk was to you know show [mn] 

362.51 363.99 A: like a like a 

363.44 368.12 B: convict this person that's what you know the thing of it and so 

376.02 379.50 B: mhm 

382.69 386.90 B: mhm 

386.58 399.22 A: yeah the the other thing was in showing the trial if they screw up and and they make a public record of it like there was some screw ups down here in houston by h._p._d.'s uh 

387.06 390.94 B: (( mm right oh really uh )) 

396.13 401.76 B: mm mhm now this is over what the video taped uh has h- 

399.11 411.88 A: crime lab it made the news w- in one of their trials when they had to go back and release a man that was con- wrong wrongly convicted spent almost twenty two years behind bars 

403.64 407.28 B: mhm 

411.64 412.54 B: mhm 

411.83 421.18 A: yeah and he got a uh large settlement from the city but can now go back and sue for compensatory 

412.76 416.82 B: (( mhm )) 

422.42 434.21 B: mhm hm mhm wasn't for the the taped record of the students i mean this never would've probably probably came out you know 

422.93 431.53 A: they they they had they had videot- they had videotaped parts of his trial but he he was able to get a uh 

431.74 440.67 A: group of college kids down here to go back and uh get the evidence retried because there was some problems with the d._n._a. evidence 

434.45 438.31 B: you were saying 

440.56 446.90 A: turned out the houston police lab had a leaky roof that contaminated the evidence 

446.11 448.52 B: (( hm )) 

447.53 450.33 A: so they were able to show that on t._v. 

448.87 450.25 B: yeah i 

450.60 465.54 B: don't know i've always been kind of infatuated with um i don't know i guess i get into that mould of um you know crime and uh you know i was reading a magazine earlier before they started televising a lot of the 

458.51 471.39 A: right so so they had to now they had to get a the governor uh pardoned him and uh basically said we're sorry but now he's got a like a twenty two million dollar case against the city of houston 

465.65 470.64 B: things so i don't know that infatuation with uh 

471.14 474.75 B: you know uh crime and um 

472.28 474.86 A: and so it's uh 

474.87 487.74 B: you know i guess curiosity too you know of um how they caught him or you know the evidence just how strong it is or or or like you know i suppose getting into the taliban's 

487.78 495.87 B: trials is more um guess uh curiosity of minds probably be a lot of people like me be 

491.89 496.35 A: (( right )) 

496.07 500.04 B: you know if you had doubts and no they couldn't have done it uh 

500.12 505.11 B: 'cause 'cause it has happened that you know i've i've uh watched some of those um 

505.45 515.76 B: you know pr- programs and of course we know the persons i believed they were guilty then when i watched the trial you know it changed my uh you know 

510.82 519.75 A: (( right )) 

517.05 519.50 B: opinions so 

527.32 528.26 B: (( uh )) 

531.39 540.55 B: mhm 

540.60 542.44 B: yeah i was curious what what 

542.52 552.02 B: celebrities yeah uh-huh mhm uh-huh yeah i think there was one that the prosecutors i saw some blurb where she 

547.19 553.11 A: [noise] yeah because it shows new evidence and you get to see it live and if they screw up you get to see that too 

552.11 554.80 B: was she had some t._v. 

553.58 556.38 A: uh i agree with you on that one 

554.93 556.01 B: um 

556.28 557.03 B: sh- 

557.01 563.85 A: because uh it's any well any high profile case usually draws a lot of media attention 

558.84 561.45 B: (( i don't think it's something unrela- )) 

563.86 566.49 B: yeah some kind of t._v. uh 

563.89 578.55 A: and you know what happened to the prosecutor and the assistant prosecutor in the in the o._j. simpson case the- they they're still making speeches over ten years later about the case 

567.14 569.56 B: (( what ever happened to that judge the uh )) 

586.19 598.57 A: few interviews on court t._v. i think something like that is it court is it court t._v. or something else like that
