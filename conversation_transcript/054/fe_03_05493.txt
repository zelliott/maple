0.93 2.30 B: craig benny 

1.97 3.73 A: hi uh paul leath 

4.15 5.06 B: how you doing 

4.81 6.87 A: [sigh] pretty good how are you 

6.75 7.91 B: (( good )) 

7.59 11.93 A: [lipsmack] so i guess this is uh my first one so i'm not sure really how it works 

11.56 12.59 B: yeah me too 

12.45 14.41 A: [laughter] 

13.37 14.35 B: [laughter] 

14.80 17.19 B: so i guess we just talk about censorship um 

18.61 21.37 B: [lipsmack] i think they should be able to read any book they want to 

21.12 22.71 A: [mn] in college 

21.71 23.59 B: whether it's private or public 

23.28 29.43 A: oh [sigh] and why why why well why what's the reasoning behind that [sigh] 

31.07 32.20 B: [noise] i guess 

33.03 42.72 B: it kinda depends on the age i mean i'm not gonna let some fifth grader read a pornography book but i think once you get towards the high school level 

42.75 54.89 B: then they have to be able to develop some kind of selectivity in what they read and kinda some individuality as what they read so i think they need to be exposed to a wide variety of things 

54.73 58.08 A: uh-huh so would you clear it like uh 

58.43 59.42 A: (( um )) 

61.31 73.43 A: 'cause i believe to a certain extent [mn] you know they they're allowed to censor us you know based on university principles for instance in a parochial school you know you're not gonna want 

74.72 77.61 A: [sigh] them to uh you know 

77.70 90.04 A: read certain materials that are against their beliefs basically but i think that's [sigh] i mean to a certain extent i think it's one of the ways that they can open themselves up like you said [sigh] 

89.18 89.79 B: (( [noise] )) 

90.87 91.92 A: and um 

90.98 93.44 B: open themselves up to what 

92.78 96.54 A: open themselves up to uh other views and other uh 

96.70 108.97 A: other consensus to see to see whether or not it really matches or identifies with them [sigh] and to what they believe in [sigh] so uh i guess i'm with you that you know i don't think uh 

98.29 100.01 B: mhm 

109.20 121.21 A: schools should necessarily censor what the students read but i think [sigh] the schools can dictate what the students should read and whether or not those students read that or go off to a different tangents is up to the 

122.68 127.53 B: [noise] yeah i mean i think it's just there's a hard way to draw the line into what is 

128.18 141.95 B: acceptable and what's not i mean i think you have to be pretty egregious with the subject topic i think if you're gonna start censoring books that have real kind of artistic values if you wanna use like the upside i mean like 

143.43 155.92 B: [sigh] what's obscene if it if you wanna use like a sup- supreme court kind of standard for what's obscene i'm not gonna let them read obscene things but i would let them read [sigh] something that has artistic value to it 

154.92 161.10 A: students but but but who's gonna decide what has artistic value [sigh] and what is obscene 

161.19 164.15 A: i mean i think that's that's the basic question 

165.79 178.36 B: well i think if it's a book of you know straight pornography i mean you're gonna have to really have to sell it the artistic value on it i mean and maybe a a a 

178.15 188.20 B: book of nudes which has artistic value which is p- which is acceptable but then you have to kind of base that against who you're really letting see this 

187.40 189.14 A: (( [sigh] uh-huh )) 

189.60 198.82 A: 'cause i mean i i i've seen this um photos in you know what you're talking about in magazines and stuff [sigh] that's for a commercial purpose but what you're saying is like a 

189.73 190.29 B: (( [mn] )) 

198.78 206.86 A: uh what was it like a book of nudes or something [sigh] i mean that's also for commercial purpose but there's [sigh] more of an emphasis on photography and lighting and such like that 

201.52 202.38 B: yeah 

206.55 207.52 B: right 

206.93 208.21 A: i don't see 

208.50 211.33 A: any major difference [mn] 

210.76 213.92 B: you don't see any major difference between a book of nudes and pornography 

213.70 216.31 A: yeah i mean what's the difference 

216.99 222.11 B: well i mean obviously the book of nudes you're not engaging in sex acts it's usually just a 

222.38 224.29 B: a either a picture of 

224.40 227.69 B: one or a couple of people that are just naked 

228.14 240.11 A: [sigh] i mean i [mn] when i went to school i i saw like shadows pictures you know just darkened [sigh] bas- basically look like shadows and they were like you know having sex or something like that [sigh] [mn] 

239.74 243.16 B: yeah i mean obviously you can't let children 

243.18 243.74 A: (( [mn] )) 

243.29 254.93 B: you know read por- you you know view pornography 'cause i think [mn] you know as as as a straight question you know it's as you know i can't really define it but it's i know it when i see it 

255.13 256.99 A: uh what about the uh 

257.04 262.90 A: (( [mn] i'm in new york here and uh in new york there's a big statue of )) 

258.90 259.94 B: (( yeah me too )) 

261.84 263.28 B: yeah 

263.29 266.47 A: that uh was it was it french mary or something 

266.52 269.44 B: yeah with elephant growing and all that stuff on 

268.10 270.80 A: yeah what did you think about that 

270.98 278.87 B: it it's artistic it makes me it may be obscene in the sense that somebody is offended by it but it's not 

279.60 293.77 B: [sigh] [mn] it's not i i didn't get it was obscene to me because somebody's making a statement it's not necessarily [sigh] you know the point of throwing elephants on it i mean that that's a statement in and of itself 

293.36 294.23 A: uh-huh 

294.17 303.19 B: so i didn't have a problem with it because [sigh] if if i didn't like it i didn't have to go to the museum and look at it like i think i have my own 

303.19 313.70 B: censorship within myself like if i don't wanna see it then i don't see it so i guess that gets back to what you know the students they don't really have a choice in what they see so 

313.80 324.45 B: i think there has to be some kind of line [sigh] that as long as that line isn't you know really infringing upon the artistic value of what the topic is or what the book is 

324.46 326.78 A: [mn] do you remember what the topic was 

327.34 329.47 B: censorship and books and 

329.92 333.66 B: um of books in parochial and public schools 

332.71 336.36 A: [laughter] i see private and public schools i think it was [sigh] 

334.92 336.72 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

336.72 338.16 A: (( [mn] i )) 

338.44 339.46 B: so 

339.26 344.21 A: mean why why school why would school you know they carried everything they carried playboy 

344.27 348.01 A: you know they carried [sigh] america you know what is it 

348.33 352.38 A: it's absolutely essential political science review quarterly [mn] 

351.89 353.75 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

353.39 359.91 A: so and i don't think the universities are actually discerning what you should or shouldn't read [sigh] 

360.36 362.22 A: but i think they should 

361.39 367.91 B: well i mean i i think this this is more i think like high school and and below isn't it 

367.24 372.53 A: i thought it was for a private and public universities or schools 

371.93 374.07 B: oh okay well i mean [mn] 

373.72 378.14 A: [sigh] well basically i the issue is censorship [mn] 

377.80 382.69 B: well i i think it was more of an issue of like if they're gonna ban like 

383.07 391.81 B: satanic verses or something like that for like a high school or something like that i think that's more of like the subject topic 

391.95 392.76 A: (( uh-huh [mn] )) 

393.08 404.80 A: even with censorship let me let me say this though [sigh] even with censorship [mn] i mean if you go on the internet today you can find just about anything you want to find and it's not it's not real difficult to google search 

404.87 405.84 B: right 

405.99 415.01 A: [mn] so anyone who's has the ambition or the drive to just [sigh] try and find out what that is they'll [mn] they'll go and do the internet and see what it is 

414.38 417.28 B: [mn] then well people are gonna say for 

417.50 423.41 B: [mn] people are gonna be saying that they there's porno controls that they can't just go and you know 

423.45 424.95 B: just whatever they want to 

424.76 429.62 A: yeah but how many people do you actually know that use par- parental controls for high school students [sigh] no 

429.80 433.90 B: well i don't know not i don't know many but i mean i guess 

434.33 439.08 B: the argument would be that the schools would need something like that 

438.31 442.61 A: [sigh] well i mean school yeah but what's what do you do when a kid gets home 

442.30 448.19 B: well i guess that's where the parents come in and they that's what they're supposed to be doing their job doing that 

448.23 455.63 A: [sigh] uh-huh i mean you you're not you can't watch over your kid's shoulder [mn] i know i have kids you can't watch over your kid's shoulder twenty four seven 

455.65 457.25 B: yeah i agree 

455.96 458.78 A: (( yeah well search )) 

458.77 468.05 B: yeah i mean imagine if i was you know fifteen or sixteen i could probably you know go to a friend's house or find a way around it somehow you know 

468.73 469.61 B: (( you know )) 

469.98 474.77 A: (( yeah [mn] so wh- what it comes down to i think about it it's back to all the [sigh] you )) 

470.09 471.01 B: so 

474.83 482.43 A: know basically with even marijuana they say if you legalize marijuana that it won't it won't be a problem what do you think 

482.84 484.93 B: about the legalization of marijuana 

484.70 495.00 A: [mn] no no i mean [sigh] the the same premise that if you legalize marijuana there won't be so many uh problems societal problems as there are now mhm 

494.39 501.07 B: well it's i think the kids eventually one way or another are gonna run into these things whether it's in school or it's not [sigh] 

501.13 506.66 B: and at least in school you're gonna have an opportunity to explain the things to 'em or you know 

507.05 514.09 B: try to develop their own sense of themselves that they can reject or accept something that they wanna see 

514.38 523.06 A: so in so in high school you think that's okay to not do censorship oh i'm sorry or to let 'em do censorship 

514.66 515.93 B: (( so [mn] )) 

523.31 524.65 B: well i mean 

525.05 531.82 B: i don't think that it's proper [mn] to be like watching a porno in in a in a classroom you know in high school 

532.35 536.68 B: [sigh] obviously i would censor something like that [sigh] i just think 

536.82 545.60 B: [mn] my standard for censorship would have to be pretty low i mean the if there's something that has any kind of artistic value i'd probably let it in 

545.70 546.52 A: (( mhm )) 

547.85 550.40 A: [sigh] so you'd let in a book about playboy 

550.63 552.78 A: i'm just going on the age value now 

552.93 554.05 B: what's that 

553.46 557.25 A: i'm going on age you have to be like what eighteen or something 

556.48 558.13 B: yeah 

557.63 561.63 A: okay so they [mn] those kids in high school w- will not qualify 

561.83 563.01 B: (( yeah )) 

562.40 563.58 A: right [mn] 

563.25 568.24 B: [mn] i mean mostly i'm talking about books i'm talking about literature 

568.75 574.93 B: now you know [mn] if a book is you know describing a sex act or something i will probably let that in 

575.01 576.25 A: (( you're gonna let that in )) 

576.05 589.22 B: yeah i mean [sigh] a kid in high school if he doesn't know about sex i mean somewhere along the line whether it's through sex education and their parents or their friends [sigh] they're gonna know about it so why shouldn't they you know 

589.16 598.05 B: [sigh] you know be exposed to something that that sheds a different light on it than just kind of raunchy you know ludicrous work 

599.17 599.89 B: just raun- 

599.27 599.89 A: (( [mn] ))
