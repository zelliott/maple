0.28 2.33 A: hi i'm dustin cochrane 

2.26 4.40 B: [lipsmack] uh hi my name is glen 

4.85 5.98 A: hi glen 

5.91 7.13 B: (( h- how are you )) 

6.80 9.72 A: good do you wanna start 

8.63 11.05 B: good um sure okay 

10.73 15.22 A: [laughter] i've never did this before so [laughter] 

11.24 12.90 B: (( it's topic they gave )) 

13.19 17.81 B: oh [laughter] oh i'm an old hand this is uh the third time for me 

17.18 18.36 A: okay 

17.83 26.86 B: so um [lipsmack] yeah there's really uh no rules or anything there's nothing intrusive um you know just uh up to us to chat on the topic 

23.14 24.48 A: (( okay just )) 

26.42 27.58 A: okay just 

26.98 32.39 B: [laughter] and they have a little beep uh at the end of the ten minutes and uh you know that's about it 

31.92 33.43 A: sounds good 

32.81 42.98 B: so uh uh they picked a doozy for this time [laughter] uh how do you respond to a terrorist attack and how would people respond to a terrorist attack and all that would you panic 

35.15 36.31 A: right 

43.04 46.02 B: huh [laughter] it's a tough one [mn] 

43.17 44.24 A: [sigh] 

44.97 46.16 A: right 

46.03 47.84 B: i guess it depends um 

47.82 48.38 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

48.25 62.86 B: you know what it is and how close it is to you or to your loved ones [laughter] [laughter] i mean you know uh heaven forbid uh an atom bomb uh went off down the street i think i would panic yes [laughter] 

51.75 53.28 A: exactly 

59.54 63.51 A: yeah exactly might try to seek cover a little bit 

63.13 67.06 B: yeah right [laughter] try and uh 

63.57 64.58 A: [laughter] 

66.09 75.14 A: but i mean i'd i'd say that even if something on the scale of september eleventh happened again people would still be worried 

74.76 76.33 B: oh definitely 

75.74 89.14 A: and i mean just because for that fact probably any small terrorist attack people would probably just still freak out and it would probably have you know effects on the economy and everything again 

87.66 91.00 B: mhm yeah yeah 

91.43 100.07 B: i i agree with you and uh unfortunately i i don't think that uh we're as um safe from it as uh as we could be [laughter] 

99.07 112.53 A: [mn] yeah i personally agree with you there completely there's a lot more steps that could be done and there's also other things the government could be doing in my eyes you know to better protect 

101.58 102.71 B: yeah 

109.64 110.94 B: yeah 

113.36 114.59 B: (( mhm [cough] )) 

113.98 116.24 A: what kind of things do you think could be done 

116.61 123.87 B: uh well i- i- from i get the impression that uh that the borders are still pretty much like a sieve for one thing 

122.58 123.56 A: uh-huh 

123.93 132.73 A: well not just from terrorists but from you know people from mex- you know illegal immigrants and everything so 

124.02 125.09 B: (( uh )) 

126.31 128.09 B: not just from terrorists no 

129.79 131.00 B: right 

131.22 133.40 B: mhm yeah 

133.36 134.49 A: yeah 

133.83 142.41 B: yeah and uh you know even for their own safety you hear the stories about people that uh you know that were cooked to death in these horrible uh trucks that they're being smuggled in 

141.94 143.00 A: (( right [noise] )) 

142.55 150.48 B: um you know so it's not just not just for our protection but from a you know from a human compassion standpoint uh uh 

146.18 148.14 A: right exactly 

150.28 161.80 A: it's gotta be pretty bad on their their end to risk that you know to make it here so maybe at least have [sigh] some compassion for that [sigh] 

154.19 155.23 B: yeah 

155.67 156.55 B: yeah 

156.78 157.52 B: (( mm )) 

160.61 162.65 B: mhm yeah sure 

163.71 176.17 B: and uh i think the other the other thing that i've uh read recently about well two things i guess one is uh port cargo that's coming in in ships something like two two percent of the cargo 

173.26 174.08 A: okay 

176.16 179.74 B: containers are are are checked in any way you know so 

179.31 180.91 A: only two percent 

180.28 188.94 B: i think that's it yeah so you know the odds of someone being able to [laughter] smuggle something in on a cargo ship is is uh pretty good 

181.20 182.32 A: really 

188.19 190.57 A: right and then come pick it up later 

189.99 191.87 B: yeah uh-huh yeah 

191.21 192.73 A: yeah [sigh] 

192.17 200.15 B: and then the third is uh air cargo even you know they they take uh grandmothers from omaha i don't know where you're f- where where are you from by the way 

194.84 196.03 A: mhm 

199.41 200.72 A: i'm from ohio 

200.58 205.54 B: oh okay [laughter] i'm from near philadelphia um 

201.88 202.89 A: [laughter] 

203.72 204.56 A: okay 

205.38 217.59 B: [cough] but [cough] you know the the the across the board searches of every passenger kind of equally on the one hand uh you know down to making sure you don't have a nail file on you 

217.18 218.29 A: right 

217.62 231.00 B: on an airplane you know is [laughter] is on the one hand and then on the other hand um [lipsmack] uh there are cargo shippers you know where they put uh packages for companies on the same airline that we're being checked for a finger nail f- fi- filer 

229.35 230.31 A: mhm 

230.96 239.00 B: um there you know there there's [mn] unbelievably lax security for for um big packages that are going on those same planes 

238.60 240.00 A: (( right [noise] )) 

239.61 242.69 B: [sigh] so [laughter] we're still 

240.77 244.81 A: so there's a whole bunch of little holes that need to be filled all 

244.19 246.06 B: yeah yeah 

245.00 256.30 A: right [sigh] see but i mean personally i don't know where you come in on the side of the political spectrum but i feel that we could be doing something a little better 

246.32 247.63 B: (( yeah )) 

252.31 253.07 B: (( [sigh] mm )) 

256.36 257.49 A: um 

257.87 263.03 A: with our foreign relations at least in order to maybe 

259.64 261.33 B: mhm yeah 

263.25 273.36 A: you know take away the motivation for attacking us because i don't completely you know give in to the whole idea that they're just attacking us because of our freedom 

265.56 267.12 B: (( mhm uh-huh )) 

273.39 280.98 A: i mean i think it's also because we get you know ourselves involved into things that we possible shouldn't be getting ourselves involved in 

280.65 286.44 B: hm yeah it it yeah i guess there there might be some of that i w- i would not be surprised if 

286.47 296.93 B: you know corporate uh corporate selfish interests on some of the for example the oil companies i guess that that's an easy one to pick on [laughter] 

295.20 296.71 A: (( right )) 

296.75 308.79 A: well i mean just not even corporate interests um government in general just like policy things like that can easily you know sway 

301.32 302.57 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

304.14 304.86 B: yeah 

308.63 309.45 B: yeah 

308.83 312.40 A: public opinion in other countries you know against us 

310.71 312.41 B: (( mhm )) 

312.71 316.11 A: quite easily especially since we're such a big target to hate 

313.04 313.73 B: (( [mn] yeah [mn] )) 

315.83 322.58 B: right yeah i i don't think that in any way excuses uh they could hate our policies but 

316.89 317.98 A: it's almost 

322.14 323.08 A: right 

322.41 328.90 B: to to to in any way justify you know someone slamming a passenger plane into a 

328.57 330.10 A: right most definitely 

328.66 337.69 B: into a passenger building i mean there's absolutely no excuse for it even even if they are you know [laughter] upset at us for something i mean there are other ways to deal with it 

331.62 332.91 A: most definitely 

335.12 336.08 A: right 

337.32 345.54 A: right [laughter] but i mean from i guess i can see if you're coming from s- you know such a 

338.19 339.80 B: [laughter] 

345.63 346.98 A: sm- i don't know 

347.17 360.65 A: from someone from that sort of area would have you know very little means to you know affecting change and if they think that they can you know effect change in a larger way and also 

354.70 355.35 B: (( mm )) 

357.67 358.73 B: mhm 

360.43 370.36 A: get their reward in the afterlife that they believe they're going to get you know they're probably gonna think it's gonna be a good idea it's uh it's a lot of 

362.85 363.79 B: yeah 

365.74 366.87 B: (( [sigh] [lipsmack] )) 

367.39 367.98 B: (( [mn] )) 

370.41 374.70 A: you know difference in [mn] morality and 

373.87 376.45 B: oh definitely absolutely 

374.87 377.78 A: you know than we're used to you know 

376.77 378.72 B: mhm yep yeah yeah 

378.43 379.45 A: so 

379.72 381.71 B: it's a it's a tough situation 

381.31 383.95 A: right [sigh] 

382.68 385.87 B: [sigh] but uh uh yeah i 

385.90 392.72 B: we might be straying slightly from uh [laughter] the the the topic at hand but uh you know as far as 

387.89 390.32 A: [laughter] yeah a little bit 

391.38 399.43 A: and the general overall topic was terrorism so n- i'm not sure if they mind but uh 

394.60 396.56 B: right yeah 

397.03 397.80 B: (( uh uh-huh )) 

399.82 402.08 A: trying to get back on topic 

401.75 402.72 B: yeah 

402.10 403.34 A: i don't 

403.69 414.17 A: [sigh] i don't know about the overall effects i don't personally i don't think the next atta- the next terrorist will be as small as the last one 

413.79 415.36 B: as small really 

414.78 427.28 A: right i mean just i mean wi- just with everything you hear i mean with you know the proliferation proliferation of uh you know weapons of mass destruction around the world 

415.52 417.13 B: oh boy [laughter] mhm 

419.30 420.96 B: mhm 

427.15 428.24 B: yeah 

427.66 440.70 A: i mean something like i'd say sneaking in something like that especially with all the holes that me and you were talking about would be you know easier than training to fly a you know a plane full of passengers into a building 

432.95 435.37 B: mhm right 

437.84 439.12 B: mhm 

440.51 441.80 B: yeah 

440.75 454.20 A: i mean that's something pretty you know intricate so well but i might be underestimating you know how easy it'd be to get a weapon of mass destruction in the country but 

443.49 444.35 B: uh-huh 

445.13 446.71 B: (( yeah mm [lipsmack] [sigh] )) 

454.67 459.57 A: hopefully there's safeguards behind the scenes there that we don't know about 

455.66 457.09 B: [laughter] 

459.86 462.10 B: hopefully that would be nice 

460.70 464.27 A: hopefully right for all our sakes 

462.55 471.28 B: but unfortunately it always it always seems to be that uh things aren't fixed until a disaster happens even if there are people who are saying 

471.73 483.24 B: you know fix this it needs to be fixed but the way politics are you know they they don't wanna to to get out go out on a limb and invest all this money on something and then it doesn't happen and then 

474.08 474.94 A: right 

483.46 489.91 B: it's uh like we would they they wasted money because you know even if they prevented something i don't know 

489.52 490.83 A: right 

490.25 495.94 B: yeah i've gotten a little bit uh more cynical in my old age [laughter] about these things [laughter] 

492.68 494.69 A: (( [laughter] )) 

495.00 497.83 A: yeah you've seen the ways 

497.50 501.31 B: uh yeah [laughter] yeah yeah 

498.98 500.54 A: [sigh] 

501.09 509.49 A: yeah i mean and what you hear i mean like recently they're i don't know i was watching meet the press and they had a 

508.02 509.02 B: mhm 

509.52 512.54 A: former senator on that was talking about uh 

512.66 515.09 A: a study that he did about into 

515.05 519.04 A: you know our preparedness for another terrorist [noise] attack 

516.54 517.25 B: (( mm )) 

518.55 519.70 B: mhm 

518.90 531.03 A: and basically he says you know basically all of our emergency emergency management people are underfunded and they don't have the resources to deal with something like that 

524.93 525.82 B: mhm 

526.14 527.96 B: mhm exactly 

529.17 530.15 B: right 

530.53 531.56 B: yeah 

530.86 543.24 A: i mean and if uh we were hit in t- in like a location that you know probably doesn't have like the money you know to put something into it then it could especially something like a 

533.11 533.96 B: uh-huh 

535.17 536.90 B: mhm 

537.33 538.39 B: mhm 

539.39 540.44 B: right 

541.05 542.01 B: yeah 

543.34 547.07 A: biological weapon could you know spread across the [laughter] 

546.47 549.01 B: (( [sigh] mhm i uh-huh )) 

547.99 551.11 A: united states just because of ill preparedness [laughter] 

550.71 559.27 B: i i really don't don't get the the disconnect between uh what seems to me obvious priorities and even priorities that have been 

559.30 560.47 B: (( uh )) 

560.52 565.53 B: you know that have been talked about by our esteemed president although i'm not real crazy about 

563.75 564.66 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

565.53 577.37 B: uh in terms of the im- the importance of you know what's important is it important to give multi millionaires uh a big tax break or is it important to maybe use some of those funds to keep us from being blown up 

576.81 578.16 A: exactly 

577.61 578.85 B: [laughter] 

578.31 581.99 A: couldn't agree with you more i mean and even 

579.75 581.57 B: (( i just don't get it )) 

582.28 596.57 A: apparently everyone seeming to agree that we're a lot better off you know now with our prep- you know being able to stave off such a attack but i mean being better off sure isn't close to you know being able to stop it 

590.01 591.24 B: mhm 

594.96 595.76 B: (( mhm t- )) 

596.42 597.25 B: yeah 

596.43 599.89 A: and everyone pretty much agrees that we're we're never going to be a- 

597.56 598.58 B: uh-huh
