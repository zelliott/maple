62.09 68.38 B: i mean all the money you're gonna have you can buy friendship practically with that kind of money you know what i'm saying 

66.18 73.15 A: exactly and it would get me out it would get me out of a lot of debt i'm in i would be very happy for the million i could make new friends 

72.84 75.34 B: [noise] yeah that wouldn't stop 

73.29 79.16 A: the friends i have now aren't exactly friends that would go to great lengths for me so 

79.28 80.90 A: i definitely could 

81.76 86.33 A: take the million for that and move on it wouldn't really disturb me much at all 

86.13 90.89 B: no that wouldn't that wouldn't have no effect whatsoever for [noise] me 

89.89 93.66 A: i can't imagine people would say they wouldn't take the million wow 

93.46 95.97 B: yeah i mean why wouldn't you want to [noise] 

94.28 95.99 A: that would have to be a r- 

96.25 98.05 A: yeah that 

98.67 100.62 A: would have to be a really good friendship 

101.80 107.54 B: yeah well if it was someone you've known like all your life or 

107.71 110.60 B: i i don't know a close friend 

109.88 111.21 A: (( [noise] )) 

111.29 118.17 B: i don't know that i guess that'd be kind of difficult at times but i don't know if it was somebody i knew all my life 

115.70 116.82 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] hello )) 

117.88 119.59 A: exactly you know 

118.47 121.43 B: i wouldn't use that friend i'd use another friend you 

121.14 126.72 A: [laughter] yes 'cause it just says a best friend you could have more than one [laughter] 

122.04 124.15 B: (( know [laughter] )) 

125.88 129.32 B: that's right you can just pick and chose which friend you wanna use 

129.33 140.84 A: exactly i i don't know it depends how you look at it you know you could say that money is you know you're putting money over the value of friendship and but i really would just to be honest with you it's uh 

140.94 143.18 A: it would make life a lot easier for me 

143.45 145.22 B: yeah it would it would pay 

144.18 145.35 A: so i 

145.58 156.25 B: pay a lot of bills i could pay my mortgage off pay my car off i might not even have to work for a little while you know what i'm saying with all that money 

148.86 150.26 A: (( exactly )) 

153.90 155.43 A: right if you do 

155.62 159.18 A: if you do the right thing with it you can you know take a little 

157.75 159.89 B: live off the income 

159.19 172.82 A: you can take a little break from work um so i definitely would you know would do it i don't think i'd even think twice about it uh if i definitely had the option how i wish i did i would take it instantly i i wouldn't even think twice about it 

165.00 167.88 B: (( yeah )) 

172.30 183.24 B: no it wouldn't take me much thought [noise] i'd be saying where do i sign the papers give me the money and i'm off [laughter] 

174.71 175.54 A: no 

176.79 177.91 A: exactly 

178.98 192.97 A: right [laughter] exactly i just um you know i don't know i just feel the way things are nowadays with friendships they can easily go you know and you have nothing you know i have lost friends over minor things you know 

192.51 194.30 B: right 

192.92 196.53 A: small amounts of money that they've borrowed and not wanted to return 

196.43 198.78 B: yeah that's true 

196.56 198.53 A: and you know so 

198.58 206.17 A: i don't think if i don't know any more if there's really solid friendships any more i like to think of most of my so called friends as you know 

206.66 212.08 A: acquaintances someone who i talk to hang out with but i think if i really needed them for something 

207.84 209.14 B: (( right [sigh] )) 

212.43 219.91 A: to help me out with you know i don't know if they'd be there you know whenever i ask a friend to help me i usually pay them or give them something for doing it 

219.14 221.55 B: mhm 

220.17 222.87 A: so i don't think they're there for me you know 

222.83 228.92 B: and you stop and think about how many [noise] how many of your friends are really close friends 

228.87 243.73 A: exactly i really don't think they are i i and i look at all my friends and they're people i talked with on the phone i hang out with once in a while but you know they'll talk and tell me their problems but they're not necessarily always there to listen to mine um 

229.69 230.83 B: you know 

241.38 248.11 B: [noise] right and how much they'll trust you i mean if they borrow money from you and don't pay you back that's not a close friend 

246.38 247.51 A: right 

247.79 251.74 A: and i've lost two friends over that i mean we're talking like a hundred dollars 

251.73 263.72 B: yeah well i mean i i would side with you i don't i don't think that's right if you someone you trust is a close friend and they don't have the decency to pay you back their friendship isn't worth it you know 

251.80 252.77 A: (( you know what i mean )) 

257.63 258.76 A: (( exactly )) 

261.02 262.26 A: right 

262.83 273.37 A: well that's what i say because you know they're they're quick to ask but when it comes to returning it you don't see them for a while they're sort of hiding low you know and it's uncomfortable to have to ask for your own money 

270.26 271.60 B: right [noise] 

273.14 279.47 B: i know that's the worst thing that's why i try to make it a rule not to let anybody borrow money from me 

273.93 275.03 A: back 

275.72 276.64 A: (( yes )) 

278.94 289.31 A: even with people i'm dating i've had the same situation someone i was dating i loaned a thousand dollars and they didn't wanna pay it back they'd rather break up with me i'm not kidding 

283.84 286.00 B: mhm 

288.76 291.05 B: oh my god that's te- 

289.79 300.90 A: yeah i'm not kidding i swear they broke up with me if they c- well if we stay together can i keep the thousand i said no we'll break up and you'll give me the thousand and that's what actually did happen and i'm not kidding 

300.70 303.21 B: and they gave you the thousand 

302.10 304.52 A: (( yeah i got the thousand i was lucky to get it )) 

303.37 306.00 B: after but ha- you had to break up with him though 

305.43 307.79 A: yes and i had to fight very 

307.88 312.74 A: ferociously to get it back you know constant calling and threatening 

312.66 326.77 A: and so you know as i said friendships i think i don't know what they are nowadays but i don't think they're as solid as people like to think they are i think given the choice most people would chose the money or or you know rather than the friendship 

319.36 320.98 B: (( [sigh] [noise] )) 

323.55 326.47 B: (( right )) 

326.61 327.73 B: [noise] that's true 

327.00 336.89 A: 'cause a million dollars is it's a lot of money at least for me i'm just an average working guy and you know a million would last me great many of years i could pay off all my bills so 

331.52 333.25 B: right 

334.22 335.90 B: (( right )) 

337.24 339.33 B: take a trip maybe you know 

338.61 341.42 A: exactly relax a little bit you know 

339.90 344.89 B: be comfortable and live off the interest not have to worry about a nine to five job 

342.57 344.60 A: (( exactly )) 

344.68 352.08 A: i worked six um days for six years i used to work six days a week and it's just you know it's very tiring 

349.08 350.06 B: uh-huh 

351.56 353.64 B: oh yeah 

352.10 356.44 A: you know 'cause i was in a relationship and they passed away so you know when it came 

356.28 358.43 B: yeah it is 

356.74 361.78 A: and me i had to support the whole house and it's it's pretty difficult you know to do everything on your own 

359.93 361.60 B: yeah it can be 

362.05 363.93 B: yeah that's true 

363.18 368.75 A: 'cause it's just me you know so i have to the money would really give me a great amount of 

368.94 372.40 A: i don't know comfort you know i think it makes life less stressful 

372.45 375.19 A: to have the money so that would be uh 

375.91 377.02 A: something i'd 

375.98 386.30 B: [noise] i agree i definitely agree there's there's no problem with me because a friend is is not something that's stable and it's not something that's definite you know 

384.85 389.72 A: right exactly it could i mean relationships aren't definite so you know friendships 

389.55 391.33 B: yeah 

389.73 399.13 A: you know i i've been in a few that i thought were solid and you know they're just they'll slowly dissolve you know very quickly right under my eyes so 

393.20 395.06 B: they're not 

398.87 401.68 B: people come and go that's my philosophy 

400.96 402.97 A: they really do and you know 

401.69 411.33 B: they come and go in your life you know and you never see them again they think you're your friends then you don't hear from them it's like what happened to to so and so you know 

403.77 405.02 A: right 

405.82 406.91 A: right 

409.50 410.12 A: (( h- )) 

410.85 414.13 A: i mean i've been very hurt by that so that's why you know 

414.28 423.19 A: money would make things very uh good for me right now i [laughter] i have a lot of bills i owe and a lot of things you know to take care of so it's 

418.20 419.12 B: oh 

421.63 422.89 B: yeah 

423.29 425.95 A: it would just make things so much more comfortable 

423.47 424.39 B: (( [noise] )) 

425.91 438.82 B: yeah i wanna pay my house off that's my goal is to do that oh yeah i have a friend in new york that said he can't afford a house he lives in an apartment he said he just cannot afford to buy a house in new york

437.44 444.33 A: right i mean i pay a thousand a month for my apartment which isn't a lot considering i'm in queens i'm outside of manhattan

444.53 445.43 A: but

494.24 496.14 A: just disappeared 

496.38 497.14 A: 'cause 

498.29 505.54 A: i mean and we were really close friends i mean we hung out almost every day and he just never even a phone call he just 

505.46 508.20 B: and you haven't heard from him in five years

511.90 524.91 A: [laughter] well yeah i know but i i'll tell you i knew him a good ten years and i was like wow you know you think sometimes i i guess you just have to look at the boundaries of a friendship and what it really is 

512.70 514.99 B: wouldn't you i mean really 

515.01 516.42 B: to totally just 

524.50 531.55 B: but i mean to leave you and not say a word for five years after he left you not even a call or a letter you know 

525.30 526.02 A: uh 

528.31 530.24 A: yeah exactly a- 

530.89 539.99 A: nothing and even this girl he lived with for two years the same thing she never heard from him again either and you know she often asked me 'cause she lived in my area have you heard from john

547.78 549.51 B: yeah 

554.06 561.29 A: [laughter] like every time he'd be too busy or something so i i think it was kind of leading up at that point which was just before he left and i hadn't heard from 

560.93 566.39 B: [noise] sounds like he wanted to get away from new york and leave that life behind uh-huh 

561.36 562.24 A: (( him so )) 

564.16 575.78 A: yes exactly because you know when he used to come back i could see we'd start to get close again and when it came time for him to leave to go home he'd be very cold i mean it would be just a handshake 

573.56 577.15 B: really oh really 

575.66 583.81 A: and he'd leave and he wouldn't even look back so it was that's kind of what i felt you know that he was putting that behind him you know he just didn't want any more
