0.00 0.79 B: matt 

0.77 1.90 A: ian 

3.35 4.23 B: hello 

4.28 5.27 A: hey matt 

4.98 8.70 B: hey how you doing that's good 

6.07 10.56 A: good uh [sigh] so smoking huh [laughter] 

9.71 11.90 B: yeah you a smoker [noise] 

11.25 16.19 A: uh well actually recently quit for uh the most successful attempt yet 

16.33 19.28 B: really so how long has it has it been since you had one 

17.10 18.06 A: yeah 

19.29 24.21 A: [lipsmack] well it's been uh about two and a half months um 

24.36 30.12 A: but the difference this time is my cravings really aren't there like i think i was really ready to quit this time [mn] 

29.82 33.67 B: okay did you do it yourself or were you in some program 

32.86 43.67 A: well i've tried uh a number of different methods i started smoking like pretty early when i was fifteen i'm twenty three now and i tried to quit after my second year about once a year 

43.61 56.35 A: and uh i'd stay quit for anywhere from a month to four months using different stuff like i've i did the first time with willpower and second times uh with patches and gum and this time i tried the new lozenges they have and i found that those worked really well [lipsmack] 

55.76 57.87 B: there's like nicotine in lozenges 

57.95 72.14 A: yeah they're basically the same thing as the gum in that you put it in your mouth and sort of leave it there for thirty minutes but i think because you sort of like have it in your mouth and you're sucking on it gives you more stimulation 'cause you don't chew nicotine gum you know you just chew it once and you park it in your mouth 

67.42 69.27 B: yeah 

71.93 74.20 B: yeah and it just kinda sits in there [laughter] 

73.82 80.95 A: and [lipsmack] yeah so this gives you something to do with your mouth and uh as long as you find other stuff to do with your hands [laughter] it's it's fine 

80.69 92.00 B: yeah i suppose yeah i i started smoking about a year ago um i've been with a girl for about three years and she was a smoker and and she finally uh corrupted me i guess you could say so uh 

87.53 88.43 A: uh-huh 

91.08 92.83 A: yeah 

92.17 93.94 B: yeah 

92.98 98.11 A: well yeah my whole family smokes um and it's something that you know i never 

97.05 99.09 B: well you grew up with it then i suppose 

99.12 100.15 A: what's that 

99.62 102.12 B: you you grew up with a family of smokers then 

101.61 108.67 A: yeah and i really i hated it for you know a good good period until about when i turned fifteen and all my friends were doing it you know 

108.70 109.67 B: (( yeah i )) 

108.90 115.27 A: um and i you know it's the that's the classic and and sort of lame reason to do it but it it affects you you know [mn] 

114.66 117.24 B: yeah i i mean it doesn't uh 

117.59 123.16 B: doesn't uh really give you with much of a choice you know if everyone else around you is doing it 

122.15 123.48 A: yeah 

123.50 127.60 B: but um i don't know i haven't even i haven't really tried to quit um 

127.61 133.66 B: i mean i don't i don't do it very much i have less than a a pack a day probably one every other day or so so 

132.62 141.12 A: yeah my yeah my whole um real motivation for having to quit altogether is that i can't really smoke in moderation 

141.14 142.97 B: yeah 

141.68 146.11 A: and i suppose if i could you know then i'd smoke for you know whoever knows how long but [sigh] 

146.38 150.64 A: i uh i'm either a sort of a pack or more a day or nothing uh 

149.56 153.22 B: so you just get started and then you can't stop 

152.65 158.11 A: yeah i think i just uh i enjoy it more than most people [laughter] you know i know people 

156.16 157.95 B: yeah 

158.15 163.82 A: who um did it to be cool and then never really like it and now they do it you know when they're drinking or whatever but i 

162.91 164.69 B: yeah 

164.13 168.10 A: uh i do it whenever whenever i can you know i do it 

166.88 174.02 B: yeah mine isn't really habitual though either i mean i enjoy it and you know i'd i i'd say at this point i don't even really wanna quit so 

173.68 175.12 A: yeah well 

174.54 175.49 B: i mean if 

175.48 179.71 A: a i don't think you should quit unless you you really want to and b. 

179.74 180.78 A: um 

180.80 191.31 A: i i think unless it's habitual you won't have a problem quitting with me i do it you know i- it it affects something when you have a habit you know your reward system in your brain 

184.05 185.86 B: yeah 

190.97 192.78 B: yeah 

191.55 195.43 A: and uh i really had that in tune it basically whenever i 

195.41 206.66 A: if i took like a test back in school and i got you know if i thought i did well i'd have a cigarette if i thought i did bad i'd have a cigarette you know it was just kind of a way to mark time almost you know 

201.73 202.92 B: [laughter] 

205.42 207.60 B: yeah i'd see that 

206.74 214.42 A: [lipsmack] and uh yeah it just depends you know i mean like i'd see someone smoking and i'd wanna smoke right then even if they weren't with me necessarily 

214.05 222.94 B: yeah i got a problem with that like seeing people on t._v. and the movies you know and they they spark up and then i just wanna [laughter] go out and have one myself 

220.68 227.10 A: oh yeah and then then i sort of feel that you know there's there's maybe some strategy behind that too 

226.79 231.64 B: yeah a little bit um so uh where are you located 

231.04 235.48 A: [lipsmack] well right now i live uh on long island i'm about to move to brooklyn in a week 

235.23 240.90 B: okay do you guys have a lot of bans for for smoking in public places out there 

236.01 237.24 A: uh i'm fr- 

239.97 243.42 A: well you know about the bloomberg laws in new york right 

242.74 245.67 B: uh no i'm i'm nowhere near there 

244.81 246.16 A: where are you from 

245.68 252.40 B: i'm in the midwest here i'm in duluth minnesota and they're uh they've started banning uh is that what they're called the bloomberg laws 

248.50 249.46 A: yeah 

252.31 264.03 A: yeah um it's after the mayor you know and uh they just banned it everywhere in the city and uh it's crazy because everyone who'd normally be in bars smoking is out in the street 

253.06 253.93 B: um 

257.83 258.78 B: really 

264.18 272.85 B: yeah that's pretty much the same deal here that there's maybe one or two um indoor uh like restaurant type establishments where you can uh 

272.77 282.31 B: actually smoke inside and everywhere else is it's it's been uh it's been banned in public places and it's really a shame here because this is like a tourist kind of town 

282.38 297.97 B: and you know a lot of the older folks and tourists and stuff you know come here and they're kind of counting on being able to smoke indoors and and they're afraid it's gonna ruin the local economy because people aren't gonna wanna patronize the facilities if they can't uh if they can't smoke in 'em 

288.97 290.05 A: yeah 

295.35 296.41 A: yeah 

296.98 309.45 A: oh definitely you know it's funny i actually spent i spent a lot of time in chicago i even lived there for a while and uh and sort of north north illinois and right i just noticed how acceptable it is there 

309.73 310.64 A: (( um are )) 

311.14 312.25 A: you still there 

311.82 312.92 B: (( yeah )) 

312.39 316.06 A: yeah i noticed how acceptable it is there and um 

315.85 330.70 A: i also my family moved to virginia and there you know it's it's right near all the major cigarette companies and cigarettes not only are like two dollars a pack but you can smoke inside everywhere there too so it's really foreign to me coming here and having these laws um 

330.68 334.06 A: but also cigarettes are ten dollars a pack here [laughter] 

332.02 335.61 B: yeah oh really 

334.34 337.24 A: which is a great reason to quit [laughter] 

336.55 338.17 B: that's horrible 

337.78 339.73 A: yeah i mean like 

338.47 350.06 B: i mean i've spent as much as four on a pack around here but man have you tried or- well i suppose you've quit now but i don't know i've found some places online where you can get a whole carton of of 

342.87 343.83 A: yeah 

348.59 352.88 A: yeah smoke dot com that kind of stuff yeah [mn] 

350.04 356.04 B: yeah yeah so uh if you don't mind waiting a week to get a carton of smokes then 

355.76 356.76 A: yeah 

356.24 359.61 B: then i guess that's for you but uh it's full of shit you know if 

359.64 366.55 B: if smokes were ten bucks a pack here i'd probably quit too that's ridiculous or at least cut down a lot 

363.31 365.59 A: yeah especially like you know you know just 

366.12 377.97 A: [laughter] yeah and uh i don't know like honestly i don't at all mind it that's the thing i think if you've ever smoked you should be able to understand why other people smoke 

377.32 387.69 B: yeah i mean i've i've never even before i smoked been too critical about people doing it you know it it doesn't affect me much and you know it's something to do i guess 

378.48 379.45 A: and 

384.42 386.27 A: yeah i 

387.48 395.52 A: yeah i mean i always thought it really irritating when people make a big deal out of me smoking you know it's one thing if you're sitting next to 'em in like a car with its windows closed but 

394.90 409.85 B: yeah or i don't know if a woman's like pregnant or something like that but you know they i think it should be more the responsibility for the people who don't wanna be around smoke to have to make it their responsibility to you know not go where smoky places could be 

396.03 397.04 A: (( i don't know )) 

398.60 399.90 A: yeah 

409.59 410.47 A: right 

409.85 414.23 B: and and not so much the burden on the on the smoker who you know i mean 

415.08 426.19 B: i i suppose you could kind of trade off either way but you know it's it's it's tough on both ends you know and and it's really tough for businesses particularly you know bars and restaurants when they gotta tell their 

415.29 416.16 A: yeah 

426.16 440.83 B: their uh regular smoking customers that you know they'll have to step outside and and here in duluth you know we get really cold winters and such and i i suppose it it can tend to get cold and rainy where you are too and you know a lot of people just don't wanna step outside to do that so 

439.74 449.02 A: right i think it's also in the nature of most people even people i notice who smoke casually like only when they're drinking for example it's it's sort of like a sit down and relax thing 

448.29 450.04 B: yeah 

449.10 449.98 A: um 

450.18 454.53 A: you know honestly it's uh i think it's better to have it be that way 

454.25 456.10 B: yeah 

455.03 455.97 A: (( so mm )) 

456.26 470.89 B: oh yeah i mean it i suppose there's different types of smokers as far as that goes and i mean i'm not the one to who absolutely has to have one all the time but you know i do like to settle down and casually have a smoke with some friends you know and drink and such and it would just be nice if 

468.44 469.45 A: yeah 

470.79 478.30 B: if it wasn't uh outlawed to smoke indoors here and it's it's really cutting down on the smokers going out and uh 

478.35 480.14 B: putting money out into the town 

480.23 482.29 A: [noise] yeah i mean 

480.33 481.64 B: (( so i )) 

481.93 484.98 B: think they're the ones really suffering the businesses 

482.63 484.98 A: i think i think eventually you know 

485.04 486.07 A: after 

486.17 491.76 A: ten or so years it'd probably be in anyone's interest to quit but um i think you know 

489.19 490.99 B: yeah 

491.82 498.00 A: if you look around like everybody over the age of forty has probably had a smoking habit for at least a little while 

497.47 499.43 B: oh yeah 

498.31 506.53 A: just 'cause of you know information and although we know more about it now it's not really gonna change its appeal to a certain age group you know 

505.90 507.73 B: right 

506.75 510.38 A: i mean just young people tend to s- i don't know how old you are but 

509.70 511.41 B: i'm twenty three 

510.97 516.40 A: oh that's my age yeah so um yeah young people i think tend to smoke uh [laughter] 

511.76 513.44 B: yeah 

516.29 529.90 B: yeah i didn't really fall into that crowd growing up you know and they they say that they try and sucker 'em young i pretty much fought through that i i just been doing it lately 'cause i'm in college and i'm i'm kinda hitting my last few years and getting really stressed and just kinda 

516.47 517.66 A: (( and mm )) 

529.25 531.66 A: yeah where do you go to college 

529.91 534.68 B: you know something i can kind of relax a b- i go to the university of minnesota in duluth 

534.54 541.36 A: cool yeah i just got out of college and actually that was sal- sort of a big motivating factor 'cause um 

535.19 536.88 B: yeah 

540.25 545.45 B: yeah well it seems everyone here on campus smokes too it's crazy 

541.71 543.51 A: i don't know i moved out of college 

545.35 551.67 A: oh yeah and like on college i don't know i'd just be like if i wanted a cigarette i could get one 'cause i knew so many people 

551.09 552.88 B: yeah 

551.48 565.14 A: you know so even when i was quitting i it'd be really hard and now i i live uh right right now my girlfriend and i live together in her grandma's place and her grandma's eighty five and i just think it's like it's i don't wanna smoke in front of her you know and 

563.62 567.86 B: yeah it's a it's kind of like like when i go home around uh 

567.84 581.99 B: my uh elder relatives and stuff i'm kind of ashamed to do it in front of 'em i don't know if it's if it's not like a sign of failure but you know i just kinda try and keep it to myself so i don't know if maybe moving back home that would kinda help me to quit too because 

578.33 579.44 A: yeah 

580.03 584.49 A: [laughter] well no one's gonna congratulate you you know [laughter] 

583.38 591.36 B: yeah that's for sure so you you said that you've pretty much been able to uh cut out the smoking on your own or 

584.89 585.93 A: but uh 

585.94 586.97 A: (( i don't know i )) 

591.26 599.33 B: for this last time or did do any of these programs that they're advertising for i i i haven't tried 'em and i don't know some of 'em look like they might work 

592.92 594.27 A: well no this 

597.37 598.55 A: you mean like 

599.01 599.89 A: you mean inner per-
