0.56 1.68 A: hello 

1.02 3.28 B: hello my name is andy 

2.64 4.00 A: my name's nick 

3.77 5.66 B: i'm from pittsburgh pennsylvania 

5.07 7.74 A: and i'm from atco new jersey 

7.44 8.72 B: what part 

8.17 10.91 A: atco it's in the southern part of the state 

10.30 12.00 B: uh near cape may maybe [noise] 

11.69 17.17 A: uh not quite that far south uh in between uh philadelphia and atlantic city 

16.86 20.29 B: okay i've got a sister who lives out there in vincentown [noise] 

19.67 25.95 A: oh yeah vincentown is uh i'm in what's called camden county she's in burlington county but we're i'm right near the line 

25.55 37.42 B: they used to live in haddonfield okay drury hill and all that stuff anyway we're supposed to talk about time travel and whether or if we'd go back in time they they they didn't say whether the time travel was possible that's what i thought would be more of an interesting discussion 

26.74 28.94 A: okay yeah we've got a 

29.11 30.16 A: (( uh you know )) 

36.81 38.15 A: right 

37.72 41.60 B: but whether uh whether or not would you like to go back and change something 

41.75 43.60 B: if it was possible i guess 

43.34 49.46 A: i guess that's that's the assumption you're supposed to make if it's possible would you do it maybe why would you do it or what would you do 

49.37 51.02 B: (( mhm )) 

50.44 64.64 A: and uh i don't know whether i don't know whether i would or not because uh i think uh if you if it were possible to do time travel i would probably do time travel just because i would like to go back and see some people who are no longer with us and and and and 

53.99 55.22 B: mhm 

62.71 65.01 B: mhm would you really 

64.77 75.74 A: yeah and and talk to them a little just uh like i'd like to talk to my father one more time i don't have any regrets over having never said anything to him but i just would like to speak to him one more time 

65.34 66.14 B: mhm 

69.74 70.77 B: (( mhm )) 

71.96 72.80 B: mhm 

75.15 80.75 B: mhm i thought of that too yeah but i wonder i wonder what it would be like if we actually had the opportunity 

76.51 77.71 A: you know and uh 

80.88 84.19 B: uh because you'd have to do you'd have they'd have to die all over again 

84.76 99.50 A: uh well i guess yeah that would be that would be a that that would be a downside to it i i guess i'm assuming of time travel and uh being of things like you see in movies and stuff where you're there for a couple of minutes and you leave them i'm thinking maybe i hop into a capsule and i go back twenty years and 

85.92 87.61 B: (( but understand )) 

88.43 89.30 B: (( could )) 

90.23 90.97 B: yeah 

98.87 100.22 B: (( mhm mm )) 

99.56 100.57 A: just say 

100.64 103.70 A: thanks again and then i'm in the time capsule and gone 

103.38 107.70 B: mhm yeah yeah if you if it's automatic and you you have no choice like it just shut off from 

103.79 105.26 A: and not around for 

107.05 108.77 A: yeah but uh 

108.56 110.64 B: you but i i think we can time travel 

110.66 116.42 B: really now in a sense visually because you can see stars a hundred and eighty million light years away and 

116.14 122.57 A: that's a good point i never thought of it but that's actually time travel you're actually looking at at a time that isn't isn't now really 

121.92 126.46 B: a- and everything we look at from from from even i can see the university of pittsburgh from my window 

126.54 135.98 B: i uh the light i'm seeing is in the past in the past because i'm not seeing it right now because it the light hasn't that light beam hasn't reached my eyeball 

134.50 137.95 A: yeah has to has to travel to you for a while yeah that's that's 

136.73 146.01 B: yeah future future now's a different thing uh some some people even believe that's possible but i think you know i don't know especially but to go back and change something [noise] 

146.04 150.64 B: uh [sigh] well there are a lot of mistakes in my life [sigh] 

150.95 151.73 B: (( one of )) 

151.00 157.72 A: i think that i made a lot of mistakes too but i think that makes it part of what you are so i don't know if you would want to change if i would want to change any of those 

154.43 155.47 B: (( yeah uh )) 

156.58 162.32 B: yeah what would happen if you did i mean uh the it would change it would be like uh every- all these dominoes 

162.60 170.32 B: this happened because this happened this negative happened because this positive thing happened and if you change this one thing what just happens to everything else that's positive 

168.85 173.87 A: exactly yeah i i can't think of anyone of particular event that uh i would 

173.97 182.29 A: i would wa- i would i would want to change because it would change so many other things i don't see how you could just pick one thing say i'll change that outcome of that 

180.37 181.09 B: (( [noise] )) 

181.02 190.26 B: so i think it's possible to go back in time if you have a goo- big good enough telescope and if you're able to look at yourself from a distance how that would be possible i don't know 

190.18 201.50 B: but um uh and stephen hawking's talked about it physicists have argued about this for a while and and they used the analogy of pool balls going in the same pocket two pool balls 

201.72 208.82 B: and you know uh we're subject to time and mo- time is relative to motivity how you move uh everything's moving 

208.99 218.56 B: uh and every m- step i take i'm taking a step into the present then the past is there [laughter] already so 

215.55 217.62 A: the past is still there yeah that's 

217.69 222.60 A: i've got to say i haven't really spent a whole lot of time thinking about matters like that uh 

220.41 221.39 B: yeah 

221.58 229.30 B: i i i thought of it because i you know you watch the ti- twilight zone and all these kind of weird shows that talk about this or movies about it and you always ask yourself 

229.44 232.76 B: some place in time when there goes one romantic thing uh it 

233.00 242.67 B: how could you physically go back in time with flesh and bone and how would it be possible you know i don't know but if if you could hypothetically speaking 

242.70 243.69 A: (( it [cough] [cough] )) 

242.81 252.34 B: i would uh think it there was this twilight zone i remember with gig young he went back as a as a man like you and i i assume you're about my age i'm fifty five you might be younger than me 

251.69 253.17 A: right on the nose yep 

252.57 254.26 B: okay forty eight we're born 

254.49 257.77 B: and so uh at least i was may twelfth 

257.87 266.63 B: and so he came he went back and and saw the same um he was despondent about his life and went back and saw the same 

266.64 272.83 B: you know the soda fountain and uh of course he you know and uh gig gig young's dead now i think he committed suicide or something 

271.11 271.86 A: right 

272.93 274.17 B: right but he um 

274.63 284.85 B: went and saw his mother and his dad and saw himself on the merry go round and saw where he cut his finger some kind of accident he had and he was trying to make contact with these people 

284.89 286.51 B: and he realized 

286.71 289.20 B: that they were looking at him like he was a madman 

289.27 297.05 B: finally he com- he plea he told his dad all these things that only he would know and he said his dad took him aside and said look this isn't your time now 

297.19 300.99 B: it's his time that boy's time and it's 

301.09 302.00 A: (( [noise] )) 

301.23 303.50 B: kind of a sad sad but true so 

302.47 305.51 A: [cough] [cough] yeah that's pretty interesting i my 

304.52 308.03 B: and yeah the little boy you would interfere with his you would interfere with his um 

308.55 310.28 B: what would you do take a you know 

308.68 309.24 A: (( [mn] )) 

310.30 313.90 B: uh i- it would be it would freak them out 

313.59 322.36 A: yeah that's a uh that's why i actually think i wouldn't if i could travel back in time it would just be to see somebody you know that i that i haven't 

319.10 320.19 B: to observe 

323.62 326.01 B: would you want to talk to them or just look at them 

323.96 324.52 A: (( [cough] )) 

325.44 327.56 A: no i'd i'd i'd want to 

327.79 332.92 A: talk to them but i wouldn't want to change anything or do anything that would change how things would come out 

331.82 333.47 B: would you tell them who you were 

333.70 336.00 A: yeah i think i would tell them who i was [cough] 

335.75 337.94 B: would they believe you would they believe you 

338.69 339.45 B: (( [noise] )) 

338.71 340.96 A: [cough] well i think if you if you 

341.43 344.63 A: [noise] accept the fact that you're going to be able to travel back in time 

343.86 345.04 B: (( [noise] right )) 

345.06 355.95 A: then i think you have to assume that the places and people that you're traveling back to are going to accept the fact that you could have done that not like the situation that you're talking about on the television where the guy 

355.61 357.41 B: mhm 

356.44 357.03 A: (( [cough] )) 

357.22 360.47 A: excuse me says don't say anything to that little kid 'cause it's his time 

359.85 366.95 B: uh you're setting you're setting up the scenario that these people know you're coming and they're they're aware that you're coming and they're they're going to greet you 

364.49 365.26 A: [cough] 

366.96 367.91 A: yes 

367.39 368.93 B: okay all they 

368.10 373.81 A: yeah that's that's what i i that's how i would envision being able to go back in time and talking to somebody 

373.22 379.29 B: and how would they be uh i mean this this is kind of cruel of me but uh how would they be informed by whom and how 

377.52 378.08 A: (( [cough] )) 

379.72 388.77 A: uh well i'm assuming that if this time travel was was event- was possible then it it would be like general knowledge that this type of thing could occur 

384.05 385.77 B: (( yeah how um )) 

388.44 389.37 B: (( okay uh-huh )) 

388.97 395.31 A: so that somebody could show up from the from the past or from the future and and talk about their pa- you know their past [cough] 

392.63 393.53 B: mhm 

394.16 401.62 B: yeah but there wouldn't you do i mean aside from all the uh this wonderful dream we have of when we when we see this person or that person wouldn't you think 

395.95 396.68 A: [cough] 

401.83 406.75 B: rationally speaking if it was possible wouldn't it mess things up 

407.35 409.17 B: all over the place you know we'd be 

408.28 410.18 A: well i don't 

410.27 418.18 A: no i don't think so i i i mean as long as you didn't change events uh you know didn't tell warn somebody don't do this or don't do that or something like that 

416.65 417.21 B: (( [mn] )) 

417.60 419.31 B: ye- yeah 

418.28 420.43 A: i think if you just um [noise] 

419.77 423.27 B: well even if you changed things emotionally don't you think that could have a 

420.59 421.23 A: (( [cough] )) 

424.00 429.85 B: repercussions down the road like if you throw a pebble in the stream you won- i wonder i don't know just just throwing that out there 

429.38 435.30 A: [cough] yeah well i i think if you physically change something or you get somebody to do something differently 

430.25 431.66 B: just throwing it out mhm 

435.88 444.54 B: it's like someone said to me one time well uh er i believe in the free will someone said i said well i don't know if i do or not i think i believe in both absolute free will and absolute 

435.96 437.33 A: but i'm mostly 

444.75 446.29 B: absolute um 

446.36 454.92 B: uh no free will the same guy said well how can you believe in the in both of them well i think both are true relative speaking relatively speaking 

447.62 448.56 A: mhm 

455.35 461.76 B: you know if you if the part that buddha said of the past if you want to look at know your pr- present look at your past if 

461.85 463.46 B: (( you want to know your future )) 

461.88 466.06 A: no way a lot of people say that the past is prologue you know [cough] 

465.11 478.10 B: yeah weave the pa the present and the past weave the future so uh this has been argued for centuries but you know relative to god if god exists god has to be perfect therefore he's not he's not god uh time does not exist for him 

469.95 471.33 A: (( [noise] )) 

478.08 490.19 B: uh so he sees the whole train the caboose the engine everything you know so so i wonder how much is really set in motion how much free will we've really really got and if we can go back in time what it would do 

480.08 481.66 A: (( [noise] )) 

490.29 502.93 B: i don't know but it's like i mean i certainly would like to and i would certainly uh ch- if i had to live my life over again let's just put it that way if i was taken back and and uh somehow was able to do it again 

503.14 510.35 B: oh man would i make some changes not so relative so much money so much but i would just be kinder and and uh 

509.14 522.61 A: well see i think um i don't think that i would change that although i i think i wish i had been kinder and stuff to people but i think that makes you the person that you are the whole that whole learning process of you know at this point in my life i see things differently than i saw when 

514.48 516.12 B: yeah 

516.57 518.11 B: yeah 

518.65 519.74 B: yeah 

521.94 529.82 B: yeah right no you that's right maybe that's why we have two eyes in front of our head otherwise god would put one in front one in the back [laughter] 

522.79 524.26 A: thirty years ago 

526.84 532.24 A: one in the back [laughter] that's uh that's why if i could do the time travel business i wouldn't [noise] 

531.93 532.79 B: uh-huh 

532.26 539.87 A: do it to go back and start over and say pick a different profession or or go to to a different place or know a different person or anything it would just be 

534.29 535.09 B: uh 

535.61 536.52 B: (( uh )) 

537.68 538.59 B: right 

538.68 539.80 B: mhm 

540.02 547.08 A: just because i have a desire to see some people that i talked to some persons that i have never had but i 

546.15 554.73 B: wouldn't it be fascinating to know that you actually do that and see if you uh and question you after you did it if you were as as as happy about it after you did it than if 

554.49 555.72 A: (( y- yeah )) 

554.76 562.64 B: now you can't do that but it would be interesting to look at or or would you long to do it again would it be like eating one potato chip you had to you 

558.17 558.87 A: but 

563.22 564.29 B: know when it 

563.41 573.10 A: oh yeah i think that would be a problem i think that would be a problem that one one if you only had one bite at that apple i think if this was a possibility it would be something you'd want to do a whole lot 

569.77 570.78 B: (( uh )) 

572.46 581.71 B: it's like an old romance going back to an old girlfriend i mean i had a couple of girls tear my heart out [laughter] i would want to go back and but i would relive all that pain again [laughter] 

573.93 574.49 A: (( [cough] )) 

577.12 578.10 A: (( yeah )) 

580.24 585.24 A: [laughter] well yeah so we go back to the good times you don't do back to the for the bad time of it 

582.85 583.85 B: yeah 

584.80 585.56 B: (( um )) 

585.48 586.19 A: (( [cough] )) 

586.42 588.32 A: excuse me [noise] i want 

587.62 590.28 B: y- you selectively scr- pick only the good huh 

589.95 595.70 A: yeah only good you know then then they're like or it could be another facet of this if you could go back just as an observer 

594.63 596.34 B: uh-huh mhm 

595.77 599.89 A: if you would go ba- i would go back to see some different events in history see exactly like i
