0.35 1.50 B: hi 

1.51 2.59 A: (( hi )) 

2.50 4.89 B: hi my name's hal what's your name 

4.39 5.38 A: chuck 

5.41 6.82 B: (( hi what's going on oh )) 

6.63 13.81 A: not much now did they day [noise] should they be allowed to force them to read a book or not to read a book [noise] [mn] 

12.33 16.02 B: um i was going to ask you the same thing but wh- 

14.30 20.35 A: sh- i guess i should assume uh it was to read a book i 

19.56 22.47 B: yeah th- should they force them to be able to read a book it 

22.59 26.57 A: don't know i mean i think if it's it can be assigned you know 

26.90 39.02 A: it can be assigned material e- even you did i i think you should you know if you're if you're forced to read a book for a material for a class i don't see a problem with that 

29.56 30.62 B: can be what 

36.37 40.39 B: yeah i mean obviously they have some vested interest in what 

40.41 44.30 B: what types of books should be are to be included in a curriculum 

44.25 52.37 A: right i mean otherwise how are you going to get the message to the class across i guess [noise] i guess what they're you know the question of the of the uh 

52.55 60.48 A: the real question is should you you be forced to read a book to which you wouldn't agree to be uh position maybe religious or uh political 

60.60 61.85 B: yeah is it 

60.90 63.76 A: i [mn] yeah 

62.54 69.34 B: how does that affect your freedom of speech by s- being like [mn] being able to say no to something 

69.94 76.92 A: yeah that's that's a good point of looking at it too although i mean i i don't think you really form an opinion without having an objective look at the opposite opinion 

77.34 78.24 A: (( you know )) 

78.28 89.38 A: it's the if you you know if you're if you're a republican you should be at least a little bit familiar with uh the ideology of democrats you know so i don't know i think you know 

78.43 79.30 B: yeah 

85.99 87.29 B: yeah 

89.45 91.92 A: for- forcing is one word uh 

92.00 97.09 A: you know there's really that's about freedom of speech though you can turn it around [laughter] however you wanted to 

97.49 99.27 A: but uh you know the first 

99.50 107.69 A: protect speech that we like is to protect speech we don't like as well but who knows [laughter] 

103.27 104.63 B: mhm 

105.79 108.87 B: but they also has the mention uh public and private schools 

109.73 113.38 B: so i think a private school has more of a 

113.61 121.23 B: like more of a say in what they can tell people to read 'cause it's you are choosing to go there then they want to get that out of it 

114.79 118.46 A: (( right )) 

121.75 126.58 A: [lipsmack] right right [noise] [cough] yeah i just you know 

122.45 123.31 B: (( you know )) 

126.62 134.39 A: i i guess you know maybe i don't know i i think it really much has to do with r- r- religion at the forefront you know 

134.16 145.46 A: at private schools [noise] can do both ways on that they i guess they can forbid some sort some sort of religious uh 'specially if it's a religious school they could force you to read a bible or they could force you not to read 

142.39 143.29 B: yeah 

145.66 147.45 A: (( you know the torah or the koran )) 

147.19 149.51 B: (( mm )) 

148.00 152.77 A: i don't know it's ki- kinda spooky i guess you know you have the right to read whatever you want to but also 

152.85 157.93 A: you know if if if it's required reading i don't see a problem with that either yeah 

157.05 157.93 B: yeah 

159.13 162.29 B: i think people should read everything 

159.90 164.09 A: that's 

162.56 163.46 B: so 

164.26 166.58 B: that's my personal opinion on it 

166.89 176.74 A: a good i mean that's a good point you sh- you know we can't really decide what you can't read i i guess it'd be more uh engaging topic if they said you can't read something you know 

176.75 177.69 B: yeah 

178.17 179.52 A: because that way 

179.91 188.69 A: [laughter] with with that that would be that'd be like pushing the buttons of every you know little kid in all of us you know and they said i can't read it i'm going to [laughter] read it twice now you know 

188.53 195.87 A: but [cough] so what part of the country are you in 

188.95 190.30 B: mhm 

196.31 197.67 B: (( 'cuse me )) 

197.14 198.88 A: what part of the country are you in 

198.68 200.55 B: i'm in new york city 

200.17 203.13 A: okay i'm in memphis 

201.67 203.04 B: oh okay great 

203.61 206.00 B: how's censorship down there 

205.88 210.74 A: not as bad as you might think [laughter] people here it's really involved down here um 

207.83 208.80 B: really 

210.71 216.94 A: i used to actually work at the civil rights museum here in memphis and it's at the uh lorraine 

216.79 229.91 A: motel where doctor king was assassinated and you'd think that there's usually a lot of ill feeling and you know there's there's really the people down here that are still racist are the older people you know 

220.07 220.85 B: yeah 

228.87 229.75 B: mhm 

229.76 242.93 A: and and they and none of them are really hard core like they used to be and really it's turned into a real melting pot down here of culture and if that really i mean nothing's ever censored down here anymore people can act the way they want and [lipsmack] um do the things they want to do 

243.02 252.09 A: not hurting other people they don't care you know there's sti- still protestors on either side but i'm sure it's the same where where you're from 

246.40 247.56 B: right 

250.61 254.48 B: yeah i mean i i go to new york university 

254.01 255.83 A: yeah 

254.61 257.81 B: and no one really has problems with 

259.36 262.81 B: you know read books about different subjects 

262.99 265.08 A: (( right )) 

263.61 268.70 B: yeah um i've never seen like people be upset that a book was in a p- a reading list 

269.30 276.94 A: oh abs- i mean yeah that was especially the academic role that's that's what fades out the question you know of all slices you know 

272.99 273.81 B: yeah 

277.48 286.40 A: i guess it's not as if you can really force you to do one thing or the other anyway along those lines but that i don't think you'd ever see that unless you're like at bob jones university or something 

285.83 287.18 B: yeah 

286.73 289.16 A: (( [mn] but uh )) 

289.37 295.79 A: you know i guess along that same topic sh- should universities allow you to you know or be allowed to force you in different cer- 

295.59 306.31 A: certain social settings and ult- in you know and ban you from doing other things you know what that's like that's why it's banned uh interracial dating until like a year ago i think 

301.01 301.90 B: (( mhm )) 

307.02 309.04 A: it's still at 

307.07 308.76 B: it was what a year ago 

309.16 319.67 A: bob jones university it's like a i think it's affiliated with yeah they banned interracial dating they banned uh obviously um well it's a religious school so i guess you still you get you know 

311.12 312.50 B: (( oh yeah yeah )) 

312.87 313.77 B: yeah 

320.03 324.59 A: ban homosexuality or other lifestyle choices like that 

324.64 325.49 B: yeah 

324.78 330.39 A: but [mn] i don't i wonder if even there if any sort of book bans are in place you know 

330.71 333.54 A: or if i guess if they could force read a 

333.61 341.02 A: a scriptural you know a analysis or something like that to see their point of view 

339.67 340.51 B: (( yeah well )) 

341.02 346.92 B: wasn't there a school like in north carolina that was forcing all the incoming freshmen to read the koran 

347.53 356.76 A: hm you know i think you know well that sounds familiar kinda reminds of that that book nigger that was on boston boston did you ever see that show 

348.84 349.80 B: it was like 

356.67 358.98 B: i've seen it but i don't watch it regularly 

359.53 373.11 A: i think it's the same kind of deal i think that what's the show was sorta based on like and the guy says you know we're going to read this book and it's just about how much how much pain that word has caused and i guess that i think the university is sorta doing the same thing with reading the koran because we're like well you know 

373.03 382.41 A: my kids this and that so they're not they can't read all this other stuff it's funny too because of the you know three religions the three the three big and the western culture all come in the same guy 

382.45 383.30 B: yeah 

382.67 397.65 A: you know we all we all is adam and eve it's just like learning which way one guy went you know so brothers and all that that is familiar i can't remember which one that is 

390.62 392.11 B: exactly 

394.87 398.65 B: i think it was like u._n._c. or something 

398.70 408.48 A: though oh there was a state school definitely i think that's why it all went to 'cause it was a state school i think that's why they got in so much trouble 'cause it was a state school not private mm 

400.67 401.80 B: yeah 

403.98 405.04 B: you did what 

408.27 409.64 B: yeah 

412.38 415.49 A: (( [laughter] )) 

412.77 413.86 B: (( mm )) 

415.84 417.39 B: (( so yeah )) 

418.19 427.52 A: (( ten minutes about this one subject's kinda strange i said said it's like i don't know have you d- have you done one of these calls before yet uh this is my first one )) 

421.58 422.99 B: this what 

426.26 428.09 B: no this is my first one 

427.87 432.00 A: did you see it on the internet or something 

430.53 434.27 B: yeah i found um someone sent me a link to it 

434.74 447.73 A: yeah fat wallet dot com yeah that that thing is kick arse or five three seven or something like that [lipsmack] but i guess like what what's going to happen are they just going to cut us off immediately or 

437.52 438.85 B: awesome 

447.30 449.32 B: i don't know after ten minutes 

448.63 452.52 A: (( hm yeah )) 

451.05 452.70 B: but 

453.66 456.43 B: yeah i guess i wonder how they choose the topics 

457.43 464.02 A: that's true like are are they just they funnily this one if if we're correct in what we heard if everybody's engaging is the opposite 

464.48 466.58 A: (( should there be a lot of banned books )) 

466.65 473.98 A: 'cause then you can drop in stuff you know all the way back to shetler and huckleberry finn and the catcher in the rye and all that stuff 

472.41 473.56 B: yeah 

474.17 478.19 A: this is it's hard to hard to guess a- 

475.51 478.44 B: i don't think they should they should ban books 

478.91 485.65 A: absolutely and i [mn] you know you have a choice inherently not to real if you don't t want to you know wh- why 

483.51 484.77 B: yeah 

486.10 500.43 A: that actually that episode of the simpsons was on the other day where they uh they had eros simpsons okay well they had the full cartoon inside the cartoon called the itchy and scratchy show which is like tom and jerry beating the hell out of each other right 

491.14 492.80 B: ah yeah i seen that 

499.14 500.88 B: yeah i know that 

500.34 504.11 A: all right so marge has this big season he gets kinda focused on in the 

504.32 506.12 A: south park a couple of times too 

506.08 515.96 A: but like she had this big write in in the making itchy and scratchy all touchy feely and you know the kids hated it and what not they just called this big this big 

515.92 529.20 A: then then after that's all fixed this uh michelangelo's david comes to springfield and all the people who are protesting the cartoon trying to protest that and marge is like marge is like well this it's a masterpiece and she's like 

525.34 526.38 B: [laughter] 

529.27 531.59 A: oh full frontal nudity or whatever 

531.63 544.35 A: and that's what i guess the moral of the story was you know you can't just against the free things you don't like you know [lipsmack] but [cough] it's 

537.95 538.93 B: yeah 

542.88 544.93 B: all about freedom of choice 

546.92 557.89 A: really all you got but uh so what kind of work do you are you you a full time student you're a full time student up there
