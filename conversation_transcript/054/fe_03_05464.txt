242.06 251.74 A: twenty eight so you're ready um uh just about to graduate from well there's or this the college in alhambra 

243.03 243.86 B: yeah 

251.49 254.07 B: yeah i'm pretty close i uh 

254.62 264.43 B: [sigh] i'm done actually it's pretty nice in three weeks i'm done with all my course work and then so from there it's just doing my dissertation and then um 

264.52 265.08 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

265.00 269.46 B: doing up an internship so i i have anywhere between a year and a half to two years 

269.27 275.14 B: so it's pretty fortunate i already had a i have a masters in clinical social work and i was doing therapy for a couple of years 

274.96 284.98 B: so i was able to transfer in some courses you know some related course work so i was able enabled me to push me through the program relatively quickly compared to my uh compared to my classmates 

285.46 288.07 B: [sigh] so it's nice i'm i'm finishing up 

288.08 294.42 A: oh that's pretty cool actually uh so you just in about next year or something you just will be able to 

289.37 290.40 B: yeah 

294.47 298.10 A: uh pretty much you do you do your work and stuff like that 

297.77 305.78 B: yeah in about a year i should be done with my dissertation and all my requirements and then all i have to do is is basically go get a job 

305.77 313.04 B: and hold it for nine months to collect all the internship powers and then [noise] i'm formally uh graduated [noise] 

312.46 317.06 A: yeah uh how hard is it to find a job with a k- the kind of major you have 

317.30 323.71 B: um it's not [sigh] well it depends it's it's i'm going to be doing consulting so 

323.58 336.15 B: when the market is better it's a lot easier for me to find a job and when it's not i have to be a little bit more tactical on which firms i go for and kind of what's hot in what industries 

336.06 350.49 B: so it it it really just depends and so i've been networking with a with a couple of people in a few different firms just trying to build relationships right now so the time comes when i need a job you know i already know people in the right places 

350.55 360.99 A: oh that's that's great what is the best uh area for market uh in uh in your area like uh what's serious like uh offer you more opportunities 

351.99 352.97 B: yeah 

360.63 372.68 B: um well [mn] most of the firms are in downtown l._a. so firms such as i'm not sure if you're familiar with but like deloitte consulting or um mercer h._r. 

372.78 378.65 B: um i- i- have you heard of the big four like you know like arthur andersen pricewaterhouse coopers 

377.73 379.29 A: right right right 

378.66 380.77 B: so a lot of those firms have 

381.17 391.10 B: departments and services within their organization that does organizational psychology such as like change management and leadership development 

391.26 396.66 B: so i work that's that's the type of work that i do and and so it's 

395.80 400.76 A: [sigh] a- and when you start to work what what kind of hobby you gonna have uh in the future 

400.90 408.58 B: well actually one of the [sigh] one of the reasons i i picked up golf was so that because it's it's a businessman's game 

408.96 417.38 B: and [sigh] so with doing a lot of consulting i'll have to do a lot of business development so the higher up i go in the organization i'm sure the more 

417.25 426.08 B: relationship building i'll have to be doing with potential clients or you know big clients so taking 'em out for a round of golf 

426.13 440.00 B: you know is a is a nice way to kind of ease the tension you go out and have a good time with the client and you're building a relationship and you got your hobby all at the same time so i i imagine i'll do that and i also think about you know if i'm gonna be able to 

439.91 442.51 B: w- work out as much as i do 

442.59 450.19 B: now once i get you know once i'm traveling somewhat and it's like that i'm a little skeptical about although i'd like to 

450.28 458.88 B: um unless like the hotels have you know some si- some type of gym in it i don't know how realistic that will be 

458.58 468.05 A: [mn] [noise] yeah actually that's what uh i do for a living as a matter of fact i do public relation relations i work at the la montage hotel in beverly hills 

464.42 465.39 B: oh really 

467.45 469.38 B: (( mhm )) 

467.98 480.87 A: and uh basically my kind of job that i have is just to get contacts and create activities and recreational things and a lot of celebrities involved and 

480.26 482.04 B: (( right )) 

480.65 490.29 A: and all the stuff and uh i don't know if you're you're familiar with la montage 'cause it's like one of these five diamonds hotel where everything is exclusive 

489.87 490.81 B: uh-huh 

490.51 500.70 A: so uh a room over there cost four thousand dollars a night so you can imagine wh- the kind of clientele that we have and the stress that we have 

493.58 494.67 B: wow 

498.09 499.71 B: right right 

500.27 501.53 B: yeah 

500.83 509.15 A: so the only way that i let it go is through yoga that's my hobby uh well actually i don't consider that a hobby but 

504.98 506.68 B: yeah 

509.04 515.89 A: uh that's what i do normally in my free time because i need it's it's a pretty stressful job sometime 

511.84 513.70 B: mhm 

515.22 517.20 B: yeah 

516.22 523.76 A: um i used to uh in florida i lived in miami and utah for three years each 

521.74 523.33 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

523.73 525.62 A: i used to do massage 

525.59 526.61 B: oh wow 

525.60 540.32 A: like massage therapy professionally um i not do it in california because the license uh to change the license from florida uh to california is two thousand dollars and i believe it's ridiculous 

527.62 529.31 B: right 

537.90 538.93 B: oh man 

540.24 541.08 B: yeah 

540.39 554.17 A: and here it's not like a license per a state license per city so it means i have to pay like a two thousand to santa monica two thousand to beverly hills two thousand to los angeles hollywood and each city 

550.47 551.63 B: oh wow 

553.84 555.10 B: right 

554.37 558.21 A: when in other states it's one license per whole state so 

558.35 562.93 A: this is a ridiculous lot so i no i'm no going to do it and 

562.08 564.43 B: yeah that is pretty ri- ri- ridiculous 

564.22 571.47 A: yeah so basically my hobby and my things that i do because what i from my background 

564.85 565.46 B: (( uh-huh )) 

571.46 581.64 A: i like i- spirituality and relaxation and outdoors and connect to the nature and i- 

573.53 575.35 B: (( mhm )) 

581.12 582.36 B: yeah 

581.70 589.98 A: when i am not at work because for the kind of job i have is too much pressure in a and that thing a- and so 

587.93 589.96 B: (( right )) 

590.29 597.39 A: basically that's normally what i we do here it's it's pretty stressful already in l._a. with the traffic [laughter] 

596.25 599.89 B: oh that's for sure yes similar to you i i actually 

597.58 598.83 A: yeah
