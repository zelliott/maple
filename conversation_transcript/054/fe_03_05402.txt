0.00 0.83 A: (( [mn] [noise] hello )) 

2.04 2.98 A: hello 

2.34 6.79 B: yeah hello uh hi i'm calling you about the study 

3.73 4.62 A: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

6.38 7.49 A: yeah 

6.83 9.34 B: yeah okay yeah my name is kirby 

8.80 11.46 A: [noise] mine's richard i'm in [noise] seattle 

10.80 22.74 B: okay you're in seattle okay so the topic uh is if we opened our own business [mn] uh [mn] and money was not the object uh you know what would we do and what kind of business would we open 

22.30 23.62 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yes )) 

23.78 25.19 B: [mn] so uh 

25.20 30.24 B: [mn] i would think that uh [mn] i would probably open a uh 

30.29 42.10 B: [mn] a financial advisor service of some kind as a investment counselor or financial advisor that's what i think i would do because that's what i'm pretty used to doing so that's what i would do 

38.71 39.85 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [mn] )) 

40.20 43.42 A: (( [noise] [noise] [mn] yeah [cough] and it's [noise] [noise] )) 

43.26 49.36 B: [laughter] and so the office space here in in san francisco is very expensive so i'm sure i would [mn] 

49.12 59.33 B: uh need a lot of capital to do it so fortunately that was part of the scenario that it was like if you had any amount of money i think it said if you had any amount of money so [mn] there that's what i would do so [mn] [mn] 

53.65 54.23 A: (( [noise] )) 

59.22 60.65 A: [mn] [mn] um 

60.96 66.42 A: [mn] well i've [sigh] it's been several years now but i opened my own business then [noise] 

67.34 69.49 A: [mn] it was a counseling office 

69.66 73.37 A: [noise] and it was just another business partner [mn] working with me 

73.99 78.50 A: and uh i learned a lot but i really wasn't prepared to go into it and i didn't know 

78.56 87.51 A: i didn't realise how complicated it was [mn] i'm and it's one of those things [noise] i'm glad i did and i might do it again but [mn] i really wasn't prepared 

89.07 92.32 A: and so i mean i lasted a year but it was very difficult 

92.03 96.78 B: [mn] [mn] [mn] [mn] was it a matter of uh that you needed a lot more money to begin with 

96.85 99.52 B: you know or or or was i- 

98.52 100.79 A: [noise] [noise] no it was um [mn] 

101.89 108.02 A: [sigh] it was a lot of [noise] things uh one of the biggest things is [noise] i should have gone in 

108.02 120.50 A: i should have done it alone because [noise] uh the person i went into business with changed his mind midstream and so i ended up having all of the responsibilities and making all the payments 

120.51 122.66 A: (( [noise] [mn] and um [noise] [noise] )) 

120.72 130.33 B: [mn] oh yeah [mn] yeah i i i would agree i would never go into business with a partner i would i would think i'm taking enough [mn] risk as it is 

130.32 139.28 B: [mn] just trying divi- divide my time in a twenty four hour day and it would r- i would think any time [mn] you split responsibility it's really more of a risk so 

139.09 144.53 A: [mn] yeah and um [mn] i was more interested in it than he was and so i was 

140.11 141.01 B: yeah 

144.56 155.55 A: i was there a lot i mean i enjoyed it but it was like [mn] what i thought it was going to be [noise] splitting responsibilities and bills and everything [mn] turned out i i was doing everything 

147.38 147.94 B: (( [mn] )) 

147.95 149.07 B: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

155.22 160.34 B: well a lot of people look at it differently you know talking about you know using the money wisely like 

160.23 168.91 B: some people would say a lot well a lot of people would say it's too risky to go in business yourself you need a partner [mn] in case something happens you've got two incomes coming in or you got two 

167.56 168.65 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

168.74 176.19 B: [mn] amounts of of of uh capital to invest in it uh i uh i wouldn't take that view i would think that you would have 

171.27 172.78 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

176.05 188.36 B: more control if you was just doing everything yourself and you was the one [mn] responsible [mn] uh 'cause you could make decisions much quicker you wouldn't have to consult with with with your partner about it [mn] and uh [mn] 

178.07 178.78 A: (( [noise] )) 

180.97 183.50 A: (( [noise] )) 

186.98 187.98 A: (( right [noise] )) 

188.16 198.86 B: definitely [mn] i think it would be you would have more of a situation to [mn] have an argument with somebody if you had a partner [mn] so i i wouldn't do that i i would definitely 

199.10 210.29 B: scout out oh a prestigious office [mn] they said clearly that the scenario is if [mn] you know if you had any amount of money well that's what they said [mn] or enough money [mn] i definitely would 

207.38 208.86 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [mn] )) 

210.12 220.03 B: uh have an office in the embarcadero area of san francisco very expensive overlooking the bay [mn] uh you know the nicest [mn] uh view possible office in 

216.20 217.28 A: okay 

219.88 229.83 B: [mn] uh i would set myself up uh as a [mn] financial an- analyst securities analyst financial advisor [mn] financial counselor [noise] something like that all four of them really [mn] 

228.58 229.22 A: (( uh-huh )) 

229.47 230.65 A: yeah 

230.03 243.12 B: 'cause you have a test here in california called the series seven where you have to pass it to be a [mn] financial advisor or investment advisor blah blah yeah [mn] so once you got that other things are really pretty easy and uh so 

231.01 231.66 A: (( [noise] )) 

236.39 237.45 A: [noise] really 

241.57 243.47 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [mn] i guess yeah [noise] )) 

243.31 251.53 B: i would want to have a nice view and [mn] that would [mn] to have an office with a nice view in san francisco would be extremely expensive it would be [mn] 

251.29 260.17 B: my goodness jus- it would be like oh even a small office would be something like [mn] six thousand dollars seven thousand dollars a month [laughter] 

258.05 260.77 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] ow easily )) 

260.19 261.54 B: [laughter] 

260.92 262.44 A: (( yes )) 

261.76 265.59 B: yeah so uh gee i mean that's what i would do 

264.74 266.02 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

265.38 278.68 B: and and that's what i would do i [mn] i guess i would advertise uh in the [mn] uh in in newspaper in the newspaper pr- yeah probably advertise on t._v. i would have i would think if it was no amount of money i would [mn] put ads on t._v. i guess do adv- 

267.39 268.90 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

273.63 274.84 A: (( [noise] )) 

278.66 281.46 B: ads on in the in on television 

278.94 280.79 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

281.64 282.78 A: and that's something 

281.82 282.74 B: (( [mn] so )) 

282.82 290.03 A: [cough] i learned in [cough] [mn] at least in the beginning advertising is crucial but it's also expensive [mn] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

288.72 295.16 B: very yeah yeah i found that very interesting they put the scenario is is you know of any amount of money so [mn] 

295.34 297.13 B: to me quite frankly [mn] 

297.25 304.09 B: if you open a business and you have like any amount of money and money is not the object i don't think it would be too hard [mn] 

298.32 299.57 A: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

303.96 314.38 B: to get the business uh started if you could advertise a lot because really the the main thing about a business is this is word of mouth if you if you can't get the advertising 

307.37 308.43 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

312.07 313.57 A: [mn] yeah 

314.17 329.10 B: and that would take you two years to even begin to get off the ground [mn] even with a small business administration loan [mn] and then if you had a lot of money for advertising [mn] well advertising is so ubiqu- [mn] ubiquitous i- in in the united states that if you could [mn] pi- pick 

317.19 318.88 A: (( [noise] [noise] [mn] oh [mn] [noise] )) 

329.30 331.79 B: uh pay for prime time advertising 

331.81 340.77 B: [mn] from uh five p._m. to uh nine p._m. your time i couldn't see how you couldn't at least get initial customers in i mean you'd have people calling 

335.13 336.39 A: (( [noise] yes )) 

340.65 348.41 B: you'd have people coming in so [mn] i found that thought to be very strange thing to say about any amount of money [laughter] i don't see much of a challenge to that really 

342.54 344.05 A: (( [cough] [mn] yes [mn] [noise] [noise] )) 

348.17 359.04 B: i think i could start a business with any amount of money if i had if i had a blank check to write any amount of money for a business i don't think it would be that difficult the thing is it's [mn] mo- i don't know of anybody that has that you know [noise] 

358.78 360.38 A: [mn] well yeah 'cause that [mn] 

360.43 364.40 A: that makes it kind of unrealistic because in my 

362.20 367.18 B: [mn] yeah [mn] you know even venture capitalists even you know venture capital is 

367.14 380.35 B: is is very hard to get unlimited you know you might have a really good idea uh and it might take you two or three years to get venture capital you know unless you just have a lot of money yourself you're sworn into wealth or you inherited a lot of wealth 

369.62 370.95 A: yeah 

379.89 382.28 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

380.20 382.27 B: [mn] uh [mn] you know 

382.90 385.93 A: i know i know [noise] because [mn] 

383.01 383.92 B: so 

384.31 385.00 B: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

385.99 392.34 A: what i i i kind of knew but then doing it i mean you're responsible for everything [cough] 

392.35 394.69 A: you know i mean 

393.27 397.77 B: yeah it's better to be that way i think when you have your own business and be responsible for everything yeah 

395.39 402.28 A: [mn] it it is but but then you realise how expensive it is you know and those bills are coming in every month and [mn] [cough] 

399.17 400.10 B: yeah 

400.42 401.34 B: (( [sigh] )) 

402.35 408.56 A: but [cough] what we heard is that if money's no object shoot it'd been it wouldn't have been no challenge at all [noise] 

405.53 406.72 B: yeah 

407.77 421.32 B: yeah that's true i mean like if you had if you had any amount of money [mn] uh you wouldn't even have to think about going to the bank to get a loan and ev- you know the the small business administration you understand it's really not that hard to get a loan from the small business administration 

421.12 423.50 B: they expect people to to 

423.40 428.56 B: to fail uh trying the business you know so if you really if you write up a business plan 

426.37 427.45 A: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

428.46 441.25 B: and understand i've never done it but if you write up a business plan and and it's it's it's more than half way sensible [mn] and it seems reasonable the small business [mn] administration would give you a loan [mn] you know 

435.33 436.61 A: (( [noise] uh-huh uh-huh [noise] )) 

440.68 441.84 A: yeah 

441.06 453.11 B: y- you know [mn] for i understand it's not that hard uh but i don't know what happens [mn] happens when you can't afford to pay back the loan i don't know [mn] maybe they require you to put up a collateral of your house or something you know i don't know what kind of collateral they take 

450.46 452.32 A: (( [noise] right [noise] [noise] i would think [mn] )) 

452.75 455.61 A: [noise] [mn] i would think there would have to be something [noise] 

455.87 457.71 A: to make it you know 

457.90 472.60 B: [noise] well actually many state governments and federal governments give grants to open to start a business will give you like [mn] open grant like a thousand or or four thousand dollars depending on what kind of business it is let's say [lipsmack] let's say you're opening a [mn] uh a you wanted to start making 

463.33 464.55 A: (( [noise] [mn] [noise] true )) 

465.35 466.87 A: yeah 

467.34 468.18 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

472.69 483.68 B: uh [mn] windmills for electricity well maybe they'll give you seed money for that or something you know something that they think i- is needed for the whole country that you'd be be able to get [mn] maybe a grant for it 

474.07 476.04 A: [noise] right 

476.90 477.46 A: (( [mn] )) 

482.22 483.72 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

483.85 494.15 B: [mn] but uh [mn] gee i was just [mn] like i say just back to boy any amount of money i don't see much of a challenge to starting a business if you have any amount of money to start because it's the start of it the 

483.99 485.50 A: (( [noise] yes )) 

486.88 487.47 A: (( [noise] )) 

494.46 501.57 B: question didn't say [mn] you know that y- your business had to succeed you just had to start a business what would it be if you started a business 

501.10 502.43 A: [noise] right 

501.49 514.99 B: and you had any amount of money what would it be well if you had any amount of money i don't see how it would be that much of a challenge [mn] you i 'cause you could always think of something that you can go in business for [mn] i could sell cars [mn] i could import cars i c- [laughter] 

507.12 508.82 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

511.02 512.38 A: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

512.75 513.32 A: (( [mn] )) 

514.02 516.11 A: [cough] oh i know i know 

514.99 523.32 B: uh yeah i'm a potter um yeah i'm a potter i i could see me buying four or five kilns and opening my own pottery studio 

517.41 518.45 A: (( really [noise] )) 

523.30 525.10 A: (( so [mn] where do you )) 

523.63 526.53 B: you know and having seven or eight people [mn] 

525.97 532.78 A: is that i'm just asking 'cause i don't know [mn] um [mn] do you [mn] is that a hobby is that oh a living whi- [noise] 

529.04 530.11 B: (( [mn] )) 

531.97 544.36 B: yeah yeah [mn] yeah pottery's a hobby of mine but i've been doing it for many years but if i had unlimited amount of money oh i could see myself easily [mn] opening a loft here in san francisco a loft space 

534.35 536.05 A: (( okay [noise] )) 

540.60 542.81 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

544.18 555.89 B: get two or three kilns [mn] and hire two or three other uh potters and i could certainly open a [mn] uh if the money's no object i could certainly uh have one place where i make the pottery 

545.68 546.44 A: [noise] 

555.41 557.26 A: (( [mn] okay yeah )) 

555.74 569.77 B: uh and then you know in the back part of the warehouse in the front of the warehouse i would make it into a showroom [mn] you know the front part it'd be like [mn] any amount of money would be the showroom the back part would be the working area [mn] and uh you know to do that would [mn] i would guess take uh [mn] 

563.30 564.24 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

566.28 567.46 A: it [noise]

581.84 585.17 B: [mn] yeah [mn] well yeah i mean the advertising 

583.14 587.78 A: you know so that makes it yeah that makes it kind of unrealistic because shoo- 

585.26 591.74 B: [mn] yeah i mean if money's object you could always be putting ads in the n- in the newspaper you could be 

591.81 599.89 B: [mn] putting ads on t._v. you could always buy uh [mn] the the the best uh showroom if you're like in the retail business you could bu- buy the best
