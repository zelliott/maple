17.07 18.68 A: uh yeah 

17.99 20.53 B: um yeah i think uh 

20.96 28.38 B: criminal trials should should be televised especially ones that have national repercussions or 

24.54 25.55 A: oh yeah 

28.25 29.33 A: mhm 

28.70 34.59 B: um i think criminal trials always teach a lesson to other people 

34.04 34.77 A: (( mm )) 

35.22 36.29 B: (( so )) 

37.01 43.84 B: and i've always seen like you know clips here and there at times i don't have 

43.98 49.66 B: the time to watch you know tr- hour after hour of a trial on t._v. but 

47.63 48.69 A: oh yeah 

48.77 50.67 A: mhm 

50.00 52.38 B: uh i think it's important anyways 

52.76 54.98 B: for that type of for that type of publicity 

52.94 54.05 A: oh yeah 

55.10 60.72 A: mhm [lipsmack] yeah well i agree with ya i know the the big one lately has uh 

61.02 70.61 A: been uh the one in uh california there uh trying to think of it the guy's name it slips me right at the moment uh where he killed his wife and his uh baby 

68.80 71.39 B: yeah the twenty seven year old woman

74.50 75.38 B: (( [laughter] )) 

76.98 80.10 B: mhm peterson peterson 

77.47 89.29 A: and you know i think yeah peterson scott peterson yeah and uh i think you know i'm i believe they're gonna allow cameras into the courtroom on that too 'cause it's such a high profile type case you 

80.38 81.26 B: (( yeah )) 

89.18 89.98 B: (( mm )) 

89.98 90.84 A: (( know )) 

90.86 95.42 A: but uh i know the the big one several years ago was o._j. simpson trial 

95.27 97.19 B: [mn] in the early nineties 

95.72 96.60 A: (( you know )) 

96.93 111.42 A: uh-huh and uh that was like court t._v. just you know all the time [laughter] you know and uh i was like you i i i'd watch you know bits and pieces of it but i never just sit down a- hour after hour and watch anything like that 

97.60 98.16 B: (( [mn] )) 

101.33 102.29 B: (( yeah )) 

110.87 111.68 B: (( mm )) 

111.96 121.69 B: i remember the oliver north trial in nineteen eighty seven and because i was home and i was only in like eighth or ninth grade then 

114.70 115.69 A: yeah 

116.06 117.09 A: yeah 

121.45 122.82 A: oh okay 

121.82 127.78 B: i i remember um that summer just actually seeing 

128.09 131.68 B: the trial [mn] but 'cause it was a federal case 

131.26 132.35 A: yeah 

131.76 133.42 B: and um 

133.43 141.70 B: being enthralled with that uh that that entire summer then discussing that in s- like civics class the next year 

141.42 142.48 A: mhm 

142.46 143.59 B: but uh 

144.40 145.94 B: i i think it's 

146.55 149.06 B: it adds a bit more um 

149.23 152.06 B: credibility to what's going in americ- 

152.12 155.52 B: in american society too when it's televised 

152.34 153.20 A: yeah 

155.19 164.81 A: sure uh-huh well it's like you say it brings attention to the crime itself and hopefully you know it'll teach people a lesson you know not to go there you know 

162.84 163.84 B: mhm 

164.44 169.90 B: right can't do that or or i'm gonna get fried or whatever and 

165.34 166.23 A: and 

169.29 170.58 A: yeah 

169.99 171.23 B: (( and )) 

170.67 177.66 A: uh-huh and i think some other high profile case gonna be coming up in the future are a lot of them has to do with the terrorist 

177.88 186.07 A: and uh i think some of those trials will will will maybe uh you know be uh be uh televised too i at least i would think so 

185.71 186.56 B: (( mm )) 

186.14 196.35 A: since they're since they're dealing with national security terrorism this type of thing so that anybody around the world can hey see what we uh see that we do prosecute terrorists 

188.70 189.63 B: right 

195.98 203.82 B: mhm and it'll be like probably like a similar to a world war two trial the nuremberg trials or whatever 

202.28 203.19 A: yeah 

203.17 210.37 A: oh yeah mhm yeah tho- those things made history too i i i wasn't around at that time but you know it was it was in the history 

208.23 208.84 B: (( mm )) 

210.30 219.60 A: so uh that's how we know about that and uh well see uh i'm trying to think of the big the big four criminals guys they put on trial several years ago milosevic 

210.31 210.95 B: (( yeah )) 

219.49 220.88 B: mhm 

220.30 225.81 A: remember and he had uh they had uh a war crimes a tribunal for him 

223.95 224.81 B: right 

225.44 226.79 B: mhm 

226.21 227.04 A: (( you know )) 

227.18 233.53 A: and uh i don't i don't recall that that exactly being on t._v. though but it was it was big in the news 

233.24 234.54 B: mhm 

235.27 238.08 A: but i think the big one that we all i guess we all remem- 

238.15 240.76 A: can relate to is the o._j. simpson trial 

240.43 241.42 B: yeah 

241.09 254.18 A: and that one just really really went on i know uh uh you know working and everything i didn't have time to just watch it day after day or anything but i did try to you know keep up with it and i would catch bits and pieces here and there 

253.96 261.94 A: of when i was at home and uh and try to you know see what they're what they were going through the process and all 

262.58 263.74 A: but um 

262.60 266.70 B: mm marsha clark she was the lawyer remember 

264.45 265.58 A: yeah 

266.58 280.39 A: yeah yeah and you know o._j. had a tremendous uh defence team for him he [laughter] he had uh he had some of the top top guys in the country you know on his defence team and he and i'm sure he paid 'em some pretty big bucks for that too 

275.47 276.32 B: mm 

279.69 280.75 B: (( [laughter] )) 

280.83 281.76 A: (( [laughter] )) 

280.96 284.43 B: okay here's the money just prove that i'm innocent 

283.82 286.52 A: yeah yeah exactly 

286.64 296.31 A: mhm do they uh up in your area do they have a lot of uh maybe anything locally going on as far as in the in the trials or anything that they show on t._v. 

294.46 298.77 B: oh martha oh martha stewart right now is the big the big to do 

296.84 297.86 A: yeah 

298.45 299.90 A: oh okay 

299.47 300.41 B: um with 

300.59 302.84 B: with her indictment with the 

302.98 303.96 A: uh-huh 

303.16 305.05 B: stock fraud and 

305.26 306.62 B: but um 

307.00 310.90 B: everything's on a district uh usually like 

311.34 315.12 B: local um trials are are televised or 

314.85 315.81 A: mhm 

315.15 319.41 B: they get you know news coverage and certain parts are 

319.64 322.36 B: of course are edited and certain parts are 

322.82 324.22 B: (( publicly uh )) 

324.27 326.01 A: mhm 

325.70 327.26 B: addressed 

327.15 329.89 A: yeah yeah yeah 

328.82 332.15 B: never a dull moment in new york unfortunately 

331.41 339.56 A: [laughter] yeah well it seems like you probably have more going on up there than you than we do down here [laughter] [laughter] 

332.21 332.98 B: (( uh )) 

337.63 338.99 B: yeah 

340.34 349.69 A: but uh one of the one of the things we had kind of going on lately uh i'll say within oh within the past couple of months that it was settled it was right after the election 

349.62 359.23 A: the um is a counting uh thing going on here they didn't know who had uh exactly one the election it was so close with the sheriff's race 

358.86 360.16 B: mhm 

359.56 368.28 A: and uh so the incumbent he w- he had um oh he had lost uh by the count i think about seven hundred and some votes 

368.08 374.59 A: and then they uh come to find out that there was some vote uh fraud going on vote buying 

373.25 374.00 B: (( mm )) 

374.54 384.77 A: and people were selling their votes which of course is a federal you know federal crime so this makes the t._v. coverage too they had uh they showed that on just the local 

379.35 380.14 B: (( mm )) 

385.03 390.71 A: uh local uh t._v. station here just um you know would cover that during the day 

390.97 403.06 A: and uh that was that was something i you know i we i guess i paid more attention to because i knew some of the people that were involved in that you know i i knew the the people like some of the um 

399.12 400.03 B: (( oh )) 

402.92 415.67 A: some of the other uh people that were mainly voters and some were like the politicians who were like uh head of the counting um uh you know the counting parties and this kind of thing 

415.08 416.91 B: mhm 

415.99 423.07 A: so they were they were all in the in the courtroom and of course it it continued for day after day and and um 

423.02 433.24 A: and they finally you know got that settled [laughter] after after several weeks of uh investigations and uh preliminary investigations and this type of thing 

432.68 437.59 B: yeah no it's it's just surprising like that 

433.48 434.91 A: so i do i 

437.99 439.38 B: people don't 

439.92 446.71 B: like check their actions before they actually do them like murder just continues happening 

443.26 444.28 A: yeah 

446.96 451.72 B: like year after year and p- people are just stupid 'cause they're like 

448.26 449.35 A: yeah 

452.24 462.08 B: you know they don't look at previous murder cases it's like well if you get caught you're you're either gonna get life in prisonment or the the electric chair 

461.88 462.94 A: yeah 

462.37 463.72 B: and 

463.74 469.19 B: oh i you know those two options don't seem very attractive and 

468.63 469.60 A: uh-huh 

470.15 473.40 B: i don't uh pe- i don't know it just it seems like 

473.89 479.34 B: but also i mean this is a a smidgen o- of the population that 

478.75 480.00 A: mhm 

479.35 482.66 B: gets all the publicity because of what what it is i 

482.60 483.62 A: mhm 

482.69 484.94 B: mean these crimes like it 

484.56 486.46 A: well yeah 

486.61 499.25 A: and as far as the t._v. uh goes with that i i'd i i agree with you 'cause uh i think that if uh if things were more publicized and a higher profile that it is uh acts as a deterrent i would i would think 

498.68 499.61 B: mhm 

499.04 511.65 A: you know if people were to see that maybe some of these trials they should have more on t._v. you know where where people actually uh uh show what the what the consequences uh uh it is you know for their crime 

511.11 512.92 B: yeah 

513.06 516.79 B: i mean it's i mean it's it's like a big show but 

516.82 521.49 B: um it most of the time i think it they're they're meaningful the the trials that are 

521.36 523.29 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

522.12 523.04 B: that are pub- 

523.07 524.32 B: televised 

526.41 529.20 A: [lipsmack] yeah have they had anything uh just uh 

529.05 543.66 A: um i may have just may have asked you this question before kind of uh on a on a local area up there up there as far as any high type uh crimes uh uh anything y ou know in dealing in felonies or anything have you seen any of those uh just actual uh uh 

543.50 546.46 A: actual live coverage 

546.51 548.55 A: do they do very much of that up there 

547.77 551.01 B: um yeah i mean like you know 

551.32 553.88 B: especially in new york right in new york city 

554.22 555.43 B: um 

555.61 559.85 B: i mean news coverage covers pretty much 

558.66 561.21 A: (( mhm )) 

560.78 566.06 B: i mean not the crime itself but all the aftermath and then if 

562.78 563.74 A: mhm 

564.68 565.93 A: yeah 

566.16 569.04 B: if the case goes to trial 

569.49 574.60 B: usu- usually the the trials are are televised or 

573.99 575.15 A: mhm 

574.53 586.33 B: you know it whatever's per- allowed to be televised is 'cause sometimes they're not allowed to be televised um but you always here in the in the news like on a nightly basis like 

579.75 580.82 A: mhm 

582.41 583.76 A: i suppose then 

583.83 584.59 A: yeah 

586.54 590.93 B: like yu- young mothers or fathers or whatever are like you know 

591.07 599.57 B: killing their children or whatever and it it seems like it's been a m- a more repeated uh type of phenomenon 

592.57 593.58 A: yeah 

599.05 599.89 A: uh-huh
