1.63 5.40 A: [noise] hi [cough] my name my name my name's jeremy 

2.77 3.88 B: (( my my )) 

4.96 6.27 B: my name's jeff 

6.12 7.14 A: hi 

7.10 8.61 B: how's it going 

8.04 9.52 A: (( all right how are you )) 

9.41 11.19 B: good 

10.48 18.74 A: i'd i like this topic 'cause i i have some sort of pathological aversion to movies or movie theaters i don't why it is but 

16.42 17.29 B: yeah 

18.89 22.67 A: i think waiting around for it to start is what bothers me 

21.68 22.46 B: [laughter] 

22.99 29.00 B: i like there are some movies on that that are [mn] i think better on the big screen 

28.89 30.54 A: yeah 

29.07 30.47 B: but uh 

30.73 34.43 B: for me it's the cost and and uh 

35.21 42.73 B: setting in the seat that long i mean at least at home you can uh if you gotta do something put it on pause and 

37.23 38.59 A: yeah 

43.40 45.59 B: go do what you gotta do and come back 

45.13 48.28 A: [laughter] yeah exactly um 

49.08 52.23 A: i've found that uh uh you don't have tivo do you 

52.24 53.21 B: no 

52.97 62.78 A: oh i i've found that now that i've had it for a couple of years and you get kind of accustomed to fast forwarding through the parts that bore you uh 

63.19 67.01 A: not being able to do that in the movie theater just makes these things uh 

67.49 70.30 A: i don't know a a little bit difficult to sit through 

70.30 71.58 B: yeah 

71.25 77.79 A: uh i mean the the [noise] pausing is nice too but but fast forwarding through the the silly 

78.30 81.41 A: back story love story part [laughter] [cough] 

80.78 82.58 B: yeah 

81.63 84.53 A: is uh it's a pretty nice feature too [mn] 

85.14 86.13 A: um 

86.71 88.02 A: i guess uh 

88.33 91.98 A: i guess the other thing was uh they they asked what was the last movie we saw 

91.91 93.71 B: yeah 

93.02 95.19 A: um how 'bout you 

95.37 96.66 B: um 

97.53 99.75 B: i think the last was 

100.22 104.34 B: last time i went to the movie theater i saw the last star trek 

106.30 112.55 B: yeah yeah i saw the last star trek motion picture in the theaters 

106.94 107.80 A: (( star )) 

112.48 114.82 A: not not star wars star trek 

114.34 115.85 B: star trek yeah 

115.18 117.60 A: yeah um 

118.14 123.75 A: i can't even remember what the last one i saw was it was uh probably about a year ago 

123.96 124.96 A: um 

125.58 136.98 A: the last movie i saw on t._v. was uh [laughter] was super troopers last night which wasn't very good [laughter] but uh but you know it's on t._v. so you take what you can get [mn] um 

131.46 132.37 B: yeah 

138.12 139.95 A: but yeah i'd i'd 

140.82 144.61 A: [cough] i can't remember the last movie s- o- on i saw in the theater [mn] 

145.77 146.69 A: um 

147.48 150.36 A: you know getting back to that theater thing though um 

150.97 154.38 A: the fact that there are other people in the theater and there's nobody uh 

154.87 159.82 A: nobody uninvited in your home also makes it somewhat more attractive to see these things uh 

159.88 164.04 A: on on t._v. rather than the theater yeah 

161.17 162.61 B: on d._v._d. 

162.84 164.36 B: yeah 

164.28 169.56 A: (( [noise] [noise] um but i don't know [noise] [noise] )) 

168.58 181.86 B: yeah yeah that's for me for me a- about the only attraction to the theater was is the size of the screen and and the you know how the image plays out on the screen how much 

182.96 192.07 B: i think it's a lot better than than the t._v. screen but yeah there are some definite drawbacks to the theater the 

191.42 193.09 A: (( yeah )) 

192.12 197.05 B: yeah the fact that you're not the only one in there yeah and and uh 

197.90 204.95 B: them little bitty cramped seats i don't i don't remember a theater i've been in where i was ever comfortable in the seat it was uh [mn] 

199.69 201.79 A: [laughter] 

206.60 212.60 A: well well now they have the the the stadium seating renaissance going on where 

212.78 217.69 A: a- at least they're tr- it seems like they're trying to put in some comfortable seats i don't know if they've gotten to uh 

217.77 220.20 A: to the theaters around where you live but uh 

220.55 225.84 A: at least around here and uh and back on the east coast where i used to live the [sigh] 

225.90 235.12 A: it seems like every theater built in the last i don't know five six years has these these great reclining seats set up like you know 

235.21 237.09 A: all tiered and stuff 

236.57 237.86 B: yeah 

237.56 238.56 A: um 

239.02 243.39 A: but for whatever reason it still doesn't it still doesn't motivate me to go there 

242.77 244.45 B: yeah 

244.87 248.99 B: yeah for me it's like i said mostly the cost you know 

244.93 245.82 A: (( uh )) 

248.13 249.01 A: (( uh-huh )) 

249.35 263.65 B: i got three kids and time all of us get a ticket and get in to see the movie we wanna see i- it's cost me eighty bucks and you can buy the d._v._d. when it comes out for eighteen twenty and set at home and 

263.46 264.46 A: right 

263.55 266.03 B: like i said make your own popcorn and 

265.18 266.50 A: [laughter] 

266.51 269.42 B: put it on pause when you need to and 

269.97 275.29 A: well how much um how much are tickets out out where you are i i know uh 

274.33 277.37 B: i'm in washington state and um 

277.95 281.53 B: if i'm not mistaken it's about seven dollars and fifty cents a person 

281.26 283.37 A: yeah that sounds about right wow 

284.00 287.50 A: i i moved out here out to colorado from new york uh 

287.70 293.78 A: about a year and a half ago and in new york they were uh they were ten bucks which is just just astonishing you know 

291.19 292.32 B: (( oh man )) 

293.03 294.73 B: yeah 

293.81 295.83 A: out here they're a little less but 

295.96 300.64 A: yeah you're right once you get a once you get a family there it 

299.33 308.26 B: yeah each of us gets a popcorn when we go through and then a a drink you've dropped a hundred dollars time you get into a theater 

308.14 309.82 A: that's amazing 

309.19 310.91 B: yeah 

310.18 312.22 A: that's amazing um 

315.15 317.06 A: [sigh] i hadn't really thought of it that way 

316.82 318.20 B: yeah 

317.76 319.53 A: [laughter] 

318.26 319.73 B: ((  )) 

319.94 321.19 B: (( smuggle in food [laughter] [laughter] )) 

320.09 323.01 A: (( [mn] and and oh no i don't even try anymore )) 

323.04 324.61 B: (( [laughter] well now )) 

324.70 326.95 B: (( that'd be fun for the kids right that'd be fun for )) 

326.84 329.78 A: (( [laughter] )) 

327.38 328.10 B: (( the kids )) 

330.53 332.93 A: (( so is that huh yeah [laughter] )) 

330.98 331.97 B: (( right act )) 

332.58 333.51 B: (( like spies )) 

333.28 335.16 A: (( [noise] )) 

336.64 338.26 B: [laughter] 

340.29 341.10 A: um 

340.49 346.88 B: yeah the [sigh] theaters around here all make you go through one door and they don't let you carry anything off the street 

346.76 347.79 A: (( huh )) 

347.04 350.87 B: and especially since the nine eleven thing they don't 

351.09 364.43 B: they've really clamped down on it there's a policeman in the lobbies of all of them now you know 'cause it's a crowd of people and you could go in and do something foolish and hurt a whole bunch of people all at one time so they're pretty secure around here 

364.35 368.39 A: really did i'm sorry did you say washington state or washington d._c. 

367.73 369.57 B: washington state 

369.00 369.85 A: (( huh )) 

370.77 373.26 A: that's uh that's a surprise 

372.93 374.10 B: yeah 

373.51 376.48 A: is it another reason not to go to the movies i mean if 

375.96 377.67 B: yeah 

376.57 380.08 A: it's a if if there's a threat of terrorist attack i 

380.93 387.77 A: yeah [laughter] if if anything that that certainly makes movies somewhat less attractive 

387.29 389.44 B: yeah yeah 

388.65 395.04 A: that's ri- i hadn't i hadn't not like i said i haven't gone for a while but i hadn't even heard of that that's amazing 

394.65 396.33 B: yeah 

395.66 396.25 A: (( [mn] )) 

397.07 401.11 B: a lot of 'em you know they're pretty lapse about it i mean uh 

401.15 408.50 B: i don't think they'd have you arrested if you tried to sneak something in but there's n- notices at the door 

405.30 406.57 A: right 

408.48 422.33 B: telling you not to bring outside n- a- a- and i i would imagine a lot of that is based on the idea they want you to buy their stuff at their snack bar you know 'cause it's like tenfold more expensive than the outside stuff 

416.24 417.42 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

417.59 419.19 A: [laughter] right 

423.50 424.75 B: but uh 

427.09 438.07 B: yeah it's it's more attractive for me to sit and and like i said either buy the d._v._d. or like you were talking about wait 'til it comes on television and sit and watch watch it on t._v. 

427.17 428.07 A: wow 

437.95 439.56 A: absolutely 

438.98 443.88 B: you know if you got cable there's a you can get a lot of those showtime and 

443.93 457.21 B: but then again that's like being in the theater 'cause the like you said you can't fast forward through the boring stuff or go back and check on a scene you know hey what happened there and back it up and see again what happened and 

449.78 451.08 A: [laughter] right 

457.20 459.59 B: you just gotta watch it when it runs or 

460.05 462.42 A: yeah well that's that's uh 

462.44 469.74 A: i've become a a tivo uh uh missionary uh a- and and it's 

466.26 467.29 B: yeah 

469.83 472.44 A: it's uh it's amazing 

472.54 476.43 A: you know that that the change that it makes in your in your t._v. watching 

476.26 477.34 B: yeah 

476.74 477.87 A: but uh 

478.79 488.61 A: i mean it c- [sigh] it it and also like i said it it it gives you expectations for the rest of the world you know if you're if you're sitting on an airplane and watching a movie 

488.64 491.31 A: or if you're sitting in the theater a- and uh 

492.13 503.04 A: and you kind of miss a few words or something like on tivo you just rewind it and and hear it again but but [sigh] in in the theater on a plane or whatever uh whatever other venue you're in 

503.15 508.08 A: it uh yeah [laughter] i- it makes it makes you miss that function 

503.37 504.65 B: you can't 

504.97 506.13 B: yeah 

508.11 509.80 B: yeah 

508.68 510.03 A: (( [mn] um )) 

512.04 514.14 A: but uh [mn] 

515.25 517.11 A: oh well i guess uh 

519.82 526.08 A: [sigh] i guess w- w- w- did we did we cover all of their questions i did they ask us anything else 

526.12 527.93 B: not that i know of 

527.33 528.96 A: yeah 

529.78 530.93 B: but uh 

531.45 534.99 B: yeah for me for me d._v._d.s are uh 

532.40 534.06 A: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

535.59 537.21 B: (( or [mn] )) 

538.22 547.18 B: better better venue for watching movies than uh going to the theater it's definitely definitely cheaper from that point of view but 

545.15 546.03 A: (( uh-huh )) 

548.00 549.43 A: so are you uh 

548.24 549.46 B: sometimes 

551.40 553.94 A: i was just going to ask are are are are you uh 

554.31 559.93 A: forced to watch more children's movies than uh i i don't know how old your kids are uh but 

558.45 561.17 B: um well they're teenagers now 

560.62 562.40 A: oh okay [laughter] 

561.28 572.67 B: they're so it started out to be yeah they wanted all the they wanted to watch the go to the theater and see the disney this disney release whatever it was at the time but 

570.65 572.08 A: right 

573.03 574.15 B: um 

574.18 578.61 B: mostly now it's it's the action movie matrix and uh 

579.18 584.56 B: i got a i got a nineteen year old son and he can't wait for 

584.48 589.92 B: you know he come and asked the other day about when we go to the theater and see this newest matrix movie r- 

589.83 599.89 B: reloaded or whatever it is and i think i convinced him it'd be cheaper to wait until the d._v._d. comes out and purchase it and then we can watch it any old time we want to so 

591.50 592.44 A: yeah
