36.44 41.48 B: uh i think i i'm agreeing with you too you should read anything you can like you say depending on 

41.56 46.21 B: what the book is [sigh] and i'm quite sure they're not gonna give them kids you know 

46.08 47.16 A: yeah 

46.43 49.18 B: something crazy to read like you know you know what i mean 

49.18 52.25 A: yeah but uh 

52.68 57.61 A: [sigh] i think there there are books you know in the public library i wouldn't want my kids reading 

57.28 59.84 B: oh uh definitely i wouldn't i those books 

60.06 69.56 B: they got all sort of stuff there [sigh] in the library so it's you know yeah well then again now it's a good point where [sigh] maybe the kids may not know [sigh] 

69.80 72.26 B: what's good to read and what's not bad to read 

72.19 75.12 A: yeah yeah you gotta teach 'em huh 

72.84 74.20 B: so how would you you 

74.69 79.41 B: right so then you gotta decide you gotta go with the with the uh with the teacher [sigh] 

79.56 81.27 A: yeah 

80.54 83.15 B: i guess [mn] what you have to do is uh 

83.25 89.53 B: i guess you have [lipsmack] what do you call 'em um [lipsmack] what's the um what's the people who sit in the classroom 

89.38 90.50 A: proctors

96.78 98.33 A: mhm 

97.68 100.90 B: they get they go over that the books they're gonna read i'm quite sure [sigh] 

100.79 101.83 A: yeah 

100.95 105.75 B: but they wouldn't give the kids anything [sigh] inappropriate to read 

105.34 110.37 A: no we're i think i think we're talking about uh books that kids find on their own 

110.28 111.70 B: oh okay 

111.38 112.65 A: which they can mm 

112.43 117.80 B: yeah yeah so so i do i agree i well i say i say there's nothing wrong with it 

119.18 125.78 A: i think there are [lipsmack] there are kids though that uh [laughter] have to be teased away from every newsstand [mn] 

125.12 126.27 B: (( oh of course )) 

127.11 129.00 B: yeah yeah enough but um [sigh] 

129.04 133.81 B: you gonna have i- i- you gonna have ki- you gonna have bad kids you gonna have good kids 

133.52 134.61 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

134.02 139.54 B: you gonna have you gonna have um [mn] majority of the books and the majority of stuff that they read 

139.75 146.62 B: actually ninety eight percent is gonna be good it's gonna always be two per cent that somebody not gonna like or somebody not even gonna agree with 

145.80 150.59 A: yeah but every every kid you know is curious 

150.41 153.90 B: right every kid you know just like you were just like i was 

150.86 151.82 A: and i 

152.51 157.45 A: think [mn] if you tell him don't read that that's exactly what he's gonna want to read 

156.77 160.39 B: yeah right yeah exactly [sigh] but but i still say 

160.44 163.99 B: if you asked me i still say it's it's nothing wrong with with it 

164.02 165.09 A: mhm 

164.43 175.61 B: there's nothing wrong with it and you're gonna be curious anyway so i say it's nothing wrong with it if you asking my opinion should you do it or not [sigh] yes go ahead and do it 

168.15 169.25 A: (( oh yeah yeah yeah )) 

176.44 184.55 B: 'cause like you said they gonna be curious and you tell 'em not to do it they gonna do it anyway so just let 'em go ahead [sigh] and that's the way the new they probably can learn better you know 

184.57 187.73 A: yeah but uh be prepared for questions 

186.98 190.66 B: [mn] be prepared for questions and and 

190.96 195.95 B: [mn] things things don't go the way you want all the s- all the time but majority of stuff in life do you know 

195.87 197.01 A: mhm 

196.42 209.81 B: what i mean as long as long as you stay on top of your kids and [sigh] you know they good kids and you know you can you can uh you know decipher what they decipher what they do but [mn] a little bit of stuff won't get through anyway the bad stuff 

203.72 205.39 A: yeah i think 

208.44 209.25 A: yeah 

209.72 216.74 A: i i think if you you know if you're if you interact with your kids and stay with 'em the schools can't hurt 'em much 

216.27 220.17 B: right and it's gonna be a little bad gonna float around in there anyway 

219.92 220.98 A: yeah 

220.26 222.55 B: and but with the majority it's gonna be good uh 

222.45 227.66 A: yeah they don't know you know th- you can't teach 'em to reject garbage until they know what it is 

227.05 234.00 B: that's right that's exactly that's exactly right so so i go with let 'em go let 'em do it it's nothing wrong with it that's my opinion 

233.93 234.76 A: (( mm )) 

234.50 236.55 B: and you say the same thing 

236.73 242.74 B: except for you know like we like we just saying it's gonna be a little in distressing is all anything that's going on anyway
