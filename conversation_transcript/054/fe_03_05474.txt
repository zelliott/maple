39.07 48.67 A: [noise] i don't really like the smell of smoke on my clothes but the city is built on this on that industry the hospital- i mean the hospitality industry and [noise] and at least for me 

49.20 60.32 A: [noise] it's coming at the wrong time i mean [noise] it's like if there's this many complaints about this stuff then [noise] this and also the economy's not that great right now 

60.17 74.19 A: and i mean it's it's actually affecting business i wouldn't wanna [noise] you know i [noise] i think it's [noise] you know if they wanna [noise] do this why can't they just separate [noise] these bars or [noise] put in a s- put in a um you know filtration system or something 

73.07 75.09 B: do you think it is affecting business 

75.78 83.79 A: i heard a lot of people saying this to me that work in bars and [noise] you know it is [noise] that's what they say i mean

108.07 120.61 B: you know it it cleared the air i have to admit it's clearer inside but i think it's a little more inconvenient 'cause people like to drink and smoke and now they have to stop what they're doing and go outside and you know smoke their cigarette then come back in and finish their drink 

109.34 112.31 A: all right [noise] [noise] [noise]

121.49 132.28 B: you you know what i i think that you know i don't know all these bans you know you can't smoke in a stadium you can't smoke here i mean it's almost taking away people's rights to do what they wanna do 

130.08 131.58 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

131.59 145.71 A: [noise] yeah that's along with others [noise] i mean yeah i i would have to agree you know it's like [noise] i mean it's already [sigh] it's already hard enough to live here i i think and [noise] 

145.54 156.50 A: you know they're increasing they increase the subway it's like what what are they trying to do are they trying to uh you know turn people away from coming i mean of course people are gonna still come here but [noise] 

148.20 150.32 B: exactly right that 

155.62 156.48 B: i 

156.56 158.56 A: (( uh so )) 

157.99 164.24 B: all all these restrictions that they're putting on us is it's ridiculous it really is ridiculous um 

163.62 164.99 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

164.38 170.28 B: you know there's too much in their taxes the cigarettes are like six fifty seven dollars for a pack of cigarettes it's just

170.43 175.07 B: you know amazing people still paying that amount of money to smoke um 

173.40 174.89 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] i know )) 

175.25 176.79 A: [noise] and then you realize 

175.34 176.47 B: i

178.00 179.24 A: yeah 

181.35 183.36 A: yeah totally [noise] 

182.58 187.95 B: it's just that i don't know bloomberg is a little crazy anyway i think he's getting out of control he's running 

186.63 188.08 A: (( yeah i mean he )) 

188.33 196.66 A: i mean this guy doesn't i mean the i mean i'm not a native new yorker but you know all i can say is i mean this guy's what the twenty third richest man in the world 

196.40 197.63 B: (( right exactly )) 

196.71 201.72 A: i mean he could give a rat's ass about this i mean he probably doesn't smoke i mean 

201.42 202.45 B: right 

202.54 206.32 A: but say you're coming from out of town let's get hypothetical you know 

206.19 210.51 A: coming out of town you spend some money in this city [noise] a business person whatever 

210.35 222.93 A: you're doing business here you go out [noise] i could just see it a table of guys from texas or whatever wherever they're from they sit down and they're like and maybe they forgot or whatever but they spending like [mn] 

221.25 222.31 B: (( right exac- )) 

222.76 226.45 A: you know in a bar maybe your bar whoever's bar you know and it's like 

225.83 226.75 B: right 

226.88 228.85 A: now they're all gonna walk outside 

229.21 230.19 A: i mean 

229.51 236.30 B: exactly and that's what they're doing 'cause i see you know it's very crowded outside the bar because everyone has to go out there to smoke 

236.24 237.54 A: yeah 

236.75 244.69 B: little more noisier for the neighborhood because people are outside talking now whereas if they're busy inside talking and smoking um 

240.81 242.64 A: right 

244.65 253.35 B: i don't know bloomberg's just out of control you know he's running the city like a business and it's not a business it's a city so you you can't really run it the same way 

250.59 251.97 A: yeah 

253.43 257.66 B: but you know i i i don't know how far they're gonna go with this smoking you know 

257.74 260.53 A: [noise] well you know if uh i mean 

260.68 261.51 A: (( [noise] )) 

261.82 264.33 A: i don't know [sigh] it's it's uh 

264.66 269.87 A: it's just gonna make it messier outside [noise] and then when the winter comes i mean i can't even 

268.73 269.75 B: (( exactly )) 

270.10 275.61 A: our last winter was was was [noise] was bitterly cold here and i mean like [noise] 

275.82 279.00 A: i don't know something's [noise] something's gonna have to give i guess 

279.07 279.85 B: (( exactly )) 

279.21 288.02 A: you know i i mean how many [noise] people are gonna go out on a roof top bar you know like 'cause now that's like a new trend like hotels are making roof top bars and you know 

284.56 285.48 B: right 

286.91 290.34 B: exactly right it's just that you know it's 

290.20 290.76 A: (( [noise] )) 

290.54 295.02 B: you know it like you said the economy's is really not that great right now and you know 

295.05 297.46 B: to lose any customers is you know 

297.34 297.98 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

297.99 299.65 B: hurting e- everyone 

299.95 300.90 B: but 

300.02 302.68 A: [cough] yeah 

301.00 311.39 B: so i don't think it's like i said it's just you know he's enforced it now and i thought they wouldn't really you know enforce it but they actually people coming out to the to the locations to check on that 

311.35 317.40 B: you know if they get a complaint then you have someone out there looking to make sure no one is smoking and you you know you get a heavy fine 

312.73 314.08 A: [noise] 

316.70 318.98 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah the fines )) 

319.41 326.16 B: 'cause i think it i i think in the city my friend says in some of the clubs they still smoke um 

319.48 320.66 A: and you know 

323.70 333.35 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] well actually i went to this like this organization i kind of volunteer for they they had like um 

333.99 337.18 A: [noise] uh shit [laughter] they they had um 

338.27 352.38 A: they had like a party but it was like a closed [noise] like a you know in other words you had to like have a like you're part of this organization you go to this movie then you go to this thing after like adrian brodie film like in he's from queens that way anyways but um [laughter] 

350.80 351.99 B: (( you know right )) 

352.13 353.79 B: [laughter] 

352.29 360.32 A: but anyway it's like no but i was gonna say it was at the coral room which is in the meatpacking district and the people were smoking there bec- the doors were closed 

357.30 358.20 B: right 

359.76 362.04 B: exactly right yeah 

360.73 367.86 A: so so maybe speakeasies are gonna [noise] like maybe the whole underground bar thing will come back or something i don't know 

367.04 369.81 B: yeah because you know it's the same thing 

368.95 370.18 A: prohibition 

370.25 375.56 B: yeah 'cause it you know a lot of things when they start cracking down on you know it just goes underground instead 

374.22 376.21 A: [laughter] 

375.98 381.24 B: and i don't you know that's what happens with a lot of these things when they crack down they start different 

379.82 381.49 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

381.07 385.41 B: regulations like juliani you know with his gestapo tactics um 

385.22 399.13 B: things just go underground instead so you know there'll there'll always going to be a place where people i think will be able to smoke and like you said eventually maybe that will be you know the trend and that's where people will be going when they just wanna be relaxed and smoke and do what the hell they want 

388.05 389.17 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] ))
