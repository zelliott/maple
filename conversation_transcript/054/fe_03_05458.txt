229.01 230.31 B: right 

229.29 243.01 A: so it's i don't do it on a regular whenever it's on it's always available to me it's you know [mn] but i watch the b._b._c. news every once in a while which i find interesting particularly during the the most recent conflict that we were involved in 

242.78 244.03 B: (( that was so )) 

243.36 246.50 A: it was interesting to hear the british because they took a 

246.57 247.45 A: um 

247.75 256.82 A: i think they were a harder line against administration than we were in this country for it [laughter] and so it was interesting to hear the news in regard to that situation 

249.39 250.25 B: [laughter] 

250.74 251.62 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

256.09 270.06 B: [noise] well we have the ah b._b._c. news ah monday through friday on um one of our educational channels at six o'clock which is a very convenient hour six o'clock in the evening 

264.85 265.93 A: okay 

268.55 270.38 A: right 

270.42 274.71 B: and then i i sometimes catch b._b._c. on the car radio too 

274.51 279.07 A: oh really and i of course i do listen to the ah pub broadcast 

278.48 279.74 B: mhm 

279.13 287.42 A: um [lipsmack] ah the the public broadcasting in this area is um i i i'm not that i don't know why i it's hard to get on the car radio 

287.60 291.71 B: ours is pretty good we've got ah about five stations 

288.70 289.75 A: um 

291.08 302.42 A: well see we have the con- we have so much congestion here as our cities [laughter] you know you got to have a certain model of rain for philadelphia which where i live and then and then all of a sudden you're 

295.96 297.85 B: oh i yes i know 

302.51 308.45 A: all of sudden picking up overlapping baltimore bands overlapping new york bands so i did 

307.41 309.75 B: twitching back and forth [laughter] 

308.47 317.17 A: yeah and i never or the numbers don't make sense so i have trouble following it but i do i do like that i used to get the christian saints monitor 

318.17 323.41 B: i haven't seen that in years i mean it was one little paper i know 

322.30 327.33 A: yeah i got it i got that until i moved where i live now two years ago and i just never 

327.90 332.94 A: i just stunted it i don't know why i never picked it up again but i i used to really enjoy that they ah 

329.04 329.92 B: mhm 

333.64 334.64 A: they had a 

334.82 338.41 A: a lo- th- they never seemed to editorialize the news 

338.60 339.89 B: no that's true 

339.64 345.88 A: which i like i hate it when the allan or somebody gives me his opinion but i i 

344.41 346.55 B: [laughter] which he's going to 

346.02 352.34 A: yes that's that right and he feels since he makes a couple of million dollars he has the right to i don't think they have the right to i just want to hear them 

351.93 353.16 B: [laughter] i just 

352.59 360.77 A: you know walter kronkite gave you the news i guess i'm old enough just to want the news let me fill out what it means [laughter] um 

358.10 359.71 B: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

360.89 364.86 A: i do do you pay more attention to the national the international or the local 

365.44 373.17 B: well [sigh] [laughter] that's just i probably boy it's a toss up right now um 

373.49 377.82 B: we've got lots of things going on locally which i 

378.14 383.24 B: sometimes disagree with and nationally too and internationally [laughter] ah 

379.98 380.78 A: (( [noise] )) 

384.09 386.15 B: i i think it's about 

387.09 389.04 B: a third each right now 

388.82 392.10 A: really i almost ignore local 

389.58 390.42 B: yeah 

392.15 395.46 A: because it seems it's not new 

395.83 396.80 B: well 

395.98 408.71 A: i i mean that's the way i i mean we don't have any big agendas going on right now so it's just it's youth violence that has become almost common place i'm not proud of it i'm not saying i shouldn't but 

408.77 409.56 A: (( [sigh] )) 

409.45 416.09 A: it's just one after the other another house fire and three people are burnt to death that's a regular occuren- you know 

409.52 411.54 B: mhm no right 

415.78 416.90 B: exactly 

415.97 425.77 A: and so just i have now during the election year or something i i get a little more involved in it but um i think i'm more concerned about national 

425.48 437.20 B: well we have right now ah things going on locally such as um raising our sales tax one percent to nine and a half percent and um 

435.46 436.43 A: oh 

437.32 447.27 B: care not cash which would give ah people on welfare only fifty six dollars in cash a month and supply the rest of it in services 

446.85 447.80 A: (( mm )) 

447.35 451.98 B: to be supplied by a huge new br- bureaucracy [laughter] 

450.61 454.96 A: [laughter] at a special rate [laughter] 

452.27 461.82 B: and we've got [laughter] right and we've got just lots and lots of corruption 

461.39 465.68 A: oh well we that see that's common place in philadelphia too i mean 

463.97 466.80 B: right [laughter] 

466.45 468.67 A: our mayor has more relatives 

468.71 475.88 A: than you can imagine but see i and so that's why the local paper i think has become very weak with their national news although 

475.32 476.23 B: uh-huh 

475.97 485.83 A: i do i do read it subscribe to it and get it on a regular basis and i think that's why i favor the new york times because they still have a very large national and international 

485.96 486.95 A: um 

486.98 488.74 A: reporting section 

488.16 490.39 B: the inquirer is knight ridder isn't it 

490.27 491.50 A: yes it is 

490.76 491.99 B: (( i thought so )) 

491.95 493.90 A: yeah and ah 

494.40 504.06 A: what choice do you have i mean don't don't they own si- if it's not r- owned by that australian it's owned by knight ridder right murdoch or yeah whatever his name is 

495.65 496.94 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

500.75 503.12 B: (( murdoch you can have right )) 

503.46 504.57 B: yeah 

504.07 516.19 A: um so if um you know and of course with the i guess the new as far as current event tracking goes i guess the the the most read information in as far as that goes is is ah 

516.20 522.74 A: ah aren't they trying to figure out whether you're allowed to own all of the newspapers and all the radio stations in the country 

521.81 523.40 B: ah yes 

523.14 526.84 A: [laughter] [laughter] which which would be great for guys like crystal 

527.06 538.25 A: i- if he could own all of them or whoever's on the left um but i i find that the newspaper's diminishing in in in giving me what i want 

527.48 528.95 B: absolutely 

538.91 541.05 A: and i've never been impressed with television 

540.81 542.08 B: (( ah )) 

541.94 544.09 A: six o'clock news that sort of thing 

543.19 550.25 B: well you know when i say television i mean watching my six o'clock b._b._c. news [laughter] and um 

548.26 550.31 A: yeah see that's it i don't 

550.79 554.85 B: no ah television news does not impress me in general 

553.71 554.69 A: yeah 

554.95 569.10 A: have you ever seen the lair report ah see now i i i like that now um the last couple of months i've been traveling a lot so i've missed it because i've been all over the country but um i always like that i always found that they picked most topics that are h- 

556.60 557.73 B: yes
