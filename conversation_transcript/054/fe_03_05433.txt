1.06 3.80 B: [sigh] the schools yes hello [sigh] 

1.45 2.66 A: (( [noise] hello )) 

3.41 4.33 A: hi 

4.89 6.43 A: my name is bobby 

5.84 7.51 B: yes my name is jack 

8.28 9.52 A: [noise] nice to meet you 

10.34 13.84 B: [sigh] i assume we're to be talking about the school system 

13.28 14.48 A: (( [sigh] y- yes )) 

14.82 19.37 A: public schools and [noise] the po- what's potentially wrong with them 

18.78 26.54 B: right the school systems i think in the united states m- mainly are in a good s- situation except that i think that in many areas [sigh] 

26.66 30.92 B: they lack good security [sigh] they lack good teachers [sigh] 

31.14 37.98 B: and they lack enough ah fu- funds to support [noise] many of the programs that should be done [sigh] 

37.90 52.55 B: i think ah teachers themselves in fact [sigh] are involved with almost a billion dollars in their own money [sigh] throughout the united states in buying supplies for their s- students which they shouldn't have to do 

49.95 51.22 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] i agree )) 

52.93 59.62 B: [sigh] and ah i think there are a lot of examples of this everywhere including my own daughter who spends her own money [sigh] 

59.76 61.98 B: ah for her students 

61.12 64.22 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] oh she's a teacher as well 

62.43 63.45 B: so 

63.80 68.75 B: well she's actually a speech language pathologist and she works with the school system 

68.38 69.51 A: oh okay 

69.52 70.09 A: (( [noise] )) 

70.93 72.25 B: (( [sigh] and there's ah )) 

72.33 82.50 B: e- even in that situation she needs supplies which the school system doesn't support [sigh] and she has to go out and buy them and i understand that the full extent of the 

82.54 88.85 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] the actual amount of money that is spent by these teachers is really a billion dollars close to a billion dollars a year 

88.44 99.06 A: yeah yeah i i would believe it they they need to be able to equip the the teachers with with what they need to do their job and and to give these kids the education they deserve there's [sigh] too many [sigh] 

99.27 111.62 A: a- ah areas where you know the the schools are are getting [noise] [sigh] you know unsatisfactory r- ratings for you know the the type of students they're turning out [sigh] [noise] 

110.99 117.53 B: exactly and i think there's a lot of situations in there where the teachers themselves are not really very good teachers i have been ah 

117.98 130.44 B: [sigh] a a substitute teacher my w- wife has been a substitute teacher a- ah for a period of time and we find out that [sigh] when we take over classes that the lessons aren't prepared well that the teachers themselves 

130.34 133.37 B: [sigh] do not even have ah 

133.72 145.48 B: [noise] classes in which that are neat that are clean that are available to the students that where they can get information [sigh] we see some tests and we see some work that's done by students [sigh] 

145.46 153.86 B: that are not even read by the teachers because we know they just shoved in their drawer [sigh] there's dust in them there there's food in there 

150.16 151.34 A: (( [sigh] uh-hum )) 

153.54 154.65 A: oh wow 

153.65 166.11 B: [sigh] and it's not the the question of every teacher like that but there are so many teachers that are like that that ah because they're on tenure [sigh] nobody can do anything about them and um we have seen [sigh] w- w- 

165.93 180.06 B: hours and days and weeks that were um literally wasted because teachers don't leave good lesson plans [sigh] they leave things to be done that are just you know what the kids call just busy work [sigh] 

178.93 182.36 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [sigh] uh-hum yeah lack of organization huh [noise] [noise] 

179.90 181.41 B: and um 

181.59 189.56 B: absolutely and there are a lot of teachers like that that are just getting away with it [sigh] and nobody seems to know what the circumstances are 

189.35 201.13 A: well that and the i i would think in a lot of ways they probably f- feel under appreciated too you know they're they're not getting the money that that they deserve my my cousin is a school teacher at our old high school and 

194.72 196.38 B: oh absolutely they're 

200.45 210.53 B: i agree a lot of the teachers are under ap- under appreciated and a lot of them are very excellent and i'm not just talking down at the ones that are just bad but there are very very good teachers there too 

210.30 211.31 A: (( uh-hum [noise] )) 

210.60 224.24 B: [sigh] ah we come across those that [sigh] that a- ah have been in our opinion because we see it from the outside that are really good teachers [sigh] and it's just such a pleasure to see them but there are others that just [sigh] 

224.15 231.40 B: i think w- waste money waste the school system waste the students' lives waste their time it's just a shame 

231.23 241.85 A: [noise] [mn] well what i'm not liking seeing is is the way that that it [sigh] ah it it appears that you know mediocrity [noise] is is just [sigh] 

242.05 245.02 A: you know becoming too much of the norm [noise] 

245.03 251.17 A: [sigh] you know ah this this i- idea of of you know [sigh] [noise] 

251.37 253.60 A: like [laughter] general laziness 

253.48 255.18 B: i agree with that 

253.84 259.48 A: i see and and you know maybe in some ways you know students are picking it up from their teachers [sigh] 

259.51 263.81 A: ah you know maybe they're not putting it across a positive enough message 

263.70 275.00 A: to you know take pride in yourself take pride in your work and and [sigh] you know [noise] ah hold yourself to a higher standard and ah i've i've taught guitar for many years 

275.10 277.71 A: [noise] and ah i don't i don't do it any more [sigh] 

277.58 289.66 A: but something that happened with that was [noise] is i get i was starting to get too too high of a turnover of of my students because [sigh] they would come to me thinking that [sigh] 

289.46 292.91 A: they could take a couple of lessons and they were just ready to go [sigh] 

293.09 306.99 A: and they they didn't want to take the time to [noise] learn the instrument [noise] learn the music learn it well [sigh] you know they they they'd it was just [laughter] they were just content with with mediocrity 

306.34 309.79 B: oh i agree with you there i've seen to many instances myself 

307.86 314.60 A: and and it it's a total total shame you know [noise] and you you think well you know if if if if if that's how they're 

314.73 321.11 A: um handling that then how how do they handle you know other parts of their lives [sigh] 

320.51 326.51 B: i i see ah we have been my wife and i have both have been substitute teachers at various times [sigh] where [sigh] 

326.42 337.85 B: we've seen the students just have no concern over what they're doing don't care what they're doing so i'm not blaming it only on the teachers [sigh] but i think if they had teachers that are more competent some times and make school interesting 

333.11 334.12 A: (( uh-hum [noise] )) 

338.08 349.25 B: [sigh] maybe they can turn some of these students around but i y- you know we look at these kids that ah are approaching [sigh] the tenth eleventh and twelfth grades and are graduating we say where are they going to go from here 

348.67 349.93 A: (( uh-hum )) 

349.30 358.44 B: they just don't have the ability and i think sometimes [sigh] even the school systems [sigh] make sure that they graduate because 

356.54 359.78 A: [noise] [sigh] yeah they just want to push 'em through and and [noise] [noise] 

358.63 372.19 B: they want to push them through and they get monies of course from those who graduate and monies for those [sigh] who are passing and and it's just it's just a shame because it's a [sigh] it the the kids are the ones who really are [sigh] going to 

372.25 374.29 B: (( um f- um )) 

374.74 380.73 B: a- are not going to be very [sigh] good at their futures because of this [sigh] good in the future 

379.31 383.17 A: [noise] [noise] and then they're going to be the ones taking care of us when we're [laughter] older 

382.13 384.11 B: (( absolutely man [sigh] [noise] )) 

383.11 392.44 A: now what kind of future are are we getting for ourselves i mean you know they they have to stop and think [noise] that hey you know the the these kids are 

392.32 395.97 A: our future leaders shouldn't we put a little more more stock [sigh] 

395.81 410.49 A: now should should more you know federal mandates be put in place or or state or is it you know or or does it start at at [sigh] just kind of a more of a local level and and try and work its way out [noise] 

409.89 417.68 B: [sigh] well i know that the lotteries of course have been contributing to the schools system but i guess they need a lot more than what the lotteries bring in too also 

417.66 431.56 A: [sigh] they they must if if like you said you know in in the beginning of the conversation with all these teachers [sigh] having to spend a lot of their own money [sigh] just to be able to you know teach the class you know that they're supposed to teach 

417.77 418.92 B: um 

431.39 441.62 B: i think m- my daughter told me that she spent spent much as much as three hundred dollars last year [sigh] of her own money [sigh] on supplies which is a lot of money you know for a teacher [noise] 

438.98 440.06 A: (( y- yeah )) 

440.19 445.10 A: yeah it is i mean when when you figure [sigh] you know um 

445.71 454.17 A: [noise] a pack of pencils and erasers you know they're they're just you know [sigh] not not all that much so you figure if if she racked up three hundred bucks 

454.19 457.58 A: you know that's that is some cash to be laid out for supplies 

455.77 458.64 B: it is over a period of years sure it is 

458.07 463.59 A: i mean you know a poster board is [sigh] you know well under a buck and stuff [noise] 

461.31 473.65 B: it may sound like only twenty five dollars a a well let me see over over a nine month period that's right or a ten month period a nine month period [sigh] so it's about thirty or forty dollars a m- month but that's a [laughter] lot of money [sigh] 

472.44 476.94 A: yeah and and they definitely shouldn't be spending that themselves [sigh] 

476.32 477.68 B: exactly [noise] 

476.89 485.71 A: you know there there there needs to be you know if [sigh] if if if there's a curriculum that is supposed to be taught [sigh] then 

485.58 494.58 A: you know it should be known [sigh] what is needed to be able to you know get a child through that class [sigh] and um 

494.81 503.85 A: t- the classroom should be supplied and you know the the children should be you know ah given 

504.12 510.05 A: you know notice of of what what needs to be in you know brought in [noise] so the parents can can equip them 

509.44 511.97 B: [noise] agreed and the other thing i think that is also [sigh] 

510.66 523.52 A: i mean being that it is public school i mean you know we're the ones that pay for that but [sigh] you know the bottom line is is the teachers shouldn't have to pay out of their own pocket when they're not m- making a great salary themselves [noise] [noise] 

518.49 521.05 B: absolutely i agree with you 

522.39 533.14 B: another thing i think that's very important in s- some of the schools especially in some of the bad areas is s- security i know that we have been substitute teachers in an area in miami which 

533.39 544.40 B: [sigh] wasn't a good area and yet the security was not really that good and and people ah came in from the outside [sigh] that weren't even in the school [sigh] 

537.99 539.43 A: (( mm [noise] )) 

544.16 549.84 B: and sometimes the kids would just walk right out of the classes because no one would stop them 

549.46 550.41 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

549.90 562.38 B: and it was just it's just a shame to see things like this happen but it's just because there's no control by the principals by the [sigh] school system by the security and of course it takes a lot of money and i don't know where they're going to get this money 

561.42 563.60 A: ye- yeah their under staffed [sigh] 

563.00 564.23 B: right 

563.60 573.14 A: yeah 'cause now not only do we have to worry about you know [sigh] ah the -the kind of teachers that that are in [noise] our schools teaching our kids and [sigh] you know [sigh] 

573.12 588.07 A: ah and we already know what kind of salaries they make now these schools have to hire security and put in cameras and [laughter] it's like jeeze you know if if if [noise] things were in dire straits before [noise] now you know 

588.10 589.88 A: [noise] how's that money going to come 

589.86 599.89 B: [noise] [sigh] well i became a substitute school system after i retired i was working for n._b._c. television for a long time for about thirty years [sigh] and i 

598.64 599.76 A: (( uh-hum ))
