53.89 55.27 B: (( [noise] uh-huh [noise] [noise] )) 

57.97 70.05 A: chasing girls instead of being more serious about school and now with the economy the way it is uh it's been very difficult for me to uh make ends meet so

115.85 125.61 A: paying for the uh the mid east crisis over there and then trying to create new jobs here that's going to be uh quite a herculean task

125.26 128.63 B: yeah yeah um um 

128.80 135.33 B: [lipsmack] i can't say that i agree with uh with anything that's going on in that department with the government

400.30 401.74 B: exactly 

401.96 409.93 B: and i i had a host friend over there from high school and i just went and visited him and uh basically hung out with him for like a week and a half two weeks

418.96 421.07 B: for the first time 

419.03 428.61 A: yeah i missed it uh i missed it uh last night but yeah it looks pretty good i mean there's so many of these shows now where they kind of uh 

429.14 438.84 A: i don't like watch people uh either openly or secretly and that was sort of the forerunner i think like ten or eleven years ago was the first one in new york city 

438.25 440.54 B: right right 

439.21 445.02 A: and now there's been so many of these reality based shows that have jumped on the bandwagon 

444.96 452.58 B: yeah yeah i i don't know if it's the fau- if i can say it's the fault of the real world or uh if it's the uh 

447.01 448.23 A: (( so [noise] )) 

452.76 455.99 B: you know the grace of the real real world 

455.93 468.83 A: yeah i don't know i mean it's getting so ridiculous there's so many of these shows now i mean after anna nicole smith i didn't think uh they could dredge the bottom any deeper but 

458.64 460.91 B: (( [laughter] [noise] yeah )) 

463.10 464.33 B: [laughter] 

469.05 471.97 A: you know now you never can tell 

471.49 475.51 B: [noise] yeah the anna nicole smith show is is fabulous 

472.52 473.27 A: (( uh )) 

475.59 476.47 B: uh 

475.64 481.00 A: [laughter] i don't know i think i could use another adjective to describe it but uh 

479.57 481.85 B: [laughter] 

481.13 492.36 A: uh boy i mean i don't know i mean years ago when she wasn't so heavy she was attractive but now she re- really let herself go and that seems to be the center piece of the whole 

492.51 498.24 A: theme of the show like you know watch her overly indulge in anything she wants to do 

497.87 506.80 B: i don't know if they're like bitch about whatnot and just whine and and just not overall just not be that intelligent [laughter] you know 

506.28 510.82 A: well she's waiting for that finally to get that settlement you know the uh [lipsmack] 

510.93 521.98 A: uh her that old guy the oil guy that died uh his son has been contesting it and i think uh he's practically exhausted every appeal 

514.08 516.28 B: right right 

521.79 522.96 B: (( uh )) 

522.34 527.87 A: but she's supposed to get like i don't know something like uh fifty eight million dollars 

528.16 529.22 B: wow 

528.71 529.74 A: (( yeah i )) 

529.83 531.36 B: it's ridiculous 

531.11 534.22 A: that's like hitting uh the mega millions 

533.56 538.13 B: yeah but she also had to uh marry an old guy for a long time 

537.40 544.81 A: yeah well i don't know how long it was for a few years but uh i guess she realized she'd outlive him 

542.23 543.92 B: right 

544.72 547.47 B: right [laughter] yeah i think that was [noise] 

547.50 549.05 A: (( oh uh i )) 

548.21 551.28 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

550.63 551.93 A: guess that's it i 

551.37 553.61 B: (( [noise] uh i don't know )) 

553.03 554.81 A: don't know what that is 

554.21 557.50 B: that's that sounds like a malfunction of some sort 

556.56 561.35 A: [laughter] it seems to be a lot of that going around 

558.65 560.02 B: [noise] 

560.77 562.26 B: yeah 

562.01 568.91 A: what do they do uh i think i know i just asked you that what do they do prompt you after ten minutes and say it's over or 

567.87 574.54 B: [noise] [noise] yeah after ten minutes a voice comes on and just says uh your ten minutes is up you have uh thirty seconds 

571.03 573.01 A: (( oh comes uh okay )) 

573.27 576.21 A: we've definitely spoken more than ten minutes 

576.14 577.68 B: uh has it been 

577.03 581.97 A: yeah i think so maybe we're not on the topic maybe that's why they keep delaying it 

581.57 593.31 B: no because the first time i didn't even hear the topic and the other lady didn't seem to uh [noise] pay any pay any attention to it but i think it i think it's been about ten minutes i think uh we may have about one more minute left 

586.12 586.98 A: right 

592.63 594.06 A: (( uh okay )) 

593.48 595.51 B: maybe less because i think it was uh 

595.68 599.63 B: i was looking at my clock it was six thirty seven now it's six forty seven 

597.87 599.89 A: oh i see i see
