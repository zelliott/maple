109.87 111.03 B: yeah like 

115.01 126.23 B: yeah well i used to be a [noise] high school teacher and i'd go out and i'd once in a while hang out with the smokers on the smokers' corner just talk with them 'cause the kids liked me a lot and you know we'd talk and they'd say 

126.08 132.83 B: yeah every single one of them it was funny every single one of them said yeah i wanna quit but i can't now 

132.84 137.56 B: [noise] and i'm like so what got [noise] you started [noise] most of them either 

137.47 150.29 B: [noise] their friends and or [noise] their parents smoked almost every one of them came from a house that smoked and kids smoked there and so but [noise] uh every one of them was like yeah i don't like it now i wish i could quit 

150.15 161.24 B: i'm like you can if you want they said no way now i kind of understand i found out that uh [noise] last quarter we did uh [noise] addictive drugs and um 

150.66 151.81 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

161.39 163.42 B: [noise] one of the things they mentioned is 

163.54 174.63 B: nicotine unlike some of the other drugs like [noise] cocaine and the amphetamines and things like that they actually stimulate the [noise] euphoria center of the brain nicotine doesn't [noise] do that so [noise] they're not 

174.50 181.22 B: sure exactly how nicotine's doing it but they say in studies it's about as [noise] addictive as heroin so 

181.44 186.45 B: if you're [noise] you know hooked on nicotine or hooked on heroin you have about the same 

186.28 197.77 B: success rate of getting off the stuff which i thought was kind of interesting but anyway i guess that's not quite the topic the topic's supposed to be like what what do we think about smoking in public places or [noise] [noise] 

196.87 206.69 A: [noise] [noise] yeah well they were talking about i guess uh the fact that [noise] most that most public places [noise] now don't allow smoking and then [noise] i guess the second the second part of the topic was um 

207.08 209.39 A: uh something about 

209.56 210.85 A: (( [noise] uh )) 

211.21 212.68 A: i guess [noise] 

212.74 221.16 A: quitting class there were just the different ways that that people the different [noise] processes i suppose that people use to try to quit 

219.42 222.86 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] um [noise] [noise] )) 

221.50 225.18 A: um i think it's messed up and [noise] i i mean 

225.53 231.50 A: like i i've i've [noise] ridden the train a few times [noise] going back and forth [noise] between here and uh connecticut 

231.56 233.16 A: and uh 

232.97 239.21 A: [noise] even on the train man you [noise] can't even smoke on the [noise] train any longer you know what i mean and and people [laughter] i was 

236.17 237.20 B: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

239.11 248.40 A: in the bathroom man smoking cigars you know what i mean it was sick and then like hiding them in my uh hi- i wear a kangol i wear i got a bunch of different kangols 

241.35 242.90 B: [laughter] 

248.46 250.59 A: uh you know what a kangol is 

250.14 252.70 B: [noise] no i have no idea [noise] 

250.85 262.22 A: it's the cap with the little kangaroo symbol the white kangaroo [noise] symbol on [noise] it's like a and they're made in england [noise] they call 'em kangols it's like [noise] k. a. n. g. o. l. anyway 

256.19 258.19 B: (( okay i think i know what you're talk- [noise] )) 

262.78 272.62 A: [noise] i would hide the cigar back in the like in my hat when i went back to uh it was just it was crazy man i felt like a i felt like a drug addict [noise] or something you know like going back to my chair 

270.44 275.32 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

273.92 283.83 A: but uh [noise] and then you see people like [noise] in between trains [noise] like i mean like [noise] w- the the little little part i guess like in between [noise] in between cars of the train [noise] 

283.90 284.87 A: uh 

285.01 294.64 A: where you have where [noise] where there's like a little where you can actually get off of the train those little spaces [noise] people would be out there like hanging their heads off you know smoking and stuff [noise] 

289.22 290.67 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

294.93 302.71 A: and i was doing that but i mean some so- i mean it's good like you know nobody really wants [noise] wants to be in a if you're eating [noise] like i 

295.15 296.66 B: [noise] [noise] 

302.76 314.33 A: you know even if i go to a restaurant i sometimes go into restaurants and you're eating and there [noise] even [noise] even in the section even if you're in the [noise] in the no smoking section [noise] you can still kind of smell the smoke 

313.82 315.27 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] right [noise] [lipsmack] )) 

314.70 321.26 A: from the people smoking in the smoking section that is kind of nasty [noise] you know what i mean it's kind of it's not very uh 

321.54 324.48 A: [noise] doesn't do anything for your meal put it that way 

324.35 335.67 B: yeah you know i have [noise] mixed feelings on it because like as far as politics go i'm either far right or far left depends on the issue and like with guns and things i'm all for 'em 

335.65 347.32 B: and i think you know the assault rifle ban and everything's just a [noise] bunch of politics and it's going against the constitution [noise] but if you ask me about the environment i'm a tree hugger so neither democrats or republicans would want me 

347.30 360.26 B: um as far as this issues goes you know personally like i said i can't stand the smell of the stuff so i think it's great because you know it gives me i get headaches and things like that when i'm exposed to it 

359.49 361.01 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] wow [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

360.28 373.83 B: and but at the same time you know i understand if someone wants to do that it's kind of their right but at the same time when they do it it kind of spreads around so whether you want to [noise] or not you're also taking the stuff in 

373.97 386.45 B: so like i said i know i have a [noise] strong bias on the issue so i'm not too well balanced on it but i'd be like yeah get it all out of the public's faces but at the same time i don't like when people like try and tread on my rights [noise] 

386.76 399.02 B: and things that i enjoy so yeah i'm kind of uh in between in that area [noise] but uh just figure you know the more government gets involved in anything the more it starts to get messed up 

399.05 401.46 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah the government is [noise] is )) 

401.56 404.94 A: [laughter] i'm not even gonna [noise] get on the government 'cause that's that's a uh 

405.16 409.32 A: (( that's not what we're supposed to be talking about but [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

406.98 419.75 B: [noise] actually well it's government controlling the issue i mean [noise] it's public policy so [noise] um i guess if i were to throw in my vote i'd say i'm all for [noise] 

419.77 432.35 B: banning smoking in public places but i also understand why i'm that way 'cause i am so biased against it just you know for health reasons and my own personal you know dislike of the stuff but 

432.94 435.05 B: i won't say that [sigh] 

435.19 446.27 B: i don't understand the other guy what it would be like to be in their shoes because i also said don't like it when the government starts interfering in things that i do enjoy and i don't think are you know 

446.54 448.65 B: 'cause any real problems so 

448.98 451.15 B: i guess i'm in that field there 

450.77 459.26 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] it's weird because [noise] my my parents smoked [noise] when i was younger and they and they quit you know [noise] or my father at least quit you know for the past [noise] five years or so 

454.18 455.63 B: (( mhm [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

459.28 462.11 A: and i always said as i was growing up that i would never smoke [noise] 

462.19 465.99 A: (( and uh 'cause it was [noise] you know it was nasty [noise] and smelled bad and [noise] all that )) 

466.09 470.26 A: but uh [noise] as i got older [noise] probably uh somewhere in 

470.30 473.35 A: junior high not even high school [noise] probably in junior high 

473.44 475.63 A: i started trying cigarettes [noise] 

475.79 482.26 A: and i i still don't smoke cigarettes i still think they're kind of nasty i mean i i really don't smoke those tough but 

481.47 483.07 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

482.47 493.59 A: um i smoke cigars now and i could quit [noise] completely if i wanted to i don't think it would be that bad 'cause [noise] like i don't really smoke that often i might smoke like you know every other 

491.32 493.11 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

493.97 501.87 A: every two or three days or something or i you know basically like if i have something to drink like if i go to a club or something or i have something to drink i'll smoke [noise] 

495.61 497.10 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

500.15 501.09 B: right 

502.34 503.63 A: but um 

503.67 517.91 A: anyway it's just weird [noise] that i always said that i would never start smoking and then [noise] to and then to smoke [noise] and to see my father you know [noise] see my father quit [noise] you know and then i'm [noise] still smoking and it's just [noise] it's just weird and i [noise] w- i wish my mother [noise] would quit because [noise] she smokes a lot 

505.91 507.10 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

508.58 509.81 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

517.88 526.76 A: anybody who smokes like [noise] you know virtually a pack a day i mean that's that's [noise] that's seriously [noise] that's seriously uh [noise] you know likely to be [noise] cancer causing 

526.85 528.11 A: (( [noise] and uh [noise] )) 

528.19 531.17 A: i don't know i just wish she would [noise] quit [noise] i really wish she would but [noise] 

531.15 532.22 B: oh yeah [noise] 

531.46 534.77 A: i guess [noise] once you've been smoking that long [noise] i mean 

534.67 537.16 B: (( [noise] you got the monkey on [noise] your shoulders [noise] [noise] )) 

536.65 540.86 A: i'm forty three [noise] so my my parents are like [noise] sixty eight [noise] 

541.01 548.62 A: well no no about sixty five [noise] [noise] about sixty five sixty six [noise] so mums [noise] has probably [noise] been smoking since she was in college or so 

542.95 544.39 B: (( mhm [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

548.66 549.62 A: uh 

549.86 554.69 A: (( so she's probably been smoking about forty [noise] something years she's probably been smoking for as long as i've [noise] been alive [noise] )) 

554.82 555.77 A: so 

555.89 570.42 B: [noise] well hey george burns made it [noise] to what a hundred [laughter] so you might be one of those lucky people who it just doesn't affect the body as much as it does a lot of other folks i know i'd probably die after a year if i was [noise] a smoker [laughter] 

559.10 560.64 A: yeah [noise] [noise] 

565.27 566.58 A: (( [noise] i don't do it )) 

568.80 574.67 A: no you wouldn't no you wouldn't you just think that 'cause of 'cause of the way you'd you'd be surprised how your body would adapt 

573.20 574.97 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

574.76 582.28 A: 'cause when i was young i would smoke cigarettes it was it was still nasty when i was smoking 'em [noise] it was like uh this [noise] is disgusting what what do people [noise] get out of this 

582.29 595.76 A: and i never liked cigarettes i mean they've always been nasty but uh but once i started smoking cigars i'm like e- like even pipes i'll smoke like pipe tobacco or stuff those are pretty cool to me those are pretty good you know they're not bad but um 

590.22 591.32 B: (( mhm [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

596.05 599.89 A: i can see why people are really turned off by you know espec-
