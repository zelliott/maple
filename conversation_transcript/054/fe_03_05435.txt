5.46 7.37 A: all right

11.08 16.26 A: (( right right that you know i ))

24.50 26.03 B: oh really 

25.50 27.38 A: yeah 

26.48 29.32 B: oh okay cool well that'll make it a little easier then 

29.23 31.70 A: yeah a little bit 

29.90 36.00 B: well [noise] well let's start with you then 'cause i don't i don't [noise] you know i'm not too good at this particular topic [laughter] 

35.89 37.75 A: right 

38.13 40.44 B: [noise] so do you think it's broken 

38.43 39.51 A: this this 

40.77 42.33 B: the system 

42.54 48.24 A: um [noise] yeah no but i don't think the system was ever set up to really sit there and um 

48.27 51.60 A: teach anybody 'cause you don't learn through um 

51.73 55.21 A: you don't learn through a person sitting there over you 

55.58 56.79 A: (( and um )) 

56.29 58.02 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

57.38 61.01 A: testing like [noise] that that's not how you learn you pretty much learn through 

60.88 70.43 A: life ex- life's experiences you know what i'm saying like the like the things i know and understand i didn't learn any of it at school i just kinda learned what they they wanted me to learn 

63.13 64.63 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

66.90 68.35 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

70.27 81.44 A: and when i got to a certain grade i'd already had enough to to pass any courses that i was gonna take between eleventh and twelfth and i know this because i took some college courses and all the college courses uh 

81.34 96.12 A: all the college courses were basically things i had learned in junior high school so then i really got offense like well what the well what the fuck am i going to be doing um [noise] eleventh and twelfth grade for you know what i'm saying this is really a waste of my time and my energy so then when that happens 

85.45 87.03 B: (( [noise] [noise] oh yeah )) 

88.97 90.96 B: [laughter] 

91.78 92.81 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

95.95 97.65 A: you start losing um 

97.72 99.96 A: you first you start losing your patience 

100.06 101.35 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

100.48 108.12 A: then you don't concentrate you know what i'm saying and now you're just there just to be there because you have to because you don't want to hear your mom talk shit 

102.92 104.03 B: mhm 

108.02 109.77 B: (( yeah [laughter] well )) 

108.74 112.24 A: you know what i'm saying and then you don't want to start having that on your back 

111.49 112.69 B: (( w- [cough] [noise] )) 

112.40 115.98 A: and when your time is idle you get to doing all kind of other things 

116.02 123.03 A: so that's one of the things wrong with the school system for me it it doesn't know how to keep a person's attention 

122.54 134.62 B: [noise] well actually it i think it's kinda interesting 'cause although i i kind of agree with what you just said um by the same point though i think a lot of it is that the system's not really flexible to people who're 

134.67 137.62 B: who require other ways of learning 

137.77 139.71 A: (( right )) 

138.33 142.04 B: you know because it's like i kind of enjoy the school system the way it was 

141.86 150.31 A: well yo- i mean the school system the school system's good for this sense you may learn how to interact with other people that you're not used to dealing with on a regular basis [noise] 

142.78 143.70 B: (( but [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

150.53 152.95 A: and it should teach you how to be disciplined 

152.81 155.17 A: and lor- learn how to l- um 

154.95 164.75 A: [lipsmack] follow a certain order you know what i'm saying like you look at the the teacher okay he's ahead over you while you're in the while you're in school he's ahead over you and then you have the dean and the 

164.52 170.84 A: principal and the vice principal and counsellors so you have these um individuals that are set over you 

171.00 181.83 A: and that should teach you a certain order but they don't tell you anything they don't teach you anything so you don't learn how to really respect them to respect the order you know what i'm saying so that you don't get that discipline 

172.74 173.61 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

180.80 189.36 B: [noise] [noise] right but i i don't know because uh i don't know if i agree with that necessarily because i don't necessarily think that school is about respecting order 

188.95 201.29 A: but that's what everything in life should be about if there's no if there's no understanding of order then there's chaos and that's kinda why life is the way it is right now that's why there's utter chaos in the streets 

189.90 191.29 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

201.16 204.72 A: in life in general from top to the bottom you know what i'm saying [noise] 

204.40 205.10 B: (( [noise] )) 

205.05 208.48 B: mm i don't you know i don't know if i agree with that because i think that stuff 

208.46 220.66 B: uh is much more useful taught at home than it is at school [noise] you know i think i think that a lot of parents just don't do their jobs at teaching [noise] kids that stuff and so they don't respect it but you know i mean 

212.42 214.13 A: (( well )) 

219.75 221.39 A: yeah you're 

220.61 229.41 B: to me yeah to me school wasn't about learning that sort of stuff 'cause my parents did a good job with that stuff with me at home so i needed that you know 

223.77 226.72 A: (( right )) 

227.36 228.34 A: i mean that's 

228.85 239.47 A: [mn] yeah that's beautiful but a lot of people don't grow up with parents a lot of people grow up with you know a mother that has to work all day or you know a father that has to work all day if there's even a father you know 

238.59 243.60 B: right but then but then it comes down to is the school system responsible for people who 

239.77 240.43 A: (( so )) 

243.63 251.51 B: you know aren't aren't responsible with how they have children or is that something else entirely do you see what i'm saying 

251.22 252.35 A: yeah that wo- 

251.32 262.99 B: like it's easy to blame the school system right for kids who don't come home do their homework and learn from it but a lot of it comes from the par- parents abdicating their responsibility also though and then blaming the school for it 

262.89 274.04 A: right i don't think it's the school's fault i think it's society's fault as a whole but because we're just we're just speaking of the school you know it's not the school's fault at all you know i mean the system was set up a certain way 

266.02 268.46 B: [mn] yes i would agree with that 

269.71 270.85 B: well yeah 

273.88 280.62 A: and there's um to some um to some degree to to but a small degree it works 

280.67 281.53 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

280.69 293.28 A: but as a whole i don't know according to what i see and according to what i've been through and then um you know the friends that i have that have gone through the same thing and the friends that i have that haven't gone through the same thing who are went on to excel in life 

292.32 293.96 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

293.15 296.09 A: [lipsmack] i mean it's pretty much like the saying you kinda like 

297.89 303.18 A: [noise] the first through the twelfth grade they'll you that the first through the tenth grade 

302.97 315.91 A: are really important like after the tenth grade is when you gotta take and if you don't have the initiative in yourself to sit there and make certain moves then you're not going to get anywhere you know 

309.85 311.72 B: yeah 

315.00 328.51 B: yeah i would agree with that because it by that point it becomes your own y- you're your own person to the point where you have your own moral judgement about how to handle it yeah before that you've gotta to be forced you know i mean no kid wants to learn without being taught [noise] [noise] [noise] 

320.28 324.85 A: right right right 

325.85 328.58 A: right no 

328.59 333.41 A: no no and then and couple that with the fact that you're going to who you know and then 

333.39 339.75 A: you know i'm a and you're a young dude coming up you your hormones are raging you're going through puberty and then you see you know 

338.66 339.73 B: oh yeah [noise] 

339.72 351.27 A: all the l- the little females walking around now their butts are getting big their little titties have grown and you know the whole the whole thing changes you know what i'm saying now you're more concerned with everything else other than what the purpose of going to school is 

344.31 345.40 B: [laughter] 

346.71 347.84 B: (( yeah no )) 

350.98 356.89 B: that's very true um do you do you uh where do you live where are you calling from 

352.72 353.82 A: (( so i mean )) 

356.50 360.09 A: um i live in southern california 

358.82 360.05 B: oh yeah me too 

360.49 361.54 A: right where you 

360.53 363.99 B: that's the first time i've gotten anybody who's kind of local actually 

363.53 365.63 A: oh yeah where you at 

364.67 366.64 B: um i'm in l._a. 

365.99 366.82 A: uh 

366.84 368.98 A: right right 

367.91 376.09 B: so yeah i mean the school system here is some real extremes because in the valley it's really really good and then downtown it really really sucks 

375.87 378.30 A: well that's where i went to school there in the valley 

377.71 378.92 B: oh where 

378.67 380.23 A: at san fernando high 

380.15 382.41 B: (( oh i was at uh calabasas [noise] )) 

382.35 385.56 A: oh okay yeah that's on the other side 

383.27 384.09 B: (( yeah )) 

384.62 387.90 B: [noise] yeah but i mean you know i hated my school 

387.85 390.81 A: right right 

388.87 395.40 B: because it was just you know it was insanely stupid there um it was basically just a bunch of white rich kids you know 

395.30 397.56 A: right right 

395.37 407.05 B: and it's like you didn't really learn anything it's funny 'cause when you know you were mentioning you learn something outside of school and that's what matters i didn't learn anything outside of school until i got to college and then it all happened 

406.39 409.45 A: right that's when you start experiencing life and that's when 

408.43 410.39 B: yeah 

409.49 422.27 A: that's when you start learning how to apply wisdom you know 'cause you don't have anybody to really oversee you now you kinda like almost on your own so you know if i do that i'm uh that's going to be fucked up i can't do it but then you do it anyway 

420.04 421.73 B: yeah 

422.64 424.91 B: whoa whoa you're breaking up 

423.36 425.04 A: look at it like okay 

425.22 428.11 B: hah you're breaking up you on a cellphone 

428.00 429.19 A: yeah 

428.54 437.95 B: yeah i couldn't hear for a second there but but yeah i mean it sounds like we're pretty much in agreement about that and do you actually live in the city now or are you still out in the valley 

437.29 438.82 A: i'm in the valley 

438.25 444.89 B: oh okay so you're still out there huh [noise] [noise] yeah see i i grew up in the valley but now i'm downtown l._a. 

440.03 441.70 A: yeah 

444.77 446.98 A: [lipsmack] oh yeah wow that that's 

445.48 448.04 B: yeah but i don't know if i'd raise kids here 

448.44 449.54 B: (( [noise] )) 

449.61 450.93 B: (( [mn] sorry )) 

450.89 454.42 A: i'm saying right that's a cool place to live downtown l._a. 

453.34 460.21 B: [noise] oh yeah i'm like in the miracle mile area [noise] but i've i've no idea how good the schools are over here at all 

456.70 457.85 A: right oh 

460.47 465.44 A: um i used to work at a school down there i had a fiber optic cable job over at um 

465.20 466.23 B: oh cool 

465.59 471.13 A: [lipsmack] what was the name of the school it was off of venice it was between venice and washington like off of thirty third 

470.77 473.84 B: it's a little west of where i'm at but yeah 

473.35 474.83 A: it was kind of um 

474.97 484.31 A: i mean those schools aren't really because you know what it is it's even like the teachers have changed like when i was in elementary school i don't remember teachers looking the way they do now 

476.69 477.65 B: (( [noise] [cough] )) 

484.20 485.57 B: (( mhm oh yeah i know )) 

484.87 487.78 A: i mean teachers are beautiful now you know 

486.69 489.74 B: i know now i just want to date one [laughter] 

488.21 491.62 A: (( [lipsmack] right right you know what i'm saying [noise] )) 

490.44 501.49 B: no i totally hear you i it's it's weird like that actually here the you know another thing i guess we don't have much more time but so we can stay on the topic what do you think of the whole voucher thing 'cause i think it's a complete scam 

493.20 493.99 A: yeah 

499.51 506.03 A: [noise] the voucher thing about um was that's the valley separating from 

505.33 515.14 B: oh oh no no no i mean on the school thing you know there's a whole thing behind giving parents like you know five thousand dollar vouchers so they can send their kids to private school if they 

515.13 527.57 B: you know if they want to but that makes no sense to me because if you're broke and you have no money and you're in the inner city [mn] a five thousand dollar discount doesn't make any difference you still can't afford the remaining ten thousand a year to send your kid to school 

527.14 528.67 A: [noise] no exac- 

527.35 530.16 B: so all it is is a free ride for rich people 

529.60 536.60 A: right not only that but that five thousand dollars could be used for something else i mean give give me five thousand just for my home you know 

530.84 531.40 B: (( [mn] )) 

533.08 534.33 B: yeah 

536.37 545.21 B: yeah exactly so i just i never really understood that whole voucher thing except that it's just a discount for people who could send their kids to private school anyway so 

544.93 547.36 A: right right 

545.22 551.10 B: you know it it's just an example of rich getting richer you know poor getting poorer as far as i'm concerned [mn] 

548.37 550.23 A: right 

550.89 553.08 A: well that's how things are set 

553.17 557.17 B: yeah i guess but that's bush's plan right now actually 

555.92 558.94 A: (( up right [noise] [noise] )) 

557.39 562.45 B: you know i don't know if he'll ever get it pushed through but whoa hello 

562.57 564.75 A: i'm saying well it might work 

563.82 564.70 B: (( oh )) 

566.93 569.51 B: your cellphone's breaking up there 

567.21 568.04 A: so 

569.13 571.48 A: [lipsmack] so is that it 

570.73 575.20 B: yeah i think so i think we've only got like i think i think this that should be ten minutes 

575.42 576.30 A: okay 

576.00 582.08 B: it should but why you have to hang on though till the girl comes back i think it's just that i've is this your first one 

579.20 581.02 A: oh okay okay okay 

582.07 584.09 A: yeah yeah 

582.95 596.05 B: yeah you just hang for a second and then i think she'll show up and just go yeah ten minutes is up you can say goodbye and then that's it so it sh- should happen any moment now but um di- uh how'd you find out about this 

590.59 593.06 A: right right 

596.53 598.10 A: um a friend of mine 

597.82 599.19 B: oh really 

598.72 599.89 A: (( yeah he's like he called ))
