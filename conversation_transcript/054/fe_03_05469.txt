38.23 39.09 A: (( oh really )) 

41.28 42.11 B: (( yeah )) 

41.34 45.15 A: so how do you feel about um banning smoking 

45.75 46.97 B: um 

47.65 52.25 B: really uh the smoking ban i think should be uh 

52.88 66.89 B: i think it should be left up to the owner of the establishment i don't think there should be a governmental or city wide ban on smoking saying you know i mean on city property that's up to the city 

66.53 67.65 A: do you smoke 

67.86 70.37 B: uh very rarely 

70.11 71.12 A: okay 

70.67 75.02 B: if i drink i i may smoke uh my girlfriend smokes 

75.47 82.96 A: well i think it depends on what type of place it is give 'em a smoking section all the time because like a lot of the times when you're 

75.50 76.67 B: uh 

79.25 80.16 B: yeah 

83.04 86.79 A: in restaurants everybody wants a cigarette after they finished smoking 

86.59 87.67 B: right 

87.02 88.32 A: (( you know what i'm saying )) 

88.50 97.04 A: but like the the public places they did smoke in was mainly stores you know little ga- well no it was just what restaurants 

97.20 98.86 B: yeah 

98.22 101.60 A: and maybe uh bus stations train stations stuff like that 

101.61 107.97 B: yeah well i mean personally if i had like if i had my own restaurant 

102.49 104.38 A: (( um yeah i )) 

108.24 116.10 B: you know i wouldn't want the city to tell me whether or not i could have a smoking section if i wanted a smoking section in the restaurant i'd put one in 

116.02 117.43 A: feel the same way 

117.10 119.01 B: yeah i mean it's not 

119.35 121.45 B: [sigh] up to the city to decide 

120.34 125.73 A: because you pay property taxes for some something other than just occupying the space 

125.48 126.48 B: right 

125.77 129.66 A: you know what i'm saying you wanna be able to have some say for what you do in your establishment 

129.64 131.05 B: yeah of course 

131.38 132.37 B: so 

131.38 135.18 A: as far as hot lines and the quit smoking i think that's 

135.37 139.36 A: that's on the individual if you wanna smoke 'til you drop dead then go ahead and smoke [noise] 

139.27 145.23 B: yeah i mean i don't i mean the thing is i think we have enough information now that people are 

145.31 148.64 B: uh educated as to the dangers it causes 

148.76 156.63 B: and basically you know if you're gonna smoke then you know you'll accept the consequences 

155.56 156.92 A: (( [noise] right )) 

156.64 164.56 B: of that of that action you know you can't i mean that's why i could never buy these people who did it and then whined about it when they got sick 

164.74 165.78 B: you know 

164.87 176.47 A: that's it you gotta lot of times um people that that that smoke have different reasons for smoking it's a crutch and you know it helps some people deal with just every day life 

175.98 177.68 B: right 

176.99 182.32 A: you know what i'm saying it curbs the appetite i mean people got their different reasons why they smoke 

182.24 183.53 B: right 

182.87 187.41 A: for you to kind of limit that i think that's you know you might be asking for trouble 

187.32 188.75 B: mhm 

188.11 191.97 A: especially if a person get all cranky and wanna go because he can't smoke a cigarette 

191.81 193.20 B: [laughter] 

193.46 195.02 A: (( you know what i'm saying )) 

194.44 196.43 B: yeah i know exactly what you're saying 

195.53 196.93 A: you don't want that 

197.76 200.84 B: but uh yeah it's just you know 

201.17 208.32 B: i mean i if i don't want somebody smoking you know if i wanna be around cigarettes mostly i'm not gonna go to a place 

208.62 213.18 B: where they're gonna have it you know i'm not gonna go to like a big bar or anything like that 

211.97 213.92 A: right exactly 

213.31 214.41 B: you know 

214.24 217.55 A: i mean if they wanted to ban something i mean why not ban bars 

217.57 219.18 B: (( yeah there you go )) 

218.21 223.24 A: you know what i'm saying that's doing more harm than cigarettes cigarettes is personal 

223.10 224.51 B: mhm 

223.93 230.20 A: bars affect the community and everybody that walk past parked in a lot go in or whatever you know what i'm saying 

229.74 231.53 B: yeah 

230.83 233.79 A: and you got all these other different kinds of attitudes that 

234.08 236.97 A: come up when you're drinking they're not attacking all the bars 

239.12 240.87 B: (( but i don't know )) 

241.93 244.71 A: and if you got children you don't want them around cigarettes 

244.73 245.57 B: yeah 

244.89 250.09 A: you move you know you move to another table or no smoking area or what have you 

250.05 256.65 B: yeah i mean i don't think it's you know any up to any of us to tell other people what they can or can't do 

256.45 259.98 A: right because wasn't there a time that you women couldn't smoke 

256.76 257.97 B: (( as far as the )) 

260.78 262.16 B: yeah i know 

261.70 270.40 A: okay now they they done fought for their right to smoke and vote and do all of that and now you wanna take the right back from them as well as from the men 

270.21 271.25 B: yeah 

270.62 272.28 A: where you can do it at 

273.70 276.00 A: uh i don't i don't agree with it 

276.06 279.82 B: yeah i mean i understand you know [mn] 

282.94 296.10 B: i mean if somebody if somebody wants to do it just you know they're gonna do it you know as long as they're as long as they're not going around a bunch of people and blowing it in their face and all that kind of stuff they're not really affecting too many other people 

288.39 289.66 A: [noise] i think they can 

296.33 299.83 A: [mn] and they say secondhand smoke is worth than 

296.43 297.63 B: you know 

300.08 301.85 A: first hand smoke 

301.65 302.94 B: yeah 

302.13 304.14 A: which i think is kind of crazy 

304.05 305.31 B: [laughter] 

304.86 309.14 A: 'cause you inhale all kinds of vapors from cars and all other things you know what i'm saying 

308.35 318.50 B: oh yeah and especially if you drive by houston you know we have so many refineries on the south east side it's just ridiculous 

309.65 311.26 A: (( mm )) 

318.64 321.58 A: and i'm sure it it's messing with somebody's health 

321.38 324.24 B: oh yeah oh it messes with everybody 

324.96 328.20 A: but they're not uh banning banning the factories [laughter] 

328.01 329.06 B: no 

329.13 333.51 B: oh we had a huge thing uh in houston a couple of years ago 

333.71 334.95 B: uh 

335.63 343.08 B: because we were rated so poorly as far as environmental stuff and uh smog and all that kind of stuff 

343.18 351.95 B: and so one of the things that they did was to supposedly help us is they lowered the speed limit to fifty five on all the freeways 

351.82 353.99 A: how what was the speed limit sixty five 

353.17 355.86 B: it was like sixty five or seventy 

355.77 356.84 A: (( okay well )) 

356.47 361.56 B: and so they said well if we lower the speed limit that will lower the emissions and uh 

361.70 363.75 B: then we won't be so polluted 

363.38 364.72 A: that's not true 

364.57 371.88 B: yeah i know it's not true at all and they and they actually passed it and it was actually passed for i'd say about six months 

365.88 367.70 A: (( doesn't make any sense [laughter] )) 

371.91 377.06 B: before somebody came out and said you know that's actually not gonna help you at all that's not gonna do anything 

377.35 389.72 B: and so they repealed it and put things back to normal but everyone's atta- you know we um like in philadelphia when you have to get your car inspected you know for your inspection so how much do you pay 

386.32 387.13 A: right
