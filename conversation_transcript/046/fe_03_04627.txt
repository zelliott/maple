146.94 152.51 A: so you would type and the p- your position would pop up on the screen in text [mn] 

153.04 155.38 A: and then you would have to figure out where you were 

155.45 163.71 A: and then part of the zelda game is to look for a key or something and when you get these keys then you can open doors and go into other places 

159.21 160.45 B: oh my 

163.77 173.66 A: and so you would have to say look in the drawer you would have to type it in look in the drawer you know walk over to the door open the door you'd have to type all that stuff in there was no graphics at all 

173.81 175.07 A: and then 

175.40 187.58 A: you would try and find this key and then once you found the [noise] key then you could go other places and [noise] i- it was kinda funny 'cause it you know with no graphics it was kinda s- it was kind of a silly game but
