159.62 165.62 A: yeah i i try to stay away from them so i'm like i don't know there's a lot of other places that seem to do a really good job 

165.39 166.48 B: right 

165.77 173.24 A: like it's hard for u._s. news i don't really find them good for but for international news anything that's going on overseas b._b._c. does a really good job 

172.99 174.09 B: right 

173.51 175.65 A: or you can get it straight from reuters 

175.53 177.36 B: right or the a._p.

188.68 190.19 B: exactly

204.50 208.15 A: sometimes when it come down to it i i can't ever see the difference 

207.94 209.08 B: [laughter] 

209.37 210.78 A: they get so 

211.07 212.65 A: so caught up 

212.86 214.00 B: yeah 

213.65 215.09 A: but 

215.41 217.14 B: oh what are we studying 

215.46 216.71 A: (( what can i say )) 

216.77 218.72 A: i'm studying computer science 

219.38 222.65 A: actually right now i go to georgia tech 

222.35 223.32 B: okay 

223.69 225.53 A: here in atlanta so 

226.07 228.37 B: what are the business prospects like for 

229.00 230.43 B: computer science 

229.18 230.10 A: (( um )) 

230.14 238.03 A: hopefully pretty good i still i still have another year at school though so i'm not really sure what i want to do i think i'm gonna go to grad school 

237.88 239.09 B: right 

238.47 241.43 A: maybe wait the economy out a little bit 

241.05 242.92 B: yeah i hope it turns around quickly 

242.72 249.57 A: yeah 'cause i don't really want to i don't know try to go find a job right now 'cause i'm trying to find a summer job right now it's 

248.58 249.72 B: mhm 

250.36 252.41 A: it's nearly impossible 

252.23 253.34 B: right 

253.14 258.15 A: to find something that's like flexible and i mean everyone it's like all the jobs just disappeared 

258.47 260.26 B: [laughter] 

258.98 259.74 A: (( [laughter] )) 

260.70 268.60 B: yeah it must be tough i i know that last year's and perhaps the year's before graduates had a tough time finding work 

268.32 269.43 A: yeah 

268.86 273.18 B: but there's some sense that maybe that we've turned the corner on the economy and 

272.85 275.09 A: yeah it seems like it's getting better 

275.90 276.99 B: let's hope 

276.95 279.39 A: i still i'm hoping i mean i 

279.55 287.63 A: just read in the read in the news i always hear i always hear about like all the things that are going wrong and every now and again you catch something good 

288.19 293.33 B: well you know it feeds on itself too i i think you know they report bad news 

293.35 294.55 B: people 

295.39 298.79 B: say to themselves oh there's all this bad stuff going on and then 

299.08 304.77 B: you know companies don't spend money they don't care stocks don't go up you know 

301.31 302.26 A: yeah 

305.26 314.44 B: and and the inverse is true too you know if if companies appear to be making money people want to buy their stock the stock goes up they're hiring they're buying you know 

308.64 309.87 A: we think 

314.19 315.25 A: yeah 

314.65 317.40 B: it's just goes through these big swings 

317.22 322.23 A: yeah and we got all the war hype and everything i was actually overseas during the war 

321.66 322.59 B: yeah 

322.22 333.16 A: and so i uh i kept like reading news from home and everything kept saying war costs the u._s. mil- you know it's gonna cost us billions it's gonna hurt our economy 

333.29 336.55 A: like people were arguing for and it didn't really do 

337.18 340.30 A: got ourselves all hyped for nothing 

340.54 341.86 B: well 

341.90 347.79 B: i guess i mean i don't know what the real cost is and what the impact of that cost is gonna be 

347.89 350.11 B: on the economy or the 

350.37 352.58 B: country's deficit but uh 

351.97 353.59 A: yeah 

353.67 355.42 B: we never know anyway 

354.99 358.31 A: yeah it always come around i don't know we 

357.31 359.98 B: the other the other news event that's sort of 

360.03 363.01 B: boggles my mind is the fact that all these states 

363.13 373.69 B: have surpluses in their budgets you know just two just two years they had you know millions to to billions of dollars of surpluses in their budgets 

366.83 368.00 A: oh really 

373.76 375.78 B: and now they're all screaming 

376.13 383.79 B: huge deficits you know we're never gonna make it we're cutting school programs we're cutting road services we're cutting this we're cutting jobs 

378.19 379.12 A: oh 

383.83 385.38 B: (( you know i'm thinking to myself )) 

385.45 389.06 B: w- what's the difference is it all just a function of 

389.12 391.66 B: stock dividends or you know 

391.58 396.44 A: yeah well like even even the federal government had a huge surplus 

392.08 393.52 B: capital gains 

396.19 397.11 B: right 

396.48 398.98 A: that's just i'm pretty sure that's gone now 

398.96 400.88 B: yeah absolutely 

400.35 402.46 A: totally disappeared unless 

402.54 406.10 A: i mean right when bush got elected it was gone i think 

406.14 407.40 B: yeah [laughter] 

406.74 410.13 A: it totally disappeared once he passed his first budget 

410.07 411.60 B: right 

411.07 414.14 A: so i don't know it's kinda hard to say 

413.81 416.21 B: i'm not a big george bush fan 

415.62 417.22 A: i'm not either 

416.88 421.74 B: um i'm not sure i can necessarily blame him for the state of the economy 

421.95 424.76 A: no it's not i mean that was probably coming 

424.47 425.53 B: right 

425.06 428.27 A: this i mean our stock market was over inflated 

428.79 433.51 B: part of me wants the economy to turn around for selfish reasons 

433.14 434.75 A: do better on the 

434.23 437.53 B: the other part of me wants it to stay crummy until he's gone 

437.82 440.05 A: [laughter] yeah so he doesn't get reelected 

439.24 441.14 B: (( [mn] so he doesn't reelected )) 

440.77 442.06 A: yeah 

441.51 446.51 B: 'cause that's about all he needs i think to get reelected would be to have 

446.60 447.69 A: yeah 

446.78 450.31 B: the economy turn around and the stock market go up and 

449.34 453.63 A: i know well i mean have you seen like the democratic candidates 

453.17 454.25 B: yeah 

454.09 459.09 A: i do you think any of them's gonna come out like a shining star at this point 

459.26 460.82 B: no [laughter] 

460.14 464.10 A: yeah see [laughter] that's the that's the huge problem [mn] 

464.21 466.10 B: how about that guy from florida 

466.09 467.60 A: what's his name 

468.40 471.97 A: i mean the only people that i can think of right now are leiberman and gapart 

473.19 475.80 B: there's bob carey from massachusetts 

474.71 475.82 A: bob carey 

476.48 478.75 B: there's somebody from new hampshire who i've 

478.83 481.40 B: only heard i hadn't seen him 

481.53 483.85 B: he sounded pretty reasonable 

483.25 485.39 A: yeah 

484.84 486.53 B: but um 

485.88 494.21 A: yeah i'm wondering what's gonna happen with that 'cause i saw like they'd missed their first democratic debate or i didn't see i just heard about it and 

494.47 496.66 A: just didn't look that good 

496.39 500.32 B: i i didn't see it either um 

498.51 499.33 A: (( like )) 

500.92 505.70 A: like i think reverend al sharp is running for democratic candidacy 

505.54 508.16 B: oh yeah he'll he'll make president right 

507.57 513.62 A: yeah god [laughter] yeah i just i mean just craziness i was just wondering if 

509.29 510.34 B: [laughter] 

513.69 519.87 A: i don't know i haven't really been keeping with i just started school again too so my news reading has declined 

519.30 520.32 B: right 

520.65 522.12 B: i think uh 

522.35 529.30 B: guys like sharp you know that they don't enter with the anticipation of winning it's just to get a forum for their issues 

526.55 527.59 A: yeah 

529.23 537.72 A: yeah i uh sometimes it feels like they're pulling away from the like the people that could have won it's like ralph nader pulling away from al gore 

538.28 539.30 B: right 

538.68 544.42 A: like people that had possibly voted for him and changed the election they voted for nader and his 

545.30 547.65 A: i guess he was green party then 

547.48 548.78 B: yeah 

548.39 550.21 A: something like that 

549.50 551.22 B: (( let's see the democratic )) 

551.28 553.78 B: national committee website 

554.78 558.76 B: you'd think i ought to be able to find something here about candidates right 

558.17 559.75 A: (( yeah seriously )) 

562.38 564.17 B: more special events 

564.50 565.78 B: (( democrat )) 

566.61 569.08 B: nothing going there oh here we go 

567.73 568.98 A: (( [mn] so you're actually )) 

569.33 569.89 A: (( [mn] )) 

569.57 572.20 B: two thousand and four white house candidates 

573.83 575.41 B: (( hm )) 

576.48 578.27 B: carol mosley braun 

578.65 580.01 B: black female 

580.21 582.16 A: yeah i saw her actually 

582.74 583.92 B: what was she like 

583.80 589.05 A: she seemed to be great i mean the but i mean taking the demographics of our country she's 

589.11 590.34 B: (( doesn't have a chance )) 

589.69 592.22 A: probably having not a chance in hell 

592.27 595.98 B: there's a senator john edwards from raleigh north carolina 

596.21 598.54 B: he seems a little slick for me
