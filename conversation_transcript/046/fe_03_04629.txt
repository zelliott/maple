33.81 35.62 B: yeah 

34.89 36.44 A: and i'll do that but not 

36.87 40.64 A: not uh what they're apparently talking about on on the computer

42.90 49.22 A: yeah i don't think i've uh oh yes i have i i have played them but you know like i i have nephews and things so i play with them 

48.67 50.10 B: yeah 

49.66 53.37 A: in fact i i think it was last christmas i was over at my sister's house and 

53.93 56.91 A: uh we were playing that uh uh madden football 

56.73 58.11 B: yeah i heard of that 

57.51 63.98 A: yeah and that and that was fun because it's a it's a you know it's a game you can you can play it as well as watch it if you know what i mean 

63.40 64.82 B: (( oh yeah i know what you mean )) 

64.17 66.18 A: yeah it's a sporting effort that you're playing 

65.85 66.89 B: yeah 

66.28 72.16 A: but some of his friends came over later that same you know christmas day and and they put on this um 

72.64 75.37 A: i think it was i think it was some kind of skateboarding uh 

75.40 78.52 B: yeah i've seen those yeah there's a lot of skateboarding games 

76.44 77.36 A: yeah but 

78.09 84.40 A: but but before you before you could start the game first you had to you had to pick out [laughter] your outfit 

84.16 85.77 B: yeah yeah yeah 

85.00 89.88 A: there was like five of them playing so it took it took them like a half an hour or forty five minutes 

89.91 94.29 A: you know because one guy has to pick out what character then he has to pick the uh [laughter] the you 

94.51 95.37 B: yeah 

94.80 96.19 A: know the wardrobe 

96.64 100.86 A: you know and then then they pick out the board and apparently they have to pick out the course 

96.81 97.92 B: yeah well 

100.89 112.83 B: yeah yeah i haven't really seen that been played one of the newer video games that i've seen recently though i saw some younger people playing it about a year ago which was really off the wall was uh grand auto theft three 

101.26 102.49 A: [laughter] 

112.23 116.44 A: uh you know i've heard about that isn't that doesn't that have like an r. rating or something 

115.82 121.66 B: yeah and if you'd seen this game they would never have allowed that game to be made when i was a child 

121.10 123.28 A: don't they show like policeman getting shot 

122.71 128.89 B: yeah that's what you do in the game you run around and shoot policeman throw grenades at innocent people blow up cars steal cars 

128.55 135.02 A: and see like you're you're uh half my age almost so i'll ask you this question 'cause you're you know from a different generation 

134.67 135.63 B: yeah 

135.04 137.54 A: does that seem appropriate at all to you [mn] 

137.60 138.78 B: well 

138.18 142.34 A: even before nine eleven i mean it certainly doesn't now in the wake of nine eleven 

141.97 147.18 B: it's a tough question i don't know if you can really put people in jail for playing that but i don't think 

145.92 154.72 A: i'm yeah i'm not i'm not saying should it be illegal i'm saying i mean how how how can anyone see it as appropriate i'm just wondering if i'm that you know behind 

149.49 151.05 B: no no 

151.89 152.77 B: no 

153.66 156.02 B: especially in the post columbine era 

155.81 159.53 A: well you see i didn't even think about columbine that was five years ago right 

158.99 160.44 B: yeah 

159.96 161.45 A: five years ago or more 

161.13 163.04 B: no more like four 

163.43 165.03 B: four maybe four years 

164.85 174.24 A: all right so but you but that's even closer to home than than the nine eleven 'cause you have 'cause kids are playing that game when kids were the ones that shot at columbine 

168.49 169.78 B: yeah yeah 

174.39 175.29 B: yeah 

174.71 183.55 A: but i but i don't know like that that kind of violence and video games i shouldn't put it that there are certain kinds of violence in video games it's more like cartoon violence 

183.52 186.28 B: yeah i remember that from mario brothers 

183.81 184.70 A: but we 

186.14 196.32 A: exactly well i i used to 'cause i like to uh i like the uh shooting games you know where you're shooting but usually it's it's it's the cops who go into a bank that's being robbed and you're shooting the 

191.08 191.97 B: yeah 

196.91 199.91 B: oh yeah in grand auto theft yeah you're shooting at the cops 

197.51 198.07 A: (( [mn] )) 

199.09 200.91 A: you're shooting at the cops i 

200.09 202.51 B: you're the one who is [laughter] robbing the bank 

201.93 204.33 A: don't know how i don't know how that's appropriate 

203.73 206.21 B: mhm not appropriate right yeah 

205.61 211.91 A: yeah i'm not i'm not suggesting that it they that a game like that should be outlawed 'cause i don't think it can be 

211.66 213.48 B: yeah right right right 

212.36 219.58 A: not constitutionally and i it just it just i don't know which would be more inappropriate trying to ban that game or the game itself 

220.00 225.14 B: yeah tough call next thing you know in a few years they'll have a video game where people are 

221.44 222.60 A: yeah but 

224.79 227.40 A: well what happens when it becomes virtual reality 

227.24 228.22 B: yeah 

227.61 232.24 A: you know and then and then you graduate from the virtual reality to go out and actually shoot being the cop 

232.52 233.64 B: yeah 

233.06 242.39 A: see that's what i'm looking at that's what i'm looking at because people call you a reactionary when you say these kind of things but the slippery slope does exist no matter what they say but 

235.45 236.95 B: yeah not good 

240.20 241.25 B: yeah 

241.81 244.55 B: yeah tough call very controversial stuff 

244.01 247.26 A: don't they have one with the with like hookers and things is that another one 'cause 

246.48 250.82 B: yeah i've heard of that yeah the game with the hookers you talk to hookers and stuff 

250.28 252.76 A: [laughter] but i mean come on i mean 

252.87 257.11 B: i saw this one video game that a friend had where it was on a laptop 

256.51 257.35 A: uh-huh 

257.23 258.91 B: and they have this girl 

260.43 266.27 B: i don't know can i can i do you want to hear about because they had this girl tied up and they're 

263.99 264.83 A: (( go ahead )) 

266.17 268.11 A: so like a bondage thing going on 

267.28 269.56 B: (( yeah yeah yeah )) 

269.41 271.78 A: (( [laughter] and this is a game )) 

270.37 273.91 B: and they're sticking her with these tools and stuff you know 

273.38 274.70 A: but it's a game though 

274.48 284.07 B: yeah it's like a game it but it's kind it's not really like a really creative game it's like to just to learn to use the mouse pad and things like that you just rub your finger on the mouse pad it's like 

283.47 284.74 A: [laughter] 

284.12 287.09 B: like solitaire teaches coordination with the mouse 

286.69 289.91 A: so it's it's it's a pornographic tutorial 

289.55 297.26 B: yeah like a pornographic tutorial learn to lose the use the mouse and it's like she's tied up and it's like you're sticking some tools over her [laughter] 

290.90 292.02 A: [laughter] 

293.12 294.64 A: (( oh no )) 

296.52 300.12 A: that's that's even worse that's even worse than uh 

300.37 302.63 A: than grand theft auto 

302.30 304.76 B: yeah but apparently in the game she enjoys 

305.59 308.73 A: well that doesn't make the g- [laughter] doesn't make it any better 

308.33 309.97 B: (( yeah yeah i uh )) 

309.05 315.72 A: did they i have a you now all these kids say well you know every girl every woman must enjoy that you 

315.10 318.03 B: yeah yeah well i mean particularly uh 

316.34 320.36 A: know it doesn't even go it doesn't even go for like regular pornography [laughter] 

320.13 321.29 B: yeah 

320.67 324.05 A: you know what's next bestiality done in these games 

324.60 327.60 B: i don't know i haven't seen it probably probably 

326.78 328.59 A: [laughter] 

328.61 331.77 A: [laughter] on a laptop that's appropriate 

328.81 329.78 B: yeah 

331.24 337.06 B: yeah it was on a laptop my friend's laptop he was he was going for his phd degree in chemistry 

336.67 338.00 A: in chemistry 

337.38 339.59 B: yeah and he has this game 

339.00 340.50 A: [laughter] 

339.84 342.75 B: but he's he's he's really weird you know i probably 

341.56 350.52 A: well i can i can but i can understand where uh people would use that game to to relax or what not but uh not uh not 

347.12 348.17 B: yeah 

350.57 356.17 A: from the way the question was framed for us i i i in other words i believe they want to know 

356.44 357.76 A: if uh 

357.89 362.03 A: what we thought of you know people you uh playing those games 

362.23 364.70 A: as part of their recreational day 

364.86 365.87 B: yeah 

365.29 368.33 A: like all the time like you would like you would watch television 

368.72 373.72 B: yeah i actually when i was a kid that's why i don't play video games anymore because i was kind of 

373.86 379.44 B: yeah my dad would say i was addictive i would kind of play it all day long every day during the summer and 

378.84 381.36 A: yeah no not during the summer you couldn't do that no 

381.11 382.39 B: yeah 

381.78 388.70 A: but i knew i knew a guy he played donkey kong this is this is this must be fifteen twenty years ago but he played donkey kong 

386.57 387.43 B: yeah 

388.74 390.57 B: yeah i remember that i had that 

389.95 391.59 A: yeah for his kids 

391.64 399.71 A: but but he wound up uh if he wasn't addicted it was as close as uh any addiction that i you know that i've ever seen 

399.75 400.58 B: yeah 

399.97 401.82 A: but he would sit there but he would get mad 

402.12 403.26 B: (( yeah )) 

402.54 405.63 A: he would like scream you couldn't you couldn't talk to him when he was playing 

405.07 408.15 B: yeah i used to be like that i was one of those people 

408.20 411.10 B: and i broke my addiction as a teenager in high school 

408.31 409.16 A: (( yeah )) 

410.98 412.61 A: yeah what's that again 

412.74 415.88 B: i broke my addiction to video games as a teenager in high school 

415.21 417.69 A: oh this is interesting how did you do that 

418.14 425.88 B: well i would just kind of see that i would just be playing at it all day and i wouldn't get anywhere and other kids would be out playing [laughter] doing thing with their lives 

424.16 428.32 A: [laughter] like like talking to other human beings and things like that 

427.36 429.08 B: yeah yeah yeah 

428.48 436.79 A: having social interactions and [laughter] well now my question was how did how did you uh break your addiction how did you break away from it 

430.28 431.88 B: yeah yeah 

436.63 445.36 B: i just i just realized one day that i would just be sitting there all day doing nothing and and just it kinda hit me and i just stopped you know 

445.24 446.04 A: uh-huh 

445.41 451.10 B: just stopped and then my my younger brothers would be playing and i would just watch them i wouldn't play it myself 

450.46 451.32 A: uh-huh 

451.60 464.69 B: and you know it just just kind of hit me that you know i'm just sitting there all day playing video games just from from the time i get up to the time i go to sleep you know on the weekend and on the holidays and you know i could be doing something else 

464.08 472.21 A: right so yeah i have an inkling of of what you're talking about because when i uh when i first went on the internet you know uh 

470.52 471.63 B: yeah 

472.42 476.29 A: i mean i would i would consistently be going on there to see if i got mail yet or 

476.02 477.05 B: yeah 

476.41 478.65 A: just turning it on and just looking at it 

477.99 481.61 B: well at least you could learn things from the internet you know or you could read the paper 

479.99 485.09 A: well yeah that's true well i resisted doing that too for a while because i saw the internet as uh 

485.13 491.94 A: actually being more evil than it was [laughter] which which uh which i i still believe but you know since 

487.36 488.20 B: yeah 

492.18 493.07 B: yeah 

492.48 497.05 A: i mean if somebody else is pursuing that path that's that's really none of my concern is it 

497.64 499.74 B: well i guess if they're not hurting anyone 

499.42 504.78 A: yeah well that's that's what you have to hope but uh but uh you know any- anything could be that way 

504.82 505.88 B: yeah 

505.11 510.36 A: you got i'm sure there are there's bad stuff in the encyclopedia britannia for for example 

510.40 515.29 B: yeah well i yeah probably the internet's a lot worse than that 

514.89 516.48 A: oh 'cause it's endless 

517.67 519.02 B: you know i saw a video 

517.93 521.09 A: there's not there's not there's nothing that isn't on there [laughter] 

520.42 528.27 B: oh yeah exactly i tried i used to play blackjack on the internet but not with real money with like the imaginary uh poker chips on yahoo games 

527.86 528.72 A: uh-huh 

528.55 533.31 A: oh can you oh see see i have a web t._v. i don't have a computer so uh 

528.67 529.70 B: (( and uh )) 

531.79 532.89 B: mhm 

533.14 546.80 A: well actually i just took getting back to the computer games the only ones that i ever really played like to wile away some time uh i play some of the gambling games like you said but like you know they just give you chips and it doesn't i mean it's like i'm going to an off shore casino or something 

541.68 542.71 B: yeah 

546.20 550.90 B: right and that's actually a lot better than playing real casino games with real money 

550.38 552.85 A: [laughter] well because you don't lose anything 

552.25 557.76 B: right it teaches you that you know with the imaginary money you'll still lose you imaginary money in the long run 

557.49 563.98 A: yeah well i i i actually win a great deal of money yeah i did i not all the time but you know 

558.00 558.85 B: (( you know )) 

559.98 561.43 B: oh you do you do 

562.63 563.53 B: yeah 

564.58 565.93 B: that's surprising 

564.68 567.17 A: (( but uh but that uh )) 

567.38 569.87 A: well with it's uh with the with the dice 

570.07 571.73 A: playing craps not blackjack 

571.21 572.66 B: oh craps yeah 

572.08 577.11 A: yeah but otherwise i i sometimes i often play scrabble scrabble 

576.93 580.15 B: yeah i used to have wheel of fortune for the p._c. 

577.62 578.41 A: (( you know )) 

579.91 581.17 A: oh really 

580.57 583.67 B: yeah that was fun like back in the late eighties 

583.09 583.96 A: uh-huh 

583.74 588.24 B: that was a lot of fun you know the the graphics looking back they weren't that good 

587.63 593.40 A: see but but a game like that uh to me it's it's not just hand eye coordination you're you're actually thinking 

592.78 595.98 B: oh yeah that was definitely a good thinking process game 

594.60 599.89 A: so that's see that's the difference there you're you're using a sense of reason 

597.11 598.16 B: yeah
