309.31 310.67 B: yeah 

314.56 322.36 B: yeah i was kind of a laker fan till they lost but then again i felt like it was a net- i just didn't think they had anywhere near the team they needed to get through [sigh] 

321.89 332.37 A: they they were wer- weren't really into it you could could pre- you could pretty much tell that they we- were r- really [sigh] really pushing it and ah they looked you know pretty much tired the whole time 

324.27 325.99 B: yeah exactly 

331.65 333.72 B: yeah they didn't have the heart did they 

333.10 341.86 A: no no but they were also pretty beat up you know the [sigh] some of like you know the [sigh] third players were all you know they're kind of old now they i mean no 

340.56 349.87 B: they are you you just not going to win ah you're not going to get through with robert ory devon george and derek fisher in your starting line up and nobody on the bench whatsoever 

346.09 347.27 A: (( no )) 

349.46 357.32 A: robert ory you know he he's beat up i mean the guy that guy has to have brains you know it's time [laughter] he retired [laughter] 

351.64 353.05 B: oh yeah yeah he was 

356.34 359.41 B: yeah he was just awful [laughter] oh like 

358.33 363.52 A: yeah ah i mean yeah he he missed about what about fifteen ah three pointers [noise] games 

362.24 365.85 B: i think they said be missed something like twenty six threes in a row 

365.56 373.82 A: the that many but then but then of course he's only got open in that one game and it's only and of course cody had to give him the ball [sigh] and ah 

366.10 367.73 B: [laughter] 

369.54 370.83 B: exactly 

372.40 376.01 B: he missed the i thought that was going down 'cause that's his specialty 

374.60 377.12 A: i thought so too i think everybody did 

376.50 385.58 B: 'cause you know he won't he'll go an entire season without doing a single thing and then he'll nail a game winning shot in the play offs and everyone will love him and i thought that was what was going to happen but 

382.99 383.94 A: (( [sigh] and i )) 

385.07 390.93 A: yeah it's a shame that they came back from so far [sigh] far behind to ah be that close then 

390.95 393.06 A: [sigh] i thought he was going to make it too 

392.62 402.54 B: i know it's tough it was tough i thought [sigh] you know i i think i think the spurs are the best team i was really surprised that they gave it away last night that game 

393.89 394.73 A: yeah 

401.80 410.99 A: yeah i i haven't really i didn't watch it though but [sigh] ah well i read something about what thirty seven ah free throws or something like that those games [noise] 

410.00 417.16 B: yeah th- the mavericks made ah they i think they made forty nine out of fifty free throws last night which is 

415.97 417.81 A: where was it being played 

417.20 421.45 B: it was in san antonio so the mavericks won the game on san antonio's floor 

421.03 425.79 A: oh gosh usually usually the home court is the one that gets all the free throws 

422.03 422.93 B: which is 

425.00 431.34 B: exactly exactly and it was san antonio just kind of they had 'em down by eighteen points at one time and they 

430.43 433.81 A: that's right i i haven't read the news yet but that's what i glanced at 

433.20 445.66 B: they let ah the mavericks they they let it go back to the mavericks taste so i thought it was going to be the mavs i mean it's always going to be the spurs but i what i'd like to see just as a basketball fan i'd like to see the mavs and the nets because i think that would be the most exciting final 

445.17 447.59 A: [noise] yeah i think so i think so too 

446.40 455.86 B: because both the teams really like to run they've great ball handlers and they can [sigh] you know the mavs [laughter] they don't really play too much defence either team [laughter] 

454.76 457.26 A: no it'd be pretty high scoring right 

456.64 458.39 B: (( yeah it'd be fun )) 

458.09 465.25 A: oh i i i i mean the spurs look so strong i mean maybe it was because the lakers just was just beat up but ah they looked they were pretty awesome 

464.61 476.16 B: they looked really tough i mean i was real- yeah i just don't think that anybody can take 'em over a set you know you got to beat a team four times in seven game series so i think they'll make the adjustments [sigh] come out and do really well 

475.84 481.50 A: [sigh] yeah i i think so it's just kind of upset to be to to lose in your home court though especially the first game 

479.64 486.57 B: exactly it is [sigh] but that's you know i'm a big sports fan so that's those are a lot of my hobbies either playing sports or [sigh] 

486.60 493.96 B: you know a lot of the sports i really like like baseball and stuff you don't really play once you stop being a kid 'cause you can't like play pick up baseball you know [laughter] 

493.05 496.20 A: [noise] right you play pick up basketball usually [noise] 

494.66 503.88 B: exactly exactly but i i like i love baseball i like going to games and that kind of thing and [sigh] football yeah i just ah a big sports fan too [sigh] 

503.38 507.30 A: yeah who's ah who do you like for ah for ah baseball

526.01 529.41 A: yeah i mean ah i guess they were you know 

529.35 541.33 A: a you know a pretty good team but ah i i i usually [sigh] for baseball i usually wait until the ah playoffs i'm kind kind of not much of a fan for i just mainly watch when the playoffs come along and that's exciting 

539.99 548.07 B: yeah that's when it ex- you've got to really be into baseball to enjoy it in like may and june and aug- and july you know what i mean when the when there's nothing on the line yet 

547.41 554.95 A: yeah because you know baseball's that kind of sport it would ah it it's tough to watch on a on a regular basis unless you are really a fan 

554.24 556.33 B: exactly exactly

556.35 559.21 B: football you like fo- football team that you root for

569.26 575.57 A: (( oh yeah [laughter] well they're not well they're not as s- strong as they used to be but they're sticking around )) 

574.19 580.35 B: no they're hurting and they you know they've done some [lipsmack] ever since eddy debartolo the old owner 

579.90 581.23 A: right 

580.46 586.48 B: was kind of forced out [sigh] now they're they're just they make some bad decisions in my mind 

585.46 592.47 A: [noise] oh well you must you must be ah too young to remember the [sigh] the joe montana g- glory days but 

591.32 599.21 B: oh no man that's when i i was growing up then it was like that was that's why i like forty niners so much i mean i remember the first football memory i have [sigh]
