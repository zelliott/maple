242.75 254.73 B: do something else press nine if you want to be you know removed from this study so [mn] i this must be about the fourth or fifth time they called me over the weekend it's just really the first time i really got through was this morning

258.21 268.26 B: [laughter] well they say they're only going to really i think call you three times you know so and i think they told me it was going to be like a three month study something like that so i thought 

267.11 268.05 A: (( [noise] huh )) 

268.53 280.44 B: you know i thought you know ah fine maybe call me this weekend and maybe you know wait another week or two or s- whatever call me again or something like that i was really surprised to get the second call you know so soon 

276.75 277.75 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

280.45 281.41 A: well 

281.44 282.77 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

282.07 284.75 A: well i guess we're not on topic though are we [laughter] 

284.02 287.21 B: (( all right let's get back to the topic all right you say you play what solitaire )) 

287.18 288.61 A: yeah uh-huh 

287.96 291.49 B: yea- yeah okay 'cause um i play ah 

291.51 297.62 B: solitaire also on the computer but i'm not really i i remember playing it a long time ago you know by cards you know 

297.12 298.70 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

298.04 308.00 B: and um but the computer is is sort of set up a little differently i think i'm not sure well i'm not sure of the rules but i think is there one called i think it's free cell are you familiar with that 

307.78 309.44 A: no what is it [noise] 

308.63 309.44 B: oh 

309.31 317.47 B: well i it's it seems like it's a solitaire game i believe and at the top you can um i think you have to it has like four 

317.35 330.63 B: well eight spaces you know at the top there you have the the the row of cards right and you gotta i think on the bottom four you gotta bring ah make the cards red black red black in in in descending order 

328.29 328.86 A: [noise] 

330.95 331.89 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

331.31 340.74 B: eh that's correct right okay but i think if you needed maybe a space or something you can use one of the four squares up top and maybe move a card up there i guess maybe you can 

340.86 345.52 B: use the next card up that's behind it ah from the pile that you got it from you know to somewhere else 

345.34 346.18 A: (( huh )) 

345.52 355.44 B: okay and then the other four i think you have to use you have to start with the i think the ace and start building up on each suite ace of clubs you know then the two of clubs three of clubs you know 

355.21 362.88 B: like that the other one s- set of four is and the other set of four is is like you can just put the cards there temporary or whatever to sorta 

362.96 369.39 B: move around but ah i never i never really got good at it i never really [laughter] i don't know if i was doing something wrong or [mn] 

369.38 379.74 B: or what i never really got good at solitaire not if it's on the computer i think i did better you know with the card game maybe i was [noise] computer [laughter] 'cause ah i don't know 

378.48 389.06 A: [noise] [noise] well you know the game itself is you know the game itself is boring but the thing that we started doing i'm i'm a teacher i teach in a middle school and ah a couple of years ago a couple of the guys started playing it 

389.19 390.08 B: (( mhm )) 

389.36 395.50 A: at lunchtime on a on a computer and then we would have contests to see who could clear the board 

395.69 396.82 A: faster 

397.08 402.04 A: and if you could get it in less than a minute than we felt like we were doing it really really well and so 

397.24 398.25 B: (( oh l- )) 

401.26 405.76 B: i yeah i was going to say if you can play it in less than a minute i think that's fantastic 

405.21 406.79 A: [laughter] 

406.09 416.25 B: [laughter] you guys are really good if you can play like that wow i m- i am really doing something wrong 'cause it takes me way more time than that you know i don't usually get half way through you know 

411.56 412.92 A: [laughter] 

416.33 418.14 B: (( so oh boy i )) 

418.15 421.33 B: may have to go back to the drawing board for that [laughter] 

420.15 435.04 A: well you know sometimes you win and sometimes you lose real fast but ah when we would just keep a ah running record of who would hold the the school record for the fast time to totally clear the board an- and ah get everything up on the aces and so it was just kinda fun [laughter] 

423.80 424.95 B: mhm 

433.80 444.22 B: oh wow that is that sounds amazing to me [mn] [laughter] i can't believe it oh there's different versions of solitaire also isn't there hm 

442.90 445.74 A: yeah i guess you can play a whole bunch you can play 'em like ah 

445.97 448.97 A: um in vegas i guess you play with um 

449.64 453.68 A: [mn] you only turn over one card in the deck and you can only go through the deck once 

454.42 459.81 B: oh okay maybe that's the the sort of the way this computer is set up wh- when i play on the computer 

459.77 467.24 A: well you can do it that way on a computer you can do standard where you turn over three and there are two or three different variations on the computer 

466.01 477.71 B: [mn] right yeah now even when you turn over three you can only use the top card 'cause i eh i did see ah the variation that way but oh ah that's just to give you a idea of what's behind it i guess a sort of a sneak preview 

470.31 471.17 A: right 

477.54 479.88 A: no they don't tell ya [laughter] 

479.06 480.29 B: i beg your pardon 

479.91 483.31 A: they don't tell you what's behind it until you get right to the end mhm 

481.53 482.53 B: no 

482.65 491.20 B: no i mean when you got three cards you could you could you got you got the first one and you can only use the first one but you can also do the next two behind it so it'll you sort of a clue i guess to what's 

484.71 485.55 A: right 

491.22 492.58 B: (( going )) 

491.52 494.49 A: well on my programme you can't see the ones behind it 

494.48 497.83 B: on oh no when you turn over three you only can see the top one 

497.58 498.88 A: right uh-huh 

498.74 500.03 B: oh that is 

499.35 504.21 A: the only time you can see the one behind it if you if you play the top one then you can see what's under it 

504.05 508.42 B: well is- isn't that the same sorta as as turn over one at a time in a sense 

508.38 512.82 A: well i guess but if you can't play the first one of the three then you can't see the other 

513.21 520.08 B: right that's what i mean it's it's just like when you when you just turn over the top one you only if you can't play that one then you can't go to the next one either can you 

519.69 529.75 A: well you do the next three and the next three and the next three so if you can take out one someplace in the run someplace through there if you can take out the top one then you change your shuffle 

523.00 525.14 B: oh oh oh 

530.03 534.52 A: so you get a different group every time so it's interesting mhm 

530.11 531.09 B: (( uh-huh )) 

532.35 536.16 B: oh okay y- you turn over three but you only play the top one 

535.80 537.03 A: right mhm 

536.79 541.58 B: oh [noise] oh that's a m- ah golly yeah you're right it's [laughter] 

537.80 538.72 A: yeah 

540.24 548.96 A: [laughter] i mean it's not exciting i used to love to do like ah space invaders or um the pong one where you tried to take the 

541.59 542.18 B: (( [mn] )) 

545.90 546.76 B: (( yeah )) 

548.01 549.28 B: ping pong 

549.01 551.24 A: yeah so you took the wall down 

551.31 564.32 B: yeah that that's wow really like way back to the original game i don't even know if they you still play can get those games now y- you're right they're those are back with the atari days though they have they have graduated a long ways from there i [laughter] i 

557.29 558.66 A: oh i don't think so 

559.60 561.06 A: yeah yeah 

563.02 565.58 A: yeah well [laughter] yeah 

565.19 566.45 B: [laughter] 

566.38 567.08 A: [laughter] 

566.58 577.02 B: yeah and the figures there they used to have sort of almost like stick figures you know they they didn't they sort of tried to resemble i remember one game i had on atari was like shooting i think like 

576.95 588.73 B: a c- c- cowboy western game you know and it was just like little square dots that s- sort of formed a a person or i guess like supposed to be a cowboy and he shoots these little targets that they were sort of squares made of 

588.29 590.37 A: uh-huh i think i remember that 

589.60 599.89 B: [laughter] yeah all kinds of stuff like that yeah but i think that those games they were really i guess they really i don't know i got into those then but now i
