15.05 24.09 B: outside of ah [noise] regular occupation [sigh] um as well as i do like to surf the internet and computers i would say it's just another hobby 

24.19 24.91 A: (( oh th ))

27.60 39.92 A: that's the same for me [lipsmack] yeah ah sports is definitely my biggest i mean i [sigh] i enjoy movies and [sigh] ah i enjoy reading and things like that and t- things on those lines but sports is by far my ah 

40.21 41.74 A: [sigh] my my passion 

41.63 45.53 B: [lipsmack] yeah same here actually [laughter] i'm [sigh] wh- which ones do you play [sigh]

59.26 63.29 A: the one that i spend the most time playing and and work at the hardest i'd say 

63.48 67.42 B: okay ah softball and football i'd say take up the brunt of my [sigh] 

67.88 72.15 B: athletic ac- activities [sigh] those are definitely my favorite sports 

71.73 74.12 A: [noise] [sigh] wh- where are you located 

73.54 76.24 B: i live in d._c. how about you 

74.87 77.96 A: okay i live i well i live in philadelphia 

77.62 78.68 B: (( oh okay )) 

78.46 81.74 A: but ah but i lived down that way for about a year i lived out in um 

82.28 83.40 A: anabel 

83.23 84.87 B: oh okay very nice 

84.54 85.39 A: so 

84.88 90.64 B: very nice i know exactly [sigh] yeah how mu- much time do you usually do you like [noise] 

89.57 104.37 A: oh well when i i when i'm in in the summers actually i'll play as much as four nights a week [sigh] i'll play volleyball [sigh] um but in the winter it tends to slow down like one or two nights a week there's not as much stuff going on but in the summer there's always so many leagues [sigh] and things like that that it's ah 

105.04 111.51 A: [sigh] you know there's a lot going on there's a lot to do and that's fine and ac- i i play [sigh] ah a bunch of different levels i i 

111.42 113.77 A: i'm good but i'm by no means great so 

113.64 124.99 A: i i may play on some team where i'm by far the worst player out there and then [sigh] the following night i'll play in a league where i'm you know one of the better players and stuff like that so [sigh] um and obviously some are 

117.57 118.59 B: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

124.76 129.20 A: [sigh] i enjoy the competition level of one and i kind of just enjoy playing in the other so 

128.74 139.99 B: yeah exactly exactly my idea i just love to play so anything i can get my hands into whether i'm the worst or best [sigh] doesn't really matter [sigh] as long as i'm out there playing [mn] but ah 

129.72 131.07 A: but 

139.02 142.39 A: [mn] d- do you play an organized league i guess softball you'd have to [sigh] we 

141.73 153.87 B: yes yes i play in several organized leagues [sigh] um [noise] for for both softball and and football [sigh] ah put on by the county or put on by alumni associations stuff like the like [sigh] 

153.90 157.12 B: ah but i try to play them i'd probably say i play 

158.09 160.56 B: [sigh] five six hours a week [sigh] 

159.93 161.48 A: really that's great 

160.88 165.05 B: yeah [sigh] yeah [noise] yeah i've got a lot of time [laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

162.92 163.72 A: my 

164.38 173.71 A: my hardest part is actually been finding ah ah softball leagues around here volleyball's not hard to get into but [sigh] um so- softball has has always been difficult i find it's very ah [sigh] 

173.92 186.95 A: ah you know kind of once you're on a team it's okay but it's kind of hard to get on a team because [sigh] particularly those guys who've been playing together five six seven years [sigh] and unless you know somebody it's it's a little bit more difficult to to get on to a team [sigh] but 

185.96 186.97 B: (( [sigh] right )) 

187.12 195.21 B: yeah i used to live in chicago and ah i had a couple of friends who who were already on leagues and so that was easy and here in d._c. i ah [sigh] 

195.45 198.39 B: just made some more friends and just you know got in 

198.35 212.01 B: signed up for random leagues and [sigh] and ah [sigh] actually for softball this year we have a a sc- school alumni league out here that's pretty [sigh] pretty [sigh] ah advanced and there's like fifty different schools represented and so me and another buddy [sigh] who 

209.88 210.81 A: [noise] oh wow 

211.89 216.88 B: who started one we started a team for [sigh] for [laughter] for o- our for our school um

249.04 251.10 A: a smart guy school so 

249.45 254.00 B: hm [laughter] yeah i was definitely one of the dumbers of the bunch but 

253.39 266.22 A: [laughter] because because what i said about my school too is ah because i played a lot i played of and stuff like that down there and [sigh] actually i i was fortunate i i belonged to a fraternity who was the [sigh] greatest group of guys ever to share a beer with 

254.02 255.37 B: that's okay 

266.04 278.68 A: [sigh] and worst bunch of athletes you ever met in your life so i i [laughter] i got to pretty much play whatever sport i wanted to play so ev- even things like soccer which i absolutely have no skill whatsoever i was out there running around playing with them so 

268.70 269.59 B: (( yeah [laughter] [laughter] )) 

277.77 285.09 B: [sigh] [noise] yeah actually that's funny my fraternity ah [sigh] we were all really g- good athletes who 

284.09 284.90 A: uh-huh 

285.00 299.71 B: who either were just removed from playing varsity sports or you know due to injury [sigh] or just basically went to school on some sort of scholarship and then just got introduced to alcohol [sigh] or not introduced but hard core alcohol and [sigh] and ah 

293.90 294.55 A: (( uh-hum )) 

295.91 296.76 A: right 

299.66 305.69 B: [laughter] [sigh] until we eventually dropped out of varsity [laughter] for [sigh] and so it was just a bunch of athletes [laughter] 

300.29 301.49 A: (( yeah i )) 

305.32 309.67 A: know well that's actually that's exactly what happened to my freshman year roommate he was at our school on ah 

309.84 319.82 A: [sigh] i guess not a scholarship because i don't think our school offers scholarships for track but cross country track kind of thing and he was supposed to be some great runner [sigh] yet within like a month and a half he just quit because he was having too much fun [sigh] 

319.17 320.72 B: yeah which school [mn] 

320.38 322.54 A: ah ah university of richmond 

321.97 323.04 B: (( oh okay )) 

322.92 327.02 A: so just just kind of about hundred miles south here [sigh] oh 

323.58 325.07 B: okay yeah 

326.38 330.03 B: yeah yeah i know exactly where it is i actually played a law school there so 

329.88 330.88 A: okay 

330.40 331.66 B: yeah 

331.02 335.05 A: yeah which i my understanding what is is is a good law school i don't 

334.44 335.95 B: (( yes yeah [sigh] )) 

335.13 343.50 A: i know we we're pretty good undergraduate i know we don't have a whole lot of a- ah there's not i don't think we have overly expansive um 

343.66 351.01 A: graduate programs but i i know for [sigh] for the commuters and stuff like that a lot of them get their their ah masters and stuff like that there but [noise] 

345.72 348.64 B: [noise] yeah the law one's pretty good [noise] 

350.51 354.47 B: yeah [sigh] [noise] yep absolutely um [lipsmack] 

354.95 360.09 B: so ah well i'm just trying to look at hobbies that's s- such a general topic 

359.57 362.90 A: are are are you a fan of ah of professional sports 

362.67 367.88 B: yes big fan i mean i i would say if i'm not playing you know what i'm doing is following and watching it [sigh] 

364.15 365.06 A: (( because )) 

367.69 369.23 A: that that's me too 

369.46 370.79 B: i just it's 

369.58 374.05 A: [lipsmack] the ah what what are you a are you a redskins fan or are you a bears fan or 

373.40 385.12 B: oh no i was born and raised in miami so every in florida so everything south florida is me [sigh] so for football i'm a big dolphin fan i'm a big marlins fan for baseball [sigh] 

385.20 394.24 B: ah i'm not a huge hockey fan being you know being from florida but you know i root for the panthers and i see 'em on t._v. and then you know the miami heat are my basketball team [sigh] 

388.52 389.58 A: (( [sigh] right )) 

394.31 395.23 B: so 

394.46 395.37 A: (( they go )) 

395.49 399.64 A: they're actually ah they're going to re-sign zoe or not 

399.05 399.93 B: no 

400.40 412.96 B: no i don't think so [sigh] i mean you know ah pshaw ah he doesn't want to sign for like the the veteran minimum the veteran you know mid cap exception [sigh] of four million and and i don't think the heat really want to ah 

408.62 409.55 A: (( [noise] right )) 

413.44 417.34 B: [sigh] to sign him for anything more 'cause you see i don't think he'll even last this next season 

417.21 419.82 A: that's what i was wondering [mn] because 

418.32 429.09 B: you know [sigh] plus i think i think if you know depending on i think it might also depend on the lottery [sigh] um and what happens on you know thursday night's [sigh] ah lottery draw since ah 

428.45 429.79 A: is that this thursday 

429.48 439.22 B: yeah it's this thursday and you know depending on who the [sigh] where the heat land 'cause no matter what it's going to be [sigh] the heat's highest ah draft tick ever so it's kind of exciting but ah [sigh] 

437.10 438.30 A: [laughter] 

439.17 451.36 B: you know if they can pull it off even if they don't get the bronze you know they can get ah darko out of europe you know he's a big guy and ah [sigh] [noise] you know even even further down line there's a couple there's that center from georgia tech who's really good [sigh] 

443.68 444.59 A: right 

450.79 453.08 A: (( fred bosch or whatever his name is yeah )) 

451.70 456.14 B: yeah bosch and there's that western kentucky guy who [sigh] starting to ride the 

455.15 462.68 A: he's a freak i don't know man i wouldn't he's a they've been talking about him for years and you never even hear him during the season you'll only ever hear of him around draft time [sigh] 

456.54 457.81 B: yeah 

461.72 465.06 B: [noise] no [laughter] exactly 

464.02 466.94 A: which makes me wonder if he's not really much of a player [sigh] 

466.76 470.04 B: i don't know [sigh] i i really don't know i you know 

469.11 474.01 A: well it's amazing how much it's funny because you know the topic is hobbies or whatever but like [sigh] 

473.85 485.82 A: how much like in a year like six or seven first round draft victors here which means nothing because it means we always trade up and get one [sigh] but like we don't have one so i don't know anything about the draft this year and it was the same way with the eagles this year we were picking like [sigh] 

479.72 480.70 B: (( right [mn] [noise] )) 

485.63 496.67 A: thirty or thirty something like that or thirty first it's like so i knew nothing about the draft going into it [sigh] i don't know the players and i don't whereas any other year when we have like the fifth or top ten pick [sigh] 

496.53 508.37 A: i can probably yeah know you tell you the first top thirty prospects in each position and who we're going to go after and all those kind of things and it's amazing when your season ends early how much more you can learn about that stuff 

501.36 502.39 B: (( [sigh] [noise] [laughter] yeah [laughter] )) 

504.19 505.08 B: yeah 

508.38 515.36 B: no so i mean you know i i guess to [sigh] to sort of i think that just goes along with following a team or following whatever sort of 

515.39 528.30 B: i guess i i just a big cliche hobby [sigh] you know just when something's really exciting happening you want to know as much [sigh] as you can but when [sigh] it's [noise] not going to be someone who per se [noise] is going to be the [sigh] impact player or you know [noise] 

527.00 531.65 A: [sigh] [noise] you know we we drafted sam clancy i've loved this kid for three years he was playing at u._s._c. [sigh] 

531.52 544.62 A: and he hasn't even played a fricken minute for ah for the sixers and like i can't just wait until next year's to see like i'm hoping they keep him on the team so he can like play a little bit just so i can see him play [sigh] because i think he's like a [mn] 

544.88 551.00 A: you know he's probably no better than like a claus williamson type kind of player but like but i think that's something the sixers could use 

548.89 549.90 B: (( [noise] [noise] hey )) 

550.12 554.77 B: but you know i think claus has survived as being a role player for the last you know seven or eight years so 

554.35 555.57 A: he certainly has 

555.05 558.64 B: that's not too shabby you know as long as it's not a one done deal [sigh] 

558.29 570.37 A: right the ah so yeah i it's it's interesting [sigh] you know what's funny too it's like like right now there's tons of philly's articles in the paper every day [sigh] and and i don't necessarily read 'em all because they almost repeat themselves and it's kind of the same thing [sigh] 

559.07 559.71 B: (( so )) 

568.77 569.58 B: right 

570.26 583.33 A: but it's amazing if like there's one eagles article in the paper like i'm all over it [sigh] and then when it's eagles season just i'm craving like one philly's article [sigh] just 'cause i want to find out what's going on you know give me some insight tell me what's going to happen 

575.03 576.05 B: (( [noise] [noise] [laughter] )) 

583.14 595.13 B: right [mn] yeah same here i mean i just jump right to dolphins [sigh] even even my you know i go on the internet first thing in the morning [sigh] you know i check e._s._p._n. and i just get general [laughter] sports news first and then i'm going to the dolphins insiders 

594.97 599.89 B: [sigh] page to find out [laughter] even though it's the off season and you know and you don't know what little thing it's go 

595.52 597.16 A: (( [sigh] did you ever ))
