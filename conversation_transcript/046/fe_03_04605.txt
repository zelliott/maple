64.55 65.67 A: right 

64.99 78.60 B: [mn] so i i do- i don't know how you feel about going to movies but i g- i get sick and tired of going to movies and being interrupted by you know by people all around you because of non you know common courtesy 

78.35 80.59 A: oh i agree [laughter] 

79.44 90.79 B: so i do i just guess you know our our thought is why why not do it in the comfort of your own home and you don't have to worry about anybody else but your self you can dress the way you want to be and be comfortable 

88.23 97.77 A: right [mn] and if the kids and the wife are making noise at least you can tell them to be quiet and they won't get offended [laughter] 

93.79 95.33 B: [laughter] 

95.51 98.91 B: exactly so what's the latest movie you've seen 

98.74 102.27 A: ah actually we watched jackass last night 

102.02 103.41 B: really 

102.79 109.14 A: yeah [noise] [mn] i don't know if you're into that type of movie or not parts parts of it ah

106.78 107.66 B: yep 

109.37 114.25 A: make you want to throw up and parts of it make you want to laugh but it's pretty stupid [laughter] 

111.99 112.99 B: [laughter] 

113.74 117.67 B: well we we we i think we go the last movie we just watched was spiderman 

117.54 119.27 A: yeah 

118.35 122.30 B: so which was very interesting i mean i i like i like thriller movies 

122.11 122.99 A: uh-huh 

122.81 124.59 B: so um 

123.90 124.51 A: (( [noise] )) 

124.75 130.21 B: it were kind of an interesting movie i mean i i don't think i'd ever spend the money to rent it again but 

129.10 130.82 A: (( [mn] really [noise] )) 

130.55 132.96 B: you know it was it was an okay movie 

132.61 143.44 A: yeah i i didn't watch that one i was gonna watch it when it come on for a dollar ninety nine special over the satellite but i never did i think we're gonna watch either red dragon or the ring tonight 

143.35 144.40 B: really 

144.30 145.20 A: uh-huh 

145.56 146.44 B: (( [mn] but )) 

145.68 147.88 A: i don't know if you've seen either one of those 

147.20 151.67 B: i haven't seen either one of those yet but yeah i've i've seen the previews to 'em 

150.71 155.07 A: (( [mn] all right i thought maybe you could tell me if they were any good or not before i wasted my money )) 

155.12 165.83 B: no i don't know ah i i am kinda like you i i like waiting until the dollar ninety nine movies come out i mean i think in my opinion that's cheaper than what you can get from a rental place 

161.30 163.17 A: (( all right )) 

165.54 166.62 A: right 

165.96 175.58 B: you know and most generally they have decent movies it's just a matter of waiting and you know just waiting until they come around and you know and that's exactly what we do i mean we 

171.33 172.95 A: exactly 

174.73 177.40 A: and it's a lot cheaper than going t- to the theater [noise] 

176.71 183.53 B: oh heavens yeah [mn] i think the last time we went to the theater in fact [laughter] my wife was just mentioning it the other day was um 

183.90 185.82 B: i guess it was six months ago 

185.64 186.65 A: really 

186.26 189.13 B: that was about the last time we've been to a movie theater 

188.33 193.27 A: [noise] yeah i probably haven't been in close to two years [noise] uh-huh 

191.65 192.85 B: really 

193.08 201.56 B: [mn] the ah the one thing that i want to try out just for curiosity's sake they now have movie theaters out that are like ah restaurants 

201.72 204.63 B: you know where you sit oh have you really 

201.86 203.24 A: i've been to one 

204.03 208.15 A: yeah the last one that i went to i take that back ah they serve pizza 

208.06 209.43 B: really [mn] 

208.84 215.59 A: they ah they took out every other row of seats and put in a table right in front of in front of every other row of seats 

215.66 230.22 A: and they give you glow in the dark numbers and you'll order your food and i think they even ser- served pitchers of beer in there and ah you go in and watch your movie and whenever you pizza's ready they'll bring it to ya and [noise] you can eat your pizza and watch a movie [lipsmack] 

229.62 231.33 B: did you like that 

230.81 232.29 A: yeah i liked it 

232.07 241.24 B: [mn] ah 'cause i we were just real curious about trying it out sometime i mean eh sometime soon just for curiosity's sake just to you know just to just to see what it was like 

235.91 236.48 A: (( [noise] )) 

240.59 241.97 A: right [mn] 

241.49 248.28 B: but is it a lot more expensive to go ah to a movie theater like that versus a regular one or [mn] much the same 

243.70 244.78 A: (( [noise] )) 

246.72 250.61 A: [noise] ah no the movie prices were the same 

250.62 255.73 A: ah and i guess it's the the food is probably comparable too 

255.92 256.96 A: (( ah )) 

257.33 265.13 A: you can pay seven dollars for [laughter] a large popcorn and you can pay seven dollars for a pizza [mn] i mean it's gonna be expensive either way you go 

261.79 262.91 B: sure 

264.92 270.32 B: huh i'm i'm glad you told me that 'cause that's that that kind of encourages us to want to go now 

265.92 267.37 A: [noise] 

269.72 272.71 A: right [noise] but this was before ah 

272.96 277.46 A: my last child was born so [sigh] we probably won't do that anymore 

277.00 288.11 B: oh [laughter] so so basically then you're you're kind of more more like us just you're more like a more of a home body and just would rather watch movies in the comfort of your own home then 

277.85 279.78 A: [laughter] 

287.57 291.67 A: exactly i'll order ah order pizza hut instead 

288.72 289.59 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

291.27 293.84 B: [laughter] i hear ya 

292.17 293.18 A: [laughter] 

293.91 298.84 B: now we- we're th- we're the same way we don't have kids we have three dogs they're our kids but 

298.37 299.41 A: right 

298.79 309.79 B: we don't with my wife working as a um a a nursing supervisor ah at night it's just you know after a long day of work she just would prefer not going out 

303.59 304.42 A: uh-huh 

309.54 310.91 A: oh i would too 

310.56 316.47 B: so you know it's just we we f- we find ourselves doing the same thing just watching it from satellite so 

314.51 315.52 A: right 

316.62 319.73 B: [mn] but anyways um i 

318.67 321.20 A: yeah it's a lot more economical i know that 

321.70 326.73 B: [lipsmack] so ah [mn] what's your pr- what kind of preferences of movies do you like 

326.80 329.49 A: oh i like all of 'em ah [mn] 

329.56 332.92 A: pretty much [mn] except for ah 

334.14 336.32 A: the the far fetched 

336.52 339.75 A: thriller movies i'm not sure [laughter] so sure i like 

339.94 343.92 A: ah if it's believable then i d- i don't mind it 

344.52 352.69 A: ah or the suspense movies but whenever the plot gets [noise] too too far fetched i i kinda lose interest [noise] 

351.99 359.37 B: [mn] so you that's pretty much your i mean do you have any other other ah preferences or is it just basically thriller more realistic thriller movies [noise] 

358.88 361.08 A: ah no i like the comedies too 

362.13 365.68 A: i like comedies i like all of 'em just about sports movies 

366.47 369.23 A: give me a good sports movie i'd rather watch it probably 

368.96 374.80 B: [mn] you know it seems like movies nowadays don't seem to be near as good as they used to be have you noticed that 

373.93 374.83 A: right 

375.16 382.41 B: i mean it seems like they have more stupid moves out i mean i look i look at that one movie that they just made the the one about cancun 

375.30 376.51 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

382.60 388.56 A: oh yeah somebody i know [noise] went to see that i'm sick of i'm sick of reality shows anyway 

383.34 385.20 B: you know i mean come on 

385.37 386.39 B: you know 

388.33 396.32 B: well yeah i mean you watch 'em all the time of regular t._v. why would you want to buy or r- or rent a movie with you know something like that 

393.91 395.14 A: exactly 

395.76 397.49 A: (( [laughter] exactly )) 

396.86 406.36 B: you know i want to have something with a plot to it not something that is just a free for all and you watch you know a bunch of people getting drunk and and you know hopping in the sack with each other 

405.93 407.71 A: right [laughter] 

406.83 408.07 B: (( [laughter] you know )) 

408.15 409.77 A: (( [laughter] ah )) 

409.31 419.93 B: but no i just i mean it's like the we were just talking the other day it's like they don't really have good movies more [mn] you know the old movies like um star wars or the the star treks or 

417.74 418.66 A: uh-huh 

419.34 420.25 A: uh-huh 

419.90 427.65 B: you know ah i can't even think of all the ones that we've we've watched but it just doesn't seem like there's not as many being made anymore 

427.65 431.72 A: i think it's just because there's ah so many of 'em being made i guess it's 

432.06 432.78 A: ah 

434.29 435.12 A: (( ah )) 

435.16 437.42 A: quantity instead of quality [mn] 

437.41 448.25 B: [mn] i mean it's just like even the comedy that ah that eddie murray one that ah the one where he's a um a [mn] what do yo- what do i call it it's like a not not really a nursing home um 

447.74 449.35 A: oh the daddy day care 

448.74 455.50 B: yeah i mean that that's kinda like borderline being kinda funny but yet stupid funny 

454.90 456.63 A: right exactly 

456.04 469.02 B: you know and it's like you know it's just not really it's not really as good as they used to make 'em and i don't i don't know in fact if you look at even the directors they're not nearer you know they're not the the good old directors that we're used to 

460.62 462.56 A: right 

468.65 470.52 A: right 

469.50 472.20 B: [mn] i don't know how how old are you by the way
