170.92 174.23 A: he plays slingo it's like you know a word game 

174.07 178.65 B: oh yeah those those are like when i was in high school um 

178.73 185.64 B: we were there was one class where i we were in a computer lab and we'd normally finish our work and have twenty minutes or so 

185.55 197.38 B: left to and everybody would like somebody would find a a game and everybody would start playing it like for a while there um who wants to be a millionaire was real big 

197.08 199.07 A: yeah that's right that's right 

198.16 202.54 B: and so and so everybody would be playing that game online 

202.96 209.82 B: and then we found a family feud game online that was that was really funny that was really fun to play 

209.36 210.46 A: yeah 

210.00 211.27 B: and uh 

211.86 217.08 B: just just different stuff but yeah those were those word games are really fun 'cause 

217.11 220.10 B: and it's cool because they're actually you know they're 

220.32 222.92 B: helping you intellectually 

221.25 224.93 A: (( you know they're they're educational for him for he's only fourteen and )) 

225.15 230.07 A: you know he'll he'll like doing that i mean which is different for a boy that age 

230.11 235.80 A: because you know they normally don't like stuff like that they like the combat games and things like that 

235.21 236.44 B: yeah 

236.49 237.57 A: the 

236.65 240.02 B: yeah i think those those word games can be fun sometimes 

240.67 241.46 A: yeah 

240.71 241.93 B: yeah i just 

242.01 243.28 A: go ahead i'm sorry 

243.00 247.69 B: last friday i went to uh fry's electronics and i bought um 

247.91 251.69 B: they had some real good deals on this computer game called half life which 

251.73 257.44 B: is uh won game of the year in i guess two thousand or so and there's some there's a 

255.21 256.11 A: mhm 

257.85 258.99 B: uh 

258.90 272.36 B: half life counter strike which is a modification and counter strike is one of the real big games that people play like they have tournaments and stuff and people so there's there's some kids that like make their living doing that it's it's really weird i 

272.27 285.98 B: i saw a special on m._t._v. about it where uh this one kid he goes to california and florida and all over and does competitions and he wins like millions of dollars and gets millions of dollars from sponsors just for playing computer games 

285.71 287.64 A: gosh i didn't know that 

287.51 293.41 B: oh yeah and it's it's just insane but it that that game is like it's um 

293.36 294.53 B: you have 

294.37 298.50 B: terrorists and counter terrorists and basically it's just uh 

298.45 312.43 B: you buy weapons and if you win if you beat like you have objectives like you rescue hostages or just to kill the other team and if you win you get money and you can buy more guns and but but yeah it's they 

312.26 322.90 B: they have some there's competitions out there and it's a huge industry but that game is that game is purely over the internet like uh you connect to a 

323.08 325.47 B: to a server and uh 

324.26 325.25 A: mhm 

325.90 330.35 B: and then play online and so i bought that but uh 

330.58 333.14 B: right now i don't have the internet in my room 

332.85 333.76 A: uh-huh 

333.60 335.48 B: so i'm about to 

335.63 347.12 B: hopefully within the next week or so i'll get that and i'll play and hopefully i don't get too addicted because that's what a lot of my friends were addicted to they they would just play that all night and 

346.98 355.49 A: yeah that's what that's what my sister did and that's where i i don't like to that 'cause she- she was addicted to it i mean she couldn't get off there 

347.26 348.30 B: not go to 

355.65 357.21 B: (( yeah )) 

355.83 358.43 A: she would play with people over the internet 

358.56 359.56 A: (( you know )) 

359.72 360.65 A: for the 

359.88 372.86 B: yeah you just i think you just have to find a place you know where where you're having fun but it's not so it's like you can't stop i think that's getting that's getting 

372.91 377.42 B: weird and a little dangerous once if you if you can't stop 

377.14 390.63 A: yeah then they've got those internet games like for the casino players and they want you to give money you can pay like they give you your first ten dollars and then after that you know you have to pay and those were the things she was getting into 

380.71 382.13 B: oh yeah 

385.82 387.08 B: oh yeah 

387.95 388.91 B: yeah those 

390.47 400.08 B: those are horrible because you um you you just like give them a credit card number or something like that and you can't see how much money you're losing 

399.79 400.93 A: that's true 

400.79 404.04 B: so so that's the really bad thing about those 

403.70 408.78 A: yeah that's that's bad and it's really it's something that she actually got hooked on 

409.18 411.90 A: you know that that was just like gambling to her 

411.84 423.30 B: mhm yeah i mean it they have all the all the big casino games on those things and you know what craps or uh poker or whatever and blackjack and yeah i'm 

423.40 425.70 B: yeah i'm not gonna start that because 

426.30 427.50 B: uh 

427.58 433.92 B: i normally do pretty well knowing when to quit but it's tough when you can't see how much money you've been spending really so 

433.73 434.92 A: that's true 

435.24 437.16 B: (( that's that's where they get you )) 

435.38 436.33 A: i 

437.60 439.39 A: yeah it will it'll get ya 

440.10 446.12 A: 'cause i've i've just looked 'em up and i've seen 'em but just there's there's some i would only play i play with my great nephew but 

446.13 455.31 A: you know i didn't like to get him into the you know combat thing or the killing thing and all that you know but he he wanted to do that but i wouldn't let him on mine 

455.97 457.77 A: (( i'm sure he does it at home )) 

456.11 457.06 B: yeah 

458.92 460.72 A: but i won't let him do it here 

459.09 460.05 B: yeah 

460.95 467.64 B: yeah some some of the games out there are really violent and some of 'em some of 'em are more the story line i 

467.89 469.39 B: i played a game 

470.53 479.87 B: uh my room mate had had a game called splinter cell which uh is uh a tom tom clancy novel and uh it's 

474.23 475.10 A: mhm 

480.46 488.73 B: it's not really a killing game actually it's sometimes you do but mostly it's uh you have to sneak around you're a 

489.14 493.84 B: uh what kind of an agent are you an n._s._a. agent national security agent 

493.27 494.27 A: yeah 

494.24 495.41 B: so uh 

495.68 497.26 B: you're supposed to 

497.31 508.60 B: like at one point the a lot there's a lot of times in the games where you're not allowed to kill people and so you just have to like tranquilize them or knock 'em out or it's it's 

503.28 504.39 A: mhm 

508.79 513.69 B: but it's that's a really fun game that i that i really enjoyed 

513.81 519.25 A: well it seems like it would be a good one but the poker stuff and everything i don't like that 

519.68 524.04 A: and you know you have to watch your kids now if they get on there because you don't know what they're gonna do 

519.70 520.72 B: no i 

523.45 526.98 B: oh yeah i mean that's oh it's it's just 

527.36 530.71 B: the internet's crazy now i i'm 

530.90 540.29 B: i i just firmly believe that you just have to bring your kids up right and and trust them because there's no way you can regulate everything 

539.59 544.36 A: no you can't you might think you can the t._v. and the int- the internet but you can't 

540.62 541.46 B: i 

544.46 546.26 B: oh no i mean no matter 

544.60 546.97 A: there are controls they can get over 

546.81 561.38 B: exactly no matter what you put on there first of all these any any thing block any blocking thing it it can't catch everything i mean there's so many websites out there and so so many ways to get around it 

555.76 556.63 A: no 

561.31 568.74 B: and and that's just i don't know you it's crazy because i know 

567.26 568.41 A: that is 

568.53 570.99 A: sometimes it's dangerous i think [mn] 

571.28 574.57 B: yeah i think so too and it's [mn] 

574.84 581.16 B: but it's this is the information age and pretty much everybody can get anything they want and 

581.66 590.47 B: it's bad but you can't really there's not a whole lot you can do because if you if you start if the government starts regulating that then 

590.80 599.89 B: uh who's i mean if we let the government regulate the internet then who's to say it it's not going to start regulating what's said about the government and stuff like that 

599.19 599.89 A: (( yeah i don't want ))
