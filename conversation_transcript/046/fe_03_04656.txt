152.75 159.81 A: um act for change and they tell you about stuff and and they tend to be more on the democratic side so 

159.89 162.03 A: i kind of get both sides that way 

162.09 167.00 B: right well yeah in the middle ah which is interesting 

167.50 174.86 B: ah is it it well what are your thoughts about this tax cut since you're reading both ends of it 

171.92 172.70 A: (( ah )) 

173.61 175.83 A: personally i think that 

176.06 178.90 A: they really need to get people back to work 

178.93 183.45 A: um my husband has been well he had his own business and then 

183.62 187.20 A: it went you know it went south with the economy 

186.86 187.85 B: (( right yeah )) 

187.22 193.48 A: um and so he has um been out of work since 

193.69 195.15 A: um 

195.66 210.46 A: september the end of september and he just went back today now he worked another job in between but only for a bit because of the fact that he has a a really really bad back and they they wanted him to go on disability but he can't 

209.86 213.87 B: well what type of work does he do as his normal work 

212.93 215.25 A: normally he drives a ready mix truck 

215.39 218.12 B: i see yeah well you know ah 

218.48 221.18 B: i'll tell you my views on this tax cut 

219.68 220.79 A: (( mhm uh-huh )) 

221.41 232.79 B: ah it depends on the state of the economy there are times when if you give a tax cut across the board and the people who pay more taxes 'course will get more 

232.84 237.01 B: and when you have a period of inflation 

237.09 243.77 B: when there's dollars more dollars chasing than goods are available and you need more production 

243.81 254.95 B: then it's wonderful to ah get that investment going you know and get the money out that's the republican's side or the trickle down side [laughter] i 

250.66 251.57 A: right 

253.19 256.10 A: [laughter] but us real people [laughter] 

255.12 263.01 B: think that today without looking at it whether it's democrats or republicans but i think that today where the economy is 

263.24 277.83 B: the problem is not over production the problem is not underproduction we just have too much capacity and in other words you have to really beef up the consumer end you have to ah 

277.98 288.72 B: get money to people that are work- ah ah compensation benefits they run out you have to extend them because they're going out and they're buying all those essentials 

280.73 281.45 A: (( mm )) 

288.39 289.19 A: right 

288.76 297.40 B: wealthy people when they get tax refunds they'll they're not going to do anything with it really why should they invest 

296.70 298.58 A: right not back into the economy 

298.13 303.08 B: a factory is operating at seventy percent of capacity you're warehouse is unfil- 

303.44 313.54 B: filled and so people are not going to be hired you know until there's demand demand in this particular economy has to come from the consumer end 

307.15 308.00 A: right 

313.28 319.62 A: r- right yeah he really he really needs to get ah people back to work or 

318.59 325.84 B: right and one of the important things is is to make sure more people are not laid off with the states and the cities you know 

323.53 324.48 A: yeah 

325.93 329.22 B: cutting off funds there and ah 

327.42 328.56 A: right 

329.27 342.97 B: so i think this is a misdirected tax cut i don't think it will do oh it'll help a little bit to the extent that rates are cut for the middle class you know to that extent that they'll save something but 

338.41 339.34 A: right 

339.42 340.20 A: mhm 

341.61 344.81 A: yeah and it's small amount amount for the 

344.41 346.47 B: (( ah yeah )) 

345.05 348.74 A: the ah the marriage tax penalty um 

348.55 350.12 B: yeah that would help 

349.51 359.60 A: and then supposedly if you are making i believe a couple is making forty thousand dollars a year and has two kids they'll save oh i don't know 

360.06 367.54 A: but they'll be be cut back to s- to some you know low amount and he's even talking about some people 

367.56 373.39 A: will not pay anything at all well you know what we didn't pay anything at all last year but we didn't make anything 

373.54 385.18 B: well that's the key actually that's the key right there you have to get people back to work it's a wonderful slogan the question is why would a firm want to hire anybody 

373.69 374.69 A: (( you know )) 

374.91 375.88 A: uh-huh 

378.90 379.82 A: right 

380.91 381.87 A: yeah 

385.26 386.95 B: because first of all 

387.41 397.63 B: under these conditions that we have right now the first thing that someone would management would do is put people on over time before they hire new people because they have to be sure 

395.54 396.51 A: yeah 

397.63 409.20 B: that that demand is not something that's temporary and that's really where the the problem is also we're operating at a very high level with that dot com economy you know the 

400.90 401.71 A: right 

408.61 409.89 A: yeah 

409.32 419.97 B: tax level so it's i i don't think it's an easy thing to manage but ah i think the money would be going the wrong way it should be taken and the ah 

419.90 425.66 B: a lot of health care for example for everybody whether people are employed or not 

421.92 422.83 A: oh 

423.90 424.78 A: (( [laughter] )) 

425.14 428.01 A: we don't have insurance we haven't had insurance um 

428.04 441.29 A: since ah i think october first and i'll tell you i am i have um fibromyalgia and so my my medication alone is seven hundred dollars a month 

440.98 442.07 B: oh boy 

441.75 456.69 A: and um then my husband you know also with his back and and other problems that he has you know he also takes medication but not you know not as much as mine and here's another thing that th- they're they're they're making a mistake 

456.75 461.22 A: it's good for us but it's not good for the economy and that is 

461.72 470.42 A: like i said my medicine costs seven hundred dollars for one month and i found um a pharmacy in canada um 

470.95 472.66 A: um for 

472.72 485.19 A: a thousand dollars of course you have to wait until you can have a thousand dollars you know [laughter] but um point being for for a thousand dollars i was able to get four of my most expensive medication 

477.01 479.70 B: yeah right 

485.04 495.36 A: for three months and my daughter actually takes a a lower dosage than i do and i with one medication i wasn't aware that there was a generic at a lower 

495.44 507.94 A: um strength and i could have been saving you know money on that all this time but so my daughter ended up with one month's worth of hers and i had like like i said four of mine for three months for a thousand dollars 

507.90 512.93 A: as opposed to twenty one hundred plus dollars i would have paid at the drug store 

512.53 514.08 B: well you see 

513.04 516.12 A: but that's not their money that's canada got it 

516.10 527.40 B: well not quite because the drugs are being manufactured in the united states and the only people who are losing out a little are the pharmacists but i wouldn't worry about them too much 

520.57 522.08 A: well that's true 

526.33 528.02 A: no they do pretty well 

527.67 536.18 B: ah i think there's a real problem in health care where ah now there's another example where you know you could put a lot of people to work 

535.92 537.13 A: oh yeah 

536.57 539.50 B: and and you know you get the economy going 

539.42 554.28 B: and if it as people start going back to work demand picks up and as the factories and the warehouses start getting filled up then they start hiring people and start investing in equipment and so forth 

553.70 555.32 A: that's right yeah 

554.41 556.52 B: at that point in the economy 

556.65 568.88 B: you know giving them an incentive to go out and invest and getting money into wealthy people's hands would be a good idea and the investment tax ah credit would be great too 

568.62 569.33 A: (( mhm )) 

568.73 571.85 B: so i think we're a little off on the timing i think 

571.87 574.80 B: there are other problems and um i you know 

574.89 580.48 B: ah but that health care is a real real problem ah 

580.95 583.26 B: for so many people and it 

583.30 589.16 B: i mean that's something that ah you know you talk about the news and so forth and i'm very unhappy about 

587.20 588.14 A: mhm 

589.30 590.18 B: (( ah )) 

591.09 596.20 B: i'm unhappy because the american people don't want to get into detail 

596.63 599.95 B: and when you talk health care we talk prescription drugs
