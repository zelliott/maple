20.45 23.55 A: (( sure go ahead i'll listen [laughter] oh oh i also um like )) 

22.58 24.09 B: okay well 

23.76 24.47 A: (( to turn )) 

24.59 31.16 B: several ways i keep up with current events i think one of the things that i i do that's the biggest part of it 

27.23 27.79 A: (( on )) 

31.17 36.16 B: is um i don't know if you're familiar with n._p._r. news it's a news station 

34.10 35.54 A: (( the local and national news when i get home )) 

37.35 42.34 B: um and you i think it's like ninety three ninety one point three or something like that f._m. 

42.37 45.66 B: and i always turn it on as i'm going to work in the morning 

45.59 55.67 B: and on the half hour they always start with what's going on nationally then they give you the local news and i pretty much turn it on at five o'clock when i'm coming home in the evening and 

55.18 56.03 A: (( from work )) 

55.61 63.80 B: it keeps it keeps me up to date on what's going on in the current events and they always have like ah interesting subjects in between the news ah broadcasts 

63.92 70.07 B: and give you um also like traffic reports and stuff but it always keeps me informed and i listen to it twice a day 

69.82 70.70 A: (( because i'm kind of )) 

70.30 77.14 B: (( yeah i )) 

78.86 80.54 A: (( like just um getting in ah home and getting settled )) 

80.58 85.31 A: get some visual too [laughter] you know what they might be thinking about 

84.15 98.43 B: like that and another thing that if there's really something a hot topic going on like when the iraqi war started at work i think that um um tend to like pop in and out of yahoo news or something on the internet 

90.51 91.54 A: right 

98.00 100.08 A: oh so you go to the internet for some 

100.30 107.17 B: qu- qu- quite often if i want that or if i'm looking for a news story from out of the past i'll go back to it but 

107.20 115.50 B: if i'm at work and i know something's going on and i can't watch t._v. i'll i'll log on to something like yahoo news or something like that 

114.83 118.76 A: so you have a computer internet available to you at work then to 

118.71 119.67 B: yes 

119.27 121.70 A: to do that with oh that's great 

121.01 123.43 B: yeah i and um 

123.31 127.74 B: and i'm on the computer a lot too at home so it's like go to the on line 

127.51 139.11 B: i i use um you know high speed access but i also still use a._l._l. with it and whenever i connect and log in initially anything that's important that's going on they usually have it flashed on the screen 

139.40 142.49 B: so a lot of different sources i think 

142.32 143.72 A: do you um 

144.11 151.16 A: oh what was i going to say when you look for the news on the internet is it usually yahoo that you go to or do you m._s._n._b._c. or i mean 

150.24 153.90 B: um sometimes i initially go to yahoo 

154.06 161.55 B: or i- if i want a little bit more and i don't feel like i'm finding the story that i'm looking for i'll go to one of the other ah 

160.86 162.55 A: some others 

161.69 164.55 B: yeah a._b._c. news or n._b._c. news 

163.94 165.25 A: mhm 

164.75 167.36 B: something like that to see if they have a story on it 

169.24 170.11 B: so 

169.70 173.01 A: i myself i take the local paper 

173.31 176.39 A: um i live in salem so it's just a salem paper 

176.58 178.85 A: and i listen to a lot of howard stern 

178.81 179.82 B: okay 

179.53 183.32 A: so i get his point of view on things [laughter] in the mornings 

181.96 183.86 B: he's funny [laughter] 

183.44 190.88 A: yeah he's very funny yeah yeah sometimes i have to turn him off but a lot of times i can listen to what he's talking about [laughter] and um 

191.58 197.16 A: watching t._v. that we have like four channels in a row i think it's c._n._n. and 

197.42 201.36 A: different you know network news type channels and you know we 

201.68 204.75 A: flip through there and you know watch for half an hour or so 

204.76 209.89 A: because it seems that seems that that's what they do is like on on the half hour and then they kinda 

210.35 215.33 A: repeat it after that and then if there's new stuff then it goes a couple of hours later or something but 

215.78 217.34 B: i kinda like um 

217.87 228.14 B: like one of the things like when iraq and stuff first started i'd have c._n._n. going constantly but after a while it would kind of get to me just like news news news yet at the same time i'd wanna listen to it 

227.61 229.45 A: right exactly 

228.74 230.61 B: you know but um 

230.94 234.01 B: are you home throughout the day or do you work too 

233.91 238.10 A: i work too so well i'm a student actually so um 

238.36 239.35 B: so how do you 

238.48 241.88 A: see along at school i don't know anything but then i w- 

242.18 249.17 A: ah regular music station that i listen to um during the day because howard stern's only on in the mornings um 

249.94 253.46 A: th- they have pretty good news and that kind of thing you know it's not all 

254.48 255.92 A: talk or whatever 

256.18 259.04 A: they do some news doing 

259.41 260.56 B: do you use 

259.63 265.05 A: and then the regular local news um you know the five o'clock news i like to watch it at home 

265.14 266.18 B: okay 

266.34 268.89 B: do you use the internet at all for news 

268.45 270.18 A: you know i never do 

270.33 272.59 A: i use that for um 

272.60 278.77 A: you know emails and playing games [laughter] and that kind of thing but i never think of it actually to use for um 

278.85 280.48 A: catch up on news 

280.95 281.94 B: (( well )) 

281.18 282.39 A: that's an idea 

282.21 288.24 B: yeah i it's ah if i miss the story someone says something was happening or whatever that day 

288.45 292.04 B: and i i i found it really interesting then i'll um 

292.21 296.57 B: you know i can go on line because you know if i missed the news at home missed the news 

296.72 304.02 B: you know however like on the radio or whatever it's um it's an alternative for me to find out what's going on if something happens 

303.69 310.48 A: yeah if you were to catch just a blip of it and go ooh ooh what are they talking about you know bring up you know something that has to do with 

310.40 317.69 B: i don't rely on the newspaper that much because it always seems like you know it's like a day old 

317.21 318.10 A: true 

318.32 319.13 A: true 

319.08 320.88 B: kind of thing so 

321.02 324.47 A: yeah it's not up to the minute or any of that kind of stuff to 

324.28 328.21 B: right the only current news i get out of the newspaper is what's on sale 

327.67 337.95 A: [laughter] the sunday paper and all the ads [laughter] that's true [laughter] and then talking with friends and stuff you know neighbors friends when i 

328.22 329.38 B: [laughter] 

330.80 332.50 B: yeah that's true 

334.33 335.32 B: but um 

337.84 343.46 A: you know go out and stuff that's always a big topic of conversation is you know what's going on in the world and 

344.70 350.80 B: yeah because sometimes i'll miss something and i'll be in at work and someone'll say did you hear 

350.83 356.07 B: you know if someone caught the news or something on the news or did you see um 

356.09 359.99 B: that on the news last night and i would have missed it or whatever 

359.60 361.32 A: right right 

360.15 365.94 B: you know and that's when i'll um again i go back on the internet and i look a little bit um 

366.01 367.95 B: (( you know a little more ah )) 

367.37 369.12 A: look through there 

369.03 370.02 B: yeah 

369.66 376.08 A: 'cause you don't want to be the one in the group that says oh i don't know anybody wh- what are you guys talking about [laughter] 

375.82 377.62 B: yeah that's true 

377.03 378.33 A: that's usually me 

378.36 379.57 B: oh but 

378.82 380.32 A: what is it what is it 

380.74 388.22 B: yeah so but um i'm trying to think if there's any other way that i keep up with the news or anything ah pretty much again 

387.40 393.27 A: mostly media yeah newspaper like you said internet t._v. radio 

392.96 397.81 B: have you have you heard like what i just mentioned before of ah n._p._r.

399.44 401.24 B: national public radio 

401.51 406.46 B: and i think you can go on the internet to n._p._r. dot o- o._r._g. 

406.18 407.08 A: uh-huh 

407.24 414.94 B: and um current events and stuff like that are on there and i really like their um reporting and everything it's unbiased 

414.93 427.28 B: it always give you both sides and i think if you go on their site um y- you'll get you know probably a link to um org you'll be able to see what the um frequency is in your area 

415.29 416.46 A: oh 

427.22 429.46 A: do they have a

445.19 446.64 A: (( in your area )) 

453.35 456.45 A: and it's ninety what what was the number 

455.38 459.53 B: in my area i think it's ninety one point three or something 

458.58 463.80 A: hm but you can look it up on the internet and then find out where it is in your own area like where i could find it in mine 

463.47 469.26 B: yeah but try if you write it down n. p. r. dot o. r. g. 

469.14 470.05 A: okay 

470.12 478.74 B: and see if they give you the frequency because you may find you really like it i listen to it during the day time in the evening they start getting into more of like ah

506.78 510.25 A: right right so they have public radio hey that's cool 

509.73 520.57 B: yeah but it's really good i mean i i just really en- enjoy it i really feel like i keep up with um what's going on because throughout the work week because i'm driving to and from work i always have it um 

520.67 531.07 B: on the radio it's as soon as i get in my car i leave work just before the half hour mark and i turn it on and i'm feel like i i know what's going on 

530.83 533.94 A: get a whole world of information all on just on the way home 

533.44 540.52 B: yeah and i just to me like i'll do something at that time anyway so i i feel like i'm brought up to date when i'm listening to the radio 

539.58 541.50 A: get some learning in 

541.48 542.95 B: (( yeah so )) 

541.75 542.51 A: hm 

543.09 544.06 B: um 

544.45 546.07 B: let's see if there's anything 

545.15 552.85 A: and then my kids even bring stuff home you know um they're in middle school and high school and a lot of the time you know their newsletters or um 

554.05 564.60 A: because they discuss all the current events and that kind of stuff with the kids then they bring stuff home to show the parents you know what they've been studying and learning and that kind of thing and so actually i get a lot of information 

564.72 571.41 A: seems like in half an hour every morning we have like a channel one that goes through the um 

572.05 580.13 A: through the school system and so then the kids watch that and then it's they kind of keeps them up you know if they're not watching the news at home or something like that 

580.42 582.15 B: (( hm )) 

580.86 585.30 A: so then that way when they get home then you know if they have any questions or anything you know then 

585.38 589.34 A: hopefully i'm there enough to answer some questions so 

589.63 599.89 B: i've i've also thought i may have to look into this with my cable company um about getting you know extra channels because sometimes i like to get some foreign broadcast
