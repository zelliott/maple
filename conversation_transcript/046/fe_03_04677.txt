91.72 102.45 B: um just imagine kind of you know like in the really probably in the local news in new york at the end will have kind of a heart warming story kind of thing or there's a lot there's a lot more of that in california i think

102.89 104.72 B: more of the human interest stuff 

105.36 106.43 A: okay 

105.59 107.35 B: (( kind of more serious issues )) 

107.90 115.23 A: i mean also like in my case somebody always has a newspaper around i grew up around newspapers so there's always a newspaper around 

115.29 117.11 B: yeah 

117.13 120.69 B: and ah what's th- so would you read like new york times or 

120.59 123.66 A: um sometimes

128.45 129.64 B: (( oh okay )) 

130.15 132.88 B: well they do tend to cover new york a little better 

133.91 138.78 A: plus the fact that i travel up state so i get the local paper from up there and 

138.36 139.50 B: okay 

139.34 144.41 A: i got some friends down in your area in virginia who send me the paper once in a while 

143.84 145.72 B: oh really wh- where in virginia 

145.86 146.85 A: culpepper 

147.18 148.30 B: okay 

148.76 150.08 B: sure i know that one 

149.83 150.48 A: (( okay )) 

151.48 153.38 A: ah go ahead 

152.76 155.83 B: do you travel down to d._c. very often then or 

155.53 159.09 A: actually i'll probably be heading down to culpepper this weekend 

158.92 160.15 B: oh really 

159.75 160.87 A: yep 

160.32 163.80 B: oh it is a holiday weekend after all do you have monday off work 

163.24 164.48 A: yeah 

164.34 165.76 B: well that's great 

166.28 173.75 B: so speaking of current events what's ah what's going on with bloomberg in new york with the ah the smoking ban over there it doesn't seem to be too popular 

171.70 172.77 A: oh 

173.34 178.54 A: it that's the least of his worries as as a lot of people have nick named him now gloomberg 

178.24 179.98 B: [laughter] 

179.25 183.81 A: everything he does seems to turn dark i mean 

183.84 189.24 A: i mean don't get me wrong i understand what's going on economically and so on but ah 

188.71 189.70 B: sure 

189.38 195.19 A: you would you would think even though it may be unfair maybe unfair to him 

194.66 195.55 B: (( uh-huh )) 

195.73 200.21 A: but you would think somebody who was a multi billionaire in business 

200.40 201.58 B: right 

201.00 203.31 A: that he'd be able to do it better 

203.00 204.59 B: [laughter] 

203.32 205.76 A: and it don't look like he's doing it much better 

205.90 209.69 B: (( [laughter] yeah yeah )) 

209.92 215.81 B: but sure i mean following up ah rudi guilani has got to be a tough act after what he did for your city 

215.36 219.24 A: i love doing that to the people i work with because a lot of them are ah 

219.48 221.55 A: so called democrats 

220.93 222.74 B: uh-huh right right 

222.06 224.25 A: so called democrats 

223.86 225.50 B: [laughter] 

225.21 236.15 A: but when you listen to them again when you listen to them read the news or comment on the news that's happening you find out they're a lot more conservative than they're willing to admit 

230.81 231.75 B: uh-huh 

235.76 237.52 B: r- oh right 

237.70 244.76 A: but as i said and it's funny it it's when you hear them talking about the news i mean they'll curse guilani when he was mayor 

244.75 245.95 B: right 

244.92 249.80 A: but i think they were all kind of happy he was there especially after nine eleven 

247.84 248.80 B: right 

249.84 251.44 B: of course yeah 

254.02 257.85 B: yeah that was the thing i mean i guess you know no one wants to get what do they say it's ah 

259.23 260.16 B: a- 

260.24 266.16 B: liberal conservative is a liberal who's been mugged or something like that and a a conservative's a liberal who's been arrested 

263.27 264.90 A: oh yeah that's right 

265.94 268.59 A: or as as as churchill said 

268.35 269.55 B: yeah [laughter] 

269.27 276.03 A: if you're twenty and you're not a liberal you have no heart if you're forty and you're not a conservative no have no brain 

272.34 273.31 B: uh-huh 

275.59 279.15 B: [laughter] 

281.05 283.39 B: wh- which one which one are you closest too mike 

283.59 286.16 A: ah conservative 

285.64 288.77 B: oh right right right like closer to forty to twenty 

287.92 295.58 A: no well actually m- me and a lot of the friends grew up with we were sixty when we were turning sixteen 

295.57 298.33 B: [laughter] how do you mean 

298.44 305.62 A: ah we just looked at things totally different to the people around us and i guess maybe it was because we had more adults around us 

305.40 306.33 B: uh-huh 

306.25 312.39 A: so you you tend to see things from the light of the people you're around 

311.94 313.65 B: that's true yeah 

313.73 314.57 A: so 

315.35 318.82 B: had you always have you worked in city government your whole career then or 

318.59 319.90 A: excuse me 

319.41 321.28 B: have you worked for the city your whole career 

321.36 322.28 A: (( no no )) 

322.36 323.41 B: (( oh okay )) 

324.24 333.55 A: but somebody in my family usually has worked in civil service so again there's always a lot of news there in the papers like the the chief here which is a 

333.74 344.81 A: quote unquote civil service paper it tells you about all the hap- supposedly supposedly it tells you about all the happenings in the civil service system in the city state and even to the one extent the feds 

344.83 346.79 B: oh really what's the name of that paper 

347.11 348.17 A: the chief 

348.32 352.38 B: the chief okay i'll have to have a look at it is it available on line as well do you know or 

351.90 353.27 A: i believe so 

353.20 355.84 B: oh i must have a look at that one it should be useful 

355.70 366.64 A: i mean i i i've seen it in a lot of places i can't say i've seen it down in d._c. but i never really looked for it but i i've always been surprised where it pops up 

360.69 361.60 B: uh-huh 

366.38 367.72 B: oh that's funny 

369.00 378.71 B: yeah actually that's funny that you say that my dad actually ah worked in the civil service most of his career he's working in the ah california public utilities commission so as you can probably imagine he's 

378.97 382.21 B: under some some pressure really suddenly in the last couple of years 

381.62 388.78 A: mm yeah especially with the yeah well i i don't know has it gotten any better out there with the electricity 

388.24 394.24 B: well i think it's kind of stabilized you know we're not not afraid of blackouts or anything this summer as far as i know but um 

394.47 404.57 B: no it was just a real kind of stain on on the davis administration where it just it just shows how terribly unorganized the republicans i think were in california that they couldn't get someone else a light there 

404.34 412.37 A: yeah but yeah that's true i mean because i was going to say that they reelected the same guy anyway didn't they or am i wrong 

411.87 414.71 B: yeah that's right they reelected davis yeah 

412.60 413.89 A: greg davis 

415.86 427.19 B: um and i mean he's greg davis isn't popular but it's ah unfortunate that the opposition can't come up with any any sort of credible alternative you know they're looking at like arnold schwarzenegger to run for god [laughter] something like that 

429.26 443.11 A: [sigh] well here's the point you- you're not telling me anything different than what we've heard here on the east coast about greg davis and the blackouts i guess we get primarily the same news news the hard you know the hard core news 

434.89 436.16 B: that's true 

443.02 445.53 B: right exactly 

445.83 451.27 B: well yeah i've been out here for a lot of the time during when they had the blackout where he is anyway and so 

451.09 454.00 A: yeah but you were you out there for the sniper attacks 

454.11 456.09 B: no i was here for that 

455.44 463.33 A: okay h- how was the news down there 'cause i the papers i re- the few papers i read in d- of d._c. and the surrounding areas mostly the surrounding areas 

463.26 464.12 B: uh-huh 

464.03 466.12 A: i'm sorry they're lame 

466.14 467.99 B: [laughter] 

467.43 469.22 A: they really are 

468.91 472.05 B: yeah i i enjoy the washington post but it is ah 

471.88 473.35 A: (( i mean the news the news )) 

472.13 473.76 B: probably just a little flat 

473.41 477.17 A: (( the news casting is fair to middling too )) 

477.30 478.28 B: yeah 

477.56 484.18 A: nothing spectacular can you hold on there for half a second [noise] 

480.71 481.89 B: yeah no problem 

490.85 496.08 A: but as i said the news casting slant but it's informative it tells you everything that's going on 

495.47 499.09 B: yeah well it's kind of like the people here too [laughter] 

497.60 500.81 A: it kind of reminds me of the up state 

500.93 506.11 A: newscast i mean when you get really far upstate new york like up near the canadian border 

505.99 506.82 B: uh-huh 

506.72 514.12 A: you're you're waiting i mean even though you don't get it and i'm being somewhat facetious and i guess somebody would find it insulting 

514.06 516.13 A: you're almost waiting for the ah 

516.03 529.87 A: the dairy report and and farmer brown you know i do thirty gallons of milk today i mean it's not that bad and i have yet to see that anywhere though i hear they have out in the mid west where they actually have stuff like that 

517.80 521.28 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

529.23 533.05 B: oh yeah well i don't doubt it [laughter] 

532.71 536.71 A: but ah i find that somewhat amusing 

536.68 545.51 B: yeah i guess we i mean like it's easy to forget like being from wh- because that ah you know there's a lot of agricultural stuff in the middle there 

545.49 550.56 A: well look at it this way you come from um a major metropolitan area 

549.60 550.50 B: uh-huh 

550.69 559.64 A: i come from a major metropolitan area and there's probably a lot of people in middle america that you know deal with things differently 

559.34 567.22 B: oh yeah absolutely well even like upstate new york or central valley california i think there's also a big cultural divide there i 

562.38 563.14 A: yeah 

565.80 567.54 A: yeah 

568.49 572.09 B: mean it's very rural even in the middle of california as well 

572.35 587.26 A: well i guess you ha- yeah but ah well see you got the exposure from both d._c. and california i got primarily you know here new york area and granted i get the the somewhat further 

587.36 595.55 A: up the state line but it's st- you know and even then it's it's a little and it's like i listen to thirteen all the time channel thirteen public service television sorry 

592.92 593.80 B: uh-huh 

595.48 596.70 B: (( oh okay )) 

596.53 599.89 A: ah and they have news casts on there which i tend to like
