81.72 88.93 A: you know it's constantly a different a different uh challenge when you're going head to head against someone 

89.29 97.69 A: rather than some of the other games i find that you know once you get a little comfortable with it and advance in levels it gets a little routine

222.01 233.34 B: but you have to first time i played it you you if you kiss around on your wife you get married and you kiss around make him compliment his wife and kiss her a lot then she'll say do you want to have a baby 

233.52 234.35 A: (( mhm )) 

233.72 248.63 B: and he says yes or no you pick you know and uh if you say yes then all of a sudden there's a baby there and you have to take care of it and you have to feed it change it if you don't make your people go to the bathroom occasionally they'll wet on the floor 

248.43 249.48 A: [laughter] 

248.86 261.39 B: um they uh the baby the social services came and took it away from me in the middle of the night because i couldn't figure out how to take care of it it was starving to death so it's kind of a it's kind of unique game 

256.65 257.95 A: [laughter] 

261.40 262.59 B: but uh 

262.28 266.24 A: is that something that just you save it and just continue where you left off 

265.51 269.24 B: yeah you save and you continue and see you have to make the man 

269.13 281.21 B: the man has to get up in the morning and you have to send him to work first thing you have to do is find him a job but you know and then and then once he has the job then you can send him to work and he comes home and you make sure the kids get up and send them to school 

281.50 290.01 B: and it's just just like everyday life i mean you have to make sure that everybody's doing what they're supposed to 'cause if you don't feed them they'll get hungry and they'll pass out 

290.04 290.85 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

290.19 303.04 B: you know and and uh and you build your house and you earn money as you work and you add things to your house or even build onto your house and make it bigger or sell it and move into another house 

291.49 292.51 A: wow 

303.21 314.73 B: and uh and uh you buy t._v.s and when you build your house to begin with you need to put a fire system in because occasionally there's a fire and and i had four of my children die of smoke inhalation 

314.81 324.59 B: in one house so it's you know it's it's it's kind of a unique game you really have to stay on top of it but you can save it and go on from where you're at you know 

315.05 316.14 A: (( uh-huh wow )) 

324.88 330.57 A: uh i heard isn't there something where you can go online and actually interact with other people playing 

330.26 339.44 B: yeah yeah it is um yeah the the game on the on the computer game i've got you have neighbors that will come over and talk to you and then 

331.60 332.16 A: (( [cough] )) 

334.34 334.90 A: (( [cough] )) 

339.57 353.71 B: you know other people can have games on the saved on it too but they don't come over and interact with you but on the computer you interact with each other as these as these characters so it's kinda it's like i said it's different 

349.21 350.15 A: (( mhm )) 

353.31 358.98 A: right so you can have the people what from different parts of the country working for the same company 

359.02 360.13 A: can you interact 

360.06 365.05 B: well i haven't ever been online on the one so i don't know but one the c._d. rom 

364.85 375.93 B: it uh it doesn't actually show you go to work it just tells you what you're doing for a living and maybe while you're at work while the man goes to work then you you control all of them you click on 

375.90 387.88 B: if the woman's in the kitchen and you and she's she's needing to go to the bathroom you have to click on her and then a little menu will come up and say you know what do you want her to do 

387.81 391.12 B: and you want her to go to the bathroom so she goes in the bathroom and then 

391.25 396.41 B: you know how whenever they show nude body on t._v. they put the checkerboard over the top of it 

395.87 397.37 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

396.55 406.80 B: well that's what it looks like whenever she sits down on the stool [laughter] or stuff so it's it's a unique game it's nothing else somebody was pretty smart to come with it but uh 

406.73 413.79 B: but i don't i don't really get to play a lot of games because when i'm on the computer it's usually for business but 

413.35 414.21 A: (( mhm hm )) 

415.88 416.83 B: (( but uh )) 

418.49 424.89 B: it uh you know computers are wonderful things i guess [laughter]

443.90 446.17 A: you know a specified timeframe 

446.15 447.02 B: yeah 

446.21 454.16 A: so you know you play it out until the game over and then it's done and you know you're not constantly saving and continuing 

448.09 449.47 B: (( and then it ends )) 

454.39 460.69 B: yeah i used to like to play i played the madden football before it's it's pretty enjoyable and there's some 

461.00 467.87 B: uh i forget what it was there was one that was uh oh some of the race games i like playing the uh the uh 

467.98 482.43 B: the u._s._a. race the one that they had out and it was it was pretty fun 'cause you'd be driving through the country and depending on what part of the country and what time it was bugs would splatter on your windshield and [laughter]
