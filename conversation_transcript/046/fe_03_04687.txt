83.33 87.68 B: in southern california seem to i mean they almost forget the rest of the world 

87.30 88.35 A: [noise] oh really 

87.73 92.58 B: they the the coverage of national and world events is not very good 

91.97 94.06 A: oh th- that's really interesting 

93.41 99.02 B: [sigh] yeah yeah they you know [sigh] they just sometimes i think they think they're the only people that exist [laughter] 

98.40 100.02 A: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

100.56 111.14 A: yeah i was um i was v- v- visiting los angeles a couple of weeks ago and [sigh] like the like like the wind was very important im- important to them th- the wind [sigh]

110.89 112.09 B: the wind

115.68 116.83 A: (( and )) 

117.43 124.78 A: it it was just like interesting 'cause i i guess like the weather's so nice that y- it's it's it's kind of important 

124.30 129.36 B: [sigh] [sigh] well no it's not really that it's because of all the huge canyons that they have out here 

129.01 129.96 A: oh okay 

129.55 140.55 B: and and um like say if you drive from los angeles to las vegas or something [sigh] sometimes you can't get through you know like in the winter you can't get through the passes [lipsmack] 

140.40 144.79 B: and the wind um can be really bad even for huge trucks 

144.20 146.13 A: [noise] oh really oh [noise] 

144.90 148.69 B: and it's not unusual to have them knocked over 

148.76 151.49 A: [mn] oh well i didn't know it it it it was that strong 

151.08 152.58 B: yeah you wouldn't 

152.63 162.88 B: think of that but it it um [sigh] it really is and that's that's why i mean if they were if they're talking about wind then it's then it's like a serious danger but not really in the city 

163.67 165.77 B: [sigh] you know what i mean it's more like 

164.38 165.09 A: (( uh-hum [noise] )) 

165.93 170.61 B: [sigh] to you know in the canyons and the pa- and they usually say in the canyons and the passes 

170.41 171.13 A: mm 

171.14 174.67 B: so that's usually so are you close to the beltway [lipsmack] 

174.37 178.75 A: [sigh] um yeah i'm pretty close about fifteen or so minutes from it 

178.58 180.44 B: do you have far to commute [laughter] 

179.97 190.68 A: um r- r- right now i'm ah unemployed so i zero commute [laughter] which is really nice [laughter] um in like the past i've been really lucky i've been able to s- skip the beltway 

190.76 192.05 B: oh that's good 

191.47 193.55 A: ah h- how long is your commute 

193.35 199.80 B: [sigh] um ah right now not bad at all and i can go kind of off peak hours which is really nice [laughter] 

199.14 200.74 A: oh great [laughter] 

200.29 205.30 B: yeah so [sigh] um today a freeway shooting's out there [laughter] like have you there 

203.74 204.60 A: [laughter] 

204.81 214.19 A: um not it it's not we're not that many um we we haven't had one i think ah well i haven't seen one in the news in about a year or so 

213.95 215.12 B: oh that's good 

214.49 216.54 A: do you have them kind of frequently 

215.96 220.44 B: yeah they [sigh] the big the big news today is some [sigh] 

220.66 233.62 B: i don't know i think he was kind of a younger guy that that went to a concert at the house of blues and then he went down the street like around three am to an after hours [sigh] and um he wasn't even on the freeway i guess he had four thousand dollar wh- wheels 

233.12 234.07 A: (( uh-hum )) 

233.47 239.86 B: like that each wheel would be four thousand dollars and [sigh] when you stop the car the wheel is on bearings so it still c- curves 

235.38 236.19 A: oh 

239.44 240.65 A: (( uh-hum )) 

240.01 244.35 B: and you know rotates [sigh] and the guy just came and shot him 

244.76 245.62 A: wow 

244.84 249.12 B: he was with his friends and he killed him and [sigh] took his car and [laughter] 

249.46 251.70 B: i mean real stupid stuff [laughter] 

251.23 259.00 A: [laughter] yeah i think it it's really scary i mean even if statistically it happens rarely i mean i i think it makes everyone kind of more fearful 

258.74 259.83 B: mm 

259.52 265.01 A: and it's like it [sigh] i don't know it it's never fine to hear about those things 

264.83 269.84 B: yeah [lipsmack] wh- wh- were we were we was our topic world events or current events 

269.29 270.85 A: (( ah [sigh] current events )) 

270.16 272.35 B: [sigh] oh okay so that could be local too then 

272.46 273.40 A: yeah 

272.88 280.17 B: [sigh] okay so another another crazy thing that's been big on today's news [laughter] is um [mn] in a few neighborhoods [sigh] 

279.96 290.42 B: they've just had some guy going around smashing people's windshields not taking any- windshields and windows not taking anything [sigh] just going in ah some neighborhoods and smashing windshields 

289.84 293.65 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] w- why's this i don't really know )) 

290.95 295.42 B: (( [laughter] just for the fun of it just for the sport of it )) 

295.22 298.37 A: ah boy ah you it is it's 

296.20 297.89 B: isn't that crazy [laughter] 

298.91 303.52 A: (( if um ah h- h- h- have you ever seen a- a- a- a- a- a- l._a. story )) 

303.94 306.81 B: um you know what i don't think i ever did see that 

306.16 312.34 A: okay it it it it's just like that kind of reminded me of this s- scene where like steve martin he's driving on the highway [sigh] 

312.31 322.95 A: and he's talking on the cellphone and he an an a at one point during the conversation he he he he takes a gun out of his car and starts shooting people people are shooting at him back and he's still talking on the cellphone 

322.88 324.74 B: yeah like it's no big deal right 

323.97 326.48 A: yeah yeah just like that oh just random stuff 

326.08 337.74 B: god [sigh] there's [sigh] i tell you there's some real loonies and then this other guy [sigh] shook his baby to death and they had the baby on the um he went all the way to the supreme court to try to keep the baby on life support for months 

337.19 338.01 A: (( uh-hum [laughter] )) 

338.00 348.06 B: [sigh] and because of course the baby dies and it's manslaughter and [sigh] so the mother got a ruling that she could take the baby off life support so now the guy's you know [sigh] facing death charges [laughter] 

347.69 349.97 A: okay like do you think there's more 

350.08 357.62 A: ah like this this kind of w- w- weird events in california or do you think it's r- really the same on the east coast still 

357.37 361.62 B: well you know i mean i know things happen everywhere but um 

362.17 367.88 B: [sigh] they they sure seem to maybe maybe they just sensationalize them more out here 

367.53 376.31 A: that's possible i mean there's also [sigh] like the higher population density i mean i expect the worse the traffic is like the more kind of freeway shootings you would have 

371.76 372.82 B: (( uh-hum )) 

376.19 380.59 B: [lipsmack] yeah 'cause it does drive you crazy there's a lot of idiots driving round [laughter] let me tell you 

379.07 380.39 A: [laughter] 

380.41 385.97 B: [sigh] you know and plus like you have so many people from other countries out here [sigh] 

385.91 396.02 B: and you know my thing is i always think that maybe in other countries the slow lane is the far left lane [laughter] 'cause they're like driving pretty slow in the left lane [sigh] 

390.97 392.29 A: [laughter] 

395.49 404.61 A: [sigh] yeah it it it's like driving in other countries can be pretty like h- hectic um i i vi- visited i- i- iran last year i i'm half i- i- iranian [sigh] and like th- 

404.73 410.30 A: the and like their highways might have four lanes but there's like five cars driving down it like the 

409.45 411.19 B: how how does that happen 

410.90 416.05 A: the they make the most of use of space it it's like the like ah lanes 

416.05 427.61 A: are just ah s- suggestions and all the cars they're maybe like six inches from each other [sigh] but there's like very few accidents i mean like th- th- there's probably fewer accidents in um in iran than there are here 

427.21 432.15 B: [sigh] so do so they they actually make four lanes but five cars drive in it 

431.61 433.56 A: yes that that's right 

432.94 434.29 B: and that's okay 

433.92 440.25 A: yeah it's okay it's kind of normal 'cause like the the c- the congestion's really bad there so they make the most use of the space 

439.78 441.07 B: (( oh )) 

440.35 444.49 A: but the the but like most of the people there they're really good drivers 

444.06 445.11 B: (( wow uh-huh )) 

444.51 450.04 A: i mean i was like scared the first day or two and afterwards like oh well they they know wh- what they- they're doing 

449.78 457.66 B: [sigh] yeah i was going to say i wouldn't necessarily want to drive in a foreign land unless [laughter] i had to you you didn't drive did you go for to see family 

453.29 454.57 A: [laughter] 

457.21 459.68 A: yeah um i have a l- lot of family over there 

459.72 462.55 B: are are they okay now with all the events going on 

462.15 465.46 A: um yeah i i don't think like the 

465.74 470.29 A: war in iraq has really affected them [sigh] that much um 

468.47 469.30 B: (( no )) 

470.40 474.16 A: i i guess they're kind of insulated like they're not on the b- the border 

474.05 474.97 B: (( uh-hum )) 

474.81 481.11 A: a- and the government there is it's still pretty stable i it's kind of like the the same i would say 

481.40 483.40 B: it's as as it always was 

482.95 484.30 A: yeah [laughter] 

484.07 486.80 B: they don't have heightened alert or anything or 

486.13 487.49 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

487.63 489.78 A: i i i haven't heard anything 

488.74 491.74 B: well what about saddam what how did that affect them at all [sigh] 

491.53 500.63 A: [sigh] um i i don't i don't think it affected the- the- them th- that much i mean they didn't like them they they they didn't like him at all just because um 

500.79 511.16 A: he he started a war against iran maybe ten or fifteen years ago [mn] um so it was like a lot of h- hatred against him i i'm sure they were happy t- to s- see him gone 

504.69 505.70 B: right 

507.78 508.88 B: (( uh-hum )) 

510.84 519.28 B: yeah i mean that's how it seems for most people but [sigh] you know you always get the [sigh] [noise] you always get pockets of the resistance right [laughter] 

518.65 520.20 A: yeah [laughter] 

519.44 523.44 B: [sigh] so did you feel at all threatened by going over there when you went or 

523.11 535.77 A: [noise] um no no not at the time i um i i i don't know it it's like i was a little worried at first but one- once i got there [sigh] um and i felt safe it helped a lot having my family there 

535.42 536.73 B: yeah right 

535.87 546.92 A: like they they they're like i haven't seen them in maybe a decade or even more [sigh] they're they're just so amazingly friendly and [sigh] i i just like kind of felt really felt taken care of and 

540.41 541.57 B: (( uh-hum )) 

547.09 548.60 A: like pretty safe too 

548.46 554.26 B: [sigh] so how was the um the whole airline thing i mean do you have double passports or just american passport 

553.81 564.27 A: um just american passport yeah like th- th- they're very strict if you look a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- at- a- a- a-

573.18 575.21 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

574.44 585.43 B: yeah that's what i meant i mean because they've had such heightened alert you know [sigh] it it it's really kind of [sigh] i mean it's [sigh] not really fair just because of somebody's looks the way that they treat you [laughter] 

577.25 578.08 A: (( uh-hum [noise] )) 

585.54 587.02 A: yeah 

586.20 591.54 B: yeah so but i know they've been doing it that's what i wondered [sigh] did they give you a hassle coming back
