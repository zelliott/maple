88.91 92.75 A: i i like the um the radio news 

93.42 105.29 A: a little bit better than the ah the television news ah sometimes because it seems the television news sometimes seems a little bit more biased 

98.38 99.47 B: mhm 

104.89 105.85 B: uh-huh 

105.65 110.29 A: and um they they bring in too much um

114.27 115.20 B: mhm 

118.11 120.34 A: too much ah opinion 

120.35 124.10 A: and and and a lot of times it ends up coloring

126.39 127.60 B: yeah 

130.17 134.45 A: the same news then sometimes i i get a different opinion 

134.37 142.25 B: yeah i i i never try i never tried the radio now that now you tell me that i've never tried the radio before 

142.17 154.89 B: to to to listen to news i should i i should start maybe because i i i have that squabble with television too i i don't like it it's too biased where there is fox channel which is totally like right wing 

146.31 147.35 A: well it's 

149.71 150.58 A: yeah 

154.53 155.53 A: yeah 

154.97 160.53 B: or the other you know the other channels which are kind of like left wing too so 

159.86 161.21 A: exactly 

160.59 162.73 B: it's not like the right spot 

162.08 172.84 A: yeah yeah you know you're right it it's um an- and the ah the radio news would it also it it because i have about a thirty minute commute into work 

163.16 164.14 B: so

172.57 174.29 B: mhm

178.58 182.51 A: so that kind of covers both of um 

182.93 189.16 A: you know i get the current events plus i get so- sort of local and um informational type of things 

188.81 193.26 B: so do you do you do you when you commute you commute by car or

203.80 205.06 B: [laughter] 

204.45 206.31 A: the metro's a lot cleaner 

205.95 207.72 B: uh-huh yeah 

207.00 210.99 A: it's a very clean ah public transportation because i 

209.98 214.72 B: yeah it's really good and what i do is just read so 

213.45 215.72 A: ah so you get the newspaper 

215.37 219.02 B: no i i i usually read books when i'm in the metro 

218.65 219.52 A: uh-huh 

219.52 222.50 B: i read the newspaper it depends when i i wh- 

222.54 229.45 B: before i used to read the washington times during lunch and the washington post at at the evening 

229.16 230.03 A: uh-huh 

229.70 237.97 B: but when the war started i don't know the the washington times was totally biased so i stopped reading it and now i'm with the washington post 

233.53 234.64 A: yeah 

237.38 238.67 A: yeah 

238.58 239.70 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

239.08 241.00 A: that's interesting i mean um 

241.22 242.84 A: i like um 

244.21 246.03 A: we have a a local 

246.12 247.06 A: (( ah )) 

247.15 253.74 A: cable news channel it's not cab- it's not c._n._n. but it's um it's a- it's called um 

253.82 255.99 A: new england cable news 

255.42 256.92 B: oh really 

256.35 258.03 A: and it's um 

258.64 261.20 A: the personalities aren't like 

261.24 264.38 A: ah the high paid um 

265.13 276.23 A: you know the the major channel the major network personalities the stars you know the stars and and and i like that too because it almost seems like real real people 

268.91 269.84 B: mhm 

276.00 276.91 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

276.28 290.79 A: ah reporting the news and they and they you know they're not um they don't have political affiliations they don't have you know those type of ah things that that make you think that you know oh i saw them in the ah 

283.50 284.62 B: yeah 

290.86 295.91 A: in the tabloid and i saw this so you know that's why they're reporting it this way 

295.29 297.07 B: yeah 

296.23 300.18 A: so the the local cable news seems to be fairly um 

300.32 304.04 A: ah fairly straight forward and fairly unbiased in that regard 

303.47 305.44 B: yeah it's hard to find that 

304.84 313.49 A: it really is and and i never realized how much biased a lot of the reporting agencies a lot of the newspapers un- 

313.50 323.12 A: until i started until i got older and i started you know watching how they treated different candidates for president or senator or whatever 

320.47 321.41 B: uh-huh 

323.18 327.38 A: and you realized how they align themselves with people who are 

327.44 331.46 A: um sensitive to their their particular causes 

331.17 341.52 B: mhm yeah yeah you can i think that the mo- the most the ca- the most obvious case is is fox i mean they they don't event pretend they they just stopped pretending 

341.13 342.16 A: yeah 

341.54 344.10 B: (( they were they were neutral you know )) 

343.77 345.43 A: yeah 

344.33 355.94 B: and solely solely like conservative now awfully conservative and all all the guests to the to the shows ah when they're doing their interviews they get mistreated like badly 

348.95 349.79 A: yeah 

355.62 356.81 A: yeah 

356.22 361.61 B: and i'm not a liberal but i just i just i get sick to see that 

361.02 362.66 A: (( oh yeah )) 

361.48 372.52 B: and even when it comes to where it handles tax cuts which i favor i get sick to see conservatives defending it because [laughter] it's just the way they do it i mean 

369.43 370.20 A: yeah 

372.12 373.07 A: (( i know )) 

372.47 380.35 B: it it it is it is bad but ah but yeah so is is is but it you know that that is 

380.38 391.08 B: or is bad but you have at least like that option you have options of of news i'm from costa rica and there's there's no political debating right there you know 

390.74 393.21 A: yeah no that that's true is that um 

393.30 399.11 A: ah yeah costa rica y- what kind of um government is it like a dictatorship 

398.53 400.53 B: no no it's a democracy 

399.96 401.26 A: (( it is )) 

400.60 405.82 B: yeah we've been a democratic government for a hundred and like ten years 

405.22 412.14 A: okay but you do you feel like there isn't as much opportunity for um public opinion or 

411.73 420.81 B: no yeah there is th- i mean there is a democracy there is free press and other stuff but the thing is that people just don't care about about politics 

420.61 421.42 A: (( mm )) 

420.96 427.04 B: and ah so there is not much discussion on on on issues 

426.44 427.47 A: oh 

426.95 437.50 B: for example th- recently the government raised taxes in th- there and there wasn't many disc- mu- much discussion about well were they good or were they bad or 

437.38 442.17 B: or which were going to be the all these political choice you have here 

441.78 443.10 A: mhm 

442.60 454.20 B: they they we don't have that so is is bad because people just assume that everything the go- everything that the government tries to do is good and ah that that's kind of bad you know 

450.49 451.42 A: right 

453.83 454.86 A: yeah 

454.24 455.59 B: but ah 

455.78 466.44 B: for example l- look at the tax cut they make here it has been taking place for two months and by the end of the debate people are really well informed or at least they know what's going on 

466.00 467.25 A: right 

466.66 469.42 B: and they try to figure ah they try to 

469.30 480.45 B: figure out what how that's going to affect them but ah we don't have that so i think that even when the media is biased at least well you still have options i mean 

472.60 473.43 A: (( mm )) 

480.08 480.85 A: right 

480.29 485.80 B: we have we have you have here right wing media and left wing media 

484.86 485.88 A: right 

486.21 496.07 B: media so i think one can find certain channels and certain subjects where you feel comfortable i guess 

494.73 495.69 A: right 

495.73 500.85 A: yeah no you're right i you know sometimes i wonder um 

501.45 505.30 A: when i see people that that um that get very 

505.65 510.88 A: um involved in politics ah in this country 

508.93 509.80 B: mhm 

510.56 512.37 B: mhm 

511.51 513.22 A: that i i wonder 

514.27 515.32 A: if 

515.37 518.15 A: because it it seems as though 

518.72 522.65 A: a lot of times the it's for personal gain 

522.86 523.94 B: yeah 

523.33 537.85 A: and and i see the people who do that are usually if if you look at a cross like congress and senators and presidents and and people who are in that political life there they're already very wealthy people 

537.74 539.57 B: (( mhm exactly )) 

538.16 546.06 A: ah and yeah and it's i mean it almost it's it's an unfortunate reality but it it's nowadays 

545.91 548.99 A: it seems like the only people who can actually 

548.26 549.51 B: afford 

548.78 550.70 A: afford to be in those positions 

550.00 551.13 B: yeah 

550.57 552.40 A: have to be you're right i mean it's it 

552.26 557.76 A: used to be the old the old way or the way that the the forefathers of the country 

557.64 570.05 A: you know they wanted to have you know the local or the regular person would be there to represent the people and they would take some time off from doing their regular job and then they would go back to their regular job 

564.05 564.92 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

569.62 570.69 B: yeah 

570.11 574.44 A: afterwards and people would take turns holding that position 

574.42 575.60 B: mhm 

574.98 580.23 A: and i see that in local government but even in local government you see 

579.56 583.18 B: it's getting more it's getting more pro i think [laughter] yeah 

581.27 582.13 A: oh 

582.51 583.66 A: (( terrible )) 

584.10 585.33 A: (( terrible )) 

584.95 599.89 B: [laughter] yeah i i i i i i see that for example i was i think that that was the intention like having a congress but not being a permanent congress maybe they would get into session like three times a year or something like that and they will go home 

598.60 599.59 A: right
