77.70 81.67 A: [noise] yeah what what do you with all the things that you make 

83.16 86.52 B: [sigh] [sigh] virtually just for home use and family and friends 

86.19 88.89 A: [noise] yeah you don't sell any of them or anything 

88.31 90.19 B: i'm considering it 

89.82 96.17 A: yeah [sigh] cause then it's not really a hobby is it or it evolves from a hobby to a kind of a job 

94.97 97.67 B: (( a full time thing yeah [lipsmack] )) 

96.49 98.60 A: yeah yeah [noise] 

97.97 103.13 B: but i do so many different hobbies to where i'm not never stuck on one particular thing though [lipsmack] 

102.84 109.41 A: [noise] yeah so how come why ah do you do so many different hobbies i guess you got to do something but i mean why ah [sigh] 

109.92 111.81 A: you just [sigh] like doing just 

110.69 115.29 B: i enjoy the challenge and the creation of what comes next and [sigh]

118.73 120.23 A: yeah okay 

120.75 126.10 A: that's cool [sigh] i ah you know i actually got into bird watching fairly recently um 

126.90 138.68 A: ah you know probably a year or two ago and [sigh] it was kind of a conscious decision because i decided that i needed a hobby like i needed to do something and ah [sigh] this seemed like a good one because ah 

138.95 150.45 A: you know you've got to spend time outdoors and it's a good way to travel and to see different things and so ah and it it's kind of weird like normally i think people pick up hobbies or som- because it's something that you're kind of interested in 

150.63 154.10 A: and they you know just are doing it and then they get more [sigh] 

154.20 161.10 A: i don't know knowledgeable about the subject and better at it and whatever but j- just one of those kind of like a conscious decision because 

161.14 162.91 A: [sigh] i kind of needed 

166.23 167.17 A: (( i don't know )) 

167.28 176.89 A: like something to really like hold my interest and really like focus on it and like really become try and become g- good at something and expert at something [sigh] you know what i mean 

175.34 176.57 B: (( [lipsmack] [noise] uh-huh )) 

176.59 178.30 B: right right [sigh] 

177.83 179.41 A: yeah 

178.49 180.53 B: do you spend much time on it 

180.66 187.30 A: um [lipsmack] yes and no [noise] probably not as much time as i would like but ah a fair amount 

187.40 197.64 A: it's ah it's really interesting thing and [sigh] the the problem for me is that i'm not real good at it yet so it's you know it's one of those things where it's a life time of experience and so [sigh] i like going with people that are [sigh] 

197.58 205.39 A: that are you know experts people that are better than me and they can help me out a lot so i like it a lot that way [laughter] it's easier that way [laughter] 

201.49 202.85 B: (( [noise] [noise] [laughter] )) 

204.57 205.58 B: right 

205.42 213.97 A: so how about you do you do you ah feel like the soap making and candle making what was oh and crocheting right or knitting um 

211.86 212.72 B: yeah 

213.32 214.31 B: crocheting 

214.19 223.63 A: crocheting okay yeah i know they're not the same words [laughter] um how did you how did you learn it did you just pick it up or do you take classes or do you have friends that you or are you in a club or [noise] 

222.38 223.34 B: i just 

223.51 224.85 B: teach myself 

224.68 225.87 A: yeah 

225.20 226.41 B: [mn] self taught 

226.36 227.84 A: (( totally ah )) 

228.06 232.08 A: [sigh] totally self taught or do you like have books or do you just you know 

231.20 233.20 B: just totally self taught 

232.78 235.15 A: [sigh] get the stuff and just go to town huh 

234.56 235.86 B: (( yes yeah [laughter] )) 

236.24 237.79 A: hm that's cool [noise] 

237.39 240.34 B: that's like on the candle making now i've had [sigh] 

240.44 249.63 B: a couple of batches i mean they they they done good [sigh] but when when it comes to the melt pool on 'em which is where it burns all the way to the edges of whatever 

249.95 264.53 B: thing that you've got 'em in which i'm using the little [sigh] eight ounce jelly jars [sigh] so i'm having to do a lot of tests and and i still haven't got a wick that's hot enough to go all the way to the edges [sigh] so i'm ordering me some more wicks today for that purpose 

253.67 255.25 A: (( [noise] okay )) 

264.75 265.74 A: so 

266.48 269.61 A: okay i don't totally understand can you can you explain it again 

269.31 275.10 B: [sigh] okay like ah i'm using the eight ounce jelly jars [sigh] okay my wick is centered 

272.17 274.33 A: yes yeah [noise] 

275.06 289.32 B: [sigh] but the wick does not get h- hot enough to melt my candle from edge to edge it leaves a little bit on the edges [sigh] so that means my wick's not hot enough for that particular size jar [sigh] so i'm having to go to a hotter wick 

280.29 281.21 A: oh 

289.17 295.17 A: [sigh] so is it [noise] like the larger the i don't know the jar the container the the hotter the wick has to be 

294.78 296.24 B: right right 

295.61 300.14 A: yeah [sigh] so you're just figuring all that out [sigh] trial and error huh 

298.39 299.26 B: yeah 

299.71 313.56 B: exactly [sigh] [noise] and so you you know you get the joy of bur- making the candle [sigh] well then you get the joy of having to burn it and wait to see what your melt pool's going to be like [sigh] so it's just a constant challenge and and something new [sigh] 

300.80 301.82 A: yeah 

309.31 310.31 A: yeah 

313.51 314.37 A: (( oh )) 

314.63 316.22 A: that's cool so ah 

317.24 320.17 A: [sigh] what um [sigh] kind of like how do you ah 

320.37 323.36 A: order like do you order the stuff through the mail or 

322.78 325.53 B: [noise] yeah i ordered it ah there's a 

325.99 339.50 B: place called bluegrass candle works out in kentucky and the reason i purchase my supplies from them is [sigh] their wax is one hundred percent soy wax which is grown here in the united states for the farmers so 

328.63 329.75 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

329.77 330.81 A: (( [noise] mm )) 

338.27 339.02 A: (( yes )) 

339.71 341.65 B: so i'm going with the all natural 

341.43 344.13 A: [noise] so what what's the other wax made of 

344.01 346.87 B: [sigh] ah you know you get the paraffin wax 

346.57 348.71 A: yeah what yeah okay okay 

348.31 351.16 B: which is the hard solid stuff [sigh] [sigh] 

352.15 353.18 A: yeah 

352.18 356.33 B: and the soy wax is ah more cleaner burning 

354.23 355.58 A: you know soy bean 

356.07 357.22 A: yeah 

356.64 360.29 B: you know you don't get all the black soot like you do off of the paraffin 

360.15 361.59 A: okay okay 

360.79 361.59 B: (( [sigh] )) 

361.97 365.14 B: so i decided to go with that since it was for the farmers anyway 

365.02 368.09 A: (( [sigh] [noise] [noise] [laughter] yeah that's cool [noise] [sigh] so how ah [sigh] )) 

368.10 372.19 A: what about [noise] what was the the one before that candle making and
