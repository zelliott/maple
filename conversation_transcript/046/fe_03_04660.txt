284.84 290.44 B: yeah yeah yeah yeah sometimes you know i work for a i work for a conservative 

290.28 301.54 B: economic big tank is is what i do research for so so occasionally we we actually go to rallies that he's speaking at or we we actually help organize them so 

301.34 315.87 B: i've seen him speak a couple of times this year so in that case i'm actually present to see the news happen but that's that's fairly rare that that we that we participate in those sorts of things we're a pretty small organization so 

315.86 322.76 B: so i don't don't see all of that but yeah i i i would say it's been it's been a while since i've actually bought ah a 

322.70 333.28 B: newspaper and i i really don't don't get a lot of my news from t._v. these days either because i just find that t._v. news is awful 

332.85 341.18 A: right so the ah the news in reference to um iraq that you've been reading um 

342.43 352.14 A: ah th- the war is basically over but ah there's still a lot of a lot of things to be done and i'm sure there's still fighting taking place right now right 

351.65 361.77 B: oh yeah yeah i mean ah ah absolutely i i mean i haven't been i- you know to to a certain extent i've sort of tuned out the ah iraq coverage 

361.63 375.31 B: um just because it's i mean i i don't know i'm still keeping an eye on it but it's not really an an area of policy that that interests me as much i i work i do research in economics an- 

375.45 376.50 B: and so 

376.30 386.24 B: so i've been i've been reading a lot about you know the tax plans and the the ah dividend tax cut and and the other other sort of ah 

386.21 391.93 B: economic taxation spending issues that have been going on in in congress right now 

391.49 392.38 A: right 

391.73 402.48 B: so i i i mean i i'm glad we won the war i don't really have a lot of strong opinions on it one way or the other and i'm not really paying that much attention to what's going on 

401.89 411.14 A: right so economically i don't know if you've been ah keeping up on it but new york is having a little problem economically well of course since the world trade center 

411.09 413.17 B: right right yeah 

411.70 415.98 A: but right now ah the ah governor governor pataki 

416.02 417.04 A: um

444.44 445.32 B: right 

446.55 448.09 A: teamed up together 

448.13 458.36 A: in opposing in opposing pataki's budget plans because they don't really address the ah the immediate needs of new york city new 

448.48 449.39 B: right 

457.71 459.57 B: right right 

458.89 466.83 A: york city is in ver- very dire straights need since the world trade center happened and ironically um

496.27 504.44 A: so i left my house at four o'clock in the morning so there was no traffic at all so i figured i'll take the shorter way which is going through manhattan 

504.60 505.47 B: right 

505.07 514.57 A: and i drove right into the world trade center at that moment you know during that time and the lights were on it was dark out all the lights were on in the world trade center 

514.40 520.97 A: and i finally passed it i said this is amazing i said you know i live here in new york city you know the greatest 

520.93 532.11 A: ah city in th- in the world like you know the capital of the world ah and i said you know i ca- it's unbelievable how how gigantic these buildings are and stuff and then 

531.13 532.02 B: right 

532.12 542.79 A: and then i went up up state to the catskills and i saw the ah the catskill mountains they have the big mountain ranges and i says oh now where would i like to live in the mountains or down in the city 

542.63 543.72 B: right 

542.91 544.22 A: (( and ah you know ))

549.27 550.79 B: yeah 

550.21 551.96 A: wow um 

552.21 565.62 A: and what happened was that morning that sunday the first sunday after that i went to a different church my regular church is ah right near the brooklyn bridge which is you know going towards manhattan so i figured i wanted to leave the ah the roadways 

562.87 563.72 B: right 

565.61 574.37 A: ah let the policemen firemen and emergency crews have access to the bridge so i went to a church locally in my neighborhood and um 

574.44 583.76 A: they said there was ah the pastor just happened to be down on the ground floor of the world trade center that day the pastor from my church he was doing some kind of ministry work down there 

583.78 590.23 A: and on the um maybe sixteenth floor was a parishioner from his church 

590.31 591.34 B: right 

590.56 592.88 A: the parishioner called him up on his cell phone 

593.30 599.59 A: and they spoke and the ah parishioner said the pastor i don't think i'm going to get out of here alive
