66.12 71.96 B: yeah i catch glimp- glimpses of the news in the evening but you know 

72.30 76.55 B: i'm so busy [laughter] so i don't know 

75.21 84.53 A: well i'm i'm not a t._v. person if i you know watch t._v. i think the last thing i watched was when the red wings were blown out in play offs 

77.97 79.07 B: yeah 

84.43 86.66 B: [laughter] 

86.28 88.13 A: and that was about a month ago 

87.77 90.17 B: yeah [laughter] that was a while ago 

90.59 91.67 B: um 

92.54 97.79 B: i guess you know other than that i mean i work and stuff you know and people are talking about current events 

97.83 100.59 B: um i get a lot of my information that way 

100.70 103.75 B: not that it's exactly reliable but [laughter] 

103.28 110.04 A: well in the morning i read the paper before going to work but it's being that it's a morning edition i'm you know 

110.07 112.68 A: actually reading yesterday's news 

110.16 113.11 B: you're catching up with yesterday right 

113.42 119.70 A: um turning the computer on at six thirty i'll check and see you know if there's anything earth shattering 

119.40 120.55 B: right 

121.44 127.89 A: but ah normally there's nothing you know [laughter] nothing that affects my world 

121.80 122.98 B: yeah 

127.30 134.70 B: yeah i'm the same way i have my head in the sand unless somebody tells me it's very important then i'll check it out [laughter] 

135.28 145.52 A: well for instance like ah september eleventh i was at home working and it's like until i got an email that says you know something was happening i had no idea [laughter] 

139.71 140.71 B: oh 

145.12 146.34 B: oh boy 

146.23 160.71 B: i actually ah woke up to th- and i turned the t._v. on and saw it and didn't understand what was going on because i was still half asleep well i guess nobody understood what was going on anyway but you know it really didn't make sense [laughter] in my ah sleepy state [laughter] 

160.57 161.61 B: um 

161.74 163.76 B: but yeah that was that was incredible 

165.00 174.97 A: oh but like i was saying earlier today's events seems like you know the middle east it's like who's going to kill themselves today and how many people can they take with them 

174.50 178.63 B: yeah fr- and how many virgins are they going to get in heaven 

178.73 181.03 B: (( for doing it [laughter] )) 

181.44 192.09 A: well the best one i saw is ah a joke on the internet and it's like they get there and there's george washington and th- they keep beating on him and virgins i said virginians 

187.69 188.74 B: [laughter] 

191.78 195.78 B: [laughter] that's a good one [laughter] 

196.80 202.38 A: so i don't know i'm not i'm not a big fan of organized religion and ah 

202.53 205.98 A: when it gets fanatical like that i think it's even worse 

205.73 207.09 B: yeah 

207.77 209.15 B: it's crazy stuff 

209.63 213.02 A: today they're saying that it was a nineteen year old woman 

213.99 216.60 A: which i i think is unusual 

217.10 219.87 A: an- and basically they're saying they can't 

219.96 224.16 A: identify the bodies conclusively so they have to take their word for it 

222.44 223.44 B: wow 

224.66 225.76 B: yeah 

224.77 227.72 A: but i mean normally it's the men that you hear about 

227.12 234.66 B: right well that top ranking official too that dr germ was a woman as well which was kind of surprising 

234.95 237.58 B: you know and she was very educated in ah 

238.39 240.53 B: you know biological warfare 

240.77 244.37 B: and masterminded you know probably the anthrax attacks 

244.41 245.78 B: just is to me amazing 

247.11 248.06 A: yeah 

247.78 251.13 B: although who knows probably some home grown nut 

253.41 257.12 A: well let's see we got a suicide bomber on a bicycle 

257.02 258.04 B: [laughter] 

259.46 274.28 A: but i i i guess i mean living in america you just don't understand the how the why or you know why would somebody do this why why would you kill yourself to kill other people i mean if if it was personal i understand but you know 

268.39 269.57 B: right 

270.64 271.60 B: right 

274.34 275.42 B: yeah 

274.34 276.41 A: these are people you don't even know 

276.11 277.37 B: right 

277.47 279.79 B: these are people that haven't done anything to 

280.63 286.63 A: right this this last one they were stopped by the security guard at the mall 

287.27 290.51 A: so it could have been much worse 

290.22 291.96 B: (( you right wow )) 

293.17 294.30 A: but ah 

294.68 297.07 A: this is the fifth one in three days 

299.03 300.24 B: crazy 

299.40 302.76 A: peace in the middle east it's not going to happen in my life time 

302.19 305.61 B: yeah oh we can keep hoping i guess 

305.56 306.19 A: (( [laughter] )) 

306.38 310.32 A: well as long as they keep it over there i'm okay with that 

310.41 313.46 A: it's the bringing it over here thing i've got a problem with 

312.95 318.39 B: oh yeah it it always brings it closer to home and then yeah yeah that's when you feel it 

318.51 321.18 B: it's easier to ignore when it's over there anyway 

321.36 329.78 A: i i i don't think it's ignore so much as it's like they're killing themselves you know they'll eventually get done with it when there's only one person left 

329.57 330.37 B: (( hm )) 

331.75 337.14 A: i i i guess that it's the american mentality you just don't understand that you know 

336.27 337.07 B: right 

338.20 347.26 A: you know if it was over land or if it was but no you're you're just killing yourself because somebody's promised you and told you you can have a good life after you die 

347.09 348.00 B: right 

353.12 354.08 A: (( oh )) 

353.20 354.29 B: incredible 

356.16 362.37 A: but it seems they've been laying off the american soldiers over there which is always a nice thing [laughter] 

361.57 363.12 B: yeah [laughter] 

363.98 365.15 A: well i 

364.41 367.05 B: bring our boys home [laughter] 

366.44 379.93 A: i i you know a couple of weeks ago they were getting into you know the ah car bombings at the check points and it's like you know when they didn't stop and the american soldiers start shooting it's like they're wrong 

374.71 375.71 B: yeah 

379.55 380.65 B: right 

380.44 383.66 A: and it's like i'm sorry i did my four years 

383.58 384.67 B: [laughter] 

384.10 389.12 A: you get in something like that you know it's happened some place else you don't take chances 

388.55 389.64 B: right 

389.37 390.51 A: i mean 

391.76 392.69 A: (( you know )) 

391.97 394.94 B: you can't wait to ask questions later 

395.01 399.14 A: exactly [laughter] 

395.14 396.06 B: (( you know )) 

399.43 400.81 A: so it's 

400.91 401.80 A: (( you know )) 

401.96 406.18 A: i don't know how long how long do you think they're going to be over in ah iraq 

406.35 409.59 B: i don't know you know i keep thinking that they're going to be home 

409.70 416.17 B: but i guess they have to wait until some kind of government is set up you know a lot of them will be over there anyway 

416.28 418.36 B: sure some are coming home now but 

419.02 420.17 A: (( yeah )) 

419.24 423.80 B: yeah i don't know how long this is going to take how much of a government is needed [laughter] 

422.45 423.40 A: [laughter] 

424.13 428.90 A: well basically they can't trust any of the police that was existing 

428.46 429.83 B: right 

429.85 430.80 A: and 

429.92 437.86 B: but how what are we going to do you know [laughter] are we going to go out and recruit people hey want to be on our police you want to be a government official or 

438.08 439.88 B: (( you know what choice do you have )) 

438.46 440.81 A: we've got plenty of jobs open 

440.51 443.78 B: yeah [laughter] we trust you it's okay 

444.92 446.58 A: well i i guess that was 

444.93 446.77 B: (( [laughter] i mean who can you trust )) 

446.78 452.71 A: that was my big problem going over there it's like okay you're going to get rid of saddam and then what 

452.50 453.47 B: yeah 

453.65 460.57 A: and it's it's it's a big question and i don't know that you know bush had an answer for that 

460.80 461.79 B: well you 

462.31 463.33 B: you know you 

463.41 472.11 B: knock down iran so that and you build up iraq to get rid of that problem and then you got iraq too big and too sinister and [laughter] 

472.29 473.23 B: (( you know )) 

473.35 474.70 B: (( how do you fix it who's )) 

475.54 476.67 A: (( well )) 

475.55 479.40 B: going to be the next country that's gonna you know fall in this 

479.95 487.42 A: syria looks like the next one [laughter] we're just going to connect the dots over there one little country at a time 

480.41 481.51 B: that they've set up 

486.81 488.60 B: (( yeah it's )) 

489.71 492.37 B: horrible you know it's you can't win 

492.80 496.46 B: you know you can say oh it's horrible blow em all up oh that's terrible but 

496.88 499.58 B: [laughter] we're just doing it slowly [laughter] 

499.63 506.40 B: you know we let one get a little more powerful a little too powerful a little too evil and then take that out and you know 

506.86 515.69 A: well then people are saying you know the american's are terrible for starting this war and it's like they took so many precautions to make sure they only hit military targets 

513.19 514.13 B: right 

515.52 516.81 B: right 

515.81 518.33 A: and um 

518.40 525.70 A: i know like during the gulf war saddam had a whole bunch of his people that he killed that he just tossed out the bodies and said oh the americans did it 

525.20 526.26 B: wow 

526.61 527.82 B: that's horrible 

528.09 533.73 A: so i it still doesn't look like they found any you know biological or chemical weapons 

533.71 537.70 B: yeah that would help our case a little bit if they came up with it [laughter] 

536.77 542.51 A: well i'm i'm wondering if some are going to be planted just you know so we could find them later 

542.11 544.84 B: right i wondered about that too 

544.93 554.88 A: [laughter] because it's well they're saying well they've got these mobile labs and you know you can believe that to some point but ha- you know you've got to have a stock pile somewhere 

554.47 555.87 B: right 

555.69 566.80 A: i mean even if you could have labs all over in semi trucks it's not a big deal but you you know have to have some way to deliver it and you have to have you know some stock pile 

564.48 565.35 B: right 

566.67 571.94 A: i mean all you can hold in a semi truck's a nice start but it you know what are you going to do after that's gone 

571.91 573.13 B: right 

573.97 575.06 A: so i 

575.51 583.67 A: i don't know i i think we were pretty weak on our reasoning for going in but i'm sure that you know there's some iraqi people that are happy that we did 

583.35 589.80 B: right i hope [laughter] i hope that somebody understands why we're doing it you know beyond us 

590.24 596.15 A: right and it's i i i guess i saw a lot of things during the time and it was like ah 

596.23 599.54 A: people are accusing us well we're just doing it for oil
