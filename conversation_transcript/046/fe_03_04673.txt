271.62 272.59 A: yeah 

275.87 277.70 A: oh my god

286.55 287.40 A: (( so )) 

287.68 294.53 A: this this a- i i imagine you became somewhat i don't know if you're jaded because of what you've seen but 

294.61 298.32 A: ah did you have any loved ones over there 

298.92 301.49 B: no no i didn't 

300.83 310.88 A: but you know what even though i had as i say a surrogate son every person and i'm no i'm not a liberal i'm just right of attila the hun but i 

309.22 312.18 B: uh-huh [laughter] 

311.96 321.11 A: think i think every person whether it be iraqi or the united states had a loved one that was being shot at and it just it 

320.76 321.77 B: right 

321.05 327.87 A: tore me apart and you know it's something that we had to do have to do i agreed with it a hundred percent i like ah 

328.05 333.37 A: president bush because he's just a down home boy sort of thing eloquent as 

333.61 336.90 A: that other president you know clinton 

335.57 341.32 B: [laughter] who [laughter] do you remember the time 

338.20 349.98 A: exactly who is he you know he won't stay out of the news he just won't stay out of the news and i'll tell you what that affects me a whole lot when he won't stay out of the news 

343.83 346.11 B: [laughter] 

347.54 348.65 B: i know 

349.34 357.01 B: i know and it's ah i'm a conservative republican [laughter] so i'm not a liberal 

356.66 367.44 A: those are the things that that really affected me and i i kind of concentrated on that of course and then we've got this lacy peterson thing and you know you being a cop 

367.24 368.17 B: yeah 

367.96 372.04 A: i'm sure the even the cursory evidence that ah 

372.19 378.03 A: that we've gotten [laughter] kind of points his finger my question to you then would be 

373.84 374.91 B: oh yeah 

378.32 389.39 A: you know in this country no matter this guy so was o._j. guilty as hell but you know what he's he deserves a fair trial how is he going to get one with all this media 

389.19 393.25 B: well you're not going to get a fair trial and then you're going to get um 

393.76 402.61 B: ah the judge who is right out in the forefront and ah you're wondering if this is going to bias him 

397.40 398.58 A: yeah 

402.65 404.87 B: or her and ah 

405.19 410.33 B: i i i i have a hard time with the with the justice system i'm sorry to say 

409.91 411.84 A: well you know you no 

411.95 426.42 A: seriously i have no problem with that statement ah i i know that we're trying to improve all the time but you know the justice system has people people have opinions they have their biases and it just it gets screwed up 

426.34 428.04 A: it just does 

427.74 439.77 B: i'm listening to the reports ah from tampa ah in fact i was listening to not only the b._b._c. but i was listening to um n._b._c. and they were talking about ah 

440.14 451.53 B: they have a particular portion of a neighborhood which the police are making a real concerted effort into ah cracking down on crime so for for two weeks 

451.48 457.51 B: they actually have criminals who have been in and out of the court system at least ten times 

457.08 458.42 A: (( yeah )) 

458.16 460.03 B: (( and why )) 

459.87 466.10 A: well you know i i i can only assume that the philosophy is i would rather 

466.46 469.57 A: let ten men go 

469.66 476.28 A: than to prosecute and find guilty an innocent one i think that's the premise 

476.34 477.31 B: yeah 

476.97 481.11 A: and th- that's a fair one but i'll tell you those those 

481.30 484.44 A: those nine that get lose sure raise hell
