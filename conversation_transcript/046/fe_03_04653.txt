148.01 149.04 A: mhm 

150.66 155.31 B: they were saying when i was in the news business that people my age 

155.02 155.94 A: mhm 

155.57 161.44 B: were about the bottom limit of people who read the paper every day i mean probably uh 

161.73 167.93 B: your demographic you probably for the last when's the last time you really considered the paper your main source of news 

167.72 170.47 A: oh it's been probably ten years i'd say 

169.50 173.38 B: yeah yeah i mean that's you know that's when i i guess i left the news in 

173.56 178.13 B: ninety or eighty ninety seven ninety seven yeah so that's what eight years 

177.59 178.77 A: mhm 

178.16 192.63 B: yeah seven years and so um yeah they were saying then that you know that uh increasingly you know newspapers are gonna gonna have to uh were competing with uh nobody's reading them i mean people it's a dying thing and 

189.94 190.94 A: mhm 

191.98 198.62 A: well my problem with it is just time time constraints i don't have time just to sit down and read the whole paper front to back 

198.42 199.77 B: i know i know 

199.01 201.80 A: and then it backs up and then it's old news and 

201.71 208.41 B: i know i know i know i guess i read i i got back and forth i mean i i always i i felt naked 

208.07 209.11 A: mhm 

208.49 215.06 B: when i lived in africa and i didn't have the daily paper i got used to it w- we got our news primarily from 

215.29 217.33 B: the radio from in the uh 

217.62 226.02 B: that's the only well we got bad news on print news but i mean good news it was bb- on the shortwave but um 

226.12 233.27 B: you know i [mn] i think it's depressing that a lot of people they [noise] uh you know they their their whole concept of news is this 

233.53 237.63 B: quickie you know kind of headline sort of wham bam 

234.88 236.00 A: mhm 

237.65 251.90 B: this is the news we want you to know uh a la c._n._n. and fox and you know those those real quickie kind of t._v. stations or and even the radio i mean even the radio stations are mimicking that and see that's what that's why 

241.66 242.89 A: yeah 

252.10 257.97 B: for people like you and actually me too because i don't i don't read the paper the way i used to 

257.55 258.37 A: yeah 

257.94 271.58 B: that's why u._s._a. today was born about fifteen years ago because if you notice there's no long very few one or two long articles everything else is just wham bam you know uh and pretty inclusive that kind of thing and so 

260.04 261.35 A: oh yeah 

265.49 266.96 A: oh yeah they're very short 

271.69 277.54 B: um that's modern trend right or wrong i mean probably i'm old enough i remember 

277.69 279.03 B: (( uh )) 

279.08 281.45 B: do do you remember the evening papers 

281.25 282.02 A: yeah 

281.73 284.21 B: the evening what was it called in kansas city i forgot 

283.54 287.30 A: well they had a kansas city star and a kansas i can't remember what the morning paper was called 

286.82 301.41 B: well the times the star was the morning paper the star was the evening paper and the times was the morning paper right and they merged and yeah i re- when i was in kansas city they the two combined but anyway it used to be i mean people got news from

291.24 294.28 A: times yeah i do remember that because my parents got it 

294.36 295.29 A: right 

301.60 309.35 B: [mn] excuse me from uh you know read the paper twice a day i think isn't that interesting it tells you something about our lifestyle 

305.84 307.04 A: mhm 

307.21 310.85 A: my parents did yeah [laughter] 

311.61 314.01 B: but uh do you have kids or

345.54 352.38 B: well that's you know still that's reading i mean you know you know i think it's sad that that the kind of commentary on uh

401.40 402.39 A: mhm 

409.39 415.01 B: my number one source of news would be still the newspaper probably two would be internet 

412.89 413.86 A: mhm

424.58 425.75 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

427.96 438.51 A: [laughter] well i would say number one for me would be the internet and number two is tied between i'd say the radio and the newspaper and i listen to talk radio on the way home from work 

438.64 444.41 A: and that's where i get a lot of you know they do a lot of political talk and and i get a lot from that

513.10 521.77 B: forty five minutes from where i live in cleveland to kent state on the radio and there's just yeah i did that a lot too and so that was a that was a good way to get news but 

515.90 516.78 A: mhm 

522.02 526.81 B: i don't know i think i sometimes just get burnt out on all of it i guess kind of go man

532.02 545.52 B: i know i do too and i just i'm going i just get burned out on the news i mean it's just sort of the same thing over and over again nobody's really doing much original you know or maybe i maybe i'm just cynically and i i hate it when i'm this cynical but it just 

538.31 539.15 A: (( yeah )) 

541.01 542.04 A: mhm 

545.48 548.78 B: i just it's just you know to reach and i don't know what they're

558.57 560.07 A: on our computers 

559.68 560.93 B: oh okay 

560.43 570.70 A: and so i we were talking about what did we watch before they had the war to report on because [laughter] that is the only thing that c._n._n. has report on non stop it seemed like 

571.15 572.45 A: for months 

571.46 573.98 B: it must be good for ratings i don't know 

573.30 576.79 A: i don't know but it's like there had to be news before the war 

576.40 578.32 B: [laughter] 

577.79 585.68 A: then [laughter] so i do get a lot from c._n._n. that way because i can turn it on and leave it on in the background of my computer and listen to it yeah
