254.74 255.97 A: i don't think so 

256.40 262.19 A: yeah the tours are kinda nice though i mean it depends on where you go um if i've done 

262.30 273.01 A: the miller brewery takes you on a tour and they a- and you can go in and see their ah factory machines and so forth and then afterwards you get two fear free beers and then there's mhm 

270.76 272.01 B: okay only two 

272.38 274.70 B: [noise] oh that sucks i was 

273.27 276.01 A: and then ah [laughter] but

323.28 324.14 A: (( [noise] okay )) 

325.02 335.66 A: there's a place ah there's a smaller brewery around here that has a has a friday night one [mn] you know kind of happy hour's five to seven and that's as much as you can drink so 

335.82 339.05 A: it's kind of it's kind of weird though it's kinda like sitting in a basement
