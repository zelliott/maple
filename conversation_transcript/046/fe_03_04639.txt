74.26 80.02 A: uh interactive games on the internet where you're uh in a group 

79.88 81.61 B: yeah i've done once 

80.03 82.20 A: and playing with other people 

81.83 82.84 B: yeah 

82.71 86.70 A: i've done that many times as a matter of fact i'm uh a 

86.95 89.29 A: would be programmer myself 

89.21 90.29 B: oh 

89.38 98.64 A: i'm in my senior year i'm going to be graduating from college and i hope to be a programmer of computer games so yeah i love 'em i think 

97.06 100.04 B: oh that would be great yeah 

98.70 105.70 A: yeah i think they're very interesting i think they keep people uh they give them something to do some people though 

104.31 105.33 B: yeah 

106.00 107.44 A: they take 'em a little 

107.90 112.87 A: uh beyond what they're meant for i mean they get to be a vegetable just like a couch potato 

112.54 113.59 B: true 

113.21 114.95 A: in front of the computer but 

114.34 117.57 B: true there's a lot of pros and cons to it 

117.18 119.44 A: absolutely absolutely 

117.95 122.99 B: you know there is i mean i do believe that some games are really good for kids because they 

123.24 136.49 B: especially like younger kids they can learn their maths skills and stuff like that they have software out for you know that sort of games that will teach kids and stuff like that and eye hand co-ordination is great you know it teaches them that kind of skill 

134.60 135.72 A: oh i mean 

136.34 143.64 A: i i the computer game is um if it's fun and it's learning i mean 

142.99 144.35 B: right 

143.68 147.98 A: that's that's the best way to teach i mean to make it fun 

146.27 154.02 B: it has to have a benefit too i think it can't be just you know frivolous i think it's necessary to have some kind of a goal to it 

154.58 155.69 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

155.14 159.16 B: and be enjoyable you know that way you get the best of both worlds 

157.54 160.05 A: absolutely mhm 

160.02 173.59 A: but that's not always the case no no you know some people just wanna vege out in front of a game just like you would watching t._v. or whatever and you play your game and kind of lose yourself in the game like some people lose themselves 

161.75 162.62 B: no 

164.23 165.44 B: (( yeah )) 

168.59 169.58 B: true 

173.71 179.09 A: in a book some people lose themselves in a game i've done the same thing myself 

176.17 178.12 B: right yeah i'm 

178.66 182.03 B: an avid reader myself i do love my books 

182.18 183.07 A: yeah 

182.53 187.72 B: you know i think that's and and there is a lot of benefit to that too you learn to spell right [laughter] 

186.50 194.86 A: well some games some games uh are just like you lose yourself in a novel i mean there's a game where you're 

191.98 192.95 B: right 

194.74 199.20 A: you uh like a role playing game where you actually become a person 

199.05 212.12 A: and you go through an adventure or you were trying to find a a mystery you know or you're trying to do something and you can absolutely lose yourself in in that type of game just like a novel 

201.57 203.32 B: something you wouldn't normally do 

205.29 206.36 B: right 

210.41 211.44 B: yeah 

212.01 215.55 B: i've never done one of those i've never played one of those role playing 

215.86 217.62 A: mhm 

215.97 220.88 B: never played one of those i know i really don't know how to go about doing 'em anyway 

221.56 227.40 A: well there's plenty of reading to do and there's plenty of clues to figure out and it's 

227.34 238.57 A: uh a lot of well there's interactive type things like you could do online or like through a c._d. i personally prefer the c._d. because 

238.58 248.14 A: uh i don't have a cable connection and it runs faster on the computer with the disk right in there you know what i mean but 

240.92 241.82 B: yeah 

245.62 246.59 B: right 

247.35 248.38 B: yeah 

248.53 252.52 A: if you have a fast connection the game can be pretty fluid 

252.58 254.99 A: and that can be good but 

254.29 256.50 B: yeah that's something i don't have 

256.23 267.49 A: i don't either i have a dial up so i probably i prefer most of my games that i play are uh on a c._d. rom on the disks that i have loaded into the hard drive myself 

258.10 259.04 B: yeah 

266.97 267.99 B: right 

268.22 272.13 A: but i that's not to say i haven't played the network games 

271.89 273.08 B: right 

272.49 273.32 A: (( have you )) 

273.33 276.25 B: i have like um cards um 

275.84 276.77 A: uh-huh 

276.37 277.75 B: (( like poker )) 

277.91 283.79 B: stuff like that with uh people online i've tried i've tried that a couple of times and that's been [mn] over a year or so ago 

277.93 279.32 A: mhm 

281.97 284.67 A: yeah or spades you can play online 

284.30 288.83 B: that was fun i enjoyed that you get to meet people and talk to them and stuff and 

285.37 286.27 A: yeah 

288.18 290.03 A: yeah 

288.96 291.01 B: but i've got a disk with uh 

291.19 293.41 B: oh it's a pinball machine game 

293.53 294.42 A: (( oh )) 

293.72 301.30 B: and i it just amazes how real it seems i mean it it moves fast and you really do have control 

297.18 298.96 A: oh yeah 

301.31 302.80 A: (( absolutely mhm )) 

302.18 305.46 B: totally shocking how well it's made and i you know it's 

305.49 315.97 B: that is something i never really play- played a lot pinball but i really do like it on the computer you know so it's i do enjoy that and it's got you on different levels 

309.37 310.16 A: (( uh-huh )) 

316.66 326.57 A: yeah that's uh well i mean they could have skins and different things like that you know if you if you give anything a chance it'd probably be fun you know 

321.28 322.72 B: mhm 

325.66 326.70 B: yeah 

326.55 338.10 A: like you might want to try that role playing game i i think you you'd probably like it whether it's on hard disk at home i mean if you like to read there's a lot of reading involved i mean 

337.58 338.62 B: yeah 

337.99 346.08 A: and there's also interactive movies and i mean you can oh yeah it's it's that's where you lose yourself 

341.54 342.74 B: oh really 

346.20 349.60 A: and some of 'em come out in a trilogy like um 

349.71 356.51 A: what type of books do you like to read generally i bet ya there's a game that that you could correspond to it 

352.36 353.62 B: oh 

355.81 360.12 B: oh probably 'cause i like star trek and i like like peter straub 

358.73 370.13 A: absolutely there's there's a game called elite force that is all that is totally trekkie you know i mean they have the klingons and it's a whole 

360.35 361.29 B: yeah 

362.60 363.72 B: yeah 

366.48 367.61 B: oh wow 

370.12 373.96 A: uh basically uh they're going to uh 

374.61 383.26 A: [cough] they're going to a planet i think and they're meeting a new planet that's not in the galaxy and they met up with the borg 

381.06 382.49 B: is that online 

383.30 393.23 A: no it's a c._d. that you buy and you can actually put it onto your computer and play along i think they also set uh have a version for playstation too 

384.50 385.74 B: oh 

389.12 390.26 B: oh wow 

392.82 393.95 B: yeah 

393.69 398.87 A: and i i have a playstation two myself but i'm more into the computer 

398.89 409.70 A: p._c. i think not not that you know but the playstations are great i mean they have some excellent designers for some of the games go ahead i'm sorry 

399.66 401.31 B: yeah yeah 

402.25 403.17 B: yeah 

406.41 407.68 B: (( well let me ask you )) 

407.83 409.22 B: (( let me ask you about the )) 

409.29 414.19 B: okay [laughter] i was going to ask you about the interactive movie one where do you find that at 

414.46 415.95 A: well uh 

416.10 419.62 A: most of the role playing have uh 

419.70 421.44 A: uh where 

421.79 423.17 A: you um 

423.34 425.05 A: they give you a scenario 

425.19 437.46 A: and then you play along through the scenario and you have different choices where you have to make whether your guy is going to go left or he's gonna go right and that would all determine what his adventure would be 

430.32 432.18 B: well is there a specific site 

434.21 435.18 B: yeah 

436.96 438.37 B: oh 

437.70 450.44 A: and then there would be little movie clips and different things different scenarios as you go along through the movie or through the game and i mean it's just like you really can lose yourself in the game 

444.02 445.22 B: yeah 

448.58 451.83 B: is there any specific sites on- online that you go to 

452.19 453.49 A: um 

453.66 458.29 A: well like i said it really would depend i mean if you liked star trek 

458.74 469.13 A: maybe do a google search and under games for star trek type games and i bet you elite force would come right up and you would be able to find it 

461.79 463.27 B: oh yeah 

464.06 465.08 B: yeah 

466.74 467.92 B: yeah
