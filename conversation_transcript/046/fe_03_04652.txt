0.11 1.39 B: hello 

0.99 2.30 A: hello 

1.82 3.09 B: how are you 

2.84 5.11 A: i'm pretty good my name is craig 

5.24 6.95 B: my name is wendy 

6.78 7.83 A: hi 

7.92 9.06 B: how are you 

8.69 15.19 A: i'm good well we're supposed to talk about where we find out about our current current events 

14.66 16.03 B: yes 

16.01 28.89 A: um i find out i used to get most of my information from the radio and the newspaper but now that i'm home most of the day i get most of it off the television and a little bit off of the internet 

29.44 32.57 B: well i guess we're pretty even in that way 

32.70 36.30 B: plus i also attend a lot of community forums 

35.95 37.35 A: i see 

36.84 38.04 B: (( and just a )) 

38.98 45.87 B: lot of alternative newspapers and i subscribe to a lot of magazines and read a lot of professional journals 

45.53 49.32 A: i see no i don't i don't really 

49.64 58.60 A: i used to read the newspaper every day when i was working and now i'm unemployed and so i just um like i said i get pretty much most of mine 

58.79 62.70 A: from the television although i really don't like to watch like the ten o'clock 

63.32 73.51 A: i i really enjoyed getting it from the newspaper because i could i could pick and choose the stories i wanted to read instead of having somebody you know give me all the the news 

74.87 81.75 A: i i really don't listen to the radio that much because it used to be that i would only listen to it while i was in my car 

81.86 87.00 A: like i said now that i'm unemployed i don't i don't uh spend that much time in my car 

86.61 91.73 B: well that is another resource if i think about it i do listen to a lot of talk radio 

91.44 92.44 A: uh-huh 

93.59 95.58 B: to hear the issues of the day 

95.33 109.80 A: yeah well i found that when i listen to talk radio it's i get i get frustrated it's not so much with the with the commentators but some of the people that call up i mean some of the things that they come up with 

109.71 114.48 A: it's just kind of ridiculous and i wonder you know where do they get th- their ideas from 

114.54 118.43 B: well i think that's probably the nature of the beast 

118.60 128.61 B: when it comes to talk radio and the purpose of it is to exchange ideas and to just kind of hear how different people think about different things 

128.67 130.48 A: yeah that's true too 

130.75 131.87 A: um 

134.76 140.70 A: one that's another another thing one reason that i don't really 

140.68 150.46 A: like the television news on just like the regular television news i think it's too much there's too much of a of a bias to it or 

150.69 153.32 A: um and they put too much 

153.80 160.86 A: emphasis on on on having features on there you know during their when their ratings periods are on 

161.00 163.59 A: just to to get people to watch 

163.66 165.07 B: oh that's true 

165.09 168.85 B: now that is [laughter] that is a real truth right there 

168.49 169.63 A: yeah 

169.03 172.68 B: that it news become entertainment 

172.51 173.74 A: that's true 

174.45 179.41 A: yeah that's why i really liked it when i was when i would read the newspaper i just don't 

179.94 181.91 A: don't do that much anymore 

182.67 189.62 B: and plus you have to be careful of some of those stories because you see where that young man just falsified all that information 

189.64 191.70 A: yes yeah 

190.65 198.95 B: in writing these stories and you have pulitzer prize winners who are now telling us how they actually lied 

198.34 199.66 A: right 

199.12 201.06 B: so it's a hard one 

201.11 205.33 A: i know i guess it's just the the pressure of coming up with with a 

205.46 208.29 A: story all the time but some 

208.45 211.82 A: i mean you have to believe believe somebody 

211.87 223.89 A: and you know you can't you can't check out every every uh person who's reporting you just have to take it on faith that what they're what they're telling you is is true and that it's you know it's their own their own story 

223.34 230.84 B: mhm oh yeah because if you didn't you would just spend an enormous amount of time just doing that 

230.71 231.70 A: right 

231.52 233.79 B: and none of us have that kind of time 

233.42 240.57 A: i know but then i know there are there are some people who they they won't believe anything that they any kind of reporting 

240.34 248.53 A: they think that everything is that the government is behind everything and it's it's spoon feeding us our our information 

249.01 253.80 A: so i i run into that a lot when i'm on the internet i go into chat rooms 

253.81 262.09 A: and there are some people with the you know the things that they say i i wonder to myself well how do they know you know where do they come up with this 

261.71 262.79 B: (( [laughter] )) 

262.21 270.88 A: it's just like [laughter] they just they just don't seem to believe any- anything it's just like with the war in iraq the you know they 

271.02 285.51 A: the people people are saying oh yes they that we found weapons of mass destruction but the government doesn't want to say anything well it seems to me that if they were found that that they would want to say anything just to prove that they were right in going in there in the first place 

285.94 287.79 B: now isn't that the truth 

288.34 293.82 A: but there i mean there's just some people who who i guess just don't don't wanna believe anything 

294.49 299.05 B: and sometimes i guess we have just seen through the years how 

299.31 313.07 B: these stories will be beefed up or they will be put out there and we believe it and we actually base out history and our lives on it only to find out when it's safe for them to release the information 

313.05 314.63 B: that it was a lie 

314.74 316.73 B: (( you know all along )) 

316.81 318.28 A: that's right 

317.75 318.74 B: so 

319.11 326.05 B: it we live in some very troubled times right now some very troubled times you just 

322.95 323.83 A: yeah 

326.16 331.77 B: what's the old saying it's you believe half of what you see and none of what you hear 

331.52 333.69 A: (( right [cough] )) 

334.84 335.77 B: so 

336.15 344.87 A: that's like now when they're to go on with what you're saying about how now they're they're releasing things so like but from back in the fifties and sixties 

345.15 351.67 A: and and i mean you know back then the people had no idea what was what was really happening 

351.13 356.62 B: mhm mhm [noise] you just kind of thought it was the luck of the draw [noise] 

356.47 357.44 A: yeah 

357.94 362.23 B: [noise] and now you find out that all kinds of things were going on 

362.42 363.35 A: right 

362.64 365.88 B: to uh help put people in a certain bind 

365.96 367.45 A: yeah 

368.35 371.27 A: so there is i mean there is some you know 

371.29 375.26 A: some manipulation of the news that's for sure 

376.60 378.25 A: and um 

379.67 384.97 A: you just kind of have to weed through it and i think you just have you know you just have to use your own commonsense 

385.78 386.83 B: (( oh yeah )) 

387.08 389.80 A: to know what you know what's what's i mean 

390.83 394.57 A: some things are believable and some things aren't 

396.34 399.71 B: and and some things are just very disturbing 

400.33 405.72 B: i find that a lot of the news is just very very disturbing 

406.12 408.67 B: the uh how people just take 

409.51 414.07 B: so much interest and pride in a man like scott peterson 

414.56 416.83 B: more or less making him a celebrity 

416.44 417.41 A: uh-huh 

417.07 421.93 B: for doing harm to his wife and unborn baby 

421.69 423.03 A: that's right 

422.46 431.97 B: you know it was on all kind of talk shows and you know people courted this man and i'm almost sure somebody will give him a book deal 

431.83 433.81 A: right and a movie 

432.15 433.00 B: (( you know )) 

433.37 440.11 B: or whatever and then you oh i look at um the court t._v. shows and all that they have 

440.35 446.44 B: like and i really and truthfully have a lot of problem with these reality t._v. shows 

446.70 447.67 A: yeah 

447.12 449.95 B: that take people like anna nicole smith 

450.00 451.26 A: right 

450.67 457.28 B: and just make her into a wealthy woman and when you look at what this lady is peddling 

457.32 459.83 B: would you want your daughter or your sister 

460.07 464.93 B: to emulate [laughter] something like that you know it's it's just really sad 

464.64 468.81 A: yes i know i've i watch that that show for 

468.91 476.69 A: i don't i think it was about i never watched the whole show i've seen it probably ten or fifteen minutes and it's just it's just a total waste of time 

476.63 484.21 B: and then the big news last week uh in one of the entertainment sections was jack osbourne checked into 

484.23 486.10 B: an alcohol rehab 

486.17 487.96 A: uh-huh [laughter] yeah 

486.96 490.25 B: and then you turn around and you look at the osbournes 

489.68 491.21 A: yeah that's another one 

491.90 494.22 B: (( it's just really and truthfully uh )) 

494.34 498.34 B: (( it's just real it's just really and truthfully a very sad )) 

499.14 500.54 B: sad situation 

500.94 503.90 B: it's a very very sad situation that we're 

504.10 505.21 B: living in 

505.62 507.41 B: and that we have to 

507.47 514.16 B: you know just be forever vigilant of what it is that the news is putting before us 

514.43 516.11 B: and how they're doing it 

516.24 519.69 A: yeah well and then too you know it's um 

520.73 529.87 A: i mean as an adult we should be able to you know tell tell the difference between what's what's relevant and what isn't but when the children was watching it you know 

529.80 535.82 A: when you have impressionable people like that i mean you know like i'm sure that to to a lot of people you know 

535.97 539.63 A: there's a lot of kids out there that wish that they were jack osbourne 

540.43 544.33 A: i mean they they watch that show and they just they just think that that 

543.65 546.12 B: and that dysfunctional family 

545.56 546.90 A: yeah 

547.48 548.32 A: i mean 

549.06 558.54 A: that's that's that's the people i'm worried about are the are the young people coming up now to get i mean they get everything from television 

558.21 559.33 B: oh yeah 

559.39 573.54 B: oh yeah and these news stories you know look at i don't know where you are but a number of the kids you know viol- if you just really and truthfully track the violence when one thing happens it's like a domino effect 

573.02 574.12 A: right 

573.56 577.44 B: this poisoning teachers is now a big thing 

577.29 578.31 A: uh-huh
