484.63 487.20 A: [noise] yeah it is it is nice it's a very 

487.02 494.60 A: it's very educational and um you see how other people live and you see the similarities and the differences just like here in the united states 

488.65 489.52 B: (( mm )) 

494.15 495.12 B: right 

494.42 508.26 A: you know chicago has it's own style um new york has its own style and then with i can only speak about where i where what i know but within new york you have boroughs like brooklyn is different than than say manhattan and you got different neighborhoods in brooklyn that are slightly different so

508.16 514.98 A: you know i i l- i like that i like the differences i like the similarities i think that's the beauty of god myself that's what i think [mn] you 

513.89 515.03 B: i agree 

514.82 525.25 A: know people always want to talk about the differences but look at the similarities and the differences are different ways of doing the same thing that's what the differences are [noise] it's all they are so i don't understand what the 

522.73 523.86 B: right 

524.09 526.94 B: right because everyone's trying to get to the same place 

526.52 536.77 A: exactly exactly and i don't understand why people you know they they they they hate on each other so much you know they they they hate on each other i'll give you an example because um yesterday 

536.96 550.05 A: [lipsmack] ah brooklyn can be very rough i just moved back to brooklyn last year i was living in south carolina previous to that [noise] i came back to where i grew up at and um i got back to my roots basically i'm walking across a little park w- a little park

554.68 555.58 B: okay 

555.27 569.37 A: and um [noise] i see the guy these two guys they're arguing so i didn't pay [noise] no attention to it they're about maybe a good twenty feet twenty feet away from me right across the grass all of a sudden i hear pow pow tw- two gunshots and see the guy grab something from the other guy and run 

569.44 576.64 A: i'm like holy cow this guy just shot this guy out in four o'clock in the afternoon on saturday afternoon yesterday afternoon i could not believe it 

571.63 573.14 B: oh my god 

576.80 581.56 A: you know it's it's so it's so sad that how people you know they they they have differences 

581.68 592.96 A: [noise] evidently they had a difference of opinion and this guy was willing to shoot this guy kill him yeah risk his life and also risk his own life by shooting this guy because [noise] now he's going to jail 

586.10 587.74 B: over that yes 

592.34 594.14 B: right exactly 

593.57 599.89 A: you know i i don't understand that that's why i'd rather yeah this this is gonna be a rough summer in new york i know that much [noise] it's gonna be a rough summer
