124.64 127.50 A: but ah it- it's just one of those ah 

127.74 132.65 A: kind of fantasy games but not a role playing game 'cause that's again too complicated 

132.07 133.26 B: (( right okay )) 

133.54 136.27 B: [mn] so what other um besides yahoo 

136.41 142.07 B: do you go on i mean do you have do you get like pop up adds where you have to download games okay 

141.44 147.01 A: yeah all the time all the time they come up no matter what i click on either if if it's for 

147.06 151.11 A: games or for travel or something it just comes up all the time

151.83 153.03 B: (( wow okay )) 

153.43 156.39 A: [mn] but other than that i i ah the only 

156.80 166.58 A: ah consoles i have ah i just have a playstation because [noise] i just play a hockey game on there but again not too complicated it's just ah 

158.69 159.72 B: mhm 

166.91 172.92 A: you know two people rather than five people you don't have to do any line changes or anything like that in a real hockey game 

171.04 172.97 B: (( exactly [noise] )) 

173.25 177.22 B: [noise] i just had to um find out like when i was playing checkers 

176.72 177.77 A: right 

177.18 185.38 B: i had to um it it was kind of complicated because there was so many buttons that you had to push that i didn't know when the person was there or not 

185.30 194.66 B: so i think what what i to do was go to um where i saw somebody at and push i forgot what it [noise] what it had on it um 

195.08 198.00 B: [mn] just to push a button to go inside of a room 

197.86 198.75 A: right 

198.15 212.28 B: you know and it sai- an- and i didn't understand when it said the person wants to draw you know and calling and i didn't know that they were talking about calling it a draw because they knew i was winning so i guess they wanted to exit out of it you know [laughter] 

206.52 207.71 A: right right 

211.50 216.07 A: i i'm still not sure all the rules of checkers i i used to think that if it's 

214.08 214.90 B: no 

216.16 219.70 A: you know kinda like tic tac toe the person who goes first always wins 

220.16 227.25 A: 'cause that person that does checkers always puts that one piece out there first and then the middle is always theirs you know it 

226.49 232.36 B: mm right but you really have to concentrate o- when you playing checkers because i mean it's like you have to look 

232.46 245.89 B: it's like playing um it's like doing a crossword puzzle you have to look you know diagonally and all that other stuff now you know when we play checkers o- in the real world [laughter] you know you you can jump your king 

235.56 236.40 A: mhm 

242.64 243.50 A: [laughter] 

246.02 248.42 B: from a checker that's in the middle 

248.43 249.36 A: right 

248.43 251.91 B: now when i tried to do that online you couldn't do it 

252.02 255.98 A: i- i'm still not sure of the rules i don't know what [mn] like when ah 

255.14 259.67 B: well e- evidently they changed it online i was like wait a minute now you know 

259.12 261.95 A: there's different rules online than in the real world 

261.54 268.57 B: well try try to jump a man while he in the middle online and see what happens [laughter] they won't let you do it [laughter] 

264.99 266.44 A: [laughter] 

267.91 273.00 A: i'm not even sure what what a king is 'cause you know you always see in the shows you know king me 

271.27 283.30 B: well [mn] [laughter] exactly they put another they put another checker on top of the checker and once you get on their their back line you know once you get on their side and that on the b- back line 

283.06 285.29 A: and what's the advantage of that 

284.97 288.66 B: that you can jump forward backwards you know 

288.23 289.60 A: oh oh okay 

289.04 290.69 B: yeah so [lipsmack] 

290.76 296.16 B: i think the the main object is besides getting crowned the king 

296.52 299.72 B: is to get all the checkers off [laughter] you know 

299.22 300.32 A: [laughter] 

299.84 301.37 B: [noise] just like um 

302.01 303.60 B: [mn] um i think they have 

303.76 305.53 B: what is that game um 

305.63 308.26 B: [mn] i'm not sure if they have connect four online though 

308.68 311.44 A: so this topic was computer games 

310.91 312.47 B: yeah exactly 

311.90 316.76 A: so i i know definitely they've they've ah come a long way from 

316.84 325.60 A: from when they first started coming out in the eighties and and early nineties but ah now they they didn't even have games online like this 

324.88 328.22 B: no not at all not at all we had to do um atari 

327.81 334.04 A: yeah [laughter] exactly atari was the first [laughter] and pacman in in nineteen eighty three 

328.50 332.40 B: [laughter] yes uh-huh

334.59 335.63 A: [laughter] 

336.85 345.78 A: yeah yeah see they've they've come a long way that's why you know i'm sorta stuck in that generation with the the not too complicated you know pong kinda games

418.53 422.22 A: like ah like one of the pop up adds comes up i think ah it was called

426.78 427.87 B: wow 

437.10 443.30 A: you pay a fee or or a nominal fee something like that monthly i don't know and then you can play it online 

443.50 444.36 B: yeah 

443.61 445.43 A: i've never done it but [noise] 

446.14 447.12 B: um 

448.22 461.96 B: well they have i i did- i never understood 'cause my sister would be playing games all the time she says well i'm i'm online playing a game and i wa- i was always wondering well how do you get to a game so when i made yahoo my page you know my website page 

461.49 462.77 A: your home page 

462.15 469.37 B: my home page that's it i you know i saw the games on there and then you know they have kid games on there and everything so 

463.29 464.30 A: yeah 

469.46 471.98 B: you know that was pretty interesting 

471.96 475.17 A: one that i like is ah text twist 

475.27 476.44 B: [lipsmack] oh what's that 

476.01 481.10 A: it's ah i it was recommended by my cousin who always beat me at scrabble [mn] and ah 

480.16 481.71 B: [laughter] 

481.07 491.73 A: it's i think you get six letters and ah it's a six letter word but they scramble the letters and you have to make as many words as you can out of those six letters 

491.19 493.46 B: (( oh get out oh wow [noise] okay )) 

492.44 496.63 A: and i think you get ah i don't know two minutes or something like that and then 

496.73 498.73 A: [mn] you you click on a letter 

498.50 503.43 A: and [mn] i think the minimum is three for example you can have a a three letter word 

503.19 518.06 A: four letter word five letter word so they have all the all the words that are possible to be made out of that and as you make each word it shows up on the side and then the object is to get all the words and then you get the most points so if you don't get the six letter word 

517.96 524.04 A: then you know you fail you stop right there but if you get the n- the six letter word you go onto the next round 

524.31 530.11 B: well what if you don't know the word you know what i mean like if you have a or now 

527.75 533.53 A: yeah well you can get some but then at the end at the end when the time's up it shows you what words you missed 

533.34 537.51 B: that sounds like a game i played online too where you 

537.56 540.45 B: um unscrambled or i- it was like um 

540.64 542.04 B: [lipsmack] wheel of fortune 

541.35 543.20 A: wheel of fortune yeah 

542.65 550.25 B: yeah it was something that and you ah and the monkey drowned or something drowned or something went into the hole 

548.81 551.70 A: a monkey drowned what kind of wheel of fortune 

550.17 563.10 B: or or s- or s- or something went into the hole one of the animals went into the hole when he was upset with you or something like that you know it was funny though but i i wouldn't you know i- you know it would give you the topic of it you know [lipsmack] and it was so funny because it 

555.23 556.98 A: oh [laughter] 

563.29 567.17 B: um eighties related music you know so 

565.82 568.33 A: oh that's my category [laughter] [laughter]
