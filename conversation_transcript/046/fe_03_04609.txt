11.79 13.34 A: [noise] oh computer games 

12.93 18.27 B: yeah they asked whether you play them online or or with a cd [mn] 

17.71 19.00 A: with a c._d. 

18.62 20.02 B: yeah 

19.43 29.67 A: oh okay um hm no i don't really play on i don't really play computer g- ah [laughter] i don't have a computer to play computer i play like um well i like as far as playstation 

29.83 31.10 A: (( you know i mean that )) 

30.27 32.95 B: yeah i think that would be considered a computer game 

32.40 38.17 A: yeah okay well yeah i was just playing that a minute ago [laughter] so is basically um what i play is um 

34.68 35.64 B: okay 

38.19 42.60 A: um just you know on a c._d. a c._d. yeah on a disk 

42.19 43.13 B: okay 

43.07 44.91 A: yeah how about yourself 

44.64 56.68 B: um i played some c._d.s on my on my computer i like ah golf and i like um maybe a baseball game or football or something 

48.39 49.38 A: uh-huh [noise] 

56.72 59.83 B: you know the the john madden football's kinda fun [mn] 

59.06 63.56 A: (( mm ah okay yeah my son ah [noise] he likes a lot of the sports and everything )) 

62.39 63.25 B: yeah 

63.26 77.62 B: i it's funny with the golf game i find that you have to kinda s- set a rhythm [mn] to hit the ball and it's almost like a real golf rhythm so someti- [laughter] if i play enough of it i kinda find myself in that same rhythm when i'm actually on the golf course so 

77.68 80.08 A: oh y- you actually play golf also huh 

79.50 80.83 B: yeah [mn] 

80.30 85.72 A: oh okay yeah 'cause um i i think i tried ah a golf game on the computer 

85.59 99.36 A: but i never you know really got the hang of it [mn] because i don't know i- it seemed like you can zoom in and zoom out i think i but i think also as far as aiming you know ah the distance of your ball and everything 

99.21 108.34 B: well you have to really you have to really read the instructions on those things 'cause they're kinda complicated you know because if you're putting on a green you have to you could you should be able to read the 

99.59 100.35 A: and 

104.50 106.31 A: (( um )) 

108.34 114.86 B: slope of the green and all that and and ah i don't know i i kinda just get on and play and then i kinda learn it as i go 

109.78 111.91 A: (( oh [noise] )) 

112.74 113.93 A: (( [noise] )) 

115.03 119.57 B: um i have one where arnold palmer you play against arnold palmer 

119.62 133.68 B: and it's more realistic because he plays like arnold palmer does today not the way he did thirty years ago so sometimes he hits it in the water sometimes he drops a shot and and it's it's kinda good ah so you can actually beat arnold palmer some time 

124.99 126.19 A: (( [noise] )) 

134.26 138.08 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

136.23 149.68 B: ah there- there's a jack nicklaus one too and he's about the same age as palmer but h- he's he's ruthless he he just he hits the green from two hundred yards out i mean he you just can't beat him he's he doesn't play fair at all so 

149.00 151.51 A: [laughter] 

150.15 152.48 B: so i'd rather play arnie [laughter] 

152.19 164.14 A: [laughter] it's amazing that they could be so realistic i think yeah that's ah some of the other games i know like as far as the sports you know the basketball and the football ah it seems like the players you know they get the or the characteristics 

164.22 166.27 A: of the actual people and everything 

165.63 167.90 B: yeah they actually do ah film 

167.96 173.59 B: the the star players and actually then digitize their motions to the video game 

173.26 175.73 A: (( [noise] yeah i think that's kinda neat the way ah )) 

175.75 178.78 A: technology's really moving in that direction [noise] like that you know 

177.47 182.94 B: yeah it is yeah the basketball one's fun to watch ah on on a on a video game yeah 

180.07 181.01 A: yeah

184.47 198.94 A: ah well i i the games i only play are maybe like the driving um i don't know it's it's ah a game i can't think of the name of that thing it's a guy who goes to different like planets and has different missions and everything like that i kinda like 

195.13 196.90 B: yeah there's there's a 

198.79 209.35 A: they have um one i think has come out you know the the movie the matrix reloaded is starting they have a a video game that's supposed to be coming out that's supposed to be you know really similar to the movie and they 

203.14 204.13 B: yeah 

207.52 208.12 B: (( [noise] )) 

209.35 217.12 A: say it's going to be really you know really [noise] interesting so i'm kinda looking forward to maybe getting a play ah getting that and playing that sometime [noise] soon too

218.20 219.16 A: [noise] 

220.13 220.87 A: (( [noise] )) 

220.52 223.21 B: well my my son has this grand theft auto

269.15 280.63 A: they had he had different ah i guess weapons and ah [mn] th- that's one of the games that they had on the news the other day as a matter of fact as one that um kinda too violent i think 'cause they had the blood splatter and all that you know yeah 

274.16 275.40 B: right yeah 

278.95 285.19 B: yeah yeah i i kinda would if i had younger kids i really wouldn't want 'em to do that but 

284.46 296.79 A: right right you know 'cause [laughter] some of get the idea that um you know they think they can go ahead and and i guess you know when they do things you know they're just it's sort of like you know everything will be all right afterwards you know if they do something bad 

295.65 297.30 B: (( [laughter] )) 

297.38 302.12 B: do you ever do any um casino games online or on in a c._d. or anything

322.39 324.61 B: sl- slot like a slot machine 

325.16 327.27 A: (( oh oh okay [mn] mhm ))

335.89 336.99 A: (( yeah )) 

336.88 348.56 B: but i i don't you know they have some websites where you can actually go in and and give 'em a credit card number and actually play for money now that that's kinda dangerous i don't think i'd want to even try that [laughter] 

337.19 338.35 A: and 

345.95 347.69 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

347.79 351.22 A: yeah i kno- so what is it you give 'em ah like a credit card number 

350.71 352.16 B: yeah 

351.46 353.23 A: (( oh yeah i don't think that's )) 

352.24 364.60 B: gives you a line say you want to play with a hundred dollars and you're playing video poker or something and if you win a hand and then it it ah you know when you when you finally cash out then they either debit your credit card or add to your credit card 

363.12 367.44 A: (( [noise] [laughter] [laughter] well )) 

364.84 371.41 B: [laughter] i could lose money just fine in a casino without this i don't need to be doing this in my home [noise] 

371.02 374.40 A: (( yeah yeah i agree i yeah it's all )) 

374.67 381.19 A: and ah i don't know they it seems like there's so many things on ah the um the web these days um 

381.26 391.10 A: that it's you know it seems like [mn] it's hard to keep control 'cause they say that um [mn] i think um well i guess it gets off the subject of games a little bit but some of the items that you can um [mn] 

384.02 384.96 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

391.13 399.83 A: get in there you can it's illegal to you know to to maybe have you know access to and ah it seemed like they wouldn't let you put it on there in the first place 

395.48 396.69 B: yeah 

399.22 405.30 B: well i think they're all they're all from osh- offshore i i don't think there's any u._s. based company that can do that 

405.12 406.54 A: (( ah )) 

405.42 409.26 B: and i think how they get around it is that you're probably playing with a 

409.27 419.01 B: um a casino that's in mexico or [mn] or ah canada or something so that's but um i you know i used to get a lot of spam on that stuff and i just delete it 

414.80 415.61 A: (( really )) 

418.75 419.78 A: (( mhm )) 

419.42 422.42 B: [mn] because i don't really want to get started on that stuff 

421.88 422.80 A: (( yeah )) 

422.81 425.91 B: um sometimes i will play um 

423.15 424.10 A: [laughter] 

426.15 428.77 B: [lipsmack] hearts or 

429.32 442.48 B: um cribbage online there's a [mn] there's a on the m._s._n. [mn] um [sigh] web there is um group cribbage games you can get in you look for n empty chair and then you just play cribbage against somebody
