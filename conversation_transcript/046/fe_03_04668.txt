5.88 8.25 A: hi george good evening to you too 

8.04 10.11 B: i guess ladies first 

10.05 10.96 A: (( um )) 

11.23 16.71 A: well i guess mostly i listen to n._p._r. in the morning and then 

16.82 19.69 A: ah i read the new york times on line also 

19.65 23.85 B: see i read the new york times on line as of the past month or so 

23.92 29.26 B: i normally listen to the local television ra- the the local all news station 

29.43 42.57 B: and occasionally i can get i listen to a lot of news in the car i don't have cable and national public radio no offence i don't agree with a lot of their stances so not not not not stances per se i don't 

33.55 34.39 A: uh-huh 

39.25 40.97 A: [laughter] 

43.00 46.04 B: things that they consider to be newsworthy i don't 

45.85 49.81 A: ha the problem there the sort of personal interest stories and things 

49.18 53.01 B: i i i enjoy the personal interest stories but i'd rather listen to the news 

53.40 68.07 B: i ah like ah you know they have the news and they'll say like andrea that was a very nice story you did no offence i have no i don't i don't dislike you but i really don't care but i i like i find myself reading three or four newspapers a day 

64.03 65.65 A: right right 

68.03 69.46 A: right right 

68.67 72.61 B: and ah and now that i have a computer that i can go on the internet 

73.10 85.22 A: yeah i do that at work also i mean i have access to the internet at home and at work so i read the new york times on line that way i don't have to pay for it and and i rarely watch the t._v. news but 

80.54 81.35 B: well that's 

84.86 94.88 B: i'll i'll watch the local television news i work in a courtroom so like i'm a court reporter by trade so i like to find out what's going on in my what area do you live in 

90.72 91.59 A: uh-huh 

95.09 97.35 A: um i live in moleman city 

96.93 105.68 B: oh okay no i i date a woman who lives in new york city lives in a village but i like to know what's going on in my immediate area because i'm a court reporter so like if a 

105.90 113.71 B: horrible crime happens i might get a call from the attorney that represents the person that may or may not have done it [laughter] because they might want somebody in the court room 

113.85 119.30 B: to write down so i sort of have to pay attention to the local news just to see where i might be going next week no 

118.73 124.69 A: right right well that makes sense that if you're work is court reporting that you would like the succinct 

124.71 129.61 A: reporting as opposed to the longer sort of more personalized 

128.44 131.64 B: i'm i'm i'm the guy that wr- that writes everybody's words down 

131.87 135.67 A: right i'm s- i know it but even though it's stylistic but 

135.70 139.94 B: no no no i'm i'm i'm the guy with the little machine that ta- that writes your words down 

139.65 140.60 A: right 

140.31 144.28 B: i take everybody's words down but the reporting of the stuff one of the reasons i 

144.79 150.35 B: have trouble reading a lot of the newspapers is because the information that they give out i find to be false 

150.29 160.38 B: because as a court reporter i have sat down in a court room i have taken a preliminary hearing that lasts three hours i will read a two page i will read a three or four c- column about it 

160.19 170.94 B: three or four ah type written column about it written by someone who wasn't in the court room so like [laughter] i can't tell you what you did today because i wasn't there 

162.85 163.76 A: uh-huh 

165.58 167.25 A: right right 

171.22 179.49 A: well i also on on the n._p._r. stuff i just love the americana sort of you know they they'll do something on 

179.95 183.65 A: carlsbad caverns and the cafeteria i 

182.20 184.18 B: oh i like that kind of stuff 

183.70 189.45 A: mean and that's i mean in the morning you know it it tends to be less of that and more 

189.50 202.87 A: just you know this is what's happening and i also i mean i love that they have they've had the big issues on too because i feel that some some of the some of the morning radio portions are done by b._b._c. news because i feel like it balances out the 

203.07 205.59 A: pro war tendencies of some of the 

205.69 209.46 B: i'll be i'll be exceptionally polite because you're loc- because you're very nice 

209.14 210.30 A: [laughter] 

209.35 217.26 B: coming from an irish american background i don't find anything credible coming over the b._b._c. because i i guess 

217.25 228.17 B: i i i ah i boy we really got [laughter] i i i don't i i i find it humorous to listen to the b._b._c. to hear them talking about the thugs over in ireland 

227.58 242.18 A: right i know i mean i'm irish american also my family's like obsessively you know active in ethnic politics but i i mean i think in in in those situations in in terms of like the british colonial powers and like where they are that's 

229.76 230.77 B: oh okay 

242.27 250.11 A: i mean that i mean that's i don't know i think that's a different story than than looking at the way the american media will frame 

249.09 262.73 B: i i i don't trust the american media th- the thing about the guy in the new york times i forget the guy's name i i i was laughing about it because like as i said doing what i do for a living if the d._a. handling a case has a press conference and says the guy's lying 

253.92 256.00 A: right right 

262.90 269.09 B: and he did it six months ago regarding the sniper case you kn- they choose to not believe the d._a. 

269.42 272.89 B: and so i i didn't find any- i i i got a kick out of 

272.97 277.68 B: the philadelphia enquirer had an editorial about it about the new york times 

277.71 282.41 B: saying that was like an american tragedy and i 

281.50 282.66 A: the sniper oh 

282.43 286.93 B: sorry no no no the ah the newspaper reporter last week that got fired 

286.37 288.23 A: oh right yeah 

286.99 296.98 B: they're calling that an american tragedy and like i'm i'm wondering like no you know you're in new york there was an american tragedy in new york two years ago this is just a newspaper not doing its job 

289.18 290.11 A: [laughter] 

294.90 296.78 A: right right 

296.84 298.43 A: right exactly 

297.20 302.56 B: i i i get ah i i i i find it fascinating the way that 

302.80 308.29 B: when i read the newspapers at least i don't get this sanctimonious 

308.67 319.52 B: crap at the end of the story saying you really put a lot of work into that end i think our listeners really learned a lot from that i just you know the woman i see is a publicist and she will 

315.35 317.05 A: [laughter] 

321.09 332.87 B: i don't want to pick on a network i'll just use a network you know three s- a you know n._b._c. a._b._c. or c._b._s. i don't have cable and they'll tell me that journalist so and so is an important journalist and i will ask why 

332.79 334.35 A: right exactly 

333.65 337.86 B: and they'll s- they'll say well well he or she has has had an impact on your life 

337.42 338.35 A: right 

338.00 346.31 B: oh another oh andrea's the person to tell me there's an automobile accident on the jersey turnpike i can go to bed better knowing that 

345.79 352.87 A: right um in school to- i'm in grad school today in anthropology so i mean that's like that's all 

353.11 354.26 A: we do is 

354.29 357.22 A: critique the media person and 

356.96 369.41 B: like see i i don't i i coming from my background my my family's ethnic background i i joke i'm irish so that makes me that makes me if you are that makes you cynical it it's your birth right 

368.73 371.17 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

370.07 379.99 B: and and i been working in the court system since seventy five or seventy six [laughter] so that also gives me [cough] a fairly skewed way of looking at things 

374.49 375.40 A: uh-huh 

379.39 380.69 A: yeah 

380.02 390.87 B: so reading reading and then reading a newspaper article telling me about what happened in a courtroom that i was in for three hours written by somebody who wasn't there 

390.27 393.06 A: right right right right right 

391.82 402.41 B: or or else information i'll read about you'll read these grand jury articles well from a court reporter's stand point if you take grand jury work you are sworn to secrecy 

402.69 407.91 B: you're not allowed to talk about it so the polite way to put is they're get- if they get 

403.56 405.50 A: right exactly 

408.01 410.81 B: anybody who's in a grand jury takes that oath 

410.88 411.73 A: right 

411.14 416.65 B: so in other words the newspaper reporter's got to be somebody who [laughter] doesn't you know 

416.85 417.77 A: right 

417.21 418.58 B: who who's a liar 

418.67 420.06 A: [laughter] 

418.94 425.64 B: so i i and then when i listen to the news i you know i i listen to the news i'm not obsessed with it but i i ah 

426.81 429.85 B: i would much rather watch a news program than um 

430.89 440.00 B: i i see on the t._v. tonight a._b._c.'s fifty years they're having reunions of all these shows that i never watched [laughter] so what who cares 

437.44 438.84 A: right right 

439.64 445.11 A: [laughter] do you watch do you ever watch like the mcneil baird sort of 

444.48 453.70 B: oh see i watch that i watch that i i'll watch that on sunday mornings depending on where i was the night before and what we're doing or anything i'll watch his news programs 

453.60 465.44 B: i get a kick out of them i i'll watch mcneil the woman i see has actually handled a lot of a lot of people who've been she's seen a lot of these generals the experts but she'd get very annoyed at me but like 

455.91 457.11 A: yeah 

461.55 462.61 A: oh wow 

465.63 469.27 B: they're they're very they're paid ah i don't want to use the term 

469.91 472.62 B: they're dressed up to take it around to the networks 

472.60 474.27 A: right that's neat 

473.20 476.34 B: and paraded around to see who's eager to pick 

476.36 479.87 B: i'll watch that ah 

480.71 482.70 B: i'll watch cable news 

483.16 496.93 B: if i'm if i'm in an area to watch cable news and i i'll i'll i'll listen to public radio but if i want to hear news now i don't know i forget what the a._l._l. network station is up in new york i'll just turn it on for a half hour a day if i'm up there in the weekend i 

483.37 484.39 A: right 

494.90 495.85 A: gosh 

495.96 497.59 A: i don't even know what the name 

497.15 504.72 B: i i know it but wh- what what i love driving around if i'm down in the d._c. area where by sister lives you can hear cspan on the radio 

505.11 507.14 B: now i can listen to that all day 

505.62 506.50 A: wow 

506.81 509.41 A: [laughter] now that that would bore me to death 

508.70 516.58 B: no i i i'm not i'm not talking i'm not talking about congressional debates just the different news programs the press conferences and things of that nature i could i could you know like ah 

513.95 515.48 A: right right 

517.24 526.45 B: it's a terrible thing that happened but the first couple of days of the war i thought that was great you know people were calling and complaining they couldn't watch their soap opera 

526.96 528.77 A: right but it totally 

528.19 530.82 B: yeah this is i i'd much rather watch 

531.83 538.33 B: if i could turn on a station not not cable news because cable news degenerates into madonna's underwear and you know ah 

539.25 546.88 B: pierre atores and her t._v. movie you know that sort of crap i'd much rather watch news to to because it's hard to get information really 

541.59 542.98 A: right yeah 

546.84 549.18 A: i i thought it was interesting the way 

549.21 555.07 A: that after the war and that a._b._c. news was trying to take the sort of um 

555.31 562.58 A: unbiased position against the war where were not in poor against the war but yet the other networks were 

562.83 566.48 A: i mean definitely in the current war 

568.49 579.08 A: i don't know manner but the a._b._c. was i think not for not for political reasons but i think just in terms of trying to win back a like a monetary base right exactly 

576.38 577.81 B: to get ratings 

578.55 583.87 B: well the thing the thing that i get that i i used to friends of mine get a kick because like 

583.92 586.64 B: dan rather thought he was a general 

586.74 594.90 B: when peter jennings starts discussing our country and what we're doing and this sort of thing i wonder what he's talking about because he's canadian 

589.13 590.42 A: [laughter] 

592.13 593.58 A: right exactly 

594.97 596.86 A: [laughter] no he's not 

596.23 597.60 B: yes he is 

597.27 599.61 A: oh that's hysterical
