59.43 60.27 A: we went to europe 

61.16 62.61 A: a year ago and so 

61.95 62.37 B: okay 

62.75 69.67 A: it's been really cool for us cause this year they've been to some of the places and we're like we were there we know exactly where they're going what they're going to do so 

69.28 70.50 B: yeah that would be neat 

70.64 71.64 A: yeah um 

72.13 75.99 B: i i guess we saw probably the first two seasons of survivor 

76.32 76.78 A: okay 

76.92 79.29 B: but after that we really hadn't seen any 

80.01 81.25 A: yeah i think it's 

81.42 83.09 A: kind of gone down hill 

83.28 87.48 B: yeah well from what i've read and stuff it seems like it has you're right 

87.75 88.85 A: yeah i think they 

90.82 92.10 A: the first season at least 

92.47 95.22 A: the focus is really on the competition aspect 

95.90 97.55 A: you know how they survived 

97.79 98.21 B: right 

98.27 101.32 A: whereas now they've kind of gotten the focus on the people and 

101.92 103.16 A: who can manipulate the best 

104.02 106.69 B: yeah it it's almost more like a soap opera it seems like 

110.50 111.02 A: that's too bad 

114.92 115.42 B: mhm 

124.37 125.36 B: oh yeah you're right

141.87 142.36 A: yeah 

143.89 147.09 A: i know in the question they mentioned who wants to marry a millionaire 

147.02 147.48 B: uh-huh 

147.46 149.20 A: that one still just blows my mind 

150.65 152.80 A: all these people would be willing to marry someone 

153.49 153.84 A: they 

154.32 155.99 A: didn't meet until like that night 

157.44 159.17 B: yeah and and isn't there one coming on like

162.50 162.93 A: is that 

163.37 167.81 A: i'd heard that they had something that was like that but he has a secret or something and i didn't know 

167.43 171.80 B: yeah he's they they tell him he's a millionaire but he's really a construction worker 

173.40 173.85 A: wow 

174.87 178.07 B: so they're i mean obviously it's recorded by now and everything but 

177.83 178.22 A: yeah

188.38 188.77 A: yeah 

190.61 193.57 A: i can't imagine why a woman would want to put herself in that position 

193.71 194.10 A: you know 

194.44 195.04 B: oh yeah 

194.78 199.19 A: -pete with twenty five other women to have my heart broken on national television yeah

200.86 202.57 A: (( )) not me but 

204.91 206.42 A: that'll be interesting to see then 

206.79 207.40 A: with uh 

207.65 210.26 A: the new who married a millionaire if he's not a millionaire 

210.30 210.79 B: yeah 

210.93 211.28 A: what 

211.03 211.30 B: it 

211.96 212.88 A: how those women react 

213.28 215.55 B: eh oh i'll bet they'll be mad 

215.73 216.30 A: i would be 

216.72 217.36 B: yeah 

217.93 220.33 A: i wouldn't of gone on the show in the first place either 

220.19 220.95 B: that's true 

220.88 221.72 A: i don't know 

226.06 228.78 B: i'm trying to think of what (( )) other shows there are like that 

232.08 232.62 A: uh 

232.85 235.27 A: well m._t._v.'s had the real world on for 

235.23 236.01 B: oh yeah 

236.21 236.84 A: so long 

237.54 241.93 B: oh we live out in the boonies where so we don't get m._t._v. on cable it's the weirdest thing 

240.43 241.25 A: oh okay 

244.46 245.88 A: we didn't for a long time but 

250.25 250.65 B: yeah 

254.64 255.46 A: reality t._v. 

255.74 257.09 B: yeah i suppose 

256.35 258.21 A: i don't know 

258.36 260.87 A: i'm not sure who's reality that is exactly but 

260.42 265.18 B: yeah i don't think it's the the life that most of us live on a daily basis 

265.90 266.87 A: but i guess that 

267.07 267.67 A: there life 

270.03 271.91 B: which they can keep it thank you 

272.30 273.74 A: yeah i would pass on that one 

275.07 276.30 A: i have to admit i don't really watch 

276.72 277.24 A: show but 

277.43 277.97 B: yeah 

277.92 279.13 A: just heard enough about it 

279.25 279.84 A: to uh 

280.92 281.41 A: to wonder 

281.94 282.71 B: exactly 

289.16 290.54 A: what else is out there now any 

294.02 295.28 B: yeah i don't know if they 

295.68 299.30 B: like think fear factor and stuff like that's a reality show or 

299.52 301.45 A: yeah i guess in a way it is 

304.61 307.81 B: that's just cra- some crazy some of the stuff on 

308.97 311.26 A: yeah it's always interesting cause you sit there and you go 

311.40 312.66 A: what i really do that 

316.33 317.73 A: and some of the time you're like 

317.82 320.20 A: it couldn't be that bad and then if you watch them do it you're like 

321.66 323.66 A: it must be worse than i think it's going to be 

323.62 325.92 B: well some of the stuff they make them eat i mean (( )) 

326.65 327.14 A: yeah 

327.55 329.31 A: some of it you can barely watch them eat it 

329.63 330.19 B: oh yeah 

334.94 335.78 A: and some of the 

337.07 339.47 A: stunts they do i'm ama- i'm amazed most people don't get 

339.88 341.25 A: seriously injured on that show 

341.34 342.11 B: exactly 

344.97 347.39 A: i've heard that they test it all on their interns 

349.44 351.52 A: that would make you think twice before 

350.96 351.90 B: yeah no kidding 

353.03 355.60 B: watch before you go take some job somewhere 

355.17 356.03 A: yeah 

356.04 357.17 B: what are you making me do 

360.30 361.04 A: but that ones always 

361.23 363.23 A: that ones always interesting to see how people 

363.84 364.22 A: react 

364.34 365.31 A: to each other and 

366.21 366.79 B: mhm 

367.42 370.10 A: if you can pick out at the beginning who's going to be the one who 

370.39 372.53 B: well there's a lot of mind games going on in that one 

372.82 373.29 A: yeah 

374.10 375.38 B: kind of like in survivor 

376.00 378.79 B: course they can dramatize it in survivor 

378.45 381.10 A: yeah and and that goes on so much more (( )) 

380.97 381.77 B: exactly 

381.84 385.58 A: they get to know each other better whereas really the people on fear factor are 

385.79 386.17 A: pretty much 

387.17 387.65 B: yeah 

388.27 391.79 B: know on the amazing race do they get together like on survivor 

392.79 393.35 A: um 

393.23 396.29 B: or they just kind of do there own thing and they never really meet up 

397.92 400.08 A: um at the end of each like leg of the race 

400.11 400.54 B: uh-huh 

400.25 400.62 A: they have 

400.83 402.33 A: twelve hours where they have to rest 

402.84 403.47 B: oh okay 

403.46 405.45 A: and so they're all at the same spot 

405.56 408.51 A: and it isn't always for twelve hours it depends on how spread out they get 

408.49 408.86 B: sure 

409.20 409.68 A: but um 

409.91 411.02 A: a lot of times it's like 

412.24 414.46 A: six or seven hours where they're all together at least 

414.18 414.89 B: oh okay 

415.23 418.12 A: and so i mean they do kind of get to know each other and things 

418.76 421.28 A: and some and that one's interesting cause sometimes they 

421.51 423.19 A: you know teams will be like well we'll help you if 

423.55 424.89 A: you'll help us later you know 

424.94 425.45 B: right 

425.38 427.02 A: and so they kind of work together 

427.15 427.82 B: oh 

427.75 428.16 A: you know 

428.43 429.14 A: form 

430.01 430.86 A: you know 

430.98 433.66 A: little groups that you know these two teams are working together 

434.18 436.75 A: the other two teams will try and get them out and things like that 

436.95 440.03 B: so it kind a has some similarities to that mole show they did 

440.50 441.41 A: oh yeah 

442.37 442.63 B: cause 

442.45 443.14 A: yeah 

442.89 444.64 B: cause people kind of work together on that 

444.92 445.26 A: yeah 

445.35 446.54 B: somewhat but 

446.26 446.68 A: yeah 

446.87 447.86 A: well they had to 

448.24 448.69 B: yeah 

451.27 452.94 A: that was an interesting show too cause 

453.89 454.41 A: talk about 

455.11 457.04 A: not knowing who you could trust 

456.66 457.45 B: oh yeah 

457.73 458.32 A: i mean 

460.88 465.63 A: always said i would i would rather be the mole if i was on that show than anything else 

463.97 464.55 B: mhm 

465.43 469.08 B: exactly we we watched the first season of that but the second one 

469.87 470.43 B: we didn't 

470.75 472.89 A: yeah i guess that's kind of what we did too then 

473.11 475.01 B: and now it's weird cause that guys on c._n._n. 

475.19 475.86 A: yeah 

475.66 478.34 B: and it's like it's the guy from the mole 

478.08 478.59 A: yeah 

479.30 482.57 A: well and the girl who was on big brother i think is now on like 

486.15 488.64 B: oh yeah yeah that julie chen or whatever 

486.56 486.99 A: on like 

487.96 488.48 A: yeah 

488.83 492.27 B: yeah we saw the first one of that but after that we kind of lost interest in it 

492.47 493.20 A: well that one just 

493.76 496.00 A: too long and they don't really do anything 

496.48 497.00 B: yeah 

498.01 501.82 B: well it seemed like the second one the people weren't as interesting as the first one 

502.10 502.41 A: yeah 

502.76 505.59 B: you know it was more i don't know they seemed all more like 

505.96 509.68 B: like you said they're trying to break into hollywood where the first people seemed more like 

509.84 511.12 B: regular average people 

511.27 511.85 A: yeah 

512.16 513.16 A: and it seems like that's 

513.31 516.76 A: kind of how it's gone on all those reality t._v. shows though like survivor 

515.39 516.08 B: mhm 

517.53 518.64 A: it's like they just keep getting 

519.18 520.09 A: younger and 

520.49 522.79 A: you know the swimsuits get smaller and 

523.64 524.46 A: everything else 

524.73 525.14 A: and 

524.78 526.13 B: yeah i read an article about 

526.25 528.14 B: you know how the people were getting like 

528.36 533.64 B: more slim and trim and stuff and they were like i don't know how they're going to live on the next one cause you know there's no food 

533.91 534.35 A: yeah 

534.70 537.61 B: and they were like maybe on the next one they'll just be all big people 

538.47 544.67 A: well you would think in some ways you'd have an advantage if you were you know if you were a little heavier and you had that extra weight to lose 

543.22 543.62 B: yeah 

545.68 548.62 A: whereas some of those people by the time they come off survivor they just 

549.88 551.52 A: they barely look healthy anymore 

551.66 552.38 B: oh yeah 

553.15 557.27 B: course you know some of the people that are on t._v. on regular shows look that way now too so 

563.36 564.10 A: i don't think i could
