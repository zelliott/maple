0.00 1.21 B: hello 

0.73 1.93 A: hello 

1.61 3.22 B: hi my name's heather 

3.02 4.50 A: hi my name's sheila 

4.27 5.55 B: hi sheila 

5.96 7.90 B: so sheila do you watch um 

7.96 10.12 B: reality t._v. shows 

10.57 12.50 A: i've watched the osbournes 

12.39 14.07 B: (( oh yeah )) 

13.41 14.87 A: i really like that one 

14.62 19.08 B: i like the osbournes too i don't know if that counts i guess that kind of counts i don't know how 

18.26 21.65 A: i watched the first survivor but not any of the rest of them 

21.82 24.30 B: i don't watch them any of them 

24.50 29.27 B: i i just don't understand i don't understand why people like them at all 

28.93 31.52 A: have you watched any part of any of them 

31.31 35.33 B: [mn] i've seen like maybe an episode or two of the first survivor 

35.72 37.35 B: i could see doing it 

37.34 38.52 A: oh really 

38.00 50.95 B: i guess like [mn] well not not who wants to marry a millionaire or anything but survivor i i mean i think it's interesting and i think it'd be kind of exciting [lipsmack] and i would want to be on it for a chance to win a lot of money and to do it but i 

45.99 46.56 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

51.47 55.13 B: but i don't i don't understand the appeal of 

56.62 58.61 B: (( watching other people do it )) 

59.44 60.39 B: (( i don't know )) 

60.22 68.37 A: would you feel odd about having everything taped i mean having everything that you do taped and people seeing you at your worst or 

68.22 71.04 B: oh yeah yeah i suppose so but 

70.66 74.92 A: i think that's why people watch i think people enjoy seeing other people at their worst 

75.03 78.48 B: i wonder how much of it really is um [lipsmack] 

79.41 82.84 B: how much of it's scripted if at all 

81.95 82.70 A: (( ri- i )) 

83.29 90.31 B: or if they encourage people to act certain ways i don't really know that much about it but yeah it's such melodrama i think 

90.79 98.11 A: think it is scripted to a degree and the editing because um after the first survivor there was a lot of articles about 

98.29 104.62 A: ah how the producers kind of went around and encouraged people to do the things they were doing or not to do the things they were doing 

103.28 104.33 B: really 

105.18 107.60 A: so in some ways it is manufactured 

108.26 109.40 A: for t._v. 

110.01 118.36 A: but like the osbournes i think you know watching people in their own homes or like the big brother show which i never really liked 

110.78 111.39 B: (( [mn] )) 

114.77 115.72 B: uh-huh 

117.78 119.86 B: (( no i never re- really saw that )) 

119.95 120.92 A: (( well )) 

120.01 123.53 B: that's a bunch of people in a house that's like the m._t._v. show right 

122.05 125.78 A: right yeah like i watched the m._t._v. real word series 

125.03 126.41 B: oh yeah 

126.17 128.21 A: and so that's the same idea 

128.39 130.08 A: and that was pretty compelling 

131.20 134.02 A: because you get to see people fight with each other 

133.13 134.22 B: uh-huh 

134.25 137.66 A: and uh the kind of gossiping that goes on 

138.22 147.77 B: [lipsmack] i don't know i think maybe i like the osbournes better because i don't see them as real people i mean ozzy osbourne [laughter] he's he's not a real pe- you know what i mean 

147.71 150.83 A: yes yeah it's very strange but yes 

148.05 149.29 B: he's kind of 

150.04 151.98 B: this figure that um 

152.78 157.57 B: you don't see him as a normal person i mean just you don't see him like an every day person 

157.60 159.88 B: so maybe that's why i separate that 

160.96 162.11 B: yeah he's 

162.19 166.03 A: yeah it's almost a caricature of of one's self 

163.81 164.86 B: mhm 

166.93 174.97 A: which i think maybe is why it's compelling is you know who is who are people really who who is the individual and you know in our every day lives we kind of 

175.77 185.11 A: do the same thing you know you put on the public face to go to work or to go to school and then there's the private you and you know being able to look in somebody else's private life is 

178.88 179.78 B: mhm 

185.37 187.17 A: probably kind of interesting 

187.91 193.37 B: [lipsmack] i guess maybe that's what it is that i don't buy into so maybe that's why it's not interesting to me 

193.81 196.43 B: i don't think it's real i don't think it's genuine 

196.72 197.68 B: so 

197.50 200.98 A: well that's the question is anybody real is anyone genuine 

202.93 209.71 B: oh my [laughter] that's a topic of conversation that i've had a couple of times this semester 

209.39 210.82 A: really 

210.03 212.24 B: uh-huh but um 

213.16 216.99 B: [mn] well some [mn] we were tal- i took this class on creative 

217.46 220.60 B: and i don't know how we got on to like the subject of people 

220.70 231.57 B: who um different personalities and how many per- like how i think the question we were talking about how many me's are there you know i'm one person when i go to work i'm another person when i hang out with my friends 

231.36 232.31 A: right 

232.01 233.42 B: or um 

233.90 237.05 B: [lipsmack] see i don't see it that way though it think there's just one 

237.85 242.58 B: genuine you person and it's like how much you let other people see it though is what 

243.35 244.35 B: varies 

244.88 245.95 B: maybe so 

245.96 247.04 B: i think [mn] 

249.02 250.36 B: (( i i don't know )) 

251.05 253.79 B: i guess what makes people genuine is when they're 

254.96 256.03 B: not 

256.32 259.79 B: trying to do anything not trying to be funny not 

260.24 263.72 B: trying to get a reaction they're just that's just they're just 

264.10 264.92 B: (( you know )) 

265.07 275.94 A: right which is why i think maybe we kind of hope that these reality shows will show us the real people you know when you are out there in ah where were they the first one of the island and 

274.76 276.41 B: mhm uh-huh 

276.13 281.32 A: they're starving and they're dirty and [laughter] you expect the real person to emerge 

281.60 283.22 A: or in your own home 

282.76 284.28 B: (( that would yeah )) 

284.81 288.68 A: and i think that's why we watch and i think your point is a good one that 

288.78 292.81 A: you know it's very scripted and it wouldn't get on t._v. unless it were entertaining 

292.82 303.60 B: do you think um people identify with it or do you think that they don't identify with it and that that's why it's appealing too it's something that they wouldn't do or do you think they see themselves in it 

304.62 306.32 A: i think a lot of people 

306.48 319.50 A: especially in this generation i'm not sure why it seems to be getting more and more but people want to be on t._v. themselves and so they do kind of maybe imagine oh what if they were sh- you know taping my life 

313.33 314.27 B: mhm 

319.82 320.62 B: (( [sigh] )) 

320.20 326.12 A: um but in some ways i do think it's also like watching a car wreck you know people are intrigued by other people 

326.62 329.85 A: often most when things are going horribly wrong 

329.21 330.30 B: yeah 

329.90 337.86 A: and when people are you know cursing and doing bad stuff and getting caught on camera you know all those t._v. shows were 

338.04 341.28 A: people are caught on camera doing really bad stuff 

341.86 343.82 A: those are usually on fox or 

343.54 344.90 B: yeah [laughter] 

344.07 345.42 A: some cable show 

345.81 351.05 B: i think i saw something on fox not too long ago like something that you said made me think of 

351.23 355.25 B: oh that other t._v. show and i didn't watch it either the one the 

356.05 362.87 B: people singing it's a contest for american or pop star pop do you know what i'm talking about 

362.11 363.77 A: the american idol 

363.29 369.53 B: yeah american idol so i saw something it must have been on fox where there was an audition 

370.16 375.04 B: and there was hundreds and hundreds of people in detroit and in california 

371.37 372.25 A: right 

375.38 386.27 B: just standing around waiting to get in and just showing up didn't guarantee they even got an audition but i was amazed amazed there was hundreds of sixteen to like twenty year olds 

386.41 390.41 A: right yeah [cough] it is amazing it's almost as though 

390.92 402.01 A: you know people really just hope and pray that one day they'll be famous [laughter] and ah you know i just think that's very unrealistic and i don't know really why people would want to be famous 

401.61 405.95 B: no that's what i was thinking i don't think i'd think i'd want i wouldn't want that at all 

406.62 411.00 A: because then you know the the tabloids would be writing bad staff about 

410.61 411.60 B: uh-huh 

411.21 412.64 A: about you and 

413.68 416.73 A: you know and none of it would be probably pleasant 

416.94 421.79 A: because they you know amer- american culture somewhat likes to build people up and then knock them down 

422.17 424.85 A: which is kind of like all these reality shows 

424.22 425.28 B: mhm 

425.29 433.89 A: you know the bachelor which i didn't i couldn't stomach it at all but you know the whole idea is at the end the first one at the end you know he didn't really marry the person 

428.25 429.10 B: (( [laughter] )) 

434.05 436.91 A: and oh he's a horrible person for that and 

436.86 437.90 B: (( um )) 

437.59 439.17 A: very bizarre 

438.61 446.97 B: well yeah i was actually surprised because i remember after after the first show who wants to marry a millionaire i think that was the first one like that 

446.50 447.77 A: (( right yeah )) 

446.98 451.14 B: and it didn't seem to do very well and people [lipsmack] 

451.48 453.75 B: a lot of people seemed to be upset about it 

453.86 455.83 B: so i was surprised that 

456.21 458.15 B: they picked it up again 

458.07 459.05 A: right 

458.45 459.62 B: and they're 

459.63 461.29 B: they keep going with it 

460.87 468.52 A: and that the guy and the woman also who were on the original show they've been on all the talk shows they've they've stayed in the media 

468.22 470.11 B: yeah i did see 

470.21 480.63 B: i know the i forget her name right now the first woman i know she's been in playboy i saw her on some talk show and she's back in nursing and in playboy and [sigh] um 

476.09 476.87 A: right 

481.02 482.92 B: i don't know if it makes her happy 

483.80 486.29 A: did you ever see that movie notting hill 

487.06 488.97 A: with julia roberts and 

487.33 488.35 B: um 

488.40 492.74 B: i did see it and i oh okay you're right i did it see it yeah she's an actress 

489.06 490.20 A: hugh grant 

492.73 496.93 A: yeah there's a great scene in the movie where she starts she's talking about 

497.36 499.68 A: being famous and having 

499.95 503.10 A: every time her heart is broken it's on the tabloids 

502.43 503.45 B: (( uh-huh )) 

503.13 509.02 A: and it's entertainment and that's just sort of the kind of voyeurism i think these shows 

509.51 516.44 A: you know promote people aren't really real like yeah their real people and it's reality but it's not real like you were saying it's 

510.43 511.40 B: (( uh-huh )) 

516.83 519.46 A: people sort of approach it in this very 

519.66 523.90 A: cold and callous and entertainment sort of way 

524.34 528.62 A: whereas you know who would want their daughter to be on the bachelor 

529.23 531.39 A: you know would you want your daughter 

531.27 531.93 B: (( no )) 

531.91 534.37 A: to go on a show like that 

533.82 536.80 B: i suppose part of it is too is then 

537.54 538.33 B: (( [mn] )) 

539.70 545.75 B: if you are on that show you don't you're not expected to be yourself and so you don't have to be and that way it's 

546.06 556.75 B: you can keep yourself emot- if you were famous i'm sure you would probably be very emotionally detached to the way you were presented or some situations you were in 

557.09 559.55 B: so you can because you're acting 

560.84 564.01 B: and um so maybe it's easy for people though 

564.82 570.40 A: i think so i think that but again i think people act in their every day lives as well you know when you- 

569.68 570.64 B: mhm 

570.61 576.75 A: you're in school or you're with one group of friends you kind of you can modify how you come across 

577.37 581.06 A: and and then you emotionally distance yourself if you want to 

581.09 583.46 A: from well they didn't like me 

583.52 586.93 A: when i was that way and that wasn't really me so it doesn't really count 

586.34 587.47 B: mhm 

588.95 593.11 A: yeah it's just little games people play with themselves you know [laughter] but in the end ah 

593.70 594.69 A: um 

595.55 600.04 A: you know it's up to each individual how much you do act in every day life 

602.27 610.16 A: yeah but i guess we're we still we watch these shows because we think in some ways that that's ooh we're going to see something very authentic 

603.27 603.83 B: (( [mn] )) 

610.44 612.24 A: in these people's lives 

611.46 612.54 B: mhm 

613.34 618.41 B: i'm trying to think about the t._v. shows that i watch and why i watch them and i really don't watch too many because i 

618.67 619.73 B: (( watch up )) 

619.76 621.58 B: do you know twenty four on fox 

621.75 624.94 A: i've heard of it and about it but i haven't watched it do 

624.31 628.21 B: i've see- i watch that and the simpsons and that's about it [laughter] 

627.81 629.17 A: you watch friends 

629.17 633.39 B: no well i've seen it i've seen it a bunch of times but i don't watch it 

633.85 635.08 B: frequently 

635.78 647.52 A: i think people like that show because it's this this fantasy that most people have of having this in tact group of friends that everyone's there for each other and nobody's really out to do anyone harm [laughter] 

647.61 650.04 A: and it really doesn't exist in real life 

650.47 655.24 B: no it's a kind of nice fantasy too to be young and 

655.54 658.54 B: in new york and working in 

658.35 659.60 A: right 

659.01 662.46 B: coffee shops and having nice apartments too 

662.47 670.59 A: right exactly and nobody moves away nobody gets a job in another place and nobody steals anybody's boyfriend 

665.59 666.40 B: (( and )) 

669.78 670.92 B: [laughter] 

671.95 674.98 A: and everyone stays friends and you know that just doesn't happen 

675.69 679.30 A: and like the bachelor you know there's this cinderella fantasy of oh 

679.66 687.40 A: you'll grow up and marry a prince and you know he'll sweep you off your feet and everything will be happily every after but you know 

688.67 689.85 A: it's a fantasy 

691.38 698.27 B: i was just thinking about the another one that had i think maybe four women going to alaska to choose a guy 

698.20 700.50 A: oh i saw just a snippet of that one 

699.75 707.50 B: i don't even know if it stayed on but there were maybe twenty guys and four women and it's kind of interesting too that the ones that are highly promoted are the 

707.98 710.81 B: the fairytale prince choosing 

710.70 711.70 A: right 

711.12 712.77 B: the same story but um 

712.95 715.37 B: um it's interesting that it doesn't 

715.72 717.67 B: switch genders 

717.75 718.84 A: that's right 

718.28 719.96 B: so easily 

719.45 719.90 A: (( yeah 'cause ))
