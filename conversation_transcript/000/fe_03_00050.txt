50.43 51.22 A: precisely 

51.99 53.01 A: plus let us face it 

53.10 56.72 A: there aren't any commercials on t._v. telling us say something bad about someone else 

57.70 63.61 A: no to do that you've got to watch things like america's stupidest home videos or cops 

64.28 67.79 A: (( )) an exotic form of gossip you know 

66.31 66.82 B: yeah 

67.99 71.09 B: although (( implicitly )) a lot of television shows gossip 

71.23 72.18 B: and use gossip 

72.48 75.00 A: that's why the reality shows are so popular 

74.88 75.40 B: yeah 

75.41 76.39 A: let's watch people's 

76.50 77.19 A: fail 

77.28 78.33 B: yeah 

77.86 82.19 A: not just a question where you get a buzzer on a game show but uh 

82.34 85.57 A: i wonder how many people are really glad the schmuck fell into the campfire 

86.59 92.22 B: yeah yeah i don't really understand (( )) reality shows there is some that are interesting but they are probably the more 

93.15 94.40 B: game showy ones 

94.41 94.74 A: hey 

95.49 102.30 A: i'd love to have something where you know we just stick a little old lady with a flat tire by the side of the road and a camera watching 

103.45 106.56 B: hm sort of like a modern reenactment of um 

107.45 108.83 B: of a biblical story 

108.89 115.98 A: good samaritan approach yeah i mean frankly i i think there is enough people out there who would make enough of an idiot of themselves 

110.19 110.57 B: yeah 

116.38 116.71 A: that it would 

116.82 118.62 A: satisfy that crowd of entertainment 

121.62 121.93 A: (( )) 

122.29 122.73 B: yeah 

123.27 128.45 A: then again you would get ninety nine percent of the population going see see that was our car that just went by 

130.55 131.79 B: yeah 

132.12 137.28 B: yeah um but sort of back to the topic we're talking about personal habits right 

137.09 137.53 A: mhm 

137.58 139.03 B: but that was sort of the main one 

139.26 139.91 B: and um 

140.16 142.87 B: and i don't know i guess they're both the one that i think 

143.33 144.78 B: is more general uh 

144.92 147.35 B: like you said at the beginning is eee that everyone can 

147.68 154.22 B: do something about because not everyone smokes not everyone drinks not everyone does everything is really refrain from gossiping because for s- 

154.34 158.13 B: i do think that almost everyone has at one point or another gossiped 

158.42 158.99 A: there is a great 

159.14 160.11 A: temptation 

160.46 161.12 B: yes 

161.02 163.46 A: to be- let's face it it's a verbal barb 

163.61 163.88 B: yeah 

163.65 165.91 A: there's no weapon there's no evidence 

166.70 169.24 A: and you can always say you heard it from a friend of a friend 

170.08 170.34 B: yeah 

170.84 171.12 B: (( no )) 

172.38 174.53 B: yeah that's true and it's and it's usually 

174.95 180.64 B: um and it's often done just by accident i mean people not realizing that they don't know sources of information 

182.26 185.81 A: i run across this on too many occasions especially on the internet 

186.55 186.89 B: hm 

187.16 190.81 A: the internet if you put a large banner that says red is green 

191.99 193.18 B: o._k. 

192.63 195.87 A: you will find people who will accept it as knowledge 

196.88 199.35 A: what it was on the internet man 

199.44 202.67 B: yeah that actually i'm uh um i've 

202.85 203.28 B: i'm a 

203.53 205.41 B: p._a. right now i'm a graduate student in 

205.85 207.80 B: and i think that's probably the largest 

207.90 211.48 B: problem with academic papers these days are students that just 

211.76 214.69 B: write down something from the internet and claim it as fact 

215.63 216.73 B: because they're trained 

217.21 217.60 B: well they're 

217.82 219.12 B: at least theoretically 

219.41 220.18 B: we train them 

220.45 221.87 B: to um look at 

222.35 223.78 B: at writ- the written word 

223.87 225.13 B: critically in libraries 

225.58 229.46 B: we train them with in t- terms of how to find the correct s- sources (( )) 

229.01 232.34 A: the difference between library skills and a search engine 

232.38 232.95 B: yeah 

232.94 233.95 A: is dramatic 

233.84 240.27 B: yeah and they're not i mean it's slowly being ad- addressed and it's slowly becoming an issue and we're slowly trying to train 

240.71 242.94 B: students in the resource of the internet but 

242.77 248.55 A: on the one side we have the dewy decimal system on the other side we have the do nothing digital system 

247.32 247.73 B: yeah 

248.79 250.95 B: yeah 

251.10 251.53 B: yeah 

252.07 253.09 B: (( )) so easy 

253.41 254.04 B: so easy 

255.65 263.41 A: well there's you know there's the final thing you know inform- you know (( )) can we can we actually have an ethical discussion you know on information apathy 

265.33 266.11 A: there is 

266.34 267.87 A: gossi- that's what gossip is 

267.89 268.25 B: right 

268.44 268.82 B: yeah 

268.62 271.92 A: you know i don't care what we say as long as it's something uh juicy

273.29 273.56 B: huh 

274.40 274.76 B: yeah 

275.69 279.77 A: you know frankly i consider that to be a lot more dangerous than a box of (( cannoli )) 

280.57 285.19 B: ha ha i don't know it depends i can do some damage on (( cannoli )) 

284.64 285.33 A: ah where are you

315.88 316.38 B: that you know of 

316.64 319.83 A: uh it's about the same size as it's about three and a half million people 

320.40 324.42 A: which in a count- in a country that has like thirty million people in it makes it to be (( quote )) 

324.54 325.45 A: big city 

325.62 325.97 B: right 

326.66 327.71 A: it's the media 

327.95 331.77 A: and the financial capital of canada so pretty much it 

332.29 333.50 A: it's where the job get- 

333.61 334.09 A: down

355.47 359.31 A: the moment you get political you run into 

359.54 366.41 A: a band of thieves who are out there still waiting for king louis the fifteenth to come back and save them 

366.56 367.21 B: uh 

368.63 372.35 A: trying to pull off the biggest land grab in north american history 

373.02 383.53 A: by having themselves declared a separate country but uh we'll use your money and our passports and uh you can basically forget our balance of payments 

383.38 383.82 B: right 

384.06 384.44 B: right 

384.42 385.11 A: it's

498.21 500.28 A: been doing that since i was seventeen 

500.41 500.85 B: oh 

501.35 502.22 B: oh that's really neat 

502.74 503.91 B: what types of comic books 

504.44 508.86 A: oh such pinnacles of western literature (( creepy )) (( )) (( vamperella )) 

509.01 510.57 B: oh 

510.25 518.18 A: i used to do twisted little science fiction stories little you know who is (( edgar rice burroughs )) and why is he saying these terrible things about me 

519.06 520.71 B: and what do you do now 

521.53 522.85 A: well i'm working on a novel

530.78 531.41 B: only 

531.59 534.59 B: i pretty much only like steinbeck's version of the story 

535.53 538.04 B: and maybe oh and i've read the (( myths )) of (( avalon )) i think 

538.70 539.02 A: yeah

549.04 549.47 B: yeah 

549.66 550.45 B: yeah makes sense 

550.20 558.75 A: so unfortunately i came to the conclusion that uh in this day and age what is really needed is the sleazy scandalous tell all about camelot
