59.01 62.87 B: yeah okay well uh i guess that means that you and i um 

59.73 60.94 A: i remember now 

62.99 66.58 B: seem to have more time available to do this than other people uh that are 

66.32 69.77 A: well we signed up for the same they seem to call at the same time everyday 

69.84 70.64 B: yeah 

70.76 71.70 A: which is pretty good 

71.86 72.36 B: mhm 

72.84 77.80 A: um so but do you get headaches when you don't drink uh caffeine 

77.88 79.17 B: no i don't 

79.06 79.87 A: oh okay 

80.17 80.99 B: no it's uh th- 

81.11 84.99 B: totally i don- i don't have the right receptors or something in my brain so 

85.92 87.73 B: so it's just like uh drinking water 

87.88 88.43 B: basically 

88.19 89.72 A: tha- well that's good 

89.61 90.04 B: yeah 

89.84 91.47 A: if you like the coffee 

91.12 93.03 B: yeah actually i do 

93.19 100.23 B: um when i lived in bolivia we uh the water wasn't really drinkable right out of the tap so you always had to boil it 

100.71 101.07 A: uh-huh 

100.80 104.60 B: and when you boil it then it doesn't really taste very good to drink cold so 

104.76 105.48 B: we always drank 

105.86 106.68 B: tea or coffee 

107.08 107.47 A: right 

107.59 108.67 B: or lemonade and 

108.99 111.56 B: and i just kind of got out of the habit of drinking water 

112.57 114.56 B: at a young impressionable age and it's been 

115.35 117.04 B: hard to get back into the habit so 

117.50 118.91 B: so if i need to drink something i drink 

117.54 117.87 A: uh-huh 

119.07 119.66 B: coffee 

121.05 124.02 B: but i guess we need to talk about uh gossip and uh 

123.89 125.76 A: oh yeah that one i was going to say is my 

125.93 127.49 A: is the worst 

127.38 127.85 B: oh 

128.11 128.95 B: tell me about it 

129.47 130.76 A: yeah i don't a- you know 

131.52 133.99 A: well the people like to gossip for some reason 

134.12 134.73 B: uh-huh 

134.74 136.57 A: i'm not much of a gossiper myself 

137.03 137.87 A: although i can 

138.17 141.15 A: see where the desire you know sort of comes from but 

142.37 142.91 A: um 

144.06 145.74 A: i you know i don't really 

146.28 152.24 A: uh it doesn't really bother me directly if people are sort of gossiping about me because you know i don't really 

153.30 154.26 A: i mean i'm sort of 

154.44 156.00 A: comfortable with who i am but 

156.21 157.65 A: i don't really like being around 

158.56 161.66 A: you know just hearin- it if it's about someone else or whatever 

160.29 160.88 B: yeah 

162.68 163.54 B: yeah i um 

163.78 168.88 B: people don't actually gossip around me because um i think it's -cause i don't gossip so 

169.25 171.39 B: they don't feel like they've got anything 

171.60 171.86 B: to 

171.95 174.70 B: get in return if they tell me a juicy story 

173.46 173.99 A: mhm 

174.81 179.35 B: so i found out in uh over the years that i tend to be 

175.19 175.61 A: yeah 

179.69 182.63 B: way out on the edge of the limb of of um 

183.27 185.76 B: call it the grapevine i i never hear anything because 

186.79 187.33 B: people 

187.58 195.13 B: y- know they don't tell me any gossip so so whenever something's going on you know i'm always the last to know yeah 

192.14 193.64 A: you're the last to know 

195.72 196.93 A: yeah 

197.38 201.32 A: well uh you know working in a restaurant there's often a lot of gossip 

201.49 201.90 B: mhm 

202.47 204.28 A: a lot of employees um 

205.93 206.21 A: you know 

206.51 210.08 A: i think it's just maybe the lifestyle or or or who knows what but 

210.36 210.98 B: yeah 

211.18 213.65 A: i try my hardest to stay away 

212.77 213.43 B: mhm 

213.84 214.16 A: d- 

215.22 217.16 B: yeah it it's really hard when uh 

218.17 222.40 B: you know the gossip can de- destroy people -n you tell lies about people and 

223.00 225.43 B: and then they have really no way of defending themselves because 

225.91 228.55 B: for one thing they don't know what's being said about them and then 

228.47 228.86 A: right 

229.05 230.78 B: and then the sorts of things that are being said 

231.12 233.63 B: th- don't really stand up to proof one way or the other 

234.40 239.51 A: does gossip include like you know for example let's say someone does something 

239.94 245.07 A: that you know you're you don't really agree with or something so then you tell someone else you know 

245.53 247.34 A: i can't believe so and so is like 

247.76 248.68 A: you know doing this 

250.05 251.35 A: is that is that gossip 

251.88 252.67 B: well 

254.23 261.99 B: i i don't if if gossip is just anytime you talk about someone else or if it's only when you tell destructive things about someone else 

261.60 261.99 A: right 

263.06 264.26 A: i wonder that myself 

264.17 266.72 B: yeah i guess we need to settle on a 

266.95 270.90 B: you know we need to settle on a definition of terms 

270.78 271.13 A: yeah 

271.09 274.41 B: um let's see what other things did they want us to talk about 

274.55 277.56 B: drinking and uh smoking and that sort of thing too 

278.82 280.84 A: yeah i you know um 

281.59 283.67 A: like i said i work in a bar so 

282.99 284.57 B: mhm 

283.95 285.25 A: i see it happen a lot 

285.68 288.02 A: and i could certainly see um 

288.86 290.58 A: you know the destructive uh 

290.87 292.05 A: qualities of drinking 

292.08 292.67 B: mhm 

292.93 293.37 A: um 

293.69 297.70 A: i'm not much of a drinker myself i mean i'll i'll have a few drinks every now and then but 

298.34 298.78 A: you know 

299.27 302.02 A: not only do i see people who everyday have 

302.18 303.31 A: many drinks 

303.63 306.51 A: and it's just you know inherent in their lifestyle 

306.38 306.92 B: mhm 

306.80 309.54 A: or people who just sort of go to excess and then 

309.95 311.84 A: you know their behavior is uh 

312.20 313.49 A: i mean it's totally ridiculous 

313.89 314.80 B: yeah 

313.94 315.84 A: lack of judgment and stuff like this 

316.94 319.34 A: so those things kind of you know uh 

320.89 323.86 A: hard to see sometimes but i'm glad that i'm not um 

325.64 326.42 A: so much like that 

326.54 329.91 A: maybe in other ways but not with not with uh alcohol 

326.86 327.22 B: yeah 

330.02 330.87 B: yeah 

331.23 332.23 B: yeah my um 

332.81 333.45 B: actually 

333.70 338.31 B: i grew up in a family where the my parents worked in bars and restaurants so 

338.88 345.34 B: i'm kind of aware of of that whole sector of the economy myself and i remember one time i was 

343.01 343.39 A: uh-huh 

345.60 352.94 B: at my dad's tavern he didn't let me hang out there very much but one day i happened to be there and a phone call came in 

353.17 354.84 B: and uh he 

355.39 355.75 B: put 

356.11 365.17 B: he took the call and then he like put the phone on his chest and then he said tom are you here and then he had to like tell the person on the other end of 

365.42 365.97 B: -f th- 

367.04 372.64 B: if tom was at the bar or not and i mean and all so much lying goes on around drinking 

369.28 369.81 A: uh-huh 

373.59 375.03 B: an- and you kind of 

375.25 377.89 B: and in his case it was a neighborhood tavern so 

378.00 378.50 B: a lot of the 

385.32 385.90 A: uh-huh 

397.39 397.80 A: right 

398.83 401.22 A: and it it it amazes me too um 

402.05 404.66 A: you know i sort of feel that way too you know that uh 

404.97 407.51 A: maybe i shouldn't be you know making money this way 

408.12 412.12 A: but the the funny thing is the way people spend money when they're drinking 

411.84 412.41 B: hm 

412.61 416.43 A: it it really amazes me i mean the way a- they just seem to like n- 

416.82 419.55 A: in this lack of judgment situation you know money just kind of 

420.49 422.81 A: becomes irrelevant i i i feel like and 

423.28 423.93 B: uh-huh 

423.28 428.35 A: you know they just throw it down they want you know they want the booze more than they want 

425.30 426.24 B: yeah 

428.51 428.82 A: you know 

429.01 429.55 A: they need money 

429.85 430.80 B: mhm 

431.00 432.61 A: it's just funny that's 

432.32 433.40 B: it is funny and it's 

433.84 435.60 B: funny how much people will pay 

436.76 437.40 B: for a drink 

437.53 443.46 B: as opposed to how much they'd pay for you know an equal amount of milk or gasoline 

443.19 444.85 A: oh right i know 

445.26 446.12 A: drinks are not cheap 

446.24 447.16 B: hm no 

447.77 448.92 B: and uh 

447.78 448.46 A: not cheap 

455.07 462.52 B: i'm sort of poverty stricken most of my life i haven't been able to indulge that taste because you know i go to the store and i see you know an equal volume of 

462.70 471.71 B: say coke and wine and the coke is ninety nine cents and the wine is twelve dollars and i'm going wow hm i think maybe today i'll buy coke 

463.90 464.40 A: uh-huh 

467.98 468.41 A: right 

473.90 474.37 A: yeah 

474.41 475.70 B: and so 

475.99 478.29 B: the days when uh the value 

478.79 483.22 B: of that wi- of having that wine you know is high enough that i'm willing to 

483.35 487.18 B: part with that much money an- those those days are few and far between 

488.32 492.24 A: well there are ways to get around you know you can make your own 

491.06 493.56 B: yeah have you tried that 

493.88 496.14 A: uh in college i made my own beer 

496.30 497.27 A: i brewed my own beer 

496.32 496.73 B: uh-huh 

497.81 498.71 A: and um 

498.76 499.36 B: -n wa- 

498.95 500.02 A: did a couple batches 

500.15 501.42 B: was it good 

501.59 503.62 A: it was actually delicious yeah 

503.49 504.28 B: oh 

503.81 507.73 A: i was you know at at that point in my life i was really into 

507.82 510.70 A: all th- different beers and you know how they tasted and 

509.20 509.77 B: uh-huh 

510.47 511.29 B: yeah 

511.41 511.78 A: you know 

512.14 512.63 A: um 

512.75 517.47 A: so it was really fun and and delicious and you know after the initial expense 

517.56 518.14 B: mhm 

518.28 521.24 A: it it becomes very cheap because each batch yo- you know 

521.53 524.27 A: you just spend your your raw materials and you get y- you know 

524.50 525.91 A: fifty to a hundred bottles of beer 

526.00 526.54 B: uh-huh 

526.66 527.37 A: for you know 

527.56 527.98 A: twenty or 

528.32 529.10 A: or so dollars 

529.26 529.67 B: hm 

530.51 533.09 B: yeah i i guess that is pretty uh economical 

533.68 534.35 B: yeah especially if 

533.85 536.62 A: it is yeah but you got to buy all of the equipment so i- 

536.03 537.95 B: yeah the the cappers and 

538.12 538.74 A: yeah 

539.92 540.74 A: but um 

541.32 542.54 A: yeah that that was fun 

543.18 543.61 B: hm 

543.60 544.11 A: to do 

544.91 545.37 A: um 

545.79 549.42 A: you know that's i think that's always the approach i've had with alcohol is you know 

550.51 550.98 A: when i 

551.52 553.53 A: the times when i do drink it it's um 

553.90 554.63 A: you know sort of 

555.03 555.92 A: get into 

556.08 559.60 A: what i'm drinking and enjoy it like sort of like food we talked about the other day 

559.47 560.11 B: mhm 

560.07 560.77 A: and uh 

561.51 565.24 A: you know like which which are the fancier beers tha- might you know 

565.39 567.20 A: good wines complex wines and
