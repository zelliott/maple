58.03 60.10 B: go to the doctor and awake if you do 

60.59 61.76 A: uh-huh 

60.66 63.25 B: so it's like going to the doctor doesn't do you any good when 

63.79 64.41 A: right 

64.78 65.11 B: but 

65.22 66.96 B: i i don't know with that one it's kind of like 

67.47 68.16 B: in my case 

69.96 77.49 B: i always assume it's viral and so i don't go and then i'm sick for two weeks and i go and she's like well why didn't you get here sooner this isn't viral it's bacterial and you need some medicine 

77.54 78.13 A: right 

79.52 89.31 A: well i just think genera- i mean as long as people are relatively healthy like don't have any chronic diseases or conditions or anything then things just have to run their course 

89.59 89.92 B: right 

90.25 90.51 B: right 

90.25 90.59 A: so 

90.82 91.28 A: you know 

90.92 91.26 B: yeah 

91.99 93.01 B: do you have kids at all 

93.15 94.08 A: (( )) no 

96.22 96.83 B: that then it 

97.02 100.16 B: really hard to figure out you know do i take them do i not and 

100.56 102.47 B: with this change in weather especially like 

102.84 103.22 B: um 

103.37 103.99 B: i don't know what (( )) 

105.61 106.47 A: southwest 

107.71 108.17 B: midwest 

108.31 109.55 B: where it's nice and cold right now 

110.23 110.64 B: um 

112.25 113.37 B: you now we had um 

113.55 118.22 B: a fall where it was cold and then all of a sudden it was warm again and then it was cold and every time it changed 

117.10 117.80 A: right 

118.32 118.90 B: they were sick 

119.44 119.95 A: right 

120.26 122.70 B: so it's hard for i think it's hard for your body to 

123.50 126.56 A: definitely to bou- keep bouncing back from different extremes 

126.46 126.89 B: right 

127.16 131.43 A: right and so with the kids do you just do you usually um 

139.93 140.84 A: do you i mean 

140.95 144.03 A: do you normally take them to the doctor or do you just kind of wait 

144.21 149.56 B: it's kind of yeah we usually wait a while my husband's real good about saying now honey you know 

149.03 150.05 A: right 

150.08 153.46 B: it's not time to take them to the doctor just yet you don't need to panic 

153.06 154.37 A: no fever right 

153.99 154.97 B: yeah exactly 

156.35 156.73 B: and there 

156.82 157.96 B: i mean the kids are real 

158.10 160.58 B: my daughter's not real my oldest is not real um 

161.19 163.85 B: real good about being sick cause she never really has been she 

164.10 164.60 A: right 

164.37 167.53 B: fine and she's been sick like five times in her entire life 

166.72 170.20 A: healthy child that's good yeah 

168.63 168.98 B: but 

169.14 170.32 B: yeah 

170.43 171.58 B: but my other ones are 

172.06 174.63 B: sick all the time so they don't even think about it they just go around 

175.28 176.98 B: wiping their noses on their shirts and 

177.71 179.62 B: going on to whatever they were doing they don't really 

179.06 179.63 A: right 

180.29 180.86 A: and 

180.40 182.04 B: it doesn't really phase them 

181.81 186.22 A: and of course when you send them off to school they're exposed to all those germs and stuff there to from the other ones 

185.26 185.61 B: yeah 

186.31 186.81 B: exactly 

187.09 187.66 A: (( )) 

188.57 190.98 B: de- now does the weather change much where you are does that 

191.21 192.30 B: make a difference for 

192.07 195.87 A: um we're in northern arizona and flagstaff so it's 

194.87 195.85 B: uh-huh so you took it 

195.99 196.99 B: no one stops there 

218.92 219.49 B: mhm 

219.50 220.87 A: there so 

221.32 221.72 B: oh 

221.91 231.60 B: yeah my parents live in phoenix and i don't think they'd go any farther north than (( )) and my mom still complains oh it was sixty degrees here today dear it was so cold it's like 

226.66 227.64 A: right 

227.93 228.92 A: oh really 

230.28 232.30 A: exactly 

231.87 233.85 B: i'm not cold mother 

233.17 237.35 A: although i think that you feel it there more 

237.52 242.91 A: you know what i mean because it's your it's so hot all the time that when the temperature drops it just seems like 

242.05 242.54 B: right 

243.09 245.38 A: you know you need to being wearing your fur coat or something i don't know 

245.20 248.78 B: well yeah and i think about well of course they're older um my parents are in their seve- 

250.32 250.81 A: mhm 

254.23 256.78 B: i um i mean they seem to get sick you know when the weather changes 

257.46 259.01 B: for winter time even you know there 

258.74 259.87 A: oh even down there huh 

259.79 260.16 B: yeah 

261.14 262.61 B: so i don't know i don't know if that's a 

263.03 264.32 B: factor of age or (( )) 

265.57 266.17 B: i don't know 

266.34 266.84 A: right 

268.32 269.09 B: but their bodies are just 

269.30 273.26 B: so used to being in the mid- because because they moved from the midwest out there to retire 

273.08 273.63 A: mhm 

274.51 275.34 B: maybe their bodies are just 

275.52 275.92 B: on 

277.21 279.45 B: with the seasons no matter what whether they're there or 

278.82 280.42 A: right 

280.62 281.17 A: right 

284.87 288.17 A: what else oh what are things what are things you do to keep healthy 

293.47 294.21 A: uh-huh 

294.59 294.94 B: so 

294.88 299.31 A: well i think your society kind of it's hard not to be right 

297.56 298.61 B: mhm 

300.20 300.66 B: so it's like 

301.44 304.24 B: i i just wonder cause i i have friends who are like 

305.00 307.44 B: exercise fitness buff so they seem to stay healthier 

307.51 308.11 A: mhm 

313.85 317.70 A: right i have other things i need to do 

336.62 338.71 A: so yeah it does seem like a good idea 

339.02 341.38 A: kind of a luxury at this point 

340.91 342.56 B: right a theory but 

342.25 347.30 A: yeah exactly i think massive doses of vitamin c is always good too 

347.35 349.09 B: i've heard that i i know people that 

349.36 349.79 B: (( )) 

350.32 354.86 B: like about november hits they take vitamin c everyday and they keep it around and they're chewing it all the time and 

352.04 352.67 A: mhm 

355.06 355.62 A: yeah 

361.12 361.68 B: so are you a 

361.78 362.59 B: graduate student 

362.62 363.22 A: yeah 

363.92 364.62 B: what do you study 

363.95 364.37 A: mhm 

364.64 366.28 A: applied linguistics 

366.56 369.61 B: oh so you're actually in the in the linguistics field 

368.53 371.64 A: this is uh this is actually of academic interest to me yes 

371.33 372.73 B: there you go 

378.79 381.20 A: my second year of a p._h._d. program so 

381.43 383.80 A: trying yo- you know being active is kind of 

383.92 386.96 A: i don't i don't have time to be active really so 

386.59 386.90 B: right 

387.25 390.25 B: right yeah i just finished my second masters in library science and 

389.99 390.90 A: oh great 

392.79 397.76 B: yeah i know exactly where you're coming from it's like the most exercise i get is running up to the third floor of the library to 

397.16 403.56 A: exactly exactly right running from run class to the next or running around campus or doing something like that that's it 

400.90 401.33 B: right 

403.17 403.65 B: exactly 

406.24 407.23 A: and then what else 

407.87 409.60 A: what was the other topic 

410.60 412.89 A: are we still on the going to the doctor the 

413.59 416.73 B: yeah i think we covered i hope this is kind of a weird i mean 

417.41 419.08 B: when people talk about it casually 

419.39 419.99 A: right 

420.93 421.35 B: oh 

422.91 423.70 B: sick again 

429.20 430.45 A: a long period of time 

430.15 431.13 B: right right 

438.07 449.97 A: would be generated by the computer or whatever i thought to myself some of these are kind of more fertile for discussion with a stranger than others you know what i mean like some of them yeah i could see talking about this for a while but some 

440.56 440.91 B: mhm 

451.10 454.20 A: sports and i thought gosh i don't know what what on earth i would say about that 

453.61 456.45 B: i know i'm not a sports fan either so 

455.20 457.34 A: right 

457.11 458.13 B: (( )) 

457.62 458.04 A: so

462.69 463.20 A: uh-huh 

463.28 463.67 B: and 

463.95 464.51 B: so it's like 

464.76 470.17 B: well the first time i had forgotten to warn my husband so he come he answers the phone comes back out and he's hung up on the machine and i'm like 

470.28 471.96 B: oh wait i forgot to tell you 

472.57 473.49 B: so i haven't had a chance 

473.67 474.00 B: to 

474.44 477.36 B: explore the web site a little bit and see exactly what they're doing i just 

477.97 481.58 A: right they actually they they list i think about forty different topics 

482.14 487.80 A: that they see you know it could be any one of these things that you get called for and i think that you can choose not to 

487.98 488.33 B: right 

488.03 490.54 A: like if you don't like the topic you don't have to talk about it 

490.84 491.93 A: um 

492.08 494.65 A: so how did you hear about this or how did you find out about it 

494.60 495.05 B: i had a 

495.27 497.23 B: one of our professors emailed um 

497.38 500.04 B: all the students in the library science program and said 

500.84 502.92 B: said he was going on i don't know if it's a friend of his that 

503.04 504.49 B: doing it or it's somehow related 

504.25 504.87 A: oh cool 

505.42 506.46 B: what he's doing i'm cause 

507.00 508.72 B: i don't know linguistics and library science 

509.01 510.95 B: there kind of related but not really 

511.08 511.64 A: mhm 

511.61 512.39 B: (( )) um

524.98 526.10 A: exactly 

526.37 532.21 A: yeah i thought it would be kind of interesting kind of fun i'm really int- curious to find out what they end up doing with all the 

531.99 533.00 B: i know i know and 

532.61 533.47 A: (( )) to do 

534.21 536.00 B: the little i read it's like okay so how does 

537.83 538.74 B: and what's you know 

540.43 540.98 A: mhm 

541.59 546.15 A: my guess it's just to get um samples of speech data 

546.26 556.67 A: and i don't know you know and that which is pretty common in our field but i don't you and you analyze it for certain you know linguistic features for example but i have no idea what kinds of things they would be looking for 

557.73 561.29 B: yeah see i don't know i mean i know linguistics is the study of language but that's about 

561.96 562.68 B: i mean are they 

567.37 568.45 A: yeah 

584.06 586.22 A: um among people who don't know each other
