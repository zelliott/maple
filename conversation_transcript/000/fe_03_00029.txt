0.30 1.53 B: hi 

1.72 3.77 A: hi uh this is ted 

3.40 4.80 B: hi i'm cory 

4.79 9.44 A: hi cory um well gee i guess we've just heard what they want us to talk about [mn] 

9.06 12.43 B: yeah sounds like illness is the topic of the day 

11.85 25.79 A: yes it is um well gee um i let me start out and say that i don't believe that there's such a thing as this seasonal uh seasonal devel- uh what do they call it s._a._d. seasonal affective disorder 

25.40 26.26 B: mhm 

26.12 38.18 A: i think a lot of it just has to do i think a lot of it's psychological obviously but i think that a good bit of it is just um people are it's a natural thing and people just are trying to give it a name 

37.38 45.17 B: yeah although i think um lack of sunlight does have an effect on how people 

45.26 48.98 B: um react to the seasons 

49.07 51.88 B: um in the winter when the days get shorter 

52.13 55.30 B: and there's less sunlight i think that does play a role 

55.61 59.09 B: in health and wellness and things like that 

59.12 68.66 A: well [mn] i think i see what you're saying but i also think that that's that's probably able to be overcome 

68.79 74.46 A: i mean i think if you go to a place where there's light or you have a a lot of light in your own home or a lot of light in your own 

74.50 82.54 A: uh apartment or you go to places where it's light it it takes uh you you can counteract it i guess you don't have to suffer from it 

83.49 84.79 B: that may be true 

85.11 88.88 B: i don't know if artificial light has all the same things that sunlight does 

88.29 95.87 A: yeah well well r- right but but i mean i think we're assuming that there's something psychological here more than there is something chemical 

95.74 96.53 B: yeah 

95.90 98.22 A: though i don't know it could be both [mn] 

97.65 100.24 B: yeah i i don't know either but 

99.61 106.18 A: yeah yeah i mean my own thing is i i'm a person who who just who reads a lot and likes to read 

105.42 106.76 B: mhm 

106.12 117.32 A: and what i will often do particularly on winter days [mn] is to get some of my favorite books out which often take place in places other than the north other than the cold 

117.00 117.94 B: uh-huh 

117.60 125.37 A: and and just sort of escape to uh whatever island i happen to be reading about and that works for me 

123.08 124.07 B: yeah 

124.77 126.42 B: yeah 

127.34 131.20 B: yeah but i know that i'm the kind of person who in the fall 

131.34 136.44 B: did i just always seem to get sick right about the time the weather changes [mn] you know 

134.58 138.27 A: [laughter] d- d- do do you take vitamins or 

138.02 150.61 B: i don't no i i don't know if it's really the weather so much as just i think it's that time of year it tends to be you know i've been busy all summer and you end up getting kind of run down and then the fall comes and 

148.56 149.49 A: yeah 

150.65 152.72 B: by then you know 

152.06 153.52 A: something gets you 

152.90 158.37 B: yeah if you you know the right germs find me and just always seem to happen about the same time 

157.92 159.16 A: mhm 

158.76 161.25 B: and i sometimes have allergies so i'm sure that 

161.56 164.05 B: weakens my defense system too 

163.77 173.44 A: maybe i've been lucky but uh when i was younger i'm in my forties now but when i'm when i was younger i got sick a lot uh 

173.50 184.65 A: and since i hit about thirty five or forty i i believe it or not i'm sick a whole lot less than i used to be i can go a year and a half two years without getting a cold thank god 

184.28 188.85 B: that's nice [laughter] i hope by the time i'm thirty five or forty it's i can 

185.51 187.08 A: [laughter] 

189.08 190.76 B: i won't have colds as well yeah 

189.98 192.87 A: yeah somethi- something to look forward to right 

191.40 194.52 B: [laughter] that sounds like a good part of aging 

194.05 197.81 A: yeah [laughter] well there are others that aren't so good [laughter] but uh 

196.54 197.71 B: [laughter] 

197.92 207.62 A: yeah um th- what was the other thing that they oh yeah about a cold taking seven if you take medicine would take seven days and if you if you don't take medicine it takes a week 

207.45 209.10 B: or if you go to the doctor 

208.59 210.15 A: yeah that's right 

210.29 214.72 A: yeah i've heard that before and and i think that's pretty true 

214.39 219.79 B: yeah yeah well otherwise i'm one of those people who by the time i make the doctor's appointment 

219.82 222.94 B: for the next day i'll be fine by the next day 

223.14 224.84 A: [laughter] yeah right 

223.66 226.79 B: [laughter] you know because i always wait so long i guess 

226.53 235.61 A: well yeah things have a way of working themselves out i mean i i guess i guess i don't know how old you are but in my in my experience the uh 

227.24 228.32 B: i tend to be 

236.36 241.04 A: you know pretty early whether it's something serious or something not 

240.40 241.66 B: mhm 

241.27 245.76 A: and and then you just sort o- most of the time you just sort of let it ride itself out 

245.61 246.95 B: yeah 

246.99 256.18 B: yeah i hate going to the doctor and they've been like having them say oh you're fine [laughter] so i always tend to wait to make sure it's not just something that's gonna pass 

251.73 253.19 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

253.82 256.80 A: i know that's really embarrassing isn't it [laughter] 

256.80 260.88 B: so um i know i was teaching and i found that uh 

261.43 269.67 B: i would pick things up from my students you know and you know if you get a sore throat you're like well is this just a sore throat is it strep throat do i need to go 

269.76 278.79 B: and every time i'd wait and then finally i'd be like oh it's just not going away i'd better go and by the next day when i went to the doctor i'd be like sorry it's fine now [mn] 

278.16 291.29 A: but on the other hand if you're if you're working with students and such you should have been exposed to just about every possible illness that there is so y- you know over time i would think you probably build up a pretty good immunity 

286.71 287.57 B: yeah 

291.06 294.12 B: yeah i think you do but i mean 

293.98 295.64 A: but over time 

294.23 299.61 B: there's always so many different viruses and bugs and everything else that 

299.14 301.45 A: yeah yeah [laughter] 

300.87 307.08 B: and i i was teaching band so like you know the kid would play on the instrument they'd be like this isn't working right you know and i'd 

307.11 309.90 B: never think about it and just start playing on it to see and then 

309.49 310.96 A: (( oh ev- [mn] )) 

310.10 314.78 B: you know i mean direct contact it wasn't just like they were breathing on me so 

314.14 321.21 A: so so that now did these kids keep their own instruments or did they did they share them with the next period and the next period after that 

320.65 326.76 B: oh no they had their own instruments but you know a lot of times it would just be me who was gonna get sick some more [mn] 

322.02 324.07 A: oh good so at least they 

325.80 328.11 A: yeah terrific [laughter] 

327.39 329.02 B: [laughter] so 

328.15 330.74 A: made made you long for the violin right 

330.14 336.01 B: yeah yeah [mn] yes i looked forward to those percussion lessons instead 

333.16 334.30 A: okay 

335.75 339.09 A: yeah indeed something where you don't actually need to blow [mn] 

338.85 340.65 B: [mn] right so 

340.84 342.09 B: and then of course 

342.11 345.88 B: it you know sometimes it's a matter of you didn't realise they were sick until 

345.92 348.74 B: after you did that you know i'd go oh no 

348.38 349.73 A: mhm 

349.22 351.15 B: and then you can't help but wonder if it's 

351.36 357.36 B: was i just starting to feel sick because i you know i knew oh man now i'm going to get sick and then you do or 

357.70 359.12 B: is it really the germ 

358.96 367.95 A: yeah yeah well i the ul- i mean getting sick and like i say i haven't been sick in a while and of course now that i've said that i'll probably end up getting sick tomorrow 

367.57 369.29 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

368.17 375.23 A: but but what i always do is i kind of look at it as this is somebody's way of telling me hey slow down 

375.19 376.33 B: yeah 

375.72 389.87 A: and and usually it's you know i can use even if even if my throat stops hurting or my nose stops being stuffed or whatever it's one of those where it's really good to just to just [mn] rest and not do anything for a couple of days 

389.40 392.94 B: yeah sometimes your body just needs that break [mn] 

392.22 396.76 A: yeah yeah that's real really kind of healthy just every now and then to lay in bed 

396.65 398.46 B: yeah 

398.28 399.54 A: i see 

399.27 405.48 B: i always like those kind of days where you can catch up on your reading and the videos that you haven't had time to watch and things like that 

404.84 408.06 A: mhm mhm well like well i [mn] 

408.14 416.54 A: long story but but we were i was out of i was out of town but the people where i am here um had a snow day earlier this week 

416.23 417.07 B: okay 

416.97 419.09 A: and i was talking to 

419.15 421.27 A: [cough] to some of them today at work 

421.31 429.33 A: and they were saying it was just great they woke up and it was like they didn't they knew that they didn't need to do anything and they couldn't do anything because they couldn't drive 

429.11 430.40 B: yeah 

429.75 434.30 A: so they thought what a great day just to turn over and go back to sleep 

434.65 441.25 B: there is something about those days like the day after thanksgiving where you have the day off and you're not gonna go shopping 

439.35 441.80 A: yeah it's just down time 

441.62 445.77 B: [mn] you know you can just snuggle in and you know 

445.83 451.06 B: i always want to set the alarm on those days just 'cause i can finally just turn it off and go back to bed 

449.50 454.44 A: yeah [laughter] sort sort of to spite it [laughter] to spite the alarm clock 

452.43 453.80 B: yeah [laughter] 

454.24 456.33 B: (( yeah so )) 

455.33 456.54 A: yeah 

456.61 459.87 B: my husband doesn't understand that though so usually i don't get to 

459.57 462.34 A: oh well sorry to hear that 

461.38 462.75 B: [laughter] 

462.99 465.17 A: (( yeah very well )) 

465.79 468.69 A: hey so tell me how long are we supposed to talk in this thing 

468.74 472.18 B: uh ten minutes i don't if they break in and tell you when that's up 

471.66 473.09 A: oh okay 

472.84 474.79 B: or not i haven't done one of these before 

475.02 476.09 A: pardon me 

475.50 477.34 B: i haven't done one of these before 

476.88 481.95 A: no me neither it came in in an email and i thought well gee what the heck let's give it a try [laughter] 

481.21 484.92 B: yeah that's what i thought i thought ten bucks i can talk for a while [laughter] 

483.82 488.07 A: yeah and they said they they might they'll call you as many as twenty five more times 

488.38 490.94 B: i know that's a lot of times [mn] 

490.12 493.56 A: yeah yeah i don't know what i'll talk about the entire thing 

492.80 493.81 B: [laughter] 

493.96 500.59 A: but anyway so back to illness um do y- do you have kids do you have your kids been sick or 

498.88 499.66 B: (( no )) 

500.19 503.70 B: i'm expecting my first one right now so 

502.16 505.15 A: oh w- well won't that be fun then 

504.73 507.07 B: yeah yeah so 

506.73 511.37 A: yeah i can remember i i've got m- now my kids are both in college 

511.00 512.06 B: (( okay [mn] )) 

511.42 517.92 A: but um when they were younger it was always oh my goodness every time one of them would cry 

517.93 526.02 A: it would be oh is she sick does she have an earache does she have this that and the other thing and you get so sensitive to that 

525.65 527.12 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

526.61 535.20 A: and then after they get to be about six or seven years old you kind of throw up your hands and you say what the heck you know [laughter] let 'em suffer for a day or so 

534.84 542.13 B: yeah [laughter] yeah it's definitely different i uh was student teaching in first grade this semester and 

542.17 549.74 B: to see how how sick some of those kids would come to school and you're just like why are you here you know you're green 

549.88 558.50 B: you obviously feel terrible why are you here oh i thought i'd feel better if i came to school mom said i'd feel better if i came to school i'm just like 

556.91 560.21 A: (( [laughter] yeah well that's somewhat of a copout )) 

559.87 565.24 B: oh i'm just like your mom didn't want to take off work that's why you're here that's nice 

562.51 568.53 A: that's it that's it well that's true we were lucky though when my kids were young um 

568.58 570.61 A: either my ex wife or i 

570.55 584.10 A: could always finagle a way to stay home so yeah i i actually had a job that that was really flexible in that respect and so when the kid was sick it was like okay i can just you know work from home 

583.92 586.03 B: (( that that's a nice thing to have no )) 

585.71 587.41 A: yeah 

587.50 590.45 A: of course as a teacher you can't really do that 

591.55 592.24 B: no 

592.52 600.58 B: that wouldn't work my husband sometimes will have the freedom to do that but he also has a job where there's a lot of meetings so depending on the meetings of the day 

596.00 597.79 A: yeah 

600.27 601.91 A: mhm sure 

601.04 602.64 B: we'll see [mn] 

603.12 614.22 A: yeah but the the key thing is no matter what uh i'm speaking of kids now doesn't matter how sick they are how well they are they all you know ninety nine point nine percent of 'em turn out just fine 

614.20 615.66 B: yeah that's true 

616.40 618.11 B: and you know 

618.83 630.03 B: it's interesting because everybody's told us oh when you have your baby you'll be amazed how often you have to run to the doctor and you just get used to it you'll go and they'll tell you the kid's fine and all these things and i'm just like oh man 

629.67 631.06 A: mhm 

630.11 632.85 B: [mn] not looking forward to that part at all 

632.17 634.11 A: yeah yeah 

633.26 639.73 B: because i'll be one of those parents who's a little more like well we'll just let it go a little bit longer and see if everything's o- 

639.13 646.71 A: well i was going to say read a lot you'll get a whole get a handle on that [laughter] you know when to freak and when not to freak 

641.58 642.48 B: [laughter]
