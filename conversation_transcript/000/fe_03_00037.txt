46.25 55.36 A: yeah it's i live in a city and it's pretty cold i do realize that as the seasons change the p- a lot of people do i myself find i have a 

55.39 59.28 A: tendency of getting allergies as the seasons change 

60.53 64.12 B: [noise] yeah i i really don't see that much of a difference it's 

63.59 64.42 A: (( no )) 

65.48 71.36 A: yeah probably [laughter] you are used to all the seasons i i i've been living in ohio city for uh 

71.43 76.60 A: (( now al- almost three years now so i'm not used to that much of cold )) 

76.78 81.02 A: (( and so when it gets really when it gets cold i really do )) 

81.10 85.06 A: feel it on my body and i do get allergies cold 

85.28 86.33 B: mhm 

86.90 89.28 B: yeah it's um [mn] 

89.36 97.85 B: it's mainly my take on it is people get more colds during the winter it's because they're inside with other people a lot more like at the shopping mall and stuff 

98.50 103.64 A: yeah i suppose so yeah [laughter] yeah tha- i also agree to that 

103.80 107.31 B: [noise] the thing is it's not 

107.72 111.95 B: i don't i don't see it as the weather i see it as just you now um 

113.88 115.58 B: lifestyle changes 

116.00 119.29 A: yeah yeah i do realize but 

116.14 117.11 B: (( you know like [noise] )) 

120.32 129.19 A: i also feel sometimes that they are people are also sometimes more prone to allergies because i have other f- members in my family and 

129.20 136.04 A: it's only me that i seem to get allergies when the seasons change and i am always i think at least for ten or 

136.23 148.43 A: eleven hours in a a day i am with my family members and th- they never seem to get the allergies so i think that people are also kind of prone to allergies and some people others just aren't 

147.70 150.27 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah yeah it's )) 

150.81 155.98 B: it's the conditions like the plants and animals changing for the winter 

155.60 157.13 A: yeah 

156.55 161.88 B: like [mn] like between winter and spring the trees are releasing all this pollen and you 

162.97 166.53 B: know it's mainly [mn] so that's mainly when i head inside 

166.48 168.11 A: yeah yeah yeah sure 

172.94 175.30 B: (( [sigh] [mn] )) 

175.34 176.81 B: (( even the )) 

177.36 178.28 B: (( [sigh] )) 

179.00 185.11 B: the cold the cold thing that it asked me to asked us to talk about um 

183.52 184.60 A: yeah 

188.26 201.54 B: [mn] i i you know i i really don't go to the doctor for colds like [mn] i'll just i'll just come into work and be sick as opposed to going to the doctor and sitting in the waiting room and him telling me to go home and be sick [mn] 

201.19 210.76 A: yeah yeah i i also i do get allergies i'm really prone to allergies and i do get allergies but i rarely go to the doctor for the allergies either uh 

210.67 214.68 A: some try some drinking more sort of liquids because 

211.27 212.00 B: (( [noise] )) 

214.47 220.61 A: i do feel that i know that doctors also they don't have any remedies they would just either prescribe uh 

220.39 233.95 A: anti allergic or something like that or nas- nasal dis- decongestant and they also prescribe just more drink more liquid so i i would rather just now i'm used to it and i know what to do so i just stay home or 

235.95 239.67 A: [noise] take more liquids and try to be normal and not get 

240.03 245.43 A: really upset with allergies and i i'd sort of like to overcome the allergies 

246.49 247.58 B: (( [noise] yeah it's )) 

248.03 251.77 B: i i i'm allergic to cats and stuff but 

252.20 256.03 B: [mn] i g- the trees really don't do anything to me [noise] [mn] [mn] [mn] 

255.57 260.52 A: yeah yeah that's i think a different kind of uh allergy that 

260.84 270.21 A: y- you you can't do anything just stay away from cats but these seasonal allergies i think you have this tendency once a- after 

270.42 273.09 A: (( two or three years so you know what what kind of )) 

273.10 278.52 A: allergies you have and what kind of precautions you can take or what really helps 

278.61 287.07 A: (( so because many a times in colds i feel that drinking something hot coffee or coke [mn] th- that )) 

287.17 301.90 A: really helps so you can just see i i now i know as soon as i start feeling uh something is g- going to be wrong tomorrow i just start taking more liquids and i also sort of try to minimize the effect of allergies 

288.20 289.47 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

302.06 306.05 B: [noise] i mean that's why i don't do anything because i drink like three pots of coffee a day

346.19 354.54 A: ooh [laughter] i don't think that would be any if that was the case i i don't even think that lots of people who'd likely do that

407.96 418.23 A: do you just feel that it's normal the people who are close tend to tend to take three or four cups of coffee they just go for the normal when they are sick or not
