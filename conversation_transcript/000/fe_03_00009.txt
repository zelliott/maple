211.86 213.06 B: oh okay 

213.27 213.74 B: okay 

213.68 216.64 A: unfortunately i uh it's not an exciting city 

216.76 217.40 B: oh really 

216.91 217.97 A: it's beautiful but 

218.47 220.84 A: you know it's big and beautiful but 

221.04 221.32 B: hmm 

221.32 225.01 A: it's more like a formal city because it's the capitol you know 

225.19 225.91 B: yeah yeah 

225.93 229.43 A: yeah there are better cities like istanbul and (( )) 

229.43 229.98 B: i see 

230.11 235.21 A: and better food there too (( )) ankara is not rich that rich 

235.52 236.65 A: compared to other cities 

235.52 237.70 B: yeah i was thinki- yeah i was wondering if you were from the 

237.95 239.80 B: coast i was wondering if there's um 

240.43 244.81 B: like really if there's a special kind of cuisine like up on the northern coast or 

245.10 250.25 A: yeah i mean they that even more cultures than all of them are ancient 

250.24 251.06 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

250.91 260.08 A: uh i mean here of course there are lots of immigrants they bring there own food but the the all of them are so americanized i guess 

255.77 256.10 B: yeah 

259.77 260.11 B: yeah 

260.35 262.62 A: (( )) i mean this is my experience with 

262.72 265.88 A: greek and you know arabic and turkish cuisine i 

266.33 267.38 A: i ate here 

267.47 267.80 B: yeah 

267.71 270.80 A: you know it's so different than what i'm used to 

270.59 271.08 B: i see 

271.16 272.82 A: so it changes the 

273.18 274.86 A: the format chan- changes 

275.16 278.41 A: becomes americanized the portions get huge and 

278.11 279.48 B: right 

279.38 280.19 A: you know there's not 

280.66 284.36 A: more the it's more labor intensive definitely in turkey 

284.59 285.05 B: really 

284.65 285.62 A: (( )) you know 

285.73 286.04 A: not 

285.75 286.08 B: yeah 

286.95 293.57 A: here i don't know the i don't like the in- ingredients too like especially the meat 

293.65 293.98 B: mmm 

294.31 295.28 A: the it's more like 

295.43 301.05 A: uh turkish meat uh taste more like kosher meat you know less blood 

300.29 300.76 B: oh 

301.59 304.14 A: so i'm not used to those hamburgers with 

304.25 305.37 A: lots of juice 

305.56 306.36 B: i see 

306.26 310.45 A: i'm not religious i don't care you know it's if it's halal or it's kosher or 

308.41 308.72 B: yeah 

311.12 313.00 A: but still it doesn't taste as good it 

313.18 316.52 A: the you can taste the iron in the blood you know and i mean 

313.37 313.84 B: uh 

316.78 317.90 A: and smell it too 

318.19 320.93 B: oh okay i had never even thought about that so 

321.17 322.89 B: if it's halal or 

323.07 324.66 B: or even kosher then 

325.09 328.98 B: and and it's butchered then they they they carefully drain the blood 

329.27 337.67 A: yeah because it the main point is in both religions it's not to torture animals to let all the blood flow i don't know it's it must be a 

337.79 339.48 A: certain ancient belief of 

339.60 340.76 A: you know spirits and 

339.72 340.43 B: i see 

341.36 342.18 A: thus all the 

342.67 343.53 A: rid of the blood 

343.74 344.69 B: huh okay 

344.29 345.00 A: which makes it 

345.20 346.01 A: taste better 

346.10 351.16 B: and i never even thought about that i mean i'd knew i knew at the basically i mean i'd i knew about 

351.29 352.67 B: uh kosher food 

352.78 356.50 B: and halal food in that it was prepared but i never thought about the fact that it would 

357.12 358.44 B: change the taste 

358.69 363.80 A: yeah it definitely does i mean you can taste (( )) you know for example kosher franks and 

359.89 360.22 B: yeah 

363.96 364.29 B: yeah 

364.65 367.24 A: regular beef franks uh they're uh different 

367.47 367.79 B: huh 

368.60 370.38 A: so are hamburgers especially 

371.01 373.31 A: i can't eat ham- hamburger here no 

373.43 375.08 B: yeah 

374.07 376.55 A: uh it's so juicy you know 

375.79 382.58 B: yeah i've kind of given up on hamburgers here as well every time it seems like every time you turn on the t._v. you hear about some another 

382.81 384.22 B: ecoli break out 

384.71 386.62 B: with hamburgers in the u._s. 

386.77 388.25 A: oh yeah yeah 

387.12 388.92 B: uh you know it's like you can't trust it 

389.21 389.71 B: you know 

390.36 391.83 B: and that's actually the one thing that i'd 

391.94 395.19 B: just kind of turned me off to some restaurants is 

396.37 397.47 B: the the more 

397.64 399.19 B: it's sort of like the older i get 

400.16 401.66 B: the more i realize that 

402.03 403.33 B: you have to be careful 

404.21 406.79 B: like you have you have to know how it's prepared 

407.51 408.82 A: yeah definitely 

407.55 410.20 B: you know you have to trust the restaurant basically 

410.54 413.46 A: yeah i don't trust any of those fast food chains either 

410.81 411.25 B: um 

413.09 414.10 B: right exactly 

413.78 415.96 A: but i sometimes eat there so there's

419.85 420.83 B: that are okay 

421.13 421.46 B: but 

421.54 422.79 B: most of them (( )) 

423.60 426.59 B: uh i don't know it's just kind of you just have to 

427.62 429.37 B: pick you have to pick and choose i guess 

430.22 431.61 A: yeah yeah definitely 

432.03 435.28 B: (( )) now do is um is octopus a big uh 

435.39 437.77 B: uh major part of the cuisine in turkey 

438.01 440.29 A: um not rea- i i mean it's a special one 

440.29 443.78 B: yeah cause i know what it's i've i have i've never been to turkey i've been to greece 

444.26 447.67 B: and uh when i was there i had uh broiled octopus

451.10 451.38 B: oh 

453.34 456.18 A: real special and more usually expensive 

456.40 456.84 B: really 

456.67 461.56 A: i mean no one cooks octopus at home unless they buy it frozen 

461.83 462.32 B: really 

461.96 467.26 A: you know it's you know it's really really hard to prepare you have to hit it to 

462.46 462.95 B: okay 

467.46 472.27 A: rocks literally the surface shouldn't be smooth so to get rid of all the 

472.78 478.49 A: you know they have a de- defensive mechanism like a ink kind of thing inside so 

475.49 475.84 B: yeah
