85.21 88.28 A: feeling sick i eat um chicken noodle soup uh 

88.39 94.91 A: you know a bowl of campbells and that really comes up just from a upbringing my my mom i think her mom you know had her do it and 

95.05 97.39 A: um i think psychologically like it helps 

97.54 100.33 A: cause you know if you do that that you're taking care of yourself and 

100.15 104.80 B: uh yeah i understood that it was more psychological than than actually had any real uh 

105.99 106.55 B: um 

106.78 108.17 B: what's the word i'm therapeutic 

108.46 108.85 A: yeah 

109.45 109.98 B: um 

111.50 112.18 B: a- you know 

112.99 114.10 B: but um i i just 

114.84 118.32 B: i just take vitamin c and you know (( )) try to go to bed earlier 

120.19 120.60 B: the night 

120.90 121.30 A: right 

121.40 121.68 A: right 

122.42 125.90 B: and that kind of thing but you know you usually good virus every year 

126.56 126.88 A: right 

126.90 128.94 B: never fails and it's this time of the year 

130.10 130.85 A: yeah yeah 

131.11 138.30 A: i i tend to maybe g- get sick uh only once a year and if i do it's always this time of year you know winter sort of as the seasons change 

138.41 139.50 B: around christmas time 

139.47 139.82 A: yeah 

139.95 140.23 A: yeah 

140.45 142.03 B: you have children or married or 

141.91 143.21 A: um no i'm i'm 

143.32 144.49 A: i'm single i'm um 

144.59 147.55 A: sort of a student you know post undergrad but uh but a student again 

147.83 148.68 B: are you at penn 

149.08 149.47 A: no 

151.44 151.86 B: hm 

152.61 155.45 B: i think just because of all the running around you do at christmas 

156.11 158.49 B: or at least i do (( )) i have a couple kids and uh 

159.03 164.17 B: you know it's a lot of running around a lot of uh cleaning and shopping and sometimes baking and uh 

164.50 164.79 A: yeah 

164.77 165.91 B: so and working 

166.16 168.94 B: you know full forty hours so it's like a very exhausting 

169.44 171.92 B: time of year and that's the time you get hit with it 

172.22 173.02 A: right right 

174.03 178.74 B: strep throat or a real good virus and it usually puts you down for three or four days 

180.60 182.87 B: so i don't think there's much to do to stop it from coming 

183.15 184.62 B: except maybe get a flu shot now 

185.12 186.02 A: yeah yeah 

186.17 189.99 A: i mean you know like you said i mean i think it's just balance with you know 

190.10 194.51 A: um you know work forty hours a week well especially i'm sure it all changes when you have kids 

194.67 195.76 A: and and a family 

196.49 198.92 A: um because then i i don't know exercising that 

199.09 200.60 A: that sort of thing gets put off 

201.07 206.27 B: yeah cause i d- i g- i do go to the gym but so many times i i just can't make it and uh 

206.54 206.92 A: uh huh 

206.90 208.05 B: that's one of those things that's not 

208.38 209.84 B: should be a priority but isn't 

210.10 210.81 A: right right 

211.45 212.05 A: understandable 

214.10 215.72 B: so uh you go to school 

215.88 217.48 B: now you said you were an undergraduate 

217.52 220.57 A: yeah yeah i i'm in atlanta studying graphic design 

221.16 223.16 B: oh i was taking graphic design courses 

223.21 223.74 A: oh really 

224.10 225.42 B: yeah in philadelphia 

225.55 226.94 A: huh okay that's great 

227.76 229.01 B: so what do you intend to do with it 

229.23 229.95 A: um 

230.34 232.23 A: you know m- maybe one day just sort of uh 

232.75 234.15 A: be at work independently but 

234.34 234.97 A: but um 

236.01 238.79 A: you know i'm real into sort of editorial and and uh 

239.37 241.35 A: y- magazine publishing and that sort of thing 

241.81 242.99 B: okay that sounds good 

242.02 242.43 A: so 

243.10 243.43 A: yeah 

243.84 247.71 B: cause i know in philadelphia uh i know uh someone who just graduated from uh 

248.78 253.57 B: moore college of art and uh it's hard to find a job she took a job in new york 

253.80 254.49 A: right right 

254.67 256.70 B: cause we have five major schools here 

256.91 257.25 A: right 

257.75 260.49 B: and uh if you you figure even if they graduate 

260.91 262.34 B: forty or fifty students 

262.76 264.50 B: and i know they graduate more than that 

264.61 265.34 A: right right 

265.50 269.07 B: then you know sort of flooding the market with all these artists and designers and 

269.65 270.93 B: package designers 

271.41 272.53 A: yes exactly 

271.91 273.38 B: and so it's hard for the uh 

274.24 276.81 B: f- f- for industry to absorb them 

278.49 280.98 B: but i was very interested in graphic design for a while 

281.17 282.95 A: yeah yeah it's it's a good field so 

283.38 287.42 B: it's fascinating you know when you it it it's actually like up to you to create everything 

287.71 288.08 A: uh huh 

289.53 289.92 A: yeah 

289.67 291.24 B: you know i get a couple of uh 

292.34 294.52 B: like we would create our own logo for uh 

294.63 295.88 B: a a business 

295.93 296.32 A: hm mhm 

297.08 297.91 B: all in theory 

298.49 299.64 B: and you put together 

300.07 302.89 B: paper envelopes letterhead 

301.78 303.99 A: yeah yeah i'm actually working on some of that now so 

304.12 305.71 B: yeah so it's kind of fascinating 

305.73 306.82 A: yeah it is it is 

306.64 308.36 B: do do you do that on the computer 

308.51 308.94 A: yeah 

309.04 309.37 A: yeah 

310.03 313.57 B: i suppose it's a lot faster i was doing it by hand everything was done by hand 

312.38 313.07 A: oh really 

313.80 314.56 A: oh goodness 

315.21 319.08 A: i'm i'm staring at a macintosh like most of uh most of the hours of the day 

320.18 320.66 A: um 

320.98 323.94 A: but but it's it's great i mean it's fun with the computer um 

324.28 325.14 A: i have a good time with it 

326.17 327.67 B: you have so many programs now 

327.79 328.88 A: oh yeah yeah 

329.32 333.15 A: (( )) continually you know updating it and and coming new and everything so 

334.10 336.36 A: um so are you affiliated with the university 

336.88 337.92 B: no no 

337.73 338.36 A: oh okay 

338.06 339.01 B: my son is though 

339.04 339.60 A: oh okay 

340.10 342.07 B: he's matter of fact he's the one that asked me to 

342.50 343.88 B: participate in this program 

344.05 344.38 A: right 

344.85 347.18 B: he's a linguist at the university of pennsylvania 

347.23 347.69 A: okay 

347.79 348.29 A: that's right 

348.75 353.29 A: yeah i'd i had a friend email me from uh gosh university of arizona who 

353.40 354.24 A: somehow um 

354.46 359.36 A: you know g- got an email i guess from u. penn and so she forwarded it on to friends and that's how i got it so 

360.65 362.92 A: um but it you know sounds like pretty interesting uh 

363.41 364.60 A: research they were doing so 

364.91 367.90 B: i wonder if we're supposed to stick to their topic or you know just 

367.60 370.41 A: uh i don't know i imagine i imagine there's a lot of diversion 

368.21 368.80 B: let's talk 

371.42 372.12 A: um 

372.27 378.34 A: or or or that they computer would tell us i'm not sure um but but that's fine i'll um 

379.20 380.48 A: illness goodness i um 

380.57 380.92 A: you know 

381.66 384.65 B: yeah there's not i mean there's just not a lot to say about it 

384.86 385.25 A: yeah 

385.21 386.53 B: not something you want to dwell on 

386.93 387.31 A: yeah 

387.52 387.99 B: um 

389.43 390.54 B: i'd rather talk about art 

391.08 393.81 A: yeah i'm um me too i have a feeling this this survey um 

393.94 396.01 A: may seem 

396.70 398.72 A: may see what the conversation leads to 

398.82 402.24 A: not ju- from a given topic to to 

401.85 404.62 B: okay okay see how you segue 

403.15 405.87 A: i i don't know that that may that may be my hunch i'm not sure but 

406.13 407.21 A: so 

407.51 409.84 B: did you study art also like uh 

411.87 414.26 A: i actually no i mean i don't come from uh 

414.48 420.07 A: you know i come from a military family and my my parents never like exposed me to the arts and i feel like 

420.24 425.03 A: you know when i've got out on my own i i've sort of been hungry for it but but i actually i'm not 

425.94 427.13 A: i i don't have any 

427.31 430.39 A: you know artistic background at all which is a little strange um 

430.45 431.97 B: no art history at all 

432.00 432.43 A: no 

432.51 433.00 A: nothing 

433.17 439.11 A: i mean i've never you know i'm i'm actually a little afraid to sort of push a pin and draw but but i i have good ideas and i'm i 

439.26 446.10 A: feel like i'm creative just in i don't know other ways so i'm i'm a little bit different than some of my classmates who are just you know like oozing artistic talent 

446.50 447.60 B: you're i wasn't either 

448.08 448.45 A: yeah 

448.32 451.74 B: i i you know really couldn't draw and when i walked into art class with my 

452.40 456.38 B: notepad and and i said if people are drawing beautiful things i'm walking out 

456.39 457.92 A: right oh i feel the same way 

456.94 461.48 B: and they weren't they weren't and you know we had an excellent teacher who taught us how to 

462.24 466.84 B: look at everything and you know he had not paint but draw negative space as well as 

467.07 468.10 B: positive space 

468.10 468.77 A: right right 

468.38 472.38 B: and that's kind of a foundation for really looking at things as opposed to 

473.65 475.12 B: drawing what you think you see 

475.25 475.61 A: right 

476.04 476.92 B: and uh 

477.93 479.35 B: and then you know studying 

479.49 481.31 B: art history so you sort of know 

482.36 483.39 B: what's been done 

483.55 484.03 A: hm mhm 

484.03 485.18 B: and how it's been done 

485.53 485.93 A: hm mhm 

486.56 493.20 B: and uh i don't know i think i think any any background in art i think it just sort of expands your mind opens you up to ideas 

493.43 494.33 A: oh yeah yeah 

494.44 498.08 B: i also had good ideas but to say i had a loud a lot of talent no 

499.44 502.62 B: yet i was you know usually at the top of the class with the things i did 

502.95 503.66 A: yeah yeah 

505.84 507.16 B: so that that was always neat 

507.77 509.74 B: i just being creative i think is real neat 

509.91 515.97 A: yeah i mean it's it's just satisfying to do that i mean i have i a spring in my step now that i didn't have 

516.34 522.27 A: you know a few months earlier when i was working sort of um like in marketing for this boring financial planner 

521.75 522.11 B: right 

522.45 524.06 A: and i just you know dreaded uh 

524.22 525.81 A: going to work and that sort of thing so 

526.57 527.64 A: so it's good to at least 

528.21 529.25 A: um and be vibrant 

530.08 531.51 A: and and what i do is (( )) 

532.13 534.54 B: m- i think uh with your creative 

534.97 536.63 B: you're only happy when you're creating 

536.82 537.17 A: hm mhm 

537.84 540.46 B: at least that's the way i feel i don't care if i'm tearing a room apart 

540.81 541.18 A: right 

541.19 543.58 B: ripping the walls down i'm just happy doing it 

543.84 544.48 A: right right 

545.08 548.51 B: you know some people may see it as a lot of work but i'll take it apart and rebuild it 

549.25 551.82 B: and then pick the colors and pick the furniture you know 

552.70 555.34 B: pick everything that's going to go in it and it's really neat 

558.26 559.07 B: did you ever try that 

559.73 564.68 A: um n- i've done very little uh you know just cause i've been in my own apartments and that sort of thing 

565.43 567.29 A: so eh eh is that what you meant like like 

567.44 568.49 A: remodeling or something 

567.64 571.73 B: e- well yeah remodeling a house or (( )) i have this big house and uh 

572.22 572.62 A: yeah 

573.72 576.16 B: in the suburbs of philadelphia and uh 

577.54 580.60 B: you know it's been a lot of fun like thirteen rooms 

580.83 587.51 A: oh that's great yeah i remember you know just growing up i was always thought um you know when i get older i want to live in a in a fixer upper but 

588.16 592.24 A: the older i get the the less i feel that way just because of of time you know 

592.85 594.92 A: i mean i would rather have my time to spend with 

595.22 597.60 A: kids or you know wife or 

597.79 600.03 A: you know doing my own selfish things than 

600.39 602.71 A: to be fixing up the house 

602.82 605.48 A: so i mean i'm sure i'm sure the satisfaction would be there but 

603.06 604.41 B: that's a valid point 

605.84 607.29 B: oh yeah it definitely is 

606.51 606.82 A: yeah 

607.45 607.87 A: yeah 

608.18 611.54 B: especially if you see where you know where it came what we started with 

612.76 617.04 B: kind of a fixer upper and they didn't call it a handyman's special but it could have been called that 

614.30 614.57 A: right 

617.20 617.92 A: right right 

619.33 621.78 B: and you know just like i i think there's kind of a 

621.93 622.72 B: (( )) 

623.41 627.63 B: when you start because i don't usually have all the ideas i need i just start off and then 

628.34 631.12 B: things kind of evolve and they kind of reveal themselves 

631.22 631.81 B: to you 

632.02 632.44 A: hm mhm 

632.49 633.74 B: in a weird kind of way 

634.02 634.72 A: right right 

634.88 637.52 B: it's not like i sit down and plan everything and then just 

638.24 639.06 B: carry through 

639.53 642.86 B: it's like after you do one thing you decide what your next step is going to be 

643.07 643.82 A: right right 

644.66 646.09 A: so what what do you do now 

647.19 648.27 B: i work for doctors 

648.69 649.09 A: ok 

649.31 650.86 B: yeah i do a lot with insurance 

651.15 651.47 A: hm mhm 

651.23 652.34 B: um billing and 

654.02 656.29 B: accounts receivable and insurance 

656.57 657.99 B: i didn't i didn't stay with art 

661.40 667.35 B: it was just a lot of fun i just took every art course the college had to offer and just kept going and you know never got a degree in it 

667.60 668.27 A: right right 

669.92 671.75 B: wanted some time to go to work 

672.41 673.81 B: i was like okay what can you do 

674.38 677.82 B: well i had done this kind of thing since i was about six- sixteen 

678.24 680.08 B: so it was easy just to you know go back to it 

681.18 682.31 B: with experience 

683.18 686.99 B: you know how the uh the world is they they want you to be experienced at something 

687.24 687.60 A: hm mhm 

689.02 690.01 B: so that's what i do 

691.13 692.66 B: and it's not real exciting but 

693.63 694.61 B: it's a job 

694.81 695.45 A: yeah yeah
