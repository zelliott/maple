0.48 2.20 A: hi my name is kelly 

1.79 3.34 B: and i'm claveen 

3.14 4.51 A: (( hi claveen how are you )) 

4.18 5.28 B: good how are you 

5.18 6.50 A: good 

6.57 8.87 B: um yes so 

8.92 11.35 B: you're supposed to talk about this topic now [mn] right 

10.77 19.29 A: [laughter] right um so do you agree that a cold would le- would be qu- be done quicker if you go to the doctor or no [mn] 

18.93 22.95 B: i don't know i just recovered from a cold right now and uh 

21.86 22.65 A: okay 

23.04 30.68 B: i didn't go to a doctor i didn't get the flu shot in fact i just i i'm usually hesitant of all this 

30.80 38.81 B: um this whole medicine thing itself so i usually avoid and i believe that i'm pretty robust so i don't really fall sick so often 

33.23 34.28 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

38.91 44.40 B: and so my strategy is do nothing [laughter] 

41.84 43.12 A: okay [laughter] 

43.28 46.33 A: do you use any over the counter medications or anything like that or 

46.13 51.70 B: very little very little i i avoid as much as possible because i have this 

47.08 47.87 A: oh 

51.76 54.63 B: idea that this whole um 

55.60 62.64 B: introducing these unnatural chemicals in your body is not a good thing [mn] for the most part unless you are really [mn] um 

58.95 59.88 A: oh 

63.03 71.59 B: you really are in a position that you can't help it so i i usually it's not that i have got anything against science or medicine it's just that i usually avoid 

71.40 72.35 A: okay 

72.06 73.92 B: (( so that is what i do what about you )) 

73.92 84.20 A: okay okay i agree with you [laughter] it seems like um every time i go to the doctor for the flu or a cold or anything they only tell you drink fluids and [laughter] stay in bed anyway 

82.53 83.46 B: right 

83.80 84.78 B: right 

84.19 91.78 A: so i don't really feel that they help too much and i guess i believe more in i kinda grew up with the whole home remedy 

86.99 88.13 B: right 

91.71 99.46 A: and i've as as i've gotten older i've gotten more into the holistic healing kinds of things where i i like to be more natural 

95.66 96.95 B: right 

98.98 100.02 B: right 

99.41 111.13 A: than i do end up sometimes with my cold and sinus [laughter] if it just gets to be too much 'cause i and i've gotten sick more the last couple of years because i work full time and i've started school full time 

102.89 104.02 B: mhm 

104.97 106.14 B: (( right )) 

110.72 111.75 B: mhm 

111.16 114.08 A: so i have a lot of stress and i don't get enough sleep as i should 

113.83 115.04 B: right 

114.34 121.72 A: but um yeah i've gotten the flu shot in the past but i haven't gotten it the last couple of years and i haven't gotten anything major so 

119.04 119.89 B: right 

121.48 122.57 B: right 

121.98 129.51 A: i'd have to say that i agree with you that i'd like to keep things more natural and but i do agree that the changing seasons does affect you somehow [laughter] mhm 

125.94 126.78 B: right 

129.22 139.72 B: right it does i mean i just got last week i had i was actually not at all good for the last like four days and it i i'm a little obstinate about it i guess i could have 

135.63 136.52 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

139.52 154.05 B: uh taken medicine earlier but i just refused to and because i think in in time it anyway goes away and ultimately the natural things like drinking a lot of fluids and drinking like tea and stuff like that i like that 

145.61 146.54 A: mhm 

153.76 154.63 A: yeah 

153.99 154.97 B: (( so )) 

155.52 160.17 B: that is usually my fix to it but maybe i mean is the question more general than just things like colds 

160.40 161.43 B: (( or )) 

162.49 168.26 A: um well i know they had brought up the cold they also talked about you know the changing seasons and that kinda thing so 

166.60 170.16 B: right right right so they want us to talk okay 

170.14 171.15 A: yeah 

170.30 171.37 B: um 

171.44 179.65 A: um do you now do you ever get that seasonal disorder where when you get less sunlight you seem to be more tired and do you have a hard time with the change of seasons 

178.99 180.74 B: no no do you 

180.45 187.04 A: yeah i have a very hard time with that for the first month or so it's i only want to sleep and i kinda get a little depressed too 

187.17 188.17 B: (( hm )) 

187.57 199.41 A: so yeah that one that one's a rough one on me so even if i don't get sick i do get very tired and kind of hard for me to function when i go to work at in the dark and come home in the dark [laughter] [laughter] seems like and 

196.50 197.96 B: [laughter] 

199.21 204.23 A: seems like the days get so short that you're ready for bed at six o'clock at night [laughter] because it's pitch black 

202.70 208.63 B: right right i i haven't felt that and i don't know if the doctor can fix that 

204.45 205.48 A: yeah 

208.06 217.90 A: no i've seen ads for you know like the those special lights or something like that but i guess i kinda just try to deal with it on my own and [laughter] 

212.63 213.60 B: right 

216.10 216.69 B: (( [mn] )) 

217.10 221.28 B: well these are like really heavy lights on your desk so you feel that there was day 

221.87 223.23 A: i'm sorry what was that 

222.69 226.95 B: now these are really powerful lights that'll make you feel that there was a day outside 

226.35 231.10 A: oh yeah yeah [mn] i'm like oh yeah i don't think a light's going to do that [laughter] 

227.16 228.45 B: [laughter] 

230.21 232.84 B: [mn] sounds strange actually i 

231.80 238.06 A: yeah what do you think about um doctors and medication and stuff for more major ill- illnesses though other than colds 

238.37 240.64 B: i have a really strange 

240.88 242.53 B: theory about that because 

242.71 246.53 B: um you heard about the placebo effect right 

246.53 247.76 A: (( mm mm no )) 

247.50 249.53 B: which is basically what they do is 

249.99 251.07 B: um 

251.09 262.89 B: so you fall ill so instead of giving you a drug i give you basically a harm a harmless substance basically something which has neutral effect on you okay 

262.11 262.92 A: okay 

263.08 272.57 B: and if you feel that this is the right drug and this will cure you it cures you okay this effect is the placebo effect now of course it doesn't work one hundred percent of times because then 

272.58 286.06 B: medicine will be used less but there have been lots of studies scientific studies and we they've found that thirty percent of the time you could give this inert substance and it'll produce the same effect as the drug would 

285.29 286.45 A: (( oh mhm mm )) 

286.66 295.64 B: and what that says basically is a lot of um the healing that happens is basically psychological you feel you feel like you're getting better therefore you get better 

292.45 293.29 A: okay 

295.42 296.58 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

296.41 297.40 B: so 

297.96 303.57 B: i think a lot of medicine actually works like that i mean a lot of it is in your head i think so 

303.19 304.30 A: yeah 

304.77 314.69 B: so i i don't know i mean i don't think medicine in itself is such a developed science i mean they don't really have uh very good models i mean the drugs that they give you when you fall sick it's just because they've done 

314.70 324.10 B: collected some statistics and correlations they don't tell you why something lowers your body temperature they know that it does because for six out of ten people it does 

316.34 317.15 A: mhm 

324.40 325.31 B: right 

325.43 326.43 B: (( so )) 

327.11 331.20 B: so i don't have a whole lot of strong belief in medicine as a science 

331.25 332.16 A: (( mhm okay )) 

331.51 336.94 B: so anyway i i don't know if this is what you meant what your question was trying to 

336.06 338.27 A: oh yeah yeah that that's what i meant 

338.02 339.04 B: right 

338.42 341.91 A: yeah yeah that's 'cause i i have the same feelings as you 

341.87 346.19 A: and um i actually i had gotten bronchitis really bad a couple of years ago 

346.14 358.97 A: and i actually ended up in the emergency room because i was given so many different kinds of antibiotics to try and get rid of it that i actually ended up the emergency room doctor kinda his theory was that i had actually gotten poisoned by the antibiotics 

358.60 359.67 B: (( [laughter] )) 

359.17 365.88 A: so i ended being in the emergency room and i kinda so that's when i stopped going to doctors altogether and just try to go to a holistic healer 

365.67 366.66 B: right 

366.02 367.69 A: but then um 

367.92 380.70 A: last year my father had a heart attack and um a friend of mine knows my beliefs that i don't really like doctors and they're like well if these doctors hadn't made these advances your father wouldn't have survived his heart attack which that's true too 

380.35 382.17 B: right 

380.87 385.26 A: so i suppose in a way and for certain things i believe in the medicine 

385.35 398.71 A: and that kinda thing but as far as some issues i think you know the whole holistic and the you know w- eastern medicine is a lot better than [laughter] just everybody just wants to pop a pill 

395.64 397.17 B: right right 

398.75 404.57 B: right that is that is true but what exactly is the kind of medicine you're talking about 

399.02 399.92 A: so 

404.10 409.83 A: um well like more like herbs and you know even just meditation and reiki healing 

406.57 407.51 B: right 

409.45 410.55 B: right 

409.92 413.60 A: you know going to that kind of thing that's the kind of stuff that i would rather do 

413.46 414.69 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

414.10 421.77 A: as opposed to you know taking these pills that i mean they got a pill for everything now and there's so many side effects and [laughter] 

419.21 419.78 B: (( [mn] )) 

420.86 423.06 B: (( [mn] right right [cough] )) 

423.03 424.01 A: so 

425.12 434.17 A: yeah so i don't kn- i don't know what [laughter] what we can do [laughter] it seems like they're just the pharma- pharmacies are out to make a quick buck and feed you any kind of pill [laughter] 

434.10 439.17 B: yeah i guess the it's it's all just business for some people 

438.67 443.70 A: yeah yeah i don't know if i necessarily trust that they do enough testing or anything for some of these [laughter] mhm 

443.24 445.68 B: right and and see the thing is it's 

445.79 448.76 B: uh the science it's a strange science right because i mean 

449.08 456.87 B: medicine is not so developed they really don't know why these things work okay the only thing they know is they go and like 

452.29 453.19 A: mhm 

457.23 463.43 B: basically first test these on like to begin with a new drug is basically tested on animals right and this 

462.16 463.35 A: mhm mhm 

463.55 473.79 B: let's see what it does and based on that they and based on a little bit of knowledge about what are the chemicals that are involved they make some predictions that this will do this thing on human beings and then they test on people 

473.42 474.33 A: mhm 

474.02 480.82 B: and that's it and then they give it to lots of people and ask you because you're one of the data points for them in some sense 

480.41 481.31 A: right 

480.64 492.95 B: and they go through this data from hospital records and stuff like that and then they figure out the correlations and that's all th- there is i mean they really don't know why it's not really fine so so so one of the things that happens is 

493.46 494.45 B: um 

494.85 508.41 B: somehow people think that a doctor is not scientific then some of these holistic methods that you're saying because they they're not really like good a good science right they're they're 

502.63 503.41 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

506.29 507.19 A: mhm 

509.14 511.49 B: (( they're not as scientific as the [mn] )) 

511.91 514.91 B: the whole western medicine system right 

515.39 520.90 B: i i doubt that whole thing and doubt that whole idea is more scientific or less scientific than that because 

520.20 521.12 A: mhm 

521.53 522.63 B: um 

525.18 526.67 B: i don't know i 

527.44 533.61 B: (( i don't know maybe but we we're we're actually philosophy of science i guess [laughter] )) 

531.50 535.67 A: yeah [laughter] i know i think we got a way off the subject a little bit [laughter] 

535.49 542.39 B: do they tell us when uh when we are done or is this uh we can just keep talking until we feel that we've exhausted the subject 

541.75 549.33 A: [mn] [laughter] well i think we have to go for at least ten minutes so i think they might tell us when we're done this is the first one i've done so far so 

546.39 547.53 B: (( okay )) 

548.67 550.24 B: (( okay this is my first as )) 

550.01 554.13 A: oh okay okay so we're learning together [laughter] 

550.72 551.71 B: (( well [mn] )) 

552.38 561.68 B: [laughter] well it is a strange thing i mean i'm okay let's let's stick to the topic [laughter] so 

559.07 561.29 A: okay [laughter] 

562.11 573.71 B: (( well why don't you tell me some like experiences like when you fell ill or you went to the doctor or in fact this holistic medicine when you fell ill and you went to one of these people and how how that worked or didn't work )) 

573.24 577.38 A: oh okay um well actually i ended up meeting a spiritual healer 

577.02 578.15 B: mhm 

577.53 592.39 A: um through kinda through a friend who went to her because she also does massages and that kind of thing and um i started having like reiki treatments where they kinda just use energy and they lay their hands on you and kinda like try to take the bad energy off and put it up back into the universe 

588.47 589.54 B: mhm 

591.47 593.12 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

592.49 598.04 A: and i know it sounds kinda silly but i believe in it and it works for me so i guess that's all that really matters 

597.44 598.82 B: right right 

598.09 606.21 A: um but i've i went on a trip with her and while we were we were driving we played a tape about a women who had gone and stayed with the aborigines 

606.11 607.22 B: right 

606.38 617.79 A: and she was saying about their they have all the holistic healing and one aborigine on this walk had broken his leg and they they did what they do to fix it and he was fixed with and the next day he got up and walked again 

617.56 618.66 B: wow 

618.06 626.73 A: and they don't know hospitals they don't know what what casts are they don't know what x rays are and i mean the healing process that they have is totally different 

622.26 623.21 B: right 

626.73 638.58 A: and i think that you know the holistic the people who do the holistic like the shaman and the native americans and and all that i mean it's in almost every different region in every different kind of culture and religion 

632.93 634.13 B: right 

638.14 639.13 B: right 

638.51 647.79 A: and i mean they have their beliefs and they use all natural things from the earth and i really think that's what heals us and makes us better as opposed to you know 

647.98 654.18 A: the scientific medicines so i've had really good luck with going and having herbs and that kind of thing done 

653.74 655.18 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

654.56 659.60 A: so and like i said i mean after one experience where a doctor put me into a hospital [laughter] 

659.00 660.38 B: right right 

659.52 674.01 A: i thought well this can't be right [laughter] this can't be good at all and then i was upset too because after i was in the emergency room they couldn't really give me an exact answer and i had been there all night long and i was exhausted and you know obviously not feeling well 

661.31 662.79 B: [laughter] 

673.56 674.56 B: right 

673.97 683.22 A: and they really couldn't give me a straight honest answer and then till someone finally came and said well i think you you know because antibiotics are poison i think you were poisoned by 'em 

683.69 688.31 A: so yeah it's a rough thing with the whole health issue and illness and 

686.99 687.96 B: (( mm )) 

688.00 689.12 B: right 

688.45 696.23 A: but i i grew up with um a grandma who believed heavily in in home remedies so [laughter] so i did that one but 

693.29 694.56 B: right 

697.12 699.33 B: so i mean uh 

699.41 703.99 B: do most insurance plans cover for this treatment at all i mean you 

703.15 706.25 A: none that i know of every time i go i pay for it out of pocket 

705.30 706.96 B: (( have to pay mm )) 

706.27 707.45 A: yeah 

707.91 715.63 B: mm that is a that is a problem with actually following i mean there are many problems one is first of all this kind of 

715.86 718.19 B: (( other alternative method )) 

718.32 719.96 B: really they don't have a
