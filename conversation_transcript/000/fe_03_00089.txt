5.62 6.54 A: (( hello it's ))

10.65 11.53 B: good 

11.98 12.80 A: ah 

12.58 16.56 B: so reality shows do you watch those 

16.18 25.27 A: i actually don't watch much t._v. so it was kind of ah um a topic that i wasn't so prepared to talk about [laughter] but 

24.10 31.97 B: actually i i i don't watch them either because i don't watch t._v. much either but i used to um 

32.13 39.28 B: i remember seeing some of them when i was younger [laughter] and i know a lot of people who watch them 

36.16 39.39 A: (( [laughter] )) 

39.59 46.97 A: but only i have watched a couple of shows one i i think i have watched one or two episodes of survivor 

39.68 41.13 B: yeah 

47.00 47.91 B: (( uh-huh )) 

47.01 49.01 A: and then 

49.42 51.89 A: a different version of millionaire 

52.00 53.13 A: um 

52.29 53.31 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

53.47 64.04 A: not who wants to be a millionaire i think oh well i guess i have watched the other one who wants to be a millionaire i don't think that classifies as reality t._v. do you 

64.47 66.47 A: that's more like a quiz program 

67.05 76.93 B: mm um i i guess so um more yeah like survivor ones are more of what they're talking about i think 

71.11 76.90 A: right right right 

77.19 79.36 B: but i it's 

79.57 83.90 B: always been so strange to me that people get really hooked 

83.78 86.41 A: (( yeah )) 

84.12 88.50 B: into um you know i think it gives them a sense of um 

89.04 92.84 B: [lipsmack] people always want a peak into other people's lives [laughter] 

92.16 103.95 A: well also i think it might be ah the fact that it feels like participating in it in the way they're sort of glamorizing and putting a whole set and having a 

97.82 99.84 B: yeah yeah 

104.25 116.77 A: well arranged story it's more like bringing that down to the level of everyday life where people see um errors people see i mean funniness clumsiness 

110.08 111.38 B: yeah 

116.69 120.97 A: (( and i guess that )) 

116.92 118.02 B: yeah 

118.47 129.77 B: social social relationships and with these shows it's usually set in like extreme cases and i think it's that part of it that's 

121.00 123.19 A: right 

126.89 129.13 A: (( yeah a- )) 

129.79 134.95 B: because we a lot of people have such normal lives that 

129.82 134.07 A: (( right )) 

135.07 137.23 A: (( yeah )) 

135.28 137.07 B: you know they get 

137.40 139.34 B: into yeah 

138.39 142.75 A: it it's the same sense of ah i mean needing the 

142.83 149.77 A: element of surprise or in the newspaper the element of scandal [laughter] 

147.88 158.09 B: yeah i think what when it it used to be like when people used to read documentaries and things like that and with the t._v. age 

150.16 154.39 A: (( yeah )) 

156.57 160.53 A: (( mhm )) 

158.06 164.96 B: and people don't read anymore and this is this is it [laughter] yeah 

163.02 168.83 A: yeah that's that's ah a good ah way of looking at it as well um 

168.76 173.68 A: to me it seems um part of it is also related to 

173.61 179.76 A: um provoking people to do things i mean they try to put people in very ah 

176.44 177.39 B: (( uh-huh )) 

179.62 191.93 A: sensational scenarios like throw something that really [mn] creates a response or a a knee jerk reaction which tests their ah automatic impulses 

181.50 182.52 B: yeah 

191.68 192.98 B: mhm 

192.37 201.32 A: ah not something you can sit back and prime and think about and then respond it's more trying to get people to react quickly [mn] 

197.79 199.26 B: yeah yeah 

200.80 206.42 B: and then every every week you wonder what's going on and you have to watch [laughter] 

201.46 204.05 A: (( yeah )) 

205.39 212.17 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

207.22 219.47 B: but there's always the when there's those shows there's two sides to it there's the audience and there's people who really want to participate in these things and [mn] some exposure 

215.04 217.83 A: (( yeah )) 

219.45 223.19 B: ah element [laughter] of wanting to 

223.27 228.42 B: really be in public in a way because there's always cameras 

228.53 230.25 B: tons of cameras 

230.28 237.38 B: that's following you around in your bedroom or when you're showering everywhere yeah 

230.42 236.54 A: (( yeah right )) 

237.08 244.30 A: well there was one that i had read about in newspaper i think it was put on by some channel in u._k. 

244.47 247.75 A: it was about oh no sorry i think it was on a web cam 

247.77 257.22 A: ah this person had basically fixed ah cameras all over in in his house which was [cough] being streamed on the web 

257.27 260.41 B: mhm mhm yeah yeah 

257.38 263.90 A: twenty four hours seven days a week [laughter] what kind of life would that be [laughter] 

260.97 262.03 B: and when 

262.84 270.89 B: and i think when he went to work or he went to the bathroom he'd put some object in front of the camera [laughter] 

269.66 272.94 A: [laughter] 

271.54 275.95 B: or there there was a woman who used to do it and 

276.20 279.83 B: um you know [mn] twenty four hours basically 

279.84 280.88 A: yeah 

280.23 281.30 B: yeah 

281.07 288.46 A: do do you know who actually started this i mean which show can you think of as the harbinger of this stuff 

285.80 286.97 B: um 

288.25 293.00 B: the earlier one that i can remember is m._t._v. 

293.33 300.07 A: right oh i see i haven't seen any of those 

294.13 297.62 B: ah when they started doing the real world 

298.97 305.32 B: do you remember that i think i remember watching it that was in the late eighties 

304.93 305.82 A: uh-huh 

305.67 307.10 B: and 

305.86 308.71 A: wh what was it about 

308.07 310.25 B: it was uh these 

310.39 315.28 B: they got about seven people i think ah got ah a 

312.82 316.11 A: uh-huh mhm 

315.51 318.36 B: loft to live in in new york 

318.96 322.87 B: and got different young people together to live together 

322.81 323.74 A: i see 

323.44 324.77 B: yeah 

324.98 327.55 A: and this was for a period of ah 

327.67 328.65 A: (( like )) 

327.82 334.73 B: about ah i'm not sure more than half a month i think maybe almost a year 

332.82 333.90 A: i see 

334.88 341.10 A: and and was there anything common between these people did they have a particular taste of music or something which 

340.59 345.19 B: ah no i think they took different people from different fields 

345.46 346.48 A: i see 

345.71 347.72 B: but just one was a model 

348.39 351.82 B: the other one was a dancer one was a poet 

349.65 350.69 A: mhm 

351.20 354.05 A: (( mhm )) 

352.07 354.99 B: i think one was ah maybe a musician 

355.07 362.47 B: and different people but around the same age and then all these you know different friendships 

356.15 362.16 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

362.70 363.78 B: um 

363.93 368.58 B: [lipsmack] fighting romance starts to [laughter] come in 

364.81 371.59 A: mhm so it seems like these people were all ah mostly from arts 

371.86 378.42 A: people with ah high levels of creativity and emotion probably [laughter] 

372.54 373.57 B: yeah 

376.25 382.70 B: yeah and it was m._t._v. driven which means it's probably the pop culture 

382.39 383.28 A: uh-huh 

382.82 385.93 B: the younger generation 

385.74 386.98 A: (( yeah )) 

386.19 387.19 B: yeah 

387.80 389.29 A: i mean i have 

389.58 396.10 A: it's it's beginning to catch up in other countries as well i had seen some shows in india as 

396.32 401.56 A: well where they had something similar not quite 

396.59 397.52 B: (( mm )) 

399.95 401.95 B: are you from india or 

401.59 415.33 A: yes i am i i i've been here for a long while i whenever i visit i tend to see one or two episodes or a little bit of t._v. so at that time i had noticed that ah i mean things in u._s. influence 

402.48 403.50 B: yeah 

405.02 406.10 B: yeah 

415.71 422.17 A: or the media anyway influences the everywhere else quite quickly [laughter] 

416.46 419.08 B: ah yeah yeah 

421.10 426.22 B: yeah i'm from japan but it's the media japan 

424.04 425.41 A: which country 

425.88 426.97 A: oh i see 

426.63 429.54 B: and the media really takes over 

429.79 436.19 B: people's lives and they now they started having maybe ten years ago 

430.35 434.44 A: mhm 

436.43 438.46 B: you know dating online 

438.29 439.21 A: uh-huh 

438.60 444.64 B: or and then actually the the other person is not a real person 

444.60 446.33 A: i see so 

444.74 448.00 B: so this is the opposite and you 

448.44 456.16 B: i don't know how they did it but you have a relationship with somebody which is actually not real 

456.19 461.71 A: what do you mean i mean so are the two are not on the show at the same time 

456.49 457.63 B: and 

460.96 467.94 B: they they go online and they have a they have a relationship and they 

467.97 482.88 B: these people it was mostly males who were getting into this and they called them their girlfriends basically and it was a strange thing and they were interviewed and they 

471.34 472.21 A: uh-huh 

476.77 478.13 A: i see 

483.19 486.33 B: they said they don't really want real 

486.68 492.29 B: relationships like they don't want a real person because you can't control it 

491.76 495.34 A: right and it's also complicated [laughter] sometimes 

492.30 493.42 B: [laughter] 

494.10 495.27 B: [laughter] 

496.34 500.93 A: that's funny i never thought about that [laughter] 

499.22 505.20 B: but when it gets out of hand like that it begins to become ah a 

505.54 507.61 B: very strange sickness 

507.61 509.13 A: yeah 

507.76 511.09 B: of not being able to be in the real world 

511.16 512.50 B: (( you know and it's )) 

513.25 515.66 B: yeah [laughter] 

513.48 517.86 A: mhm so is other i mean the t._v. [mn] 

517.91 523.97 A: that you see in japan episodes and serials are they very similar to u._s. or is there more 

524.01 527.23 A: i mean are there different uh-huh 

524.47 527.52 B: it's got a different ah the 

527.61 531.06 B: it's different taste through it maybe it's a little 

531.42 534.13 B: a little sillier a little 

534.35 536.63 B: um less censored 

537.27 541.51 B: and there used to be in japan when i remember when i was very young 

540.38 542.42 A: (( mhm )) 

541.70 544.40 B: ah these broadcasts of 

544.66 550.86 B: um almost like competitions but they go through all these harsh conditions 

551.12 552.56 A: i see 

551.14 552.93 B: to be the winner 

552.89 553.80 A: oh 

553.19 559.21 B: so it's similar and they they would create these tents that would heat up to 

559.75 561.95 B: (( ah so hot then whoever )) 

560.06 561.01 A: (( so )) 

562.66 567.62 B: stays inside the longest [laughter] ah gets elected 

565.51 571.31 A: this is more like a physical physical endurance or a physical test and things like that 

569.21 577.47 B: yeah it goes through the you know they go through the ocean they go they take different sides 

572.19 576.71 A: (( mhm )) 

577.74 579.15 B: yeah 

579.09 584.42 A: and ah did you say there's more censor- censorship or less censorship 

584.07 586.17 B: there's less censorship 

586.00 586.95 A: i see 

586.74 587.86 B: yeah 

587.30 595.65 A: that's interesting but wouldn't ah because of the traditions isn't japan more conservative that there would be some self censorship as well 

595.93 600.86 B: in media it's i think it's because they're 

601.00 604.44 B: so constrained maybe in 

602.23 605.80 A: (( mhm )) 

604.81 607.32 B: the real personal 

607.62 612.92 B: (( level that these [mn] medias and )) 

610.50 617.16 A: (( mhm )) 

613.17 614.75 B: comic books there 

615.02 620.19 B: ah start to take over and they want to play out their fantasies 

620.19 621.62 A: (( ah )) 

620.32 622.58 B: within what they see 

622.37 623.43 A: okay 

623.08 629.09 B: and now i don't know at this stage everything is very crazy over there 

628.91 630.06 A: right 

629.34 634.70 B: so ah you know more people killing each other and [laughter] 

630.61 632.09 A: i i 

634.72 648.18 A: yeah i think i can relate to that because in india too they make a lot of movies and it's actually um it's popular because ah mostly it's an escape from reality 

648.09 649.09 B: yeah 

648.25 652.07 A: for ah for most people especially for people 

651.96 657.51 A: who just don't make enough money to at- attain material wealth or live in comfort they 

656.68 658.04 B: yeah 

657.38 672.06 A: they go to these movies and they are totally transformed or taken into a different world where they can live out their fantasy and meet these ah ah people i mean actors and actresses who are of course handsome and glorious and gorgeous and all 

660.85 662.07 B: mhm 

662.19 663.35 B: mhm 

664.97 666.00 B: yeah 

670.46 671.92 B: yeah 

672.74 682.12 B: so there's a ca- a paradox there you know they call them reality shows but it's for everyone else to escape reality [laughter] yeah 

672.87 674.55 A: (( that )) 

676.11 680.32 A: (( yeah )) 

681.43 688.27 A: [laughter] that that's i think a good way of putting it [laughter] 

686.74 687.73 B: yeah 

688.58 691.11 B: (( well if this yeah go ahead )) 

688.79 690.30 A: well so 

690.93 692.62 A: no go ahead 

692.42 699.35 B: no i was going to say that that you i people begin to act differently when they are on camera 

699.55 701.46 A: yeah 

700.05 703.89 B: which is ah another interesting 

704.00 704.78 A: (( well )) 

704.15 705.41 B: aspect 

704.94 718.58 A: i i guess it depends on how ah people are brought up ah like in the u._s. ah kids are allowed to be very extrovert so they tend to be ah very easy in front of the camera 

715.16 716.08 B: yeah 

718.49 719.63 B: mhm 

718.59 719.89 A: or or
