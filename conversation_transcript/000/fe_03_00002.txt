45.58 45.96 B: right 

45.63 46.36 A: then that's

73.53 74.13 A: yeah 

74.83 76.58 A: what what kind of foods do you like to cook 

77.18 78.76 B: lately i'm going through a roasting 

79.63 81.29 B: phase where i'm roasting everything 

82.29 82.81 B: um 

82.93 84.58 B: i i basically eat

218.48 219.17 B: experimental 

221.27 222.70 B: but uh i'd like to try 

223.15 224.93 B: uh i just never seem to get around to it 

225.63 225.98 A: yeah 

227.15 228.19 B: it always seems like 

229.70 231.44 B: i don't have that much time 

232.21 233.23 A: yeah it has to be a hobby 

233.52 234.00 B: yeah 

234.87 235.51 B: and um 

235.10 237.20 A: and then when you run out of time for hobbies then 

238.07 238.53 B: yeah 

239.74 241.83 B: lately i've found myself like i know that 

242.04 244.52 B: you were saying you'd rather eat out what al- i what i find 

244.78 246.74 B: i do a lot is i buy the uh 

247.49 249.51 B: kind of guy like i guess you'd call it a uh um 

251.68 252.80 B: grocery store opened up 

256.18 256.64 A: uh huh 

258.31 259.63 B: buying that a lot 

260.51 261.87 B: um when i don't feel like cooking 

262.73 264.56 A: oh that's nice probably cheaper than going out 

264.55 270.96 B: it's cheaper than going yeah it's like the kind of like a combination you get the the the speed of not you know the the 

271.09 275.14 B: well the good thing is you don't have to cook and it's not as expensive 

276.14 276.65 B: um 

276.16 276.50 A: yeah 

277.84 280.06 B: you know uh that's that's what i 

280.23 280.97 B: i just can't 

281.49 283.38 B: like i know you know from from from 

283.50 287.69 B: doing all the food shopping and everything i know what things cost and i just it just 

289.38 293.21 B: i i don't think i'm cheap but it really bothers me 

294.00 301.70 B: to you know pay that amount of money just to have somebody cook the food which is something i don't really mind doing and you know a couple of dishes that i don't mind either 

302.33 302.88 A: yeah 

303.24 304.74 A: yeah it's definitely expensive 

304.88 305.31 B: you know 

305.50 312.23 B: and uh i never feel like i get in i'm i mean like i guess depending on the type of restaurant i always feel like um uh you know 

313.14 315.15 B: kind of leaving slightly hungry too 

315.80 316.43 A: oh 

316.07 317.97 B: i'm a little bit of a picky eater 

318.38 318.90 A: mhm 

318.92 320.22 B: so um 

320.91 322.24 B: you know i find that 

322.79 324.51 B: like the the portions are not 

325.05 327.99 B: a portions of sor- i shouldn't say portions of everything 

328.29 331.25 B: portions of certain things are not like what what 

331.85 332.21 B: what 

332.57 333.21 B: what i would 

333.33 334.39 B: put on my own plate 

335.28 338.04 A: yeah i have that problem too one of my favorite restaurants 

338.46 339.22 A: um that 

339.34 340.57 A: in the neighborhood i work in 

341.73 345.81 A: i almost never go there because they have the smallest portions even when i get the big 

345.91 348.74 A: lunch meal that has all the sides i still leave hungry 

348.97 350.72 B: yeah and that really um 

350.85 354.93 B: yeah that th- i mean that bothers me more than anything else about going out 

357.42 360.32 B: um but uh you know i i you know i figure i'm also just 

365.76 367.72 A: there must some good restaurants in 

367.51 368.41 B: in philadelphia 

367.94 368.60 A: philadelphia 

368.72 370.12 B: yeah there are some um 

370.43 374.61 B: there are some nice ones uh depending on what you like we we have a big uh 

375.73 378.01 B: uh big chinatown and uh 

379.11 382.87 B: there's a lot of yeah there are a lot of restaurants in philadelphia now now that you mention it 

383.71 384.23 B: um 

384.56 386.00 B: i actually live on uh 

386.64 388.06 B: live in university city 

389.21 390.79 B: so there aren't that many 

391.41 393.90 B: decent restaurants there but there are a couple 

394.23 394.78 B: um 

395.16 397.07 B: fortunately a lot of them are bring your own 

398.91 401.49 B: alcohol so you can bring your own bottle of wine or whatever 

401.98 402.37 A: yeah 

402.01 403.58 B: which helps to cut down on the 

404.97 405.57 B: price 

406.46 407.68 A: yeah now 

407.79 409.01 A: see i don't drink alcohol 

408.92 410.23 B: oh okay there yeah 

409.81 413.14 A: so going out to eat is never as expensive for me as it is for a lot of people 

413.19 413.65 B: yeah 

415.27 416.80 B: yeah i mean i don't yeah pardon 

415.53 415.93 A: but g- 

417.00 417.54 B: i'm sorry 

417.37 419.24 A: i was just going to say that i but i do have kids 

419.56 420.18 A: and so 

419.59 420.10 B: okay 

420.42 422.80 A: going out to eat has lost a lot of it's appeal 

422.52 423.69 B: yeah i can imagine 

423.75 425.96 A: cause it's not relaxing 

424.01 424.42 B: um 

426.05 427.00 B: yeah 

427.69 429.76 B: i know my my brother just came out from 

431.37 431.70 B: -giving 

435.06 435.76 B: fly out 

436.78 442.10 B: on thanksgiving day in the morning and you now leave on saturday it's just i was like oh my god 

442.43 443.10 A: he's crazy 

443.17 445.90 B: yeah you know um 

446.13 448.43 B: it's really it's got to be really hard but they have 

448.94 450.60 B: i don't know how old your children are but 

450.85 451.85 B: he got this uh 

453.00 457.29 B: portable d._v._d. player that is just it's incredible the way that the kids um 

458.54 459.66 A: oh that's nice 

459.81 461.10 B: yeah i mean 

460.84 462.49 A: yeah that that would do it 

461.37 461.75 B: it's 

462.92 466.52 B: eh he said it's amazing like on a plane or um 

468.07 468.57 B: uh 

469.01 469.43 B: you know 

469.81 471.14 B: on the plane it's incredible 

471.99 479.40 B: that they just sit down and watch it and he said you know he's looking around he's like other kids are like looking through the seats trying to watch it too 

472.39 472.93 A: wow 

479.95 483.07 B: and as long as you you know keep those movies in 

484.08 484.80 B: uh 

485.19 485.82 B: they uh 

487.24 489.79 B: they just quiet down they don't cry and they 

492.54 493.69 A: yeah that seems like a 

493.89 494.53 A: good method 

494.89 496.98 B: yeah which is a far cry from 

501.30 502.89 A: yeah 

503.84 504.42 A: yeah 

503.91 504.31 B: um 

505.07 505.35 B: but 

506.99 507.73 B: yeah it's uh 

509.06 513.90 B: i guess yeah in general though i guess i know my my wife says you know that i never will go out to a restaurant 

514.11 517.17 B: so i guess i don't probably don't go out as much as i might say but 

518.24 518.61 B: um 

521.19 522.25 B: but yeah i guess uh 

523.26 523.77 B: difficult 

524.57 524.93 A: we um 

524.85 532.12 B: i have a hard i use to i use to eat out a lot and i i i i found that i i really bothered me at the end of the month you know if you pay with a credit card 

535.04 541.59 B: it doesn't seem to seem that much at the time but at the end maybe i you know at the end of the month it's just it's just awful when you see these 

542.45 542.95 A: yeah 

542.99 543.91 B: bills pile up 

543.20 544.14 A: yeah it adds up 

544.17 545.40 B: it adds up (( )) 

546.07 547.03 A: yeah 

547.55 550.42 B: kind of hard i don't how are the restaurants in pittsburgh 

551.26 552.74 A: we haven't found too many 

552.89 554.37 A: good ones here we moved here 

554.49 555.70 A: about two and a half years ago 

556.73 557.35 A: and 

557.75 559.27 A: i'd say there's four or five 

559.39 560.21 A: that i like a lot 

561.37 561.86 A: but 

562.36 566.72 A: for how big the city is compared to other places i've lived they don't have a lot of good restaurants 

567.08 567.44 B: huh 

567.89 569.84 B: now is it pittsburgh do they make that 

570.15 572.71 B: that uh that sandwich where they put everything on it 

573.17 574.07 A: yeah that's the one 

574.29 575.36 B: what's that called 

575.55 576.70 A: it's called primanti brothers 

576.72 577.65 B: primanti brothers 

578.10 580.37 A: yeah and the purpose of it was the truckers 

580.49 581.26 A: were going through 

581.63 584.69 A: and wanted to be able to take their food to go and eat with one hand 

585.14 588.14 A: so they put the french fries and the coleslaw on the sandwich 

589.68 592.92 A: so that's a classic place whenever someone comes to visit we like to take 'em there 

592.92 593.35 B: okay 

593.02 593.56 A: although i don't 

594.19 595.45 A: but you should see 'em make 'em 

595.99 600.56 A: and this is another thing about eating out you can really if you work in a restaurant you can really 

596.21 596.50 B: i 

599.62 601.82 B: yeah i have yeah 

602.43 603.14 B: you know 

603.47 606.84 B: the thirty second rule or you know i mean yeah yeah 

607.50 608.99 B: right and i know sometimes 

608.46 608.97 A: yeah 

609.17 610.45 B: when you're there you know people 

610.84 615.82 B: send it back they want to send something back and i you know you might not want to send it back 

616.16 617.47 A: it might come back 

617.68 621.52 B: you know you don't know what you don't know what's going to happen to it back there you know i mean 

621.91 623.63 A: oh that's true 

624.43 627.13 B: that's interesting though i didn't know that that that's how it started from 

624.57 625.24 A: that's true 

630.25 630.84 B: football game 

631.44 632.12 A: oh 

632.61 636.08 B: when the game happens to be in pittsburgh you know they always do those little 

636.94 638.25 B: they do segues 

639.46 639.99 B: uh 

640.86 643.81 B: before they break for commercials and they show it i always found it 

644.38 644.91 A: oh 

645.93 648.90 A: yeah they just pile it on but i don't like it very much because the 

649.24 651.22 A: the potatoes seem to soak up all the flavor 

651.40 652.48 B: oh okay 

652.63 655.33 A: so it just kind of takes away from the flavor of the sandwich 

655.48 655.87 B: mhm 

656.49 656.83 B: hm 

657.46 658.13 A: so i wouldn't 

658.78 661.37 A: they they put um french fries on salads here too 

661.55 662.06 B: they do 

662.44 665.07 A: yes and one of our favorite restaurants they have a pittsburgh sandwich 

665.53 667.10 A: and they have steak or chicken 

665.61 666.17 B: okay 

667.48 667.94 B: uh huh 

667.48 669.00 A: on the salad and french fries 

669.19 669.67 B: huh 

670.74 671.71 B: that's interesting 

671.94 672.43 A: yeah 

672.29 675.31 B: yeah they don't they don't do that here in philadelphia 

676.04 677.31 B: where did you live before pittsburgh 

677.92 678.94 A: we lived in utah 

678.05 678.43 B: you (( )) 

678.96 680.03 B: in utah well 

679.88 680.24 A: yeah 

680.97 681.31 B: okay 

681.95 684.46 A: so it's a big change not as much mexican food here 

684.98 687.35 B: yeah i would imagine hardly any 

687.66 688.25 B: um 

687.85 688.41 A: yeah 

688.44 689.55 B: compared to i know that 

690.13 691.03 B: i'm assuming that 

691.15 696.34 B: that utah's probably similar to colorado and the mexican food there is actually like quite authentic and 

697.46 697.86 A: yeah 

697.54 700.74 B: here it's at least here in philadelphia it's really not 

701.69 703.51 A: yeah the farther west you go the more
