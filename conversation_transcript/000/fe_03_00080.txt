7.08 8.27 A: fine thanks 

8.13 9.03 B: that's good 

9.19 10.86 B: do you watch any reality t._v. 

11.43 13.86 A: um sometimes i do yeah do you 

13.69 15.73 B: i don't really i 

15.85 19.24 B: i don't know i'm kind of an old sitcom freak so i watch 

18.79 19.93 A: okay 

19.45 21.04 B: more like cheers and 

21.65 24.81 B: you know ah the simpsons and stuff like that 

24.91 25.19 B: but 

25.68 27.85 B: not so much the reality shows 

28.29 30.33 B: i guess i have enough reality 

28.52 28.99 A: okay 

32.24 33.69 B: what about you which ones do you watch 

32.67 32.97 A: um 

43.26 47.10 A: college life even though i'm a little bit older than that but um 

44.14 44.61 B: yeah 

47.38 49.59 A: so i watch like a lot of the m._t._v. 

49.83 50.44 B: yeah 

49.99 52.41 A: reality shows that are like the osbournes 

50.89 52.27 B: like the real world 

52.50 57.09 B: oh and now the osbournes yeah i don't watch it but i really enjoy hearing about it 

52.65 53.27 A: ah 

57.26 58.51 A: yeah 

57.33 64.94 B: i have friends who watch it and they come in like all happy every time there's a new episode and it's fun to hear them talk about it i like 

62.85 63.30 A: yeah it's 

65.15 65.54 B: yeah 

65.96 66.77 A: it's pretty funny 

66.96 67.79 B: okay 

67.92 71.94 A: um so i watch that one and the real world sometimes that's also on m._t._v. 

72.03 72.61 B: mhm 

73.07 73.75 A: um 

74.42 77.84 A: but i was trying to think of like why people like certain reality shows 

78.63 81.42 A: and not others and i think it's because they really get involved 

81.70 82.60 A: with the characters 

83.48 84.81 B: yeah i think you're right 

85.00 90.01 B: they they can probably feel like a stronger connection believing that those are real people rather than just 

90.70 91.81 B: more characters 

92.00 97.78 A: exactly and the other example i was thinking of is the anna nicole show that's on the e. station 

92.68 93.45 B: you know yeah 

97.06 97.53 B: oh 

97.68 98.43 B: yeah 

98.64 100.53 A: and it's not popular at all and i think 

100.67 103.39 A: it's just because she's not likeable and people don't like her 

103.75 105.81 B: right yeah that makes sense 

106.00 106.51 A: mhm 

106.96 112.64 B: yeah i think also like with reality t._v. people can imagine themselves more easily 

112.83 113.53 B: being 

114.25 115.22 B: a part of that 

115.59 116.30 B: you know like 

116.49 123.28 B: if if you're really randomly picked then oh that could be me i could be famous too like that or i could be interesting too like that 

123.76 124.44 A: exactly 

124.55 126.48 B: you know it seems kind of like it's more it 

126.61 128.46 B: it's closer to the viewers somehow 

132.54 136.24 A: there are some that like are kind of like lifestyle shows that i would agree with that but then 

136.50 136.90 B: um 

136.59 139.49 A: when you think of ones like who wants to marry a millionaire like that 

139.62 140.75 A: is i think people are just 

141.16 145.63 A: so curious as to what kind of people would actually put themselves in that kind of situation 

146.21 153.15 B: that really reassures me because i've been really worried about that so like i really fear for our society with 

153.26 165.07 B: that show being acceptable to the main stream audience you know to me it's like it's the middle ages didn't we stop selling brides a long time ago like i don't know it like yeah that was 

157.94 159.58 A: but i don't know if it was acceptable 

162.38 163.30 A: i know 

165.99 168.51 B: yeah you think it's not acceptable to our society 

170.20 172.09 B: oh good 

170.94 177.09 A: people watched it because it was just like a freak show you know what i mean and people were just curious but 

174.72 175.40 B: okay 

177.29 179.84 A: i i didn't meet one person who thought that it was 

181.24 182.30 B: like okay 

181.30 182.81 A: an acceptable kind of thing 

182.95 188.05 B: okay yeah -cause i thought it was so weird i mean i saw one thing on like i think 

188.25 192.24 B: fox news they where they were interviewing um 

189.50 189.99 A: mhm 

192.69 193.72 B: some (( )) 

193.83 197.74 B: from maybe mademoiselle magazine or elle magazine or something like that 

198.28 201.38 B: who had a particular opinion about the 

201.86 205.01 B: marrying a millionaire show and she said people watch it just because 

205.66 207.18 B: um they're curious about 

207.75 208.96 B: how to get married 

209.73 217.98 B: like they're curious about the courtship process and and that women are really watching this show to figure out how to get a husband and i was like 

218.60 219.06 A: wow 

221.87 223.28 A: well that is pretty scary 

226.04 226.40 A: yeah 

227.80 231.98 B: please like my boobs better kiss me more you know like what is that 

229.90 230.39 A: oh 

230.64 231.37 A: oh yeah 

232.55 234.42 A: yeah in that sense it's really scary 

234.70 236.06 B: yeah yeah i don- 

235.34 238.88 A: cause it totally takes away anything that should be important in a relationship 

239.59 240.61 B: yeah i mean there's 

241.28 243.42 B: the getting to know each other process is 

243.96 244.70 B: already 

245.22 247.12 B: a competition and a comparison 

247.56 249.74 B: and like when that happens in real life 

250.37 251.34 B: because 

252.01 255.67 B: you meet two people that you really like at the same time and that you don't know what to do 

256.10 256.50 B: to me 

256.61 257.55 B: that's one thing 

257.67 258.63 B: you know that's like 

259.11 260.12 B: a real reason 

260.48 265.20 B: to have that situation but when you falsely produce that situation on a regular basis 

265.94 268.32 B: in favor of the man choosing the woman again 

268.81 275.66 B: maybe maybe i'm just mad because it's not you know three grooms fighting for a bride i don't know but like 

275.24 276.61 A: but on the flip side of that 

276.73 280.01 A: i think all the women wanted to be on that show because they thought 

280.24 280.66 A: that that 

280.88 282.15 A: loser was a millionaire 

283.17 284.04 B: okay 

284.46 285.40 A: you know what i mean 

285.53 289.63 A: so what are the women thinking that they're willing to put themselves in that situation 

285.71 286.28 B: yeah 

289.71 290.32 B: mhm 

290.59 291.31 A: for money 

290.63 291.32 B: that kind of 

291.76 293.56 B: yeah that kind of goes with like um 

293.87 297.48 B: my boyfriend works in a big engineering firm 

297.90 298.31 A: mhm 

305.16 305.71 B: because 

306.31 311.90 B: all these engineers you know are going through these horrible divorces and they're all male engineers and they're 

312.09 314.79 B: wives are leaving them and taking them for all they've got 

315.62 316.27 B: and 

316.68 322.31 B: then he's got this one friend of his who's like fifty and divorced and i'm like twenty six 

320.69 321.07 A: uh-huh 

322.42 327.35 B: and in school and so most of my friends are anywhere from like twenty two to 

327.56 335.81 B: thirty or forty you know but so his friend says to him oh well your girlfriend is still in school maybe she could hook me up with a hot university chick 

329.26 330.02 A: right right 

335.98 337.50 B: tell her i'm a rich engineer 

338.37 339.10 B: and i was like 

339.72 350.77 B: and they wonder why they're getting divorced they wonder why things aren't working that's what you base your relationships on is well i'm a rich engineer i have earning power come love me you know like 

341.96 343.62 A: oh my god 

348.17 348.56 A: right 

350.28 350.79 A: that's right 

351.04 352.38 B: what is that 

352.61 358.90 B: yeah so i mean i don't know like to me like those all those mentalities i guess are kind of going back to the whole 

359.55 360.41 B: like whether or not 

361.04 361.52 B: we want 

365.79 368.48 B: what other reality shows have you seen 

369.95 370.85 A: um 

371.46 375.00 A: well the real world is an interesting concept i don't know if you have 

375.11 376.04 A: you're familiar with it 

375.82 379.04 B: yeah i used to i watched it more when i was in undergrad 

379.18 379.59 B: and 

379.24 379.77 A: okay 

379.80 381.34 B: and i just haven't seen it much since 

380.10 380.53 A: (( )) 

381.89 383.04 A: yeah i think it's it's 

383.25 388.80 A: the same kind of concept that they have now but i think that they're really hand-picking these 

389.40 390.65 A: people and and 

390.77 391.49 A: setting them up 

391.67 392.51 A: so that certain 

392.97 394.31 A: things occur 

394.20 394.83 B: uh-huh 

394.41 399.53 A: so that's kind of funny too that you know you think you're watching a reality based t._v. show show but 

399.69 401.36 A: all the situations are kind of set up 

402.34 402.68 A: the 

402.50 403.30 B: wow 

403.23 406.21 A: there would be certain conflicts between the people and 

408.02 409.74 B: yeah i guess i see what you mean 

409.89 410.43 A: mhm 

410.69 412.39 B: there's a show that um 

410.72 411.04 A: so 

412.54 413.32 B: is like 

413.56 417.64 B: i think inspired by the real world in france now called the loft 

417.95 418.41 A: okay 

418.40 419.27 B: and it's like this 

419.42 423.17 B: it's like a combination of the real world and survivor because 

423.44 423.88 B: um 

424.02 426.99 B: on the loft like i think people get voted off of the show 

427.39 427.88 A: okay 

428.00 429.33 B: too gradually i'm not 

429.53 433.28 B: sure how it all works but it's huge in france too and like i 

433.52 436.01 B: thought that was kind of interesting too because 

436.21 442.05 B: you know like so much in the whole world forum we hear that it's the americans that are just bubble gum and candy brained 

442.22 449.84 B: you know and like that we just sit around and watch silly t._v. and aren't intellectual and all that stuff and this show is 

442.48 443.33 A: right 

450.50 454.73 B: like pretty much identical to all the reality t._v. shows we have here and it 

454.99 457.80 B: is like number one in france all the time 

457.56 462.58 A: wow yeah an even some of the ones that we have are based on ones from like holland and i think from 

458.08 458.97 B: and i was like oh 

462.36 463.26 B: okay 

462.76 463.22 A: britain 

463.78 465.42 B: oh okay i didn't know that 

465.61 468.96 A: i forget what the the one about the house is called but that one is 

466.87 467.20 B: um 

469.06 471.61 A: directly based on one that was from holland it started there 

472.52 473.66 B: oh wow 

474.28 478.93 A: there's one on t._v. i saw just the other day it's called the great race or something like that 

479.38 480.60 A: don't remember exactly but 

480.36 480.72 B: oh 

480.82 485.86 A: it's you can tell it's (( )) by kodak because the people have all these things to do and they have to take pictures with kodak cameras 

485.88 487.14 B: okay 

486.52 487.04 A: but it 

487.14 490.81 A: it's so stressful to watch i have to turn it off because 

490.20 490.93 B: really 

491.30 496.98 A: yeah you're just worried about all these people getting through the race you're just worried about them all getting through the race 

492.44 494.26 B: why what made it stressful 

497.06 498.26 B: oh okay 

497.87 502.99 A: and whose going to win and it was causing me too much anxiety i couldn't watch it anymore 

502.12 503.25 B: oh yeah that makes sense 

503.60 504.09 A: mhm 

504.32 504.92 B: oh wow 

505.05 506.06 B: oh do you have two phones 

507.01 509.57 A: yeah i was just going to say i can get the other one in a minute when this 

507.60 508.01 B: ugh 

509.33 509.72 B: ugh 

509.81 515.19 A: ten minutes is over its got to be over pretty soon 

509.83 511.59 B: that's cool okay 

512.22 514.23 B: yeah i think so 

515.29 518.14 A: so do a lot of people you know watch reality shows 

515.37 515.93 B: wow 

518.43 520.02 B: well i think that um 

520.63 525.69 B: yeah i have friends in the french department at my school who watch 

525.86 529.86 B: the osbournes religiously like they adore the osbournes 

528.08 528.49 A: okay 

530.11 530.70 B: and 

530.42 530.72 A: right 

531.24 532.55 B: that could be because 

532.66 533.75 B: they've picked such 

534.33 534.96 B: you know like 

535.09 535.78 B: speaking of 

536.01 538.63 B: picking personalities that are going to make this interesting 

539.47 542.52 B: you know like it's so it's such a strange 

542.95 546.97 B: you know mix for really famous people to pretend to be a normal family 

547.21 549.16 B: oh wait are they a normal family 

549.29 556.07 B: wait dad's brain-dead the kids need to look after dad now you know like what's going on you know like it's i guess it's 

549.53 549.86 A: right 

556.30 560.79 B: it is if you're going to pick a random family to just sit around and watch well they're pretty interesting one 

560.98 561.50 B: because 

561.32 561.59 A: yeah 

562.13 563.83 B: they have a stable marriage but 

564.42 567.61 B: um he's still been really famous and 

568.25 569.20 B: you know like 

569.43 571.77 B: so they kind of embody family values and 

571.90 575.14 B: biting bats' heads off all at the same time 

574.18 577.38 A: exactly it's like they're so weird and abnormal 

577.48 578.78 A: but they're so likeable 

579.03 579.59 B: yeah 

580.34 580.74 A: yeah 

580.97 584.34 B: yeah i saw an interview with ozzy osbourne and sharon osbourne 

584.75 585.15 A: mhm 

584.89 590.90 B: at like three in the morning the other night when i couldn't sleep and it was just on like c._n._n. or something 

591.17 591.58 B: and 

591.92 599.65 B: it's true by like twenty minutes in to the interview i was like i don't want to go to bed now this is really interesting 

597.89 598.54 A: i know 

599.78 600.43 B: and then 

600.61 602.63 B: it's true they're both really likeable 

602.85 606.97 B: i mean ozzy osbourne sat there talking about how he's really not that great a guy and he's 

603.15 603.40 A: yeah 

607.44 616.04 B: really lucky to have such a nice wife to make sure everything is okay and and that he's really pretty much just a big emotional basket case but his family helps him through it and 

616.56 619.17 B: you know i was like wow how honest can you get like 

619.21 619.58 A: yeah 

619.79 622.12 B: and yeah they were all just totally likeable 

622.80 624.79 B: and yeah i bet that's the whole deal 

624.97 627.83 B: like you said the reality t._v. is a question of 

628.61 630.61 B: us connecting and liking the people 

630.86 631.83 A: yeah exactly 

633.38 634.43 B: wow that's pretty cool 

635.45 636.06 B: yeah so
