254.64 255.04 A: uh-huh 

254.91 256.05 B: kind of a rush thing 

256.39 256.77 A: yeah

257.61 257.97 A: yeah that 

259.15 259.80 A: yeah it 

259.91 261.47 A: it can be i i 

261.66 265.59 A: but living here in quebec i i've also heard the other side 

265.69 267.00 A: i mean you know the 

267.25 267.87 A: the people that 

268.28 272.65 A: cut down trees for a living aren't necessarily the the most um 

273.17 274.07 A: well spoken 

274.23 275.60 A: people you ever want to meet 

275.68 276.13 B: uh-huh 

276.28 276.72 B: uh-huh 

277.79 279.73 A: learned a lot of uh cuss words 

279.87 281.87 B: oh really 

280.71 281.23 A: yeah 

284.98 288.32 A: in a quebec french all the cuss words have to do with the church 

289.53 291.56 B: oh 

291.90 293.84 B: that's funny 

293.25 295.23 A: yeah so um 

295.35 296.61 A: things like uh 

297.50 301.67 A: words like sacred and tabernacle and chalice 

302.22 303.61 A: are cuss words 

303.88 304.55 B: really 

304.44 313.21 A: yeah it's kind of funny i mean i can hear them and i know okay this person is cussing but it doesn't really effect me emotionally because i didn't grow up 

313.39 314.23 A: you know with the language 

314.71 315.22 B: okay 

315.36 316.19 A: it's a it's a real 

316.62 318.25 A: it's kind of funny to 

318.79 319.97 A: to listen to people as they 

320.11 322.58 A: you know i should be insulted but i'm not 

325.21 325.61 B: well 

325.73 326.92 B: what do you think is 

327.07 331.66 B: is the appeal of reality t._v. cause there must tha- i think there's a lot of people who do watch 

331.81 335.11 A: yeah i think there's a lot of people that just don't have a real life 

335.41 338.50 B: that's it huh 

337.44 340.00 A: so they have to watch somebody else's life 

339.89 342.53 B: that's a good theory 

343.72 348.01 B: they're watching because they don't have a life of their own 

347.17 347.64 A: mhm 

351.66 353.13 A: i'm i'm sorry for them but 

353.51 354.09 A: i mean you 

355.16 356.16 A: if you want a life you have to 

356.89 357.66 A: up and (( )) 

357.19 357.58 B: get out 

357.76 359.39 A: leave the television and go 

359.51 361.77 B: true leave the television off 

364.19 366.70 B: that's a good point i cause i you know i heard about 

367.57 369.83 B: the numbers of people who are watching 

370.20 372.91 B: survivor and the bachelor and i was always amazed at that 

373.32 373.68 A: hmm 

373.59 374.64 B: wondering why 

374.75 375.79 B: the appeal didn't 

376.27 377.44 B: doesn't appeal to me at all 

378.52 380.26 B: and the idea of watching a guy 

380.44 384.94 B: choose an end with the bachelor i think it starts off with a much higher number than three 

385.18 385.55 A: mhm 

385.47 387.39 B: and he works his way down you know 

387.69 388.29 B: like wow 

389.03 389.61 B: i just 

390.26 391.49 B: not appealing to me 

391.67 394.62 A: no i mean it's so humiliating for all the women that aren't chosen 

394.26 394.76 B: yes 

394.90 395.85 B: yes it is 

395.77 397.29 A: and then the one that is chosen is 

398.96 399.93 A: been bought or some- 

400.68 401.22 B: mhm 

404.24 406.79 B: kind of a strange way to enter into a marriage 

404.36 404.69 A: and a 

407.19 408.02 A: yeah 

408.23 408.65 A: really 

409.79 411.29 A: go out to the market 

412.16 413.75 A: put yourself on the auction block 

413.89 415.09 B: yeah 

417.51 420.52 A: yeah but but it is kind of hard you know to have a real life 

420.92 421.88 A: which (( )) 

422.02 426.25 A: part of the reason i came to quebec cause it just wasn't working for me back in kansas 

426.55 427.22 B: is that right 

427.32 427.85 A: yeah 

428.19 429.00 B: do you like it there 

429.40 430.20 A: yeah i love it here 

431.21 433.30 A: but people talk to each other (( )) 

433.07 433.96 B: oh that's great 

434.17 437.23 A: yeah li- like last night well i joined this choir 

437.85 438.34 A: and 

438.78 442.36 A: we had a concert last night and after the concert we all went to a restaurant 

442.54 443.36 A: and ate together 

444.21 444.56 A: not 

444.80 447.73 A: i'm not sure this would actually happen in the states maybe it would but 

448.07 455.48 A: but anyway it happened here we went to this restaurant and we we were there for like two hours sitting around the table talking and chatting and laughing and 

455.64 460.07 A: and just enjoying each others company after having worked so hard to put on the concert 

461.41 463.01 A: and i don't know (( )) 

463.16 464.89 A: that's real life to me 

464.71 465.19 B: that is 

467.60 468.73 A: and the other night 

468.84 472.34 A: i went to a meeting and after the meeting we went to dunkin donuts for 

472.52 473.26 A: coffee and 

473.47 474.80 A: coffee and donuts 

475.08 475.80 A: and 

476.49 479.21 A: when we got there there were people sitting at the next table 

479.38 479.65 A: like 

480.01 482.16 A: a group of four or six people talking to each other 

483.13 486.71 A: we sat down we talked for a good hour maybe hour and a half 

486.99 489.00 A: and we got up the other people were still there 

489.30 490.60 A: still having their conversation 

490.94 494.32 A: and the whole dunkin donut was full of people having conversation 

495.37 496.39 A: and i think wow 

496.88 501.43 A: this is human society this is where it takes place 

498.72 499.28 B: yeah 

499.50 499.94 B: yeah 

501.88 504.14 A: i could never quite figure out in topeka kansas 

504.32 504.90 A: where 

505.40 506.98 A: human society was going on 

507.93 511.26 A: and no one cared to clue me in on that neither so 

511.58 513.44 A: and i was there for twenty five years 

513.65 514.41 A: pretty frustrating 

514.70 515.48 B: really 

515.62 517.19 A: yeah i raised my kids 

517.34 520.37 A: there sent them to this rural school which was 

520.73 521.62 A: well it was good 

522.10 529.67 A: it was a good school and they got a good education but whenever i went out to the school for a concert or something i never knew any of the other parents 

523.48 523.92 B: mhm 

530.00 532.04 A: there was no way to meet the other parents 

530.76 531.19 B: sad 

532.14 532.73 B: yeah 

533.13 534.76 A: and so it was 

535.03 536.88 A: real i just always felt disconnected 

540.13 542.21 A: how's wisconsin for social life 

543.68 546.48 B: uh somewhat similar to that i think 

547.85 549.17 B: uh when you were talking about 

549.49 550.72 B: going to kids' ko- 

552.87 554.03 B: parents that not knowing them 

554.17 554.59 A: mhm 

554.78 556.75 B: that certainly felt familiar to me 

557.51 560.55 B: um i guess but there's other areas of my life that are 

560.65 561.98 B: that are um
