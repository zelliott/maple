52.39 53.29 A: right 

54.50 55.14 A: right 

56.12 56.71 A: yeah 

57.33 59.33 A: i would have to say morally 

60.41 65.81 B: morally gossiping is the easy one because it has direct direct moral result i guess 

62.12 62.80 A: yeah 

63.61 65.57 A: (( )) 

65.89 66.57 A: right 

66.75 67.63 A: right 

67.10 68.48 B: is that a baby there with you 

68.76 73.75 A: um th- well he is two and a half 

71.53 72.85 B: oh 

73.98 74.49 A: um 

75.28 77.46 A: yeah i would say gossiping for sure 

77.96 78.58 A: um 

79.29 83.76 B: on the other hand you know what counts as gossiping a lot of gossiping doesn't hurt anybody 

84.87 85.64 A: true 

85.97 86.62 A: um 

88.97 94.19 B: i think that term actually sounds a lot worse than it is now that i think of it i spoke very quickly 

89.06 89.72 A: yeah (( )) 

94.44 99.62 A: yeah it's it's true i mean when people hear the word gossip they think 

100.66 104.92 A: people saying bad things about somebody else who isn't in the room and 

104.13 104.86 B: right but 

105.08 108.77 B: gossiping also includes saying true things about other people 

107.50 108.56 A: exactly 

108.80 110.29 A: exactly and it 

110.45 112.06 A: and it might not necessarily 

112.18 113.50 A: be a bad thing 

113.68 115.41 A: i mean you can say 

116.59 116.98 A: you know 

117.25 121.34 A: did you hear mr and mrs smith are having a baby and 

120.95 121.47 B: right 

121.68 122.11 A: you know 

122.23 123.38 A: does that technically 

123.51 126.35 A: you know it depends on your personal definition of gossip i guess 

126.47 128.87 A: but i suppose according to 

129.46 130.78 A: society 

131.03 132.73 B: so were there just four things just 

133.17 134.40 A: let's see smoking 

135.18 136.35 A: drinking 

136.52 139.58 A: alcohol or caffeine excessively 

139.76 141.66 A: was eating excessively one of them 

141.70 143.21 B: uh i don't remember 

143.28 143.80 A: mommy 

143.93 146.09 A: stay you're o._k. sweet pea 

146.72 147.43 A: um 

148.75 150.23 A: not exercising 

151.23 151.57 A: i guess 

152.07 153.34 A: personally 

154.71 158.57 B: i'm trying to think how drinking caffeine to excess could possibly 

154.76 155.24 A: w- 

159.27 159.85 B: um 

160.38 161.52 B: injure anyone 

162.24 165.43 B: except yourself and even that is a stretch 

166.71 167.34 A: yeah 

169.25 172.97 A: well and what's the question again (( )) which one is the worst 

170.62 170.92 B: i'm 

172.46 175.18 B: which one is worse yes which is the worst 

175.36 176.36 A: eee 

175.91 177.87 B: and they didn't define bad so 

179.15 180.19 A: yeah um 

181.15 183.23 A: i mean for me i 

185.15 190.23 A: i'm a pretty healthy person you know we work out every day my husband and i and 

190.57 191.11 A: (( now )) 

191.49 194.01 A: even the kids are starting to get in to you know we 

194.62 195.55 A: dance and stuff 

195.56 196.00 B: right 

195.73 199.37 A: so if i didn't work out it would be really hard for me but 

200.06 208.10 A: and i don't drink caffeine and i don't drink alcohol and i don't smoke 

206.58 209.53 B: yes but what do you think of people who do 

208.81 210.68 A: um 

212.41 213.63 A: i have 

213.87 215.33 A: i have a hard time 

217.21 217.61 A: with 

218.98 224.18 A: let's see if i had to look at all of them i think people who drink probably 

225.24 225.53 A: w- 

225.68 227.44 A: will end up getting to me 

227.61 230.52 A: quicker than anyone else i mean i don't like people who 

230.93 234.58 A: it's not like i don't like the people who smoke i understand that it's hard 

234.85 235.90 A: for some people to quit 

236.29 237.73 A: for me i don't understand 

238.88 244.06 A: especially in today's day and age with all the education out there why people even start smoking 

244.92 247.73 A: you know to me it's like o._k. you are twenty years old today and 

247.83 249.21 A: and you decide to 

249.46 249.81 A: take 

250.14 253.03 B: actually they start when they are about fifteen 

252.60 256.01 A: yeah but even that at like today at fifteen 

256.37 256.91 A: i 

257.40 258.74 A: eee you know i just i don't 

259.58 263.39 A: why do you even start and part of that is my own problem 

264.05 265.85 A: i don't seem to have a v- an ad- 

266.13 268.02 A: addicting personality to things 

268.15 269.19 A: you know i 

268.23 268.77 B: hm 

270.27 271.06 A: you know i just 

272.28 273.65 A: i drank a couple times 

273.90 276.19 A: when i was younger and it was like yeah whatever 

276.41 280.79 A: just didn't interest me (( )) 

279.69 282.57 B: well my son explained to me exactly how addicting 

281.14 282.00 A: (( )) 

282.71 288.51 B: caffeine was he has quit and he was just fooling around smoking other people's cigarettes 

287.99 289.94 A: uh-huh 

289.08 289.41 B: but 

289.65 295.46 B: um it became a habit for him very quickly and you know 

291.84 292.80 A: oh 

293.32 294.06 A: sure 

295.66 296.34 B: um 

297.00 301.36 B: it was it was not easy for him to quit he told me you know first time 

301.69 310.76 B: he got high smoking first time i ever had a drag on a cigarette i just coughed and i wasn't interested in another one and i knew it was bad at the time 

311.22 313.10 B: and i was just doing it to 

313.54 315.10 B: get a reaction out of other people 

315.29 316.12 A: right 

315.58 318.83 B: you know typical adolescent um behavior 

318.56 320.14 A: right 

320.72 321.32 B: um 

321.55 321.91 B: but

325.66 326.97 B: second one is o._k. 

327.08 330.85 B: and the third one didn't do do anything for him but he had to have a fourth one 

331.17 331.63 B: you know 

331.17 332.75 A: right oh 

331.86 334.46 B: it's that addicting which sounds to me 

334.75 336.15 B: approximately as addicting 

336.38 336.89 B: as 

337.17 337.96 B: as heroin

405.84 406.96 A: i 

407.63 417.24 A: i mean besides obviously all the other things going through your mind making sure the kid is healthy it was so hard for me to not do anything 

417.34 418.14 B: oh i bet 

418.08 419.91 A: oh and 

418.65 419.15 B: i bet

426.43 427.01 A: um 

429.28 429.53 B: (( )) 

429.64 430.74 B: (( )) about twenty times 

431.59 436.71 A: yeah but yeah for me 

436.98 437.53 A: i guess 

439.31 441.27 A: i've just seen too many people 

442.96 444.83 A: you know personally 

445.41 446.55 A: have y- you know m- 

446.78 448.78 A: major major 

448.90 451.89 A: life altering problems with alcohol 

451.75 452.21 B: yeah 

452.42 452.83 A: that 

453.68 455.28 A: you if somebody smokes 

456.26 456.90 A: (( )) 

457.41 460.71 A: everybody i know who does smoke you know if they are going to come over to our house 

460.82 465.96 A: they they go outside on the porch if they want a cigarette you know they people are pretty considerate 

465.64 469.13 B: right things have really changed in the past twenty or thirty years 

466.89 467.86 A: yeah 

468.84 471.16 A: yeah definitely um 

471.73 472.38 B: because people 

472.82 475.07 B: twenty twenty years ago would assume that 

475.41 478.84 B: you would find an ashtray for them if they wanted to smoke in your house 

478.41 486.57 A: sure sure i remember um being little and my mom putting ashtrays out for guests when they would come over 

485.87 490.54 B: i remember my mom putting cigarettes out for guests when they would come over 

490.24 495.38 A: that's just so funny you know it's just so foreign to me and um 

496.30 498.52 A: and and the same with drinking you know 

499.28 505.34 A: it was never in our house but i remember going to other people's homes and they always had beer in the fridge 

505.73 509.55 A: you know in case somebody came over yeah for a guest or something 

506.58 507.54 B: for guests 

508.56 512.11 B: well gee i keep beer in the fridge for my kids 

511.19 513.89 A: but you know i mean eee 

516.11 517.40 A: i don't have a problem with 

517.52 520.86 A: people who you know have a beer once in a while it's 

520.37 520.96 B: right 

521.06 521.87 A: you know 

522.84 523.62 A: the p- 

523.03 526.45 B: no i think you're right drinking to excess is probably the worst 

526.62 527.09 B: thing 

527.47 528.49 A: yeah and 

528.05 529.86 B: for an individual and their 

530.08 533.02 B: and their family because it it messes up your 

531.12 531.73 A: right 

533.23 535.32 B: behavior as well as your life span 

535.35 537.40 A: right right and 

537.53 540.20 A: you know drinking and driving obviously you know 

540.55 541.13 B: right 

540.82 549.99 A: killing somebody in an accident (( if )) somebody smokes a whole pack of cigarettes and then drives their car they're not going to kill somebody right right 

546.31 548.55 B: right the potential consequences 

548.77 551.84 B: you know of that are worse than the 

551.66 552.51 A: yeah 

552.05 554.80 B: potential consequences of smoking 

554.75 555.58 A: right
