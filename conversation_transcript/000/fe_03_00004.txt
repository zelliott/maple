25.12 25.80 A: but 

26.01 28.15 B: i like eating at home too it's just 

28.80 32.78 B: the cooking part an- cleaning up more more than that 

29.73 36.90 A: yeah i was going to say but typically i i like eating out at a restaurant because of yeah it's a treat to have stuff brought to you 

33.60 34.04 B: uh 

37.91 41.96 A: and it's usually stuff different than i would make for myself an- 

41.77 42.33 B: mhm 

43.15 44.28 A: i think so 

43.95 45.18 B: pretty simple cook but

58.09 58.94 A: hum 

59.59 61.90 A: yeah that would be difficult 

63.35 63.91 B: -eah 

63.40 64.32 A: yeah 

64.12 64.86 B: but it's 

65.07 65.61 B: that's

67.69 68.39 B: what about you 

68.77 69.28 A: i 

69.42 70.39 A: think well 

70.59 71.74 A: i kind of

78.36 80.48 A: nearby that's really authentic and really good 

81.09 81.93 A: um 

83.46 84.32 A: high on the list 

85.25 87.29 A: other than that 

86.67 88.92 B: i'm in california and we think mexican is 

89.34 89.68 B: kind of 

90.22 91.52 B: commonplace like i can 

91.64 95.53 B: (( )) got like a million good restaurants (( )) that's around 

91.71 92.42 A: yeah 

94.04 95.85 A: yeah that's everywhere and anywhere 

95.69 96.74 B: yeah 

96.88 97.20 A: oh

99.87 101.30 A: um 

102.07 104.71 A: yeah i don't know well i eat mainly vegetarian so 

105.47 108.96 A: that kind of limits or changes things but 

109.30 110.55 B: good for you but i can't 

110.86 112.04 B: to to make myself 

112.22 116.58 B: go there especially -cause my husband won't 

114.21 117.44 A: oh yeah that could be difficult my uh 

117.83 120.07 A: family -s just been forced in to it 

122.16 126.54 B: and even with my husband's heart condition he is not forced yet at this point 

126.24 127.03 A: oh 

126.75 128.41 B: not feeling forced 

128.07 128.93 A: yeah 

129.06 129.76 A: not yet 

130.19 131.85 B: i guess well i guess since his 

132.79 135.34 B: doctor was happy with his cholesterol the last time that 

136.19 137.51 B: tested recently so 

137.24 137.73 A: mhm 

138.73 144.43 B: it seems like they're controlling it with medication and so i don't think he's motivated about his diet 

144.27 147.32 A: yeah that would be hard if you know it's okay an- 

145.38 146.09 B: too fat 

147.60 148.53 B: yeah but it's like 

149.13 152.75 B: so it means in general he is not that motivated about it so i (( )) 

151.31 152.31 A: yeah 

152.57 154.44 A: huh well that could be difficult 

154.17 154.85 B: yeah 

158.91 166.50 B: i don't know what are we suppo- it's like hm yes yeah um 

160.08 162.81 A: i know i'm li- is this the first time you're done this

176.53 177.16 B: yeah 

176.71 178.42 A: supposed to be natural an- 

179.79 183.01 A: or is it the test of how long you can go without ah 

183.38 186.76 A: trying to figure out what you're supposed to be talking about an- 

188.95 189.49 B: give it -n

191.37 191.89 B: voice rec- 

192.11 192.98 B: -nition it's 

193.56 195.51 B: i i mean at some level i assume it's 

195.71 196.24 B: whether 

197.23 201.81 B: it can figure out what we're talking about and i don't know 

199.08 199.77 A: yeah 

201.94 204.05 B: you know if if the subject is food 

204.51 212.38 B: how much well we talk about basics- how much you get or or whether that that clue is it i don't know

219.13 219.59 A: uh-huh 

219.88 222.46 B: um he's been working with voice recognition 

223.98 227.43 B: software or whatever for a long while and he sent me an email and said 

227.82 228.72 B: you know 

229.60 236.54 B: pass it on you want to participate and so i i think probably you know then i've sent it to my friends and 

230.42 231.00 A: yeah 

237.00 239.46 B: i imagine some of them have sent it along so it's just

244.93 245.68 B: eh figure 

246.34 246.76 B: among 

248.05 257.77 B: among those i would spread it to alone we should be able to create enough people to to do the whole study because my friend sent out so many emails 

254.07 255.28 A: yeah i get it 

256.99 260.45 A: yeah and then they pass it on to each about ten people an- 

258.08 258.66 B: yeah
