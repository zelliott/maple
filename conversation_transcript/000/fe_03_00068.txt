56.07 61.35 A: the most uh stigmatized also i mean possibly possibly over eating as as well but 

61.60 63.34 A: smoking is just you get so many 

63.93 65.67 A: so many signals throughout your life 

66.08 68.81 A: about you know how awful a habit it is and 

68.96 70.98 A: and you know people that smoke 

71.08 72.34 A: when you're around them you just 

72.58 73.10 A: you know 

73.77 80.75 A: it's hard for you to breathe or you know the smell stays on your clothing and it it's just not a situation a good situation for anyone 

80.54 90.66 B: yeah and i think it's just really completely habit forming whereas um a lot of those um habits it seems like they're easier to stop i mean with eating you can (( )) 

83.57 84.21 A: mhm 

88.47 93.53 A: yeah i mean not exercising like you can start exercising at any time it's not like 

91.87 92.33 B: mhm 

93.90 94.70 A: really uh 

94.97 96.23 A: an incapability 

96.49 103.90 B: yeah an- and it's it's just so hard because people you know try to cold turkey then nicotine patches you name it an- and you know they still can't 

96.69 98.38 A: for most people 

104.03 107.22 B: stop smoking and and it's it's uh 

104.31 104.91 A: mhm 

108.23 113.95 B: it's a dangerous thing for just even the environment the people around them children 

109.82 110.43 A: mhm 

112.04 112.61 A: right 

114.45 114.86 A: right 

114.48 117.97 B: e- especially themselves and um i 

118.31 122.96 B: i try to tell my friends to quit smoking but it's not working (( )) 

122.23 122.93 A: yeah 

123.50 124.86 B: it's 

125.62 127.33 B: it's a lost cause for me 

130.55 130.93 A: some 

131.16 137.26 A: you know quit for two or three months at a time and i get really proud of them and try to encourage them and then next time i see them they'll 

137.35 139.78 A: they'll say oh you know that didn't last long 

139.89 140.33 A: so 

141.39 142.11 B: yeah it's a 

141.45 142.12 A: it's kind of 

142.65 147.13 B: it's i don't know there's something in it that's just completely habit forming 

147.41 147.97 A: mhm 

147.73 148.08 B: (( )) 

148.38 149.95 B: it's it's it's 

150.09 152.31 B: it's a drug to me 

151.98 154.05 A: yeah oh i completely agree that it is 

154.65 155.85 A: i hope someday it'll 

156.36 157.87 A: become illegal just like 

158.18 159.07 A: you know 

159.60 160.18 A: uh 

160.89 164.35 A: marijuana or something because so many people i have so many 

164.59 175.36 A: friends who uh who use marijuana and i'm pretty much against that also but they they have this whole case for how it's it's really not as bad for you as even smoking you know and it's it's really 

175.83 184.08 A: i mean i wouldn't say that's true on a lot of levels but i mean it just seems ironic to me that so many things are illegal that are detrimental to your health and 

184.21 184.94 A: and 

185.21 186.04 A: tobacco 

186.16 186.81 A: isn't 

187.09 187.69 B: right 

188.19 188.95 B: it's it 

188.53 188.95 A: it 

189.06 199.65 B: it's america um i think phillip morris and associates spent a lot to the feds because i really think it should have been legalized a long time ago but i think 

199.32 199.76 A: mhm 

199.96 202.85 B: they put just so much in to just 

203.10 205.97 B: the the federal taxes and then everything else it just 

205.85 206.36 A: right 

206.54 208.74 B: we can't lose it kind of thing 

208.22 208.70 A: right 

209.18 211.51 B: so um you know it's a large 

211.89 212.52 B: it's a large 

213.11 214.50 B: billion dollar industry 

214.68 215.18 A: mhm 

214.78 215.10 B: that 

215.72 219.49 B: (( )) it hasn't changed and we're having more teenagers get on 

219.30 219.72 A: right 

219.65 221.44 B: tobacco use and you know 

221.65 229.66 B: i i don't think the ads are really working because people i still se- see young people smoking and i don't see anything changing so it 

226.88 227.61 A: oh yeah 

230.09 238.79 B: i it starts in the home and it starts with education because a lot of parents don't know or children don't know what smoking can do to them until it's too late 

234.69 235.30 A: mhm 

237.41 237.90 A: mhm 

238.89 245.09 A: i mean i went to a boarding school in high school and they took a pole (( )) that revealed that eighty five percent 

245.33 246.65 A: of my school smoked 

246.92 249.39 A: i mean and i think that maybe it's going to have something to do with 

249.88 252.42 A: with it being a boarding school because um 

252.73 258.40 A: they didn't have their parents around all the time they were constantly around their friends they had this sense of like 

255.01 255.49 B: right 

258.63 263.68 A: you know new found freedom like you know the first time away from home like they can rebel or whatever 

264.01 265.05 A: and uh 

265.89 266.36 A: and 

266.59 269.62 A: i think i think that had something to do with it and as much as 

269.81 272.74 A: you know my school tried very hard to enforce 

272.85 283.66 A: rules about where they you know where they could smoke making it as inconvenient as possible it didn't really you know it almost kind of pushed them further well you know people are trying to make it inconvenient for us so we're just going to 

284.47 285.15 A: you know 

285.43 287.14 A: that that makes it so much more 

285.98 287.76 B: rebel 

287.30 293.07 A: yeah that makes it so much more you know exotic because people tell us not to do it so you know 

292.55 293.20 B: right 

293.38 295.21 A: it almost makes it appeal more 

296.48 296.80 A: but 

297.92 300.82 A: and i mean i i guess the same thing can be said for 

300.99 305.72 A: uh for alcohol use i mean it's it's equally addicting i would say but 

305.82 315.37 B: i think you want it more when you can't have it like when you're not supposed to have it if you're under age like oh let's go drink then as you get older it's no big deal i mean 

312.06 313.09 A: right 

314.91 315.38 A: right 

315.52 323.36 B: it's just a glass of wine or beers you know something like that but it's not you know as almost unattainable as it was when you were younger 

323.74 324.48 A: i mean that's 

332.07 333.90 A: it's so much more of a cultural thing there 

334.19 334.59 A: that 

334.22 335.13 B: right 

334.74 339.18 A: you know ever since they were really young they would have wine with their parents with 

339.54 343.65 A: dinner and therefore it kind of it took the glamour away from it because 

343.17 344.48 B: right 

344.15 348.37 A: because it wasn't something that they couldn't have and so since they grew up with it 

346.55 347.12 B: right 

348.53 350.63 A: it's not i think there are less problems 

351.01 351.52 B: right 

351.33 353.47 A: related to alcohol in that country because it's just 

353.78 354.77 A: it's not so 

355.09 357.82 A: it's not as desirable because it it's not 

357.04 357.47 B: mhm 

358.28 359.76 A: you know something they have to 

358.33 360.27 B: part of their lives and customs 

360.55 362.00 A: right right 

367.24 368.88 A: exactly 

368.54 368.85 B: so 

368.99 375.58 B: um you know and then you know there's binge drinking and you know we- we're big party animals compared to the europeans 

375.57 376.77 A: right 

376.13 379.22 B: when it comes to drinking because you know drinking is just 

380.29 382.67 B: i i i don't know not the major but 

382.99 385.94 B: you know it's just it's out it becomes an out of control 

386.27 386.89 B: thing 

386.36 386.89 A: yeah 

387.08 387.73 B: if it's 

387.34 387.76 A: yeah 

388.26 389.49 B: if it's in the wrong hands 

389.55 390.06 A: mhm 

390.74 391.57 B: and i think that 

390.97 391.71 A: (( )) 

392.00 397.15 B: the same for everything else food um and whatever other habits they listed 

397.47 402.95 A: yeah gossiping not so much it's i think that's the lesser of 

403.39 404.25 A: of the evils 

404.54 407.11 A: probably probably just because i do it too much 

404.88 414.36 B: (( )) i mean everybody gossips so i mean everyone says something about you know what you know that kind of thing i mean we're human 

407.22 407.89 A: yeah 

414.65 419.04 A: yeah i mean it can definitely get out of control and you can definitely do too much of it 

419.18 420.45 A: but uh 

420.62 427.31 A: i don't know i think and my my guy friends tell me that it's so much more of a girl habit than a guy's habit i mean 

426.70 427.34 B: right 

427.68 428.19 A: there is 

431.53 432.55 A: right 

438.16 439.30 A: just be catty 

439.66 440.26 A: yeah 

440.63 441.08 A: yeah 

441.34 442.13 B: (( )) 

441.34 450.36 A: there is a a week ago or so when my guy friend had a piece of information that i wanted to hear from him and he kept saying no you know it was told to me in confidence 

462.79 463.99 B: you thought about it 

469.00 471.45 A: she he wouldn't have told us 

469.58 474.70 B: i mean it's just like sometime it's just like second second nature you just 

474.98 483.32 B: i i don't know it's not that you can't keep a secret you just want someone to know about it kind of thing yeah you just you want to share that info 

479.51 480.22 A: exactly 

480.37 482.29 A: you want to be able to talk about it with someone 

482.88 485.52 A: right it's no fun if it's just 

484.50 484.92 B: so 

485.86 488.96 A: for you to think about 

486.56 487.41 B: yeah 

488.21 489.19 B: it's no fun 

489.40 489.95 A: yeah 

490.24 492.17 B: but yeah i think tobacco is 

492.32 492.85 B: um 

493.34 494.34 B: is a major 

494.53 495.32 B: habit 

495.41 495.92 A: mhm 

496.36 501.02 B: (( )) especially for health and financially it's draining 

500.90 501.38 A: yeah 

501.80 502.49 A: definitely 

502.10 502.41 B: yeah 

503.11 514.07 B: socially it can be too because a lot of people now are trying to stop smoking or not smoking and they have about five (( )) a lot of restaurants don't accept smoking um 

509.08 509.57 A: mhm 

513.42 513.91 A: mhm 

514.97 523.03 B: and yeah i mean it's just like a life modification if you choose to smoke sometimes especially in different states um you know you just have to 

523.73 527.78 B: really kind of conform to the new system and you have to regulate your life around that 

527.62 529.54 A: mhm and you have to accept that 

528.17 529.24 B: (( )) 

529.64 532.20 A: a fair amount of people are going to be turned off by it 

532.49 533.69 B: oh most definitely 

532.52 534.10 A: won't want to be around you 

534.46 534.99 B: mhm 

535.61 536.00 A: mhm 

536.37 538.17 B: or even (( )) to you 

538.07 538.54 A: yeah 

538.29 538.68 B: because 

539.01 542.05 B: you know some people choose not even to talk to people that smoke because 

542.84 546.82 B: it's i don't know it just gives off an air maybe they can smell it still i don't know 

546.93 547.42 A: mhm 

547.58 550.85 B: it's just too hard for some people that i know that have quit smoking 

551.04 551.45 A: yeah 

551.65 554.27 B: but and you know i don't know it's 

554.95 556.21 B: it's a serious habit 

556.72 557.21 A: mhm 

557.47 558.76 B: for a lot of people i know 

559.08 559.95 B: let's have a (( )) 

559.42 560.00 A: and it's 

560.79 561.30 A: yeah 

561.67 564.79 A: and i think it's really the only the only thing that they listed that is
