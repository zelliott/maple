48.18 48.74 A: mhm 

53.61 55.85 B: and so i think it's kind of pointless 

56.54 61.38 B: to like do all this herbal natural stuff when i don't even take care of the basics like getting a full night's sleep 

61.39 70.72 A: oh see i i i have these horrible winter allergies so like this is really disgusting but i have this constant like drip in the back of my throat 

71.09 71.75 A: that like 

78.31 78.75 B: uh huh 

87.56 93.07 A: um and i take claritin because i have these like winters allergies that like i'm allergic to like mold or something 

93.23 93.66 B: uh huh 

93.49 100.43 A: so i do actually but it's not really preventing a cold or but for a cold i take zinc i highly recommend 

98.97 101.55 B: oh my friend does that 

101.07 103.00 A: cold ease pills it's like cold 

103.32 103.71 A: dash 

103.82 105.40 A: e._e._z._e. 

104.86 105.30 B: uh huh 

105.49 107.91 A: see if you take them like right at the beginning of a cold 

108.10 108.49 B: uh huh 

108.61 110.49 A: um it supposedly like 

110.69 115.54 A: suffocates all the germs in your throat so they're still there but they don't multiply and i really think it works 

116.14 117.20 B: you know i have a friend who 

117.41 118.66 B: swears by zinc 

119.05 123.46 B: and my mother used to give me and my brother zinc when we were teenagers for acne 

123.60 124.15 A: oh 

124.15 127.04 B: she would be like honey you're breaking out take your zinc 

127.24 130.31 B: and um it would always kind of make me queasy 

130.37 130.95 A: oh 

131.17 132.28 B: and i always 

132.95 134.39 B: i don't know like i'd never 

135.02 138.64 B: threw up or anything but it would make me feel really queasy and i didn't really like it but 

139.12 139.60 B: um 

139.74 148.11 B: my friend just swears by it she's like oh yeah take i'm always like take your echinacea and your vitamin c. and she's like take your zinc 

153.52 153.91 B: mhm 

153.79 159.57 A: tasted like part of a cork and it was really horrible and it w- and it said like if you don't have if you don't eat 

159.67 159.93 A: like 

160.04 167.96 A: this many minutes before it like it's going to give you like intestinal distress and like if you if you drink citrus 

168.35 172.69 A: within a half hour before or after it will negate the effects so it was like 

171.99 172.62 B: oh wow 

172.85 177.08 A: three things like it was like you have to eat but you can't have citrus but and then you have to like 

177.30 183.09 A: you know there was i don't know if there was like a time of day but the other ones were more like a sucking candy so 

182.70 183.16 B: uh huh 

183.24 186.79 A: they it just kind of coated your throat but i i think um 

193.90 201.07 A: sucking candy version because it some of them do make you like it it says right on it it will basically make you if you don't like 

201.60 203.33 A: and if you take like more than 

203.48 208.08 A: two in a certain period of time i don't know but um anyway 

207.52 210.26 B: maybe that was a my problem as a teenager i don't know 

209.87 216.52 A: and if you and if you were using it like on your face for sk- skin issues maybe that wouldn't help i don't know 

210.60 210.92 B: but 

215.76 219.89 B: well i mean we were taking pills and stuff but 

220.01 225.13 B: it was just like oh you know like i'd rather have pimples than feel like this 

225.50 226.35 B: but 

226.71 227.56 B: that's funny 

227.68 228.57 B: that's really funny 

228.98 232.06 B: you know i i have a hard time taking pills you know i'm not 

232.92 235.00 B: i don't know i'm not very good at the 

235.20 236.68 B: daily routine thing 

237.15 237.70 A: uh huh

254.83 256.62 B: at the same time everyday i don't 

256.82 257.55 B: you know what i mean

262.98 267.59 A: so i'm like please i just graduated from school like i need work 

267.69 274.16 A: but maybe that's why why i have so many allergies too much time to think about how i'm actually feeling during the day

276.94 277.40 A: i

336.65 337.51 A: kind of ignore it 

337.82 338.36 B: yeah 

338.56 339.11 A: but um 

339.43 342.68 A: so i wonder what this um survey what was the thing they said 

343.89 346.61 A: b- something about a cold i didn't even first 

346.10 346.80 B: well you know 

359.47 360.57 B: (( )) i'm like illness 

360.85 361.57 B: what a 

361.71 366.18 B: i don't know what to say about illness what am i going to say about illnesses i don't know 

365.59 373.99 A: and i'm like paranoid i think about illness like oh i'm like i like you know like purell and all the antibacterial stuff i'm always like 

369.04 369.96 B: really 

373.18 373.79 B: uh huh 

374.22 381.02 A: spraying everything and i'm like oh get the germs away and when they said illness i was like oh my god i feel so bad for whoever is on the other line 

380.74 385.77 B: well i heard i heard somewhere that those hand sanitizers and stuff are not good 

385.99 386.56 B: that they 

387.24 390.08 A: they're like the germs will like get immune to it or something 

390.40 390.94 B: um 

391.07 395.79 B: you know actually i don't remember what the reasoning was but i heard something about 

396.31 400.88 B: um like hand sanitizers being bad or actually defeating the purpose 

401.19 404.26 B: of i don't know have you heard anything like that 

403.32 407.74 A: yeah people tell m- because i i i trust soap and water more than like 

415.63 416.23 B: right 

419.59 421.23 A: so i don't know if like um 

419.62 420.00 B: right 

421.70 428.20 A: if the hand sanitizers if they say they're bad because they're not really getting the i heard the friction from washing your hands in the running water like 

428.33 429.40 A: does a lot of the 

429.77 437.65 A: um you know cleaning part so that maybe that's why the hand sanitizers are bad but other people like people love to come up to me and tell me why my 

438.15 441.56 A: like germ phobias are not like healthy and somebody told me that it 

446.73 447.14 B: mhm 

450.68 454.46 B: you have a fern growing between your fingers or something 

453.19 460.43 A: well i i don't think it would just like grow on you but just that like over the years you know how they say if you take a lot of um 

461.46 462.68 A: what is it like uh 

462.21 464.02 B: antibiotics and stuff yeah 

462.79 464.43 A: yeah antibiotics that like 

464.63 466.55 A: you know that they'll have like the strong 

466.81 470.11 A: stronger like versions of like the common illnesses and you'll like 

469.78 470.31 B: mhm 

470.54 471.69 A: die from 

473.08 482.93 A: typhoid fever no i don't know but um i i think that's one of the things that people say if like if people are too crazy and don't any germs 

483.07 483.60 B: mhm 

483.30 484.38 A: then either you'll 

484.64 487.24 A: you won't build up a resistance or the germs will 

487.58 488.55 A: build up a resistance 

488.67 489.08 A: to 

489.39 491.37 B: oh yeah yeah yeah 

489.46 490.56 A: them being killed

493.35 493.81 A: that's 

493.38 493.91 B: you know 

494.01 495.04 B: i heard um 

495.40 495.75 B: that 

496.40 503.80 B: there are all these studies being that like children who live on farms are not as susceptible to like asthma and stuff 

503.88 504.46 A: hm 

504.21 504.75 B: or wait

511.86 512.25 A: yeah 

511.89 519.37 B: are not as susceptible to like asthma or um allergies or something like that because they're exposed to it all the time and that 

518.80 519.37 A: oh 

519.56 520.85 B: like creating a really 

520.96 524.04 B: super clean environment for you children is actually bad
