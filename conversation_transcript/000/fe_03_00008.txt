112.76 113.32 B: right 

118.26 118.93 B: yeah 

118.36 121.09 A: do you eat out at all i mean where where are you from 

121.26 124.09 B: um well i live in flagstaff arizona 

124.42 126.09 B: which is a really small town 

124.46 124.92 A: uh-huh 

126.42 126.87 A: oh 

126.68 131.60 B: and um the re- the restaurant selection is really not very good 

131.98 132.70 B: pretty limited 

133.10 138.73 A: what sort of like well i don't know arizona is what s- 

133.48 134.04 B: and 

138.90 144.61 A: i is there like a food that people there eat that's not that's special 

144.36 146.07 B: well in souther arizona 

146.36 147.33 B: um there's 

147.56 151.14 B: there's a lot of mexican restaurants there's a really big mexican population 

151.21 152.17 A: right 

152.00 152.54 B: um 

152.85 154.88 B: but up in flagstaff it's um 

155.80 163.29 B: there aren't so many mexicans and there's not a lot of mexican restaurants and i think because there aren't that many people who know good mexican food 

161.26 161.58 A: mhm 

163.91 166.00 B: the mexican restaurants aren't very good 

166.18 167.29 B: so 

166.70 166.98 A: yeah 

167.61 169.90 B: and i love mexican food so 

170.14 170.96 A: well 

170.55 171.85 B: it's kind of disappointing 

172.62 173.20 A: really 

173.33 173.75 B: yeah 

186.62 196.26 A: and and here it seems like the most popular i mean after say mcdonalds and all the really low level fast food stuff you have the mexican food 

196.07 196.63 B: uh-huh 

196.47 205.67 A: and um it has it was like a surprise it took me a while to get used to it but now i'm sort of do you have a chain a restaurant chain called (( chipatla )) over there 

206.43 208.45 B: um i've seen but i don't 

209.05 213.05 B: think it's here i mean i've seen in other places but i don't think we have it here 

213.22 216.20 A: i think it's own by mcdonalds or something but it's very good 

215.45 216.57 B: is it re- is it bad 

216.77 222.85 A: it's it's actually very good so like that's that's something that's somewhere that we go to a lot 

218.69 219.19 B: really 

222.46 222.75 B: hm 

223.70 224.10 B: wow 

223.86 224.89 A: i guess 

225.34 230.08 B: yeah we used to live in tucson and there are you know mexican restaurants on every corner 

230.18 230.65 A: mhm 

230.73 231.56 B: and cheap 

231.67 233.02 B: you know really cheap 

233.18 233.66 A: yeah 

234.44 234.80 B: but 

235.29 236.84 B: flagstaff is expensive and 

237.80 241.40 B: and although we do this is really interesting we do have three thai restaurants 

241.75 242.43 A: really 

242.59 244.01 B: three yeah 

243.85 247.15 A: is it a college town or something well maybe 

245.66 246.26 B: yeah 

247.44 251.19 A: maybe be cause and and you have a lot students from asia 

251.52 255.52 B: um we have a lot of asian students but not thai students 

255.93 256.51 A: hm 

256.02 260.99 B: there's a very there really isn't much of a thai community to speak of which 

261.28 262.68 B: is kind of you know 

262.92 267.84 B: we were actually just talking about this tonight it's strange that there are three thai restaurants but there's no 

268.00 272.33 B: no good mexican restaurant and there's no good vietnamese or anything you know 

272.08 275.68 A: what's the difference between vietnamese food and thai food 

275.51 278.26 B: um vietnamese food i think is a lot spicier 

278.72 279.22 A: really 

279.30 279.80 B: uh-huh 

279.82 281.44 A: then what about chinese and thai 

282.10 283.00 B: um 

283.18 283.72 B: hm 

283.90 291.52 A: because i can never tell the difference i mean i just think they have i mean taste exactly the same they have the same dishes on the menu even 

284.16 285.09 B: that's a good question 

291.37 291.88 B: uh-huh 

292.01 292.59 B: i think 

293.16 294.50 B: i think thai restaurants 

294.71 296.47 B: or thai cuisine i think 

296.80 300.87 B: i don't really know but it seems like they use like coconut milk more 

301.27 301.70 A: hm 

301.30 303.33 B: and like they use cilantro 

304.05 306.29 B: um more i don't think that's really used 

304.14 304.50 A: hm 

307.08 308.18 B: in chinese cooking 

315.51 315.89 B: mhm 

316.26 322.41 A: they have um they have this spanish food i forget i forget how do call like when you have food in small dishes 

323.06 324.62 B: oh um 

323.08 323.60 A: uh 

324.99 327.42 B: is it (( tapas )) or something like that mhm 

326.17 330.27 A: yeah yeah yeah (( tapas )) that's really i mean that's supposed to be the big hit now 

330.09 330.64 B: really 

330.38 341.17 A: people are going yeah there's this one place called (( )) here and i think in two locations in d._c. and that's like very that's that's the new ethiopian food 

332.39 332.93 B: wow 

341.35 343.36 B: oh that's like the place to be 

341.46 342.03 A: (( )) 

343.12 345.70 A: yeah have you ever tried ethiopian food 

345.60 347.22 B: yes i love it 

346.88 348.07 A: you do i mean 

347.53 348.06 B: yeah 

348.16 351.50 A: i tried it once and i couldn't i mean 

351.71 353.07 A: ethiopian food 

353.20 358.90 A: it seems like a contradiction in a sentence because aren't they supposed to have no food and 

358.02 361.00 B: i guess it depends on where in ethiopia 

359.89 366.20 A: and then you taste it and you understand why because i no i couldn't stand it 

362.66 363.49 B: you didn't like it 

366.34 369.90 B: was it the like the spongy bread that you didn't like or 

369.45 375.32 A: well actually they have these in israel it's close to yemenite bread which is something that i 

375.45 380.03 A: can stand but i mean the food itself i mean i didn't like the color i don't like 

380.13 381.26 A: i don't like stuff that is 

381.55 383.33 A: like i don't like brown food i think 

383.56 385.46 B: mm because it doesn't really have any 

384.10 384.40 A: and 

386.41 388.71 B: it's not like a variety of color it's just one 

388.94 389.64 B: homogeneous 

390.29 390.71 B: thing of 

390.88 401.62 A: yeah well i don't know i didn't like the presentation i uh i i found it really funny the whole concept and it was really popular here before the tapas thing caught on 

401.38 401.82 B: uh-huh 

401.98 402.85 A: so 

403.22 404.53 B: i don't think i know much 

404.75 406.29 B: spanish food i think um 

406.46 410.43 B: uh (( )) and like spanish omelets are the only thing i know about 

410.75 411.42 B: spanish food 

412.02 414.52 A: i know stuff from the menu because i've been going there 

414.64 415.06 B: uh-huh 

414.67 417.08 A: like several times but uh i mean they have 

418.21 422.51 A: well they have really basic food it's not like it's fancy with fancy ingredients i think 

422.63 423.12 A: they have some 

422.70 423.11 B: mhm 

425.41 426.02 A: they have 

426.24 426.68 A: uh 

427.70 432.01 A: i i don't know what's special about it i'm just people probably like the way the way it's 

432.80 434.04 A: uh 

434.42 435.22 A: i don't know 

435.41 437.94 A: the way it's presented or 

438.05 438.67 A: the way it's 

440.17 441.03 A: advertised 

441.18 442.49 A: that's the word i was looking for 

441.21 441.70 B: uh-huh 

443.26 446.64 B: so do you have to wait a long time to get into the restaurant and stuff 

446.98 447.70 A: um 

447.92 455.61 A: well i well i think that when we went we had places reserved so it wasn't a problem 

456.52 458.57 B: i've never really lived in a big city so 

456.61 456.87 A: but 

458.95 463.08 B: i don't i imagine you know i see the movies of new york where people are like waiting 

463.32 465.43 B: in line for restaurants and stuff and i just 

465.63 468.41 B: imagine that when you're talking about um 

468.77 469.86 B: restaurants in d._c. 

478.33 483.78 A: it was uh hard to get used to but now i think i'm so american it just makes me scared sometimes 

484.22 488.96 A: like i go back to israel and i like go to the small falafel place and i'm like huh 

491.02 493.14 B: oh i love falafel 

493.66 494.18 B: yeah 

499.71 500.13 B: uh-huh 

499.73 502.91 A: but that's like something that i would make i think 

501.97 502.54 B: oh 

503.02 506.97 B: wow whenever i make falafel at home it takes me a really long time 

506.43 513.87 A: well maybe because you are making it like from uh from scratch we use powder so it doesn't take
