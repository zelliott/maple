83.29 84.29 B: (( )) i don't know 

84.48 84.88 A: what was that 

85.00 86.59 A: thing that the guy said about if you go 

86.86 87.77 A: if you get a cold 

88.21 90.67 A: it lasts seven days and if you go to the doctor it lasts a week 

90.68 94.52 B: yeah wasn't that provocative i have no idea 

91.86 95.77 A: what does that mean i don't understand 

96.21 97.02 B: yeah i don't know 

97.78 100.98 B: i guess it uh it may refer to like our psyche or something 

101.45 104.59 A: yeah but what's the difference between seven days and a week which is supposed to feel longer 

103.34 105.55 B: that's the thing there's noth- yeah there's not difference 

106.11 109.48 A: i thought they maybe were trying to drag it out like seven days seems longer than a week 

110.22 112.50 B: or a week seems longer than seven days 

110.96 115.70 A: longer than seven days (( )) i don't know it's a philosophical problem really 

115.25 116.63 B: yeah it is funny 

116.20 119.84 A: i actually had this co- worker and he said that 

120.21 124.47 A: he would always get really depressed in the winter and when it rains and all that stuff but 

124.89 126.83 A: the problem was that he was sort of a 

127.12 129.91 A: he wasn't the nicest guy in the world he was sort of hard to work with and 

129.76 130.10 B: uh-huh 

130.00 139.37 A: he was like that all summer and when he told me about it he's like so you might have noticed you know when it got to be kind of cold out i started getting a little harder to work and i was like no in august you were pretty bad too 

137.92 138.84 B: yeah

175.44 176.52 A: know what i want to be doing 

176.71 177.33 A: forever 

176.95 178.39 B: you wanted to move to new york city 

178.96 181.07 A: um yeah i don't know i 

181.61 188.56 A: yeah i guess i did i don't know what i wanted but the job seems good i sort of ended up here i really like the city 

185.78 186.20 B: uh-huh 

189.16 190.10 A: it's a nice place to live 

190.83 193.18 B: funny i c- i really have a hard time with new york 

193.27 197.71 A: that's what the guy i talked to yesterday said yeah why is that 

195.39 196.17 B: oh really 

197.82 203.76 B: i don't know every time i go there my sister was living there for for a while and every time i'd go to visit her like after three days 

204.22 207.23 B: i'd just lose my mind i mean i couldn't i couldn't take it anymore you know 

207.42 212.40 A: i used to i grew up in new jersey and i used to come to the city as a little kid and i definitely felt that way that it was 

212.77 214.67 A: busy and overwhelming and big 

214.39 214.78 B: uh-huh 

214.86 217.11 A: but i think once you live here it's not like that at all 

217.38 217.75 B: right 

218.04 218.59 A: you kind of 

218.36 218.61 B: i 

218.87 220.10 B: you get used to it i guess 

219.65 220.94 A: yeah you get used to it 

221.12 226.93 A: and i mean i think once you get to know the neighborhoods especially if you stay away from all the really crowded touristy sort of areas 

227.38 227.79 A: it's 

228.08 229.61 A: feels a lot smaller than it is 

228.23 231.26 B: yeah everything seems crowded to me 

230.90 235.05 A: depends on where you are like my neighborhood is not crowded at all but 

231.59 232.47 B: funny 

232.82 233.20 B: yeah 

235.45 237.35 A: obviously if you go to times square or 

238.07 240.76 A: take the subway during rush hour then it's going to be really crowded 

240.85 241.22 B: yeah 

241.53 243.39 A: what part of virginia are you charlottesville 

243.37 244.38 B: charlottesville yeah

372.36 372.92 B: and you can't 

373.17 373.65 B: i don't know

377.95 378.44 B: oh right 

378.55 380.38 A: so especially if i have a cold or something flying 

380.94 381.93 A: gets me messed up but 

382.32 386.99 B: when i was twelve or thirteen years old i went to new york city for the first time to visit some 

387.78 391.32 B: some friends who lived there they were sort of in their late twenties and family friends 

391.55 395.14 B: so they took me out on the town and we saw all sorts of stuff and um 

395.67 398.34 B: i ended up getting tonsillitis towards the end of the trip 

398.04 399.03 A: oh 

399.34 403.18 B: and then i had to fly back on the uh on the airplane to los angeles where i was from 

403.73 408.60 B: and uh so on the plane you know i'm this twelve year old kid with tonsillitis going on 

407.17 409.55 A: oh that's horrible 

408.74 411.79 B: you know this elevation change and then i threw up on the lady next to me 

411.46 414.46 A: oh i'm sure she loved that 

413.43 420.86 B: it was awful she was with she had a kid or something herself so she u- you know she sort of understood my situation but i felt so bad 

420.44 421.83 A: did you get your tonsils taken out 

422.45 423.59 B: uh no i didn't 

423.85 427.07 B: i don't know what you know they were just like inflamed and then i got back to l._a. 

427.41 428.38 B: they went back to normal 

428.59 432.29 B: i'm telling you new york city does this to people 

429.75 436.79 A: it got you sick i don't know i don't get sick that often and i've been living here for two and a half years 

436.98 437.38 B: yeah 

437.44 438.79 A: i got the flu last year but 

439.06 440.59 A: that was pretty bad besides that 

441.01 442.93 A: oh and i had this weird stomach thing where 

443.25 452.68 A: i was felt sick at work and i decided to take the subway home which probably wasn't the best idea but i was sitting on the subway and i thought i was going to throw up and i didn't want to have to do it on the subway so like the second the doors opened i 

451.11 452.43 B: oh that's awful yeah 

453.02 454.81 A: ran out and puked in the 

454.94 457.46 A: garbage 

457.58 458.35 A: it was pretty bad but 

458.83 459.17 B: yeah 

458.91 460.54 A: i think people thought i was drunk but i 

460.67 462.74 A: it was the middle of the day i mean i'd just been sick 

463.53 465.72 B: you still could have been drunk in new york 

464.97 471.76 A: i could have been but i wasn't that's true i mean nobody even looked twice i mean that's the great place the great thing about new york is that 

466.16 466.46 B: yeah 

472.20 476.97 A: somebody could be you know standing there puking on the platform and nobody cares people just walk right by and 

474.39 474.89 B: yeah 

477.18 478.81 A: mind their own business 

477.53 478.79 B: that is that is true 

478.99 481.91 A: like in another city they'd be like are you okay what's going on 

481.17 481.52 B: right 

484.10 486.98 B: and that allows you i mean allows you many freedoms as well right

487.92 491.01 B: that allows many freedoms that type of behavior yeah 

489.64 490.13 A: yeah 

490.29 490.81 A: that's true 

491.07 491.56 A: that's true 

491.77 495.71 A: yeah i mean you can kind of do whatever you want and there's going to be somebody else who is sort of weird too and 

496.75 497.69 A: they'll be doing it 

498.06 498.87 A: whatever maybe 

499.50 502.28 A: that's what's good about new york too i mean no matter what you're into or 

502.56 508.38 A: what kind of food you like or what kind of museums you like or shows whatever you want to do there's going to be something there for you to do 

507.67 508.50 B: yeah that's true yeah 

508.75 509.86 A: it's kind of something for everybody
