169.88 170.98 B: i only know

191.42 192.39 B: (( mm )) 

192.80 195.48 A: [mn] and my friend 

195.83 204.97 A: made [mn] this concoction of ginger and honey and water for me when i got sore throats earlier in the year and 

205.04 210.59 A: i think it helps it well i liked the way it tasted but um 

210.59 220.85 A: if you if you boil some water and grate some ginger and uh mix it mix it all up with lots of honey um it it soothes a sore throat 

220.14 221.82 B: [noise] [noise] oh i didn't know that 

222.68 225.42 B: is that like a home made tea considered or 

225.98 226.66 A: (( hm )) 

226.42 230.61 B: is that considered a home made tea or is it just mixing spices 

230.05 237.04 A: um i don't i don't think of it as tea it's more like one of those home brewed me- remedies or something 

236.36 238.13 B: okay yeah 

237.94 240.70 A: he said he learned it in japan though so 

239.98 241.37 B: oh that's neat

248.57 250.28 B: medicine ideas 

249.70 251.60 A: oh the alternative medicines 

250.94 253.81 B: yeah i don't know it's interesting 

254.40 256.74 A: um some of my friends 

256.87 258.45 A: have gone to 

258.64 262.18 A: uh chinese herbalists recently 

261.62 262.69 B: oh really 

262.83 267.89 A: yeah well like the last year or so i don't think they've gone this year [mn] 

267.62 268.48 B: (( mm )) 

269.62 280.24 A: yeah a friend of mine had this chronic hacking cough for several months last year no maybe it was two years ago and uh he went to 

275.79 276.89 B: mhm 

280.15 284.96 A: a western doctor and the doctor just couldn't figure out what on earth was going on like 

285.24 293.31 A: he thought it might be bronchitis but does bronchitis last that long so his mother dragged him to this 

289.45 290.69 B: yeah 

293.45 295.77 A: chinese herbalist in new york 

296.58 298.77 A: i don't know if that helped though i 

298.15 299.99 B: [laughter] 

300.42 301.47 B: (( i don't know )) 

302.32 313.05 A: think it's he i think he had that cough because he was in his senior year of college and he was really stressed out about it [mn] 

312.03 316.77 B: yeah that was my boyfriend last year he had a cough that lasted for 

316.86 320.92 B: a good couple of months at the end of the semester it was probably stress related too 

321.06 325.18 B: but the doctor said he they didn't think that he had bronchitis 

324.79 325.59 A: hm 

325.37 326.27 B: (( but [noise] [noise] )) 

326.99 327.85 A: um 

328.50 339.11 A: yeah stress definitely affects how you [mn] um how well you fight off disease [mn] two years ago when i was still in college i 

338.18 339.11 B: mhm 

339.63 347.74 A: [mn] decided to finish getting my hepatitis b. vaccinations because i was vaccinated 

347.81 355.84 A: um in nineteen ninety six just before i went off to college but for some reason i didn't get all three shots as i should have so 

354.51 355.69 B: oh yeah 

355.84 365.42 A: uh a few years later i decided oh i'll just finish it so i got two more shots and after the second shot um 

365.91 379.85 A: one weekend i developed this rash and i think i developed the rash not because of the shot as the college infirmary thought but because that was a really stressful weekend i had a lot of stuff due 

375.03 376.02 B: yeah 

379.92 390.93 A: uh on that monday and i had a concert to perf- perform in on sunday night and all this other stuff and this rash broke out on my shoulders 

390.33 391.70 B: oh wow 

391.12 397.21 A: but once i got everything done it miraculously subsided [mn] 

395.86 401.03 B: [laughter] of course when everything's done it's like all right [laughter] 

398.72 399.74 A: yeah 

400.19 403.99 A: i don't think it had anything to do with the the shot at all 

404.10 405.20 B: (( uh-huh )) 

405.25 409.08 A: but the infirmary refused to give me any more shots because they 

409.31 412.18 A: thought that it caused my rash so 

412.03 415.03 B: what is hepatitis actually do you know 

414.18 419.75 A: um it's this disease that affects the liver it 

419.84 430.70 A: i think there are three forms that are currently recognized the hepatitis a hepatitis b. and hepatitis c and um hepatitis b. is spread through um 

425.42 426.46 B: mhm 

431.43 437.62 A: contact with blo- with body fluids like blood and um sexual fluids so 

435.26 436.44 B: (( oh okay )) 

437.80 451.60 A: um [cough] so i think it's recommended that everyone get a hepatitis b. shot if they can even children because if you get the vaccine then y- you won't get hepatitis b 

445.60 446.72 B: okay 

451.27 453.14 B: oh it only blocks that one 

453.07 454.34 A: yeah 

453.91 455.02 B: oh 

454.72 464.00 A: hepatitis a isn't that serious i think i'm not sure i don't really know much about hepatitis but i i do know that hepatitis b. is considered 

460.84 461.86 B: yeah 

464.56 471.58 A: hepatitis b. is considered a serious public health threat in the u._s. because because it's it's preventable but 

468.65 469.83 B: oh wow 

471.45 479.94 A: it's it spreads so rapidly because people don't take care of themselves during sex and 

480.81 483.61 A: um and no one gets the vaccines too 

483.99 488.92 A: um hepatitis a i think is spread through 

489.04 491.51 A: fecal matter but i'm not sure 

491.14 492.45 B: (( [noise] mm [mn] )) 

491.88 497.98 A: and c. i don't really know much about but c. is very deadly 

497.66 498.97 B: oh really 

498.38 501.11 A: yeah but i'm not sure how that spreads though 

501.22 502.01 B: (( mm )) 

502.26 505.33 B: i'm impressed you know that much [laughter] 

503.96 506.47 A: well i like to read about things 

506.14 508.04 B: [laughter] 

507.75 509.00 A: (( [mn] like my )) 

509.17 510.78 A: i work at a p- [mn] 

511.01 519.27 A: i work in a place where i have to sit in front of the computer all day so i read stuff while i wait for uh web pages to download 

514.20 515.19 B: mhm 

518.83 521.22 B: (( oh [laughter] [mn] )) 

524.43 525.45 A: yeah 

527.31 529.96 A: so you don't feel sick these days do you 

529.75 541.40 B: no i don't i had i usually only have a cold every once in a while i get a cold but i think i've only had the flu like twice in my life i i like never get the my stomach never gets upset or anything 

541.83 554.05 B: um i can't think of any major illnesses that i had my dad just had to go to the hospital a few weeks ago he had some sort of pain in his stomach and he thought it was um his appendix burst 

550.63 551.57 A: mhm 

553.28 554.89 A: yeah 

554.14 564.61 B: but they went and they never found out what it was so they're still trying to do tests and stuff and he says he can't sleep on his back or his one side and i don't know it's kind of scare but 

565.06 565.90 A: hm 

566.32 571.33 A: oh the flu that reminds me last month i got a flu shot 

571.35 572.54 A: and 

572.91 576.41 A: i told one of my friends at 

576.62 582.48 A: my work place and he didn't want to get the flu vaccine because he's 

582.84 586.33 A: uh he has this needle phobia or something 

585.48 588.09 B: oh [laughter] 

586.60 587.73 A: and 

588.07 594.32 A: i don't know i just thought it was a little silly [mn] not to get the shot just because he was 

593.57 595.07 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

594.36 599.59 A: afraid of needles because i mean the company was paying for it and 

599.95 604.12 A: um it's better not to have the flu if you can avoid it right so 

603.23 617.67 B: yeah my mom this year at her work they always give it for free and she used to never get it and then two years in a row she got the shot and just happened to be those two years was when she got the flu too and she like usually never gets the flu so now she's totally against the flu shots and 

617.61 620.88 B: [mn] so i don't know if it was just bad luck or what but 

620.42 621.91 A: yeah maybe so 

621.75 624.34 B: or maybe her body couldn't fight off the 

624.69 627.96 B: little bit they whatever they put into you i don't know 

627.83 632.07 A: were they the same strains that she was vaccinated against 

631.75 635.56 B: um i probably i wouldn't don't know i have no idea 

636.01 639.71 A: there's lots of flu varieties floating around 

638.97 641.25 B: (( yeah )) 

642.28 644.53 B: i don't know i should get a flu shot this 

644.54 652.80 B: year and i'm in college still so a lot more prone to getting sick i think here with all the people that you can come in contact with 

652.40 654.82 A: yeah and all the stress 

654.18 655.81 B: yeah that too 

657.50 658.30 B: (( mm ))

672.05 674.01 A: (( well having )) 

674.17 682.38 A: a real job is different it's not easier or harder it's just different different problems 

680.05 681.21 B: yeah 

681.96 683.15 B: yeah 

682.86 687.90 A: i mean i i like not having to do homework [laughter] i miss

693.05 694.11 A: yeah 

694.58 698.68 A: and also uh college students feel 

698.99 701.08 A: it's it's like college students feel like 

701.08 714.79 A: it's appropriate to invite people to come over to the dorm rooms any time and in the real world you have to like invite people in advance and make sure that no one's busy and it's just a hassle 

705.79 707.10 B: mhm 

711.06 712.31 B: yeah 

713.48 719.90 B: this year i'm in a an apartment and it's a lot less um social than the dorms were i kind of miss the dorms but
