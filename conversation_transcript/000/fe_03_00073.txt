1.87 2.60 A: (( hi )) 

3.50 4.89 A: kevin here 

4.90 6.66 A: how are you what was that again 

6.55 7.56 B: steve 

7.72 9.15 A: ah pleasure 

9.30 12.49 A: do you actually watch shows like that 

11.90 14.07 B: i watched survivor actually 

14.50 18.74 B: i'm a bit ashamed to admit it but [laughter] i do 

17.66 23.09 A: i'm more astonished at the other ones you know that's you know who wants to become a concubine 

23.25 27.89 B: [laughter] yeah i i find those to be distasteful um 

28.46 34.26 B: survivor survivor is it's i wouldn't quite call it a reality show it's um 

34.38 38.32 A: well it's definitely nothing to do with reality i mean 

36.85 40.53 B: no it's more it's more of an exotic game show you know 

39.75 40.56 A: yes 

41.88 42.97 B: yeah because 

42.37 45.95 A: any minute you expect monty hall to jump out of a coconut 

46.28 49.11 B: right [laughter] 

49.65 51.72 B: so do you do you watch any of these 

51.94 56.44 A: no i [sigh] i i find them repulsive in the extreme 

56.38 64.02 B: [laughter] you should g- you should give survivor a chance though it's it's it's actually quite fun i think 

58.88 60.11 A: i mean this whole 

63.54 65.18 A: well think of it this way 

65.26 68.98 A: there used to be a rea- reality show called candid camera 

69.13 71.30 B: (( mhm yes i've heard of it )) 

70.22 76.02 A: in which people uh were exposed to little bits of strangeness and whatnot 

75.74 77.09 B: right 

78.43 90.12 A: i view some of that you know again take someone who is basically the problem with the shows is not just it's the mean spiritedness of them the competitiveness 

90.53 101.28 A: the idea that gee we're not looking at the idea that one person's going to win we're looking at the idea that we're going to see twenty people voted off the island 

101.71 105.19 A: we're going to see who is the weakest link i mean 

105.29 111.65 A: that there's a show where basically you know everyone's exposed to the great iron nanny [mn] 

105.38 106.17 B: mhm 

111.13 114.95 B: right [laughter] 

115.49 118.60 B: well that that really isn't so much of a reality show it's a 

118.58 132.53 A: no but i- it it pulls directly from the other shows the idea of that let's get rid of let's basically sit there and watch people voting off and let's eat 'em you know let's get right down to 

130.44 131.63 B: yeah yeah 

134.26 141.40 A: reality shows like or big brother they all require a degree of attrition otherwise 

142.64 147.95 B: mhm that's right yeah well tha- that's the point of the game it's who who 

148.41 150.62 B: who suffers attrition first you know 

149.75 151.78 A: mhm 

150.94 155.10 B: and so uh in in a way i i see what you mean you're you're 

155.43 158.04 B: you're delighting in other people's misfortune 

158.10 165.45 A: you know welcome to shake and freud [laughter] a word that no one ever used to use except psychologists 

161.74 162.67 B: [laughter] 

166.06 170.98 A: but now it's rapidly becoming practically the national passtime 

170.50 173.31 B: [laughter] 

173.45 175.54 B: but i i do think that the 

175.84 183.95 B: well all right i mean so some some on survivor you know which which i watch occasionally i mean some of the puzzles are just are just interesting it's it's not very 

184.00 185.36 B: (( you know a- a- )) 

184.88 188.23 A: i remember the first one when they were on a desert island 

188.19 189.48 B: mhm 

188.94 201.37 A: and they were showing people going out looking for f- you know they they they were looking for they were looking for yams and tapioca and you had people looking up into the trees 

198.01 198.86 B: mhm 

201.01 204.45 B: [laughter] for a yam [laughter] 

203.66 212.09 A: you know no no no no no no no don't eat the rats don't eat the rats eat the snakes that eat the rats 

212.13 216.57 B: it it's funny though it's really funny and and you know people will 

215.72 219.66 A: i wonder if people are going to come back and say gee i'd really like a mcrat 

219.67 220.90 A: (( [mn] have )) 

220.43 222.01 B: [laughter] 

221.23 222.87 A: (( you ever talked about performing )) 

223.76 224.99 A: (( like )) 

226.37 228.48 A: somehow the idea of you know 

230.24 233.70 A: i- it's just a little too much 

235.46 241.49 A: i think you could have just as much fun taking photographs of a little old lady on the side of the highway 

241.71 243.28 A: with a flat tyre 

244.08 247.77 A: just wait and see who stops and who drives by 

247.94 249.38 B: [laughter] 

249.58 252.56 A: hey that was our car going by [mn] [mn] 

252.43 262.61 B: well the- there is a difference you know you have you have these actors or you know these these agents who are who are honestly trying and so you can you can you know identify with their aspects of their failures 

263.75 268.09 B: and it it's yeah i mean one one one finds oneself saying 

268.13 272.33 B: you know if i were there this is what i would do um 

270.48 274.28 A: there are three words that come to mind when i see these shows 

274.02 275.01 B: okay 

274.69 277.55 A: bread and circuses 

276.78 279.37 B: [laughter] 

279.23 281.41 A: we're in an age where 

281.44 291.86 A: forty percent of the white collar workers who are being fi- who are being let go are effectively being told gee there's no way we can put you back into the economy 

292.57 294.52 B: (( it's [noise] [laughter] )) 

294.17 305.06 A: we're seeing factories shut down we're seeing industry moved anywhere on the planet where cheap labor can be obtained and whatnot and this is such a 

305.12 308.44 A: blatant extreme divertissimo 

310.42 313.10 B: well i i think there are worse things 

312.57 313.18 A: (( there )) 

313.45 318.02 A: are there are when you sit there i i have a favorite term i use 

318.62 320.86 A: try to explain to people how 

321.08 325.06 A: most o- you know most of the world sees america 

325.73 327.10 B: i'm sorry i didn't hear that 

325.95 327.41 A: through c._n._n. 

328.03 329.25 B: (( could you say that again )) 

328.22 333.91 A: in other words most of the world thinks that america is one gigantic suburb of atlanta 

334.32 337.32 B: (( yes i i know what you mean exactly )) 

337.74 339.71 A: (( i used to live in canada )) 

338.40 339.25 B: (( but the )) 

340.25 346.92 A: and just a little difference of seeing foreign news coming in and whatnot the different perspectives 

345.43 346.43 B: mhm 

346.79 348.30 B: yeah 

347.89 353.29 A: changes things in your mindset on the world drastically 

352.71 353.75 B: mhm 

353.81 359.73 A: uh now the big brother game actually sta- like all american television starts in europe 

360.60 362.69 B: yes i i've heard that yeah 

362.11 366.77 A: but if you want scary have you ever heard what they do in japanese game shows 

366.88 371.15 B: yes i've heard of one game show where they lock these people into a house 

371.48 375.01 B: and require them to live off of deliveries they have to you know 

376.18 380.66 B: you know get free samples from various from various you know companies and 

380.77 385.24 B: and [mn] they have to call people up to bring them food and whatnot 

385.98 387.46 B: and you know if they 

386.34 391.53 A: mhm that that pushed the sport into into the element of of desperation 

391.60 395.04 A: me i know exactly how to do it hi wanna be on television 

395.15 396.40 A: bring me a pizza 

396.97 399.41 B: (( [laughter] that's true )) 

399.47 408.11 A: in fact i call another company and say hi i want you to make up some tee shirts that say 'i brought kevin a pizza' [mn] but 

399.52 400.67 B: but then it it 

406.78 416.68 B: exactly yeah that that's pretty clever yes it could be done certainly i i think that the the thing the thing about the japanese versions i think there there's a deliberate you know measure of sadism in it 

416.79 421.24 A: well they're in a culture where everything is regulated and set 

421.97 425.67 A: you study you get you you do your tests 

424.83 426.50 B: (( um right )) 

425.78 428.97 A: and uh once you theoretically find that job 

429.79 431.88 A: they're stuck with you for life 

431.61 433.48 B: mhm 

433.23 436.33 A: and in the last twenty years that's gone out the window 

436.76 437.87 B: yes 

437.35 440.32 A: so you've got a whole chaotic generation there 

441.00 447.82 A: but the game shows there they'll do something like they'll pack you on a seven forty seven with four hundred other people 

447.86 448.76 B: mhm 

448.19 451.51 A: they will fly you five hundred miles away 

452.17 455.51 A: they will only fly back the top one hundred 

455.91 459.81 B: (( [laughter] oh that's great really )) 

459.49 470.99 A: hey you know you walk into these things knowing these rules and knowing that these people voluntarily said that they've done a parody of it on the simpsons that was disturbingly accurate 

472.50 476.50 A: and now we have a canadian couple who do not like scorpions 

478.05 481.16 A: so of course they dub scorpions on them 

480.60 482.13 B: exactly yes 

482.61 484.18 B: (( exactly that attitude that's )) 

483.99 492.62 A: you know fear factor okay there's another one let's strap somebody into the dentist chair with the flame thrower at crotch level 

490.14 491.08 B: (( crazy that's )) 

491.53 492.74 B: (( terrible you know )) 

492.81 499.60 A: what moron why don't we put them in the oven when we're done [laughter] you 

498.94 502.60 B: [laughter] uh i just don't understand why people will will 

502.82 506.79 B: go on that show and and eat slugs and endure these horrible things 

507.32 508.76 B: it's just not worth it [mn] 

508.20 510.88 A: know well they had an interesting little thing on the uh the t- 

511.28 516.49 A: the thai uh survival game couple of thai soldiers came over 

516.59 521.28 A: took out a machetes showed them how to build chopsticks 

521.48 522.94 B: (( all right [noise] )) 

522.60 528.44 A: then showed them how to build damn near anything in a matter of about thirty minutes 

528.18 529.48 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

528.66 531.32 A: then took everything they built and walked away 

531.65 533.09 B: (( all right )) 

533.46 539.43 A: they passed on the basic information naturally nobody really caught on well enough to actually do any of it 

539.33 540.19 B: uh-huh 

540.71 541.28 B: (( [noise] )) 

541.55 542.93 A: but uh 

543.44 556.82 A: it's the emphasis on hi you know any minute now you could be dropped on on a mountain top somewhere in brazil and um well at least you'll have a couple of good recipes of knowing how to cook your fellow here 

557.55 559.14 A: your fellow passenger 

557.65 565.07 B: but that's not so much of the to the worst case scenario calendars you see now have you have you you know the book the book series 

565.47 567.10 A: worst case scenario 

566.82 568.26 B: (( have you heard of it you )) 

568.00 569.51 A: yes i have 

569.45 579.99 B: know you know like they have these calendars now i mean each day you know these day calendars where you rip off the sheets i mean each day they have some tip like wanna a a mountain panther you know do this 

580.20 588.76 B: [laughter] and and the funny thing is that people who buy these things and read them they're never going to run into a mountain panther and you know like i i don't understand i i guess they're sort of 

588.92 593.85 A: there's a scene i've always wanted to think of in my mind if i were in jurassic park 

593.69 594.69 B: mhm 

593.89 598.56 A: sitting there on the toilet facing down a fifty foot high man eater 

598.57 599.59 B: right 

599.02 600.53 A: do you know what i'd be doing 

600.37 601.74 B: what would you be doing 

601.17 604.57 A: well i was on the toilet to begin with so i think it would be easy 

604.77 608.44 A: but uh i would reach into my pocket and pull out 

609.23 610.71 A: (( a cigarette lighter )) 

611.32 612.79 B: (( what would that do )) 

611.96 612.98 A: hello 

613.39 620.43 A: i'm a we're descended from those little egg sucking bastards you used to have to deal with [mn] and now i play with fire 

621.14 624.42 B: i don't know if that gets you alive though you see [laughter] 

623.58 626.50 A: ever heard of an animal that will run toward a fire 

626.97 629.90 B: well it's a kind of a little speck of fire i mean surely 

629.28 636.36 A: guess what tiny little speck of fire is all it takes i've seen people drive off a grizzly bear 

636.20 637.71 B: (( really )) 

637.53 639.20 A: with fire 

639.09 641.09 B: wow i had no idea 

641.06 642.53 A: they're not dumb 

642.79 646.81 A: we you know we we have that interesting little quirk with us you know it just 

647.28 653.64 A: it took it took a hundred thousand years of domestication to get a dog to a point where it will approach a fire 

653.71 654.90 B: mhm 

654.29 656.31 A: most animals don't like it 

657.58 666.52 A: but uh no reality based shows like that you know wh- where gee i really have to know which grubs and rats can be eaten 

666.28 668.33 B: [laughter] 

670.17 684.57 B: i guess i guess part of it is that fundamentally one's one's basic needs are are entirely met in this society i mean they're exceptions of course but generally one has enough food to eat and one has shelter one has all these things 

683.40 694.18 A: i'm swigging down a two liter bottle of dr pepper as i talk to you and i'm perfectly aware of the people who go on these survival episodes are provided with their own water 

687.76 689.75 B: [laughter] 

694.22 702.40 A: because pure and simple most people under ordinary circumstances would contaminate their water supply in a matter of hours 

694.49 695.39 B: mhm 

702.49 705.14 B: [noise] oh yeah absolutely 

704.75 707.33 A: put twenty people together and suddenly 

707.55 709.69 A: oh what's toilet paper 

710.61 718.38 B: yeah and it this is a peculiarity of of our society really because if you if you go to other places where people 

718.48 719.95 A: well we all expect 

718.98 719.89 B: are
