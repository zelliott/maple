23.57 28.58 B: okay what do you think is i think it was the topic was what do you think is worse gossip 

29.04 30.25 B: alcohol drink 

30.39 32.05 B: excessive alcohol or 

32.21 34.49 B: coffee or smoking or overeating or 

32.25 33.42 A: overeating 

35.03 35.95 A: yeah 

35.39 36.67 B: anything else i guess it 

37.09 40.59 A: uh i guess i'll say uh gossiping because 

40.68 43.04 A: all of the others don't 

43.42 45.21 A: involve anybody but yourself 

45.33 45.91 B: yeah 

46.08 46.78 B: that's true 

47.38 53.05 B: i didn't um i hadn't thought of that i hadn't thought of it that way until you just mentioned that yeah gossip can be nasty 

53.46 56.67 A: i i can't it's one of my pet peeves actually i can't stand gossips 

55.30 55.70 B: yeah 

56.80 57.34 A: uh 

56.96 57.62 B: yeah 

57.56 59.92 A: wh- what were you going to say before i said that 

59.97 65.14 B: i was going to say i was going to say i was probably thinking gossip as well just because i don't 

64.02 64.63 A: uh-huh 

65.63 66.95 B: you know i don't i don't like it 

67.11 67.55 B: um 

68.33 68.61 B: but 

69.53 69.97 B: uh 

70.37 71.76 B: especially like i'm at a uh 

72.26 73.23 B: university and in a 

73.33 74.30 B: small department and 

76.41 78.13 B: you know i don't know where you draw the line between 

78.47 80.36 B: politics and gossip but 

80.88 82.16 B: sometimes it gets a little 

82.31 85.73 A: in my experience they tend to be pretty much the same 

85.57 86.02 B: yeah 

85.88 90.56 A: uh or or certainly gossip leads right next to right right into politics 

90.38 90.88 B: yeah 

91.15 93.47 A: uh-huh so i work alone uh 

94.36 95.13 B: yeah it's uh 

96.04 98.09 B: yeah it's tough anything el- any of the other ones 

98.32 99.05 B: bother you or 

101.78 105.73 A: stuck out at me like a sore thumb because it's so different from all the others it's not a 

106.19 109.46 A: a personal abuse an- uh i wonder if it's in there as a 

109.82 112.49 A: as a red herring almost as a distracter 

112.52 112.95 B: yeah 

112.99 113.56 A: um 

114.70 120.31 A: if we were going to pretend that that one were not in there since the others i don't even think of gossip as a personal habit 

120.46 122.66 A: as much as they do it just is 

123.92 125.34 A: failure in character or uh 

125.85 127.09 A: failure to consider 

127.15 127.62 B: yeah 

127.89 128.50 A: uh-huh 

128.78 131.93 A: circumstances and consequences um 

132.87 133.37 B: yeah 

133.62 137.83 A: i don't know the others what were they overeating smoking 

137.78 139.63 B: excessive drinking and uh 

140.56 141.78 B: caffeine 

141.53 142.37 A: yeah oh 

142.00 142.59 B: i mean i 

142.81 145.33 B: i smoke and i drink a lot of coffee so 

145.18 145.92 A: okay 

145.62 146.88 B: i guess uh 

147.17 149.71 B: i mean you know i guess both of those are bad habits but 

150.93 151.81 A: uh-huh i don't 

151.52 151.78 B: oh 

152.12 154.52 A: smoke and i don't drink a lot of coffee i 

152.15 152.41 B: oh 

154.66 161.18 A: i guess if we're going to draw lines you might be able to say that smoking has uh second hand effects 

161.08 161.86 B: yeah sure 

161.78 162.50 A: more than 

162.66 165.09 A: uh more than the others do so 

166.56 171.13 B: yeah uh well with the drinking i guess you know you get people driving 

171.27 171.71 A: right

187.15 189.82 B: i know i live on a university campus a lot of the the 

190.16 193.24 B: bad stuff that happens usually happens when people are drunk

470.95 471.34 A: uh-huh 

473.62 474.72 B: uh the do- and 

475.26 478.21 B: doctor said well what do you eat a lot of candy i don't really eat any

483.28 484.13 A: oh 

483.46 483.82 B: doctor 

483.93 489.14 B: said stop that immediately -cause she said any sleep study is just (( gonna )) tell you to lose ten pounds 

489.41 489.92 A: right 

489.83 496.65 B: so i cut that sugar out and i lost like i just stopped cold turkey on sugar in anything i lost twelve pounds in like 

494.66 495.29 A: good for you 

497.17 498.28 B: five days 

497.98 499.01 A: just from doing that 

498.94 504.06 B: just from doing that which then that got me thinking -cause i was eating rice every night you know 

503.89 504.42 A: uh-huh 

504.29 505.65 B: i cut the rice out 

505.66 506.67 A: right 

506.38 509.79 B: and you know the potatoes and stuff i kept eating greens 

509.83 510.17 A: yup 

510.16 513.04 B: and boom like within six months that weight was gone 

513.03 513.69 A: that's amazing 

515.03 515.89 B: totally incredible 

516.13 519.31 A: yeah so it was the lack of sleep even more than the weight that p- 

519.67 521.15 A: possessed you to start the program 

521.09 522.52 B: it was lack of sleep yeah 

522.54 522.88 A: huh 

522.62 525.95 B: i mean y- i didn't even really notice how fat i had gotten until 

526.07 530.44 B: like i looked at uh uh you know i i started looking at you know pictures taken from you know 

530.64 531.72 B: five months ago 

531.51 532.04 A: wow 

532.22 532.86 B: i mean you know 

533.05 536.34 B: from five months prior to you know when i started to the lose the weight 

536.53 537.01 A: uh-huh 

537.81 542.64 B: so yeah it was the lack of sleep it was in fact it wasn't my lack of sleep it was my snoring 

543.58 544.62 B: keeping my wife up 

544.66 546.59 A: oh so she's the one 

546.59 547.09 B: yeah 

548.12 548.57 B: so 

548.15 548.53 A: well 

554.76 562.48 A: my father had a heart attack about ten years ago and and he was sixty he was fifty five at the time and 

557.09 557.53 B: okay 

560.92 561.29 B: right 

562.65 566.37 A: you know his doctor started yelling at him about diet and exercise and 

566.74 567.65 A: at the time i was 

568.19 569.67 A: drinking a lot and not exercising 

569.78 570.13 B: right 

570.47 572.98 A: uh and i i changed a lot of my habits 

573.24 573.71 B: okay 

573.61 578.46 A: uh just -cause i guess -cause of that i mean it's c- coincidental if i can't think of anything else that 

579.13 581.27 A: that would've motivated it other than that
