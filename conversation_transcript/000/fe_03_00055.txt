27.42 28.98 B: right hum 

40.79 41.35 B: right 

41.70 44.16 A: so gossiping i think affects other people

45.81 46.57 B: that's true 

46.88 50.85 B: yeah and you never know if you doing it or even true so 

51.34 51.95 A: that's true 

52.47 52.95 B: hum

78.42 85.16 A: when you do that more effecting your body that's your life and your role i mean other people might not like it but that's not their choice that's your choice 

78.50 79.06 B: yeah 

85.38 85.91 B: right 

86.36 92.99 A: but if that's the thing like you said your effecting other people so you should be worried about that 

93.89 95.14 B: yeah that's true 

95.32 95.91 B: hum 

98.03 100.31 B: i don't know yeah the others are bad but 

102.04 102.44 B: i just 

103.03 103.91 B: personal 

104.03 104.81 B: more than 

106.19 106.52 A: yeah 

106.21 107.91 B: gossiping so 

108.71 110.66 A: have you ever been a person to 

110.88 111.83 A: be hum 

112.02 113.29 A: one to be gossiped on 

113.83 115.34 A: have you ever had a bad experience with that 

115.22 116.42 B: huh yes 

116.52 120.12 A: yeah so have i i think that's why we both picked it yeah 

118.03 118.98 B: like everyone 

120.69 121.93 B: yeah hum 

123.17 125.87 B: i know last year like i'm in 

126.24 135.49 B: i'm a sophomore in college and last year i was on the swim team i ended up quitting this year but the girls were just terrible 

128.81 129.37 A: okay 

131.95 132.38 A: mm 

135.96 136.85 B: like talking 

137.34 140.16 B: so much crap about people behind their backs 

141.82 144.48 B: they'd form you know little clicks and then 

142.04 142.56 A: yeah 

145.14 149.81 B: i don't it was really bad so i couldn't deal with that and 

150.92 151.55 B: i don't know 

151.31 156.60 A: yeah i don't think i think people who gossip really have empty lives i don't really think 

156.77 159.06 A: i mean if you really thought about it and gossiping 

159.87 161.15 A: that's pretty lame 

161.27 165.15 A: yeah must not have your life must not be exciting enough if you have to gossip about some body else 

161.49 162.10 B: yeah 

165.34 166.58 B: yeah that is true 

167.39 170.50 A: what's that say about you being a person 

170.70 177.16 A: i know we all do it we all get around talk to our girlfriends and go hey did you see so and so do such and such to who who 

176.93 177.39 B: yeah 

177.27 185.63 A: but when you say and hurt somebody maliciously like you said about your swim team and every thing that's just just mean 

185.87 186.54 B: right 

186.62 195.54 A: why did they do that are they jealous because they can't they couldn't make the swim team or because they don't think swimming is cool that it's not worth anyone saying anything 

195.12 196.36 B: right i don't know 

197.40 200.35 B: yeah it seams people also i don't know if they 

201.24 207.11 B: or they'll make things up i guess to bring themselves up and bring the other person down and stuff like that 

207.74 208.88 A: yeah your right it's 

208.50 210.25 B: that's another reason why 

211.04 212.24 B: people do it i'm sure 

213.11 217.21 A: oh i'm sure or they don't have an exciting life on there own so they have to 

217.51 218.43 A: make up something 

218.58 219.15 B: right 

219.46 222.65 A: it's always fun talking about somebody else than yourself 

220.15 220.56 B: yeah 

222.47 223.82 B: right that's yeah 

223.97 231.65 B: but yeah i always like i if i start gossiping i catch myself cause i know how much i don't like when i'm gossiped about 

232.59 232.98 B: so 

232.94 244.44 A: yeah i i've done that myself where you've caught your self and you just automatically stop in the middle of a sentence going you know i wouldn't appreciate this if somebody was saying this about me so i'm just as wrong 

242.54 243.11 B: right 

243.83 245.58 B: right 

244.68 246.94 A: practice what you preach

329.23 330.57 A: in what your doing 

330.92 335.88 A: and she said to be quite honest she'd have no way to compare because she's never drank caffeine to know 

336.09 336.56 B: yeah 

336.69 338.23 B: they do it helps but 

338.45 339.08 B: i don't know 

340.00 345.16 A: what's it supposed to do slow down your reaction time or just another chemical in your body 

344.96 350.45 B: so i don't know i know increase alertness or maybe it increases reaction i don't 

348.36 352.04 A: oh okay okay

380.12 381.29 A: yeah 

381.73 392.15 A: yeah well i've never gotten into the coffee habit so i don't know about that part of it but i've heard about that i have a friend who has to have caffeine or she gets around with head aches 

394.78 396.16 B: hum okay 

396.39 398.28 A: how long do we usually have to talk for

408.48 409.08 B: hum 

409.48 415.74 A: oh that must be hard we'll i guess not cause you're on the swing team so you're really devote to that 

415.73 416.25 B: like 

416.58 419.00 B: the team would drink so much 

419.47 420.84 A: oh really 

420.75 422.52 B: it's yeah i couldn't 

423.41 424.46 B: you'd think that

427.61 428.07 A: mm 

428.76 432.12 B: so you know to keep up with training and not tier yourself 

432.60 434.82 B: anymore than you already are but 

435.70 436.17 A: huh 

436.75 440.58 B: yeah it's alcohol alcohol abuse is so big here 

440.79 447.27 A: yeah well that happens at all colleges and that's one of the big draws of college cause you get out of high school and you all like i'm a grown up now 

447.06 447.48 B: yup 

447.38 449.12 A: i can drink i can get whiled 

448.11 448.70 B: yeah

481.07 482.35 B: lately but 

483.99 484.50 A: oh okay 

484.76 485.73 A: but in your past you have 

486.29 486.71 B: yeah 

487.03 487.57 A: that's cool 

489.30 489.83 B: see

490.75 492.34 A: and they said caffeine 

492.49 493.60 A: smoking 

493.70 494.34 B: is 

494.12 497.99 A: being over weight is not good for you heart 

498.09 498.65 A: but 

498.53 499.14 B: right 

499.11 503.12 A: again a bodies choice and sometimes medically people can't help that 

503.26 504.11 B: that's true 

504.49 504.91 A: so 

506.57 507.49 B: hum 

508.29 509.69 B: not exercising 

510.26 510.75 A: okay 

512.27 515.80 B: hum yeah that's another personal choice guess 

516.23 516.63 A: mm 

517.93 520.05 A: i think everybody exercise in 

518.29 518.67 B: so 

520.16 526.91 A: some way even if they walk even just to go to the bathroom and back up it's some sort of exercise but i guess if they don't have a routine 

526.93 527.72 B: right 

529.97 532.66 B: and then i know how hard it can be to try to 

533.18 535.05 B: keep that up a lot of people 

536.12 538.89 B: will get into it for two weeks and then 

539.68 540.82 B: that's it 

541.16 541.60 A: yeah

549.03 549.66 B: oh 

549.86 551.13 A: you know 

550.57 552.44 B: well that's a good way to force 

552.02 555.69 A: yeah but i guess you have to keep a regiment 

555.88 556.68 A: being a plummer 

556.86 557.54 B: right 

558.85 559.18 A: so
