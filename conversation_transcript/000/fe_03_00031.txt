60.99 63.97 A: i definitely get sick sometimes especially when the seasons change 

64.19 66.26 B: like in summer or um 

64.46 64.84 A: so 

66.74 67.18 B: winter 

67.44 67.99 A: um 

68.16 70.37 A: or when it gets colder i think and in the springtime too 

70.85 71.31 B: okay 

71.39 71.76 A: hello 

72.14 74.96 B: well not that i think about it i i cannot get uh sick 

75.52 76.36 B: during the 

76.54 76.96 B: (( )) 

77.49 78.57 B: because of the pollen 

79.21 80.03 A: oh yeah 

79.91 82.44 B: and i get i may get some alle- allergies and 

83.07 83.90 B: stuffy nose and 

83.12 83.50 A: yeah 

85.16 85.82 A: i guess that 

86.13 87.15 A: different 

86.72 87.20 B: yeah but 

87.46 88.97 B: i don't really get sick at all 

92.51 92.81 A: hm 

92.96 95.28 B: so what do you think of this saying 

96.41 98.32 A: oh about a cold lasting 

98.33 99.29 B: yes seven days 

98.80 101.37 A: seven days and a week if you go to a doctor 

101.34 101.80 B: right 

102.51 103.74 B: i didn't really understand what it mean 

103.84 106.03 A: (( )) either 

106.80 110.44 A: um i think it basically means that there's really nothing you can do about a cold 

110.84 112.65 A: going to a doctor they can tell you that they'll 

112.78 114.70 A: change something but they really don't 

112.92 114.03 B: uh okay ok 

116.99 117.47 B: (( )) 

117.12 118.50 A: i don't know i don't really feel like it's 

118.73 121.32 A: worthwhile going to a doctor for a cold that's for sure 

121.35 121.81 B: yeah 

121.61 124.00 A: unless you think it might be something more serious 

125.76 126.92 A: i don't know i went 

127.27 127.85 A: um 

128.28 129.86 A: i went to the doctor last 

130.85 131.60 A: semester 

131.98 135.07 A: for i guess it was really just a bad cold but i thought i had um 

135.98 139.06 A: strep throat or something because my throat was just really hurting more than usual 

140.78 141.08 A: um 

141.64 143.44 A: about the only reason i can think of 

143.65 145.71 B: well i had to go to doctor last week 

146.80 147.15 A: yeah 

147.37 149.43 B: well i had this weird pain in my chest 

149.93 150.63 A: oh really 

150.64 151.59 B: and then 

152.53 153.45 B: i had this 

153.89 156.33 B: my my left hand started to be numb 

157.28 157.79 A: really 

157.38 159.84 B: i was kind of i was like what this is kind of weird 

160.56 161.18 A: (( )) 

160.76 162.60 B: you know the left hand 

163.12 163.75 B: hard and 

164.50 164.86 B: all these 

166.79 170.00 B: do mean they're supposed to mean you may get a heart attack or something 

169.77 172.82 A: yeah that's what i was just thinking those are the exact symptoms for a heart attack 

171.23 171.96 B: yeah 

172.98 176.23 B: so so i went to the doctor and they say no it's you're just fine 

176.56 176.93 A: really 

176.62 178.74 B: well i'm twenty four year years old so 

179.77 181.16 A: that'd be pretty early to be getting 

180.80 183.65 B: that would pretty early so i went to the doctor and they say well 

184.59 186.65 B: no you're heart is fine your lungs are fine 

187.19 190.65 B: you just uh maybe you hurt yourself uh sleeping right 

191.35 191.91 A: wow 

193.20 194.52 A: that's kind of frightening 

195.52 196.70 A: you lift weights 

196.66 197.44 B: yeah i do 

197.73 198.54 B: i go to a gym 

198.97 200.02 A: oh really for uh 

199.80 200.35 B: (( )) 

200.16 201.46 A: you play a sport or just 

201.83 202.54 B: just for 

203.03 204.24 B: keeping shape in shape 

204.89 205.16 A: yeah 

205.44 206.18 A: that's really good 

207.47 209.41 A: (( )) a lot to do with staying healthy too 

210.34 213.40 A: taking care of your body like exercising lifting that sort of thing 

212.98 213.45 B: yeah 

214.41 216.08 A: i don't know i find i stay healthier when i'm 

216.26 216.92 A: working out 

217.83 219.75 A: or it helps me feel better when i'm sick too 

220.16 221.42 B: you work out frequently 

222.17 223.68 A: um i try to 

224.15 227.53 A: not right now preparing for finals but you know normally 

228.79 229.97 B: cool so you go to school 

230.37 230.91 A: yeah 

231.40 232.18 B: rhode island 

231.41 231.85 A: i'm a student 

232.63 233.02 A: hm mhm 

233.16 234.27 B: university of rhode island 

234.68 235.95 A: brown university actually 

236.25 236.60 B: oh 

236.66 237.26 A: in providence 

240.95 243.10 B: so what about this topic i don't know what else to say 

243.25 245.36 A: i'm not sure 

246.30 246.94 A: um 

246.36 246.76 B: um 

247.86 248.64 B: seasons seasons 

248.78 249.91 A: (( )) do people get 

248.83 249.51 B: i like seasons 

250.11 253.65 A: sick more often with the change of the seasons i think they do um 

253.18 254.44 B: yeah yeah mostly 

255.34 256.62 A: especially now like 

257.17 258.04 A: universities 

258.34 264.44 A: turning up the heat because it just got really cold and then air is really dry inside buildings and everyone's just feeling kind of gross 

263.43 266.29 B: and the the change in in temperature among 

266.75 268.86 B: the rooms and then outside and then 

269.32 269.83 A: yeah 

269.37 270.20 B: to go back 

270.55 271.23 B: or forward 

271.89 273.28 A: just sort of screws up your system 

275.20 275.64 A: i don't know 

275.60 277.33 B: but it's only during the winter 

277.91 278.99 B: other than that i don't think 

279.56 282.11 A: i don't know i think during the spring people get sick too 

282.53 283.43 B: what why is that 

284.14 284.70 A: um 

285.45 286.01 A: again just 

286.64 288.81 A: drastic changes in temperature maybe 

289.71 293.67 A: the first spring in new england is so unpredictable it could be like fifty one day 

293.86 294.54 B: yeah yeah 

294.26 296.03 A: seventy the next you can't tell 

297.16 297.83 A: or forty 

298.06 298.68 A: and this first 

298.83 300.67 A: snow storm really took me by surprise 

301.18 302.31 A: of course this is the fall but 

302.93 303.72 A: same sort of thing 

308.86 309.38 B: well 

309.53 312.07 B: so how long are we supposed to talk 

311.64 316.32 A: i think like ten minutes i wasn't timing this i don't know if they're going to tell us when ten minutes is up or not 

316.17 316.70 B: ok 

318.00 320.10 B: so what else can we say about this 

323.31 323.61 B: huh 

324.14 325.59 B: very interesting topic 

326.04 327.82 A: no it wasn't the most interesting one 

330.92 336.33 A: i'm just glad we didn't get like something really complex and political or we would have just been like no i don't feel like it 

335.81 336.32 B: well 

336.59 339.86 B: i would rather that so we ha- we'll have tha- something to talk about 

339.65 340.87 A: yeah that's true 

343.04 344.58 B: so how did you get into this study 

345.74 346.09 A: sorry 

346.26 347.85 B: how did you get into this study 

349.69 349.95 A: (( )) 

350.45 352.69 A: oh um i just got an email and i was like 

353.11 353.49 A: hey 

353.68 355.19 A: okay sure 

355.01 355.77 B: sure ten dollars 

356.34 356.73 A: yeah 

357.19 358.76 A: well i'm actually um 

359.09 361.74 A: uh cognitive science psycholinguistics concentrator 

361.92 362.42 B: uh huh 

362.33 370.52 A: and so like i don't mind helping with linguistic studies that's kind of cool and i was working on an experiment myself this semester and i've been utterly frustrated with 

371.15 375.01 A: the lack of responses to surveys i've been sending out so 

374.90 376.28 B: yeah i i i actually 

375.12 377.38 A: i'm i'm now all about responding 

377.19 379.21 B: yeah that's that's right actually it (( )) 

379.64 381.32 B: kind of the same reason i i work in 

381.71 382.92 B: information retrieval 

383.26 383.84 A: oh yeah 

384.83 385.49 A: oh wow 

385.71 386.03 B: so 

386.20 386.68 B: yeah 

386.93 388.77 B: usually it's really hard to get data 

389.05 389.74 A: yeah 

391.21 393.10 B: you know (( )) in the actual experiment 

394.53 394.78 A: yeah 

395.25 396.67 B: yeah so you study linguistics 

397.55 401.00 A: sort of i i'm not like a formal linguistics concentrator but 

401.11 402.52 A: psycholinguistics so it's like 

403.02 404.52 A: language and the mind sort of thing 

405.26 407.47 A: i've done i've taken some straight linguistics classes 

408.96 409.33 A: you said 

410.51 411.66 A: you're information retrieval 

411.77 412.16 B: yeah 

412.78 415.95 A: that's pretty cool are you working for a company right now or are you still studying 

415.55 416.78 B: i work for (( )) 

417.53 418.22 A: oh wow 

417.88 420.38 B: i work for uh a research center there 

421.25 422.00 A: that's really cool 

422.16 422.73 B: so i 

422.95 423.66 B: do research 

425.35 425.61 A: huh 

425.70 428.09 B: and then on the side i go part time to school 

429.05 429.53 A: oh ok 

429.23 430.16 B: but you know the 

430.94 432.90 B: everything i'm saying is going to be recorded and 

433.12 435.06 B: everybody is going to know 

435.93 437.11 B: what we're talking about 

437.81 438.48 A: yeah 

438.84 439.67 A: well that's alright 

440.74 441.05 B: so 

441.16 441.92 B: um 

443.64 444.75 B: what else can we say about this 

445.11 445.54 B: i don't know 

447.41 451.46 A: i don't know it's not a very stimulating topic we might have talked for ten minutes i'm not sure 

452.19 452.68 B: you think 

453.43 454.18 A: i don't know 

455.70 457.61 A: keep talking a little longer 

457.77 461.94 A: i'm not really sure where they need us to talk on topic necessarily i mean if they just 

462.10 462.87 A: looking for 

463.78 465.70 A: discourse pragmatics or something 

465.82 466.34 B: uh huh 

465.84 468.37 A: i should think that talking about any sort of topic would be 

469.09 469.49 B: really 

469.43 469.99 A: sufficient 

469.77 472.60 B: i i i was yeah i was trying to read it over the email 

473.07 473.44 A: yeah 

473.51 476.03 B: and yeah maybe they're just want to 

476.92 477.76 B: for you to talk 

477.95 478.77 B: about anything 

479.65 480.22 B: but maybe 

481.17 481.67 B: that will 

481.93 482.72 B: lead to 

483.26 484.56 B: ambiguity because 

485.65 487.35 B: if you're going to do some testing on a 

487.59 487.88 B: on a 

488.56 490.79 B: conversation that is supposed to be about something 

491.29 493.96 B: and the people are just talking about their life 

494.95 495.46 B: which 

495.77 496.46 B: is going to be 

496.83 498.60 B: the case of most of the conversation 

499.51 500.61 B: i don't think you can really 

501.54 503.68 B: (( )) research in there 

504.33 504.82 A: maybe 

505.18 506.41 A: i don't know i guess i can't 

506.83 507.77 A: i certainly don't know 

508.34 510.16 A: what they're aiming for in this study 

510.63 510.93 A: so 

512.33 513.18 A: maybe they'll tell us 

518.85 519.22 B: uh 

519.47 524.13 A: i don't know i don't really know how they expected us to talk about the weather and illness for ten minutes 

525.96 527.93 A: yeah it sometimes get cold 

526.35 527.59 B: the weather and illness 

528.58 530.76 A: i don't know my friend right next door has like suddenly 

531.13 532.35 A: came with the flu 

533.33 534.57 A: and not really sure 

533.93 535.14 B: have you ever gotten the flu 

535.93 537.92 A: i haven't actually thank god 

538.23 539.60 B: i'm i never had it before 

540.29 540.69 A: yeah 

540.87 541.90 B: (( )) like something 

543.57 546.88 A: it's one of those things that tend to go around in places like college dorms 

552.92 553.30 B: yeah 

555.61 556.18 B: yeah (( )) 

557.53 558.11 B: (( )) that 

559.36 560.65 B: do you get ill frequently 

561.54 564.39 A: um i get colds occasionally not that frequently 

565.57 566.61 A: i sometimes 

567.45 569.17 A: i don't know yeah i don't really get ill all that often 

569.61 571.58 A: i don't know over the summer i had lyme's disease 

571.71 572.68 A: that was sort of bad 

578.01 579.03 B: so you live in providence

618.16 619.15 B: yeah 

618.33 619.26 A: it being there 

620.49 621.10 A: no big deal
