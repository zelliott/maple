364.89 365.50 B: yeah 

367.05 370.09 A: nothing more to pay for the orange juice i supposed 

369.92 372.51 B: i know 

370.68 373.50 A: oh you know what that's one thing i've been doing i 

373.73 375.38 A: i buy i bought huh 

375.52 377.46 A: hum an orange juice presser 

377.77 387.13 A: like a citrus squeezer from target i got one really cheap and i buy tangerines and i make fresh orange juice every day so maybe the fresh 

377.87 378.58 B: huh 

386.78 389.06 B: oh how do you make fresh oranges 

389.29 391.74 A: oh it's just so go well they have these 

391.86 392.54 A: powerized 

393.73 397.03 A: i plug it in it has a motor in it you slice the orange in half 

396.96 397.49 B: mm 

397.15 400.67 A: and you stick on top this cone shaped object that spins around 

401.03 401.87 A: and it pulls 

401.32 402.01 B: oh 

402.55 402.93 A: and it 

403.23 406.85 A: picks all the pulp and every thing off the orange so that when you pull the 

408.82 409.31 A: the half 

409.71 411.58 A: orange part the rind away 

411.56 412.14 B: yeah 

411.69 414.66 A: the insides are all scooped out and the juice 

415.35 416.23 A: falls into a 

416.55 416.96 A: huh 

418.02 418.92 A: huh container that's 

419.21 429.48 A: it makes the coon shaped devises it filters through and you can adjust the amount of pulp that you want in there and everything but i got it at target for fifteen dollars and it's really 

430.13 430.52 A: i get 

430.65 434.72 A: i get four pounds of tangerines for a dollar fifty so i think it 

433.73 434.75 B: that's nice 

435.04 439.56 A: it works out about the same and from what i understand fresh squeezed orange juice has always 

439.68 446.64 A: the best way to get your vitamin c. i'm not sure if that's true or not i mean obviously fresh fruit is better than anything for you 

446.75 447.44 B: yeah 

448.07 448.43 A: so 

449.16 451.85 A: so i guess i do employ that method 

452.65 453.30 B: yeah 

453.61 454.10 A: yeah 

457.02 458.02 B: so is hum
