12.81 15.76 A: illness yeah what do you do to stay away from the germs 

20.63 25.44 B: but um i take vitamins i just started because everyone is getting sick around here 

26.33 28.21 A: oh really so what about flu shot 

28.84 29.52 A: things like that 

30.07 32.79 B: i haven't gotten a flu shot but i probably should 

33.57 33.98 A: uh huh 

33.65 35.80 B: i never get the flu though so i'm not too worried 

36.47 36.82 A: no 

37.12 39.93 A: me neither i haven't been ill in the united states 

40.04 41.10 A: for let me see 

41.56 44.10 A: probably three years and i've been here for three years and a half 

44.49 44.86 B: mhm 

45.45 47.20 A: so yeah i don't get sick too often 

47.77 49.49 A: but i do a lot of sports 

49.68 51.95 A: and you know i have a healthy lifestyle 

52.73 55.08 B: that's good i think that has a lot to do with it 

55.50 57.06 B: getting enough sleep and everything 

57.65 57.99 A: yeah 

58.59 60.69 A: yeah i don't know about the sleep but you know 

60.96 63.22 A: healthy like healthy food and stuff like that 

63.72 66.71 B: yeah for me i always get sick after something 

67.16 77.52 B: big that happens um that's kind of stressful is over like after exams are over or um after i have a big project that's over or a big competition something like that 

78.06 78.94 A: after it's over 

79.40 79.82 B: mhm 

80.61 81.04 A: yeah 

82.41 85.25 A: yeah so stress so it's related to stress when you get sick 

84.68 85.55 B: yeah definitely 

86.26 90.19 A: yeah well no i i handle stress pretty well i usually you find stress 

90.88 96.08 A: or maybe what you say is right because if i'm stressed i i don't get sick but afterwards maybe i do 

96.58 97.65 A: go down with something 

98.13 99.53 B: yeah that's the same with me 

100.10 103.89 A: right yeah so you relax and then you sit and relaxes and 

104.62 105.80 A: the germs have uh 

106.17 107.28 A: a way to play with your body 

107.88 111.49 B: yeah it's better than getting sick while it's going on though i guess 

111.96 112.38 A: yeah 

113.90 114.46 A: so it be 

113.93 117.30 B: one of my friend alway is an actor and he always gets sick 

117.54 119.16 B: right before the performance 

120.29 123.17 A: yeah but that what kind of thing that's like psychological 

124.83 125.47 B: uh 

125.02 125.38 A: does he get 

125.46 126.49 A: stressed out or 

125.80 128.33 B: yeah yeah like he'll get the stomach flu 

129.46 130.34 A: stomach flu yeah like 

130.67 131.58 A: he stomach hurt 

132.11 132.52 B: yeah 

132.16 132.79 A: he's nervous 

133.83 134.23 B: yeah 

135.01 135.68 A: did you ever act 

136.62 137.97 B: yeah i have a little bit 

138.44 138.82 A: uh huh 

139.36 140.15 B: when i was younger 

140.55 141.80 B: i liked it it was fun 

142.35 143.09 A: yeah me too 

143.88 144.84 B: but i wasn't that good 

145.89 147.72 A: yeah me neither 

149.96 151.09 A: yeah so um 

152.33 155.95 A: um do you know how this works we have to keep talking about uh illness 

156.36 159.17 B: i don't know what's going on i was just wondering the same thing 

159.85 160.30 A: uh huh 

160.63 162.93 A: well i don't know what else can we talk about illness 

163.60 164.45 A: what about genomic 

164.83 165.98 A: are you interested in genomic 

166.13 167.78 B: yeah i think it's very interesting 

168.35 168.79 A: yeah 

169.51 174.80 A: so did you read the newspaper that they said that the mouse gene is similar to the uh 

174.97 175.67 A: human gene 

175.96 176.50 B: mhm 

176.55 177.79 A: like ninety-nine percent 

178.10 179.45 B: yeah that was surprising 

179.79 182.20 A: that was surprising i've i have known that forever 

182.74 186.52 B: well i mean i didn't think it was that high i suspected probably ninety percent 

182.80 183.21 A: uh 

187.71 188.43 A: ninety percent 

187.73 191.20 B: because they're so what chimpanzees are ninety-nine percent also 

191.65 193.17 B: so i thought a mouse would be less 

193.88 195.37 A: well actually a lot of 

195.47 196.68 A: uh living organisms 

197.28 198.89 A: (( )) for example mammals 

199.56 201.28 A: we are very very similar like 

201.51 202.88 A: what they say ninety-nine percent 

203.12 203.54 B: mhm 

203.18 208.44 A: i have uh um one of my co-workers here is involved in the genome project 

208.92 209.33 B: mhm 

209.03 209.62 A: so um 

210.17 211.09 A: and she said you know 

211.19 212.04 A: the same thing 

212.53 212.89 B: hm 

213.19 215.86 A: they so you know they can use uh rat for whatever 

216.27 216.71 B: mhm 

217.50 219.56 B: i guess that's why they can do research with them 

217.58 218.10 A: (( )) 

219.85 220.76 B: on drugs and things 

220.15 220.42 A: right 

220.93 224.50 A: well yeah that's the important uh thing is to actually do 

224.86 229.67 A: research on mice that they can reproduce fast and then they they have a short life cycle 

229.98 230.36 B: uh huh 

230.01 232.96 A: actually i don't know how what is life cycle but they can make you reproduce 

233.67 235.27 A: many times so they see what 

234.67 235.05 B: yeah 

235.40 236.60 A: uh the gene that 

236.71 238.27 A: for some that modify a gene then 

238.80 242.43 A: and that uh you they need to test over generations to see what happens 

243.15 244.45 B: yeah makes it easier 

245.01 247.17 A: yeah they were using also flies 

247.63 249.76 A: to test this kind of stuff because you know they 

247.74 248.18 B: mhm 

248.68 248.93 B: hm 

250.26 251.20 A: reproduce so fast 

251.66 252.05 B: yeah 

252.69 254.46 A: oops my mother's trying to chat with me 

254.78 255.29 B: oh 

255.92 259.24 A: so do you have an idea how long we need to talk or is it just 

258.94 261.61 B: i don't know i think it said one to three minutes or something 

262.21 262.98 A: one to three minutes 

263.51 264.20 B: i think so 

264.67 267.13 A: yeah i think i have a meeting like uh 

267.34 268.53 A: five but that's okay

276.86 277.62 A: oh okay 

277.82 278.95 B: that's how i heard about this 

277.83 278.47 A: so uh 

279.64 280.05 A: uh huh 

280.29 281.04 A: at stanford 

281.71 282.59 B: no i'm in harvard 

283.10 283.79 A: oh harvard 

284.10 284.54 B: mhm 

285.48 286.83 A: yeah i work also linguistics 

287.00 288.96 A: well not linguistics linguistics but it 

289.07 289.61 A: on 

289.74 290.66 A: speech recognition 

290.94 291.47 B: oh uh huh 

291.84 293.82 A: that's why they they send me this e. mail 

294.61 298.57 A: it's uh i do applications in speech recognitions we have like several linguistics 

298.94 299.37 A: linguists 

299.95 300.33 A: here 

300.59 301.72 A: uh in the lab working 

301.85 302.23 A: with us 

303.11 303.48 B: sure 

303.90 304.89 B: and you're at stanford 

305.94 307.34 A: no um 

307.48 309.98 A: no i got my degree in argentina then i came here 

310.43 311.12 B: oh i see 

312.17 312.49 A: yeah 

312.87 314.00 A: and i've been here since 

314.71 315.93 A: working the same company 

317.39 318.85 B: are but you're on the west coast 

319.92 321.39 A: i'm uh west coast yeah 

321.84 322.12 B: yeah 

323.35 324.95 B: cause you said it was five o'clock 

325.75 326.39 A: yeah it's five 

327.00 327.74 B: five yeah

334.52 334.85 B: what 

334.59 336.63 A: the the (( )) is going to have uh 

336.94 339.54 A: a hell of a time to recognize what we're saying 

341.93 348.11 A: you know you know working in speech you know that you have to constrain as much as possible so that's why uh 

348.44 349.30 A: choose a subject 

349.70 350.16 B: yeah 

350.55 351.75 A: um illness 

351.95 352.93 A: so then you have 

353.27 354.06 A: uh you know 

354.22 355.94 A: all the words that you would use in illness 

356.52 357.73 A: sickness and stuff like that 

358.33 358.72 B: uh huh 

358.53 359.43 A: and um 

359.82 362.47 A: otherwise if you start chatting about any- everything 

363.12 363.81 A: then uh 

363.99 367.21 A: it is more difficult for the assistant to determine what the heck is going on 

367.65 368.12 B: right 

368.37 369.33 A: but anyway 

368.64 370.84 B: oh well we made it hard for them 

371.53 371.91 A: yeah 

372.59 374.46 A: okay anyway i i think i will 

374.88 375.35 A: i'll just
