66.36 68.71 A: i didn't but this year um 

69.22 73.60 A: where i work they have an incentive if you don't use any sick days you get a five hundred dollar bonus 

73.70 74.49 B: wow that's great 

74.35 76.55 A: and if you only use one you get three hundred bucks 

76.86 77.34 B: wow 

77.62 78.11 A: so 

78.95 80.54 A: almost everyone that i work with 

80.72 84.19 A: decided to get the flu shot because it's certainly worth the investment 

84.54 85.65 A: of the twelve bucks 

85.20 86.84 B: yeah oh yeah 

86.61 88.64 A: in an attempt to get the five hundred 

88.75 89.18 B: yeah 

88.98 89.38 A: so 

89.60 91.17 A: and we can use vacation days 

91.76 92.56 B: oh okay 

91.85 93.32 A: but we just can't use 

93.70 94.58 B: sick days 

93.73 94.28 A: sick days 

94.94 95.57 A: it's well if you 

95.75 96.42 A: plan ahead 

97.11 97.88 A: it's a nice 

98.36 99.68 A: nice way to try and get some money 

99.91 101.24 B: well that's that's pretty cool 

101.49 102.76 B: wow i've nev- never heard 

101.59 101.94 A: so 

102.30 104.88 A: i did get i mean i have a little case of the sniffles 

105.12 105.64 B: right 

105.17 107.06 A: i don't think i have a cold yet 

107.46 107.81 B: right 

107.57 110.76 A: cause i think you know that's a little bit bigger than the sniffles but i 

111.19 111.73 A: i seem to 

111.93 113.28 A: always get sick 

113.45 114.83 A: when the seasons change 

114.22 115.68 B: yeah i 

115.91 119.48 B: i don't know if it's most necessarily the seasons change but 

119.96 123.38 B: down here we have like a lot of drastic weather changes 

124.43 125.41 B: like it'll be 

124.57 125.20 A: that's trouble 

126.27 127.03 B: um 

127.57 130.94 B: you know the really cold one day and it'll warm up 

131.55 133.46 B: that's when i don't do well that's 

133.80 135.88 B: that's when i have a tendency to get sick 

136.28 138.41 A: i think i get even more sick 

138.85 142.17 A: um between the change like the spring 

142.49 142.89 B: mhm 

143.28 144.74 A: when all of the 

145.66 152.23 A: like allergies i tend to get allergies so when everything starts to come back out all the leaves and flowers then 

146.86 147.34 B: (( )) 

148.00 148.75 B: yeah i do too 

152.49 152.83 B: right 

152.63 154.01 A: that's my biggest 

154.62 157.48 A: headache i hate it and i won't get allergy 

158.25 162.65 A: i won't get an allergy test because i don't want to have allergy shots for the rest of my life 

162.70 163.20 B: yeah 

163.07 163.99 A: it's not something 

165.40 166.42 B: yeah it's um 

166.01 167.06 A: i want to depend on 

167.38 167.82 B: right 

167.96 170.22 B: yeah i guess i have allergies as well 

170.77 173.10 B: i guess i don't consider that being sick 

173.59 174.09 A: really 

174.55 175.11 B: yeah 

174.68 174.97 A: (( )) 

175.20 177.25 A: for me it's just annoying i get 

177.72 180.28 A: like my eyes will itch and 

180.71 181.97 A: i'll get a cold of sorts 

182.75 183.42 A: i 

184.27 186.68 A: i never get sick sick i don't think 

187.16 187.81 A: i haven't had the 

187.91 188.94 A: flu since i was 

190.83 191.38 A: four 

191.87 192.42 B: really 

192.07 194.77 A: i haven't thrown up since i was four i feel like jerry seinfeld 

193.83 194.27 B: wow 

195.65 196.66 A: you know i never 

197.01 198.20 A: get ill like that 

198.80 199.13 B: huh 

199.67 203.27 A: so for me i think tha- that's what i consider sick just because i never 

203.50 204.06 B: yeah 

204.43 204.88 B: yeah 

204.61 205.33 A: really sick 

205.17 205.56 B: right 

206.13 206.73 B: yeah 

206.30 206.56 A: and 

207.06 208.71 A: i'd like to think that 

209.01 212.64 A: maybe it's because i have a healthy lifestyle but i think 

213.25 214.65 A: probably that's hardly it 

214.96 215.39 A: i eat 

215.68 217.50 A: whole lot of ice cream and 

219.28 220.77 A: i work my second job 

220.94 222.44 A: is at like an ice cream 

222.64 224.31 A: well i work at the gift shop 

224.46 225.05 A: part of it 

224.78 225.03 B: okay 

225.71 226.11 A: um 

226.73 227.04 A: but 

227.54 228.98 A: (( )) i'll just 

229.15 230.16 A: stop by work and 

230.45 231.35 A: grab a scoop of ice cream 

231.45 231.81 B: right 

232.31 238.45 B: it's so addictive i mean i that's actually when i have when i have uh when i am sick that's one of the few things that i will eat 

239.07 239.82 A: oh 

240.57 240.98 A: that's 

241.76 245.00 B: oddly enough like i i got i got a really bad 

245.09 246.15 B: flu last year 

248.32 249.19 B: kicked in like 

249.77 250.87 B: christmas eve 

250.91 251.40 A: (( )) 

252.12 253.87 B: and it did not i mean i was 

255.07 257.16 B: i was dyin- i hadn't been that sick 

258.14 258.56 B: in 

259.13 261.69 B: i don't think i've ever gotten hit that hard 

261.83 262.08 B: that's 

262.25 265.07 B: and i had gotten flu shots the couple years prior 

265.72 267.78 B: last year i di- i didn't get around to it 

270.85 273.88 B: i got hit so hard i don't think i've never been that sick 

273.94 274.46 A: wow 

274.71 277.24 B: like the just this raging fever and 

277.89 278.32 B: really 

279.28 280.34 B: it put me down 

281.17 281.93 B: for a good 

282.94 283.96 B: eight days 

284.38 285.53 A: holy crow 

285.25 285.98 B: but i think 

286.33 291.76 B: you know in hindsight i think psychologically because we were off i was i was off that we- we were uh 

292.17 293.04 B: where where i work 

293.30 293.76 B: closed 

294.61 295.00 B: uh 

297.19 299.81 B: for that week so i think psychologically i think i was 

300.26 305.10 B: probably allow it maybe allowed it to put me down like i don't know what would have happened if i had 

303.70 304.04 A: yeah 

305.57 306.90 B: pressure of having to you 

305.88 306.52 A: you had to 

306.78 307.76 A: that's how i feel 

308.15 308.52 A: feel like 

309.15 311.26 A: this ye- last year i didn't use any sick days 

311.58 312.60 A: but the only bonus was 

312.95 314.49 A: fifty bucks a restaurant 

314.69 315.26 B: right yeah 

314.84 315.42 A: but i just 

315.67 317.46 A: i not a person that gets sick 

318.03 318.61 A: and 

318.99 319.90 A: this year 

320.46 324.18 A: i have told people even if my legs fall off i'm coming in to work 

324.12 325.33 B: yeah five hundred is 

324.53 325.37 A: and that's how 

325.83 328.24 A: a lot of people are i mean that's a month's rent 

328.58 329.57 B: yeah (( )) 

329.99 330.34 B: yeah 

330.49 332.80 A: so i think like i will not let myself 

333.37 335.32 A: get sick this year i'd lost my voice 

335.75 336.08 B: right 

336.17 336.60 A: and 

336.92 337.68 A: i still 

337.91 338.72 A: i went in 

339.04 341.43 A: and i had to have my students watch a video 

341.60 342.62 A: i couldn't speak 

343.41 344.02 A: and so 

344.11 346.95 A: you know i passed out the papers and i turned on the video and 

347.61 348.85 A: then it wasn't really an effective 

349.04 349.44 B: right 

349.34 350.07 A: way of teaching 

350.29 350.79 B: yeah 

350.35 350.63 A: but 

351.09 351.89 A: i feel like 

352.21 353.55 A: well that got something 

353.99 354.61 A: and i think 

355.03 357.77 A: in a way it's kind of going to be a little bit detrimental 

358.40 361.37 A: to some people because i'm going if i do get sick 

361.61 362.74 A: heck i'll share it 

362.83 363.24 B: right 

363.37 364.71 A: come on in 

364.33 365.20 B: right 

364.82 365.81 A: get sick for me 

366.49 366.87 A: so 

366.52 366.91 B: yep 

367.21 368.82 B: yeah you said you teach 

368.92 369.21 A: yeah 

369.78 370.99 B: uh at what level 

371.26 373.02 A: i teach junior high spanish 

373.04 373.64 B: oh okay 

373.85 377.23 B: yeah i teach i actually teach german at at the univer- at the university level 

377.28 378.74 A: oh i took 

379.22 381.51 A: i don't know i thought i was going to have a german minor 

382.15 383.44 A: in college but then 

385.23 387.76 A: mixed with another class i needed for graduation 

387.88 388.80 B: oh yeah 

388.10 388.94 A: and so 

389.23 390.31 A: couldn't do it unl- 

390.45 392.99 A: i feel sad now i feel like the only things 

393.40 393.76 A: i could 

394.42 395.64 A: count and do such bas- 

396.98 397.32 A: but 

398.10 401.39 B: well that's uh yeah that now that actually what you're like that 

401.52 404.59 B: that actually really makes me leery of being sick because 

405.20 407.18 B: then you have to cancel classes 

407.65 410.93 A: that is true i think it's different for me i call up and i get a sub 

411.59 412.25 A: so tough 

411.77 412.13 B: right 

412.69 413.29 A: because 

413.55 415.53 A: the substitute for the most part 

415.80 417.31 A: they're not going to speak spanish 

418.07 422.68 A: and that's going to be such a wasted day for those students i might as well go in and at least 

420.31 420.58 B: right 

422.98 423.73 A: i know where 

424.10 425.39 A: how to get a v._c._r. 

425.64 426.21 B: yeah 

425.96 427.03 A: i mean my movies are 

427.16 428.60 A: relevant they're either 

429.23 430.13 A: cultural 

430.31 430.67 A: or 

430.98 433.15 A: in spanish and i mean even if it's just 

433.28 436.04 A: like i have them watch rug rats or dora the explorer 

435.04 435.40 B: right 

436.17 436.52 B: right 

436.44 436.83 A: or 

437.24 438.52 A: you know something in 

438.97 439.82 A: the language 

440.01 445.22 A: but it seems like we have a lot of kids i come in contact with so many people 

444.62 449.10 B: oh it's awful yeah even at the university level i get sick i mean i come in to class 

449.32 450.08 B: sometimes 

450.21 453.76 B: and everyone likes you you get the i always have the students who are always oh you 

453.87 455.57 B: then they're coughing all over you 

454.86 455.59 A: (( )) 

456.14 457.59 B: like what are you doing here 

457.98 458.32 A: yeah 

458.45 459.00 B: you know like 

458.63 459.63 A: and i think they're 

459.94 460.53 A: held 

460.63 466.02 A: at this level where my students the parents send them they have no place else for them to go 

465.04 466.39 B: yeah that's true right 

466.25 469.00 A: so they send their kids in ill and 

469.69 474.58 A: your students their paying to be there or there attendance policies and they feel very pressured 

474.32 474.66 B: right 

475.04 479.36 B: yeah i always tell th- i mean my attendance policy is if you're sick stay home 

479.61 480.08 B: because 

480.27 483.32 B: i don't want to get you know i don't want to get sick because they know that 

483.68 484.17 B: hell i've 

484.37 487.18 B: ran uh uh uh a dorm for a while 

487.36 487.82 A: (( )) 

487.61 488.75 B: (( )) in 

488.98 490.59 B: that was just like 

491.11 493.29 B: i mean you talk about getting sick 

493.41 494.63 A: that certainly breeds 

494.77 496.68 B: you know that just breeds illness 

494.92 495.36 A: illness 

496.20 497.54 A: it just runs rampant 

497.61 498.58 B: you know because 

498.98 499.73 B: they don't the 

502.14 502.56 B: yeah 

502.73 506.64 B: it just (( )) you're right it runs rampant especially cause we used to eat together 

507.01 507.50 A: (( )) that 

507.50 508.76 B: at night and that was just 

510.66 511.02 B: um 

510.69 515.17 A: i do for the most part especially i think in the winter i try to eat 

515.61 516.57 A: more balanced 

517.23 518.71 A: meals and certainly 

519.01 520.01 A: when i feel myself 

520.77 522.27 A: starting to become ill 

522.51 525.13 A: i'm like oh need the vitamin c i got to have oranges 

525.27 525.72 B: yeah 

525.78 526.93 A: and i i do the 

527.46 527.87 A: um 

528.31 530.08 A: the what is it feed a fever starve a cold 

530.30 530.63 B: right 

531.07 532.52 A: and so i try that 

531.15 531.43 B: yeah 

532.91 534.61 A: and i also certainly 

535.57 538.16 A: seems like if i go to the doctor it gets worse 

538.66 541.27 A: it's always it gets worse before it gets better 

538.79 539.32 B: yeah 

541.29 541.79 B: right 

542.00 543.02 A: and sometimes 

543.35 544.50 A: i think in hindsight 

545.07 547.27 A: i will be very sick and i will wait 

547.36 549.71 A: and i'll finally drag myself to the doctor 

549.80 550.21 B: mhm 

549.95 553.60 A: and i think i made it last longer i should've gone in the very beginning 

553.53 555.58 B: yeah that's what that's what i end up 

555.95 559.57 B: doing too my yeah my remedy is i eat garlic 

559.82 560.77 A: oh 

560.81 563.84 B: whenever i fe- whenever i feel an illness coming on it's
