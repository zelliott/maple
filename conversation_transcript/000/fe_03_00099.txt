308.52 321.62 B: on t._v. after even after the contest is finished and the winner is you know they take it real personally i guess and or just just they play along with the game you know 

321.15 326.13 A: wow so in turkey they actually show the american show big brother

343.88 346.48 A: [laughter] 

346.25 357.21 B: and i don't believe it's also fair you know like i think that ah the broadcasting company manipulates stuff in those shows to 

356.93 358.37 A: yeah 

357.40 360.19 B: to make it more interesting to the public 

360.57 364.96 A: wow so why do you think people watch shows like this 

364.75 372.56 B: ju- i mean it's i don't know the psychological you know term for that but it's some sort of 

372.87 376.86 B: like perversion i can tell you know voyeurism 

376.59 377.70 A: uh-huh 

377.38 382.02 B: and to feel better about yourself by watching 

382.12 387.26 B: you know screw up screwed up people like that you know 

387.73 392.38 B: you think oh i have a nice life compared to those guys 

390.25 391.47 A: right 

392.26 393.54 A: that's true 

393.57 397.38 B: or i am not that bad or i am not or you 

397.40 403.54 B: think you'll learn something out of it you can know people better you think so 

403.44 414.86 B: people watch it i mean it's before there was a t._v. people were watching their neighbors right in every neighborhood there was an old lady with you know always 

410.42 411.60 A: that's right 

413.08 414.70 A: [laughter] 

415.30 421.44 B: you know lift the curtain from the corner and watch what's going on who is dating who and 

421.79 422.73 B: (( you know )) 

422.34 423.87 A: right right 

423.19 429.64 B: and it's everywhere i guess you have them here too and it's the same in turkey so there this is like 

425.42 426.49 A: yeah 

429.80 432.48 B: a convenient way of 

432.67 436.55 B: gossiping in the global village let's say you know 

433.60 434.83 A: yeah 

436.38 440.08 A: you know you just made me think of something in my neighborhood 

440.12 444.62 A: and there may be ah let's say eighty houses in this area 

444.90 450.80 A: [lipsmack] i have the only house where my kitchen has a window that faces the street 

451.20 456.29 A: so when i'm washing my dishes i can look out at the street and see what's going on 

456.58 469.73 A: and nobody else has a house like that there are no kitchen windows that face the street all the other kitchens are in the back and you know that's something people used to do in my mother's neighborhood you know much older houses 

470.73 480.34 A: you know there are more people who have kitchens in the front so you can always look out while you're just working in the in the house and see what's going on 

477.75 478.46 B: (( mm )) 

480.31 494.62 A: and i i think it's good for safety in one respect but ah [laughter] you know you do get to see what's happening but maybe that's why people watch reality shows because they're they can't watch their neighbors anymore 

494.62 501.98 B: yeah i mean it's humanity at its worst because there's money and they are playing each other you know 

501.66 503.18 A: yeah 

501.93 512.03 B: manipulating and stuff so ah people like that i mean it's morally they like it because they are not the same they feel better about themselves also [mn] ah 

510.24 514.62 A: yeah do you think people have too much free time 

516.05 526.45 B: i mean the- yeah modern soc- modern society people ju- work during the day and come back to television right not to each other and families 

526.21 531.42 A: well see i almost never watch tv [laughter] i'm too busy [laughter] 

528.52 529.60 B: (( oh okay )) 

530.83 537.04 B: i watch it but you know on the background usually i don't think without thinking or 

536.97 538.11 A: yeah 

537.36 540.58 B: (( you know i watch movie films and stuff )) 

541.24 547.23 B: but i i was never crazy about any soap opera or a t._v. show particularly yeah 

546.62 547.73 A: uh-huh 

548.34 549.60 A: oh 

548.43 549.06 B: (( oh )) 

549.49 554.70 A: well i remember thinking when i watched um frontier house on p._b._s. 

554.49 568.69 A: that it was very educational and my daughter watched it with me and she really enjoyed it but then of course you started liking one family and not liking another family there was one family they were really really rich and they were from california 

568.55 573.09 A: and they had a really hard time adjusting to life on the frontier 

573.41 587.44 A: with none of their luxuries and the teenage girls tried to smuggle some make up into the [laughter] into the country and they were just going crazy because um well they used up their food too fast and then they were hungry 

578.55 579.94 B: [laughter] 

587.80 590.57 A: and they kept saying it's not fair 

590.37 603.99 A: it's not fair and there was another family there that they were much more practical people and they kept saying well you know life is not fair [mn] and here i was watching this show and watching these three families and 

603.83 616.60 A: you know liking one family and not liking another and then i thought you know p._b._s. has tricked me into watching a reality show you know i thought i was watching something educational and ah 

611.54 613.19 B: yeah yeah 

616.76 628.33 A: you know and it was educational you know it's not where like they were competing for money or anything but it was still a reality show [laughter] so ah 

626.33 627.22 B: (( yes )) 

628.82 630.48 A: but i enjoyed it 

630.55 632.70 A: i wouldn't watch it all the time 

630.57 632.30 B: (( i think maybe it was )) 

632.39 635.58 B: educational in that sense too i mean 

635.88 646.71 B: witnessing other how other people live and relate to each other et cetera but i mean it's dangerous to make you know generalizations about it maybe that's the whole point you 

640.35 641.38 A: yeah 

646.55 647.62 A: uh-huh 

646.99 653.56 B: have to apply this kind of censorship to yourself and making general- so rich people can't do 

653.98 655.34 A: [laughter] 

654.76 656.61 B: (( that then )) 

657.19 658.15 B: you know 

658.12 666.65 A: well i guess it was you know maybe confirming a lot of people's stereotypes of people from california oh they have way too much money 

662.62 663.54 B: yeah 

666.74 668.68 A: and i don't know 

669.93 671.03 A: (( but ah )) 

671.25 678.50 A: sometimes i think that maybe reality shows are so popular because they've run out of ideas for other kinds of shows 

679.00 682.39 B: yeah i i mean it's the fastest growing 

682.44 687.23 B: type of shows right i mean they they had another show in turkey with 

684.05 685.06 A: yeah 

687.74 694.33 B: ah baking making a family to live as minimum wage and they 

694.81 702.45 B: they got work and they have to buy food and pay the rent and electricity et cetera and they it's kind of a 

700.02 700.94 A: uh-huh 

702.58 710.13 B: maybe it's more like your frontier house thing but it's in the modern world with the real minimum wage that's 

710.29 718.45 B: going around in turkey today so it was it was slightly more interesting i never watched it i didn't have any chance but 

717.85 718.87 A: (( oh ))
