11.01 12.24 A: my name's angel 

12.37 17.01 B: and we- i guess we're supposed to talk about reality t._v. 

16.54 20.81 A: yeah do you watch like any reality t._v. show or anything like that 

17.22 18.10 B: yeah 

20.28 25.50 B: i've never watched any of it none yeah do you watch them 

22.19 24.44 A: really wow 

25.53 26.43 A: yes 

26.37 28.02 B: which ones do you watch 

27.59 30.97 A: mainly like the real world 'cause like it's always on 

30.76 32.15 B: yeah 

31.10 35.48 A: because yeah like it reruns on like five different channels and 

34.73 39.22 B: yeah and there's there's never any more 

39.35 42.73 B: music on mtv [laughter] 

41.05 42.51 A: exactly 

43.05 43.92 A: so 

43.18 46.56 B: but but i never have watched any of the other ones 

46.33 47.72 A: neither have i 

47.28 48.30 B: the 

48.42 55.60 B: um survivor or any of those although i know people who were just com- like completely addicted to them 

55.31 61.65 A: i know like like that sort of amazes me 'cause they're just so contrived and the people are just sort of like 

61.74 63.65 A: so over the top 

63.04 65.99 B: yeah so have you watched them at all 

66.12 72.79 A: um no like usually it's just like in like the commercials and the sound clips and hearing it like on the news and 

71.89 73.74 B: (( yeah )) 

72.95 75.99 A: jay leno and everything else like that 

75.40 78.56 B: yeah so why do you think they're popular 

78.22 84.63 A: i think just because people are like extreme voyeurs and they just don't really want to admit how voyeuristic they are 

84.17 87.83 B: oh yeah i hadn't thought of it that way 

87.53 91.86 A: so it's sort of like you get to see peop- it's like twenty four seven jerry springer 

91.81 93.01 B: yeah 

92.18 98.52 A: so like you've always got the opportunity to see somebody like doing [noise] something really odd like eating worms or 

97.70 100.39 B: yeah [laughter] 

99.61 103.14 A: jumping off of buildings and everything else like that 

102.44 107.56 B: the the part of it that bothers me i guess is that it seems so brutal 

107.41 108.56 A: (( yeah )) 

107.95 110.55 B: the way they have to make a decision 

110.89 115.02 B: um and you know who to kick off 

115.03 118.05 B: so there's all of this forced 

118.45 128.35 B: you know they're forced to to to be on teams and pitted against each other and i found that and that is truly contrived 

124.45 125.10 A: yeah 

128.00 129.50 A: yeah it is 

128.89 130.59 B: and the part that they're 

132.67 145.08 B: they're talking about starving to death and they're weeping and you know somebody's going to die and there's a whole crew sitting you know ten feet away filming them so [laughter] 

141.28 142.57 A: [laughter] 

145.49 149.22 B: it's like you know just how real can that possibly be 

148.60 152.15 A: i don't think you were supposed to think of that [laughter] 

150.25 156.13 B: yeah but i i could i don't think i could ever get past that part so 

154.54 155.80 A: [laughter] 

156.39 164.91 B: but i've never watched them i did watch the real world when it first came on i watched a bit of it and then it seemed like it was 

161.19 162.08 A: (( mm )) 

165.92 168.60 B: you know it was just on all the time 

168.19 169.69 A: yeah 

168.81 176.75 B: and ah and the only other one that i've watched and i must say that i really enjoy is the osbournes 

176.60 177.91 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

177.82 183.18 B: but that's 'cause they're just really sick [laughter] 

180.50 182.00 A: yeah that's true 

182.34 184.41 A: they're just so odd it's 

183.59 189.41 B: yeah and i i tried watching the anna nicole myth 

188.88 190.30 A: (( just mm )) 

189.86 192.83 B: just out of curiosity and i 

192.94 196.46 B: i couldn't last more than like two minutes 

195.90 200.73 A: yeah that that was me because everybody was talking about it and i was like well 

200.15 203.07 B: well i had been watching ah 

203.08 208.71 B: another program that had done a skit that was a take off on it and i thought well 

206.88 208.00 A: mhm 

208.91 212.08 B: i really wasn't getting all of the joke because i didn't 

212.32 214.34 B: i'd never seen the real show 

213.88 215.07 A: (( yeah )) 

214.47 216.27 B: so i thought well maybe i should go 

216.47 218.72 B: actually see this but 

218.71 230.16 A: it there was too much pink for me it was just sort of like like the idea of like the this like thirty or forty year old woman just surrounded by that much pink it was just sort of frightening 

220.47 221.82 B: oh it was 

228.26 233.08 B: oh and she's obscene i mean she's just grotesque 

233.10 243.25 B: and she talks in that bizarre voice and the only little bit that i saw was when she was doing her she was doing her bedroom and she wanted her entire bedroom done in pink 

235.49 236.59 A: [laughter] 

243.05 244.16 A: (( yeah )) 

243.50 245.53 B: satin and white fur 

245.78 246.88 B: and 

247.07 254.13 B: the walls and everything and that's when i figured that it i you know i we had to change the channel we couldn't handle it anymore 

251.76 253.02 A: [laughter] 

254.48 258.83 B: but so the real world is on other channels now is it 

258.01 264.44 A: yeah i think it reruns like on a._b._c. or like a w._d. something 

261.24 263.00 B: oh wow 

264.06 266.30 B: oh it's probably on everything 

265.91 267.06 A: yeah 

266.46 269.94 B: they've made a fortune off of that that's been a long time 

269.45 276.06 A: they have like i think it's like the tenth season or like the eleventh or twelfth season or something 

275.58 277.45 B: wow that's wild 

276.84 288.04 A: 'cause i think like the season like two seasons ago was like the anniversary season and they said it's been on for ten years and i was like wow that's quite a while 

281.78 284.35 B: yeah and they brought everybody back 

287.47 290.38 B: yeah it's hard to believe 

290.48 297.60 A: like i'd say like the first season i was probably about like ten or eleven and i enjoyed the first season and it was 

295.51 296.66 B: uh-huh 

297.51 307.12 A: good and it was still like realistic and it wasn't as contrived and i wasn't as bothered by the people and the people to me seemed more realistic 

307.01 308.34 B: more honest 

308.01 313.32 A: yeah they were more honest with like who they a- who they were but now it's sort of like 

308.53 309.51 B: yeah 

313.48 325.18 A: really formulaic where you always have to have like the one person that's never met a black person before and like the one person that's a nymphomaniac and like it just continues on and you have to have that person in the show 

318.64 320.31 B: yeah 

324.92 326.29 B: but 

326.62 331.33 B: [mn] it seems to me that all television is that way it's even 

329.22 330.32 A: that's true 

331.65 340.85 B: no matter how good a sitcom or a show is you know any show that comes on that the first year or so 

340.86 349.27 B: is very different and then it's they figure out what it is in the show that works and then they just beat it to death 

348.90 350.13 A: (( yeah )) 

349.50 353.64 B: and they just keep doing the same thing [noise] over and over again and 

353.71 358.66 B: you know like that's why nothing can last for very long unless it's really well written 

358.44 359.58 A: that's true 

359.85 362.90 B: so you know things like frasier i mean 

363.10 367.65 B: i don't even watch that anymore it's just it's gotten kind of old and 

365.24 366.38 A: yeah 

368.10 370.98 B: the script the writing is still good but 

371.12 377.25 B: you know it's the same it's the same story week after week it gets kind of boring 

375.68 376.72 A: yeah 

378.18 379.17 B: (( and )) 

378.78 380.58 A: frasier's been on for quite a while 

380.84 385.45 B: yeah it has been so how come you don't watch them 

385.73 386.71 A: um i 

386.93 393.30 A: don't know like just like t._v. in general i just usually use it as like background noise but i'm never actually like 

393.57 400.20 A: deliberately sitting in front of the television like oh well it's ten thirty and this is on and i have to watch it at this moment 

399.59 400.96 B: yeah 

400.38 404.00 A: because it's just sort of like you've seen it before 

404.88 411.23 A: or after a while it just gets like really like boring and inane and just like silly 'cause like i don't 

411.26 422.70 A: know like like you said like the first season of different things are really good so you'll watch like the first season of like the practice or the first season of alias and it was really good because you didn't know what was going to happen 

422.32 423.52 B: right 

422.69 427.20 A: but then by the second season you're like yeah i know these people i know exactly what you're doing 

425.30 428.57 B: yeah and the same stuff happens over and over again 

428.97 430.08 B: yeah 

430.13 433.06 B: i just was never very interested in it and 

433.38 434.55 B: i don't know 

435.10 435.81 B: (( i )) 

436.05 442.43 B: forget when it was exactly but for some reason i just sort of stopped watching television in general 

442.21 443.27 A: (( yeah )) 

442.66 446.84 B: i sort of resented the fact that um 

447.21 459.03 B: uh things like mini series where they they just get you pa- plugged in and you have to wa- i think the last thing i watched where i wouldn't miss an episode was probably twin peaks 

458.47 459.31 A: (( uh-huh )) 

459.09 466.61 B: and that was you know that was a long time ago was the last time i was tied tied in to something on a regular basis 

466.36 467.52 A: yeah 

466.90 468.58 B: aside from that 

469.07 472.85 B: there's just not much on that i really want to see 

472.61 474.13 A: yeah 

473.60 475.35 B: so i you know i 

475.48 480.64 B: i watch the simpsons regularly even though i've seen them all a million times [laughter] 

477.90 478.77 A: mhm 

482.44 486.76 B: it's one of one of my guilty pleasures they still make me laugh but 

484.59 485.46 A: [laughter] 

487.25 490.95 B: there's really not i can't think of anything that's on 

491.24 493.37 B: regular television that i watch 

493.59 495.83 A: (( yeah i don't know )) 

495.46 497.53 B: i don't know i remember when i was in 

497.97 499.18 B: when i was 

499.28 510.61 B: in school and studying all i could think of [noise] was i wanted to get to a point in my life where i had a regular job so that i could come home and watch television and not feel guilty 

509.98 511.25 A: [laughter] 

510.89 518.19 B: and then once my studies were done and i had that opportunity i realized that there was nothing to watch so 

517.52 518.59 A: (( yeah )) 

518.21 518.81 B: (( [laughter] )) 

518.65 524.72 A: that was how it was for me because i started um like i had a job where like i worked from five till ten 

524.64 525.72 B: oh 

524.82 534.28 A: so i never got to see anything that was on the t._v. and it was sort of like i would just be sitting at work going friends is on and i'm missing e._r. and this is on and that's on 

532.24 533.76 B: yeah 

534.24 540.09 A: and now that like my work schedule's changed where i'm home for all those things i still don't watch them 

539.19 541.11 B: you still don't watch them 

541.43 544.36 B: oh i still tend to read a lot and you 

544.55 551.40 B: know people will ask me what i you know i'll say that i read this or i read that and they say well where do you find all that time to read and i 

552.23 556.79 B: i i think part of it is that i just never think to turn the television on 

556.39 557.62 A: (( yeah )) 

557.00 562.83 B: so that it really does afford you a lot more time if you're not glued into it 

562.26 563.48 A: that's true 

563.10 566.84 B: although there's some interesting there's some bizarre stuff on 

567.28 573.18 B: um i'll watch the spanish channels every once in a while just to try and 

570.61 571.75 A: [laughter] 

573.23 579.04 B: i speak just enough of it that i don't exactly know what they're talking about so you have to kind of guess 

576.90 578.04 A: mhm 

578.78 580.22 A: [laughter] 

579.69 581.74 B: it's kind of enjoyable 

582.69 587.24 B: but i i could never understand why survivor 

587.40 591.16 B: when it first came out why it was such a hit 

591.25 595.16 B: i mean i have friends who had survivor parties it was like their 

594.98 596.15 A: wow 

595.56 600.94 B: they based their week around they would all get together and watch it yeah 

599.93 613.88 A: well i guess it was the whole the lure of being able to vote somebody off the island i think it was just sort of like to have that kind of power over somebody where you were just like you must go we don't want you in our group anymore 

611.19 612.51 B: yeah 

615.47 622.98 A: like i don't i'm not really sure like the one that amazes me now there's one that's like on n._b._c. i think it's like monday nights or something 

623.00 637.32 A: where like they have like four people or i don't know how many people but they do like really odd and gross things like you have to eat maggots or like jump in like like the an ocean with like live sharks and 

629.81 631.21 B: mhm 

631.91 633.55 B: oh yeah 

636.94 638.27 B: yeah 

637.42 639.58 A: like all this like really odd 

639.77 641.48 A: (( bizarre things )) 

639.93 642.97 B: where they're facing their fears 

643.28 646.29 A: yeah i think it's yeah that's what it it's fear factor 

645.62 647.16 B: yeah 

647.17 652.09 A: and it's just sort of like what someone would do for a million dollars is just like so creepy 

650.39 651.59 B: yeah 

651.80 654.79 B: ugh well i don't know but 

655.10 658.48 B: i would do it as long as it didn't involve snakes 

657.91 659.17 A: [laughter] 

659.17 660.15 B: [laughter] 

661.53 664.81 B: but yeah i i've i've always been amazed 

665.59 672.85 B: at why those things are so popular and then there was that whole series of things who wants to be a millionaire 

672.23 673.11 A: (( uh-huh )) 

673.15 677.09 B: and that was so popular and then it was like it was on every night 

676.83 677.89 A: (( yeah )) 

677.55 680.29 B: and i never watched it 

680.59 689.35 A: see i now that one i watched because it was sort of entertaining to see how far someone got or to see like what question it was that they lost on 

688.85 690.12 B: mhm 

689.41 691.78 A: but some of the questions are like really simple 

691.89 692.72 A: and 

692.01 698.95 B: well the only little bit of it i saw the questions were so dumb and i just got frustrated i thought if these 

699.07 711.06 B: you know it was almost as though they were bringing the people on to make fools out of them for being stupid because the questions to me seemed so simple but then i always have to remember that if i were 

703.37 704.80 A: [laughter] 

711.27 719.90 B: if i were in that place even if you had that knowledge you know you're so out of your element and you've got all of these people and there's lights
