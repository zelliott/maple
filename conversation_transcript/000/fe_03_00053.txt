20.40 23.72 A: do you have uh personal feeling on the on the topic they've given us 

25.19 26.26 B: yeah i think there's 

27.34 30.75 B: i don't see anything wrong with drinking excessive amounts of caffeine 

31.46 32.20 A: neither do i 

31.57 32.26 B: how about yourself 

32.74 38.69 A: you know i i drink excessive amounts of caffeine and i definitely don't see much of a problem with that 

33.07 33.43 B: no 

33.90 34.25 B: (( )) 

39.37 40.23 B: yeah i haven't seen any 

40.81 42.84 B: study saying coffee is bad for you at all 

43.48 49.09 A: um i've seen like there have been like studies where they sort of hypothesized that but i've never seen anything like conclusive 

49.94 50.32 B: yeah 

50.43 54.20 B: i i i know at one point a doctor had asked me to get off it he thought i had like a 

54.80 55.85 B: extra heart (( )) 

56.24 59.98 B: so i went off it for a while and then i went back and he said the heart (( )) is gone 

60.36 60.88 A: okay 

60.45 62.54 B: and i went right back on the coffee (( )) 

62.81 63.88 B: i think he was just full of it 

65.03 66.62 B: i drink about a pot a day so 

67.01 68.85 A: really i do too 

68.03 68.58 B: yeah 

69.04 69.32 A: that's 

69.16 69.79 B: there you go 

69.56 70.92 A: that's a funny coincidence that 

71.06 73.45 A: we got asked that and that we both drink that much coffee 

73.89 74.74 B: now how -bout smoking 

75.42 76.72 A: um i don't smoke 

76.83 77.20 A: but 

78.04 78.67 A: i mean 

80.14 81.81 A: i li- i jus- i don't understand what 

81.95 83.15 A: their question like if it's 

83.25 84.94 A: bad like they have different 

85.20 86.86 A: types of bad things 

87.41 91.09 A: like gossiping and smoking are not really things i know how to compare 

88.93 89.26 B: right 

89.65 89.94 B: right 

91.21 95.09 B: well i- it they were asking about personal habits 

95.59 96.57 A: yeah that's true 

96.35 97.97 B: so i guess like 

98.95 99.98 B: if you gossip a lot 

99.05 99.52 A: i mean 

100.82 103.70 A: i mean i rather have my friends smoke and i'd rather gossip myself 

100.97 101.46 B: (( )) 

104.45 105.01 B: there you go 

105.90 108.12 A: what about you do you smoke 

108.89 110.92 B: no occasionally i uh t- 

111.06 111.55 B: well 

111.74 113.35 B: occasionally i'll smoke a cigar 

113.46 114.44 B: but i've 

114.80 115.63 B: last couple 

116.36 117.67 B: the last two years i've been offered 

117.79 118.80 B: -gars i said no 

119.66 120.20 B: and 

119.72 120.15 A: -kay 

120.39 121.93 B: part of it's a personal choice 

122.09 124.07 B: -cause i don't want my kids seeing me smoke 

124.38 124.78 A: uh-huh 

124.78 125.23 B: -cause i've 

125.95 126.45 B: certainly 

126.77 129.51 B: believe that smoking is not a good personal choice 

130.13 130.66 A: okay 

131.57 132.56 B: and so i 

132.76 133.41 B: i don't want even 

133.82 137.08 B: occasionally smoke a cigar you know at a barbecue or 

135.61 136.06 A: right 

137.38 140.89 B: whatever so i even i turn -em down or i give -em away if people give -em to me 

141.56 142.04 A: okay 

141.60 142.91 B: but at one point i actually 

143.51 147.71 B: belonged to a group and we had a box of cigars and we kept it in (( )) at a cigar store 

147.93 148.34 A: uh-huh 

148.58 150.77 B: so yeah i would say i smoke about one a week 

151.68 152.22 A: okay 

152.06 152.45 B: but 

152.96 154.05 B: yeah i don't think it's a good 

154.44 156.38 B: good habit either from just from a personal 

157.20 157.57 B: uh 

157.92 160.28 B: viewpoint -cause e- even though you feel good when you do it 

160.83 161.93 B: it ruins your taste buds 

162.35 164.01 B: and i find eating is important 

164.34 165.56 B: being able to taste food 

166.10 167.03 B: and it definitely is 

166.23 166.86 A: i- yeah 

167.24 168.32 A: yeah it's true 

169.57 169.93 B: so 

170.59 175.72 A: yeah i don't i just never i never really liked smoking i mean i smoked a cigar once and 

175.82 176.11 B: yeah 

176.12 183.19 A: some other various things once or twice but i mean nothing like that really made me like oh i want to do this all the time 

184.11 184.67 A: um 

185.28 185.94 B: yeah it does it 

186.07 187.41 B: when you smoke i i think it 

187.65 188.12 B: gets 

188.86 192.12 B: if you don't smoke a lot the nicotine gives you kind of a rush in your head 

192.80 194.68 B: kind of wakes you up and you feel good by it 

194.84 195.36 A: mhm 

195.12 196.68 B: so there's some reward from doing it 

197.45 197.73 A: yup 

198.02 199.58 B: and that's why i think people do it 

200.64 202.59 B: we we started doing it just to clear out the 

202.94 205.15 B: study rooms so no one else would be in there studying with us 

205.51 207.34 B: so we were a couple of us that would light up 

207.58 208.07 A: yeah 

207.75 209.56 B: when everyone else would leave and it'd be quiet and 

210.28 211.71 B: you know dorm study rooms so 

213.12 215.47 B: that's when we started um i don't think you'd get away with that today 

215.83 219.50 A: probably not but that's a good idea to like get rid of people if you want it to be quiet there 

219.01 224.88 B: well then it became fashionable it became chic to smoke cigars which kind of bothered me 

224.12 224.52 A: right 

225.96 226.44 A: yeah 

227.79 228.64 B: what else was there 

229.09 231.83 A: uh gossiping overeating not exercising 

232.78 234.72 B: well gossiping goes on all the time 

235.11 235.93 B: in my neighborhood 

236.48 237.02 A: yeah 

237.46 238.35 B: do you get a lot o- gossip 

239.02 241.07 A: um yeah i'm i'm a college student 

239.05 239.74 B: (( )) 

241.32 243.36 A: so my life is about gossip 

241.39 241.74 B: yeah 

245.67 246.92 A: um 

247.58 249.95 A: but i mean i don't know i don't think it's like 

250.53 253.84 A: i don't think it's like that bad a habit as long as you sort of have 

254.24 259.82 A: if you like maintain some perspective of which of the things you're talking about are actually true or just like rumors 

260.26 260.70 B: oh 

261.51 262.12 A: i mean 

261.79 263.81 B: yeah in col- in college people just start rumors 

263.99 264.43 B: and gossip 

264.97 265.53 A: wait what 

265.12 265.62 B: (( )) 

265.81 267.33 B: we'd just start rumors and 

267.02 267.64 A: oh yeah 

267.77 269.35 B: yeah to feed the gossip 

268.53 269.64 A: did you start anything really funny 

270.49 275.07 B: oh (( )) just one guy big jim and it got around that he puked in the ice at the 

275.39 277.16 B: boat house which is a very popular bar 

277.33 277.71 A: uh-huh 

278.28 281.51 B: and they had to shut down the bar because of it and it was just a total lie 

281.54 282.35 A: oh my god 

282.28 283.18 B: so that got around 

284.67 285.34 A: okay 

284.95 285.29 B: but 

285.96 288.69 B: i don't know tha- (( )) thought that was funny at the time 

286.99 287.76 A: wow that's 

288.53 293.74 A: no that's just like that's a really big lie no it's funny i'm trying to think if like 

293.95 294.67 A: i've ever 

295.42 299.54 A: i've been involved in major gossip and i don't well no like i know um 

299.70 301.73 A: i know a girl do you know what the m._c._a._t. is 

302.96 303.23 B: yeah 

303.59 304.13 A: um 

304.53 304.87 A: yeah 

305.39 306.78 B: yeah that's the medical testing 

306.67 307.06 A: yeah 

307.49 310.87 A: so i mean i'm pre-med so like a lot of my friends are pre-med and 

311.06 316.95 A: we all took the m._c._a._t. last year and there's one girl who like supposedly got a twenty four which is 

317.11 317.43 A: like 

318.04 323.57 A: actually not a bad score but it was like a lot below what everyone thought this particular girl would get 

323.95 324.25 B: right 

324.70 329.73 A: um but i don't really know if it's true but i have a friend who started telling everyone that 

329.95 330.41 A: and like 

330.63 338.53 A: i sort of was too close with him to ask him if he was like making it up because that would be really mean to be like are you just lying but i sort of thought that maybe he was 

335.75 336.03 B: right 

339.28 339.64 B: yeah 

339.60 340.96 A: because he really hated her 

342.06 342.64 A: and like 

343.15 345.61 A: like she probably got like a lot above that 

343.57 344.05 B: that's good 

346.40 349.07 B: the good vicious rumors ar- are kind of fun i think 

349.23 353.73 A: yes they they are and it's not like anybody is (( gonna )) tell her that 

352.25 353.40 B: especially if you start -em 

354.27 354.69 B: right 

355.06 357.64 A: like hey heard you got a twenty four that sucks 

359.93 362.49 B: yeah i think it takes up a lot of time the gossiping 

362.63 364.21 B: there's a lot i live in uh 

365.49 366.27 B: suburban 

366.80 367.63 B: cul-de-sac 

367.84 368.37 B: and 

369.54 372.08 B: there's a lot of gossip going on with the various 

372.59 373.30 B: primarily 

373.44 379.06 B: it's the women that are constantly on the phone with each other it's my wife -s constantly getting calls -cause she gets called by everyone 

375.97 376.39 A: yeah 

379.51 382.20 B: and everyone has something to say about the next neighbor 

382.72 386.22 B: so you know they're talking about her too and they're talking about us and 

382.91 383.51 A: well that 

386.39 387.66 B: to me i just don't care 

386.42 387.08 A: yeah 

388.05 389.20 B: i mean i i really don't 

389.53 389.93 A: yeah 

390.22 391.31 B: somehow it takes on 

391.80 393.97 B: a life of it's own to have these gossips going on 

395.20 396.06 B: i don't know i don't find it 

396.97 397.83 B: terribly bad i- 

398.16 398.89 B: fairly amusing 

399.74 400.21 A: yeah 

400.38 406.13 A: you know it's silly i i can imagine that like that kind of gossip that's like the kind of gossip in like movies and stuff 

407.55 408.03 B: right 

407.60 409.99 A: where it's like everyone's wife is calling each other and like 

411.38 414.92 A: oh you're wife's frien- friends' probably have like all kinds of crazy things to say about you 

415.90 416.17 B: true 

416.41 417.17 B: they probably do 

417.81 426.83 B: you know or wonder why why you do what you do you know or why you have a s- why you go on vacation or you know why you have a certain car 

425.30 425.82 A: yeah 

427.39 428.45 B: it just goes on and on 

428.77 429.97 B: people just love i think to 

431.20 432.93 B: gossip -cause it then helps them figure out 

433.65 435.81 B: somewhat where they stand in the (( )) thing 

436.15 437.32 A: yeah that's true 

438.16 439.47 B: like a twenty four on an m._c._a._t. 

441.49 444.58 A: no it's definitely it's exactly what what people are doing 

445.01 445.79 B: now how -bout drinking 

446.26 446.94 B: you're in college 

447.04 448.02 A: i like drinking 

448.44 448.74 B: yeah 

448.79 455.76 A: i see nothing wrong with drinking i mean i think like at a certain age maybe it's different because at my age i can drink like 

450.63 451.35 B: (( )) 

456.15 458.06 A: or i- not just age but like with what 

458.16 463.54 A: like i have to do with my day i could drink like four or five times a week and still accomplish everything i really need to do 

465.06 465.43 B: right 

465.54 466.59 A: so it's not really 

465.87 466.73 B: so as long as it doesn't 

466.85 468.04 A: (( )) 

468.88 469.26 B: right 

469.36 470.34 B: it's not affecting you 

470.72 471.38 A: exactly 

471.47 471.81 B: why 

472.12 472.50 B: yeah 

472.83 474.69 A: what do you think of drinking 

476.45 477.04 B: well the only 

477.46 478.96 B: time i see it as a problem is 

479.75 481.63 B: for me now i have children so sometimes 

482.31 483.57 B: other parents that just 

484.29 487.19 B: spend their time with their buddy just getting drunk all the time 

487.05 487.52 A: mhm 

487.64 488.82 B: or just sitting on the porch 

489.47 492.28 B: out back you know just hanging out talking and 

492.83 494.59 B: drinking and then their kids get ignored 

494.83 495.16 B: and that 

495.28 496.73 B: that's the times where i think it 

496.87 497.59 B: -comes a problem 

498.19 498.58 A: yeah 

498.91 499.99 B: you know where the consumption 

501.11 503.02 B: becomes a priority i think in college i think it 

504.18 504.84 B: i think it's fine 

504.94 505.38 B: part of the 

506.17 506.56 B: culture 

507.54 507.93 A: yeah 

508.33 509.75 B: it's socially acceptable and i 

510.12 513.91 B: i certainly i prob- t- i drink alcoholic beverages every day 

515.37 516.77 A: is that your child 

517.37 517.86 B: yeah 

517.60 518.50 A: in the background 

518.72 519.16 B: yeah 

519.87 520.98 B: he wants mommy now -cause 

521.19 522.52 B: i'm not drinking right now yet 

522.95 524.26 B: but later we will be we'll go on 

524.35 525.28 B: to a birthday party and 

525.54 526.47 B: we'll definitely drink 

527.18 527.76 B: actually i think 

527.23 527.62 A: yeah 

528.30 529.47 B: i think some of the 

529.57 530.91 B: drunk driving laws are 

531.57 532.48 B: getting (( )) 

533.35 534.50 B: drop it down to point -o eight 

535.65 537.02 B: an- already go out to dinner tonight 

537.38 538.74 B: for a birthday party we're not (( )) 

540.06 540.44 A: yeah 

540.25 540.54 B: an- 

540.93 543.04 B: very much and still stay within a legal limit 

543.15 543.40 B: so 

545.09 545.87 A: yeah i don't 

545.11 545.83 B: (( )) 

545.99 549.99 A: i don't ever really have to drive so i've never really had to think about that -cause i live like right in the city 

550.38 550.81 A: and like 

551.01 552.66 A: we drink across the street from my house 

553.63 556.81 A: so we don't have to worry about designating a driver 

557.41 559.42 B: yeah so i think from a personal habits standpoint 

563.94 564.32 A: yeah
