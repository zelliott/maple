80.78 81.39 A: yeah 

82.10 82.54 B: so

89.09 89.43 B: yeah 

89.53 91.41 A: the whole thing is a fake 

90.95 96.95 B: yeah yeah and it's i mean i can't believe that you know someone would really put their heart out and the line like that and 

96.99 97.62 A: i know 

97.48 97.96 B: you know 

98.68 99.20 B: i mean 

99.81 101.59 B: i don't i gu- i just can't believe that 

102.06 107.94 B: it just doesn't seem real to me anymore and you know it's like i mean they want the drama for the t._v. and 

108.10 110.57 B: you know i'm sure a lot of it is planned 

110.35 110.80 A: right 

110.93 111.82 A: right 

111.35 111.79 B: so 

112.05 112.74 A: how much is it 

112.16 112.56 B: and 

112.87 115.33 A: how much of it truly is reality t._v. 

115.13 118.50 B: yeah yeah and i mean once in a whi- once in a great while i'll 

118.64 120.41 B: take the time out to catch the osbournes 

121.61 122.27 B: um the 

121.93 122.62 A: i don't know that one 

122.96 125.23 B: you okay it's on it's on m._t._v.

130.24 130.52 A: oh 

130.75 133.45 B: and the reason i watch that one is because it's so stupid 

133.80 137.47 B: makes me feel better about myself 

137.63 145.31 B: but because he's like so because of the drugs and stuff he's like so whacked out that he can barely talk and he just kind of sits and stares he can barely walk and 

141.74 142.25 A: oh yeah 

145.44 148.54 B: it just kind of they're really kind of wacko and it's kind of funny but 

149.58 157.46 B: i mean i guess i'm trying to think of why it really is so popular i don't know maybe it makes people feel better about themselves that they're not as weird as everybody out there 

157.83 162.36 A: uh i don't know i mean do that many people really sti- i mean they must if they're still 

159.59 159.87 B: yeah 

162.48 163.90 A: you know if they keep coming out with 

164.41 168.57 A: reality t- or what is it survivor in australia and survivor here and survivor there
