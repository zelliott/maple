1.50 2.67 B: hello 

2.24 3.47 A: hi 

3.32 5.80 B: [laughter] hi my name is tracey 

5.43 6.66 A: i'm julie 

6.25 7.67 B: hi um 

8.50 15.50 B: as far as the topic goes um i don't get sick very often so it [laughter] doesn't really apply to me 

16.16 23.87 A: well i don't really get sick often either although this past weekend i i seem to have contracted a cough [laughter] [mn] 

23.13 27.60 B: uh-oh [laughter] so will you go to the doctor for it 

27.07 32.88 A: uh definitely not i tend to [mn] not go to doctors [laughter] as often as i should 

32.59 37.20 B: yeah yeah i don't either and i've got two small kids and 

37.70 47.63 B: [mn] i agree with whatever that saying was that if i take the kids to the doctor they're still going to go through seven to ten days with a cold so it doesn't really matter either way 

47.07 49.37 A: yeah i don't even 

47.66 48.93 B: and 

49.45 52.74 A: take sudafed or [mn] medicine usually 

52.71 55.11 B: [mn] yeah yeah me neither 

52.83 53.59 A: (( becau- )) 

54.40 56.07 A: i actually think that it 

56.47 58.12 A: prevents you from getting 

58.60 62.10 A: uh better as quickly as you would without taking medicine 

61.98 63.06 B: (( sure )) 

62.55 65.55 A: because it just temporarily relieves you 

65.40 66.26 B: right 

65.64 68.84 A: you know it keeps whatever's in you stuffed up your nose 

68.36 70.00 B: (( right [mn] )) 

69.37 74.11 A: but it's probably better to just blow your nose a lot and get it out and then [mn] you're done 

73.83 77.63 B: right yeah i will take the medicine sometimes if 

77.78 79.08 B: like if i have to 

79.17 84.87 B: work you know if there's something i have to do that i have to get through it without [mn] you know 

85.06 86.28 A: right right 

85.66 88.59 B: coughing and sneezing the whole time but otherwise i 

88.16 93.09 A: right it's a temporary relief that prolongs it but it might be worth it in some situations [mn] 

90.54 91.55 B: right 

92.07 94.27 B: right exactly 

94.49 97.56 B: so i don't know how long we're supposed to talk for 

97.31 98.66 A: ten minutes 

98.24 106.43 B: oh is it ten minutes okay you were listening better than i was [laughter] i was on hold for a really long time so i kind of spaced out for a while 

99.17 100.10 A: yeah 

101.05 102.62 A: [laughter] 

105.97 108.60 A: okay yeah it'll tell us when the call is over 

108.31 110.66 B: oh have you been doing this for a while 

110.01 111.66 A: this is my second call 

111.32 112.79 B: oh okay 

112.34 113.94 A: i did one yesterday 

113.57 114.38 B: ok- 

114.62 116.19 B: oh that's kinda cool 

116.33 119.19 B: so yeah this is my first one so i didn't know 

119.51 120.43 B: and 

120.47 127.58 B: we just keep talking about cold stuff or we talk about and illness yeah i i don't know i don't 

123.29 124.80 A: and illness 

128.80 132.57 B: i just don't get sick my husband doesn't get sick 

132.24 133.40 A: where do you live 

133.44 136.58 B: i live in milwaukee wisconsin where do you live 

136.40 139.53 A: um i live right now in philadelphia i'm a student 

139.57 140.71 B: oh okay 

139.85 148.46 A: but i was just going to suggest depending on what kind of seasons you have where you live if the changes in weather cause sickness 

148.09 149.94 B: (( um [sigh] )) 

151.54 158.99 B: i mean they do you know with a lot of people obviously everyone's worried about the flu season coming but um 

158.85 163.52 A: does it get i'm sorry i don't even know the weather patterns in wisconsin does 

163.53 164.72 A: does it get 

164.88 168.32 A: cold in the winter and hot in the summer like usual or 

167.57 172.08 B: oh yeah oh yeah like today it's about twenty degrees out 

172.20 173.24 B: um 

173.67 178.68 B: yeah we get the typical i mean milwaukee is a little bit better because we're right on the lake so 

178.73 183.66 B: our winters are a little bit warmer than the wes- rest of the state um 

184.32 185.85 B: but it's 

186.11 195.72 B: you know everyone my husband and i get our flu shots every year so to help stay away from that but uh that's just because we work 

195.91 196.59 B: with 

196.47 200.42 B: oodles and oodles of people and [laughter] 

200.34 211.55 B: they all get sick and we don't want to get what they have [laughter] so we get our flu shots so that you know hopefully our kids don't get anything they're not in daycare or anything yet so 

202.09 203.69 A: [laughter] 

211.85 220.21 B: they've been pretty safe um my son will start pre school in the fall and i fear that he will end up getting sick 

220.68 226.28 B: you know getting colds and things just just being exposed to other kids so 

222.39 223.38 A: right 

226.83 230.37 B: i'm not looking forward to that but 

230.26 235.07 A: when he's sick like would you keep him out of school or would you just give him medicine and send him to school 

234.93 238.96 B: um i would keep him out i mean ah because 

239.68 252.20 B: i'm a teacher and i can't stand it when students come to class sick because all they do is get other kids sick so if they'd just stay home even on even if it's just a day 

252.13 257.93 B: just you know during the worst of it they feel better and then they can come back and concentrate better 

258.07 259.19 B: uh 

259.50 265.98 B: it's just not worth it to you know especially while especially in pre school you know it's not like 

265.13 266.08 A: right 

266.00 272.69 B: you're going to miss that learning about the letter b. today so you gotta go [laughter] they can just get that another day 

272.40 273.44 A: right 

272.80 281.70 B: so no i'm not gonna force my kids to to go and then get everybody else sick it's which is part of the problem so 

281.74 283.88 B: do you have kids no you're 

283.88 285.75 A: no [laughter] 

284.38 287.71 B: no [laughter] so 

288.11 291.38 B: so yeah i'm not gonna do that and 

291.67 297.88 B: my daughter is susceptible to ear infections so the last thing i want is to expose her to more 

298.14 302.57 B: of that stuff but she won't be in pre school for two more years so 

302.84 304.99 B: i don't have anything to worry about there 

305.88 307.01 B: (( [sigh] so )) 

306.70 312.42 A: for me i live in a dormitory so it's along the same lines as everyone going to class sick 

308.75 309.84 B: oh 

311.85 318.59 B: exactly exactly i mean i i teach at a university and i'm amazed 

318.65 325.53 B: at how the students will just come to class sick as two dogs instead of just staying 

325.55 329.05 B: in their dorm or at their apartment or whatever and just 

329.07 334.38 A: well what i'm saying is that even if they stay in their apartment or the dorm we're all here [laughter] 

329.18 329.88 B: get 

331.83 332.81 B: oh 

333.58 336.80 B: right yeah that's true that's true 

336.20 339.93 A: so if someone in the hallway is sick the rest of the hallway gets sick 

339.31 343.72 B: yeah yeah i just remember last year 

344.75 346.98 B: i came down with pink eye 

347.18 352.16 B: and i was just flabbergasted i'm like how did i get pink eye and it 

352.03 366.44 B: turns out about half the students in my class go oh i had it last week i had it yesterday [laughter] i just and i'm like why were you here giving me pink eye [laughter] i was so angry [laughter] 

361.70 363.49 A: [laughter] 

365.67 367.05 A: what do you teach 

367.24 377.56 B: um actually i teach linguistics [laughter] so that's why i wanted to help out with this study i'm curious as to what they're really looking for you know 

369.20 369.88 A: (( oh )) 

377.79 378.81 B: um 

379.03 383.59 B: i teach things like the power of words and language and gender 

383.00 386.39 A: uh i just took positive psychology last semester 

385.94 387.01 B: oh okay 

386.40 388.55 A: (( so i know a little bit about it )) 

387.73 393.95 B: sure sure yeah it's really interesting so i'm i'm curious whenever they 

394.28 395.72 B: you know publish 

395.76 399.49 B: the results of the study which i'm sure will be years down the road but 

399.67 400.59 B: um 

401.08 405.14 B: i mean obviously you've taken linguistics classes you know 

406.48 409.60 B: whatever they're looking for they're not telling us 

409.86 410.73 A: right 

410.17 412.14 B: you know so i'm just 

412.20 415.24 B: curious as to what they're really trying to get at 

415.26 421.52 B: and if we're giving them good data [laughter] so i think it'll be 

421.53 424.11 B: it'll be fun to say you participated 

424.78 425.91 B: (( so )) 

426.13 428.73 B: now some of the topics on there 

428.78 430.76 B: i think are pretty interesting 

430.85 432.76 B: so i hope i get some of 

432.94 433.88 B: the 

434.60 438.57 B: you know hot topics that get people talking 

438.62 440.87 A: like illness [laughter] 

439.38 448.92 B: yeah yeah getting those colds as the seasons change [laughter] [laughter] yeah i don't know what else to say about it 

449.08 453.40 B: ten minutes is a long time to talk about colds [laughter] 

453.64 456.14 B: i don't know do you have anything else 

456.59 460.35 A: [mn] well we can also talk about our thoughts on doctors 

459.82 461.08 B: oh well 

460.73 461.61 A: (( [mn] )) 

462.16 463.57 B: doctors 

463.78 464.88 B: (( i don't know )) 

465.50 466.22 B: (( i )) 

466.47 470.68 B: i actually teach a class on like patient provider 

471.22 473.98 B: communications so 

474.98 475.69 B: (( i'm )) 

475.86 480.47 B: pretty hypercritical of doctors just you know if i have a hard time with them 

481.44 484.92 B: it's usually because of the communication problems you know the 

484.68 498.33 B: coming in and them acting like god [laughter] and them not realizing that i have a choice to go to them or somebody else and you know where i appreciate all the hard work they did to go through 

487.64 488.67 A: right 

498.11 501.33 B: school and all that fun stuff i still 

503.42 504.89 B: i am still 

505.24 506.10 B: you know 

506.51 509.81 B: [sigh] the one making the choice to go to them 

509.89 510.94 B: so 

511.09 514.18 B: i try to stay away from doctors as much as possible 

515.06 519.89 A: do you find that they make misdiagnoses of sicknesses often or not really 

519.33 522.57 B: um not necessarily that um 

522.58 525.08 B: i mean if i were really sick i guess 

525.29 529.31 B: not kinda that i've been very very lucky as to 

529.53 530.51 B: um 

531.10 534.67 B: being very healthy throughout my life but um 

535.75 536.99 B: i just 

537.03 540.05 B: i get frustrated with the power struggle i guess 

539.29 540.68 A: [noise] 

540.07 545.95 B: i guess i'm thinking mainly of my kids my daughter was born with a congenital defect in 

546.17 548.80 B: her eye and 

550.86 553.21 B: does that mean we're done talking 

552.66 555.14 A: [noise] no i'm sorry that's my other phone [noise] 

554.42 557.58 B: oh [laughter] 

555.35 558.32 A: (( [noise] )) 

558.06 564.67 B: so it's and just dealing with surgeons and you know being her advocate as the parent 

562.39 563.61 A: [noise] 

565.09 566.58 B: is very 

566.89 568.81 B: trying you know 

569.53 570.96 B: do you have to answer that 

570.86 572.19 A: we're not supposed to 

571.82 573.89 B: oh [laughter] 

573.21 574.14 A: [laughter] 

575.97 577.09 B: uh 

576.74 577.60 A: [noise] 

577.71 586.52 B: so you know i struggle with that with dealing with that type of relationship i guess i'm not really thinking of me going to the doctor per se 

586.40 587.30 A: right 

587.12 588.14 B: um 

588.85 591.79 B: although i guess when i was pregnant i was pretty 

593.44 605.83 B: i definitely wanted to go to doctors like i was only going to let an o._b._g._y._n. deliver my children who had who was a woman who had had children herself because i wanted somebody who had been through 

605.87 608.02 B: exactly what i was gonna go through 

608.31 609.28 B: (( you know i )) 

608.80 609.74 A: right 

609.38 613.98 B: not that i have you know male o._b._g._y._n.s are fine i'm sure but 

614.45 619.18 B: i want people who relate to whatever it is so 

619.34 624.58 B: when my daughter was born with this eye problem you know i wanted to go to doctors who could really relate 

625.44 627.95 B: to the problem to what was going on 

627.70 628.72 A: right 

628.13 632.35 B: and it's not always easy to find that of course but 

633.57 636.39 B: so i don't know what about you what do you think of 'em 

636.78 638.04 A: (( um [noise] )) 

638.41 643.11 A: i just usually find that it's not worth my while to go to doctors 

642.57 643.71 B: [laughter] 

643.07 657.10 A: not really because i don't trust them but more because i find that you know when i weigh the costs and benefits i don't really have time to take two hours out of my day to go see a doctor when the chances are that he'll probably just prescribe 

657.06 661.30 A: you know some sort of medication that i already plan on taking anyway [laughter] 

659.83 662.37 B: right [laughter] yeah 

662.05 666.59 A: that sort of thing and i've had actually a lot of situations with misdiagnoses so 

665.90 668.05 B: oh that's not good 

667.39 671.73 A: last s- uh year about a year ago from now actually 

671.62 683.82 A: i had problems with my left eye and i thought maybe i had pink eye i wasn't really sure what the problem was and i went to student health [laughter] and and they told me that i had pink eye 

680.49 681.93 B: (( mm [laughter] )) 

683.72 695.63 A: and they prescribed medication for it and a few weeks later my eye was still in terrible condition and i went back and they were like oh you actually didn't have pink eye we think you have some sort of 

689.13 690.34 B: oh 

695.65 704.31 A: um cut on your eye maybe you should go to the hospital and see what they think about it so i went to the hospital and it turns out i had um 

699.53 701.45 B: (( oh my god [laughter] )) 

704.77 705.87 A: (( an )) 

706.05 708.23 A: ulcer on my pupil 

707.98 709.45 B: oh my god 

708.82 717.44 A: and that was definitely not good because they said if i hadn't actually gone to them like that day or within that week i would have gone blind in my left eye 

716.87 717.41 B: (( ooh )) 

717.68 719.90 A: yeah and that it was very very
