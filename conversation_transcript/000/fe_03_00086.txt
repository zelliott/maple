169.02 177.86 B: actually yesterday discussing something like jackass and i haven't watched that but some of my colleagues had and and 

173.62 174.79 A: right 

177.92 184.11 B: and the only thing i had about it was that there had been some instances where 

184.19 192.91 B: where young kids were then inspired to do something as stupid and then ending up in these horrible accidents 

187.71 189.49 A: oh yeah 

193.30 194.75 B: (( but i )) 

194.56 199.68 A: right yeah but they could get like crazy ideas from books too kids so 

198.97 204.01 B: um the ones who read books i don't know [laughter] 

203.26 208.94 A: well i know like like i'm a german professor for example and um 

209.13 212.25 A: i know that there was a box you know that caused 

213.34 216.70 A: some suicides in the early 

216.91 220.26 A: seventeen hundreds in germany one of books 

218.66 219.72 B: oh 

220.64 222.67 A: called young young young 

222.81 224.70 B: yes yes 

223.57 235.91 A: and inspired people to dress a certain way and if you read back like the of what people said around then they were calling these people fools these kids you know what i mean like because they were dressing in this weird way 

235.61 237.59 B: (( right yes )) 

236.49 241.38 A: and then a lot of them committed suicide well not a lot but you 

239.02 240.10 B: yes i 

240.46 248.68 B: yeah well i heard of i remember hearing about that too or reading it yeah yeah so i guess it was the seventeenth century 

242.55 243.54 A: (( know )) 

244.97 246.64 A: yeah so it's a 

248.48 249.35 A: yeah 

248.75 251.25 B: version of reality shows 

250.90 251.94 A: yeah 

251.41 252.88 B: (( i guess )) 

252.25 257.08 A: or i mean i just think it's just a sign that you know kids will do stupid things 

256.39 260.17 B: yeah yeah well that's yeah that's a good that's a good point 

259.16 262.20 A: you know and they'll get the influence from anything 

261.56 268.03 B: right because they get these influences from other than reality shows as well like movies and so on 

265.08 266.21 A: yeah 

267.45 277.67 A: right but it's kind of fun to ask somebody that like um i didn't realize it the first time but what the first time i asked for someone i said you know you know have you seen that movie jackass 

277.67 278.87 B: (( yeah )) 

278.24 280.71 A: and they didn't really know what i was talking about 

280.87 282.58 B: (( have you seen it ))

297.25 298.20 A: (( um )) 

304.43 306.73 A: yeah but we talked about it 

306.35 308.65 B: oh we did that's right 

307.94 313.30 A: i don't think they were looking for i i you know i just think they want voices talking about a topic 

313.04 314.14 B: i guess 

313.33 316.52 A: they're not looking for us to solve the 

316.59 318.02 B: any problems 

317.41 319.53 A: any problems or you know 

318.29 320.19 B: right right

337.91 339.75 A: [lipsmack] oh no no

460.68 462.00 A: but 

462.47 469.11 A: ah you know i don't you don't nec- i don't think you necessarily at a certain point i got to the point where i was 

469.14 475.91 A: like you know to teach the to understand the grammar of the language and to read the literature you don't really have to go there 

475.62 476.85 B: yeah 

476.38 484.08 A: the internet has made me li- i use to go to germany and one of the big things that i would want to do was buy you know some books 

484.11 489.14 A: because i would gain have access to all this you know music and blah blah blah blah blah 

488.70 489.87 B: right 

489.27 492.84 A: now i can get that all delivered to me from the yeah 

491.82 493.08 B: from the internet 

493.15 494.20 B: yes 

493.33 497.77 A: so my there is that drive to go [laughter] 

497.10 498.77 B: right yes 

498.13 502.19 A: is really cut down it's i mean i hate to say it but it's true 

500.92 505.19 B: well that's an that's an interesting aspect of this whole whole 

506.37 517.64 B: internationalization that the internet has provided it provides like equal access but then it deprives people of the motivation to actually travel places yeah 

516.07 519.27 A: right i mean to me it has it really has 

518.24 521.03 B: yeah yes yeah 

520.18 524.87 A: i mean i use the the web i mean i pre- pretty much 

525.48 532.01 A: get all my material that i teach that i use in a range of classes i get it all off of the web 

531.98 534.97 B: what kinds of classes do you typically teach then 

534.92 542.44 A: i go every everything from you know the the seminars and you know the thesis advising to 

542.69 546.33 A: ah german one and everything in between 

544.62 545.87 B: okay 

546.18 549.91 B: yes so you have a pretty extensive german program there 

549.63 550.82 A: yeah 

550.37 558.06 B: yes well that's that's great because i hear that german programs in many universities today are kind of struggling to survive yes 

558.09 559.92 A: yeah 

560.32 564.97 A: i think all arts and sciences it's not the way it used to be 

564.57 567.12 B: yeah yeah 

566.40 570.94 A: i wish someone had told me that when i was going to graduate school 

570.18 571.97 B: well where did you do your uh-huh 

571.85 574.33 A: ah graduate school i went to penn 

574.48 578.78 B: okay yeah yeah well not a bad place to go 

578.43 579.38 A: no 

579.90 584.46 A: no it's not it's you know it's okay but 

581.16 582.92 B: [laughter] yeah 

586.13 586.86 B: (( yes )) 

586.92 588.51 A: [lipsmack] but um 

589.13 598.26 A: you know they didn't i mean but if you look at the statistics like twenty years before that i would have a full time tenured position somewhere 

598.54 600.39 A: which i do not have right 

600.24 602.56 B: uh-huh yeah well 

601.83 607.48 A: now you know where am i where am i you know what i mean it's a lot harder there are a lot fewer jobs not like yeah 

607.27 608.36 B: (( yes )) 

608.53 619.49 B: yeah it's it's true you pretty much have to take what you are offered and not that much possibility to select like where you want to be and where you want to teach and so on 

619.23 627.75 A: right unless you're like you know the hot a hot person how you get to become a hot person like that i do not know [laughter] 

619.86 620.96 B: yeah 

626.21 630.22 B: i don't know publish yourself crazy and 

629.60 630.93 A: yeah 

630.28 642.22 B: not have a life yes yes so you know i guess that'll be the equivalent to watching these reality shows not have a life just right articles 

631.35 632.45 A: right 

640.47 641.49 A: yeah 

642.38 644.46 A: i guess yeah i mean you know 

644.87 645.96 B: yeah 

644.87 645.70 A: (( it's )) 

645.85 657.04 A: it's tough i'd just like to you know i pretty much like to teach i have some ideas but you know and i write a few things do go to a few conferences every year but you know i'm not going to kill myself 

656.69 668.42 B: yeah yeah yeah i pretty much killed myself at one point [laughter] i tried to tried to get stuff out and that helped me to get a job but i'm still an assistant professor 

661.26 662.21 A: oh 

668.44 669.56 A: right 

668.99 669.88 B: mm 

670.31 671.38 B: yeah
