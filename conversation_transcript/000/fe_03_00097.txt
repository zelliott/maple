99.15 106.48 A: that he really isn't a millionaire but rather he's a construction worker who earns nineteen thousand dollars a year 

107.24 108.85 B: so what's the 

109.18 112.02 B: and these women will not have heard this news before

112.59 115.34 B: how how do you keep them from finding that out that's what i want to know 

121.52 123.31 A: and then it's uh supposedly 

123.49 126.37 A: to see will true love win out you know 

125.53 130.42 B: yeah yeah yeah yeah it's like that temptation island one too which i thought was really really 

130.54 132.62 A: yeah i never saw that one 

130.63 130.92 B: (( )) 

132.14 135.41 B: i didn't see it either i just remember david letterman making jokes about it so 

135.11 139.45 A: but you can't help but hear about it it's everywhere you know 

138.50 143.41 B: oh well it's on the front page of the new york times that the bachelor stuff was and you know even though i don't 

143.77 148.14 B: read the newspaper every day sooner or later it shows up some place 

145.34 146.56 A: yeah 

148.29 154.27 A: yeah either i know people who watch who start talking about it and i over hear there conversations 

154.22 154.62 B: right 

154.77 157.55 A: or i see the ads on t._v. or 

157.80 159.47 A: i read about it you know 

159.17 159.58 B: yeah 

159.63 160.66 A: and uh 

160.85 162.46 A: so i just try to 

162.82 166.47 A: stay away from it all together but um it's hard 

165.82 168.52 B: well are you at a university or of school or something too 

168.12 169.03 A: yeah mhm 

168.86 173.26 B: yeah so it's like it's in the school papers and students are talking about are you a student yeah 

172.26 173.08 A: oh yeah 

173.36 173.98 A: yeah 

174.16 176.71 A: yeah and and you know it just 

174.30 174.82 B: yeah 

177.13 179.90 A: and why is it so popular 

180.41 182.44 A: that's what kills me i just 

181.96 183.50 B: i don't know 

183.59 185.26 A: you know to think that 

185.80 188.93 A: it's so popular you know i really think 

189.76 193.99 A: first of all most of the people who are in it are doing it for fame and 

194.15 195.09 A: publicity 

195.77 203.59 B: yeah but it's like who it's so (( )) you're you're really embarrassingly silly or or dumb or 

203.88 210.02 B: or just i mean for me i just think it's like why would i want people out there i i think i'd rather not be famous than have people think i'm like 

210.68 211.38 B: something 

211.24 216.39 A: see that's how i felt too and oh i i had a bunch of students who were talking about um 

216.92 221.50 A: you know the bachelor and how cute he was and everything and i foun- 

220.86 224.46 B: well he was pretty cute i saw his picture 

222.64 231.29 A: yeah he is cute you know and and there all like oh you know it's so romantic and i was like you know 

231.40 233.91 A: who wants your most private 

234.20 235.78 A: feelings and thoughts 

236.17 238.75 A: broadcast to the world you know 

238.92 242.84 B: i sometimes wonder if there's sort of no sense of shame anymore or something maybe that's 

243.08 243.86 B: what it is it 

244.08 244.50 B: it's uh 

245.19 247.63 B: it's e- it's hard to it's hard to embarrass people 

247.61 249.20 A: em- yeah yeah 

248.60 256.44 B: you know it's a fairly open i guess we're a fairly open society we can talk a lot about stuff like this maybe maybe it just seems like that's the next step is then put it all up on the 

257.53 262.36 B: on the t._v. well i don't know how old you are do do you remember the loud family on p._b._s. 

262.46 263.54 A: no 

263.50 270.41 B: you're probably not old enough cause you sound still like you have a youngish voice but they were on p._b._s. like twenty five years ago or something and they went in have you ever heard of them 

268.95 269.78 A: mhm 

270.55 271.80 A: no uh-huh 

271.03 280.17 B: they went to this it was uh it was like an original reality thing they actually went into this family's house and taped them for i don't know how many weeks over a year 

279.62 284.52 A: okay yeah i i have heard about this i didn't know that was the name but yeah 

282.35 282.63 B: i 

283.83 290.80 B: yeah and you know the marriage was breaking up one kid was coming out of the closet it was you know like five or six kids it was just really 

291.23 294.75 B: that was real reality t._v. because it didn't seem to to 

295.29 301.38 B: you know they didn't seem to alter any of it for anybody so but i i only saw little bits of that because i we didn't 

297.56 298.24 A: mhm 

298.41 299.06 A: mhm 

301.48 305.63 B: have p._b._s. at the time so i just remember seeing it when it was on the news but 

305.89 310.86 B: yeah that sort of was more interesting cause it's kind of more socil- sociological or kind of ethnographic i guess 

311.15 311.61 B: you know 

311.31 315.94 A: yeah yeah and and you know where do you draw the line i mean sometimes 

316.35 318.05 A: it could be you know 

318.29 323.64 A: perhaps instrumental but with other like you know something like that if you were looking at 

323.92 327.60 A: the dynamics of a family or you know 

327.78 329.46 A: that kind of thing but with um 

330.24 334.76 A: some of these shows like fear factor where they eat bugs and 

333.55 344.22 B: oh i saw yeah my sister-in-law loves that show she watches it with her four year old kid and i say god i hope charlotte's not getting any ideas watching this because 

349.96 350.86 B: right 

355.46 360.88 A: three days of work a year you know so they love it and 

356.18 356.69 B: right 

360.28 366.17 B: and they can get people to do stuff that's way more outrageous than you could than an actor can probably come up with i think 

365.86 369.11 A: yeah yeah and then um they have those 

369.68 372.62 A: movie jackass i don't know if you've heard about that 

371.95 378.15 B: well i just i i've seen commercials for it and just thought oh yeah that's a really good idea 

376.24 382.82 A: yeah and like you know there are fifteen year old kids out there like setting themselves on fire just 

384.26 385.21 A: yes 

386.02 387.00 A: yes 

387.83 392.21 B: (( )) well of course they say well don't don't try this at home (( )) 

390.73 395.15 A: oh i know i know it's so silly and then um 

395.91 400.56 B: well are those like reality t._v. things though are those the same kind of reality t._v. things though 

401.36 403.47 B: the jackass stuff or is that 

402.48 403.17 A: well 

403.62 404.68 B: that's uh 

403.72 404.13 A: eh 

404.29 406.78 A: i don't know it's i guess i guess there's th- 

406.91 413.63 A: two different kinds you could probably say there's the you know uh fly on the wall kind of reality 

414.15 424.95 A: show where there you know just filming whatever happens and then there's the more contrived oh let's make something happen and then film it you know so 

424.35 425.36 B: oh yeah 

425.70 427.22 A: so i think like you know 

427.94 435.32 A: the american family or or the um osbournes or something like that that's probably more like the fly on the wall 

435.50 436.18 A: whereas 

436.58 440.21 A: fear factor and jackass 

438.50 441.42 B: is is like creating the whole thing 

440.66 445.01 A: uh creating it yeah and then they even have had like uh 

445.66 449.22 A: oh the mole and the amazing race and 

449.07 457.85 B: god i am so out of it i mean i watch a lot of t._v. but i'm obviously not watching all the right stuff cause half of these i haven't heard about well i mean 

454.41 457.53 A: well i don't watch them i really don't it's like 

458.15 461.90 B: i i probably would if i were just sitting around 

458.17 459.27 A: i don't even watch 

460.93 464.57 A: well yeah and the thing is too once you get hooked 

464.87 466.64 B: you want to see what's going to happen 

465.05 467.86 A: then you want you know it's better than a soap 

468.39 469.58 B: well yeah 

468.42 468.75 A: well 

469.70 476.09 B: because you think it's real (( )) well that i guess that's part of it too we think it's real so it just seems more 

476.45 484.64 B: maybe maybe that's it it's like seems seems like it's better than something's that's acted and maybe cause everybody figures well hey that could be me 

484.74 485.52 A: yeah 

485.53 485.95 B: i mean 

485.69 489.73 A: yeah and you know what they say real reality is often 

489.89 491.48 A: stranger than fiction 

491.10 492.30 B: right 

491.64 496.16 A: so there you have it i just i really fear for 

496.33 502.56 A: you know the trend of where it's going i could see like you know some of the talk shows have had 

503.09 506.07 A: people murdering people after 

505.22 508.04 B: yeah like that jenny jones incident yeah 

506.48 514.06 A: e- right and you know i would not be surprised if someone ended up seriously you know injured 

514.23 515.43 A: on you know 

515.54 518.01 A: on one of these shows and 

519.37 523.38 A: you know it'll be fodder for the masses 

524.78 527.87 B: but don't you think that the networks and the producers have themselves 

528.34 532.15 B: pretty covered in those terms and that that that just makes it even 

533.75 536.16 B: i mean it it gives them even more 

536.78 541.68 B: oomph for the for the show because there there they are 

541.86 546.84 B: you know (( )) see really bad stuff can happen it's not all faked out of course there there 

547.43 550.39 B: there c._y._a. because they've had everybody sign so many releases 

550.49 551.11 B: i think it 

550.79 552.41 A: right right 

551.59 553.44 B: you almost wonder whether they're waiting for something 

553.77 555.70 B: really juicy to happen 

555.46 559.88 A: i mean i i know i've i've read and believe me i i just read 

559.98 561.86 A: stuff and hear about it but i'd 

562.02 564.62 A: try so hard not to watch any of it but um
