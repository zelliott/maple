138.02 138.62 B: okay 

139.08 143.48 A: yeah i i i don't know gossiping when it's a positive gossip 

144.00 147.88 A: i think it's good when it becomes like ah negative gossip i i 

144.53 144.95 B: [breath] 

148.09 150.03 A: i can't stand hearing anything 

150.18 151.55 B: yeah yeah i agree 

150.58 151.06 A: you know it 

151.19 153.28 A: it's good to say good things 

153.76 158.40 A: [breath] and gossip about somebody's good side of things 

154.31 155.02 B: yeah yeah 

158.49 158.94 B: yeah 

158.90 161.18 A: but um (( yeah )) 

161.68 162.12 B: yeah 

163.04 171.60 B: yeah and they actually yeah talking about positive gossip i think that's kind of necessary actually sometimes it's a good way to just you know pass on the good things about other people 

163.25 164.42 A: that's how i feel 

171.75 179.97 B: (( )) kind of way and sometimes (( do )) and especially if you don't want to complement somebody directly because you may feel that it's 

172.04 172.73 A: yeah 

180.16 181.31 B: sounds like flattery 

181.94 185.75 B: and this is actually a way just to show that i really appreciate somebody's 

182.11 182.79 A: yeah 

186.04 187.02 B: you know something 

186.37 187.00 A: mhm 

187.78 189.18 A: and it's ah it it 

189.89 191.90 A: seems like a necessary thing 

192.37 192.78 A: in 

193.00 193.83 A: social 

194.47 198.72 A: this society you know it's it's something that could not easily be 

199.00 199.47 B: yeah 

199.09 201.97 A: it's always going to be there in some way or another 

202.18 203.13 B: yeah i believe that 

202.38 205.08 A: and ah whether it's political or 

205.53 205.94 A: just 

206.28 206.83 A: personal 

206.91 207.41 B: uh-huh 

207.84 208.35 B: [breath] 

208.10 208.72 A: yeah 

209.44 216.70 B: so let's say let's say we are talking about an act of gossiping and let's say that there is somebody who you know who just happens to have 

216.81 217.83 B: all of this stuff 

218.02 228.84 B: you know an act of gossiping smoking excessive drinking and overeating and not exercising at all so which one do you think is relatively speaking most intolerable 

222.20 222.81 A: mhm 

230.39 230.86 B: [breath] 

232.87 233.59 A: i (( )) i 

233.77 234.85 A: it's hard to say 

234.87 236.36 B: [laugh] yeah 

235.47 236.13 A: um 

236.87 238.14 A: (( )) maybe [breath] 

240.67 241.28 A: hm 

242.71 246.04 A: you couldn't explain how it's just one of it i think it's pretty 

246.44 247.00 A: um 

247.35 249.47 A: maybe if if they were just gossiping 

249.47 249.86 B: mhm 

250.02 250.72 A: but 

250.89 254.14 A: not being very not being in an ego way 

254.33 254.84 B: yeah 

254.62 256.95 A: okay and maybe it's okay 

256.35 257.04 B: uh-huh 

257.11 259.86 A: and drinking from time to oh excessively 

259.99 260.44 B: mhm 

260.49 264.36 A: e- e- everything could (( )) to something i think even gossiping 

264.52 264.94 B: yeah 

265.44 267.21 A: they're (( enjoyable )) 

266.49 267.31 B: uh-huh 

267.59 268.12 B: [breath] 

267.96 271.66 A: yeah but anything excessive i think ah 

272.01 273.51 A: e- it's something 

274.21 274.75 A: that 

274.89 275.94 A: challenges us 

277.34 279.59 A: at cer- certain points to rethink 

279.68 280.09 A: what 

280.21 281.68 A: we want in life 

281.64 282.05 B: yeah 

282.54 285.70 A: but i do know people who are happy who 

286.15 287.37 A: have a lot of habits 

287.52 287.96 B: mhm 

288.83 292.56 A: and but still they're very good people and they're very happy 

292.94 294.52 A: and i know people who 

295.02 295.97 A: do everything 

296.14 296.70 B: uh-huh 

296.59 298.19 A: to keep themselves healthy 

298.31 298.89 B: uh-huh 

299.16 299.53 A: but 

299.66 300.94 A: they have a terrible life 

301.41 302.50 A: they're very unhappy 

301.96 308.59 B: yeah e- yeah that's true so actually um yeah these kind of habits don't necessarily make people happy or unhappy e- 

303.18 304.16 A: [laugh] 

308.83 309.24 B: (( rather )) 

308.88 309.44 A: yeah 

309.68 311.32 B: an attitude towards life i guess 

311.89 312.47 A: mhm 

312.21 315.13 B: yeah and i think i- as long as if it's somebody else 

315.43 318.99 B: personal habits it doesn't and as long as that's not really you (( )) other people 

320.06 324.13 B: and as long as it's not really hurting that somebody himself or herself 

320.15 320.77 A: yeah 

324.45 326.34 B: apparently then it should be okay 

324.85 325.40 A: yeah 

327.19 327.61 B: [breath] 

327.43 332.56 A: but i think as friends if we see somebody with excessive habit and 

332.89 334.04 A: if he really 

334.55 336.94 A: yo- you want to say something [laugh] 

335.87 340.00 B: say something yeah because you know that if you are maybe drinking too much it's not going to be 

337.24 337.66 A: (( )) 

340.34 341.29 B: too good for 

341.47 342.34 B: for him yeah 

342.56 343.33 A: yeah 

342.98 343.65 B: [breath] 

343.70 345.02 A: smoking drinking 

343.85 344.18 B: [breath] 

345.61 347.11 A: all those all those things 

358.26 359.58 A: it's ve- it's very 

359.76 361.95 A: similar (( )) to coffee i think 

361.95 362.79 B: uh-huh oh really 

362.54 366.65 A: and i think the reason why people can't well one of the 

367.27 369.56 A: reasons that i heard um 

370.21 370.46 A: is 

370.78 371.28 A: that 

372.27 376.76 A: things like coffee got coffee caffeine nicotine sugar they eat 

377.56 380.97 A: it makes to creative ah create um 

377.64 378.42 B: (( )) 

381.11 381.81 A: how do i know 

382.02 382.45 B: uh-huh 

382.39 384.53 A: (( )) e it keeps you 

384.76 388.15 A: able to keep on going under extreme stress 

388.31 388.90 B: i see 

388.81 390.35 A: when the body needs to sleep 

390.58 391.12 B: i see 

391.22 395.16 A: and (( )) if you have deadlines and things it gives you more energy. 

395.24 395.62 B: mhm 

396.14 400.13 A: e- but then when you start depending on that the brain 

400.54 403.76 A: wouldn't make the adrenaline anymore on it's own 

403.87 404.44 B: i see 

404.98 407.96 A: then you feel like when you stop you have no 

408.36 411.26 A: energy like if you like you just can't go on 

411.29 413.45 B: [laugh] i see 

411.53 412.10 A: [laugh] 

412.84 413.60 A: i think that 

413.82 414.20 B: [breath] 

413.88 415.47 A: that's one thing i heard 

415.59 416.14 B: mhm 

416.01 418.35 A: and f- from my experience it was 

418.45 419.16 A: really 

419.84 420.47 A: the same as 

420.60 423.59 A: eating i i (( still have them )) before but 

423.85 425.56 A: when i fasted i've had this 

425.72 426.99 A: similar effect 

427.32 429.43 A: when i started like the first day 

429.38 429.77 B: mhm 

429.75 431.51 A: i had compulsive 

432.07 435.36 A: desire to put something in my mouth 

432.88 433.94 B: to eat [laugh] 

434.07 435.47 B: [breath] i see 

435.83 436.89 B: yeah 

436.54 439.19 A: and um it was the same thing when i 

439.60 441.77 A: w- when i was quitting smoking 

442.20 442.64 B: mhm 

442.23 444.21 A: at one point and ah 

444.76 446.13 A: they're there's e- 

446.98 449.72 A: it's a oral sensation it's um 

450.54 451.44 A: something e- 

451.57 455.21 A: it's a habit of doing something in order to alleviate an anxiety 

455.36 455.74 B: yeah 

455.87 456.83 A: and stress 

457.32 460.32 A: so you have to find something to replace that 

457.50 457.80 B: yeah 

460.30 461.19 B: oh i see 

460.67 461.64 A: before 

463.00 463.93 A: something else 

463.83 471.63 B: i see so that's why people have developed all kinds of ah strange things like certain kinds of candies to help people give up smoking 

464.90 465.49 A: yeah 

470.65 471.32 A: yeah 

471.69 476.73 A: i think all these are really (( )) you know they create something that you're really interested in 

471.91 472.35 B: [breath] 

476.61 477.15 B: uh-huh 

477.36 478.59 A: that could take place 

477.38 477.96 B: yeah 

478.77 480.43 A: ah that's mm you know it 

480.55 480.89 A: so 

482.02 482.46 B: mhm 

482.20 484.34 A: e- it's hard it's hard to [laugh] 

484.31 490.00 B: yeah it takes quite some time i guess and ah my father actually tried to give up smoking several times 

490.63 493.96 B: and i think that was once he even stopped smoking for almost 

490.87 491.38 A: hm 

495.11 496.99 B: i guess three or four weeks 

497.59 504.55 B: then i don't know why that he started smoking you know one or two cigarettes every day and then you know it just increased to you know 

505.37 506.56 A: is he a heavy smoker 

505.40 506.29 B: what he used to do 

506.87 507.27 B: [laugh] 

507.65 508.71 B: [breath] sorry 

509.14 510.45 A: is he heavy smoker 

510.37 512.23 B: [breath] ah um 

512.34 516.68 B: yeah i guess he he would smoke something like a half a package every day 

517.68 518.25 A: oh 

517.95 518.85 B: yeah he used to 

518.36 518.94 A: yeah 

519.04 520.10 B: you know to be like that 

520.88 521.70 A: yeah 

521.43 527.21 B: yeah but he tried several times because he had some problem with he coughed a lot it was 

527.57 528.57 A: yeah yeah 

527.65 528.59 B: (( )) when 

529.32 536.12 B: [breath] yeah but i guess we do that we we did all try very hard to give it up 

536.98 537.67 A: [laugh] 

540.18 542.61 A: maybe (( )) he should just cut down 

547.22 547.94 A: oh 

550.23 552.06 B: do something to 

551.68 552.27 A: [laugh] 

552.32 553.49 B: just i don't know as 

553.68 555.15 B: yeah as a replacement maybe 

555.58 559.44 B: but right now i'm happy that he has eventually totally given up smoking 

555.61 556.33 A: [laugh] 

560.20 560.77 A: mhm 

560.66 562.35 B: yeah so it's kind of good for him 

563.36 563.90 A: yeah 

565.16 566.16 A: and the drinking too 

566.37 566.93 A: [laugh] 

567.04 568.48 B: oh yeah he drinks a lot 

569.23 570.11 B: but um 

570.01 572.19 A: but he's not alcoholic or anything so 

571.54 574.67 B: yeah but still he he can kind of control because he 

574.58 575.30 A: yeah 

574.92 579.59 B: yeah he never had a drinking problem though he drinks a lot but he can deal with that 

580.11 580.78 B: and ah it 

580.15 580.84 A: mhm 

581.07 582.89 B: so far it doesn't see to have ah 

583.26 585.15 B: done any any hard to him 

585.29 587.21 B: so we are okay with that but um 

588.05 590.16 B: yeah smoking i guess that's 

590.45 594.75 B: maybe more harmful because drinking he can control that he knows where to stop 

592.46 592.91 A: yeah 

595.00 597.72 A: yeah (( )) as long as he don't become alcoholic 

595.49 595.78 B: yeah 

597.83 604.34 B: yeah yeah that's actually because some people they can't actually take a lot of they are better than some people in terms of 

598.38 599.51 A: then yeah 

605.03 609.20 B: [breath] they can deal with that well. but as for me i can't drink at all as 

607.46 607.96 A: mhm 

610.25 612.72 B: of how ever much i drink i just get i get 

612.83 618.49 B: [breath] i'm at my fa- my face will turn red, and i feel dizzy and i just can't do anything 

617.24 617.90 A: [laugh] 

618.61 619.29 B: so 

619.04 620.74 A: [laugh] yeah 

619.59 620.61 B: [breath] yeah 

620.97 627.94 B: but sometimes people say if you say especially for young people like me if you're a young guy and you don't drink and if you don't 

621.52 622.92 A: once in a while i think 

628.29 630.25 B: smoke at all then some people think 

628.78 629.32 A: [laugh] 

630.49 632.17 B: huh you're kind of freak 

632.76 633.08 B: well 

633.38 634.89 B: but some people think it's okay because
