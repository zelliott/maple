93.02 93.67 B: midori 

94.26 100.58 B: yeah i know it's it's very inauthentic i would say having never been to japan even i can kind of tell 

97.15 97.76 A: yeah 

99.45 107.29 A: yeah it's i mean it's not to me it's not even very good food so much less authentic japanese food

111.49 112.07 B: mhm 

113.14 115.32 A: although their prices has gone up 

115.22 115.92 B: oh have they 

115.99 124.06 A: yeah yeah i i think so so last time i was there like the hamburger thing was like nine dollars and i thought that's kin- kind of a lot so 

116.19 117.53 B: i haven't been there in a while 

121.72 122.59 B: wow 

123.28 124.23 B: that's crazy 

124.27 130.03 A: yeah so so getting back to the topic i think if i were going to eat a nine dollar hamburger i'd probably stay home 

129.11 130.98 B: no doubt 

132.39 133.75 A: yeah 

134.41 136.29 A: well um in general do you 

136.92 139.08 A: would you rather eat out or at home 

138.24 142.96 B: i don't know i think i would rather eat at home there are few things though like that i 

151.60 156.84 B: that are to go out but if it's something like i don't know pasta i would rather cook it at home than go out 

157.79 158.93 B: exorbitant amount for something 

159.16 160.24 B: probably mediocre and 

160.52 162.09 B: something that i could do better myself 

161.99 163.01 A: yeah yeah 

163.23 164.26 B: yeah how about you 

176.84 185.37 A: steak houses to eat steak and i i really never order steak and we barely have it at home anyway um you know i i stay away from 

182.38 182.89 B: right 

185.48 186.05 B: red meat 

185.82 193.96 A: you know red meat in restaurants especially it's it's weird i'd rather eat sea food you know if i'm going out yeah i'd rather eat something i can't cook 

186.45 186.92 B: yeah 

190.41 190.80 B: uh-huh 

193.51 193.97 B: right

202.41 203.89 A: eat out quite a bit and 

204.69 206.04 A: i guess if uh
