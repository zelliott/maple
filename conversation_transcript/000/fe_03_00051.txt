0.67 2.95 A: hello this is saskia 

1.68 2.70 B: (( hello )) 

3.40 4.77 B: (( hi this is steve )) 

5.01 6.80 A: hello how are you 

6.82 7.80 B: i'm fine 

7.86 9.15 B: (( can you hear me all right )) 

7.92 8.78 A: um 

10.07 13.46 A: do you have any strong opinions on any of these things 

13.16 17.11 B: um i would have to say gossiping is the worst 

16.87 17.84 A: how come 

19.17 20.81 B: well 

21.73 25.46 B: oh um it's an intuition let me think 

28.95 31.14 B: all right let me put it this way 

34.09 36.65 B: how does one gossip in moderation 

37.59 38.74 A: [laughter] 

39.69 42.66 A: uh rarely do it [laughter] 

44.64 51.79 B: so so so one can eat in moderation one can drink alcohol in moderation but one really can't gossip in moderation 

44.75 45.83 A: i don't know 

52.28 53.52 A: mm really 

53.89 55.35 B: well i don't think so 

55.23 60.21 A: i feel like that's what i do [laughter] and then i feel guilty about it 

57.57 58.49 B: (( [laughter] )) 

60.60 68.37 A: i it's funny because i feel the opposite i feel like well okay gossiping involves other people so that's not good but as far as like surviving 

68.25 69.41 B: mhm 

69.18 74.68 A: it's it's the least threatening of the other things which are all physical 

75.19 81.79 A: um and i don't think that any of them are good but i was thinking at least as far as surviving the other things are 

82.50 86.22 A: not so good um but that they're all equal 

84.16 85.06 B: (( sure )) 

86.33 95.72 A: because um not exercising overeating smoking well maybe smoking is the worst because it's direct pollutant to your lungs 

86.40 87.27 B: true 

96.21 101.35 B: well i guess okay here here here's something interesting you can't gossip by yourself 

99.30 100.24 A: mhm 

102.17 106.82 A: right oh so there's two people involved [laughter] 

103.60 104.43 B: (( so )) 

104.74 105.58 B: (( the )) 

105.90 108.60 B: necessarily involve other people right 

108.22 111.33 A: [mn] at least three other people [laughter] 

111.37 121.10 B: so so you can you can drink excessively by yourself but as long as you're in your own home and you're not causing trouble for anybody 

121.40 124.24 B: you're not doing anything harmful to anyone else 

124.50 126.72 B: you know you're simply harming your own body 

124.73 125.77 A: right 

126.83 137.63 B: whereas when you're gossiping you know it may not be the the content of your gossip may not be very harmful but you're you're still doing something to somebody else without that person's permission 

138.04 142.21 A: right no i do agree it's really disempowering actually um 

142.70 146.64 A: to the whole community like everyone involved including the gossiper 

146.49 147.95 B: mhm 

147.87 148.77 A: (( mm )) 

149.30 152.10 A: gosh maybe they're not ma- well 

152.23 156.60 A: i was thinking on a very basic level you know of human survival so 

157.79 160.60 A: but maybe socially at least 

160.81 163.12 A: they're all the same like 

163.20 165.07 B: (( right [cough] )) 

165.16 168.37 B: w- would you agree that not exercising is the least harmful 

168.97 169.94 A: (( um )) 

170.52 174.58 A: well yeah just it's all contextual really because 

174.13 176.40 B: because plenty of people don't exercise 

176.49 177.53 A: mhm 

177.33 180.77 B: it's not such a terrible thing not to exercise right 

180.13 186.60 A: oh i don't know because i think that's one of the like uh the causes of cancer and things like that because um 

187.46 201.58 A: you know your cells need to move and regenerate and i feel like exercising helps that renewal process and if you don't exercise i feel like that's where all the toxins get stored and then you look at how many people are dying and aren't healthy 

201.42 202.48 B: right 

201.68 211.54 A: i think ac- you know kids naturally exercise but as we we get older we get more sedentary and we get more diseases and i think it's partly related to that 

211.97 213.10 A: to stopping 

212.25 213.97 B: (( hm )) 

214.21 215.00 A: (( hm )) 

215.06 216.08 B: (( that's true )) 

217.48 225.08 A: [mn] yeah you know in terms still going back to the gossiping thing i'm thinking maybe maybe even not as harmful 

225.10 229.62 A: you know on a physical level to some degree whether we can track it or not 

229.46 231.65 B: right yeah 

230.49 232.65 A: be- because it is negative 

233.30 234.22 B: true 

235.99 236.67 B: (( mm )) 

236.12 238.29 A: and like when we gossip 

239.09 240.92 A: it's really like 

241.25 249.53 A: it's it's like coming from a disempowering place so i'm sure that there is some kind of chemical that must be released from that too do you 

249.89 252.41 B: yeah yeah probably 

249.91 250.93 A: (( know what i mean )) 

253.34 256.51 A: it's maybe a more subtle neuro chemical or something 

256.35 257.06 B: uh-huh 

257.85 259.31 B: well it it it 

258.41 259.05 A: (( [mn] )) 

259.58 260.49 B: i mean 

260.97 267.23 B: like you said gossiping makes you feel guilty sometimes and that maybe why it has an adverse effect on your health 

264.04 265.00 A: mhm 

267.97 268.92 A: right 

269.38 270.63 B: or um 

269.89 270.53 A: (( w- )) 

270.78 274.59 B: the the consequences of gossiping sup- suppose you gossip about someone 

275.05 276.82 B: and then that person treats you 

276.85 279.59 B: less nicely because you gossiped about that person 

278.60 281.18 A: well of course right [mn] 

280.07 284.10 B: and that that that definitely affects your health you know how people treat you 

284.11 288.99 B: you know affects your mood and and that's that's definitely you know that can be very unhealthy for you 

289.18 289.92 A: (( hm )) 

290.48 295.13 A: yeah definitely and how you treat other people too whether you're aware of it or not 

295.09 295.83 B: mhm 

295.31 297.41 A: i think has negative impacts 

297.73 298.63 B: right 

298.99 300.74 A: so hm 

301.36 305.38 A: maybe yeah maybe they are the same or maybe maybe they're um 

306.42 315.49 A: [lipsmack] it depends on the motivation well gossiping doesn't seem to have any good motivations but i think sometimes um drinking alcohol can actually be a positive thing 

316.02 316.94 A: (( you know )) 

316.07 319.22 B: mhm yeah i agree 

319.14 320.99 A: yeah so 

320.83 323.61 B: and overeating can do positive things sometimes 

321.32 322.11 A: (( yeah )) 

323.68 324.68 A: what's that 

324.74 331.33 B: overeating i think can be positive sometimes i mean there's overeating i have to say but but if if if you have a big holiday 

327.08 328.29 A: oh yeah 

331.44 332.40 A: mhm 

331.53 333.27 B: you know like thanksgiving dinner 

333.54 335.52 B: i think that's a good time to overeat 

335.55 336.41 B: (( you know it's )) 

335.82 336.77 A: right 

336.55 347.38 B: i think i think it's good to feel really full and have this you know excess of food at thanksgiving just to remind you of you know how much people people can give you know 

347.47 349.55 A: mhm interesting 

348.36 349.24 B: so 

349.42 353.14 B: so overeating sometimes i think also is is a good thing 

353.15 354.27 B: um when it 

353.23 357.13 A: that's interesting because i think about other animals you know that do that 

357.27 361.88 A: and um specifically like lions it seems like they do it sometimes 

361.32 366.81 B: yeah yeah yeah they'll eat an incredible amount and then just sleep all day right 

366.23 367.22 A: mhm 

368.15 368.83 A: hm 

369.65 373.31 A: interesting okay what are the other things there's alcohol 

373.21 375.40 B: smoking um 

374.53 375.62 A: smoking 

375.62 376.70 B: caffeine 

375.80 376.79 A: gossip 

377.79 380.59 A: overeating and not exercising 

380.59 382.32 B: right 

381.79 385.56 A: not exercising can also help be positive too right because 

385.71 388.01 A: you need your body to repair 

389.57 390.87 A: itself 

391.91 393.55 B: (( yeah i guess )) 

391.98 393.45 A: so i mean 

395.76 396.91 A: are you still there 

396.88 400.74 B: yeah i'm still there um w- what do you mean by like 

401.18 402.36 B: like not 

401.57 402.41 A: well 

402.42 407.54 A: like people who exercise every single day can damage themselves so i'm starting 

406.26 407.43 B: right right 

407.62 411.18 A: to think about like the balance of things 

410.01 410.90 B: mhm 

411.12 411.68 B: (( [cough] )) 

411.34 415.54 A: like even that there's a balance in overeating like overeating can be good sometimes 

415.65 416.54 B: mhm 

415.93 419.31 A: 'cause you can feel good though your stomach is full and 

419.27 420.85 B: right right 

420.70 426.77 A: and the same with alcohol even like you can become intoxicated and have it be a completely pleasurable experience 

426.64 428.21 B: true yeah 

427.89 434.77 A: and i guess sometimes that that can actually be good because it can relieve stress or it can just be really good 

434.51 437.38 B: mhm what about caffeine 

437.62 439.46 B: caffeine is mentioned right 

437.77 440.54 A: caffeine did we talk about caffeine is that on the list 

439.91 443.63 B: uh i think i think that was mentioned too in the topic i 

442.52 443.69 A: oh okay 

444.13 448.28 A: uh i don't know i don't really use caffeine very much um 

447.89 449.86 B: don't either i don't tolerate it very well 

450.06 451.15 A: right 

451.12 456.88 B: um but like is is that a is that a good feeling to have too much coffee in you [laughter] 

456.52 458.29 A: like uh 

459.25 464.17 A: [mn] oh well y- yeah we're talking about too much right uh i don't 

464.65 465.84 A: (( i don't know )) 

465.17 470.00 B: like do people actually try to get caffeine highs i i [laughter] 

468.92 473.42 A: oh yeah they are right because um in highschool people would take um 

473.46 476.38 A: nodoze [laughter] 

475.41 478.46 B: what kinda highschool did you go to [laughter] 

477.42 486.52 A: [noise] [laughter] a regular high school [laughter] lots of lots of kids took nodoze you know for experimenting with 

482.33 483.23 B: (( oh okay )) 

486.93 488.33 A: with caffeine 

488.68 491.44 B: (( nodoze [laughter] )) 

490.49 491.47 A: (( god )) 

491.84 496.73 B: i don't know most kids did marijuana when i was at school not nodoze [laughter] 

491.89 492.93 A: um 

496.16 501.23 A: [noise] [laughter] whatever's available i think was the mentality 

497.20 498.10 B: um 

499.74 502.59 B: i yeah well 

502.80 506.77 B: so is th- is that is that harmful overuse of caffeine 

507.09 510.51 A: yeah i feel like it is but you know i stay away from it so 

510.74 512.99 A: same with smoke um 

511.93 514.06 B: (( but you never hear of people like )) 

514.35 517.65 B: getting health problems because they drink coffee too much do you 

517.82 519.75 B: you know it's it's not like really 

518.25 523.97 A: um i know that it yeah i think that there are i think there are studies that link to that and i think that um 

524.00 529.06 A: definitely agitation diarrhea like those are the immediate effects but also like 

527.88 529.50 B: oh okay 

529.52 532.82 A: um it's it suppresses the adrenal glands 

532.77 533.66 B: uh-huh 

533.04 533.99 A: so 

534.09 537.38 A: i don't think that's very healthy over a long period of time 

537.15 544.20 B: probably isn't it's probably n- i mean clearly it's not as bad as smoking but it's probably still bad 

538.77 540.00 A: yeah 

544.07 551.46 A: i feel like smoking is the number one thing because as soon as you smoke it begins to clearly 

552.56 563.11 A: poison your lungs but you know some people really like it and maybe i it's because uh smoke is a thing that i'm most sensitive to but i also hate gossip and gossiping 

563.43 564.45 A: is 

564.58 569.48 A: you know i don't know i'm just thinking even just a little bit of smoking is really 

570.11 573.99 A: unpleasant for me to be around because that's because that's just what i'm sensitive to 

573.25 573.94 B: uh-huh 

574.90 578.81 B: yeah and clearly excessive smoking isn't is never good is it 

579.66 581.53 A: um right 

581.91 588.65 A: but then also you know the thing about gossip is that like that's what comedians do and on some level 

590.71 591.40 A: (( [sigh] )) 

591.86 595.00 A: i think comedians are great you know 

595.33 597.03 B: mhm 

595.51 607.87 A: and and they take all these things about people and figures that we know and and they they almost turn gossip into an art form [laughter] and it makes us look at ourselves so 

605.38 606.35 B: yeah 

607.64 608.71 B: yeah 

608.21 611.10 A: i guess that would be a positive use of it 

611.94 615.65 B: or i guess i guess gossip that's harmless is 

615.99 617.27 B: is okay 

617.39 618.72 A: yeah 

618.17 621.49 B: as long as you're not you're not putting people down 

621.69 622.68 A: mhm 

622.19 626.57 B: for example for example suppose suppose you're trying to fix up your friend with someone 

626.75 627.90 A: yeah 

626.80 627.57 B: (( you know )) 

628.10 635.43 B: and so you gossip with all your other friends about how you know they're going to go on a date or something and and it's cute it's cute you know 

632.94 633.96 A: (( mm yeah )) 

634.50 637.44 A: it is cute [laughter] right 

636.42 637.30 B: and 

637.33 645.31 B: and also also it is in in some way almost supportive of your friend you know because you're so interested in in how how you know 

642.45 643.18 A: (( mhm )) 

645.59 650.03 B: the relationship might turn out that in that case gossip is entirely a good thing 

650.07 653.64 B: so i think i i r- i revise my original opinion i i guess 

650.16 651.58 A: right 

653.02 656.13 A: [noise] yeah i understand yeah i 

654.97 657.51 B: yeah i i think i would pick smoking then too 

657.94 663.11 A: yeah okay yeah i guess it's just the other things it's like how they're used 

663.90 676.90 A: but like but you know that even i'm totally biased because i'm sensitive to smoke but like even smoke like in native american rituals and other cultures you know is supposed to be really positive it's 

677.56 681.46 A: supposed to make you stronger and in touch with the spiritual world 

681.30 682.16 B: uh-huh 

682.39 692.08 A: so i think even that can be used uh positively but i think it's probably the rarely least positive to use come 

690.32 696.33 B: yeah most people in society don't do that yeah right 

695.44 696.18 A: again 

696.60 701.02 B: most people in this society don't do that though you know they just go out and have their smoke break 

700.93 701.89 A: yeah 

701.53 703.20 B: that's pretty much it so 

703.52 704.65 A: right 

704.91 705.95 A: yep 

706.21 707.31 B: hm interesting 

706.76 707.48 A: (( mm )) 

707.86 708.76 A: and then 

708.71 709.27 B: (( [mn] )) 

709.04 711.06 A: (( yeah i don't know i mean )) 

711.57 719.89 A: i guess i guess i would just come to you like how things are being used and what the motivation is like the underlying motivations behind them are is what
