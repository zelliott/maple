48.97 49.42 B: mhm 

50.05 50.60 A: um 

52.02 52.78 A: it's tough 

53.24 55.71 B: uh well i think that 

57.35 63.84 B: not exercising i'm going to have to cross off because i don't do enough of that so that's not as bad um 

60.56 61.50 A: yeah 

64.20 68.09 B: overeating can be very problematic it's very bad for your health but i don't think it's 

69.11 70.41 B: as bad for your health as smoking 

70.80 75.62 A: right and i think wasn't the question like what's more annoying or what gets on your something like that 

73.93 75.05 B: all right was it 

75.64 76.74 B: oh i thought what was just 

76.92 77.38 B: worse 

77.63 78.30 B: there could be 

77.97 80.46 A: oh okay yeah i wasn't sure i i i 

80.78 81.34 A: thought it was 

81.47 83.54 A: i i i was kind of understanding that it was uh 

84.59 88.61 A: you know what bothers you most in other people 

85.79 90.20 B: oh okay well if that's the case then if that's the case eh i don't know 

90.39 93.49 B: smoking smoking it would probably be between smoking and gossiping 

93.92 95.78 A: yeah i think i'd i think i'd go with 

96.81 98.36 A: probably both of those being uh 

98.70 99.36 A: pretty annoying 

99.69 104.22 A: but depending on my own mood i think that there are times when cigarettes really just bother me 

104.50 104.86 B: yeah 

104.90 107.67 A: um and other times like you know if i go out to the 

107.89 109.38 A: to uh to the bar with some friends 

109.76 113.23 A: um i kind of expect it to be smoky and so it doesn't really bother me as much i don't 

113.38 115.98 A: i don't think about it but if i'm at a restaurant or something 

114.35 114.76 B: mhm 

116.20 117.89 A: luckily our county just past a 

118.41 121.50 A: a no smoking in restaurants thing so um 

120.31 121.90 B: actually they just did here too 

122.02 123.82 B: like within the past couple of weeks so 

122.18 122.64 A: yeah 

123.87 131.76 A: yeah so that's that that's pretty nice but i know that in in bars in bars it's still smoky so but still i expect it to be smoky in there it it doesn't 

125.84 126.82 B: yeah it is 

130.96 131.59 B: mhm 

132.04 133.17 A: bother me as much i guess 

133.40 134.85 B: well i don't i don't know because 

133.77 134.94 A: as when i'm eating 

135.00 135.98 B: the hm 

137.11 140.80 B: the smoking for me has a i i am a previous smoker 

140.82 141.23 A: uh-huh 

141.02 142.32 B: so it has a fee- 

142.06 142.50 A: same here 

142.43 143.86 B: uh it has a uh 

144.40 147.69 B: a real negative effect like physical effect like when i smell it i 

148.30 149.04 B: literally feel 

149.18 150.19 B: nauseous 

150.37 150.76 A: yeah 

150.56 151.58 B: and um 

152.18 153.60 B: so i think even though if 

153.73 158.99 B: i'm prepared like i i very rarely go to a traditional bar anymore because 

159.10 159.58 B: i don't 

160.01 161.40 B: i can't stand the smell of it 

161.82 163.68 B: i can't stand the smell of it on my clothes 

161.87 162.37 A: right 

164.12 164.62 A: yeah 

164.52 167.71 B: you know if it's just one person sitting near me having a cigarette i can 

167.96 169.46 B: tolerate but if it's you know 

169.84 171.09 B: there's smoke in the air 

170.50 171.83 A: mhm 

171.40 172.12 B: around it's 

173.14 178.92 B: it's a little bit too much so now i think i'm pushing that towards the top although gossiping like you said the the context 

179.07 185.97 B: would have to have a lot to do with it because if it's just a couple of friends sitting around like going oh boy guess who did what but if it's in 

186.50 189.03 B: if it's more malicious or if it's in a workplace setting 

189.79 190.14 A: yeah 

190.28 191.42 B: then that's pretty 

191.99 193.39 B: bad and petty 

195.42 197.02 A: yeah that's true i know that i 

197.15 202.61 A: um hm hm just going to jump back to smoking for a second i know that uh i i'm a former smoker as well 

202.95 213.24 A: and one of my things is that if i'm at a bar and i've had a couple of drinks i get tempted to ask someone for one and so that's that's a big problem so i would be a happy man if nobody smoked 

209.06 209.43 B: mhm 

213.33 213.84 B: yeah 

213.39 220.92 A: in a bar at all because partly because of my own weakness to it but i'm also i'm also asthmatic so i know that i can't smoke if i smoke 

220.73 221.12 B: mhm 

221.06 223.20 A: i know that you know the after effects will be horrible 

223.50 223.91 B: yeah 

223.57 224.29 A: even though uh 

224.39 227.41 A: frankly i really enjoy it the uh uh i enjoyed smoking 

225.94 226.40 B: mhm 

227.98 228.44 A: um 

229.16 229.55 A: but i'm 

229.67 233.39 A: yeah i'm super glad that i quit because the after effects are so nasty 

233.70 234.76 A: but gossiping yeah 

235.68 236.76 A: yeah gossiping is 

236.88 238.25 A: um (( )) 

238.73 239.45 A: oh they're 

240.49 242.77 A: some friends of mine who sometimes 

243.37 243.87 A: um 

244.61 250.09 A: you know want to talk about other people and and you know if it's a little bit you now that's fine but then after a while it just 

250.82 254.92 A: turns into kind of a bitch fest of this person is doing that and that person is doing that and it just 

253.37 254.70 B: well exactly if it's 

255.20 258.36 B: if it's like just what's going on with somebody else that's 

258.92 259.96 B: fine but if it's 

260.11 260.51 B: what if 

260.17 260.72 A: yeah 

260.71 263.04 B: you know for complaining about somebody else or if it's 

263.21 264.44 B: belittling someone else 

265.03 266.83 B: i think it has to do with the degree of it 

265.19 265.83 A: right 

267.41 268.28 B: i mean smoking is 

267.78 268.70 A: yeah 

268.46 274.78 B: smoking there's no you know there's no different degree i think you're either smoking or you're not smoking 

270.58 270.83 A: hm 

275.06 277.10 B: but with the with the gossiping i mean there's 

277.66 278.50 B: i don't know there's 

278.52 278.85 A: yeah 

278.92 283.37 B: there's many layers but i don't i don't think humans could get by without talking about other people 

283.75 285.34 A: yeah that's true it's it's uh 

286.02 288.22 A: think it's what they call fated conversations 

289.15 289.49 A: kind of 

290.29 292.37 A: stuff that you things that you say to kind of keep the 

292.67 293.20 A: keep your own 

293.47 295.41 A: social relationship with other people 

295.96 299.86 B: oh sort of like um sort of like um hierarchy of um 

296.06 297.30 A: going 

300.34 302.21 B: conversation or something 

301.99 303.77 A: yeah something like that it was in my 

303.97 306.79 A: class that i had a real long time ago so i don't really remember it that well 

305.51 306.39 B: huh 

307.29 311.20 A: but you know that that brings up another point you you um i think there actually degrees of um 

311.75 312.55 A: of of 

312.68 315.91 A: uh of smoking because there are the rude smokers who will 

316.07 317.30 A: you know hold the cigarette right up in 

317.44 323.35 A: in front of you and kind of blow your blow it right in your face and all that and then others who make a concerted effort to really you know 

320.06 321.41 B: like 

323.89 325.79 A: keep the keep it keep it out of your face 

325.81 326.54 B: that's true 

327.12 327.49 A: so 

327.57 328.48 B: that's true well 

327.98 330.28 A: yeah i mean either way it's a cigarette they're nasty but you know 

330.51 330.90 B: yeah 

330.72 333.63 A: it's it's worse if you have somebody who isn't even making ah an effort 

334.28 334.62 A: to 

335.64 337.58 A: to alleviate some of that 

337.38 337.94 B: well there's 

338.79 340.44 B: fewer of them around 

341.11 344.09 B: but but they are still there but i think that um 

345.70 347.49 B: legislation and all is making it 

347.79 348.42 B: so 

348.64 353.16 B: difficult to smoke at least in the united states that 

354.08 358.35 B: it's hard for people to be extremely rude and get away with it at least in a public place 

357.32 358.20 A: mhm 

358.58 359.00 B: you know 

359.13 360.88 B: because even even in a place where 

370.79 371.79 B: and have them moved 

372.37 373.39 B: you know and there's something that 

373.56 374.72 B: says you know they have to be 

375.20 377.55 B: you know so far from smoke and what have you so 

378.47 380.79 B: so it's getting harder it's getting better but 

381.02 381.62 B: it's 

383.11 384.79 B: i know for a fact that 

385.27 387.38 B: um my sister just went overseas 

388.28 391.08 B: and she was in italy and you know there's no 

398.78 403.24 B: it's just absolutely everywhere and there's no getting away from it and coming form an area where 

399.00 400.51 A: yeah 

403.36 410.60 B: there is quite a bit less of it and you can't say anything to anybody you can't say you know could you please move because if you're not smoking you're in the minority 

408.40 408.85 A: right 

410.17 410.62 A: right 

410.71 411.62 B: and 

411.04 414.69 A: yeah i'm the same way i spent a fair amount in france and it was like that they just 

414.17 414.55 B: yep 

414.94 415.71 A: people would uh 

415.80 418.26 A: you know people just smoke i mean like chain smoke 

419.85 420.48 A: pretty nasty 

420.50 421.30 B: so 

420.89 423.11 A: it's apparently starting to get a little bit better 

423.08 423.50 B: yeah 

423.75 424.13 A: but 

424.72 425.90 A: it's really 

428.58 429.16 A: pardon 

430.97 435.44 B: smoking would be the most annoying things out of that list and probably one of the most annoying things period 

431.03 431.92 A: yeah 

436.08 436.67 A: yeah 

436.48 437.70 B: i don't think i could think of something 

438.31 439.32 A: then again i also 

438.35 439.23 B: too much worse 

439.54 443.44 A: i wor- i worked as a bartender for a while when i was ah doing my undergrad degree 

443.10 443.44 B: mhm 

443.83 445.43 A: and i know that like when people 

445.56 447.48 A: uh certain people drink excessively 

447.64 454.54 A: so that's another one of our choices um there are certain people that when they drink excessively they just get kind of silly and you don't really mind them 

454.82 455.16 B: mhm 

455.20 457.18 A: um and then there are the those other that 

457.48 460.52 A: just get a few beers in them and all of a sudden they're like the king of the world 

460.99 463.88 A: you know they're better than everybody and blah blah blah and they just 

464.13 467.27 A: you know obnoxious or they get mean or something else and it's just 

465.84 467.74 B: yep the people that get mean yeah 

469.00 469.44 A: yeah 

469.65 471.91 A: and it and you just wish that they could you know 

472.21 474.00 A: control themselves you know i mean i 

474.24 474.95 A: i can generally 

475.61 477.71 A: feel that like if i've had a few drinks i'm like okay 

478.03 480.38 A: this is this good this is fun but i should probably 

480.67 484.18 A: i should probably chill out now you know or or else it's going to get ugly 

481.98 482.32 B: yeah 

484.33 487.30 A: and so you know i know to stop it but 

487.34 487.77 B: mhm 

487.41 489.93 A: it just seems like so many people have like no control 

489.66 491.62 B: no control although 

491.78 492.70 B: i 

493.12 500.94 B: i couldn't i couldn't put that at the top of the list because not that i'm a mean drunk but i have been in younger years i 

501.18 502.99 B: drank excessively and 

503.76 505.41 B: so i can't you know i can't 

506.52 507.15 B: what is it 

507.67 512.07 B: throw rocks at a glass house that type of thing 

510.70 513.36 A: yeah 

512.19 512.69 B: so 

513.83 514.49 B: but uh 

515.64 519.00 B: but at the same time yeah ah it's obviously it's terrible when there are 

519.34 521.61 B: mean drunks and um 

522.76 524.54 B: and what did i say the people that uh 

525.69 527.72 B: people that destroy property and 

527.61 528.28 A: oh yeah 

528.47 530.37 B: and uh you know 

530.58 530.92 B: (( )) 

535.25 536.92 B: yeah exactly 

537.34 537.66 B: yep 

538.38 539.83 B: and a lot of it a lot 

539.94 541.02 B: a lot of that is 

541.11 543.72 B: exactly the you know that age group at least 

543.98 544.49 A: yeah 

544.14 550.73 B: um which i am out of now so i can say that but um but i think a lot of it has to do with maturity so 

552.36 554.64 B: there are quite a few people in this world who can't 

554.75 555.71 B: handle drinking 

556.00 556.84 B: you know above 

557.14 558.43 B: the age thirty but i think 

559.16 559.89 B: the um 

560.45 562.47 B: probably if they did a study they'd 

562.81 564.19 B: see like the the majority of
