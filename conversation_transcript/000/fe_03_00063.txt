11.54 12.81 A: oh that's okay

20.00 21.27 B: (( yes [mn] [mn] )) 

21.01 25.38 A: i find that's the only one of the ones that they mentioned that i can't ignore 

25.94 35.93 A: the uh other ones i mean you know the other ones just don't affect me i mean if somebody overeats it doesn't affect me and if somebody gossips i don't have to listen to 

32.52 33.51 B: right 

36.18 38.10 A: 'em but uh 

38.72 43.52 A: you know i've had to work in close quarters with a smoker and i'm allergic to tobacco 

44.53 48.62 B: [mn] [mn] [mn] [mn] well i can appreciate what you're saying and um 

48.82 51.34 B: my um heart goes out to you 

51.78 54.62 B: but um i try to um

68.69 70.15 B: you know but 

74.25 77.56 A: [mn] that'll keep you that'll keep you sneezing 

75.67 82.26 B: oh sure and so many things that we're learning about it you know it is dangerous 

82.05 83.00 A: (( mm well )) 

82.37 85.39 B: but um i've i've always 

85.75 88.24 B: tried to find a nice um 

88.62 93.59 B: little table outside rather than be inside 

92.76 94.30 A: that's a good thing 

93.72 99.93 B: yeah but you know if it's raining or it's very very cold it makes it a bit difficult 

99.71 107.67 A: true i can understand that i mean i'm not i'm not unsympathetic uh certainly it's mostly a matter of of you know 

101.27 102.57 B: (( uh-huh )) 

107.66 115.52 A: the person i s- i i shared my office with was very addicted and you know i recognized this fact 

116.59 118.06 A: you know so uh 

121.43 133.66 A: for the most part he just found other places to smoke but sometimes he was unable to because our work required us to be in that room you know and he'd have to light up and he would do it without thinking 

133.40 137.28 B: [mn] oh definitely but he can't do that now can he 

136.59 140.94 A: oh no no not now but then i don't work there any more anyway [laughter]

150.52 152.01 B: yeah this 

151.09 159.29 A: anyway um well what about the other ones i mean certainly gossip can affect you even if you know you're not the direct uh 

160.34 164.35 A: uh target of it you know i mean people could gossip about you 

164.88 168.62 B: [mn] it depends what you're gossiping ab- gossiping about
