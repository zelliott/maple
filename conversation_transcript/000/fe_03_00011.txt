9.89 12.38 A: um i guess we're supposed to be talking about food 

12.48 15.47 B: i know i think that i'd rather eat at home 

13.16 13.44 A: (( )) 

15.72 16.12 A: mhm 

16.37 18.27 B: only because i'm very picky 

18.67 19.18 B: and i 

19.75 28.44 B: i have like this huge list of foods that i don't like and it seems like if i go to a restaurant it's tough because i have to say i don't want that i want that on the side 

28.71 29.97 A: oh 

29.59 30.23 B: and so 

30.53 36.14 A: i um well i kin- i kind of prefer eating at a restaurant -cause i have more choices 

36.43 38.80 A: um i basically 

38.95 39.77 A: can pretty much eat 

40.36 41.15 A: anything 

41.31 42.31 A: and ah 

43.23 45.62 A: um i guess another thing is that ah 

48.65 49.93 A: so rushed most of the time 

51.79 53.82 A: well if i eat at home it's pretty much just me 

54.32 59.25 B: yeah i live alone and if i eat at home it's okay what can i put in the microwave tonight 

59.61 61.54 B: a lot of times it's that or 

61.79 62.19 B: you know 

62.34 63.12 B: i'll trade with 

63.24 63.62 B: um 

63.84 67.66 B: friends like i'll cook and they'll cook something and then we'll swap for leftovers 

67.99 68.51 A: oh 

68.56 70.27 B: so then it's pretty easy then 

72.55 74.00 A: yeah i mean 

74.54 77.69 A: you know with a restaurant i can usually ah bring something home 

78.19 79.10 B: oh that's true 

79.26 84.57 A: yeah i usually i usually have those kind of leftovers as opposed to anything that i might make which 

84.08 85.22 B: do you live in the city 

85.39 87.22 B: so you have a lot of restaurants to choose from 

87.51 88.18 A: uh yeah 

88.37 89.12 A: basically yeah 

88.67 90.12 B: see i live in the sticks 

90.51 95.80 B: and for me like i could go to a little tiny family restaurant but it seems like everything on that menu 

90.53 91.17 A: oh 

96.15 96.92 B: i can make 

97.09 98.79 A: oh yeah

110.77 111.53 A: um 

111.60 112.41 B: and so

164.78 165.12 B: oh

179.55 180.36 A: (( )) 

179.96 182.21 B: and also even there it's like well 

182.48 183.27 B: i might as well 

183.93 185.21 B: make my own and bring it in 

185.32 186.65 A: that's true that's true 

186.86 188.25 A: what kind of stuff do you normally make 

186.87 187.51 B: but sometimes 

188.53 189.03 B: um 

189.69 193.18 B: well i'll make a lot of casseroles but that means i eat it for the whole 

193.86 194.25 B: week 

194.37 194.75 A: okay 

194.71 195.36 B: like ah 

195.70 197.70 B: just like chicken and croutons and i e- 

197.95 202.24 B: get a lot of those create-a-meals where you just add the chicken or you just add the beef 

202.27 203.11 A: th- ones are pretty good 

203.33 206.52 B: and so then i feel like i'm attempting to eat a balanced meal 

206.51 207.04 A: yeah 

207.20 208.03 B: otherwise 

208.83 211.24 B: i don't know it's a lot of easy mac and oatmeal 

211.58 213.80 B: which is kind of terrible 

212.25 214.82 A: uh yeah actually that's pretty much 

215.06 215.41 A: (( )) 

215.66 220.22 A: what i m- make at home like lots of uh oatmeal or cream of wheat 

220.52 220.82 B: yup 

221.32 223.30 A: and it's it's a lot easier to eat at night 

223.52 224.66 A: um which is when i 

224.82 227.87 A: normally eat after i get home i usually don't get home -til after nine 

227.72 228.94 B: oh wow that's really late 

229.13 230.13 A: yeah 

229.73 233.35 B: i mean for me like i'm done i'm done teaching at two thirty and i could go home 

233.56 235.88 A: oh that yeah that makes 

235.18 238.42 B: but i have a part time job i'm so cheesy i work at like this 

238.83 239.13 B: (( )) 

239.27 239.92 B: farm 

240.02 241.24 B: ice cream store 

241.04 241.43 A: mhm 

241.36 241.84 B: so i eat 

242.22 244.80 B: a lot of ice cream in the summer i'll have ice cream 

245.21 247.02 B: i used to eat five scoops of ice cream 

247.31 249.86 B: a day and that's all i would eat i wouldn't eat any other food 

249.95 251.11 A: well you're getting calcium 

251.20 252.84 B: i know at least that (( whoo hoo )) 

252.94 253.31 B: so 

254.35 256.90 B: but i do eat lot of fruits and vegetables just because 

257.80 259.79 B: you know i work at the store and it's all free

263.52 265.06 B: i eat all the fruits and (( veggies )) i want 

265.32 268.41 A: yeah i have to make more of enough for to eat fruits and vegetables i'll go 

269.58 276.41 A: not really a health kick but i'll i'll eat really really well and really really balanced meals for 

276.57 281.11 A: a good amount of time and then i'll sort of spend the same amount of time like not eating so healthy 

282.04 287.11 A: um which you know is another reason i shouldn't be i shouldn't be going to uh 

287.39 288.14 A: restaurants 

288.34 291.52 A: um mainly because it's it is expensive and it's not as balanced 

291.66 292.10 A: but 

293.29 294.42 B: sometimes it's nice i feel 

294.58 296.79 B: for me i feel pampered to go to a restaurant 

296.88 297.24 A: mhm 

297.20 298.25 B: like oh somebody is going to 

298.49 301.58 B: make exactly what i want and i don't have to cook and i can enjoy 

301.86 302.51 B: company 

303.10 303.62 A: that's true 

303.57 304.48 B: of someone else like 

304.67 308.39 B: sometimes it's okay if one person is coming over and cook 

308.49 311.71 B: but i had a dinner party here the day after thanksgiving 

311.80 312.12 A: mhm 

312.23 315.57 B: and it was like i didn't want to cook because i wanted to socialize

469.32 469.95 B: too much 

470.12 470.66 B: i don't know 

470.86 471.87 B: it seems like 

473.06 476.00 B: lately i've been eating more spicy foods before 

477.27 477.71 B: that i was 

478.02 478.93 B: insanely picky 

479.15 480.34 B: and now it's like wait 

480.52 483.13 B: this isn't as bad as i thought it was you know i had all these 

482.38 482.74 A: oh 

483.58 485.62 B: ideas in my head of things i wouldn't try 

485.93 486.56 B: and i wouldn't eat 

487.49 489.06 B: and then i tried it once oh 

489.18 490.90 B: you know it's not so bad so the next time 

492.15 494.34 B: i keep trying -m my boyfriend loves 

494.45 496.01 B: spicy food everything has to have 

496.35 498.55 B: hot peppers or franks hot sauce 

499.25 499.68 B: on it 

499.89 501.59 B: and so a little bit 

501.71 503.29 B: a little bit at a time 

503.49 504.91 B: i'm getting more used to it 

504.51 507.55 A: is there anything that you like in particular that's like 

507.70 508.57 A: spicy 

509.70 511.94 B: well i really like chili like

513.64 514.08 B: chili 

514.19 515.15 B: my dad makes the best 

514.27 514.73 A: okay 

515.60 516.06 B: and 

516.17 519.89 B: i went to school in ohio and so i had cincinnati chili a lot 

520.17 521.90 A: oh oh i didn't realize 

520.66 521.48 B: and that's over s- 

522.16 524.19 A: cincinnati has a special kind of chili 

523.70 524.91 B: yeah it's over spaghetti 

525.39 526.60 A: oh interesting 

526.52 529.56 B: so it's like chili on top of spaghetti instead of spaghetti sauce 

530.87 531.20 B: and 

531.54 533.47 B: lots and lots of like cheddar cheese 

533.66 534.96 A: i see sounds pretty good 

536.71 538.11 B: i'd probably say that because that 

539.20 539.88 B: (( )) it 

540.26 543.28 B: the spice they have the noodles with it it's not as 

540.31 540.68 A: mhm 

543.48 544.02 B: potent 

544.30 550.31 A: yeah i mean i guess it's like having corn bread or just normal bread or biscuits or something 

548.71 549.14 B: yeah 

550.92 551.82 B: and i also 

552.39 554.38 B: i really like a lot of mexican food
