59.63 59.95 A: right 

60.85 65.14 B: um well i wonder why we- i guess we could talk about why we think they are popular maybe 

66.30 69.62 A: yeah i think i think i know why they're on t._v. so much 

69.77 70.81 B: go ahead fire away 

70.34 71.16 A: because they're not uh 

71.30 72.89 A: they're not only popular but they're cheap 

73.09 77.43 B: oh yeah of course right you don't have to pay script writers and a- actors and all that 

75.03 77.24 A: you don't have to pay tim allen 

77.80 78.12 A: right 

93.83 96.97 A: right you know actually i have seen 

97.73 100.17 A: i i canceled my cable about a year ago and i haven't 

100.35 102.08 A: basically haven't watched t._v. in a year but 

102.38 105.30 A: uh i did see some cable shows that were like 

105.95 108.15 A: life in the e._r. and uh 

109.35 111.53 A: um a couple of them about 

109.89 111.53 B: which are actual documentaries right 

112.17 116.82 A: sort of they're not really documentaries they are more like they're still kind of reality t._v. concepts they 

116.95 119.65 A: take the camera and they go and watch what happens in the 

120.14 122.07 A: in the hospital or there's another one that 

122.42 123.68 A: there are a couple of them about 

124.27 125.40 A: medical forensics 

126.44 129.30 A: and they and they follow the uh 

128.47 131.38 B: like on the discovery channel and that kind of thing right 

130.49 130.86 A: right 

131.88 133.89 A: yeah i have seen those and i and 

134.07 140.48 A: i found them interesting for a while and then eventually i kind of decided you know they're really just putting this on t._v. because it's cheap to produce 

153.09 153.39 A: yeah 

158.92 159.17 A: yeah 

159.46 162.04 A: oh that's true i i still think there's 

162.65 165.15 A: (( probably like )) there is that level where you see 

166.39 167.00 A: uh 

167.49 168.76 A: (( right )) you'd have to divide 

169.10 171.11 A: divide the two things apart the ones that are 

171.70 173.26 A: people surviving on an island 

173.35 176.18 A: from the ones that are just like going in and observing 

176.33 177.32 B: yeah those 

176.76 182.58 A: though like there are these created situations that are created for entertainment value and then there are these other situations that are 

183.21 184.65 A: trying to be the fly on the wall 

184.81 196.72 B: yeah that's why i was saying those those are a little bit more like a documentary in some ways whereas the ones like survivor or whatever i have a feeling a lot of it is um well of course there's no feeling a lot of it is manufactured i mean it may not be strictly scripted but 

201.76 202.08 A: mhm 

207.07 207.46 A: right 

208.44 208.97 A: um 

209.42 216.47 B: because they're thinking about what kind of dramatic situations are going to entice people to watch it they don't want to just get kind of random stuff that might not be that interesting 

209.96 210.49 A: there's 

216.83 223.09 A: right and and you know what i think happens with t._v. a lot and this this would be true even of the documentary style is that 

223.72 224.38 A: um 

225.32 227.92 A: people you see a half hour or an hour of 

228.11 228.47 A: of 

228.59 229.38 A: distilled 

230.53 232.01 A: so called reality you know and just 

232.22 233.30 A: distilled footage 

234.02 236.46 A: and they cut out the parts that would be boring 

236.84 238.03 A: yeah and they cut out 

236.97 237.47 B: right 

238.17 239.12 A: the an- 

239.75 241.92 A: they may even have kind of a narrative 

242.69 244.38 A: structure in mind that they want to give you 

244.55 244.93 B: right 

244.88 245.58 A: and so 

245.72 246.20 A: people 

246.46 246.81 A: tend 

246.92 247.48 A: to 

247.89 248.53 A: um 

249.58 253.84 A: generalize from the parts that they see that are being presented as the most interesting parts 

254.34 255.79 B: they're not representative though really 

254.50 255.77 A: to to assu- 

255.96 257.38 A: right to assume that 

256.63 257.79 B: and they're not the complete picture 

258.09 258.47 A: right 

258.57 259.36 A: they just fill 

259.54 262.96 A: they'll almost tend to fill in the rest of the entire day at the hospital 

263.08 263.40 B: mhm 

263.38 266.08 A: as being exactly like this half hour that we saw 

265.26 265.95 B: right 

266.85 268.43 A: so there's kind of a um 

268.95 271.48 A: there's still kind of a false picture that can be created 

285.86 288.09 B: and they'll say this is reality and they don't realize that 

318.13 318.45 A: mhm 

331.58 331.92 A: right 

332.82 339.93 B: i don't know um you know it's uh i ge- i i suppose some viewers who a kind of sophisticated will will kind of watch it with that awareness but many of them may not 

340.85 341.19 A: mhm 

342.28 346.24 A: that's true i did there was a an article in harper's magazine 

346.88 347.73 A: years ago 

347.87 349.32 A: the- at least five years ago 

349.18 349.45 B: mhm 

349.73 351.19 A: from somebody who had been 

351.72 354.51 A: uh part of the editing process of one of the cop shows 

354.44 355.19 B: mhm right 

355.04 355.46 A: one of the 

355.67 357.85 A: the you know true life cop shows 

357.31 357.71 B: right 

358.35 359.54 A: and uh 

360.25 361.93 A: it was really interesting actually 

362.09 362.62 A: the 

363.05 365.71 A: one of the things that she talked about was all the things that they cut out 

366.57 368.89 A: um because for example they 

369.40 370.48 A: they would have footage of 

370.70 373.09 A: police violating people's rights and uh 

373.62 373.99 A: you know 

374.35 376.35 A: and whatever of not reading them their rights not 

376.87 378.83 A: not giving them an attorney when they ask for one 

379.31 381.60 A: and they would just cut that out and present the 

381.82 384.37 A: the police bursting in and arresting somebody and that would be it 

385.10 386.38 A: and they also 

386.61 389.10 A: the this person also mentioned how 

389.90 391.52 A: just having the camera on 

392.25 392.93 A: on them 

393.04 394.77 A: made the you know you have the 

395.02 396.18 A: stereotypical image of the uh 

396.29 396.67 A: the 

397.54 398.83 A: the the guy 

399.04 402.24 A: at home with his shirt off and he's arrested and he and 

402.66 405.65 A: they catch him weighing the drugs or whatever whatever they're 

406.27 407.16 A: catching him doing 

408.01 409.72 A: and uh they said these 

409.87 411.48 A: these people would be 

411.70 415.00 A: much less concerned about getting arrested than about the fact that 

415.49 415.74 A: like 

415.93 420.58 A: the uh the host of the show and the people with the cameras who were on their house they would be turned on by that 

425.51 426.05 A: exactly 

435.01 435.31 A: right 

435.58 443.66 B: it's b- it's a little bizarre but there you have it must be like people thinking if i if i'm on t._v. in some sense i'm somehow i'm part of the celebrity culture or whatever 

444.07 444.38 A: right 

444.77 448.78 A: yeah this in a way is is like the most real experience that's happened to them because 

449.10 450.81 A: they would get actually excited about 

451.14 452.36 A: i'm going to be on t._v. not 

452.47 452.93 A: not like 

453.43 455.32 A: i'm being disgraced in front of the nation 

455.38 460.10 B: right i i beat my wife up or whatever when i was drunk wha- whatever right 

455.77 457.49 A: but uh oh i'm going to be on t._v. 

458.45 458.81 A: yes 

458.95 459.30 A: right 

460.88 465.66 A: i- it's just i'm going to be on t._v. this celebrity guy that i've seen on t._v. is going is in my house wow 

465.96 475.46 B: that's also the thing about why though it cuts out some of the police stuff i'm sure is that they need to get cooperation fro- and you know rel- signed released from the police individuals and police organizations involved and maybe you have 

474.68 475.86 A: right it depends on 

476.10 476.36 A: yeah 

476.67 478.28 B: then you'd have ongoing cooperation from them 

478.91 479.83 B: or they don't have a show 

479.12 479.72 A: right 

480.31 480.64 A: right 

481.27 484.83 A: yeah they're completely dependent on the on the cooperation of the 

486.08 488.04 A: the the police that they're going to film 

488.05 493.00 B: so again it's it's reality but it's like very selected and edited reality and y- people you know 

493.01 500.58 B: so you really want to like appreciate what it really is and not like idealize what it is they really have to be aware of that and maybe a lot of people are not who knows 

500.59 501.41 A: yeah that's true 

500.64 501.57 B: probably probably not 

502.30 504.11 A: um at one time i was a reporter 

504.30 506.61 A: in new jersey at a newspaper in new jersey 

506.72 507.02 B: mhm 

507.04 508.10 A: and uh 

508.10 508.67 B: which one 

508.86 513.40 A: the it was the it doesn't exist anymore but it was the news tribute in woodbridge 

511.09 511.49 B: oh okay 

512.82 520.12 B: yeah -cause i live in staten island new york which is right across from should have been should have been new jersey but somebody lost a boat race in sixteen sixty anyway uh-huh 

514.78 515.27 A: oh okay 

515.59 516.51 A: yeah right across the 

519.67 520.02 A: yeah 

520.63 521.78 A: ah so 

522.06 522.67 A: um 

522.95 526.22 A: one thing that happened there was that they decided at one point that 

526.84 528.73 A: uh people are interested in prime news 

528.84 529.19 B: mhm 

529.00 529.99 A: so they 

530.15 532.79 A: they put a they created a column on the 

533.74 537.72 A: they front page of the second section everyday that would be all police news 

536.94 538.62 B: police blotter stuff right 

538.46 538.80 A: right 

539.06 544.17 A: and uh i mean they did it just because it would attract people and it's easy it draws people in 

544.83 548.51 A: but also at the same time it made the police our most important source 

548.84 549.37 B: right 

549.16 554.52 A: because if we didn't have the cooperation with the police we would have nothing to put in this thing that had to be in the paper everyday 

554.13 554.67 B: right 

554.77 555.38 B: exactly 

555.63 556.15 A: so 

556.47 559.33 A: um we wound up really having a uh 

559.54 563.52 A: an unquestioning attitude toward a lot of the things that were going on with the police at that time 

563.52 567.37 B: or you could question them but you don't want to let them know you're doing it or you're in trouble 

567.58 570.90 A: well the the paper ah just as a general
