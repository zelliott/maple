58.56 62.12 B: i was going to say i'm surprised you have any time to watch t._v. 

61.77 64.88 A: uh yeah well you got to do something 

65.27 65.91 B: where are you 

66.01 67.23 A: uh ohio state 

67.30 68.78 B: oh okay studying what 

67.93 68.32 A: (( )) 

69.12 70.37 A: uh linguistics actually 

70.42 71.18 B: oh okay 

70.78 71.05 A: uh 

71.19 72.57 A: uh do you know what that is or should 

72.57 77.75 B: yes i'm a psychology major so i just took cognitive psychology and things like that 

73.30 74.25 A: that's how you got in to this 

74.99 75.36 A: ah 

77.88 78.44 A: right 

78.54 79.15 A: oh okay 

79.85 81.26 B: but how do you feel about 

79.88 80.25 A: right 

81.56 86.55 B: reality shows do you think that they're a good idea or are they too invasive or 

86.52 88.12 A: no i think you know i don't 

88.39 90.24 A: i don't have a problem with the invasiveness of it 

90.45 90.85 A: um 

91.41 92.54 A: i mean i think they're interesting 

92.94 93.31 A: uh 

94.34 95.51 A: i mean i've i've never liked 

95.89 98.18 A: the question of like why do you think they're popular but 

98.81 102.78 A: like i can't really i've like i always have this notion that people want to see reality on t._v. but 

103.40 104.65 A: i don't really know why 

104.98 105.34 A: you know 

106.16 106.56 A: um 

107.56 111.87 A: and i guess people like being you know voyeuristic or something with other people's lives but 

113.03 114.05 A: i don't know what to say 

117.09 117.87 A: so (( )) 

117.98 119.28 A: you've really never watched any 

119.50 123.20 B: um well i've actually i've watched i've watched blind date 

119.67 120.40 A: (( )) 

123.06 123.92 A: blind date 

123.62 124.83 B: have you seen that 

124.17 126.08 A: yeah yeah i think i've caught that a couple times 

126.05 128.82 B: cause i find that one entertaining 

129.35 129.82 B: but 

130.03 140.83 B: i don't know i actually i don't have any problem with them at all i just know that a lot of people criticize them saying that what's wrong with the world these days for people to be entertained by other people's lives and 

133.18 133.67 A: right 

140.16 140.56 A: right 

140.96 148.66 B: all of that but i think i think it's useful actually i always like to care about other people's lives cause i can apply it to my life 

148.04 150.07 A: right yeah well i think that's that's part of it 

150.32 152.99 B: and and i think that's probably why they're so popular 

152.63 153.02 A: right 

153.30 153.71 B: so 

154.73 156.87 A: yeah well i think part of it is like the 

157.51 158.84 A: you know the fictional characters that 

158.99 160.81 A: people make up for sitcoms or whatever just 

161.24 161.73 B: yeah they 

161.51 163.21 A: they don't seem real enough or whatever 

162.70 164.39 B: yeah exactly 

163.33 163.61 A: but 

164.27 167.28 A: but i mean the sometimes you see a reality show where somebody is just really strange 

170.51 171.70 B: or you're just watching someone 

175.16 175.56 A: right 

176.95 178.06 A: right 

177.67 178.09 B: but 

178.77 180.25 B: i mean i guess they're good when they just 

180.54 183.93 B: show clips of the exciting parts of people's lives 

183.19 183.98 A: right 

184.54 186.21 A: yeah well uh in a sense that's i don't know 

186.73 189.05 A: like when you get personalities that are you just can't relate to 

189.20 189.57 A: (( )) 

189.36 189.88 B: yeah 

189.71 191.36 A: yeah it was kind of a waste of time or 

191.87 193.98 A: you're like it's hard to take that person seriously or like 

195.26 200.55 A: they're on a t._v. show so there that's real for them but like what if they're in you know our real world or whatever it just wouldn't 

200.92 202.14 A: make sense but 

201.16 201.92 B: right 

202.82 203.33 A: yeah 

203.54 204.46 A: so hm 

205.82 210.57 A: yeah so there's lik- that like whole sub-genre of you know dating t._v. shows which i guess is reality 

211.54 212.84 A: cause there's like blind date and 

213.86 217.56 B: and though i don't know actually i think a lot of the reality shows are unrealistic 

214.22 214.56 A: whatever 

217.13 218.51 A: right yeah 

217.73 219.61 B: as much as sitcoms are 

219.22 219.66 A: yeah 

219.95 221.01 B: they kind of 

221.54 224.92 B: aggrandize people's problems and 

224.64 225.70 A: right exactly 

225.88 228.38 A: so that's kind of annoying like i used to watch survivor but it 

228.72 230.27 A: that part of it got to me like 

230.97 233.86 A: where they they they kept putting them in unrealistic things or 

233.67 238.44 B: right uh a lot of the new ideas they have i also just think are so stupid 

234.16 234.58 A: so 

238.11 238.47 A: right 

238.65 249.39 B: like there was one i think called hawaiian bride or something where they just like brought like some men to hawaii to meet women and like i don't know i just think they're kind of 

241.96 243.83 A: right 

246.94 248.08 A: right yeah 

249.08 251.00 A: yeah those get kind of tacky 

251.78 253.54 A: yeah like that did you ever watch that 

253.67 254.72 A: the bachelor show 

254.83 255.93 B: i've never seen it 

255.72 258.59 A: like i haven't either but somehow that's become really popular 

258.54 259.10 B: yeah 

258.85 259.13 A: so 

259.43 260.57 A: i can't really figure it out 

259.87 262.66 B: i think hawaiian bride was a take on that 

261.95 263.13 A: right 

262.84 269.72 B: but i mean a lot of them i'm sure fail right away so i guess the ones that succeed are probably good for one reason or another 

269.08 269.59 A: right 

269.96 274.34 B: or even all the american idol i guess that's sort of a reality show 

269.97 270.59 A: i can't really (( )) 

274.47 275.04 A: yeah 

275.20 276.12 A: i never saw that 

276.01 277.81 B: i didn't either 

276.99 277.61 A: okay 

277.94 279.71 A: i couldn't figure out what the the like 

280.39 283.29 A: structure of it was like it was like a game show or something but 

283.61 288.35 B: i guess so i i just i read about t._v. shows i don't watch them 

286.67 287.25 A: okay 

287.77 289.36 A: well i guess that's good 

288.45 289.35 B: but 

290.83 292.71 A: so where i'm sorry where do you go to school or 

292.73 294.30 B: at university of pennsylvania 

294.03 295.53 A: okay 

295.67 297.41 A: that would probably be how you figured out about this 

297.61 298.00 B: right 

298.06 300.06 A: yeah i got you huh that's cool 

300.94 301.36 A: um 

301.99 302.36 A: well 

302.50 304.51 A: i guess that's a credit to the university of pennsylvania 

304.74 305.99 A: you read more than watch t._v. 

306.05 313.47 B: i don't i don't read anything a- academic at all so i don't know if that's so great for them 

312.17 312.54 A: well 

313.20 313.83 A: it's all good 

314.11 316.82 A: huh so what do you like other kind of t._v. shows at all or 

317.04 317.96 A: (( )) just don't care 

317.56 325.17 B: um if i actually have like a two hour time block i'm much more likely to watch a movie i don't actually follow any particular show 

321.76 322.81 A: oh okay 

324.55 325.69 A: okay i got you 

325.88 326.30 A: huh 

326.46 332.73 B: i watch friends actually but uh that's a very unrealistic show 

327.97 328.97 A: ah okay 

331.16 334.08 A: right yeah that's what gets me about friends 

334.74 336.63 A: so i've seen that at some times and it's just 

337.05 337.42 A: i don't know 

338.20 340.71 A: i think i figured out the what the things with friends is is that they 

341.77 343.26 A: all the humor is based on people like 

343.77 345.55 A: trying to tell a lie to like avoid 

345.98 347.48 A: like some situation and that like 

347.76 348.62 A: backs up on them 

349.04 351.49 A: and i'd once i figured that out it was like this is just so annoying 

351.61 352.75 A: cause they do it again and again 

353.03 353.28 A: but 

353.57 354.12 B: yeah 

354.00 355.04 A: so i mean that's not realistic 

355.16 355.54 A: but 

356.70 358.05 A: i don't know what to say 

359.16 360.05 B: have you watched any 

360.17 361.48 B: the other reality shows or no 

361.60 362.12 A: um 

362.33 363.77 A: you ever seen the amazing race 

364.04 364.50 B: no 

364.35 366.64 A: like once i got sick of survivor i got in to the amazing race 

366.97 367.85 A: and that was pretty cool 

368.73 369.12 A: um 

369.57 370.62 A: so it's like where they just 

370.88 372.28 A: they have to travel around the world 

372.67 373.09 B: right 

372.97 376.58 A: like the whoever gets the it's like a ten stage race and there like whoever gets 

377.31 381.21 A: to the goal the day's goal last like gets kicked out of the race or loses 

381.78 382.16 A: um 

382.48 385.41 A: and then eventually they just keep on knocking people out until they get to the end 

385.53 385.91 B: right 

385.90 388.86 A: that's pretty so they have they're like traveling in pairs and they have to go through 

389.07 389.68 A: you know 

389.87 392.62 A: on air and by car and by taxi in like foreign countries 

392.97 394.29 A: so i like to travel so that's 

394.84 397.25 A: that's a cool thing cause you get to see all these really cool places but 

397.18 398.34 B: oh that's true yeah 

397.93 398.93 A: you'd probably never get to 

399.13 401.89 A: um so it actually i can actually recommend that although it's 

401.28 402.51 B: you say you like to travel 

402.53 403.29 A: yeah why 

402.96 404.87 B: but you never get to 

404.08 412.28 A: well (( )) i have but not as much as i'd like to right i yeah i don't get to go to like venezuela or nepal or stuff like that right um 

405.66 406.16 B: oh okay 

411.59 415.28 B: well i've been to venezuela but not nepal 

413.50 414.85 A: well there you go 

415.53 416.83 A: so it's cool to see like 

417.08 418.12 A: at least see those places 

417.73 418.23 B: yeah 

418.41 418.74 A: um 

419.39 420.28 A: with like people 

420.71 422.08 A: you know you get to know over time 

422.42 422.69 A: but 

422.52 422.90 B: right 

422.91 425.09 A: i think that's part of the appeal to the whole reality thing is that like 

425.73 427.63 A: you get to know people like in a deeper 

428.38 430.83 A: level than t._v. like normally allows 

429.31 431.92 B: i guess so 

431.06 431.54 A: yeah 

432.13 433.59 A: i mean i think that's my brother 

433.88 436.36 A: watched survivor once too and i think that was part of 

436.75 437.63 A: what he liked about it 

437.75 438.12 B: right 

437.86 438.11 A: um 

438.93 441.23 A: cause he likes you know getting in to people that way 

441.99 443.99 B: are you from ohio or are you from 

443.71 445.47 A: oh no i'm from minnesota 

445.62 447.37 B: oh okay i was going to say 

447.53 447.86 B: are 

448.53 450.52 B: reality t._v. shows more popular in 

450.70 453.74 B: either ohio or minnesota or (( )) 

453.35 455.93 A: that i don't know my sister still lives in minnesota and she watches like 

456.05 457.91 A: survivor and amazing race um 

456.84 457.29 B: yeah 

458.84 460.93 A: i honestly have no idea 

460.71 464.75 B: because i really feel like they were popular back home but here i don't really know anyone who watches 

464.33 465.59 A: so where's your home 

465.34 466.05 B: new jersey 

465.94 466.92 A: new jersey 

466.93 467.99 B: so 

467.56 469.74 A: big big gap between new jersey and pennsylvania 

469.53 475.66 B: well i'm from north jersey so it's a different world than south jersey and pennsylvania 

471.84 472.48 A: oh okay 

474.01 474.62 A: i got you 

475.17 475.55 A: right 

475.75 476.12 A: huh 

476.12 476.56 B: so 

476.77 477.53 A: that's interesting 

477.83 478.66 A: wonder why that would be 

479.02 484.18 B: i don't i mean i don't know if it's an actual statistic (( )) different people 

480.81 481.97 A: right right yeah 

483.83 484.97 A: right 

484.56 484.98 B: but 

485.72 486.04 A: huh 

486.15 488.71 B: well and also the fact that we're busier here 

488.58 488.92 A: right 

489.22 490.10 A: that that's true 

490.56 491.21 A: that happens 

491.77 492.18 A: yeah 

492.61 494.29 A: actually i had a lot less time in college too 

494.81 496.65 A: like watch t._v. than i have in grad school 

498.05 498.58 B: oh wow 

498.68 500.75 A: yeah i'd that might be different than what you think but 

501.26 505.82 A: like you're it's easy for your like social life to like disappear in grad school than it is in college 

506.20 506.50 A: um 

507.57 507.91 B: right 

507.92 511.68 A: yeah so and cause you just like work and then like not work time instead of like 

513.02 513.46 A: you know 

513.34 514.76 B: oh right so then 

514.45 515.43 A: right i don't know 

515.25 515.96 B: yeah that makes sense 

515.53 519.21 A: like in colleges like you're trying to have as much fun as possible and then like still get the work done 

519.43 519.81 B: yeah 

519.84 523.89 A: i don't know if that's the way you are but that's the way i was so like yeah i wasn't 

523.21 524.50 B: where did you where'd you go to school 

524.58 526.38 A: i went to a school called pomona college 

526.53 527.44 A: it's in california 

527.60 528.29 B: yeah i've heard of it 

528.14 528.85 A: it's kind of small 

529.08 529.43 A: so 

530.22 530.59 A: yeah 

531.84 532.17 A: right 

533.93 536.67 B: well you seem more well traveled than me huh 

535.99 536.98 A: well 

537.65 539.85 A: i'm slightly older i guess or i presume but 

541.35 543.14 A: you've been to venezuela so that's pretty good 

543.41 544.00 B: that's true 

544.15 544.50 A: right 

544.82 545.24 A: huh 

545.70 546.09 A: so 

546.40 547.55 A: there aren't like people at 

547.95 549.52 A: pennsylvania like get together for 

550.31 551.68 A: survivor watching 

551.36 552.06 B: no 

551.81 552.82 A: (( )) 

552.98 556.69 B: i think they should do a reality show on this phone call study 

556.37 557.88 A: on oh 

558.11 560.19 B: listen to everybody's random conversations 

560.17 560.95 A: that would be interesting 

561.99 562.82 A: so um 

564.25 567.20 A: yeah there's there's also like those reality shows on m._t._v. 

567.57 569.15 B: yeah i was actually going to say i think that 

569.38 570.60 B: the beginning of the trend 

570.43 571.48 A: right yeah
