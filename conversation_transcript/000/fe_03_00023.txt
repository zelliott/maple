0.51 1.67 B: erin 

1.47 2.69 A: meghan 

7.24 9.60 B: okay what are we supposed to do now [mn] 

9.49 12.49 A: um i guess we're just supposed to talk about 

13.08 14.01 A: illness 

14.41 16.50 B: okay um 

16.96 18.67 B: they were talking about 

18.84 21.96 B: if we get sick when the seasons change 

22.27 26.78 B: and i don't know about you but i tend to get sick a lot after the seasons change 

27.12 30.63 B: due to allergies and such so i don't know what about you 

31.21 33.99 A: um [cough] where are you from 

34.17 40.05 B: i am from in illinois originally but i go to school here at the university of illinois in champaign 

40.24 44.94 A: okay um i'm from arizona where the seasons don't really change that much 

44.45 45.30 B: uh-huh 

45.15 49.77 A: so i don't really tend to get sick when the seasons do change 

49.67 50.62 B: okay 

51.46 52.91 B: yeah i um 

53.30 58.73 B: actually this semester it it's been it's really cold here right now it's about thirty degrees here [mn] 

58.60 59.48 A: wow 

59.11 71.96 B: and um i tend to kind of like if it's been warmer and it gets colder then i usually get a lot of allergies just sinus infections fairly often i probably get i would say five per year 

72.28 77.20 B: and normally when i get 'em treated they do go away a lot faster 

77.21 89.05 B: but the last one i had i was pretty bad because i uh got sick during one of my big exam weeks and i did go to the doctor and i started to take medication but once i got better i stopped 

89.53 90.12 A: hm 

89.57 92.15 B: so then over actually this past 

92.26 97.68 B: week or two at thanksgiving break i ended up getting sick again and i think that was why because i just 

97.70 100.46 B: didn't take all the medication so 

101.47 105.05 B: but yeah i don't really know [mn] what else to say 

105.20 107.56 A: yeah i have allergies um 

109.15 113.66 A: but they don't really come when the seasons come it's just it feels random 

113.65 114.58 B: mhm 

113.96 115.01 A: i don't know if 

115.29 118.12 A: it's from like a weather change or 

119.34 122.59 A: like with the wind or something blowing things up in the air 

122.80 123.77 B: right 

123.17 124.08 A: um 

125.14 133.10 A: but i do have allergies and i don't really get it treated because it's not that bad i just kind of ignore it and it usually goes away 

132.91 137.41 B: mhm is um the humidity's not really bad out there though is it 

137.46 141.15 A: no sometimes in the summer it is but not very often 

138.04 138.99 B: yeah 

140.76 142.88 B: [mn] does that make a difference to you 

142.96 144.26 A: i think it does i 

144.48 146.42 A: think the humidity does make a difference 

146.50 157.39 B: yeah 'cause that's what happens during our summers like like i said i was originally i'm originally from southern illinois and when i'm home over the summer the humidity gets really bad 

157.57 158.44 A: mhm 

157.62 160.47 B: and i tend to get sick then a lot too 

161.31 169.64 B: but not as much as like the switch from hot to cold there's more of a i get more sinus infections then than i do when it actually gets warmer 

170.10 171.10 A: mhm 

170.44 171.66 B: (( so [mn] )) 

171.68 176.00 A: i find that like a lot of people that i know that have allergies that that's the case also 

175.80 176.96 B: mhm 

176.86 179.51 A: the switch from hot to cold is the big one 

178.63 179.23 B: y- 

179.24 180.36 B: yeah 

180.37 186.43 B: that's kinda how my room mates are here too like especially one of 'em he has pretty bad allergies and he's always like 

186.63 194.54 B: i don't know coughing a lot and stuff and he tends to kinda do the same thing that i do a lot of people i know are like that my parents are the same way 

194.61 204.01 B: um my mom gets a lot of migraines and my dad has really bad allergies i don't really have allergies per se but i just get a lot of sinus infections so 

203.69 206.25 A: mhm 

205.64 207.33 B: yeah i don't know [mn] 

207.47 209.14 A: i find that um 

209.69 213.30 A: at a university like people living in the residents halls and things 

213.32 214.18 A: that 

214.72 217.99 A: overall sickness of like a big population 

218.46 220.78 A: it gets worse from hot to cold 

221.12 234.22 A: like when people when it starts to get a little bit cooler here people start to get sick and there's like a trend of sickness for a while for about two weeks where everybody is sick and coughing who lives around 

226.76 227.65 B: right 

234.20 236.41 A: um a lot of other people 

237.09 238.63 A: and when it gets hot 

238.51 250.96 B: right it seems to be that way here too like like you said a lot more in the residence halls because a lot of people um just being so close in the like a lot of the dorms here have community bathrooms 

250.77 251.97 A: mhm 

251.34 257.09 B: so they're even around you know other people even more than some other dorms that have private bathrooms 

257.37 259.90 B: and they're really um 

259.99 263.65 B: they influence you to go get flu shots here and stuff like that they're real 

263.95 265.58 B: pushy towards that 

265.65 270.56 B: but i've also known people that have gotten flu shots and then they end up getting sick right after that 

270.34 272.05 A: mhm 

271.34 273.10 B: so my dad was actually 

273.17 277.15 B: actually that happened to him th- recently he ended up going to get one and then got sick 

277.32 279.39 B: probably two days afterwards 

279.45 280.18 A: wow 

279.71 282.41 B: so i think it just depends on the person [mn] 

282.19 286.99 A: [mn] yeah i've never gotten a flu shot and i've never gotten the flu around flu season 

288.12 290.18 A: maybe i just have a good immune system 

288.31 289.00 B: (( i )) 

289.85 299.63 B: yeah you prob- [mn] sounds like it i got one my freshman year but i haven't since and i don't really get the flu i it's just sinus stuff 

290.78 292.24 A: [laughter] 

299.55 300.56 A: mhm 

299.92 304.36 B: so but you know that can be for me just as bad because like i end up 

304.42 308.18 B: not feeling like doing anything and have headaches and such so 

308.94 317.99 B: but i think it's just all a lot of the weather so it gets really really cold here it's real windy and i don't know if you've ever been out this way 

317.82 320.15 A: no i haven't i've never been to chicago 

320.74 322.18 A: (( or illinois for that matter )) 

322.14 326.03 B: yeah it's champaign's about two hours south of chicago so 

326.12 336.17 B: and then my home town is about three hours south of here which the humidity level down at home is always like a lot higher than it is even here it's kinda weird how that works out but 

335.64 337.54 A: mhm 

338.48 341.23 B: yeah so do you go to university of arizona then 

340.90 341.68 A: yes 

341.80 342.89 B: that's cool 

342.97 351.59 B: it's kinda actually i'm in the process of applying in grad schools and that was one of the areas i was looking at and it'd be a big change you know in terms of weather and everything so yeah 

350.86 353.37 A: yeah it really would [laughter] 

355.55 357.52 A: is that all we're supposed to talk about 

357.09 360.92 B: but i think so i don't know what else we can talk about in terms of sickness [mn] 

361.27 362.23 B: um 

362.29 366.78 B: i think we're pretty much in agreement on it and i don't know what else we're supposed to do 

366.72 368.00 A: okay [laughter] 

367.63 370.94 B: so what shall we do just stay here or [mn] 

369.36 370.40 A: um 

370.77 372.60 A: i guess we just hang up 

373.23 374.12 B: okay 

374.71 375.78 B: (( all right )) 

375.94 377.47 A: (( it was nice talking to you ))
