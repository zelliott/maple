4.62 6.38 B: so we're supposed to talk about illness now 

5.95 7.92 A: yeah fi- fire away if you want to start 

8.06 9.61 B: okay uh so 

9.76 16.57 B: the the question that they asked there was whether we get ill when the seasons change i guess that probably means when it changes from 

17.06 19.95 B: like summer to autumn or autumn to winter right 

20.06 23.97 A: yeah it could mean any of the seasons but since it's this time of year they may be thinking of fall to winter i don't know 

23.95 28.30 B: yeah really that would that seems to be when most people get colds and flus and things like that 

27.03 28.66 A: right is when it gets colder right 

28.68 30.20 B: so do you have that problem of 

43.29 44.58 B: oh okay 

59.16 60.05 B: mhm right 

61.97 63.92 B: uh it depends um 

64.54 69.42 B: i i have some allergies and so sometimes when seasons change some seasonal you know 

69.89 74.13 B: things change i don't actually know what my allergies are i just assumed that i i have these reactions 

72.25 72.51 A: mhm 

73.62 75.08 A: everybody has some i'm sure 

74.97 79.04 B: yeah so like certain probably tree pollens come out at one time a year while 

77.74 78.11 A: right 

79.31 81.65 B: you know grass pollens appear at a different time of year 

81.19 82.27 A: absolutely 

81.91 84.51 B: but uh i don't know i did have a cold 

85.25 87.51 B: (( )) yeah i had a cold that lasted longer than it really should have 

87.37 87.67 A: mhm 

87.70 88.50 B: um 

87.96 90.30 A: when was this a a few weeks ago or 

90.39 90.83 B: um 

90.46 91.08 A: just recently 

91.20 94.99 B: it was at the beginning of the fall really so it wasn't that recent 

94.79 100.49 A: oh yeah actually when it changes from summer to fall that's sometimes when people seem to get sick also not just from fall winter right 

99.11 99.65 B: yeah 

100.60 104.11 B: but i don't really have a problem with flus a lot of people have that problem i don't 

103.97 104.53 A: mhm 

104.48 105.67 B: do you have that problem 

105.28 107.45 A: well i i you know i think 

107.58 108.42 A: i'm not sure 

117.66 118.31 B: yeah 

123.21 125.23 B: flu in your lungs you're saying not just your uh 

124.35 130.53 A: yeah right just kind of the up you know your chest and your throat and your uh nasal cavities or whatever the heck it is and all that stuff 

130.58 137.09 B: i get it all in my head and my throat but very very seldom ever any chest problems or any anything that makes me you know nauseous that's not very 

132.10 132.60 A: right 

133.91 134.56 A: right 

136.24 136.54 A: mm 

137.56 138.40 B: common for me 

138.73 139.12 B: so 

149.76 150.49 B: yeah right 

154.97 155.32 B: right 

165.59 169.20 B: (( )) colds don't respond to antibiotics 

169.00 169.37 A: right 

169.30 172.08 B: they're they're bacterial uh they're they're viral so they wouldn't 

171.49 173.02 A: right right right right right 

173.15 173.67 B: so 

173.21 179.92 A: i had to get so- they got something and it actually worked i thought i was going to have it forever it must have been five weeks at least sheesh anyway 

180.19 182.12 B: so sometimes i know colds end up uh 

182.87 191.60 B: leading to like sinus infections for instance or a bacterial infection that results from your sinuses being clogged but i have noticed that i teach undergrads too sometimes 

185.08 185.45 A: mhm 

186.07 186.36 A: mhm 

191.07 191.70 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

191.89 192.53 B: and just the 

192.74 194.90 B: being in contact with so many people 

195.01 195.38 B: um 

195.72 196.01 B: it 

196.14 197.51 A: absolutely 

196.52 196.99 B: the 

197.26 199.35 B: very much increases your chance of getting 

198.69 204.20 A: they're all hanging around in dorms they're hanging out in restaurants and bars with each other and anything that's going around you get exposed to it 

201.79 202.29 B: exactly 

203.70 204.69 B: exactly right 

204.33 210.30 A: and you you can live like the cleanest like most sheltered life in the world like a monk or something and you still end up with the colds every year 

209.46 209.77 B: right 

209.96 210.73 B: exactly 

210.57 211.08 A: right 

210.85 211.88 B: that's definitely the case 

211.79 212.34 A: right 

213.61 214.32 B: so 

214.40 224.27 A: let's see let me think of something else oh i i was uh i was kind of making fun of it in class actually the other day the one i have right now because i realized my voice you know was kind of if i tried to talk 

231.66 241.63 A: and so if you try to talk a little bit higher you get a little more excited your voice goes a little higher into a higher register your voice starts to crack and so i was kind of doing it on purpose at the beginning of class just to you know 

241.75 247.18 A: be goofy and uh so that was like uh i actually used it for something so that was that was useful anyway 

246.64 246.98 B: mhm 

251.90 255.58 A: (( )) the last cold you had was in um like september in other words 

255.63 259.88 B: yeah i get i actually can't remember the real the time span exactly um 

259.57 260.58 A: somewhere back in there 

260.69 263.46 B: yeah i know my girlfriend had it for like one day and it 

261.18 261.49 A: mhm 

263.57 273.85 B: disappeared but when i had it it just hung around for at least two or three weeks it may have been conflated with allergies in the end i may have been over it and not realizing that it was now a new cause 

274.42 274.80 B: yeah 

280.22 280.60 B: yeah 

282.76 283.07 A: your 

283.33 285.72 A: immune system never really gets to take over again the way it should 

285.82 286.11 B: right 

286.29 288.82 B: i assume you live in a place where you like a a 

288.29 289.86 A: i'm in uh staten island new york 

289.75 293.61 B: okay i'm in ohio right now so we probably have similar seasonal 

291.04 291.38 A: right 

292.71 296.09 A: yeah it's not that different really we usually get your weather like one day later 

294.36 294.65 B: yeah 

296.32 297.76 B: yeah so it go it blows that way 

297.60 298.15 A: right 

297.93 301.30 B: i'm yeah if you lived in arizona the situation would be entirely different because 

301.11 306.72 A: no i know a little bit about the yeah mid western climate i grew up in michigan and my parents still live there and stuff uh-huh 

305.30 305.77 B: oh really 

306.48 308.81 B: i was going to say you don't sound like you're from staten island 

310.68 311.10 B: uh-huh 

317.02 321.78 A: uh the people i hung around with in graduate school had kind of boarding school accents if you know what i mean uh 

321.31 323.78 B: so new england accents and new york accents 

330.41 335.72 A: got kind of how should i say uh recalcitrant and deliberately kept my uh mid western accent so here i still have it 

334.23 334.99 B: uh-huh yeah 

335.92 336.21 B: oh 

336.36 336.79 A: right 

337.40 340.78 B: yeah i probably i guess i feel the same way i'm from new england and living in ohio 

340.62 341.13 A: right 

342.14 345.25 A: no you don't don't seem to have a new england accent it does sound pretty kind of mid westerly 

345.55 347.18 B: uh or unidentifiable in any 

347.03 354.96 A: yeah if you if you sou- i think if you listen closely enough if you and if you're trained enough you can always tell little regional differences but they're not anything you know really noticeable 

347.42 347.68 B: yeah 

352.98 353.38 B: yeah 

357.17 366.37 A: where i think if uh if anything i uh deliberately kind of exaggerated my mid western accent a little bit after i moved to new york right yeah being the stubborn type i suppose but anyway 

361.85 362.76 B: really 

366.52 368.93 B: should we get back on topic or i don't know if it matters 

367.58 374.59 A: yeah i know i was about to say that um what else about illness at the change is it just illness at the change of the seasons there was something there was some question they gave us 

374.27 381.40 B: there was this nonsense about the if uh if you have a cold and you don't go to the doctor it last seven days and if you do go to the doctor it lasts a week this is 

381.70 382.92 B: did did you get that in your 

382.40 391.21 A: yeah i didn't really quite follow that uh because my phone is really not the highest quality and so it was like the sound quality was not that good anyway but i didn't really quite follow what that was about 

388.87 389.34 B: oh 

390.99 393.40 B: i think he said there's a saying 

393.99 394.61 B: um 

394.89 396.30 B: that if you have a cold and you 

396.42 403.68 B: don't go to the doctor it'll last seven days and if you do go to the doctor it'll last a week what is your opinion do you agree or what is your opinion it doesn't it 

402.85 409.04 A: uh i'm afraid i have no opinion of that unless it's like you know out of an absurdist play or something right 

404.30 405.33 B: no 

407.57 409.00 B: yeah right it uh 

409.68 414.07 B: it it it didn't seem to i've never heard of that it's sort of an aphorism for one thing 

413.91 414.85 A: i don't know 

414.82 420.83 B: and it doesn't really i guess their point is that there's nothing you can do about the cold right would that be the yeah (( )) so like you 

419.08 419.82 A: right 

433.14 436.72 B: oh i know i've started using echinacea sometimes have you heard of that stuff 

435.70 436.03 A: mhm 

436.19 439.48 A: yeah i've heard of now i don't know what the heck it is why don't you tell me about it 

439.36 444.79 B: uh it's some sort of herb it it it's normal name is something like golden seal or something like that 

444.33 446.81 A: oh yeah it's from a plant in other words it's herbal right 

445.94 454.11 B: it's some plant that grows natively in like the prairies of the u._s. and was used traditionally this is what they say you know in their packaging to make it sound like it's ancient 

449.57 450.00 A: mhm 

454.29 455.54 B: full of wisdom 

454.39 456.49 A: yeah it's like ancient wisdom i'm sure right 

455.97 459.65 B: exactly but that it grew and was used by the prairie indians to during the 

459.51 462.32 A: and they never got sick they lived to be a hundred years old right 

461.45 462.98 B: well 

462.52 464.34 A: i'm fooling around 

464.17 466.60 B: at any rate it's supposed to be an immune booster and i guess it's 

466.41 466.69 A: right 

466.79 471.53 B: it's not like it's it's sold as an herb in the u._s. so it's not f._d._a. regulated 

471.18 471.89 A: exactly 

471.89 473.11 B: but other countries have 

472.73 478.32 A: and the the claims that they make about it aren't regulated so they can basically say anything they want about it and you can like buy it or not buy it 

476.63 477.03 B: yeah 

478.41 483.43 B: i've heard from europeans though that there have been there's some countries in europe where it's regulate and where it 

493.09 498.49 B: um so it's somehow an immune booster and they actually put a warning on it that people with immune like 

498.73 500.02 B: immune def- um 

500.17 506.08 B: auto immune problems aren't supposed to take it or uh people who take immune suppressors aren't supposed to take it 

505.86 506.16 A: mhm 

506.26 508.54 B: so (( )) has some effect on the immune system
