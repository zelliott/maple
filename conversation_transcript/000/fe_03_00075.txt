257.00 257.93 A: it 

258.24 263.60 A: i remember [mn] that uh sometimes uh you have to choose from 

264.51 266.05 A: two of them 

265.37 267.71 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

266.95 274.74 A: you have to choose two from three of them it's i think it's very very bad to the last one [mn] 

268.80 270.49 B: [noise] 

271.26 272.50 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

275.46 281.50 B: do you think that it's okay that they h- have those kind of shows [noise] [noise] 

281.34 282.60 A: (( um )) 

284.27 285.38 A: (( i think )) 

285.92 290.89 A: it's okay but um but um my opinion of this kind of sh- of shows 

290.90 293.01 A: is merely to attract 

293.03 295.82 A: attract others to look at their shows 

296.81 297.75 A: (( and )) 

296.82 298.66 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

297.81 298.73 A: i think 

299.23 304.27 A: in reality i i don't think these these kind of things would happen 

304.92 306.20 B: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

306.29 311.45 B: right do you think that that they should keep putting people in these positions 

313.24 314.54 B: you know where 

313.49 314.63 A: (( uh [mn] )) 

314.81 318.05 B: you know they put all these girls there and 

319.64 322.77 B: make them feel that they have this false sense of 

323.21 324.19 A: (( i )) 

323.28 326.52 B: love for this guy that they barely know 

328.03 331.25 A: i don't think [mn] it is uh reasonable 

330.88 333.38 B: [noise] right right 

333.56 334.50 B: um 

335.30 341.18 B: but can you blame the media when if people watch [noise] it of course they're going to do it again 

342.43 343.64 A: (( you mean )) 

343.37 347.79 B: [noise] well the i'm sure the t._v. stations are saying 

348.04 354.61 B: well you know it we brought in twenty five million viewers so of course we're gonna do it again 

354.72 358.83 B: i mean the only way they would stop doing it is people stop watching 

354.81 356.35 A: [laughter] 

359.05 359.62 B: (( [noise] )) 

359.43 366.70 A: uh yeah probably but but actually uh i don't think uh 

367.75 377.82 A: i think the um when people are watching of these these kind of shows it's not they would not expect these kind of things would happen during 

378.09 379.62 A: (( in real life )) 

378.73 379.49 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

379.71 381.01 B: (( right )) 

381.39 385.99 A: so so why why do these t._v. stations do that again 

382.66 383.52 B: so 

386.02 389.06 B: so really then it's not reality t._v. 

389.06 390.03 A: uh-huh 

389.46 396.73 B: i mean all these shows um [noise] what was the show that started it all on m._t._v. 

396.65 398.64 A: (( yes i mean it's )) 

397.31 398.91 B: the real world 

399.27 403.62 B: i mean that's not real i mean you put six strangers in a house 

403.87 406.74 B: you know a huge mansion and 

407.12 409.19 B: you know they have all this 

409.89 415.42 A: mhm yeah i mean y- these kind of things can't happen in reality 

414.75 416.18 B: (( [noise] right )) 

415.73 416.62 A: so 

417.46 422.95 B: so yeah so it's not really reality t._v. i mean if they want reality t._v. they should 

423.44 433.67 B: come [noise] to my house and watch me [noise] you know try to get my one year old and my two year old to get along [laughter] you 

429.82 431.39 A: okay [mn] 

434.52 435.41 B: (( know so )) 

435.45 437.55 B: um [noise] 

438.44 439.95 B: well let's see 

440.21 445.70 B: yeah i just i think all the reality shows are stupid i don't know i've never watched survivor 

445.70 446.64 A: uh-huh 

446.12 449.62 B: i've watched about ten minutes of the bachelor 

449.93 450.87 A: (( oh yes )) 

450.57 454.40 B: the first bachelor thing that was on because i just 

455.64 464.73 B: was shocked [laughter] you know i didn't really know what that one entailed the second one came along and then i obviously knew [noise] what was going on but 

457.41 459.53 A: [laughter] 

464.80 465.96 B: um 

466.52 467.75 B: [noise] it 

467.98 471.98 B: just i don't know it seems a bit 

472.85 485.69 B: [sigh] mean to put people in those positions and i think a lot of the people who are doing the class oh doing the class doing the show [noise] [noise] aren't doing it for reality either they're doing it for 

482.45 483.45 A: (( okay mhm )) 

485.87 486.88 B: um 

488.95 496.50 B: exposure and trying to break into show business and that's just another way to do it so that's just another way that it's not reality again 

496.32 497.45 A: yes yeah i agree 

497.89 503.37 B: have you seen the commercial for the new show that's gonna start in january 

503.60 506.91 B: on fox it's called joe millionaire 

503.73 504.84 A: uh which one 

507.58 510.59 A: uh no no uh y- 

509.45 511.48 B: it's a show where 

511.52 515.06 B: i i think i mean i've only seen a commercial for it but 

515.56 525.38 B: where there's a bunch of girls try you know it's kinda like the bachelor only they think that they guy is worth fifty million dollars 

519.96 520.83 A: (( mhm yes )) 

525.15 526.22 A: (( okay mhm )) 

525.70 528.59 B: but in reality he 

528.70 531.39 B: only makes like twenty thousand dollars a year 

531.33 532.27 A: (( okay mhm )) 

532.03 539.01 B: and i i'm assuming apparently they don't tell the girls until you know he picks the final one 

539.19 545.38 B: and she's probably thinking then oh cool you know i mean this multi millionaire's [noise] in love with me 

545.70 552.12 B: and then they tell her oh yeah he's a construction worker and he only makes twenty thousand dollars a year 

552.05 559.77 A: mhm oh you m- you mean uh this uh this is a new one and will start next january 

559.37 560.15 B: yeah 

560.35 565.67 A: oh okay yeah maybe probably i i would look at it watch it 

565.09 569.11 B: you don't think that's mean to do that deceptive [noise] 

569.70 570.72 A: (( i mean )) 

570.87 574.12 A: y- the the problem is that uh 

575.53 581.63 A: i i don't personally i don't think these kind of t._v. shows are called reality tv [mn] 

581.07 582.69 B: right 

581.68 590.79 A: uh so so it's it's okay for me to watch it uh but uh it's by no means that this kind of thing will happen in real life 

590.72 592.02 B: (( [noise] right )) 

592.28 593.76 B: (( [noise] right )) 

594.28 602.40 B: um you don't think we should just leave t._v. up to the professional actors and actresses who wanna do that for a living 

604.59 609.29 A: you mean someone would would do that just for a living 

609.40 612.08 B: just not have reality shows at all 

612.95 615.73 A: [laughter] okay 

615.20 617.91 B: do you think we should not have reality shows 

619.07 621.27 A: yes i i mean it's 

622.82 625.94 A: it's i i think it's if you can 

626.17 628.81 A: (( think of this just like )) 

627.62 628.69 B: [noise] 

629.01 632.74 A: i mean a k- some kind of a black humor 

633.47 635.06 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

633.69 634.43 A: (( first [mn] )) 

634.45 637.78 A: it ha- it happens it e- exists but uh 

637.82 638.89 A: i mean 

639.10 640.32 A: but i 

640.59 641.53 A: mean 

641.69 644.86 A: it so when you watch it you can 

646.23 655.08 A: just enjoy yourself and this won't happen in real life so i think it's okay for this kind of show to exist 

647.50 648.08 B: [noise] 

656.21 660.63 A: you know but i i don't think [laughter] this kind of uh 

660.92 663.16 A: thing would happen in real life [mn] 

662.57 665.54 B: right right [noise] 

665.57 667.64 B: yeah i i think we 

667.81 669.11 B: agree 

669.59 672.95 B: [laughter] for the most part so yeah it's 

673.24 673.94 B: they're 

674.58 679.03 B: pretty silly i think they're a huge waste of time and money 

679.06 681.39 B: [laughter] 

679.42 680.49 A: [laughter] 

681.00 681.92 A: so 

682.51 686.63 A: so i mean is this kind of shows 

686.82 688.89 A: (( very popular in the united states )) 

689.97 691.11 B: (( um )) 

691.68 699.42 B: oh yeah they're very popular [laughter] oh yeah a lot of people watch 'em [noise] um 

694.63 696.07 A: oh okay 

700.10 700.78 B: (( i )) 

700.21 704.96 A: so so actually when i watch watch t._v. i just uh uh 

704.66 707.07 B: (( [noise] )) 

706.70 707.67 A: i mean 

707.79 713.10 A: just kind of randomly select channels so so this 

711.20 712.30 B: okay 

713.40 719.89 A: this kind of shows happens i may stop and watch but it doesn't happen i i would not
