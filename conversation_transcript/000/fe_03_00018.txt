38.15 51.42 A: goodness goodness me [laughter] um i've had it um i'm feeling better um i think that i'd never heard that expression a cold last seven days had you heard that expression

74.04 77.67 B: let's say january february it starts really getting cold 

77.58 85.02 A: it's funny 'cause everybody in the office seems to have something and a lot of my friends have something right now but we've been getting a lot of snow 

85.51 93.25 A: so it's unusual 'cause well not that unusual for new england but last winter we got nothing snow wise 

92.21 92.77 B: (( mm )) 

93.37 96.86 A: and um now everybody seems to have something and it's 

97.08 102.90 A: i actually thought i sounded a lot better today but my mom was saying oh you sound awful and you're 

101.93 107.95 B: no i can't even tell if you hadn't have told me you had a cold i wouldn't have known so you say you're fr- you're from maine 

103.37 104.49 A: (( [mn] )) 

104.89 106.84 A: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

107.57 110.76 A: um my mom's up in maine i'm from massachussetts 

109.90 111.78 B: (( massachussetts i'm sorry okay )) 

111.15 112.41 A: and um 

112.56 123.54 A: yeah i'm headed to jamaica actually on sunday because my boyfriend won an all expense paid trip for two to jamaica on jeopardy last year 

122.97 124.60 B: oh 

123.96 128.35 A: so people actually do win these things and i'm really going 

126.29 127.44 B: (( right )) 

128.28 131.05 B: oh that is really nice 

130.14 133.08 A: [mn] [mn] yeah the timing is really good [laughter] 

132.13 134.84 B: oh and i and i love jeopardy that's good 

134.75 137.71 A: yeah apparently they are not giving away 

137.83 141.96 A: um trips any more as prizes they're just giving away cash 

140.32 141.39 B: mhm 

141.57 142.52 B: okay 

142.22 143.25 A: so 

143.37 149.04 B: (( no suppose we ought to be back on our topic though [laughter] yeah illness )) 

145.82 148.64 A: oh i know okay so illness right okay 

148.65 149.78 A: um 

149.99 159.71 B: yeah i i've heard that growing up you know that it doesn't matter that a a cold is going to run its course whether you take something or not and personally i think that um 

159.98 166.56 B: the medicines that we do take usually just allow you to get rest so that your body can 

166.86 168.82 B: heal itself i don't think 

167.79 181.17 A: i think that's a pretty that's a pretty good point actually it's it's funny i almost declined illness uh because my mother's a christian scientist but my father's an episcopa- was an episcopalian and i'm an episcopalian now so 

176.79 177.65 B: oh 

181.15 184.65 A: um i don't mind taking medicine 

184.57 185.43 B: okay 

184.89 188.18 A: um but it's it's funny 'cause for some reason 

188.57 200.70 A: with this par- particular cold i've been trying to just sort of stick to cough drops as opposed to you know hitting it full on with the nyquil and um i've been sleeping pretty well 

200.34 201.24 B: okay 

200.82 202.22 A: and uh 

202.39 206.16 A: it's just sort of running its course and um 

206.18 214.28 A: but i maybe that does rel- relate back to that expression where it's like if you go to the doctor or not [mn] you're just going to have to wait it out 

214.07 216.52 B: have you ever gone to the doctor for a cold 

215.86 223.11 A: um for a cold no i ha- i mean it seems a little like overkill 

222.81 223.64 B: yeah 

223.34 225.05 A: um have you 

224.75 238.07 B: no that's why i i guess why people don't think that it will do uh any good whereas i think that other types of things like sinus troubles um i've let those go and those have just gotten worse 

225.19 226.27 A: [laughter] 

237.45 241.98 A: oh and that's pretty serious that's that's a whole nother kettle of fish 

239.26 240.32 B: yeah 

241.60 244.22 B: yeah whereas colds they just seem to 

244.69 250.97 B: go away on their own yeah once my first time getting a sinus uh infection i got it in 

251.21 252.42 B: october 

252.77 257.46 B: and i didn't go and i didn't go and here the season had changed again 

257.55 262.42 B: um like it was in march or april and i really had a hard time [mn] 

262.25 264.12 A: (( now how did you know )) 

264.27 272.83 A: i how would you i've never had one so h- how do you know that you have a sinus infection as opposed to just you know a runny nose or something 

272.58 282.00 B: well you know that first time i didn't i was taking cold medicine for it and it wasn't doing any its job or more than a week had passed [laughter] and i still had it 

280.15 281.26 A: yes 

282.04 291.47 B: and um it i just kept getting worse and worse and worse and um finally when i did go i had to have uh 

291.68 297.58 B: some very very strong antibi- -biotics and it uh cleared up my passa- my 

297.61 300.10 B: nasal passages and they were full 

299.83 301.48 A: wow 

300.51 303.30 B: stuff came out for about a week but 

302.64 304.40 A: oh my goodness 

303.86 308.16 B: i had this you know so that was my first experience with it 

308.66 310.55 B: and it it was just terrible because 

309.90 314.22 A: are they like recurring i mean once you get one do you just keep getting them or 

313.54 317.59 B: they they can i did have them uh continually 

317.78 322.46 B: uh for a while in fact my nose would bleed like every day 

322.65 323.33 B: like 

322.93 324.08 A: oh 

323.68 327.55 B: at the same time like eleven o'clock i would have a nose bleed you know somewhere 

327.68 331.70 B: for about a week in in mar- uh in the in the spring 

331.77 340.97 B: and th- that happened for several years and then finally uh because i realized that it wasn't a cold i finally started going to the doctor like right away 

340.98 342.96 B: when i um knew 

342.64 346.67 A: because you started to recognize after a while probably the sign 

345.48 348.44 B: recognize and the difference between i think uh 

348.46 356.22 B: like your your coughs in regarding sinus infection and a cold i think with a cold you cough more in your chest area 

355.82 357.73 A: oh 

356.55 358.54 B: whereas with sinus it's it's 

358.75 370.85 B: it's in the head and you can feel the dripping of the nasal passages in the back of your throat and it tickles your throat and that's what you get a cough from as opposed to something being in your chest or you know down in your 

361.32 362.17 A: (( ooh )) 

370.56 376.74 A: it's funny you should mention that because it's like this cold sort of started out and it was just this 

376.92 382.92 A: dry annoying cough and nothing else it felt fine except for this cough 

383.02 393.51 A: and i swear i'm like is this some kind of a weird post nasal thing and so i took afrin for a little bit and i think that was helping for a while but [mn] 

393.50 400.23 A: now it's just sort of settled right in the chest i think it's exactly classic cold that i'm thinking 

400.40 410.86 A: a little sun [laughter] and some fruit juice [laughter] i might be [mn] i might be a lot better but vaporizer helped last night too so 

402.31 403.16 B: (( hm [laughter] )) 

403.89 404.89 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

410.95 414.22 A: i might try that because they say that um 

414.29 423.21 A: sometimes it's just it helps to keep it all sort of soft and warm and moist as opposed to this dry winter air which i think makes it worse 

422.60 423.28 B: (( right )) 

423.71 427.21 B: i had gotten where i was taking a i think it was uh 

428.67 429.25 B: (( [mn] )) 

429.42 430.51 B: it was a 

431.88 441.40 B: [lipsmack] some some brand but what it did is it it was designed you know it was designed to dry you up but it dried me up too much until it actually produced a dry cough i w- 

436.74 437.53 A: mm 

441.39 443.26 A: oh oh 

442.45 447.20 B: so i stopped taking that for the sinuses because it was just too dry 

447.59 451.25 A: mm that's wow i never would have thought of that i just 

451.46 456.90 A: i just know that i hate that feeling where it's just tickling the back of your throat and you're just like 

455.01 455.62 B: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

457.04 468.41 A: uh it gets very frustrating and of course the other thing i'm a little nervous about is you know being on the plane because they say that air in the plane is supposed to be recirculating the same 

468.44 471.18 A: air that everybody else was breathing and 

471.01 472.27 B: (( yeah that's good )) 

471.55 472.93 A: [lipsmack] but um 

473.21 477.89 A: hopefully hopefully hopefully um it should be a little better 

478.26 484.24 A: but so your your weather has not been so far you you guys get it more in january 

483.88 489.84 B: well we yeah we have a little bit of snow but january and february are [sigh] our hardest uh 

489.87 496.27 B: months like right now there's a little a little bit of snow in our the streets are clear so there's the uh 

497.45 498.70 B: the lawn 

498.72 501.13 B: has snow on it but the streets are clear 

500.87 502.83 A: oh well that's not bad 

501.95 503.20 B: yeah come 

503.29 506.59 B: come january february i mean everything's going to be 

506.74 507.54 B: (( snow )) 

508.96 509.62 B: (( so )) 

509.73 512.46 B: we're d- doing pretty pretty good so far yeah 

511.79 513.62 A: that's that's pretty cool 

514.35 516.59 A: (( so what do we do next are we )) 

515.83 519.38 B: well i guess we keep talking to the phone [laughter] till the 

518.22 520.63 A: does it tell us when to stop talking 

519.87 522.18 B: (( yeah i think they'll tell tell us when to stop )) 

521.60 523.14 A: okay well [lipsmack] 

522.30 525.69 B: but i also wanted to mention to you too about uh 

525.96 532.04 B: a- [mn] back to my story about uh my my history of sinus infections well 

532.05 533.96 B: last um 

534.10 537.06 B: time i got it i took silver 

537.33 549.57 B: so i'm into minerals i i didn't use medicines but i also believe in uh helping the body heal itself and i took the silver and just breathed some in my nostrils 

539.34 540.56 A: oh 

549.36 550.85 A: oh really 

549.92 556.82 B: and i i didn't get it at all this year it cleared up then that was the earlier part of uh this year and then i didn't get it at all 

556.71 558.55 A: that's fascinating 

557.89 559.25 B: it is 

559.04 561.59 A: so how do you where do you find that 

561.20 566.27 B: there's uh this company that is called eniva if you wanna look on the uh 

566.53 569.03 A: how do you spell it a. n. e. v. a. 

567.95 570.83 B: it's e. n. i. v. a. 

571.70 573.34 B: eniva dot com 

573.92 575.52 B: and they should have some 

575.48 579.15 A: that sounds really interesting how did they find out about that 

579.21 588.79 B: you know i have a a friend that actually h- that got me hooked on some other stuff and th- they have a lot of different minerals single minerals um 

589.12 596.74 B: and the difference is is they're clear so it looks like water when you're looking at the bottle you're like this is water and i was really sceptical [laughter] at first 

595.81 597.36 A: oh my goodness 

596.74 605.00 B: but when you taste it oh you're like oh this is a mineral [laughter] because it tastes nasty [laughter] and they all have their different tastes you know 

600.24 602.20 A: that's funny 

605.09 611.12 B: and the the silver silver is horrible i can see how it would [laughter] clear whatever ails you 

610.10 614.71 A: do something up there that wow that's really interesting 

613.15 618.59 B: and i take the uh gold which helps me to sleep a- and uh calcium and magnesium 

618.36 619.60 A: (( wow )) 

619.14 622.85 B: because a lot of the vitamins that you take um 

623.49 626.96 B: you know they they are not absorbed by the the body 

626.48 627.62 A: mhm 

627.23 632.26 B: you only absorb about ten percent of it because they're just they're in such a hard form 

632.07 639.65 A: yes oh sure i've heard that they're really not that good f- i mean they don't do as much as they pretend that they do 

638.91 642.31 B: no they j- they really come back out that's that's [laughter] 

641.52 643.28 A: yeah basically 

642.72 643.90 B: yeah 

643.31 649.81 A: and it seems sort of yeah i was talking them for a little while and sometimes when i'm ill i'll take some but 

649.85 653.39 A: it doesn't seem like they do that much for you 

653.41 656.08 A: a healthy diet's important but 

653.62 654.25 B: (( mm )) 

655.57 656.54 B: yeah 

656.45 662.13 A: but so wow i know there's a guy at work who does the whole um 

662.61 666.13 A: copper and mag- magnetic 

666.23 667.82 A: sort of therapy 

667.44 668.39 B: okay 

668.13 673.12 A: and uh i think he wears a lot of those magnets on 

673.06 683.39 A: on his arms and stuff and my boyfriend has like a problem with his knee occasionally and he used t- [laughter] he was icing his knee [mn] all the time 

683.52 696.43 A: and he had like frozen not frozen peas he started with the frozen peas but he found that he liked the brown sugar to keep it in the freezer and he put that on his knee and i'm like this is getting ridiculous 

695.60 697.02 B: (( mhm brown sugar )) 

696.93 698.40 A: well because [lipsmack] 

699.15 707.20 A: he could just keep reusing it and he's like a very parsimonious sort of um individual 

705.19 706.14 B: [laughter] 

707.32 719.89 A: and i couldn't take it any more so i used um the discover card and they give you cash back and you can get double plus bonus points if you shop at certain ve- vendors and so shop
