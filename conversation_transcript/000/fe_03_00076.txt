56.23 59.01 B: that they did get along right (( )) away and 

60.00 60.47 B: but i think 

60.67 61.35 B: they were just a 

61.74 63.01 B: bunch of people watching it right 

63.54 65.54 B: broke all kinds of records for people watching it 

65.14 71.20 A: oh i'm sure yeah i don't know why i mean it seems like we are becoming more and more fascinated with reality t._v. i don't know why 

71.82 72.67 B: more voyeurism 

74.10 74.86 A: what did what did you say 

74.93 76.16 B: more voyeurism 

76.33 77.29 A: yeah i guess so 

77.61 80.50 A: i mean but why why is it that we want that i wonder 

81.85 83.09 B: you know there is this show that i 

83.26 85.83 B: have watched a few times the anna nicole smith show it's 

85.95 86.50 B: supposed to be 

87.05 87.77 B: totally awful 

88.12 88.53 A: uh-huh 

90.16 90.93 B: and it 

92.49 93.67 B: just totally bizarre (( )) 

94.05 96.03 B: it is something like you have never seen before 

96.21 97.43 B: the stuff that goes on there 

97.67 98.12 A: right 

98.10 100.50 B: so that i guess it is it is just mindless kind of a 

101.39 104.05 B: a waste of time in some sense but it is kind of a 

104.42 105.46 B: mind numbing event 

105.92 106.28 A: uh-huh 

107.76 109.30 B: and why would i want to do that i don't know 

109.62 112.77 B: the osbournes are another one that comes to mind but i've never seen the osbournes 

113.03 114.22 A: i haven't seen that either 

115.07 115.99 B: but you know what the 

115.25 116.00 A: but i just 

116.19 117.21 B: big phenomenon right 

117.68 118.25 A: yeah 

118.52 118.87 A: i 

118.98 119.47 A: well 

119.91 124.59 A: i mean from what i have heard i don't i don't (( see )) a t._v. so much but i i have heard that people do talk you know 

125.21 126.73 A: talk about ozzy 

127.58 128.06 B: yeah 

127.63 129.56 A: it's so strange it's so strange i think 

132.79 134.62 B: and then there's those other ones like survivor 

134.75 135.07 B: right 

134.96 135.39 A: right 

136.09 140.14 B: and people are watching each of those episodes and those people became famous afterwards 

141.04 141.42 A: right 

142.05 147.35 A: um actually this is sort of funny i work at a restaurant and once uh there was this guy working at the same place 

147.86 150.86 A: his name was tom he was on temptation isl- temptation island 

151.37 151.63 B: yeah 

151.44 154.16 A: so everyone called him temptation tom but he doesn't work there anymore 

156.47 157.46 B: did he go with his 

157.78 158.97 B: girlfriend that's one where you (( went )) 

159.07 159.75 B: down with a 

160.13 161.00 B: significant other 

160.33 160.89 A: yeah you went 

161.10 163.52 A: yeah he went with someone else and he he he like 

164.24 165.65 A: i don't know hung out with all the singles 

166.33 167.15 B: and then they voted 

167.26 168.45 B: whether you (( want )) to stay or not 

168.72 173.53 A: it seems like fox is is the network responsible for most of the reality television 

174.19 174.59 B: yeah 

175.01 175.63 A: which 

175.79 177.13 A: i don't know i mean i am not 

177.57 179.39 A: i am not a big fan of the fox network 

183.31 184.96 A: so i yeah i think you know 

185.23 187.73 A: it is just interesting to me that people you know like 

187.84 189.87 A: sort (( )) lost their desire for 

189.99 191.37 A: like a fictionalization 

191.98 192.51 A: you know like 

193.04 193.34 A: (( )) 

193.51 197.58 A: i would say most people would be more interested in watching like a reality 

197.75 199.26 A: t._v. or reality sort of 

199.61 200.72 A: premise versus 

201.59 203.40 A: you know something highly fictionalized you know 

204.92 205.43 A: um 

206.54 207.47 B: i don't know i mean it is 

208.72 212.41 B: i i haven't i did admit that i've watched the anna nicole 

212.54 213.06 B: smith show 

213.52 215.25 B: and the reason i watch it is 

215.88 218.23 B: total escapism so when i watch that show 

219.47 220.38 B: people that 

220.95 222.94 B: i don't come into contact with normally 

223.13 223.55 A: right 

223.74 225.63 B: i don't know anyone like an anna nicole 

225.74 226.12 B: smith 

227.08 228.03 A: so it's like you can 

227.46 228.03 B: sort of wa- 

228.52 229.07 A: yeah 

229.86 230.26 A: i- 

230.05 231.09 B: just kind of eavesdrop 

230.36 231.53 A: i know what you are getting at i think 

232.01 235.82 B: yeah i think the kind of eavesdrop in and just see what kind of bizarre thing is going to happen 

236.18 239.08 B: and you kind of watch it and you kind of say geez i can't believe they just did that 

239.51 239.82 B: right 

240.21 240.60 A: right 

240.42 241.16 B: that kind of stuff 

241.62 242.18 A: yeah 

242.57 244.01 B: there is some fascination with it 

244.43 244.83 A: uh-huh 

245.74 248.80 B: i'm no watching because i am enamored with anna nicole smith 

249.81 251.87 B: i could really care but when you see this 

252.74 253.32 B: obese 

253.54 254.26 B: person 

254.56 255.88 B: who used to be a 

256.39 258.11 B: what was she a hustler centerfold or 

259.17 261.54 B: she was one of a penthouse centerfold i think right 

259.30 259.96 A: something like that 

261.12 264.01 A: how did she get so big she how did she put on all that weight 

264.45 269.03 B: well they showed her in a restaurant and they had like an eating contest (( )) 

269.97 273.91 B: that was one of the more bizarre shows she actually went into the bathroom and threw up she had eaten so much 

274.09 275.00 A: are you kidding me 

275.12 276.54 A: they showed her throwing up on t._v. 

275.43 275.93 B: not (( )) 

276.96 281.64 B: well she came out and she got into an argument with her lawyer her lawyer is one of the people on the show 

282.87 284.45 B: and (( kimmy )) was there (( kimmy )) is 

286.29 289.48 B: i'm not sure is she is just gay or bisexual (( kimmy )) is her assistant 

289.97 290.40 A: i see 

290.19 291.42 B: and then her son was there 

292.21 292.58 B: so it is just 

292.84 298.13 B: it's one of these very odd things you just wonder how do people go about doing that and i think the osbournes are probably similar 

298.23 299.89 B: similar so i've never seen the osbournes 

298.94 299.31 A: uh-huh 

300.29 300.64 A: no 

300.66 302.20 B: where it's just so out there that 

303.31 304.78 B: it almost fascinating look- 

304.99 306.90 B: turning your head to look at a car wreck or something 

307.19 307.88 A: right right 

309.17 311.29 B: i don't see the fascination though with um 

312.06 314.92 B: the millionaire one wasn't that fascinating to me 

315.27 317.08 B: i didn't get caught up in wanting to watch that 

318.06 322.62 A: i wonder if that was like geared more toward the female uh viewing viewing (( )) you know like 

322.69 323.07 B: oh 

323.02 323.42 A: i don't know 

325.55 326.85 A: i don't know who watched that one either 

328.21 330.04 B: i think the reality t._v.'s could be 

331.36 332.73 B: entertaining and 

333.12 333.70 B: mindless 

333.88 334.32 B: to watch 

334.83 335.16 A: yeah 

337.04 337.54 B: (( we'll watch them )) 

337.68 338.66 B: for that reason 

338.85 339.83 B: that's why i would watch them 

339.92 340.68 B: or do watch them 

340.23 340.62 A: right 

341.43 342.24 B: and i have seen howard 

342.43 344.84 B: stern which isn't really reality t._v. but 

346.32 347.76 B: have you ever heard his radio show 

348.13 349.40 A: i have um 

348.17 348.77 B: (( )) 

349.76 352.79 A: i think in when i was in high school many years ago i used to listen to it but 

353.44 353.99 A: i you know 

354.09 357.41 A: i (( )) i don't really like it so much i think it's just too offensive 

358.13 358.44 A: for me 

360.39 363.30 B: but people i think listen to it because he does get in there and he talks 

363.39 363.93 B: to people about 

364.40 364.75 A: yeah 

364.86 365.61 B: personal 

365.74 367.58 B: aspects of their lives and people get 

368.11 369.91 B: interested in hearing what other people do 

370.31 370.69 A: uh-huh 

370.66 372.00 B: maybe it's like a big gossip thing 

373.84 375.67 A: yeah it is like gossip i suppose huh 

378.43 380.79 B: and you get to eavesdrop in and watch what other people do 

381.56 382.58 A: makes you (( )) 

381.62 383.00 B: that survivor though is a whole 

383.44 385.76 B: (( )) you know there is a whole bunch of people talking about it 

386.13 386.48 A: mhm 

389.99 390.33 A: yeah 

392.35 394.64 A: well i wonder where i wonder where it is headed 

392.59 392.95 B: (( )) 

395.36 396.73 A: interesting to think about you know 

398.05 398.43 A: um 

398.40 400.53 B: well it's probably like all fads people will probably get 

402.02 403.31 B: you know had too much of it 

403.85 405.11 B: go back to something else 

405.35 407.91 A: yeah unless it like if more uh like 

408.11 409.85 A: more intense in that direction 

410.18 412.25 A: like the movie total recall or something 

410.33 411.44 B: (( )) more and more bizarre 

413.54 414.02 B: right 

417.07 417.38 A: so 

418.30 418.73 A: well 

418.95 419.68 A: um 

421.43 423.46 A: i i don't know what else to say about reality 

423.56 424.90 A: television 

426.15 427.24 B: well what is the alternative 

427.59 428.82 B: for people watching t._v. 

428.95 430.35 B: for reality i mean you can watch 

430.91 432.01 B: a news show right 

432.62 433.00 A: uh-huh 

433.65 435.43 B: there is a lot on there i think even 

436.08 437.44 B: h._d._t._v. which (( )) 

437.56 439.14 B: (( )) channel my wife likes 

439.47 441.40 B: watching is all about decorating homes 

441.90 443.98 A: oh the home and garden network 

442.41 442.95 B: (( )) 

444.41 445.16 B: yeah 

446.07 447.92 B: but in some sense that is (( somewhat )) 

448.90 453.09 B: i wouldn't uh for her it is somewhat educational because she watches and learns stuff but it's more 

453.48 455.89 B: you know what are they going to do with this room how is it going to turn out 

456.08 457.65 B: and that's reality t._v. too right 

458.83 460.08 A: i suppose so yeah 

461.97 462.32 A: yeah 

462.76 464.51 A: like trading spaces that show 

465.14 465.59 B: that's it 

465.73 466.70 B: that's one of her favorites 

466.96 467.41 A: yeah 

469.49 470.78 A: i think it is in the same 

469.68 473.77 B: it is totally because you get to get in to people's lives they even ask them personal questions on the 

473.88 476.11 B: some of these right while you were out is another one 

476.51 476.81 A: right 

477.21 479.05 B: where people are out of the house and they redo a room 

482.69 487.82 B: or maybe what is going to happen is there is going to be more and more reality t._v. because it is kind of cheap to do i assume right 

482.80 483.18 A: well 

488.65 489.81 B: production standpoint 

489.30 490.43 A: low production costs yeah 

491.72 492.35 A: very much so 

491.84 492.43 B: and if you 

494.29 495.44 B: keep niching it to 

495.73 496.46 B: segment it out 

497.73 499.63 B: like while you were out or trading places 

500.13 501.03 B: there are going to find an audience 

502.19 505.47 A: i think also that you know not only do we want to sort of watch it but we 

505.88 509.29 A: we can sort of fantasize that we can be the people on the show as well 

509.66 510.99 A: because it is normal people you know 

511.10 511.95 A: it's not actors 

514.84 516.46 B: game shows are kind of along that way 

516.56 516.97 B: (( )) 

521.47 521.73 B: (( )) 

521.61 522.02 A: (( )) 

521.83 523.70 B: jeopardy or who wants to be a millionaire or something 

523.60 524.64 A: yeah (( and on the game shows )) 

528.31 528.59 A: yes 

534.51 534.90 A: yeah 

535.04 535.50 A: uh well 

536.38 537.24 A: i agree i i 

538.59 539.36 A: wheel of fortune 

539.66 542.78 A: i often fell like i could be on that show 

545.18 546.46 B: (( )) 

546.96 547.70 A: (( vanna white )) yeah 

548.60 549.45 B: is she still on there 

549.88 554.93 A: oh i think so man she's had like three kids and she's still spinning the wheel or she turns the letters 

557.69 558.61 A: she turns the letters
