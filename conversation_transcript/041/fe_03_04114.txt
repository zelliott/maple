8.52 9.36 B: yeah 

9.41 15.40 B: and this sounds like an exciting topic if you could open your own business and money were not an issue 

16.59 19.61 A: that that's the key if money were not an issue [laughter] 

18.42 20.48 B: [laughter] i know that's right [lipsmack] 

19.98 23.04 A: but actually i am alr- already a business owner so 

22.30 23.62 B: mhm mhm [lipsmack] 

23.66 28.25 A: um i own a i'm a consultant with party light gifts

39.03 41.38 A: well i actually i don't make the candles 

40.77 41.59 B: uh-huh

54.99 57.41 A: what kind what kind of business would you like to open 

57.22 58.43 B: um 

58.56 62.03 B: probably [lipsmack] a travel agency 

61.85 62.93 A: really 

62.34 63.25 B: mhm 

63.30 65.61 A: why would you wanna open a travel agency 

65.67 67.07 B: (( um )) 

67.95 73.86 B: because it sounds exciting and i could probably travel to some of the places that i would offer the clients and get a discount 

74.21 75.57 A: (( or work free )) 

75.29 80.77 B: [laughter] [laughter] [sigh] yeah or go for free that would even be better mhm

80.96 81.96 B: yeah 

82.17 83.04 B: mhm 

84.34 85.48 A: um 

86.53 93.30 A: state of the the country and the world right now probably money would have to not be an object with regard to a travel agency 

88.84 89.74 B: mhm 

92.60 97.79 B: oh yeah definitely because not a lot of people are traveling and i don't blame them because 

94.06 95.07 A: because 

97.83 103.34 B: it's um kind of scary out there sometimes but you can't let it control your life 

103.20 108.48 A: exactly exactly it just might not be the best time to open a travel agency right now though 

104.96 106.05 B: mhm 

107.82 109.88 B: (( mm mm no [lipsmack] )) 

110.43 121.42 B: i would probably just do it you know like small scale from from home [mn] have like a home based business and that way mhm mhm yep you cut down a lot of the expenses that way 

115.68 117.23 A: yeah that's what i do

171.96 182.28 A: like i said i i do enjoy it and it's a home based business and it's my business so i can do with it what i want you know i set my own goals and don't have to worry about 

178.30 179.34 B: right 

180.20 181.67 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

182.29 185.78 A: achieving anybody else's goals other than my husband's and mine so 

184.99 190.09 B: yeah yeah that that makes um a um quite a bit of difference you know 

189.82 190.95 A: yeah 

190.62 192.09 B: when you when it's that way 

191.83 194.88 A: yeah do you work outside the home now

196.76 197.70 A: okay 

197.15 199.85 B: and then i do uh consulting work from home also 

199.66 201.49 A: oh what kind of consulting do you do 

201.39 207.72 B: i do it for market research companies i find [mn] i have to recruit um people for focus groups 

207.85 212.65 A: i was a focus group moderator actually i had my own research company for about five years 

209.43 210.84 B: oh really 

212.09 214.02 B: oh okay did you enjoy that 

213.91 217.37 A: i did i really hated report writing though 

214.77 215.71 B: mhm 

216.72 218.11 B: i know 

218.00 226.27 A: and um it got to the point where in order to continue to be successful i was gonna have to do a lot of traveling 

218.16 219.88 B: [laughter] 

225.83 226.68 B: yeah 

226.46 227.80 A: and i 

226.93 239.80 B: you have to travel a lot in this in um you know the market research but you know right about now i think there is a slump because there are not many focus groups at all and each week it seems to be less so [lipsmack] yeah 

230.47 231.53 A: yeah 

238.07 239.25 A: really 

239.49 240.58 A: wow 

239.94 243.12 B: at least here i don't know about you know where you are but 

242.46 245.80 A: well you're that's a pretty major market though down in atlanta 

245.83 250.12 B: yeah but it's they've scaled way way back they really have 

249.28 253.39 A: well you know when budgets get cut marketing is one of the first things to go 

250.93 263.53 B: mhm oh yeah the first things to go yeah because you know they'll they just say well you know we'll just go with what we had from before and you know but um i think everybody's hurting right about now so 

263.24 265.09 A: yeah yeah 

265.23 273.66 A: everybody except uh party light everybody is nesting so people are staying home so they're buying lots of candles and lots of accessories 

271.43 272.60 B: oh okay 

273.30 274.01 B: okay 

274.37 275.04 B: (( well )) 

274.40 284.72 A: so it works out real well but yeah i um i didn't wanna travel i'm a newlywed i've been married for two and a half years and i didn't want to do the extensive traveling 

279.98 281.98 B: mhm mhm 

284.06 285.71 B: mhm 

284.81 286.56 A: that it would require 

285.99 287.02 B: yeah 

286.73 287.63 A: so 

287.35 292.91 B: no i wouldn't wanna travel either i have a brother and he travels every week he's in some different part of the country 

292.99 296.87 B: so that that works on your marriage after a while but um yeah mhm 

295.26 297.41 A: yeah definitely 

297.42 298.67 A: definitely 

298.96 301.83 A: so any other home based businesses you'd be interested in 

301.72 303.21 B: (( um i'd )) 

303.80 308.50 B: thought about um like a boutique well no um 

308.82 310.50 B: more like a 

311.07 320.08 B: accessory for home type shop you know like sell um different things for decorating decorating your home and something like that mhm 

318.03 321.65 A: mhm like party light accessories [laughter] 

320.59 333.80 B: mhm mhm something like that but i wouldn't wanna go into um you know into clients' homes and stuff i did that once with tupperware and i didn't really like it yeah mhm yeah i would just like to have 

326.81 327.43 A: (( mm )) 

327.55 328.69 A: mhm 

329.18 330.28 A: (( oh did you )) 

330.90 331.91 A: uh-huh 

332.36 334.46 A: what did you not like about that 

333.92 335.09 B: (( um )) 

335.22 337.16 B: [mn] traveling and going to 

337.33 349.03 B: people's homes and you know um it can be kind of scary for me because um i'm a victim of a violent crime so i'm i'm really um [lipsmack] protective of myself and you know yeah 

347.32 348.76 A: [sigh] i see 

348.84 351.80 A: that's understandable that's understandable 

349.77 350.72 B: mhm 

351.59 353.55 B: yeah so i just um 

353.74 355.76 B: really don't like um 

356.04 361.40 B: you know in going and setting up and you know you gotta get all your things together 

362.19 369.54 B: and wonder who's going to order or do what so i just you know don't really like that mhm 

367.59 371.18 A: yeah yeah i can under- you know some people don't and um 

371.63 381.48 A: the the setting up and stuff with party light doesn't bother me but i certainly wouldn't want to do anything like pampered chef because that is way too much work thank you very much [laughter] 

378.12 378.96 B: mhm 

379.62 383.60 B: mhm mhm [laughter] i know it is 

382.46 392.79 A: because you've you gotta lug all that heavy stuff with you you gotta set it up then you've gotta help your hostess clean up i don't think so [laughter] i don't 

385.27 388.32 B: mhm mhm mhm 

389.78 393.84 B: mhm oh no that is just too too much 

393.27 395.13 A: i don't wanna clean my own kitchen 

394.52 395.77 B: (( i know )) 

395.15 398.29 A: i certainly don't want to have to be responsible for cleaning somebody else's 

397.51 399.22 B: uh-huh me either 

399.42 404.26 A: so have you seriously thought about the boutique um idea or is that just 

404.34 413.97 B: it's just something that i kind of like play around with and um me and my husband kept sort of talk about it and you know we've checked on um different places you know 

414.10 415.36 B: to see as 

415.48 417.84 B: far as how much you know they would rent for 

417.44 418.48 A: right 

418.05 424.06 B: mhm and um you know we've sort of just kinda playing with it so maybe it'll happen one day so yeah 

422.79 423.98 A: yeah 

424.11 425.04 A: yeah 

426.19 427.58 A: oh

437.31 438.77 B: [laughter] 

439.84 452.39 B: um oh um how would you go about doing it um if money were no issue then um i don't guess i would have to go to the um what a a small business as- administration [laughter] for a loan or anything 

450.52 453.42 A: for a loan that's right that's right 

453.04 456.35 B: yeah 'cause we would we would have um lots of money i guess 

455.63 458.50 A: that's right and the rents wouldn't matter right 

457.79 459.73 B: no it wouldn't matter 

459.22 462.37 A: but of course you know what if money were no object 

461.76 462.65 B: mhm
