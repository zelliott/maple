10.64 12.16 A: yeah good to meet you too 

12.01 15.90 B: so y- i guess you heard the description of what we're supposed to talk about 

15.28 21.81 A: yeah we're supposed to discuss uh like businesses and if money wasn't an option how we would go about doing that [lipsmack] 

21.34 25.43 B: yeah like what kinda what kinda business would you start 

25.36 27.49 A: that's a good question i guess uh 

28.37 37.31 A: well i mean on a personal level i'd like to open like a restaurant or m- maybe a music store or something like that but i guess if money weren't an option 

34.18 35.18 B: yeah 

37.38 41.22 A: i'd feel bad about like not doing something to try to help people 

40.97 43.17 B: yeah 

42.52 45.85 A: but then i don't really know what you can do like that you know in a business setting 

45.67 47.35 B: right 

46.88 50.28 A: [laughter] like in a business setting i don't really know what you could really do 

50.31 52.32 A: to like help people out 

51.73 57.44 B: yeah i mean i guess you'd have to like decide on who you wanted to help and find out what their needs were and then 

57.53 60.06 B: find a way to give it to 'em i guess i don't know 

59.98 63.17 A: well sort of like a social working company or something 

63.09 64.09 B: mhm 

63.25 66.85 A: i know they got private institutions that do that but i don't really know how they work 

66.65 68.98 B: yeah i don't know 

67.88 69.38 A: all right what about you 

69.39 71.61 B: i don't know i think my approach would be 

72.27 74.63 B: i don't know like pretty selfish i'd probably 

74.67 89.21 B: i'd probably start some kind of business that would um i don't know like take me around the world or something you know like some kind of maybe a travel business or you know some something that was you know stress free where you can just i don't know kinda like live life you know 

82.74 84.59 A: (( oh yeah )) 

89.58 92.68 A: yeah that's true that's that's a good way to do it mm 

91.83 107.56 B: [laughter] i mean i like i live in los angeles and i work out here and i'm out here because of the business that i'm in and i always think like you know what if i didn't have to be in l._a. like southern california's great the weather's beautiful but l._a. is kinda i don't know i'm not a big fan of it you know 

107.34 108.39 A: yeah 

107.78 118.41 B: and i thought like if i ever didn't have to be here for work like man i would find some kinda you know you hear about these people going and teaching you know english in like japan or whatever you know what i mean 

117.68 122.80 A: yeah my dad actually did that that sounds great you know something where you really get to travel and like see other places 

122.57 125.69 B: yeah you said your dad did that 

123.25 124.59 A: i feel the same way 

124.61 126.70 A: yeah my dad taught english in japan 

126.99 130.81 B: wow that's i mean that's exciting i can't even imagine what that'd be like 

130.39 132.60 A: i think it must have been fun for him 

132.06 133.58 B: yeah 

132.89 135.86 A: you know i think i would like to to do some traveling too [lipsmack] 

135.68 136.82 B: yeah 

137.24 140.17 A: i don't know where i'd like to go i'm here in upstate new york 

139.54 140.48 B: uh-huh 

140.25 143.00 A: and uh yeah i don't care for it too much 

142.78 143.81 B: yeah 

143.18 148.68 A: honestly it seems like there's a whole lot of places in the world that uh i'd like to see that are probably a 

148.69 149.99 A: lot different from here 

149.92 152.05 B: yeah have you been there your whole life 

151.79 155.85 A: well i'm from the city originally then i came up here for college 

153.85 154.64 B: (( oh )) 

155.20 157.44 B: mhm 

156.67 159.61 A: so i've pretty much been on the east coast my whole life 

158.99 167.16 B: yeah well yeah my uh i had a a cousin who went to um cornell university which is up there right 

159.80 161.12 A: mhm 

166.53 167.54 A: (( yeah it's in it )) 

167.71 172.82 B: yeah um yeah it gets pretty cold out there right 

172.24 173.67 A: does get pretty cold 

173.05 179.06 B: [laughter] um [cough] but yeah uh i guess like back to the business thing 

178.44 179.45 A: yeah right 

179.54 181.69 B: uh i mean i don't know um 

181.75 190.74 B: you know 'cause it's an interesting question like if money were no option like the other the other question is like if you knew that you weren't gonna fail you know what i mean because 

189.26 193.37 A: right yeah true because most businesses fail in like the first year i hear 

193.21 200.23 B: yeah and i mean it sounds you know romantic uh you know run off and start a business where you're traveling around the world but i i do it 

198.26 201.94 A: yeah well you'd probably get stranded somewhere with no money 

201.10 205.87 B: yeah and i i i imagine too if it's so easy like a lot of a lot more people would be doing it you know 

205.71 207.04 A: yeah i think so 

206.86 207.96 B: i don't know 

207.22 211.83 A: what kind of job would let you travel to like a lot of different places do you think 

211.58 213.28 B: you know what um 

213.37 214.91 B: travel writers 

214.97 220.99 B: like guys who um write for uh you know like lonely planet and travel magazines and stuff it's 

220.18 221.34 A: oh yes 

221.41 228.76 B: and then uh actually the it sounds crazy but r- you know if you work in reality t._v. you travel a lot i have a friend who 

228.96 233.78 B: she's worked on the mole and survivor and so she's always going 

233.17 234.15 A: oh wow 

233.81 236.71 B: yeah she's always going to like you know 

237.08 246.51 B: ghana or something you know for like three months but the thing is it's like once you get over there it's not like you're on vacation like you got you have a twelve hour work schedule just like you would here you know 

245.99 247.75 A: yeah just like 

247.81 251.89 A: so that's why i think that uh some place where you could see a lot of places instead 

251.31 252.60 B: yeah 

252.03 257.15 A: of just going to one city because that's just kind of like relocating and then working in other places i'd be sick of it soon 

256.91 258.17 B: yeah 

257.50 263.92 A: traveling like to many different places yeah i mean that sounds interesting reality t._v. i g- i guess she gets to see a lot of places huh 

263.78 269.73 B: yes she does i mean another good one is um you know i know i have a couple of friends who work for the animal animal planet 

269.66 270.44 A: uh-huh 

270.10 278.89 B: and like they're tra- you know they travel a lot because they're always you know studying the mating habits of the nigerian tarantula or something you know what i mean 

277.43 279.93 A: (( [laughter] yeah they must )) 

280.11 283.25 B: so they uh they travel around quite a bit 

282.08 284.05 A: hm that's interesting 

283.84 291.99 B: i don't know i'm but the grass is always greener i mean you know you might travel a little bit and then decide you know i don't know it's not that great you know 

286.50 287.51 A: (( that's true )) 

291.41 297.59 A: yeah i agree when you're traveling a lot you probably ho- wish sometimes you could just like be grounded stay in one place for a while [noise] 

297.03 303.38 B: yeah absolutely i don't know i don't know what other kinda business i would start 

304.04 313.76 B: i know i mean a restaurant sounds cool i mean if you if you really liked you know where you lived and you know and you really loved it you know i think a restaurant would be cool because it's a it's 

309.07 310.26 A: (( [lipsmack] mhm )) 

312.95 315.62 A: i think so too if you were in a good area for it oh 

315.04 319.50 B: yeah and it's a very social you know occupation you know where 

319.02 320.27 A: yeah very much 

320.43 328.87 B: where you have regulars and i mean that's i i really would never wanna start any kind of business where i was solitary and i didn't interact with people you know 

328.49 332.41 A: yeah me either i think that would be a drag after even a very short while 

332.32 341.19 B: yeah and i mean like a restaurant it's it's great you know it's like th- there's always some place for you to go [laughter] to to hang out where there's a bunch of people and you know 

337.37 338.66 A: yeah true [laughter] 

340.17 350.27 A: mhm i used to work at a restaurant i didn't own it of course i was the waiter there but um [lipsmack] our manager our our managers there were two of 'em they uh they had a lotta work to do i mean they 

343.86 345.56 B: (( mm )) 

350.18 361.68 A: [lipsmack] i guess they were stressed they were always doing something but they seemed to be having a pretty good time doing it because you know they would come upstairs you know when they didn't have any paperwork or overseeing to do and they'd just like talk to customers or 

361.42 362.52 B: yeah 

361.95 365.73 A: stand at the bar and it seemed like those guys were having a real good time [lipsmack] 

365.44 368.62 B: mm especially if it's the right kind of restaurant you know 

365.81 366.38 A: (( [mn] )) 

368.44 370.10 A: yes yeah true 

368.96 373.97 B: i mean like if you were working in like a fine dining restaurant i bet you it's not as fun but 

373.72 375.22 A: yeah it's more formal 

374.95 376.94 B: yeah but uh 

376.07 381.87 A: also the same if you're at like a fast food or like kinda low end like at dairy queen or something but [lipsmack] 

380.90 391.29 B: oh yeah but i mean in terms of in terms of the traveling thing too that might also be called a a start you know a restaurant in like a foreign country or whatever if you knew someone who knew about the country 

382.44 383.48 A: (( [noise] )) 

391.06 397.87 A: oh yeah true and if money is no option you know if you start to be successful you can start opening chains basically like wherever you want to 

392.02 392.97 B: (( especially like )) 

397.70 398.99 B: yeah 

398.35 400.02 A: locations in any country [mn] 

399.74 404.63 B: mhm but like i bet i mean i i'm sure there's a lot of people who 

404.82 405.75 B: you know 

405.68 408.42 B: like i know i've seen it in movies you know where 

408.31 421.68 B: you know like a guy who's here like makes a bunch of money you know on the stock market or in business or whatever and retires to open up like a little restaurant in mexico or something you know what i mean or like a little bar in cancun you know at least that 

417.86 418.96 A: yeah 

420.69 423.26 A: little romantic dream that someone's had [laughter] their whole life 

422.86 430.41 B: yeah totally yeah it's almost like a cliche you know i mean yeah i just wanna settle down and open my own little place you know i mean it has to happen 

431.25 432.54 B: you know in real life 

432.98 433.80 A: (( [laughter] )) 

434.76 437.35 A: i guess it doesn't happen to a whole lot of people though 

437.36 438.25 B: yeah 

437.51 441.66 A: i mean having money not being an option business is not an easy thing to go into 

441.33 442.34 B: yeah 

441.68 444.18 A: have to kinda plan usually 

443.62 448.26 B: yeah i don't know i'm always fascinated by guys like 

448.42 450.75 B: you know the guy who runs virgin 

450.55 451.66 A: mhm 

451.04 453.87 B: um branson is that his name 

453.28 454.46 A: (( i don't know his name )) 

454.42 463.43 B: um but i mean he's like a guy who you know it's not like he was like a lawyer like knew the law or like was like a doctor and knew medicine like he just kinda like 

462.52 464.23 A: what was he 

463.52 473.63 B: [mn] he was you know like an investment guy like you know he started virgin airways and uh virgin megastore and but he's always been like a dabbler like he's always been a guy who 

473.69 488.37 B: you know would start ventures with like five other people and you know the other four guys like did the majority of the work [laughter] you know what i mean yeah like he wasn't really an expert in the field of the business that he opened like you know he just kinda like put all the elements together 

480.34 481.79 A: (( oh is that right [laughter] [mn] )) 

482.73 485.36 A: (( hm )) 

488.22 490.39 A: i guess he was a pretty intelligent fella 

490.14 492.48 B: i guess so i mean i know that they're 

491.59 499.75 A: all over the place now he's got i mean the airways the make uh the beauty store i don't know what else he does but i mean those are two things that aren't too uh 

494.88 495.68 B: yeah 

496.47 497.37 B: yeah 

499.97 501.50 A: too similar to each other 

501.34 513.20 B: yeah i know he just he just um it was all over the news that he'd just got into the telecommunications field like i think he bought a uh like a long distance company or something 

508.53 509.67 A: (( [mn] mm oh he )) 

513.28 519.15 B: or um or was it a cellular company he's in he's just got involved in the telecommunications industry 

519.16 520.18 B: um 

519.68 521.67 A: must have all kinds of money already 

521.61 524.37 B: yeah but you know [cough] and it's like 

524.18 534.03 B: you know money makes money it's like you know you can be the smartest guy in the world and see you know a small start up that just needs the cash and it could be like explosive 

533.84 540.52 B: but it's like if you don't have the you know the money in the bank yeah the it's like what's the point you know what i mean 

536.86 538.08 A: (( a lot of capital )) 

539.91 548.07 A: there's really none at all it's very hard to work your way up and once you're there then all the options open to you i mean it's like the very point of this conversation that we're having here 

548.15 551.79 A: is that if money wasn't an option what would you do 

550.69 551.70 B: yeah 

551.90 557.24 A: because when you got the money then your options are pretty much as far as the eye can see 

556.64 558.28 B: yeah yeah 

557.29 560.70 A: and when you don't then well that's when you gotta start small 

560.51 562.90 B: what kind of a business are there 

563.07 564.38 A: (( i'm sorry what's that )) 

563.79 566.46 B: what kind of business are you in in the oh 

566.47 569.04 A: i'm actually still a college student up here 

568.46 569.50 B: okay 

569.39 575.49 A: so uh i'm not in a business i don't really know what i'm gonna be doing after i graduate which is coming up 

571.41 572.76 B: oh okay that's cool 

574.95 578.04 B: [laughter] yeah [cough] um 

578.73 581.52 B: uh that's interesting what are you studying up there 

580.86 582.35 A: i'm an english major here 

582.40 583.82 B: (( oh okay that's cool )) 

582.64 589.19 A: i switched from uh political science [noise] i don't know exactly where that's gonna lead it's kinda open ended 

585.01 585.94 B: okay 

588.90 590.19 B: yeah 

589.65 599.89 A: and uh i suppose it lends itself to working for somebody but i don't necessarily know that i wanna do that i'm thinking about social work which is why i mentioned uh that
