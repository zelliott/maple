11.79 13.20 A: my name's david 

13.03 14.57 B: how you doing david 

14.56 16.03 A: i'm doing all right 

17.28 20.07 B: okay what was the top- what's that 

17.57 18.39 A: (( so )) 

19.02 29.29 A: the topic topic is uh opening our own business and what would we do and how would we go about it and and uh whether we think we would be good businessmen 

25.40 26.08 B: (( oh )) 

28.65 31.62 B: successful yeah okay 

32.04 35.23 B: well what kinda business would you open 

35.18 39.73 A: i i've actually thought about opening my own business i would like to open a 

39.62 43.49 A: i would like to uh build computers and sell them 

43.01 44.20 B: oh okay 

43.39 51.69 A: 'cause i already i already build my own computers basically and that's something that i've thought about because it's just really fun i 

51.15 52.01 B: uh-huh 

51.48 61.03 A: mean so that's what i'd like to do and if i could make money doing it it'd be great but as it is i want to be a computer engineer so it's basically along the same lines 

56.08 57.12 B: yeah 

60.86 63.17 B: s- pretty much yeah i'd say so 

62.94 77.91 B: well that's cool yeah i'd pretty much either open a uh [noise] i'd like to either open you know a pawn shop or a or a uh you know some some sort of like that or even one of those either that or check cashing place you know 

76.88 80.60 A: some odds and ends like general store type thing 

80.00 87.92 B: yeah yeah i don't now how successful it'd be but you know i do construction as it is right now i mean i have my own business so 

88.09 90.42 B: which is kinda cool you know it's a lot of fun 

90.86 95.36 B: keeps me on my toes but um mostly you know i think that uh 

90.89 91.96 A: that's cool 

96.22 97.39 B: you know [lipsmack] 

97.65 106.29 B: opening something like a pawn shop or something i mean you you've all you've got your you know you got your principal you know and you've also got your collateral 

106.34 107.84 B: so i mean 

107.97 114.56 B: you know and if if you and you know when you when you loan out your money the money you've always got collateral to fall back on 

114.82 118.38 B: you know so i mean i don't see how you could lose there 

119.02 120.14 B: you know what i mean 

119.33 120.75 A: yeah 

120.41 121.27 B: so 

120.86 122.08 A: yeah that's true 

122.18 123.24 A: (( you can pick up )) 

122.21 123.25 B: th- that's another 

123.53 128.92 A: pick up stuff for pretty cheap too because people coming in to a pawnshop are uh pretty desperate for money normally 

128.58 131.10 B: i guess so sometimes they are 

131.33 132.99 B: uh it's pretty funny though 

133.20 137.29 B: yeah i think that's uh that'd be a good uh good business you know and it'd 

137.77 150.40 B: be a good thing to open and uh as for being successful i don't see how they couldn't couldn't be you know it's just like you know you're you're getting like ten percent of what you know what it's worth or whatever 

150.99 154.40 B: so therefore you know you're making you know pretty much 

154.55 157.69 B: pretty good money i mean even if someone loses their 

157.89 166.50 B: loses their property and there it it seems like you could get it all back and as for computers i mean you look at it look at the age we live in 

166.71 181.28 A: yeah exactly i mean everybody's still going for computers and what i was thinking about doing actually is like uh as part of the business offering the the free technical support so as to compete with um large companies like bell and stuff like that 

167.29 168.03 B: (( so )) 

180.52 181.89 B: oh yeah [cough] 

181.89 183.63 A: because uh i mean 

183.66 193.21 A: people people especially today like a lot of people can't keep up with computers so they want somebody that'll make sure that their computer will work and if it breaks down 

193.29 195.89 A: then they want they want a guarantee 

193.59 194.40 B: (( [cough] )) 

196.02 196.94 A: so i 

196.05 197.16 B: yeah i h- 

198.67 201.88 A: i mess with my computers you know all the time so 

201.41 205.14 B: yeah [laughter] m- mine i can't keep a wrapper on it 

205.59 206.61 B: (( it's )) 

206.66 219.78 B: i really tried it but you know it's like i'm so busy all the time and i i've been running a lot of music applications and stuff and so i got to have a ram running at the same at you know 'cause it takes a lot of ram to to run it 

214.33 215.30 A: oh yeah 

219.11 220.70 A: right exactly 

220.03 222.51 B: so it's like you know i'm just like argh 

222.72 228.20 B: and um and i only have i have a small hard drive and it's not it's not working it wasn't worthy 

229.07 230.19 B: so 

229.12 230.83 A: yeah exactly 

230.19 234.61 B: yeah i'm actually gonna upgrade a hard drive and a few other things and 

234.61 248.12 B: and see what i can get going there but i do know that [laughter] yeah definitely technical support free technical support is a good thing but um that's like you know that's a major quality of course people you know they'd wanna actually 

242.03 243.61 A: exactly yeah 

248.19 262.04 B: i see this one company down here that's it's uh it uh it sells you computers that are already running you know they're like older used or whatever new and used and uh they do pretty well they got like two or three shops up in now 

257.08 258.02 A: right 

262.36 265.60 B: you know so there's obviously you know market for it 

265.86 266.82 A: right 

265.99 267.43 B: definitely 

267.56 279.45 A: yeah there's there's a lot of people that wanna nice computer that'll run but don't have the money to pay a company or that buy money to buy a brand new one you know and so yeah used computers or 

276.67 277.72 B: yeah 

279.50 284.53 A: and and i just like basically i like uh looking around for good prices and so 

284.54 294.92 A: i when i buy my own computers i get 'em for really cheap and always think man i could sell my computer right now for a lot more than i paid for it so that's why i what i thought yeah that'd be pretty cool 

291.48 292.29 B: (( hm )) 

293.68 304.77 B: that's pretty good no that's pretty good yeah ah if i can just keep mine up and running i'd be stoked [laughter] 

296.60 297.44 A: yeah 

302.34 303.43 A: yeah 

304.48 307.51 A: every once in a while i have a problem but you know it's 

307.35 310.84 B: it's that x._p. that's screwing everything up [laughter] 

310.95 314.79 A: yeah i ran x._p. for a little while and that just annoyed me 

313.12 315.29 B: (( yeah you switched back )) 

315.87 319.14 A: i switched back to windows two thousand yeah 

318.33 320.74 B: oh yeah i got windows two thousand also 

320.82 324.08 A: that's that's what i found works uh it's most stable 

324.03 329.61 B: yeah more stable than the x._p. yeah x._p.'s always crashing on something 

329.76 330.64 A: yeah 

329.87 337.75 B: so yeah i i had a problem with it like stuff and like you know i had things running smooth then all of a sudden it just 

338.20 339.57 B: ark it dumped 

339.65 344.23 B: and i'd be right in the middle of doing something i needed to do [laughter] it's like suckey 

344.36 345.66 B: (( i'm uh you know )) 

345.71 355.91 B: yeah technical support is definitely a a positive on that one and uh hm that's cool you think i think you'd be pretty successful uh you know 

355.85 364.95 A: yeah th- well i don't i wouldn't plan on making a a huge business out of it just because i i don't see myself ever 

365.13 369.93 A: i mean i've i've looked at doing businesses and there's just so much involved 

370.40 372.66 B: oh yeah buying 

371.33 379.94 A: so i don't know if i don't know if i could take care of all the aspects of a business but as far as like just me running my own deal i i definitely think that 

379.99 382.77 A: it'd it'd be nice prob- prob- 

381.60 387.03 B: like a mogul like a mogul uh mogul uh computer repair 

383.10 384.01 A: yeah 

387.18 388.54 A: yeah no- 

387.67 391.75 B: or technical support or something not technical support but mogul uh 

391.78 397.33 B: see i see n- i seen this one the other day that says mogul uh mogul computers you know we come to you you 

397.55 400.28 B: know which is kinda cool computer repair 

397.94 398.79 A: (( yeah )) 

400.32 403.13 A: yeah yeah that's definitely cool 

401.56 403.44 B: which is kinda cool you know 

403.26 411.83 A: that's a great idea too 'cause uh for a company because people are always hassled by having to bring their computer in to some place to get it fixed 

410.63 411.53 B: yeah 

411.69 417.56 B: yeah take tear it down bring it over and uh yeah that's a lot of work [laughter] 

415.91 417.44 A: (( exactly )) 

417.45 419.36 A: yeah that's a great idea 

418.77 425.05 B: i i've had to do that a few times myself [laughter] i know the feeling it's not too fun 

424.92 429.03 A: yeah yeah that's not good at all it's a lot more convenient if you could just 

428.74 430.39 B: sure sure 

429.22 433.42 A: have an appointment and somebody'll come over that's a good idea too yeah 

432.86 446.98 B: yeah it sure is yeah if you g- if you get enough people that you know that are needing that either that or you set up their new computer or you know there's all kind of people that are lazy too lazy to you know set their stuff up you know and so you charge you know 

447.21 450.82 B: a hundred dollars a house call you know that's just initially 

450.90 453.56 B: and then whatever else goes on there you know 

453.74 460.65 B: i mean i was looking at uh i was looking at a shop the other day when i was in there and they wanted thirty bucks to install a video card 

460.66 464.42 B: i was like [laughter] thirty bucks 

462.21 470.61 A: yeah you you you un- you open the case you undo one screw you put the card on you redo the screw close the case that's it 

470.10 472.25 B: (( [laughter] i exactly the )) 

471.35 474.76 A: oh well pop a c._d. in you know 

474.16 477.76 B: sure yeah but then then it runs itself pretty much 

476.92 478.51 A: exactly 

477.79 483.78 B: mm looks really simple [laughter] and that's a good that's a quick way to make thirty bucks i mean that's sweet 

480.15 481.10 A: man 

483.15 486.64 A: sure is i can i'd do that in i could do that in five minutes 

486.30 494.35 B: yeah yeah i'm sure i could too just that's amazing you know i'm sure he's making lots of money 'cause people just go argh 

494.43 502.32 B: i don't wanna do it you know they either don't know how or they just or they don't wanna mess with it because they don't have the you know wrist strap or whatever 

502.09 503.41 A: yeah 

502.86 504.67 B: well pretty simple 

503.72 508.20 A: for for a while i was afraid to mess with my computer like i bought one 

508.28 518.86 A: you know and i bought one and had it assembled in the store but it was free actually and then so i just and then i just started messing with it and uh once i
