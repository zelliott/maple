96.96 110.75 A: i don't know but uh i guess there are a lot of opportunities out there i mean sometimes i i start like thinking like like well this would be a good idea for a business or stuff like that but i don't know it's 

110.91 117.81 A: it's just the sake of having to say it and plan and all the stuff that i i'm not into it 

117.44 130.50 B: well if you're in a think tank you can certainly think of good ideas [laughter] at least that's what i think [laughter] so what do you think about in the think tank

125.51 127.36 A: [laughter] 

130.30 133.65 A: well i it's a libertarian think tank

143.61 145.49 B: oh okay 

144.37 145.27 A: yeah 

145.37 152.70 A: but uh but what kind of business if you could you could start a a new business what what would you do right now i mean 

152.49 153.77 B: (( oh )) 

154.17 160.02 B: [sigh] i guess uh a good uh business to start now would be um 

160.07 162.34 B: employment agency 

161.91 163.64 A: employment agency 

163.13 164.25 B: uh-huh 

163.84 170.00 A: but with with the economy this down and empl- unemployment rate going up you think that's 

169.83 174.43 B: well i think that's where connections come into play 

173.95 175.04 A: yeah 

174.46 186.39 B: uh those people you know and those people who know other people and uh you're sort of uh like a think tank you put together all these different um 

182.98 183.79 A: yeah 

186.61 201.54 B: ah ideas or heads of ah corporations or whatever you you come across you come across a lot of interesting people who have good ideas and some of them are very good with people 

201.57 208.10 B: now if you have people who are good with other people uh they can um 

208.11 218.24 B: think up jobs uh find lacks that are in a particular organization and a way to fill it 

217.84 221.65 A: mhm mhm and do you think the the one can manage that kind of 

221.51 233.32 A: job bank you know very like entrepreneurial way without being involved with the people or looking for jobs i mean seen it as a social service kind of you know 

232.47 233.71 B: oh sure 

233.63 246.47 A: because well you may probably you can you may get involved with people like with with a desperation because are not finding a job and they have a family to take care of and you can get your your feelings involved 

246.75 248.60 A: what do you think of that 

248.05 256.97 B: well i always was in jobs where i got my feelings involved [laughter] but but that's a part of um relationships 

251.62 253.94 A: [laughter] yeah mhm 

256.49 257.65 A: mhm 

257.03 258.64 B: and um 

259.07 264.80 B: maybe that's because i'm more of a that kind of outgoing person 

265.48 272.49 B: uh but i think it would be wonderful to be able to place people so that uh 

272.83 286.71 B: because there is a lot of work out there but people who have businesses sometimes they don't sense the need or the opening for opening up new um [lipsmack] adventures 

274.95 275.93 A: yeah 

286.39 287.33 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

286.87 299.92 B: let's say they make uh carpenters and they make tables well they may be afraid to enlarge on it but yet if they found that they got a great cabinet maker for some of like those 

299.84 307.67 B: big hideous t._v. sets [laughter] to disguise them so that they would be um 

307.70 317.55 B: uh blend in with the decor there's just there's just so much the whole idea of business is uh to find a need and fill it 

317.48 318.89 A: mhm 

318.46 327.92 B: and uh i think if you the more people that you have um that you work with with ideas you can really find um 

319.97 321.18 A: (( yeah mhm mhm )) 

327.98 334.23 B: [lipsmack] ah you know the need and even find the people who don't even realize they have a need 

334.29 336.12 B: that's the whole idea 

336.34 342.40 B: to get these things started what were you thinking of as um new entrepreneurial 

342.75 346.03 A: well i i i have 

346.07 356.75 A: i mean i have no idea what kinda business i will start probably i will start like an irish pub or something like that but yeah [laughter] 

353.78 355.36 B: really 

355.62 357.51 B: [laughter] 

357.63 360.82 A: i don't know i'm from costa rica and uh 

360.86 370.76 A: there is no irish pubs in costa rica so i see like there is like a lack of of one and probably that would be a nice idea but well a- 

370.55 381.64 A: according to this study the the the money's not an issue so i guess that we i co- i could invest in that but i don't know i you will need you will need to hire someone 

381.87 382.93 A: to 

383.34 395.34 A: to make marketing for you and to get the word out that you you have that business and i don't know i just don't l- don't like the risk of 

394.47 395.48 B: uh-huh 

395.24 409.31 A: of of you know like well this month was really good but next one is going to bed down and and next month i don't know how much money i will get and i still have to pay for the waiters and stuff like that so 

409.59 413.43 A: it definitely definitely i'm not into into 

413.46 419.25 A: into starting businesses unless unless i'm so comfortable i mean financially 

419.44 424.22 A: that i don't care if just reeking money and don't care losing it you know 

424.65 426.10 B: well [sigh] 

425.27 430.80 A: what do you think [laughter] i sound very [laughter] pessimistic view of the world 

426.50 428.01 B: [laughter] 

431.02 436.21 A: people don't think like me because this world will will be stagnated totally [laughter] 

435.37 438.21 B: [laughter] 

437.27 442.45 A: nobody will invest the dow jones will be like like it was in the seventeen 

438.38 439.19 B: [laughter] 

441.60 456.00 B: [laughter] i don't think it was around that long but [laughter] maybe eighteen something [laughter] but but what you said was so interesting about uh 

442.65 444.21 A: ninety four i guess 

446.59 449.34 A: [laughter] 

450.34 452.12 A: yeah yeah [laughter] 

456.02 460.55 B: a an irish pub in costa rica [laughter] 

458.56 459.55 A: yeah 

459.64 467.11 A: i mean we we you know that costa rica has the second highest rate of consumption of beer per capita in the world after germany 

466.92 469.71 B: i what happened to america [laughter] 

468.82 471.34 A: well [laughter] believe it or no we were first 

470.78 473.36 B: really [laughter] 

471.48 473.99 A: per capita and uh 

474.02 487.93 A: and uh well there's there's no irish pubs and i i remember all my friends from abroad when they come and visit me they constantly telling me where where where's the irish pub and i said we have none they said well you sh- you should have one 

487.78 491.16 B: for goodness sakes and that would be a great idea 

490.25 497.15 A: yeah and so if you had an irish pub you would have like tourists going to irish pubs there and 

495.72 496.86 B: right 

497.22 507.84 A: some costa ricans would like to to have like st patrick's and all this stuff and others keep for drinking they already have several but [laughter] well there you go well that 

504.19 506.31 B: (( well that's a good idea )) 

507.06 509.36 B: so i i like that 

509.01 512.08 A: and a bowling i would also love to have a bowling 

511.88 514.48 B: bowling in costa rica too

526.14 527.18 B: uh-huh 

526.79 538.58 A: and it would be fun i mean it would be because it would be like a pastime if if this study is like about investing and starting a business i would definitely have a business and i would definitely start a business 

538.65 546.66 A: only if it is a pastime and if i have another source of income that will ensure me to sustain my family and myself 

546.48 548.22 B: that sounds great 

547.81 548.99 A: yeah so

584.90 595.06 B: then ship it back to ireland and then put on their made in ireland labels and ship it back to america to sell [laughter] 

593.71 596.13 A: oh that's how this country started you know
