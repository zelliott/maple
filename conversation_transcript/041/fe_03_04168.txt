33.06 36.94 A: yeah it's got to be some work put into it but uh 

37.32 42.39 A: you set your sights on the rewards afterwards 

39.82 44.05 B: (( yeah right )) 

43.14 48.03 A: yeah and the reward depending on the type of business could be really great 

48.34 51.48 B: uh but so are the risks right 

51.14 56.29 A: yeah well there's going to be risk in everything there's a risk in life itself 

53.51 57.87 B: [laughter] yeah that's true 

56.75 61.88 A: ye- yeah you said you're walking down the street god forbid something could happen to you 

61.75 62.98 B: [laughter] that's true 

62.83 65.27 A: yeah so uh 

65.30 71.64 A: i myself or i always envisaged me opening up a business i'm tired of working for someone else 

71.25 75.47 B: [laughter] what kind of uh business would you want to open 

76.03 78.11 A: card and gift shop 

77.97 79.81 B: really 

78.84 79.92 A: (( oh yes son )) 

80.06 81.40 B: that'd be kinda fun 

81.25 86.44 A: oh yeah and then like with mother's d- day just being yesterday although 

85.89 87.71 B: right 

87.14 91.29 A: uh they always make cards for everything and anything 

91.11 92.30 B: that's true 

92.39 97.55 A: even if it's just to send a card to someone that says hi just thinking about you 

97.66 99.49 B: yeah 

98.45 106.66 A: yeah and then with the gifts that go along with it to sell and um you know even have a section for wrapping gifts 

106.80 108.11 B: right 

107.58 114.80 A: 'cause if you're like me you really don't like wrapping gifts when it comes to uh you know to christmas during that time 

109.73 111.42 B: [laughter] 

114.61 118.66 B: right or you're like me and you're just really bad at wrapping presents 

115.57 116.43 A: (( so )) 

118.46 120.32 A: uh there you go 

119.81 126.45 B: [laughter] would would your gift shop be like special in any way or would it just be sort of the standard 

126.33 129.98 A: (( pr- uh it wouldn't be anything exotic )) 

129.78 131.63 B: yeah 

130.06 133.22 A: but yeah but uh hm 

133.80 138.60 A: the type of uh gift shop it would be ooh i'd say 

138.64 142.87 A: sell a little bit of let's say some home furnishings 

142.97 143.88 B: (( uh-huh )) 

143.37 149.09 A: uh yeah some you know decorative uh items of that nature 

150.24 158.68 A: yeah so this way i would uh pretty much have the entire spectrum covered and if i didn't have it well then i'd order it from somewhere 

152.77 154.49 B: (( right )) 

157.61 159.92 B: [laughter] yeah 

159.32 168.20 A: yeah give people satisfaction that's why word of mouth advertising goes a long way and so does uh repeat customers 

162.74 166.11 B: [noise] that's true 

168.56 172.89 B: well do you wanna open it up in like a city or a small town or 

172.17 174.53 A: (( mm a city )) 

174.49 176.21 B: yeah 

174.54 178.18 A: or e- e- yeah even a small town wouldn't hurt 

178.33 179.55 B: me 

179.31 181.47 A: uh yeah how 'bout you 

180.18 183.41 B: i i love cities um 

183.50 185.73 B: i don't know what i'd open um 

186.06 196.36 B: really i was gonna say i'd probably start a business making something but how you've got me thinking that it might be fun to uh run some sort of place where you get to meet people in a bar or something like that 

195.34 196.57 A: (( ah )) 

196.55 198.52 B: um actually have 

198.75 202.71 B: sort of friends of friends who set up a bar and they had a great time doing that so 

202.22 203.14 A: (( mhm )) 

203.16 204.87 B: seems like that'd be kinda cool 

204.69 206.39 A: mm okay 

206.59 210.26 B: but uh i learned software development by trade so 

210.28 215.75 B: most of my ideas tend to revolve around some sort of you know software that you can make 

214.24 214.80 A: (( mm )) 

215.89 216.98 B: but uh 

217.35 220.59 B: that's kind of a [laughter] stressful line of work i think 

220.11 221.73 A: yeah really it is 

221.55 225.34 B: well it's kinda hard to break into software development i think more than 

225.53 234.66 B: something where you have like a very clearly differentiated products or like something concrete you can sell that has you know real lasting value 

225.75 226.54 A: (( mhm )) 

236.14 237.23 B: but uh 

238.03 245.36 B: i don't know i still think it's [laughter] kinda stressful i've you know i've worked with a few friends when they've been trying to start things and [lipsmack] 

245.71 250.59 B: you know just because of random circumstances like you know lack of funding and whatever 

250.53 251.67 A: (( mhm right )) 

250.84 258.74 B: it all kind of falls apart you know even though they had you know a great idea and they worked really hard that's always kinda rough 

258.59 259.47 A: (( mm )) 

260.11 264.63 B: and you also sort of have just like less general security or you don't have 

264.76 267.36 B: you know benefits and you don't have 

267.87 272.58 B: you know expense account and you have the benefit of other people overseeing what you're doing 

270.37 271.50 A: mhm 

273.11 282.08 A: mhm anything else on doing you said i'm sorry what did you say that last word you said or the last statement 

276.52 277.37 B: huh 

281.82 283.06 B: um 

283.13 284.97 B: (( [laughter] i don't even know do ))

379.63 380.69 B: (( no no i )) 

381.01 387.89 A: uh i was gonna say then i don't mind making somebody else rich 'cause i'll be getting rich also 

387.02 391.96 B: [laughter] everyone benefits in broadcasting 

391.11 393.32 A: oh yeah most assuredly 

393.18 396.82 B: [laughter] what kind of broadcasting like radio or t._v. or 

396.84 401.37 A: um no not t._v. news i wouldn't mind doing 

401.39 404.47 A: uh documentaries voice work 

404.59 405.93 B: yeah

409.23 410.09 B: uh-huh 

409.95 416.82 A: so and um seeing as like now at bays you have all the stars wanting to do 

416.94 419.55 A: um cartoons and feature 

419.85 421.99 A: animated features so 

422.30 425.29 A: why not have my voice in there to do that too 

425.23 427.08 B: yeah 

426.63 441.16 A: i could stand to have turning on the t._v. and hearing my voice come from the um what channel is that oh history channel or uh learning channel and uh yeah that's something i would enjoy doing 

436.51 438.50 B: right 

441.06 444.06 B: do you know if it's a hard line of work to get into or 

443.93 448.50 A: well kind of sorta it it does involve 

448.88 450.19 A: who you know 

450.32 452.05 B: yeah 

451.04 462.20 A: so as l- and you make sure you don't burn any bridges when you're uh after you've met somebody 'cause you never know you might need 'em somewhere or 

460.80 462.79 B: (( [laughter] )) 

462.77 465.35 A: or they know somebody somewhere 

465.55 468.47 B: right that's definitely true 

466.45 467.83 A: yeah so 

468.26 469.98 A: oh yeah so 

470.09 474.44 A: you don't wanna be black balled in broadcasting by any means 

473.11 476.82 B: [laughter] it's a very close club i have a 

476.58 490.23 B: a friend who worked at a._b._c. news and he said that you know all the broadcasters that you think are competitive go hang out together you know in the hamptons on the weekends you know like tom brokaw hobnobbing with peter peter jennings and you know 

483.60 484.48 A: (( mhm )) 

485.14 486.24 A: right 

488.57 489.83 A: right 

491.83 497.65 A: r- i can understand that especially when they're uh you know presidential conventions 

497.72 508.54 A: and uh you know then they're all in one place together so perhaps even they share information which uh i wouldn't be surprised that they might do 

508.60 510.58 B: yeah 

509.46 515.47 A: and uh probably even well how much are you making on your current contract tom 

515.28 519.88 B: [laughter] right it's important information to have 

518.83 520.57 A: absolutely 

520.21 522.04 B: yeah 

521.03 530.50 A: so then tom can go back to the network and tell them well look i need another half million or so i wanna make sure the kids are taken care of 

530.01 531.89 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

530.85 535.46 A: [laughter] but i like if somebody's gonna pay you why not 

534.65 542.70 B: yeah it's pretty amazing what they get paid just to sort of sit there and [laughter] read the page more or less 

540.89 541.94 A: that's just 

542.02 543.67 A: yeah that's true 

543.36 545.21 B: yeah 

544.06 554.88 A: uh some are quarter of a million even uh broker those guys like that well i'm quite sure they're making either one or a couple a million a year 

554.84 556.32 B: right 

555.58 557.64 A: yeah so 

558.09 562.04 A: i don't know if i'll be as good as those guys but 

562.05 565.82 A: even i'll take a quarter million a year 

565.72 569.84 B: [laughter] right yeah that is plenty that's true 

565.83 567.55 A: i could live a lot better 

568.55 570.19 A: (( oh yeah )) 

570.39 576.21 A: i could definitely live a lot better than that better than what i'm doing now w- with a quarter of a million 

574.34 577.96 B: [laughter] yeah 

576.88 577.84 A: (( yeah uh )) 

579.10 582.06 B: are you getting like the civilian insurance right now or are you 

581.96 584.34 A: yeah i am um 

584.41 586.24 A: it makes things a little 

586.08 599.95 A: difficult sometimes because it's not the full amount that i was getting when i was working and um but i have to juggle things and make ends meet as best i can but um 

587.84 589.58 B: right 

592.97 593.99 B: right
