84.98 87.15 B: yeah [laughter] i'm pretty sure it will 

86.29 90.26 A: [laughter] too many american [laughter] american places already anyway 

88.48 89.06 B: (( hm ))

110.95 111.97 B: (( [laughter] ))

113.52 114.97 B: oh my goodness 

113.99 119.08 A: but i'd wanna put cameras up around my place that way i could monitor the employees all the time

121.96 122.90 A: wow 

122.11 124.05 B: (( because um [cough] [lipsmack] ))

129.55 130.66 A: right 

130.03 133.47 B: so that is definitely a you know a great idea 

133.72 137.37 B: get in a security system for the entire restaurant 

137.92 141.15 B: (( so then you can see everything and hear everything )) 

137.92 138.98 A: wow 

140.94 142.00 A: (( right [noise] )) 

141.46 143.55 B: but but yes um 

143.64 151.63 B: well they said how we will go about it well if i had the money i n- i [noise] get a nice little location for it 

151.68 154.64 B: a place that you know that is the people 

155.04 158.29 B: that it i mean that has a lot of traffic of people 

157.94 158.79 A: (( uh-huh )) 

159.56 161.56 B: (( a place where it can be seen )) 

161.85 162.86 B: i don't know 

163.46 168.86 B: i just i mean i've been having the idea for the longest time i just don't have the money to do it [noise] 

168.17 169.90 A: [laughter] th- that's me 

169.78 170.99 B: yeah 

169.91 170.87 A: (( that's me )) 

171.06 174.74 A: i talked about ab- about a video club there for a long time but [noise] 

174.92 176.08 A: that's just not 

176.25 177.53 B: a video what 

177.03 178.71 A: [mn] a video rental club 

178.96 180.33 B: oh okay 

179.61 181.71 A: but people just don't rent movies anymore 

181.71 183.71 B: yeah well 

183.20 184.80 A: i mean around here they don't 

183.90 189.79 B: i really i mean if you i mean over here blockbusters are a huge hit 

190.85 191.83 B: you know 

190.90 193.02 A: right yeah 

192.89 195.66 B: so it depends really i mean [sigh] 

196.55 200.72 B: it's like you have to have a big variety of movies and stuff 

200.40 201.64 A: right 

200.95 207.76 B: and that's you know there's plus you have to have the the permission of people to show their movies and stuff 

207.13 208.29 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

208.41 210.93 B: so the licenses and all that stuff first 

210.70 213.41 A: i think all of 'em but two has closed around here 

213.45 214.56 B: i'm sorry 

214.23 218.24 A: they they open up and they'll sit for a a couple of months and then they'll just close 

218.41 219.71 B: yeah 

219.10 221.86 A: so that tells me it's it's a lot harder 

221.48 222.52 B: yes 

221.90 224.28 A: than what it should i mean what it should be i think 

225.52 228.59 A: people just don't watch their backs when they go into something like that 

225.64 226.45 B: i didn't 

228.56 229.50 B: (( mm yeah )) 

229.45 230.34 A: you know 

230.21 235.35 B: yeah and it's hard to beat the bigger companies like do you guys have blockbusters down there as well 

235.04 236.32 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

235.80 241.54 B: yeah you know they they got more business and you know they advertise and all that stuff so 

241.62 245.09 B: [mn] it's like the little man is usually squash 

245.63 247.60 B: [laughter] by them you know 

247.42 248.43 A: (( right [noise] )) 

247.98 251.42 B: [noise] it's like you have to i mean you have to be very lucky 

251.46 257.93 B: or not have any of them nearby to to you know to be able to make a profit hm 

259.29 260.06 A: (( wow ))
