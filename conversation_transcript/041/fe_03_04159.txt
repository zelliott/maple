5.49 6.47 B: good

8.91 10.89 A: yes sounds like it 

10.69 13.40 B: uh all right i'll give you mine 

13.65 15.70 B: i'd open a bait and tackle store 

15.96 17.68 A: a bait and tackle store 

17.45 20.05 B: a bait and tackle store in the florida keys 

20.17 21.49 A: where do you live 

21.72 26.47 B: uh i'm in boston right now but i grew up i grew up in uh miami so 

23.56 24.49 A: oh you are 

26.76 29.85 A: so what you'll be selling stuff for deep deep sea fishing or 

29.85 32.86 B: deep sea fishing rigs running uh 

32.90 35.48 B: some maybe some water sports out a the back 

35.74 41.14 B: uh and a guide service i got a couple of buddies to run guide service out a the back 

41.69 45.25 A: yes i can see that being something 

45.58 48.73 B: something easy to get up for easy to do 

48.98 52.11 B: and fairly successful as long as you know the area 

52.11 54.34 A: yeah i'd imagine it would be 

54.42 57.74 B: yeah where are you going with yours 

56.12 57.78 A: (( um i )) 

57.99 60.24 A: don't know man i'd [lipsmack] as 

61.67 68.07 A: i say i thought about it i'd probably do a hockey hockey shop i'm big into hockey so i'd probably do uh 

68.91 75.27 A: something dealing with that so i could uh i could have all the equipment i wanted think that'd be pretty cool 

73.60 74.46 B: yeah 

75.66 76.81 A: and maybe do 

75.68 77.46 B: where're you at right now 

77.40 78.66 A: i'm in colorado 

78.73 80.46 B: ah so you'd do it out there 

80.57 84.29 A: yeah i think it would be a good area to do it out here there's a couple a good shops but uh 

84.30 89.68 A: yeah actually i'd probably if i had my brothers i'd probably move up to vancouver and do it 

89.88 90.93 A: that's where 

90.29 91.00 B: why 

91.19 92.24 B: why's that 

92.35 99.99 A: because there's a much better better skill level hockey up there you can play against guys that really know what they're doing and you could have uh 

98.57 99.57 B: yeah 

100.45 104.34 A: you know you could you probably have a lot more customers up there than you would down here 

104.19 105.14 B: yeah 

104.41 107.34 A: 'cause it's kind of their official pastime you know 

107.74 114.94 B: yeah i mean i don't know if we're just to think like rent cost and all that kind of stuff also but 

114.35 119.22 A: well they've kind of said money's not an option so if you could just do whatever you wanted pretty much 

116.83 118.25 B: (( oh money's not an option )) 

119.16 123.37 B: yeah well then i guess we both just went to our hobbies for something 

122.71 124.24 A: (( [laughter] yeah exactly )) 

123.44 124.77 B: (( to do [laughter] )) 

124.81 126.87 A: well you gotta like what you're doing you know 

126.72 129.48 B: exactly if money ain't an option things'd be easy 

129.93 130.69 B: (( but )) 

130.01 131.45 A: yeah 

131.22 132.19 B: uh 

132.82 134.55 B: yeah what else can we say about it 

136.31 144.99 A: yeah i mean well i think it would be you know for a guiding service you know the well you'd be getting paid just to go fishing pretty much you know and that would be 

144.99 146.01 B: oh yeah 

145.26 147.95 A: that would be like the ideal situation and 

147.80 153.89 B: yeah you run three guys i mean you know three trips a day maybe or two trips four hours a piece 

153.95 156.19 B: and get paid four or five hundred a piece 

156.62 157.52 B: (( so [mn] )) 

157.79 162.39 B: the money's there if you can get the people it's see with the internet so 

157.88 159.58 A: getting paid for fishing 

161.68 162.58 A: yeah 

162.90 165.57 B: i mean right now i do internet marketing is what i do 

165.61 166.62 A: oh you do 

166.04 171.51 B: so so i mean i always thought about stuff like that as long as you can get on the internet you get people all over the country 

171.67 175.59 B: phoning up and stuff and then you ain't gotta worry about the yellow pages anymore 

171.74 173.20 A: yeah exactly 

175.66 179.00 A: the competition'd probably be pretty stiff down there i i'd imagine 

178.99 182.64 B: absolutely that's the one big huge problem [laughter] 

181.84 184.61 A: there'd there'd be a hundred other people doing it so 

184.29 185.85 B: absolutely 

185.97 190.37 B: so what would you do you'd do hockey equipment and any what else 

190.18 193.89 A: yeah probably just probably mostly goalie stuff like have a goalie 

193.90 196.04 A: just all goalie store 

195.89 196.69 B: yep 

196.76 202.01 A: and it'd be all goalie gear uh i mean i could probably do coaching too coaching for 

202.02 207.20 A: for uh younger guys and you know that would be that'd probably be a lot of fun 

204.42 205.49 B: yeah 

207.40 209.17 B: yeah 

208.63 212.96 A: or just run run tournaments and clinics and stuff 

213.19 215.63 B: yep and like seasons and stuff 

215.79 218.43 A: yeah yeah i think it'd be 

218.65 222.29 A: that'd be my ideal thing to get paid for playing hockey somehow 

223.32 230.04 B: i mean there ah they said open up a business like i'm trying to think well here coming up with your number two i'll get my number two are 

230.29 239.02 A: uh my number two well let's see if money was an option i mean this was something i was thinking about is have you do you guys have any like uh 

239.60 244.90 A: we have this place out here called supotelay or baja fresh or any of that stuff you ever heard of these places 

244.77 246.84 B: they just like a burrito place or something 

246.17 249.44 A: yeah they sell like big old burritos 

249.26 250.12 B: yep 

249.55 251.98 A: and they then they come like right in front of you 

252.03 256.10 B: all right yeah yeah we have similar chains out here like but 

255.56 257.33 A: like keydover or something 

257.38 258.26 A: (( sounds like a )) 

257.40 262.01 B: uh yeah they call 'em different things out here but i don't think they're big chains but 

261.98 266.51 A: but uh they have this one this one store here in town 

266.39 279.10 A: and and they they expanded they probably got fifty stores now and they're like half owned by mcdonalds and they're like every every place one of these everywhere where these places open they do like mega business 

266.60 267.39 B: (( yep )) 

278.74 279.88 B: yeah yeah 

279.31 293.74 A: and we went and visited this uh boise idaho it's kind of a small town it it looks like a college town it's not it's um uh they've got plenty of people but uh and they haven't got anything like it so we figured we'd move in there go right next to campus put one of those in 

290.25 291.10 B: yeah 

294.00 297.20 A: and think you could make a bank doing that 

296.65 299.43 B: yeah yeah that's i 

298.30 299.15 A: (( so anyone )) 

299.79 309.31 B: i'm thinking i got one along the same lines this ain't my idea it's a buddy who tells me is there's one hardware store in all of uh i think it's nantucket island or it's martha's vineyard one of those two 

309.15 310.05 A: uh-huh 

309.43 316.02 B: and there's there's one hardware store you know when you got all the rich folks out there building homes left and right with different contractors 

314.12 316.26 A: yeah so you can go out there 

316.79 318.07 B: so that's one 

317.03 323.58 A: you gotta have you gotta have a lot of money to put into that though you gotta carry you gotta have a ton of stock at a hardware store 

321.77 322.63 B: (( oh yeah )) 

323.52 336.89 B: absolutely well here i'll give you one that we talked about this weekend i got a buddy that's uh uh you know a football player and he makes all kinds of money so uh he he said he'll take all our high school buddies and do a raw bar like a oyster bar 

324.72 325.38 A: see 

336.81 337.76 A: uh-huh 

337.61 346.21 B: and uh you know there's a couple you know boston's big with seafood and everything but there's not not all that many worth you got like a raw bar sitting in front of you with uh 

346.34 351.66 B: trenches inside the bar where you throw the you know dozen oysters on ice and that kinda stuff 

351.58 353.82 A: wow that'll be interesting 

353.30 356.53 B: same kinda idea there ain't that many around 

356.32 361.55 A: yeah they say like what is it like ninety percent of restaurants fail [laughter] 

360.48 361.81 B: oh right yeah 

362.03 368.53 B: oh yeah that's yeah that's that's a huge failure all we got there is the money but you're right they're all gonna fail 

366.96 368.28 A: yeah 

368.64 382.57 A: it's yeah it's tough man it's i've known with like probably the best mexican restaurant in town here was around since like nineteen sixty five and it just closed last year and it was such a bummer 'cause you know they lost their client base and 

379.40 381.09 B: yeah 

382.76 386.94 B: well actually i walk past one every single day i walk to work and uh 

386.88 400.32 B: it's it's called the and it's all over boston and uh i g- guarantee you at five six o'clock there's you know a line twenty or thirty people deep and it's you know it's a young town so it's all college kids and everyone goes there for lunch and dinner 

400.03 407.70 A: yeah if you can i mean if you can get like something that that catches on you can you can do really well but if it doesn't you're in trouble 

405.57 406.33 B: (( yeah )) 

407.56 413.33 B: yeah i'm sure probably there's eighteen of those same places around the area that've gone under 

413.36 423.60 A: yeah exactly yeah i mean we've got buildings around here where it's like it's been like ten different stores ten different restaurants you know in like the last twenty years and they always go out so 

422.03 422.97 B: (( yeah )) 

423.90 429.71 B: yeah especially i mean i don't know if you're around colleges that's seems like college around colleges things go up and down 

424.29 425.15 A: (( it's )) 

429.79 438.33 A: yeah but yeah if you can catch on with college kids man you can you can do really well we've got a place out here by d._u. the denver university that's uh 

433.40 434.23 B: yeah 

438.32 450.64 A: it's like this the jerusalem it's middle eastern foods with like hero sandwiches and stuff like that and they sell 'em uh they they're open 'til like three in the morning every day and they're open twenty four hours on the weekends 

444.13 444.96 B: yeah 

450.58 457.19 A: and so college kids you know come back from their frat parties they'll stop and eat there and they got people in there all hours of the night so 

456.59 458.51 B: (( yep )) 

457.52 460.68 A: you just gotta get some kind of some kind of shtick like that [mn] 

461.08 462.51 B: yeah or any 

462.72 472.68 B: any of those late night places i don't know about the alcohol laws out there but either you can also get if they got places out here that serve breakfast you know it's like bar that serves breakfast it's gonna be alcohol cuts off 

472.60 475.01 A: oh really wh- 

473.55 475.66 B: i mean those those do real well 

475.44 478.57 A: last last call out here is like two o'clock 

478.29 482.80 B: yeah i mean actually i think it's pretty i mean it's one or two around here but most of 'em are two o'clock 

482.62 486.21 A: yeah so it's like eating breakfast at two that'd be interesting [laughter] 

485.14 485.96 B: yeah 

486.46 495.10 B: it's kind of a weird thing and i've actually never done it i only hear about it but they say you know they say the the crowd actually gets bigger at breakfast because everyone comes from all the different bars 

494.89 496.25 A: really 

496.03 497.39 B: you know you're already 

496.39 497.29 A: because of 

498.61 502.20 A: so instead of kicking you out they they start serving up food 

502.06 503.97 B: yeah it's not a bad idea 

503.94 505.99 A: (( yeah it is pretty good )) 

505.34 506.20 B: (( yeah )) 

506.88 508.19 B: (( uh yeah )) 

507.27 514.78 A: yeah so you just gotta come up with a good idea and it's and work hard man it's like my my uh parents started a business 

514.69 515.51 B: (( yeah )) 

514.97 523.19 A: and uh i mean it's just like you know you're working fourteen hours a day as long as the store is open you know you're there at least for the first few years you know 

521.23 522.57 B: oh yeah 

523.58 528.48 B: yeah every bit of profit's your personal income so you gotta bust your balls to make a little money 

528.36 533.00 A: yeah yeah they worked worked themselves to death pretty much i mean 

532.64 533.83 B: mhm 

533.22 536.96 A: they're doing real well now but but it took a long time to pay off 

537.26 541.62 B: well the kicker of this whole question is without without money being a concern so 

541.14 544.10 A: yeah yeah you can do whatever the heck you wanted man 

541.93 543.08 B: (( [laughter] )) 

544.07 545.86 B: (( yeah )) 

546.26 546.82 B: (( [mn] ))
