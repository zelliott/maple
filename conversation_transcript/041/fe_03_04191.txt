0.00 1.32 A: meredith 

1.12 2.53 B: [lipsmack] hi wanwa 

2.65 3.71 A: i'm sorry 

3.70 4.59 B: wanwa 

4.60 5.60 A: wanwa 

5.42 6.21 B: uh-huh 

6.31 7.24 A: okay 

7.37 9.34 A: um well nice to meet you 

9.39 10.45 B: (( [lipsmack] [lipsmack] you too )) 

10.85 14.37 A: so if you could start your own business what would you do 

15.29 19.60 B: [lipsmack] um i think that i would probably start a restaurant 

19.69 20.87 A: (( okay [mn] )) 

20.24 27.60 B: [noise] but i would wanna make it a very small scale restaurant because i don't really like having to cook like in large quantities but um 

26.22 27.24 A: okay 

27.79 33.55 B: like something pretty where i could just go to the market and pick up you know whatever looked good and go and cook it [lipsmack] 

34.40 36.80 A: what sorta food would you want to cook 

37.56 38.68 B: um 

39.06 42.38 B: oh i don't know just whatever i felt like cooking i guess [noise] 

42.61 43.96 A: okay 

43.16 47.43 B: probably i- italian style cooking for the most part 

47.55 49.19 A: (( okay [laughter] )) 

48.34 50.00 B: [laughter] 

49.24 51.82 A: well you know it's the sort of thing that [sigh] 

51.83 59.41 A: people would probably need to know um before they would decide to come have dinner at the restaurant 

59.37 61.99 B: [lipsmack] yeah i mean i was thinking something more like just 

62.11 69.49 B: general california cuisine [noise] like um i'm in berkley and you know it's like the home of japanese and 

64.85 65.78 A: uh-huh 

68.87 70.19 A: right 

69.60 72.61 B: um that kind of cooking so um 

71.26 72.21 A: uh-huh 

72.69 84.37 B: you know something like that sounds like it would be really fun or you just have like certain things like just a few things that you make every day and it's just basically to showcase the freshness of your produce and you know you make really simple good food [noise] 

75.05 75.98 A: okay 

78.56 79.53 A: okay 

84.80 85.85 A: okay 

86.45 87.54 B: what about you [noise] 

86.50 89.71 A: well it's a fun idea um 

88.84 89.40 B: (( [noise] )) 

90.64 92.27 A: (( i would )) 

94.47 95.93 A: i don't 

94.62 95.22 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

96.51 100.64 A: even know at the moment because it's something that it's 

101.28 106.25 A: an idea that i played with for several years and 

106.39 108.59 A: fantasized about doing 

109.93 113.81 A: but [sigh] you know once the economy 

114.09 119.32 A: fell apart um i didn't see the use anymore but 

119.79 122.61 A: the business would have been 

123.07 124.23 A: um 

124.28 134.83 A: consulting with small to mid sized companies to advise them on strategic philanthropy initiatives um 

136.20 138.23 A: you know why to 

138.33 141.31 A: contribute to non profit organizations 

141.34 144.41 A: who to target um 

145.57 149.92 A: to identify so what do you want for your donation 

149.94 152.18 A: (( you know what are you looking for )) 

152.11 153.30 B: mhm 

152.69 154.10 A: and 

153.45 157.76 B: so just generally something that's uh that they do for p._r. purposes or 

157.07 157.96 A: uh-huh 

158.35 159.23 B: oh okay 

159.22 161.63 A: well i mean it's something that 

162.42 164.33 A: because i 

164.53 167.47 A: have been working in fundraising 

167.62 168.72 A: um 

168.89 172.03 A: doing fundraising for arts organizations 

173.05 175.52 A: it's the sort of thing that 

176.26 178.19 A: i have felt 

178.23 179.15 A: (( that )) 

179.54 182.27 A: smaller companies could really benefit from 

182.31 183.18 B: mhm 

182.56 187.03 A: because you know most of the companies that donate to 

188.12 197.21 A: um not for profit organizations do it because someone on their board knows someone at the organization 

197.21 198.04 B: mhm 

197.84 198.90 A: so 

199.33 200.92 A: they don't seem to be 

202.43 205.18 A: donations that are as directed 

205.34 206.54 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

205.39 208.49 A: you know so think about 

208.70 211.55 A: what you want is it a question of getting 

212.27 213.41 A: say 

214.42 221.29 A: your board of directors in touch with the board of directors from the cultural organization 

221.48 225.34 A: is there a business use to that sort of connection 

225.95 234.27 A: would you want perhaps to have use of public spaces in the cultural organization's 

234.47 237.09 A: building space to throw 

237.49 241.08 A: uh extravagant and unique events 

241.59 242.72 A: um 

243.06 244.15 A: so 

245.48 248.06 A: it's something that ultimately as i said 

249.26 250.46 A: um 

251.31 253.33 A: didn't seem to be 

253.68 255.01 A: the best idea 

255.59 259.99 B: mhm [noise] so why did you decide that it wouldn't be the best idea 

260.55 262.70 A: i think it was more about fear 

263.45 264.20 B: hm 

264.48 266.20 A: you know a sense that 

266.68 268.16 A: in this economy 

268.64 269.76 A: it 

270.11 272.42 A: perhaps was not the 

272.92 274.64 A: safest climate 

274.81 276.50 A: from which to 

276.88 278.99 A: launch a new endeavour [mn] 

278.72 279.56 B: mhm 

281.98 284.31 B: yeah that seems true um 

284.67 293.59 B: probably my second choice or actually this is a more realistic choice for me um if i were gonna start my own business would be to do a freelance writing business 

292.95 293.83 A: uh-huh 

294.06 295.30 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

295.60 306.22 B: but the thing i- a- and i would like to uh work in um video game writing and that's the field that i'm currently working in but i have like a full time position which is not very creative 

304.60 306.17 A: where are you working [noise] [noise] 

306.33 307.56 B: um 

307.91 314.65 B: [lipsmack] well i work at a major video game developer and publisher um up in morin 

314.78 315.85 A: okay 

316.23 318.26 A: i just ask because 

318.79 321.95 A: that's the sort of thing that my husband is doing 

321.98 323.64 A: following his dreams 

324.21 326.10 A: um he is c- 

325.24 326.48 B: who is sorry 

326.49 328.03 A: my husband 

327.45 328.52 B: oh uh-huh 

328.13 330.21 A: is currently writing 

330.97 334.81 A: um the stories not so much coding 

334.83 335.69 B: mhm 

335.25 338.76 A: but writing the narrative behind 

339.26 340.79 A: video games 

340.91 342.48 B: oh where does he work 

342.91 347.71 A: he is writing full time at the moment and looking for a job 

348.06 349.44 B: oh okay i see 

348.71 350.84 A: and we're here in los angeles 

350.81 355.23 B: oh okay so is he going to e. three next uh this week [lipsmack] 

353.58 358.98 A: [laughter] um he wants to but he can't scare up a pass 

359.26 363.75 B: oh yes it can be pretty hard if you don't have connections in the industry [lipsmack] 

363.03 365.64 A: yeah so 

365.98 367.78 A: (( do you have any suggestions )) 

368.38 377.00 B: um i mean the best thing to do is just to know somebody in the industry unfortunately i mean even if you are in the industry it can be pretty hard to get a pass mhm 

376.36 380.44 A: i know he was talking today with one of the [sigh] 

380.45 395.31 A: same sorts of narrative game developers from microsoft and this was today and elan said yeah you know uh conferences are the bane of my existence and i got out of having to go to this one but 

395.36 397.67 A: i couldn't even get a pass 

397.94 398.87 B: mhm 

398.98 400.63 A: (( so [noise] )) 

400.49 406.20 B: yeah i mean i have a lot of friends who uh you know just got their passes like 

406.33 409.67 B: a couple of days ago but up until then it was like really uncertain 

410.82 412.36 B: [sigh] um 

412.44 416.51 B: and i mean it costs like three hundred dollars if you wanna just buy your way in 

415.25 416.96 A: (( [noise] right )) 

418.03 428.55 B: and i guess that can be useful for the connections but i mean [mn] i would say that one other thing that your husband might be able to do is just to hang out you know um places around the major hotels 

428.46 437.34 B: and try to get into the parties or just meet people in the bars and so on where they're uh hanging after e. three because there's a lot of partying going on you can make a lot of connections [lipsmack] 

435.22 436.63 A: [noise] right 

437.61 443.21 A: um where is the event even being held this [mn] i'm sure he knows but i don't know 

443.17 446.35 B: oh it's in the convention center the staple center i think 

444.78 445.58 A: okay 

446.01 446.78 A: okay 

447.16 448.54 B: [noise] just downtown 

448.27 449.35 A: yeah 

449.15 461.48 B: but um yeah i mean if i were gonna start my own business that's actually like exactly the same kinda thing that i would wanna be doing um but it's you know money wise it's it's pretty scary because it's really hard to find that kind of freelance work 

454.89 455.86 A: yeah 

461.68 464.08 A: yeah [sigh] and 

463.43 467.82 B: as i'm sure you're [laughter] familiar with from your husband is doing 

465.82 467.50 A: oh yeah you know 

467.92 469.99 A: we came out from new york 

469.86 470.71 B: mhm 

470.05 474.93 A: and were both downsized from the dot com world [sigh] 

475.10 476.21 A: so 

476.38 477.54 A: um 

478.36 487.24 A: [lipsmack] you know i had gone into dot com work quite briefly i was just seduced by the lure of stock options which never materialized 

487.34 491.24 A: but um you know he was doing it for several years 

491.49 496.55 A: and when we move out here he decided he didn't want to go back into the 

496.72 500.11 A: working world as he had conventionally known it 

500.07 500.94 B: mhm 

500.68 501.55 A: so 

501.98 506.02 A: i think the game that changed everything for him 

506.24 511.14 A: were you familiar with the game that microsoft had done 

511.24 513.96 A: in conjunction with the movie a._i. 

514.08 515.69 A: a couple of years ago 

515.39 517.73 B: mhm oh uh-huh the the web game 

517.40 518.52 A: yeah 

518.48 525.53 B: yeah actually um i have a good friend who is uh one of the leaders of cloudmakers which is the organization that was uh 

525.11 526.58 A: uh-huh 

525.68 529.67 B: on the web to uh sell the games i'm sure you you know about it [laughter] 

527.92 530.56 A: okay who is who is your friend i 

530.26 531.12 B: dan 

531.50 532.88 B: dan fabulitch 

532.74 535.22 A: mm-kay i know the name 

533.96 534.76 B: do you know him 

535.51 536.42 A: but 

536.99 540.09 A: can't picture a face i'm sure jay probably could 

540.88 541.99 A: um 

542.19 551.27 A: because he's so in touch and still friends with a lot of the cr- cloudmakers and still working with them as they contemplate 

551.62 555.20 A: you know and are tr- kind of trying to start their own things 

555.11 556.07 B: mhm 

555.78 556.77 A: so 

556.91 566.73 B: yeah i mean i would say sadly that probably most of the things out there um in the video game world right now are not nearly as original or difficult as as the a._i. game 

563.77 564.74 A: yeah 

564.83 566.08 A: mhm 

566.59 567.49 A: (( [lipsmack] right )) 

566.81 567.90 B: from what i've seen 

569.44 572.86 A: yeah [sigh] um he hasn't seen 

573.08 576.82 A: anything that has that breadth of creativity 

576.86 577.76 B: mhm 

577.61 578.69 A: so 

579.06 583.56 A: you know when h- we've been talking with friends that we have at e._a. 

584.34 590.95 A: which you know nice work if you can get it but [laughter] it's not like they really 

584.49 585.35 B: (( mhm )) 

592.03 596.39 A: need um narrative writers 

596.61 599.89 A: um they do supposedly have a small staff of them
