7.68 8.74 B: um 

9.97 15.91 B: [noise] you know that's tough because um if there is one thing that i would like to do um 

11.93 13.45 A: (( [mn] )) 

15.96 22.39 B: [noise] if i had free time and money was not an object i'd be a writer but that's not really a business um [lipsmack] 

21.92 29.25 A: i think it is and and that's exactly what i would do [laughter] yeah that's funny [laughter] 

25.65 26.88 B: (( really [laughter] )) 

29.02 37.98 B: oh it's the one thing that that um doesn't really give anything back unfortunately in the unit- i know my sister used to work for the s._b._a. 

38.12 51.01 B: and she keeps talking about how [noise] it'd be easy to get like a small business loan to start up a company but i know people who own their own businesses and it has to be something 

47.20 47.93 A: (( [noise] )) 

48.53 49.92 A: mhm 

51.42 52.70 B: [lipsmack] where 

51.82 52.38 A: (( mm )) 

52.97 55.56 B: it m- you have a a passion for 

55.71 64.15 B: and a good business model and there's um uh like a niche in the market for what you're trying to sell 

63.03 64.79 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

64.66 65.76 B: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

66.33 74.25 B: and it's funny that they asked this question because i don't think that i ever could be a business owner 'cause i can't think of anything that i would wanna sell to people 

74.85 83.53 A: i can think of a few things i'd like to sell to people but not anything [lipsmack] like specific like any kind of um 

83.90 87.46 A: product that would help people in their lives like i just 

87.45 94.64 A: recently applied for a job for a man that has he makes all natural hair care products and has some 

94.62 107.52 A: a line of hairbrushes and some make up and he's also got a lot of information about what ingredients are in most of the hair care products that people use that are re- actually really bad for you 

107.51 110.17 A: and why they're bad for you yeah 

107.85 108.69 B: really [noise] 

110.19 111.62 A: and um 

111.75 113.61 A: i really 

113.86 123.86 A: when i looked at his website i thought oh yeah i could work for this guy as an administrative assistant i mean i have a masters degree in english and and i really am a writer but um 

121.38 122.82 B: (( [noise] excellent [noise] [noise] )) 

123.97 129.15 A: i i'm willing to do any kind of a job just so i can pay my rent and 

127.80 129.66 B: (( [laughter] right [noise] )) 

129.16 140.79 A: uh well not any kind of a job but that's a job that i could actually stand behind and feel good about and i'd be anxious to try his products on my own hair because i'm not happy about most of the products i use on my hair 

141.10 151.33 A: and um so i then i really enjoy like i work for a book publisher and we do um it's a very small publisher called life rhythm 

144.42 145.58 B: (( [noise] )) 

146.90 148.27 B: [noise] [noise] really which one 

151.35 152.47 B: okay 

151.38 164.01 A: it's in it's in mendocino california and um we had books mostly around this core energetic institute 'cause the publisher himself was also a counselor and a teacher 

154.87 156.04 B: (( [noise] okay [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

164.20 165.21 B: cool 

164.43 174.81 A: so they were mostly books having to do with um body centered psychotherapy and we had tuning forks and various uh and c._d.s and various other little products 

174.82 178.89 A: but um i enjoyed the part about um 

179.34 182.70 A: going out and filling up the orders and 

181.77 182.68 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

182.76 187.24 A: you know making all the i set up their labelling system and 

187.48 199.68 A: 'cause the label that did it before me was typing every single label and if we sold to somebody like barnes and nobles we maybe sold boxes of books and like all at once there was a dozen boxes that you were shipping out and 

191.24 192.36 B: [laughter] 

199.41 200.47 B: right 

199.78 206.06 A: [laughter] you're gonna type a dozen labels i don't think so here's a computer you see this you can set this up here 

202.75 204.58 B: [laughter] 

205.85 207.55 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

206.23 210.40 A: and so i did that kind of stuff and i actually enjoyed that i liked 

210.37 220.94 A: the whole physical part of taping the boxes and doing the u._p._s. thing and you know it was kinda just fun to see like a product moving around and uh it was a 

220.26 221.76 B: right 

220.85 230.62 A: a nice product a good product that was helping and healing people and so th- that i think i could get behind some kind of 

225.66 226.72 B: right 

230.84 233.27 A: i i don't know mail order internet 

233.08 233.92 B: right 

233.72 236.51 A: um something where you had a product and 

236.58 246.09 A: i don't wanna produce the product [laughter] but um like a publisher they they don't actually produce the books you know they they do but 

238.96 239.79 B: [laughter] 

246.24 249.87 A: th- a pr- a printer makes the books and then ships them to them 

246.35 247.38 B: right 

249.14 252.89 B: right right i used to work at houghton mifflin in boston [lipsmack] 

252.13 253.50 A: oh did you 

253.31 267.33 B: yeah i worked in the um production side um for three year in the educational publishing department [sigh] um yeah [laughter] i'm i'm facing a position of maybe having to back into publishing even though i don't really want to 

256.28 257.34 A: mhm 

259.66 260.96 A: oh wow 

267.10 268.22 A: uh-huh 

267.43 275.53 B: um [lipsmack] but uh it's while we were talking it has occurred to me that if there was one business that i would like to open now 

275.75 279.65 B: um would be a small film production company [sigh] 

279.85 281.07 A: uh-huh 

280.24 284.48 B: um 'cause i'm out here in hollywood in the hollywood area oh 

282.53 285.33 A: [mn] uh-huh you're not that far away from me 

285.39 286.75 A: [laughter] 

285.58 290.65 B: you know it's funny i came out because um i was doing a masters um 

291.03 301.17 B: in visual and media arts at emerson in col- in um in boston and i was working at houghton mifflin at the same time i came out here because i wanted to be a writer in the film industry [lipsmack] 

295.52 299.22 A: (( mhm )) 

300.42 301.67 A: mhm 

301.57 314.99 B: and uh that was unfortunate because the the writers' guild strike was threatening the same year i came out so i couldn't get a job [laughter] um and two years later i'm unemployed again which is very unfortunate um 

307.06 309.60 A: mhm mm 

312.58 319.73 A: oh [lipsmack] me too [laughter] god we have a lot in common that's funny [laughter] i'm up in morrow 

315.38 321.79 B: (( [laughter] i know [laughter] maybe we could get together after this [laughter] but uh )) 

320.25 323.89 A: i'm up in morrow bay just north of san louis so 

323.66 325.39 B: oh okay okay 

324.43 330.11 A: i'm actually not that far away from you i mean i'm kind of in the central and you're in the south but 

329.63 334.98 B: [sigh] yeah but uh you know i i the way i see the film industry 

334.30 335.25 A: uh-huh 

335.30 336.09 B: (( is no )) 

336.57 344.19 B: the big studios the big eight studios have all the power and unfortunately the way films are budgeted 

339.89 342.17 A: mhm 

344.63 349.86 B: the big blockbuster films even they are so expensive that studios get together 

349.80 362.87 B: to finance a film because it's just because it just takes so much to produce a great blockbuster film but what i'd like to do i mean one of the studios or the earlier studios that isn't really run this way anymore was united artists 

351.26 352.55 A: right 

355.43 356.52 A: uh-huh 

362.41 363.34 A: uh-huh 

362.99 367.71 B: and it was called united artists because it was run by um actors 

366.23 368.49 A: [laughter] uh-huh 

368.29 378.43 B: um it was the artists themselves who wanted to run that studio so that it would be actor friendly and so there wouldn't be the studio side taking advantage of the talent 

371.48 373.28 A: mhm 

374.30 374.97 A: (( mm )) 

377.90 379.63 A: right right 

378.82 386.47 B: and i would love to get back into that because there is such a strong um independent film movements i mean sundance is so 

386.60 392.70 B: um studio sun trek now and basically if you can get into sundance then the studios will pick it up 

392.36 393.72 A: uh-huh 

392.57 405.55 B: and distribute it so it's not really indie anymore even though it's still labelled indie you know independent films and i just think that there are so many talented people who don't have finances 

397.65 399.52 A: right right 

399.69 401.35 A: right 

405.29 407.45 A: right 

405.49 411.14 B: but if you could create a s- or if i could create a business i could i would create a studio 

411.42 415.73 B: run by a lot of these very creative people um 

414.43 419.16 A: mhm [lipsmack] oh i wanna go to work at it [laughter] 

417.30 420.15 B: [laughter] you know and suppose you can get like 

420.27 432.41 B: [mn] writers who can get backing and directors can get an opportunity to actually you know go out and direct something without and everybody without having to put tons of of their own pocket money in maxing out on five credit cards that they 

429.82 431.72 A: (( mm mhm )) 

432.25 438.22 B: hope they can pay off if the film gets picked up but you know who knows how many people 

434.97 437.32 A: right right 

438.43 442.86 B: actually get picked up get their film picked up for distribution 

442.77 444.59 A: well and how much um 

443.07 445.12 B: after they've maxed out the cards 

444.69 448.78 A: what a great contribution that would be i mean look at what michael moore 

448.83 455.97 A: has done and i mean what he presented in bowling for columbine this is really wonderful stuff 

449.19 450.38 B: yeah 

456.09 457.11 A: um 

456.32 459.17 B: some very i [mn] that was a very interesting film 

458.20 467.50 A: it was a great film i thought everybody in the whole united states should see it [laughter] it was like wow thank you michael 

460.21 461.43 B: [laughter] 

463.51 464.12 B: [laughter] 

467.29 469.22 B: [laughter] 

468.07 472.15 A: he finally really did something great you know his 

471.29 475.07 B: it was he's got a very provocative style 

474.32 488.38 A: mhm he does indeed [laughter] but you know if you just like h- he's just one but what you're talking about i mean there's all kinds of people out there with wonderfully creative ideas that could be doing other types of films too like 

475.08 476.07 B: um 

476.92 477.93 B: um 

488.26 501.45 A: i really love european films because there seems so much deeper um and i love some of the imagery that they use to present ideas rather than a whole bunch of dialogue or crashing cars or anything 

490.64 491.88 B: oh yeah 

500.00 509.21 B: [sigh] [lipsmack] yeah yeah i- it's interesting one of my favorite japanese films um has almost no dialogue in it um 

501.75 502.70 A: (( um )) 

509.23 511.73 B: and i- it's an action film 

511.83 519.86 B: it's really interesting because it's a it's a very touching action film [laughter] by a guy who usually does like gangster movies 

512.89 515.57 A: (( [laughter] )) 

516.68 517.83 A: uh-huh 

519.34 520.78 A: what is it 

520.82 522.78 B: it's called fireworks 

522.50 526.21 A: fireworks i'll have to check it out 

524.17 526.81 B: it's by uh takeshi kitano 

526.88 530.62 B: um who does these yakuza these japanese mafia movies 

530.12 531.23 A: (( mhm )) 

530.67 532.37 B: um about a 

532.45 535.14 B: a cop whose wife is dying of leukemia 

535.32 543.79 B: and it goes back and forth between him having stolen all this money so that he can take his dying wife on a picture tour of japan before she dies 

543.72 544.87 A: (( mm )) 

544.43 548.99 B: um and being chased by both the yakuza 

547.51 548.30 A: oh 

549.05 553.65 B: and the cops who are both you know try- after him for the money 

550.27 551.22 A: (( [laughter] )) 

553.42 555.16 A: (( oh my gosh )) 

554.27 557.87 B: um and it cuts back and forth between him being this tough guy 

557.04 559.08 A: well he's got [noise] a three way 

558.22 568.50 B: and being and being this like very sensitive husband you know and it's just filmed with so much tenderness and love and action with so little dialogue and i'm like 

559.13 560.66 A: [laughter] 

562.82 563.54 A: (( mm )) 

566.33 567.70 A: (( mhm )) 

569.14 572.62 B: (( american films just don't have this [laughter] you know [noise] ))

589.24 590.09 B: (( [laughter] ))
