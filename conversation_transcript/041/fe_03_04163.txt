61.87 63.25 B: oh okay 

62.63 66.05 A: i don't know if we're supposed to or not so sou- i'm in the southeast part of the state 

63.83 64.77 B: okay 

65.57 68.78 B: okay and we're central about pinhead central 

68.52 69.51 A: (( oh okay [sigh] )) 

69.08 70.81 B: mhm 

70.70 72.56 A: um what type of business 

72.68 73.62 A: [lipsmack] 

74.90 76.54 A: i think i would open 

77.09 78.24 A: boy i don't know 

78.17 79.32 B: [laughter] 

78.34 79.89 A: we better think of something here 

79.76 80.48 B: (( hm )) 

83.10 85.71 A: i think i'd be a personal trainer in california 

85.43 90.62 B: oh wow that sounds like a good idea [laughter] 

87.24 89.30 A: 'cause that would be [laughter] 

90.13 97.56 A: [cough] and do i think i would be successful um probably because i think fitness is important um i'm actually a c._p._a. 

97.55 98.34 B: oh 

97.95 100.49 A: so i mean i've got the business background 

100.10 101.46 B: mhm 

100.87 109.53 A: and i love talking to people so this is actually a pretty fun job too at the moment but um and i think that'd be fun to meet new people and people that that um 

104.19 105.83 B: (( mhm )) 

109.58 117.14 A: also think fitness is important and it would be very rewarding to see people transform themselves so to speak 

111.31 112.54 B: mhm 

116.92 118.13 B: mhm 

118.51 119.68 A: so what about you 

119.04 119.61 B: (( mm )) 

119.80 123.48 B: well i suppose i would have to say an antique business 

123.51 124.66 A: oh that'd be neat 

124.13 126.11 B: because we've always 

126.22 133.30 B: been interested in older things and my mother was too and so a lot of that transfers you know 

129.26 130.75 A: mhm 

133.10 133.95 A: mhm 

133.97 135.46 B: and i think 

136.26 142.85 B: there's probably not any one person that would know everything so meeting more people and 

143.01 146.36 B: finding what they know would be very interesting 

145.99 146.83 A: right 

146.66 151.14 B: because there's there's just no way and it's interesting at auctions 

151.28 162.81 B: to listen to the auctioneers try to tell you what an item is and you know very well it's not [laughter] and sometimes they're older than i am or younger than i am but i 

156.96 159.35 A: [laughter] 

162.31 163.18 A: right 

162.84 167.06 B: always think you've got a lot to live a lot to learn you know but 

165.84 170.70 A: and then you see a lot of people bid on something that they shouldn't be because they think it's something that it's not right 

168.47 169.80 B: right 

170.04 174.92 B: right or else they spend way more than what the item would bring 

174.53 175.32 A: right 

174.94 178.60 B: you know whether it was an older or a newer item so 

177.80 178.74 A: right 

178.92 182.05 B: yeah auctions are interesting did you ever get into those 

182.00 183.75 A: um i've been to a couple 

183.37 184.52 B: mhm 

184.62 186.49 A: and usually i just get frustrated 

186.20 187.05 B: oh 

186.67 189.96 A: because i wait all day and then there's something that i really want and 

188.62 191.36 B: oh yeah that can happen 

190.92 196.77 A: and then i remember we were a couple of times we bid on something and we we set a dollar limit and 

197.04 203.14 A: you know of course it goes for the ten dollars after that but who knows had you kept on going it could have gone three four hundred more you know 

199.24 201.17 B: mhm [laughter] 

202.49 204.34 B: right right yeah 

203.20 206.99 A: actually i've done a little bit on ebay so that gets my auction stuff out of me 

205.90 208.24 B: oh oh you have done ebay yeah 

207.65 208.62 A: yeah 

208.44 217.76 B: i'm interested in doing that but i just um have not taken the big jump yet did you start buying or did you start selling on ebay you did 

215.66 217.09 A: i actually started buying 

218.20 223.13 B: and then do you get um positive do you do the feedback on the buying part too 

221.40 229.64 A: yep yeah yep i was real good about giving it and then i sold a couple of small items and actually a person that i bought something from i emailed him and asked for a little bit of advice 

229.42 230.41 B: (( mhm oh )) 

229.66 232.87 A: and he said just kinda follow start with something small you know 

232.49 233.64 B: mhm 

232.94 235.77 A: and kinda follow the instructions and i did it all myself 

235.47 236.16 B: (( hm )) 

235.97 238.74 A: he also suggested getting ebay for dummies book 

238.61 239.71 B: oh 

239.13 242.75 A: which he said was very helpful but i i mean i've done a couple of things but 

240.39 241.50 B: oh i 

242.62 243.35 B: hm 

243.10 246.88 A: so would you be successful in the antique business i would say probably because 

246.17 248.06 B: probably yeah 

247.17 250.57 A: you already are are are already a successful business owner 

248.08 249.06 B: yeah 

250.29 256.58 B: mhm but it would be interesting just um just to do it just to make sure you could you know 

255.61 256.41 A: right 

256.94 258.07 B: (( [noise] so )) 

257.42 260.10 A: well i tell ya there's certainly people have made a fortune on ebay 

260.19 262.49 B: [sigh] yeah that's what they say 

262.80 263.82 B: um 

264.46 268.94 B: i am interested in trying some of that but i like i said i just haven't 

268.95 273.17 B: taken the big jump right right now i'm getting ready to do the 

270.29 271.49 A: right 

273.41 276.59 B: um what's the name of it 

277.36 280.20 B: hm geezers dot com 

280.28 281.74 B: have you heard of that

305.98 306.62 A: (( hm )) 

307.11 307.96 A: right 

308.16 312.27 B: and i think they said they had three hundred and fifteen 

313.44 322.01 B: uh subscribers or people that do it and they can each put ten items on so that's three hundred and ten thousand so 

315.06 316.15 A: wow that's good 

320.40 321.26 A: right 

321.28 322.83 A: that's a lot of stuff to look at 

322.63 323.83 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

323.62 326.22 A: i'm trying to think of another business that i might wanna do 

326.70 329.55 A: i think it'd be fun to sell real estate in california too 

329.12 330.45 B: ooh hm

353.39 355.66 A: plus i like the warm weather i'm not really a 

355.90 358.64 A: a a lover of winters here so 

357.85 359.00 B: mhm 

359.31 363.27 B: have you spent any time in the south though so that you know where you'd like to be 

363.43 368.31 A: um just on vacation i went to school in at arizona state for a semester 

364.97 365.64 B: (( uh-huh )) 

368.12 369.01 B: oh 

368.33 370.46 A: and it gets awfully hot in the summer there 

369.84 372.10 B: (( mhm they say it )) 

371.19 373.33 A: so of course i want the best of both worlds you know 

372.89 376.89 B: yeah they say it's a dry heat but i don't know if that would still 

376.05 376.87 A: oof 

376.93 379.48 A: (( i don't know it was awfully uncomfortable )) 

378.12 378.71 B: (( mm )) 

379.97 386.07 B: i would think so we were for a time in fort walton beach when my husband was in the service there 

386.12 388.23 B: and i was teaching there and you 

388.42 395.09 B: [sigh] take a shower and go out and you think you oughta turn around and go back and take another shower it's just 

392.68 394.25 A: right yeah 

395.30 396.87 B: (( much like the )) 

395.61 396.18 A: (( [mn] )) 

396.87 403.01 A: i know one thing that i would struggle with in in which i do now in owning a business since we're supposed to be talking about that is uh [laughter] 

402.24 403.11 B: mhm 

403.09 404.33 A: keeping my 

404.47 406.38 A: records straight 

405.57 406.47 B: oh 

406.96 409.33 A: which is really bad for a c._p._a. to say but 

408.76 410.14 B: (( [laughter] )) 

409.52 414.10 A: i'm not very good at keeping my receipts and as good as i should be 

411.57 412.45 B: mm 

413.63 415.11 B: mhm 

415.40 417.32 B: yeah one would have to 

418.02 419.79 B: have to do that especially 

418.89 422.23 A: but if i if money was no object i could hire a really good accountant to [laughter] 

421.62 424.29 B: oh there you go yeah [laughter] 

423.37 425.23 A: do you keep yours pretty organized 

424.77 429.06 B: oh yes yep i have to but i don't do it on a computer as of yet 

428.71 429.51 A: right 

429.42 433.02 B: 'cause i don't know spreadsheets as far as that part of it 

432.82 435.84 A: i think my problem is i don't keep up on it every day like i should 

435.51 436.78 B: mhm 

436.61 438.37 A: and then it's easy to get behind 

439.14 443.49 B: well you know on ours being we're just a bedding plant 

443.27 444.12 A: mhm 

443.94 447.73 B: uh and we just started in january with plants 

447.91 450.36 B: and then sell in may and june 

450.50 451.31 B: and 

450.50 451.56 A: and then you're done 

451.80 456.04 B: yeah then we're done with that and i write down every check and every 

455.90 456.69 A: right 

456.35 462.75 B: bank and routing number and i don't know if if everybody does that in every business do they 

461.89 465.24 A: wow i've never heard of being that detailed but that's probably good 

465.25 470.39 B: you know it is for that but i wonder how the other ones do their tallying then 

471.95 472.90 A: (( well )) 

472.10 474.95 B: you know how they get their totals or whatever 

473.86 474.69 A: right 

474.98 476.04 A: (( yeah i don't know )) 

475.91 481.71 B: because we don't have a cash register thing that you know tells what's taxable and what's not 

478.91 480.13 A: (( right i )) 

481.14 485.39 A: think the key is just staying on top of it and do whatever works for ya you know 

484.82 485.91 B: mhm 

486.01 490.42 B: so now your business the landscaping then you do your own billing 

490.48 491.27 A: yes 

491.39 495.74 B: we- and in the real estate business you would have to do that too wouldn't you 

495.40 496.20 A: right 

496.52 500.23 A: well with mine the billing's pretty easy the problem is keeping track of the materials 

500.01 501.64 B: [mn] oh mhm 

501.34 502.43 A: because 

502.62 509.84 A: every job uses a different color and a different you know i'm constantly going to get sand and constantly going to get things and you know it's 

504.55 505.27 B: (( mm )) 

507.31 508.27 B: oh 

510.03 517.71 A: ten bucks here twenty bucks there and just trying to be good about keeping it all so that at the end of the job i know what i really spent on the job and 

511.59 512.77 B: (( mm mm mhm )) 

515.47 516.09 B: (( mm )) 

516.22 519.58 B: yeah so you do the estimates too 

519.21 520.49 A: yep 

519.65 521.01 B: mhm 

521.18 523.89 B: then you must have been into it for a while to 

523.33 525.02 A: um we started last year 

524.68 526.53 B: oh mhm 

525.93 532.91 A: so we but it's we're about the only game in town around here so it's been a pretty successful so far 

529.46 530.81 B: oh mhm 

532.05 532.77 B: mhm 

532.94 534.08 B: (( so you're fair- )) 

533.13 535.61 A: the problem with it is i would rather be 

536.02 537.89 A: doing something fun in the summer 

537.76 538.57 B: (( oh )) 

538.51 540.50 A: instead i'll have all the time in the winter 

538.68 539.73 B: [laughter] 

540.24 544.26 B: mhm there you go you're probably busy all summer then huh 

543.51 550.92 A: right yeah trying to beat the rain but that's why if i were to pick another business i would pick some place that's not wisconsin 

544.35 545.74 B: mhm 

546.53 547.16 B: mm 

550.54 552.67 B: mhm mhm 

552.72 553.69 A: (( [laughter] um )) 

553.28 556.54 B: mm oh i'd still pick wisconsin i guess 

557.06 560.23 B: but 'cause i like the change of the seasons [sigh] 

559.67 560.47 A: right 

561.49 565.56 A: i think the thing about to be successful though is to be a people person too 

565.81 569.43 A: i mean i know i've gone into a lot of businesses and if the owners are not 

569.80 571.93 A: very friendly i probably don't go back 

570.72 573.98 B: mhm right yes i agree with you there 

572.74 576.38 A: i mean even if it's the local mom and pop hardware store or whatever it is 

575.96 577.17 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

576.42 579.21 A: i'll go somewhere else or the restaurant or i 

578.60 579.85 B: right yeah 

580.61 582.31 B: yeah that's true 

582.29 586.25 A: mean i think that's huge there's a lot of places i'll go spend a little bit more money just because 

582.46 583.15 B: (( [mn] )) 

587.06 588.65 A: the people are much nicer 

588.12 589.36 B: mhm 

590.30 593.07 B: when did you sign on for this um 

592.61 593.79 A: ah yesterday
