6.20 7.56 B: i'm good 

6.94 8.75 A: kevin did you say you're kevin 

8.03 9.50 B: no it's kelly 

8.93 10.40 A: kelly okay 

10.39 12.04 B: and you're simon right 

11.38 12.65 A: yes [laughter] 

12.47 14.73 B: so i guess we're starting on business 

14.15 16.87 A: i guess so [laughter] 

15.23 20.35 B: [laughter] well good well what kind of business would you actually uh start 

19.68 33.64 A: i don't know um i kinda feel something like you know um a consulting firm or something uh where there's a lot of interaction with people i generally don't like to uh do stuff i mean with 

25.32 26.29 B: okay 

33.63 41.48 A: with a limited number of people i like to interact with people and talk to people probably help them out get get their careers started or something like that 

41.65 43.56 A: um you know try 

42.40 47.87 B: so so what kinda consultant like what like i._t. or something like that 

45.03 46.73 A: you know like probably 

47.03 53.05 A: it it could be in a field like i specifically um i'm from a business i._t. background 

52.45 53.57 B: (( oh okay )) 

53.03 67.28 A: so um i kind of uh i kind of feel that that's that's my expertise and um i could help people out in that you know uh get them placement try to match their job skills you know some kind of consulting or placement kinda service 

66.98 68.22 B: excellent 

67.64 72.89 A: um in this economy i guess that's that's needed quite a lot [laughter] 

71.42 73.67 B: yeah i think so i think so 

73.01 75.48 A: what is your take on this 

74.87 83.44 B: well i and i think that's a great idea i think that if i was gonna start a business i would probably start a residential management company 

83.01 84.18 A: okay 

83.70 89.98 B: where um you know basically i think that there would be a lot less overhead for me to do that 

89.37 90.51 A: mhm 

89.89 98.75 B: uh and that would be something where i could real estate obviously is something more um you can be successful at especially if you've got money 

98.29 99.34 A: right 

98.67 105.60 B: and i would and uh i think that's what i would do is probably something like that where i'd have residential rental properties where 

105.52 114.09 B: i would actually probably have a few and then also i would probably do the management piece of that for like other land owners or you know landlords 

113.59 121.35 A: do you feel that that is as lucrative as actually doing the real investment i mean the real investment you know buying it for yourself 

120.79 135.58 B: well i think do a little bit of both at first to be honest with you 'cause i i think the other thing too is i think that it's somewhat of a recession proof type of type of business in the sense that you know everybody always needs a home um 

124.00 124.98 A: okay 

134.64 142.53 A: that's true but then the the land value appreciation might not might not be that high during a recession i guess 

135.45 136.53 B: (( you know when everybody )) 

142.06 143.49 B: that's right 

142.87 149.42 A: um i do know that the last two or three years land prices have gone up much higher than it has you know over 

149.22 158.50 A: like say from the period ninety seven to two thousand one like it's not really gone up much but say two thousand one to two thousand three i think it's really gone up 

152.54 153.45 B: uh-huh 

158.00 159.03 B: yep 

158.44 168.82 A: uh so it really depends on you know the economy the state of the economy and things like that and probably you could you could maybe make a bad investment to of um um 

168.95 178.57 A: uh of a land that does not appreciate in value or i mean you buy it in a countryside or something you know you could get stuck with such kind of a 

172.39 173.43 B: (( mhm yeah and i think that's )) 

178.78 180.60 A: piece of property right 

179.84 184.03 B: true with any business i guess that's true with any business i guess there's risk to any business so 

183.33 184.77 A: that's true that's 

184.11 190.74 B: how would you start yours i mean if you um like if mo- they say money's not an issue with this so ho- where would you probably start 

189.93 193.95 A: [laughter] that is always the first issue is the money but uh 

192.21 193.56 B: (( is it [laughter] )) 

193.64 196.81 B: but now that it's not an issue what's your next step [laughter] 

195.89 206.74 A: um i i believe um setting up and establishment setting up a network of contacts you know through um as i said if i'm setting up a recruiting agency or something like that 

206.73 215.49 A: um i i believe i would you know uh try to network through my friends i i'm just out of school like i'm i just recently graduated 

215.24 216.10 B: okay 

215.50 226.25 A: so uh i would try to use my uh my contacts uh my school network um you know to to try to spread the word try to get people to work with me um 

225.41 228.81 B: to to actually get get your client base started 

228.25 234.90 A: exactly exactly because i'm starting uh completely fresh you know completely new and i really don't 

235.10 240.28 A: i wouldn't have anything to start off with so i would need to build you know a good client base 

236.80 237.67 B: mhm 

240.07 240.91 B: great 

240.61 242.40 A: um yeah 

241.49 254.27 B: i i think i would do the same i think i'd start with building a ba- business plan and obviously i think my business plan would be have all the components needed from a standpoint of of your marketing plan your financial plan 

245.43 246.45 A: okay 

252.41 256.24 A: okay but would you consider working alone or working with partners 

255.67 264.54 B: i you know i think in well since money isn't an issue i think that i wouldn't necessarily need partners for finance but i think for 

264.56 274.62 B: um potentially i might need them some help with my client base and promoting myself and stuff i'd probably use my partners and my friends and family to help with that 

265.84 267.44 A: for the management part 

273.95 283.02 A: okay again i i'm not too much of a uh keen like i i really don't advise people uh 

283.06 297.53 A: to bring in family into business [laughter] i mean usually it tends you know it tends to spoil the relationship uh because business is usually uh there will be certain compromises uh involved there'll be certain i mean certain understanding is 

284.85 285.86 B: mhm 

289.23 290.08 B: yep 

297.31 305.92 A: necessary and i guess when family comes into the picture uh they expect a lot of compromise or you know a lot of understanding that 

306.09 309.70 A: uh might not be good for the future of the business 

309.12 311.35 B: i agree i agree 

310.24 315.69 A: and they might take more liberty and be not as professional as we expect them to be 

315.49 316.69 B: right 

316.07 323.16 A: uh yeah those are some issues i wouldn't but i would trust my friends more than my family into uh into my business 

322.83 327.05 B: you know and i i think the other starting point that this is too would be 

326.83 339.43 B: i would rely on other professionals in other words i would i would draw [cough] excuse me and rely on the expertise of a of a lawyer to actually set up the entity whether it's a corporation whether it's a partnership whether it's a 

335.80 336.86 A: right 

338.20 339.05 A: right 

339.43 343.68 B: ah you know a limited partnership or whatever it may be 

343.52 356.32 B: i'd rely on them to help us help me and also rely on a good accountant and find a an accountant maybe a in town that's uh would be able to help me with being able to work within the law but be able to help me with 

347.87 348.94 A: mhm 

356.17 361.50 B: um certain tax breaks that he might be aware of or so on and so forth so 

359.39 360.28 A: right 

360.99 374.41 A: uh you mentioned before that because you don't have any financial restrictions you wouldn't be considering for partners for the financial reasons uh yes i agree with you on that but there would be another point like 

364.85 365.41 B: (( [cough] )) 

369.00 369.90 B: right 

374.43 376.47 A: (( um partners )) 

376.49 381.69 A: if they have an investment or a stake in the business would be more interested or would be 

380.28 381.37 B: very true 

382.09 387.37 A: more um willing to put in more hours extra hours or you know 

387.41 388.37 A: uh 

388.86 402.98 A: to to promote the business so i i believe not only the financial point of view but uh for the growth of the business i believe that we do need um partners in the business at least one or two who could be experts in their field but you know 

399.79 400.58 B: mhm 

402.33 416.25 B: well you know when that's true and and the thing about a business is obviously especially starting from scratch um you you're only as good as you can be you know you're gonna need support from from other people to help you uh make it that much better 

412.49 413.62 A: exactly 

414.57 415.74 A: exactly 

415.84 426.11 A: mhm mhm well no when i was studying at school like kind of you know like uh when we talk among friends you know some guys will be good in management some guys will be good in the marketing part 

416.74 417.60 B: so 

426.02 433.62 A: some guys'll be good in the i._t. sector or you know they're so we we usually talk about coming together and setting up our own company 

427.66 428.70 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

433.53 444.04 A: uh and it might even become a reality um because i believe that you know we need one from each section section like uh each area of expertise 

435.71 436.47 B: right 

443.56 450.91 B: well i agree i agree and you know because you can only be an expert at certain things and you can't be an expert at all with you know 

449.88 451.18 A: exactly 

451.18 458.42 B: you might as well bring in the people that you know know finance or they know advertising or they know marketing and just pool everybody together 

457.96 465.32 A: right right and then you could bring a good employee base and you know with three or four partners you could start hiring others and 

465.33 467.47 A: uh build a good base for that 

467.21 474.93 B: i think so too and tell you once i got it started up i think for me my goal would be to get it to where it's running on its own 

474.63 475.50 A: mhm 

474.93 484.25 B: in other words you're exactly right you hire competent employees and you be good to your employees and you pay 'em good enough that they're gonna do a good job for you 

483.83 484.85 A: mhm 

484.27 491.20 B: uh treat them well and let the business run itself and not try and micromanage too much but get it to a point where 

491.09 501.76 B: um you can enjoy other things in life i mean for me if i was gonna start my own business i would say it's difficult for the first whatever you know two or three years or even maybe six or seven years 

498.03 498.92 A: right 

500.25 502.99 A: i believe much longer [laughter] 

501.78 512.96 B: yeah exactly even six seven eight years but there's always that light at the end of the tunnel where you get to a point where you've trained everybody you you've built your client base and you get it to where you know what 

511.98 519.70 A: but then don't you think that it's always like uh we we we want to grow more or we want to expand more then we 

517.90 519.04 B: [laughter] 

519.55 524.81 A: always end up in the trap where you know you're you're constantly working like twenty hours a day or 

524.09 528.39 B: [laughter] you're probably right you're probably right 

524.59 536.14 A: [laughter] because nothing is usually enough you know i mean when we get something we want more and more you just keep it keeps increasing 

535.71 544.14 B: it's true what and i think it's a balance between for me i actually have a family so i you know i'm married and have have some i have two boys and so 

542.43 543.32 A: (( mhm )) 

544.25 545.57 B: [cough] for me 

545.49 553.28 B: um i wanna obviously have time to spend with them so when they get older so hopefully you know i get the business to where it'd run itself 

553.13 561.05 B: and my priorities hopefully would change a little bit once it was running to the fact of you know spending time with the family and so on and so forth 

560.55 561.91 A: (( right yeah )) 

561.17 564.01 B: and everybody's got a different perspective i guess 

563.40 575.40 A: i do understand that yeah definitely and at some point of time i believe that we need to spend more time with the family i mean ah you could you could end up having a great business and a ruined family [laughter] 

564.02 565.77 B: [laughter] 

568.53 569.58 B: i agree 

574.18 585.67 B: that's right you know i've always had a saying in life that you know if you can if you enjoy driving to work and you enjoy driving home you've got a good balance 

581.53 582.31 A: uh-huh 

585.04 590.43 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] that's )) 

585.79 593.13 B: but if it's to one of the other then you've got problems so as long as you can enjoy driving there and enjoy driving back 

592.67 595.97 A: true wrong with that that's a very good code [laughter] 

594.61 599.95 B: you know but if you got one and not the other it's it it can always be an issue so it's always
