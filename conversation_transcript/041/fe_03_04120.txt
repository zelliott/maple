1.58 5.67 A: hi i'm maureen nice to meet you [laughter] 

3.67 6.52 B: [laughter] how are you today 

5.96 8.66 A: i'm good how are you [noise] 

7.30 8.42 B: (( hi )) 

8.45 12.70 B: so we're supposed to talk about business 

10.27 15.47 A: talk about [laughter] opening our own business do you wanna go first or do you want me to [noise] okay 

14.70 17.63 B: opening my own business let's see um 

18.33 19.51 B: (( i don't know )) 

20.01 25.21 B: i uh well i'm a singer so maybe i would look into um 

25.43 30.99 B: doing uh singing for weddings and and and different occasions like that 

29.65 32.70 A: [noise] oh that would be a good idea 

31.89 33.30 B: (( yeah )) 

32.60 45.99 A: my uh sister in law actually [noise] does something similar to that but it's like um karaoke that she does along with it [noise] so she'll kind of spar the people on [noise] if there's not a lot of people getting up there to sing [noise] or she'll sing or 

39.43 40.47 B: yeah 

45.82 50.91 A: so it's it's really kinda nice [noise] because then if she you know she has younger children 

51.29 56.61 A: she's able to spend some time and work around their schedule and still make a little bit of money 

54.63 56.28 B: yeah the nice thing about 

56.34 67.25 B: yeah the nice thing about that is there's so many karaoke tracks out there so pretty much [sigh] uh you know whatever song they want you can pretty much find it and you don't have to play an instrument or anything 

63.38 65.10 A: (( [noise] right )) 

66.80 68.18 A: (( right [noise] )) 

67.39 69.08 B: like that so 

68.26 70.57 A: yes [noise] well you know not 

70.84 74.43 A: (( everybody or an instrument player [laughter] )) 

71.02 76.85 B: [laughter] well that's off the top of my head i was thinking of something but uh 

75.73 83.54 A: [laughter] i know i was sitting here going you know it's funny when they said what kind of business would you open i was thinking right before um 

83.50 96.35 A: the call came there was a lady on t._v. that was doing all kinds of different things that you could do at home like facials [noise] or hand scrubs or foot scrubs and i'm sitting here going i could do that i could make that 

94.90 95.57 B: you 

95.71 97.33 B: you mean making 'em 

96.74 98.79 A: yeah yeah 

97.37 101.15 B: yeah it's it's it's really easy to do that i 

100.63 105.95 A: right and it's not it's not as [mn] you know much of a initial investment 

105.69 114.60 B: yeah i used to do that for gifts for my friends i could buy a big bag of dead sea salts and add like a nice base oil and you know 

106.40 107.71 A: money wise 

111.78 112.63 A: yeah 

114.18 116.37 A: yes well that's what they were 

114.51 122.89 B: and then just a couple of drops of aromatherapy and put it in a jar [sigh] and i mean the same thing sells at um [lipsmack] what's that store um 

117.53 118.09 A: (( [mn] )) 

122.93 124.28 B: that sells all the 

123.07 124.49 A: bath and body 

124.70 130.69 B: that yeah the same thing those those little things round about twenty you know dollars 

126.77 127.50 A: (( okay )) 

129.03 134.52 A: yes [noise] well they were talking about that on the television with the dead sea salts and i was thinking [noise] 

131.12 132.43 B: [laughter] 

134.56 140.18 A: well i guess that's [noise] what makes it fancier i suppose you know [noise] you wouldn't be able just to find that anywhere but evidently you can 

140.16 151.34 B: [cough] yeah yeah i mean i i'm not sure where to buy 'em i mean but i used to buy 'em all the time i used to live overseas and i could buy 'em at the drugstore e- everywhere over there but [noise] i i i 

140.73 141.79 A: so 

142.14 142.76 A: [noise] 

143.41 144.29 A: yeah 

145.88 146.97 A: okay 

148.61 150.79 A: (( really wow )) 

151.38 153.07 B: i don't know why [laughter] 

151.60 152.39 A: (( i don't )) 

152.25 160.24 A: that's really interesting i would have never even thought of something like that but i [noise] you know it's little things that like that you go oh i could do something like that 

160.03 174.09 A: but if i if i actually i don't know if this would be considered home based [noise] but if i had the money you know we always talk about if i had the money this is what i would do with it we live [noise] in iowa and so there's not a lot of areas for people to go if they wanna have a wedding reception 

160.04 162.40 B: i'm sure you could use epsom salts 

173.60 174.55 B: yeah 

173.98 185.08 A: it's usually oh in a hotel and our hotels aren't anything big or fancy here [noise] and i think oh it would be neat to have a reception hall and you [noise] could use that for more than just weddings but 

180.14 181.40 B: (( [cough] )) 

184.84 187.40 B: oh you could make a lot of money 

185.33 187.01 A: i think that'd be fun 

187.23 188.97 A: yes well 

187.81 199.22 B: those places that um there's a place in dallas i in dallas texas i went to [sigh] and i don't know how much they paid for that place but it was just a plain little chapel and a plain little um 

189.43 190.29 A: (( [noise] )) 

197.05 198.06 A: yeah 

199.35 200.99 B: place to have a 

201.12 202.51 B: you know a reception 

202.19 203.41 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

202.78 205.09 B: but it was very expensive [laughter] 

204.30 211.77 A: oh i [mn] i remember when i got married you know that was one of the [noise] the biggest part of the wedding expense was the reception 

211.76 217.36 A: and you know it doesn't matter where we picked out it was all about the same price and you 

217.26 228.93 A: know we were young we didn't have a whole lot of money and so [noise] and it was it wasn't like [noise] you'd say oh well let's go and spend you know five thousand dollars on this and it's gonna be really nice it was just pretty basic 

220.65 221.57 B: yeah 

228.46 229.41 B: yeah 

228.83 233.21 A: so i think if i had the money i would like to do something like that'd be fun 

233.10 234.09 B: yeah 

233.40 237.66 A: but i don't know that would be one of the things i would do if i 

237.70 240.83 A: had the money or maybe a clothing shop i don't [laughter] 

237.93 239.16 B: (( [laughter] i )) 

240.02 254.36 B: [laughter] yeah you know what i i said if i ever won the lottery that i would open a hospital for women after they have to recover after they have children [laughter] i i i just had twins they're about two months old 

248.24 250.68 A: oh yes 

253.88 255.42 A: oh my goodness 

254.40 257.66 B: and it's been so rough [laughter] 

256.78 261.08 A: yes now is this your first set okay okay 

258.53 261.81 B: no it's my be my second and third 

261.84 271.33 B: but uh it's so rough you know there's no no place to to just for someone to just go and someone to help you and [laughter] 

263.76 265.77 A: that is that is 

270.48 271.78 A: right 

271.47 274.40 B: when you're when you're re- exhausted and 

274.37 275.29 A: yeah 

274.48 278.31 B: 'course it would be very expensive ca- i can't imagine trying to 

278.34 279.26 B: to 

279.62 281.46 B: stay at a place like that 

281.15 292.79 A: well you know i was thinking the other day when i was in target wouldn't it be nice if there was just like a babysitting area where you could take [noise] your children and they could play while you're shopping and then when you're done shopping you can go and pick them up 

285.39 286.16 B: (( [cough] )) 

289.59 290.58 B: yeah 

292.17 302.66 B: you know they have a place like that in miami where you can pay by the hour it's like a little play- like a little daycare center type type of thing and you can pay by the hour 

295.71 297.20 A: oh really 

300.34 301.52 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

302.52 303.92 A: (( [noise] okay )) 

303.00 307.34 B: and they need more of those places because [sigh] i i mean 

305.97 308.72 A: (( yeah it's hard for moms [noise] )) 

307.71 312.84 B: sure i mean it would be great to just be able to drop my my two and a half year old off and 

312.26 313.61 A: mhm 

312.92 316.03 B: you know and and go do some shopping or something 

315.69 325.95 A: [noise] i always thought it would be harder if you had had just one baby the first time and then to have twins after you've only had one to care for because you 

325.80 330.97 A: would realize wow one was a whole lot easier than two did you find that 

329.07 330.54 B: yeah yeah 

330.90 331.84 B: yeah 

331.27 334.10 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

332.19 341.39 B: it's it's i mean i knew it would be hard but i n- didn't expect it to be i mean i can't even go to the grocery store because if i have the two baby carriers 

334.94 335.72 A: right 

340.97 342.19 A: right 

341.47 353.33 B: then there's nowhere to put the food [laughter] so it i mean i don't know if i'd feel comfortable leaving my my infants at a place like that but if they got were a little bit older you know maybe 

343.26 345.50 A: exactly exactly 

349.33 350.30 A: right 

350.65 351.45 A: right 

352.56 353.56 A: right 

353.28 359.80 B: eight or nine months you know if it was just for an hour i i might you know if it was well staffed i 

354.35 355.19 A: (( yeah )) 

356.90 357.85 A: mhm 

359.00 361.78 A: and they they did nice background checks 

361.49 362.40 B: yeah 

361.58 364.76 A: it wouldn't just be somebody that they would just have come in but you know 

364.61 378.77 A: i was thinking too well gosh you know it wouldn't be like you'd feel comfortable hiring too many men in there because even the local playgroups that we had um [noise] there was always at least one woman in the room that could take care of the the hygiene needs 

374.61 375.89 B: (( [laughter] [cough] )) 

378.17 379.27 B: yeah 

378.94 386.52 A: so it's just i don't know that's that's kind of a scary situation a lot of times you know leaving your children in somebody else's hands but 

385.73 387.27 B: yeah 

386.86 395.37 A: but it would be nice if just every once in a while you could just make a quick trip and actually have it be a quick trip not a huge hour long thing for bread and milk [laughter] 

395.13 397.20 B: yeah [laughter] 

396.83 400.54 A: [noise] [laughter] but that would that would be fun it'd be fun 

399.25 404.01 B: exactly exactly yeah that'd be a lot of work though [laughter] 

403.39 404.83 A: yes it would 

404.17 406.90 B: i i'd like to own it not run it [laughter] 

406.02 420.30 A: yeah [laughter] yeah it would be i it would be hard if you had your own children on top of it too [noise] that you were trying to watch at the same time i think one thing that i definitely would never do as a home business would probably be daycare 

413.31 414.81 B: (( yeah )) 

419.68 421.22 B: yeah me neither 

420.76 422.29 A: i think that'd just be 

421.91 428.97 B: i have a daycare [laughter] no i said i have a daycare right [laughter] i've got three kids [laughter] [sigh] 

423.48 425.32 A: would you you are 

425.54 436.93 A: oh you do i don't think i could do that oh yeah yeah [laughter] well i i can relate to that i have three too but i don't know if i could care for somebody else's children as well as i care for my own 

434.18 435.58 B: (( yeah )) 

435.70 440.12 B: it's hard yeah that's what i said i've got my own daycare [laughter] i don't need any more kids 

439.45 442.08 A: right right 

440.28 445.25 B: [laughter] i've got my own although it is you know when when uh 

445.30 453.33 B: i have a little playmate over that's the same age as my son they play together it's actually less stressful for me 'cause i don't have to entertain him 

448.25 449.32 A: mhm 

451.48 452.27 A: yes 

452.81 453.85 A: yes 

453.99 460.03 A: and you'll find that once your kids get a little bit older [noise] too then that really i mean because i think one was harder than two 

454.16 454.78 B: (( um )) 

459.87 470.28 A: [noise] two was hard initially [noise] but once you got to that point that they could [noise] entertain each other then you were like oh wow [noise] as you can hear my children are entertaining each other right now 

470.01 471.23 B: [laughter] 

470.57 472.79 A: (( [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

472.05 473.49 B: mine are in the other room 

472.81 480.20 A: so well mine tend to follow me wherever it is that i've gone [noise] i've been all through the house right now but so 

480.00 488.12 A: i don't know i don't know what other [noise] type of a business i would open up beyond something like that [noise] like i said clothing because i think a lot of women 

487.78 489.60 B: retail is nice 

488.44 494.92 A: [noise] yeah yeah [noise] and it'd be nice to have affordable things without it being 

495.06 499.22 A: out of style or [noise] so [noise] 

496.41 497.70 B: yeah 

498.52 505.94 B: i have really good luck at uh finding uh at at yard sales and and flea markets and things finding nice 

505.88 515.43 B: things you know decorative things so i would think you could open like a a boutique and have eclectic type of you know interesting pieces 

506.87 507.93 A: yeah 

508.62 510.47 A: [noise] 

513.08 514.58 A: [noise] right 

515.32 517.52 A: right that'd be neat 

515.87 521.06 B: i've seen i've you know i've been surprised at the kind of interesting things i've found so 

520.95 522.79 A: yeah i like yard sailing too 

522.46 530.97 B: so you know i would think that you could uh and i know for a fact antique people go uh you know people that own antique shops and boutiques go 

525.05 525.99 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

531.34 538.10 B: and buy all these th- things people that own resale shops go to garage sales and buy [laughter] a bunch of stuff 

533.78 534.76 A: mhm 

537.45 539.20 A: right right 

538.30 540.68 B: and then they just mark up the price and 

539.97 550.90 A: i know [laughter] i've heard of that too i've never been lucky enough or maybe i don't have an eye for it [noise] to be able to see you know when something would be antique or if it's just [noise] 

551.32 553.47 A: not kept well [laughter] 

552.97 554.19 B: yeah 

554.27 555.50 A: i don't know 

554.30 565.44 B: it's a hit or it's a real hit or miss but especially baby clothes i mean you i'm i've uh seen someone come to my own garage sale and someone said oh that's the lady that [mn] you know runs the the resale shop 

557.70 559.29 A: [noise] 

564.92 566.14 A: (( [noise] right )) 

565.46 571.73 B: but if uh you know she gets a bunch of baby nice baby clothes for fifty cents each and then can sell 'em for two dollars each then 

569.23 570.35 A: mhm 

570.99 575.84 A: i know [noise] i know well i've tried doing that before i've done the consignment thing 

573.09 574.20 B: (( [cough] )) 

575.84 576.93 B: yeah 

575.86 584.92 A: and it is nice though if you can do something like that and i think that would also be a difficult business to get into because you do spend [mn] i 

584.76 594.74 A: mean this lady she'll go in and she'll say okay well we can give you cash now or store credit or you can wait for it to sell and for those people that would just say oh give me cash now if 

594.81 597.23 A: for some reason it didn't sell well 

597.49 599.89 A: then you're then you're kind of stuck 

597.63 599.50 B: (( yeah [cough] ))
