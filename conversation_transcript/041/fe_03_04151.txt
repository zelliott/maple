0.00 1.72 B: hi this is matt 

1.06 3.15 A: hi matt my name is lisa 

2.77 3.73 B: hi lisa 

3.36 4.39 A: how're you 

3.90 5.27 B: i'm well how are you 

4.86 5.99 A: good 

5.39 7.69 B: good so 

7.69 9.46 A: go ahead start [laughter] 

8.65 11.37 B: (( uh-huh all right i'll start this is my first call so )) 

10.99 12.08 A: mine too 

11.78 18.35 B: yours too okay well i guess if um if i could start my own business i would um start a museum 

17.99 18.77 A: (( how come )) 

18.64 28.86 B: well because a museum's kind of what i already tried to start uh so it's something that i'm familiar with and i founded what was called the museum of applied trash and it was this idea that um 

28.89 39.06 B: was a not for profit it kind of uh gives a an umbrella for people who use like recycled art or found object and kind of an open community um 

39.40 40.42 B: museum 

40.11 41.75 A: that sounds pretty cool 

41.42 42.50 B: (( uh thanks )) 

41.91 50.38 A: that's funny 'cause the only type of business i would open would [laughter] also be like a not for profit and i always thought that i would actually um [lipsmack] 

46.47 47.47 B: (( [laughter] )) 

50.25 63.82 A: get let's see i would go to all the schools and i would get kids and families to um donate [mn] all their old games and toys like that where missing pieces and parts same kind of thing like you with like recycling 

60.86 62.63 B: (( [cough] mhm )) 

63.33 64.26 B: right 

63.70 75.24 A: and then get them all together and get all the big game manufacturers to give me a master list of their game parts and instructions so that i could put together new sets and then um 

71.61 72.39 B: mm 

75.53 84.77 A: not sell them but give them away to um you know poor children and families and stuff like that you know as an incentive i guess when they got a good grade on their report 

79.80 81.06 B: yeah 

83.84 87.50 B: (( so they repackage all the broken parts or all the kinds of missing pieces [cough] )) 

86.24 90.74 A: (( yeah like kind of recycle so that way not so much the broken parts )) 

88.45 89.49 B: right 

90.35 92.17 B: not the broken parts but i'm saying that like 

91.34 98.51 A: like all the good parts left so you know how like you always lose game pieces like your deck of cards instead of having fifty two ends up with forty eight or 

93.10 95.37 B: yeah yeah 

97.69 104.87 B: yeah absolutely see i'd even like that i'd like to yeah i'd like the broken parts too like if you could separate all the good parts 

98.59 100.21 A: or you lose a piece here and 

102.06 106.41 A: (( [laughter] i should give them to you for your museum we should kind of collaborate )) 

104.74 112.16 B: exactly exactly so all the good parts can go and you can into your project and like all the good parts can go to your project and you can repackage them and and 

112.14 121.29 B: give away the games and all the broken pieces and all the parts that like are the misfits can go to my side my side and then we can make art out of them [laughter] perfect 

118.83 120.18 A: exactly 

120.24 123.44 A: see that's how we'd go about it we'd just call each other [laughter] 

122.56 125.37 B: [laughter] exactly now we've just got to figure out how to do it 

124.89 127.98 A: so uh where where are you located are you in new york 

127.38 135.85 B: uh i'm i'm from new york i mean i'm from ohio originally and i'm right now in ohio but um kind of all my li- my life is back in new york 

134.86 137.48 A: so would you open your museum in new york or 

136.73 142.79 B: yeah i would open it in new york um [sigh] it would be the first one it would be kind of like a franchise museum though also 

142.33 147.15 A: see i would do franchises once i got started i'd kind of make other states and other cities 

146.07 157.95 B: yeah that was my idea too that i'd kind of like i would take other um would take my museum to other cities and build the same museum like on you know on properties that are that are themselves falling apart or like are themselves 

157.92 164.44 B: um no longer in use by like and for industrial companies or whatever that you know kind of like work out a program with each city specifically 

164.23 172.96 B: to kind of recycle a building as well so that therefore like even the structure itself is built upon you know um a a building that's no longer in use 

172.53 181.16 A: well you'd have to do a lot of networking [laughter] to see if any of the buildings are broken down they're usually owned by somebody and there's a lot of red tape 

174.74 176.12 B: yeah it 

176.62 179.01 B: i know i know they're definitely 

180.06 189.87 B: there's always a lot of red tape on it but um i think that there's also um you know when you have incentives by by city organizations and governments for taxes and those kind of things that give breaks 

189.77 198.59 B: to building that rather than just tearing it down and building something new it can be reused especially for a community you know for a community program or for a community museum so 

198.34 200.23 A: well that sounds like a great plan 

199.86 204.30 B: uh well we'll see see what happens it's probably the end of the applied trash 

201.98 202.68 A: (( suppose )) 

203.72 210.07 A: (( [laughter] that's a cool name what would that be though m. a. t. it's like you [laughter] )) 

204.78 206.61 B: [laughter] 

207.63 208.94 B: (( m. a. t. )) 

208.95 212.51 B: just just like me well i'm officially m. a. t. is like 

212.29 226.53 B: i was the official artist of the museum so like at first and so that was just uh because when you when you have an idea that you kinda have to cocoon yourself like a um you know like a caterpillar so i kinda just cocooned myself in my own little museum where i expressed 

214.20 215.27 A: okay 

226.40 237.42 B: whatever i could and whatever i felt like with whatever i had and then uh as i was developing idea for the museum then um the whole idea is to kind of turn that umbrella over and give that as an umbrella for other people to use 

237.21 238.41 A: (( oh that sounds )) 

238.66 240.72 B: thanks where where are you from 

238.98 240.29 A: (( very good )) 

240.43 255.13 A: i'm from new york that's why i asked you like i didn't even like automatically whenever i get a phone call i always think it's a new york guy i mean i know this program put us together and stuff but i just always think everybody's from new york i was born here i never le- i left a couple of times like to go 

241.31 242.31 B: oh you are 

251.12 252.97 B: yeah 

255.05 258.33 A: i'm from the city you know like but one of the boroughs [lipsmack] 

257.73 259.54 B: right 

258.40 265.65 A: and like i'd move to westchester or long island but then i'd always come back and you know now i own my home in the bronx

270.50 272.20 B: well i kinda feel 

272.72 276.50 B: i mean i kinda feel what i would like to do is actually have an establishment or have at least have a place 

276.50 288.54 B: in new york and then kind of travel around a bit 'cause there's more i want to see architecturally speaking in like from an educational standpoint and those kinds of things that i like i like to travel also but i want to have europe as like my home 

287.33 291.45 A: well you would have to travel if you were going to make your museum a franchise it has 

289.91 303.11 B: exactly well you know there's two other i have a trilogy of concepts and one is the museum and these other two are also one i think could be for profit and the other one's kind of um a not for profit too it's but it's uh 

303.12 309.07 B: called e._c. squared the evolution of communication center i'm getting ready to submit an idea for the world trade center design

310.70 312.39 B: and that's a not for profit too 

313.21 315.23 B: what is that

362.88 363.69 B: mm 

363.49 366.90 A: so maybe i could help you scout out your locations [laughter] 

365.82 370.15 B: exactly [laughter] we'll be on the reason we have the museum i founded was on fifth 

371.43 372.30 A: (( hello )) 

371.97 373.41 B: (( oh i )) 

372.76 373.97 A: i guess it's over 

373.81 377.73 B: guess it's clicking up yeah um um well 

375.31 376.97 A: (( so what did they say )) 

379.15 381.31 B: guess i don't know what else to say what else do we say 

380.23 387.19 A: no i mean i guess you could we maybe they just like have a timer and maybe that was the five minute mark it doesn't seem like ten minutes 

384.79 386.51 B: (( yeah oh )) 

386.54 389.28 B: yeah it didn't seem like ten minutes went by already 

387.83 390.75 A: you were saying your first museum was on fifth avenue 

389.84 398.04 B: was on fifteenth street i had um i was in a sublease on fifteenth street yeah fifteenth between eighth and ninth 

393.66 394.86 A: in manhattan oh 

396.69 400.86 A: good then you would be very successful because you had prior prior experience 

400.58 411.67 B: yeah you know i mean i had like exhibitions and i gave tours and i have um i mean i have two years of development history for this museum so like this something that like i kinda just i didn't uh i used to work for corporations 

411.69 413.59 B: so i kind of um 

414.16 422.58 B: took the experience i had from working for corporations for marketing and development and marketing of concepts and i took this concept of this museum and then kind of like 

422.60 436.51 B: um developed it as i went along if that makes sense so i made a sign for the window and i started writing about it and i started doing exhibitions and i became like the artist of it and everything was done by press release and so it was cool it was a really great experience 

431.67 433.12 A: (( well that's pretty cool )) 

435.44 438.83 A: you did all the work yourself or did you have a business manager or are 

437.87 439.38 B: i did i did 

441.30 442.79 A: we still there yeah 

442.21 449.01 B: yeah okay it's cutting out again um i do all the work myself and then uh only in the past six months i started a program where 

449.12 451.75 B: i have this thing called communal project affairs 

451.34 452.45 A: mhm 

451.86 454.83 B: communal project affairs are like group activities for adults 

455.14 465.10 B: so what i always intended to kind of like open it up to have other people involved it's just that like at first when i first started doing it i didn't do it i needed to do it kind of figured out what i was doing 

465.04 471.50 B: so then um when i opened this communal project affair the first communal project affair we did was called world leader deaf duck goof 

471.25 472.15 A: okay 

471.95 478.52 B: and for that like um other people became involved i got a foundations directive for the museum and hung out with 

478.50 488.30 B: and like um jany blaylock is another guy who's a visual arts director and like i have a director of photography named and like all these people who kind of became involved in the museum 

488.14 493.46 A: so you would definitely be very successful if you had all the money you wanted and you could open your museum 

491.38 500.20 B: [laughter] yeah if i had investment like if um you know i'm trying to figure out how to get that whole investment grant thing going because it's not something i'm 

499.97 508.71 B: um i'm i'm better at the producer side of it and the and the running of it it's just trying to get the the money and trying to survive with all the kind of hitch 

508.86 509.85 A: yeah 

509.00 510.34 B: that became the 

509.91 514.68 A: but remember they said we'd have all the money we wanted [laughter] if you had all the money you wanted 

512.62 517.82 B: i know if i didn't have to worry about that it'd be perfect [laughter] you know i could just go 

516.57 529.72 A: i know myself even if i had all the money i wanted i'd have to really be focused like i just have so many other things that i'm interested in that unless i could devote my full time and energy to my business 

529.95 539.30 A: [lipsmack] i don't think i'd be successful because i would always put my family first you know that's why i thought of something with kids you know because then i could go to the school and [laughter] you know 

533.48 534.33 B: mm 

538.00 541.30 B: right how's how big's your family 

540.22 547.80 A: no i don't have any children yet i have dogs there i have three dogs that are my kids actually i have two and i kept a puppy my dog had puppies 

543.52 544.99 B: you have three dogs 

546.34 548.43 B: oh what kind of dogs 

548.26 550.52 A: uh i have a norwegian elkhound 

550.88 556.29 A: [lipsmack] i have a husky mix and the elkhound she had a puppy with a cocker spaniel 

553.54 559.36 B: mhm oh well see dogs are like kind of like training for children anyway 

559.21 571.12 A: well yeah to say it's like i have permanent toddlers and the puppy's six months old today but no i plan on um having a family so i don't think i would be a successful businessperson because i would devote more of my time to my family 

563.88 565.02 B: (( ooh )) 

570.48 573.71 B: yeah i think that would be tough i think at the moment for me i'm i 

573.79 579.91 B: kinda feel like i don't even know how good in a relationship i'd be if given the opportunity to kind of run my business i'd really 

580.00 581.04 B: um 

580.53 590.42 A: well you're also a man so you're not as [laughter] isn't that politically incorrect you're still expected to like give birth and you know take that extra time and energy 

582.89 587.32 B: yeah no it's totally but you're totally right on 

589.28 599.95 B: yeah yeah you know i mean it's like and it's it's not necessarily i mean we i didn't make the the society that we're in it's just the but it there is definitely an effect of it you know like
