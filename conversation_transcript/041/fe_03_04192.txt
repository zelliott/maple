123.45 130.58 A: it's just some- you know it's just something like if if money wasn't ever an object those are two things that i think i would be interested in

141.27 142.27 B: (( [mn] hm )) 

142.45 156.31 B: well let's see uh i'm a photographer so [lipsmack] i guess my number one if i really could make a you know lucrative living off of this would be opening a photography studio but i wouldn't wanna do 

156.36 169.89 B: kind of portraits and you know bad head shots but more along the lines of being hired to shoot events maybe not necessarily you know just wedding events but all sorts of different you know 

169.99 182.78 B: movie openings or you know political the democratic republican conventions or more exciting and more photojournalistic oriented um [lipsmack] news events and getting hired 

182.77 191.28 B: um [lipsmack] i guess that would be my business aspiration i would rather actually work for a publication but if i could open my own business i would like to do that um 

191.37 195.82 B: [lipsmack] maybe i don't know there's a lotta things i'm interested in uh 

196.17 199.95 B: i guess i guess photography that would be fun to play with 

200.22 202.26 B: um maybe also some sort of 

202.50 216.02 B: um [lipsmack] law office i don't i'm interested in working for uh american civil liberties union so maybe somehow incorporating that into a business opportunity i don't know if that's possible but 

216.64 218.10 B: (( perhaps [sigh] )) 

218.13 220.09 B: um yeah 

218.20 219.36 A: yeah that's 

219.69 222.25 A: that sounds really interesting actually um 

222.51 229.66 A: i'd love photography like i wish you know i'd paid more attention to it when i took photography classes in school 'cause i'm really 

222.69 224.00 B: yeah 

229.68 231.99 A: interested in that i think that's a great idea 

232.06 234.95 B: yeah yeah it is it's wonderful 

232.34 233.32 A: um 

235.82 237.24 A: um 

237.09 238.21 B: (( i d- )) 

237.74 240.64 A: that's pretty interesting that you're right where do you live 

240.56 244.99 B: um i'm from san francisco originally but i i go to u._c._l._a. right now 

244.49 253.63 A: oh you do uh one of my um best friends went to u._c._l._a. and worked for or did a lot of stuff with the a._c._l._u. as well so [noise] interesting 

253.00 261.79 B: oh cool yeah it's hard to get involved with a._c._l._u. i've been trying to email them but they seem a little a little preoccupied at the moment 

261.43 263.50 A: (( yeah they always have a lot of )) 

262.71 266.36 B: but um it's pretty cool so do you go to school down here 

266.14 271.63 A: prospects um i graduated from u._c. santa barbara in uh two thousand 

269.14 270.52 B: oh okay 

271.65 274.98 A: so i i live at huntingdon beach and i'm just working right now 

271.67 272.52 B: okay 

275.27 278.27 B: okay um are you working within a business or 

275.87 276.86 A: so 

278.52 281.22 A: um within like the bridal industry 

281.27 282.86 B: (( or yeah or )) 

281.34 285.75 A: or with uh um [mn] i mean just to like 

285.84 296.93 A: pertain to the topic i guess um i have in like after i graduated and i was traveling quite a bit i worked in a salon for a while and totally had a blast um 

288.70 289.26 B: (( [mn] )) 

296.45 297.55 B: that's cool 

296.94 302.26 A: but i would never wanna own a salon i would definitely wanna be more in the manufacturing end just because 

302.27 311.14 A: it's so labor intensive um being on the retail end and there is a really high cost involved in that end um 

305.06 305.98 B: (( right )) 

311.18 320.94 A: and also i'm just generally a pretty creative person and way more interested in um like creating than just turing around and so i am a terrible salesperson 

317.73 318.73 B: right 

320.98 329.32 B: oh definitely [laughter] yeah i definitely would wanna be on the creative end i was thinking about going into design you know advertising and 

321.27 322.21 A: (( so )) 

322.74 323.62 A: [laughter] 

329.44 337.35 B: definitely would wanna be on the creative end of that so that's really cool do you design anything else besides uh bridal wear or [noise] 

332.17 333.21 A: yeah 

337.39 342.14 A: i my mom's an artist and i mean i've been interested in art my whole life um 

339.27 340.40 B: (( oh okay )) 

341.60 343.50 B: right 

342.36 354.25 A: but in terms of like what kind of stuff i have done yeah it's mostly just like one of my friends got married two weeks ago and i um embroidered and made her whole like veil and headpiece 

345.86 346.42 B: (( [noise] )) 

350.26 351.74 B: (( [noise] oh [noise] )) 

353.48 356.99 B: [lipsmack] oh that's cool [noise] that's wow [noise] 

355.48 356.76 A: so um 

357.40 370.14 A: stuff like that and how [lipsmack] i initially planned my sister and i were planning on carrying that in actually into a business plan we went up and got all the stuff to make a lot of prototypes in downtown l._a. and um 

364.80 366.77 B: mhm 

370.58 382.59 A: what we were planning on doing is in the industry you just make samples and then people m- people that you know you take orders on them and we were hoping to have some trenches and have stuff have the ball ball really rolling by now 

377.16 377.99 B: right 

382.58 390.63 A: but we've both just been super busy with uh you know our separate lives we haven't really been able to get on it but i think initially i 

387.44 388.40 B: right 

389.22 392.65 B: (( that st- what )) 

391.65 402.32 A: think initially like the most important thing behind being able to do it is just being able to get like your samples made and then from there i think it will it will all take off really really quickly 

393.00 394.45 B: right 

398.32 399.36 B: right 

402.39 407.03 B: right start up costs must be pretty intense too i 

407.09 412.56 B: mean where would you get that that kind of in- that beginning money from where 

412.63 420.93 A: but well um i don't know i mean hypothetically like for the purpose of this you know okay it's already there but um 

418.73 419.52 B: right 

421.10 430.84 A: i don't know i mean we were just personally investing and but we haven't even applied for our business licenses like everything that we put into the business 

431.19 433.66 A: or you know what we wanted to become a business 

432.95 435.42 B: mhm 

433.81 444.38 A: hasn't we haven't had any return on 'cause normally we could use it as a write off but the fiscal end has already ended and we never applied for our business licence so that's the end of that but um 

442.38 443.36 B: right 

444.45 447.42 A: probably just like a small business loan 

447.48 454.53 A: and possibly our parents my my dad's a business owner so he i'm sure he would be willing to put up some money 

447.77 448.64 B: okay 

455.14 456.38 A: (( but um [lipsmack] )) 

455.46 456.19 B: (( oh )) 

457.10 464.20 B: that's cool um i wonder what else should address i don't know owning a business [sigh] 

464.66 472.14 B: i don't know if i've ever really considered that as something i necessarily wanted to do but rather work within an industry or 

472.19 484.35 B: or some form or organization that actually running a business seems to take a little too much economic knowledge and mathematics and i'm more into history and art history and 

484.46 486.51 B: it's not really my field 

484.58 485.54 A: yeah 

486.61 495.61 A: i think that it's definitely not for everyone but like i think that if you really have a passion for something the returns on owning your own business are so much greater than like 

489.40 491.08 B: yeah 

494.90 497.08 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

495.64 498.21 A: for instance if you're working for someone 

498.00 499.76 B: mhm 

498.17 505.77 A: you know you can't necessarily do exactly what you wanna do with the business you you really have to go along with their model and their business plan and their vision 

501.70 503.05 B: right 

505.73 519.84 A: and and that's the real advantage of owning your own is that you create your own vision and you know you do what you want with it so that's and also you know time wise once things start become more to become more established and 

505.94 506.92 B: right 

513.62 515.49 B: right right 

519.84 527.08 A: successful you really have an opportunity to also take time off and do other things with your life like i love to travel and 

525.77 526.47 B: (( [noise] )) 

527.05 541.85 A: one of the things that i really admire about my dad owning a business is that he's been able to travel so much and you know he's taking the whole month of june this year 'cause he wants to go to europe like that's great you know i wanna be able to do that say i wanna be able to take time for my family and stuff so 

535.09 536.38 B: right 

536.57 538.69 B: yeah that sounds great 

541.79 545.68 B: that's that's really great there's also you know the ability if you're working within 

545.75 550.63 B: [mn] an institution and be able to shape it you know if you're working for 

550.53 563.26 B: some fabulous like [mn] new york times or you know smithsonian or something you have the ability to to change this huge grand institution which is also pretty phenomenal 

561.72 564.48 A: yeah i know that's definitely totally i'm 

564.55 568.37 A: able to and take some yeah i've taken the existing institution 

568.34 573.42 A: but just from my experience and working with different organizations there's a lotta red tape in doing so 

573.03 574.42 B: right of course 

573.26 576.86 A: and if it's a small c- if it's a small company or small organization 

576.69 583.49 A: you you have a lot more leeway but if you are working with something that big there's so much red tape that it's like by the time that 

583.30 592.82 A: your idea gets to final end it may be eighteen steps away from what you initially wanted out of it so 

592.24 594.49 B: right right 

592.80 599.95 A: and that that can be great or that can be frustrating and that's all just part of the learning curve of working in you know different kinds of companies but
