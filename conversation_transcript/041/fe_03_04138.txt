16.66 17.90 B: so

22.06 23.71 A: yep that's right 

23.18 25.25 B: okay well what do you think 

24.99 33.23 A: um if money was no object uh i've been thinking about a lot of businesses i might start on my own lately but money is an object so 

32.97 34.26 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

33.64 39.78 A: um [cough] i don't know if money was no object maybe i'd start like a book publishing company or something

43.40 47.38 B: yeah are you an editor or a writer

58.96 61.09 B: yeah 

59.65 61.87 A: yeah so 

61.20 64.05 B: well i i think i'd open a music store

65.75 66.72 B: okay 

66.23 67.86 A: um are you a musician

70.94 73.95 B: [lipsmack] yeah i used to be a semi pro but now i 

74.14 78.12 B: got into other types of business but i think i'd open a music store 

78.37 81.94 B: and i could have electric and acoustic um 

78.40 79.30 A: yeah 

82.99 85.26 B: like guitars and so on 

84.58 86.72 A: yeah that would be a good business 

86.92 87.76 B: yeah 

87.02 91.02 A: um i was also thinking about a a record company which would be 

90.14 91.19 B: oh 

91.09 95.50 A: just putting out records and put out whoever you feel like putting out 

93.00 93.99 B: (( mm )) 

94.95 102.50 B: yeah that right see we could work together on that i'll supply the musicians with instruments [laughter] 

95.91 97.88 A: something that like something 

98.68 99.85 A: there you go 

100.97 106.58 A: exactly something where you can help some deserving people out and creative people so 

104.70 109.49 B: yeah yeah and at the store i could have 

109.76 110.87 B: a club 

111.02 112.59 A: yeah absolutely 

112.08 116.67 B: yeah and we can showcase the musicians on the label 

113.44 114.65 A: (( hang out with the )) 

116.37 117.39 A: there you go 

117.11 118.43 B: [laughter] 

117.61 119.42 A: (( that sounds like a good business )) 

119.12 120.66 B: (( [laughter] all right )) 

119.85 122.01 A: especially if money's no object so 

121.86 124.52 B: right right there's no problem there 

122.80 123.60 A: yeah 

124.05 131.69 A: yeah um yeah i i i the i mean of course the idea of starting a business appeals to me too you know working for myself 

131.83 135.95 A: not working for someone else so yeah i think i'd i'd put more effort into that than 

131.98 133.76 B: yeah 

136.39 137.89 B: (( hm )) 

136.40 138.88 A: just a job working for somebody else you know 

138.24 144.03 B: okay so you think people with their own businesses work harder than like payroll employees 

143.33 144.72 A: i think so 

144.45 145.37 B: okay 

145.83 148.03 B: now i was wondering 

148.56 152.84 B: what i'm thinking about is would i have a staff you know or could i do it all myself 

152.64 154.69 A: i think you have to have a staff wouldn't you 

155.09 159.11 B: well at least something 'cause i mean i'm not good at accounting for instance 

159.21 168.85 A: yeah see i mean i don't know if i'm very good at accounting but it just seems like your own business it's your own money and it's you know it's it's very concrete it's not like abstract numbers it's like 

160.21 160.77 B: (( [mn] )) 

164.31 165.80 B: yeah 

168.54 170.58 B: well yeah 

169.12 172.29 A: i think that it's i think it'd be different that way 

171.01 171.96 B: okay 

172.11 173.36 B: good point 

172.87 175.80 A: (( but you know that that that's i don't know that's the way i see it )) 

175.53 185.52 B: yeah you know a person would pay attention if we had um you know had to do our own ordering shipping receiving sales all that kind of stuff 

182.21 183.04 A: yeah 

184.54 186.01 A: exactly 

185.40 192.64 B: yeah well of course money's no object here so maybe we don't have to worry about that [laughter] [laughter] 

188.72 191.03 A: (( right yeah i i guess not )) 

191.60 193.27 A: money's no object so 

192.68 193.75 B: (( yeah [cough] )) 

194.50 200.67 A: um yeah i think you need a staff and you need people to unless you wanna work in your store you know seven days a week and 

199.43 204.16 B: mhm [lipsmack] yep opening closing cleaning and all that kinda stuff 

202.56 203.73 A: all the hard 

203.75 204.95 A: yeah 

205.20 207.67 B: 'cause i couldn't do it seven days a week you know 

206.92 208.66 A: (( yeah no absolutely [cough] )) 

208.09 209.98 B: three sixty five no way 

209.83 213.11 A: now i have a friend that's thinking about opening a video store and she 

213.25 215.91 A: she's saying she'd have to hire at least one person you know 

215.83 222.01 B: oh yeah well videos it seemed like you'd have to be open you know many hours a day 

216.62 217.46 A: uh 

221.68 225.09 A: [mn] right right that would be a a tough business i think 

224.70 225.73 B: mhm 

225.24 225.96 A: (( you know )) 

226.32 227.21 A: (( i don't know )) 

227.09 229.01 B: yeah there'd be some long hours 

228.67 229.88 A: yeah 

229.25 231.67 B: it seem like that'd be tough to do all by yourself 

231.34 232.50 A: that would be 

232.22 235.66 B: yeah mhm 

232.56 233.85 A: (( that'd be tough )) 

235.23 241.33 A: um yeah another one i was actually thinking about very very seriously was uh practice spaces 

241.72 242.90 A: (( and it seemed )) 

242.26 244.42 B: oh for a musicians to practice 

244.00 250.83 A: yeah 'cause the neighborhood i live in there's tons and tons of musicians and there aren't enough places to practice so see we looked at it we 

248.90 249.85 B: wow 

250.88 256.32 A: i was with my friends and we had a band and we saw this building and we said we gotta call them you know see how much they want for it 

254.78 255.94 B: yeah 

256.41 259.17 A: build some rooms soundproof them and there you go 

258.58 260.34 B: yeah 

259.24 260.95 A: now that would a good business 

260.69 261.86 B: okay 

261.52 263.71 A: li- you know not a lot of work 

263.19 265.19 B: yeah what city are you in 

264.90 266.47 A: i'm in new york 

266.05 267.52 B: in new york okay 

267.84 270.33 B: um i'm in a small town in minnesota 

269.91 270.79 A: (( yeah oh )) 

270.85 271.90 B: right 

272.00 278.93 B: so there's no much demand there but th- for you it'd be far more practical it sounds like [cough] 

277.25 281.97 A: oh yeah i mean i'm i'm i'm thinking very very seriously about it so 

281.75 282.88 B: (( mm-kay )) 

282.91 287.14 B: how much rent could you think you could charge like by the hour or weekly or s- 

286.16 292.87 A: um well we have a space um and it's a small room and it's eight hundred dollars a month 

292.58 294.02 B: oh my god 

293.30 298.18 A: yeah so what usually happens is you know like four bands will go in on it and split it 

297.47 298.57 B: okay 

298.43 300.19 A: and ration out the time and everything 

300.19 301.38 B: (( yeah )) 

300.60 305.24 A: so but yeah i mean you get a building make some rooms eight hundred bucks a month 

302.80 303.72 B: uh 

304.84 305.88 B: okay 

305.90 308.51 B: now would they have access to it all hours 

308.50 311.64 A: i think so yeah i just give them the keys and there you go 

309.61 310.56 B: okay 

311.31 317.52 B: okay right so they'd have keys they'd have you know they could get in the building get in the room and so on whenever they needed to 

315.91 316.58 A: (( right )) 

316.85 318.60 A: exactly 

317.64 318.60 B: okay 

319.39 323.32 A: yeah so there wouldn't be anyone sitting there you know letting people in or anything it's 

319.42 320.28 B: yeah 

323.99 325.03 A: (( just they have a key )) 

324.30 329.35 B: mm-kay yeah as long as you could trust 'em to you know just use the room 

328.94 331.12 A: yeah yeah 

331.26 339.28 B: point well see now we could have the music store the the club the practice rooms and the music publishing 

337.13 338.23 A: (( so there you go )) 

338.55 340.10 A: recording studio 

339.54 344.69 B: recording yeah do it all [laughter] 

342.16 343.49 A: self contained 

345.19 346.85 B: that's very good 

346.19 347.60 A: yeah so 

348.54 350.31 A: but money is an object 

350.40 352.60 B: [lipsmack] well yeah in the real world 

350.69 351.37 A: (( so )) 

351.49 352.09 A: (( [cough] yeah )) 

353.07 354.28 A: so you play guitar 

354.62 356.63 B: yeah i play guitar and mandolin 

356.34 358.28 A: oh wow mandolin that's a 

358.35 360.78 A: a very minnesota instrument i guess 

360.59 361.54 B: (( ha ha )) 

361.89 366.59 B: i was in bands uh blue grass state bands when i lived in georgia for a while 

366.36 367.47 A: (( oh that's cool mhm )) 

366.87 369.17 B: but i'm not from there i was just visiting 

369.48 371.29 B: just visiting down there 

371.41 378.38 B: for some time but see the mandolin can be used for both those instruments can be used for lots of many different kinds of music 

377.73 378.93 A: yeah 

378.85 381.28 B: it's up to the you know it's up to the player 

381.13 382.15 A: (( yeah )) 

382.50 383.71 B: what they can do 

383.31 386.25 A: yeah yeah i haven't played too much mandolin it seems 

386.60 389.99 A: it seems so small you know i have big hands big fingers and it 

389.48 390.77 B: mhm 

390.81 394.43 B: it's the same pitch and uh tuning as a violin 

393.84 395.70 A: (( and i oh okay )) 

395.47 398.82 B: yeah so it is um 

399.33 403.89 B: as far as the intervals never had any problem with that going back and forth 

403.25 405.56 A: yeah huh 

405.24 405.97 B: (( [cough] )) 

406.20 410.58 A: so it's been is it it's sorta like the guitar i mean tune the tuning 

406.43 407.19 B: (( so it )) 

409.85 417.62 B: it does have frets it has um [lipsmack] you have four notes e. a. d. g. but they're tuned in doubles 

411.72 413.47 A: right but the 

417.52 418.61 A: right 

418.03 421.60 B: but they're unison so it's not like a twelve fret guitar that's in octaves 

421.18 422.48 A: yeah huh 

422.20 428.26 B: they're in unison so and the e. on the mandolin is an octave above the high e. on a guitar 

427.82 429.19 A: (( oh okay that )) 

428.64 430.39 B: mhm so that's the pitch 

430.22 431.32 A: (( makes it easy hm )) 

432.32 434.17 B: but it's possible i mean 

434.21 436.75 B: it's a it's a good sound 

435.50 437.43 A: yeah yeah it's a great sound 

436.90 437.86 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

439.91 442.18 A: yeah don't see too many of those in new york 

442.20 448.70 B: is that right now there is uh some places i've always wanted to go in new york is a place called mandolin brothers 

443.46 444.08 A: (( no )) 

448.23 450.95 A: yep that's on staten island right 

450.49 452.70 B: i think so you've heard of 'em 

451.09 451.81 A: (( i believe )) 

452.09 454.59 A: i have heard of 'em yeah and people 

453.16 458.20 B: okay 'cause they sell they sell of course all kinds of instruments guitars or

565.91 571.11 B: what how big is this building that you might go into f- or look at for the practice rooms 

570.82 580.78 A: um the place that we were looking at it was we we were practising in this one building there was a building next to it that was for rent and it looks like an old garage like an old auto body garage so 

578.47 579.57 B: oh 

580.57 581.56 B: uh 

580.89 588.47 A: it might have some problems it might be dirty it might be need to be cleaned but you know it'd be nice if you can just build the the walls and soundproof it and 

587.98 588.91 B: okay 

588.65 594.26 A: i have a friend who's an architect and he's done that kind of stuff before and he said yeah sure it wouldn't be too hard so 

591.41 592.41 B: (( oh okay )) 

593.66 597.96 B: yeah so it would be one room or could you divide it up 

597.46 599.90 A: well it's i mean i think right now it's just a big
