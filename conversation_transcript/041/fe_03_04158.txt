1.31 3.38 A: hello this is james 

1.96 2.94 B: (( hello )) 

2.97 4.65 B: hi my name's jill 

4.60 6.11 A: how're you doing 

5.53 6.84 B: (( good how are you )) 

6.61 8.54 A: doing excellent 

8.58 14.76 A: uh so i guess you could start on this thing uh [laughter] so uh you're a business owner what would you do 

15.08 17.23 B: i was just trying to think um 

17.76 22.42 B: something in retail probably like a sporting goods store i think 

22.03 24.77 A: (( could you hold on a second while i turn the volume up on my phone )) 

24.28 25.28 B: okay 

25.04 25.68 A: (( [noise] )) 

28.37 30.44 A: all right so still thinking retail 

30.17 33.84 B: yes i think i'd do like a sporting goods store or something 

33.60 36.34 A: really a chain or just a single store 

35.86 39.34 B: uh probably just a single store 

39.65 42.75 A: and why do you think you'd wanna go into sporting goods or retail 

42.39 54.42 B: um well i'm certainly active and i enjoy you know camping hiking outdoor types of things like sports so it's kind of an area that you know i have a lot of interest in so 

53.87 57.79 A: and so you have background and you know like a lot about it and that kind of thing 

56.24 61.17 B: right i could at least be somewhat knowledgeable on the stuff i was selling [laughter] 

59.20 62.18 A: [laughter] 

62.73 66.15 A: cool well uh i think 

64.99 66.74 B: what about yourself oh 

66.48 68.50 A: i think that uh 

68.47 73.30 A: actually i've no knowledge or background on this at all but i think i'd like to open up a restaurant [laughter] 

72.42 73.75 B: really 

73.18 88.14 A: yeah i think it'd be um i think it'd be a nice experience you know you i'd feel like a lot of people can can input their whole uh sweat blood and tears you know that kind of thing into a restaurant and it's very personal like kinda thing i feel like and uh 

88.02 95.24 A: i don't know it'd be like a restaurant where i always serve foods that i like as opposed to these places that like i don't know placate you know 

95.23 104.89 A: um i don't know all the random like normal things i'd have a very eclectic um mix i think and hopefully attract people there like me 

101.88 103.05 B: (( [cough] right what )) 

104.35 109.47 B: yeah um like what kinds of foods do you like what would be some of your top menu choices 

105.78 108.41 A: [laughter] 

109.17 116.19 A: oh definitely like a lot of meat and potatoes kind of thing i'm from kansas so it'd kind of be something uh 

112.53 113.60 B: okay 

114.69 117.74 B: [laughter] down home cooking [laughter] 

116.95 129.34 A: exactly see i'd have meat and potatoes and then i'd have deep dish style chicago style pizza 'cause you can't find that anywhere besides chicago and it's it's amazing if you get the right stuff 

128.53 131.34 B: i've never had it but it sounds good [laughter] 

130.38 131.70 A: you've never had it 

131.47 133.56 B: well not like the real stuff 

132.97 145.86 A: if you ever go to chicago try giadonalds pizza you'd never forget it like it's amazing um but yeah based on giadonalds style pizza and uh i don't know just lots of lots of random things like uh like 

136.65 137.72 B: (( all right )) 

145.89 147.37 A: like a lot of uh 

147.41 154.12 A: like mexican food and yeah i don't know i i i feel like um 

155.36 167.79 A: as a business owner i think i would be i have a pretty good mind on myself like i could probably like run a business well and know what kinda people would be good be working there but i just don't know about the mechanics of actually like managing people 'cause 

167.67 171.56 A: um i'm fairly young i haven't really uh managed people before so 

171.58 174.58 A: (( um how are you gonna handle that )) 

173.58 184.19 B: um i would need lots of help from [laughter] someone i i'm fairly young too and i think i would actually probably do okay with the managing people but i have no 

178.75 179.61 A: (( uh-huh )) 

184.37 190.33 B: kind of background in business i wouldn't know how to get started anything like that so i would certainly need 

191.36 197.00 A: so that's funny like yeah [laughter] i think it's kind of funny that we both uh 

191.38 193.86 B: someone behind me [laughter] 

196.82 210.24 A: um both fairly young and both uh are have a minimum amounts of funds here to do whatever business we want and we're opening like an athletics store and a restaurant both of which i i don't feel need all that much capital to start off with 

205.63 206.62 B: yeah 

209.77 210.62 B: right 

210.71 211.27 B: (( [cough] )) 

211.35 221.55 A: so like let's say you got your first business and it was going well what do you do after that are you just like it's like stand in the store or do you like build more stores or what do you do 

221.29 232.86 B: i would maybe try building another store like in a neighboring town um and you know hopefully finding a good manager and then i'd pop back and forth to both stores so 

224.94 225.93 A: uh-huh 

233.02 236.60 B: yeah just kind of dabble in it as long as it's successful i guess 

236.22 237.31 A: uh-huh 

237.93 240.70 A: yeah i don't know i i think that i would uh 

240.99 242.05 A: um 

242.09 246.54 A: i'd definitely open up more stores but i wouldn't open up more than i could like keep a handle on 

246.03 247.02 B: right 

247.36 248.99 A: just because uh 

249.16 260.12 A: i don't know i feel like the the whole like draw to business is like really adds character and like once you start like want to get off here your control it loses like that flavor and that character so 

259.88 260.74 B: yeah 

260.87 272.14 A: at least that's my feeling on it like if i was gonna open something up i'd want to be very unique and very like original and like some of something like like going there saying this is a very unique place never been to a place like this before but 

272.25 274.45 A: i like it and i wanna come back you know 

274.19 275.53 B: right 

275.15 278.63 A: but [lipsmack] but who knows i don't know 

277.66 286.49 B: definitely like the appeal for restaurants for me is that very thing i don't like the big chain restaurants where they're all the same type of deal so 

284.08 285.11 A: uh-huh 

286.85 292.50 A: yeah i could just imagine you know like getting married at some point and like you know having like the 

292.51 304.21 A: mom and pop like restaurant store like both you cooking in the back you know like running people around have your kids like washing dishes and stuff like i could see that kinda life like that's 

296.87 298.37 B: yep [laughter] 

303.25 305.85 B: yeah just like a family run business 

305.27 308.94 A: exactly [laughter] where're you from originally 

307.14 308.01 B: cool 

309.03 310.14 B: (( idaho )) 

309.89 311.53 A: idaho okay 

310.47 313.72 B: yeah and are you in kansas right now you said 

313.54 316.82 A: um i'm originally from kansas but i'm in d._c. right now 

314.97 316.00 B: okay 

316.15 317.32 B: oh wow 

316.99 320.27 A: yeah so i got out of the midwest but [laughter] i 

320.51 333.60 A: still miss it it's still uh hometown to me yeah so uh let's say you had to open up something bigger like um a worldwide organization what kind of thing would you go into like for me it'd be like 

322.54 323.80 B: (( so yeah [laughter] )) 

332.10 333.77 B: oh my goodness [laughter] 

333.63 335.11 A: large scale 

335.98 338.40 B: i have no idea uh 

337.58 339.66 A: [laughter] 

339.61 343.38 B: yeah i don't even know where i'd start [laughter] what about yourself 

341.41 344.82 A: why is that so much harder to think about 

344.95 345.95 B: (( [laughter] pardon )) 

345.72 347.83 A: why is that so much harder to think about 

347.64 349.04 B: (( i don't know i guess )) 

352.26 358.44 B: i have so little background in like the business world i'm a teacher that's what i do um yeah 

356.67 358.92 A: oh really yeah my mom's a teacher 

358.45 362.82 B: oh yes so [lipsmack] i don't know i'm kinda focused on like 

362.90 368.31 B: in the classroom my own surroundings kind of what's going on in my own little world that's thinking 

368.40 372.31 B: large scale business is sort of foreign to me um um 

370.13 371.22 A: uh-huh 

371.49 385.59 A: [laughter] well wouldn't well how 'bout like would you ever want to start like some kind of like um like nationwide montessori like i don't know like um private teaching school that kind of thing like 

385.62 388.51 A: would you want to do anything in that kind of interest or would you uh 

387.53 401.06 B: i don't know if i'd wanna do something like that but maybe some kind of non-profit organization that you know i don't know teach you know for adult literacy teaching adults to read i don't know how i would fund it or anything but 

392.70 393.75 A: uh-huh 

400.65 403.48 A: hey money is no option here come on [laughter] 

401.88 410.66 B: my that's right money is no option here i guess i can dream big so yeah i guess it would be some kinda like i don't know maybe social work sort of 

405.29 406.16 A: uh-huh 

410.81 415.14 B: driven there helping like adult non-readers learn to read 

418.11 425.56 A: i think if i uh if i had if i was really trying to think like large scale like big time things i'd probably go with um 

425.65 433.54 A: like a venture capital company you know something like i mean they basically run off like this the only thing they do is like deal with money right 

427.47 428.51 B: (( so okay )) 

433.37 438.24 A: and they get to uh be involved in all the new technologies get to be involved in all the 

438.05 448.68 A: big things coming out and people just come begging begging you like all the time like please give me this give me that like you're i don't know i'd just feel like so much fun like i don't know your own own little uh 

441.78 442.46 B: (( [laughter] )) 

448.80 455.49 A: god world i guess i guess it's not a good thing to say but [laughter] i grant you funding but 

450.04 452.93 B: just so you can turn 'em down or say yes 

454.45 456.02 B: [laughter] 

455.59 457.09 A: uh it'd be fun 

457.39 459.13 A: it could be an interesting job 

458.90 460.34 B: yeah it could 

459.99 463.81 A: yeah that's the kind of job i think i'd fail at very quickly so 

463.16 464.44 B: [laughter] 

464.01 467.94 A: [laughter] the way i manage money probably probably the worst 

467.75 468.34 B: (( oh )) 

468.77 469.98 A: but um 

470.66 474.85 A: but yeah i'm i'm actually in a research organization now so we do 

474.04 475.16 B: (( okay i was )) 

475.14 477.19 A: research and stuff so 

476.50 481.02 B: gonna say um so like medical research or what kind of research 

479.86 485.56 A: um we do business research so we do research for the most of the fortune five hundred kind of thing 

481.97 482.93 B: okay 

484.80 486.02 B: oh wow 

485.66 494.81 A: um but i'm just like starting to learn the business world and uh i i think like down the road i would like to open up my own business and that kinda thing but 

494.77 504.32 A: uh i don't know like i remember like in in college my friends and i always thought about opening up some kind of like um like web design service or 

504.24 516.78 A: um we always thought like if there was like some kind of service that came to your dorm room and would like pick up laundry like do it and bring it back to you like that'd be worth millions if we could figure out a way to do that 

513.62 518.21 B: [laughter] yeah that'd be fantastic i'd be the first customer [laughter] 

517.69 528.70 A: yeah [laughter] but we never figured out a way to do it like uh for a reasonable amount of money and like count on college student for like your paycheck is probably like a really risky thing 

527.90 529.88 B: yeah [laughter] 

528.89 531.11 A: [laughter] so uh 

531.48 536.02 A: so yeah we talked about trying to think up uh business ideas i mean we never came up with anything really big 

536.92 544.40 A: oh this is what i'd do i figured out this is what i'd really do if i had all the money in the world i'd start up my own like 

540.66 542.05 B: (( oh okay )) 

544.43 545.88 A: video 

545.86 560.43 A: like editing business where people could bring in like all their videos right you know and it's like cut this down to uh a two hour highlight reel and we'd have to sit there and go through all their stuff and make like the ultimate video for them and their family 

560.29 570.23 A: and i think that'd be like so much fun like it it's i'm really into like digital video and like something like that and um i don't think i'd ever have like the background to be able to do it professionally for like 

568.85 569.49 B: (( [cough] )) 

570.19 577.57 A: um a a corporation or something but i mean i think that a lot love old v._h._s. tapes lying around 

576.74 578.00 B: oh yeah 

577.62 578.97 A: so uh 

578.57 581.81 B: (( that's kind of a cool idea [laughter] )) 

580.11 587.10 A: yeah [laughter] and like to a lot of people those memories are really worth a lot but they just don't have a way to access them you know 

586.40 591.99 B: yeah and yeah like a shortened highlight reel would be the way to go 

587.36 588.29 A: so maybe 

592.08 596.10 B: sit down and watch you know twenty hours of tape 

593.94 595.14 A: exactly 

595.59 599.95 A: uh-huh [laughter] or like even like a d._v._d. service you mean it'd be 

599.20 599.89 B: (( [laughter] ))
