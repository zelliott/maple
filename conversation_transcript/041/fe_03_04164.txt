163.51 169.77 A: yeah that's interesting um i was thinking of something a little more mid towards mid income people

171.72 175.05 B: [lipsmack] well what kind of clothing would you wanna sell

183.75 188.59 A: women from you know eighteen till probably 

188.80 195.56 A: forty i guess and you know something more fashionable and and i don't just wanna sell clothing i wanna sell lingerie 

195.90 201.94 A: and i wanna i i i i want to sell you know things that they can't get in other stores 

201.99 207.47 A: you know uh and you know probably design get have my own designers 

207.82 208.90 A: you know what i mean 

208.96 212.57 B: [sigh] [sigh] yes there there's only one thing 

210.40 211.69 A: yeah so 

212.60 213.61 A: mhm 

212.61 218.34 B: i i live in new york there is nothing that you can't get in stores in this city [sigh] 

218.04 223.97 A: well yes but it's it's very expensive and um for example i mean i travel a lot 

223.80 235.39 A: so if you go to places like asia you can get a lot of different varieties a very wide range of variety at very you know at a very low p- uh low cost and it's it's a lot cheaper 

234.90 242.61 B: yes there's only one thing when you're d- dealing with the asians and you're having them make up things for you you have to um 

242.70 243.73 B: commit 

244.26 246.12 B: to large quantities 

246.29 254.33 B: uh when i was in mens wear and we had we were having shirts manufactured in asia 

249.25 250.39 A: mhm

254.50 256.82 B: you had to order three hundred dozen 

257.24 269.38 A: really well i i don't think i will have that problem because i'm from there [laughter] uh so you know i'll um i'll i'll probably be able to find connections with um smaller manufacturers 

257.96 258.90 B: yes 

269.96 273.43 A: so i don't think we'll need to order so much 

271.62 276.01 B: well well i guess it's because i worked for major manufacturers 

275.40 277.36 A: yeah that's different to 

276.67 278.96 B: i i worked for wrangler 

278.90 281.07 A: mhm oh okay i see 

281.12 282.18 B: um

314.96 319.63 B: with some of the top manufacturers when you're dealing with top manufacturers 

319.43 320.57 A: mhm 

319.93 323.41 B: you have them come in and do sh- um 

325.13 332.10 B: [lipsmack] do shows in your stores uh one of my father's clients manufactures women's clothing 

327.19 328.05 A: right 

332.12 333.04 A: right 

332.61 338.75 B: she does she goes to the department stores she has her own fashion show she has 

338.79 345.26 B: her samples and the women buy off the samples because department stores will not 

346.49 347.44 B: hello 

347.14 348.68 A: yeah i'm here i'm here 

347.78 350.96 B: uh i'm ignoring that call coming in uh 

350.33 351.09 A: oh 

351.49 354.17 B: department stores will not stock 

354.08 355.28 A: mhm 

354.63 356.71 B: a fifteen hundred dollar 

357.03 359.06 B: piece of cl- clothing 

359.26 360.57 A: right 

359.48 367.23 B: they they won't commit to that so this woman always made very exclusive very fancy clothing 

361.26 363.46 A: yes yes i can see that 

367.13 371.23 A: mhm mhm mhm and she charged a lot for it [laughter] 

371.56 374.86 B: i'm i'm saying her suits 

375.31 376.21 A: (( [noise] )) 

375.51 380.61 B: my mother wore a suit to my graduation that retailed for fifteen hundred dollars 

380.91 384.67 A: [sigh] wow okay well um but 

383.64 386.37 B: and i graduated from college a few years ago 

386.70 389.03 A: right i see i see 

388.45 395.46 B: [sigh] uh that's who that's the uh level that i would sell that's the market i would go for 

395.59 403.45 A: right but the problem is that you can't i guess you have you you have your your it's a niche market you know what i mean 

403.01 404.87 B: everyone has to find their niche 

404.66 406.10 A: yeah 

404.97 406.27 B: absolutely 

406.39 414.29 A: i guess uh i mean for me i would target more the masses you know working girls um girls that are in college 

410.96 411.94 B: mhm 

414.51 415.69 A: um 

415.70 427.37 A: because well i i i would like to be able to you know open a store of my own you know and have another store like chain stores you know what i mean something like express but 

427.65 429.11 A: not really 

429.40 431.99 A: not really their kind of designs 

432.14 434.93 A: you know things that ha- have more variety 

436.34 446.59 A: that you know you can't find here but because when i when i go shopping in asia i find different varieties of things that i can't find in the u._s. for example 

445.68 453.30 B: [sigh] mm sure when i go shopping in paris i see clothes that you can't buy here when i when i went to zurich 

446.66 447.67 A: (( mhm )) 

451.19 452.53 A: yeah exactly 

453.62 463.71 B: i saw clothes that you couldn't see here but i would wanna bring in from some of those countries because when i was in zurich i saw 

462.48 463.50 A: mhm 

464.06 470.61 B: ensembles for winter that had a coat and a pair of slacks that matched 

466.14 467.41 A: mhm 

470.87 472.14 A: right 

470.91 479.97 B: for for winter i saw very fine expensive beautiful stuff that you don't i don't even see it in new york 

476.84 477.88 A: mhm 

479.67 481.95 A: yeah yeah exactly you know 

480.87 489.39 B: but that yes you're right that you have to find your niche but you also have to know what your people want you have to 

489.40 492.61 B: know what your customer wants 

492.44 499.49 A: yeah yeah i guess you're you're appealing to a different target market and yeah but 

496.66 498.03 B: absolutely 

498.59 500.93 B: i'm i'm appealing to 

501.05 505.29 B: an older market than yours because they're established 

502.33 504.41 A: mhm mhm yes 

504.94 506.32 A: mhm yes 

505.63 509.49 B: they dress well they spend a lot 

507.44 508.40 A: mhm 

509.35 510.59 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

509.88 512.39 B: and they they have money 

512.51 518.41 A: yeah but they are a smaller market the thing is for clothes actually the cost is pretty low isn't it 

518.68 520.60 B: uh not necessarily 

520.42 523.83 A: i guess it depends though on your material and 

523.38 528.85 B: absolutely it's the materials it's the design it's what's involved in it 

528.87 541.64 A: mhm but i mean still okay how how how expensive can the cost of um you know for example a gucci suit go up to the cost of it just to make it 

541.10 543.21 B: basic cost or 

543.43 545.43 B: (( what what are you saying [sigh] )) 

544.82 546.37 A: a basic cost 

547.51 555.36 B: i don't know what the basic cost is but a gucci suit can sell for easily five thousand a thousand five hundred a thousand dollars 

553.58 554.53 A: yeah 

555.34 558.33 A: yeah i mean definitely i agree with that but 

558.28 571.63 A: i mean that's why the markup is so high you know what i mean because the i i still feel that the cost is pretty low it's just the brand you know and um they use more expensive materials okay a designer designed it 

571.18 572.15 B: yes 

571.85 573.63 A: and that's what makes it 

573.74 575.10 A: expensive 

575.21 579.85 B: yes but well the department stores have to have a certain markup 

575.46 576.37 A: you know 

579.94 580.90 A: mhm 

580.37 581.52 B: (( and [mn] )) 

582.15 593.61 B: because everything goes on sale at a certain point the markup that i was taught in retailing is a fifty percent markup you start with but then again you walk into macy's and ev- 

585.15 586.24 A: yeah 

593.74 599.89 B: everything's twenty five percent off from here and there and then you get your coupons and everything else that's not
