133.34 143.67 A: are you that is so funny yeah well good luck i mean that's gonna be a fun trip it's i gotta tell you though that it's it's kind of about ninety five degrees here today 

143.33 146.86 B: i know i just went on weather dot com before actually 

146.35 148.23 A: yeah y- it 

147.17 149.36 B: i know and i saw that

151.32 163.06 A: um earlier in in may and we really kinda got a reprieve and it and it's really been really cool in the evenings but i noticed this morning when i got online and looked at the extended weather forecast that it's 

162.84 169.44 A: and it's heating up and then i was out today doing stuff and it was hot out so just be prepared [laughter] 

168.59 169.97 B: well i'm looking 

172.61 173.89 B: [noise] 

175.20 176.26 A: hello 

177.14 178.94 B: i'm sorry am i losing you

194.54 196.12 B: exactly 

197.15 198.53 B: exactly 

198.55 210.15 B: and the hours wouldn't be that bad like i i always thought about like one of my thoughts was a restaurant but i feel like that that's just so hard to get off the ground there are so many restaurants that fail 

210.34 216.16 B: especially in new york that's i'm thinking with the new york mentality like restaurants go come and go so easily 

215.80 217.02 A: do they 

216.76 218.21 B: (( yeah )) 

217.37 222.95 A: well out here in in phoenix uh where i am everything is real sports oriented right now 

222.74 223.86 B: mhm 

223.12 233.36 A: and my grandfather actually owned four taverns back in illinois in the chicago area yeah so i always you know i was i was 

229.73 230.99 B: oh really 

233.29 246.51 A: familiar with that kind of life and and that kind of business and you know i've always kind of liked that because i'm i lo- i'm a people person i like to interact and everything but you know money would be just such a big issue for me because 

246.36 255.17 A: the licenses the liquor licenses and everything you know so i guess what you're thinking of would be good what would you have to go through um 

248.38 249.87 B: oh i know 

254.39 263.37 B: you know what i really don't know i i started thinking about it when i was i was at a salon one time and i picked up one of the books and it was actually a book on 

263.52 272.47 B: like how to buy the supplies and everything like that and it just got me to thinking about it so i did a little bit of research and when i started researching it they actually had um 

272.83 287.31 B: [lipsmack] they had a conference in vegas where i guess it was like a trade show it was a trade show for all type of beauty salon and day spas and if i was seriously thinking this is when i just began thinking about it and there's no way i would have the funding as of right now 

276.78 278.07 A: oh wow 

286.95 288.33 A: i know 

287.46 292.27 B: so i was just thinking about it and i found out about this trade show 

292.16 303.69 B: and if if i was really serious about doing it you know in the in the near future i would have you know i would have gone there and learned a lot more but right now i just really don't know too much about opening a business 

303.32 318.26 A: well wouldn't that be fun to go to vegas and just you know have a week and my my friend has a um [lipsmack] screen printing business and she started it like because they worked for oh god one of the engineering firms um 

304.89 305.68 B: (( oh it )) 

306.35 307.50 B: i know 

318.14 328.51 A: the [mn] either motorola or something and they got laid off you know because hey you know that's what was happening back then and it was about nine years ago and um 

325.50 326.48 B: right 

328.59 333.75 A: uh they just took what they had and they invested it and they bought this screen prin- printing machine 

333.67 338.50 A: and they have started like now it took 'em a while to get up you know and running 

338.31 352.20 A: and i was like you know i had i was only i was working in research at at the university and i had my son here so i watched her two boys and they kinda grew up together for about four years and they really took off and they're doing like 

343.65 344.89 B: mhm 

352.09 356.90 A: um [lipsmack] the um visor caps are really popular out here 

355.94 357.67 B: oh really 

356.84 369.11 A: yeah you know like the golfing you know those visors and they do all kinds of um um printed everything you know any kind of thing you'd want any printing on it and all the tee shirts and they picked up all the um 

358.84 360.40 B: right mhm 

368.94 381.24 A: little league and the pop warner business so they do like all the yeah so they really are doing well and i thought well maybe i can ask her you know for some advice but it's such a different business 

371.58 373.16 B: oh really 

381.16 387.32 A: that other than you know other than general stuff i don't i don't really know [sigh] you know and things like 

381.47 382.71 B: i know 

386.29 392.11 B: you have to like have that idea that's original and no one else like there's no competition around 

391.66 399.82 A: wow yeah well your idea is really good 'cause i imagine there's there's not probably a lot of day spas there in new york are there 

392.86 394.26 B: (( you know and )) 

399.22 401.49 B: no there are a lot 

400.73 408.30 A: are there okay like you mean at the major like inside the department stores or the or the salons or something have like 

401.53 403.03 B: yeah it 

407.53 411.60 B: right there's there's a lot of day spas in manhattan but 

411.65 416.81 B: as far as the outskirts of new york that would probably be the best bet because there's only a few 

416.26 420.47 A: well see that's what i was thinking more so you're in you're are you in manhattan 

419.96 421.85 B: yeah i live in manhattan 

420.54 425.22 A: oh wow i have always wanted to go i've never been to new york 

424.46 426.06 B: really 

425.21 439.33 A: never and my friends uh just went and they came back and they told me it was wonderful you know they saw the shows and all the things that tourists do when they go but i've always wanted to go and that's gonna be next on my list so but 

433.24 434.50 B: mhm 

438.13 439.97 B: yeah it's great 

439.35 442.26 A: you've been out here though before then right 

441.38 444.60 B: yes i've been i was there last march 

444.42 446.83 A: so are you coming for a vacation or 

444.70 445.95 B: for the first time 

446.18 450.72 B: well i came for a vacation last time and we stayed at the phoenician 

450.43 451.99 A: isn't that nice 

451.37 453.94 B: yes it was so nice and 

452.69 454.60 A: yeah it's very beautiful 

454.45 460.89 B: and my one of my best friends actually moved there last august so i'm going to visit her 

460.47 463.00 A: well how's she liking it 

462.40 465.69 B: she likes it she's she's still adjusting 

465.60 470.42 A: so well if if she's in that area like you know scottsdale or paradise alley 

468.56 469.37 B: she's 

469.50 471.08 B: she's in tenpy 

470.74 485.06 A: okay now tenpy is right by me um i'm in awatookee i don't know if you know where that is it's the east valley it's by it's in the foothills and tenp- so tenpy is just a little bit north east of where i am and um 

475.99 477.05 B: no 

485.01 489.55 A: that whole area i don't know if you you talked to her but there are like sports bars here 

489.36 503.42 A: but there you know i was thinking of doing something that was kind of like for kids where you didn't have the alcohol but you did like the big screens and um you did like you served 'em like the smoothies and things like that and they could do 

494.37 495.65 B: mhm 

502.30 504.02 B: oh that's fun 

503.38 508.43 A: you know and then have 'em come like after their games and things like that and 

507.50 510.04 B: see that's original that's a good idea 

508.68 517.74 A: you know i was thinking about that you know and then i thought then you'd cut out like the alcohol and you wouldn't have all that expense you know so 

516.86 521.23 B: right that's true and then you might not even you won't even need the liquor license 

520.70 526.66 A: no i wouldn't need that i wouldn't need to go through all that because i know that's what your big expenses are 

526.20 527.95 B: right exactly 

527.21 534.20 A: and then you have all you know not so much um headache about everything that happens around alcohol too 

533.48 536.18 B: right exactly or the liability 

534.55 535.59 A: and in 

535.63 545.67 A: exactly and then the uh people that are in sports or use sports they they always wanna go somewhere and a lot of the parents are oh we don't wanna go there and even have our pizza party because 

545.43 552.36 A: you know some of the guys start drinking or you know stuff that's happened and you know how it is in little kids' sports these days oh 

551.66 554.76 B: right i know i've heard the stories [laughter] on the news 

553.90 558.78 A: oh my god i don't i don't know your age so i don't know if you have any children but [mn] 

558.03 560.43 B: no i'm only twenty five 

558.81 559.75 A: okay 

559.79 567.97 A: well you know what [laughter] when you get there [laughter] if you have a child who wants to play team sports the best approach is just 

561.91 562.72 B: [laughter] 

567.73 577.76 A: you know sit back and look at some of those other fools 'cause i mean you know you have to be a good parent and be supportive but some of these people they're just living through their kids and 

577.39 579.58 B: [laughter] i know i've heard 

578.08 579.17 A: it it's 

579.03 590.12 A: oh it oh my husband coaches and it it was incredible last year and he's done it for seven years and he told me this year i'm not gonna do it so he didn't he didn't sign up it's just pop warner you know 

589.90 599.95 A: at that level but the fights and the arguments and they think that their kids are should be in the n._f._l. and it's it's just crazy but but i thought that idea 

589.94 591.49 B: mhm 

596.30 597.96 B: [laughter]
