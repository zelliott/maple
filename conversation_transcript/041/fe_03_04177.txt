0.13 2.12 B: hi my name's suzanne 

2.06 3.59 A: hi morgan 

3.38 5.33 B: hi morgan how're you 

5.00 6.00 A: good 

5.62 9.63 B: that's so funny 'cause i was reading a book where one of the character's names was morgan 

9.48 10.53 A: (( [laughter] really )) 

9.93 14.81 B: [laughter] yeah um okay what about you starting off with you 

10.66 11.88 A: [laughter] 

15.58 22.23 A: well uh i guess i would probably do something similar to what i do now but i would uh 

22.51 27.40 A: um i like the part about having unlimited money [laughter] so 

24.97 26.04 B: [laughter] 

27.46 30.22 A: um i i'd have a research lab 

30.21 32.62 B: oh and what would you research 

32.61 35.09 A: i guess uh whatever i felt like [laughter] 

34.97 39.28 B: [laughter] that's cryptic okay 

39.42 44.56 B: um med- are you are a medical research person or uh 

44.45 53.27 A: well i wor- i work in more computer science research but but the thing is if there was unlimited money i could uh come to work each day and decide what i wanted to do 

53.50 54.93 B: (( wow )) 

53.69 58.09 A: so though that's i mean the unlimited money part really opened it up so 

58.18 70.02 A: i thought so uh uh i mean the whole idea of a business that has unlimited money is sort of a contradiction in a way because if you have unlimited money then you really probably don't have to worry about making money 

70.84 78.55 B: then of course you'd be successful because then it would depend on what your uh then it would no longer be a financially 

78.58 80.13 B: (( uh )) 

80.74 89.91 B: situation where it would that would be your definition of success then it would start to be an individualistic uh definition of success 

89.67 96.44 A: right it'd be success if you felt fulfilled if you felt that you'd done something good or done done something that was helpful in someone or 

96.95 98.91 A: or uh you know if you 

99.29 105.42 A: um [cough] if you were working on some aid to the handicapped then and it actually worked you'd say hey i'm a success 

105.29 107.69 B: yeah wouldn't that be lovely [laughter] 

105.54 106.72 A: [laughter] 

106.93 121.10 A: [laughter] so uh yeah i think i think so i might not do exactly what i'm doing now because what i'm doing now is often dependent on well very often dependent on what's you know what's marketable which i think is true of a lot of businesses so i 

121.26 123.19 A: i think that's again we're 

123.57 130.19 A: um if you actually have unlimited money it kind of opens it up to where it's it's maybe not even really a business in 

130.45 134.30 A: in the usual sense but that i i thought i'd take it that way because that's 

134.57 137.58 A: uh sounded most interesting to me how how 'bout you mhm mhm mhm 

137.45 143.69 B: um well probably a couple of things i don't know if they limit us to one thing but if you're 

143.82 148.06 B: yeah use used by that definition money is no object 

147.87 161.19 B: usually allow the times when you start with one thing then you can actually do your tax deductions on something else right so um [lipsmack] uh i'm an actor so probably what i would do is i'd start a casting agency to 

161.07 170.42 B: employ other actors and um then obviously if money were no object that i'd have to you know have some tax write offs and i'd probably 

170.35 172.31 B: um write off to the 

172.25 185.67 B: leukemia society or something like that and i think yeah the the unlimited funds then of course you'd be successful i mean by any definition of what success is you'd be successful you know um [lipsmack] 

185.56 191.41 A: mhm but if you if money was uh no object and was unlimited why would you even care about t- tax deductions 

191.86 194.86 B: b- uh well yeah that's true [laughter] that's a very 

194.44 199.26 A: [laughter] i mean yeah you might you still might want to give to the leukemia society [laughter] 

195.17 196.38 B: (( good )) 

196.62 208.31 B: point i'll do that just to be a great person i guess you know um yeah you know and then of course you'd be a success because you'd you know then you could start thinking about you know 

208.48 218.89 B: philanthropic kind of things you know you you know you res- research a cure for cancer of course you're a great person you know what i mean you employ your friends 

218.67 230.60 B: and they employ their friends then of course you're a great person and of course then you're a success because you don't have to worry about uh um you know the traditional kind of thing so um 

218.96 219.64 A: right 

230.71 232.06 B: wow [laughter] 

230.85 236.61 A: mhm well then you just have to worry about ev- about the motives of people who who uh who are friendly to you 

236.91 238.23 A: [laughter] 

237.64 248.74 B: [laughter] yeah but do you don't have to worry about that anyway so you know you just would do it on a grander scale and it would just be um the the payoff would be would be greater you know 

248.66 254.37 B: than uh uh than you do right now yes but um 

254.44 257.36 B: hm [laughter] 

256.38 262.31 A: mhm so then if you gave to the leukemia society it would just be because you wanted to opposed to a tax deduction yeah mhm 

260.03 261.32 B: i felt like it 

261.76 265.08 B: mm mhm yeah it it i i think 

265.25 268.18 B: maybe they're trying to get it which is still do what you 

268.51 273.51 B: you know what you do now or something like that but uh 

273.79 276.13 B: it is really interesting [laughter] 

275.60 277.13 A: [laughter] 

277.94 278.83 A: yeah 

278.04 280.55 B: and um 

280.25 284.65 A: we're talking both sides of our cases like we would it's just it's just it would be different mhm mhm 

284.57 291.94 B: yeah i mean i think it would be on a grander scale and i think um the idea that it it if uh um 

292.56 304.70 B: if money were no object you really could make what it you you kinda it could be a fluid job because you might not you might start off doing one thing and and if money is no object you could take things to their 

304.54 318.92 B: you know conclusion like maybe you start a research facility for something and you know money's no object so you can hire the people who actually research and then uh you know get the funding to uh 

318.81 320.23 B: to uh 

320.38 325.02 B: you know get a patent for something or or whatever so i mean 

325.33 330.51 B: yeah i can't imagine why you wouldn't be successful or you know if money's no object 

330.66 331.67 B: [laughter] 

330.88 341.56 A: yeah well i guess i mean you you could be it depends on your definition of suc- success though right so if you if your definition of success was accomplishing what you were setting out to do 

341.59 347.99 A: e- even without an unlimited amount of money if you managed it poorly you still might not get get what you want 

348.31 352.35 B: yeah hopefully you're brave enough to employ people that know how to 

352.32 353.93 B: make the money work 

353.88 368.79 B: that's you see [laughter] that's i guess the scary thing is that money's no object and you're not great mathematically [laughter] then uh then and you know unless you em- employ somebody that you trust then you're kind of uh 

354.16 354.95 A: (( [laughter] )) 

360.99 361.86 A: (( mhm )) 

368.80 378.33 B: [laughter] up the creek i guess so i ought to know by that trim whether i would be successful i probably would because i i would have confidence in the people 

378.83 382.68 B: probably that i hire but you know that would als- huh 

380.60 381.85 A: (( i mean that )) 

382.01 387.61 A: i mean there're plenty of big companies that that had probably i think by most people's terms uh 

387.72 391.17 A: uh unlimited money who who have that have failed 

391.32 398.60 A: so so i think i think it's possible to do i think one of the things is if you have a lot of money then you're probably not gonna do something small 

398.63 405.99 A: and when you do something very large and very complicated it's it's uh astronomically more difficult to organize 

406.28 415.26 A: so so uh it's not just a question of hiring one person who you trust but there might be a hundred thousand people and [cough] um 

415.27 429.35 A: it's i think it's it's very hard to do so i so i think it isn't obvious that you'd necessarily success just 'cause there'd be a lot of money but on the other hand there's certainly opportunities to do uh do things that are a different kind of scale 

429.42 432.76 A: and uh a different level of freedom certainly for 

433.10 437.25 A: uh uh a person who sets it up 

437.02 447.91 B: well they didn't have a time limit on how on how long that we had to [laughter] have this business either so i mean i know that there are a lot of business also at at at least um 

441.42 442.62 A: (( right right mhm )) 

447.78 452.98 B: in the film business where you can go and you can do one project and you can chapter eleven 

452.81 466.11 B: you know into your next project and so i mean and and successful people do that to finance their their things so i i i don't know whether i would necessarily do that but i think that's uh 

466.17 472.12 B: you know when you get into a huge bracket then then you know there are all sorts of things you could do to ensure that 

472.39 474.70 B: that things are successful too 

474.65 483.38 A: yeah it's true it it's also true the people who fail at very large things are are often successful in the sense of getting the next job because 

483.40 497.94 A: they're known as the person who failed at that and that makes them famous and then they can get the next job i mean that actually happens i think in in big business but but again i think it sort of depends on what how you define success if what you were trying to do was find a cure for leukemia 

486.81 487.68 B: [laughter] 

497.98 505.73 A: and you were unable to do that then you might not feel you were successful even if you had a lot of money and had a big business 

505.87 508.11 A: so it's it's i think uh 

508.23 522.76 A: it's not obvious but on the other hand uh it'd be great fun i mean [laughter] it's a unlimited funds to do something i i wanted to amend my thing too because i realized yeah i'd probably wanna do something like what i do now without so many money worries 

513.89 514.60 B: [laughter] 

522.84 529.40 A: have research lab but the other thing is uh it would be fun to make films [laughter] 

528.95 530.14 B: [laughter] 

530.36 535.71 B: we could do everything i mean with unlimited money then why would you stop with one business too 

535.82 537.26 B: i mean do you 

535.92 545.58 A: well 'cause you can't pay attention to that many things at once it actually gets frustrating to pay attention to too many things but but you you wouldn't necessarily have to do 

545.74 551.82 A: one thing forever you could do foc- really focus on something for five years and then focus on something else 

552.23 560.67 A: after that or focus on a couple of things i mean i know people who are on ten different boards and they they go crazy but [laughter] 

561.14 573.55 B: [laughter] yeah i don't know if i could do that but i mean i don't know because i think that everybody has the situation where if they have a particular drive to do something the time speeds by as opposed to doing something that you feel like you 

573.44 581.71 B: must do and uh time seems to j- [laughter] to just stand still and uh um 

581.77 585.29 B: i don't know i mean uh there're certainly 

585.36 588.09 B: jobs that i've had where where 

588.60 591.21 B: time just kind of whizzed by 

591.27 592.06 A: yeah 

591.28 599.95 B: and i could prob- you know and i had ple- dumped plenty of energy to work and i and and vice versa and i think it just
