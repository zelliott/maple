0.35 3.32 B: hi there i'm gene savage from tulsa 

2.76 5.84 A: hi i'm shannon sun from new york 

5.63 6.83 B: hi there 

6.38 8.16 A: how're you [laughter] 

7.17 11.42 B: oh doin' good doin' good this is a wonderful topic for me i [laughter] 

10.42 12.68 A: why are you planning to open a business 

12.07 22.06 B: well i've actually tried a couple of times and i i do still have a passion for it yeah uh in fact i did an do you wanna go first on this one or do you want me to go ahead 

14.52 15.74 A: oh really 

21.45 24.54 A: you can just go right ahead [laughter] 

23.90 34.71 B: i'll try not to take up the full ten minutes [laughter] um if if money was no object and i could open any business in the world there's no question in my mind that what it would be would be a radio station 

25.47 27.17 A: (( [laughter] go for it )) 

34.55 35.83 A: oh really 

34.72 40.22 B: uh oh yeah i have been passionate about radio since i was a little kid 

39.27 41.58 A: like an independent radio station 

41.92 54.20 B: uh well it would be probably one of the few individually owned and operated stations that uh from that standpoint i would definitely call it independent um i i get very frustrated [sigh] at uh 

49.73 50.98 A: mhm 

54.73 56.78 B: at corporate radio quite frankly 

56.87 59.18 B: um i don't feel 

58.03 61.12 A: almost redundant now right corporate radio 

60.19 66.50 B: yeah yeah exactly it's become the same thing uh very frustrating i i think it wouldn't be so bad 

66.58 77.36 B: if i felt like there were individuals locally in each community who were determining what was going on the air and if i felt like there was actually a live human being behind the microphone 

75.78 76.82 A: mhm 

77.36 81.71 B: but these days uh you've got people voice tracking from another time zone 

81.78 88.48 B: and it just seems to be very much least common denominator programming um growing up 

86.46 87.83 A: yeah 

88.27 98.53 B: i had a ball listening to radio i listened to people that maybe weren't that polished but they were real human beings they were interesting to listen to and sometimes they were extremely entertaining 

98.68 102.70 B: uh so i i really would like to get a chance to 

102.55 116.10 B: set up a radio station and as far as going about doing it one of the things that i would want to do is i would want to do some research research doesn't have to be a dirty word [laughter] if it's used as a vice as opposed to a a yardstick um 

111.68 113.19 A: (( [laughter] )) 

116.15 127.46 B: i think you have to know how to use it uh and one of the first things that i would do is make sure i had enough money set aside for sales staff because i've actually run uh a radio program before 

127.57 135.71 B: and the the one mistake i did make i pulled in tons of listeners but i didn't know how to handle the uh 

135.81 139.09 B: the advertising of it i didn't understand the business of radio 

137.01 138.20 A: mhm 

139.20 148.97 B: and i ended up going into deep debt in fact trying to keep this thing afloat and it was just that i didn't i understood the art of radio but not the business and so that would i would not make that mistake again 

148.78 149.92 A: [laughter] 

149.17 156.80 B: [laughter] so i it kind of gives you a taste of what what i do what what would you do what's your answer to this question 

156.29 160.88 A: i would probably do something that had to do with food 

160.85 162.18 B: oh really 

161.07 163.67 A: um yeah like either 

164.15 170.76 A: well the thing is in like i would never open up a restaurant in new york it's just like way too tough 

170.84 171.82 B: yeah 

171.12 173.82 A: um you're like a 

173.85 183.08 A: it's a horrible attitude but i think [laughter] opening a restaurant in new york is setting yourself up to fail like first of all your rent and your overhead is just so incredibly high 

180.77 181.96 B: (( oh yeah )) 

182.89 184.19 B: no kidding 

183.61 186.93 A: and there's so much competition and 

186.99 192.11 A: it's just i don't know i think it would be too stressful but i would i would probably do something like uh 

192.42 201.06 A: like maybe a prepared foods kind of takeout that had a few tables kind of thing or or a bakery 

196.85 198.48 B: oh yeah hm 

201.26 207.30 A: i i i i d- actually i i right now i'm unemployed but like that's what i do for a living i make pastry 

207.14 208.45 B: oh how cool 

207.73 221.33 A: um yeah so it's like and i i've always had a passion for food so i could see myself doing like a um and i also [laughter] have a degree in entrepreneurship [laughter] and haven't used it 

218.85 220.76 B: oh there you go perfect 

221.37 222.39 A: but um 

221.76 225.55 B: they couldn't have picked this question better [laughter] 

222.92 232.95 A: [laughter] but uh yeah i would probably i don't know maybe like a natural foods takeout and then another thing that i've always wanted 

233.13 237.66 A: to do like but in the far future like 

237.68 246.62 A: it would be have an urban b. and b. which i know is just like a ton of work but i just think it would be fun not not to do by myself but if i was 

241.40 242.43 B: mhm 

246.56 255.73 A: like like i'd be it'd be the kind of thing that if i was married and found another couple to do it with in their with like the two couples running it 

255.34 256.38 B: yeah 

255.66 263.46 A: you know i i always thought that that would be like even though a lot of hard work i always felt that that would be a really great thing to do 

263.56 266.93 B: that could be a neat experience i could definitely see that 

266.35 273.87 A: yeah and i could totally see myself liking it you know it's it's but i i wanna stay in new york [laughter] 

269.84 270.72 B: yeah 

273.19 286.91 B: [laughter] that's the trick and when you say new york do you mean actually new york city i assume okay you're actually in the city yeah i would imagine setting up a restaurant there would be very difficult because it does seem like there are a million places 

277.81 279.61 A: yeah yeah 

286.59 291.76 A: yeah and places go and they're not a business like there's another mall you know it's like you have to 

287.21 288.00 B: there 

289.71 290.73 B: yeah 

292.01 296.50 A: you just have to hit it right either that or you just have to have a great location 

296.40 297.30 B: right 

296.58 302.94 A: like there has to be something you have to either have great places or great location but then then there are some places that 

303.00 304.11 A: that 

304.20 316.51 A: you just have no idea why they do well [laughter] well i guess usually those in those cases it's location but there are like some horrible places with horrible food and horrible service and horrible everything that do great 

307.11 307.95 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

315.90 326.80 B: and people keep coming back yeah [laughter] well you mentioned uh the work that you did with pastry one of the things that immediately came to my mind and i don't know if this would hold any interest to you at all but 

316.98 319.11 A: yeah exactly 

319.52 320.67 A: it's weird 

326.71 333.56 B: uh would you maybe be looking at getting into something like the catering industry that works with uh say wedding cakes and things like that 

332.76 343.64 A: no well i i don't i actually don't know how to do wedding cakes but [laughter] but uh i i'm thinking because i'm unemployed now i should advance myself so uh there's 

335.65 336.74 B: (( oh okay [laughter] )) 

343.27 344.26 B: yeah 

343.43 357.93 A: a course i wanna take but it's not until june so it's like i can't start it sign up for it because i want to have a job by then [laughter] it's not like the kind of thing that if they have space available last minute and i'm not still not working then i'll sign up but um 

350.87 351.78 B: right 

358.09 361.37 A: [noise] yeah and and wedding cakes are very lucrative too 

361.20 367.49 B: that's the thing i mean i work as a mobile d._j. on the weekends and we go to these places and and 

361.75 363.01 A: yeah they're 

366.42 369.47 A: what's a mobile d._j. as opposed to a d._j. 

368.41 375.43 B: oh sorry um it's uh i actually work as a a guy who comes in with the sound equipment and the lights 

375.01 375.97 A: uh-huh 

375.44 377.00 B: and will set up for 

375.98 378.56 A: like for parties and stuff uh-huh 

377.06 379.96 B: uh yeah yeah but you've seen the wedding singer 

379.49 380.52 A: (( yeah )) 

379.96 382.67 B: that's me [laughter] 

380.57 383.63 A: (( [laughter] the morning dj [laughter] )) 

382.62 395.84 B: if i'm i'm djing music instead of uh instead of actually singing but um but it's incredible to me these these places that we set up in the hotels and and uh other some people sometimes have events out at the zoo and things like that 

386.29 387.88 A: okay [laughter] 

395.86 407.24 B: they will have these people come in and cater food and you know they're paying an arm and a leg and and the food's very good don't get me wrong but you know that they they've gotta just be making ridiculous profits on that 

401.62 402.48 A: yeah 

406.44 418.30 A: the thing is i'm i'm not i'm not super ambitious and like i think you have to be ambitious and there's so much that goes into catering especially catering for big events like that like you have to think of 

410.42 411.14 B: mhm 

416.74 417.54 B: (( oh )) 

418.18 429.86 A: like you have to realize that you know for certain events the caterer's the one that takes care of renting the chairs and renting the tables and getting the fra- you know the some something and getting the dishes getting the glasses 

424.99 426.19 B: that's true 

429.67 433.15 A: you know 'cause it's not like they have that stuff they rent that stuff 

432.77 433.78 B: yeah 

432.94 445.41 A: you know and there's just so much involved like i i i have no desire to like i don't know like once 'cause i've thought about it but it's like when i think about it it's for a second 'cause it's like oh wait there's just way too much stuff that goes in that 

444.13 445.31 B: [laughter] 

445.21 452.08 A: like whereas like a b. and b. like i know there's a ton of stuff that goes into it but it just seems like stuff that i would like 

451.94 455.46 B: yeah well it's a little bit more on your terms 

452.15 455.48 A: you know and that i'd like to learn in the process 

455.49 463.37 B: a little bit more on your terms too i would think because with with a catering it it and really with any service where you're going out and presenting something like that 

463.92 473.08 B: people it it tends to be tied to a highly emotionally charged event uh and if it's one of those things and it's it's usually a specialty or some- 

468.61 469.68 A: yeah 

471.41 474.19 A: (( like bridezillas and [laughter] )) 

473.40 487.24 B: yeah and so they're going you ruined my day you know by whatever it is that you know the cake wasn't quite right or something whereas with a bed and breakfast or if you've got a place set up a food shop of some kind where people can come to 

477.26 478.34 A: yeah 

487.22 493.86 B: it's kind of like well this is my place this is my location come like it or not yeah the 

489.75 491.56 A: yeah it's the routine 

491.89 497.28 A: yeah and and yeah exactly and you have definitely much more control 

497.28 499.53 B: yeah well 

498.32 508.23 A: and i'm not a control freak i i i i actually don't like controlling other people but i don't like other people having control over me [laughter] you know [laughter] 

505.86 507.15 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

507.30 509.37 B: looking for a neutral ground that 

508.65 513.37 A: yeah exactly like a so so i've been like that kind of thing would be good but it's like 

513.43 523.42 A: (( i'm not part of a couple and i don't have the other couple to [laughter] do it with and i don't have the money so it's like i'm missing a lot of the elements but i think at some point in life like maybe )) 

516.79 518.59 B: [laughter] right 

523.48 524.44 A: in 

524.78 529.24 A: i mean i'm talking a long time like probably when i'm like my fifties or something 

528.88 529.97 B: yeah 

529.39 538.32 A: you know or late forties and i i assume more much more settled you know i i think that that it would be a great thing to do 

535.13 536.12 B: oh yeah 

538.43 546.17 B: it it seems like it would be a lot of fun and it also seems like something that you could do on on into and through your retirement years 

545.94 559.49 B: uh you might end up having to hire you know housekeepers or something like that but you'd still be able to do it and people would love the you know especially as you got older would love kind of having the you know the grandmother and the the grandfather there that 

546.33 547.19 A: yeah 

548.97 550.45 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

558.93 565.87 A: (( [laughter] couple [laughter] [laughter] let's see )) 

559.53 561.36 B: for personality [laughter] 

561.87 564.90 B: we're going to grandma's house [laughter] 

564.96 568.96 B: i've never met them before but it's grandma's house [laughter] 

566.57 569.64 A: [laughter] that could be our gimmick 

569.54 571.44 B: (( there you go there you go )) 

569.72 573.90 A: [laughter] see brainstorming [laughter] 

573.31 581.12 B: exactly exactly and though that's so important too to get you know do you ever get the feeling that some of the people who make corporate decisions uh 

580.94 588.82 B: are are brainstorming but they're brainstorming around a very sterile table at the top of a very tall building somewhere 

588.22 599.89 A: well yeah and it's it's all like group think like they all you know they're the basically the same people like even though they're they're individuals there's not really much that's individual about them [laughter] and yeah 

591.04 591.80 B: yeah 

594.17 595.34 B: mhm 

598.62 599.81 B: yeah
