1.04 2.26 A: hello 

1.90 3.55 B: hello [lipsmack] 

2.85 7.06 A: hi i'm diane i'm calling from bellingham washington 

7.09 11.02 B: oh hi this is sherrie i'm calling from tempe arizona 

10.55 13.72 A: okay well this is only the second time i've done this so 

13.57 15.13 B: (( [laughter] )) 

14.37 16.57 A: so i'm still new how about you 

16.36 20.95 B: yeah this is probably my third time i was a little confused on the second one but i think i'm getting it 

20.47 25.83 A: yeah the first one i was like i don't know what to do and i i seemed to always miss the calls but 

24.95 27.28 B: [laughter] 

26.26 28.73 A: okay well i can answer this question 

28.54 29.84 B: okay 

29.05 30.09 A: um 

30.24 34.34 A: if i could open my own business i already know what that would be um 

33.45 34.63 B: what would that be 

34.63 46.61 A: well [mn] i'd like to open like not not really a a [noise] espresso stand but that would be like part of it but i've thought about this actually a lot recently um 

47.35 53.66 A: [cough] something like uh not like a quick stop but something where you could get just about anything 

54.10 57.71 A: for people on the go and you wouldn't have to get out of your car 

57.59 59.06 B: mhm 

58.05 67.57 A: [lipsmack] like i can go to my local store here and get just about everything but b- bread and milk if i want bread and milk then i have to go to a different store you know 

67.66 79.08 A: but if somebody had a drive up area you were coming home from work you could drive up and you could get i i need a carton of eggs i need a loaf of bread i need milk 

79.12 88.42 A: um uh even cigarettes well you know not not alcohol or anything like that they could do it without leaving their car and drive off and go home 

88.92 91.31 A: i think it'd be a good idea but i don't know 

91.52 92.97 B: well there you go 

93.53 96.33 B: and espresso [laughter] 

95.23 100.57 A: mm well i figured that could be thrown in for good measure but that actually kinda takes a while but um 

100.62 101.59 A: i don't know 

101.77 109.66 A: i'm always thinking about when i when i'm like getting off work how i need milk and i need bread and then i don't wanna go to the grocery store and 

109.68 121.35 A: blah blah blah and it's like it would sure be nice to just drive up to a place and say okay i need a gallon milk and blah blah blah and then you pay and then then you go 

121.25 125.42 B: yeah so how would you what was w- so 

122.50 123.85 A: so i don't know 

125.02 129.65 A: ((  )) 

126.80 128.59 B: yeah so that's right 

129.81 130.48 B: (( um )) 

133.66 137.26 A: game plan together um if money wasn't an issue um 

137.18 149.95 A: well i'd have to uh find a location but see i've been thinking about this for a while so i have locations already panned out um it would have to be a choice one where there's a lot of traffic flow but there's also easy access for them to get off the road you know 

143.33 144.98 B: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

149.70 151.01 B: mhm 

150.33 151.54 A: but um 

151.61 158.58 A: money wasn't a issue i guess i wouldn't have to worry about going and getting a loan for it because the money obviously would already be there 

158.28 159.36 B: yeah 

158.74 172.83 A: but i guess location would be the key [lipsmack] then i would have to advertise which um i could do that over the internet which i'm on that all the time or and i could also do fliers but i could also do it in the newspaper and then 

167.59 168.86 B: mhm 

173.19 176.58 A: i could tell all my friends and family which is a huge one so 

176.32 177.76 B: (( [laughter] )) 

176.87 180.08 A: word of mouth obviously there that'll that'll help 

179.62 181.55 B: mhm 

180.36 181.46 A: but um 

181.71 189.64 A: [lipsmack] my friends and family have been telling me to open a video store for years is what they've been trying but i thought well i could always throw those in for good measure as well 

189.84 194.26 B: [lipsmack] oh and drive through a video hm that's interesting i never thought about that 

192.48 201.97 A: well i'm like a total movie bu- buff and i've worked for you know [noise] video company for quite a while now you know and um 

200.53 201.65 B: uh-huh 

202.01 206.37 A: [lipsmack] i just love movies and everyone's like as as many as i own 

206.41 211.80 A: they say i could open my own shop and it's like i'm not gonna open my own with with my collection you know 

210.90 212.24 B: right 

211.90 224.26 A: but i said it'd be kinda cool but you know you could throw this in there too and say okay here's your list this is what we've got you know but then you would get too many so it would only have to be new releases so drive up video might not not work as well 

224.19 226.22 B: yeah 

225.57 227.64 A: but i don't know what about you 

227.74 233.51 B: hm that sounds good well it's funny that this is the question i um do you know sylvan learning center 

233.34 234.25 A: yes 

233.98 241.62 B: okay [lipsmack] well that's where i work right now and my my goal is my um sister and i we're going to open up our own in probably about a year 

236.12 237.09 A: oh okay 

241.67 243.94 B: so it's a franchise 

244.03 251.62 B: so um we already have our location picked out and um and i think the key is 

251.87 253.53 B: hiring good people 

253.13 254.11 A: uh-huh 

253.75 265.50 B: to make sure that it's going to run properly and that it can be managed and and um so i think making sure that the training's in place and making sure that the um 

265.74 279.46 B: [lipsmack] the training and you know just i think that's just key w- starting a new business is having good people to run it and to just have good people that that wanna be there and can do it well and and all that so 

272.49 273.36 A: oh yeah 

279.26 289.78 B: [lipsmack] so that'd be nice if money wasn't issue 'cause they have a pretty um [lipsmack] their franchise fee and all that so if that wasn't an issue then we would just open it up and and get it going 

284.84 285.84 A: [sigh] oh yeah 

289.40 293.40 A: that sounds good yeah there's actually a sylvan learning center here in bellingham so 

293.14 294.71 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

293.85 298.51 A: yeah i actually saw it by accident the other day going oh i didn't know we had one of those here 

297.87 301.02 B: [laughter] yeah 

299.04 311.63 A: [mn] yeah that'd be cool yeah and so you're right about the the um hiring good people i always figured that if i opened something [mn] like the little quickie stop or whatever that i would probably be running it but eventually i wouldn't want to you know 

305.81 307.10 B: yeah 

310.57 312.36 B: well right 

311.45 316.40 A: i would want to just do the book ending end of it or or whatever you know but um 

316.55 319.46 A: i figured with my large family i'm sure 

319.48 325.72 A: one of my sisters would start it out and then go from there 'cause you know where i worked before i did the hiring too 

325.62 326.68 B: uh-huh 

325.95 328.03 A: and stuff so um 

328.57 334.97 A: [lipsmack] um i kinda know how you know the whole f- you can't really read people in a interview though i found out 

334.76 337.25 B: yeah yeah 

335.25 339.47 A: [laughter] it's really hard 'cause everybody is so super sweet and nice but 

338.99 343.47 B: right well my dilemma's yeah 

339.98 354.60 A: you c- you give 'em time if y- y- y- i always say if nobody is gonna get it in a month they're not gonna get it at all you know and stuff if they can't do it right you know and and they're gonna like steal from you or something they're out but 

346.50 348.55 B: yeah yeah 

353.96 359.60 B: yeah yeah well and to manage good people i mean i think that's part of i think that's the hardest part 

359.19 360.16 A: managing 

360.00 361.68 B: yeah 

360.62 367.08 A: yeah that's what i do for this it's a video business it's it is hard [sigh] there's more pressure 

367.12 368.53 A: but um 

367.13 369.41 B: yeah 

369.08 382.98 A: [lipsmack] finding the right people i- i- is hard too because like i said everyone's nice in the interviews and then you get 'em i'd be surprised how many people well do you like movies well sure and then find out a month later well i don't even watch 'em and it's like well what did you lie at your interview for you know 

372.76 374.30 B: right 

381.80 384.09 B: [noise] [laughter] right 

383.66 390.14 A: but um yeah it i- is key but um i don't know there's a lotta great people out there so 

390.09 391.86 B: yeah 

390.80 394.99 A: i think there's more people that are willing to do the job and not steal from you or 

395.03 398.18 A: or anything like that than there are the opposite you know 

397.95 404.20 B: yeah [noise] well and just to keep people motivated and and to like wanna continue to do a good job 

403.36 408.59 A: well yeah if you pay 'em you know well enough or or at least offer 'em benefit packages you know 

408.25 409.42 B: mhm 

408.70 415.26 A: um i don't know what a small with small business sometimes it takes a while to get the benefits going you know 

414.00 416.69 B: yeah 

415.47 422.48 A: um i worked for a independent video store years ago i worked there for three years and we didn't even have benefits 

422.47 433.49 A: and i remember going oh this is terrible you know and then when i went to go work work for corporate then there was and it was like oh yeah this is great it it was more of an incentive you know 

425.78 428.00 B: oh yeah 

433.03 435.09 B: yeah 

433.54 439.64 A: 'cause there was a extra bonus you know or whatever you wanna call it i i consider benefits a bonus 

435.29 437.38 B: yeah 

440.28 444.07 A: so i don't know as far as a small business goes yeah mhm 

441.15 443.01 B: well yeah absolutely 

443.33 450.14 B: so i guess getting it together from that and just putting the other good [mn] getting all the those parts of it worked out and 

450.22 457.11 B: the benefits and the pay and the management and the training and the hiring of good staff and 

455.42 458.71 A: and a location- yeah well you said you already had an idea right 

458.47 461.48 B: yeah yeah 

459.25 460.11 A: yeah 

460.19 470.06 A: i've got several i look around and think about this stuff all the time going that would be the perfect place for a q- like a quick stop or whatever and i remember thinking well i'd have to come up with a name that 

466.57 467.81 B: yeah 

469.94 475.34 A: nobody else has because you get sued if you do it you know somebody in another 

471.89 473.14 B: that too 

475.40 484.74 A: county has it you know so it's like what would i call it you know i think about these things in my head one stop shopping or or you know just funky things like that 

476.83 478.19 B: yeah 

478.68 481.26 B: [laughter] have you thought of some names [noise] 

484.51 486.53 B: yeah 

484.95 489.79 A: going i mean i'd like it i think it would more benefit probably woman 

489.73 491.12 B: yeah 

490.13 500.19 A: who don't wanna um stop and get milk and eggs and bread i mean it's just like gonna have the necessities but i'm sure it would have candy bars and gum 

496.87 499.77 B: yeah well there's 

500.25 506.28 B: yeah and there was a grocery store out here i don't know how well it took or if they even still do it but they 

500.52 502.82 A: stuff like that but i don't know 

506.18 509.80 B: for a while put out that they would do deliveries 

509.55 510.49 A: (( oh )) 

509.70 514.05 B: and you would just like check off your list and you know or check off what you needed 

513.92 527.23 B: i never did it and i always said okay that's the only way i'm gonna get groceries [laughter] in my house but instead of having going to the drive through they they said that they would deliver if you put together a grocery list and then th- have someone would someone would deliver it out to your house 

517.75 518.83 A: uh-huh 

526.84 536.38 A: yeah well my sister in law um lives down by seattle and she's like busy with three little kids and she does her grocery shopping online
