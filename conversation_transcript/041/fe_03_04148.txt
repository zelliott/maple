1.71 2.78 B: (( hi )) 

3.36 5.56 A: hi i'm sorry you're what's your name 

5.19 7.52 B: (( i'm vsu vsu v. as in victory s. u. )) 

7.46 8.88 A: oh nice to meet you 

9.20 10.19 B: likewise 

9.48 10.25 A: uh 

10.38 13.73 A: so we're supposed to talk about starting our own business 

13.85 15.22 B: yeah looks like it 

15.20 17.31 A: yeah would you [laughter] 

17.07 22.11 B: uh no i'm a college student and i have no idea about these things what about you [laughter] 

21.82 27.15 A: [laughter] well let's say that you weren't a college student like what are you studying 

27.29 28.87 B: um economics 

28.83 33.02 A: well see then you should probably have some concept of it a little bit 

33.79 35.41 B: (( uh it seems like there's )) 

36.72 43.36 B: you can do stuff with the but there's way more practical knowledge that you need to open a business that you know most people don't have at the outset 

43.26 47.54 A: yeah you're not you're not going for an m._b._a. and god bless you for that mm mm 

47.03 48.32 B: (( [laughter] )) 

48.04 54.70 A: [lipsmack] yeah i i don't know what kind of business i'd start i mean i might be good at it but i'd have to find something i'd wanna do 

54.71 56.13 B: well what do you do right now 

56.15 59.86 A: i'm a education reformer in chicago [laughter] 

59.55 61.45 B: oh okay [laughter] 

60.79 62.91 A: so i mean i i could maybe open a a 

63.06 74.07 A: theoretically if i liked what i did which i don't 'cause i'm an education reformer in chicago uh [laughter] screwed up city i could open like a consulting firm but i don't know 

74.63 78.50 A: i don't think i'd want to 'cause it seems like too much work for too little payoff 

78.93 89.90 B: well i don't know it seems like if you open your own business to get so many exemptions and things like that that you basically get to do whatever you want and as long as you don't run it into the ground tax policy etcetera helps you out a lot 

87.07 88.08 A: yeah that's 

89.89 95.49 A: that's true that's true but at the same time there's all these extras that you have to worry about that you don't when you're just an employee like the 

95.27 107.44 A: actual paper work the hiring and firing of people the arranging of of outside services finding rent or like making rent and finding a place to stick around 

106.35 109.17 B: yeah it seems like starting it up would be pretty tough yeah 

109.01 112.71 A: yeah mm [mn] i don't know if i'd want to 

113.61 114.84 A: i i mean 

115.40 125.11 A: i don't know i've thought about it [laughter] when i was younger and i had no means to i thought about it maybe a like a marketing service or something but 

125.34 127.33 A: this is really calling my name right now 

129.49 130.38 B: well 

130.86 135.68 B: say you did actually start up a consultancy what it just be educational or would you wanna branch out as something else 

136.72 141.29 A: see i don't know i'd actually if i were to choose something i'm 

141.44 148.50 A: you can't really start one of these up very easily unless you find a very rich old person but a philanthropic trust 

147.82 149.01 B: yeah 

149.11 156.61 A: i mean that'd be fun i've worked in philanthropy and you know you get to give out money it's great [laughter] 

155.72 156.38 B: yeah 

157.09 162.86 A: at the same time you know you have to find those rich old people they're not they're they're few and far between [laughter] 

164.20 167.96 A: how 'bout you economics what do you what do you wanna do with it 

167.36 168.76 B: uh god knows [cough] 

168.71 170.49 A: [laughter] 

169.21 169.99 B: so 

170.13 171.14 B: i 

171.27 178.20 B: honestly when when they ah the prompt came up i was so surprised by it i just thought ah i like kids maybe i ought to open up something like a daycare center [laughter] 

178.39 181.73 A: you watched daddy daycare didn't ya [laughter] 

181.20 182.22 B: what's that 

182.10 184.47 A: the movie daddy daycare [laughter] 

183.78 185.15 B: no i haven't 

184.69 189.83 A: no i'm kidding i'm kidding i [laughter] went to see it opening weekend honest to god no 

190.12 192.58 A: but daycare huh 

192.74 193.56 B: yeah 

193.29 196.47 A: it sounds like fun it sounds like fun you get to be with kids all day 

196.97 199.28 B: yeah the reason [laughter] 

197.13 198.08 A: what make 

199.24 200.38 A: (( hm )) 

199.95 206.58 B: which was actually the reason i picked that you know i'm just it seems like it'd be nice to be round kids yep it seems like you'd actually be able to do something 

206.78 211.32 A: yeah actually you'd have an effect it'd be nice it'd be nice 

210.74 211.41 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

212.85 213.58 A: (( oh )) 

215.17 215.85 A: mm 

216.12 217.77 A: i don't know if that um [lipsmack] 

218.10 226.85 A: i can't say the same for myself i doubt i'd wanna open a daycare yeah i think after being in education for a while i decided i'm not so big a fan of kids 

228.18 231.85 A: [laughter] they kinda grow off you after a while but 

231.57 233.44 B: oh that's terrible [laughter] 

232.90 245.58 A: [laughter] no it's true it's true well no it's mostly the honestly the kids are fine i'm kidding about that but it's dealing with all the bureaucratic nonsense that comes with any time you have to deal with kids it's just exhausting 

243.73 244.68 B: yeah 

245.27 247.47 B: (( yeah yeah i know what you mean [laughter] )) 

249.05 250.03 A: anyway 

250.63 253.31 A: so have you worked with kids in the past 

252.71 259.72 B: uh no which is kinda why it just sort of into this sort of like ah kids would be nice to work with it's just 

259.75 260.87 A: [laughter] 

259.84 260.81 B: i have 

260.91 261.97 B: like i guess 

262.32 269.98 B: six or seven younger cousins and i love i guess playing with them and working with them and i used to tutor a little bit so that was fun 

270.04 272.41 A: you that's cool that's cool 

272.42 277.59 A: so you have some you have some idea that you like kids that's good [laughter] at least with 

276.46 277.58 B: but nothing i'll 

278.06 286.51 A: yeah you know hey you're in college you're fine you don't have to worry about it yet although bill gates dropped out as a college student for money so 

281.86 282.58 B: yeah 

286.72 288.69 A: keep that in mind 

287.85 289.53 B: it's not a bad idea [laughter] mhm 

289.17 296.17 A: [laughter] i'd ask but we're not i don't think we're supposed to go far off the subject [laughter] 

297.70 298.61 A: so 

299.92 300.51 A: (( i )) 

300.64 305.25 A: i don't know there's just not much to say about it neither of us really wants to start our own business so 

306.35 309.85 B: i get the feeling most people who'll get this subject wouldn't want to do that either 

309.71 319.87 A: [laughter] yeah you know i mean if you're signing up for a research study it probably means you have some free time so [laughter] free time you know you're probably not the biggest entrepreneur in the world 

315.02 316.00 B: (( yeah )) 

320.46 323.28 B: nor are you too concerned with making money [laughter] 

322.64 327.06 A: exactly exactly or or you're broke [laughter] 

326.72 330.21 B: either way it all just doesn't quite fit with the person who would do this 

331.28 335.32 A: okay well let let's pretend okay i'll pretend my own uh 

335.51 340.63 A: okay not a consultancy not a philanthropic trust how about a oh jesus 

341.17 345.99 A: marketing firm no i don't want i have no desire to do that who am i kidding 

345.02 345.80 B: [laughter] 

346.29 348.25 A: um [mn] 

349.04 352.51 A: a restaurant there we go i want to start a restaurant 

352.64 353.96 B: sure that works 

352.95 353.67 A: [laughter] 

353.99 361.37 A: well no i like cooking i'm a good cook i mean of course i ran a restaurant i did have some little to do with the cooking i'd be um 

361.47 362.96 A: dealing with 

363.25 368.28 A: the board of health all the time which i can imagine's really affirming or fun 

368.27 369.45 B: yeah 

369.71 371.84 A: [sigh] so let's see 

372.09 376.69 A: what else would i have would have to worry about 

376.87 380.32 A: god [laughter] it is really depressing 

380.40 381.44 B: yeah 

381.22 383.33 A: it's kind of a downer of a prompt 

385.83 386.88 B: well i mean 

385.96 386.88 A: (( i don't )) 

387.32 393.29 B: i guess assuming you should get get it rolling get the initial stuff out of the way what would you do with it from there 

393.35 397.12 B: what makes you think you'd be good at it i think you said that at the beginning of the conversation 

397.40 406.37 A: know i'm pretty energetic i've i've learned how to network i suppose from what i understand that's important i really haven't researched the subject very well um 

405.48 406.36 B: yeah 

408.64 415.96 A: i don't know i don't know i mean i have a lot of energy i'm a pretty energetic outgoing person i think that's probably the most important part 

415.97 420.51 A: i'm pr- i'm prone to overwork so i think that's good too 

421.64 430.64 A: have a problem with authority a little bit i think that helps i think i took a little quiz on m._s._n. once and it said that i'd be a good businessman 

424.84 425.93 B: [laughter] 

431.89 432.84 A: does that mean 

432.13 436.24 B: just like that twenty questions and it tells you that you can you'd make a good businessman 

436.13 438.32 A: no it was only ten it's amazing 

437.48 439.02 B: oh god [laughter] 

439.20 441.15 A: [laughter] 

441.29 448.39 A: it told my future too apparently i've got to be i've got a fear of death by water that's what i was told on slate i don't know 

449.54 455.39 A: but so i i don't know what makes you what makes you not so prone to starting a business 

455.49 461.58 B: uh lack of experience i think like you said like you know how to network and things like that i'm just sort of like 

461.58 470.54 B: doing i'm just doing nothing but writing papers and reading here which is like you know that's not very conducive to building skills necessary for getting a job 'cause as 

470.63 471.92 A: well 

470.87 472.55 B: independent as that 

472.01 479.06 A: i've got a friends who was an economics major who now works for the federal reserve bank so it depends what kind of job you're looking for [laughter] 

477.53 478.30 B: yeah 

478.92 483.62 B: well starting up something like that doesn't seem like it's a up a regular ec major's alley 

483.70 487.91 A: no probably not not many people i don't know 

488.74 492.06 A: i could think of all the people i know who i think would start a business and 

492.27 494.27 A: do well at it and why 

495.98 509.43 B: well i think the people probably like you who already have like established contacts in the area like you said i guess knowing original person or just having a contact network would be really good for starting up but then from there like you said i guess 

509.61 515.69 B: energy and uh and the ability to learn the ropes like dealing with the board of health if you were to open a restaurant 

515.97 524.79 A: how to massage the system and how not to be afraid of rejection and failure 'cause you got most new businesses just plummet within a 

517.63 519.03 B: (( [laughter] )) 

521.16 522.17 B: oh yeah 

524.91 527.37 A: short period of time 

526.36 527.52 B: yeah 

527.43 532.62 A: not for any reason necessarily because of the person the entrepreneur who started it [noise] 

533.51 536.41 A: for any member who from circumstance 

536.52 538.06 A: just plain dumb luck 

536.75 537.59 B: yeah 

539.02 539.58 A: (( [noise] )) 

539.47 542.01 B: well it does seem sorta random in the beginning 

542.15 545.61 A: yeah i don't know maybe a 

545.66 547.33 A: firm belief in 

547.37 554.97 A: something guiding everyone's action maybe someone who's very religious starts business as well 'cause they just have no fear of it i don't know [laughter] 

555.48 558.05 A: see i'm just shooting in the dark here i've got nothing 

558.03 564.28 A: (( [laughter] it's like hmmm yeah i feel really religious )) 

558.04 560.16 B: yeah join join the club 

564.21 574.92 A: and um whoa live in a warm climate 'cause if you're kicked out of your home you'll want to have to be able to sleep outside let's see [laughter] 

574.26 575.59 B: so i guess 

575.68 578.61 B: central california should have a whole mess of entrepreneurs 

578.34 580.95 A: [laughter] you know that's funny 

581.67 583.15 B: which it doesn't no 

582.62 584.73 A: no but northern california 

587.40 588.32 A: so 

590.07 591.21 A: see 

591.31 592.94 A: god i i 

593.06 595.60 A: can't think of anything else to say on starting a business 

598.76 599.96 A: (( maybe hm ))
