7.57 9.51 A: uh i'm out of pens- pennsylvania 

9.39 10.76 B: uh where in pennsylvania

14.06 17.58 B: oh okay i used to uh i actually went to school outside of westche- in westchester 

18.09 24.97 A: oh yeah that that's not too far away from me actually just down near uh yeah that's not far away at all 

20.47 21.37 B: huh 

24.55 26.19 B: yeah anyway 

26.27 29.05 A: yes today's subject 

28.74 30.64 B: [lipsmack] business and uh 

29.37 30.04 A: (( [noise] )) 

31.05 32.92 B: i guess this is like s- s- 

31.18 37.85 A: money is not an object and you can start a business how would you go about it and do you feel like you would be successful at it 

37.40 38.81 B: do you wanna go first 

38.48 40.90 A: no go for it i wanna hear what you got in mind 

40.94 42.25 B: (( hm )) 

42.28 46.84 B: what kind of business i wonder if this is a i guess if i was going for a profit 

47.16 48.52 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

47.25 58.75 B: uh it would take a lot more consideration it's it's a lot easier to i think i- to think about you know your ideal job situation rather than you know if i was going to open a business so i'll go with i'll go with the whole enjoyment factor rather than the uh 

58.70 63.72 B: the profit factor and i i'd say that i'd go uh open up a photography gallery 

63.83 68.00 A: [noise] [noise] photography gallery yeah that'd be interesting 

65.22 66.41 B: yeah 

67.39 69.55 B: yeah i think uh 

69.57 72.96 B: you know it's a subject that i enjoy partaking in also 

71.87 73.70 A: now how would you go about that though 

74.49 78.09 B: well if money were no object i guess i would start by uh 

79.44 85.70 B: well you know what i'd do i'd go to um the art schools and i'd look at uh all the emerging artists 

85.61 87.33 A: right 

86.18 90.54 B: and uh you know because they i think they tend to have the most potential and are doing the the 

90.58 94.19 B: more radical types of things that are less you know 

93.31 97.10 A: all right so the first thing you would do is look for talent as opposed to 

97.15 99.16 A: location location location 

99.35 108.25 B: right right although you know that's a g- you bring up a good point you know i think location is definitely important but money's not an object so i think that i could whatever space i want 

109.11 110.06 A: true 

110.65 115.55 B: so uh yeah i'd go i'd go after the people first um 

114.64 116.33 A: (( rush for the talent )) 

115.97 119.31 B: [lipsmack] yeah and then i'd i guess i'd after that i'd go and hire some 

119.40 127.46 B: in parallel i'd go and hire some people that that had experience with running galleries and you know handling the marketing end and then i'd hire some p._r. people 

127.27 128.25 A: way to go [noise] 

127.93 131.34 B: but i think i'd depend on myself for the uh for the kind of art 

131.65 133.76 B: um the artistic 

133.87 136.27 B: kind of editing which you know bringing on people 

136.66 139.37 B: it would be up to like my my vision of like what uh 

139.47 142.14 B: you know what aesthetic i want my gallery to represent 

141.71 155.67 A: yeah and because money is no object then you're making like uh you know quarter of a million dollar education grants to fund new artists because you know they'll be in your stable when they're done 

154.48 159.00 B: yeah and you you can have the patience you know to 

159.34 162.30 B: take a loss for thirty years [laughter] or something 

161.76 166.42 A: well yeah and th- and the thing is too it's it's it's this year's crop it's 

166.63 175.70 A: it's almost like football or uh any other uh a- athletic sport where you have to recruit it's i- it's your best players you know you're out 

172.52 173.45 B: yeah 

175.42 176.51 B: exactly 

176.37 180.94 A: yeah it's exac- to keep those oh like the modeling agencies i mean they'd have to build that up 

176.64 177.79 B: exactly 

180.63 184.04 B: yeah yeah i mean that they it's constantly being refreshed 

184.46 186.44 B: it's just kinda the nature of the business 

186.85 193.76 B: uh how successful do i think i would be um i think i think i would be it depends on how you're measuring success i guess 

193.75 208.65 B: uh again since money's not an object i'm not too worried about profits so i wouldn't use that as a um as a measurement but uh in terms of enjoyment or in terms of uh furthering the you know the cause of just getting good photography out there i think i'd be pretty successful 

208.84 210.67 A: yeah 

209.21 211.63 B: you know i think a lot about it and i read a lot about it so 

211.56 217.58 A: well you know what's interesting about that though is not i think the premise behind this conversation in terms of money is not an object 

217.80 218.94 A: is 

219.44 231.13 A: [sigh] i don't know to put it it it's it's it's false premise because i don't care if you're if you're donald trump or you're money is always an option [laughter] i don't care how much money you have 

229.16 230.58 B: (( hm )) 

231.33 240.31 A: i you you thinking oh you're not particularly concerned about profitability or you know the bottom line you like the intrinsic value that would bring to you the pleasure behind it 

240.01 240.82 B: right 

240.40 242.83 A: uh i think probably 

243.11 247.88 A: uh i- in in most cases even if you 

248.13 254.99 A: wanted to continue to have that kind of intrinsic val- and and and feeling of goodness about it 

255.17 262.67 A: money will be an object [laughter] i mean there there there will be a for you to continue to receive and feel good about what you're doing 

262.74 270.40 A: [cough] there is a money issue even if you're the wealthiest man in the world you're still thinking about what do i need to spend to keep this going [noise] 

270.45 272.31 A: to keep myself happy 

270.81 274.80 B: yeah well i i mean but i i think that that's more a logistical issue 

274.89 277.83 B: uh and a financial issue rather than a 

275.51 276.22 A: mm 

277.86 278.88 B: a goal 

279.21 280.63 B: than you know having [mn] 

280.58 282.07 A: exactly [sigh] 

280.82 282.87 B: establishing profitability as 

282.89 296.73 B: um as a goal for the company itself i mean like you look at foundations and stuff and they they have different types of measuring sticks one of them surely it's financial but uh in other ways it's also just effectiveness effectiveness of the programs like how many people are they helping 

296.16 305.37 A: [noise] exactly but there's still a board of directors looking at the books i mean you can tell where i'm coming from i'm in i'm in marketing and i'm and i'm and i'm in a big business 

301.03 302.15 B: yeah yeah yeah 

305.44 307.49 A: you know big company 

307.73 311.61 A: [cough] and i'm challenged every day for a return on investment you know what are you doing 

310.98 312.55 B: yeah yeah yeah definitely 

311.69 324.49 A: so i'm wondering if i had to reset this the conversation and uh w- we're not gonna do that 'cause we're gonna go by the rules that they've given us but you know i'd say if you had one million dollars what would you do as opposed to money's not a question 

317.42 318.31 B: sure 

325.37 332.31 A: now [mn] for me personally i [mn] if if i had one million dollars or if money wasn't a question i think what i would do 

333.05 334.06 A: uh 

334.76 349.35 A: is probably create something similar to what you're talking about but instead of photography i would create a stable of the very best voices in the business for both audio and video 

349.48 352.27 A: uh uh work 

351.46 355.00 B: right right sort of like a talent agency that specializes in those 

353.68 356.83 A: a talent agency specializing in voice 

356.33 357.81 B: do those exist already 

357.92 358.97 A: yeah they do 

359.39 369.94 A: but i don't think there is any one that has a a really good collective uh group where you're the one stop shopping as opposed to some of the uh high power agencies out in l._a. 

369.89 378.19 A: uh for actors and things like that or for models and things like that in new york uh i don't think there's a one stop shop voice place 

377.63 379.13 B: mhm why do you think that is 

379.33 385.53 A: um because it's i- it's incredibly competitive and now that money is no object in this scenario 

385.55 391.25 A: i would snake every single best voice that there is [mn] and this would cover 

391.45 399.54 A: uh i i would become the agency of choice for um [lipsmack] uh the famous sports voices the famous uh 

399.67 400.61 A: (( uh )) 

400.43 412.95 A: conan o'brien's announcer here's conan would be my guy he'd be on my on my team right and i'd get everybody i'd get the guys that can do the uh character voices i'd get the guys that could do you know 

402.61 404.60 B: (( [lipsmack] oh i see i see )) 

412.71 425.09 A: i i would probably try to snake uh that guy uh who makes like i don't know ten to forty thousand dollars every time he ever says let's get ready to rumble i'd get him on board 

424.18 426.40 B: yeah [lipsmack] you could get the other movietone guy too 

426.71 433.66 A: e- exactly i'd have [mn] i'd have all of those in in one place and and because of the 

433.78 443.88 A: uh buy uh not buying power the uh the marketing power of having everyone you know that you could and there again just like you you know you start looking for those young talent i 

445.08 446.56 B: interesting interesting 

445.86 450.32 A: was going to do a commercial you're trying to find that next lady who's gonna be where's the beef 

450.10 451.24 B: yeah 

450.65 459.00 A: you know you start shopping that because and and then you you could pay that off y- you you dominate the world you dominate the world [mn] [mn] 

457.38 464.77 B: but there's there's high crossover with with the uh talent agencies in general though i mean because like [mn] don't normal talent agencies like cross 

465.02 466.70 B: you know like they they kind of uh 

466.75 470.48 B: cross train you know like for example that the where is the beef woman she uh 

470.63 472.69 B: you know she's an actor or actress 

472.47 480.22 A: she was an actress yeah yeah and that's and that that would be kinda hard to negotiate because being able to pull everybody under one umbrella 

474.30 475.46 B: and just so ha- 

478.02 479.47 B: (( hm )) 

480.32 485.32 A: so that's when you get all these a- agents involved you know these independent agents 

483.26 484.09 B: mhm 

485.50 490.86 A: uh at the end of the day it's gonna be you know what's my cut of the action if i sign on with you what happens 

490.44 497.22 B: and also but another trend is that that you know especially in commercials and and animated features more and more they're relying on famous voices 

498.17 501.71 B: or act- you know successful actors and actresses in their own right 

498.50 499.81 A: (( yeah a- )) 

501.08 509.56 A: and and quite frankly um those actors that you know you know they love that th- that work because it's choo 

509.61 513.83 A: it's c- com- compared with what they get paid for the time they put in 

513.51 514.65 B: yeah 

514.05 516.74 A: it pays you know hugely 

516.58 517.34 B: huh 

517.25 519.59 A: i mean what's the guy who was uh 

519.64 521.44 A: what's the guy on roseanne 

521.66 523.10 B: tom arnold 

522.55 533.88 A: yeah tom i mean no no no no no uh john goodman i think his name is [mn] yeah he's made he's made a huge amount of money doing disney getting connected with disney and doing voices 

525.52 527.25 B: (( oh yeah yeah )) 

533.30 535.54 B: oh yeah yeah 

535.71 542.35 A: i mean so yeah yeah that would be that now that that's a different angle altogether y- i think i probably would leave that alone 

542.51 549.32 A: because if you got famous pe- if you were trying to get jack nicholson to do a voice on on a cartoon then that's gonna be 

545.80 547.74 B: right right 

547.93 549.65 B: you're dealing with his agent you know 

549.47 559.24 A: yeah that's gonna be a separate separate ball game altogether so i guess what you what i'm really saying in uh in and that was a good point you made though is that i would go for the 

559.50 564.91 A: i don't know if it's [mn] tier two or run of the mill but you know 

565.18 570.15 A: you know [mn] uh voices r. us except for those really famous people 

567.80 569.30 B: right right right 

570.39 583.21 A: because basically that's basically you know what what a what a um [noise] what a jack nicholson can do anyone could do it it's the marketability is the fact that jack nicholson pays the voice of 

581.69 583.20 B: is the brand yes 

583.66 586.96 A: a- and that's what's helps to sell the movie [noise] [noise] 

585.78 588.37 B: right do you think you'd be successful at it 

588.44 599.89 A: (( um yeah i i i think i would um [noise] [lipsmack] i've i've kind of looked into this a little [noise] i try to um to see if there's a )) 

595.56 596.43 B: mhm
