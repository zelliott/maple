0.47 2.95 B: hello i'm laureen towler 

2.61 4.90 A: hi i'm davis colera 

4.34 13.17 B: good to meet ya [laughter] okay so uh what what wh- what type of business would we uh start if we could start a business 

5.20 6.52 A: uh likewise 

13.41 15.67 B: uh do you have any ideas [laughter] 

14.83 20.24 A: oh yeah me myself i'd probably uh start uh an import uh business 

20.03 20.85 B: uh-huh 

20.70 22.12 A: uh-huh yeah 

21.17 22.92 B: what would you what you would import 

22.36 36.59 A: well uh i used to live in bolivia for quite a few years so uh there's a lot of products from uh well you know it's a lot of products from around the world probably don't get to the united states until their marketed precisely in our well or to american tastes so 

36.62 46.20 A: you notice a lot of stuff coming in lately you know from i don't know for instance i could remember ever eating before so but it's pretty good and now it's popular and so on right 

43.66 44.69 B: mhm 

45.83 46.87 B: yeah 

46.18 51.94 A: yeah there's quite a few things outside in the world that uh could be marketed pretty well in europe or the united states 

52.46 55.88 B: uh that sounds good well you sound like you know what you're doing i i haven't 

55.78 66.40 B: i i'm an artist i'm in uh theatre so um i think the type of business i would start would probably be something related to what i already do so i guess i would actually try to start my own theatre company 

58.14 59.05 A: uh-huh 

66.27 79.44 B: and and run it and staff you know get a staff season the actors and that sort of thing but it a- it isn't something i've actually thought a great deal about because as an actor i'm more of a hired hand 

79.42 87.64 B: you know [laughter] um but i mean if money were no object which they said it wasn't then i guess i could hire the right people to 

80.13 81.27 A: right 

85.05 85.86 A: uh-huh 

87.90 90.23 B: help me do it [laughter] 

88.03 97.22 A: yeah yeah yeah that's true uh or where where do you live is it like new york or something [laughter] figures 

93.33 102.77 B: yeah yeah i'm i'm in new york so yeah so i'm in the theatre here and you know real estate is awfully high and stuff so um but again they said money's no object so 

99.37 100.91 A: uh-huh yeah 

102.45 103.61 A: yeah 

102.91 112.56 B: i think that's what i'd do i i now whether i'd be good at it i'm sure i'd make a lot of mistakes in the beginning since i don't have a business background but you do right 

111.28 112.12 A: uh-huh 

112.55 113.37 A: no 

113.25 114.26 B: oh you don't 

113.44 121.69 A: no i don't i i figure i wouldn't be good unless i had some help in the correct things you know i've got a a good idea of what could come in and um 

121.70 127.13 A: maybe some interesting um in in marketing and so on uh 

127.14 135.32 A: i got a good enough accounting background but that isn't the same thing you know i guess you have to find people that know how to market these things that's the main thing and uh 

129.29 130.38 B: mhm 

135.22 136.30 B: yeah it is 

135.37 137.09 A: second yeah 

136.46 148.76 B: and then you need well i guess the first thing you need is like a what a business plan right isn't that what business people do they have a business plan about like where they're gonna be and o- one year two year five years that type of thing 

140.86 142.22 A: oh yeah definitely 

148.18 149.62 A: mhm 

149.45 157.24 B: so you know what if money were no object i think i would go back to school [laughter] and take some classes [laughter] i'd do this because i 

153.40 154.67 A: [laughter] 

157.65 167.41 B: mean it's a big thing to run your company to run a company and especially these days you know because even the even the big companies are having troub- [laughter] problems 

159.92 160.89 A: yeah 

162.46 164.03 A: yeah yeah 

167.30 176.48 A: yeah these days are really sort of hard especially for arts my my sister's a an opera singer so she hasn't been able to get any contracts this year she's only just starting but still you know 

176.41 177.45 B: yeah 

176.59 181.06 A: last year she had one contract and uh now this year it's like whoa nothing [laughter] 

180.36 185.90 B: yeah yeah the well i mean you know when business is down then the arts as well 

185.64 186.97 A: yeah 

186.57 190.99 B: you know sort of suffer because you know business comes first and everything 

188.27 189.29 A: uh-huh 

190.16 194.81 A: yeah would you would you do only theatre or do you think of movies also 

191.07 191.84 B: (( when i )) 

195.59 206.23 B: well no i think i think i would start with i think uh i think if i were going to start a business uh a a movie production company would be something i'd do maybe after i ran a theatre company 'cause that's smaller 

201.97 202.77 A: uh-huh 

206.07 206.98 A: yeah 

206.08 213.08 B: you know that's more manageable i mean like here in new york they have small theatre companies that are like ninety nine seats 

211.03 211.89 A: right 

212.90 221.83 B: and you know in a- a- actually it's not i just came from an event tonight that had a fundraiser for a theatre company that's sort of building itself from the ground up 

219.43 220.38 A: uh-huh 

221.62 232.18 B: and so i sort of see how they operate and um and and what they have to do to do that they were fundraising tonight so i'd have to you know have fundraising parties to get the capital 

224.04 224.97 A: yeah 

232.08 240.51 B: e- except the i keep forgetting they said money's no object [laughter] wouldn't isn't that a lovely thought [laughter] 

235.00 235.98 A: yeah 

236.16 237.48 A: (( [laughter] )) 

238.25 251.46 A: yeah that's true well there's certainly a lot of of smaller towns that uh probably wouldn't mind a theatre opening or or two or outlying areas or things like that you know going all the way to the downtown must be sort of 

245.38 246.75 B: absolutely 

248.33 249.31 B: yeah 

251.46 254.24 A: [laughter] that'd be sort of difficult 

254.12 254.97 B: right 

254.60 255.64 A: yeah 

255.06 262.49 B: yeah so uh you said you spent time in i- i- i- in bolivia so ye- well that's fascinating so um 

259.26 260.65 A: bolivia right 

262.50 270.36 B: [lipsmack] so your business would you have like clothing in the business or or foods or what what do you think you would import 

269.97 276.35 A: well that that would be probably uh the point well foods are sorta difficult because uh a farmer um 

274.42 275.31 B: (( mhm mm )) 

276.36 285.11 A: farmers are pretty well organized and in the united states and it's very hard to import uh foods from anywhere else i think the only country that really imports is like uh 

285.19 292.29 A: choo- choose the only country that uh does a good job importing to the united states i think it took years in being able to do that 

291.92 293.18 B: mhm 

292.58 301.93 A: yeah and they did it off season of course bolivia could do that that too but uh like i say you know it's it's a big big uh union that the farmers have and they do a lot of lobbying 

300.05 301.12 B: uh-huh 

302.02 303.07 B: (( mhm )) 

302.17 303.15 A: uh 

303.77 313.58 A: i guess textiles are at a the way to go there's a lot of handmade textiles which is interesting enough of course uh thing about handmade textiles is that you know 

305.49 306.73 B: (( ah )) 

308.11 309.14 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

313.50 322.12 A: it's a decorative and there's only so much so much market that you can do on that ah otherwise it's uh you could go to the um 

322.16 328.77 A: [lipsmack] to the uh uh well there's certain food types that you can import i suppose like quionoa's pretty popular 

328.67 329.90 B: ooh what's that 

329.73 335.94 A: quionoa uh that's you'll see it o- some some stores that's it's a green sort of like a 

336.06 341.94 A: really really tiny round little balls and uh you cook it like rice basically 

338.23 339.04 B: mm 

341.41 342.46 B: oh wow oh 

342.07 343.08 A: yeah 

342.61 344.96 B: i know what you mean begins with a q 

344.81 345.63 A: yeah 

345.00 350.25 B: q. u. i. o. n. o. a. okay yeah i just discovered that recently [noise] 

346.31 347.21 A: yeah 

347.73 348.72 A: yeah 

349.31 355.29 A: yeah that's really got a pac- packs a lot of uh lot of punch and and you know as far as uh 

355.31 357.12 A: vitamins and all that stuff 

356.33 357.78 B: mhm 

357.18 358.24 A: uh 

357.86 364.53 B: that'd be a good that'd be a smart thing 'cause people are very health conscious and things these days unless they're whole grain right yeah 

361.77 362.70 A: oh yeah 

363.07 374.50 A: oh yeah well there there's a lot of well mostly what they bring in is the peruvian stuff although the peruvians actually uh because of their climate can't really make the best quionoa uh quionoa by 

374.78 377.78 A: has to be the best one is made in in 

377.88 384.66 A: in uh in bolivia it's it has to do you have to have really dry weather in order to make it uh correctly 

379.76 380.54 B: mm 

382.47 383.56 B: i see 

384.08 385.24 B: mhm 

384.62 397.32 A: uh there's also amaranth which is uh another thing oh there's lots of greens that uh probably doesn't doesn't come here um let's see gunyowee that's uh that actually has the most uh 

397.45 405.17 A: the most uh nut- nutrition value my father-in-law he he actually did the first studies on quionoa back in the seventies 

403.88 404.57 B: (( mm )) 

404.66 405.66 B: mhm 

405.07 412.70 A: yeah back in bolivia [laughter] so he he knows quite a bit about this but any case there's at least two or three grains that are out 

406.91 407.50 B: (( mm )) 

412.94 416.85 A: out there that still haven't gone to the united states and quionoa has had some fair 

416.88 418.28 A: fair reception 

418.10 432.18 B: yeah i went looking for it recently and when i h- heard about it for a recipe and i was like what is this i had to hunt a little bit 'til 'til i found it so you would you wouldn't need like an office uh would you have an office with this business how does that work if you're importing 

419.88 420.75 A: uh-huh 

423.45 424.56 A: yeah 

431.92 445.08 A: well the question is done on the marketing uh first thing uh a lot of people you know that are health food want organic certification you know you have to get some uh organization to come in and certify your your organisity [laughter] i don't know what to call it 

434.40 435.38 B: mhm 

438.29 439.39 B: right 

445.33 454.09 A: uh offices um [lipsmack] well bolivia just started getting uh some uh um preferred status in uh importation you know 

454.02 463.05 A: mostly because they want to build up e- economies so that isn't uh it's to uh get people off a off cocaine or coca leaf um growing 

460.81 462.17 B: (( mm mm )) 

463.03 472.40 A: and uh textiles are finally in that's one of the toughest ones so actually a lot of people are starting to make shirts in bolivia and there might not there might be flight movement that 

466.63 467.79 B: mhm 

472.27 473.26 B: mhm 

472.41 473.48 A: but uh 

473.53 478.45 A: it just i just think that it would be best if you uh if you take use that um 

478.61 480.89 A: open market and uh use the uh 

481.04 490.96 A: uh well let's see there's all ty- of course there's all types of wools in bolivia that you don't get you know the llama wool the um [lipsmack] the alpaca wool the the etc etc etc 

486.83 488.65 B: mm oh right 

490.61 492.87 B: huh the well you sound quite doable 

492.92 494.17 A: [laughter] 

493.14 496.21 B: [laughter] yes it sounded like you were giving it some thought [laughter] 

495.76 500.28 A: i rooted the ideas i just don't think i'd be that great at the marketing and uh 

499.22 500.33 B: uh-huh 

500.89 502.36 A: and 

500.90 503.26 B: (( but you can hire somebody )) 

502.65 508.04 A: yeah w- wi- with the unlimited amount of money that i have right [laughter] 

503.45 505.11 B: some guy from 

505.94 513.47 B: yeah that's [laughter] absolutely so i'm trying to think here with my company what kind of plays i would produce um [lipsmack] 

513.54 515.61 B: let's see i think 

515.89 528.48 B: i think i'd try to i'd have a season that has uh you know i'd have a musical in there maybe to get the because people seem to love to come to new york to do musicals and to see musicals so i would nab them with a musical but then 

520.50 521.36 A: uh-huh 

524.67 525.54 A: yeah 

528.25 533.35 B: i would try to do maybe something that they've never seen before you know what i mean to 

532.68 533.87 A: yeah 

533.36 547.17 B: to sort of educate people because otherwise they'll just come and they'll just want musicals all the time but there's there's a lot of straight plays that um you know are very thought provoking and moving and you know funny and all sorts of things that you could do 

535.27 536.15 A: uh-huh 

538.10 539.00 A: right 

543.78 544.69 A: uh-huh 

546.46 552.53 A: yeah and the nice thing about plays is that you you know you can do two or three theatric plays and start off really small 

547.25 548.18 B: to um 

552.24 562.46 B: right exactly yeah so i think that would be a good thing to do and and uh since money's no object it would have to be pretty much in the center of manhattan 

552.73 553.62 A: yeah 

553.78 554.67 A: uh-huh 

562.39 563.25 A: uh-huh 

562.78 568.85 B: because uh people won't go to the you know there's certain sections people just won't travel to 

568.60 569.53 A: uh-huh 

569.21 576.75 B: but they but people are very comfortable coming to downtown i mean what we could actually what we call midtown near near forty second street 

572.16 572.98 A: yeah 

576.57 577.54 A: right 

576.95 580.93 B: so i think uh i'd put the theatre there um 

581.08 591.22 B: i think though in terms of they asked if we felt we'd be good at it i think i'd be a good artistic director picking the seasons acting in the play casting the play 

588.57 589.48 A: uh-huh 

591.16 599.89 B: but i don't know that i'd be [laughter] a good businessperson in terms of people buying tickets and and you know making sure that you meet the
