9.04 11.37 A: yeah are you [laughter] sorry [laughter] 

9.78 10.62 B: yes 

10.88 12.30 B: ((  )) 

11.70 16.22 A: no i have a little boy so i was trying to do something with him before i got started so 

15.65 16.89 B: (( about opening our own business )) 

16.81 17.71 A: um 

18.27 20.51 A: (( [sigh] )) 

20.06 21.18 B: (( [laughter] yes )) 

20.85 26.62 A: yes actually i have an idea for one and i would actually really like to do it at some point 

26.36 27.39 B: oh really 

26.92 28.47 A: yeah um 

29.02 32.63 A: we have two little boys under the age of two 

32.68 43.02 A: and it's impossible unless you go to like baby gap or gymbaree or something children's place it's impossible to find like little boy's clothes if you go anywhere else there's a million 

43.20 55.82 A: racks of little girl's clothes anything you could ever imagine and th- there's like three racks of baby boy clothes [laughter] so all the g- all the you can tell all the kids in the neighborhood because they all kind of wear the same thing [laughter] 

46.86 48.18 B: right [laughter] 

49.74 50.95 B: right [laughter] 

55.28 56.55 B: right [laughter] 

56.13 68.47 A: so i'd like to open like an upscale or i you know medium to upscale little boys' um clothing store just nothing have absolutely nothing pink or anything in there it's all for boys stuff [laughter] so 

66.47 67.49 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

68.58 71.38 A: that's actually what i'd like to do so 

72.08 75.96 B: well i haven't really thought about this before but um 

77.94 84.45 B: i kind of would like to do a restaurant i like the whole getting to know people just a small restaurant huh 

84.24 88.77 A: i think a restaurant actually or a bar would be really fun [laughter] 

87.20 92.60 B: yeah a bar yeah i never thought of a bar that would be even better [laughter] 

91.91 101.46 A: well a bar would be fun but i think there's like so much liability and stuff you know and people are you get it's easy to get in trouble i think when people start acting stupid and 

95.82 96.89 B: right 

101.08 102.30 B: (( r- right )) 

101.36 115.17 A: leave and drive drunk or get in fights or whatever so i think it would be really fun just to have kind of a neighborhood kind of pub bar you know somewhere just to hang out you know where everybody's like really comfortable and drinking beer and stuff that would be fun too 

110.57 111.57 B: right 

114.50 116.79 B: yeah and not a big one [laughter] 

116.46 122.46 A: oh no [laughter] i mean yeah unless you have like a ton of money and you wanna open some kind of nightclub thing but 

121.55 122.56 B: right 

122.68 124.85 A: but um yeah 

125.08 127.99 A: um where where are you calling from 

127.66 130.49 B: um the houston area houston texas 

129.15 129.96 A: (( oh oh )) 

130.01 131.07 A: okay 

131.11 145.21 A: 'cause there's like they just like redid i'm in denver they've redid our downtown and stuff and when i first moved to denver it was all like a warehouse as in craft stuff i mean if i would have a mon- the money then i would have bought a bunch of stuff now it's all 

134.81 135.64 B: [noise] 

145.20 151.22 A: upscale and million dollar lofts and bars and [laughter] stuff like that so i missed out so 

151.30 152.34 B: right 

151.87 161.07 A: [noise] but um i don't know what else we so we're i guess we're would we be good business owners i think my only problem would be when people 

161.09 166.31 A: sometimes i have problems dealing with idiots in the general public [laughter] 

165.06 166.86 B: [laughter] right 

166.67 173.79 A: [mn] you know 'cause i know i a friend of ours owned a clothing store for little girls actually in another town and people would like 

173.74 184.10 A: it was obvious what they'd do they'd go like buy a party dress wear it over the weekend and then return it you know [laughter] and stuff like that i think i'd get kinda mad about it you know stuff like that or 

179.14 180.55 B: oh yeah 

182.15 183.22 B: right 

184.45 198.55 A: um you know shoplifters and things like that and i think you'd have to put so much time and energy and blood sweat and tears and money and everything into it i'd have to wait until my kids are a little bit older but other than that 

197.35 199.90 B: yeah it would become your life pretty much [laughter] 

199.56 202.11 A: well exactly so um 

202.89 206.87 A: what kind of restaurant do you think any kind of like ethnic food or 

207.03 209.44 B: probably just 

209.50 210.81 B: just kinda 

211.05 219.84 B: american food just like hamburgers and i'm not real into chinese or anything like that [laughter] 

219.17 223.45 A: yeah and i think it's easier to find people i think the chefs are 

223.60 228.29 A: more er you don't even have to go for a chef you know if you have just like 

226.56 227.50 B: right 

228.32 229.52 A: regular 

229.55 230.61 B: cooks [laughter] 

229.65 230.66 A: um 

230.75 238.99 A: [laughter] i mean a lot of people can fry hamburgers and stuff and a lot of them are really good and it's a fun place to come and everything i mean people will 

239.42 244.42 A: people will come you know it's not like you know and then if you try to get some 

240.59 241.68 B: yeah 

244.36 256.43 A: weird like there's one that opened in our neighborhood it's like asian and italian fusion or something [laughter] i mean it's bizarre i mean it's kinda cool but it's kinda bizarre you have to be in the right mood to go there 

250.05 251.40 B: oh really 

255.68 257.21 B: right [laughter] 

256.61 267.83 A: and they're really like presumptuous too i mean the waiters it's like you know you're a waiter get over [laughter] yourself [laughter] you know it's kind of a or you 

263.34 264.85 B: right [laughter] 

267.84 278.31 A: you order a bottle of wine and it's like oh we don't have the twenty dollar bottle of wine but we have the seventy five dollar bottle of wine that'll go much better with your meal anyway so [laughter] 

273.85 275.30 B: right [laughter] 

277.90 279.16 B: yeah 

278.91 283.29 A: it's just really bizarre so but yeah i think that'd be fun 'cause there's 

283.87 286.45 B: 'cause see i live in a real small town and so 

284.06 284.84 A: people 

286.46 295.96 B: we don't have anything real classy um yeah so probably medium like middle class type of restaurant would be better here 

288.84 289.83 A: oh really 

295.79 296.66 A: really 

296.32 303.14 B: 'cause i don't th- i mean it would have to be just like for people's special occasions if it was up class or 

303.05 304.23 A: right 

303.22 304.60 B: (( fancy at all )) 

304.49 305.54 A: right 

305.16 311.31 B: so if you wanted that [noise] it to be like an everyday thing for people to be able to come [noise] 

308.72 309.93 A: right 

311.98 318.50 A: then you'd probably get lots of like repeat business and stuff too people don't have to wait for a special occasion and stuff 

314.40 315.32 B: right 

317.71 318.74 B: right 

318.75 322.89 A: is there a good place to have it there i mean is there already like 

322.30 324.46 B: we only have two sit down places 

324.21 325.26 A: oh really 

324.83 326.09 B: yeah so 

325.40 326.77 A: oh yeah so 

326.22 327.32 B: we have a l- 

327.41 336.04 B: hopefully we'll grow a lot and and anything sit down here is a real big success i'm surprised there's not many more 

335.85 338.26 A: oh yeah that is kind of weird so 

337.71 340.29 B: yeah 'cause if you go out on the weekends you 

340.33 341.59 B: either have 

342.00 348.33 B: those two to choose from or fast food so there's not or you have to drive the next town is fifteen minutes so 

344.29 345.23 A: oh 

349.16 356.84 A: i was my boyf- or this guy i used to date when i was in college he was from a really small town in kansas and they only had one sit down restaurant 

356.67 368.75 A: and on friday nights it was pancake night and so [laughter] if you were not in the mood for pancakes you were like you either had to go to the next town or you were staying home because you didn't even have like a fast food option or anything so 

359.51 360.32 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

367.05 368.33 B: wow 

369.00 381.63 A: but that's the big deal it's pancake night on friday night or [laughter] so go over to the restaurant so i guess if it obviously it works for them and when you're the only restaurant in town you can do what you want so 

372.67 373.81 B: (( [laughter] )) 

375.58 376.55 B: (( [noise] right )) 

380.21 381.43 B: yeah 

381.65 383.44 B: (( people yeah )) 

383.17 389.92 A: but there's like a ton of strip malls around here so i think i'd pretty easily you know find a clothing store 

389.96 395.53 A: because it seems like a lot of bridal shops were opening up here and now a lot of them have closed so 

394.90 396.06 B: oh really 

395.60 397.07 A: yeah 

397.59 402.58 A: so i think i probably could get space pretty cheap hopefully so 

402.68 411.28 A: but the thing is you know since y- we know nothing i've never even worked in retail so i would have actually really have nowhere to begin so 

411.39 418.72 A: but i guess if i'm working for myself i could probably you know do what i want i would i d- i don't have to worry about pleasing somebody else 

414.79 416.44 B: [noise] yeah [laughter] 

418.08 419.13 B: (( right [mn] )) 

418.80 419.65 A: so 

420.12 428.40 A: so you know i'd like to do it someday plus i'd like to work for myself and and stuff you don't have to worry about that kind of stuff and 

427.98 428.96 B: right 

428.68 435.84 A: you know when my kids get older and they have you know baseball games and soccer games and stuff like that that'll uh [mn] 

435.14 436.08 B: yeah i'm 

435.91 439.78 A: be a lot easier for me to participate in that kind of stuff 

436.26 436.82 B: (( [mn] )) 

437.24 438.23 B: right 

438.77 439.64 B: (( [noise] )) 

441.33 448.78 B: [noise] yeah i've also what i'll probably end up doing is actually having an accounting firm because that's what i'm going to school for right now 

448.46 449.50 A: oh really 

449.10 452.70 B: so in reality that's what i'll probably end up with huh 

453.35 462.32 A: i er dropped out of accounting and ended up getting a finance degree so [laughter] i was an accounting major for like three years and then i switched over to finance so 

456.68 457.82 B: oh really 

461.51 465.58 B: yeah [laughter] i have one more year l- one more year left so 

464.91 467.25 A: do you go to that school in houston then or 

466.76 468.45 B: um i go to annum 

468.29 469.49 A: (( [noise] oh okay )) 

468.89 469.96 B: (( [noise] yes )) 

472.11 478.69 A: [noise] woops [laughter] someone's mad at [noise] me now [noise] it's okay [noise] 

475.35 476.24 B: [laughter] 

479.79 483.11 A: so did you grow up there or oh okay 

481.49 483.84 B: yes i'm just here for the summer 

483.78 485.00 A: oh oh 

484.19 488.78 B: and i'm actually working i'm gonna manage at a rest- one of the two restaurants 

488.46 494.20 A: [noise] oh really [noise] [noise] oh so you'd have the experience [noise] anyway so [noise] 

489.32 490.61 B: (( here yeah )) 

491.71 498.01 B: yeah i i mean i waited tables during high school and now i'm [noise] managing for the summer 

494.44 497.12 A: [noise] oh wow 

497.72 507.35 A: so you're like way ahead of me on the [laughter] business scale anyway so that's one thing i was always afraid to work in the restaur- in food for some reason i don't know so 

499.57 501.02 B: [laughter] 

501.62 503.02 B: r- right [noise] 

507.38 511.66 B: it hasn't been bad i've heard stories but so far so good 

507.60 508.25 A: (( c- )) 

511.00 522.86 A: well there's that book out that like some waitress wrote [laughter] she was a waitress for like twenty years and it's like all the secrets of the kitchen and all the things that the waiters and waitresses used to do to people [laughter] and stuff it's like 

522.13 523.45 B: yeah 

522.87 524.61 A: (( okay [laughter] )) 

524.39 526.26 B: don't wanna read that book [laughter] 

525.60 531.06 A: [laughter] yeah i'll probably never never ever eat out again so [noise] 

529.89 530.94 B: right 

535.45 538.16 B: [noise] so you just want little boy clothes 

538.21 546.28 A: yeah i mean 'cause it's so hard unless i mean you can buy stuff at target and stuff if you want to but if you want something a little bit nicer and 

545.60 546.50 B: right 

546.64 555.90 A: you know a little bit v- of variety but it's just like every store you walk into it's you know just tons of little girls' stuff and hardly anything of little boys maybe they 

556.10 561.43 A: think that little boys you know you don't care about dressing your kid up or anything like that [laughter] 

559.60 562.06 B: right 'cause yeah 

562.06 564.94 A: but um yeah i think i mean it'd be 

564.75 572.44 A: devoted exclusively to boys because i've heard a lot of people complain about that too you know that they have a really hard time finding boys' clothes and 

572.23 581.36 A: i do i take him to daycare and they're like oh what you know hadyn has that shirt oh he has those shorts [laughter] it's like you know exactly where everybody shops 

577.66 578.82 B: right [laughter] 

580.91 582.29 B: exact- yeah 

581.47 590.09 A: which i mean that's not that big of a deal but you'd like to have a a little bit of choice and stuff like that i mean i didn't know my first son was a boy 

585.95 587.04 B: right 

590.28 597.97 A: and he had like nothing blue it was all green and [laughter] yellow and everything and half the stuff you could probably pass off for girls' stuff but 

597.27 598.38 B: right 

598.01 599.89 A: but no i kind of want my
