0.70 2.03 B: this is rob 

1.88 3.85 A: hi this is lloyd 

4.32 6.10 B: [cough] hey lloyd how you doing 

5.81 7.20 A: okay how are you 

7.29 14.13 B: i'm doing all right so if we were gonna open our own business what would we do any ideas 

14.69 21.38 A: um is it together or is it like separate individually 

18.34 22.03 B: i think separate just our individual ideas 

21.68 23.32 A: oh okay [lipsmack] 

23.86 24.60 B: (( [noise] )) 

24.04 38.31 A: um yeah i've thought about it before um i've always kinda wanted to open like um a little hobby shop or something because when i was a kid i used to like to build those plastic models 

33.46 34.32 B: uh 

37.76 40.99 B: right yeah and i used to go to those all the time 

40.16 53.26 A: yeah so i thought that'd be nice and then like the hobby shops i used to go to as a kid they never really had enough room to carry a lot of models so i i think that'd be cool to have a whole bunch and like 

49.50 50.94 B: yeah 

53.18 56.68 A: build a few and put 'em on display or something 

56.57 58.02 B: that that would be cool 

58.88 61.13 B: and now what part of the country are you in 

61.16 63.69 A: in california 

63.19 64.43 B: oh okay me too 

65.43 66.33 B: um 

66.39 67.84 A: what would you like to do 

68.29 71.83 B: um i think i'd wanna like open a restaurant 

71.68 73.16 A: (( oh )) 

71.94 75.21 B: i've always been in a bit of an amateur chef 

75.54 83.65 B: and [cough] i've worked at a few restaurants i always got the idea that i could do it well um 

83.04 83.90 A: uh-huh 

83.80 96.93 B: i don't think i'd do it here in l._a. just because there's so much competition so much depends on what's hip right now and just and of course it's just so expensive just to have the space 

97.31 101.35 A: right yeah i'm 

97.67 99.71 B: just about anywhere in l._a. 

99.77 101.94 B: i'd have to go somewhere smaller i 

102.24 106.06 A: i'm in the san francisco bay area and it's really competitive here 

106.05 108.31 B: think yeah oh yeah real- 

106.45 109.81 A: too it's like restaurant restaurants open and close all the time 

110.19 116.37 B: yeah even even more competitive for food and for food quality and for uh 

116.76 119.08 B: for uh real estate 

117.02 118.43 A: mhm 

120.50 121.58 B: up there 

120.80 121.69 A: so 

121.95 129.33 A: so would you um would you just like go and try and open it or would you go to cooking school or anything first or 

130.61 131.37 B: (( hm )) 

132.04 140.60 B: i would either go to cooking school or i would have a at least one chef there who is formally trained 

140.30 141.21 A: uh-huh 

142.25 143.88 B: (( and [cough] )) 

144.55 145.70 B: i'm uh 

145.92 150.40 B: i'm not sure i don't think i'd go for the whole five star restaurant thing because 

149.02 150.60 A: [laughter] 

150.67 157.19 B: i just don't have enough experience in that route i think i'd go for something a little more middle of the road 

157.90 163.42 B: and just just try to have some unique dishes and unique atmosphere 

164.10 165.87 B: i always liked 

166.89 171.62 B: th- i always liked uh where i went to college in uh south georgia 

173.09 184.14 B: there was just an ambiance to it my favorite restaurant was this place and i think it was all right but the great thing is it was based it was on a swamp lake it was 

181.63 184.85 A: mhm 

184.06 190.14 B: you had a little biddy inside part where the kitchen was but the restaurant itself was almost entirely 

190.15 193.76 B: on this big deck that went over the swamp lake 

193.95 199.45 B: and you know you had your just the ambiance of these big huge old um 

200.03 210.10 B: [lipsmack] old uh what are they called cyprus trees growing out of the swamp and you'd eat chicken wings and drink beer and throw your chicken bones to the alligators 

210.03 211.60 A: [laughter] 

210.21 217.21 B: just a cool sort of place to relax with your friends and drink beer and watch the sunset 

216.85 217.87 A: uh-huh 

217.70 221.74 B: but uh i mi- i i'd like to do something with that kind of ambience 

222.05 222.98 A: uh-huh 

223.95 229.60 A: yeah that sounds kinda cool i've never really seen a place like that in california 

230.25 232.93 B: maybe you could do it i don't know i guess 

233.30 234.93 B: you'd have to have 

235.25 246.64 B: i don't know have to have some natural scenery to make it worthwhile for that most of it would be on the beach and it's just so expensive to have a large b- amount of space out on the beach 

237.24 237.82 A: (( mhm )) 

242.13 244.63 A: (( mhm )) 

248.50 251.69 B: but i'm sure if you found the right place you could still do it mm 

253.96 261.32 A: yeah yeah yeah uh my wife and i like eating and cooking quite a bit too although we don't i've never worked in a restaurant 

262.09 263.42 A: or anything like you 

263.47 266.28 A: but um we've watch the uh food network 

268.78 272.15 A: quite a bit and [lipsmack] and uh i don't know if you get that channel or not 

272.08 273.57 B: yeah 

274.50 277.04 A: so [mn] some of the shows are pretty interesting uh-huh 

278.20 280.05 B: (( [lipsmack] mhm )) 

281.45 282.73 B: (( oh it um )) 

283.06 294.47 B: it would be cool just the idea of having that creative control to be able to come up with new dishes and see how they work and see how people like them 

290.41 293.04 A: mhm 

294.89 295.71 A: uh-huh 

295.70 300.65 B: and and you know make a good bar area where you and your friends could hang out 

300.72 302.34 B: watch the games 

305.25 306.16 B: um 

306.99 316.02 B: i don't know i don't think i'm meant to be an entrepreneur so i probably wouldn't do it i'd be more interested in helping a buddy if they decided they were gonna go that way mm 

315.92 316.87 A: uh-huh 

318.18 320.52 A: uh it sounds like it would be fun 

322.35 327.32 A: and that reminds me um since you mentioned like a good place to hang out 

327.55 333.52 A: another think another thing i think would be cool would be to like to open up a little bookstore 

334.98 336.84 B: like the old kind you mean 

338.75 342.46 A: um um what do you mean like 

342.81 353.47 B: like you know you've got the regular bookstores where they just sell books and then you've got that sort of old style bookstore where you can like sit down and page through stuff and 

342.93 343.86 A: i mean 

353.34 364.50 B: i don't know there's a place called book soup here that's very much that sort of old style of bookstore that's and i think it's really cool it's got just you feel like you're in a 

353.71 357.84 A: mhm 

365.45 373.72 B: library in england from the eighteen hundreds or something when you're in there rather than just some place that's that you can buy books from 

374.48 381.04 A: yeah i would have like a small medium sized place with like couches and stuff 

380.84 389.83 A: so people could sit in and choose stuff [sigh] and then i would try and carry like a pretty wide selection of things [lipsmack] 

389.76 400.19 A: like my wife actually reads romance novels quite a bit [lipsmack] and the funny thing is that up here in this area bookstores 

394.56 395.38 B: mhm 

400.33 409.68 A: um like they really hate to carry them you know it's really hard to find [laughter] bookstores that carry romance novels 'cause they sort of like look down on it 

403.35 404.53 B: [laughter] 

408.45 409.28 B: really 

409.66 411.28 B: yeah the whole uh 

412.75 418.34 B: it's the old [mn] uh snootiness factor i guess you could call it 

416.76 427.00 A: th- [laughter] yeah yeah uh so uh it'd be nice to carry stuff that i like or that she likes and that we we know about and then 

428.43 430.11 A: but i think that's 

430.12 437.08 A: that would be really hard to do because these days with stuff like amazon and stuff it's it's pretty hard to compete 

436.74 449.62 B: yeah you really have to have a niche [mn] if you're going to beat out the big ones like that but if you're doing something you know if you have the couches the atmosphere that people really like hanging out there it's possible 

455.98 466.12 A: uh-huh [sigh] uh-huh [noise] yeah i don't know if if we really had that much cash we might just like do nothing [laughter] just go on vacations all the time 

463.95 464.86 B: uh-huh 

468.91 470.33 B: yeah it's um 

472.22 477.77 B: yeah a uh friend of mine back when i lived in south carolina decided to uh open a bar 

478.52 479.85 B: and uh 

480.13 482.90 B: and it was really cool at first because uh 

484.40 492.43 B: because you know it was a place for all the buddies to hang out and we'd have little parties there after hours and all that kind of stuff but uh 

492.32 499.70 B: unfortunately eventually they uh they had to shut it down because they just didn't make enough money to uh keep it going 

499.67 500.53 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

501.39 506.63 B: which is a shame because he s- spent a lot of money on it it was a fun place to hang out but 

506.68 516.80 B: but uh they s- they were so happy with just having the set of regulars that knew everyone knew each other and all that that they didn't really a- actively pursue 

517.14 518.58 B: bringing in uh 

518.73 522.51 B: the kind of crowd they needed to keep the rent paid 

522.17 523.14 A: (( oh )) 

523.23 524.65 A: that's a bummer 

524.30 526.08 B: mhm 

530.86 539.01 B: but i don't know i guess it just depends like you know if i was going to be self-employed it would probably be as a writer 

539.74 543.71 B: which but that's not really opening your own business 

543.89 548.86 B: it doesn't require a store or anything like that it's just writing and selling your stuff 

549.49 553.93 B: so but that's what i'm working on and uh ha- 

554.41 561.54 B: you know have my real job but ideally i'd like if i succeeded in my writing i'd be able to quit the real job 

561.52 563.05 A: [noise] mhm oh that's cool 

563.44 568.13 A: r- are you trying to write books or scripts or 

567.60 570.12 B: um scripts right now 

570.21 573.15 B: eventually i'd like to write a book a novel 

571.66 574.28 A: (( mhm uh-huh )) 

574.02 576.46 B: but 

576.58 578.89 B: it just takes so long 

580.37 584.54 A: yeah well sounds like you're in the right place for 

581.22 582.07 B: (( but you )) 

584.47 585.78 B: (( know yeah )) 

584.80 586.12 A: (( it down in l._a. )) 

586.89 596.29 B: well i have some good connections for writing so if i actually knock out a script that's worth something i can at least get some people to read it 

596.06 598.52 A: uh-huh oh that's good 

598.90 599.89 B: but
