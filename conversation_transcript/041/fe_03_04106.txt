20.68 21.62 A: yeah 

21.66 22.97 B: not too far 

23.36 31.36 A: well let's see if i were to open my own business i'd probably open one of those very large toy stores that toys r. us runs 

31.86 35.59 A: uh i have a lot of background in that 

35.30 37.35 B: mhm 

36.06 37.41 A: and uh 

37.45 50.18 A: i did that and well i've been in the toy retailing business for many many years before i finally left it uh how would i go about opening it 

50.57 54.56 A: if money was no object that would be a rather simple 

54.75 58.16 A: situation i'd build my own store 

58.95 59.98 A: uh 

60.84 64.93 A: and i would then uh 

65.04 66.11 A: having 

66.42 70.70 A: a fairly decent reputation in the toy business i would um 

71.17 72.25 A: order 

72.45 76.45 A: the merchandise to fill it and uh 

75.47 79.28 B: did you used to work in the toy in a toy store or where's your background from oh 

79.05 89.30 A: well my background was actually in the uh in both ends i worked in the store but i also spent most of my time as a buyer and a merchandise manager 

88.75 89.83 B: okay 

90.39 91.89 A: how about yourself 

91.26 95.18 B: well you definitely know how the process would work then [laughter] 

93.44 94.76 A: oh yes [laughter] 

95.04 96.37 A: that's for sure 

97.37 100.67 A: it's been a little while but uh uh 

97.53 100.19 B: yeah mhm 

100.90 103.79 A: yeah i i i would i would have no problem um uh 

105.22 106.82 A: starting from scratch 

107.22 109.14 A: what i- what would you do uh-huh 

108.55 117.81 B: well you know it kinda depends [laughter] i- if i go with something that i've always wanted to do ever since i was a little kid i always wanted to 

117.84 131.08 B: start a a i always wanted to own a sporting goods store 'cause when i was little of course i just thought well this would be great i could just go in and pick any hat or shirt i wanted [laughter] just take it off the rack and wear 

130.26 132.93 A: yeah i know that kids are that way okay 

131.11 131.92 B: (( it )) 

132.24 137.85 B: yeah but you know as i got older i you know i still would be it still would be fun to own a 

138.01 144.25 B: a sporting goods store mostly you know the reason why i think that i would be good at that is 'cause 

144.39 148.29 B: yeah you don't have to have a sports background but you have to 

148.59 153.13 B: you know at least know what's out there and um i was in 

153.53 164.69 B: broadcasting for a while working in sports which uh i think kinda helps me kinda understand what merchandise to carry 'cause you know what what people are buying and who's popular or whatever 

164.70 178.88 B: um the industry that i'm in now is marketing research and so that i really think would help me be successful is because i understand i've worked with so many different uh products and clients that are opening new stores and new 

179.00 187.86 B: businesses and new products and things that i would understand how the process works and so i'd be able to use that background 

187.87 196.35 B: uh in research and in marketing to make sure that i had a successful product that had something or had a store that was unique 

196.36 201.96 B: would be able to find things that people were looking for in a sporting goods store that would set me apart from 

202.05 203.22 B: regular 

203.51 207.53 B: run of the mill uh sporting goods stores and then 

204.54 205.43 A: yeah 

206.16 207.29 A: (( i know what you mean )) 

207.59 220.73 B: i worked in a business with my dad and so i think that that uh you know i've been there where i've uh seen what it's like to run your own business and how you have to wear all the different hats and working with uh 

220.51 229.93 B: clients and being a client of of others and so that would just that entire dynamic is is an interesting one so 

229.16 231.41 A: well we could almost go partners 

230.96 235.49 B: oh i know have your toy store and my sporting goods store next to each other 

231.87 232.99 A: there's the 

234.31 237.82 A: right uh the toys r. us type of 

237.91 239.02 A: uh 

239.18 245.67 A: theme is toys and related leisure products in which sporting goods plays a major part so 

243.91 246.89 B: is a big part of that 

246.83 253.65 A: of course it wouldn't be a hundred percent sporting goods so that that might not be what where you'd wanna be 

250.18 251.18 B: mhm 

253.18 254.32 B: mhm 

253.75 257.09 A: uh we have an outfit down here called uh 

257.46 260.56 A: oh what the heck they called the uh 

261.17 264.67 A: sports authority uh perhaps you've heard of them 

262.69 263.82 B: right 

264.09 267.15 B: oh yes been there [laughter] 

265.10 270.63 A: uh that yeah it sounds like that might be a little bit more of what uh 

270.68 272.68 A: or a little bit closer to what you 

272.69 273.99 A: would wanna be doing 

272.75 286.44 B: yeah they've got more of a of an entire experience there you know i think a lot of them have batting cages and some of 'em have some batting cages and you know like a little mini basketball court in there to try things out yeah it would be 

276.14 276.97 A: yeah 

283.28 285.01 A: right exactly 

286.42 298.86 B: similar to that you know and the thing is i you know i kinda have a vision of what i think it would be but at the same time i would rely on you know whatever research that i did to what people would expect or want 

298.65 299.63 A: right 

299.13 301.43 B: in a sporting goods store to kinda dictate 

301.47 303.85 B: that yeah i mean the other option 

304.26 311.43 B: if money was no o- and see that one i think i could make successful but if money truly was no object [laughter] then i think i would open 

311.38 323.86 B: uh some kind of a volleyball training facility uh because i co- i played uh volleyball in high school and in college and i coach junior olympic volleyball now on the side and so that's definitely something 

320.50 321.19 A: (( [laughter] )) 

323.94 329.66 B: where i've got extra cheese and could you know start up my training program working with 

328.80 333.45 A: golly [mn] you sure your name is not conch correlli [laughter] he 

331.22 337.41 B: yeah [laughter] i'd try to get him in that's for sure [laughter] but it's uh 

336.78 340.45 A: seems to be like the lone ranger of uh volleyball 

339.96 341.36 B: he is you mean 

341.12 343.49 A: yeah i mean he seems to be anyway uh 

342.69 352.61 B: yeah well he's definitely the most recognizable person in the sport because he not only had olympic success but beach success and 

351.98 352.75 A: yeah 

352.66 360.76 B: it's th- you know the problem is is the sport hasn't been marketed very well by the governing body and so it just uh still is viewed as 

360.99 364.95 B: somewhat of a picnic backyard sport and not 

363.83 366.78 A: yeah well every once in a while they do do some t._v. 

366.87 370.42 A: uh over the expand of a few days so that they 

370.53 375.78 A: uh can more or less have a winner of usually it's beach 

375.58 376.87 B: right 

375.82 377.53 A: [mn] and uh 

377.67 381.71 A: (( then they do promote college )) 

381.87 386.17 A: uh but nowhere near to where other sports get it 

383.96 384.89 B: no 

385.32 386.33 B: no 

386.53 395.90 B: yeah 'cause it's still viewed by many as as not a- as not a the the goods you know the sport that actually takes finesse and skill 

395.88 399.03 B: and coordination to play [laughter] they still 

398.86 399.93 A: that's true 

398.94 402.18 B: imagine playing in the back yard with mom and pop but 

401.95 409.85 B: you know it'd be interesting because the you know everybody wants to take these college you know these high school kids that are already fairly skilled and 

409.84 418.26 B: and work with them and that's who i work with now are elite level high school players that are gonna play in college somewhere but what i think would be interesting if i were to open up a 

418.19 423.51 B: a volleyball training facility is i would you know go to the younger kids and go to 

423.45 434.26 B: you know nine and ten year olds and uh i mean i would accommodate you know kids as they got older we'd obviously have high school age kids and have a who- have a complete program but the emphasis would be on 

434.25 445.03 B: getting into the younger age groups and and training them yeah and not just you know everybody has a one week camp here and there or has a week long thing but 

436.89 438.42 A: sorta like training camp 

444.89 456.25 B: nobody really has a program for younger kids to start to learn how to play until they hit junior high and start playing in school and the problem with that is is that there aren't 

456.24 467.00 B: skilled or qualified coaches at that level it's usually a math teacher that who coaches basketball and also has to coach the volleyball team and doesn't really know how to train and so 

467.08 480.72 B: the problem we run into is that i get a lotta kids as good as they are have developed some really bad habits and when they're juniors or seniors in high school it's almost late to too late to break 'em down and and re-teach 'em 

478.04 479.21 A: (( yeah true [laughter] yeah true )) 

480.19 483.04 A: my son is uh 

483.66 488.65 A: a uh an english teacher who coaches basketball and he's been 

488.79 490.99 A: very very successful at it 

490.41 491.94 B: mhm 

491.19 492.25 A: uh 

492.51 494.53 A: i forgot the name of his school 

494.63 497.41 A: that he teaches at currently it's uh 

498.10 499.50 A: bishop lynch 

499.30 500.64 B: mhm 

499.60 503.44 A: uh perhaps um i don't know if it's anywhere near 

503.58 505.41 A: uh your neighborhood but 

504.57 508.85 B: oh that's the one that's here in dallas oh i've heard of it mhm 

507.14 508.10 A: yeah 

508.18 511.57 A: and uh he coaches there 

511.64 515.12 A: and uh when he coached down here in florida 

515.24 521.72 A: uh his team went to the final four of the state championships 

521.99 523.07 A: uh 

523.84 526.12 A: so i mean he's he's done okay 

525.75 526.81 B: mhm 

526.36 530.70 A: on it he has no desire to coach volleyball i don't think 

530.17 534.95 B: right and see he probably has played basketball before or whatever and see volleyball is 

534.32 535.77 A: schoolyard type yeah 

535.14 545.15 B: yeah volleyball well see you know that's the difference with you know pe- we grow up all you know in america playing or being very familiar with basketball and football 

545.06 554.96 B: whereas volleyball's a specialty sport and not a lot of people truly know how to play it or coach it and so you get you know there's coaches at that level 

554.91 565.10 B: at the younger level who usually do not have a whole lot of experience or or knowledge in it and there is is a void right now in volleyball 

565.05 574.86 B: for coaches at that age group and i know that f- uh about five or six years ago there was a plea almost that went out from the u._s._a. volleyball the governing body that said 

574.75 589.16 B: you know we've got plenty of qualified coaches at college level and we have plenty of of good qualified high school coaches we need to get qualified coaches down in the junior high level to start teaching kids at an early age and and um 

589.32 599.89 B: i think [lipsmack] the biggest that's where this topic is [laughter] you know maybe a little unrealistic where it says money was no object but that's what holds people back from doing this sort of things is money
