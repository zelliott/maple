27.42 34.09 B: [noise] yeah [mn] i was listening to the description of that and thinking you know i would totally suck at that [noise] 

32.92 43.89 A: [laughter] i think they just wanna hear us talk so that should be good we can talk about that 'cause i i did kind of have my own business once i taught childbirth classes for um thirteen years 

43.39 44.72 B: [noise] wow 

43.90 49.74 A: and uh that was kinda my own little self employed business they came to my house and but

54.05 55.05 B: yeah 

57.33 64.21 B: [noise] yes i do [noise] um and it's so the hassle with it is i think if uh 

64.32 66.06 B: i if money wasn't an issue 

65.65 66.51 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

66.11 67.93 B: i wouldn't be working [laughter] 

67.28 71.87 A: yeah me neither my husband's just retired and i i could do that too 

68.86 69.80 B: i'm i'm 

72.01 73.47 A: if i [laughter] 

72.13 85.16 B: oh see [laughter] i'm i'm not close enough to retirement for for that to be a a reality but i could just see that if someone said here you here's enough money you can start your own business or you can retire like okay i'm retiring 

77.98 79.15 A: mhm 

83.32 84.14 A: yeah 

84.51 89.55 A: yeah that's what i thought if money's not an issue did how did you get in the study how did you 

88.87 93.19 B: [laughter] um i a friend of mine on the net told me about it oh 

92.35 98.35 A: yeah that's where i that's where i found it [laughter] is this your first call or have you had one before 

97.76 99.13 B: (( no this is my second )) 

98.75 99.90 A: (( oh okay )) 

100.43 102.15 A: and what did you talk about the last time 

102.32 105.89 B: oh uh what makes comedy inappropriate 

105.99 112.85 A: oh i guess if it i guess i could talk about anything but [laughter] 

109.55 113.08 B: yeah it it it was kind of weird we're like i don't know 

112.99 114.36 A: yeah hm 

114.07 120.03 B: but yeah the starting your own business thing i think it really requires a degree of devotion and ambition 

119.67 120.54 A: right 

120.46 121.93 B: that [mn] 

122.15 134.77 B: i don't have and not very many people i know have but the people i know that actually have their own businesses i see they work [mn] you know every hour of the day that they're not sleeping and they don't sleep that much and i i i don't 

126.72 127.57 A: (( [sigh] mhm )) 

130.14 131.15 A: right 

132.48 139.45 A: mhm my well my kids both kinda have their own business they're both self employed [sigh] and uh 

134.93 135.69 B: (( know [mn] [mn] )) 

139.55 141.89 A: my daughter loves it you know she's 

141.99 146.37 A: she's thrilled with it she's [laughter] but she hasn't been in it very long so 

145.88 147.53 B: right 

146.42 148.79 A: i don't know how that'll be but uh 

148.86 149.54 A: hm 

149.51 156.39 B: yeah yeah i think it's kinda tough though i mean if you work for yourself and you take the day off you're not making any money 

155.11 167.33 A: you don't get paid and that's exactly the well both my kids are uh like one's a podiatrist and one's an optometrist so they both have their own practice and if they don't work they don't make any money you know so it's a little different yeah 

164.78 168.77 B: mm right see i think it's gotta be gotta be tougher to take vacation in that case 

168.08 175.83 A: right yeah and they i don't i don't know if they ever thought about that because we're uh employed in school districts where we have a lot of vacation 

175.81 176.53 B: uh-huh 

175.83 186.76 A: and so they were raised with a lot of vacation [laughter] and now they're not you know able to have that so it's a little little more different for them you know but hey make your choices 

180.82 182.39 B: (( [noise] well )) 

184.36 187.01 B: yeah i would i would find that displeasing 

186.80 187.51 A: (( mm )) 

187.10 195.03 B: yes that that's true i mean i i could i guess i could see myself doing something you know toodle with something part time as more of a hobby 

188.38 189.24 A: yeah 

194.70 203.04 A: right that's when they said that i thought well what do i i like to travel but i don't if you if it's your business then it's not really a vacation 

203.06 206.68 A: you know if you're helping people plan their travel plans or 

203.20 204.87 B: yeah how fun is that [mn] 

207.12 209.64 A: [lipsmack] no it's not the same do what do you 

208.81 210.51 B: yeah i think it hm 

209.70 211.95 A: what do you work in now what kind of field hm 

211.80 213.66 B: uh telecommunications 

214.41 224.68 B: yeah they're they filed chapter eleven about a year and a half ago so we're we're still hoping that we're going to be employed [laughter] in the long term so obviously thinking about self employment is 

217.10 217.92 A: uh-huh 

220.31 222.59 A: right that's that 

224.78 227.11 B: i guess a realistic thing 

225.45 229.17 A: i guess you'd have that advantage you would never have to worry about 

228.90 240.46 B: yeah but you still have the ups and downs of the economy i mean i i i have friends that are like massage therapists and other and they work in ser- you know chiropractors and service industry stuff and when people don't 

231.41 232.53 A: oh yeah 

234.56 235.77 A: mhm 

237.88 238.71 A: right 

240.64 244.30 B: when people aren't working they don't have extra money they don't spend it 

240.66 242.29 A: have extra money they 

243.69 244.59 A: (( right [sigh] )) 

244.79 246.27 B: (( and you know )) 

246.30 251.33 B: i would consider massages and going to the chiropractor generally luxuries 

250.76 251.68 A: right 

251.50 254.88 B: especially if you don't have health insurance that covers it and 

253.35 261.93 A: well and that's the other thing if you're self employed you don't have health insurance unless you cover yourself i mean you'd have to but that's a big expense 

260.23 264.42 B: and that's such a big expense as well yes that's definitely 

262.02 262.73 A: (( hm )) 

263.99 269.06 A: so i i don't see that as that's a disadvantage [laughter] 

267.97 268.96 B: yeah 

269.07 273.50 B: i think i would i i would definitely working for the man you know but [laughter] 

272.80 274.12 A: working for the what 

274.06 282.24 B: working for the man that's where they make you you know come in you're a slave to the paycheck and whatnot but that's why i think re- being retired would be lovely i 

275.15 276.89 A: yes yes 

281.47 284.91 A: yeah my husband loves it he's been 

283.96 292.06 B: some of my coworkers have actually returned to work after being retired because they were bored i thought that was a bit odd 

285.00 285.83 A: [laughter] 

290.13 304.22 A: i you know what he's been off oh like since september and he's never been bored and he's kind of hyperactive so i would have thought he might be [laughter] but uh i don't know i i don't think i would be 'cause i can find lots of hobbies [laughter] 

294.96 295.52 B: (( [mn] )) 

301.53 303.00 B: [noise] i think it's a matter of 

303.21 308.48 B: yeah it's a matter of creativity i mean i think people that tend to be bored are going to be bored no matter what but 

307.69 318.39 A: right they're probably bored at work too but [laughter] i don't know i know yes i know of people that don't retire because of that i think they're not sure what else they would do wi- 

311.66 313.36 B: but at least they're getting paid [laughter] 

317.64 319.08 B: and they need to have a purpose 

318.89 319.83 A: mhm 

319.68 320.85 B: (( i don't have that problem )) 

320.64 324.13 A: no me [laughter] me neither do you have children now 

323.98 326.22 B: [laughter] no i don't i have a dog 

324.80 328.05 A: okay okay so he'd have more time with you 

328.98 332.13 A: [laughter] if you were retired [laughter] 

330.63 335.57 B: (( yeah i wish i could bring my dog to work this is california no uh they don't let me )) 

332.31 333.59 A: (( yeah do ya )) 

334.23 335.05 A: (( no no )) 

335.63 338.03 B: some places out here do that'd be nice

350.10 351.05 A: mhm 

351.48 353.62 A: [laughter] 

352.02 354.30 B: (( [laughter] then i moved back ))

379.64 381.72 A: no right you can travel mhm 

380.32 391.26 B: that's that's what i learned you know in on the east coast you can drive for two hours and be in a different state in most of 'em where out here you can drive eight hours and still be in california 

390.02 393.46 A: california yeah my niece lives in bakersfield 

393.44 395.22 B: oh okay my sister lives there 

393.51 394.61 A: and uh

413.97 420.03 B: [sigh] oh yes don't drive in the winter i i wrecked my car in wyoming on interstate eighty last year [laughter] 

419.98 420.95 A: eighty 

420.15 422.38 B: don't recommend it yeah 

420.96 434.57 A: i know eighty goes right through pennsylvania we've been on that with snow too [laughter] and uh it's uh it's a snowy area so yeah yeah yeah we usually travel in the motorhome but uh 

424.14 425.34 B: mhm 

434.79 437.92 A: in the winter we don't take it out so [lipsmack] anyway yeah [lipsmack] okay 

438.43 440.50 B: yeah that's probably wise 

440.80 449.22 B: but uh yeah back back to the business thing i was i was just thinking if if i was gonna do something like that it'd probably be more more of a part time artistic thing 

445.59 446.74 A: yeah pick one 

448.98 449.88 A: (( uh-huh [mn] )) 

449.23 453.07 B: you know where i would do some sort of arts and crafts and 

453.28 455.28 B: you know maybe sell it on the weekends 

454.82 464.45 A: right i that always sounds kind of interesting you know i do quilts and and that all but i always said as as long as it takes me to make a quilt i couldn't 

458.14 458.82 B: (( yeah oh )) 

463.09 465.42 B: i know what you'd have to sell them for 

464.47 474.85 A: you'd have yeah a fortune [laughter] my husband always said you know it'd be worth thousands [laughter] so it would have to be some quick little things you could make that you know that you could actually make a profit on 

475.06 476.09 B: right 

475.65 476.66 A: (( i don't know )) 

476.86 480.45 A: i don't really go to those too much those shows but uh mhm 

480.58 486.78 B: yeah i've been to a few of them you know it if it was just something you dabbled in i think it wouldn't get too annoying [laughter] 

486.54 489.64 A: no it and like they said money isn't an object 

489.86 492.53 A: so you wouldn't really have to make a lot of money 

489.90 491.31 B: right 

492.41 499.63 B: that's true if money wasn't an object i could get myself a nice art studio on the on the cliffs overlooking the beach somewhere for inspiration 

498.41 499.21 A: right 

499.30 500.53 A: and you paint 

500.85 501.86 B: (( no but i )) 

501.42 505.19 A: [laughter] [laughter] suppose you could sit there and look at the 

501.93 507.24 B: [laughter] [laughter] if i could get a cliff house on the beach i might try [laughter] 

505.95 512.40 A: [laughter] that's right take some lessons [laughter] 

511.80 514.76 B: exactly no most i do mostly needle work 

512.86 513.60 A: i 

514.37 516.28 A: mhm like um 

515.70 520.59 B: and crocheting and and no i did some needlepoint pillows and whatnot 

516.64 518.93 A: crocheting and well that 

520.11 521.07 A: right 

520.83 525.53 B: i had a job working grave shift uh a few years back where 

524.42 525.49 A: working what 

525.58 529.11 B: grave shift it's working the it's like the midnight to seven a. m. shift 

527.03 529.39 A: oh right right yes 

529.22 535.06 B: and i basically i was sitting around waiting for a computer to beep and if the computer beeped i had some tasks to do 

532.39 533.49 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

534.65 535.61 A: uh-huh 

535.14 543.10 B: um so pr- pretty much anything i did to stay awake my company was happy so i i crocheted like six afghans that year 

535.74 536.60 A: oh 

539.05 539.92 A: yes 

542.60 543.68 A: i'll bet 

543.69 550.04 B: and what what's interesting is i can- calculated my hourly rate so i figured out how much my company paid me to crochet afghans 

549.32 551.42 A: (( [laughter] [noise] uh-huh )) 

550.34 554.61 B: so they're they're paying you it's probably about fifteen thousand dollars per afghan 

554.10 557.40 A: [laughter] [laughter] that's 

555.75 559.13 B: [laughter] so i couldn't sell those [laughter] 

557.59 560.71 A: no no that's right [laughter] 

560.04 564.73 B: (( but at least at least uh they were paying me to do it as opposed to you know just sitting around )) 

563.99 572.39 A: yeah well that's interesting i've worked that shift as a nurse but never uh never you weren't allowed to do anything like that you didn't have time and you didn't 

571.48 574.34 B: well nurses they keep you busy my sister's a nurse 

572.74 576.78 A: yeah yeah it i didn't like that shift at all it was so mm 

574.64 575.70 B: and 

576.99 583.51 B: um it was for for me i'm an engineer and it was very quiet there was there were a lot of politics going on during the day 

580.49 581.54 A: mhm 

583.64 585.27 A: so you had time to 

583.73 584.81 B: and yeah 

586.05 587.39 A: do your own thing 

587.37 599.52 B: yeah they didn't really mess with you you had you could learn whatever you wanted and then you could entertain yourself however you wanted to as long as you stayed awake and did your job then they didn't mess with you much 'cause management certainly didn't wanna go to grave shift 

590.17 591.10 A: mhm 

593.74 594.72 A: mhm 

598.98 599.89 A: (( no [laughter] ))
