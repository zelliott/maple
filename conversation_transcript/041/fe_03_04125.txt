48.59 50.07 B: i have a um

56.13 61.90 B: you know large companies and say you know let me come in every tuesday and you know give everybody a massage 

61.91 64.57 B: but it really didn't work out very well 

64.75 66.64 A: (( but working hard is fun ))

77.62 81.44 A: (( mean i work in finance )) 

80.47 85.98 B: [mn] e- exactly and then i i think uh being a young man you've got something else in mind 

86.66 88.21 B: (( oh so )) 

88.57 94.27 B: i don't know i i had an insurance business and i really liked 

95.41 103.09 B: dealing with the people and filling out policies and collecting money and talking to them when they came in the office but 

103.34 107.25 B: the terrible thing was the government regulations and 

109.40 114.56 B: uh um property and casualty and oh my favorite was drunk drivers 

114.47 115.67 A: (( so )) 

115.32 117.55 B: i loved drunk drivers 

118.01 119.03 A: (( in )) 

120.06 123.73 A: (( theory they pay you based on your performance yeah uh )) 

124.96 137.08 B: well that wasn't the you know most likely but that was the insurance company's problem but the thing in is see if you had a a man come in that's forty five years old has a good job 

137.15 141.72 B: owns a home and has two children but he had one speeding ticket a year ago 

141.80 147.50 B: you've got to tell him you have to hit him with high rates and of course he's he's all upset 

147.95 150.34 B: whereas a drunk person comes in 

150.40 153.14 B: they know they've been in trouble 

153.37 161.42 B: and so they're just grateful if you treat them with courtesy and you know do what you have to do with the insurance and they just don't 

161.74 164.39 B: give you as much trouble in the sense of 

164.54 166.82 B: you know in the office or anything

171.89 175.22 A: (( i don't i don't think i would want to but you )) 

174.79 180.47 B: that's the thing that's the thing you know between the people that won't take 'em and the people that treat 'em like dirt 

180.88 185.77 B: you know it was a lot easier than dealing with the forty five year old businessman that 

185.89 189.52 B: has been nice and good but thinks he's god you know 

190.88 191.57 A: (( know ))
