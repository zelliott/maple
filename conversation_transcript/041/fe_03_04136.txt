61.16 72.18 A: [lipsmack] still work full time but just sorta just uh you know get an internet site together and a business plan and marketing and i got my business cards but um 

66.15 67.28 B: right 

71.91 73.46 B: that sounds interesting 

73.99 78.44 A: but music is my passion so i figure uh it has to be something that involves music for me 

77.75 79.59 B: great yeah 

79.07 82.10 A: so y- you said uh crafts som- 

81.21 90.65 B: maybe crafts yeah i i'm not a real crafty person but i may- maybe i would be involved maybe more in uh selling and marketing it [noise] 

82.94 83.72 A: no 

89.91 95.37 A: oh i see um [lipsmack] i have a friend here in atlanta who opened up a business that you uh 

95.23 105.40 A: you come in and i guess pay by the hour to create um plates and cups and things like that and they fire them for you but they they provide all of the materials and then 

102.47 103.54 B: (( mhm )) 

105.31 114.04 A: i think it's a really um even people who don't want to mold their own they have ready set ones and then it's just up to you to paint it any way you want to 

112.57 113.88 B: i see oh 

113.90 115.39 B: that's interesting 

114.65 117.71 A: and i think they're really pretty popular in atlanta where i'm from 

117.10 118.28 B: oh really 

117.91 119.12 A: mhm 

118.53 122.14 B: no i haven't heard of anything like that over here in um new york 

122.08 129.95 A: it's it's just uh people who work all day on one side of their brain you know their logic or it's it's something totally different than that you know [lipsmack] 

125.93 127.17 B: right 

128.51 129.81 B: this is true 

131.48 132.93 A: but um [lipsmack] 

133.43 140.90 A: and i have a wife she does art shows um she paints but cheap paintings and then she 

140.91 144.15 A: goes around the southeast to different uh 

144.56 152.96 A: uh how do you describe it for like regional fairs and things like that not fairs but um craft shows outdoor craft shows and things like that 

148.46 149.54 B: (( mhm )) 

151.83 160.43 B: i see yeah well those are pretty popular here in new york we've got a few big ones that come over um uh several times a year that are really big 

160.06 162.70 A: oh yeah so you must be in the city 

162.14 165.59 B: oh uh near new york city mhm 

164.24 165.26 A: yeah 

165.58 166.74 A: um 

166.80 170.38 A: [lipsmack] any other businesses you think you might be interested in uh [mn] 

169.84 174.73 B: [noise] mm not really this topic kind of got me off guard i really didn't think about any 

173.41 179.67 A: yeah same here it's not something i would normally think about per se but um 

175.94 178.01 B: right right 

178.33 182.55 B: 'cause i'm not real talented i don't have [laughter] m- many talents so 

182.26 183.48 A: oh i think 

182.69 184.62 B: 'cause i i just retired 

184.67 189.50 B: um from a an office job and but i think 

186.73 194.55 A: yeah oh i bet you probably have a lot of talents that you maybe you're not seeing them as something that would help you open a business but 

193.27 204.08 B: maybe maybe but you know everything is so computerized now um that that that is really the um the way to go is you have to be uh computer literate 

196.61 197.73 A: mhm 

201.76 202.70 A: right 

204.15 210.57 A: yes i think so but it all comes down i think to people interactions with people you know 

210.13 214.95 B: exactly this is true those those talents will never go out of style [laughter] 

211.11 212.92 A: um 

214.00 227.43 A: no i mean 'cause i see all too often that people who are uh really smart on computers people just think that they're just smart overall but they're no smarter than the rest of us they just happen to know computer stuff you 

226.38 237.80 B: i guess yeah um i guess um [sigh] uh it's a lot easier for the for the younger kids the kids that are just starting out um t- to be working with the computer 'cause i i find it quite difficult if i 

227.80 228.55 A: (( know )) 

233.24 234.48 A: mhm 

237.88 244.04 B: uh i guess if i was using it more and more it would be okay but um i i find it quite difficult 

241.82 242.88 A: yeah 

243.88 249.38 A: well i had to go back to school uh mid life um aged forty and uh 

247.19 248.19 B: mhm 

249.40 252.61 A: get a new degree and um 

253.19 256.05 A: [mn] c- 'cause i felt like technology was passing me by 

255.43 257.15 B: right right 

256.77 268.49 A: so uh i i felt like i needed to train you know especially with the internet and uh at that time the millennium was coming up and i just figured oh my god i gotta do something or i'm just gonna be 

264.02 264.94 B: yeah 

268.47 272.95 A: you know like a um a buggy [mn] manufacturer you know [laughter] 

270.11 272.56 B: i know what you mean [laughter] 

273.69 282.90 A: i'm trying to think what other businesses that might be interested in for me i think maybe like a c._d. store you know a music store or something like that or i could 

277.17 278.26 B: (( mm [noise] )) 

280.64 291.99 B: oh yeah that would be nice see my both my husband and my son are both into music a lot so that w- that would be interesting for them too maybe i'd be helping them if if i decided to go into something like that 

291.30 305.37 A: yeah well i've got there are lots of friends i've got who actually helped their mate do the business you know that they're more of a back office kind of person they have all the skills needed to make things happen behind the scenes but the other person is the uh 

295.71 297.66 B: (( mhm mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

305.52 310.57 A: um you know the person that deals with the public or whatever the sales part of it or something but 

308.37 309.22 B: yeah 

309.78 313.31 B: one's gotta be the brains and one's gotta be the brawn [laughter] 

312.34 314.45 A: [laughter] 

314.38 327.68 B: uh my my husband uh would would like to i i know um be like a um i don't wanna say a cruise director uh what do i wanna say he's got a boat he he'd like to ch- a charter that's what i'd like he'd like to do charter boats 

315.27 315.99 A: (( well [laughter] )) 

323.83 324.77 A: mhm 

327.70 332.21 B: but i'm i'm not to keen on water myself so i can't help him with that [sigh] 

331.28 338.88 A: [laughter] well i've been on boats before and the captain can be kinda like captain bligh you know 

337.94 339.27 B: right 

338.96 342.20 A: they tend to like somehow assume that role 

341.59 343.53 B: yes [laughter] 

342.46 346.53 A: like well it's a life and death you have to uh listen to me kind of thing but 

345.96 353.84 B: oh for sure so m- so much can go wrong on on a boat when you're up on the high seas so to speak that um you never know 

349.24 350.56 A: mhm 

352.01 352.99 A: oh yeah 

353.70 356.67 A: but that's a that would be a neat kind of business where you sorta 

355.57 357.67 B: mhm mhm 

356.84 360.48 A: you you have like a retirement and a business at the same time you know 

358.97 360.87 B: yeah that's right 

360.88 366.52 A: uh take people around a certain place or even it could be in your area your know a summertime kind of business 

362.96 363.98 B: i guess 

365.34 366.49 B: yes 

366.62 374.08 B: um i guess though the the success of a of a business is to have fun while you're doing it too it can't be all work you gotta have some kind of fun too 

373.47 379.05 A: i agree totally agree um and if there's anything i've learned in all the years i've been working that you 

375.26 376.66 B: mhm 

379.22 384.79 A: you have a passion for what it is you do or the people you're gonna be 

385.15 391.45 A: dealing with or whatever it is that you're selling or marketing that it's gotta be something 

385.91 387.04 B: that's right 

391.90 394.76 A: [mn] it can't just be brooms or something 

392.12 393.10 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

393.23 397.31 B: don't you agree that even though you're making a lotta money if you're not happy with it 

397.46 400.47 B: you're not that money really doesn't mean anything 

400.27 402.78 A: (( mhm i'm with you that one uh money )) 

401.98 403.49 B: yeah 

402.98 406.01 A: i wish it was a bigger motivator in my life but u h but 

405.07 407.08 B: yeah me too [sigh] 

407.31 410.71 A: i feel like i'm much happier than a lotta people i know who have more 

410.40 413.06 B: that's true money isn't everything right 

412.04 413.92 A: mhm i don't think so 

413.74 421.33 B: so maybe we will find that um [lipsmack] good uh business to open up and w- we'll be real happy [laughter] 

420.74 421.55 A: [laughter] 

421.90 427.80 A: well we can always be uh you know people who work outta their home you know there's kinda uh 

426.77 430.35 B: yeah i think that's pretty much a a way of the future 

428.34 431.23 A: jobs you can do or uh you know like 

430.82 441.49 B: to be working outta your home is but i i i'm assuming too that it's a lot harder than it seems because you have to be very very um motivated and um 

439.48 440.99 A: mhm 

442.32 446.36 B: [lipsmack] uh oh i can't think of the word i have senior moments [laughter] 

445.81 452.60 A: now if uh i don't know if you're a big reader but you know maybe like a script reader for hollywood or something like that you know 

450.29 451.71 B: that's true 

451.83 454.45 B: yeah yeah that would be a good one 

452.97 453.90 A: (( well you know )) 

454.06 460.64 A: something that involves [laughter] old time skills you know reading comprehension and knowing what 

455.70 456.87 B: i'm wondering at 

457.25 458.69 B: yeah 

460.71 465.33 A: um is a good story or something like that 

462.61 464.03 B: mhm 

464.53 468.15 B: i wonder how you would get in in uh started with something like that 

468.80 477.69 A: mm oh i would first maybe go to the library and see if they have something that could sorta connect you to those kinda people 

472.52 473.25 B: oh 

477.29 479.25 B: true yeah 

477.72 478.73 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

479.45 483.97 A: because you're not too too far from new york and there's definitely a lot of stuff going on there 

482.86 484.85 B: yeah uh that's true 

484.20 491.42 A: especially n- with the publishing kinda based around there too so it's sort of a conduit for the written word i think 

487.09 488.05 B: mhm 

488.14 488.70 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

491.00 495.34 B: that's it i'm sure there's a lot of information on the internet too that you could 

491.79 492.65 A: but 

495.71 497.71 B: you could find out there 

495.80 501.10 A: um mhm [lipsmack] but [mn] you said you weren't too too uh keen on 

501.35 508.28 A: things technological so i was trying to think of some other way that you could um [lipsmack] someone could help you get the answer you know 

505.14 506.70 B: yeah 

507.43 511.89 B: well the library would be a good good place to start 

511.30 516.17 A: mhm 'cause they might have some resources there that can steer you or uh 

516.18 523.58 A: maybe a name of an association maybe there's like a group of script readers out there you know or something like that 

521.48 525.50 B: yeah i might have to might have to look into that 

524.78 528.72 A: [lipsmack] just an idea [laughter] just an idea um mm 

525.63 526.58 B: mhm 

529.05 531.40 A: (( money was no object let me see )) 

532.50 534.04 B: i'm thinking what else um 

536.91 540.44 B: we've p- kinda covered covered all the bases with this 

539.74 548.55 A: we had um some things in the past where uh i mean like i've always sort of dreamed i guess of maybe being a travel writer or something like that or um uh 

547.39 548.71 B: oh yeah 

549.12 562.68 A: you know you travel the world and share your experiences and um people live vicariously through what you're doing or you're helping someone take the step that they need to take to go to that place they've always wondered about or 

556.05 556.99 B: true 

561.92 562.90 B: uh-huh 

562.91 564.14 A: (( um that )) 

564.58 566.34 B: yes i'd like to travel 

565.11 567.83 A: kinda thing has some somewhat of an appeal for me 

567.24 568.16 B: uh-huh 

568.46 569.52 B: me too 

568.51 572.21 A: although i don't speak a number of languages but 

572.55 576.63 A: i don't know if you ever saw the accidental tourist with uh william hurt remember that movie 

575.51 577.16 B: yes yes i did 

576.76 580.55 A: he was a travel writer who hated to travel yes [laughter] so 

578.38 581.25 B: right uh-huh that was a good one 

580.81 585.73 A: [laughter] he he would tell americans how to travel and um 

585.09 586.62 B: yep [sigh] 

586.42 587.36 A: (( [mn] then )) 

586.89 588.83 B: yeah i i'm trying to think o- 

587.98 589.82 A: not go native mhm 

589.19 592.33 B: that was quite a while ago that i saw that movie but 

593.19 595.20 A: with geena davis that was like her big 

594.58 596.94 B: right geena davis was in that uh-huh 

595.26 596.41 A: break 

596.44 597.56 A: (( uh-huh [noise] [noise] that's uh ))
