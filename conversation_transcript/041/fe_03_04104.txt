48.97 59.31 B: i know that the uh the industry is in a great deal of flux right now but if m- if money is no object uh i can just keep pouring money into it until it succeeds right [laughter] 

58.66 64.75 A: yeah you know oh yeah uh that sounds really great i think if i were to do it uh 

64.90 73.52 A: you know i've watched the sopranos and it it seems like it would be blast would be to open up a uh a strip club 

73.69 77.68 A: it seems like th- that would be like a real lotta fun 

78.40 80.99 B: uh you know the first thing that comes to yeah 

79.58 87.70 A: and then it makes a lotta money and uh i like that you know i like to work at night and uh i 

82.09 83.52 B: [laughter] 

87.76 95.31 A: i'm not one for getting up early in the morning and uh i'm single so i think it would be uh

100.15 103.32 B: [noise] [mn] well um um [mn] 

104.33 114.48 B: of course uh you you might have to deal with soprano type people uh in in working at a strip club and they might also notice that money is no object so 

114.37 125.16 B: i don't know [laughter] um uh uh i- opening your own strip club is kind of kind of uh kinda daunting uh to me uh j- busin- business wise 

125.03 129.37 A: not necessarily because i had an optical store years ago 

129.62 141.27 A: and uh while i was on the store about two years after i had opened the store a little strip club opened and they just began with nothing and uh 

141.32 152.50 A: uh they're still there this is many years later and they're huge and uh they're always busy and they they do a ton of advertising and i've seen 'em with 

152.47 166.24 A: billboards and they're always packed and i went there a couple of times 'cause they have great food and they they're swamped with business and uh the guys who owned it i think were from uh 

166.31 175.35 A: germany and uh no you don't have to deal with people you know with the uh mob i mean it's 

175.47 188.07 A: you know pretty straight you don't get hassled it's like any business i mean there's money in it and uh hey there's there's mob people in the uh music business too 

187.64 190.79 B: that's true that's true um 

191.30 192.26 B: um 

192.32 194.03 B: yeah the um 

194.22 195.39 B: um 

195.88 201.11 B: the mob does come to mind um in you know [mn] as 

201.65 211.48 B: as i cons- as i consider the music business or or any other business on on that scale down the road but but when i think of uh 

211.51 214.56 B: uh businesses that um 

214.65 216.22 B: um 

217.45 223.19 B: i guess that involve the the you know the uh the the seven deadly sins the mob comes closer to mind 

225.66 233.73 A: uh no not necessarily i mean it's just like it's a business that makes money and the the mob doesn't get involved i mean the 

233.59 244.40 A: it's you know like an optical business i mean you you know you you you've got a business and you open it up and you you operate it and that's it i mean 

244.37 255.03 A: the mob doesn't get involved in it and actually in l._a. uh there virtually isn't too much of a mob and when you see all this stuff 

255.31 259.18 A: on t._v. i don't know where are you located 

258.95 260.17 B: new york 

260.10 263.03 A: you're in new york okay new york city 

262.66 263.56 B: yes 

263.21 272.36 A: okay well in new york city you still have a lot of the mob but we're see i'm from cleveland uh they used to have the mob the mob a lot of it was 

272.18 283.64 A: you know there isn't too much of a mob left in cleveland in l._a. there really isn't and in a lot of parts of the country there really isn't that much of a mob left you really 

283.45 295.03 A: you don't get hassled you don't get bothered it's a business that makes money you operate it you keep within the law and l._a. really never had that much of a mob so you're 

294.94 300.18 A: you're pretty well home free with it it's a a something that makes money 

300.29 302.63 A: you keep uh your nose clean 

302.75 308.50 A: and you run it right yeah it's like i say there's a lotta money in it 

305.01 307.14 B: [noise] of course since since we're 

307.89 318.18 B: since we're d- since we're dreaming and money is no object you know it just hit me that um that the movie business would probably be a uh a wonderful and glamorous business 

309.63 310.54 A: yeah 

318.19 324.73 A: that would be too you know i can see doing that for a lotta fun too i think that would be a great business too 

318.21 319.13 B: um 

319.52 320.58 B: yeah 

324.75 328.75 A: you know like you say money is no object and uh 

328.82 340.23 A: you know you can put millions and millions of dollars into it and if like you say if money is no object you you do a movie and if it fails you you'd try another movie 

339.61 341.27 B: that's right there was some 

340.50 346.48 A: and you know you can get the best directors and the best actors and actresses and 

346.36 359.04 A: [mn] buy the best scripts and afford to buy 'em and i guess if you you you get the best directors and you get the best actors and actresses and you can get the best writers i would assume 

358.89 364.76 A: that you know you keep rolling the dice somewhere down the line you're gonna hit 

364.76 366.52 B: yeah yeah 

365.93 369.17 A: and you'll probably get an academy award 

369.11 372.41 B: i think you're right there you know it um 

372.78 375.65 B: it's sort of like the um uh 

375.78 383.85 B: th- th- the arab sheikh at the roulette table and every time you lose you just double your bet and you never you know that money's no object so it it's 

382.79 392.67 A: e- exactly but the the thing with that is too is that i- in the hotels in in vegas will only go 

393.06 396.06 A: so high on on bets too [mn] 

396.63 398.39 B: oh that's interesting well 

397.78 409.37 A: in other words you know th- they do have you know they'll raise limits and raise limits but th- th- they're not gonna be taking ten million dollar bets you know 

409.36 415.91 A: and th- then the arab sheikh they they usually from what you read they usually come out losers 

415.24 417.13 B: [laughter] 

416.29 430.94 A: and as you know as anyone will tell ya those th- you know the reason they get all those extras and the rooms and everything is because they're losing money and you know the the hotels like anyone will tell you 

426.70 427.84 B: [laughter] 

431.04 433.66 A: they're not built by winners you know 

433.48 439.75 B: yeah yeah well i guess i was being as as hypothetical as the a- assignment of the moment 

438.79 446.02 A: right and and then when you really think about it you say well uh [sigh] you know um 

445.16 445.75 B: (( [noise] )) 

446.06 449.94 A: you know money is no object you know it's 

450.57 460.77 A: it's r- really dreaming because i mean you know when you you talk about movies you're you're talking that you you could be losing hundreds of millions of dollars 

460.10 461.73 B: yeah 

460.87 463.20 A: uh you know on some of these movies 

463.21 467.83 B: [sigh] well you know what you know what this makes me think about that uh 

467.91 477.33 B: that uh work c- c- can be fun if you're if you're not biting your nails all the time if if if money is no o- [laughter] 

474.29 482.09 A: right a- and then you know when you say money is no object you see i i'd like a strip club i i mean 

482.49 486.37 A: i- if i really got a really elaborate strip club 

486.46 489.64 A: maybe i would lose a million dollars if it failed 

489.23 490.40 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh [sigh] )) 

489.72 501.07 A: and i i don't know and the uh on on uh your music business if you failed what would it cost you two or three four million dollars five million i don't know 

500.64 506.93 B: um well i [mn] it a- again it it depends on on on how uh 

507.54 512.64 B: how big you want how big an enterprise you want you want it to be um 

513.06 515.99 B: um i mean promotion can um 

516.23 520.42 B: can s- suck away so much uh capital 

519.08 521.51 A: ten million dollars if you failed 

520.94 522.49 B: yeah 

522.17 534.62 A: all right uh so mine would be a million two million dollars if i failed big time yours would be ten million dollars if you failed big time but the movie business could be 

534.73 536.57 A: hundreds of millions if 

535.63 537.35 B: that's true that's true 

536.82 545.00 A: you fa- failed big time so when you say money is no object you know you kinda wonder how far it would really go 

546.04 550.25 B: oh well a- a- again uh that's that's y- yeah 

548.28 553.73 A: you know because if you did two or three movies that failed it could be two hundred million dollars 

553.96 555.15 B: that's true 

554.84 558.99 A: you know i i mean yeah what it really says is 

559.07 566.96 A: you know if money is no object i uh i mean it'd be fi- you know i i i think y- y- are you married 

566.28 567.60 B: [noise] no i'm not 

567.05 571.85 A: yeah neither am i i mean i know myself i can see 

571.97 574.42 A: doing the strip club i i 

574.33 587.67 A: i don't know much about music i can see doing the music would be fun and i can see doing the movies i i think you see the movies and the music and i imagine a strip club if you weren't worried about the mob 

587.74 591.85 A: you probably could see it could be something that could be fun too 

591.91 593.08 B: sure 

593.14 594.12 B: sure 

593.20 599.89 A: yeah i i mean all we're saying is we're doing things that there's a lotta good looking girls and there's a lotta nice
