12.46 18.78 B: uh sure i think um the idea that money is no object makes it a kind of a fun thing to think about 

18.92 22.92 B: um if i were to open my own business i think i would open an antique store 

23.39 32.23 B: i'm really interested in antiques and i love going to flea markets and antique um sales and shows and things like that um 

32.29 45.34 B: [lipsmack] probably i would look for an area somewhere in new england that didn't have many antique stores and would look for um probably a wealthy area that would 

45.76 48.81 B: that would be interested in that sort of of thing 

48.94 50.18 B: and how about you 

50.18 51.46 A: well 

51.62 58.91 A: i've never thought about that before but if i would start a business i would like to start a music school 

58.80 59.70 B: (( mm wow )) 

59.27 64.07 A: since i sing myself and my whole family are musicians 

63.53 64.86 B: (( mhm right ))

68.08 69.60 B: mhm 

70.54 79.14 A: so i would like to open a music school and most probably in a place where it's pretty like in the country 

73.18 74.47 B: mhm 

78.54 79.92 B: mhm 

79.15 89.66 A: and if we have plenty of money we could give scholarships to really talented people which would be terrific you know it would be a very good idea 

86.50 87.47 B: that would 

87.63 88.72 B: (( be and )) 

89.32 93.99 B: and would you op- would you have it for children also or would it be just for adults 

93.55 97.25 A: well i was thinking for one for adults you know 

95.99 97.19 B: mhm 

97.37 104.28 A: because um i was thinking uh about voice a lot because that's my field 

103.93 105.48 B: mhm 

104.41 108.65 A: and unfortunately a lot of people uh 

108.71 119.03 A: take their children for voice lessons when they are really not ready the vocal chords are not strong enough and it's not good they should wait they should have a musical education first 

112.04 113.70 B: mhm 

114.40 116.00 B: mhm 

119.07 123.65 A: (( piano theory composition whatever you know )) 

122.61 128.10 B: yeah how how old do you think is a good age to start i'd heard before that it takes a while for for

132.67 134.61 B: oh oh really yeah 

132.81 133.91 A: you know 

133.97 136.06 A: because your vocal chords really aren't 

136.21 137.06 A: uh 

137.36 141.07 A: strong enough well i suppose it's in an individual thing 

138.42 139.94 B: mhm 

140.96 142.04 B: yeah 

141.38 143.27 A: you know with different people 

143.12 144.39 B: right 

143.42 144.75 A: but but 

144.95 151.87 A: i always advise people uh when they ask me about voice lessons i say let the child learn 

151.88 163.91 A: piano and all the other musical things which he nowadays a singer needs to know the the singers are very well educated in this country so er 

152.88 154.16 B: mhm 

155.82 157.63 B: mhm 

161.44 162.22 B: (( mm )) 

164.76 172.38 A: why take a chance to ruin the child's voice ya and it would be nice and then we could have concerts 

167.73 168.87 B: that's true 

171.75 172.77 B: mhm 

172.42 179.00 A: and raise money for worthwhile causes believe me there are lots of those around you know

234.97 235.87 A: (( so )) 

238.48 239.36 A: huh 

238.49 249.21 B: that are i think there are a lack of of children's music programs not just singing programs which i know that you are talking about but i think in general there's a lack of good programs for uh for kids 

248.92 253.15 A: well there's a lack of good programs i don't think we're supposed to talk about that 

252.82 253.91 B: oh okay

425.13 426.49 A: oh i see

432.78 437.69 B: i have it's been in the back of my mind for a while and and now that i'm not 

437.70 440.70 B: uh working in an office any more [noise] that's what i'm thinking

456.49 461.57 A: yeah well i think that's wonderful [noise] i think that's terrific now 

461.62 462.63 A: uh 

462.66 470.73 A: the reason that that i would like to have a music school of is becau- 'cause i know there are a lot of talented people

470.57 471.53 B: mhm 

471.05 474.17 A: that have a very hard time 

474.34 477.51 A: with studies it's very expensive here you need 

477.53 480.97 A: a a teacher a voice teacher and you need somebody 

481.05 481.86 A: well 

482.08 488.94 A: to to help you with languages and you need uh somebody to teach us your repertoire 

484.40 485.99 B: mhm 

488.67 490.09 B: mhm 

489.02 490.16 A: you know 

490.46 497.99 A: and um that's very expensive and you have to put a lot of time into it if you really want to do it well 

493.67 494.38 B: [sigh] 

497.70 500.42 B: so would your school have a big staff then

510.76 511.65 B: (( mhm mm )) 

511.44 512.46 A: uh 

512.66 518.32 A: that you've experienced and i went to a scholarship school that was started by toscanini 

518.20 529.96 A: and we had someone who taught violin and someone who taught repertoire and someone who taught voice and someone who taught piano it was really a small school you know 

523.22 524.78 B: mhm 

528.72 530.18 B: mhm 

529.90 536.00 A: but everyone in there was on a scholarship so er it was nice it was very nice 

532.52 533.47 B: oh wow 

534.47 537.96 B: and were you there all day or was that like something you did after school

552.90 553.92 B: mhm 

553.12 554.06 A: you know 

554.20 556.62 A: that that that i [noise] went 

556.76 564.04 A: and uh well that was a five year scholarship and then i studied privately [noise] but it would be a very good thing 

559.60 560.52 B: oh okay 

561.63 562.80 B: (( oh wow [noise] )) 

564.09 571.08 A: and you would only get the really good singers to teach singing and the good pianists [noise] now 

569.09 570.92 B: mhm 

571.17 576.36 A: unfortunately you could be a very good singer and a very bad teacher 

576.12 576.99 B: (( mm )) 

576.34 588.69 A: you know those two things i had my last teacher was a fabulous teacher he couldn't sing worth a damn you know the first time he sang with us i almost died then i had another teacher who was

588.99 594.58 A: [mn] too that were really excellent and i went to hear him in a concert to do oedipus rex 

594.63 596.41 A: and he couldn't sing either
