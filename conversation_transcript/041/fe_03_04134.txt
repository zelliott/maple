85.12 87.01 B: (( one of those things [laughter] )) 

87.80 91.20 A: don't think i would be good at be having my own business

107.74 109.26 A: [sigh] because i 

110.80 114.14 A: do- i would not like having to deal with all the money [laughter] 

114.61 121.28 B: oh now that part i think i wouldn't mind dealing with [laughter] i can deal without the people part [laughter]

124.92 125.63 B: (( hm i )) 

127.12 128.22 B: don't know 

128.54 137.49 B: i think dealing with customers in any kind of situation can be tough sometimes but i guess if you're if it's something you're really interested in that would help a lot 

137.18 138.03 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

139.47 142.12 A: when they're paying money though that's when it gets 

139.54 140.24 B: (( hm )) 

143.06 144.08 A: touchy 

143.87 144.97 B: yeah 

146.53 151.38 B: i don't i think that i would have more trouble with confidence like i'm whenever 

151.51 158.06 B: i do little crafts and things like that and i'm i have a very difficult time in setting prices on things [laughter] 

158.51 170.49 B: because materials don't cost that much but i've thought about going into business doing that and i just don't think i have enough confidence to say well it did take me a lot of time so you should pay x. amount even though it's something small [laughter] 

170.12 172.26 A: right what kind of crafts do you do 

172.52 180.46 B: well lately i've been into using the little um polymer clay you can just bake it in your own ov- and make things 

180.03 180.84 A: uh-huh 

180.97 184.77 B: figures i would get a call waiting beep but i won't answer it [laughter] 

184.09 185.29 A: [laughter] 

184.98 188.07 B: i'll ruin our our thing here [laughter] 

188.45 189.50 B: but um 

188.72 189.72 A: (( [laughter] [cough] )) 

190.85 198.27 B: whenever i make them i'm i'm very critical of them and i just i notice every little flaw so i don't think i'd be a good business person [laughter] 

198.60 200.28 A: are you a perfectionist 

200.31 202.75 B: i would have to say i am [laughter] 

201.92 203.32 A: you sound like it [laughter] 

203.29 206.59 B: i just give them to people and i criticize them [laughter] 

203.57 204.33 A: so 

206.07 207.97 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

208.07 209.04 B: so 

208.67 210.39 A: i do cross stitch 

210.29 213.63 B: i've never tried that but it looks like it'd be neat 

211.68 215.62 A: and it takes it takes a really long time 

215.88 217.21 B: yeah 

216.07 218.66 A: if you don't do it you don't really recog- realize 

219.21 221.54 A: it takes about a year to do one project 

221.69 224.00 B: wow i did not realize that 

221.78 224.23 A: and so it does 

224.51 228.05 A: not just not a very tiny one but just a normal sized picture 

227.86 228.91 B: mhm 

229.03 234.24 B: i wouldn't say that i would have thought that it was something that would be done quickly but a year's a long time [laughter] 

233.62 235.12 A: yes it is 

235.25 236.19 B: gee 

235.34 238.72 A: and so if i were to sell like i've done one that's really big 

238.98 243.07 A: if i were to sell it i i wouldn't take less than a thousand dollars for it [laughter] 

242.52 243.86 B: oh my goodness 

243.50 246.70 A: you know [laughter] and nobody's gonna wanna pay that 

246.93 251.77 B: and and i worry about asking like [laughter] anything for 

247.04 248.63 A: i wouldn't even try to sell 

251.93 262.88 B: mine like 'cause i have sold some things on ebay just to kinda test the waters out [laughter] 'specially around christmas time 'cause then you can personalize things and that kind of stuff 

256.93 257.98 A: (( it mhm )) 

261.54 262.29 A: (( right )) 

263.71 269.83 B: but like i said i'm still critical if i just give something to my mother i'm like i i know i messed up here and i know i should have gotten this [laughter] 

269.42 270.21 A: (( oh )) 

270.82 271.55 B: so 

271.66 273.18 A: to your own mother [laughter] 

272.82 274.17 B: [laughter] 

274.23 278.02 B: yeah it's definitely not my thing i don't think to be a businesswoman [laughter] 

277.57 278.74 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

279.85 280.67 B: but 

280.90 284.22 B: and i don't read that much any more [laughter] 

284.58 287.76 B: so the book store definitely wouldn't be mine but i think 

287.09 289.04 A: well you should do the craft store 

290.36 291.05 B: hm 

291.94 297.01 B: just too critical i think i'd have just so much anxiety worrying about it [laughter] 

296.62 297.55 A: oh 

297.88 300.66 B: [laughter] so why aren't you doing the book store is it the money 

301.41 303.57 A: mm yeah that'd be the main thing 

303.36 304.39 B: yeah 

304.13 304.93 A: uh 

305.23 307.60 A: i just couldn't deal with all of it by myself 

307.85 308.57 B: hm 

309.15 311.14 B: too bad money's an issue in life 

311.39 312.72 A: (( oh it is [laughter] )) 

312.13 313.04 B: [laughter] 

314.96 317.46 B: are we allowed to ask like just what state you're in 

317.93 319.57 A: [laughter] ah i assume so 

319.37 320.35 B: okay 

319.76 321.09 A: i'm in north carolina 

321.24 324.90 B: oh so they hook us up together because so am i i just don't have the accent [laughter] 

325.17 328.85 A: i do [laughter] 

325.94 330.23 B: yeah [laughter] i thought you sounded a little familiar from people around the area [laughter] but 

330.44 331.50 A: [cough] i'm from 

332.39 335.19 A: below ashville in between ashville and charlotte so 

335.57 342.41 B: i'm in the lake forest area we're actually in the boonies not [laughter] considered lake forest but not really [laughter] 

343.10 346.33 B: and they need some businesses around here there's nothing here [laughter] 

345.98 347.19 A: (( oh hm )) 

347.76 353.19 B: so you can have a bookstore and probably make good money because we have to travel forever to get to raleigh just to get anything 

353.36 354.90 A: oh yeah 

354.93 355.66 B: hm 

355.11 358.32 A: so you're more in the eastern part or the middle part of the state

361.76 363.50 A: they haven't hit your house have they 

363.11 364.52 B: (( no uh-uh [sigh] )) 

365.57 367.80 B: but they do have 'em 

368.86 373.68 B: we are like right on um a county line and they keep putting that county 

373.86 376.44 B: on t._v. and that gets you worried [laughter] 

374.04 375.22 A: on the warning 

375.68 377.46 A: yeah yeah

383.48 385.12 B: that's not good [mn] 

384.59 386.09 A: and several uh 

386.44 391.24 A: probably hundreds of trees in the county [mn] trees that were a hundred years old i mean 

391.29 392.62 B: that's a shame 

391.74 393.14 A: big trees it 

393.59 397.86 A: was the worst storm a lot of people that have lived here all their life said it's the worst storm they've ever seen 

399.03 404.28 B: we happened to be on vacation during the ice storms and when we came home we couldn't believe our yard [laughter]

407.00 408.69 A: oh my goodness 

407.97 415.58 B: yeah because we just we have a lot of trees and it seems like there's just new things falling all the time because of it 

415.39 416.20 A: uh-huh 

417.72 420.94 B: hm i don't know if we have to stick on the su- subject or not [laughter] 

419.58 423.07 A: that's what i was wondering i was i think maybe they 

423.85 426.46 A: see if you do get off the subject or not [laughter] i don't know 

426.06 427.09 B: [laughter] 

427.88 429.00 B: okay 

429.54 432.89 B: so well i go to borders a lot [laughter] 

432.57 437.39 A: [cough] [laughter] i like that one that's one of my favorite stores

477.94 479.02 B: yeah 

478.22 480.75 A: (( that's how it would be in my bookstore ))
