0.00 1.66 B: hi i'm terry 

1.59 3.67 A: um hi i'm christina 

3.77 4.49 B: (( okay )) 

5.57 8.70 B: so is this your first one 'cause i don't know what to do [laughter] 

7.95 10.32 A: yeah no me too [laughter] 

9.12 11.56 B: [laughter] okay 

10.70 18.59 A: my my friend was just like you should set up for this and i'll get a dollar and i was like oh and she'll go you'll get ten dollars and i was like whoa okay 

14.21 15.49 B: [laughter] 

17.59 23.79 B: [laughter] so are we supposed to discuss this what we would do wanna open up our own business 

23.63 24.78 A: yeah 

24.16 27.69 B: i guess okay what would you wanna do 

27.73 38.01 A: um right i think i think if i'd wanna do a business it would have to be something that would provide some sort of like discernible good thing for people 

38.02 39.08 B: okay 

38.70 46.83 A: like i mean like i really wouldn't wanna feed into like some kind of capitalist machine basically which is like sounds really like 

42.91 44.08 B: mhm 

46.85 51.13 A: ultimate like liberal college student sort of thing to say but like 

51.35 57.02 A: i think it would have to be something that was ultimately sort of rewarding on a level that wasn't just financial 

56.76 60.50 B: mhm oh yeah and i definitely agree with that yeah 

57.44 58.55 A: but i'm not 

59.81 66.62 A: yeah i'm not sure i haven't really thought about it too much 'cause i've never really thought about going into business myself 

66.44 76.46 B: um i think that if i would go into business it would probably i'd wanna go into something where it made people feel good and like i'm really interested in um 

76.66 89.64 B: like spa type things like massage and and and you know aromatherapy and things like that because i think it's like really good and that's something that i would love to learn about and and i would like to be in a business with that 

79.17 80.73 A: oh yeah 

82.52 83.87 A: yeah 

89.95 95.32 A: yeah i mean i've been taking some swedish massage classes and it's just really great i mean 

90.26 91.28 B: (( for sure )) 

95.16 104.97 A: you feel like you've you really like sometimes it just seems like all mysticism but like if you like buy into it and like go into it with open mind like i mean i've seen people who like go into the class like 

104.89 116.67 A: just really really tense and like walk away just like so much more positive energy and just like feel so much better about themselves and like a a service would definitely be um something good i think some sort of like service 

110.39 111.48 B: mhm 

116.44 126.71 B: yeah that's what i'm thinking something where you could go and and uh something maybe a little bit more just than just a spa it you know you could relax and and also like just 

116.68 117.45 A: um 

126.75 129.84 B: i mean have time to yourself and get in you know 

129.69 130.45 A: [noise] 

130.06 137.82 B: and rela- i don't know but just something in that in that vein i i would i would find that a lot of you know fun and and fulfilling 

131.22 132.09 A: uh-huh 

138.25 144.56 A: right so would you want to like actually be doing like the service yourself or would you be like contracting it out to other people 

144.19 150.27 B: you know i don't know 'cause i have thought about going and taking classes and learning how to do it 

149.99 150.93 A: mhm 

150.30 155.50 B: um it's something i really would have to think about i think po- maybe i would wanna 

155.39 166.05 B: do it myself first you know and really learn how to do it and start it out that way because i think no one should be in a business where they don't know and and they don't have a hand in 

159.45 160.44 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

165.97 166.82 A: right 

166.21 168.59 B: what they're actually do- you know [mn] 

167.92 180.60 A: so would you like get employed at a similar kind of place like spa type thing just to like get that experience and then from there get capital and form your own business oh wait oh money was no object right 

177.91 189.02 B: oh yeah yeah definitely definitely you'd ha- i i think you'd have to 'cause you you know you'd have to like build up contacts and and find out if that's really what you like too 

185.36 186.60 A: yeah 

188.80 190.19 A: (( mhm 'cause )) 

189.36 191.23 B: b- before going into something 

191.03 199.30 A: right i feel like there's so many businesses that are based on a concept of like selling money and like don't actually provide any service or good themselves but like 

198.54 199.78 B: mhm 

199.37 211.56 A: like set up like smaller businesses with like big like wholesalers or like you know like some other like big thing that like the smaller businesses don't actually have access to themselves and li- or like you know do advertising for them or something 

211.06 212.20 B: uh-huh 

211.39 215.75 A: so they're actually like not doing anything but they're like getting a lot of money like 

214.74 215.67 B: right 

215.95 225.68 B: right no i know what you're saying all they are is the big business part of it they're just funding the you know the capital or whatever and making lots of money and they're not involved in any of it 

223.00 224.10 A: mhm 

225.15 227.32 A: yeah so like 

226.13 227.94 B: and uh i get what you're saying 

227.67 231.57 A: yeah definitely like i definitely respect like businesses that 

231.46 238.17 A: like that aren't public and you know you like actually know the people who owned it and they can tell you how they formed the business and like 

237.00 238.12 B: mhm 

237.96 248.88 A: you know going through all of that like i definitely like i'm willing to spend more at stores like that than like less at stores that are just like these big you know faceless corporations 

244.86 245.82 B: right 

248.41 249.55 B: mhm 

249.68 258.36 B: yeah i would definitely wanna be in a business where i was hands on i wanna be i don't wanna be that person at home calling up and going so how's it going 

253.95 254.83 A: mhm 

258.31 259.18 A: uh-huh 

258.49 272.72 B: now i wanna be in it i wanna know who's working for me and that they're happy too i would want it to be like a big happy family type [laughter] thing you know where the the employees are like family and um you know everybody it was a good deal for everybody 

265.64 266.57 A: uh-huh 

272.54 273.38 A: right 

272.99 275.89 B: and everybody felt good about going in to work 

275.19 276.13 A: mhm 

275.91 278.93 B: otherwise i i don't think i would be happy 

278.87 280.27 A: yeah 

278.97 286.00 B: with it 'cause i know how i feel you know when you work in a situation where you're not happy and you're not satisfied in in whatever it is 

285.88 287.07 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

285.94 298.56 B: it's awful you know so if if i my goal would be to do something that's good for the people who come for the service a- and for the for the people who work for me with me you know that kinda thing 

287.17 288.21 A: yeah 

297.19 298.58 A: (( [noise] right )) 

298.60 306.93 A: right like i think like things like profit sharing and like just like basically like treating your employees really well like always pays off i mean 

306.76 313.13 A: my friend works for kenneth cole and she's like there's like these little drink stands like all over the place and you can get like all these non alcoholic 

312.93 317.63 A: um like drinks like like shirley temples and stuff and it's really really nice yeah 

315.14 317.03 B: (( [sigh] oh that's so nice )) 

317.42 329.20 A: and it just like promotes this really like um lively sort of like um community and just like and just like refreshment and just like feeling good about yourself and like feeling good about your work like your work environment and like 

326.26 327.42 B: mhm 

329.01 332.75 A: the people you're working with and stuff i think stuff like that's really important 

332.55 344.89 B: [sigh] [mn] yeah i do i think it is it's just it's a shame that so many companies i mean for the most part they don't they don't they just try to squeeze every last bit out of people and don't you know give anything to make you feel good you know 

341.50 342.61 A: mhm 

344.38 345.27 A: right 

344.70 350.01 B: and it doesn't have to always be monetary it's just like you're saying that little beverage stand 

349.68 350.55 A: mhm 

349.84 360.68 B: or you know a picnic or hey let's you know just just so you feel part of a family and and feel appreciated and that would be what i would want if i had a business 

357.31 358.24 A: right 

358.67 371.09 A: [noise] i think it also like gets you employees too 'cause i know so many people who work for starbucks who just based on like the kind of the concept of this you know chain coffee place would never have wanted to work there 

364.96 365.88 B: mhm 

370.88 376.79 A: except that they have an amazing benefits package and you only have to work like twenty hours a week to receive it 

376.61 391.49 A: and you know and they're graduating school but they don't have jobs yet and they're not they don't have hea- healthcare so that they need that for you know health insurance and a lot of people know about it like a lot of ex dot comers you know go into just go start working for starbucks 'cause it's just a really great benefits package 

376.74 377.82 B: right 

381.31 382.32 B: mhm 

391.28 401.59 B: i think also besides that i mean from what this is i practically live at starbucks um i find the people there just to to look like they they're having a good time at least where i live 

395.74 396.73 A: mhm 

401.46 411.45 B: um the ones i've went to i think they're happy you know i think they're getting the benefits package and maybe they're treating them you know better other than that you know um 

404.36 404.99 A: hm 

410.60 420.32 A: yeah i think it's like also [mn] starbucks is actually a really good company in terms of like you can like move up like legitimately move up in like the ladder um like towards management and stuff 

417.79 418.95 B: mhm 

419.72 420.76 B: right 

420.97 431.91 B: no it's it's definitely you know how you treat your em- your employees if you treat them good and make them feel valued that's the best way i i mean i i wish everyone thought that way [laughter] 

422.34 423.21 A: i know 

425.52 426.48 A: yeah 

431.22 441.99 A: [laughter] right right um i don't know if i could like feasibly run a business myself though like i don't think i have the entrepreneurial kind of guts to do it 

441.63 442.60 B: (( mm )) 

442.04 445.06 A: you know like i mean like just the concept of 

445.36 456.48 A: [noise] like putting yourself totally out there and people like so many people like just you know mortgage their houses and like give up their entire lives and like throw themselves into that and not that i can't do that but like 

456.64 461.21 A: i don't know i mean [mn] you just have to like you you're kind of at the 

461.08 475.15 A: will of the people if you're providing if your service that you're providing is good enough if they can afford the service you're providing i mean the economy being kind of bad stuff now and i mean i don't know like i i i feel like it's kind of nice to have the safety of 

469.52 470.61 B: mhm 

475.17 482.98 A: you not personally putting out like that kind of risk and like having someone else do that and you working for them you know 

482.23 491.04 B: i i know yeah i know exactly what you mean because my husband and i we discussed for years i mean about opening some kind of business for ourselves and 

490.72 491.87 A: mhm 

491.00 498.52 B: he and you know he worked with my father so it was almost in in a family business so it was almost in effect like having a his own business 

497.66 498.80 A: (( right [noise] )) 

498.54 502.41 B: responsibility wise and and we just totally said you know what 

500.25 501.17 A: uh-huh 

502.50 505.59 B: no because you're really kinda 

506.13 509.48 B: [mn] it's scary first of all if what if it doesn't work 

509.05 510.39 A: (( [noise] right )) 

509.85 513.77 B: all the money you need to lay out and and you could lose it all second 

513.68 524.95 B: you're tied you're the owner you have to you have to be there you have to make decisions and you can't just say gee you know what [laughter] i wanna get away because most of the times you can't [noise] 

518.90 520.20 A: right 

524.63 525.75 A: mhm 

525.00 536.79 B: you know so i definitely see i mean i'd love to if i want if i did open a business it would be something in the field that i said but definitely i don't know if it's something myself that i would be able to do 

536.31 537.73 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

536.92 539.78 B: to be commit- to be that committed i don't know 

539.69 552.01 A: and the other thing is you usually i mean unless you do very very well for yourselves you usually don't have that much profit that comes out of it like not that you're not doing well per se but that so much money just gets 

549.78 550.81 B: mhm 

551.81 557.42 A: put back into the business i mean my friend um he's having a big problem now because 

553.55 554.62 B: right 

557.27 562.38 A: he his pare- like he for to the next semester if he wants to stay at school and that 

562.14 569.74 A: he's gonna like he needs significantly more financial aid because um like all of his parents' money like they they own a hardware store 

569.50 583.88 A: and all the money just goes back into their business but what goes what goes down on the books is that they have a lot of money but like you know it's not that that his parents are gonna sell the store and sell everything in the store so that they he can pay for college like that's not feasible you know 

571.67 573.09 B: right right 

575.12 576.32 B: mhm 

583.02 587.53 B: right exactly yeah no i know [laughter] i know i just had my daughter away in college so 

587.32 599.95 B: i know all about that that's it stinks [laughter] i yeah so it it's it's hard i uh my sister and husband uh and her husband have a um [lipsmack] a car dealership an a small one and i mean it 

596.91 597.93 A: mhm
