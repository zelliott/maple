188.09 189.13 A: oh really 

188.45 195.37 B: so something that's unusual that would kinda meet the need where you know there's 

193.62 197.40 A: right and you think gothic would meet a lot of need where you are 

196.77 198.16 B: um 

199.61 204.09 B: there some i mean there's just small areas all over 

201.56 202.33 A: oh 

204.22 213.11 B: but you know there's definitely a crowd in san francisco and l._a. so probably you know meet some of that but just kinda gen- kinda like 

208.81 209.78 A: really 

213.14 216.32 B: that and kinda club wear so 

215.39 216.59 A: (( right [noise] ))

223.55 224.95 A: oh okay 

225.52 227.45 B: what what is it like 

226.74 235.13 A: well it's it's more like the [noise] teen type wear that the girls are wearing now i don't know between fourteen and twenty 

232.73 233.88 B: (( oh okay )) 

234.88 237.18 B: is it kinda like that 

235.25 236.18 A: (( type thing )) 

236.58 237.19 A: (( [mn] )) 

237.26 239.48 A: possibly [noise] possibly 

239.09 239.89 B: oh 

240.12 245.69 A: i'd i'd probably have a mix so that it would satisfy a lot of different [sigh] um 

240.32 240.98 B: (( okay )) 

246.14 246.92 A: (( you know )) 

247.89 248.93 B: mhm

253.72 255.09 A: (( [noise] um )) 

257.04 258.67 A: and let's see 

260.37 263.17 A: [noise] i don't know if i'd go with the older generation though 

263.21 264.50 A: in the shop 

264.32 265.22 B: uh-huh 

264.63 266.73 A: i wouldn't wanna scare people away [laughter]

270.62 272.31 A: (( oh okay okay mhm )) 

272.99 275.74 B: it's still okay for us i guess 

275.94 277.34 B: like um 

277.44 283.01 B: so she will design i would probably be interested looking into like different fabrics 

283.13 285.02 B: to use for the business 

285.20 293.68 B: and then also maybe importing some stuff too from like china or something to put into the store 

291.62 292.48 A: right 

293.58 294.63 A: (( wow )) 

293.76 299.17 B: we just wanna offer stuff that's unique and you know just not something 

299.26 303.92 B: you see every day but not like like freakish weird you know just something 

302.88 304.22 A: right right 

304.15 307.78 B: that stands out but not too too much 

307.64 309.14 A: well excellent 

308.80 309.79 B: yeah 

309.83 312.20 A: maybe i'd probably hit hawaii too 

312.26 313.00 B: (( mm )) 

314.05 318.30 A: china oh you could get a lot of things in china mostly everything's made in china mhm mhm 

318.07 322.04 B: yeah china and taiwan or hong kong like 

322.10 333.06 B: actually she went with me there we went shopping there we we we saw some of the stuff there it's like there's always new things coming out there and not enough of it come out 

333.23 335.34 B: um in the u._s. 

334.10 335.30 A: come out of there 

335.61 337.97 B: for like fashion wise 

337.73 338.59 A: right 

338.00 339.30 B: like they're always 

339.33 342.67 B: you know they're always more ahead well in like 

342.79 354.15 B: you know france too you know just the fashion areas like more of the new stuff come out and it doesn't like catch on that fast here so we could like offer some stuff like that 

346.19 347.57 A: industry yeah 

353.93 356.38 A: oh have you ever been to new york city 

356.11 357.88 B: no i haven't 

357.26 363.11 A: oh you should go there i mean they have a lot of things come in directly from china and all over 

363.09 364.03 B: oh 

363.38 365.32 A: in different parts of manhattan 

365.09 365.95 B: uh-huh 

366.31 367.17 B: (( okay )) 

366.85 367.58 A: so 

368.43 375.06 B: well i i will new york is definitely a place for me to go one of these days i just haven't had a chance yet 

372.59 373.64 A: yeah 

374.42 378.70 A: oh you'd love it chinatown is just like china itself i'm telling you 

377.53 378.43 B: (( uh-huh )) 

379.28 380.06 B: (( hm )) 

380.16 384.64 A: actually with the sars that's going on n- on now chinatown's almost closed down 

384.95 386.08 B: (( oh really )) 

385.33 392.20 A: bec- yeah because a lot of their food comes from china and they're afraid that they're gonna be you know contracting it through the food 

392.22 393.14 B: oh 

392.28 398.51 A: but otherwise i love chinatown they have so many different things that the clothes stores are outrageous 

398.36 399.34 B: mhm 

398.79 401.00 A: they do have a lot of different clothes there 

401.45 402.20 B: hm 

401.47 403.40 A: and they're so inexpensive 

403.48 404.54 B: mhm 

404.61 408.08 A: would your would your line of clothing be expensive or 

407.35 408.43 B: (( um )) 

408.67 409.79 B: it would 

409.95 414.81 B: well okay her stuff would probably be more high end because 

413.17 414.24 A: mhm 

415.76 418.77 B: it's just unusual and might take longer to make 

418.61 419.59 A: right 

419.15 421.40 B: so the labor and the 

421.96 427.79 B: uh intri- it's it'll be like really intricate and everything so it it would probably cost more 

425.37 426.19 A: mhm 

427.59 428.69 A: right 

428.05 437.15 B: and um the stuff we import will probably be like lower end or middle to lower end just something affordable 

437.28 438.08 B: but 

438.09 439.02 B: still 

439.22 440.89 B: that looks different 

440.38 443.69 A: would the would that be more expensive with the importing 

443.63 447.30 B: um no not not with the way china's going like 

447.31 450.82 B: w._t._o.'s coming up so um 

450.94 455.50 B: everything's gonna be i mean everything's gonna be cheaper to make 

455.77 461.80 B: because there's so much competition out there and the soon there won't be any quotas so it's 

457.85 458.83 A: right 

461.21 462.90 A: oh wow 

462.16 465.45 B: you know they're gonna take out the quota system pretty soon 

465.45 467.16 A: (( well that'd be great )) 

466.84 467.83 B: yeah 

467.93 470.09 A: it sounds like you're really gonna do this 

470.34 472.72 B: yeah we've been talking about it for a long time 

472.43 473.58 A: very good 

473.01 474.99 B: i mean um probably 

475.00 477.25 B: not in not like the next 

477.33 480.30 B: year or two but we still like talk about 

480.47 487.78 B: um ideas like name of [mn] the business um like we we bounce uh back ideas like 

487.48 490.17 A: do you have any off off the top of your head 

487.80 488.83 B: okay we 

490.07 497.80 B: um well one was like metamorphosis or the other one was like phoenix feather or something like that 

493.82 494.68 A: mhm 

498.02 500.35 B: and um 

500.99 506.04 B: we and we thought like since we don't have the funds to start to open the store 

506.13 516.08 B: but you know just to do any type of b- business so we thought maybe just to start um internet wise she might start on that first and then i'll jump in on it later on 

516.21 521.45 B: like 'cause you know internet costs a lot less a lot less to maintain 

519.55 520.40 A: right 

521.12 522.12 A: right 

521.56 525.61 B: so you could and she's sold stuff online before so 

524.81 527.66 A: oh she has very good 

525.78 526.77 B: yeah 

527.04 527.82 B: yeah 

530.21 531.54 A: that's interesting 

532.25 537.81 B: mhm so what type of fashion would you do i mean for your store 

538.03 540.02 A: [sigh] um 

539.21 541.00 B: is it more for the 

541.12 543.73 A: the younger kids jeans 

543.51 545.03 B: oh for children 

544.94 547.05 A: yeah i think so 

545.93 546.60 B: (( okay )) 

547.90 552.60 A: i'm in my forties so i have i know a lot of moms that buy for their kids 

549.55 550.46 B: mhm 

552.48 553.78 B: (( oh okay )) 

552.83 557.18 A: so i'd probably stick with something like that because there's there's definitely a 

557.29 558.86 A: a market for it 

558.60 564.51 B: uh-huh would you buy like have a store that's similar to like old navy or 

564.78 566.70 A: uh i don't know if i'd go 

568.64 577.79 A: buying in well [noise] i don't know because i don't think i'd i'd be able to compete with such a [sigh] big store like that or a chain of stores 

577.19 579.00 B: i mean style wise 

578.44 581.32 A: style oh yeah yeah yeah old navy's 

581.62 582.84 A: (( cute um )) 

581.68 582.55 B: (( okay [mn] )) 

584.33 585.04 B: (( hm )) 

589.21 591.85 A: so do your other friends do this 

592.75 593.54 B: the 

593.49 594.26 A: (( with the )) 

593.71 594.94 B: the phone calls 

594.37 595.94 A: yeah 

595.53 596.57 B: um 

595.96 597.29 A: how did you hear about it 

597.06 599.22 B: i heard about it on craig's list 

599.37 599.95 A: oh
