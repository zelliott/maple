29.33 32.02 B: yeah [laughter] yeah 

31.64 35.50 A: anyway so the topic's about starting your own business 

35.16 41.02 B: yeah i feel kinda like ooh you know we're rushed for time to try to think of what i would do but 

41.05 50.53 B: i guess you know when i occasionally i think about it and wonder what i would start but um my husband always wants to start a restaurant 

47.22 47.79 A: (( [noise] )) 

50.71 56.20 B: but i'm i'm not really too crazy about that 'cause it's just too much like hard work [laughter] you know 

55.91 57.37 A: yeah 

56.66 60.23 B: restaurants are just th- they're really just too much and uh 

60.98 64.53 B: your stuck hiring usually like teenagers to 

64.67 67.68 B: to be your employees that you can't depend on you know 

67.57 68.62 A: that's true 

68.36 70.78 B: so i don't know what would you do 

70.50 84.28 A: well [lipsmack] well that's that's hard for me also because my problem is i've got way way too many ideas of things i wanna do [mn] the opposite kind of thing is like i just can't choose one and 

79.45 80.55 B: yeah 

84.26 91.42 A: i i i think it's well my the thing is the problem is every business i think of the main well i mean 

91.55 94.24 A: the main ones i wanna do don't make money 

93.97 96.02 B: yeah [laughter] 

94.50 100.25 A: [laughter] [laughter] they're like helping people things and those don't make usually any money 

97.19 98.38 B: yeah 

99.80 100.92 B: yeah 

100.33 105.16 A: [mn] um if i if money was no object and i didn't have to make money 

105.11 118.54 A: then i would i would do something to help people find out what their dr- like this i'd help people find out what their dreams are and help them start off into what direction they should you know they wanna go 

118.19 119.31 B: yeah 

118.73 122.30 A: i i keep thinking if people were in the right kind of work then 

122.38 128.93 A: service would be better and you know everything 'cause everybody would be doing what they're supposed to be doing you know [laughter] 

127.32 129.44 B: right right 

129.74 136.66 B: unfortunately is money is usually the only issue that people care about you know at least off the top anyway 

129.79 130.96 A: (( so [mn] )) 

136.50 137.94 A: right that's true 

138.05 146.75 B: or at least or either that or job security i don't know my husband and i have been talking about that and when we got married he took the first job he was offered because 

146.86 155.08 B: you know he felt kinda desperate and um and now he's staying there even though he's having a hard time there just 'cause he doesn't wanna 

155.35 157.59 B: kind of take chances you know 

157.28 161.31 A: yeah it it's it's hard when you espe- especially when you have a family 

160.91 162.12 B: yeah 

161.51 163.68 A: [laughter] it 

162.27 168.31 B: you don't feel like uh you know sacrificing or just take risk you know taking risks i guess 

168.44 177.70 A: well yeah but it still doesn't hurt to start at least checking out other options that you don't have to move on 'em you know what i mean 'cause i know my husband was um 

168.77 169.33 B: (( [sigh] )) 

175.33 176.64 B: (( i know )) 

177.64 191.08 A: um he was getting close to fifty and he was going no one is gonna want me this this old you know [mn] yeah he was like forty eight or something and and you know he got a job at boeing 

183.54 184.64 B: [laughter] 

185.36 186.33 B: yeah 

191.00 194.42 A: and then at at forty eight or whatever 

191.30 191.98 B: oh 

194.23 206.15 A: and he got to leave this place he'd been at for twenty something years and had no [mn] you know had hardly any retirement and they hired him and he made of course more money and then he got let go at boeing 

201.88 202.82 B: oh 

206.02 213.01 A: [lipsmack] he just got let go last year and now he's doing a different type of work and he's making more than he's ever made 

207.85 208.63 B: yeah 

212.39 214.52 B: oh see you never know 

213.40 223.61 A: and so and now he's like oh i should've done this years ago you know i mean he real- it's it's always good to at least check out the options [laughter] even [mn] 

216.93 218.13 B: yeah 

221.65 222.97 B: yeah 

223.66 231.59 A: submit resumes and go for interviews and y- then you c- then you'd have a decision to make but not even trying you don't even know you know what i [laughter] mean 

230.89 231.98 B: (( uh-huh )) 

231.67 232.23 A: (( i- )) 

232.31 237.53 A: it's hard to make a change but sometimes you get your biggest raise when you change jobs you know [laughter] 

236.81 239.29 B: well one thing i thought about um 

239.32 243.93 B: i- is just something silly i don't see how it could really ever work but um 

244.01 247.63 B: it's like putting people's garage sales on line you know 

247.60 248.73 A: oh huh 

248.41 255.68 B: so they could like have their own website for each garage sale and then they could show the pictures of things i think it'd you know probably 

256.32 265.92 B: it seems like silly you know but i hate going if i need to look for something in a garage sale i hate going around i don't know if that's big up there garage sales are they big up there 

265.15 266.47 A: yeah they're big 

266.08 277.32 B: oh okay but you know you go if you're actually looking just for one particular item you have to go look through the entire newspaper or at least like you know and then go all over town 

274.33 275.34 A: i know 

276.97 280.27 A: some people think that's fun i personally hate it [mn] [mn] 

279.58 283.12 B: i wouldn't like to do it especially if you have like kids in your car you know 

282.88 291.83 A: well i know that's what my daughter was just saying you know it's like i'm not taking my kids [noise] to garage sales you'd have to take 'em out of the car seats and it's just a pain so [noise] 

290.44 300.77 B: yeah when you and you get up there and everything's junk you know or you just wanna browse but i was thinking if people could put their items online and take pictures you know then you at least 

301.42 305.52 B: you know you'd get like the people who were interested to come over and stuff but 

304.65 307.36 A: yeah i think i think that's a good idea 

308.00 309.85 B: i thought there was some kind of a 

308.95 312.06 A: i don't think it would cost that much to start that up at all 

311.59 313.24 B: yeah i think it's 

313.30 318.22 B: i don't know if i got that idea from some other place or if i just had it myself but 

318.47 328.69 B: i i've i i have a feeling that there is somebody that was at least organizing garage sales for you it was like some kind of a business for that but i don't think they've went as far as to go online to do it 

325.54 326.25 A: uh-huh 

328.92 333.61 A: well as long as you could make it simple enough for people to do it or help 'em do it or whatev- 

332.72 335.21 B: yeah i think it'd probably be too difficult 

335.27 346.13 A: yeah i just it's hard to say but that see and that's why this is hard [laughter] [laughter] even if money wasn't an object [laughter] it's like 

335.57 336.55 B: but 

338.25 339.70 B: yeah [laughter] 

343.50 344.78 B: yeah 

345.41 351.38 B: i don't know i'm never i'm not really wanting to i'm a stay at home mom and i'm not really one to uh 

351.75 353.02 B: you know wanna 

353.35 356.93 B: do all these uh start up your own things you know 

356.54 357.40 A: uh-huh 

357.02 367.41 B: they're always trying to advertise for stay at home mothers to work from home and do all these things in your house but you can't tell what what's a scam and what's not first of all 

366.56 373.94 A: i know that's one of the th- i i for a while i wanted to have a business where i could uh have art 

374.29 387.89 A: have people at home do [mn] um like o- then have a photo shop and that kind of things do art basically be um subcontractors so and they could work any time day or not so so stay at home moms could do that 

387.40 388.51 B: yeah 

387.88 394.85 A: that was one of my goals 'cause i just remember when my kids were little it's like man you wanna do something and but you want it to be 

394.71 402.95 A: you don't want somebody to call your own hours you wanna do it when you've got the time you know and just if you could just spend you know a couple of hours or something a day you know 

397.90 399.00 B: yeah 

402.14 403.60 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

403.20 417.71 A: just to keep your mind active on different things you know and it's something that's fun work 'cause i i think that's a c- i don't know i just think that it would be great to help that part of society that wants to try to make some money but also watch their kids you know 

405.32 406.67 B: (( [laughter] i know )) 

416.59 421.06 B: yeah but there's a lot out there for that but you just don't know 

421.20 425.11 B: you know if it's worth it if you're gonna get you know 

424.57 430.28 A: well my daughter just checked into something 'cause she's in that situation and there was a total scam thing 

429.68 432.22 B: yeah you don't know if they're ripping you off 

431.84 433.40 A: i know it's just [mn] 

432.71 440.78 B: well i've i've done that too you know i was uh gullible enough to pay like twenty five dollars and they sent you a book you know and that kinda thing 

440.80 449.04 B: but or you know those things that like i have looked into um [lipsmack] the mail from home or something or you sort mail or whatever 

448.87 449.71 A: right 

449.29 453.41 B: and all i think it is is just sending mail that says 

453.66 461.97 B: you know uh pay this money in and get involved in this business to make lots of money so you're just selling paper is what it is you know 

461.01 461.76 A: (( exactly )) 

462.04 467.04 B: an idea on paper and then it's never anything tangible it's just just so irritating 

466.92 470.58 A: i know and then if there is something tangible you have no way of knowing if it is 

467.08 467.75 B: (( i )) 

470.19 480.02 B: and i don't yeah and i don't know why you know if anybody can ever regulate that or get into it and just you know 'cause so many people get ripped off from that i'm sure and then 

479.10 486.32 A: they do well be be forewarned there's one g- about u._p._s. ref- refund recovery thing that's a rip off 

486.28 488.01 B: oh i haven't heard of that 

486.96 493.76 A: anything with that so my daughter is and she just got ripped of on but they did give her we did get her her money back on it but 

493.00 494.05 B: (( oh mhm )) 

493.78 507.87 A: it's you know try and help people get when things didn't get delivered by u._p._s. and anyway you somehow get your money back people have to you have to approach u._p._s. or something and but anyway it's anything having to do with u._p._s. and refunds 

507.96 509.56 A: (( [mn] forget that one )) 

508.83 511.67 B: okay [laughter] okay 

509.60 516.43 A: [laughter] [laughter] anyway whatever you were to start i guess we're supposed to find out if you thought you'd be successful at it but [laughter] 

515.75 521.92 B: [laughter] i probably would but not at this time in my life i'm i just couldn't devote myself to it you know 

521.57 525.56 A: have to wait 'til uh your child is in school at least or something 

525.05 539.82 B: well one thing i'd like to do i've i've started um sewing my i w- i've always wanted to do that and my kids are i've got a three year old and a three month old so i'm just starting learning that um one thing i've always wanted to do is just 

534.96 535.82 A: oh 

539.99 545.47 B: or or i just thought about it is if i could get good enough to like just make little kids clothes and then go to like the 

545.50 548.59 B: the little craft fairs on the weekend you know and 

548.69 555.45 B: 'cause i heard about somebody who is sewing during the week at home making a bunch of outfits and then going and selling 'em for like thirty thirty five dollars 

555.46 559.13 B: or forty dollars at those craft fairs so yeah that's a home business 

559.04 560.83 A: yeah that's great 

559.96 568.89 B: and you only have to really you know go out on the weekends and then but of course in the years down the road i think before i do that just 'cause i can't 

568.98 572.75 B: it takes me like two weeks to make one outfit you know [laughter] right now 

572.29 576.49 A: [laughter] yeah it wouldn't be cost effective right now [laughter] 

572.95 574.25 B: [laughter] 

574.74 580.96 B: no i just but once you know if i made the same thing over and over again it i could do it really fast 

580.36 584.30 A: yeah if you had your own style type of thing and you could just make it 

582.81 587.48 B: yeah and i'm just really learning i'm not exactly sure what i'm doing yet but 

587.82 592.69 B: so and plus when i've got little ones running around i have very little free time 

592.40 594.12 A: yeah no kidding [laughter] 

593.40 599.95 B: so [laughter] and i think i think it would be good if you do something that's you know different 

594.57 596.23 A: [laughter]
