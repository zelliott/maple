122.29 127.69 A: so you would have to like incorporate that into a business and stuff you would have to incorporate that into a business 

124.86 125.94 B: pardon me 

127.27 135.34 B: ah you know it the safest thing to do is incorporate only because it saves you yourself this this isn't even a corporation it's just a sole 

135.21 147.94 B: proprietorship yeah the money just goes right into the kitty savings account checking account and small business account um nothing nothing special about it but ah the hospitalization the the um

320.26 321.33 A: journalism 

323.55 326.22 A: no but ah yeah we ah 

326.50 333.85 A: we get up real early and we we write sort of daily newsletters for clients based on like what industry they're in 

333.60 334.72 B: oh you're 

334.73 338.30 B: [mn] when you say clients is this for other p- ah papers
