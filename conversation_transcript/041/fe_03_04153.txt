2.16 4.92 A: hi i'm judy from uh florida 

5.44 12.11 B: well um if i were planning to open my own business i think that i would probably do some kind of event coordination 

12.03 20.46 B: um maybe wedding planning or or event planning for a a major corporation something like that um i planned my own wedding this past summer and um 

19.58 20.57 A: oh 

20.43 27.35 B: and so i got lots of ideas for different things that i could do plus i think it's probably a pretty lucrative business opportunity 

28.49 33.81 A: i know a couple of people who do that and it is [laughter] yeah i'm in florida and um 

28.64 29.82 B: what do you think you would do 

30.97 31.89 B: really 

33.96 40.79 A: [lipsmack] yeah i have a couple of people who who do really well at that i have one that specializes in small weddings with budgets 

40.55 41.61 B: mhm 

40.99 43.23 A: and i have another one that um 

43.70 45.86 A: specializes in more formal 

46.10 50.41 A: you know higher higher priced things and um 

47.98 48.94 B: right 

51.21 53.66 A: [lipsmack] they are uh 

53.74 59.34 A: really lucrative if i was gonna start a business i would start a not for profit 

59.41 60.81 A: organization 

60.87 62.13 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

64.53 70.46 A: probably start with a business plan um the population that i would serve would would be youth 

70.54 71.43 B: right 

70.84 74.99 A: um probably in career development or um 

75.42 77.09 A: something along those lines 

77.13 78.67 B: do you work with youth now 

78.57 89.54 A: i don't work with youth youth now but i have in the past i'm a social service um administrator so i have a lot of experience with doing um grants and things like that 

84.61 85.47 B: (( oh okay )) 

88.94 89.85 B: right 

89.65 94.70 A: um and running programs and doing development so a lot of ideas 

95.27 101.31 A: on you know the structure of what that would look like and so do i plan on making a lot of money no [laughter] 

98.18 99.04 B: right 

100.48 101.83 B: [laughter] 

101.75 102.36 A: (( [laughter] )) 

102.73 111.87 B: yeah um i i work right now with high school seniors and so i can see where career planning would definitely come into play and would be helpful for them 

111.73 114.86 A: do you work in the um in the school system 

114.42 116.28 B: in the public school system yes 

115.92 118.41 A: oh you do like as a guidance counselor or 

117.91 121.23 B: an an edu- as an educator actually a twelfth grade english teacher 

121.06 122.30 A: oh really 

122.00 122.98 B: yeah 

122.67 123.74 A: wow 

123.69 125.50 B: so but i but i can definitely 

123.93 125.63 A: wow that's very interesting 

125.56 130.10 B: i can definitely see where i mean they they definitely need some kind of career planning assistance 

129.99 137.30 A: well yeah and i did some research over the internet and um there is such a huge need for that 

130.25 131.28 B: and i know 

137.58 142.51 A: career planning on a individual basis like what will they really what do they really wanna do 

138.57 139.60 B: right 

139.77 140.69 B: right 

142.61 151.51 B: right especially in the public school system i mean you you can have a few guidance counselors but to reach such a large number of students they really can't have that one on one connection 

151.37 154.83 A: exactly and so they need to do that 

152.20 156.32 B: so something like you're talking about would definitely work i think 

156.13 158.17 A: mhm mhm 

158.57 168.65 A: um my actual plan for a not for profit is to do something along with the not for profit that would um that was for a profit that would help to support the not for profit 

168.00 168.89 B: right 

168.86 174.16 A: so that we wouldn't be so dependent on the government funds which get cut and changed every year 

173.79 174.65 B: right 

174.42 180.14 A: so it's another idea um have you done any actual planning for your business 

180.04 189.24 B: um no i haven't at all i've i've been te- this is my second year of teaching so i've kinda just gone into this career and not even that's always just been something i thought would be interesting to do 

189.09 193.22 A: yeah and you just got married so you're probably adjusting to a a whole new life 

191.83 203.71 B: right yeah and i i like to i like to do one project and complete it and then go on to the next one i i advise our school year book and so i'm i'm kinda getting that creative outlet in that way 

193.39 194.40 A: yeah 

198.66 199.54 A: mhm 

200.64 201.43 A: uh-huh 

203.65 204.94 A: oh good 

204.31 212.46 B: by doing that yeah so it's kinda the same thing you plan something for a while it happens everybody looks at it they say great and then they go on [laughter] 

205.71 206.67 A: good 

211.57 217.45 A: that's right that's right i am right now planning a reunion for a decade 

212.54 215.03 B: yeah so it's kinda the same idea 

217.36 218.58 B: oh really 

217.48 221.19 A: of high sch- a a decade worth of high school students 

220.70 221.65 B: mhm 

221.22 226.20 A: um who hung out at a particular area of the town where i grew up in 

226.34 235.23 A: [lipsmack] um our our high school had like three thousand people in it but there's probably like two hundred people and i'm coordinating this from here to virginia 

234.95 236.08 B: mhm 

235.46 238.44 A: and it's my first experience with planning something 

238.47 242.67 A: and it has really been interesting to watch that process unfold 

243.00 244.31 A: and i find 

244.71 254.69 A: it really e- everything when you're planning events it kinda has a p- a life of its own that you can just kinda guide but there are so many things that you have no control over 

249.40 250.23 B: right 

254.14 255.56 B: right yeah 

254.88 255.82 A: you know 

255.89 258.52 A: like if the flowers don't come into the florist 

258.30 261.81 B: or or if it rains as it did on my wedding [laughter] 

260.55 262.56 A: oh did you plan it outside 

262.17 272.43 B: it yes it was an outside wedding and it it rained it was actually flooding here the week before [laughter] so it was it was a big change at the very last minute but um 

267.78 269.30 A: oh my gosh 

271.79 276.28 A: so how did you feel like you came through that did it nerve wrack you or were you good with that 

276.02 290.58 B: um it was it was pretty nerve wracking and actually but it ended up the the very day it stopped raining just in time to have the ceremony outside we weren't able to decorate anything out there but it it worked out i mean and and it turned out really nice and everybody liked it and it i mean it wasn't 

290.59 294.96 B: it kind of was easier not to have to decorate all the things outside that we'd been planning on doing 

295.04 296.09 A: right 

295.15 295.90 B: so 

296.50 298.67 B: so it kinda worked out for the best i guess 

298.48 299.75 A: oh well good 

299.78 300.36 B: (( yeah )) 

300.80 309.24 A: well i actually have um a whole business plan almost developed for my not for profit although i expect it's probably gonna be about a year 

306.61 307.52 B: mhm 

309.26 310.92 A: before i actually 

311.00 313.64 A: um get serious about implementing it 

315.78 318.13 B: wh- when did you start thinking about it 

318.22 320.50 A: um almost four years ago 

320.76 322.24 A: i was in a meeting 

322.29 325.29 A: and all the youth programs got cut um 

325.48 329.56 A: by about five hundred thousand dollars for the summer programs in my county 

329.64 333.75 A: and i thought you know and i was working for an agency that had a um 

334.53 341.12 A: a a fundraising well actually another a division that was for profit that 

341.31 348.67 A: uh manufactured um computer parts and was solely run by disabled people and they got a lot of their funds for their 

349.67 353.17 A: program out of out of the computer sales 

353.38 360.55 A: and i thought well why can't we do something like that with the youth instead of having the programs cut you know the funds you know do something that's 

358.92 359.91 B: (( mhm right )) 

361.20 363.07 A: you know you can apply that 

363.10 364.73 A: that kind of um 

365.56 367.29 A: strategy to any 

367.35 369.80 A: any not for profit that you wanted to 

369.32 370.32 B: right 

370.02 372.61 A: so that you're not so dependent um 

373.41 380.00 A: [lipsmack] and that's when i kinda started thinking about it and then the following year i ran two youth two summer youth programs 

382.42 395.33 A: in the city of saint pete where people uh or the kids we've developed internships for the kids and we did like a hundred and fifty placement of kids in summer jobs and it was really gratifying and i thought you know 

393.33 394.72 B: (( right i bet it was )) 

395.69 397.27 A: youth is my thing 

398.15 405.28 A: i've got to work with the youth because if you get them directed in high school on what they wanna do for their career you've got it made 

399.57 400.47 B: yeah 

405.34 407.76 B: yeah they'll be much more productive in the long run 

407.97 417.49 A: and they really don't wanna hear or take advice or have their parents at that age take them through the exploration of you know they they're trying to separate from their parents 

416.95 417.89 B: right 

417.53 420.90 A: and become more independent so that's when i 

420.91 429.88 A: i started thinking about it and then i started really deciding that you know youth was something that i really wanted to do so it was kind of a process that unfolded itself and 

429.96 433.26 A: the education i got from actually running the programs 

433.33 438.41 A: solidified the whole idea for me you know in terms of this is something i really wanna do 

438.57 442.50 B: so you have an idea in mind of of which organizations you wanna work with 

442.63 443.54 A: mhm 

444.21 454.29 A: [sigh] yeah well i wanna start the organization that will actually do that of course there's there's i've already started to collaborate in concept with a lot of the different um 

452.40 453.70 B: mhm 

454.39 460.84 A: with the school system and a couple of different agencies in town here that um specialize in teenagers 

460.93 463.99 A: i have a couple of at at youth at youth 

464.73 467.40 A: at risk youth agencies 

466.81 467.77 B: (( right [noise] )) 

467.42 474.31 A: um [lipsmack] one of 'em has a lot of safe houses and some programs for juvenile delinquents and things like that 

474.43 481.62 A: um the other one is actually um gets their funds from uh taxes that are paid into the county 

481.19 482.31 B: mhm 

481.69 485.74 A: and they distribute a lot of funds to different programs and they're very interested in hearing 

485.88 487.38 A: our idea so 

487.47 488.69 A: hopefully 

490.04 491.87 A: hopefully it will take off 

491.54 493.82 B: yeah it sounds like it's a pretty exciting idea 

493.79 494.74 A: yeah 

495.46 497.25 A: so i'm doing all the talking 

497.36 498.52 B: [laughter] 

497.56 499.66 A: do you see yourself um 

500.15 501.16 A: um 

501.77 511.67 A: tell me about your vision for your your pl- being a planning coordinator did you wanna do that from your home and kind of um contract your business out 

511.20 514.99 B: i think so i think so i um when i was in college 

513.84 515.63 A: or do you wanna have a shop 

515.39 523.80 B: yeah when i was in college i did um a some temporary work and actually one time i ended up working with a a planning agency out of san francisco 

523.77 524.59 A: uh-huh 

523.77 536.11 B: um their name was viv davis and what they would do is they traveled around all over the country and did different conferences like um like a computer like they did a computer conference here in austin 

532.70 533.48 A: uh-huh 

536.09 536.95 A: uh-huh 

536.20 545.11 B: and so um they would just set everything up for the conference get you know all the paraphernalia like the tee shirts and the bags and the 

545.10 552.58 B: and all the and everything like that and take care of all that those things and then just come and have the conference and then be done 

547.63 548.53 A: mhm 

552.63 553.50 A: uh-huh 

552.94 556.68 B: and then you kinda just you know i kinda see that kind of idea 

556.71 557.89 A: oh cool 

556.74 567.88 B: um especially working especially if i didn't just do weddings actually doing events because there are so many big corporations in this area especially computer manufacturers that have company 

565.40 566.26 A: mhm 

567.98 571.12 B: c- company programs or company um 

571.45 573.32 A: trainings conferences 

572.71 576.10 B: right things like that that they that they do on 

574.12 577.62 A: yeah that there's really big money in that 

577.43 588.75 B: yeah i think so i mean um samsung is in this area and i worked there right out of high school um for a summer internship and we were constantly having events that we had to plan 

583.45 584.35 A: uh-huh 

585.35 586.15 A: uh-huh 

588.66 596.01 B: um for new recruits or you know just to try to get people to come into the company and just see what we were doing so 

595.50 596.39 A: uh-huh 

596.17 599.38 B: i think there's definitely a possibility for that 

599.30 599.90 A: absol-
