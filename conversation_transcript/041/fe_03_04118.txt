189.50 190.37 A: yeah 

191.31 192.89 A: oh neat 

201.01 208.13 A: so uh i have a question for you [mn] my husband used to actually provide voice talent 

207.90 208.90 B: yeah 

208.47 218.68 A: but everyone came to him to do it uh and he'd never actually went to anyone else and we were talking the other day about getting him into some different voice banks because he has 

217.70 218.97 B: oh yeah 

218.69 225.67 A: a wonderful wonderful deep like [mn] i don't know how to explain it other than it's 

224.82 226.17 B: like baritone 

226.18 227.00 B: voice 

226.40 230.91 A: like sensuous [laughter] voice [laughter] have to say because 

227.93 230.06 B: yeah [laughter] barry white voice 

230.23 233.07 B: like a barry white voice right [laughter] 

232.21 239.92 A: a very very nice voice and uh and so uh we were sort of wondering how to 

240.08 251.34 A: put his voice in these different voice banks because there's i from what i've heard just like through the internet and friends and stuff there's a lot of 'em nationwide have you done anything like that 

249.74 250.63 B: yeah 

250.70 264.92 B: i have never done any voiceover work however i do know people who do it and [sigh] bas- yeah basically they put together a a demo tape um so they go to somewhere and record a demo tape and usually they have a collection of voices that they do 

255.25 256.11 A: oh you do 

264.90 266.24 B: so um 

265.06 265.74 A: hm 

266.00 280.48 B: so they'll they'll have their little characters they'll have maybe like four or five characters down the voices that they could do like the the the typical like businessman or the you know or the insecure kinda college guy or you know have the the 

271.37 272.20 A: uh-huh 

280.31 288.62 B: stereotypical voices down and they'll get it on a tape and i'm not i know that there are agents out here who handle that and i'm sure there are in springfield too 

288.58 295.97 A: huh i don't know it we're pretty well set up with different contacts here in springfield but no one that does the uh 

295.96 310.69 A: the voice work there is don ross productions here um and he does a lot of stuff for like disney and the discovery channel and things like that but uh he is a really busy guy and it's almost impossible to even get a hold of him [laughter] 

309.65 311.30 B: oh yeah 

310.69 317.81 A: but my husband does already have a demo tape he had it from um in in roseburg when he was doing a lot of voice work down there so 

312.83 313.66 B: oh 

317.66 319.16 B: (( then he should send it to him )) 

317.90 327.91 A: he does have it but we've just never really uh i know that you kinda have to go out to the bigger places like l. a. where you're at right now to be able to access some of the uh 

328.23 333.14 A: some of the jobs that would actually pay decent and then it would make it even worth it to do it in the first place 

330.39 331.22 B: (( yeah i )) 

333.03 346.34 B: know out here at least it's a tight little industry so it's like the same people get all the jobs it's like um um it's who you know kind of thing like basically how you were saying how your husband has been called by people wh- that know him 

338.58 339.65 A: mhm 

341.86 342.76 A: (( ah )) 

346.31 347.07 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

346.53 358.40 B: um it's the same kind of thing here but in a like like little bigger scale it's like the people that do it they they have their contacts they've worked with the producers of the commercials and th- th- they're recommended you know 

358.98 359.85 B: so 

359.91 363.45 B: that's yeah [laughter] but [sigh] 

359.91 360.82 A: uh-huh 

361.47 362.26 A: [laughter] 

362.95 364.24 A: very interesting 

364.06 368.70 B: so yeah that's um i'm from the east coast originally i'm from buffalo new york 

368.56 369.58 A: oh 

369.41 372.95 B: so yeah so out that way [laughter] with snow and everything 

371.87 376.02 A: do you like the west coast better than the east coast or 

373.81 374.75 B: (( yeah i )) 

375.41 381.65 B: i i really do at first i didn't um it took a lot of getting used to because i'm an east coast kind of person 

381.57 392.31 B: but um but once i got out here of course winter there's no wi- winter so to speak you know [laughter] i mean there's no snow which i love growing up in buffalo that was horrible hm 

381.57 382.44 A: uh-huh 

391.84 394.51 A: yeah [laughter] 

393.29 401.65 B: yep and so um so i just basically i'm i'm used to it now it's like i've been out here ten years 

401.32 402.55 A: (( oh [sigh] )) 

401.72 404.60 B: so yeah i went to school out here and everything so 

405.27 408.35 A: well that's kind of neat my sister just moved back from new jersey 

408.38 409.70 B: oh yeah 

409.02 423.81 A: and she had a lot to lot of things to say about the east coast i think she definitely likes the west coast [laughter] better also and my best friend still lives in washington d. c. so i just heard about the recent snow storms and the weather over there 

415.10 417.30 B: yeah [laughter] 

421.28 425.19 B: [sigh] oh they got it bad [laughter] yeah 

424.89 430.40 A: yeah she didn't have much good to say about trying to find a way to work a few [laughter] times 

429.63 432.28 B: oh my goodness oh 

430.68 433.88 A: [laughter] she said it was very difficult 

433.63 436.51 B: oh my goodness [laughter] yeah 

435.50 447.17 A: and it's really interesting to think that our our government you know most of our government is in washington d. c. and i just had to wonder to myself well how are all these other people getting to work if you can't get to work [laughter] [laughter] 

445.63 446.61 B: yeah i know 

446.84 456.14 B: [laughter] well they have the probably the snow mo- snow mobiles going in front of their cars [laughter] because they're [laughter] special [laughter] 

451.95 459.34 A: exactly [laughter] or something i don't know i don't know how like the uh the subway does it or 

459.09 460.04 B: oh 

459.36 466.54 A: that sort of or i i guess not the subway but a lot of people don't a lot of people take buses there in uh on the east coast 

464.45 465.61 B: yeah 

466.05 473.64 B: yeah especially in big cities like washington i think washington and new york city people really rely on the public transportation 

473.39 474.27 A: uh-huh 

474.09 474.99 B: so 

474.41 478.05 A: so where you're at in los angeles are you in a crowded area 

477.67 492.39 B: uh no actually i live up in the hills so it's um maybe about fifteen minutes from hollywood but it's uh nestled up in the hills in like a bungalow like hanging up one of the ones you see on the the movies like hanging off the side of a cliff 

484.65 485.45 A: oh 

492.43 494.17 A: [noise] oh neat 

493.80 507.39 B: yeah there's a lot of hilly neighborhoods out here and so um it's you know we have raccoons and skunks and and um possums and deer and coyotes [laughter] so that's kinda neat [laughter] 

496.26 497.24 A: (( wow )) 

500.72 501.58 A: uh-huh
