142.51 150.95 B: it's kind of low um educational level and everything and you don't have like the fancy salons that you do like on on the east or west coast 

145.92 146.48 A: (( [noise] )) 

150.55 151.53 A: uh-huh 

151.23 153.54 B: 'cause i think i'd wanna have one of those 

153.02 155.47 A: ooh that would be cool 

153.75 154.91 B: so i'd have to imp- 

155.12 157.72 B: yeah i'd have to import people though from 

157.59 166.00 A: yeah [laughter] well they said money was no object [laughter] 

158.01 160.50 B: [laughter] outside of the state 

162.50 163.50 B: i know 

163.74 171.86 B: [laughter] you could hire like some really uh famous designer people and everything but the problem is people don't here down here don't have any money 

171.55 173.54 A: yeah 

172.33 174.55 B: so it would have to be um 

174.59 178.74 B: i don't know it would have to be reasonable you know reasonable cost 

177.89 179.78 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

179.67 182.18 B: i'm not sure how i would go about setting that up 

181.90 184.17 A: yeah [laughter] 

183.33 188.96 B: but i don't know maybe i could give 'em like free toothpaste and stuff that we get in in you know the free samples [laughter] 

188.51 194.46 A: yeah well see maybe i should take my dollar store down where you live 

194.24 202.45 B: uh-huh oh yeah you know what that is where everybody shops and all the um [lipsmack] all the mexicans when they come up here to shop at christmastime 

194.63 197.02 A: [laughter] 

202.03 203.03 A: uh-huh 

202.47 204.21 B: they hit the dollar stores 

203.68 205.33 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

204.38 206.42 B: and that's the only place they shop 

205.93 206.99 A: uh-huh 

206.67 211.81 B: so they pour a lot of money in but it's all the very very cheap places 

211.29 212.60 A: yeah 

211.96 218.20 B: so they you know they shop at the dollar places but you're right you know people don't have a lot of money nowadays 

214.15 215.56 A: mhm 

216.75 217.79 A: right 

217.96 223.99 A: because you know some of my stuff that i buy you know or get free after rebate or whatever 

223.47 224.29 B: uh-huh 

224.03 232.99 A: i'll take it to to where i work there's a lot of people where i work and just some of my closest friends you know i'll either um 

233.05 242.96 A: give it to them for what i paid for it unless i got it for free and then i charge 'em a little bit you know and they're happy and i'm happy 

235.54 236.55 B: uh-huh 

239.73 241.18 B: yeah yeah 

242.63 243.94 B: right right 

243.23 245.30 A: and [laughter] 

244.54 247.55 B: no that's okay you know a dollar store would be kinda cool 

247.31 248.98 A: uh-huh well 

247.82 249.00 B: it would really be 

249.05 258.80 A: we've had ones kind of around town but never really close to where i live and just recently one opened close to where i live and 

256.14 256.98 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

258.93 262.58 A: i don't go in there a lot but uh 

263.10 264.89 A: i go in there [laughter] 

264.23 276.35 B: yeah you know we have 'em almost [noise] down here it's like on on almost every block you have another dollar store yeah because uh the average income down here for a um a family of four is like seventeen thousand 

268.81 270.83 A: oh really 

275.79 277.15 A: ooh 

276.41 281.44 B: um it's just it's just a really poor part of the country so um 

279.06 280.30 A: (( yeah )) 

281.47 286.60 B: these people don't make anything and so you know walmart makes money k. mart makes money 

286.17 287.24 A: uh-huh 

286.65 292.67 B: but the places that really get get stripped especially at like holidays and uh [lipsmack] 

292.68 302.73 B: yeah holidays are [mn] are the dollar stores and everybody's just in there you know but there are some that charge more than a dol- you know they charge more than they should 

295.02 296.34 A: (( [noise] uh-huh yeah )) 

296.81 297.81 A: uh-huh 

301.84 316.27 A: [lipsmack] yeah i remember there was used to be a store called the eighty eight cent store when i was growing up and it started out everything was eighty eight cents and then all of a sudden it got to be three and four and five [laughter] cents 

303.01 304.07 B: if they 

308.36 309.21 B: uh-huh 

315.12 317.67 B: yeah yeah fifteen dollars and [laughter] 

317.13 323.05 A: and fifteen eighty eight [laughter] yeah [laughter] 

318.68 321.81 B: yeah [laughter] everything ends in eighty eight 

322.37 330.73 B: so if you did your own you'd wanna you'd wanna do it like a dollar you know and you'd probably if you could get things really cheap and generic and off brands 

324.61 326.48 A: (( [mn] )) 

330.12 331.29 A: uh-huh 

330.78 333.60 B: you know you could [noise] really charge just a buck 

333.07 334.85 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

333.87 335.56 B: [noise] and that would be it 

334.87 336.91 A: [laughter] 

336.47 339.35 B: do you guys have a big lots out there where you live 

339.08 341.58 A: um no we don't 

341.37 349.92 B: um big lots is really neat because they um they buy name brand stuff um over socks and things like that and then they mark 'em way down 

346.50 347.31 A: (( oh )) 

349.50 354.51 A: oh i've heard people talk about 'em but i've never 

350.21 351.59 B: so you can walk in 

353.36 358.66 B: [noise] yeah they're great they're great they they buy all of the the name brand things though 

355.35 356.49 A: (( oh )) 

358.73 362.52 B: and then they mark 'em way down like seventy five percent off 

358.74 359.81 A: (( ooh )) 

362.76 368.85 B: so when you walk in you don't know what you're gonna get or what you're gonna find 'cause their inventory changes every week 

362.81 363.43 A: (( ooh )) 

365.30 367.17 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

368.08 370.69 A: ooh that sounds like my kind of store 

369.79 380.24 B: that's something i know it's great it's great but that's something you can do too you know is is buy um [noise] a lot of the name brand items and just mark 'em down 

371.20 372.71 A: [laughter] 

374.81 375.92 A: uh-huh 

379.92 381.01 A: uh-huh 

380.42 385.69 B: 'cause you can get 'em [noise] cheaper from um you know those big stores that are trying to get rid of things 

384.33 397.80 A: uh-huh yeah 'cause um i know you know by the time if i do sell some things to people at work it usually ends up that they get it for cheaper than they would've in the store 

396.92 399.34 B: [noise] [noise] exactly [noise] exactly 

397.90 400.45 A: and i still make a little bit too 

400.12 405.56 B: exactly and you got it for way cheaper than [noise] you know you would have if you just went out and bought it 

405.30 413.77 A: yeah mhm some people say i don't know how you do it i don't know how you do it [laughter] this one lady 

410.34 411.86 B: [laughter] 

412.71 413.57 B: well 

413.70 428.55 A: she decided she was gonna do a rebate for the very first time a friend of mine she goes [lipsmack] well it took me an about an hour to figure it out but i figured it out [laughter] [laughter] 

422.45 425.63 B: [laughter] [noise] yeah it's not that hard you know 

426.80 429.95 B: just a form and a receipt and a you know 

428.59 433.28 A: (( i know [laughter] yeah [laughter] )) 

430.39 432.10 B: and mail it in [laughter] 

432.62 436.12 B: just the hard part is waiting you know for stuff to come back to you 

435.33 438.53 A: mhm mhm yeah 

436.18 438.81 B: that's the hard part [noise] the coupons are great too 

438.67 446.34 A: yeah oh i've always been a coupon freak i mean i just [sigh] oh [laughter] 

445.10 452.29 B: yeah well you know it would be kinda fun to do your own business but i think you'd have to work like a hundred hours a week 

451.72 462.20 A: [sigh] yeah that would be the drawback of having your own business i mean and if you didn't really feel like going to work you'd have to anyway 

460.84 469.51 B: you don't have much of a choice [laughter] yeah yeah that's the bad part until you get really big and able to support yourself and hire other people 

462.44 464.67 A: [laughter] 

468.92 470.52 A: right 

469.52 472.28 B: you're kinda stuck doing most of the work yourself 

471.96 478.06 A: yeah i feel sorry for people that have businesses and they do all the stuff themselves 

476.98 480.93 B: yeah unless you have like kids and a spouse that can help [noise] 

480.30 481.79 A: yeah 

482.31 494.88 A: well i think that leaves me out [laughter] my spouse is retired he likes to watch t._v. and [laughter] i have one daughter that's grown but 

484.52 486.13 B: oh [laughter] 

489.71 490.82 B: [noise] 

491.13 492.31 B: [laughter] 

494.90 497.40 A: she's not overly [laughter] ambitious 

497.45 502.06 B: yeah no no you'd have to and you'd have to get a lot of money too to start it up 

501.75 503.15 A: mhm 

502.39 506.02 B: but i don't know how much you know i don't know a hundred thousand or 

506.44 509.84 A: yeah i i don't know you know 

506.84 508.39 B: what would it take 

508.92 511.76 B: at least that much because you'd have to get a building 

511.58 513.03 A: yeah mm 

512.17 514.28 B: and you'd have to pay for utilities 

513.74 515.15 A: mhm 

514.43 517.88 B: and order ev- all your inventory before you even sell a thing 

517.52 519.23 A: right 

518.70 520.27 B: and all your advertising 

520.10 532.31 A: yeah i've never really considered it too seriously 'cause number one i've never had the money and number two i just hear of so many small businesses failing 

520.79 522.08 B: [laughter] and then 

531.90 535.64 B: yeah like eighty percent or so go out of business the first year [noise] 

533.77 535.30 A: yeah 

535.39 546.28 A: and i just go oh that would be me i'm sitting down here at my dollar store waiting for a customer and none come [laughter] [laughter] yeah 

541.89 555.74 B: [laughter] nobody shows up and i think i think it depends on where you live too if you have more um [lipsmack] higher income or middle income or it just depends on where people like to shop and how much money they have 

555.07 558.37 A: yeah that is true that is true 

556.85 557.64 B: (( 'cause if )) 

557.70 561.01 B: yeah i mean like down here oh my gosh you could make a killing 

561.05 562.21 A: mhm 

561.22 566.55 B: 'cause nobody has any money [laughter] so you know the dollar store is where everybody goes but [noise] 

562.66 564.09 A: right 

565.96 567.41 A: yeah 

566.60 572.30 B: if you live in a higher income place people might not be interested or think that all you carry is cheap junk 

572.03 576.17 A: yeah i know there would be some people like that because 

575.03 576.00 B: uh-huh 

576.19 581.96 A: we're not a real rich community and they say the economy is bad but 

581.99 587.30 A: people still seem to spend the money somehow and 

588.27 589.35 A: so 

590.09 599.95 A: [lipsmack] i mean i there's people that do like the dollar store but i think there are some people too that say oh yeah they just got a bunch of junk [laughter] 

597.60 599.89 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah yeah yeah ))
