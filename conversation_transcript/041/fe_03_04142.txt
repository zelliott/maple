0.07 1.79 B: hi my name is al 

1.84 3.68 A: hello i'm leah 

3.50 4.55 B: hi leah 

4.30 5.24 A: hi 

5.81 6.53 A: (( uh )) 

6.63 8.92 B: um what kind of business would you like to open 

8.69 10.26 A: oh gosh um 

10.06 11.52 B: (( or do you want me to go first )) 

11.55 12.90 A: [laughter] 

13.18 14.13 A: well 

14.61 23.92 A: i was thinking of what was with just talking about opening a business but then when they said the [sigh] if money wasn't invol- a an issue 

24.14 27.30 A: you know my dream has always been to to make um 

27.82 33.54 A: a place where old people and young kids can be together 

34.73 35.62 A: um 

36.34 38.56 A: and be taken care of i 

38.68 47.00 B: that sounds rather nice you mean like a place where like the kids could keep the elderly entertained and at the same time you know kind of just have company young company 

44.87 49.07 A: yeah yeah that yeah they both hang out together 

49.68 51.97 A: um someone takes care of both of 'em 

53.33 60.02 B: that sounds that sounds like a wonderful idea actually because that way you know the it's the aged versus the innocent 

59.84 61.77 A: right right 

60.76 65.63 B: and you know as you age you get you become more innocent so they probably would be gr- very compatible 

65.35 69.07 A: yeah i don't think people should be so separated 

69.78 77.74 B: yeah i don't believe in a segregation either of it but but i think that's a great idea actually for a business that would that hasn't you know doesn't have to do with money 

74.94 75.87 A: uh-huh 

77.58 79.59 A: yeah 

78.56 80.52 B: that that that sounds like a great thing 

80.46 85.70 A: yeah that was but um actually right now i've been i've been um 

86.48 91.48 A: trying to to find mystery shopping jobs have you heard of mystery shopping 

91.57 95.61 B: i have never heard of mystery shopping jobs where you are a mystery shopper 

93.14 94.47 A: (( oh [sigh] )) 

95.48 98.44 A: well uh-huh where you you're kind of like an undercover 

98.47 102.72 A: shopper you go to a store and observe um 

103.08 107.67 A: the service and how clean it is and how the products are displayed and then 

107.71 111.08 A: then you send in an evaluation to the company afterwards 

111.01 119.16 B: oh i see i think i read i read one in um i think the new not the new york times the los angeles times where they were running ads for mystery shoppers now i know what you're talking about 

116.17 118.33 A: (( oh yeah )) 

118.59 124.56 A: oh yeah yeah so that's how i actually found this um study 

125.03 127.40 A: going through the online 

127.70 128.76 A: (( websites )) 

129.29 137.40 B: really i found it i was referred to by a friend 'cause they were doing the study and i thought it was interesting because it had to do with linguistics so i was like okay i'll give it a go 

129.82 131.67 A: yeah 

132.20 132.83 A: (( oh )) 

132.97 135.34 A: (( yes )) 

135.98 136.80 A: uh-huh 

137.47 139.34 A: do you know how they found out about it 

139.44 143.01 B: um i have no idea how she found out probably through the paper as well 

142.74 143.61 A: uh-huh 

144.12 145.40 A: that's interesting 

145.61 148.06 A: so so what business would you start 

147.76 151.14 B: yeah well i see i'm i'm a licensed pharmacy technician 

150.79 151.66 A: uh-huh 

151.29 157.06 B: and i would honestly if it had nothing to do with the money i would love to do something in the healthcare like pharmacy field 

157.57 159.45 A: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

158.14 165.67 B: and open the business and you know maybe step up to a pharmacist or just maybe work as a pharmacy technician but have it you know be my company 

165.41 166.28 A: uh-huh 

166.38 172.39 B: and you know maybe lower the rates a little bit so that the elderly can maybe pay for their own you know the medications 

166.52 167.35 A: (( well that )) 

171.81 174.85 A: oh yes i have 

173.13 179.56 B: you know certain things i thought that would be a great i think organisation to start or a great m- 

178.74 180.26 A: i agree with you 

179.89 186.98 B: yeah well you know because s- sometimes it's just medicare not medicare to name it but certain companies don't cover enough 

180.58 181.54 A: yeah i 

186.88 188.21 A: right 

187.48 192.67 B: so maybe i could you know open an organisation or i mean a a place that would be able to 

192.75 195.52 B: accommodate them maybe in payment plans or something 

195.42 198.30 A: yeah 'cause i need to take um 

198.86 202.13 A: n- a hundred dollars' worth of medicine every month 

202.32 203.55 B: oh really 

202.32 209.47 A: and yeah and it's so hard i was thinking about trying canada to see if i could get them cheaper 

210.14 213.63 B: well it's worth a shot i mean i you know i can't say anything legally [laughter] 

210.56 211.31 A: (( but )) 

213.21 214.08 A: [laughter] 

214.96 220.70 A: but um your idea where it would be more accessible would be wonderful 

220.05 230.38 B: yeah it i mean it would be it would be kind of a low cost type of deal because you really would i don't think i'd be making much profit off of it i think it would just be helping people in general 

228.71 229.47 A: uh-huh 

230.11 232.10 A: yeah yeah 

230.84 234.38 B: just enough to stay afloat to keep the pharmacy open i think would be suffice 

234.06 234.91 A: uh-huh 

236.48 240.54 B: so that's kind of what i would what i would aim to right now 

240.29 241.14 A: uh-huh 

242.13 245.01 A: have you done any of these calls before 

244.68 247.03 B: i have never done one of these before this is my first time 

246.97 249.05 A: oh yeah this is my first one 

249.31 252.54 A: so i'm wondering how we know when the ten minutes is up 

251.93 259.24 B: oh they'll probably like beep in or something like that we basically just keep talking about like you know i guess you know organizations or jobs that we would like to start 

253.25 254.79 A: yeah they'll tell 

256.45 258.45 A: (( us yes mm )) 

259.32 262.24 A: yeah we need to talk about the topic for eight minutes 

261.98 271.76 B: mm [lipsmack] well you know on the on the the idea you that you had it sounds more appealing in the sense that kids entertain 

272.05 275.21 B: um the elderly a lot more than we give them credit for 

273.34 274.18 A: uh-huh 

275.01 276.35 A: right 

275.92 281.98 B: and i think putting them together might just do be the trick to kel- help them keep a keep the elderly alive 

281.89 284.42 A: yes 'cause they get so depressed 

284.51 291.25 B: yeah and it would give them energy people to play cards with you know the kids will energize the the the elderly become energized just by watching 

290.47 292.30 A: yeah yeah um 

292.53 293.71 A: and the young 

293.94 295.86 A: really do enjoy the old 

296.36 297.46 B: (( yeah they do )) 

296.40 299.40 A: and they yeah 

298.16 306.49 B: so it'd be a mutual kind of consensual form of energy really a big ball of energy full of of of love really if you think about it 

305.82 308.25 A: yeah yeah um i'm wondering 

308.52 310.96 A: why there isn't that already 

311.29 311.99 A: (( but )) 

312.51 324.10 B: you know a lot of people keep like you know most things a lot of people keep people separated for whatever reasons and i think it probably just hasn't come up with i mean hasn't come across yet the idea of putting them together 

318.20 319.20 A: yeah 

321.31 322.25 A: yeah 

324.22 325.45 A: right 

325.64 330.02 B: but you know if if there was a place that we would need that it would be there 

329.75 330.74 A: (( uh-huh )) 

330.45 336.34 B: it would be you know a place for where the elderly and the young could be together you know even if it was like um 

336.89 343.32 B: not a convalescent home but maybe a mixture like maybe a school and a convalescent home that are are joined uh to each other 

343.01 346.63 A: yeah that was what what i was just thinking yeah and that 

345.71 357.53 B: and then that'd be great because then the kids would go to class and then after class they could you know and the and the elderly could walk around and and watch children play during p. e. or whatever and then afterwards maybe the kids can come over to that convalescent home and keep the 

351.51 352.42 A: uh-huh 

357.59 360.62 B: elderly entertained or you know talk to them for a little while 

358.96 359.94 A: uh-huh 

360.12 361.68 A: and vice versa 

361.45 362.39 B: yeah 

362.15 363.62 A: until the parents are 

363.67 365.11 A: done with work 

365.12 368.19 B: (( yeah i think that'd be honestly i think that'd be a great idea )) 

367.97 370.01 A: yeah 

370.29 376.83 B: the only other thing the other other dream job i think i would like or the dream organization i would like to open would be [sigh] 

371.20 371.76 A: (( [mn] )) 

377.01 382.21 B: some sort of youth center that went back to the basics of english 

382.96 383.67 A: oh 

383.07 384.75 B: i know that sounds really odd 

384.45 385.26 A: uh-huh 

385.26 393.63 B: but with all the slang that we use nowadays i would really just like a non profit organization [laughter] where i could just teach kids how to speak english 

393.57 394.34 A: (( [noise] )) 

394.78 396.88 A: that would be wonderful 

396.25 404.76 B: you know like regular english not you you know i don't mind certain slang words but it it's coming to the point where some of the kids can't even read at a certain level 

400.30 401.42 A: (( [noise] )) 

404.61 405.66 A: (( yes )) 

405.26 407.99 B: shakespeare to them is a completely far gone 

408.44 410.95 A: absolutely yeah 

410.18 418.85 B: so i would love to that would be another place i would love to to actually you know to open and do i mean i wouldn't make gain any money out of it it would be just for the kids themselves 

415.28 416.26 A: mhm 

418.84 420.17 A: right 

420.58 423.43 B: so that's that's those are my two ideas that's what i would like to do 

422.89 423.85 A: uh-huh 

424.18 431.33 A: well the old people know how to speak english better than the young people [laughter] they could work on that together 

431.39 438.43 B: you know honestly that'd be a great idea 'cause it would match perfectly that's exactly we both uh both were heading towards the same goal in a way 

438.45 439.35 A: uh-huh 

440.50 444.10 B: i wonder if we if we actually opened that organization it could work out that way 

445.10 446.57 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

445.89 450.97 B: maybe like reading time or something you know at you know at five p._m. you know what i mean 

450.57 452.77 A: oh yeah 

451.29 457.41 B: where the elderly read like a sonnet or something not too literat- not too high for the s- for the kids' level 

456.78 457.64 A: uh-huh 

457.45 460.74 B: but just enough for the kids to maybe pick up a couple of words they don't know 

462.22 463.35 A: (( [noise] yes )) 

462.40 465.85 B: you know and maybe also learn how to spell applicable 

465.88 467.38 B: something like that 

466.85 467.86 A: (( spell what )) 

467.90 469.00 B: applicable 

469.19 470.05 A: applic- 

469.23 470.88 B: like it's applicable 

470.64 472.66 A: oh applic- [laughter] applicable 

472.46 473.55 B: yeah 

473.23 483.18 A: yeah i've been noticing i i've been on the computer a lot more lately and uh the words are just misspelled so much um i think 

483.19 492.05 A: p- people are just getting used to it and they don't even notice you know like too it should be too t. o. o. when it's just t. o. 

491.73 494.72 B: yeah i've noticed that too or they put like the 

494.79 502.48 B: the little hyphenated whatever slot happy face and without putting a period i'm like end your sentence before you do that please 

497.76 498.63 A: uh-huh 

502.04 503.92 A: yes [laughter] 

503.25 508.71 B: i understand that you know you wanna smile at me but you know that's just uh what i would like to do i really would like to 

508.74 515.22 B: open some sort of center that was just dedicated to just bringing kids up to their level where they should be 

514.04 515.50 A: (( yes uh-huh )) 

515.34 519.01 B: as opposed to 'cause nowadays running across this thing where 

519.11 524.48 B: we're being so careful with our children's mental status as opposed to where they should be 

524.62 525.58 A: mhm 

524.90 529.02 B: that we're kind of neglecting their actual needs to survive in reality 

529.44 538.05 B: we've buffered them so much in so many ways you know what i mean like we've taken away certain shakespeare and all books and other books that are really good literature wise 

529.57 531.26 A: (( that's )) 

532.08 533.35 A: that's right 

537.39 538.89 A: mhm 

538.13 548.44 B: words that they actually may need in time and we've tak- and we've kind of put it down to a slower level so that the slow kids don't so the slow kids don't feel left out basically 

548.37 549.69 A: right um 

550.05 552.52 A: and then the real smart kids are just 

552.89 556.33 B: they're basically they're they're i hate to use the word but dummified 

553.05 553.99 A: just being 

554.24 555.36 A: let down 

555.94 557.54 A: yeah right 

556.91 561.47 B: and i've you know i would love to open a a a place a non profit organization 

561.43 562.08 A: (( uh-huh )) 

561.44 572.19 B: that dealt with individual like if you're a slower kid fine i can work with you but you know keep them in where they are and just progress them slowly that would be great i think a great organization to do 

572.49 575.55 A: i think so too yeah 

574.19 578.65 B: and with the elderly that might be a great way to do it because they could volunteer maybe 

578.75 579.99 A: mhm 

579.23 583.01 B: and that could be part of their job like maybe the reading time during the class 

583.23 586.77 B: if we opened like if the organization was to open side by side 

583.73 585.71 A: yeah 

586.82 588.92 A: yeah i can just picture it [mn] 

589.73 598.03 B: you know the elderly you know teach different levels that they're comfortable with you know a lot of i'm sure a lot of elderly people have got graduated from high school and college and 

589.79 591.06 A: (( it would )) 

593.83 595.10 A: mhm 

596.87 599.95 A: and they tell their stories about history
