267.33 281.07 B: oh my goodness well if you ever go out there on the strip and if you wanna good idea to make and run a business or just how the scenes are you should just go and go down the clubs over there mandalay bay the rum jungle it is happening it 

268.44 269.27 A: (( know )) 

280.76 281.95 A: (( as i said all )) 

281.30 295.65 B: is really happening and you just everything is just if you want something modernized if you want the best of the best if you wanted something you know just kinda like how far out there or just something kinda you know if you just want something eye catching 

291.92 292.90 A: (( of those )) 

295.63 302.20 B: you should check it out it's really really nice just check out some of the clubs out on the scene for what they're offering because 

301.22 303.29 A: (( kind of things is uh )) 

303.28 304.53 B: yeah 

303.48 305.99 A: (( is what you do is with great publicity )) 

305.09 306.18 B: mhm 

306.32 307.86 B: it is really it's 

306.48 309.77 A: (( word of mouth you get it out there you get )) 

309.05 323.46 B: it's really nice out there you just get you know you have to check it out if you wanted to open up a club and if you just had some ideas i mean just something to bounce off or something and i think it's a cool place i mean i think it's real cool and you know as i said i've been in the cosmetic industry for 

323.31 337.96 B: some time so i kinda know what's out there what people want and i have a wholesale licence so i'm almost there so you know if i ever immediate cash and the cash flow was was just happening then i would just set up shop in melrose which is a prime location 

337.91 345.87 B: um everything tr- all the trends are out there everything's happening and you always wanna you know be in an area that it's eye catching 

346.15 358.85 B: [noise] and you know that always you know you know seeing those scenes and know what's happening and since l._a.'s one of those places that you can always you know have you know places that are pretty happening and you know things are just always you know 

358.75 366.52 B: going on over there i think you know you know you get a little bit of ideas here and then you kinda mix it into your own you know flavor and you see what happens 

365.90 366.78 A: (( your )) 

367.09 375.99 B: something in that's you know i mean you're you're your own boss you don't give account to nobody and you know you come and go as you please 

376.17 378.32 B: and you set your own rules 

378.37 388.63 B: which i think is great because no one can tell you what to do you're running your business and you're the one have to give your own account so i think that's a personal freedom of having your own business 

388.99 399.41 B: yeah you know i mean you know is it you have people looking up to you so you set the standards you set the rules and you set up all the things you like having set up so that kinda give you a personal freedom 

399.53 403.98 B: and you know personal way to you know do what you like to do 

404.26 414.93 B: and you know how to you know how things were done before and you like to change things around so i think that's always a better way of think how can things be done better if you know if you wanna have something that's done you do it yourself 

415.51 417.64 B: [noise] so i think that's always a great idea 

417.51 418.69 A: (( promoters )) 

418.09 419.62 B: so how 'bout yourself 

419.70 430.42 B: what you uh what you uh what if you had a perfect world and everything was right with you and the club and everything what would you do with it i mean you know spend invest what would you [noise] 

430.40 435.14 A: (( you get people [noise] [noise] )) 

432.94 434.11 B: mhm 

435.32 438.03 A: (( [noise] )) 

438.07 443.76 B: that's cool or you can always if one club is always working out good you can always franchise and have another one 

444.15 447.69 B: be entrepreneur have them you know from state to state 

447.97 452.30 B: one place in vegas and new york london you know 

452.59 462.47 B: have one out in korea you know what i mean all sorts of places i mean you have them all over the place once you get established you be by word of mouth you'll be the hottest place in town so 

455.38 457.09 A: (( [noise] )) 

462.36 467.78 B: that's another thing you could always think of is when you do businesses you get one place established 

467.81 471.07 B: you go out and you do something else and it's okay you know 

470.94 473.56 B: as long as i can always be entrepreneurial then you know 

473.38 486.79 B: you can always don't put your eggs in one basket you can always have a and spend that's how you make your big money [sigh] and that's how you can set your you know you sh- you can set your plan up for the long run instead of just setting it up for one place 

478.07 479.03 A: (( [noise] )) 

486.73 490.25 B: 'cause all these things can always happen even though you're in a great location 

490.46 493.89 B: you'll never be out of business because las vegas is vegas you know 

494.51 496.82 B: so you know that's always gonna be a good place 

496.95 498.53 B: it's always gonna be happening 

499.25 510.23 B: so that's pretty much it and as far as my business i would like to have in a perfect world is that or have another business running as you know 

510.15 514.41 B: as a um you know home c- a home service business of 

514.29 526.46 B: people getting ready for special events weddings or things like that i like to have somebody you know come over to the house and they'll do all the personal touches they can they can't make it to the salon the salon comes to you 

526.49 538.55 B: and a personal touch so people don't have to run to the salon do everything else they can set that up have your own service so you could you know just be on call so you can give the best service without spending a whole ton of money 

538.83 548.66 B: you know the same thing you do in the salon you could do it at home and you get the best service which i think will be kinda great because people always are running out of time you know not 

549.46 552.50 B: (( you know not )) 

553.80 554.83 B: (( having )) 

555.52 556.31 B: (( enough )) 

556.54 557.87 B: (( time of doing )) 

559.01 560.35 B: (( you know you know )) 

560.36 562.59 B: (( the necessities to get ready for )) 

562.83 564.48 B: (( a big party or )) 

564.80 566.19 B: (( wedding or )) 

566.30 569.11 B: (( things like that and you )) 

569.72 570.65 B: (( know )) 

572.50 574.12 B: (( save time )) 

574.31 579.30 B: (( and money do it at home to talk about your place )) 

579.36 581.45 B: or you know what i like to do and you know 

581.54 596.00 B: you you get it up and that's how you get popular and that's how you get your publicist to help people start going to places and if you get advertisements or even celebrities going out there you even get bigger places because people like what you do people take care of you 

594.75 595.61 A: (( yeah )) 

595.87 596.85 A: yeah 

596.40 599.89 B: so you know i mean that's how that's how it works out you take
