31.03 32.30 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

31.59 36.14 A: so i would definitely have my children attend

52.84 53.43 B: (( [laughter] )) 

56.22 65.51 B: yes i think that sounds good i don't have children but everybody that i know who does have children is always complaining about how expensive childcare is so 

58.39 59.60 A: yeah 

64.65 66.53 A: yeah it is 

65.85 70.17 B: if you could have affordable good reliable [noise] nice childcare

81.58 82.96 A: (( i )) 

82.75 90.24 B: because i like to be pampered and i think everybody likes to be pampered and so i think it'd be nice because i think people are really truly happy

90.58 93.39 B: when they're getting a massage or a facial or 

93.73 98.40 B: doing something that's really good for themselves and [sigh] it's something that i think 

98.93 101.51 B: i don't know i've had a a i've had a few friends who 

101.89 106.34 B: i've had several friends who are massage therapists and facialists and so

109.86 111.71 A: yeah 

110.29 113.85 B: and it definitely depends on the area of the country that they live in 

114.19 117.82 B: and but you know here in los angeles which is where i live 

117.85 120.05 B: there are a lot of spas and so 

120.22 126.67 B: i think it'd be a a good thing to open i definitely think that there aren't too many spas [laughter] in the world 

122.48 123.52 A: (( i ag- )) 

125.87 128.78 A: well i agree i live in north dakota

134.74 135.96 B: do you ever go 

135.71 145.05 A: i've gone i just went on friday actually [laughter] so yeah i definitely agree that would be an awesome business to open and i think it would be fun and enjoyable

153.31 160.34 A: right now i'm a fulltime i do insurance like claims processing and that kind of stuff for medical insurance 

160.11 163.40 B: and do you feel like that would set you up as for it to be a good business arm 

163.67 170.97 A: um i do it gives me a ton of customer you know like support for customers and as far as 

170.98 178.61 A: um customer service skills and all of that kind of stuff plus you deal with all types of people grouchy people happy people 

178.60 190.35 A: all of that stuff and plus you deal with the money aspect of things on you know another level of different than daycare but yet you see how much money people are spending just in medical expenses every month and [cough] 

189.75 191.03 B: mhm oh definitely 

191.11 193.03 B: so you do medical insurance

197.81 198.67 B: so 

198.81 201.71 A: i that would definitely help 

199.05 203.36 B: i think that that could translate but i am at work right now so it doesn't 

203.76 207.59 B: it doesn't um translate quite over perfectly over to my 

208.50 212.93 B: [sigh] my dedication to my job since i am doing this while i'm at work [laughter] 

212.41 215.88 A: oh [laughter] 

214.40 216.76 B: which is not the best thing to do but 

216.33 222.41 A: well but i think advertising would definitely help you to improve a small business 

221.78 223.63 B: yeah definitely 

222.43 228.73 A: or just start one i did advertising for many years and loved it yeah 

223.81 224.87 B: i feel like 

226.13 227.25 B: oh really 

227.81 229.92 B: i like doing what i do but 

231.08 232.44 B: (( [sigh] you know mhm )) 

231.38 237.31 A: it was definitely it's an enjoyable job but it does it gives you so many opportunities to see 

237.87 240.08 A: the world for what it really is 

240.50 241.78 B: [lipsmack] it really does 

241.01 242.88 A: (( and yeah )) 

242.18 244.45 B: it's sort of a hard knocks kind of profession 

243.75 253.60 A: [mn] yeah it is and i did it like from probably a different standpoint than you do i did it for a small business i did all their advertising and marketing and all of that kind of stuff so 

251.79 253.10 B: oh wow [lipsmack] 

254.16 257.42 B: yeah i'm definitely in advertising sales and so 

258.00 259.48 B: and i do advertising 

259.80 262.81 B: i actually deal with a lot of health advertising and so 

263.17 264.12 A: oh 

263.81 267.08 B: for long term the longer term care industry which is 

267.19 272.25 B: sort of along i deal with a lot of people who are working with insurance companies a lot so 

271.66 275.46 A: yeah actually we just got a whole new long term care plan [laughter] 

274.70 275.78 B: oh wow 

275.40 281.02 A: so yeah it's amazing and it's amazing how that 

280.92 291.06 A: aspect i mean i really was gonna open a business and then we were living in nebraska and the economy was so poor that there was no chance so that's how we got back to north dakota [sigh] 

291.12 296.88 B: [sigh] mhm yeah definitely were you going to open a childcare facility oh wow 

291.87 292.97 A: and so 

294.52 295.67 A: yep 

295.78 298.43 A: yep yeah 

297.13 299.15 B: and do you plan on doing that in the future 

298.78 299.67 A: i do 

299.48 300.53 B: oh wow 

300.02 305.46 A: i do as soon as i can it's just financially with having to move back and everything now 

304.36 305.28 B: (( mhm definitely )) 

305.52 313.45 A: we have to take the time to rebuild before i can do that and i'm scared that my kids are gonna be too old by the time i get to do it [laughter] 

312.10 312.97 B: well 

313.43 319.92 B: it'll be good though because as soon as my brother and i moved out of the house my mother wanted to start babysitting again so 

319.29 320.08 A: oh 

320.22 324.48 B: so at least you'll have that you know maybe you'll have 

322.79 323.83 A: yeah 

324.53 328.44 B: that kind of need to be around kids once your kids are out of the house 

324.66 325.82 A: i have such 

327.83 331.57 A: yeah and i have an eight year spread between my oldest and youngest 

331.14 332.13 B: oh wow 

331.84 332.76 A: so 

332.76 334.22 B: how many kids do you have 

333.72 334.94 A: i have three 

334.65 336.11 B: oh yes you said that 

335.74 339.14 A: yeah my they're ten six and two so 

338.63 340.69 B: oh cute that's a good age 

340.27 346.68 A: yeah sometimes [laughter] but i think that that would be very helpful as far as 

341.63 342.89 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

346.91 351.70 A: [mn] you know i have the aspects of childcare all the way [laughter] 

350.26 353.38 B: mhm definitely i think you'd be really good at that 

353.12 354.63 A: yeah it would be fun 

354.96 356.07 A: (( definite- )) 

355.05 358.98 B: and you have the financial background working for a small business and 

358.49 359.32 A: yeah 

359.43 367.29 B: working in the insurance industry and i'm sure you know a lot about like the safety kind of medical hazards from working in the insurance industry 

366.93 371.32 A: yeah oh yeah definitely [laughter] unfortunately some days 

371.35 372.36 A: the sad 

371.54 374.16 B: do you think that would color your 

374.52 379.64 B: the way that you would [mn] you would treat your like the people under your care 

380.24 381.15 A: um 

380.30 381.70 B: (( [noise] at all [noise] uh-huh [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

383.06 388.00 A: [mn] i i think i'd be more cautious than some people who've never dealt with it before 

388.25 394.07 A: but kids will be kids and they're gonna get hurt they're gonna have accidents that you know so i don't know that 

394.63 403.56 A: that it would change the way i took care of kids maybe just my caution level to make sure little things were taken care of gates were where they needed to be things like that 

403.57 408.24 A: more so maybe than somebody who's never seen or dealt with the other side of it where 

408.46 413.08 A: when it's an accident outside of the home and blah all that kind of stuff so 

413.74 415.82 A: i think that would be probably the 

415.89 418.38 A: the biggest thing that would change for me 

417.91 419.27 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm yeah )) 

419.56 423.59 B: definitely well i guess even if you were running a spa you'd have that 

423.27 424.98 A: [mn] yeah i suppose 

423.80 431.94 B: [noise] that to worry about [laughter] like if somebody fell and hit their head after a massage because they were so elated or something [laughter] 

426.06 427.15 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

430.62 435.36 A: yeah or got too warm in the in the hot tub or in the 

434.57 435.59 B: (( i know )) 

435.42 438.31 A: sauna or whatever they were in yeah 

435.60 436.16 B: (( [noise] )) 

438.73 444.72 A: yeah there's tons of and people don't think about the insurance part of owning a business i don't think 

444.88 447.31 A: they think oh i can open it and 

447.64 456.72 A: you know there's worker's comp insurance if you've got employees and all that other stuff that you have to carry insurance wise which is 

454.92 460.06 B: yeah mhm wow it's just an entire i mean [noise] it can really drain you [noise] mhm 

459.41 460.65 A: mhm 

461.06 465.57 A: and that's the whole aspect that i learned working for a small business is all the cost of just 

465.78 467.60 A: simply keeping it up and running 

467.80 477.36 A: you know the just daily insurances and insurance on all of the vehicles and [sigh] all that kind of stuff that you don't think of just as a wor- when you work for a company 

477.75 484.00 B: oh definitely i think people don't really understand when they work for even a big company how much cost goes into 

484.11 486.12 B: maintaining what they do there 

485.82 487.88 A: yeah i agree 

488.03 492.30 A: 'cause e- like for me i don't know if we're supposed to say but i work for aetna 

492.22 493.25 B: mhm 

492.59 500.44 A: and so there i mean they've been in business for a hundred and fifty years and we have i think a hundred and fifty eight locations across the country 

500.32 501.68 B: (( wow mhm mhm )) 

500.93 507.39 A: and so can you imagine just what the you take the small business aspect of it out of there completely 

507.71 510.07 A: and it becomes just one huge 

510.37 514.65 A: you know health insurance and liabilities and worker's comp and 

514.68 516.39 A: everything so 

516.71 518.39 B: (( [lipsmack] wow that's crazy )) 

517.96 524.15 A: yeah it is when you think of a small business and then you think of [laughter] the big picture 

524.63 525.91 B: (( mhm definitely )) 

526.07 531.79 B: [noise] well it's hard enough for me to change my cell phone carrier let alone think about insurance 

531.42 535.05 A: yeah i know and it is it's a hard decision to make 

532.17 533.03 B: [laughter] 

534.72 536.29 B: it really is [sigh] mhm 

535.91 545.89 A: before i worked for aetna we had been with the same insurance company for like twelve years [laughter] so for me to switch insurance companies it was like oh you've gotta be joking [laughter] 

545.22 548.79 B: well when i came over to my latest job i couldn't i had never 

549.39 554.31 B: um i moved for to california from new mexico and i had never had a deductible 

554.24 555.22 A: oh 

554.69 559.76 B: for health insurance and i just had a deductible and it's horrible 

555.90 556.94 A: right 

559.52 560.27 A: yeah 

559.93 564.93 B: it's like they make you pay a plus a deductible [laughter] i think that's just ridiculous 

564.59 565.84 A: i agree 

565.65 566.60 B: but 

566.72 567.63 B: (( you know )) 

568.31 572.97 A: and it's like and i pay all this money every month to have insurance why [laughter] 

568.50 569.34 B: [laughter] i guess 

570.47 572.98 B: i know [laughter] i know 

573.17 578.58 B: just so that i'll know i have the card in my pocket i guess i probably wouldn't be a very good small business owner mhm mhm mhm 

575.53 577.69 A: (( yeah )) 

578.45 587.19 A: oh i think i would be on the aspect of of most things except for insurance would be my biggest fear because 

587.33 589.41 A: with all those people who are 

589.90 597.42 A: who have oh there's so many people out there who are looking for the small business that they can get into to get hurt to sue or you know 

597.17 598.30 B: definitely 

597.80 599.95 A: today's such a sue happy world 

599.53 599.89 B: (( def- ))
