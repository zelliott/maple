29.88 32.87 A: neither have i my wife signed me up on this thing 

32.22 34.35 B: i was told i had a good voice 

33.94 35.36 A: [laughter] 

35.23 41.44 B: i i had worked for myself i had worked uh in a courtroom for three or four years 

41.52 54.09 B: and i decided to work for myself which was fairly simple in my line of work 'cause i knew a lot of people that needed court reporters because i happened to be a court reporter [laughter] and attorneys that i had worked for gave me a call and they asked me to take hearings for them 

54.58 57.56 B: so i basically take hearings and i really don't have any 

57.70 58.75 B: outlay 

59.22 62.49 B: other than buying the equipment which i have and my 

62.59 64.14 B: the services are 

64.31 69.28 B: [laughter] in my fingers and uh and how did yours work 

65.49 67.52 A: (( [noise] sure cool that's pretty cool )) 

68.68 74.29 A: well i uh was working for a janitorial company just doing quality maintenance quality assurance 

74.37 87.99 A: [noise] um i just realized how easy it was so went and bought a real high power vacuum cleaner and some other uh equipment and went around and started doing cold calls door to door uh companies asking if i could do their janitorial service 

88.56 91.14 A: and uh ended up getting enough accounts to 

91.36 92.89 A: keep me going 

92.93 101.76 A: and uh i just used just like a spreadsheet to track my money and my uh incomings and outgoings so it was took it was a lot more involved because it was at night but it allowed me to 

101.90 106.05 A: go to school fulltime you know twenty two units at a time at times 

105.61 114.38 B: see it's been so long since i've been in school with like spreadsheet or something i don't even do i i i take a hearing i charge you x. amount of dollars for being there 

114.72 124.33 B: which i'll get whether the hearing goes on or is continued and i charge you so much a page i don't wanna be too specific nothing personal [laughter] and uh i send you the bill 

124.40 131.34 B: and if a little bit of time goes by and i don't get it i'll call you up of course if you're someone i know i'm not worried if i don't know you 

127.23 128.10 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

131.62 135.32 B: you're not gonna get the work unless i get paid upfront 

135.02 136.21 A: that's cool 

135.72 137.07 B: so i uh 

138.37 141.46 B: with with cold calls what would you you'd call up say like 

141.91 148.82 B: i i i i'm really bad at this kind of stuff a friend of mine said i'd be good at this because i have a good voice you just call up say i'm selling so 

146.54 147.28 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

149.31 152.03 B: do you want me to clean your place of business 

151.73 159.44 A: well that's what i would do is i'd just i would actually walk up to the company and walk in the lobby of their office and then i'd start talking about their office 

159.52 162.55 A: and i'd give them my card and tell 'em what i did and 

162.68 176.37 A: [mn] you know it was i i mean i was rejected ninety percent of the time i was i've i've i i have no problem doing cold calling i used to be a mormon missionary when i was younger and i would just i mean we're talking about thousands and thousands and thousands of doors 

170.92 172.06 B: oh wow 

176.51 181.55 A: so i mean and i got rejected you know ninety nine point nine percent of the time 

176.86 177.49 B: (( [laughter] )) 

180.90 186.75 B: well if you happened to come to my house i was very nice in telling you that i like that i was happy with my own religion i was never rude 

186.49 187.70 A: yeah 

187.11 188.29 B: but uh 

188.36 197.25 B: so you'd walk say like to me i'd i'd i would feel funny calling an attorney's office and saying hey i'm a court reporter do you need work i usually would get referrals by way of them calling me 

197.07 198.42 A: yeah well it's 

197.47 198.94 B: if they liked my work or 

199.53 206.87 A: i think it's a different nature of the business i do plan on going back into business for myself um i went and got a degree in computer information systems 

199.69 200.58 B: if i 

206.89 217.36 A: right now all i'm doing is just building my skill set up enough to where i know i can handle any kind of a contract job and i want to start doing freelance contracting instead of working for companies 

213.89 214.80 B: (( [cough] )) 

216.95 227.51 B: actually i have problems i mean in my job situation it's it's not having contracts because as a court reporter of his own business i know that i'm going to go away to a hearing and the hearing hopefully won't last forever 

227.54 228.13 B: (( [laughter] )) 

228.18 231.22 A: yeah you won't end end up like on a westerfield trial you mean 

231.08 232.72 B: uh which one 

232.90 234.96 A: [mn] like a westerfield trial 

235.28 236.20 B: that one 

235.42 239.60 A: i don't know where're you from oh okay i'm from the l._a. area 

236.55 237.93 B: philadelphia area 

239.01 243.93 B: oh okay yeah i'm not in a well an o._j. simpson trial would be very lucrative [laughter] 

244.02 248.11 B: but a west- the name didn't ring a bell and i'm from philadelphia pennsylvania 

247.04 252.03 A: okay it's that guy who killed this little down in san diego it was pretty sad 

251.66 254.11 B: but uh i know that sure now 

254.59 257.66 B: so like would you give them your bill when you walked in or like would you 

257.78 260.68 B: tell them what you were doing would they ask how much you charged 

260.30 261.91 A: oh you mean like with janitorial 

261.46 262.83 B: yeah 

262.20 264.71 A: uh i would just send them a monthly statement 

264.39 272.80 B: yeah 'cause like spreadsheets and stuff and i know they want you to talk about how you set up a business well i i really never set up a business as a court reporter i just basically waited for the calls to come in 

272.51 274.88 A: you do it and you collect your ten ninety nine huh 

274.50 281.35 B: yeah yeah i send them each a ten ninety nine 'cause as you go on all all my bills have a i send all my bills out but it's uh advertising i really 

276.14 277.00 A: yeah 

281.43 284.15 B: i'm very fortunate that i don't need to advertise 

283.42 290.30 A: oh man i got so messed up on my advertising and that's i guess we're supposed to talk about should we create our own business and how would we do it but i 

290.81 295.08 A: think that was what they had said but that's that's okay i don't care [laughter] 

294.28 298.30 B: [laughter] ca- well adverti- advertising i've actually taken cases involving advertising 

298.07 298.82 A: really 

298.32 300.38 B: where somebody had signed up with 

300.47 301.82 B: phone companies 

302.32 304.07 A: and did the yellow pages huh 

303.45 305.28 B: yeah yellow pages 

304.75 308.39 A: oh that's what i did i got so messed over by i 

308.41 310.71 A: (( i don't wanna swear [laughter] um )) 

310.88 316.75 A: i got so screwed over by some guy who told me promised me that i would get all kinds of viewership 

316.86 325.31 A: and i didn't get a single phone call from this ad and he i mean i spent a couple of thousand dollars on it and for me at that time you know i was 

325.47 330.30 A: twenty five years old starving just married or you know it was just it was rough 

329.76 335.21 B: i've never seen any of those kind of contracts but i i i've heard about i i the thing i took once was a contract 

335.22 345.74 B: uh this guy was signed up for two years come hell or high water and after six months his buil- his building was condemned so he well whatever it was just a situation he had to leave so he was basically stuck up in a situation for after uh 

341.98 342.94 A: yeah 

346.13 347.14 A: wow 

346.74 354.08 B: and this was a business this was a guy who'd been there for a while so and he had like a quarter page he was spending an awful lot of money that was useless 

353.80 354.87 A: oh 

354.26 357.22 B: but then again i guess in advertising if i were to see 

357.30 367.51 B: what cleaning is one thing i get very uh i don't know what they're like in l._a. but i get very wary when i open up a newspaper and i see a full page ad of a smiling attorney looking at me saying you know i want to help you 

367.24 368.31 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

367.38 374.32 B: 'cause i work them and the majority of the attorneys that i work for have small ads in telephone books 

373.94 375.05 A: yeah 

374.40 378.95 B: but they don't have the full page back like hey she got you know [laughter] 

377.83 379.36 A: (( [noise] huh )) 

378.90 393.73 B: uh you know hey like you know uh you're i actually saw an advertisement yesterday evening on the back of a bar ad that that somebody showed it to me i just about fell out of my chair laughing somebody was advertising you know you walk into a bar they have a menu of who's gonna be uh and entertainment calendar 

393.14 394.35 A: yeah 

393.71 395.94 B: on the back it was sponsored by 

396.04 400.38 B: a law firm who specializes in dui [laughter] 

399.18 401.98 A: [laughter] you know what i liked was i was in a um 

401.99 405.59 A: it was a black angus or stuart andersons i don't know if you've got those out there 

404.98 406.42 B: not that i know of 

405.37 415.98 A: it's a it's a steak place and they've got a bar and all that you go into the bathroom and in front of the urinal is a big poster of advertisements for d._u._i. attorneys 

415.79 427.19 A: for um getting out of jail attorneys all kinds of attorneys all over the place i just laughed my head off bail bonds this is a nice restaurant too i was laughing my head off inside their inside the bathroom 

426.56 437.52 B: i was somewhere once and somebody asked what i did for a living and i i sort of felt funny telling them what i did do the situation we were in and when i said i was a court reporter he says uh well i'm gonna be needing one of them soon uh 

438.14 447.68 B: you got a card the person sitting next to me happened to be an off duty undercover detective who worked in narcotics and he just looks at the guy says you looking to get arrested soon 

448.31 460.29 B: [laughter] 'cause like if i see people i know that that know what i do they say maybe they'll use me if it not an attorney but like like to advertise or something like that are you a friend of mine and i says well i wouldn't really want to take anything you're involved in because it's none of my business 

459.89 461.12 A: yeah 

460.71 465.47 B: but like my my situation is i guess they say advertising you're like open up your own business 

465.31 475.73 B: for me it was fairly i don't want to say simple uh i come from a family of them so my situation is very unusual i think it was unusual but but in my profession there's a lot of people 

475.63 483.80 B: it's sort of a family nobody's ever heard of the thing then you realize your mom and dad do it but i've never even th- i wouldn't even i wouldn't know the first thing about opening up a a 

485.34 491.23 B: a a business where i would have to knock on somebody's door and say here's what i do for a living and i'll do it better than bob 

490.83 499.93 A: yeah sounds more like what i would do with my computer company 'cause i'm getting to know so many different people so i'm making so many different business contacts that eventually when i start it 

500.21 512.85 A: i you know having the contacts so that's half the battle right there is having people to buy your stuff and you know that that's why i'm studying so much with the different uh programming languages and the different database systems 

512.29 521.12 B: 'cause like in my in my situation they i'm not selling anything that they don't already know they're gonna need because unless 

521.91 524.69 B: at least in pennsylvania in my line of work 

524.74 535.75 B: unless you're in a courtroom where the where the jury it's one of those trials that your initial hearing uh they don't have a court reporter unless someone chooses to make it a court of record so if you want me to be there 

533.39 534.39 A: yeah 

536.47 541.92 B: you know unless you're you know a multi a bizarre multimillionaire i'm not there on a parking ticket 

541.31 542.50 A: yeah 

542.27 543.92 B: [cough] and uh 

544.01 545.76 B: you're paying your attorney 

546.00 552.38 B: and your attorney's already worked in what i'm gonna charge to be there and if it's a high profile case 

553.51 556.34 B: and it's a very long f- hearing 

556.57 562.18 B: i'm gonna tell the attorney after the hearing i'm gonna i if i know the guy i know you know i 

562.03 575.81 B: it's such an unusual si- i have an unusual job but i'm i'm gonna tell the guy look you know this thing went on most of the day if you could i know he's gonna be asking his client for the money but i never look it upon as he's getting it from no offence you 

571.72 572.89 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

575.60 576.66 A: yeah 

576.04 582.84 B: you're the one that asked me to be there [laughter] and if i knew that uh i well you gave me your first name but i forget what it was 

577.49 579.21 A: yeah that's it so
