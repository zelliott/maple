116.85 120.43 B: and uh how the business is set up and you know 

120.23 134.89 B: how clean [sigh] the restaurant for instance would be and you know how good the service was um if promotion took place if they you know told you of any specials of the day and basically you're d- you're just looking for the customer service and you're going in as a regular customer 

134.89 140.68 B: and uh then you report back on how the service is and then i know that yeah there's a lot of 

138.31 139.09 A: but

256.91 263.77 B: basically on a._m._a. like basically you know driving properly um having secure 

262.19 262.93 A: (( [sigh] ))

267.82 272.44 B: you are in a safe environment with with the alberta government so 

271.72 273.97 A: so with your new business um 

273.96 275.66 B: yeah i do this on the side 

274.00 280.33 A: mystery shopping you would make sure that we'd have more businesses out there that are providing the public with 

279.08 281.86 B: proper customer service to the clients 

280.60 283.42 A: with what they want and need and and a 

283.27 293.21 B: right because that would help um of course increase uh the business and um it would value both the customer and and the businesses itself so 

283.57 284.62 A: right 

286.47 287.86 A: surveys yeah 

288.63 289.55 A: (( right )) 

293.00 294.66 A: yeah that's right you can 

293.65 294.74 B: yeah 

294.75 296.82 A: umbrella certain things i guess 

296.61 299.93 B: yeah so basically where are you working now what are you 

298.33 299.25 A: (( [sigh] )) 

299.86 302.77 A: well i work i i race horses which i don't 

302.16 303.74 B: oh good 

303.16 312.55 A: i d- i i really don't like the racehorse industry you know 'cause they it's really hard on the animals i wish that we could do something to make the make it safer you know like restrictions and things i 

312.59 316.94 A: you know 'cause they're there are throwaways now because you manage after they make money but 

312.90 314.14 B: right 

316.57 318.22 B: mhm mhm 

317.76 320.03 A: what i'm interest in doing is um [lipsmack] 

320.27 323.82 A: taking those horses who've made people thousands of dollars and 

324.12 332.34 A: giving them a a retirement place and then taking children who need support like growing up mentors or 

332.39 334.56 A: like when a child takes care of a horse 

334.83 340.35 A: like they would adopt a horse they'd come and they'd take care of the horse and the horse would give them an incentive 

340.43 348.44 A: and a feeling of power empowerment and they'd work together the horses would be taken of and the children would just get the empowerment [sigh] 

343.87 344.79 B: oh 

348.83 350.00 B: mhm 

348.89 352.14 A: that's that i'm a big dreamer so [laughter] 

351.25 363.43 B: no that's uh that's a good dream yeah um i i love animals and i think i agree with you about um the abuse to animals you know whether it's horses racing or in a circus or you know anything else that um 

353.48 354.32 A: (( [sigh] )) 

354.80 356.00 A: yeah 

363.37 370.90 B: you know is is is not um good for the animal and then there's a lot of abuse so i'm i'm very sensitive to that area too so 

366.74 367.79 A: (( right [sigh] )) 

370.97 374.53 B: yeah and you were thinking of having your own business that way or 

371.89 372.62 A: um 

374.41 380.28 A: well yeah that's uh something uh that i'll do i'll definitely do the start with retiring horses um 

380.91 384.24 A: [laughter] i have two different ideas when i just you know but 

381.67 382.55 B: yeah 

384.33 385.47 A: if i can 

385.60 396.51 A: my big dream is a community center like that and this way i'd have um [sigh] different shop- workshops and things like you know candle making and gemstone [sigh] jewellery making and um 

394.55 395.61 B: mhm 

396.36 409.95 B: and so you would just basically have parties right and then you make the commission off of the parties and what the people purchase and you get your commission that way right 'cause i used to sell avon myself too it was fun it was a lotta fun so 

405.95 407.01 A: right 

408.31 409.10 A: (( huh )) 

410.12 411.06 B: um 

411.03 414.73 A: right if i if i had um a spiritual shop 

411.08 412.05 B: and 

414.80 415.82 B: mhm 

415.56 417.80 A: i guess i should stick with one subject huh 

417.96 418.87 B: uh 

418.85 420.49 A: [sigh] [mn] most likely 

419.32 425.55 B: well [mn] wherever i get [laughter] this is my first call you know what i think we're doing pretty good yeah i'm sure 

420.66 422.25 A: is this your first call 

424.18 426.32 A: okay they just called you like 

425.84 433.04 B: uh yeah yeah the the uh the the voicemail [laughter] just came on if we're interested in participating so yeah so 

427.16 428.27 A: [laughter] 

428.82 431.36 A: [laughter] oh okay 

431.86 434.18 A: i got a lotta different ideas you know 

434.03 435.57 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

434.56 435.50 A: um 

435.62 444.67 A: but i think they'd fall under one house if i had a community center type deal like children in foster homes um their little spirits are broken you know and they 

444.61 452.79 A: well our children who are street children who are in high school they need a [sigh] a mentor or some direction or 

452.66 454.49 B: mhm mhm 

453.31 454.63 A: like um 

455.50 460.37 A: they just need that ex- something to that extra empowerment you know 

460.67 461.77 B: mhm 

460.70 461.95 A: and um 

462.19 466.03 A: it depends on how successful the community center would be 

466.48 475.96 A: because then we'd have computers or gardening that would save green space here and they're developing so fast in the valley [sigh] we could teach 'em 

476.25 481.92 A: good old fashioned gardening and then take care of their horses and the horses would empower them and [sigh] 

478.18 479.46 B: mhm 

481.34 491.80 B: yeah and and then that would be um very fulfilling because you know that you're helping a child as well that has either been abandoned or abused in the past and so you're 

482.04 483.93 A: candle making and [sigh] 

490.36 492.93 A: right and we'd grow our own fresh 

493.54 499.83 A: produce you know and teach 'em how to um you know grow garden with non pesticides there's so many things you know 

494.85 496.28 B: mhm 

499.57 501.24 B: mhm mhm 

500.50 504.78 A: (( [sigh] we'd be able to do and i think i could get government funding for most of that )) 

505.09 516.30 B: yeah yeah actually actually you would yeah i actually looked into that in alberta uh about five years ago as well too uh for child foster caring i had taken some courses on that and 

505.54 507.57 A: but that's my big dream [noise] 

516.27 527.11 B: and um how you would adopt a child to live with you and f- you know for a certain amount of time or what have you and and there was uh [mn] our government in alberta anyway is very strong with supporting 

527.09 541.34 B: uh programs like that so it um would've been a good angle i was actually looking at that quite a few years back too [lipsmack] um and and i feel if you if you can help someone help themselves and grow into someone 

541.43 546.46 B: you know uh and and and put value into their life then there is nothing more fulfilling than 

542.84 543.74 A: yeah 

546.00 555.17 A: right give them alternatives in direction and actually give them um that if they wanna be a model if they wanna be a singer if they wanna be an actor 

546.74 547.67 B: you know 

548.48 549.87 B: exactly 

554.31 556.27 B: mhm and and help them 

555.19 560.29 A: then i'd have places where they could go and actually fulfil these things you know um 

559.51 560.43 B: mhm 

560.61 567.71 A: something i didn't have when i was a child i wanted to be all those but i didn't have the right person to talk to or the right you know i couldn't get the connection or 

562.51 563.75 B: (( yeah you )) 

565.95 574.28 B: didn't have the right mentor is right right so yeah that that would be a good so you're you're looking at maybe possibly doing that then 

568.18 569.55 A: yeah 

570.46 571.82 A: (( [sigh] )) 

574.06 578.53 A: mhm yeah i'd start with the horses 'cause i already have the horses [laughter] 

574.75 576.83 B: yeah just finding out 

578.54 581.47 B: right right yeah 

580.08 582.13 A: when i find the find land 

581.95 583.06 B: mhm 

583.11 584.77 B: (( so it sounds like there's a )) 

583.17 584.73 A: (( which i'm looking for right now )) 

584.80 588.27 B: lot of um things in common that a lot of us um 

588.26 599.89 B: you know [mn] business people do have in common and that would be for helping others to increase in their growth and also it sounds just from talking with you too about the animal issue that we
