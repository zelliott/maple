249.50 252.17 A: for the for the place 

249.83 250.82 B: okay 

252.67 253.88 A: and then 

254.78 258.50 A: and then um the consulting firm would be 

258.95 260.14 A: um 

260.76 273.00 A: organizing people to go out and survey the place and and draw the lines on the on the map and um come up with the the design that's 

273.23 276.33 A: uh suitable to the local situation

288.09 289.04 B: okay 

290.02 293.91 B: well missoula would be a a good place for that this is a growing 

293.98 295.37 B: it's a small 

295.52 308.58 B: city you know in the way of uh cities my my my wife and i we come originally from new york city and so you know missoula is very very small in comparison but it is a growing city 

296.31 297.23 A: (( mhm )) 

297.60 298.74 A: okay w- 

301.44 302.67 A: (( oh okay ))

321.68 323.91 A: so it's a small city and um 

323.94 327.55 B: it's probably i guess about now it's probably a city of 

327.75 329.46 B: ninety thousand 

329.23 330.23 A: okay 

330.02 332.07 B: somewhere in that area

336.14 337.41 A: (( oh okay )) 

337.17 338.20 B: so

349.96 352.62 A: right so how how come 

351.47 355.51 B: but you don't make you don't make very much money here though [laughter] 

354.06 358.01 A: okay how come you choose to move from new york to 

358.15 360.14 A: to that place 

359.60 365.43 B: i wanted to my wife and i both wanted to leave a big uh metropolitan area

373.30 374.31 A: okay 

374.29 375.56 B: to come to a 

374.57 378.88 A: to enjoy the rural area li- kinda life or 

379.26 380.69 A: is that a main purpose 

379.59 385.25 B: i would i i would prefer to live outside the city and and we're 

385.42 388.94 B: we're still willing to talk about that um 

387.21 388.51 A: mhm 

390.14 395.87 B: but you you know how how that goes you live outside the city and and then you have to commute and [sigh] 

393.93 394.89 A: mhm 

395.62 397.54 A: right right 

396.65 398.18 B: and that whole business 

398.14 405.48 A: so you're now still in the city not in the rural area not in not in suburb 

403.45 404.34 B: no 

407.19 410.68 B: uh no w- w- yeah we are not in a rural area 

410.40 411.34 A: okay 

410.72 413.49 B: it would this would be more yeah i mean we're in the city 

413.15 416.44 A: okay because the business you're doing is 

416.60 419.67 A: currently related to the city 

420.57 421.87 A: (( or just )) 

421.08 423.75 B: well actually currently right now i'm working 

424.28 427.80 B: even away from i'm working four hours away from missoula

435.96 437.03 A: okay 

437.58 438.99 B: to the city 

439.99 441.27 A: so that 

440.34 441.14 B: (( we've ki- )) 

441.29 443.17 B: kinda getting off the subject here 

442.92 444.64 A: right [laughter] 

443.20 444.28 B: um 

446.37 447.58 B: let's see what else 

446.51 447.30 A: so 

447.72 449.54 A: right what's the purpose 

448.26 449.29 B: so 

449.70 450.45 A: (( of )) 

450.87 456.03 B: so i guess that's i i guess i guess that's where i would i would start 

450.88 451.86 A: (( of that )) 

455.72 461.45 A: (( mhm do you ever study or selling company )) 

461.48 468.51 B: yeah i actually the reason i the reason i left that business was because all i was doing was installing so really i'd rather 

468.55 471.39 B: stick with service if i could 

470.42 476.20 A: mhm like in- installing a as as part of the service 

472.13 473.21 B: um 

476.79 477.76 A: (( or or )) 

478.05 479.05 A: not 

479.40 484.58 B: well it you know it i mean they kinda go together really um 

483.38 484.27 A: mhm 

487.06 490.58 B: but i just i'm happier just doing service work 

490.40 491.43 A: okay 

491.19 493.51 B: rather than actually installing 

493.28 496.07 A: oh installing is too much work is that 

495.58 498.72 B: (( it's um boring )) 

498.42 499.48 A: okay 

499.17 501.06 B: it it became boring 

500.99 502.03 A: okay 

501.30 502.41 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

503.46 506.27 B: it's kinda like doing the same thing all the time 

505.29 508.49 A: so the service would be like more 

508.68 511.86 A: interaction with the clients and 

511.72 513.10 B: um 

511.91 515.55 A: i don't know what what kind of service are you talking about 

514.91 516.21 B: the service 

516.30 518.86 B: the service end of it is 

520.71 523.88 B: in in my opinion um 

524.08 528.80 B: [lipsmack] more of a profit can be made in less the time 

527.90 529.33 A: mhm 

529.25 534.49 B: i mean it depends you know it it of course the bigger the bigger door 

534.52 538.96 B: you know the bigger the door is that you're installing the more money that can be made you know 

538.80 539.89 A: mhm 

539.34 545.11 B: um so if you were doing uh nothing but commercial you know let's say big doors 

545.08 546.20 A: mhm 

545.58 548.54 B: then you could make more money 

547.91 548.89 A: okay 

548.99 553.80 B: but here it's mostly residential developing 

553.50 554.54 A: mhm 

553.92 558.86 B: so the doors are just home you know residential doors house doors and 

556.40 557.45 A: right 

557.88 559.42 A: right 

560.46 562.81 B: of course your profit margin is less 

563.06 564.82 A: (( so if you uh )) 

565.04 572.92 A: move to i mean if your business is open somewhere where people have a bigger garage like the the 

573.05 575.88 A: the rich corner in the in the suburb 

576.07 579.14 A: so that your that mean your business will be better 

579.23 580.64 A: is that correct 

581.24 585.36 A: like people who have three cars and four cars and they would 

583.97 587.75 B: right if you sure if if you were doing yeah if you were 

587.88 593.46 B: right if you were if you had in one location where you were installing three or four doors 

593.63 597.64 B: then of course yeah your profit margin would be higher there because 

597.73 599.65 B: you won't have to travel
