0.09 1.68 B: hi my name is marta 

1.43 3.31 A: hi there this is mark 

2.99 3.96 B: hi mark 

3.60 4.54 A: how're you 

4.20 5.04 B: great 

5.30 8.10 A: so we're supposed to talk about opening our own business 

7.54 10.84 B: (( um i think if money was not an issue i would open some kind of travel business )) 

11.94 15.39 A: right if money was not the issue what would you open 

16.80 18.59 B: (( so um just some sort of guide service so that i could travel the )) 

18.99 19.95 A: (( mm )) 

22.57 24.22 A: (( interesting why )) 

24.65 26.43 A: (( travel )) 

30.97 37.04 A: (( yeah )) 

34.31 35.31 B: (( world um which is something )) 

37.20 39.48 A: (( right )) 

38.30 39.90 B: (( that just interests me very much and uh )) 

40.05 45.14 B: (( if money were not an object i think i could do that it's something that i would definitely enjoy and hopefully i'd be able to make money out of it so if money weren't an issue you'd be )) 

42.19 44.15 A: yeah that's true [laughter] 

45.44 48.66 A: or make a lot of money real fast and i could retire and 

47.95 49.66 B: (( traveling don't have to [laughter] there you go )) 

48.92 50.74 A: just do that on my own time 

50.05 51.14 B: there you go 

52.08 54.44 B: boy that's a tough one i 

52.14 53.16 A: um 

53.71 55.06 A: yeah 

54.51 58.38 B: think i'd rather have something where i could socialize and have people come in 

58.40 60.53 A: okay like a store of some sort 

58.87 59.63 B: um 

59.94 61.95 B: yeah yeah 

62.25 66.26 B: either ran a business either a clothing store or 

67.13 69.11 B: um maybe a wine bar 

70.14 76.65 B: coffee shop something where i could work there but have be social also and cater to neighborhood people 

71.31 72.06 A: that 

76.46 77.53 A: (( sounds interesting okay )) 

78.42 83.95 A: um one of the things that i would do even if i didn't have a lot of money probably 

84.07 92.48 A: would be to do a lot of research ahead of time um as far as like over the internet or talking to other business owners 

92.92 105.97 A: um reading books to find out things like location and just coming up with the business plan and if money were no object probably talk to some consultants or lawyers or 

106.44 111.76 A: accountants those types of people because i mean i'm i'm not an expert on that obviously 

111.19 116.58 B: right oh you mean for maybe a site location or opposed to having it out of your home 

114.17 115.27 A: yeah 

116.47 117.89 A: right 

118.10 129.07 A: and i mean even just as far as like what city to locate in i mean if i was gonna be traveling internationally i'm in the midwest that prob- probably wouldn't be the the best place to locate that business 

128.49 130.36 B: (( mhm right right right )) 

129.76 133.88 A: might wanna be like near a big city or someplace like that 

134.00 135.68 B: yeah depending on where you're 

136.41 138.59 B: where you would get your clientele 

138.25 139.59 A: yeah 

140.04 149.63 A: and um one of the other things that i would probably do is i have some relatives several relatives that own their own businesses and they're not big businesses but 

149.65 152.58 A: one of the things that they've always said is 

152.82 155.44 A: you're only as good as the people you are around you 

155.61 162.12 A: so um it's very important to hire competent people that know what they're doing 

161.76 163.49 B: very interesting comment mhm 

162.61 166.86 A: um that can function when you're not around 

166.87 172.84 A: um [laughter] in fact one of one of the first people i i would think i would hire ironically would be my wife 

172.91 180.29 A: um she's in sales so she's great at talking to people she's very organized 

180.42 182.90 A: so she could be my vice president i guess 

182.35 183.88 B: (( [laughter] there you go )) 

184.22 185.93 B: keep it all in the family 

185.24 189.29 A: she's uh she'd definitely keep things organized for me 

189.40 192.06 A: which uh is not my strongest point so 

191.56 192.38 B: right 

192.29 195.08 A: and then i could travel with her too hopefully so 

194.46 195.58 B: there you go 

196.09 202.97 B: do you think a lot of people today though for travel get their information off the internet opposed to going to an agency 

202.85 213.50 A: yeah i think that um whatever business i opened um i'm in the computer industry um so would definitely have an online component 

213.08 213.90 B: ah 

213.81 216.47 A: that at very least they could uh 

216.59 226.17 A: look at itineraries and pictures and and all that sort of it- um and probably go so far as to book things online too 

225.87 226.92 B: right 

226.25 228.03 A: because you're right i mean 

228.21 235.98 A: when i travel that's the first place i go i don't go through travel agents any more i i go to travelocity or 

233.23 234.60 B: (( see i don't either mhm )) 

236.10 240.16 A: expedia or wherever the case may be to book airfare and 

239.73 246.70 B: i've done the exact same thing it just seems like the internet has taken away from a lot of businesses that used to do the footwork for you 

246.16 247.96 A: right 

247.08 251.35 B: you know opposed to some place where you go to buy a service 

251.39 256.45 A: yeah that's the nice thing about a a store in your case is 

256.65 257.97 A: um 

259.44 266.32 A: it's a lot easier or it's a lot easier to sell something tangible in a store that people can try on or touch 

266.11 267.27 B: exactly 

266.94 270.61 A: um which is kinda hard to do on the internet sometimes 

270.24 272.69 B: yeah you can't go get a latte over the internet 

272.32 274.53 A: right good point [laughter] 

272.70 274.47 B: [laughter] 

275.21 276.46 A: (( so um )) 

277.81 279.52 A: let's see what else 

280.32 291.25 B: i'd definitely do it in in a area that's trendy also opposed to a shopping mall or even as even opposed to a franchise i would think if i had all the money i wouldn't go franchise 

291.01 292.15 A: yeah 

291.38 294.19 B: just because of the individuality of your own place 

294.15 295.52 A: yeah that's true 

295.79 296.86 A: um 

297.18 300.67 A: and then you could always expand in the future if you wanted to 

300.76 302.01 B: absolutely 

300.99 306.10 A: um if if it was really popular al- popular idea you could franchise to other people 

305.72 307.44 B: there you go that's true 

306.74 310.82 A: and uh become the next wal-mart or something like that who knows 

311.59 313.70 A: get your latte and your uh 

314.13 316.44 A: clothes or whatever the case may be 

315.66 317.07 B: (( yeah right )) 

317.43 318.58 B: (( [lipsmack] exactly )) 

318.77 321.82 A: any any other stuff that you would do 

321.95 325.31 A: as far as like the planning stage 

326.06 332.90 B: the planning stage yeah probably do the same thing you know to make sure that you have lawyers [noise] to back you 

333.00 333.86 B: (( um )) 

334.14 338.53 B: or even you know building a brand new location opposed to getting something that 

338.74 351.79 B: you know buying something like a building that's been used for something before it depends on the location and if you can find um if if it's in a trendy area more than likely you'd have to look for real estate opposed to building something 

344.42 345.54 A: yeah 

351.45 352.56 A: yeah 

352.32 356.48 B: um if you were you know going into an area or a a 

356.52 361.62 B: newer area then you would have to say you would have the opportunity to build 

362.59 364.72 B: a structure yourself 

364.30 365.61 A: right 

365.01 368.99 B: i think you know in a it depends on on the area if you're in a city 

369.50 371.97 B: you probably have to look for something that's existing 

371.68 372.87 A: yeah i mean 

373.23 382.46 A: i would imagine that locating a business would be just like um location for a house there i'd say are the three most important things are location location location 

382.12 383.53 B: absolutely 

382.80 385.26 A: so i imagine it's the same for a business 

385.37 387.11 A: as far as uh 

387.98 393.15 A: getting a place that people are gonna drive by and recognize and having good signs and 

392.44 402.63 B: mhm 'cause if you were gonna buy something that was already established you'd wanna know why it went out of business in the first place or why it wasn't doing well in order to be sold so you'd have to look at that aspect of it too 

398.69 399.66 A: right 

400.38 401.43 A: (( definitely definitely )) 

405.08 408.68 A: um let's see what else can i think of 

409.03 413.68 B: how many people would you have in a comp- just to start you and your wife just two people 

412.68 413.96 A: um 

414.49 417.01 A: i'd probably get 

417.73 422.96 A: several other people like a like a secretary office manager type person that could handle 

423.38 432.69 A: all the nitty gritty stuff correspondence and answering phones and that sort of thing and then probably a couple of experts um 

432.73 436.36 A: travel experts whether they be travel guides or 

436.52 444.41 A: or or somebody like that because it's something that i'm interested in but i don't have a wealth of knowledge about it going in 

444.76 446.34 B: so would you do tours 

446.09 448.54 A: um yes probably something like that 

447.96 456.58 B: uh so you could go first say like it's a european tour you could do it yourself first to check out the best places to eat the best places to stay 

453.10 454.34 A: exactly 

455.71 459.45 A: or yeah or even and book a book a couple of tours 

459.48 464.07 A: through other agencies and then find the things i liked and the things i didn't like 

463.00 473.10 B: oh now that's a good idea now a friend of mine took a european tour like that a two week trip where everything was um the itinerary was set for you 

468.11 469.11 A: yeah 

473.27 477.76 B: uh what she liked about it was that she got to see a lot and got you know 

478.29 485.26 B: quite a bit of bang for her buck you know for what she paid what she did not like about it was the rigid schedule that 

480.31 481.42 A: right 

485.28 493.08 B: it wasn't like you could just you know sleep in get up go have coffee whatever it was you know you're here on certain time and you're with the same people 

489.54 490.55 A: yeah 

492.77 493.64 A: yeah 

493.05 501.32 B: on a tour bus and those were the things she didn't like so yeah going and getting the pros and cons of what you like and what you don't like would probably be a very good start mhm 

500.44 504.05 A: yeah one of the things i that i would try and do 

504.24 509.79 A: would be like to differentiate myself as maybe try to go to places off the beaten path 

510.91 514.07 A: um places that people 

514.24 516.60 A: wouldn't normally go to i guess 

517.04 520.50 A: that could be one way to differentiate myself i suppose 

520.62 523.68 B: make it different than the normal tour guides 

521.77 522.78 A: yeah 

523.51 524.51 A: (( right um [lipsmack] )) 

524.35 525.96 B: that's a good idea 

526.83 529.39 A: trying to think what else i can think of 

532.90 539.40 A: but i no matter what i was gonna do it's like kinda like i said at the beginning i think the re- research would be the big thing 

539.73 540.83 A: um 

540.60 543.68 B: mhm i think that's the difference between success and failure mhm 

543.02 545.31 A: yeah doing the legwork ahead of time 

544.27 545.17 B: mhm 

545.93 546.91 A: um 

546.17 551.10 B: people go into it with different expectations that it won't be a lot of work or it you know 

550.42 551.69 A: yeah 

551.15 557.06 B: it'll be easy where i think the first three years you have to put in a lot of work to make something happen 

555.66 556.85 A: right 

557.30 559.69 A: yeah they always say that so many 

559.81 562.23 A: two thirds of small businesses fail 

562.56 565.75 A: in the first couple of years and i think a lot of it is because 

565.96 571.43 A: they don't do the groundwork ahead of time developing a good business plan and 

571.44 572.63 A: um 

573.51 581.87 A: because if you have a good business plan you should be able to tell if you've done it well from my business school background that um 

581.93 586.26 A: you should be able to tell if if it's gonna fail or not assuming you do 

586.88 589.64 A: all the preliminary work ahead of time 

588.87 589.77 B: right 

589.97 594.15 A: and you analyze the market and all that sort of good stuff 

593.94 599.27 B: mhm i think um you know knowing when to bring in an expert is wise 

598.92 599.89 A: oh yeah
