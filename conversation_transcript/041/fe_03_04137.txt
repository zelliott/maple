1.06 2.17 A: hello 

1.91 4.07 B: yes hello this is marcus 

4.23 5.67 A: and this is larry 

5.60 6.93 B: hi larry 

6.30 7.74 A: where are you located 

8.15 10.41 B: i'm in uh new york new york 

10.77 11.98 A: (( uh-huh uh i'm in maine )) 

12.39 16.40 B: (( all right )) 

13.15 14.06 A: uh 

15.12 19.63 A: i don't really know what i would open for a business if i were to open my own how about you 

19.47 26.60 B: well actually i've been uh kinda thinking about that lately um maybe a bookkeeping business 

27.09 29.36 A: is that something that you would try to do at home 

27.42 29.09 B: doing 

29.75 42.41 B: i think so work out of my home at first and uh expand from there maybe i'll uh i i've been doing my taxes the last few years and it seems like i really enjoy that so i thought maybe uh 

42.71 46.10 B: you know building from there 

45.44 52.02 A: that sounds like a a very good enterprise i know in the area where i live there are a number of people that do do that 

52.26 56.78 A: as a sideline business and uh my wife has contemplated doing that 

56.61 57.98 B: oh okay 

57.54 58.35 A: (( [cough] )) 

58.45 61.61 A: so i think a home business is very viable in today's 

62.03 68.26 A: economy and in today's family situation it gives you more time to spend with the kids and what not so 

67.83 70.48 B: i think so 

69.39 71.32 A: it would seem to me like a good idea 

71.83 74.13 B: thank you i've b- i've been uh 

74.96 81.70 B: [sigh] trying to find something you know uh better than just the regular nine to five [noise] it seems like it just doesn't uh 

79.03 80.61 A: [laughter] 

81.65 82.92 A: i hear you on 

82.41 85.02 B: you know it just doesn't cut it so 

86.16 91.40 B: um but you said you've you uh you're not sure what uh type of business you might open 

92.29 93.40 A: uh 

93.73 97.05 A: well [mn] i do carpentry work and 

97.30 100.80 A: i do a little work on the side from time to time for other people 

100.91 102.44 A: you know but as far as 

102.48 103.08 B: (( [noise] )) 

102.70 106.29 A: (( opening my own business i haven't given a lot of thought to it no )) 

106.41 107.38 A: uh 

108.41 111.61 A: just because i think it would require an awful lot of extra time 

111.54 114.82 B: yeah 

112.13 113.17 A: (( uh )) 

114.22 119.74 A: that probably wouldn't be true of every field but in the field that i happen to be in at the moment 

120.01 124.09 A: i think it would require a lot of time above and beyond the normal work day 

124.14 125.06 B: yeah 

124.52 132.03 A: [cough] it would require going out and giving estimates and quotes and you know a lot of a lot of hours that would be unpaid hours 

132.39 133.48 B: that's true 

134.26 136.61 B: a lot of trying to drum up business 

136.11 136.96 A: right 

137.20 140.05 B: um on a one on one basis 

139.42 144.17 A: yeah i think there's probably good money in doing that be a lot of successful people but 

141.79 142.76 B: yeah 

144.75 145.70 A: uh 

146.31 152.32 A: our family situation is such that it [laughter] it wouldn't be feasible for me to do it right now so 

151.81 156.04 B: yeah that's interesting 

152.67 153.60 A: (( [cough] )) 

154.94 160.37 A: so is there something you're strongly considering uh doing in the near future 

160.15 162.47 B: it it actually is um 

162.93 164.93 B: the the one thing i've uh 

165.43 168.14 B: kind of uh the same issues you have with uh 

168.24 170.96 B: thinking about this is the time constraints you know i 

171.60 174.31 B: i know i need to get some more schooling to do it 

174.65 177.75 B: uh maybe take some night classes 

177.85 185.74 B: but uh i already have a couple of nights you know i have a regular eight to five job and a couple of nights already uh each week that are taken 

186.61 188.78 A: right i hear ya [laughter] 

186.82 192.61 B: uh so it's you know a- and the wife works uh some nights and she's already in school during the day 

192.71 193.45 A: right 

192.98 197.30 B: so uh [laughter] [mn] it gets kinda tight you know 

195.09 199.35 A: how old are you that that would make a difference to me i think how old are you 

198.12 200.35 B: yeah i'm i'm twenty seven 

199.93 204.10 A: oh well you're at you're at a good age to think about doing that and 

203.53 205.06 B: yeah 

204.54 206.67 A: [cough] do you have younger children 

206.53 208.02 B: [lipsmack] no no children 

207.53 208.29 A: uh-huh 

208.68 214.53 A: well that gives you another little bit of an edge see i'm fifty three and i have i have two 

208.90 212.81 B: so i i have that freedom mhm yeah 

214.55 218.98 A: boy- well my younger one just graduated from the maritime academy on saturday 

219.17 224.63 A: so they're pretty well gone from home but i have a wife that has a serious illness you know 

219.20 220.47 B: oh wow 

221.75 222.77 B: (( mm )) 

224.27 225.16 B: okay 

224.79 234.59 A: (( that's a bit of a restricting factor for me in terms of time so you know there are a lot of times when i have to take a day off from work to attend to her medical needs and medical appointments so )) 

227.10 229.41 B: yeah 

234.63 236.26 B: yeah 

235.58 242.99 A: as far as setting up my own business unless it were something that i could operate out of home uh it would be a difficult thing for me to do i think 

243.98 245.28 B: yeah that's 

245.67 248.87 B: i think that holds a lot of people back is uh 

249.97 252.69 B: y- you know the unknowns like you know 

251.43 258.49 A: well that's right a- and then there's a fear factor that creeps into it i mean you know a few years ago i had given some thoughts to uh 

253.16 254.03 B: um 

254.30 255.36 B: yeah 

259.11 263.48 A: not not the bookkeeping part but i had given some thoughts to starting a business 

263.66 267.80 A: and uh there are there are some fear factors involved in it like 

267.05 269.24 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

268.11 270.01 A: uh you don't know 

270.16 273.93 A: how long it's gonna take you to generate the volume of business 

274.39 277.90 A: for instance that it would take you to be self sustaining 

277.99 279.46 B: yeah that's true 

278.43 280.05 A: and uh 

279.95 281.54 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

280.92 283.69 A: you know back oh gosh this was 

285.13 287.98 A: probably around nineteen seventy four 

285.36 299.70 B: mhm 

288.59 290.07 A: (( seventy five )) 

290.67 293.89 A: yeah it'd be a little over twenty five years ago uh 

294.45 297.34 A: i was doing some carpentry work for a guy that was 

297.48 302.71 A: moving into real estate and he wanted to start a bo- bro- brokerage business 

303.22 308.53 A: and he asked me if i would consider doing that for him you know and and i gave it a shot 

308.42 309.41 B: (( [noise] )) 

308.81 310.72 A: at the time i was teaching school 

310.23 313.80 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

311.75 316.68 A: uh you know it it it was something at the time that i thought about very very strongly 

317.13 318.31 A: only 

318.54 323.21 A: i could see that it was gonna take probably a couple of years to make enough money 

323.63 329.31 A: to get by on without giving up another job [laughter] and uh 

327.18 328.54 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

329.35 333.17 A: you know at that time i couldn't afford to do it is what it cooked down to 

333.20 339.07 A: but if it's something that you could move into gradually and this sounds like a business that you could you know you could operate from home 

339.25 342.37 A: and if it reached a point where [sigh] 

343.22 346.13 A: (( you knew it was gonna support itself )) 

346.30 349.40 A: then you could give up your other eight to five job and 

349.66 351.73 A: move into that full time so 

353.00 359.37 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] well that um that's that's kinda how i've been uh you know i've been holding back a little bit uh 

359.42 366.03 B: i think some uh making some excuses you know to keep putting it off but then i also uh 

362.43 363.58 A: [laughter] 

364.21 367.67 A: well it's easy to rationalize that yeah yeah i know 

366.63 367.68 B: you know i 

367.92 373.15 B: i know i have to do it you know i have to uh to start or else it's never gonna happen 

372.75 383.24 A: well i call that analysis paralysis you know when that happens to me and 'cause i'm an analytical person and you probably are i mean if you're thinking well bookkeeping and you do income taxes 

375.27 377.78 B: yeah 

381.88 384.18 B: mhm yeah 

383.27 389.20 A: you're probably a very analytical individual as am i because when i was teaching i taught science and math 

386.50 388.55 B: yeah 

389.16 390.13 B: okay 

389.48 390.73 A: and uh 

391.24 392.21 A: you know uh 

392.43 393.76 A: i think you do 

393.66 395.51 B: yeah 

393.77 394.90 A: (( uh uh )) 

394.91 396.68 A: go through all of those 

396.72 398.89 A: you know if this happens 

398.90 403.93 A: this should be the result but what if it isn't and if it isn't what's plan b. and if 

404.19 408.97 A: plan b. doesn't work what would plan c. be and so on 

407.29 408.74 B: yeah 

409.37 412.17 A: uh i think those are natural reservations so 

413.31 420.50 B: i uh i i think i uh i hold back a little also my my wife had tried to start a business about a year ago 

420.79 421.89 B: um 

422.33 428.51 B: like a um personal assistant kind of um organizer kind of business 

429.29 430.39 B: um 

430.66 433.96 B: and i helped her get it you know get things together for it 

433.97 436.72 B: but then she uh she just lost motivation 

436.50 437.33 A: uh-huh 

436.90 438.90 B: lost her oomph uh 

439.09 447.89 B: when it came time to actually start getting customers and getting clients and uh she got some cold feet and basically just just stopped 

443.53 444.87 A: (( right mhm )) 

448.62 449.56 A: well i think 

448.79 450.01 B: and um 

450.10 451.04 A: (( i think )) 

450.15 458.81 B: you know we invested a little bit of money and time into it and [mn] it was a pretty big letdown for me 'cause i i really wanted to see her be successful with it you know 

452.65 453.49 A: right 

459.21 460.85 B: but it just didn't happen 

461.32 462.60 B: but uh 

462.99 468.59 B: so i i think that holds back a little bit uh i guess you know we've been talking the fear of failure 

465.90 470.55 A: sure but that doesn't mean that that wouldn't happen for you though uh i mean 

469.16 470.14 B: yeah 

470.28 471.55 B: [noise] that's true 

470.77 472.73 A: uh i think uh 

472.98 474.24 A: a real 

473.74 476.19 B: (( [noise] )) 

474.87 478.27 A: and i say this you know from a teacher's perspective but 

477.58 478.14 B: (( [noise] )) 

478.52 481.37 A: uh students that i've had in school over the years 

481.96 484.88 A: that you know were mediocre students 

485.12 488.36 A: have gone out into the world and become very good business people 

488.69 492.72 A: and i think there are a couple of variables that are 

492.97 494.53 A: are real important there 

494.68 497.01 A: they one they're self starters 

497.39 501.43 A: and two they've got a great drive to succeed 

501.84 508.53 A: and i think those two things are two very key ingredients and of course people skills enter into it too 

508.35 509.37 B: yeah 

508.78 509.76 A: uh 

510.46 513.60 A: but those three seem to be a good combination i think in 

514.68 516.04 A: fact [laughter] 

516.62 526.69 A: some of the carpentry work i do right now i do for a former student uh who set up his own business about a year ago a year and a half ago yeah uh just i happened to stumble onto him one day 

519.97 521.16 B: oh yeah [laughter] 

522.25 523.11 B: huh 

526.53 527.59 B: yeah 

526.99 528.55 A: and 

528.99 540.95 A: discovered that he had gone into business and he actually was floundering a little bit at the time and needed some help he said would you ever be interested in coming over and giving me a hand [laughter] so i mean 

540.60 541.35 B: huh 

541.63 547.91 A: one thing led to another and you know i do o- go over and help him out some from time to time and uh 

546.03 547.00 B: yeah 

548.08 552.37 A: it's kinda great to reconnect with old students to see how they're doing so 

552.35 556.75 B: wow that's really good so y- um 'cause you probably don't run into a lot of your uh 

556.95 559.04 B: your students i would think uh 

558.84 559.89 A: well 

559.22 561.61 B: kids grow up and leave and 

560.98 565.90 A: up where i am it's a common occurrence you know about about every time i 

563.13 564.79 B: yeah ok- okay 

565.98 570.94 A: go to a new job site i in fact [laughter] i went to a new job site today yeah yeah and there was 

568.24 571.62 B: oh really [laughter] [laughter] 

571.09 574.51 A: a kid that i had he's twenty five years old and uh 

575.03 579.07 A: i gee i haven't seen you for a while [laughter] but 

577.00 577.94 B: huh 

579.14 582.91 A: i mean the population of our county is probably 

583.35 586.89 A: well the population in the state of maine is a million people okay 

586.52 589.52 B: mhm 

587.07 588.32 A: the entire state 

588.61 591.20 A: and our county is probably 

591.48 593.58 A: (( i don't know a hundred thousand maybe )) 

593.63 595.97 A: possibly i don't believe it's much more than that 

595.60 597.51 B: yeah 

596.54 599.89 A: so it's a common occurrence to run into people that you know
