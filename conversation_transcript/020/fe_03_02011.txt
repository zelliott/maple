4.81 5.60 A: (( hi roy )) 

6.01 7.02 B: (( how's it going )) 

6.96 10.15 A: all right [laughter] have you done this before with these 

10.25 12.50 B: ah yeah i've done it once before 

12.33 18.22 A: okay this is the first time i guess we're just supposed to discuss in general the the topic at hand eh 

18.38 20.77 B: right and the topic was ah 

21.49 22.79 B: illegal 

22.86 25.57 B: business practices in the u._s. 

26.73 32.83 B: i'm thinking that that they want to know about you know like the enron and corporate scandals and stuff like that 

31.97 35.37 A: yeah yeah definitely ah 

37.55 39.77 A: i was also thinking too is like even 

40.13 41.66 A: (( you know just how )) 

41.93 44.77 A: you know responsible um 

45.72 53.04 A: ah people who run these companies ah need to be and not only just to the shareholders but really to you know employees as well 

52.98 55.92 B: yeah it's ah basically it's ethics 

56.43 57.85 A: i agree 

58.58 69.44 B: well yeah i mean really like those guys who are doing all the bad stuff are ruining it for all the people that are staying good now that they're going to have more rules and regulations they have to com- 

69.57 71.65 B: comply with 

72.33 78.90 B: and it's really hurting the market for like all the college graduates right now i'm a college senior and i'm graduating in may 

79.46 81.29 B: hoping that i get a job 

81.74 87.05 B: soon so i have friends who are sitting around and sitting around because they don't have any jobs 

86.98 89.62 A: well i've been unemployed for two two years 

90.69 92.00 B: oh really 

91.40 92.59 A: yeah 

92.25 93.96 B: oh what ah what ah 

94.18 95.36 B: area are you 

95.21 98.69 A: well i was a i was a unix system administrator 

95.70 96.39 B: (( in )) 

98.77 105.35 B: really i'm gonna graduate with a m._i._f. degree in about a month less than a month 

99.44 100.63 A: yeah 

105.19 109.48 A: right but you you probably know programing and stuff right 

109.00 110.75 B: right 

109.57 112.93 A: yeah there's still room for that the 

113.05 119.70 A: administration job on unix is kind of it's gotten so much more automated you know what i mean that only the top 

121.33 123.66 A: yeah only the best the real gurus 

124.16 133.83 A: you know kept their jobs during the dotcom bust and then there was also the y2k thing i mean basically if you could spell the word unix you could get a job 

127.27 128.36 B: yeah 

133.90 135.90 A: you know in nineteen ninety nine 

136.30 138.14 B: yeah 

137.73 140.66 A: and companies had outrageous budgets 

140.88 143.03 A: [laughter] but ah 

142.07 146.30 B: yeah lots of companies were willing to spend a lot of money 

145.22 148.26 A: yeah um so anyway with um 

148.43 151.70 A: this thing here i mean like even most recently where ah 

151.85 154.44 A: getting back to where i kind of think that 

154.47 160.28 A: a very recent example of just where these guys are like out of touch is like what happened with american airlines 

160.82 161.71 A: (( ah )) 

162.16 165.08 A: this they negotiated with the unions 

165.19 167.75 A: the three different unions to all to take pay cuts 

167.78 175.80 A: so they don't have to go into bankruptcy when they achieve that they turn around and give million dollar bonuses to all the executives 

176.22 178.27 B: yeah see that's the problem 

178.31 181.26 B: that money should trickle back down to the employees 

181.88 183.32 A: right 

182.55 185.68 B: it's all like how other airlines do it 

185.97 196.57 B: but american airlines is so big they have to like i don't know why like i know airlines there the employees take a active role in the company 

197.75 208.19 B: basically i think every single one of them has stock in the company so if they're not happy with their jobs then they're not happy with their stock so that promotes 

208.33 211.65 A: right well i think also a part of it too is 

211.77 213.31 A: you know we're 

213.82 215.42 A: so many people who 

216.14 224.10 A: um you know that the what i think might be a good sh- short of having the government really starting to get involved here if 

224.24 227.55 A: ah managers of mutual funds 

227.92 239.48 A: would start taking responsibility for the shares that they control you know 'cause they don't have to just proxy it over to these people and let them run the company any way they want 

241.39 242.98 B: the that's true 

242.90 251.76 A: you know and and they should start doing things like that too because i think part of the reason a lot of this stuff happens is just that ah the board of directors 

252.17 262.67 A: of most of these corporations are really not independent boards you know they're just you know they're easy buddies or political payback people you know like like retired senators and stuff 

262.47 263.93 B: yeah somehow 

264.80 267.89 B: they're related they have a connection to each other 

267.90 271.93 A: right and so they just give these executives any time they want you know and the 

272.47 280.94 A: you know like ah i just saw on c._n._n. about this thing ah with with ah ah american airlines and they were just talking about the executives in general you know 

282.01 283.55 A: the past two years 

283.87 293.40 A: the average person's wage in this country has gone up like three per cent but among executives in corporations it's gone up fourteen per cent 

292.73 296.77 B: yeah that's all about the rich getting richer basically 

297.01 302.19 B: (( the i was recently watching the news and have you ever heard of health south )) 

302.52 303.82 A: of what 

303.40 306.42 B: health south it's a ah rehab 

306.63 308.89 B: and hospital company 

308.78 309.68 A: (( ah )) 

309.47 313.84 B: they do ah three qu- i believe three quarters of the rehab in the u._s. 

314.24 322.32 B: like their owner created a separate account and funneled twelve million dollars out into his own private account 

322.26 323.43 A: (( so he stole )) 

323.36 330.37 B: yeah basically he stole that money and then he spent company money on private jets and things like that 

329.16 339.37 A: yeah well you know one thing i do what i wish that the government would change is i wish is when they'd catch these guys who do these white collar crimes they stick them in jail 

339.65 340.52 A: with 

341.10 342.55 A: (( where you know )) 

342.91 345.67 B: they should have harsher punishment 

344.75 347.11 A: well they should also go to real jails too 

347.61 348.54 A: (( you know )) 

350.16 351.93 A: [laughter] they should go to real jails 

351.85 354.41 B: yeah what kind of jails do these guys go to 

354.71 356.43 A: well a lot of these in the federa- 

356.48 360.34 A: the white collar guys on these federal things they go into those real light duty ah 

360.40 361.67 A: type prisons 

361.67 362.96 B: oh okay 

363.96 369.60 B: yeah i mean they they should go to like a real jail i always thought they did go to a real jail 

373.59 374.60 A: and then 

374.69 377.81 A: you know and you're right and they ought to start putting some real serious 

378.03 379.08 A: um 

379.40 381.49 A: kinds of penalties on these guys too 

383.40 385.10 A: they really don't do that 

385.35 393.53 B: yeah because one bad person can ruin a whole company that's what's really sad and everyone else could be a good employee too 

394.70 403.84 B: the way the economy is right now i mean if you depending on which field you're in if you lose your job it'll take a while to get back on your feet 

403.77 405.64 A: oh right right 

405.30 406.12 B: (( i )) 

405.83 408.40 A: you know just the the um 

409.20 410.07 A: (( ah )) 

411.80 417.41 A: i i think that's part of what i was trying to say there too was and i agree with what you're saying is that 

417.52 419.07 A: you know you get a guy who 

419.64 421.32 A: (( [noise] you know ah )) 

421.85 429.18 A: you know robbed a store or something like that and he's getting so many years and it's a larceny kind of thing but when you know you get a guy who 

429.38 432.29 A: you know these people who's like screwed up like in enron 

432.45 436.22 A: the impact the social impact is far greater 

437.21 439.29 A: you know than any one thief 

439.33 449.72 B: yeah because it impacts not only the employees but the community too because enron or that was such a big company 

450.65 451.78 B: like they 

451.81 459.11 B: like i figured out which company was it there's this one oil company somewhere in the midwest 

458.01 458.93 A: uh-huh 

459.20 470.89 B: and they somehow were corrupted and they had to go out of business and this town basically this company fed the town and after that the town went bankrupt 

471.89 475.96 B: it was actually pretty sad this happened when i think in the early nineties 

476.82 478.59 A: oh right 'cause i mean 

478.70 480.81 A: they're paying taxes and 

480.73 495.26 B: and all their workers and employees work live in this in the surrounding areas so this company's just putting so much money into businesses and the community and everything once that ah oil company was gone there's nothing there 

481.53 483.15 A: on their property 

495.67 501.64 B: for all the people i mean they still had little restaurants and shops and everything but nothing really big 

503.87 505.05 A: (( hm )) 

504.05 509.76 B: but yeah it's really crazy what's going on and like all of a sudden all these scandals are occurring 

511.26 521.68 B: and many of the companies from what i saw on ah m._s._n._b._c. or c._n._n. or something many of these companies are trying to cover up their actions now 

521.71 524.61 B: and turning over a new leaf so noone can find out 

529.56 532.26 B: it's really alarming how many companies are 

532.92 537.21 B: just stealing money from the company 

539.16 546.58 A: yeah i know and it's i think stealing is the right word too they they always use fancy words though when it comes to all these corporate crimes you know 

546.34 550.22 B: or ah borrowing without repaying 

549.44 551.74 A: [laughter] 

551.85 558.40 B: i think ah i somebody said something like that on ah m._s._n._b._c. or c._n._n. one of the two 

558.49 566.81 B: one of the execs were borrowing they loaned the company loaned they money to them but they didn't have to pay it back 

566.17 575.67 A: right they do that kind of thing all the time those companies a lot of those executives that's what they do they get that you know they get interest free loans that they never even have to repay 

569.74 570.58 B: yeah 

575.84 584.99 B: yeah it's all about how you word it you could borrow the money but you know they're not actually borrowing it they know they're not going to pay it back i mean 

587.44 590.35 B: yeah it's it's just crazy what's going on 

590.79 594.08 B: oh well i'm just wondering where are you located at 

593.44 597.24 A: ah ah ferndale michigan it's north of detroit 

595.94 596.98 B: oh okay 

598.14 599.89 B: i'm from dallas texas
