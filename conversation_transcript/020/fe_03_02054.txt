107.00 108.90 B: exactly yep

123.46 125.68 B: the garden we ah 

125.76 136.19 B: we moved into our house about a year ago so we haven't really done much in the backyard and i'm hoping you know that actually putting a garden in will make me want to go outside and piddle around for a while 

135.63 138.97 A: yeah i bet that would want you to be outside more 

138.82 144.72 B: yeah yeah right now i take the dog outside and that's about all the time i spend out there [laughter] 

144.08 145.47 A: yeah

161.19 162.38 B: (( yeah yep )) 

161.51 163.82 A: so i should be out there but 

164.13 174.88 B: yeah well you know we were i was outside for a while you know because i'm trying to visualize my garden and it you know it actually did get a little warm where i wanted to come back inside [laughter]

184.68 188.06 A: [laughter] but it's nice in texas though [noise] 

187.74 192.13 B: it is it is it really depends on the time of year you know and i guess 

191.36 192.35 A: yeah 

192.37 197.12 B: you know your activities are based on what time of the year it is and 

196.00 198.93 A: right if it's so hot out that you feel like you're melting 

198.97 199.83 A: then 

198.97 200.00 B: yeah 

199.86 203.84 A: of course you want to be inside and you are wishing for cooler weather [laughter] 

203.29 208.73 B: yeah yeah [laughter] and then when the cooler weather hits i'm sure you can't wait for summer to come 

208.49 213.10 A: right that's it exactly i gosh i haven't skied since i was a kid

266.05 266.88 A: yeah 

270.83 272.04 A: [laughter] 

272.04 280.69 B: [laughter] yeah but we don't have a boat so we we don't go out as often as we'd like unless we've got a friend who who's going out or something 

280.45 283.79 A: right we have a boat that we haven't used for 

284.21 288.92 A: seven years [laughter] because i don't like the water i really

357.62 358.48 A: (( ooh )) 

358.55 370.35 B: yeah but because she's been around the water and in the water so much she she swam to the steps and got out i mean she was a little upset and coughing and spluttering but she knew enough to swim to the edge 

359.20 359.97 A: [laughter] 

362.25 363.22 A: yeah 

368.07 368.97 A: yeah 

370.01 371.56 A: wow 

371.13 377.23 B: yeah but i i still think i'd be scared you know more apprehensive with kids around the water 

374.60 375.53 A: yeah 

376.88 379.08 A: yeah it is scary 

379.38 382.74 A: i don't want my fears to to be reflected on them 

379.40 380.58 B: (( got to keep them out )) 

382.74 383.89 B: yeah 

383.01 386.18 A: so it may be one of those things that their dad takes them 

386.29 387.43 B: yeah 

386.41 390.44 A: by himself [laughter] you know out the door guys 

387.94 390.07 B: well yeah do they know

399.60 406.55 A: and they had their water wings on i just saw pictures and i was like oh no you took them in the pool i'm glad i didn't know [laughter] 

406.29 410.96 B: ahah ahah yeah i think it's probably important though that they do learn how to swim 

410.65 411.80 A: yeah 

411.54 415.17 B: you know just for safety reasons yeah 

412.07 413.79 A: oh very important 

414.53 418.01 A: when you're a teenager and your friend throws you in the pool and 

417.59 419.36 B: (( exactly )) 

418.27 420.28 A: yeah that'd be pretty embarrassing 

420.23 426.04 B: yeah or you could to be a teenager and don't want to wish out on going to the lake with somebody and you know 

424.70 425.76 A: yeah 

426.18 429.17 B: accidentally fall in or whatever you know 

428.30 433.21 A: yeah end up half drowning in front of your friends that would be embarrassing 

431.39 432.97 B: yeah yeah 

433.11 442.36 B: yeah well you know just safety reasons too i hate to you know i hate to say that but i've but i heard um a lake around here that some 

442.48 448.58 B: people went or two guys went out on a jet ski you know and neither one of them knew how to swim 

445.95 446.98 A: mhm 

448.33 449.41 A: wow 

448.92 451.31 B: you know and then you know jet skis 

450.10 451.76 A: that's not real bright 

451.43 460.10 B: no it's not you know and you end up tipping over and can't get back on and you know you don't know how to swim there's a problem [laughter] 

459.09 460.96 A: yeah big problem [laughter] 

460.66 463.49 B: yeah i think that's just a safety issue 

463.14 464.37 A: yeah
