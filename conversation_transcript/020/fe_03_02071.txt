19.01 20.19 B: [laughter] 

20.00 28.38 A: with i i ski though so that's a lot of fun but i don't think it compares to like the outdoor warm weather sports 

28.19 29.38 B: right 

28.32 37.01 A: at all oh even not even limited to sports but outdoor activities jet skiing parasailing all that other stuff how 'bout yourself

40.34 42.78 B: i um i like 

42.81 46.21 B: warm weather a lot even though there's something 

46.53 48.41 B: very nice about how 

48.44 57.18 B: [lipsmack] like when it first starts to get cold and snow and stuff i really like like those like that first month and um 

50.68 51.83 A: mhm 

52.14 53.16 A: right 

53.27 54.20 A: [laughter] 

55.25 56.68 A: yeah 

57.70 61.41 B: 'cause i live up in uh pennsylvania now so it's definitely 

60.39 61.13 A: okay 

62.17 65.26 B: a lot um gets a lot colder than florida 

64.71 65.80 A: right 

65.54 67.44 B: (( [laughter] )) 

66.69 70.79 A: um do you do any type of uh winter outdoor activities 

70.87 76.43 B: um not really my friends made me ice skate this year 

72.34 73.26 A: okay 

76.06 76.93 A: okay 

76.52 81.99 B: [laughter] but that was about it as far as cold weather warm weather um 

82.94 86.11 B: [lipsmack] i play tennis and basketball 

84.10 84.98 A: okay 

85.44 86.47 A: (( oh okay )) 

86.13 87.33 B: and uh 

88.28 91.64 A: do you like basketball better indoors or outdoors on the court 

91.16 92.36 B: oh outdoors 

91.99 93.94 A: oh okay yeah yeah 

92.96 94.78 B: definitely [laughter] 

94.10 97.56 A: okay okay so i mean i feel like almost 

97.60 104.65 A: ooh i shouldn't say almost everyone but i think a large chunk of people would say outdoor activities in warm weather activities 

102.34 103.10 B: yeah 

104.21 105.45 B: yeah 

104.87 109.84 A: [laughter] except for like i guess the hardcore skiers or snowboarders or that type 

109.29 111.13 B: yeah 

110.64 114.20 A: but do you do any type a indoor activities on the regular 

114.88 117.41 B: um i don't [lipsmack] 

117.60 119.11 B: i don't think so 

118.47 120.17 A: no okay 

119.21 120.26 B: (( mm mm )) 

120.20 126.90 A: [laughter] 'cause um well with track we do indoor and outdoor track and it's a clear preference for outdoor track 

123.70 124.60 B: right 

126.61 127.68 B: yeah 

127.01 130.45 A: clear preference almost like most of the team so 

130.72 131.84 A: (( just i don't know )) 

132.48 143.59 A: indoors you kinda like same stale air [laughter] um outdoors it's open air circulates brighter it's like real light as opposed to fake light [laughter] so 

135.64 136.80 B: yeah 

142.54 146.35 B: yeah like even with swimming like when there's an indoor pool 

145.91 156.48 A: right right yeah definitely hands down i know outdoor is for me definitely um i think maybe if i was more if i wasn't uh 

147.04 148.08 B: yeah 

151.02 151.98 B: yeah 

156.52 169.11 A: so scared of the cold i'm originally from montreal which sounds ridiculous because it's cold [laughter] but if i wasn't so scared of the cold i'd go skiing much more often but um it's a lot of fun but i don't know if the weather 

161.25 162.49 B: [laughter] 

165.60 166.56 B: yeah 

169.28 170.99 A: part of it [laughter] 

171.11 176.55 A: i'd much rather just enjoy the sun the heat and whatever activity i'm doing yeah 

175.41 176.74 B: yeah 

177.34 178.42 B: um 

178.53 181.07 B: i'm actually going to montreal this summer

183.91 185.02 B: yeah 

185.29 187.35 B: okay [laughter] 

185.75 191.94 A: yeah that's the thing i get from most people it's clean so and there's a lot of stuff to do 

188.94 189.85 B: yeah 

192.15 192.99 B: right 

192.22 193.85 A: (( a lot of stuff to do ))

194.36 195.84 A: how long're you gonna go for

199.12 199.89 A: okay 

200.92 211.27 A: okay okay yeah it's definitely and it's a co- it's real compact so like a lot of the stuff you're gonna wanna do is in the vicinity probably of where you will stay if you're staying in a hotel like downtown 

209.08 210.14 B: mhm 

211.05 212.08 B: right 

211.52 216.64 A: you'll get like access to everything you wanna do you don't need a car you'll be fine 

216.64 217.78 B: good 

217.13 224.70 A: so that's what i mean if you have a car that's a perk but it's not like a mandatory type of thing like i heard l._a. like you need a car 

220.07 221.11 B: yeah 

224.76 226.99 A: and montreal's just not like that so

307.37 308.93 A: did you ever ice skate 

308.62 311.95 B: see when my friends took me this winter there's this um 

312.20 314.17 B: place called pens landing 

313.80 314.71 A: okay 

314.25 318.20 B: and um there's like a ice rink around there in the winter 

317.82 318.80 A: okay 

318.36 324.95 B: and it's right off of the water so it was i don't know just seemed i don't i didn't like it [laughter] 

323.96 332.29 A: you didn't like it too much is that was that your first time skating oh okay it's weird i feel like when you're really good it's fun 

326.23 327.39 B: yeah

334.23 341.71 A: unless you're like a really little kid then you'll be you'll have fun no matter what but um it hurts your ankles if you don't um 

337.39 338.47 B: yeah 

342.11 353.43 A: have proper like form and whatnot so after a few hours or after like an hour and a bit if you're like um not the best of best skater it will you'll feel it 

344.10 345.17 B: (( mhm )) 

352.90 361.41 B: yeah and i don't i don't feel that it's right to wear like huge razors on your feet either [laughter] 

353.48 354.53 A: so 

358.07 362.93 A: (( oh [laughter] right right right right [laughter] )) 

362.24 369.79 B: i don't know that combination me and huge razors would not have worked out [laughter] if i had done this like 

366.81 368.29 A: right 

369.14 370.41 A: [laughter] 

369.82 371.59 B: too many times [laughter] 

371.70 381.21 A: i don't know i feel like everything like that's uh the winter version i can find like something summery that matches up so like ice skating or roller skating i prefer roller skating [laughter] 

377.77 378.67 B: yeah 

380.87 382.02 B: yeah 

381.40 385.22 A: um see now if we come down to 

385.53 386.93 A: skiing 

386.91 391.97 A: it's like i guess you can put water skiing uh they're two totally different things though 

391.08 392.50 B: yeah 

391.89 403.72 A: so i don't know if you'd really wanna match that up but like yeah basketball indoors versu- versus basketball outdoors definitely outdoors i can't imagine playing soccer indoors so i don't know i feel like 

395.25 396.10 B: (( yeah )) 

401.88 402.98 B: no 

403.87 408.42 A: the outdoor type summer thing works really well it's a nice combo 

408.29 411.38 B: yeah i bet most people say that 

411.01 413.27 A: yeah i i would suspect 

412.85 414.06 B: [laughter] 

413.34 415.80 A: (( that's the case actually yeah )) 

415.85 420.58 A: yeah any other activities you're fond of or like to do
