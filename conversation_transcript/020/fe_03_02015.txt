24.64 36.16 A: [laughter] um they said they want to know um originally they said something about corporate america and their conduct and with the scandals that are going on right now in corporate america what can the government do 

36.24 37.28 B: (( oh okay )) 

36.31 38.80 A: to help in these kind of situations 

38.77 39.77 B: okay

40.60 41.75 B: (( oh okay )) 

41.77 42.67 B: um 

42.78 43.95 B: (( let me see )) 

44.02 46.30 B: well like the enron stuff that went on 

45.96 49.17 A: right and they want to know if it's affected us personally 

49.01 61.35 B: well personally i don't think it has but yet you know kinda gets it kinda scares the people that are working for these companies you know corporations and stuff into getting like not investing with them like their stocks buying stocks with them and everything 

61.09 62.09 A: right 

61.23 68.31 B: i think it does affect them during the you know i'd be scared if i was working with a big corporation and you know how they do that 401k you 

68.04 68.99 A: right 

68.75 73.27 B: know you buy the stock and i would be scared of putting my money to them you know 

73.63 75.28 A: right 'cause you don't know 

74.14 75.17 B: i don't know 

75.19 77.12 B: you don't know 'cause you can lose it all 

77.09 78.02 A: oh yeah 

77.39 79.86 B: like these people it's like god 

80.39 81.93 A: i mean even you know 

82.15 88.17 A: [cough] i don't work in corporate america right now but even job wise and stuff you just don't know what the people over you are doing 

87.98 90.45 B: yeah yeah 

88.76 91.33 A: you know and what your name can be involved in or 

91.39 92.70 A: a part of 

92.30 93.81 B: yeah that's true 

92.89 97.45 A: but i have to say they say what can the government do and i think oh my gosh you know our last president 

97.51 105.74 A: you know he lied he did all these things shredded documents [laughter] i mean he did everything these enron people were doing and we didn't even 

105.94 109.17 A: do a thing to him he wasn't even impeached you know it's like 

108.27 110.50 B: that's true yeah 

109.69 120.45 A: so what is the government going to do to stop another enron crisis you know or scandal or you know catastrophe is what it is a lot of people have lost money jobs everything in that 

120.31 122.76 B: yeah yeah 

120.90 123.12 A: you know i don't think our government 

123.65 132.50 A: right now i mean it could improve um i have hope [laughter] but i don't think our government really has you know they have to keep themselves in order 

127.81 129.20 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

132.37 134.79 B: yeah they do yeah i mean 

133.75 137.03 A: before they can before they can move into corporate america 

135.18 136.15 B: go into 

136.60 138.82 B: yeah yeah that's true 

137.83 142.82 A: you know i mean in all reality our government is our role model 

143.03 147.61 B: that's true that's true they need to get their stuff together before they can go and run somebody else's 

147.59 148.78 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

147.90 149.75 B: (( business i guess [laughter] )) 

149.62 150.54 A: right 

149.79 153.03 B: fix their business and then try to fix somebody else's you know 

153.02 163.51 A: right so it's very hard to say i don't think the government could do anything you know i mean once things are brought into the light we need a judicial system who will truly be fair and honest and really bring these people 

156.47 158.35 B: yeah 

163.57 169.00 A: you know some conviction upon them and you know have them serve some kind of sentence but at that point you know 

168.12 169.59 B: yeah 

169.79 172.39 A: you know at that point what happens you know [laughter] 

171.61 173.82 B: that's true that's true [laughter] 

173.28 175.87 A: you know most of it's gone the damage is done 

177.06 179.41 B: and the people just have to get start over you know 

179.32 187.83 A: right and if anybody does get brought to justice they're going to go to a federal penitentiary and play golf and pool [laughter] at the taxpayer's expense 

186.42 189.47 B: yeah that's true that's true i think they should 

188.04 190.44 A: have you ever seen a federal penitentiary 

190.11 192.54 B: yes [laughter] 

190.81 193.94 A: yeah i've visited a couple [laughter] and it's like oh come on 

193.76 203.20 B: yeah i think they should put them with the regular people [laughter] the regular criminals because i mean it's it's a crime like there's for other people lose their live you know their livelihood i guess right 

196.63 197.77 A: (( it's like )) 

203.47 206.62 B: it's like taking away their life from them kind of sort of you know 

206.36 207.23 A: right 

206.92 207.78 B: so 

207.89 211.70 B: that's true they should i they should put them with the regular people so 

211.58 212.43 A: right 

213.36 216.77 A: that's for sure you know that might do a little bit more you know 

216.07 218.13 B: scare them [laughter] 

217.28 219.50 A: you see we don't have you know it's 

219.84 229.24 A: corporate peoples from what i see reading papers and just you know history corporate people seem to really get off with their crimes 

228.06 228.89 B: (( mm )) 

228.97 230.08 B: yes they do 

229.77 244.56 A: you know so it doesn't stop the next guy to say you know well i can embezzle i can go spend five years in a nice little resort [laughter] and come back and my money will be and my money will be laundered somewhere and i could start all over again right they they often get they're the ones that get the pardon 

236.42 237.39 B: uh-huh 

238.02 239.44 B: and start all over again 

242.07 242.89 B: yeah 

244.60 245.65 B: yeah 

245.06 247.82 A: and they get to start all over again you know 

246.75 249.77 B: yeah that that's true that's true 

252.38 253.32 B: i mean 

252.67 256.82 A: so i don't know i don't know what do you think do you think our government could do something [laughter] 

254.00 254.84 B: i know 

256.59 265.30 B: i don't think so they need to get their stuff you know fixed before they can go into somebody else's business you know fix their stuff then you know 

263.34 264.19 A: right 

265.93 269.98 B: work on somebody else's i think it would be very very hard to do that 

270.13 270.99 A: right 

270.36 272.01 B: very very hard 

272.25 272.86 A: (( [cough] )) 

273.97 279.74 A: you know and i mean it's it is a scary thing to invest and so forth when you know there's so much corruption right now 

279.44 281.12 B: yeah 

281.20 282.73 A: and then just 

281.35 282.22 B: (( you don't know [laughter] )) 

283.09 286.69 A: you know you wonder where your investments are actually going [laughter] too you know 

285.74 288.68 B: i know i know that's true 

288.79 290.35 A: (( you know so )) 

288.96 295.49 B: that's true 'cause you don't know if you're going to get them at the end you know when you do retire or you're going to move on to another job or something you don't know what's gonna happen 

295.52 296.46 A: right 

295.88 301.41 B: and it's good on paper but then when you finally go and try to take it out or whatever it may not be there 

301.52 302.44 A: right 

303.12 305.04 A: this is true you know 

305.51 306.37 A: um 

306.56 309.36 A: i don't know i guess in my mind i've always 

309.92 313.33 A: you know i'm not opposed to you know and we did have a 401k for a while 

313.39 317.75 A: but um [cough] i really trust more in in property 

317.95 319.12 B: yeah that's 

318.11 319.77 A: investing in property 

319.37 321.41 B: yeah that's true that's true 

321.11 324.02 A: and i know we can't all do that but i you know 

322.89 325.19 B: yeah yeah 

324.42 327.74 A: especially with all these shake ups and just the uncertainty 

327.35 328.50 B: yeah 

327.89 328.86 A: you know 

329.15 330.03 A: um 

329.29 341.02 B: but the thing is they these companies make it look good you know like okay invest in the 401k you know we're going to match you know eighty per cent of what you know you put in and stuff like that so it's tempting to these people right 

341.34 342.26 B: so 

342.49 343.38 B: i don't know 

343.78 344.87 A: right 

344.79 346.06 B: very tempting 

346.49 347.88 A: (( it it's it's ah )) 

347.11 349.19 B: they kind of lure you into it you know 

349.08 350.15 A: right 

350.81 358.16 A: and you know i mean just because you know you see enron and you see whitewater you see you know all these different things you know that we've had um 

358.87 367.63 A: there's been a lot of companies that have just you know folded left and right and a lot of them because they haven't been you know managing their funds properly or other people's funds properly 

367.17 368.35 B: (( mhm )) 

367.73 368.68 A: um 

368.85 373.41 A: you know but then there are still you know there are still a lot of good 

373.89 381.09 A: good companies out there you know but you know people like arthur anderson ruin it for everyone and then it's not everyone within that company either 

378.74 379.58 B: (( yes )) 

380.75 382.15 B: yeah 

381.54 383.87 A: who should have the bad name you know 

383.22 384.31 B: yeah 

384.53 385.63 A: (( so you )) 

384.60 386.02 B: just certain ones 

386.46 387.94 A: know it's um 

388.92 392.01 A: i guess i think just having more um 

392.52 394.94 A: more more of their records made public 

394.79 398.70 B: yeah yeah not be so secretive 

398.72 404.22 A: right and even like you know the people in the upper levels you know even

407.57 411.71 A: more things revealed about them as well you can tell a lot about a person 

409.82 412.49 B: yeah like an open book right like an open book

416.00 417.89 A: their private life you know 

418.40 421.46 A: as far as if you can trust them you know 

420.94 423.11 B: mhm mhm 

421.98 424.83 A: 'cause you're talking about trusting them with your [laughter]
