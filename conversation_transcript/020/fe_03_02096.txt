5.16 7.68 B: good i am susan and i'm from indiana 

7.41 11.27 A: [laughter] nice to meet you my name is mariko and i'm from california 

10.53 15.32 B: hi wow i'm getting to talk to people from all over this is so fun [laughter] 

13.15 21.06 A: [laughter] it is actually i talked to a woman yesterday from washington so i was like yeah that's pretty neat it was neat 

17.52 19.17 B: (( [noise] wow )) 

19.28 25.09 B: yeah [noise] yeah i talked to someone from texas and from georgia i think so yeah [laughter] 

24.21 31.93 A: it's neat actually talking to different people because you get different personalities and you get different accents and it's it's nice it's really nice 

27.57 28.59 B: yes 

28.72 29.98 B: yes 

30.56 36.42 B: [laughter] i know i've had fun doing it too so well tell me about you and friends [laughter] 

35.33 39.63 A: well this is actually a really good time to talk about it i'm on my way to my 

39.71 46.35 A: best friend's house right now and um i've known her since gosh since we were like five years old 

41.38 42.73 B: oh 

45.71 46.93 B: (( wow yes [noise] )) 

46.56 50.81 A: the thing is we are so different to a point where um 

50.80 53.01 A: we shouldn't even be friends 

52.15 53.20 B: yes 

52.88 53.75 A: (( um )) 

53.62 55.68 A: you know i don't have a lot of 

55.47 69.40 A: i you know i have a lot of acquaintances but i don't consider many people my friend exactly um because i think when you say that you have a lot of friends it's spreading yourself too thin basically because a friendship is a really important thing 

58.90 60.39 B: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

64.92 66.79 B: yeah yeah 

69.13 70.94 B: [noise] right [noise] 

69.34 83.96 A: to me it is so um i think i keep this friend my best friend mainly because i love her she's more like family than anything else but with newer people that i have it's it's more i ought to call them acquaintances rather than friends from the start 

76.25 77.31 B: yes 

83.26 84.62 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

84.44 91.33 A: so you know i have a small intimate group of friends that are really friends and everyone else they're just acquaintances 

87.81 88.63 B: (( yeah )) 

90.51 91.53 B: yeah 

91.64 99.19 B: i would feel similarly and i bet you're real close with her even though you're so different do you think it's because probably you became friends when you were so little 

91.88 92.90 A: [laughter] 

99.18 105.92 A: yes if i would have met her um let's say if i met her a week ago we wouldn't be friends at all 

99.93 100.98 B: yeah 

103.65 104.48 B: yes 

105.28 112.11 B: yeah because you're totally different types of people that's ne- yeah childhood experiences i think are real bonding kind of issues so 

107.01 108.07 A: we are 

111.58 114.77 A: mhm they're hard to break also so 

112.41 116.63 B: yeah yeah yeah that's true [laughter] 

115.90 129.63 A: but you know what i was one point that i was going to make 'cause when i was younger i'm not very old now [laughter] but when i was in high school or junior high you know everybody's your friend you met some somebody once you're like oh i know this my friend over here you know 

120.64 121.50 B: uh-huh 

125.65 126.73 B: yes 

128.65 129.89 B: uh-huh 

129.59 134.31 A: and they might not even remember you but when you're younger you think that everybody's your friend 

133.54 139.70 B: right well you know what i think too it's because you're at school all the time so you're forced to be with everybody [laughter] so 

136.98 137.76 A: mhm 

138.88 142.38 A: oh that's that's a good point i never really thought of it that way 

141.91 156.16 B: yeah well see my point in the spectrum now is i'm a mom with three kids and i'm home all the time so it's sort of like i don't get a whole lot of chance [noise] to get out and well the friends i already have i'm really grateful for because [laughter] 'cause i'm kinda grounded now 

146.47 149.90 A: (( [noise] mhm [noise] mhm )) 

154.06 156.50 A: (( mhm but )) 

156.53 162.37 A: you know what it's it's also um a lot of your friends do they have kids also or no 

162.74 173.48 B: [laughter] yea- a lot of them do although a lot of the people that i know because of their kids we're more acquaintances because i've found that with having little kids at least you can't really visit with a person that much [laughter] 

167.84 169.65 A: mhm 

172.65 174.45 A: [laughter] no no 

173.48 183.60 B: you know there's the ki- in fact even now once we started talking two of my kids came in from outside the two year old and three year old and i just walked upstairs and closed the door [laughter] 

181.96 188.65 A: that's important right right now my daughter's in the car and i told her i'm like i'm going to be on the phone really fast is that okay with you and she said okay 

184.45 185.36 B: yes 

186.43 187.86 B: yes [laughter] 

188.43 190.23 B: how old is she 

188.57 203.40 A: and the friend that i'm she's seven years old i have i know this sounds really strange 'cause everybody says this about their kids either your kid's a perfect angel or they're a devil mine is an angel all the way through [laughter] but one of things that my friend and i the one that i'm going to right now 

190.69 192.28 B: oh that's neat 

195.80 196.70 B: yes 

196.75 197.85 B: (( yes [laughter] )) 

197.92 198.70 B: oh 

198.74 199.57 B: oh 

203.35 207.68 A: is she has two little kids and one way born fourteen days before my daughter 

205.26 205.98 B: (( okay )) 

207.26 208.74 B: oh neat 

207.67 213.09 A: and the other one is three so that's really another reason why i go over there so my daughter has someone to grow up with 

212.51 213.97 B: oh yes 

213.08 227.66 A: um but with my friend her is just really hard because she always wants to go out and i'm i'm more grounded i love staying home with my daughter i love it you know i love doing things with my kids so in fact what i'm doing right now is going over to pick up her daughter 

218.62 220.06 B: oh yes oh 

221.66 222.52 B: yes 

223.88 225.11 B: uh-huh 

227.42 228.92 B: okay 

227.67 233.82 A: and to take them out you know so i [laughter] a lot of my friends like 

229.42 231.48 B: [laughter] 

234.06 242.17 A: the friends that i do have they all have kids but they are more similar to what i like to do and take doing things with the kids and themselves so 

239.91 245.61 B: yeah yeah that's true that's true and that's wonderful that she would be so accommodating wh- 

245.71 247.07 B: [laughter] 

245.82 260.02 A: well you know i have a lot of i you know love care of you know as long as i think kids are more important than actual friendships [laughter] so if i see kids that are not being treated very well i would i have no problem giving up my free time to take them to do something fun 

252.10 253.13 B: yeah 

258.83 264.37 B: yeah [lipsmack] right and that well then how wonderful for them we need people like that you know [laughter] 

261.77 262.84 A: (( it is )) 

263.16 272.08 A: it's fr- you know what little kids are great because how we treat them to tie it back in to like the whole group of friendship is how they're going to treat their friends when they're older 

269.08 270.06 B: (( yeah )) 

271.65 280.08 B: well that's true that's very true and you want to treat your children well yeah because you want them to see that and hopefully they will they will treat you that way too [laughter] 

273.02 274.13 A: (( so )) 

278.94 289.40 A: exactly i see oh my goodness i just had my daughter's seventh birthday party last like i believe two weeks ago and you would not believe how many kids i saw badmouthing their parents 

288.87 290.42 B: oh gosh 

289.38 298.50 A: like a couple of the parents got lost and one of the moms told me that their daughter was saying mom you're stupid you can't find the house and [mn] 

296.57 300.48 B: oh gee and this is seven years old i mean [laughter] 

298.49 304.59 A: yes and i was so shocked i was thinking if my daughter ever said anything like that to me i would be 

300.90 301.95 B: (( oh gosh )) 

303.37 307.18 B: yeah [laughter] [laughter] that would not be good 

305.33 306.71 A: i would be [laughter] 

306.74 308.30 A: (( no it wasn't )) 

307.76 312.93 B: well and you need to get on it now you know because otherwise you're going to have a teenager that [laughter] 

308.33 309.10 A: (( so )) 

311.36 312.01 A: (( [noise] )) 

312.47 315.69 A: oh do you what's the age of your oldest child 

315.21 321.83 B: um well actually she is five and she'll be six in about a week so actually our kids aren't that much different [laughter] 

318.78 320.69 A: (( oh congratulations )) 

321.27 327.83 A: it's i'm sorry but it's fun if i could i would have more kids now but i have to wait till i finish school [noise] 

323.31 325.49 B: oh it's neat 

327.18 341.00 B: yeah well see you're smart i was older i was thirty two when i had my first so yeah i'm like an older mom but i didn't get married till i was thirty one so but that's neat to get your schooling out of the way 'cause isn't it hard with ki- lot of study and all that gosh 

335.20 336.27 A: [noise] see i wish 

340.23 349.42 A: you know what the study isn't so mu- so bad because i can do it in the night time but i i'm trying to tie everything back [laughter] to to this whole topic of friendship because i'm not sure what the 

344.52 345.46 B: mhm 

347.54 351.35 B: yes you're good [laughter] i always go off on a tangent [laughter] 

349.32 351.54 A: i'm not sure what they're listening for 

351.32 364.56 A: but um at school it's like i noti- a lot of the people that i meet you know they they're just so different than myself and the ones that don't have kids so i really don't i can't call them friends because we don't relate on any level 

355.05 356.11 B: right 

360.83 361.92 B: (( yes )) 

363.78 372.09 B: right right i can see how that would be really hard but that's really interesting yeah yeah i'd probably say my best friend is a lady who i um 

364.69 367.05 A: (( so )) 

367.07 367.87 A: yes 

372.11 375.18 B: taught with because i was a teacher before i had kids 

374.98 386.28 A: (( uh-huh oh )) 

375.16 380.89 B: and we it's kinda funny too because we don't have that much in common she's the age of my mom 

380.73 395.21 B: and the year i quit teaching to have my daughter was the year she retired from teaching but um even now we get together once a month and we'll go out to lunch and we call a lot and back when we were teaching like we went to london one year over christmas break and 

395.04 398.87 B: i don't know we just had you know it's not somebody who's my age 

398.93 405.71 B: range so i wouldn't think they'd be a friend but she's ended up to be the best friend so yeah like you said there's really no predicting in friendships 

484.64 485.21 A: (( [noise] ))
