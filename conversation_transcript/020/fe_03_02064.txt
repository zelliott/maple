188.23 194.13 A: the difference you know penns- being in pennsylvania and outdoor activities 

194.01 207.63 A: like you could tolerate it here like forget about the summertime like like up there i'm sure in the summertime you go camping and things like that and it's nice and here if you go it is just too hot and the humidity 

202.60 203.43 B: right 

207.50 213.52 A: it like last week we actually had a nice week there wasn't any humidity but that i don't like humidity 

213.45 219.46 B: right very seldom do we ever get where it's just so terrible that you can't stand it 

218.76 219.98 A: oh really 

219.48 221.39 B: i mean a little bit but 

221.08 222.52 A: well maybe the missour- 

221.56 224.20 B: like a couple a weeks [laughter] 

223.03 231.14 A: yeah that that wouldn't be too bad like miss- you know i was mostly from pennsylvania new jersey and there's a lot of humidity there 

231.20 233.81 A: so maybe missouri's the place to be 

234.10 235.61 A: (( for outdoors )) 

234.53 238.50 B: well i've never lived anywhere else [laughter] i can't say 

236.18 239.90 A: oh really yeah [laughter] i 

238.85 241.65 B: [laughter] i've never talked to any of the others [laughter] 

241.05 241.94 A: really 

241.90 255.74 A: i lived new jersey pennsylvania and florida and the difference between what you do like in inside i'm inside a lot [laughter] other you know other than so i've learned uh to do crafts and and uh 

251.48 252.33 B: yeah 

255.67 268.33 A: now my friend's got me into scrapbooking so you know for myself i think i'm more the indoorsy type you know than than being outside i do that kind of for my kids like [laughter] kinda grin and bear it 

262.37 263.25 B: right 

268.17 270.67 B: [laughter] go when you can [laughter] 

269.94 272.37 A: yeah yeah yeah or

288.53 289.69 A: right 

289.95 291.31 A: (( right so you have to )) 

290.29 293.41 B: my son plays out would rather play outside all day

293.65 294.72 B: [laughter] 

299.02 307.60 A: i tend to wonder what it would be like because mine are always my boys are always on the go outside in dirt and [laughter] 

304.22 306.79 B: (( completely different [laughter] )) 

307.00 309.44 B: it's completely different [laughter] 

308.39 318.96 A: yeah i mean i was mostly indoor kind of person until obviously they started playing ball and and that's gotten me and and i go you know like my little one's in t-ball so 

318.74 329.00 A: you know i go to the practices and my husband coaches it so i'll get out there on the field with them and things like that but that's about you know as much outdoor kinda weather that i like
