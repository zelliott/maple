7.39 20.12 B: uh you know i've got i've got to admit i did i was [mn] just putting on a headphone here and i i and missed the first the last part of uh where they were talking about what the questions were and i and when 

20.53 23.47 B: i'd been waiting for about a half hour how about you 

23.47 27.90 A: [sigh] you know it just um it just took about a minute 

27.40 28.78 B: oh really

37.49 38.34 B: (( now )) 

38.55 42.33 B: question can you can you tell me a bit questions i 

42.71 45.16 A: well i think it to tell 

45.51 56.21 A: you the truth they went so fast that i don't know if i caught all of it i just know that the topic was about corporate scandal current corporate scandal 

55.74 64.87 B: oh current corporate scandal okay okay i i read that when i was reading about the ones okay current corporate scandal interesting 

64.34 78.48 A: so you know i really and and like i said she read through this stuff so fast that i didn't get a chance to you know hone in on what the topics were under that under the topic 

75.60 78.29 B: right right yeah 

78.41 82.23 B: (( yeah is this your first is this your first call or have you )) 

79.08 79.91 A: and 

81.55 83.96 A: yes it is this is my first one 

82.99 84.09 B: yeah 

84.46 96.13 A: really the only thing that i can think of um i i i live in the dallas fort worth area and i right now we're going through the whole thing with um 

84.51 85.36 B: uh 

96.16 101.00 A: american airlines facing bankruptcy and so really uh 

97.97 99.40 B: right 

101.11 114.67 A: you know their c._e._o. resigned recently donald carty and he resigned because you know he didn't um reveal uh and that's all their you know salary cutbacks 

105.53 106.50 B: right 

114.62 120.35 A: as employees he didn't reveal that you know like the top executives were getting all these benefits 

120.14 121.27 B: right 

120.90 121.86 A: so 

121.95 127.17 A: you know that's i that's really the only thing that i can think of right now that's going on 

125.75 130.14 B: well yeah well i think tha- i think that's a pretty important one i uh 

130.12 141.61 B: i i think um yeah [sigh] i felt like if i had been an employee who had been asked to take a salary cut in that situation 

141.98 144.30 B: i would really 

144.59 148.33 B: you know [laughter] i'd be very angry 

148.58 151.66 A: yeah and the- these employees were taking 

151.82 159.65 A: as much as a fifty fifteen per cent reduction in their salary which for someone who is lower to middle class 

155.22 156.28 B: yeah 

159.62 169.92 A: that's going to pack a larger punch than you know if you were an executive and you you didn't get you know as large of a bonus at the end of the year 

169.74 170.73 B: yeah 

170.23 174.38 A: you know because it it's a bonus after all it's not your salary and so mhm 

173.44 184.12 B: right exactly well you know and and the thing was uh the thing is i think what what's interesting to me about that is that when you compare it to the rest of the world 

184.14 196.96 B: there just isn't that kind of discrepancy yeah it it's fine you know somebody who is an executive who puts in long hours who we hope is is uh you know doing well for the company 

196.68 197.64 A: yeah 

197.20 211.57 B: is worth more money but are they really worth three hundred times or whatever you know the m- amazing amount of uh times compared to you know if you look you know just recently read where like in you know in japan 

211.53 215.90 B: you know the difference between what the lowest and the highest price 

215.93 220.16 B: paid employee is making is not nearly that kind of difference 

217.73 218.75 A: yeah 

220.21 230.93 A: yeah it it's really i mean i understand why all of those employees demanded that he resign and he did he just did that yesterday but 

226.99 228.00 B: right 

231.10 232.74 A: in terms of 

233.05 236.11 A: how do you restrict that when you're a private company you 

235.99 238.76 B: yeah that's right yeah that's 

237.49 246.25 A: know i mean and you know the government can't really restrict that unless you're an employee owned kind of company 

241.38 243.18 B: no no 

246.57 250.21 A: and i know there's a few out there like that where you know 

250.26 254.38 A: you could probably like the c._e._o. couldn't make like you know 

255.01 259.91 A: his salary couldn't exceed ten times the salary of you know their lowest paid individual or something 

259.45 261.23 B: right 

260.38 265.48 A: that there's really no when you are talking about private enterprise there's really no way to restrict that 

265.35 275.83 B: right well i i think that is is you know ultimately the question as far as as private enterprise is you know what what what does 

276.14 277.68 B: a corporation 

277.87 280.74 B: ethically owe to 

280.84 290.71 B: uh its employees to you know to society i mean you know where uh you know where you know where where do we draw you the line you know 

290.30 291.17 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

290.86 295.28 B: ah in a free enterprise system between you know it it's 

295.31 301.95 B: and i'm thinking you know i think i think there's very few people who would kind of say anything goes right i mean that's sort of the far out end 

299.89 300.54 A: (( mhm )) 

301.78 302.78 A: mhm 

302.68 311.88 B: and then you know and then to to a completely controlled corporation so so you know where where how do you 

312.19 321.25 B: get it [mn] in between and um you know a a moderate viewpoint that that where people will really feel good about that 

321.71 330.12 A: yeah it well [mn] at least one thing that america does have going for it or or at least the employees is the unions you know 

329.40 330.38 B: right 

330.06 345.02 A: that flight attendants as well as other like maintenance workers they are unionized so at least you know they do have that when they come to the bargaining table i mean they do have that power of a union and they can negotiate and 

334.71 335.86 B: right 

342.50 343.69 B: yeah 

345.15 348.82 A: [mn] so i mean at least that's there but 

347.75 358.24 B: right and that that that does provide a balance you know it's um i know are you are y- i'm i'm not in a union my husband is in a union my husband is a teacher and he's in a union 

357.85 362.79 A: oh really no i'm not i'm not in an occupation where i could be in a union 

363.09 364.19 B: yeah 

363.50 365.91 A: um but uh 

366.46 367.72 A: (( i [mn] )) 

368.34 383.02 A: i don't know how other corporations work though i mean you know i'm kind of because i live here and i'm familiar with like you know the big employers in town but i don't know if like you know like i._b._m. or um you know 

383.27 392.05 A: compaq or [mn] other companies are are they unionized i don't know because because that i think may be a good way to like 

387.77 388.76 B: right 

392.40 395.98 A: you know al- always protect the interests of the 

396.00 399.25 A: (( le- [laughter] the lemon on the totem pole [laughter] )) 

396.31 397.27 B: yeah 

398.45 410.65 B: [laughter] i think you know i i think you know that that can in- that's interesting because my i know my sister who is a professional who but who is unionized she's a reporter and she will always 

410.64 423.38 B: c- comment to me you know when she's talking about like the kind of benefits that she has and she'll say you know well you know uh that's because i've got the union you know and and there and there in there in fact is 

415.94 416.73 A: yeah 

420.33 421.28 A: yeah 

423.31 425.76 B: some kinds of protection there 

425.87 426.76 A: yeah 

427.50 428.48 A: yeah 

427.51 428.72 B: and i i you 

428.96 429.82 B: know 

430.48 435.97 A: well and i think the unions here put a lot of pressure on the c._e._o. to resign 

430.63 431.61 B: uh 

435.83 436.92 B: right 

436.07 446.33 A: so there i think they're really effective in trying to get a you know trying to oust the existing leadership and i don't know who is you know going to take over for them 

438.62 439.81 B: right 

446.30 452.07 A: but at least they worry it will take that much pressure you know to make him resign 

451.82 452.98 B: right 

452.21 457.46 A: um so anyway i don't know that that's really the only um 

454.63 455.35 B: (( yes )) 

457.87 460.58 A: company that comes to mind right now 

459.39 471.71 B: right well yeah the whole enron thing to me is is so sort of [sigh] you know i mean it it's almost be- you know you hear enron and it's become oh kind of a a 

471.76 483.82 B: a symbol of what the problem is with corporate corporate america but i'm not sure how how well i understand it and i think you're right i think the american airlines one is is just so 

483.97 493.73 B: so out there and so obvious you know we know that this is wrong and i mean i know i know that that the enron thing was you know part of it was with 

493.73 503.73 B: uh stock options and you know it was people knowing that they you know that they were selling the stock because they knew it was going down and yet the the 

503.11 503.99 A: yeah 

503.98 516.91 B: the other people having having their money in their pension plans and i guess that's the other thing about the corporate scandals that i think about and i'm i'm fifty five i'm you know so i i start thinking about retirement 

516.41 517.86 A: oh certainly 

517.59 527.78 B: and people who people who've lost their entire you know all they you know they thought that the corporation was going to be protect them that their pension plan was 

525.85 526.88 A: yeah 

527.87 533.79 B: safe and what happened to the pension plans of so many employees 

533.68 538.85 A: i know [mn] that's enough like hard core reality i 

533.91 534.59 B: (( the )) 

538.53 539.78 B: yeah 

539.04 544.75 A: mean i just i don't i i don't know what i would have done or what i would do in that situation 

544.61 545.98 B: yeah yeah 

545.18 551.02 A: i mean how do you start all over you can't get your fifty five years back or whatever you know 

547.19 548.33 B: right 

550.03 561.85 B: right peop- people that that thought that you know they had um for you know for so long uh given so much to a company you know and i think that and even you know even 

561.73 570.76 B: [mn] you know my my father's generation you know my father you know who where where there was that that idea that that the company you know 

570.59 577.70 B: re- you know you gave to the company and the company gave back to you and and there there was just a a feeling that 

575.72 576.90 A: yeah 

576.92 581.67 A: mhm yeah and there's very few companies now that you see that 

581.37 582.89 B: right 

581.88 588.65 A: really i mean i i used to work for a little while for um radio shack uh 

588.15 589.03 B: uh 

588.78 599.89 A: too which is also based in fort worth as a technical writer and now i have to say that that company is just very very um old sc- old school 

591.50 592.49 B: right
