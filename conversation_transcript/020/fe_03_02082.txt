338.15 339.16 B: okay 

339.57 348.41 A: and it seemed like a lot of fun you know it gives you this rush when you um [lipsmack] go down very quickly on 

348.48 357.90 A: down the hill uh really really fun and i'm still not very good at it 'cause i can't afford to go snowboarding all the time [laughter] 

349.44 350.44 B: okay 

356.99 360.47 B: oh yeah well yeah i i can imagine there are some expenses on 

359.44 370.78 A: yeah it's expensive and i'm a student but um i live in flagstaff and we have a resort right here it's not very big but it's really nice so 

369.89 370.77 B: huh 

371.18 373.97 A: i [lipsmack] sometimes i go [laughter] 

373.67 376.60 B: sounds like fun it sounds like fun

383.70 384.67 A: uh-huh 

384.21 386.88 B: i i've i'm way into safety 

386.88 399.39 A: [laughter] yeah that's that's one thing that you know like sometimes i don't go because i realize i don't have insurance right now and if i was to get hurt then i would be in trouble [laughter] 

387.29 388.76 B: [laughter] 

398.64 400.73 B: that that could be expensive 

399.32 405.43 A: and you can get hurt really really easily a lot of my friends this this past winter 

404.61 405.71 B: oh my 

405.82 408.08 A: so yeah [laughter] 

407.28 413.67 B: huh that that is one of the dangers but uh like i said now i do i do enjoy swimming 

414.06 415.05 A: okay 

414.53 420.97 B: it's just that i'm not too fond of the lake and i'm only what a mile or two from the lake 

421.15 423.31 A: oh really where are you from 

423.05 425.73 B: i'm in northwest indiana 

425.10 426.14 A: okay

430.28 431.03 A: mhm 

430.99 432.19 B: and 

431.13 433.59 A: is that like a beach where people 

432.76 434.96 B: yes a beautiful beach 

434.11 434.72 A: (( okay )) 

434.78 435.79 A: wow 

435.18 440.45 B: the dunes are there it's very lovely but i just don't spend any time there 

437.74 438.56 A: (( mm )) 

440.64 441.55 A: mm 

441.04 442.19 B: people who 

442.49 450.86 B: most of the people who live around here don't really spend as much time here at at the beach as people who come from say chicago or 

450.90 452.65 B: outlying areas 

452.61 454.22 A: (( mm [lipsmack] okay )) 

453.86 455.46 B: you know it's just that 

454.51 457.44 A: it's not as exotic for you [laughter] 

457.36 458.73 B: is it what now 

458.61 462.14 A: it's not exotic for you 'cause it's always there 

461.33 464.57 B: it's not exotic because i grew up around it 

463.83 465.46 A: okay [laughter] 

464.69 474.30 B: you know um a lot of the people i know will go into chicago which is a major you know area because that's more exciting 

474.55 475.92 A: mm mhm 

475.10 479.93 B: and then we find s- we were trying to find a particular museum at one point 

479.94 485.33 B: and we asked some chicagoans and they said oh we don't know where that is and they live there 

485.19 487.00 A: (( [laughter] really )) 

486.21 489.78 B: so the people who live in a particular place are not the ones who visit the 

489.98 492.83 B: the attractions in that particular place 

492.83 494.65 A: mhm [laughter] 

495.08 495.93 A: um 

496.12 501.08 A: i was also gonna ask you do you like to play cards like poker 

501.01 507.68 B: you know what i've never learned to play cards i was never really interested in it because when i was in school when i was in college 

505.05 505.89 A: (( oh )) 

508.14 511.76 B: i would watch the young people play tournaments 

511.79 513.92 B: and they seemed to get very angry 

514.09 515.27 A: (( oh really )) 

514.74 528.15 B: so that sort of put me away from it i didn't wanna participate in something where it was a game but people were getting really angry about it especially cards it was very simple so i just decided i didn't wanna play cards now 

521.87 522.58 A: mhm 

523.23 524.25 A: mhm 

525.44 526.05 A: (( mm )) 

528.15 536.93 B: there are some simple games that i can play like plonk and old maid things like that but poker and those things where 

534.22 535.10 A: (( mm )) 

537.10 541.88 B: especially if money is involved i don't play it because i don't want to 

539.86 540.66 A: mhm 

542.34 545.42 B: have someone get angry with me because i put the wrong card down 

545.16 546.04 A: mhm 

545.69 547.79 B: and that sort of thing but uh 

546.93 549.35 A: yeah that makes sense [laughter] 

549.19 552.91 B: you know i [noise] to me it was just supposed to be a game so 

553.01 554.02 A: mhm 

553.02 561.09 B: [noise] just leave it as a game [noise] and don't get excited about money and and personalities and all that sort of thing 

555.10 556.07 A: yeah 

561.25 562.38 A: yeah 

561.57 566.95 B: i guess you could almost say i'm a little bit of a loner as far as entertainment 

567.27 568.15 A: mhm 

567.35 574.94 B: i love to read that's that's another one of my favorite indoor activities and outdoor i'll sit in the park and read 

574.93 575.92 A: uh-huh 

575.05 575.96 B: (( um )) 

576.07 580.39 B: our library just gave away tons of books and i got as many as i could 

580.40 581.43 A: mhm 

580.53 584.92 B: uh novels that turn into movies that sort of thing 

584.96 585.92 A: uh-huh 

585.45 588.48 B: and that way i can read the original uh 

589.46 590.95 B: the original work 

590.87 591.85 A: mhm 

591.38 592.97 B: so reading 

592.28 594.26 A: do you have a favorite book 

594.95 595.77 B: no 

596.33 597.47 B: not really 

597.35 598.47 A: mhm 

597.77 599.38 B: you know if i were being 

599.58 599.95 B: (( if ))
