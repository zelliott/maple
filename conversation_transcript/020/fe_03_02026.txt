59.10 60.03 B: (( that i don't )) 

62.83 65.65 B: ((  )) 

63.44 64.37 A: so 

64.41 69.62 A: i don't know it's kind of off the wall that they can get convict for stealing 

69.70 73.99 A: you know millions of dollars basically and putting all these people out of work and then not even 

74.12 76.96 A: spend one day in jail and then some people ah 

77.05 80.15 A: can go to jail for you know a lot lesser things 

79.88 82.45 B: ((  )) 

82.50 84.49 B: (( away with this for such a )) 

84.54 88.47 B: (( long time mhm yeah mm yeah yeah yeah i don't think people in lower positions even get )) 

90.61 92.15 B: (( to see any budgets )) 

92.58 98.94 A: yeah yeah that's basically what it boils down to 'cause it's like you know this country is the united states is 

98.98 104.51 A: basically a capitalist society so if you have money you can basically 

105.13 112.04 A: get away with a whole lot not everything but a whole a whole lot more than people who don't have money 

112.07 116.09 B: (( of anything ever right most people don't really know what's going on in the company [laughter] )) 

116.47 123.27 B: (( yeah but i i am wondering if they could if some club would put some laws in place or something to regulate )) 

123.44 131.70 B: (( at least the the accounting companies right the accounting companies like like anderson or whatever that if they could do something mhm )) 

131.71 137.80 B: (( [laughter] now they're very rich criminals [laughter] now they're they're very rich criminals )) 

138.15 150.76 A: mm i i think it's 'cause basically the ah the they're a bigger like a bureaucracy you know it's just not like a a team of of ah bank robbers it's like a whole 

150.97 161.40 A: group of ah um guys telling their other guys there you know people under them and a whole bunch of people in the company i think they have three thousand people employed but 

161.59 168.22 A: it's like a group of people i don't know key employers maybe like all around the world for enron probably about 

168.29 172.73 A: you know about ah two dozen 

172.79 177.88 A: that are main the main one that are making everybody do it and they're all smart people so 

177.89 179.13 A: (( they know ah )) 

179.29 183.15 A: ways to get around it for a while i think it was their bookkeepers 

183.64 185.60 A: anderson or something like that 

185.12 186.36 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

185.97 187.95 A: that was basically um 

188.06 191.19 A: they knew about it but they didn't kind of like 

191.28 194.57 A: it's like ah they were you know ah 

194.75 203.36 A: scratch my back i'll scratch yours kind of thing they were paying them and and giving them money so they knew it but they didn't know it and they're not 

203.77 205.67 A: a police force you know 

206.09 210.65 A: but um so they kind of looked the other way i mean there's a lot of people and w- 

210.73 215.54 A: finally one lady i think you know the lady that actually told on everybody 

215.87 218.64 A: yeah so eventually you know somebody 

218.79 223.59 A: gets kinda like hey this this sh- is wrong and then they do something about it 

223.67 227.52 A: but everybody's you know in there for their livelihood so they're kind of like 

227.79 236.60 A: they don't want to lose their jobs and stuff 'cause ah even the lady that told was had a good high paying job i think like you know hundred thousand dollar as year 

236.33 242.54 B: (( [mn] )) 

242.29 243.27 A: yeah 

242.89 243.79 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

243.87 247.03 B: (( i know although i i personally )) 

247.30 260.93 A: no yeah exactly 'cause it's especially a big company like that they don't know you know where the money's coming where it is you know 'cause people they have different investors and probably they're public companies too so it makes it more complicated 

261.33 266.31 A: so yeah they're just i think they're well they're in the middle of reforming now i think ah 

266.56 269.20 A: the president yeah he ah 

269.27 282.06 A: ah got some kind of commission together and they're supposed to i was watching on t. v. right now they just um it's an ongoing investigation and they just put one guy actually in in jail i think 

282.45 286.16 A: so they're working on it it just takes time mm 

286.36 287.41 B: (( stay )) 

287.47 288.86 B: (( away from the )) 

289.49 294.83 B: (( stock market for a while but um if you want to get a )) 

295.09 296.61 B: (( job at the company )) 

296.88 297.68 B: right 

298.09 300.02 B: (( now with the )) 

301.12 304.47 B: (( way the market is i don't think )) 

301.15 302.04 A: (( yeah )) 

305.42 318.63 A: yeah well that's what they're doing they're working on it it takes time to to ah they try to you know set up commissions and then investigate and go back and back and they got a subpoena all those documents for years and go through them so 

318.67 321.02 A: but it should be like anything else 

321.61 327.43 A: you know like when something tragic happens then they do something about it like this messed up 

327.67 332.77 A: the stock market jobs economies and stuff it's having like you know a ripple effect 

332.79 333.84 A: so 

333.93 338.36 A: yeah once that stuff happens and people get outraged and then 

338.58 340.37 A: change happens but 

340.66 346.17 A: i think those guys they know about it i mean they have so much money that they can even if they do 

346.55 353.48 A: you know get arrested and go to jail [sigh] um they're still gonna come out and have millions of dollars left over 

353.87 357.31 A: [laughter] so those guys are like really really smart but 

357.72 358.67 A: um 

358.91 363.21 A: that's that's not it if it keeps them they're still criminals but they're 

363.36 367.57 A: ah they're just a lot smarter and and 

367.29 369.86 B: (( that just me personally have )) 

367.74 368.94 A: bigger stakes 

369.36 370.41 A: huh 

370.04 373.77 B: (( lots of options for research [laughter] )) 

373.03 379.75 A: yeah they're rich criminals yeah should write a movie about it but um yeah there's not much you can do except ah 

379.96 381.61 A: (( ah be smart )) 

381.67 388.65 A: and now you know watch out when you ah go get a job at some places like that you think are good companies 

388.77 398.35 A: do your research you know on the internet or whatever and investigate them and make sure that that they're good before you invest your time and money into their stock [laughter] 

398.00 404.64 B: (( whoever gives me a job i take it i know tha- so they were losing they were losing their money they put it )) 

405.18 406.70 B: (( and then the money )) 

406.83 408.21 B: (( the company )) 

408.22 416.93 B: (( put in actually it wasn't any money so they they lost a lot of stuff and not only their job )) 

417.59 420.50 A: mhm yeah yeah well that's true too 

420.63 424.81 A: same thing is like the economy sometimes you don't really have a choice 

425.12 430.45 A: but you know that's just the way it goes take a job wherever you can get it and then 

430.82 436.43 A: just keep your money well if you're gonna do that then don't put it 'cause i think a lot of those people put it 

436.68 441.67 A: a lot of their money back into their ah into their retirement fund 

442.04 445.34 A: so they not only lost a job but they were putting like 

445.55 450.81 A: a certain amount of money into their i._r._a.s and then the company who's backing it with 

453.04 453.96 A: (( their )) 

456.34 458.29 A: (( money but )) 

458.45 459.86 A: (( it wasn't real money )) 

460.55 464.90 A: (( yeah )) 

463.70 466.19 B: (( mm that much i can tell just from that mm )) 

466.17 471.75 A: yeah i some of the people had like um hundred thousand dollars worth of stock they'd be working it for 

472.08 476.53 A: like like you say it's been it went on for a long time like fifteen years 

476.56 480.41 A: [laughter] and i think enron was part of that um 

480.70 495.33 A: that energy scandal oh ah last summer or the one before that when they ah jacked up the prices on everything and they said it was because of ah downed power lines and stuff and then they found pout that it was all a big fabrication 

484.35 485.74 B: yeah 

495.42 497.89 A: and enron was part of that too so 

497.99 503.52 A: [sigh] yeah it can get pretty ah it can get pretty sticky so that's what we have the um 

504.04 506.97 A: ah what is it the c. e. s. or s. e. c. 

507.19 508.43 A: to ah 

508.47 513.41 A: watch them but it looks like nowadays we have to have everybody watching everybody 

512.59 515.32 B: (( yeah [laughter] yes )) 

513.68 515.16 A: (( [laughter] )) 

515.22 527.98 B: so you think that if ah the government say puts in place more rules and regulations for the companies to follow in their accounting this is going to help the stock market or you think that it's not going to react to it at all 

528.51 534.86 A: oh yeah if they actually came out and publicly said that they were going to do this do this we passed these new bills 

534.97 544.34 A: then yeah it it will have a lot people will have a lot more confidence like you said yeah people don't have any confidence right now in the in the stock market and 

544.35 552.76 A: they're doing it ah spending their money on different ways like real estate and gold and different stuff but the stock market needs to be ah 

552.93 565.03 A: you know it needs to be back the way it is because it's part of our [mn] economy so yeah i i think that will happen but they need to be a little bit more ah they're right now they're real secretive 

565.20 568.29 A: but ah they're they're working on it 'cause you know 

567.63 573.00 B: yeah probably when the- come up with a good plan takes probably a lot of time 

572.95 577.20 A: yeah a lot of time 'cause it's really complicated you know and these guys 

575.73 577.32 B: (( mm right [laughter] yeah [laughter] [laughter] )) 

577.22 590.11 A: these these guys know what they're doing they'll they've got connections to brokers and everybody and [mn] and so they have to they have to really outsmart them like the i._r._s. always had to be outsmarting everybody each year 

590.33 593.87 A: you know it's why they changed the laws to make it all complicated so 

594.12 599.23 A: you know they make it real simple and everybody starts getting they start getting tricky 

599.26 599.89 A: so
