4.53 5.52 A: (( ah )) 

5.86 9.75 A: wow ah outdoor [noise] was it outdoor was it outdoor 

8.84 14.38 B: yeah i guess it was outdoor indoor you sort of i think we're supposed to introduce ourselves before i'm curtis schneider 

14.08 15.46 A: (( all right i'm abraham )) 

15.18 16.71 B: abraham nice to meet you 

15.91 17.31 A: (( yeah how you're doing )) 

17.20 20.82 B: that's good um so you like you say you like outdoor better than indoor 

20.49 26.76 A: oh well no i was just trying to think the outdoor indoor cold and hot [noise] and favorite right okay 

25.33 26.22 B: yeah 

26.31 27.35 B: yeah 

26.79 28.29 A: (( ah mm )) 

29.28 36.07 A: i like outdoor activities it's just that when you got a lot going on it's kind of hard to get out there [noise] and you know 

36.25 41.25 A: and do what you like to do [noise] and it ends up being more convenient to stay inside so [noise] 

37.64 38.69 B: yeah it takes 

40.48 42.32 B: just being inside and stuff yeah 

41.48 45.32 A: yeah but i would say i like outdoor best but 

45.22 48.78 B: but it's just a a matter of like getting out and doing it actually yeah 

47.22 50.28 A: [noise] yeah hav- finding the time to get out there and doing 

49.80 51.41 B: that makes sense that's cool 

50.83 58.33 A: yeah and then of course when it's cold i'm sure everybody prefers to be inside and when it's hot everybody wants to get out so 

55.86 56.79 B: yeah 

58.21 62.19 B: whi- which do you like better the the cold or the hot 

61.31 62.23 A: um 

62.72 63.89 A: i'd go with 

64.04 76.19 A: hot probably but i still have a thing for i still do cold too because i used to play football at school so i i like you know i i i'm used to playing in the cold too 

65.54 66.38 B: yeah 

70.66 71.64 B: oh yeah 

76.02 76.95 B: yeah 

76.36 81.42 A: so but i definit- i probably prefer hot to running on the track and you know 

81.34 82.20 B: yeah 

81.58 84.05 A: getting out there playing basketball that kind of thing 

83.45 92.61 B: yeah doing all that kind of stuff that's cool yeah i played football too in texas and and it it didn't get too cold when we were out there playing it but but it was good um 

84.73 85.47 A: yeah 

92.65 95.64 B: i hated it when it was playing football when it's hot though 

95.44 96.54 A: (( oh )) 

96.20 101.15 B: just 'cause it's i mean like the dog days of august and what not you're just like two dazed and stuff 

99.28 100.10 A: yeah 

100.14 103.02 A: oh god yeah i forgot about that 

101.50 102.29 B: yeah 

102.35 115.38 B: but i i mean it's one of the things you don't ever you always remember the games the the the nights that the games and stuff but yeah i i'd probably have to say that i like ah outside sport ah outside you know activities too 

109.96 111.06 A: yeah 

115.58 124.68 B: but um it's like you said that you have to make a lot more effort to to go outside and to actually start the activity and get it going and then 

121.61 122.73 A: [laughter] 

124.81 127.14 B: you know winding up and stuff so 

126.24 136.25 A: exactly it's easier to ah warm up when it's hot too [noise] like it it's not as critical to to you know stretch your muscles and everything and that 

131.08 131.93 B: yeah 

135.05 138.83 B: yeah that you won't you don't have as much chance of of tearing a muscle or 

138.42 139.65 A: yeah 

139.07 140.98 B: or something like that that's true 

141.01 144.32 A: so that's a good thing especially because a lot of people don't even 

144.33 151.80 A: think to stretch before they do activities and everything so when it's warm outside it's like a real chance for them to hurt themselves 

151.56 153.45 B: yeah 

152.87 154.86 A: [noise] so i guess that's bad too 

154.97 160.25 B: yeah that is that's that's wicked now did you grow up um where it was warm or or 

160.19 164.95 A: i i grew up at um mid atlantic i'm from the maryland d._c. area 

164.40 165.27 B: okay 

165.01 165.98 A: so 

165.71 168.67 B: so you had pretty pretty cold winters then and stuff so 

168.01 171.06 A: yeah like cold winters hot summers nothing really 

171.27 172.16 A: um 

172.58 175.96 A: not in tropical or anything like february [noise] or nothing 

175.68 176.90 B: yeah 

176.31 177.24 A: (( like that but ah )) 

177.51 182.70 B: that's good now when you do do act- inside activity what kind of inside things do you like to do 

182.42 184.22 A: inside [mn] [noise] 

183.15 184.53 B: yeah 

184.81 185.82 A: um 

186.75 189.19 A: getting in like a little fitness centre or whatever 

189.10 189.93 B: (( ahah )) 

189.21 191.96 A: [noise] that type of thing um 

192.59 203.00 A: other than that i don't really do too many too many of the indoor things i don't i can't every really think i mean do they just mean indoor athletic activities [noise] or [noise] [noise] 

200.99 210.64 B: it's sort of i don't i don't know i think just kind of any any type that you like usually when i think of an activity indoors it's usually like lifting weights or or 

211.28 217.92 B: ah or like playing racket ball or something but i don't play racket ball too much i just i lift weights quite a bit but yeah that's about the only 

218.18 220.07 B: inside activity 

220.76 223.24 B: um that i really do 

222.99 228.23 A: yeah unless you're talking about picking up your play station control i don't really do too much else [noise] activity [noise] 

227.14 238.81 B: [laughter] yeah i guess yeah i don't i guess yeah i guess you could call video games an an indoor activity 'cause ah but yeah or like computer games or surfing on the net or something 

238.81 242.05 A: yeah well in that case i i i do that 

241.87 242.86 B: yeah

369.66 370.66 A: yeah 

371.38 374.84 B: not as easy as as going just like running a few ah

398.25 399.17 B: yeah 

400.42 408.20 B: you know it's one thing that i've that i've noticed though is if you have someone to go with you and go outside and do an activity it's a it's a lot easier to do it um 

408.38 414.76 B: just because you know yeah i mean you know how it is if you go out by yourself you are just you know like alone nobody likes to be alone 

411.31 412.09 A: (( yeah you're )) 

414.41 416.29 A: not going to push yourself either
