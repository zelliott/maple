103.85 104.99 A: um 

104.37 106.82 B: i think i just [noise] um for [mn] 

106.91 115.88 B: because it has to do with weather the question um i think that's the thing i don't really cold weather that much so that's probably why i don't like those things 

109.11 110.30 A: (( [noise] yep )) 

112.31 113.71 A: yeah i don't 

114.57 116.88 A: i don't really like cold weather very much

140.00 145.42 A: i consider shopping an indoor activity i like doing that [laughter] [laughter] 

143.44 148.55 B: shopping [laughter] yeah 'cause they didn't say it had to be sports i was i was i was just thinking 

146.16 147.47 A: that's true 

148.90 151.03 A: indoor activities let's see 

149.22 150.38 B: but um 

151.15 154.77 A: [mn] shopping working playing on the computer 

152.80 157.26 B: [laughter] oh yeah working i don't like that [laughter] 

156.81 158.28 A: i like it most of the time 

157.79 164.56 B: [laughter] depends on what it is i guess but i definitely like like warm weather because 

159.47 160.80 A: yeah 

164.67 172.23 B: i like ah even like gardening now that the weather has been starting to warm up it just it puts me in a much better mood and 

167.37 168.32 A: yeah 

172.13 182.02 A: yeah i like like sightseeing like we take the kids places like down like you know down to the harbour and that kind of stuff and like i like [mn] yeah so i like like spring [noise] 

177.76 179.25 B: oh yeah 

181.34 188.68 B: it's just easier in the warmer weather because you don't have to have all these coats you don't driving you know you don't have to worry about it 

187.18 191.85 A: plus in maryland in maryland it's just miserable when it's cold it's like 

190.71 192.21 B: [laughter] 

191.86 201.76 A: i mean growing up in michigan when it's cold it's like dry and cold and they have ploughs here it's just wet and cold and miserable and icy and 

196.69 198.14 B: oh really 

201.98 202.68 A: (( [mn] here )) 

202.10 208.77 B: oh that's interesting 'cause see i've never been to michigan obviously but i would think it would be colder there but i guess 

203.30 204.54 A: it's different 

207.77 215.51 A: it's colder but it's like here it's just wet and miserable there it's like dry and the sun shines off the snow 

211.52 212.27 B: mm 

215.72 225.75 A: plus when you live there you spend the money on having really warm coats [laughter] and boots i mean and and all that an- i mean here it's like you know you are sort of really not that prepared and 

219.51 220.72 B: yeah 

225.02 239.07 B: and i think the last couple well i've lived my whole life here and we used to have pretty much every winter it would be kind of like it was this past winter and the last few years we have really got it easy so i i don't know when you moved here 

236.23 237.25 A: yeah 

238.69 241.28 A: i i've been here a long time i've been here 

239.91 251.86 B: you have okay 'cause i i know that in the last few years um i live in a newer development and people that have moved here recently you know and they think oh it's not that bad and then it's like well this is not normal [laughter] [laughter] 

249.00 253.07 A: this isn't normal no no no it's like the year before last was where is it 

252.09 257.77 B: i had gotten a four wheel drive a few years ago and i never had to use it until this year finally [laughter] it was like 

257.04 262.26 A: [noise] i do like sledding outside i have a five year old or actually six now um 

261.22 262.44 B: (( oh okay )) 

262.71 266.68 A: [mn] so i mean i like doing that kind of stuff like playing in the snow with the kids for 

265.65 273.36 B: no see a- again i can't i mean i would like to but [mn] i go out for a little bit and [mn] for the all the trouble it takes for me to get 

272.15 274.21 A: [laughter] to get bundled up 

273.13 281.12 B: three pairs of socks on and all the stuff and then i'm cold and then i want to come in i was like that when i was a kid too i would stay outside with my neighbour because she was my 

281.00 295.86 B: only friend that was nearby and so you know we would play together but i would always be like can't we go in can't we go in and she would be like no let's play i'm like i want to go in and have hot chocolate [laughter] i just never liked the cold weather but um yeah my kids are out there 

290.36 291.19 A: [laughter] 

294.42 300.32 A: i don't think i'd ever take a vacation somewhere cold i mean a vacation would definitely be somewhere like 

297.07 298.16 B: no 

300.45 303.34 A: at least if not hot 

303.50 312.14 A: um you know at at least like you know spring like so you could go you know go see whatever there is to see and do stuff and 

307.77 308.91 B: yeah 

310.24 311.30 B: yeah 

311.40 315.38 B: i mean i wouldn't i guess i wouldn't want to be like melting away like 

315.32 329.25 B: horr- horribly hot like like key west we went to key west we've been there a couple times um but we happened to go in june one year where we had a different we were supposed to go to san francisco and the and the my my husband had a seminar out there and things changed so we 

323.36 324.21 A: yeah 

325.10 325.93 A: mm 

327.56 330.27 A: yeah i went to san francisco last june 

329.62 330.86 B: oh really 

330.52 333.57 A: yeah we thought it was going to be warm like what idiots [laughter] 

332.58 335.83 B: it's supposed to be cool because it's on the water 

333.98 334.93 A: it is 

335.45 336.54 A: (( yeah and it )) 

335.84 349.22 B: yeah but i thought well that'd be a nice trip in the end of june 'cause even if it's a little cool that'd be nice but then you know his seminar got cancelled so we thought well it's too expensive to fly all the way out there so we thought well we'll go somewhere so we'll go to key west again because we like it so much 

339.04 340.00 A: mhm 

342.24 343.54 A: key west would be 

343.59 344.64 A: miserable 

349.04 356.40 B: oh my gosh it was so hot there and we didn't want to do anything i mean even not doing activity outdoors even just you know 

350.54 351.66 A: yeah 

356.22 358.26 A: laying around ordering a drink 

356.35 365.98 B: ah getting on the little tram and just driving i mean we would take a shower and everything even in the evening by the time we would go out i- you know our make up would be like melting off my face 

364.81 372.01 A: yes you can't go places like that in june [laughter] that's why it's cheap [laughter] that's why it's cheap in june [laughter] 

366.40 368.37 B: [laughter] 

369.39 370.53 B: yeah 

371.25 377.74 B: yeah but going there in like march or april it's really nice 'cause you you know it's warm it's like summer 

374.58 375.50 A: yeah 

376.08 379.85 A: yeah no no no it's supposed to be like one of those places people go and then they never leave 

379.47 380.65 B: yeah 

379.97 383.61 A: it's like a little tropical paradise i've never been i haven't been down there 

381.44 390.80 B: yeah it's it's really friendly friendly and it is like that it's like a jimmy buffett place you know but we are not talking about activities so we are going to get in trouble [laughter] [laughter] 

385.56 387.07 A: yeah it's like 

388.82 392.57 A: uh-oh uh-oh what happens if we don't talk about the right thing um 

392.19 396.45 B: but i don't know is this the first time you've done this or oh is it okay 

394.40 395.77 A: yeah i i 

395.83 401.30 A: and actually last time the thing called my husband hung up on it 'cause he was like what's this junk and i was you know [laughter] [mn] 

398.56 399.55 B: oh 

399.64 407.35 B: oh no [laughter] well i um i got my first call the other day and we talked about it was what does family mean to you 

407.50 414.11 B: so these topics are kind of hard and i don't know exactly you know what we are suppose- i know we are supposed to be talking about activities but 

411.91 418.10 A: i guess unless you're really i mean this is sort of like a weird topic like do you like warm or cold hot or i mean okay we can talk about we hate cold we like wa- warm 

417.01 420.44 B: warm or cold activities i mean we are talking about the temperature 

418.39 422.08 A: or cold activities in or yeah in or out 

421.61 427.75 B: but if i could do well let's say skiing for instance you i don't know it probably isn't the same snow skiing and water skiing 

422.48 423.31 A: i mean 

427.77 430.71 B: it's not just the temperature because they are actually two different 

430.18 437.14 A: they are entirely different water skiing i mean [mn] water skiing i've done like when i was a kid but and that's it 

431.32 432.36 B: yeah 

435.94 443.77 B: i never did it because i could never see my eyes were always so bad and now i had the laser surgery so i need to do it some time but i haven't done it yet so [laughter] 

440.54 441.20 A: (( [laughter] )) 

442.86 454.67 A: it's fun i- it's i mean again it's something i haven't done in years um but it actually is a lot of fun and it it's another thing that if you are at all coordinated um i mean i 

454.80 467.89 A: i'm not very good with like hand eye coordination like catching like balls and hitting them and stuff but like but as far as things like with my you know like that kind of thing like with my legs and that kind of stuff i can you know i i i can [mn] 

459.48 461.08 B: yeah [laughter] 

467.72 470.54 A: i was always able to like stay up and i mean it doesn't 

470.78 483.97 A: take that much to then get more advanced you know you can you can definitely after doing it you know do it a couple times you can again do enough to have fun and then you can get a little more advanced where you are like you know crossing over the wake and then you get to the point 

473.65 474.65 B: yeah 

482.68 485.48 B: but wouldn't you say that's a lot different than snow skiing 

485.04 498.30 A: way different [noise] but maybe the set of um balance type skills like i guess i mean like my legs i used to run i mean my legs are s- [mn] again i i don't do like baseball and you know 

485.76 486.85 B: okay 

491.97 493.85 B: (( okay [noise] )) 

497.65 498.78 B: right 

498.36 499.36 A: um 

499.76 503.65 A: my legs are always strong and and you know i have a good sense of balance so 

503.98 504.59 A: it 

504.83 508.75 A: that same type of like you know being able to 

509.02 512.03 A: to stand up on those [laughter] skis and be pulled along 

510.48 513.39 B: yeah using the same muscle groups yeah 

512.30 521.15 A: yeah yeah it's the same kind of muscle groups and coordination so um and even we used to do cross country skiing god years ago we used to do cross country skiing 

516.46 517.86 B: that makes sense 

520.18 526.81 B: now that you'd have to be in really good shape i think to do that i would probably do a half a mile and i'd be like 

521.40 522.78 A: that's easy 

523.88 525.37 A: [sigh] but that's not 

526.91 532.12 A: (( really 'cause it's not so different than doing um like i said i was in good shape back then )) 

527.43 528.83 B: [noise] burn out [laughter] 

532.21 533.19 A: um 

533.39 535.63 A: (( [mn] but that's another thing that )) 

535.76 545.52 A: you could do at a different [mn] you can learn enough in one try to get and then you just kind of slide along and it's only really hard if there if there are like any steep hills 

545.69 547.16 A: either up or down [laughter] [noise] 

546.78 555.88 B: so you are just sliding and all but you are still going i mean you are probably you are doing like a trip right i mean it's almost um you know you are doing so many miles or something right 

549.10 550.18 A: [noise] 

555.18 557.88 A: well you are doing like a tr- we used to do i used to um 

558.07 561.15 A: [mn] give tours to kids at a nature centre 

561.16 571.76 A: and so then we would they would learn they would get like a lesson in cross country skiing in the morning and then they'd go on their skis and and so no i mean you are just going around little tr- i mean whatever you want to do you are not necessarily racing or or 

564.26 565.37 B: oh that's neat 

572.02 573.91 A: you know you could go out in a 

574.17 581.94 A: park in nature you know whatever and just ski around and just you know just basically like taking a hike only you are doing it on skis 

581.20 583.17 B: on skis right mm 

582.51 592.34 A: so i mean you know as long as you want to go and it looks like it's hard but it's not 'cause you're you're sliding i mean it's the same effort it takes to let's say walk except that you are on skis so you are going to slide 

591.83 597.86 B: and you don't have much of a chance of falling down so you don't have to worry about trying to get up [laughter] [laughter] 

593.95 595.69 A: no unless you go down a hill 

595.96 599.89 A: [laughter] yeah yeah exactly that's the hard unless you go down a hill then it you know
