35.42 36.80 B: yeah me too 

37.36 38.31 B: me too 

37.78 41.34 A: (( so ah we're supposed to talk about ah )) 

41.36 48.35 A: corporate standards and all so do you sp- do you invest a lot in the stock market or something like that 

43.54 44.77 B: yes 

46.82 47.59 B: n- 

47.77 49.88 B: no i don't not at all 

49.60 54.57 A: did it affect any corporate scandal affect you directly in any way 

54.91 56.32 B: i don't think so 

56.45 62.83 B: i i i can't i can't think that it did i do think it has caused problems for our whole country 

62.56 63.80 A: i see 

63.19 68.62 B: but but probably mostly for people you know who have invested a lot of money 

67.98 72.44 A: ahah well maybe who were working in those corporates and lost their jobs 

72.34 74.18 B: yes yes 

74.10 75.11 A: (( ahah )) 

75.09 76.28 B: yeah 

76.47 80.79 B: because um my husband my husband is retired and on disability 

80.51 81.45 A: (( ahah )) 

81.03 84.11 B: and and i'm not working anymore either so 

84.34 87.62 B: it really hasn't affected us very much 

87.28 90.48 A: how about the retirement 

89.90 91.24 B: ex- how about what 

90.89 93.15 A: ah the retire- ah the four oh one 

93.48 95.37 A: (( was it ah )) 

95.55 99.14 A: was it invested in the stock market or something like that 

98.50 100.85 B: no uh-uh no we didn't have it 

100.73 101.89 A: okay 

101.52 113.90 B: so it didn't affect us that way at all i i do see it affecting people around me more than it has affected us because we just we just live a very simple lifestyle with no investment we don't use credit cards we don't do anything like that 

113.38 114.33 A: (( ahah )) 

113.98 114.92 B: so 

115.12 125.07 B: but um but i but i see you know like you said so many people have lost their jobs and prices have gone so high to compensate yeah 

119.93 121.42 A: right 

123.37 124.24 A: (( exactly )) 

124.42 127.57 A: yeah exactly and directly it affects everybody 

127.73 132.21 A: um ah well as far as i am concerned like my mm 

132.53 140.47 A: since the market's so bad the market has gone bad and bad and bad so i could not get a job [laughter] so that way it has affected me 

137.78 138.83 B: mhm 

140.22 141.22 B: yes 

140.77 151.66 A: ah i don't ah ah have any definite idea about ah what government can do to stop ah what do you think 

151.31 158.78 B: [noise] [lipsmack] i i don't really know if there's anything they can do except just you know prosecute to the fullest when they do outright fraud 

158.84 159.87 A: mhm 

159.24 172.87 B: but as far as stopping it in advance i [noise] i don't think there's any way to do that because then [mn] then they're interfering too much with private enterprise and you know and i i don't think as the government they can do that so 

173.07 174.81 B: it's really tough 

174.77 187.38 A: (( yeah actually government already did what ah w- ah the the ah the guidelines and the and the vigilance everything was in place in case of enron but ah but ah ah you know )) 

186.88 188.31 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

187.59 191.43 A: (( ah accountants [laughter] themselves were )) 

191.68 196.07 A: ah ah you know found to be accountable you know [laughter] so 

192.59 193.63 B: mhm 

194.42 199.62 B: right and and i that's why i think you know if a person i- if a if a corporate 

199.47 210.20 B: if the corporation is is dishonest to start with they're going to find a way around it and that's why i say i don't think there's any way to prevent it but i think they need to prosecute 

204.77 206.03 A: (( ahah exactly )) 

210.28 213.12 B: to the fullest when they catch fraud 

212.75 214.66 A: exactly yeah 

214.05 223.75 B: yeah but i'm just not sure i i just really can't see any way to predict i [mn] i'm with you i think there's a lot of guidelines in place already 

223.38 224.85 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

224.08 230.26 B: that that should protect but there are so many shady characters out there that are going to find a way around that so [noise] 

229.58 230.67 A: mhm 

230.83 233.86 A: yeah that's right actually ah and um 

235.55 241.30 A: i mean it's like it's like a cultural thing it's like a cultural thing because i think ah 

241.36 249.08 A: these corporate people that ah probably there should be some kind of ah s- ah separation between the politics and the 

248.91 260.82 A: and the business because they know they give so much of money they donate to ah to political parties and all they know they i mean ah when it's time when [mn] whenever they get in trouble probably 

252.16 253.46 B: mhm 

257.03 258.06 B: mhm 

260.79 265.89 A: ah they can ah you know ah find some concessions and you know ah 

266.51 276.62 A: (( ah get away with ah whatever they do so probably probably there should be more ah mm scrutiny of ah you know the )) 

268.08 269.10 B: right 

277.27 288.26 A: ah the donations the political donations or you know any favors being given by any person who is in a po- in a who is in a who is in a position yeah 

284.63 291.76 B: i agree i agree because then [mn] then yeah corporations too involved in our government then [mn] 

291.12 292.17 A: yeah 

292.48 294.39 A: yeah right so 

294.86 300.78 A: so yeah it's it's a complex thing that's why it's i say it's a cultural thing because when everyone is like ah 

300.82 304.11 A: ah involved directly or indirectly 

304.44 313.90 A: ah how can ah someone say no ah [mn] i mean this is the this is the remedy this is what should be done this is what should not be done but ah 

313.03 314.54 B: mhm 

314.28 318.28 A: i think it's just a it's just a cultural thing you know 

317.96 319.45 B: mhm i agree 

318.66 319.22 A: (( [mn] )) 

319.63 320.96 B: i think so too 

321.69 324.28 B: where are where are you from where do you live i mean 

324.04 325.59 A: in oklahoma 

325.02 327.85 B: oklahoma i'm fro- i'm in oregon 

327.76 329.15 A: [mn] oh oregon 

328.72 329.93 B: yeah 

329.31 333.03 A: (( i heard there's a lot of unemployment in oregon is that true )) 

331.81 334.15 B: there is yes 

334.37 337.26 B: and i think it's going to get worse [laughter] 

336.51 339.60 A: [mn] [laughter] okay so where in oregon do you live 

339.45 344.89 B: ah i live just south of portland um in a little town yeah little town called dayton 

342.21 343.33 A: (( oh really )) 

344.99 349.41 B: but it's about thirty miles south of portland thirty five miles south of portland 

348.68 358.71 A: i see i was ah ah thinking of ca- ah coming there to do my phd in ah portland state or some university in oregon ahah 

349.55 350.77 B: yeah 

356.59 360.03 B: [noise] oh at portland state that's a good good university [mn] 

359.72 369.69 A: yeah but then i ah my friends told me that ah there's a lot of problem there as far as ah finding you know funding for ah education is concerned because of 

369.86 379.25 A: because all these high tech companies are not doing very good stock market is down so they're not doing good so there's not very much money in the university [laughter] 

372.96 373.92 B: yeah 

374.26 376.25 B: yeah there's a lot of them [mn] 

378.28 379.95 B: right yeah 

379.16 387.94 A: so then i kind of dropped my plans [mn] how is how is the cost of living and all this has it gone up because of a lot of unem- unemployment or ah 

387.25 391.45 B: ah yeah it has it's pretty expensive to live [mn] here 

391.27 392.67 A: (( ahah [mn] )) 

391.73 392.66 B: um 

393.36 399.05 B: [lipsmack] gas is real high and and another thing i don't know if you have a family but schools a closing 

398.79 400.02 A: oh really 

399.63 404.63 B: mhm yeah we've had several schools that aren't even able to finish this school year 

400.41 401.70 A: that's pretty bad 

404.51 405.61 A: oh really 

405.36 406.69 B: mhm 

405.88 411.94 A: that's pretty bad they are closing here also but ah like in the summer they are c- they're removing so many jobs and all 

411.46 412.53 B: (( mm hm )) 

412.23 416.63 A: (( so merging some schools but ah it's not as bad )) 

414.99 416.03 B: yeah 

416.47 417.50 B: yeah 

417.09 424.31 A: oklahoma the thing is like we don't have so much of a industry most income comes from sales tax 

424.96 425.97 B: from what 

426.39 430.42 A: most of the state's income comes from ah from ah sales tax 

430.25 431.30 B: (( oh ahah )) 

430.77 442.35 A: so you know if the market goes down or the corporations like lucent went bust here but it did not affect ah mm this ah you know oklahoma's economy very much 

440.45 441.41 B: mhm 

442.16 443.26 B: yeah 

442.47 446.10 A: it's not as as ah oregon is you know 

445.47 456.32 B: right well we have no sales tax they it's been on our ballot nine different times and it's been voted down every time and i do think our economy would be so much better off if we had the sales tax 

448.08 448.82 A: (( ahah )) 

456.44 457.34 A: really 

457.12 458.25 B: yes 

458.29 463.63 A: mhm but you're you're you're gov- you're state's government would they're getting a lot of ah 

459.41 460.19 B: because 

463.59 474.22 A: (( ah tax from corporates like ah corporates li- ah big corporates have their high tech ah all all kinds of com- company they have there so they must be getting a lot of money from them )) 

473.88 474.83 B: mhm 

474.95 486.44 A: and ah that's a good thing i think in oklahoma sales tax become kind of restrictive a lot of corporates moved to other states like texas and all [laughter] so 

484.58 485.47 B: (( ahah )) 

485.57 486.91 B: yeah 

486.33 497.68 A: so i don't know ah [laughter] if it's a good idea to have sale tax sales tax or not but ah yeah that's the only thing that's supporting the state right now but that's that's because we don't have anything else [laughter] 

494.21 495.36 B: mhm 

496.65 504.05 B: yeah well we had so many high tech places but we still have some um in- we still have intel and nike headquarters is here 

503.69 504.62 A: (( ahah )) 

504.23 509.71 B: and um so we still have i- you know in the general area some things and i live in a farming community 

509.40 510.30 A: (( ahah )) 

509.87 516.92 B: ah so there's a lot of agriculture here raise a lot of blue berries and strawberries and corn 

514.12 515.01 A: (( ahah )) 

516.56 517.48 A: (( ahah )) 

517.04 519.31 B: grapes lot of wine 

519.11 520.07 A: (( ahah )) 

519.91 524.70 B: yeah and a lot of hops for beer grow here 

525.47 530.92 B: and it- it's it's funny to be this near portland because you can just drive to portland in an hour or so 

530.56 531.86 A: mhm 

531.23 539.11 B: an- [laughter] and so it something seems funny to be here and and we're so far out in the country and yet the big city is just right over there [laughter] 

538.96 541.22 A: that's good [laughter] 

539.17 540.04 B: (( so [noise] [noise] )) 

541.73 547.89 A: so what else ah ah do you want to talk about 

547.06 554.74 B: um i don't know i know ah some- [mn] we were talking about the corporations i know that's one thing that the corporations here 

554.51 565.95 B: do give back a lot though and [mn] and i and i don't know if that's i i would assume that's probably the case everywhere but i'm only familiar here i know our state colleges were having problems and nike gave 

564.70 566.32 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

565.81 569.87 B: nike gave a lot of money to to the college and 

568.00 577.54 A: yeah yeah i [mn] in that way probably it affects everybody if the corporate goes down bec- because of you know ah these kind of scandals if 

574.79 575.85 B: mhm 

576.59 577.63 B: oh i know 

577.68 579.92 A: (( kind of ah )) 

580.06 590.07 A: ah rob the corporates then i think that way it affects almost everyone because the schools get affected colleges get affected everyone gets affected 

587.54 589.23 B: mhm yes 

589.43 596.58 B: and right on down the line and plus i think it hurts good corporations too because people then don't trust there's so much mis- 

595.00 599.95 A: (( yeah yeah it's it ah hurts the the investment ah san- ))
