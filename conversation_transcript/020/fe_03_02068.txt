249.69 255.78 A: i mean i wasn't i didn't buy any special shoes or any gear or anything we just 

255.98 263.84 A: pulled over by the side of the road next to a mountain and and went up to the top of it a girlfriend and i 

263.82 271.53 A: went up to the top of it and sat up there for a couple of hours looking around just sitting relaxing and then came back down the mountain 

272.56 281.26 B: yeah but it is a good experience because you feel you have risked so much energy and you're in the pure air that's 

281.21 282.09 A: right

305.37 318.84 B: uh well it's bec- we have a different measurement system which is in celsius so i'm not quite used to the fahrenheit but it's about eighty or nine- no i think ninety degrees is okay 

318.65 319.74 A: okay 

319.57 321.40 B: so it's not so hot 

322.22 323.43 A: how

327.13 330.40 B: (( it depends last uh winter )) 

330.45 331.57 B: it was 

332.70 338.45 B: (( i don't know really with that fahrenheit but it's it was below the freezing point ))

352.68 356.03 B: why shall we discuss about 

356.54 357.64 B: cold or 

359.10 360.04 B: weather 

359.88 361.95 A: whatever you choose 

361.96 365.43 A: i i was born in the winter 

365.64 366.88 A: so i i 

367.16 370.17 A: don't like the cold at all i prefer 

370.34 373.21 A: warm weather hot weather all the time 

373.20 376.32 B: mhm yeah i was born in the winter too 

376.93 379.69 B: but i also prefer hot weather 

381.01 381.98 B: so 

383.31 390.56 B: and uh h- how yeah i asked that question and do you like being outside when it's 

390.95 392.36 B: something like 

392.51 394.10 B: (( to stifling )) 

394.96 397.17 B: when it's very much uh 

401.49 403.21 A: when it's very much what

418.31 424.53 B: mhm and well the only thing that i dislike about the hot weather is that 

424.78 437.21 B: if you're outside or inside you're constantly swelling and well if you're working you can't take showers every fifteen or twenty minutes so it's a little bit displeasant 

432.77 433.76 A: right 

437.24 439.18 B: for the people around you 

439.33 440.98 A: and and that's true 

441.12 442.15 B: yeah but 

441.26 442.46 A: (( that's true )) 

442.72 453.38 B: but the nice thing is that when it's hot outside you you uh don't feel the need to eat so much so it's a great possibility to lose some weight 

453.09 455.00 A: yes definitely 

455.46 457.11 A: definitely 

457.23 462.83 A: and i do get bigger in the winter because i'm not as active in the winter as i am in the summer
