81.76 83.70 A: i mean it would help me [laughter] 

84.11 92.48 B: right [laughter] that say if you did know any business scandals far as the government was concerned how would you feel about it what would you do about it 

93.90 107.55 A: [mn] [mn] the the whole thing is i don't even think that the government has that much power i don't think there's too much that they could really do about if it was a business that had um a scandal or anything i don't really think the government can do too much 

107.71 114.87 A: um i mean besides the fact that they report it or anything like that i i don't know maybe they ah 

115.89 123.87 A: probably wouldn't let them do something far as tax wise or you know i i i really couldn't say i couldn't see them doing too much about that really 

124.48 125.72 A: (( what do you think )) 

125.96 135.52 B: [noise] [noise] ah me either i really don't know too many government scandals that's going on let me see if i really do know any government scandals that's going on 

136.29 137.54 B: (( um )) 

139.67 145.44 B: um well i would just say i do think that um anthrax was like a government scandal 

145.50 146.56 A: (( okay yeah )) 

146.88 157.05 B: far as with the mail and everything because i think the government was a part of that i really do i don't think that that was a terrorist or anything 

155.15 169.97 A: that was scary because i me working for the state that was like really a messed up situation because we had got to the point where we could not open mail because of all that anthrax thing and then they was like if you did open mail there were gloves 

157.95 159.57 B: i don't think so 

169.87 173.51 A: have we seen anything suspicious it was it was crazy 

171.46 172.95 B: (( ow )) 

173.25 181.13 B: i think that was the government wanting us to think that was one of the terrorists so then they could really go to war 

173.63 175.94 A: and then you had a lot of people that was scared 

181.21 186.03 B: because the government is i mean they say that um 

187.00 192.32 B: that the other countries are it's just the government is just so um 

192.85 195.04 B: [lipsmack] what's the word 

195.10 202.85 B: that we are we supposed to be the kinder country but i don't think we are think we're just as evil as the other countries 

200.07 200.80 A: (( mhm [noise] mm )) 

202.43 203.58 A: mhm 

203.66 207.43 B: so i think that was a scandal the anthrax scandal was 

203.83 205.26 A: (( yeah i kind of agree with that )) 

205.69 206.49 A: because i 

207.72 213.38 B: conspired by the government to make us believe that this was one of the other 

213.50 219.74 B: countries doing this to us and it really was the government so therefore that we could go to war 

219.67 224.43 A: no i'm thinking too that the sars thing that they got now 

224.45 226.86 A: that that's like um 

227.28 230.86 A: that has something to do with terrorist threat probably 

230.92 237.34 A: with the germ warfare thing that they got going on because nobody never heard of it before now all of a sudden 

237.59 241.14 A: you got this big issue about sars and people can't 

239.64 243.23 B: ah therefore that could be a part of the government 

241.82 242.97 A: mhm 

243.30 250.18 B: too i mean because think about the gov- i mean the u._s. government is always something that's going on 

244.04 246.83 A: mhm because it was just it was crazy mhm 

250.19 263.40 B: they probably going over to china messing around putting these plagues on these people you never know i mean the government's involved in so much scandal that we we really can't realise because we americans we see america 

263.31 266.73 B: in a different light to what other countries see them in 

264.43 269.40 A: mhm even with the small part smallpox um vaccine thing 

269.24 270.16 B: (( mhm )) 

269.37 279.88 A: and they were saying that they just wanted like the hospital workers to get that and that um they would they they only had so many shots that they can issue out 

279.89 282.43 A: and then then the hospital workers didn't want it 

282.78 284.62 A: because they didn't believe 

284.70 288.72 A: for whatever reason that it was helping anybody to get the vaccination 

289.44 291.87 A: so it's like i don't know [noise] 

292.33 295.01 A: it's this is this is a crazy government 

295.41 297.52 B: [noise] do have a crazy government 

297.86 304.66 B: i just think every ah and i don't know i i just don't believe anything that the government says because it's all 

304.88 310.07 A: i always think that they're hiding something i always think that they're hiding some detail or something 

304.92 306.27 B: (( just )) 

310.16 311.53 B: right 

312.62 314.64 A: so even with the um 

316.18 320.68 A: saddam they can't find him and all this so i believe they know where he's at 

319.74 321.49 B: (( [noise] exactly )) 

320.72 324.98 A: i believe they know where bin laden is i i believe that they know these things 

321.65 323.07 B: (( yes )) 

323.41 327.43 B: that's another scandal which the government try to act like bin 

327.72 338.39 B: laden is such a terrorist that he just want us americans so bad but you've got to think about it we as americans we're coming over there on their holy land 

340.22 345.16 B: so you know so i mean we're just seeing what we see on the media 

345.51 346.38 A: (( mhm right )) 

345.57 356.57 B: what media is telling us so you know these people are just protecting their land their turf i think it's a shame that the government is over there messing with those people 

347.37 348.12 A: right 

356.77 368.64 A: mhm yeah i had a friend that said the same thing he was like why would we go over there and send and fight those people and everything and i'm and i i've never really understood the whole thing purpose of the war 

368.66 369.98 A: but um 

370.21 377.06 A: [sigh] and everybody had their o- own opinions about why we need to go to war but it to me it didn't make any sense still 

376.62 381.74 B: right another scandal with the government just to get those people oil 

377.79 380.21 A: so then there's just like you know 

381.97 387.23 A: that's what i thought it was i've only thought it was about the oil people say no it's not about the oil it's you know 

387.18 399.57 A: it's about setting the people free this that and the other thing if that's their way of life that's their way of life who's who's to say that everybody's supposed to have the same kind of way of life it's like even that great wall when they tore that down 

389.63 390.56 B: (( mm )) 

392.47 393.63 B: (( right [noise] i )) 

399.65 413.86 A: um i've i can't even think what country that was and the same like the people went back to the same kind of communist um atmosphere [mn] nothing changed people were still scared to cross over to the other side so 

414.48 420.55 B: don't know i just think our government has a lot and maybe we do have a lot of s- scandal that 

420.62 422.92 B: are far as what was that um 

422.97 430.86 B: senator name that killed that young girl [mn] the the intern he was messing around with they never got um 

431.01 433.96 B: it never got out because the we had the um 

434.64 438.43 B: oh gosh the what went on with the um 

439.26 442.90 B: [lipsmack] when the missiles attacked the [noise] um that building 

443.05 445.03 B: (( the aeroplane crash )) 

444.86 448.77 A: oh oh oh right right [mn] because that that 

447.24 454.68 B: remember when that senator killed that intern girl but he never got exposed fully because of what happened with that 

452.88 457.58 A: because we had that yeah because of nine eleven yeah 

454.78 458.61 B: with this nine eleven yeah with the nine eleven 

458.68 463.13 B: so that was another scandal that they kept amongst each other you know 

462.08 463.58 A: mhm mhm 

463.28 467.75 B: and that senator man he did [noise] he really killed that girl 

468.20 471.05 B: but never came out 

470.63 471.82 A: mhm 

471.84 483.12 A: that's some crazy stuff ah well i guess we do know some scan- [laughter] we just we just didn't know i was i got i guess the question kind of like threw ah threw me off so 

476.18 477.68 B: (( yes we do )) 

479.38 482.04 B: i guess the way they said it yeah 

482.35 483.33 B: right 

484.18 485.26 A: um 

485.83 488.46 A: and this is like the third call i got so 

488.89 492.67 A: i'm trying to keep up with the topics but it's kind of hard [laughter] 

492.71 499.68 B: yeah i just base it on what if we did know any scandal how would you feel about it 

499.20 500.24 A: mhm 

501.53 505.46 A: well i [mn] for the most part um 

501.67 502.54 B: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

506.68 513.48 A: i don't like feeling as though i'm being deceived you know how people always hold back details or whatever and then 

514.04 526.83 A: they make a big blown out case first and then they turn around and then all these hidden details oh we never meant to we never we forgot to tell you about such and such and it's like you had to know that from the beginning so 

516.67 518.05 B: mhm 

528.49 533.29 A: it was just like when they sent all the troops over to kuwait and everybody's saying no we're not um 

533.47 536.73 A: they're not going to war well why would you send all them people over there 

536.63 537.69 B: (( [noise] exactly )) 

536.85 539.82 A: if you didn't have [mn] any intentions of war 

538.75 542.07 B: i don't care that's nothing but over oil 

542.46 550.48 B: we won't never know the truth like you said we won't really know only people that know it is george bush and his people 

550.28 551.34 A: mhm 

550.69 552.55 B: their little scandal 

555.13 557.13 B: i think it's a sin though 

557.83 563.64 A: yeah i think it's a sh- i think it's a shame that so many lives was lost in the midst of all this 

558.17 559.19 B: (( [mn] i )) 

561.98 563.08 B: (( know )) 

563.66 575.00 A: and even when you look at the girl that um got shot in both ankles and they kept telling a different story every time you turn around first it was though she's she's a little injured but you know 

574.97 581.28 A: then they're trying to find out like were they being tortured you know you know those people were being tortured 

579.29 587.00 B: [noise] of course they are they are torturing the i think like the american like the other foreign countries 

581.77 584.52 A: so there's no reason to shoot nobody in the ankle 

587.15 589.25 B: um torture 

589.54 594.97 B: tortured americans i d- do i think that americans really do torture 

595.14 599.89 B: the other people that they capture they have to what makes us any di- 

597.79 598.79 A: yeah 

598.82 599.78 A: yeah
