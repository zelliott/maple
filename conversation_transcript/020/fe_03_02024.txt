0.12 2.16 B: hi this is nancy 

1.68 4.06 A: hi nancy this is james 

3.71 5.36 B: hi james how you doing 

5.18 9.24 A: i'm doing okay feeling very dumb 'cause 

8.50 16.75 B: feeling very dumb because of the subject i've got to tell you the [mn] i [mn] i understood part of it but some of it wasn't totally clear did you 

16.53 18.14 A: (( [mn] ah [noise] [noise] i )) 

17.00 20.47 B: what can the government do to curb corporate 

21.20 23.15 B: i mean i i got the gist of it 

23.34 28.26 A: think it's um just about maybe stuff like enron or something 

27.70 33.71 B: enron and andersen and [mn] philip well not really philip morris um 

28.53 29.38 A: [noise] 

33.82 36.15 B: i guess wouldn't apply in this situation 

36.23 38.84 B: [mn] did did you hear clearly what the 

38.57 40.51 A: no [laughter] 

39.83 44.90 B: it was a little muddled it wa- was really a little muddled and it was about three questions so 

40.58 41.38 A: (( i )) 

45.06 51.94 B: what can the government do to curb it i definitely heard that part so i i have an opinion on that do you have an opinion on what the government can do 

52.14 60.59 A: have no idea this is one of those times when i think wow i should actually watch c._n._n. sometimes just just slipping through [noise] 

53.85 54.65 B: i 

59.17 65.61 B: oh well i think that i think that white collar crime should be treated as um 

65.54 75.62 B: [mn] as as what we've seen recently this year i think it always should have take them out in handcuffs arrest them throw them in jail i think that what the government can do is impose 

75.63 84.89 B: stricter regulations on these firms in terms of how they account for their business how they spend their money i 

84.93 98.49 B: think that a lot of my opinions would would probably lean to the socialist side because people would say too much control too much control but i i think that the the difference between what c._e._o.s earn and the 

98.58 105.88 B: i'm not going to say the the minimum paying pers- minimum paid person [noise] in a company but let's say a mid level person 

105.93 108.42 B: [mn] say someone who's been there seven eight eight years 

108.57 114.51 B: mid or entry level management or a a good solid administrative support person who's making a nice income 

114.57 117.34 B: i don't think there should be a difference of of ah 

117.58 128.29 B: fifteen hundred times you know somebody's earning forty thousand dollars and somebody's earning forty million dollars there's there's something wrong with that there's only so much money and 

129.03 143.19 B: unless unless a person is directly responsible the only people that really deserve to a- to make a big cut of the profits in my opinion are the sales people because they are the ones that aren't supposed to be incurring anything but you know that's getting off the subject what the government can do 

143.17 151.70 B: i think the government would just have to impose stricter regulations on companies 'cause that's really what the fisher project wants us to talk about 

151.66 160.09 B: is what can they do and how have things affected our opinions um [mn] what well how has that how's everything affected your opinion 

160.39 163.46 A: um it [mn] its 

163.67 170.69 A: i've laughed at a few jokes about enron even though i have no idea what happened there [laughter] yeah 

168.62 169.85 B: oh you don't 

170.30 171.29 B: okay 

171.22 171.78 A: (( [mn] )) 

171.90 176.71 A: my ah my news i basically watch the daily show [mn] 

176.85 178.19 B: do you read the paper 

176.86 180.35 A: i'm up on topics oh 

180.26 184.00 B: okay well enron they they didn't account correctly 

184.37 192.02 B: and they they lost the pension everybody lost everybody except i guess the c._e._o. are you um 

192.62 193.31 B: [mn] 

193.91 199.13 B: are you familiar do you do you keep up on news well you watch the daily news so you hear about business 

198.88 204.00 A: oh the daily show is actually a comedy show which spoofs the news [laughter] 

203.92 208.52 B: oh oh so you you don't know anything about the current news is that what you are saying 

204.50 205.29 A: yeah 

208.15 219.13 A: well i know about like stuff they interrupt the usual stuff with you know like war and stuff like that and you know for a while i was actually watching the [mn] news thinking 

213.19 214.12 B: okay 

214.74 216.06 B: yeah okay 

219.00 228.23 A: so are we winning this war should i be wearing a gas mask but you know other than that i i just haven't really been paying much attention to the news 

222.93 224.44 B: (( [laughter] )) 

227.12 231.46 B: okay well part of the question was what should the government do 

231.65 232.90 B: [mn] to um 

233.20 237.26 B: to curb this problem wh- do you think the government should do anything 

238.17 242.64 A: um yeah if it's a problem they should probably do something about 

242.09 247.87 B: okay what what do you think the government how involved should the government be in these things 

248.07 249.40 A: (( it um )) 

248.91 250.42 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

250.19 262.12 A: i i don't i don't know how involved exactly 'cause you know if you earn billions you know you don't want the government just coming in saying well you worked hard for this money now we are going to take it away 

255.01 256.22 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

262.04 266.07 A: you know if you get to a certain place where you can you know be a 

266.56 270.28 A: ma- be a monopoly or get lots of money or whatever 

269.75 271.00 B: [noise] [noise] mhm 

270.35 274.64 A: you know you earned it you worked pretty hard to get there so 

273.88 278.14 B: [noise] do you mean if you're if you're your own person or a small business 

278.57 282.29 A: oh yeah if you make a small business into a big business ah 

279.82 281.13 B: (( [noise] )) 

281.22 284.61 B: [noise] okay but let's say what do you what do you think 

284.92 297.45 B: okay well let's take big companies let's take companies like i don't know i._b._m. or at&t or [noise] you know whoever who a- any of these big companies do you think the government should have a right to regulate [noise] 

297.53 303.52 A: i can't say anything bad about at&t on the phone right now because i'm paranoid 

300.46 303.49 B: [noise] well i'm just saying as an example big companies 

304.37 305.32 A: (( ah )) 

305.62 307.38 A: (( ah [mn] yeah sure )) 

306.02 307.98 B: pepsi coca-cola 

307.67 308.51 A: what 

308.24 309.94 B: pepsi coca-cola 

309.57 312.08 A: okay well pepsi and coca-cola 

310.54 316.83 B: you know any any kind of a big company i just i'm just trying to talk about you know big companies where it'd be more 

317.23 319.44 B: likely to [noise] 

319.60 322.06 B: to get these kinds of problems [noise] 

322.34 328.85 A: i i i think that the government should be able to you know maybe keep track of how much money they are making 

327.96 329.50 B: [noise] mhm 

329.36 330.93 A: hold on a second 

330.39 331.13 B: okay 

331.19 333.35 B: oh we are not supposed to [noise] 

339.96 341.15 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

342.71 343.28 B: (( [noise] )) 

343.91 344.97 A: um 

344.03 351.76 B: [noise] hi okay so you feel like they should be able to keep tabs on it [mn] you know the other thing too maybe this is something um 

345.50 346.29 A: (( sorry )) 

347.60 348.66 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

352.03 362.54 B: because she was saying th- or she the the robot was saying [laughter] it's kind of funny the robot was saying um talk about what you think the government should be able to do and another point is 

354.80 356.04 A: (( [laughter] )) 

363.02 377.00 B: technically the government can really only inspect really really carefully public companies if they are on the stock market you have to file your tax returns s._e._c. statements all that stuff is only for publicly traded companies 

376.98 382.51 B: so if a company isn't publicly traded and i don't mean the little small you know 

382.53 393.67 B: sole proprietor you know mom and pop business i'm i'm talking about large companies that are not public um i can't think of an example of one but you know what i mean before they turn public 

393.73 396.88 A: like ones that make stuff for other businesses 

393.81 394.91 B: (( what do you what d- )) 

396.62 397.71 B: what 

397.91 401.74 A: they don't you know sell publicly they sell to people who 

401.85 402.78 A: are 

402.07 412.42 B: well in other words they are not a public company they don't have stock traded on the stock market okay should the government be able to regulate them because as it is right now they really can only regulate the public companies 

413.00 416.51 A: uh i'm going to say yes [laughter] okay 

414.32 426.19 B: i agree with that and so we're getting recorded on this yeah you know now that now that i think about it i don't think that government regulations should go just for publicly traded companies 

425.93 426.69 A: mm 

426.19 427.27 B: i think 

427.26 437.80 B: if somebody starts a business like ford ford or pepsi or coc- whoever at there was a point where these companies were really big and they were not public i mean they go public to make more money 

437.65 452.58 B: but they get to a point where [noise] they're just so big and then the big you know all the news is well now we're gonna go public but if they never get to that point they should still at certain [mn] i i don't know whether it would be at a certain price like they generate revenue in excess of 

452.59 464.68 B: fifty million dollars a year or they exceed five hundred employees or what the criteria is maybe a hundred employees the [mn] they should then be able to be regulated um 

464.67 473.99 B: in terms of of their taxes just the way a public company is and i think that that could definitely curb the problems we've had 'cause it's not just enron 

474.31 482.20 B: i mean it's not look at the scandals well [mn] you may not know about it because you said you weren't keeping up with it but quest communications 

478.60 479.16 A: (( [noise] )) 

482.46 489.64 B: quest communications has been in the telecom picture they're d- they they're another enron story 

482.47 483.24 A: mm 

489.72 491.84 A: and i heard something about disney 

491.89 493.82 A: mike wiesner making 

492.88 498.76 B: [noise] yeah and worldcom m._c._i. worldcom they're they're almost done 

498.98 513.69 B: m._c._i. was one company and worldcom was another l._d._d._s. and you know they merged and now now they're they're practically extinct they're on they're on the verge of being extinct [noise] american airlines united airlines they're in chapter eleven right now they're 

512.71 514.30 A: what do you work as 

514.74 518.73 B: oh i'm self employed but i used to work as a researcher what do you do 

518.68 523.09 A: oh i'm an actor so that explains the whole mimbo thing 

523.11 524.81 B: [noise] explains the what 

524.19 527.55 A: whole mimbo i'm not very intellectual 

527.95 529.48 A: i left yeah 

528.01 528.78 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

528.98 530.99 B: how did you get involved with fisher then 

531.24 540.77 A: fisherman oh i got into that when i was on the internet and there was some advertisement for it and i was like spam [mn] 

539.24 539.97 B: (( [noise] okay )) 

540.56 541.34 B: okay 

540.94 543.46 A: how interesting yeah so 

541.82 550.21 B: yeah well [mn] if you're an actor then you work for big studios or you you might or you might want to work for big studios 

550.12 553.10 B: and they would i i don't even know if [noise] 

553.00 565.17 B: universal or m._g._m. are are public or private i don't even know but that those would be really good examples should should they be regulated financially their accounting practices should they be 

565.79 572.59 B: under inspection by the government to follow the laws of business accounting 

572.68 580.67 B: so i yeah i definitely think that that would help curb these kinds of future problems where these public companies 

581.06 582.11 B: um 

582.57 590.30 B: cheat on cheat on the books and they the people that pay are the people like enron who've been there twenty thirty years and their their 

590.31 595.96 B: working days are done and and they have no retirement and they're thinking all those years well 

595.98 599.89 B: i'm putting in my time and when i'm ready to you know
