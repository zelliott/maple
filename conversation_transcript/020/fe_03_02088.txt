5.82 7.43 A: all right so 

7.58 9.38 A: (( you have a lot of friends ron )) 

8.91 13.01 B: [laughter] um i would say so yes 

13.13 15.98 A: yeah more friends than acquaintances 

15.58 16.65 B: uh 

17.10 24.27 B: well it seems to be the people that are my acquaintances are generally my friends as well like i don't really have 

24.36 28.19 B: people that i know that i don't hang out with you know what i'm saying 

27.46 28.31 A: uh-huh 

29.18 37.93 B: [mn] so i have a few good friends and then a bunch of say peripheral friends and then maybe a couple of acquaintances 

32.33 34.06 A: yeah 

35.62 37.40 A: mhm 

37.78 39.54 A: yeah 

38.97 40.43 B: how bout yourself 

40.83 43.28 A: uh i have very few 

43.49 51.55 A: good friends yeah it's about the same i i think i have a a wider variety of acquaintances lots of acquaintances lots of people i uh 

52.52 62.36 A: [lipsmack] i know are or you know sort of know or some- one of my friends knows and who i end up hanging out with but not necessarily of my own accord 

62.57 67.64 B: um how bout a you guess there are people you work with your friends [laughter] or 

67.74 69.32 B: are they your enemies 

69.52 71.39 A: what 

70.20 74.66 B: people you work with are do you consider them your friends or like 

73.88 74.99 A: um 

75.78 83.45 A: not really i just in the just when i'm working with them i talk to them but outside i i i don't really 

83.07 85.91 B: you think that's just 'cause of your workplace or 

86.70 96.21 A: uh well i think it's because they're all considerably older than i am like the the two people i work with closest one of whom is uh 

87.13 88.42 B: take it as 

96.36 99.41 A: like forty and the other one is maybe fifty 

98.90 101.93 B: yeah i'm sure [laughter] that has a lot a lot to do with it 

101.55 112.22 A: yeah [laughter] so you know i can- i mean i get along fine with them when i'm in working uh in my lab but when i'm not you know i don't really really see them at all 

111.81 115.63 B: yeah you wouldn't ne- then you wouldn't hang out of work 

114.08 115.11 A: yeah 

115.70 117.11 A: uh how 'bout you 

117.74 124.39 B: in other words um it's different where i work there's a actually the company i used to work for that went out of business a lot of us 

120.00 120.85 A: uh-huh 

124.77 131.63 B: are still friends even though we've been split up due to layoffs or finding new jobs and that sort of thing 

125.73 128.63 A: (( yeah )) 

131.71 138.24 B: and uh we're actually it's kinda much like going to college in a way we're all like this sort of similar age and 

137.82 138.65 A: uh-huh 

138.63 143.86 B: kinda bonded as the company grew and then fell apart [laughter] 

143.77 145.49 A: yeah 

144.26 145.43 B: and uh 

146.44 148.91 B: so most people did come along to the new place 

149.49 154.18 B: and but in general the new place i work there is older people there and 

154.85 159.64 B: they're pretty cool and stuff but i wouldn't necessarily hang out with them outside of work 

156.97 159.82 A: mhm 

159.93 162.40 B: like the old place i would [sigh] 

163.32 168.14 A: yeah i mean are most of your friends from where you used to work 

168.23 169.17 B: excuse me 

169.22 171.96 A: are most of your friends from where you used to work all 

171.67 177.95 B: uh no that's just like ah i've just made new friends that way i'm guessing to make new friends 

175.42 177.10 A: right 

179.07 180.15 B: by 

179.25 180.96 A: yeah 

180.16 183.35 B: work meeting people at work or through my 

183.60 185.48 A: mhm 

183.68 185.72 B: older friends i guess you could say 

185.79 191.17 B: i generally don't meet somebody and then become their friend you know out of the blue it's always through somebody else 

191.17 192.90 A: yeah 

191.70 193.18 B: or through the workplace 

195.10 204.17 A: yeah oh well i don't i don't think it is planned i really try to meet anybody new i think i've got enough people [laughter] 

202.07 207.46 B: [laughter] yes i just was saying the same thing the other day [laughter] 

206.82 208.90 A: [laughter] 

208.38 214.56 B: it's like hey you should come meet meet so and so blah blah blah you need more friends i'm like nah i don't need any more friends [laughter] 

213.87 218.84 A: ah i don't have time to see the people i do know i don't really need need more people 

216.88 218.18 B: yeah i agree 

219.20 220.63 B: i agree 

221.88 222.59 A: (( ah )) 

223.20 225.96 B: um [laughter] what else can we talk about now 

225.21 230.35 A: (( [laughter] i don't )) 

228.70 230.94 B: [laughter] uh that's kinda lame i think [laughter] 

230.69 235.69 A: know yeah ha- have you done this before is like this your first call or 

235.07 237.11 B: yes very first call i 

236.50 238.10 A: yeah mine too 

237.12 241.52 B: said i was available between two and four and they called right at [laughter] two o'clock 

243.98 245.68 A: yeah 

243.99 244.97 B: but uh 

245.28 250.86 B: let me think what can we friends wise yeah how many friends do you have from say 

251.32 253.62 B: being young like in high school [sigh] 

253.55 255.65 A: [laughter] in high school um 

255.76 263.82 A: i don't think i really have any any any more all them are all of them gradu- graduated a couple of years ago 

264.13 274.35 A: i have a lot of friends who are out at college at this point um who i see or some of them still work in philadelphia so i see them and 

274.40 276.85 A: others show up occasionally you 

277.09 280.30 A: know like come down when they feel like it 

281.23 286.68 B: mm so i mean you're not living i mean your friends from high school you're just out of touch 'cause of uh 

286.69 287.93 A: (( i i i see )) 

287.15 289.29 B: geography or 'cause of you just 

288.29 291.77 A: (( them well i mean i see )) 

292.60 305.55 A: um i guess i see i have two friends at this point i only really have two friends from from high school i mean and they're actually earlier than high school um most of my friends from high school yeah i just stopped 

305.77 312.06 A: uh i still see them when i go home um which is home's in ohio but um 

312.59 316.58 B: (( hold on a second my uh my son's dialing so i'll switch over to the other one )) 

312.80 314.55 A: i don't 

315.98 317.06 A: what 

316.82 319.24 B: my son's battery's dying hold on 

318.97 320.91 A: (( oh all right )) 

322.69 323.79 B: [noise] 

323.46 333.89 A: all right yeah so i mean i see my my friends from high school when i go home but otherwise uh i don't really ever see them the other two friends i have uh one's gone to new york and one's in chicago 

324.57 325.22 B: (( so )) 

333.84 344.98 A: and then i i talk to you know i see the guy in new york a lot more frequently than i do the guy in chicago and i don't talk to either of them more than maybe once a month once every other month but we stay more or less in contact 

346.18 352.08 B: you think uh email and stuff like that has uh affected the friendships 

348.13 349.93 A: yeah 

351.81 353.41 A: yeah it definitely helps 

353.37 361.51 B: yeah i totally agree like probably half the people i wouldn't necessarily be in constant contact with if it wasn't for email 

360.53 362.34 A: mhm 

361.70 364.32 B: 'cause i don't like uh call people very often 

364.07 365.83 A: yeah 

364.84 369.32 B: on the phone's more email conversations or even instant messenger 

369.35 370.80 A: mhm 

369.68 373.36 B: even more immediate and actually more fun [laughter] 

372.91 379.20 A: right i suppose you can email someone and you know get back to and they get back to you whenever they feel like so 

374.13 375.23 B: it's more like a 

378.77 380.18 B: exactly 

379.58 382.77 A: that's yeah definitely more convenient 

383.35 387.24 B: i have to s- i don't have many friends from high school left although 

387.79 391.01 B: it's more just 'cause we went to college and fell out of touch 

391.09 392.93 A: yeah 

391.64 395.30 B: but i'm pretty sure that a lot of them if 

395.76 397.39 B: we got back in touch 

397.52 399.28 A: mhm 

397.69 412.29 B: or they move back in the area we we'd become friends you know again and it's kinda the same with uh my college friends like i know that say i haven't seem 'em in months or talked to them in a month when i see 'em we like pick up where we left off 

404.71 406.37 A: yeah 

409.26 411.02 A: mhm 

413.61 420.24 B: you know like like we see each other at each others weddings and stuff like that and it seems like 

413.87 415.69 A: yeah 

419.96 422.30 A: (( yeah i have that same same feeling )) 

420.94 422.81 B: the good old days 

423.94 430.04 A: it's ni- it's nice not having to be able to just pick up without having to fill in the details you know 

430.79 436.63 B: yeah that's the good thing about email 'cause i really kinda keep in touch and update on people 

436.50 438.38 A: yeah 

437.15 441.02 B: so you see each other it's not like you hadn't it's more 

441.76 445.76 B: oh no informal i guess if you're in touch with that person through email 

443.62 445.40 A: mhm 

446.06 454.43 B: but if you haven't actually been in touch with them then you have to catch up with all the stuff and it seems more phony in a way [laughter] 

446.12 447.79 A: yeah 

450.99 452.71 A: mhm 

454.19 455.87 A: yeah 

454.43 464.49 B: okay how're you doing and what're you doing these days like there's questions that i just like kinda sound like the person really doesn't care but feels obligated to ask them [laughter] 

457.05 458.85 A: mhm 

463.38 466.05 A: yeah yeah that's nice 

467.46 469.28 A: (( so you know when you're )) 

469.51 476.71 A: like there's if you see someone all the time and you have to know what's going on with them all the time if you see someone you know once every three months 

476.99 486.75 A: then like where where are you right now what are you doing sort of covers it but you don't really really care about the details [noise] of that person's every day of existence uh 

481.55 482.33 B: yeah 

489.02 490.94 B: yeah i agree 

491.60 494.36 B: do you have a best friend i don't have a 

494.39 498.39 A: do i have a best friend uh i have a couple of 

495.48 496.48 B: (( best friend [laughter] )) 

498.45 503.36 A: couple of very close friends uh one of the like this guy who's in chicago 

503.63 511.25 A: and the guy who's in new york are very close friends and i've got one or two here in in uh philly 

511.77 513.28 A: how 'bout yourself 

513.95 517.16 B: no i wouldn't say i have a best friend 

516.66 517.76 A: mhm 

517.27 523.53 B: like i think that's more it seems to be more a female thing than a male thing to have a best friend that 

523.48 524.38 A: yeah 

523.88 525.73 B: you confide everything in 

526.87 536.56 B: it just dep- on certain friends like know certain things about me and that i would talk to them about and they wouldn't know other things about me and stuff like that it just seems to be 

534.43 535.24 A: (( mm )) 

537.04 540.14 B: uh whichever friend 

539.34 541.13 A: yeah 

540.37 543.89 B: and uh it's doesn't necessarily have to be a guy either it can be a girl 

544.33 546.17 A: mhm 

544.36 549.66 B: depends on the situation on who i would call up to talk to [laughter] on the phone 

548.70 553.93 A: yeah now there are some things that are definitely easier to talk to a with girls than with guys [lipsmack] 

553.85 554.85 B: that's true 

557.23 559.80 B: would you s- would you say you split 

560.12 563.35 B: male friends female friends fifty fifty or is it uh 

562.75 566.21 A: no i think it's definitely more male friends than female friends 

566.29 567.26 A: um 

567.79 570.04 A: yeah there are 

571.00 575.41 A: i've had female friends in the past who uh it just sort of lose 

575.56 576.70 A: um 

577.24 590.99 A: lose things in common over time they just tend to have more in common with them whereas guys all seem to probably the same basic i don't know how to describe it 'cause the the basic trajectory th- that guys follow i'm not sure 

590.75 591.86 B: [laughter] 

592.71 599.89 B: yeah i think there's often more just things in common like a lot of times just talking to my friends i talk about sports
