148.72 149.77 B: mhm 

157.99 163.93 A: it's it's so hot here in the summer that you really can't do and it's so muggy and uh 

163.58 164.99 B: oh really 

164.11 173.82 A: there's so much you really can't do outside like so summer used to mean and like warm weather to me used to mean kind of like upper eighties maybe some breeze um 

166.41 167.60 B: mhm 

172.73 174.21 B: mhm 

173.92 185.62 A: um and uh like the ability to go outside whereas wintertime was just so dark and so cold and and it was so much snowing and and um shoveling all the time that it really 

185.52 193.79 A: i didn't enj- you know it was good for like a month but it would last from like november through through april we'd have like wintertime and 

194.01 203.56 A: then i moved to philly and it was like like summertime that you couldn't go outside after june 'cause it was so 'cause it's so disgustingly hot and um 

198.74 199.33 B: (( [laughter] )) 

202.55 205.10 B: really i don't know what the weather's like over there 

204.84 206.06 A: really well 

206.16 207.59 B: really hot 

206.78 212.63 A: [lipsmack] it's really hot and it's there's like no breeze and it's really humid and um 

209.96 210.72 B: (( mm )) 

212.54 224.89 A: i didn't think it was going to be that bad um because i was like you know coming from sort of the northeast i figured that well philadelphia's still in the northeast but it's haven't because of sort of like the 

214.51 215.60 B: mhm 

221.01 222.43 B: mhm 

224.86 232.94 A: currents of air i don't even know i don't think it's gulf stream at that point but um you know because of everything else it was just it just gets so 

228.13 229.53 B: mhm 

232.99 238.13 A: so muggy to the point that there's this um sort of distinct philadelphia style 

237.90 239.01 B: mhm 

238.40 246.19 A: of um guys in particular will like shave their heads in the summertime and walk around with just wet rags on their heads 

245.82 247.14 B: (( uh-huh ooh )) 

246.67 261.55 A: it's like not even hats and it's not even like fancy rags it's just like whatever kind of towel you can have you get it wet maybe it's your t-shirt maybe like you've taken off your t-shirt and you've jumped in the fire hydrant and you just walk around in it and it's funny like i've never seen that before but 

248.71 249.57 B: (( [laughter] )) 

251.53 253.74 B: mm very attractive [laughter] 

255.38 256.43 B: yeah 

259.22 260.11 B: (( mm )) 

260.93 262.70 B: that's really weird because i thought 

262.47 276.18 B: california was you know has the hottest weather but i mean we get really hot during summer we get up to like maybe a hundred a hundred and ten even sometimes and but it really kind of rarely gets muggy like that i mean i just couldn't stand it if it was like that 

268.46 269.52 A: mhm 

273.31 274.88 A: yeah 

275.76 279.07 A: it's dry and what what part of california are you in 

276.92 277.65 B: uh 

278.87 283.37 B: well i'm in southern california near uh magic mountain i don't know if you're familiar with them 

281.73 282.64 A: okay 

283.08 287.76 A: um a little bit i've i've traveled over there a little bit um and 

286.09 294.84 B: yeah so yeah especially in and out here in in this area it gets really really hot and then um but it really does not get you know 

291.56 292.65 A: mhm 

295.00 303.29 B: um muggy like that sometimes it does and i just i just couldn't stand it if it was always like that because uh it's just a 

300.79 302.38 A: yeah yeah 

303.44 305.65 B: ooh [laughter] 

304.76 307.98 A: it's just you can't you can't even you can't breathe 

307.34 309.50 B: breathe exactly 

308.07 316.96 A: you can't like you know and like i said i used totally used to think i was like a summer person but you know forget about it gross 

313.17 314.75 B: yeah 

315.58 319.87 B: but then you also get like you get your really tough winters huh 

319.83 328.06 A: yeah which this winter was like really tough you know i'm sort of hoping that it makes that it keeps the summer mild for a while but like 

323.86 324.94 B: yeah 

327.11 328.57 B: yeah 

327.96 342.14 A: but for me the winter this this winter was sort of what i'm used to expecting from from massachusetts and i lived in wolster massachusetts which is there's some um in western mass they have all these there're some mountains 

335.05 335.93 B: (( mm )) 

341.78 343.24 B: mhm 

342.15 343.72 A: [lipsmack] and so 

343.65 346.47 A: for whatever reason like you get the um 

346.41 360.99 A: like the breeze off the ocean and sort of like a salty warmer kind of front comes in off the off the water 'cause we're about like forty five fifty miles in from the coast and then on the left side you get the they're not like huge mountains but like you know the 

352.02 352.89 B: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

360.95 369.47 A: western hills and stuff and when when they meet they like sort of the pressure fronts tend to meet right above wolster [laughter] in the valley there 

369.25 382.54 A: so we get dumped on with snow like you know like whenever you watch the forecast it'll be you know tell you like oh you get like maybe like three inches in boston and like you know two inches in new york and wolster will get like six inches like 

371.24 372.67 B: oh gosh 

374.32 375.26 B: mhm 

380.57 381.78 B: yeah 

382.67 388.78 A: so when philadelphians are complaining about it this past winter i was like y'all know nothing like [laughter] 

385.73 386.29 B: (( [mn] )) 

387.24 392.04 B: [laughter] so do you ski with like with all the snow and everything

408.15 409.06 B: uh-huh 

408.42 423.02 A: um but they would do it so that like you know if if you buy ten tickets you get one free kinda thing like with all these airlines so basically we would go skiing through the french alps for three weeks for for like two weeks for like six of the years when i was growing up um 

413.66 414.84 B: mhm
