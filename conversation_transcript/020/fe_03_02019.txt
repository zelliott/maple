6.81 8.68 A: yes yes 

6.88 8.02 B: angel 

8.42 9.32 B: yes 

9.52 15.46 B: ah what do you think of ah what the government can do about corporate scandal [laughter] 

16.67 17.46 A: (( mm )) 

17.60 22.06 A: that's a tough one [laughter] i i really don't know if there is too much that they can 

22.47 25.10 A: do to curb it or 

25.52 31.33 B: well one example that showed their ineffectiveness is 

35.09 38.46 B: big accounting firms that audit these big companies 

39.34 40.41 A: (( yes )) 

41.06 44.06 B: (( well they have ah an audit p- )) 

44.08 48.66 B: part of their company and they have a 

49.69 50.76 B: corporate 

50.83 53.72 B: consultant part of their company 

54.90 59.78 B: and they're in the same company and they advise companies on 

60.12 61.74 B: how to run their company 

62.88 65.96 B: and then they audit their books at the end of the year 

66.02 67.51 B: in the same company 

66.13 66.97 A: yeah 

69.28 75.32 B: and there's a lot of people and it's proven out that ah 

75.92 78.73 B: they have when they advise the company 

78.99 83.51 B: they want their audit to show success for their advice 

84.58 89.57 B: and they got and there's people that are trying to break that up and say if you're going to 

89.71 92.13 B: be in the corporate consulting 

92.80 97.78 B: you shouldn't be in the auditing at the same time they should be two separate entities 

98.66 103.85 B: but the government in effect can't br- pass any laws or do anything to break them up 

104.70 107.21 B: so what you have is 

108.89 110.32 B: companies 

110.73 120.09 B: running the audit and are jiggling the books to make things look good because of the advice they receive from audit firms 

121.62 122.76 A: yeah 

123.59 126.73 B: they can't do anything about it the government won't do anything about it 

127.58 128.40 A: (( [mn] ah i )) 

134.43 139.17 A: guess it's something i've never really thought about not much on corporate business 

139.04 140.48 B: yeah 

139.89 140.73 A: um 

141.33 143.87 A: no i know there's ways that they can do it 

144.27 147.05 A: and check stuff out but [mn] 

148.42 156.80 B: they catch the little guy with his hand in the till but they don't catch the big guys too often and when they do they let them off the hook 

156.67 158.28 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

158.64 162.21 A: like martha s- is that kind of what martha stewart yeah 

160.71 163.47 B: yeah martha stewart's an example 

162.87 164.15 A: yeah 

163.90 168.21 B: she's still free she's not in jail or anything 

167.71 170.77 A: no and [mn] that's just it they won't do nothing to her 

170.48 171.89 B: right 

171.31 176.47 A: or anybody you know anyone that they catch they give them a little fine that is 

176.80 177.78 A: you know it's 

178.70 181.51 A: not even comparable with the money and stuff 

181.09 182.34 B: right 

181.55 183.14 A: that's been taken and 

183.33 185.26 B: right 

186.27 187.18 A: don't 

189.55 191.40 A: and they need some kind of better 

191.64 194.06 A: system of checks and balances i reckon 

194.04 195.09 B: right

251.05 252.99 A: stuff around where i live 

252.61 254.43 B: yeah 

255.04 257.93 A: but [mn] corporate stuff really ain't my 

258.53 259.86 B: bag huh 

258.98 261.39 A: i i guess you'd say cup of tea [laughter] 

260.83 262.99 B: (( [mn] right )) 

262.74 263.57 A: um 

264.54 270.91 B: (( well you do know the economy's down and a lot of it's due to corporate scandals )) 

266.99 267.99 A: yeah 

270.80 271.83 A: yeah 

272.39 278.38 A: i know a lot of people are afraid to invest their money and stuff because of like what happened with enron and 

278.96 280.56 A: all that stuff 

279.90 282.39 B: dw- c._d._w. 

283.01 284.23 A: excuse me 

284.22 285.28 B: c. 

285.31 287.97 B: i think it's called c._d._w. was 

288.17 290.66 B: into accounting fraud too 

290.48 291.95 A: oh yeah 

291.86 293.78 B: a a telephone company 

294.31 299.07 A: yeah i i remember reading something on here something about that stuff 

301.36 308.25 B: and people lost their confidence in the stock market and they've lost their confidence in a lot of things 

304.30 305.70 A: (( i don't know yeah )) 

308.54 312.59 A: i know my husband has lost a lot on his 401k 

313.20 315.95 A: just just in the past year really 

315.89 317.80 B: yeah 

318.10 325.54 A: we've um changed everything around so we ain't losing so much it's it's not gaining anything but at least it's not losing either 

325.46 326.46 B: right 

326.18 327.16 A: [laughter] 

327.26 330.74 B: i guess the safest way to go is the big companies 

330.78 331.70 A: yeah 

331.07 332.70 B: (( ibm )) 

334.63 335.52 A: yeah 

336.10 338.75 B: (( some of the big companies are way down )) 

338.91 343.07 B: ford's way down general motors is way down 

342.90 344.18 A: yeah 

344.64 347.94 B: walmart isn't but they're down 

347.73 352.54 A: no [mn] and walmart's one of the companies i kind of wonder about um 

354.16 355.12 A: the 

356.08 362.34 A: fraud and stuff i know where where we live there was just recently a big ice storm i mean huge ice storm 

362.50 365.60 A: and the stores and stuff was closed for like a week 

365.36 366.54 B: yeah 

365.93 367.94 A: well walmart was open 

368.06 369.14 A: selling 

369.52 377.94 A: um lanterns and all this stuff they got truckloads in but yet they still said they lost lots of money on the storm but people was out buying 

378.86 388.37 A: lanterns and candles and batteries and stuff like craz- yeah from walmart i mean they got in truckloads and stuff and it all went people was like 

381.98 383.50 B: from walmart 

388.81 394.39 A: they was hoarding it because we didn't know when we was going to get our electric back on i mean it was a big mess 

392.30 395.32 B: right where are you at 

395.13 403.90 A: it was a big mess and we had went we had to buy a generator and everything but yet when we watched the news walmart said they lost all this money because of this storm 

403.90 405.19 B: (( yeah )) 

404.63 407.37 A: and me and my husband both was like there ain't no way 

407.22 410.22 B: (( yeah where minnesota )) 

408.14 409.38 A: not walmart 

410.32 412.74 A: no we live [mn] west virginia 

412.08 413.51 B: oh west virginia 

412.75 417.44 A: yes there was i mean a bad ice storm come through here in february 

416.12 416.98 B: oh 

417.70 418.89 B: (( oh [cough] )) 

419.60 422.81 A: yeah we didn't have electric telephone nothing 

422.99 423.75 B: (( gee )) 

424.50 425.41 A: and um 

425.58 429.52 A: i don't know to me it just seemed weird that they said they lost all that money 

429.20 430.71 B: yeah 

430.52 435.74 A: and i don't know if there's someone who can who checks in on that stuff and [mn] say there ain't no way 

435.55 436.71 B: yeah 

436.18 441.91 A: or if there's way they do their book you know you don't want point fingers at people and everything but 

442.06 445.68 B: maybe they gained money there and lost it somewhere else 

445.08 447.04 A: yeah [mn] you know 

446.16 451.06 B: but they say they lost money and everybody says well they didn't make any money on it then 

450.68 458.24 A: well i know there was where we live there's like four walmarts within [mn] half hour of us you go each direction 

458.02 459.06 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

458.43 462.39 A: and the walmart one way they had to throw all their um 

462.85 473.48 A: frozen stuff and their refrigerated stuff out they had to throw all that out because they didn't have electric and then the other walmarts they got their electric back like in a day so their stuff was all right 

473.14 474.22 B: yeah 

473.65 478.44 A: so i mean they may have lost the money if they had that happen at very many stores 

478.15 479.32 B: yeah 

478.74 483.35 A: but most of the towns had their electric back on within a day or two 

482.96 484.33 B: yeah 

484.37 487.21 A: and we live out in the country and 

486.58 487.89 B: yeah 

487.28 488.60 A: and everything s- 

488.37 489.71 B: yeah 

489.76 495.49 A: i don't know [mn] i guess maybe you know not thinking of that they may have had some stores 

496.33 497.23 A: (( but )) 

498.34 501.66 B: it's hard to believe that walmart would be in this scandal 

501.61 502.80 A: oh yeah 

503.23 506.24 B: that's sort of like the all american store 

507.62 509.20 A: yeah yeah it's just 

508.51 511.08 B: (( american flag and all the rest )) 

511.34 512.39 A: yeah 

514.62 516.33 B: yet they might be 

516.23 518.89 A: yeah i guess anybody you know it's just 

518.77 523.20 B: it depends on how they they did the accounting on it i guess 

522.52 523.50 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

524.65 529.40 A: yeah and you can always get one sour apple that's embezzling money you know anywhere 

529.06 530.42 B: right 

529.96 533.05 A: the even the smallest of little stores and stuff 

532.69 534.17 B: right 

536.89 540.46 B: yeah these big companies you don't know what to make of what they say 

540.68 546.64 A: yeah well too and if the government like we said you know would start giving them a little bit stiffer penalty 

546.68 554.37 A: i mean if you fine them twenty five thousand dollars and they've frauded you you know out of millions that twenty five thousand ain't nothing 

555.45 557.48 B: mhm 

560.92 567.15 A: i don't know i guess if i lived in a bigger city it the stuff probably would affect a little bit more but 

567.63 571.25 B: affect small towns just as much as it does big cities [noise] 

571.40 572.40 A: yeah 

578.77 579.80 A: (( i don't know )) 

581.31 585.09 A: where we live out there's been a lot of you know since the 

586.60 593.85 A: enron stuff and all these companies [mn] there's been a lot of stores going out of business around where i live 

594.12 597.36 A: about the only thing left is walmart and krogers [laughter] 

597.30 598.44 B: yeah
