18.47 22.74 A: okay so what i'm sorry i didn't really get the topic of the day [laughter] 

22.50 28.79 B: the topic is corporate scandal and how what american government can do to curb corporate scandal 

28.41 31.06 A: okay all right go ahead 

31.32 35.97 B: you want my you want my thoughts on it or just you want me to spit some rhymes on it 

31.58 32.25 A: (( so )) 

35.38 37.67 A: [laughter] ah i'm on a cellphone 

37.41 39.09 B: you're on a cellphone right now 

38.99 40.21 A: yeah 

39.64 44.26 B: so what do you want what exactly do you want me to say just corporate about corporate scandal and such 

43.87 45.71 A: yeah like um 

45.92 49.28 A: 'cause i'm not too you know familiar with 

49.31 53.02 A: the whole you know corporate world and 

52.27 53.67 B: yeah me neither 

53.21 55.74 A: you know all that stuff so i don't 

55.93 57.35 A: i'm not you know 

57.42 60.69 A: i don't know too much about it i just know that you know 

60.90 62.87 A: big problem but um 

63.18 64.14 A: so 

64.18 65.40 A: what do you think 

65.20 67.83 B: well this is what i think about corporate scandals 

67.69 68.66 A: okay 

69.06 80.13 B: i i'm kind of torn between the issue right now because on one hand i think that business should be allowed to to i don't know run this country i think adam smith's 

74.22 74.83 A: (( okay )) 

79.89 86.68 B: wealth of nations and adam smith's free market or laissez faire economy is what really drives this country 

85.34 86.09 A: right 

86.45 87.52 A: okay 

86.87 99.44 B: but on the other hand i think we've come to a point where big business has come to dominate not only the economic facet of this country but also the political and social facet of this country and i don't think 

97.37 98.58 A: i would 

98.88 100.83 A: i'd have to agree with you yes 

100.69 102.42 B: you don't agree with me 

101.82 103.72 A: i would have to agree with you 

103.09 106.86 B: oh you would have to agree with me well that's good i'm glad we're in agreement what's your name 

104.77 105.50 A: yes 

106.92 108.19 A: toni may 

108.07 109.39 B: toni may 

109.10 109.95 A: yes 

109.72 112.45 B: well i'm glad we're in agreement on this should i continue 

112.33 113.76 A: continue please 

113.38 116.08 B: okay well like i was saying 

115.46 116.77 A: (( right right )) 

116.75 122.59 B: like as i think that it is nec- is necessary for businesses to 

122.45 124.05 B: i don't know to determine 

123.83 127.40 B: the economic progress of this country i also think that they've 

127.28 141.67 B: come to a point where it's they're determining too much of the progress of this country and i think more power needs to be restored to the country and like we've seen in enron and other major corporate scandals the government needs to step in and make sure that they're not taking advantage of the common man 

130.95 131.64 A: right 

137.02 137.72 A: right 

141.51 144.21 B: and they're not taking advantage of the stock holder 

143.71 144.87 A: (( right )) 

144.77 145.67 B: okay 

145.93 153.34 B: all like and i think the government has a role in stepping in and saying that no you can't pull the wool over the eyes 'cause i mean 

153.31 162.32 B: i think the average american is fairly educated and knows what's going on but they don't necessarily understand the inner workings and the internal workings of the corporate world 

161.82 163.04 A: right okay 

162.12 166.64 B: and i don't think they should be taken advantage of which is i think what happened with enron 

166.44 177.16 B: these people buy stock and then the the c._e._o.s and the other big wigs of this company take advantage of them and they don't really know what's going on and i don't think that's fair 

172.64 173.75 A: right 

176.60 177.60 A: no 

177.38 184.98 B: no i don't think that's fair i think the government has a job and has a responsibility to step in and make sure this kind of thing doesn't go on 

184.78 194.14 A: right i definitely agree with you but the thing is how does how would you suggest the government do that like set up guidelines set up um 

194.23 203.13 A: you know like what there should be government officials coming in to these com- um companies once in a while to check up on them or 

203.26 205.96 A: or you know like how exactly 

205.61 217.87 B: mm that's a very good question and a pressing issue in today's contemporary society what i suggest is that com- companies be left alone because we do still indeed exist in a laissez faire economy 

217.57 218.46 A: uh-huh 

217.87 231.74 B: but i also think that if there seems to be irregularities in the economy and if certain companies seem to be making unreal profits or if people seem to be taken advantage of i think then 

231.60 240.19 B: certain monitors in the government need to step in and see that i think that the economy should be monitored in such a way that 

240.39 246.54 B: the businesses should be left alone but if certain extremities are caused or people 

246.68 256.62 B: see that businesses are taking too far advantage of the people then i think the government has a job to step in and and prevent this kind of thing from happening 

255.53 256.30 A: well 

257.13 262.44 A: yes i i agree but the the thing about this whole situation is 

262.52 272.62 A: that you know in the ideal world that's what you know we would love to happen but you know really is it even close to being realistic you know like 

266.52 267.86 B: right 

272.66 282.49 A: how like the common man really like you said know nothing about what's going on you know in the inner workings of you know corporate america 

279.02 280.05 B: mhm 

282.53 283.82 A: and um 

284.98 290.74 A: you know i don't think corporate america's really ready to let you know us know 

291.15 295.84 A: and i don't see how the government can really step in and make a difference 

295.78 307.48 B: well you know i you make a very good point and i think that it's very difficult for right now for the government to draw a line where they can intercede and where they can't because we still have a society where 

307.28 316.44 B: the government is still very scared and well and well they should be to step in and prevent a a company from doing such and such activity um 

317.30 319.21 B: mm good question 

319.72 333.15 B: i think unless there's existing doubt that the government is abusing or that a certain company is abusing privileges of pulling the wool over the eyes of their investors and certain stock holders they should be left alone um 

330.75 331.62 A: right 

333.19 341.07 B: i'm not very familiar with the inner workings of the government and i'm not very familiar with the legislature of government so i can't give you specific 

341.12 351.06 B: ah legislature on how the government should prevent this sort of thing from happening i mean i can't tell you that but i do think that there should be a certain line which with 

345.13 346.04 A: okay 

351.09 353.11 B: mm there should be a certain line 

354.31 360.40 B: where which the government should step in but for the most part companies and the economy should be left alone you know 

360.22 364.40 A: right like 'cause that's how it's been working and it's been working fine 

364.06 367.59 B: yeah i think it's a capitalist economy and that's where we should leave it 

367.37 371.56 A: right oh look look look look [laughter] 

372.85 373.87 A: yes 

374.74 379.57 A: okay [noise] i've yeah i don't i don't know you know like 

378.66 380.14 B: yeah 

380.53 382.37 A: it's it's a hard 

382.41 385.67 A: it's a you know it's a difficult 

385.31 389.67 B: [laughter] yeah it is a very difficult debate i would agree with you 

385.71 386.90 A: (( [noise] situation )) 

389.51 391.78 A: yeah and i really 

392.13 406.33 A: [noise] i really don't know like you said i i mean it's easy to say the government should step in but you know how and when you know i guess it's really when you know when does it become too much and you know 

405.02 405.94 B: mm 

406.75 410.12 A: you know what i'm saying like when have they 

408.87 410.89 B: when like you're you're asking me 

411.02 419.08 B: you're asking me for a definite point in which the government should have authorization to step in and prevent certain companies from abusing their rights 

419.56 421.83 A: right exactly 

420.36 421.33 B: (( mm )) 

421.84 423.23 A: (( you know like um )) 

422.50 423.81 B: yeah 

425.01 428.25 A: and the whole thing is because of 

428.28 437.84 A: you know how the whole um how america works and how you know capitalist nations works a lot of times you know 

438.40 442.44 A: these big businesses have certain you know 

442.94 454.76 A: ins into the government you know what i'm saying and so it's all you know a big mess whereby you'll never really know because you know there might be some kind of you know underhanded 

448.41 449.29 B: yeah 

454.82 456.52 A: thing going on and 

455.69 460.13 B: yeah yeah
