61.40 69.29 B: and i like warm water lakes and ponds i prefer i prefer uh that over stream fishing

75.55 77.86 B: (( yeah )) 

76.53 79.94 A: (( okay and uh how often would you say you fish off to shore )) 

79.84 83.17 B: well in eastern colorado we have plenty 

82.20 83.48 A: (( okay mhm mhm mhm wow )) 

83.23 89.35 B: yeah in western colorado there's not too much mostly mountain stream fishing 

84.99 85.87 A: (( and it's )) 

88.79 92.56 A: (( your little secret i guess yeah how do you find out about it if others )) 

92.04 106.54 B: nope not well 'cause i don't like trout [laughter] i've had enough trout and that's always it's always in the streams up here and uh you know and a lot of the 

93.54 95.26 A: (( don't uh find out about it )) 

100.83 102.06 A: (( okay that's )) 

106.97 116.26 B: uh uh warm water well you got your perch and you got your bass and you got your bluebills and you know the other thing that are really really good table uh quality fish there for 

116.28 123.38 B: you know for eating purposes i'm not a i'm not a sportsmanlike that catches and releases or goes for trophies i 

121.56 122.42 A: (( great )) 

123.18 132.19 B: i go fishing for sheer enjoyment you know to crack a beer open sit back and uh wait for something to bite yeah so 

128.28 129.39 A: (( right right )) 

129.60 132.36 A: (( mhm right well you get catch less )) 

132.68 135.11 B: and uh yeah 

133.60 135.77 A: (( fish in those places )) 

135.49 145.20 B: yeah yeah that's that's that's the whole plan [laughter] so we either fish off the shore or we take the boat either way 

138.97 140.56 A: (( i guess well i've been )) 

144.77 148.33 A: (( uh i've been lacking in outdoor activities recently i used to i )) 

148.94 155.78 B: well it depends on the lakes some places you they're small and they don't let you bring boats into so uh 

156.07 157.49 B: it depends uh 

157.76 166.31 B: we have one in particular that we like to fish at that that uh is not open all the time they they close it down for several years so 

166.29 175.20 B: that the you know the uh fish can uh grow and uh vegetation can regenerate around there it's kinda like a special reserve 

175.51 184.04 B: and uh when they do open it up hardly anybody knows about it so you're typically the only one there you got this whole 

184.07 191.76 B: well i'd say it's probably about uh about fifty to sixty acre uh size you know little pond 

191.30 191.96 A: (( used to )) 

192.42 198.99 B: and uh some of the best bass and perch uh you know you you could ever imagine [laughter] 

198.03 198.86 A: (( live )) 

198.95 201.25 A: (( in california and would do quite a bit of )) 

201.56 204.12 B: well yeah 

202.32 206.48 A: (( backpacking and uh climbing some fishing in sierra nevada's )) 

206.43 208.88 B: well we someone over the internet 

209.35 215.64 B: actually was talking a- about uh hot places that they know of and they just kinda let us know 

215.48 216.65 A: (( not as )) 

216.72 218.16 B: so that's uh 

218.71 220.19 B: that's you know 

220.25 228.05 B: that's one of the places we go to the other places are we typically go fish are lakes that they do not allow um [lipsmack] 

228.13 236.71 B: you know personal water craft and all that kinda stuff on and if you do bring a boat on there there's a you know a wake less regulations so you can't 

236.92 239.23 B: you can't break a wake you can't go fast you 

238.77 239.55 A: (( much )) 

239.55 250.48 B: know strictly you know uh for fishing stuff like that and they close it down in the in the wintertime during the during waterfall season so you know
