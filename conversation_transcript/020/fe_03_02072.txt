275.37 286.89 B: you know the insects and all that kinda stuff but now i i have a greater appreciation for that so i just kinda like to look at the trees the flowers the the plants and stuff like that when i'm outside 

287.02 294.48 B: um [cough] in addition to doing stuff like i'm not really into the camping thing or i'm not that much into 

293.85 297.20 A: i did that i was a girl scout i did that when i was young 

297.23 299.19 A: i gave that up like a bad habit 

298.95 302.92 B: [laughter] been there done that don't wanna go back 

302.62 305.72 A: the bugs i am a girl scout leader currently 

305.61 317.81 A: and some of the city troops troop leaders don't go camping it's just a thing i'm not taking 'em out to the woods i'm not crapping in the woods it's not gonna happen and as i've gotten older i don't like bugs 

318.74 327.96 A: i don't like bugs coming into my house i'm not going out to where they normally live and call myself ooh i'm gonna sleep out here no 

327.96 329.16 B: [laughter] 

329.04 340.20 A: it's not gonna happen it's not within the realm of possible things my girls you know my troop they just have to get over it and go someplace else i did it when i was younger without complaining 

340.22 345.68 B: well i mean but [cough] i think when you're a kid you don't even think about things like 

346.21 352.65 B: bugs and you you don't i mean you're having so much fun playing with your friends and just doin' stuff 

351.30 352.98 A: it was exciting 

353.00 361.27 B: yeah but as you get older [laughter] you know your interests change or you know the things that used to bother you 

353.08 354.62 A: [laughter] 

361.32 368.94 B: when you were or didn't bother you when you were a kid a lot of times bother you as an adult 'cause you're like i just don't have time for that you know 

365.69 366.77 A: mhm 

368.52 379.06 A: it's like oh no i don't wanna kill ooh that wasn't it [laughter] yeah now my activities have changed i mean i end up doing inside stuff like i've 

369.79 373.56 B: (( hm )) 

379.40 386.80 A: walk but i don't usually get to walk outside i walk on my treadmill which isn't as fun but i put the t._v. on and you know 

386.66 397.16 A: and the time goes by for my treadmill and i can go out and walk but i actually our days have been back and forth you know like today it was around fifty five degrees 

397.40 407.43 A: and it's not it should be around sixty so it was a little cooler than it goes back and forth and our winter was real hard i can go out to um 

407.66 410.19 A: local parks i always feel more comfortable 

410.52 415.74 A: one way where i live one way you walk is decent and it's pretty and then the other way 

415.56 420.02 A: it starts going downhill [laughter] so i don't wanna 

419.83 431.81 A: well i could walk the way that was really nice but not downhill but i just you know i go on my treadmill and [mn] you know as long as it's exercise and trying to get myself exercise 

431.69 438.25 A: then if it's inside instead of outside sometimes within the summer though i get out more because i have my summers free 

438.67 447.68 A: and i can go out to like fairmount park which is the park system here go out to fairmount park and walk outside during the summer 

447.78 450.04 A: usually get up early in the morning 

450.32 455.48 A: you know on the early side because after i sleep in after a certain amount of time of sleeping in 

455.55 459.23 A: you know you can get up early and not have a big fuss over it 

458.76 460.55 B: (( right [cough] )) 

459.73 467.82 A: so um i do do that during the summer but not last summer the summer before and now i'm able to do it again 

467.91 471.47 A: this coming summer which we're all looking forward to [laughter] 

471.55 473.29 A: counting down the days 

473.05 475.28 B: i'm sure about that 

475.40 477.85 B: i have friends who are teachers 

475.43 476.27 A: (( so ))

518.85 527.61 A: mhm oh yeah it's a lot different up here we expect it now we didn't expect as much as we got but um we expected it 

527.95 542.94 A: uh you know we expect snow if this is a year and it doesn't snow we're surprised i mean you know we're just built in to expect it so no i was just curious if you like got to do like when you were a kid did you get to go outside and like just mhm
