145.36 147.47 A: (( that's right that's right )) 

148.28 151.66 B: so i don't know i think they they should 

151.89 163.45 B: cut that out definitely that that raises whatever prices we have to pay lowers the stocks it hurts the little people

541.70 547.55 B: it means nothing if you've run the business into the ground 

546.66 557.30 A: you've failed on it a lot of them have a long history of failing and they continue to hire them and pay them millions of dollars a year 

547.93 549.00 B: right 

551.40 552.69 B: oh yeah

567.48 569.84 B: and it it you know it it 

570.51 583.76 B: kills the business and then you know as a result the stock market's dropped to nothing and those of us putting our money into it will lose that money
