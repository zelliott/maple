410.77 417.46 A: well i tell you the truth well you know like i i i'm finding comfort in having just one or couple couple a close friends you know 

417.54 419.04 B: yeah 

418.40 426.40 A: instead of having a whole group of people that you gotta hang out with and associate 'cause some of the people i know around here man i wouldn't even really wanna hang out with 'em too much 

426.57 441.34 B: well that's what i got a few of my friends like that too one i went out with a couple of 'em one time and they're rowdy i mean we're driving down the road and they're cussing people out walking down the road and i'm looking at 'em like man what are you messing with that guy for all he's doing is walking down the road 

432.35 433.29 A: right 

440.50 444.01 A: yeah you don't need that hassle who puts you in situations where everyone gets in fucking trouble 

443.89 458.46 B: right and then we're driving down and the car goes up too close you know and he don't like it he'll start honking at 'em and cussing 'em out and i'm like since then i never went out with them guys again i'm like uh they said well why don't you go out and do something with us i'm like remember last time i 

450.29 451.19 A: mhm 

457.83 459.19 A: (( is that right )) 

458.70 462.79 B: said in that garbage you know you don't you don't mess with people like that 

461.94 467.84 A: no no so what what are your age your friends your age your age range of buddies that you hang out with 

467.93 472.16 B: well like i said the ones that are college they're only like nineteen or twenty 

471.47 472.38 A: okay 

472.19 474.81 B: which kinda surprised me 'cause me being forty seven 

474.76 476.05 A: right 

475.50 478.11 B: but you know they're ah they're great too 

477.75 478.73 A: okay

483.96 487.49 A: well they must find something in you that that they might wanna hang out with you know 

487.45 488.88 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

488.12 491.24 A: that's pretty cool and you have a your older buddy from church right 

491.60 494.61 B: well the one guy the older guy he's older than me 

494.12 495.44 A: mhm 

494.92 502.28 B: and i like i said i we used to like bowling together all the time recently i only talk to him on the phone he keeps trying to get me back to church 

501.80 503.08 A: right 

502.53 505.18 B: and i keep you know making excuses 

504.84 506.58 A: right any friends from work 

506.95 509.32 A: like security guards at work you hang out with 

507.10 507.93 B: (( no uh )) 

509.39 518.12 B: i don't have any from work i don't really hang out with any of them 'cause they uh i'm a perfectionist you know i figure that i do my job so good and i wanna be the best 

517.50 518.51 A: sure 

518.29 522.73 B: and the guys that are working with me don't meet to my well i'm a supervisor 

522.11 523.04 A: okay 

522.94 526.53 B: and they don't meet to my employer and i don't think they're doing a good job so 

526.09 527.74 A: nah they take up space huh 

527.83 530.32 B: yeah and that gives them and me a little bit of distance 

530.33 532.07 A: right right right 

531.72 534.29 B: and uh so [laughter] 

533.72 535.52 A: they're better off that way you know 

535.37 536.50 B: yeah 

535.79 537.58 A: don't lower your standards man 

538.00 538.86 B: what now 

538.48 540.64 A: i said don't lower your standards 

540.37 542.42 B: oh i'm not i'm not gonna do that 

541.83 549.23 A: you know that's like that's like some of the people i hang out with you know i was like the majority of the guys i grew up with like i get along really well 

542.70 543.82 B: yeah 

549.29 550.15 B: (( right [sigh] )) 

549.66 557.62 A: but they never like they hardly gra- some some didn't even graduate from high school it's kinda tough to talk with a good good conv- good level with them you know 

557.50 558.71 B: yeah 

558.12 562.58 A: 'cause it's all much pretty much they come home they they get their pay checks and they're at the bar 

562.66 566.02 A: that's pretty much one way conversations man 

562.70 564.51 B: yeah 

566.22 567.67 B: right 

566.66 575.38 A: you know my buddy from college i don't get a a chance to see too much but we have more more uh roundabout way of talking and a more universal conversation 

575.44 576.63 B: yeah 

575.90 581.83 A: which is pretty good man i thrive on that kinda stuff 'cause that that without that kinda shit i don't wanna become stagnant you know 

581.87 582.64 B: yep 

583.85 591.48 B: well i would've died if i saw my friends from high school i mean if i if i had the money i'd sort a detective out just to find 'em just so i could see what they're doing 

584.00 584.68 A: (( so )) 

590.93 594.55 A: right right right there's organizations that do that kinda stuff i see 

594.51 595.73 B: yeah 

595.14 596.06 A: you know 

596.24 599.89 B: i've done a people search for them on the computer at times and uh nothing
