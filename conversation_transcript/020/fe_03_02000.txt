0.65 2.21 B: hi i'm tammy 

1.88 3.16 A: i'm lee 

2.96 5.15 B: hi um okay 

5.50 13.29 B: wow they would give us a tough topic [laughter] um i think that as far as any of the illegal stuff goes on um i 

13.82 15.93 B: (( believe that doing the under cover stuff is the )) 

17.61 19.19 B: (( best way to handle it )) 

18.15 19.81 A: i i can't hear you 

19.84 21.47 B: i'm sorry is this better 

21.17 22.56 A: yeah now it's better 

21.58 25.86 B: okay i i i believe in um putting people in under cover 

27.02 32.41 B: for for that type of stuff to to try to find out what's going on illegal and then 

32.44 33.39 B: um 

33.98 36.61 B: that would probably be the bet- better way to stop it 

36.53 38.53 A: you mean in corporate scandal aha 

37.97 39.88 B: (( yeah )) 

42.22 46.21 A: yeah that's one day one way to do it i mean uh 

43.51 44.52 B: [laughter] 

46.61 54.24 A: another way is to um well like what they are doing now is just you know post stricter um 

54.58 57.37 A: laws govern- governing financial 

56.98 58.64 B: but people break laws 

59.47 62.10 A: everybody breaks laws um or 

60.94 66.05 B: yeah you gotta try to do the sneaky stuff i always believe in doing it sneaky 

66.28 69.38 B: um trying to do something outright 

70.65 79.32 B: means that you are giving people a heads up of what's going on and when they know what's going on and they find ways to get around it but if you're sneaky and they don't know what's going on 

79.81 81.94 B: (( then i think you'll get more accomplished )) 

81.81 84.32 A: (( they catch them in the act )) 

84.51 87.95 B: yeah but i mean let's say they s- um 

88.14 95.39 A: um but what hap- what happens if you catch them in the act after they already embezzle and spent the money 

88.33 89.30 B: (( [mn] )) 

96.04 98.18 B: okay well if i was well 

97.43 100.39 A: like kenneth lay from enron 

101.04 103.17 A: (( i mean all that money is gone )) 

103.87 106.68 B: (( oh i didn't follow that scandal that much )) 

108.02 111.72 B: (( i don't even really realize what went on with that he oh he ended up )) 

110.86 113.37 A: well enron what happens they um 

114.60 117.57 A: you know they told all the employees to um 

118.76 133.17 A: you know hold on or sell the stock and then the employees listened and got misled and stock became worthless and they lost all their retirement and you know then the company went bankrupt but right before that 

133.34 138.31 A: action took place all the top executives including this kenneth lay guy 

138.71 140.72 A: took their millions 

140.77 143.51 A: when the stock was high and ran away 

144.17 145.70 B: oh ooh 

144.92 147.69 A: well you know took the money and um ran 

146.70 148.21 B: and all the money is gone 

148.93 155.04 A: yeah i mean being now the company is bankrupt now there is no money for the employees' retirement plans because [mn] 

153.88 156.57 B: but didn't they have insurance or something that would cover 

155.79 157.23 A: bankrupt uh 

158.96 162.09 A: uh that's a good question i forgot what 

162.78 164.92 A: happened um 

165.09 172.42 B: it yeah like when you are in a business like that you should always get some type of insurance to protect yourself in case anything um 

165.19 166.92 A: you know i wonder why insurance 

171.86 176.88 A: well i think it had to do with the value of the stock like you you can't insure 

177.40 179.64 A: a value of stock otherwise 

178.63 193.24 B: well that's the gamble you take when you buy stock like i i own general motors stocks sometimes it goes up sometimes it goes down that's just you know the gamble i'm going to take you know i'm willing to buy more stock in other companies and that's on me if it falls you know i mean you take a chance 

186.04 187.26 A: yeah 

191.44 196.30 A: yeah see that's the thing this was employee stock to build up their 

197.14 208.42 A: i'm sorry [mn] i said retirement plan i meant profit sharing plan and it kept growing over and then the employees got tricked and misled and then their 

201.41 202.43 B: right 

208.83 211.33 B: yeah well nobody forced them to buy it though 

208.95 215.86 A: accumulated savings became worthless right that's why yeah there's no insurance it's just stock uh 

216.23 218.28 A: plan not a pension plan 

218.46 221.01 B: okay so how do you think they should have handled it then 

221.36 223.67 B: like [mn] to keep that from happening 

223.84 225.07 A: um 

226.87 231.95 A: well trying to keep the top executives more held more 

232.32 234.08 A: accountable 

234.32 235.58 A: um 

235.69 238.20 B: they are aren't they going to i guess aren't they 

237.80 240.41 A: well yeah they i thought they came up with some new 

241.12 243.43 A: laws um 

244.50 250.54 A: but or maybe they should require mo- h- here's one maybe they wish they should require more 

250.90 253.23 A: you know quarterly audits 

253.31 254.82 A: by the government 

254.33 256.92 B: do they do background checks before they hire these people 

257.76 259.76 A: um some companies 

260.48 261.91 A: do but 

262.25 264.92 A: even so um you know 

265.20 269.07 A: audits are not necessarily required 

269.58 275.42 A: um well actually see enron got audited by a big four firm because the auditors lied [laughter] 

275.29 276.82 B: oh hm okay 

276.29 277.95 A: you know that was part of the big 

278.21 282.06 A: scandal no they should just have government auditors like go in 

282.08 283.82 A: periodically 

283.43 285.55 B: were any women involved in it 

285.87 287.33 A: um 

287.92 289.03 A: no 

288.66 292.48 B: you see that's the problem now if we have women involved in these 

290.21 293.75 A: well no no i mean no no woman was found guilty 

292.67 294.44 B: because women don't lie 

294.51 296.36 A: [laughter] 

295.68 305.34 B: so there's your problem right there you know we need more women in charge of companies and maybe running the country and stuff like that and then things will be smoother 

306.12 310.50 A: well that's another you know topic for discussion 

309.69 316.85 B: [laughter] there's your solution right there no i mean i i think that um you know like i- 

317.44 319.83 B: if you you know the under cover thing to me that's 

320.43 326.92 B: the easiest way i think if it's cheap you don't have to worry about whether you're doing any you know um 

327.35 334.45 B: security monitoring or anything like that [mn] you know and all that auditing that all costs a lot of money but if you sent just somebody 

333.43 339.36 A: no actually it is cheaper to have the audit than to have a full-time under cover person 

339.93 341.13 B: (( how do you say )) 

342.59 343.59 A: um 

343.51 344.83 B: it can't be 

345.15 346.78 A: well yeah i mean you say 

347.60 350.04 A: someone under cover 

350.05 354.44 B: yeah you don't got to pay them like a million dollars to go into a company and figure out what's going on 

354.51 357.22 A: no but you got to pay them a hundred thousand to 

357.73 360.56 A: work and be there eight hours a day 

360.06 363.15 B: not a hundred thousand and and what if it was part-time 

363.92 373.15 B: or you could have somebody pretend to be an intern learning or something like that and they don't have to be there all the time they just go in every now and then but to constantly monitor something 

372.14 374.24 A: yeah but it achieves nothing 

374.39 380.22 A: it takes you know a few months or maybe a few years for fraud to 

380.37 381.56 A: develop 

382.04 382.95 B: oh it does 

383.43 384.61 A: yeah 

384.94 390.95 A: um well depending on the size of the company like it only takes a minute for someone to steal 

391.23 401.54 A: money out of the petty cash draw or something like that but to uncover millions in a huge company that's been hidden 

393.26 394.07 B: (( mhm mm )) 

401.48 406.95 A: like a paper trail that takes months of investigation or research 

409.68 411.38 B: okay so what do you think 

412.39 413.51 A: um 

416.76 419.11 A: [mn] i don't know i mean um 

419.56 429.46 A: no well i tell you what i think you know just have more required government audits because well you know my experience is that 

429.57 434.72 A: when you have government auditors looking over the financial books of the company 

434.82 439.33 A: i mean they're almost as bad as the i._r._s. knocking on the door of your house 

439.29 440.63 B: right okay 

440.44 441.53 A: um 

440.80 443.20 B: (( yeah but people get over on the i._r._s. all the time )) 

443.73 444.94 A: they get what 

444.63 447.57 B: they get over on them they they lie and cheat the i._r._s. 

448.47 449.52 B: easily 

449.76 450.94 A: well 

450.98 452.08 A: um 

455.59 459.35 A: i i don't know if it's that easy um 

458.72 463.07 B: i know people that have done it they write they'll write off anything and they get away with it 

463.45 467.01 B: people that own businesses i've had people tell me what they do 

466.67 470.29 A: oh yeah no okay let's put it this way yeah it's easy to 

470.44 477.69 A: cheat on your tax return but the minute they start questioning your tax return and audit your return 

477.94 479.30 A: i mean um 

479.74 481.91 A: then you're dead y- 

482.50 487.22 B: if you're consistent then you don't got to worry about that getting caught 

486.59 489.10 A: you know unless you have very good you know uh 

490.91 493.21 A: records but um 

494.84 499.00 A: y- yeah i'm just speaking from my minimal experience that you know 

499.13 502.03 A: government auditors are not pleasant people to 

502.25 503.37 A: deal with 

504.02 506.23 A: and with a company they'll just keep 

506.41 508.48 A: digging and digging and digging 

508.58 511.88 B: okay so if somebody gets caught doing something like that 

512.44 514.43 B: what kind of punishment do you think 

514.20 520.06 A: well i mean now they're imposing i thought george bush was imposing harsher penalties like 

520.10 525.63 A: some accounting managers um i think have been sentenced to five years in prison 

527.66 530.81 B: okay but do you think that that punishment 

530.94 532.80 B: (( is um )) 

532.84 534.93 B: (( got to be equal to somebody that )) 

534.98 542.24 B: you know killed somebody or raped somebody or a chronic thief like robbing banks armed robbery something like that 

542.67 548.23 B: i i just don't feel those those same type of people belong in jail with like hard criminals 

544.01 545.56 A: um yeah that's the thing i 

546.97 552.61 A: yeah i mean i can't equate white collar crime with you know the mass murderers 

552.72 554.12 A: um i mean you're 

555.09 557.36 A: you're right about that but no i mean but 

555.47 559.51 B: no i mean you think five years in i think one year in jail is 

560.02 561.81 B: bad enough i mean you know 

561.17 564.51 A: well not not for a top executive that embezzled 

564.56 571.61 A: two to ten million dollars he would laugh and say go ahead put me in jail and give me a book to read 

572.02 576.57 A: you know what i'm saying i mean if someone gave you ten million dollars you'd sit in jail 

577.54 579.68 B: yeah i guess i'd be i think 

580.71 587.06 B: i think uh when you give somebody community service like make them do work for free that kind of 

587.73 590.11 B: i think that's a better type of a punishment 

589.12 594.21 A: well yeah of course um and also if they give all the money 

594.24 595.61 A: back the ten million um 

596.63 599.39 B: if they have it still [laughter] 

598.80 599.89 A: (( yeah well i guess it ))
