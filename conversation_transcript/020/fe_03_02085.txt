224.33 226.10 B: [laughter] 

225.64 226.93 A: [laughter] 

226.24 227.64 B: a long time ago 

227.49 232.07 A: i just i just paid one ninety seven i think 

232.07 233.11 B: wow 

232.78 240.69 A: yeah and it was down because and this is with the cheap gas [laughter] this is not premium gas this would be the cheapest gas around 

235.27 236.08 B: yeah 

236.75 238.49 B: [laughter] 

239.94 241.51 B: [laughter] man 

240.91 241.84 A: so

242.48 244.75 B: it's never gotten up that high here 

244.57 247.54 A: it's never gotten up that high here either [laughter] 

246.75 249.11 B: (( [laughter] oh )) 

248.26 255.88 A: so i mean it was it was the highest i think i've paid was like two twenty two twenty something like two twenty three or something 

249.92 250.91 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

255.92 256.92 B: wow 

256.26 264.40 A: and that was maybe three weeks ago or so you know when everybody was saying all the gas was way high because of the war and everything so 

259.70 260.46 B: gee 

263.36 264.26 B: yeah 

264.42 267.14 B: well here it was actually going down 

264.67 265.56 A: um 

267.21 269.11 A: oh man [laughter] 

267.39 278.63 B: it was like when the war started the gas was like around like well i think it was like when when you know when they first bombed baghdad the gas went up to a dollar sixty nine 

276.08 277.01 A: yeah 

278.61 289.36 B: it went up like ten cents in like a couple of hours and then uh and then from there on it's been like fully going down [laughter] i cannot figure out [laughter] 

278.65 279.49 A: ooh 

281.82 283.32 A: [laughter] 

286.16 288.76 A: well hey you know it's act- 

288.87 290.10 A: yeah really 

289.50 295.12 B: i couldn't figure out what they were talking about when they were saying gas prices were going up so [laughter] 

293.72 306.14 A: well it kind of spiked like out here too or you know when we first started bombing things it went up and it has been going down 'cause like i said i just paid like one ninety i don't know ninety seven or ninety six something like that 

298.62 299.87 B: yeah 

305.58 306.83 B: yeah 

306.61 309.37 A: so but still you know what it's never going to 

310.43 312.93 A: i wonder what that oh that must be the recording thing 

310.68 311.73 B: oh man yeah 

313.19 314.67 A: that must be um 

315.78 320.75 A: you know it's never going to go back down to what it was before because now they go oh look they're willing to pay it so 

319.68 322.51 B: they're all willing to pay that much yeah so why 

322.28 327.16 A: exactly so we'll just leave it at this price now [laughter] so 

322.58 324.35 B: [laughter] 

325.13 329.58 B: yeah [laughter] and make as much money as we can [laughter] 

328.49 330.26 A: i know really 

330.42 335.71 A: clearly if you you know that would be a pretty good outdoor activity if you owned a gas station [laughter] 

335.35 337.72 B: yeah actually [laughter] 

337.09 339.09 A: how hard is it to sit in a little 

338.92 343.23 B: sit in a little booth and uh take money [laughter] [laughter] 

340.61 341.64 A: (( i know )) 

342.02 347.21 A: well actually now there's okay 'cause you're in the little booth does that actually count as a indoor activity [laughter] 

347.27 357.00 B: i don't know a lot of 'em a lot of 'em are pretty much still off now you know they got a lot of quiets around there and i been to some you know where they have the the draw 

351.48 352.85 A: yeah that's true 

353.76 354.77 A: really 

357.17 363.46 B: with the handle on it they push the drawer out you put the money in and they bring it back in and [laughter] 

357.24 359.50 A: oh yeah where you uh-huh 

360.34 361.65 A: yeah 

362.17 365.37 A: that's it that's like no contact at all ever 

364.52 367.12 B: yeah [laughter] 

365.92 369.10 A: like the bank some of those banks are like that now 

368.84 371.35 B: yeah well we got a 

369.92 371.69 A: (( but uh i don't know )) 

371.49 374.04 B: we got one gas station out here where uh 

374.11 377.99 B: they don't they don't even have people attending it you know 

377.40 381.49 A: not at all nobody not even like in case you have a problem 

378.75 379.74 B: no 

380.13 380.73 B: (( no )) 

382.07 391.72 B: not that i've seen they got a bunch of cameras around you know it's kinda like ha- has a dollar changer machine takes up to twenties in it and 

382.26 383.25 A: wow 

385.31 387.01 A: (( oh man and )) 

391.09 392.22 A: that's it 

391.73 394.62 B: yeah [laughter] 

393.02 397.50 A: [laughter] totally automated that would worry me though 

395.49 404.29 B: yeah and and they still charge just as much for gas even though they're not even paying somebody to be a cashier there [laughter] you know 

399.36 400.35 A: oh 

404.29 407.17 A: yeah to watch out if you have a problem or something 

406.18 407.55 B: yeah 

407.33 414.87 A: you would think that you know i would worry so it's like if you go there and the change machine doesn't work you have to get that much gas period [laughter] 

414.06 416.42 B: yeah i i 

415.29 417.75 A: (( all i have is a ten oh my god )) 

417.40 421.16 B: think they got like a ph- a phone number you can call and you know 

420.29 426.13 A: [laughter] like anybody's gonna stay there and wait for someone to like get up and get dressed and come on down [laughter] 

421.21 422.63 B: [laughter] 

424.67 425.72 B: i know 

425.81 427.56 B: [laughter] 

426.91 435.24 A: yeah i don't think so [laughter] well at least with some people at our gas station not that they come outta their little booths but 

428.75 430.03 B: [laughter] 

432.79 433.65 B: yeah 

434.62 435.94 B: yeah

439.33 444.66 B: [laughter] yeah well actually i think the one i that didn't have the people at it went outta business 

445.38 446.86 A: oh well there you go 

446.83 450.81 B: like maybe a month ago so i mean it's 'cause there's no people there 

450.90 455.51 A: yeah i mean well if it was cheaper and there was no people i would probably go there 

451.02 452.28 B: [laughter] 

455.33 457.59 B: yeah well that's the thing 

456.12 458.87 A: but if it's the same price [laughter] 

458.40 464.63 B: yeah that's the thing that was the thing towards the that's what i noticed about the last month they were there 

464.66 465.71 A: yeah 

464.99 469.00 B: it was the same price as the gas station across the street so 

469.32 471.53 A: yeah well if you're you know might go 

469.60 472.76 B: (( you know [laughter] i'd rather go there [laughter] ))
