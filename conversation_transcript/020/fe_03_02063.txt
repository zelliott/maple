342.08 344.58 A: course we got in the car and drove home so 

344.25 348.17 B: yeah i imagine it's a little bit later where [laughter] in michigan than it is here 

347.77 350.54 A: uh yeah it's eight o'clock 

349.19 353.61 B: it's only five o'clock it's five o'clock here so [laughter] we haven't even 

351.57 355.32 A: oh really that's right you're way over there 

354.54 356.68 B: we haven't even fixed dinner yet 

356.31 357.48 A: oh oh 

357.15 361.37 B: i was just thinking oh i should probably be doing that but [laughter] 

361.66 367.34 B: yeah i kind of forget about you know when you're talking to somebody on the phone it's like they're in the same area 

367.32 368.97 A: yeah you don't con- 

368.98 371.30 A: don't really consider that the difference 

370.92 372.34 B: it's really 

372.77 375.09 B: it's it's almost hard to even imagine 

375.29 376.30 A: uh-huh 

376.00 376.98 B: you're 

377.42 379.52 B: three hours difference in time [laughter] 

379.64 381.42 A: uh-huh 

380.31 384.10 B: so like it's still daylight here it's probably starting to get dark over there 

384.34 385.85 A: well it's not 

385.91 390.64 A: it's still it's still quite light but it's it you can tell that it's gonna be 

392.12 392.99 A: it 

393.11 398.74 A: usually gets dark around eight thirty around here or after eight to eight thirty it starts getting dark 

395.47 397.17 B: mhm 

399.29 403.87 A: [mn] and then everything gets quiet and we sit outside very much unless they 

404.18 406.94 A: just coming home or something from somewhere 

408.41 411.16 B: well i sure hope we start getting some sunny weather 

411.19 413.07 A: oh you haven't had much huh 

412.29 413.74 B: no it's just 

413.82 416.47 B: we had like a inch of rain the day before yesterday 

416.29 423.82 A: oh no we well we haven't any actual rain like i said it's been snow and and we had that awful ice storm but 

424.35 433.97 A: we had a couple of really really warm days and then they went [laughter] and then the very next morning we woke up and we couldn't believe the weather 'cause it was so cold 

433.98 435.49 A: so we stayed in 

435.67 439.19 B: yeah we're ten or twenty degrees lower than normal right now 

438.88 439.83 A: (( uh-huh )) 

439.62 442.80 B: the other day it was in the thirties and it's supposed to be in the sixties [laughter] 

443.07 444.10 A: (( oh )) 

443.82 446.92 B: yeah so like around for this day you know we don't usually 

446.93 448.90 B: we don't have extreme weather 

449.19 450.16 A: (( uh-huh )) 

449.50 455.00 B: you know we don't get the real cold and the snow like you guys do it but we don't get the real sunny stuff either 

455.51 461.47 A: well you're a little well a little bit nor- little bit far- further north than we are but i think the 

461.51 464.18 A: differences that you're west 

464.44 468.73 A: i don't know why it makes a difference but it seems like the further east 

468.77 471.64 A: you go the cooler it is 

471.30 473.22 B: yeah you know i i think 

472.36 473.52 A: even when you're 

473.88 478.37 B: as far as washington goes i think it's because we're so close to the pacific ocean 

478.03 479.69 A: well that could be too 

478.95 483.32 B: and whether it it comes up and it kind of goes north and then shoots down 

483.39 487.85 B: and goes south when it hits in into the rest of the coun- uh united states 

486.40 488.12 A: mhm 

489.38 496.99 A: well we [sigh] have water all the way around us but we're closer to mich- lake michigan we're like 

497.30 504.91 A: fifty sixty miles from lake michigan and sometimes that makes a difference and sometimes it doesn't it just depends 

499.54 500.46 B: wow 

505.88 509.63 B: yeah water can just it can make you know that really affects weather 

511.41 513.90 B: yeah hard to talk about weather for ten minutes 

513.71 520.54 A: huh [laughter] yeah that wasn't the subject but it was more interesting i think [laughter] 

514.41 516.08 B: (( [laughter] )) 

517.58 518.49 B: (( yeah )) 

521.30 522.40 B: yeah
