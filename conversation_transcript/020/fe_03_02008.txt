0.00 1.58 A: my name is marie 

1.12 3.31 B: my name is chrissy how are you 

3.01 8.63 A: i'm fine i live here in kansas city missouri where are you c- uh calling from 

8.04 9.83 B: i'm from new york city 

9.37 12.80 A: new york city i have a daughter in syracuse 

10.51 11.42 B: yes 

12.64 13.59 B: (( oh )) 

13.27 16.01 A: new york yeah actually 

14.96 17.42 B: (( close but not that close to here [laughter] )) 

17.48 20.10 B: i said close but not that close to here yeah 

19.28 24.90 A: huh uh she's actually in fayetteville uh just outside of syracuse 

24.64 28.85 B: oh right i know i i actually had a friend that lived up there so i'm familiar with that area 

28.27 31.38 A: (( oh are you oh my god )) 

29.17 30.16 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

30.29 33.02 B: they live in camillus which is right around there too 

33.10 34.33 A: who is 

34.09 36.94 B: it it's a town called camillus right up there it 

36.31 48.77 A: i know yeah yeah yeah i uh was up there for a couple of months you know and stayed and so i got i'm pretty well familiar with the little uh villages around up there it's really pretty up there 

48.13 49.76 B: is very nice up there 

49.35 54.61 A: well this subject i'm not sure she wants to know wha- [sigh] if uh 

53.52 58.64 B: basically they want to know um i think it's more or less a business ethics kind of question 

58.48 62.13 A: right is it it's scandal and 

61.23 65.64 B: you know i think that they're trying to get us the whole enron thing and how that affected people 

65.93 80.48 B: i personally don't invest in the stock market because i've always felt like it was sort of a form of legal gambling so for me it really didn't affect me very much because i've always been smarter than that uh you know i've always believed like in government type of bonds and things like that which are a little bit more secure 

70.96 71.88 A: yeah 

73.70 74.57 A: yeah 

74.90 75.93 A: yeah 

80.04 81.65 A: secure yes 

81.45 84.58 B: but my pension plan though is because i don't have an 

81.66 82.78 A: that 

84.61 91.06 B: option because i'm a teacher here i don't have an option it is actually corporate bonds like corporate kind of stock thing 

86.07 86.91 A: (( ahah )) 

90.52 91.43 A: yeah 

91.62 100.22 A: well i had um mine was when i worked for a restaurant company for thirty three years and of course i had everything in 401k 

100.02 100.93 B: mhm 

100.42 105.59 A: and then when i um rolled the 401k 

105.61 116.43 A: out why i did go to an investment person and i've got my grandson tonight and he's pounding the piano here [noise] um [noise] 

116.47 122.62 A: (( i put it into an an investment so i haven't really lost anything [noise] )) 

122.58 124.47 B: so i guess it didn't really affect you 

124.33 138.63 B: but what do you think for curbing i mean i don't know there there's almost no way of curbing it because it's really in terms of corporations it's an individual by individual thing i mean you could have rules set up in your company that you don't do certain things 

134.59 135.57 A: yeah 

138.61 141.72 B: but if you have someone who doesn't follow those rules 

140.44 142.44 A: (( [noise] )) 

141.77 144.70 B: it doesn't quite matter what the company you know what i mean like 

144.95 156.28 B: like for example like a friend of mine works for a barrister and they have a rule right now that you actually cannot travel to hong kong but people have clients over there they're not going to follow that rule because they're going to lose a lot of money you 

150.83 151.81 A: yeah 

155.68 156.59 A: yes 

156.75 160.60 B: know so it it's a little bit of a difficult thing i mean 

157.06 157.93 A: (( yeah )) 

160.89 167.09 A: i just think that because i coming from a corporation company and i've seen this happen 

160.97 161.67 B: (( you know )) 

167.10 171.19 A: where the corporate head corporate people 

171.28 180.41 A: uh spend a lot of money on going on trips and things for themselves and they don't pay 

180.40 191.47 A: the employees the little people enough and the they actually some of them can actually drain the company and i kind of think that that's what enron did they 

190.59 196.38 B: well yeah i mean that's it's pretty clear it was the big guys and they just messed up the little guys 

195.78 197.58 A: yeah yeah 

196.71 207.62 B: you know not only in terms of like what you're saying like just draining the company you know taking away from their salaries but i mean in the end they took away their pensions i mean people who invested their entire 

205.08 206.14 A: sure 

207.91 210.04 B: life savings it was just gone 

209.04 209.98 A: sure 

210.09 213.74 A: sure and some of them had worked for quite some time and they 

213.79 222.09 A: were thinking that they were going to just finish their years out there until they retired and 

220.92 226.55 B: well that's the thing i always think like the government somehow could should be involved in this whole thing because 

226.56 235.74 B: it's sort of like an f._d._i._c. sort of thing where if you do invest in a certain company and you do work for them i feel like there should be some kind of 

235.86 238.96 B: i don't know if there's going like uh some kind of an insurance 

239.72 242.99 B: i mean it's hard to do because every company is different but it 

242.29 244.38 A: yeah but the 

243.22 245.23 B: just seems really unfair 

244.77 249.92 A: yeah it is but the government just can't be involved in everything 

249.80 251.21 B: exactly 

249.92 257.30 A: and i just think that you know um some of these companies like i say the 

257.23 267.09 A: uh president vice-president c- c._o._e.s or c._e._o.s and you know they are driving the big fancy cars and uh 

266.97 272.58 A: going on the trips and shipping their golf clubs and and then you've got 

272.67 276.29 A: they're downsizing and letting people go 

276.57 287.55 A: and these people you know that are losing their jobs and they are expecting the other people to pick up the slack and to do the extra work and they don't want to pay them any more for it 

287.86 294.94 B: yeah i mean i just don't know how it but see i don't un- i i mean it's a tough topic because how do you make a corporation more accountable 

294.58 295.63 A: yeah 

295.03 303.95 B: you can only make individuals more accountable and that would be variable depend- you know on each company they would have a different set of rules 

297.23 298.58 A: that's true 

301.35 302.30 A: yeah 

303.58 304.99 A: yeah 

305.22 313.48 A: but you know i i think if employees stand up and say anything they'd probably just lose their jobs 

313.42 325.48 B: well yeah that's the thing i mean because even if you know that someone is milking the company dry or they don't have the correct corporate kind of ethics you're not going to say anything if you work under them because you know what the consequence is 

324.99 326.81 A: sure sure 

326.11 329.22 B: you know because they're not going to pick you over them 

329.00 330.73 A: that's right 

330.16 334.56 B: you know like a little person over a big guy is just not going to happen 

334.18 335.03 A: no 

335.22 341.06 A: no they would let you go because they figured they can just get somebody else in off the street to replace you 

341.35 343.75 B: exactly i mean that's the whole thing 

343.21 346.57 A: oh i know yeah but the gov- 

345.47 354.76 B: yeah but a lot of big guys though were really losing their jobs too because they really are downsizing and i guess they realize like they have to trim the fat up at the top too 

350.54 351.65 A: (( aha [noise] )) 

354.22 361.52 A: yeah but you know [mn] in some instances i think the government is just as bad 

360.81 364.16 B: well yeah i mean you know they spent a lot of money on 

363.91 365.10 A: (( yeah )) 

364.56 366.26 B: (( and things of that nature )) 

366.20 367.34 A: oh yeah 

366.27 373.63 B: you know and i don't think that they set a very good example and i think that that's also part of it like as a country we don't have the greatest of role models 

373.51 386.38 B: you know i mean in other countries like the government is a little bit better at how they spend their money i mean they spend it on health care or they spend it on things that are just that make more sense than what we do here 

379.30 380.72 A: mhm 

381.72 382.67 A: (( yeah )) 

385.81 388.14 A: yeah i uh 

387.00 391.64 B: i love america don't get me wrong but i'm just saying that there are other countries that work better 

389.26 390.27 A: yeah 

390.31 397.18 A: i understand uh i went to uh rome in january and while i was over there 

397.05 407.78 A: their taxes and their pay cheques i guess are just i mean they it's huge taxes that they take out but they have they have free health care 

403.03 405.67 B: (( yeah it's like fifty per cent that's right yeah )) 

408.32 411.00 A: and they take care of their senior 

411.45 413.18 A: people you know 

413.30 421.87 B: yeah well that's you know what i think that we don't really do that here and i think that if you have a government like who's the big people who are supposedly you know the ones that 

413.44 414.30 A: and 

421.68 432.89 B: because i mean where are corporations going to look to they're going to look to just like you know if you're a lower level employee you're going look up to the boss to learn how the company works i feel like a lot of companies look at the government 

432.69 437.86 B: and you know they want to know how they work and they don't they're not effective you 

437.15 438.15 A: yeah 

437.99 440.39 B: know so it makes companies not effective 

440.40 443.88 A: yeah i would rather work for 

444.44 446.90 A: uh a small company 

447.34 451.83 A: you know just uh a family owned company than i would a corporation 

452.02 459.23 B: yeah d- i would too i actually though i work for the board of ed in new york city which is one of the biggest money wasters in my opinion 

459.84 465.99 B: you know they waste a lot of money on office space but for people who don't do anything but tell you that they didn't help you 

460.10 460.68 A: (( [noise] )) 

464.41 465.30 A: yeah 

465.77 468.67 A: yeah now did you say you were a school teacher 

468.31 469.31 B: i am 

469.08 470.02 A: yeah 

470.03 471.05 A: yeah 

470.70 474.25 B: you know so there's all this crazy red tape to get through 

474.67 482.96 B: you know like in order to change my health insurance i you know you get to change it in october it took them from october to january to process the paperwork 

479.22 480.17 A: (( aha )) 

482.21 482.80 A: (( [noise] )) 

483.82 485.69 B: because they're just not efficient 

485.76 492.48 B: and i feel like a lot of companies aren't efficient and that's part of the like i feel like enron to some degree wasn't efficient 

492.10 492.98 A: no 

493.30 501.96 A: no well it wasn't efficient it wasn't true to its employees and they were just uh interested in lining their own pockets 

501.86 513.02 B: yeah i mean it's pretty clear but it's similar like my stepfather works for a funeral home company a very large one and they did a very similar thing they were actually um 

503.07 504.33 A: that was it 

508.77 509.60 A: (( aha )) 

513.48 523.15 B: there was a federal case pending against them basically charging them with being a monopoly and all the big guys sold all their stock 

519.91 520.76 A: (( aha )) 

523.23 538.14 B: bef- right before the verdict came in but they didn't tell the employees to do it so people like my stepfather who had all of for some reason he invested all of his money in that ended up with nothing i mean the shares went from like forty dollars a share to like sixty cents 

523.52 524.70 A: mhm 

525.67 526.86 A: oh yeah 

534.19 534.98 A: (( nothing )) 

537.95 538.81 A: yeah 

539.09 540.00 A: yeah 

539.19 541.16 B: (( it was considerable )) 

541.39 542.28 A: yeah 

541.67 552.45 B: you know if you have all your but i think that's also part of like what i'm saying with enron that people should have i almost feel like they should have known even before then that you have to have your money in different places 

553.10 555.98 B: putting all year eggs in one basket you're just going to 

555.21 556.19 A: yeah 

556.07 558.35 B: have a basket full of broken eggs 

556.33 557.21 A: yeah 

558.52 565.31 A: well that's just like with the restaurant company that i it it was houlihan's restaurant group and i don't know if you've heard of houlihan's 

564.43 566.10 B: yeah no they're big 

565.72 568.72 A: yeah and um 

569.28 579.10 A: they got to the point though where they were holding the vendor's cheques they would go ahead and cut the cheques to send out but they would hold them for 

579.40 584.59 A: another thirty to sixty days before they would mail them out because 

584.47 596.81 A: they were in financial trouble they were trying to open too many restaurants too fast and then the corporate people were just way spending way too much money 

597.15 598.94 A: and um 

599.11 599.95 A: they final-
