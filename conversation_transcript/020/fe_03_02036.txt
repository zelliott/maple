54.44 57.58 B: i just find myself inside watching movies 

56.98 59.29 A: yeah do you live some place warm

69.49 71.64 A: you know like to go out more 

71.97 83.49 B: yeah i mean i used to live in texas in austin and i one of the reasons why i moved there was actually because i really like warm weather i like i don't i don't like physically being cold some people 

74.78 75.77 A: okay 

79.86 81.01 A: mhm 

83.03 84.26 A: right

87.92 93.22 B: yeah i just don't feel like i'm about to lose an extremity when it's hot or something the way that i do when i'm cold 

91.87 93.37 A: yeah 

93.19 94.79 B: and um so i 

94.73 109.47 B: when i lived in warmer weather though like on a more consistent basis i mean it makes it easier to get out and do things but i still didn't find myself [mn] you know ah hiking or [laughter] [laughter] or playing volleyball or anything like that so 

98.21 99.47 A: mhm 

101.03 102.26 A: right 

105.66 116.94 A: right [laughter] [mn] outdoor stuff yeah i think because i'm from new york and it's like and i also went to school in chicago so it's like two cold places 

115.15 116.43 B: oh god 

117.07 122.85 A: like i don't like [laughter] unless it's warm i don't like being outdoors at all 

121.77 125.66 B: so yeah like so what was it like living in chicago 

125.74 130.50 A: chicago you know chicago isn't really cold it's like windy 

130.47 133.70 B: yeah [laughter] worse [laughter] 

131.38 140.68 A: it's like [laughter] it's like the w- temperature will be like you know forty fifty degrees but then like with the wind chill [laughter] it's like below zero 

140.42 143.25 B: so what kind of like coping mechanisms did you have 

143.38 144.36 A: (( like )) 

145.12 152.42 A: i d- i i was indoors a lot like if i didn't have to be out then i wasn't and we were like [mn] where i was at was right on the water 

151.99 153.04 B: (( oh god )) 

152.48 158.96 A: so it's like [laughter] of course it was like [laughter] like ten degrees colder than anywhere else in chicago but 

158.06 159.56 B: that's rough 

159.47 166.02 A: yeah but i mean being at school there of course you know you have to go to your class you have to be out at some point but 

166.29 167.79 A: (( if i didn't have to )) 

168.10 171.59 A: no way and i learned to dress in layers too [laughter] 

168.87 169.98 B: [laughter] 

170.76 180.62 B: yeah i don't know ah do and do people always [sigh] like does it affect people's eating habits like it being so cold 

181.17 182.33 B: in terms of 

181.48 194.51 A: i think i think so to a certain degree because like you don't want to go like there's a lot of like i was lucky because where i lived like there was i could get walk downstairs and get food and not have to go out but for people who didn't [laughter] i don't know 

190.70 191.91 B: mhm 

194.60 198.61 B: so like did you already know that you didn't like cold weather before you moved there though 

199.22 200.97 A: no you know 

201.56 215.87 A: um i didn't expect it to be so cold like [laughter] like i know it's like the windy city and stuff but i was like i didn't really expect it to be that bad i think too like the years that i was out there were just bad years were like 

204.55 206.28 B: [laughter] 

214.55 215.74 B: (( oh dear )) 

216.19 222.39 A: were it was really cold winters there were a few like really bad snowstorms and stuff like that so 

222.96 226.54 A: nothing could have been planned but [laughter] 

224.38 225.84 B: yeah [laughter] 

226.62 229.82 A: but it definitely makes me appreciate warm weather 

229.52 231.52 B: yeah well if so 

232.19 238.18 B: if you were going to well if you were going to live somewhere other than new york then would you want to choose some place that that was warmer

408.30 409.28 B: yeah 

411.64 412.71 B: really 

412.07 416.60 A: ridicul- like it's a dollar fifty now and it's going up to two buck- two bucks [laughter]

427.74 428.60 B: (( ahem )) 

428.16 440.81 A: you know you can go anywhere so that's good but it's like it used to be like i remember growing up it used to be like a dollar and they would go up every so often but it would be like five cents 

429.73 430.54 B: right 

440.54 441.74 B: (( gee )) 

441.05 448.20 A: (( you know now it's like [mn] it's like i think it's the biggest increase it's like a whole one fifty to two bucks )) 

446.06 447.27 B: yeah that's um 

447.69 455.18 B: well see like okay now so we um we have one of the most expensive public transportation systems [mn] it it's already two dollars here 

452.56 453.91 A: really 

454.87 456.46 A: wow 

455.69 459.52 B: and [mn] you get jack shit for it [laughter] like the thing is like you you 

457.37 458.61 A: oh 

458.85 461.30 A: and you have to pay if you're going like somewhere else 

460.77 464.82 B: yeah well a transfer's sixty cents and you can only use it once 

463.25 464.03 A: (( what )) 

464.52 467.14 A: (( oh my god )) 

465.32 466.29 B: and 

466.40 477.07 B: and it's awful and [mn] and it's like we we don't have a real subway system it's there are two routes one goes ah north west north south and the other one east west 

475.42 476.17 A: (( ahah )) 

476.96 481.73 B: and and then the buses ah it's like it's privatized here and 

477.01 478.69 A: oh my god 

481.81 486.77 B: [mn] it's just the biggest complaint i think most people have with the city is it's public transportation it's 

486.55 488.31 A: wow 

487.01 488.38 B: awful 

488.41 492.17 B: and it's crazy because i just moved um from washington d._c. 

491.99 493.00 A: (( ahah )) 

492.43 494.06 B: and um 

493.17 495.15 A: that's a there's a nice little 

494.49 500.36 B: yeah it's nice and it's like it's not as ex- i don't think it's as ex- it's as expensive as new york 

495.37 496.29 A: (( it's ah )) 

499.67 501.07 A: yeah 

500.43 501.62 B: but 

501.89 508.44 B: man i it's just weird going from a place where i can depend more on the public transportation and being here and it's just like forget it 

506.32 507.95 A: right 

508.07 509.49 A: (( right [mn] )) 

509.01 512.18 B: but this is a relatively small city like the way it's 

512.45 513.64 B: laid out 

513.24 514.43 A: mhm 

513.83 515.05 B: so um 

515.22 520.95 B: [mn] especially now that it is nice walking and riding my bike it's it's like no big deal 

519.57 520.39 A: (( ye- )) 

520.86 522.09 A: yeah 

521.57 522.59 B: (( i don't know though )) 

523.09 533.23 A: new york's system it's pr- it's pretty good in terms of like if you need to go [noise] somewhere that's kind of far you pay a two hour and that's it you can get anywhere but 

533.38 538.35 A: and even like transfers like if you transfer to a bus you you know you don't have to pay anything 

537.97 542.84 B: [cough] so you like you grew up on like the subway system and everything i guess right that's crazy 

540.83 551.60 A: yeah it's huge though like i have friends who come here they're like okay how do i get here [laughter] it's too complicated [laughter] but yeah 

546.56 548.26 B: [laughter] right 

551.41 557.43 A: i just think two dollars is so crazy because like where's it going to go next like two fifty three bucks [laughter] 

556.69 559.19 B: are they yeah are they still going to have like 

559.05 560.29 A: increases 

559.79 565.44 B: yeah but do you get like a any kind of discount if you buy like a just a metro pass or something metro card 

564.30 567.04 A: they used to well the way it is now if you get 

567.48 573.20 A: ah i think if you if you pay for like a fifteen dollar pass you get like a bonus 

573.25 574.82 A: one fifty 

575.19 583.49 A: [laughter] so [laughter] but [laughter] but if you also if you get the card you get free transfers to the bus but 

576.03 578.04 B: [laughter] great [laughter] 

583.52 587.46 A: i think they're doing away with some of it once it goes to two dollars 

587.31 588.53 B: (( really that )) 

587.57 589.95 A: i think they're doing away with some of the bonuses 

589.71 592.91 B: sucks so like why are they saying that they have to raise the prices 

593.01 594.22 A: (( where are they what )) 

593.76 596.30 B: why are they saying that they have to raise the prices 

595.70 599.89 A: because the city claims they have no money [laughter] 

598.07 599.26 B: yeah
