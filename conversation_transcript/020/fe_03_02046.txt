503.47 505.51 A: for athletes who ah 

505.79 506.99 A: well when you have 

507.19 515.87 A: but as the years have gone by the smog has been less and less of a problem in southern california they've gotten more control of it when i first moved here in the ah 

513.11 513.96 B: right 

516.92 526.42 A: late fifties ah my [mn] i lived in pasadena and the mountains aren't that far from pasadena and we couldn't see the mountains the smog was so heavy 

526.60 534.39 A: but i pitied these athletes [mn] who after s- you know high school and college are out in the fields in the afternoon trying to work out run track 

534.40 539.88 A: exert themselves when ah they could get so choked up with the smog
