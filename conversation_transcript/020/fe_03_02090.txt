263.66 264.69 B: uh-huh 

265.56 271.33 B: (( well you know i i think that's a man thing i guess i don't i don't know i don't know ))

269.28 270.42 A: it is 

270.61 272.95 A: it's got to be [laughter] but 

271.81 274.20 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

273.25 281.89 A: but yeah donna and i do all kind i mean we get together every single time they're together you know we go do our thing just to get away from them do whatever they want to and 

281.60 289.97 B: well with her being your neighbor do you ever feel like uh-oh here she comes now and you're in the middle of something or can you can tell her you know jeeze i'm really busy right now 

289.92 297.26 A: um i usually can tell her pretty well um i mean we we've gotten along in the beginning i think there was some 

297.26 307.37 A: some times that i felt it was like you know i don't know when i first met her you know am i gonna to know am i gonna to be able to be that close to her and go you know i need my o my space time 

307.15 308.16 B: mhm 

308.13 314.91 A: but we've we've grown together for five years you know and grown our friendship has grown so much that it's been 

314.79 323.79 A: we pretty much go okay i am too busy i can't do it tonight or today or whatever you know i'm going to have to have my alone time or whatever and we do real good at at doing that 

323.30 326.37 B: well now that's good that's good 

324.38 333.65 A: so um but yeah i do remember right in the beginning you know there was times 'cause it took us i mean when we first moved in we both moved into a neighborhood that had brand new houses 

333.65 343.89 A: and so that first year was like we kept on you know we kept talking across the yards but we never really got together because both of us were so busy doing things and um 

342.38 346.10 B: yeah there's a lot to do even with a new house yes 

343.97 353.88 A: yeah exactly and then we just finally started walking is what we ended up doing and everything just kind of grew from there and now we're inseparable most of the time [laughter] 

353.49 358.90 B: oh that's nice if you guys ever move it's going to be a tearful reunion there 

354.59 355.48 A: so 

357.94 369.31 A: i know we decided that if we ever move we're going to buy a piece of land and we can have big enough to have two houses on it [laughter] we've even joked around about putting a gate in between our yards 

363.76 366.88 B: [laughter] i think you 

369.55 382.85 A: um but it it's pretty funny 'cause they have a pool and we don't and um they pretty much have have told us any time we want to go in the pool whether they're home or not just go on over there and so we've joked around about putting a gate in there and you know 

381.93 382.87 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

382.75 386.22 A: [laughter] so um it's pretty funny but 

385.20 390.96 B: just like adjoining rooms at the hotel you also have an adjoining gate there [laughter] 

386.55 388.16 A: exactly 

388.95 390.28 A: exactly 

390.56 394.26 A: yeah so so y'all live about a block away 

391.52 392.67 B: (( oh well )) 

393.89 408.42 B: yeah just a block and i'll walk over there or she'll walk over here but what's nice is i retired and she's working so really we just get together some once in a while in the evening and pretty much on the weekend so i have a lot of free time [laughter] 

405.52 406.44 A: right 

407.91 410.71 A: yeah you've got your alone time there 

410.75 413.25 B: yeah so so that makes it nice 

410.93 412.21 A: yeah 

413.59 426.81 A: that's one thing about having a family she does not have she does not have kids so all she's got is the husband to contend with but i've got two teenagers and a and a husband to contend with so there are some times where i'm just too tired 

421.28 422.20 B: oh 

426.59 433.75 A: and i'm then i'm like okay donna not tonight i'm just too exhausted i've got to just sit you know and she'll do the same thing 'cause she works they have their own business 

433.78 440.45 A: so normal hours is not you know working with them they they work round the clock basically on their own business so 

440.79 448.08 A: it it's pretty interesting but we're real good about being able to just tell each other okay too busy don't have time for you right now [laughter] 

447.48 449.77 B: yeah just want to chill out tonight 

449.22 456.62 A: exactly and then there are times where we go okay i need you because i need to get away [laughter] so you know that works real well also 

449.91 451.92 B: yeah i've said that 

454.30 455.93 B: yeah [laughter] 

457.28 466.67 B: yeah i get me out of here [laughter] yeah yeah i've called my friend too and said you know what i've been in this house for three days you need to get me out of here so yeah 

458.24 460.48 A: [laughter] exactly 

465.15 467.89 A: yeah i don't care where just anywhere [laughter] 

467.84 469.00 B: (( so that's nice )) 

469.00 470.20 A: exactly 

469.21 473.16 B: but you know when i worked though i can't say that i had 

473.19 476.88 B: close friends i i think i didn't have time 

476.51 477.59 A: (( mhm )) 

476.86 489.45 B: because i had children and my husband and the house and i worked long hours and i had acquaintances but i i didn't really take the time to make a friend at least you did so that's nice 

487.84 501.14 A: yeah and i really think that if it wasn't for her living so close we wouldn't have i would be the same way 'cause before i had several people that i called friends but we didn't get together and do things outside of work when we saw each other and things like that um 

501.22 507.50 A: but living so close together you know they have get togethers all the time and because they're single and they don't have kids they'll 

507.36 516.66 A: they'll have a get together at you know um fourth of july and things like that and they invite all their friends that have kids so it worked out that we could bring our kids and um that's kind of how 

516.55 529.41 A: after we started walking and actually started going to their parties is how we actually everything worked out and i was like you know it'd be pretty easy to actually have a friend in this because she's right there she's right next door so it's not 

528.33 529.46 B: yeah 

529.52 532.46 A: you know it's not like it takes a lot of time to 

532.56 536.63 A: to build a friendship when they're that close huh 

534.04 535.80 B: are you about the same age 

536.22 537.91 B: are you about the same age 

537.98 541.68 A: actually she's my husband's age we're about six years different six years apart 

540.72 543.35 B: (( well that's still that's not bad )) 

541.78 547.56 A: yeah we're close yeah but she's my husband's age so it works out real well i mean we all get along 

547.99 550.42 A: real well all four of us so 

550.65 552.01 B: oh that's great 

551.22 553.20 A: which makes it even easier you know 

553.25 556.97 A: that we can all do things together not just the two of us 

553.43 555.14 B: yeah 

556.85 564.34 B: yeah 'cause if one of the husbands didn't like someone then that would make it difficult but yeah yeah that's great 

560.12 561.31 A: exactly 

561.75 563.01 A: exactly 

564.36 567.32 B: um are you on the east coast
