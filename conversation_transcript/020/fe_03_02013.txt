1.43 3.62 A: hello my name's lou how 

3.19 5.28 B: hi lou i'm michael 

5.23 6.49 A: are you michael 

6.07 9.00 B: fine thank you fort lauderdale florida here 

8.85 13.21 A: fort lauderdale i'm in pittsburgh wish i were in lauderdale 

14.10 16.74 A: i've been down there ah frequently for diving 

17.55 18.75 A: in the area 

19.38 24.56 A: we're not supposed to talk diving we're supposed to talk about corporate scandals is that it 

24.37 29.08 B: that's what it sounded like it was a little fast for me to comprehend 

28.31 33.07 A: yeah they [laughter] they went rather quickly on me too all right i think 

33.21 38.52 A: what i caught was what can the government do about illegal business activities 

39.12 41.15 A: that sound like 

41.27 42.61 B: that works 

42.26 44.48 A: (( that works all right )) 

44.71 47.69 A: um wanna go first 

47.18 50.98 B: not really there's not much they can do [laughter] 

51.07 61.74 A: i guess there's not much first you gotta catch them and if you catch them then you've got to ah prosecute them if you're able to prosecute them 

62.12 66.46 A: you know that takes care of that guy but i don't know what it's going to do for the next one 

67.28 72.54 B: well you take something like enron nobody's in jail for it yet it's been what a year and a half 

72.10 73.20 A: (( yep )) 

72.65 75.31 B: no settlements no prosecutions 

76.70 81.96 A: ah i guess when you get something on that level or of that magnitude um 

82.02 85.96 A: you know i mean you catch somebody shoplifting in a five and dime 

86.33 91.72 A: you can move on them rather quickly 'cause it's ah comprehensible dimensions 

91.86 95.76 A: but when someone does billions and they ah 

97.12 101.68 A: rob everybody on paper from top to bottom i guess it's not real easy to go after them 

105.69 108.23 A: my ah my assessment 

108.55 112.00 B: [laughter] seems reasonable 

112.81 113.83 B: um 

115.91 125.44 B: yeah i see enron and then i see what's happening with american airlines where the execs are taking perks while the ah employees are taking 

126.12 127.46 B: pay cuts 

127.17 128.71 A: taking the pay cuts 

130.00 134.54 A: it was [mn] years ago i once read something about the japanese 

134.83 145.39 A: how they kept things like that under control and they did everything in matters of proportions like if you were if you had the lowest job 

145.49 150.59 A: you were like one okay and then like the guy above you got like 

150.70 158.30 A: to get twice what you got paid and went up and it was like it maxed out so that the head of the company the c._e._o. 

158.37 162.24 A: could only make fifty times as much as the 

162.27 163.74 A: lowest paid person 

165.00 172.06 A: and so that it was like all laid out down the line you know you couldn't have like you had at american airlines some 

172.46 177.59 A: executive who they hired and ran the place into bankruptcy making millions while 

178.07 180.86 A: you know the guys lower down don't make anything 

181.30 187.12 A: so everybody knew if you were going to be the c._e._o. of the company the most you could make is fifty times as much as the janitor 

187.85 190.97 A: it seemed to me to be an eminently fair way of going about it 

191.42 194.41 B: well i'd certainly like to see that ah 

195.27 200.39 B: practiced here but unfortunately it's never gonna happen with all the ah 

201.70 205.50 B: billions of dollars made that eventually evaporated 

206.66 209.73 B: in the markets and all the golden parachutes 

210.79 213.45 A: that's my question where did all that money go 

215.29 216.15 A: i mean 

215.35 217.56 B: that's a i don't know 

217.60 219.92 A: like like where did it all go i mean 

219.32 221.49 B: i think of it as evaporating 

221.74 234.28 A: and and and that's i mean that's basically the the what it seems to of happened you know like i've got you know a portfolio and three years ago when they would send me things every month it says you're worth this much 

234.60 237.67 A: and now you know i'm worth like a third that much 

237.97 241.63 A: but i mean i never had any money in my pocket and 

241.12 243.95 B: well you chose not to have money in your pocket 

243.79 256.38 A: yeah i didn't i didn't cash in it was this was supposed to be a thing that was supposed to grow towards retirement so it's like well you're worth this you're worth this and now i'm not worth that but where did all the money go in the meantime 

257.44 261.00 B: i don't think ah anybody made money on it 

261.15 264.58 B: maybe the arbitrators 

265.43 272.93 A: well did anybody actually get any money or take any money or or like buy things with any of that money or was it all just on paper 

273.25 275.49 A: was it just like figures that were not 

274.07 276.86 B: well people that were doing well 

276.92 283.70 B: certainly took advantage of the of the of the income some people you know took income instead of growth 

284.08 285.67 B: (( and ah )) 

286.57 297.79 B: um i i have first hand knowledge of a couple that retired he was in his fifties she was fifty maybe forty eight at the time 

297.87 299.54 B: they sold their 

300.54 303.11 B: very expensive home in annapolis 

303.25 304.94 B: he quit his 

305.30 309.78 B: medical practice she sold her her small business 

309.92 315.32 B: and they went to live on their sail boat and they cruised the bahamas and the carribean in the winter 

315.52 320.85 B: and went up to maine and worked their way south over the summer 

321.53 334.50 B: and they did that for three or four years enron came along and their net worth and income evaporated so much that they've both gone back to annapolis maryland and reentered the workforce 

336.51 339.62 A: well they at least got their three four years out of it 

340.33 341.81 B: yep 

341.07 347.58 A: well i i did something kind of similar just this past six months i watched my retirement folio evaporating 

347.88 354.45 A: [mn] it went down so far that finally in december i said the hell with it i went out and bought a brand new harley hundredth anniversary edition 

354.75 355.82 A: i said 

355.41 357.98 B: that's the big soft tail chain drive 

357.51 364.00 A: that's the big yeah it's the ele- i got the electra glide it's the big anniversary electra glide the the the touring bike 

364.69 369.60 A: and i said well what the hell i might as well ride my [laughter] ah retirement 

369.88 372.53 B: (( well you may as well go to sturgess in august )) 

372.15 378.83 A: go out to sturgess and at least i've got the you know at least i've got something in hand i've got an actual physical motorcycle 

379.16 383.73 B: you need a motorhome to go with that and then head out to sturgess for six weeks 

383.35 384.65 A: for six weeks 

385.06 392.24 A: it would be actually between the two i would rather head down your way i would rather take the bike head down your way and do the diving down there 

393.04 399.41 A: rather than up to sturgess go down ah well bike week in daytona's too early in march the water's too cold to dive down there 

400.07 401.04 A: march 

401.68 405.97 A: but i'd rather head down your way on that bike and then ah 

406.48 412.19 A: start in lauderdale and work my way through the keys and dive off of all the reefs and the wrecks down there 

413.89 420.76 A: that now that at least i'd have something to show for what was on that paper for my retirement before they finally put me away 

419.79 420.76 B: [laughter] 

421.27 424.20 B: well there's a lot of people that are in worse shape than that 

423.80 425.01 A: (( yep )) 

425.80 428.82 B: so you know look at people with credit card debt now 

429.43 431.02 B: (( and ah )) 

431.23 432.93 B: and and 

433.43 436.18 B: getting hit by enron but 

434.95 436.62 A: yeah 

437.05 440.44 A: that's all the way up and down the line i guess it's got everybody hit 

442.22 444.30 B: i like the japanese system 

444.86 453.99 A: i thought that was eminently fair i mean you know as you move your way up the line you knew exactly what you had you were exactly in proportion to everybody else down the line 

454.22 457.10 B: well maybe congress should get involved somehow 

458.18 466.52 A: well i they they don't seem to have much of an incentive it does not seem like our congress has been hit as badly [laughter] by the economic situations as we have 

466.23 469.00 B: because they're supported by corporate america 

468.68 470.59 A: supported by corporate america 

473.95 479.57 B: so therefore the little guy can never do anything and the shoplifter's gonna continue to 

479.62 482.93 B: go to jail or the cashier who 

483.54 494.81 B: who takes two dollars for lunch is gonna continue to go to jail while the c._e._o. who has a golden parachute is gonna make millions of dollars no matter what happens to the company 

495.47 497.79 B: without any responsibility 

498.02 506.02 A: yeah that that is a mind blower that the guys that the hire run the place into bankruptcy and they still get paid 

506.58 513.43 A: i mean ah you know a salesman who works on commission a guy who sells cars you don't sell the car you don't get a pay check 

514.35 526.35 A: you know if if the company that hires you ah you don't sell for them or produce for them you get nothing they get nothing it's amazing that someone they hire to run a company ruins the company 

527.07 529.49 A: and yet he still makes a profit out of it all 

532.02 535.47 B: and he comes in with the knowledge that he's a corporate raider 

535.31 537.01 A: (( yep )) 

537.50 538.98 A: knows that going in 

541.27 552.41 A: worse other than that i mean one of these days i'd like to get in a in a discussion with one of those guys who you know made their millions out of that and and see their perspective how they defend that 

553.10 555.16 B: oh call bill gates 

556.22 557.05 A: well 

557.16 558.53 B: or ted turner 

558.11 570.65 A: yeah ted turner yeah no those two guys that's not an enron thing those guys did provide stuff okay i mean gates provided ah i mean i i understand the monopoly and the whole routine 

570.11 571.79 B: how 'bout donald trump 

572.11 579.63 A: well all right you got okay trump is trump is a yeah trump i would say is a did not provide anything for anybody 

579.82 582.94 A: he just skimmed he just he just took the money and ran 

584.55 593.61 A: i'll i'll go with trump gates gates provided something i mean i can't i can't dump on gates because you know i sit and use my computer and as frustrating as it is 

593.90 596.86 A: he he made it possible for me to do that 

596.35 599.89 B: and get paid ten bucks for this phone call [laughter] 

598.74 599.89 A: (( ah [laughter] ))
