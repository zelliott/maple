154.32 166.62 A: even long distance phone calls were very very expensive and so you know it was hard to talk on the phone with people who were far away and now with email it just seems like it's it's much easier to keep in contact with people what'd you think 

157.48 158.23 B: yeah 

166.39 174.16 B: y- yeah it is but email's not very uh personal you don't feel like you're talking to your friend you feel like you're just like a penpal

214.05 225.44 B: it could be a stranger sending me that it's it's it's so im- you know and it's really hard it it's see people we need to be in person to person contact

250.74 261.66 A: two years or or uh you know something like but i still feel very close to them even though i don't see them a lot and then um you know and then 

261.79 270.99 A: um yeah it's just an interest how about how about relatives and friends do you think of any of your relatives as friends or or are they are they kind of two two groups 

270.81 280.27 B: uh they're two different groups i'm hard- i'm hardly close to any relatives i always see them as family over friends um you know
