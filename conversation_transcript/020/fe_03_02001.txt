7.76 10.63 A: this topic is not too exciting [laughter] 

9.69 15.01 B: i i don't even really understand what it is we're talking about [laughter] 

14.38 19.85 A: it's supposed to be something about the i guess like the enron scandal and 

19.25 20.82 B: yeah 

20.07 23.89 A: [mn] it didn't affect me at all because i don't have any stock 

23.43 29.93 B: it didn't affect me at all and i just read about it in the paper and watched it on t._v. and shook my head 

29.61 31.35 A: yeah i uh 

31.72 32.71 A: well 

32.65 35.93 B: i mean i just knew you know i i mean i 

36.42 40.96 B: don't suspect that the people working in those companies are 

41.51 43.57 B: very [sigh] um 

43.82 46.64 B: above board i think that there's a lot of 

46.76 48.67 B: they give a lot of tips 

48.89 54.47 B: or what do they call it the underground trading yeah i mean 

50.98 52.71 A: insider trading 

53.93 64.84 A: i don't think that anybody you know gets to that point by being honest [mn] you know i don't think anybody would get that job by playing by the rules 

59.83 61.15 B: i don't yeah 

64.28 74.56 B: i yeah i d- i mean i don't trust them and i think now i mean it's nothing different going on it's just with all the technology they can catch it quicker 

73.81 74.79 A: (( aha )) 

74.75 80.47 B: they can they can monitor their their computer activity and stuff they know what they're doing 

80.21 87.01 A: well what i don't the one thing that i do know about that i don't like is that a lot of people's um 

87.28 101.32 A: retirement plans were tied up in investments made into those companies and then when they went bankrupt the people have no retirement a lot of them had to go back to work but the crooks got to keep a lot of their money 

91.63 92.46 B: (( yeah )) 

100.69 111.28 B: but you know the stock market to me it's nothing more than a gambling boat without the music and the lights and the people don't seem they they feel like it's uh 

106.99 108.09 A: mhm 

111.27 118.40 B: something of character and above board where really it is a crap ship just as much i mean 

118.76 119.75 B: it is [mn] 

120.30 124.06 B: it there there is no such thing as a sure a sure thing stock 

123.26 128.37 A: no well i think they just wear a suit and tie and it's just like any other kind of scam that's going 

125.58 127.14 B: yeah you got it 

128.15 136.40 B: you got it and it's greed these people that boo hoo because they lost all their money what was the motivator it was greed 

135.85 136.87 A: right 

136.67 140.33 B: it was greed i can't feel sorry for somebody who 

140.32 144.24 B: you know they they'll have these profiles of these fifty year old women who 

144.18 156.01 B: you know maybe they've like save- they've managed to save like a hundred thousand dollars to their retirement plan and then they put it all on some you know sure thing quote unquote 

154.79 167.39 A: right but what i was talking about like i work for the you know the federal government and a lot of people like i work a voluntary service so we have like a lot of retired people that re- you know that volunteer 

159.68 160.71 B: mhm 

165.40 166.43 B: mhm 

167.35 175.20 A: well they work for companies they're getting money taken out for a retirement plan they don't know how it's being invested you know 

174.10 177.86 B: oh don't they get a i mean they don't get a choice of how 

176.82 185.62 A: no you know a lot of people it's just in- you know they don't know all they know is they are getting x. amount of dollars taken out for retirement for a pension plan 

185.40 186.35 B: mhm 

186.27 196.19 A: and then this one man uh he's like seventy five years old so he was going to start increasing his hours and doing more volunteer well here the 

194.46 195.47 B: mhm 

196.24 200.14 A: the he had retired the thing went bust the man had to go back to work 

200.05 201.44 B: yeah i mean 

200.65 206.98 A: and he didn't invest it it was you know the company or his union invested their f- their funds that way 

206.67 213.49 B: yeah i mean it it's like there's there's so many so much crookedness and i mean [sigh] it's just 

213.37 226.56 B: [mn] well it it's a it's a joke because if they if they had of put them all in the prisons they wouldn't be able to they would have to clear out the prisons to f- to they'd have to let the ones that are in there out to put them in 

220.32 221.58 A: mhm 

224.60 225.56 A: right 

226.17 230.26 A: and what disgusts me is it's like their crime is different than 

230.29 232.87 A: you know the av- you know street crime 

230.97 231.69 B: (( mhm )) 

232.47 233.82 B: oh huh

250.86 251.82 B: yeah 

252.64 266.40 B: it is like i mean the the white collar criminal is is not any i mean it's like it doesn't matter if they're embezzling money from the company or whatever [mn] there is no shame attached to it a kid who robs 

263.53 264.56 A: (( mhm )) 

266.83 272.15 B: the local candy store has more stigma than some guy with a suit and tie 

271.64 274.92 A: exactly and the kid might have been robbing because he's starving 

274.42 278.92 B: yeah but it's like i mean they're going to be tougher on on him 

279.11 280.07 A: yeah 

279.18 281.15 B: and they got you know it's 

281.41 282.68 B: it's just [mn] 

282.45 284.08 A: it's a double standard 

283.40 290.27 B: well you know here where we i live in cincinnati we're close to kentucky where they had this this guy this erpenbeck 

290.07 299.98 B: builder scandal i don't know if you ever if it if it hit the national papers it was a guy who was a builder and he didn't pay the people he was you know getting his 

292.19 293.60 A: mhm 

300.22 310.69 B: wo- his the construction stuff done with but what he would do is like once a year he would take them all on a cruise which [mn] which virtually cost him nothing because when you think about it 

306.11 307.21 A: mhm 

310.24 311.71 A: he wrote it off 

311.12 322.63 B: well he yep and he's not paying them anyway i mean he's not paying his suppliers but he's saying well you know he's say- he's putting them off but he's saying he's going to invite them on this free cruise 

316.20 317.26 A: (( get out )) 

322.25 324.98 A: and they would go on the cruise rather than get paid 

323.62 329.34 B: well yeah well they are going on the cruise and they are thinking okay you know we just have to wait for the money 

328.73 330.08 A: mhm 

329.43 336.45 B: so you know you can buy a cruise ticket for two hundred and fifty bucks it's the money they're going to spend once they get on there 

332.79 334.11 A: mhm 

336.63 341.74 B: but you know he was just doing this and people didn't want to speak up to get their money 

341.89 344.73 B: because then they won't be invited on the trip 

344.17 345.48 A: oh 

345.14 356.27 B: but then somebody spoke up and even they well he owed like he owed them like fifty thousand dollars so they filed suit then the house of cards started falling down
