134.92 137.27 B: i go to this internet forum 

137.48 146.82 B: and there are a lot of women there and i guess i really kinda consider them friends i don't ever se- i've never seen 'em i've never really met them but 

147.10 160.21 B: it's the kind of place where if you something's happened and you need to talk about it you can go there and you know whine and carry on about things and i guess they're probably closer friends to me than

167.50 180.02 B: it seems like most every clo- i haven't really had a really really close friend that i absolutely trust since i've been in high school and i've been out of high school you know for twenty five years it just seems like now 

180.07 187.20 B: when you you think somebody is a friend but then you find out through one thing or another that they're really not so 

187.44 190.33 B: that's kinda where i'm at right now it's a 

190.74 193.95 B: you know a keep your distance type of thing

257.57 258.51 B: (( uh-huh )) 

263.56 264.56 B: uh-huh 

266.10 267.58 B: (( [laughter] )) 

266.94 268.32 A: and um 

269.24 274.27 A: i sort of did consider those people my friends although we never actually 

274.39 282.53 A: talked to each other we just sent emails back and forth but then after a while it got a little crazy got really intense um 

276.35 277.34 B: uh-huh 

282.60 285.43 A: they started the flame wars and you know 

285.00 287.31 B: oh see that's that's really 

286.67 294.74 A: yeah arguments and cliques and stuff and i got away from that and got into another 

287.65 288.66 B: (( [mn] )) 

289.70 290.41 B: (( [sigh] )) 

294.86 297.10 A: group um 

298.31 299.51 A: and 

300.07 305.12 A: they were using um email i do you know about the yahoo um 

305.18 306.69 A: yahoo groups 

305.96 308.19 B: yeah i've seen those 

306.97 310.54 A: before yahoo took it over i guess it was just um 

310.61 312.96 A: i forget who was running it but 

313.03 316.44 A: uh it's like a a group 

316.64 322.48 A: and you can communicate um through individual email or through um the webpage where all the 

320.03 321.17 B: uh-huh 

322.53 325.57 A: the messages are posted on the webpage 

324.93 326.29 B: mhm 

326.01 327.41 A: and um 

327.93 342.65 A: there is various different groups that mostly what we were concerned with this is men and women what mostly what we were concerned with is making money and making money fast so a lot of it was like ponzi sch- schemes 

336.92 338.94 B: yeah yeah 

341.37 342.26 B: (( hm )) 

342.66 344.86 A: and um then 

345.13 349.42 A: people started dis- discovering this thing called e. gold 

349.85 355.30 A: and people some people were like doing ponzis and other were 

355.60 357.36 A: trying to do um 

357.65 361.31 A: things like um amways sort of stuff um 

359.99 360.93 B: uh-huh 

361.36 363.08 A: m. l. m. 

363.24 372.17 A: and then they just started doing gambling and through e. gold you could like set up a game where you just put money in 

365.99 367.19 B: (( oh )) 

367.98 368.95 B: (( [laughter] )) 

372.19 373.77 A: and hopefully 

373.82 381.12 A: you would get like twice the money you put in back in a day or maybe an hour or whatever and that was fun for a while 

376.94 377.94 B: yeah 

381.52 382.88 A: and then 

383.68 387.69 A: through this network of people that were doing this e. gold thing 

387.84 388.92 A: um 

389.09 389.87 A: uh a 

390.38 398.37 A: group got together and formed a company and said they had found the way a legitimate way to make a lot of money in a short period of time 

396.53 398.09 B: (( mhm )) 

398.44 403.62 A: so a lot of us started joining that and for a month we we were making money 

403.27 404.77 B: yeah 

404.20 416.67 A: and a lot of sceptical people said oh it's just a ponzi and a lot of other people said we're really making money and we really we felt like we knew the people that were running the the the um 

414.12 415.02 B: uh-huh 

417.43 423.68 A: the company but after a while they stopped making money and it turned out to be just a big scam 

420.74 421.86 B: (( [laughter] a )) 

422.95 423.92 B: scam 

423.98 424.92 B: yeah 

424.04 432.48 A: but during that time we were um communicating through chatrooms actually talking to each other although we couldn't see each each other 

428.63 429.58 B: uh-huh 

431.32 432.23 B: yeah 

432.52 434.99 A: plus email and that was really fun 

434.98 435.65 B: (( mm )) 

435.67 449.02 B: look don't you i mean i kinda think like now and in the situation i'm in i guess really the internet friends if you want to call them friends and you know like these forums and stuff that i go to 

449.15 454.85 B: um they post pictures of themselves and their kids and things and i consider 'em friends but 

454.96 456.78 B: it's kinda like 

456.94 459.31 B: it's safe because 

459.33 466.21 B: i guess the reason that i don't really have any really close friends is i'm kind of selfish of my time 

466.24 471.81 B: and to be a friend you really have to like be there when they need you 

471.88 480.19 B: and that's not always something that i want to do i mean i've been alone for a long time and i've kind of lost 

480.53 493.11 B: the ability to be considerate of other people's wants needs and desires you know i mean i've i've got my own problems and you know even though i am lucky enough to have a job you know things are hard for me and i do 

493.68 498.15 B: i spend a lot of time on the computer i do a lot of um 

498.51 509.64 B: like these internet surveys for money and reward programs and things like that that i have found out you know and it just it seems like by the time i get home from work 

504.52 505.53 A: mhm 

509.76 510.80 B: and 

510.83 513.94 B: you know go through emails and do all the stuff i wanna do 

514.14 519.74 B: it's just like time to get up you know and start another day and i just don't really seem to have time for 

519.92 526.15 B: social events and it's hard too when you're struggling and you don't really have the money that other people have 

525.96 527.34 A: yeah 

526.37 534.68 B: i mean you know everybody's like well let's do this and let's do that and you get tired of making excuses for not doing it 

534.94 541.90 B: when really the real reason is you really can't afford to do it and i don't know i just i just feel safer with the internet 

542.25 543.72 B: stuff but i 

544.10 548.47 B: i'm always suspicious too of those things i see on the internet that you know i think oh 

548.74 558.46 B: that can't be true or it can't really work like that or everybody would be doing it if there was really that much money to be made but i don't know how did you find out about this 

558.56 561.54 A: um through my little network of um 

561.57 568.57 A: the e. gold people and um people trying to make money through this and that um there's this lady that um 

562.97 564.30 B: yeah 

568.76 578.87 A: has been running um um a newsgroup for a long time she has she has a really large list and she sent out she sent out an email telling us about the 

575.00 576.00 B: (( mhm )) 

578.79 579.58 B: this 

578.89 581.93 A: this new program where we can make thirty dollars 

581.22 583.68 B: yeah [sigh] yeah well i 

582.14 584.74 A: so how did you hear about it 

584.03 593.43 B: well i go to i don't really know i guess i can tell you they don't have any restrictions on this i go to a forum called the big big savings forum 

593.47 599.95 B: and if you want to check it out it's just w. w. w. big big forums dot com and they have a
