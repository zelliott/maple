17.57 18.42 B: (( oh )) 

17.83 19.58 A: so i think the uh 

20.23 32.86 A: the corporate scandals with enron and and so on and so forth really do affect me in a certain way with 401k retirement and stock options and buying in into my company and all that 

35.24 36.44 B: well the 

36.92 39.15 B: (( the )) 

39.39 42.53 B: laws of disclosure 

42.62 46.32 B: have been changed in the last year so 

46.39 48.69 B: since bush became president 

49.27 55.67 B: when the scandals broke with enron and c._b._c. c._w._c. 

52.37 53.59 A: right 

56.13 59.83 B: or c._w. c._d._w. whatever it was 

59.21 60.99 A: mhm 

59.97 61.27 B: c._b._w. 

61.53 64.15 B: cbw the bell tel the telephone company 

63.97 69.49 A: right there was a cable company involved and and there's there's numerous actually they 

66.44 68.50 B: (( right )) 

69.66 73.87 A: are just the ones we have heard about what about the ones we haven't heard about 

73.04 74.75 B: right 

73.96 79.79 A: i mean i just don't know you are retired and basically it probably affects you too 

77.15 78.52 B: i was reading the 

79.64 81.09 B: yes it does 

81.28 82.52 B: um 

83.07 84.91 B: i was reading in uh 

85.75 89.09 B: the financial times the other day 

89.52 90.50 B: (( that bush )) 

90.56 94.28 B: is thinking of taking the english laws 

94.57 95.56 B: on 

95.76 97.86 B: accounting procedure 

98.56 100.19 B: (( and um )) 

100.58 102.97 B: i used to be an accountant 

102.10 103.22 A: oh okay 

103.98 105.62 B: and uh 

106.80 108.68 B: it's pretty simple 

110.39 122.16 B: thing to do the laws but where the the real trouble comes in is these accounting firms that do consulting business on the side with their auditing procedures 

121.74 123.59 A: right 

123.32 127.70 B: and that can that cannot affect the auditing when they are consulting 

127.84 137.05 B: a company as to what to do and then they come over with an audit that shows their consulting ideas were wrong so then so so 

137.07 140.18 A: and and who who takes the blame for that 

137.39 143.90 B: it just makes sense that they may jiggle the books a little bit to make it look like they were right 

141.18 142.07 A: right 

143.40 148.91 A: and who takes the blame for that only if and when they get caught i would assume correct 

148.32 158.76 B: right only when they're caught they've tried to separate the two between accounting firms and consulting firms so that they're not the same business 

158.98 162.81 B: like arthur andersen and companies like that that have 

160.37 163.52 A: right right have they done that or no 

163.40 164.55 B: (( what )) 

163.93 166.72 A: have they done that have they separated them or no 

165.62 166.45 B: they 

167.02 169.50 B: no they they won't do it 

169.34 170.99 A: well then that 

169.84 173.75 B: they got a powerful man in the i 

175.66 180.78 B: don't know where it's at but it's in the somewhere in the accounting review 

181.07 185.24 B: board that uh won't allow it 

185.59 187.57 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

186.62 192.68 B: so there's been no change in the law really accounting firms are supposed to do that on their own 

188.69 190.69 A: what what what's that sort of what 

192.04 194.68 A: what does that sort of tell us though [laughter] 

194.33 195.92 B: the government's weak 

196.09 197.55 A: oh i'm telling you 

197.67 200.06 A: some some may right here somewhere 

199.43 203.33 B: if you tell a company well if you invest a 

203.36 214.73 B: certain amount of money in this you come up with a better profit or if if you change over to machinery instead of hand that it 

212.91 214.00 A: right 

214.89 224.75 B: it will turn over a better profit and if it doesn't then you look bad they make more money on their consulting fees than they make on accounting 

224.92 234.31 A: and and then their consulting fees are taken out but then if if the company doesn't turn a bigger profit nobody pays for that loss except for the company 

234.15 235.70 B: no stockholders 

235.25 237.07 A: yeah exactly 

236.46 241.97 B: and the stock wire goes down and like enron these different companies that have 

241.10 249.06 A: and and what and what do we do with these with these officials that get caught with their hand in [mn] per se the cookie jar do we do we throw them in jail 

249.00 252.60 B: i don't think they do anything to them compared to a regular thief 

252.66 255.80 B: if you robbed a bank and what they robbed them of 

255.42 256.72 A: right 

256.44 257.49 B: why 

258.11 260.18 B: they'd be in jail for life 

260.46 262.00 A: i mean look 

261.39 263.64 B: solitary confinement 

263.05 266.80 A: right look look at case in point with martha stewart 

266.03 267.71 B: yeah martha stewart 

268.42 271.16 A: i mean i i haven't heard she's gone to jail 

271.11 273.47 B: she hasn't gone to jail or anything 

273.41 283.99 A: i mean i i haven't heard i haven't heard her even get a slap on the wrist i know her stuff is still in kmart and people still buy it so obviously you know it's it's just 

279.19 280.22 B: yeah 

283.88 293.06 A: i don't know i don't know if this has to be regulated in some way or stiffer penalties or stiffer fines or something but does it really work or doesn't it 

290.53 291.53 B: right 

292.73 294.17 B: right 

293.48 295.30 A: that that's my question 

295.16 296.70 B: (( right )) 

296.10 310.85 A: and it basically affects me to the point where if if i get a uh annual performance review and i get a raise do i want to dump some of that money into my 401k or do i want to buy more stock in the company but then how i do know that's safe 

311.16 312.41 B: right 

312.45 317.36 A: you know it it's just and and you're in this type this line of business sort of in accounting 

316.03 320.53 B: well like in enron all those executives sold out 

319.96 321.61 A: (( yeah )) 

320.91 324.35 B: before the thing really went under 

324.43 326.96 B: and made their made money on it 

324.57 325.41 A: (( yeah )) 

326.31 328.24 A: and don't you think they had a clue 

328.42 329.50 B: (( what )) 

328.90 330.48 A: they had to have a clue 

330.06 334.66 B: oh they had a clue all right that's why they're invest- that's why they're 

335.41 338.25 B: (( i don't think any of them have any )) 

338.46 345.29 A: uh yeah i i thought i thought i thought they were but i don't um you don't you don't really hear about it any more 

340.48 341.94 B: (( of )) 

343.50 345.53 B: (( them gone to jail )) 

345.44 349.68 A: you don't really hear about what the what the final decisions were 

347.95 356.57 B: i don't know it it has shaken the confidence of the stock market and the economy is down 

354.32 355.73 A: oh absolutely 

356.02 359.31 A: and the war has done that and everything else but 

357.81 361.92 B: and uh i i that's part of the reason 

364.17 368.80 A: i i just don't i just don't understand this as citizens 

368.95 374.06 A: and and so to speak the low people on the totem pole what the hell we could do about 

373.64 375.14 B: right 

374.42 380.67 A: it and i'm not sure if we can do anything about it i guess it's sort of like in god we trust so we've got to cross our fingers 

379.76 381.68 B: [laughter] 

380.77 387.17 A: [laughter] and and [laughter] when you cross your fingers too many times pretty soon you get a blister 

387.30 388.92 B: (( that's right )) 

388.05 391.35 A: so i i i don't know how this works or 

391.57 398.61 A: what it's about but i find these topics you know interesting to get other people's opinions from across united states where you from dick 

398.63 400.20 B: cincinnati 

399.59 400.99 A: cincinnati ohio 

400.67 401.75 B: yeah

433.24 437.26 A: [cough] yep and and sometimes you know 

433.54 435.15 B: saved my life 

437.86 438.42 A: (( [mn] )) 

438.47 448.54 A: that's what you got to do you got to reach out to people and that and maybe that's that's a concern with the government maybe they sort of should start reaching out for us instead of taking from us 

449.18 450.93 A: (( i mean [mn] and [mn] )) 

450.97 454.52 A: if anybody doesn't gather it whether one's a paid up 

455.13 456.32 B: right 

455.47 461.75 A: you know what i'm saying we're the we're the one's that put them in office we're the ones that keep them in office we're the ones that voted them out of office 

461.95 465.23 A: but basically it's just us little guys

477.66 479.41 B: or more is it 

478.90 482.45 A: [cough] and with small business today i mean 

482.60 493.58 A: most of your small businesses are sort of like family run businesses do they really have the option for 401k and and stock options and everything else like that you don't you don't you know probably not
