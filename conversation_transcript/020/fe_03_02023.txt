100.62 110.34 A: it's [mn] i don't even know it's just horrible and like so many people have lost jobs because people are cutting back they make up the losses from their accounting lies 

110.41 111.61 A: and 

111.70 113.86 A: it's just crazy i know 

114.22 128.22 A: gosh at least like ten to fifteen people who've lost their jobs because of cutbacks because you know the accountants had to redo everything and realised that or didn't real- well they had known that they weren't making as much money as they were thought they were

155.24 159.39 A: and the industry airline industry is already just so horrible 

159.82 162.52 A: i mean just because of nine eleven so 

162.25 166.49 B: [mn] that's another topic [laughter] [mn] 

163.36 164.41 A: you know 

165.15 175.49 A: and yeah i was just reading um just probably a few hours ago about how the um the i guess the president or the c._e._o. of american airlines resigned over the l-

177.38 181.02 B: yeah yeah i heard something like that on the news i was kind of listening to the news 

180.51 192.43 A: yeah he snuck in a clause in the contract that him and all of his cronies would get bonuses if they pulled the company out of bankruptcy so it's like they are asking these people to take all these huge cuts 

192.00 192.99 B: wow 

192.33 196.77 A: but if they don't go into bankruptcy they all get you know like thousands of dollars 

195.17 197.52 B: these guys get money instead yeah 

196.87 201.20 A: yeah and they tried to sneak it in so i mean just because of that 

201.28 206.41 A: you know they might end up going bankrupt anyway just because someone was trying to lie 

205.89 210.44 B: [mn] [mn] well o- okay i d- did see tonight on the news and this is right in chinatown 

210.45 211.21 A: oh

215.48 216.89 A: (( really [noise] that's right )) 

218.07 225.87 B: to get their money out because there was a scandal and somebody you know embezzled so much money i forget how much they said out of this bank

252.28 256.16 B: you know i don't have a hundred thousand dollars in the bank so i'm not worried about it 

253.53 266.09 A: [laughter] oh my god i wish i had to run to the bank to take out you know a couple hundred thousand so i could just be a little bit but i mean that it it's just horrible it's just messing up so many people's lives you know if 

256.48 258.72 B: [laughter] 

265.21 267.12 B: and you can't trust anybody 

266.56 267.55 A: at all

269.90 276.19 B: [mn] they did that and they all the prices on the stock market went up and all these people made all this money but it wasn't real money 

275.77 277.37 A: yeah yeah 

276.73 279.41 B: because the stocks weren't really worth that much 

279.57 288.39 A: and i mean this the people that lost all their pension money who had like a lot of people had their pension invested in enron and a c- and arthur andersen 

287.76 289.63 B: oh i can't imagine 

288.74 301.45 A: and so there are all these like kind of like you know blue collar regular people who thought oh my gosh we are making so much money because all our stock was in the right places and now they are retiring and they are like we don't have any money

317.72 318.59 A: um 

319.92 321.78 A: it's true and [mn] i 

320.66 325.20 B: you know martha stewart [laughter] you can't trust martha stewart any more [mn] 

322.37 323.68 A: [laughter] oh my 

324.04 329.89 A: gosh yeah that was crazy and actually like she's been laying low for a while now too 

330.15 330.91 B: yeah 

330.21 333.84 A: i haven't like heard anything from i don't even know if her show's on any more

336.42 341.64 A: yeah and it [laughter] it's one of those things where you watch it just to see but you are not going to do it 

341.16 342.13 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

342.39 344.50 B: like how can she know all these things [mn] 

344.88 345.67 A: huh

347.89 358.07 A: you know o- off topic real quick one of my um really good friends her sister in law is actually the woman that does all the stuff she works for martha stewart and she comes up with all the stuff 

355.70 356.44 B: (( ahah )) 

357.62 359.26 B: [laughter] 

358.69 362.70 A: so once again she's promoting all these ideas that are hers but they are really 

362.10 366.20 B: yeah if you can't trust martha stewart who can you trust [laughter] you know [mn] [mn] 

364.10 375.48 A: [laughter] i know supposed to be all american woman and you know all the insider trading and i remember in the eighties there was a lot going on and people were going down because of the junk bonds and 

375.81 382.26 A: everything like that and [mn] you know you would think that people would be smart and not try to screw up the system any more 

381.82 385.45 B: yeah i don't understand how they can make the value of something what it's not 

385.10 385.94 A: yeah 

385.94 390.37 B: you know they can make the stocks be worth fifty dollars a share when they are actually only worth twenty 

390.96 395.49 B: and you know so all of that money that was in the stock market wasn't even really there 

394.83 396.38 A: (( there yeah [noise] )) 

396.56 398.22 B: (( it's [mn] it's amazing )) 

398.41 408.98 A: and it and it i guess like it's it's one thing if you're a millionaire and you lose like a hundred thousand dollars but if you are like a thousandaire [laughter] like most 

407.75 411.26 B: yeah [laughter] and and you lose yeah 

409.10 410.43 A: normal people 

410.58 420.37 A: you know for for for just a regular person like you know me to lose six thousand dollars is like okay that equals rent and car and 

419.64 421.43 B: right car payment yeah 

420.38 426.60 A: you know that's like no vacation for a few years you know a lot of missing out on everything [noise] 

426.10 428.13 B: yeah it it's not fair to 

428.18 435.64 B: to us what the the big businessmen are doing and stuff because we can't get in on it you know i mean like we can't we can't afford to 

433.56 434.40 A: (( at all )) 

435.91 440.62 B: to buy the stocks that they're buying and play the games that they are playing and 

440.01 443.07 A: but it all trickles down to everyone else 

442.37 443.86 B: (( it's dangerous you know )) 

443.37 452.00 A: which is bad i mean like um now that k-mart is you know been going back and forth in bankruptcy for so long it's like they're shutting 

449.39 450.52 B: right 

451.20 452.54 B: and a._o._l. 

452.32 465.24 A: yeah yeah and th- they're shutting a._o._l. i think they deserve to go down [laughter] that service but um you know it's it's you see like the people who work in the stores when all these things have to shut down and you know 

457.09 458.79 B: [laughter] 

465.19 468.55 A: like for some people like a k-mart is the only store to work at in a town 

468.15 469.13 B: right 

468.92 473.36 A: and then they are out of a job because somebody made a wrong decision higher up and 

472.96 473.56 B: (( [cough] )) 

475.36 484.85 A: it's just sad it's just really sad i w- wish things would just get back normal it's one of those things where it's like i wish it was four years ago and i could do everything all over again 

484.48 487.39 B: yeah i mean we've had we've had a a great run i mean 

487.69 489.62 B: i don't know how old you are i'm forty two 

489.28 490.43 A: i'm thirty 

490.00 494.17 B: and [mn] my whole life or your whole life too i mean you never wanted for everything 

494.19 497.09 B: everything has always been there everything you ever needed 

496.96 503.83 B: and you know and this st- stuff starts to happen and you go back to the depression days my mum's eighty two eighty no eighty three 

503.70 517.86 B: and she grew up in the depression and she holds onto her money really tight and she knows what it's like 'cause she's been there well we don't know that so we have a tendency to just you know be fr- freer with our money and spend it and not worry about saving it 

507.35 508.14 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

511.77 513.05 A: (( wow yeah at all )) 

517.92 521.39 B: but you never know what's going to happen when these businesses play their games you know 

520.79 527.90 A: yeah and and i've over the past maybe six months i've drastically changed my spending habits like i 

521.79 522.40 B: (( [mn] )) 

528.55 539.58 A: don't go shopping for clothes any more i'm just like okay i have clothes i don't need anything else i h- i have shoes i don't need anything else like i i basically go out and i buy groceries and gas 

539.88 543.81 A: because i'm like any other money has to be put away just in case 

543.20 544.20 B: mhm 

543.82 545.98 A: something even worse happens 

545.41 547.62 B: right you don't know when you're going to lose your job 

547.11 549.63 A: yeah yeah and um 

548.50 554.51 B: [cough] or your husband for that ma- you know what i mean [mn] my husband's b- been with his company for fourteen years now

560.54 565.34 B: you know and and they just fired his boss and actually they they promoted him 

563.19 564.07 A: (( oh )) 

565.35 566.26 B: (( but )) 

566.40 569.40 B: his boss is like you know fifty five years old and 

568.60 570.49 A: (( congratulations for your husband [laughter] ))

584.90 588.59 B: you know college tuition paid and and your whole life changes 

587.90 589.29 A: that's horrible 

588.72 599.95 B: you know when something like that happens and and like these big big businesses like these people at enron i'm sure they are the same thing's happened to them you know their their pensions are gone they all invested in the company 

599.25 599.89 A: yeah
