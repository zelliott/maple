4.74 6.33 A: well um 

6.46 11.96 A: what about friends tell me do you have a lot of friends or do you have a few close friends 

12.58 14.97 B: (( um i do have more um )) 

15.59 20.60 B: i have a few close friends i have a lot of acquaintances um 

19.09 20.16 A: uh-huh 

21.12 23.88 B: i'm generally pretty friendly and i 

23.91 30.82 B: you know i get along with a lot of people but in terms of having friends i only really have a real close few 

30.91 34.25 B: um that i would consider friends 

34.09 40.99 A: that that's true of me too i was as you were talking i was kind of wondering if that's typical of most women 

41.11 49.49 A: whereas men like my husband he seems to have a good many buddies at work but they don't do things too much after work 

50.33 54.63 A: so i don't know i have i have a few close friends and then i have some 

54.79 58.56 A: excellent women peers that i don't really do things with 

60.18 63.64 B: i i'd say that's pretty much true too um 

65.86 69.11 B: i don't know i think i think it really comes down to 

69.12 70.10 B: um 

71.78 76.40 B: (( encountering somebody that um i don't know there's got to be )) 

76.66 81.50 B: something initially there i think that that really connects people 

81.31 82.91 A: yes i agree 

81.54 85.76 B: um in terms of any type of relationship um 

84.27 85.81 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

86.28 92.03 B: but there's usually that one or two people that you encounter in your life that are just 

92.18 102.42 B: i don't know you seem to get along really quick you know in a non-romantic way you know but there's a real connection there um 

102.67 106.51 A: i i've kind of found the same thing to be true i have 

106.78 117.79 A: usually one or two that i'm really kind of in tune with who are who not necessarily in the same ways either but that i have a specific relationship with 

117.84 120.68 A: relative to whatever it is that we share 

121.47 125.15 A: and then i'm a teacher and a lot of the um 

125.60 128.11 A: people that i work with are are 

128.14 131.64 A: my friends in terms of talking through different 

132.16 140.36 A: issues with the classroom or so forth the curriculum but sometimes we talk about our family situations but sometimes we don't 

140.66 141.83 B: sure 

142.59 151.55 B: um where i work um what i do is i work in retail and a lot of my co workers that i encounter um 

146.61 147.52 A: mhm 

153.65 163.94 B: you can't really on the job get into too terribly much about yourself but somebody might bring up an issue that you know is still similar to what you're going through 

164.24 168.54 B: and you know you get a conversation started off that but um 

168.86 179.63 B: in terms of work i'd only have like one real close close friend um that i've developed a good friendship with and i think that's because we have 

179.91 185.22 B: so much in common in terms of our family or life experience and 

185.46 187.21 A: yeah i have some 

187.75 189.88 A: people that i work with who have 

189.84 199.25 A: a child or children the same age as my child and then i have others who are taking care of elderly parents and you know i have an elderly mother so 

199.21 212.80 A: sometimes we discuss those things and but i guess as i've gotten older and since i have a family also here that i live with i don't tend to do things much with my friends i talk to them 

212.86 217.94 A: and especially uh well in meetings before and after meetings or 

218.34 219.10 B: (( true )) 

218.40 221.39 A: some of them we really email quite a bit 

222.57 226.28 A: we don't use the phone too much but we do a lot of emailing 

227.24 228.88 A: do you use that 

229.22 233.75 B: um i used to do it a lot more often um but with 

233.78 238.56 B: with working so much and having such a busy schedule and plus i live 

234.78 236.10 A: ah yes 

238.82 246.49 B: um i'm quite far away from a lot of the the people that i used to know quite well and far away from my family so 

244.90 245.66 A: ah 

246.49 248.16 A: yeah 

246.50 247.41 B: um 

248.52 250.16 B: i don't 

252.18 256.67 B: i don't have access much to a computer anymore 'cause of being so busy 

252.19 253.40 A: i don't 

255.21 255.95 A: (( ah )) 

256.61 261.54 A: oh yeah yeah well my situation's entirely different that way in that 

261.70 268.07 A: i'm an adjunct teacher so i teach a few hours but most of the time i'm at home with my computer 

267.93 280.90 A: grading papers making lesson plans typing into it and so it's very easy to and i live in a rather high tech area in my city so i have high speed 

281.26 289.62 A: d._s._l. kind of st- it's cable but it's very speedy so i ki- my friends and i just kind of communicate back and forth 

289.80 295.90 A: several times a day about little thises and thats it's a whole different way of being in touch i guess 

296.51 298.98 B: yes i really 

299.06 303.70 B: i really enjoy that though you know keeping in touch with people um 

305.16 309.93 B: over email i i i still find that i'm a little 

310.31 313.40 B: bit technology nervous i guess still 

312.49 314.56 A: sure sure yeah 

313.46 315.88 B: because i don't use it so much but 

315.00 316.05 A: sure 

316.07 317.86 B: it really does help 

316.20 317.55 A: that makes a lo- 

317.99 322.38 A: makes a lot of difference i used to be a computer programmer so 

322.62 326.53 A: it's okay for me and my husband's an engineer and 

326.53 337.25 A: so we've always had good computers so that you know it's not it's not frightening because i don't have to maintain it i don't have to install it i don't have to repair it i just have to use it 

337.22 346.39 A: so it's a lot easier it's just it's available to me i guess is what it how to express it but i've noticed an interesting phenomenon 

337.25 337.94 B: [laughter] 

346.90 350.50 A: in terms of my daughter who is in ninth grade now 

350.61 353.33 A: she and her buddies will um 

353.40 357.10 A: talk to each other all day but then they'll race home and they'll 

357.08 369.72 A: get on and do this thing called the instant messenger where they're several of them are in a dialogue all the time all they're doing is going back over what happened at [laughter] school but they like to chat at home as well 

360.75 361.80 B: yeah 

369.98 380.41 A: sort of a running dialogue she gets almost no phone calls as is true for the rest of us but we're always uh you know talking talking talking by typing 

381.04 382.45 A: so [mn] 

382.51 396.21 B: well i think the interesting thing about in terms of email and instant messenger is also that it gives you um time to to mull over you know what you really want to say and how you want to express it as opposed to on the phone 

394.34 398.61 A: well that's a yeah that's an ex- yeah you're right that's 

398.64 405.95 A: yeah you get to edit yourself you get to have your emotions react and then formulate a response 

406.54 411.21 A: ah i like yeah i don't know what the sociologists are going to 

411.81 414.02 A: determine in terms of what 

414.20 422.12 A: that electronics is doing to our friendships but it's not diminishing i mea- but it is definitely different 

417.93 418.56 B: mm 

422.10 424.12 B: yes i think it just 

424.36 428.31 B: it just adds an extra an extra dimension i think 

428.32 436.54 B: like just like what i said before you know it gives you a chance to really you know how many times do we want to take back something 

436.04 437.17 A: (( [laughter] ah yeah )) 

436.68 444.41 B: that we've said or say it in a different way you know when you're typing it out it's like oh i could use a better word or i could say it this way instead 

437.41 438.49 A: yeah 

439.03 440.20 A: yeah 

444.42 448.58 B: i think that helps people to actually communicate better 

448.34 449.82 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

448.74 459.62 B: with each other and then also you know how hard it is when you first meet somebody face to face or even on the phone and how difficult that can be to establish a rapport 

459.78 463.34 B: whereas this like it's kind of a rapport built in 

463.36 464.55 B: (( you know it's just )) 

463.52 464.16 A: (( th- )) 

464.83 475.95 A: that's an interesting observation also i do have some people who just put me on these uh lists that you know they send when they get some funny little piece of humor or something 

476.09 486.99 A: they send it to a whole list of people and sometimes that is just a little bit annoying but but i just read 'em and delete 'em or don't read 'em and delete 'em and just let it go 

482.04 482.72 B: [laughter] 

487.04 493.55 A: because they're at least still sort of staying in touch and sometimes they send me something that's personal instead 

493.82 494.90 B: sure 

494.64 497.88 A: so i don't feel too avalanched by it but 

498.75 504.91 A: i do feel really cut off from people on the days that something's wrong with my cable service 

504.96 506.06 A: i feel 

505.59 506.96 B: oh yeah 

506.16 514.92 A: it's a whole new thing it's almost it's pretty much like being without a phone because i know that the people don't know that i'm not there 

515.02 521.89 A: so they're sending me stuff and i'm not getting any i'm not able to answer them and they think i'm not 

515.57 516.47 B: sure 

522.05 535.71 A: responding or some such thing and it even would be so far as that i might not know about an upcoming meeting if it goes on for two or three days because i use my home email address as my 

532.00 532.79 B: (( ha )) 

535.90 542.41 A: you know primary point of contact because i'm only at the college where i teach for like three days a week so 

542.30 543.54 B: ah 

543.40 550.61 A: uh anyway that's that's just another reason why it's such a link and we uh 

549.65 558.28 B: because because it is such a part of your your life especially socially you know it just feels like you know 'cause that's 

555.03 555.93 A: yeah 

558.36 562.31 B: such a huge a huge connection for you yeah 

562.11 564.56 A: it really is i i don't know um 

564.60 572.38 A: it it works for me because i do get to at least to see these people three days a week or many of them and so 

571.72 572.55 B: (( yeah )) 

572.53 577.45 A: it's not like surrogate friend but it is sort of like an i guess an extension 

577.60 584.41 A: but i would never have time to just sit down and talk to anybo- you know this this many people by phone because 

584.85 594.05 A: with email you don't have to go into everything like how's your mother or how's the we- you know all the stuff you can just say exactly what's on your mind at that point 

589.87 591.52 B: oh yeah 

594.70 596.29 B: absolutely 

594.74 595.74 A: (( and [laughter] )) 

596.04 597.48 A: sign off 

598.44 599.90 B: (( and also too you know it's )) 

598.70 599.81 A: so
