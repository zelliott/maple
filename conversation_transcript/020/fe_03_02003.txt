10.75 17.36 B: something about the government which is a [laughter] which which is a thirty minute topic anyway [laughter] 

16.67 21.77 A: well it it was sort of like what the government with enron and all that was doing

295.90 296.69 B: yeah 

297.72 300.93 A: it it happened there for a while where

323.87 336.54 A: i mean and and the government has got their hands in there too for surcharges and taxes and everything else like that i mean you know it ain't never going to stop it's only going to get worse but then when do you feel safe you don't 

328.08 329.16 B: yes 

329.66 331.10 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

335.41 336.06 B: (( yeah )) 

336.08 341.50 B: i just don't i don't know where it's going i just don't know where it's going it seems to me like when i was a kid

361.95 363.01 B: yeah 

363.25 367.22 A: as soon as somebody finds out and lets the cat out of the bag so to speak 

366.74 367.55 B: yeah

368.29 369.12 B: right 

369.87 370.80 B: yeah 

370.54 373.33 A: and and that's a good thing and then again it's a bad thing

376.76 379.68 B: and you don't know if they're telling the truth 

379.29 384.93 A: i mean if you if you're watching the news lately there was a couple of banks one in new york and one here in philadelphia
