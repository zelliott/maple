7.16 8.33 B: i'm fine 

8.64 15.13 A: uh i'm helen and uh i think i heard the topic i'm not sure it kind of got muffled 

14.51 17.10 B: yeah it was a long one tonight [sigh] 

16.77 21.88 A: i yeah i thought so something to do with what the government and business scandal 

17.65 18.58 B: right 

21.70 25.10 B: yeah yeah what they can do to 

22.36 23.30 A: (( ah )) 

25.42 29.58 B: uh prevent that kind of thing and how it affects us 

30.23 31.84 A: oh boy [laughter] 

31.14 35.74 B: my name's crystal i'm here i'm in t- i'm in houston texas i don't know where you're at 

32.43 33.42 A: hi crys- 

35.21 36.57 A: oh i'm in maine 

36.34 38.86 B: (( maine okay well quite a distance )) 

37.19 41.75 A: yep i'm in uh actually a very small town on the coast of maine 

41.79 42.73 B: wow 

42.62 44.38 A: (( [sigh] [noise] )) 

43.49 44.43 B: okay 

44.58 45.45 B: um 

45.61 48.50 B: as far as how they can prevent it um 

49.84 51.77 B: gosh you know i don't know i don't want 

52.56 56.63 B: more government in anybody's business as it is is i think there's a lot of 

56.99 58.12 B: government 

59.26 60.62 B: intervention 

59.40 62.28 A: i agree i agree um 

61.41 63.97 B: i don't know how they can do it without 

64.18 65.97 B: being in the business more 

66.42 68.52 B: and that's scary i think [sigh] 

67.98 73.07 A: yeah you're you're right that's true i i don't actually i don't work outside the home 

73.15 76.14 B: ne- neither do i not not right now i have a 

73.19 74.04 A: so i 

74.05 80.95 A: [laughter] which makes it a little bit difficult because i really don't have anything to do with business per se 

81.12 83.01 A: but uh i 

83.81 85.45 A: (( don't know )) 

87.04 93.72 A: i don't know it it's just really something to think about because i guess i don't really think about it where i'm not involved 

93.97 95.90 A: that much um 

96.08 99.69 A: i don't play the stock market so i you know that 

99.72 108.81 A: anything to do with that scandal has nothing to do you know and i guess that's not a good way to be but when you live in maine that's you're kind of sort of removed from all of the 

109.30 115.89 A: just you know stuff that goes on in washington and and even even with the war you know just 

115.70 116.61 B: right 

116.17 118.94 A: you're involved but it's not the same 

119.01 121.02 A: as if you're living in the middle of it 

121.31 128.04 B: right um i'm here in houston and i guess you know with the big enron scandal not too long ago i guess 

127.36 129.11 A: right right 

128.30 137.28 B: that that that actually did affect me a little personally because at the time i was working temp jobs you know just clerical and administrative here and there 

136.95 138.46 A: mhm 

137.61 142.30 B: and as soon as that happened and everybody was laid off those jobs went quick and 

142.42 143.41 B: you know 

142.43 145.57 A: oh yeah that definitely would affect 

143.70 144.81 B: (( i mean )) 

144.83 150.35 B: highly skilled people were going for you know clerical jobs just to have something to to work at 

150.26 151.24 A: (( mm mhm )) 

151.82 160.24 A: yeah i actually i heard you know i love the news and i don't i like all the news programs so i kind of that's how i keep up on 

160.66 162.33 A: everything that's going on 

162.38 166.99 A: is you know the datelines and the twenty twenty and the sixty minutes and 

167.06 175.96 A: uh you know programs like that so actually i have to be honest and i know a little about it but i don't know a lot about what went down at that particular 

168.91 169.78 B: yeah 

176.19 177.91 A: you know that particular one 

178.08 178.89 B: yeah 

178.25 179.22 A: so 

179.41 183.27 B: what do you think um the government can do to prevent that kind of thing 

185.72 186.48 A: (( [sigh] )) 

186.61 189.35 A: i don't know i really don't know 

190.49 197.61 A: you know it it amazes me how much goes on and it takes so long for them to get caught 

197.31 198.44 B: (( right right )) 

197.83 202.32 A: you know that that obviously they are not being policed very closely 

202.59 203.81 A: but then 

205.29 210.35 A: i don't know and then you know then then you say you know the government's too involved so 

210.46 220.41 B: right in my opinion i think that the government should should not get that involved and people should have their own police within the company 

220.60 225.36 B: you know they had some whistle blowers on at enron but i mean more people should 

225.66 227.41 B: have access 

227.53 228.67 B: to 

228.85 234.49 B: you know what happens at board meetings and behind the scenes stuff from the higher up people 

234.31 236.13 A: mhm mhm 

236.40 245.13 A: and you have you have to wonder how much uh i don't know what they call it now but uh payola or you know how much is being paid 

245.62 247.55 A: for people to keep quiet you 

247.24 248.26 B: right 

247.89 249.28 A: know uh 

251.23 259.50 A: i don't know because uh obviously there has to be there has to be i mean more than one person knows what's going on so there has to be a lot of 

260.28 261.95 A: secrecy i guess 

261.98 265.97 B: oh yeah i'm sure there's a lot of people not talking because they were 

263.36 264.48 A: i would i would 

265.87 266.92 A: (( aha )) 

266.10 267.48 B: were paid 

267.43 268.42 A: right 

268.58 270.52 A: right or looking the other way 

270.32 271.29 B: right 

270.81 271.71 A: (( you know )) 

272.35 276.74 A: i don't know i'm i when i was working i was a bookkeeper 

277.46 278.41 B: oh 

277.81 282.78 A: and uh but you know uh to be honest i couldn't tell you how to you know how to 

282.90 283.87 A: uh 

284.02 296.65 A: embezzle if my life depended on it [laughter] you know obviously obviously there are other people out there that know how but that's just not something i've ever you know 

286.36 287.67 B: [laughter] 

288.35 289.70 B: (( sounds good )) 

292.68 293.76 B: right 

296.77 305.24 A: because i had it happen you know in a company i worked i i took six weeks off and the person that they hired to do my job did that 

305.55 314.01 A: and it's like i went back to work six weeks later because they called me back in and i'm thinking how come i worked here for all these years and never 

314.10 315.27 B: [laughter] 

314.48 320.88 A: number one it never crossed my mind and number two i wouldn't know how to do it anyway [laughter] so 

316.39 317.35 B: right 

319.77 325.29 B: yeah and it's scary that somebody who brand new to that can just come in and oh i'm going to do this 

322.65 323.44 A: yeah 

323.81 324.65 A: yeah 

324.86 338.00 A: mhm yeah within a very short period of time so you know we're talking on a low scale here so but you can just imagine when you're talking a lot more money a lot more you know higher up positions and 

337.39 338.40 B: right 

338.14 339.60 A: you know so 

339.58 342.60 B: so when you got to work were they did they put any um 

339.70 340.56 A: yeah 

344.63 348.13 B: limits on w- i mean did they change your job to make to where 

348.22 354.55 B: you know it was harder to do that or did they just say well you've been doing it for so long that just keep doing what you do we trust you 

352.65 356.84 A: they just kept they kept it the same way they fired him and uh 

357.19 362.58 A: they didn't press charges it wasn't a great deal of money but the fact was he did embezzle it so 

363.11 365.96 A: they fired him and hired me back and 

366.48 381.42 A: you know that was and actually i i i didn't want to be hired back because i w- wanted to stay home with my kids i have four kids at that time i had three and i you know it was just too much working and trying to i live i was a single mother so it was like oh no i can't it was too much 

374.02 374.90 B: yeah 

381.48 383.29 A: babysitters were hard to find 

383.54 384.59 B: yeah 

383.78 398.37 A: so you know at that time but i did i went back and stayed until the place actually got closed down a couple of years later so [lipsmack] but that's my only real dealings that i've ever had with anything you know anything like that so 

399.53 406.72 A: i don't as i say i don't play the big i don't play the stock market so anything like that does not affect me personally 

406.91 414.33 A: but i certainly i've heard you know i've heard about it i'm trying to think another one besides um [lipsmack] 

414.85 417.56 A: that one you just mentioned was enron enron 

417.92 419.93 B: enron yeah um 

420.26 422.13 B: i can't think of anything right 

422.27 426.96 A: no i can't either i can't right not off the top of my head right now um 

427.92 434.33 A: but there's like well we even have it in the army i mean in the services 

434.36 435.92 A: (( you know all the )) 

436.47 444.60 A: the stuff that goes on and the the equipment that's being bought for like toilet seats for hundreds and hundreds of dollars and 

443.96 445.00 B: right 

444.69 446.18 A: you know so 

447.09 458.76 A: and someone you know someone up there pays for it so i mean i realize it's us the taxpayers but it's uh you know someone o._k.s the cheques pays the bills you know so 

456.30 457.22 B: yeah 

457.43 468.82 B: yeah they should scrutinize that a little bit more better than what i saw a quote the other day that said um someone was asking they were checking in on stuff why did you 

459.87 460.87 A: yeah 

461.01 462.66 A: yeah yeah 

469.23 474.92 B: charge the i think it was the army or the navy a thousand dollars for a pair of pliers and the 

474.94 482.26 B: person who sold them was like well these are very versatile they could clip the item on and take it off and it's like 

482.39 486.85 B: it was just they were regular pliers they sold for a thousand dollars 

482.44 483.17 A: (( [sigh] )) 

484.83 485.80 A: right 

486.27 487.21 A: right 

487.42 492.92 A: i mean that's i guess that's been going on for a long time at least i remember when it was first being talked about 

493.04 496.80 A: and uh uh you know someone's getting the money 

493.29 494.16 B: yeah 

496.85 498.95 A: obviously right so 

498.16 499.12 B: right 

499.18 500.14 A: um 

500.25 504.80 A: i i don't know [mn] when that is happening in the government then you know you 

504.99 509.40 A: have to wonder how you know how are they expecting companies then to 

509.59 511.03 A: you know keep their 

512.72 515.46 B: exactly the government should be the one that 

514.19 520.78 A: like you say if we can't keep the government of all places on the up and up how do we expect to keep you know companies 

520.03 521.15 B: right 

521.20 524.82 A: you know and i mean just another uh another uh 

525.68 529.60 A: um yeah example is is the you know how 

530.27 544.14 A: how salaries what salaries are given to people you know i mean the high up people i mean why why are people that don't do half the work the laborers get paid zilch and the guys who sit behind the desk and push a pencil 

540.73 541.75 B: right 

544.35 548.93 A: get the mil- you know millions or whatever you know hundreds of thousands of dollars a year 

548.87 549.83 B: right 

548.98 550.59 A: you know it is pretty 

551.23 557.52 B: and and business can be really slow and people getting laid off uh you know the lower down people yet they are still making their 

557.37 558.23 A: yep 

557.67 561.67 B: multi thousand dollar bonuses and 

561.45 566.01 A: yep very very true heaven forbid they shouldn't do get their money right

566.21 567.92 A: (( right so )) 

567.86 582.35 A: [lipsmack] i don't know uh there's something not right [laughter] you know there's just with just with that and the fact of the uh you know the the salaries that are paid our sports figures our entertainment figures or you know 

571.67 572.68 B: right 

582.32 583.06 A: (( [mn] ))
