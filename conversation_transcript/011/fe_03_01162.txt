83.87 85.19 B: yeah

92.18 93.93 A: yeah 

93.76 95.17 B: which i didn't do 

99.18 100.28 B: but

115.52 116.99 A: (( i um )) 

115.99 119.58 B: i guess it was just go back in time and what would you change 

124.31 127.09 B: and i think i personally would change um 

127.32 130.81 B: not having kids quite so soon and going to college [laughter] 

130.20 131.94 A: yeah 

132.98 138.35 B: and just getting a chance to go to college and furthering my education 

142.20 144.43 A: yeah i would definitely pick to ah 

145.45 146.86 A: have a better ah 

147.97 149.63 A: better educational plan 

149.75 151.68 A: (( because right now i'm not enjoying it )) 

152.28 154.24 B: you're not enjoying it you said 

154.18 155.45 A: no not at all 

156.88 158.52 B: how long have you been doing it 

158.47 163.34 A: um i've got like ah two years left this is my third year 

163.57 164.68 B: yeah 

164.34 166.92 A: so i'll be graduating nearly but 

169.35 174.31 B: oh wow if you're not enjoying it now i you probably better be changing it 

173.82 175.73 A: mhm 

178.08 179.43 B: what are you studying 

179.70 180.77 A: um 

180.90 184.13 A: history ah basically it's intellectual history 

185.23 188.61 A: is what i've decided on but i would have picked something else originally 

188.56 189.56 B: yeah 

188.91 192.37 A: had i had more time or a better understanding of what i wanted to do 

193.00 196.64 B: oh yes you know now that you say that you're studying history 

196.88 199.87 B: if i was to change go back in time 

199.69 200.67 A: (( mhm )) 

200.08 203.53 B: i have just started ah studying my genealogy 

203.73 205.18 B: my family history 

205.04 206.76 A: mhm 

205.65 210.19 B: and if i was to go back in time i would definitely have started that earlier 

211.35 212.78 B: (( so that i could )) 

212.89 215.28 B: talk to my family members like my 

215.47 217.20 B: great grandparents 

217.00 218.20 A: (( mhm )) 

217.35 221.52 B: who died you know before i was able to talk to them and 

222.90 225.19 B: so do you not like history or 

225.17 226.40 A: oh no i 

225.58 227.43 B: you just changed your mind 

227.62 234.23 A: um no i'm happy with what i've chosen now but i would have ah probably picked something other than history earlier um 

235.11 238.87 A: or at least picked it sooner and not have ah 

240.33 241.44 A: sort of 

241.69 243.80 A: tried to pick and choose among classes 

244.31 245.71 B: yeah 

250.32 253.79 A: yeah i think if i could go back in time i probably would also ah 

254.46 259.45 A: choose to spend more time with ah my grandparents and great grandparents mhm mhm 

259.66 262.34 B: oh yeah that's right that's [laughter] 

262.62 267.32 B: i guess especially with what's going on right now in our world right now 

268.50 271.53 B: you know and they always say that history repeats itself 

271.62 273.32 A: mhm 

272.96 274.25 B: but 

274.95 278.63 B: i don't know i i guess history does repeat itself but i think that 

280.05 281.86 B: you know times have changed 

282.67 284.66 B: and to go back in their day 

285.11 289.13 B: and to understand what they went through it to me it's just fascinating 

290.88 294.89 A: yeah i think that you've sort of ah put an interesting perspective on what's going on now 

294.57 297.51 B: yeah i would just love to go back and see what 

298.18 299.48 B: my family 

299.82 301.93 B: you know way back before me i'm 

302.03 303.94 B: talking like a hundred and 

303.96 308.37 B: actually my family tree i've gone back about two hundred and fifty years 

309.52 312.24 B: and to just go back and see what they lived like 

312.69 313.83 B: back then 

313.97 315.73 A: mhm 

317.77 319.40 B: you know compared to our 

320.05 323.28 B: modern things we have nowadays [laughter] 

322.58 323.43 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

324.17 325.57 B: but 

332.28 335.64 B: well what would you choose is it in the history line or 

336.27 337.31 A: um 

338.95 341.48 A: i would probably choose to do something more along ah 

342.29 344.50 A: sort of a tough core engineering 

344.89 349.46 A: background and apply myself to the classes i would need to have taken earlier on 

349.38 350.50 B: yeah 

353.33 359.36 A: or i might have even choose chosen to ah not go directly into the university but to start in ah like a community college [noise] 

370.75 374.19 B: okay so this is hard [laughter] talking to a stranger 

372.53 373.31 A: (( yeah )) 

375.11 375.95 B: (( [mn] )) 

376.53 380.05 B: so if you really reg- going to go back in time say 

381.95 383.22 B: ten years ago 

383.25 385.09 A: mhm 

384.53 385.98 B: what would you have been doing 

387.69 389.19 A: ten years ago 

391.04 395.63 A: in that case i would have only been like ah just a teenager so 

396.51 401.93 A: ten years ago i'd probably have ah tried to have been a little more outgoing and 

402.87 404.59 A: enjoyed being a kid more mhm 

404.53 411.45 B: yes [laughter] me too i was very very shy back when i was a kid but 

411.81 413.92 B: i've kinda overcome that now 

415.60 418.07 A: (( yeah i was much shyer as a child than i am now )) 

422.92 426.53 A: what would you do if you could have gone back ah like fifteen years mhm mhm 

427.51 429.52 B: back fifteen years 

430.68 432.05 B: um 

436.40 440.85 B: i definitely would have made some different decisions in my life [laughter] 

441.68 443.86 B: well it it's kind of hard to say 

444.07 447.95 B: going back fifteen years right now knowing what i know now 

448.39 451.04 B: would have totally changed everything i ever did 

452.92 455.96 B: back then you know i thought i was doing 

456.13 457.69 B: the right thing and 

462.20 465.85 A: what do you know now that would have ah changed your decision or changed your 

467.05 478.82 A: what you would have done [noise] [noise] can 

470.44 471.32 B: hello 

472.78 474.01 B: are you still there 

475.94 479.35 B: you're cutting out really bad i'm getting a lot of static 

479.71 480.77 A: you hear me now 

480.91 482.46 B: okay yeah i can hear you 

481.89 482.65 A: (( okay )) 

485.49 486.42 B: alright w- 

485.52 486.52 A: yeah if you 

486.48 487.96 B: and what was your question 

488.10 489.09 A: um 

489.52 493.00 A: what do you know now that would have changed your decision fifteen years ago 

492.90 496.24 B: oh how hard life really is 

495.38 497.19 A: yeah 

497.75 499.86 B: if i could only tell my kids 

500.67 502.40 B: what they're really in for 

502.55 509.45 B: you know i don't mean so much hard times and what's going on in the world right now but just simply 

510.81 514.09 B: when you go out and you want to get your own apartment you 

513.60 514.99 A: mhm 

514.14 516.04 B: see i have a nineteen year old son 

516.55 518.26 B: he just got his own apartment 

518.60 521.11 B: if i could go back fifteen years right now 

521.94 525.02 B: i could probably have prepared him a little bit better 

527.26 529.20 B: for what he's really in for 

528.98 531.24 A: mhm is he having problems with that or 

532.49 536.55 B: oh no just financial things just what kids run into 

534.61 535.52 A: (( yeah )) 

536.47 538.28 A: yeah 

536.95 538.40 B: jobs don't pay 

539.10 540.47 A: yeah i can 

540.68 542.04 A: (( attest to that mhm )) 

541.72 543.88 B: [laughter] yeah he kinda 

544.43 546.68 B: you know he runs runs into the 

547.71 550.31 B: i'm tired of school thing i want a break 

550.46 552.05 B: i want out on my own 

554.41 557.24 B: and he's just kinda going through that right now and 

559.91 563.23 B: (( but you know i don't know how you can prepare them for it )) 

562.82 564.04 A: yeah 

563.34 566.21 B: you can talk all day long and 

567.41 569.45 B: they won't get it till they try it 

571.93 572.96 A: that's true 

574.15 578.77 B: which kinda maybe like our going back in time you know like in 

579.22 584.69 B: maybe if we all went back fifteen years they could just talk to us all day long and maybe we still wouldn't get it 

584.59 586.51 A: mhm 

586.75 590.14 A: yeah if you could go back in time do you think can you could tell 

591.32 595.00 A: yourself back then do you think you would have ah heeded your advice 

597.00 598.41 B: probably not 

599.51 599.89 B: (( [laughter] ))
