52.63 53.38 B: so 

53.57 55.63 B: i am just trying to think 

55.92 57.00 B: what i would have 

57.23 58.73 B: done differently 

59.54 60.86 B: i think um 

61.23 62.58 B: i would definitely 

63.94 66.03 B: spend more time with um 

66.84 67.55 B: my 

67.77 68.87 B: grandmother that 

69.24 69.74 B: died 

69.99 71.42 B: like four years ago 

71.65 72.32 B: and 

71.72 72.55 A: i'm sorry 

73.10 75.08 B: yeah that's okay but um 

76.00 76.47 B: i didn't 

76.59 77.23 B: spend 

77.51 80.12 B: a lot of time with her and i wasn't 

80.55 82.91 B: as patient as i should have been

84.62 85.86 B: you know i was still 

86.56 88.92 B: coming out of a teenage years and 

89.06 91.14 B: um not a very nice 

91.28 92.46 B: person 

92.61 95.40 B: so and then she had cancer and she died 

95.57 99.47 B: and i realized that i should have been a better person and 

99.56 99.92 B: um 

101.38 102.96 B: spent more time with her 

103.22 103.59 B: but 

104.56 105.19 B: i think that 

105.32 105.66 B: (( is what it )) 

105.79 107.31 B: i would have changed 

108.73 111.81 A: that's a good thing to change trying to think 

111.22 111.94 B: yeah it's it's 

112.13 113.28 B: sad though i mean 

113.42 117.19 A: yeah it is that's very sad but you know what that's part of 

117.44 119.30 A: growing up and moving on is 

120.14 123.43 A: is to making those mistakes now granted that's a big one 

123.73 130.45 A: but um i personally believe that you will see her you again 

131.77 132.69 B: yeah 

132.91 133.84 B: i hope so 

134.28 135.72 A: you hope so 

135.38 140.10 B: so if you had a chance to go to college 

140.36 141.68 B: what would you do 

141.85 147.12 A: oh if i had a chance to go back and do it all again and do college 

147.25 148.05 A: oh 

148.72 150.97 A: i'd probably go along the lines of teaching 

151.82 152.33 B: okay

326.02 327.65 B: enjoyed so far 

328.49 331.30 A: okay let's talk about 

331.69 334.60 A: if you could go back in time and do something 

335.50 335.99 B: mhm 

336.43 338.47 A: like what would you want to do 

339.90 342.59 B: in my life or if i could change something 

343.03 344.57 A: um eh 

344.05 345.22 B: or global 

345.25 348.81 A: eh heh you could do it as either or you could do it 

345.33 345.74 B: hm 

349.03 351.32 A: something that you might want to do differently 

352.20 355.79 B: hm i think i also thought about 

356.15 360.14 B: if i had a chance to talk to a historical person in the past 

360.39 360.96 A: uh-huh 

360.64 361.89 B: who i would talk to 

362.29 362.81 B: and 

363.52 367.04 B: i always wanted to talk to vladimir lenin 

367.68 372.30 B: the guy i don't know if you know from russian history it's the person who 

372.55 377.32 B: started the revolution and the communism in russia at the beginning of the last century 

377.33 377.86 A: uh-huh 

378.21 383.22 B: so i was always always curious to see what his real motives were and uh 

383.83 385.03 B: um if he had 

385.24 387.09 B: good intentions or if 

387.92 388.34 B: he 

388.59 389.36 B: i mean what 

389.51 393.94 B: what was behind this whole thing because there are hypothesis now that 

394.55 395.51 B: maybe he was 

396.27 398.98 B: he was a sick person and he wasn't really 

399.79 401.80 B: sure what he was doing and 

402.04 405.42 B: other people say he's the devil's son you know who did 

405.66 405.96 B: this 

405.83 407.05 A: oh yeah 

406.89 412.70 B: mess everything up for us so i always wanted to talk to him and uh 

413.02 413.99 B: find out what 

414.15 414.75 B: he really 

415.65 419.36 B: what was really on his mind what about you 

419.76 420.69 B: have you ever thought 

420.58 425.86 A: uh you know i always laugh and i sometimes i think that i um 

426.31 429.38 A: i lived in i'm living the wrong um 

430.64 433.04 A: uh what's the word i'm looking for 

433.61 434.16 B: age 

434.70 440.72 A: yeah kind of i always thought i'd do better with the medieval times 

441.26 442.05 B: oh really 

441.83 446.02 A: yeah because i like all the stuff i like the dresses and 

445.70 446.39 B: mhm 

446.37 449.72 A: it just i don't know there's something about that era 

450.36 452.01 A: that i think is really really neat 

450.52 450.99 B: mhm 

452.79 453.46 B: yeah 

453.72 454.84 B: i think so too

459.47 461.58 B: yeah when i watch the movies i always 

462.16 462.52 B: the 

463.34 463.76 B: the 

463.87 465.44 B: not only the dresses 

465.58 467.67 B: but the way people behaved and 

467.14 469.39 A: yeah 

467.94 468.93 B: women were 

469.03 469.37 B: um
