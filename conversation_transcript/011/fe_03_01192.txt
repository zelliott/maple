321.89 322.80 B: uh-huh

334.81 341.88 B: but i mean even though they didn't continue to have a relationship you know i still believe that he made the right choice [mn] 

341.03 347.27 A: sure i i think so too everybody else seemed kind of like in for it for the money or whatever they could get off of it 

347.16 348.21 B: yeah 

347.57 350.79 A: you know and they would go do anything go anywhere 

350.80 352.75 A: and i thought that was pretty tacky 

352.98 353.79 B: (( yes )) 

353.18 357.85 A: but but she held out she you know she held uh kept her values 

357.25 358.42 B: yes she did 

358.37 360.32 A: so i thought that was pretty cool 

360.13 366.51 B: yeah and she was very family oriented i mean just even her lifestyle the way she lived her life you know 

367.17 371.85 B: with you know she you know she was a caretaker did you know that [mn] 

371.74 374.26 A: yes she took care of her grandmother or something 

372.85 373.54 B: (( i )) 

374.04 378.15 B: think she took care of older uh she worked for like a old folks' home 

377.83 378.60 A: uh-huh 

378.48 380.61 B: and took [mn] care of um 

380.86 382.80 B: you know old people 

382.84 384.49 A: (( yes )) 

383.56 388.74 B: that's what she did [sigh] i mean that that says a lot about her right there [laughter] 

387.75 391.26 A: [mn] oh yeah that takes a lot patience and you know 

391.08 392.02 B: yeah 

391.39 393.19 A: maturity i think 

392.67 393.83 B: yeah 

394.00 397.17 A: to be able to put up with other people's disabilities and 

397.37 405.55 A: and then she was really family oriented she i liked what she said that sh- the first thing she'd do with the money her share of the money is to buy stuff for her family 

406.61 407.74 B: oh yeah 

407.80 416.50 B: and she said i guess her aunt had cancer so everything was gonna go towards you know helping her aunt to get better to recover you know 

416.38 418.04 A: (( yes )) 

417.19 418.26 B: so 

418.39 424.05 B: i mean that seemed [mn] she she saved all the necklaces and the jewelry and everything to sell it 

424.48 426.59 B: so that she could take care of her 

424.66 425.77 A: yeah that 

426.92 428.92 A: that really takes a lot of uh 

429.02 433.87 A: well maybe it doesn't take a lot for her you know but for a lot of people they just want to keep it 

431.04 431.83 B: uh-huh 

433.83 434.77 B: yeah 

434.38 436.75 A: so i think she's got her head on her shoulders 

436.57 437.72 B: yeah 

438.35 441.66 B: i think i think money is not everything so 

441.49 443.13 A: no absolutely 

445.72 446.60 B: (( [sigh] but ))

454.47 456.68 B: oh if we're supposed to cut the call off 

456.34 459.35 A: no i don't know if they're supposed to cut it off or we are 'cause
