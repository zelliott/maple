79.84 80.73 B: oh 

80.22 92.54 A: and they made me it was a horrible experience they made me take her to the pound and i was like it was like i was back to ah when i was eight years old and they used to really force me to do terrible things and

481.93 496.25 A: so i was like well gee i don't feel w- like i'm yeah i mean you know i'm not getting as much swimming happiness let's put it that way i kinda miss you know i could swim with sea turtles in hawaii 

484.68 486.43 B: forget it [laughter] 

487.28 488.70 B: not worth it 

491.46 492.48 B: right 

494.75 498.23 B: oh did you spend a lot of time doing that kind of thing yeah 

496.56 506.52 A: oh yeah i'm totally the big swimmer and then like i mean maui you could be under water during whale season and hear the whales singing 

506.00 508.11 B: oh my gosh how neat 

506.86 515.03 A: and and i mean you know i mean that's pretty rare and it's pretty cool and i miss all of it a lot but i'm really happy that i came 

509.73 510.92 B: that is 

515.05 522.59 A: i wanted to see another type of climate and florida seemed so mysterious 'cause 

523.47 535.03 A: i guess maybe articles that i've read you know even 'cause i teach and so in when i do the weekly reader and they're talking about the everglades and you're like oh my god you know they have these alligators and 

527.53 528.70 B: mhm 

534.18 536.24 B: [laughter] 

535.11 541.53 A: and there's moss hanging off the trees and see in hawaii we don't have thunder storms and stuff 

537.38 538.54 B: right 

541.12 543.10 B: right right 

542.03 547.45 A: t- like tonight here they had this huge thunder storm with lightening and it 

546.52 549.04 B: so you were not used to that anymore 

547.50 556.46 A: it was neat oh it was so cool i loved it it was just really exciting to me because i mean i don't remember that since you know my childhood 

550.26 551.17 B: yeah 

555.55 559.62 B: yeah exactly it probably doesn't even really rain much in in hawaii does it 

556.95 557.62 A: (( right )) 

558.99 569.82 A: oh no it definitely will come down so we can have our water and in fact kunai is the rainy the you know tips of the mountains and kunai is the rainiest pl- place on the planet 

561.15 562.01 B: it will 

569.26 570.11 B: really 

569.98 574.07 A: oh yeah because we've got to have our water otherwise it wouldn't be so green 

572.08 572.80 B: (( true )) 

574.01 575.08 B: that's true 

574.10 575.49 A: but we 

575.50 577.76 A: don't have the humidity 

577.35 578.59 B: mhm 

577.92 581.35 A: and trade winds blow away all the moisture 

581.49 586.87 A: so you're not sweating to death and florida is like so humid 

581.70 585.65 B: that is what makes it so great right that's what makes it so great 

586.24 597.18 B: yes even believe it or not even in nebraska it's extremely humid in the summer it's unbearable it's very hot and very humid so we were in washington for a couple of years and i- 

590.50 591.58 A: really 

596.63 598.59 A: how was that real rainy 

597.54 599.95 B: it's very yes in the win-
