10.89 12.31 A: [laughter] 

12.16 14.09 B: an interesting question isn't it 

14.35 15.80 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

15.57 22.57 B: [laughter] so wh- what what if you were offered that uh what would be your uh answer 

23.03 24.36 A: (( um [laughter] )) 

24.42 25.22 A: i'd 

25.75 34.87 A: i don't know it's very hard i'd probably say no [laughter] 'cause well you're not allowed to talk to your best friend ever again [laughter] 

29.17 30.02 B: (( you'd prob )) 

30.10 31.08 B: really 

34.49 36.23 B: yeah yeah but 

36.94 40.04 B: i don't know i guess you know a lot of times um 

40.80 46.62 B: you someone that you thought was your best friend wasn't you know [mn] yes 

46.99 49.82 A: that's true i i mean 

49.89 58.06 A: but like everybody makes mistakes like me and my best friend have been into like a million fights but we're still best friends you know [laughter] 

57.23 61.46 B: that's true i mean i guess i think it depends on how long have you 

61.86 65.57 B: (( have you known 'em you know uh how long have you known your best friend )) 

65.69 68.78 A: um since i was like five 

68.50 69.55 B: oh really 

69.42 70.63 A: (( yeah )) 

69.62 73.67 B: oh oh that's yeah that's a best friend yeah 

73.11 75.13 A: yeah [laughter] 

74.39 80.35 B: i i mean that's a long i don't know how old you are now but i assume it's at least fifteen twenty years 

80.50 83.24 A: yeah i'm well i'm eighteen [laughter] 

82.95 86.04 B: ooh [laughter] well that 

84.94 86.51 A: (( how old are you oh )) 

86.49 88.12 B: (( i'm uh thirty one )) 

87.98 89.00 A: (( okay )) 

89.00 93.33 B: yeah but uh yeah i guess you know when i was 

93.68 95.74 B: uh younger um i had a 

96.23 102.75 B: best friend that i considered best friend and you know as we got older it seemed like we ah 

102.83 104.59 B: grew apart 

104.49 105.61 A: mhm 

105.28 107.09 B: especially after college you know 

107.18 111.75 A: yeah i mean we we actually both go to school in boston and like 

112.28 118.11 A: um like the first semester we spoke a lot but i don't see her that much any more but it's still like 

117.07 118.02 B: oh really 

118.20 124.48 A: yeah but i feel like you don't find a lot of people that you could like rely on all the time you know and it's like 

124.88 132.48 A: when you do have people like that i i don't know i don't know if it's worth i mean unless you really need the money like [laughter] 

131.73 134.54 B: [laughter] yes yeah i mean 

134.78 139.24 B: (( i don't know li- i don't know like i guess a )) 

139.32 146.52 B: time factor plays a big role as well if if you had asked me this question like fifteen years ago 

146.86 149.03 B: um i would have definitely said no 

149.04 150.28 A: (( yes yeah )) 

150.17 151.66 B: but now 

151.79 153.85 B: i w- i would definitely say yes 

154.02 155.24 A: [laughter] 

155.01 156.46 B: yeah i mean 

156.80 160.38 B: i mean 'cause it turned out that he he was not my best friend you know what i mean 

160.34 161.36 A: (( yes )) 

161.49 163.52 B: you know but that's now 

163.68 165.16 B: fifteen years ago 

165.34 169.65 B: it would have been totally different so i think time comes into play in 

169.69 174.09 B: at what stage both people are in in their lives you know [mn] 

173.80 175.18 A: yeah i think 

175.23 178.67 A: yeah i think there are a lot of factors that go into it i mean 

179.67 181.27 A: (( like i don't know )) 

181.40 182.98 A: just like with the money like 

183.30 192.84 A: you could do not like whatever you want but like you could do like all the things that you've wanted to do in your life i mean i guess a million dollars isn't that much but you know 

192.95 199.58 A: and i guess [laughter] i don't know [laughter] you know it's like 

197.92 200.88 B: it's a ni- it's a nice start [laughter] 

199.96 203.65 A: it would make uh things like a lot easier i don't know 

202.53 203.31 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

203.92 209.48 B: it's definitely a nice start i think i mean you're a millionaire so 

209.22 209.95 A: (( [laughter] )) 

210.48 216.47 B: i mean i don't know i i just uh i don't know like i said it depends on what time in 

217.32 222.17 B: your life or what you go through like for example i went to school he didn't and 

222.22 223.33 A: (( oh yeah )) 

222.35 226.10 B: that you know that played a big factor in it and it's like 

226.36 227.22 B: (( you know )) 

227.55 231.03 B: we we both changed we went in two different directions 

230.96 232.19 A: right 

231.82 236.96 B: you know so but you and your friend both of you are going to school but i don't know maybe 

237.19 240.75 B: the college experience is different for her than it is for you 

240.77 243.25 A: oh yeah it definitely is 

242.63 244.76 B: yeah what school you go to 

244.91 247.13 A: um boston university

580.81 592.52 A: like like my friend wants to like stay in massachusetts when she graduates and like i want to go to california [laughter] so like in a few years we may not even be talking [laughter] you know like 

587.30 588.19 B: oh really 

591.75 592.55 B: oh 

593.27 598.88 A: so if that was the case like i could definitely see us like growing apart and not talking and

598.71 599.89 B: oh you might get cl-
