2.40 4.08 A: my name is bill how are you 

3.99 5.76 B: fine my name is martha 

5.54 6.63 A: hi martha 

7.14 10.63 B: so what would you do if you could change something back in your time 

10.93 19.55 A: if i could change something back in my time i think it would have been when i was younger my decision not to go to um higher education in college 

19.24 20.32 B: mhm 

19.97 21.44 A: and what about you 

21.62 29.01 B: um i think probably the decision i took to move to hawaii and soon after my dad passed away and i never got to see him 

31.22 32.75 A: are you from hawaii 

32.60 34.47 B: ah no i'm from spain 

34.20 35.69 A: oh you're from spain 

35.36 37.15 B: (( yeah well yeah yeah i'm )) 

37.42 43.87 B: from spain so i was ah in hawaii when that happened and ah the i guess that's what i would change 

43.73 44.83 A: (( [laughter] oh )) 

44.84 46.40 A: was it 

46.84 54.44 A: has that been something that you've carried as far as the thought for all your life i mean has there been a regret 

54.50 60.03 B: um no not really i thought about it now that they say what would you change 

59.89 68.28 A: yeah but is is that's exactly what happened with me it's like um i'd decided that what the decision i'd made in my life was okay 

68.24 78.30 A: um and it came up when the question came up but i sorted thought well you know i can't go back in time to change it so it's something that i just have to exist with 

78.19 80.37 B: mhm what do you do instead 

80.57 92.04 A: um instead i was i was raised in um in chicago and there's a strong um industrial um workforce in chicago not 

92.07 96.78 A: not the intelligentsia n- not the um um 

97.27 99.34 A: college crowd so to speak 

98.88 99.91 B: mhm 

99.30 113.55 A: and so i came from a very blue collar family and the concept was find a good company go to work for them and retire from the company well [laughter] that was you know back in the fifties and the sixties that's the way the world was in america 

107.91 108.92 B: mhm 

113.69 124.67 A: um today we don't live in that world and you you can't find a company to go to work for and retire from and the companies don't take care of the employees the way they used to either 

116.27 117.26 B: mhm 

124.54 125.74 B: yeah that's true 

125.60 135.45 A: so in that regard um i've i regret not going to school to learn more of something more than just blue collar work 

134.87 137.18 B: mhm but you can ah still go to work right 

137.14 146.41 A: yes yeah i mean it's it's something that obviously if it was a mistake that i made it it ah it's something i could i could correct if i chose to 

146.25 147.24 B: mhm 

146.60 150.24 A: which is not in the same as your situation 

150.25 154.13 B: ah yeah [laughter] that's a little harder to change ah but yeah 

152.59 153.40 A: yes 

154.32 159.97 A: so you moved you moved from um you moved from spain to hawaii 

159.53 162.37 B: yes i am a teacher at the university here 

162.52 166.10 B: so i moved here to work at the university of hawaii 

165.90 166.88 A: ah 

166.51 168.11 B: about ten years ago 

168.14 169.68 A: about ten years ago 

169.24 170.24 B: yes 

170.07 178.85 A: th- that's amazing because hawaii is the one place in the world where i'm trying to move to [laughter] yeah i i 

176.49 178.71 B: oh really [laughter] 

178.90 190.63 A: my first trip to hawaii was in nineteen eighty two and i have um y- you know talk about going back in time um that when i stepped off the plane it was like i had 

190.41 201.17 A: arrived home i never had a feeling ever like that and subsequently i've been back um eight or nine trips since then and i just i absolutely 

191.60 192.67 B: uh-huh 

201.41 203.24 A: fall apart when i leave 

203.10 206.14 B: oh well then maybe you belong here [laughter] 

204.67 212.85 A: it it must be yes and and i suppose if i could go back in time maybe because it hurt so much to leave then maybe i should never have gone to hawaii 

211.26 214.37 B: maybe you should have stayed the first time [laughter] 

213.17 214.97 A: [laughter] right 

214.70 218.51 B: [laughter] very good how long do we have to talk on this 

218.26 219.80 A: ah ten minutes 

219.38 222.12 B: ten minutes okay i'm not keeping track are you 

221.81 226.13 A: um yeah it looks like we have about maybe about another five 

225.67 226.57 B: okay 

226.66 232.59 B: well ah what kind of job do what kind of um work do you do what did the are you sure to find something in hawaii 

232.82 245.00 A: um actually no because it um i've spent my entire life working in um um in- industrial ah i was a purchasing agent in the electronics company i was ah 

242.45 243.44 B: mhm 

245.06 247.25 A: um a q._c. manager 

247.36 248.25 B: uh-huh 

247.68 256.65 A: um managing for for quality control and so forth but the problem in in southern california is that all of that industry basically is gone 

256.89 258.09 B: uh-huh 

257.20 264.98 A: and there's very little industry so what mostly supports the economy in in southern california is um 

264.99 273.14 A: ah at least for people who don't have ah a higher education is retail so it's very very much like like hawaii 

269.75 270.78 B: mhm 

272.93 273.87 B: yes 

273.24 275.74 A: um ah being a 

275.98 279.23 A: tourist based industry um 

277.87 280.09 B: mhm service based 

279.54 281.53 A: yeah 

280.28 281.15 B: yep 

281.78 293.07 B: well you can do the same kind of job from here i mean from there here if you open a [laughter] you know a branch of your business or something like that it's hard though i mean to to 

287.86 288.62 A: (( mm )) 

291.77 303.79 A: what what's very what's very difficult is the a- a- of which you would know very well is like when do you pull up the roots that you've had in a place it's very difficult to do that 

299.54 300.50 B: yes 

300.97 301.87 B: yes 

303.20 308.38 B: it is it is you have to be there's a few times in your life when you're in those transition 

304.03 304.96 A: um 

307.99 308.96 A: mhm 

309.04 311.59 B: and that that's the only time to do it that's sure 

312.30 325.71 B: that ah that's hard to do you know to move you know when you have a job and a stable you know family or friends or it is really hard to give up everything and say well you know i'm just moving [laughter] it is hard 

323.93 324.65 A: (( mm )) 

325.84 337.19 A: it seems to m- is my entire life has brought me to the w- ah towards the west um being raised and born in chicago and moving um 

337.12 345.82 A: to california was some of my relatives so we would come out to california and visit them and i always loved california so when i would go back home i'd feel homesick 

345.76 346.76 B: mhm 

345.88 353.34 A: but nothing like the feeling that i have ah ah getting further west being being being in hawaii um 

351.52 360.52 B: it's very interesting because ah a lot of people have that feeling when they come to hawaii people that come to work at u._h. for example the university of hawaii 

360.48 366.49 B: it's either they hate it just the first week when they arrive the say this is not for me 

366.38 377.36 B: or they thoroughly fall in love with it there's no inbetween it's it's very extreme how people feel about the island and it's very interesting i don't think it happens very often anywhere else 

368.61 369.17 A: (( mm )) 

377.25 388.23 B: you know you can like somethings dislike others but here it's it's very extreme it's either you fall in love and you think you know this is where i belong or or it's like i'm out of here this is a rock [laughter]

453.30 454.40 A: um 

454.56 464.41 A: the whole island ah lifestyle of being able to i think the concept of knowing that people are on a rock in the middle of the ocean 

464.40 470.11 A: um there's something along with the aloha spirit that says we have to get along and people do 

469.64 473.34 B: [laughter] yes there's nowhere to run to [laughter] 

470.63 471.73 A: and it
