474.56 475.55 A: (( hm )) 

474.68 477.76 B: to winter them over and um 

478.23 483.31 B: you know so that's that impacts people pretty bad for several years running if you've got to get rid of your

501.61 506.57 B: but you know there's restrictions on pumping there's been restrictions on pumping out of that for a while so 

506.40 507.40 A: huh 

507.23 508.25 B: so 

509.19 513.90 B: ah because that because they had a water law changed and they had the 

514.36 519.62 B: they had to change a lot of that so it's it's a time of change definitely a time of change 

520.28 521.84 B: (( uh [laughter] i )) 

522.13 531.79 B: (( don't know we could use our trip back in time to say for crying out loud stop building so many houses up in [mn] but no one would listen to us no one would listen to us so that wouldn't help i guess ))

531.16 532.21 A: uh-huh 

534.68 535.81 B: (( but uh )) 

536.07 540.80 B: yeah i guess ah if we're we're supposed to kind of stay of topic ah um 

541.23 547.59 B: the only thing i wouldn't really change any major things because you know that would you know then that would affect other things you know 

547.80 560.52 B: like you could say well my first husband was a jerk but you know well yeah but then i would then i still like the kids that i have so i wouldn't want to change them [laughter] you know so ah

573.96 575.12 B: (( but but ah ))

585.77 587.81 B: i think i think stuff like that 

588.65 589.94 B: (( just in general )) 

590.77 594.70 B: (( so that kind of thing you really can't exactly go back and change you know ))
