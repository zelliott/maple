97.33 98.57 A: do you travel quite a bit 

98.75 100.27 A: i mean do you have a long distance when you 

100.48 104.69 B: um the further furtherest i've usually gone is is about seventy miles i 

100.50 101.55 A: do the shopping 

104.83 112.96 B: um did do one um resort that i went we went like about four hundred miles for but um i mean it didn't pay 

110.95 111.69 A: oh wow 

113.29 115.10 B: to go that far but it was 

115.19 122.28 B: a w- you know a weekend away but my husband and i got to go away and so it paid for it the time we were there and um so we went ahead and 

121.41 122.26 A: the food and things 

122.85 127.12 B: you know we did that and that was really fun that's been definitely my my favorite one that i've done yet 

127.85 129.50 A: have you done mostly restaurants and things 

129.69 130.83 B: um restaurants 

130.93 132.94 B: i've done um stores i mean 

133.10 134.82 B: different um retail stores 

135.33 139.16 B: and um fast food the stuff that nobody seems to like but 

139.29 142.31 B: um there is a lot of it out there so that is why i end up doing that and 

142.92 143.77 B: and um 

144.83 145.87 B: so i've um 

146.41 148.30 B: been doing that so you just got signed up you say 

148.40 150.92 A: uh-huh i haven't actually like registered 

151.43 155.90 A: there is like a hundred and twenty different com- companies did you actually do that 

154.45 156.62 B: right on on that particular site i've 

156.78 158.66 B: i probably registered about a hundred and sixty 

158.79 160.01 A: oh you did 

159.17 159.60 B: -cause i've 

159.75 160.24 B: uh-huh 

160.63 168.34 B: and i had done registered for a lot of them before i ever found um the money and shopping dot com so i know that there are some on there that i have not registered at yet but um 

168.44 173.04 B: i haven't really g- sat down and gone through -em to figure out which ones i need to continue to you know still do 

173.12 173.68 A: uh-huh 

173.78 174.65 B: but um 

175.11 178.61 B: i've probably i guess i have figure about twenty five companies i've worked for 

178.71 181.48 B: you know so doing just some of -em only once 

182.23 184.66 B: but um you know that is kind of how 

184.78 187.04 B: and then some of them i have done you know repeatedly so 

188.02 188.98 B: you know and just (( )) 

188.28 190.39 A: so once you get in the foot your foot in the door then 

190.48 191.84 B: right so where are you from 

191.94 193.56 A: um columbus ohio 

193.69 199.79 B: okay -cause i'm from um southeast ohio which is uh i mean there's no towns close by me i mean you know the 

199.95 204.89 B: the our city is is like fifty miles and that's definitely um you know where i've done most of them have been there 

204.27 205.60 A: so you are traveling no matter what 

205.77 206.24 B: right 

206.73 207.15 B: right 

207.58 210.09 B: um there's n- you know not anything really close by 

211.61 211.93 B: so 

213.07 214.99 B: you know i'm i'm sure people in the bigger cities 

215.11 216.87 B: you know it is much easier when you hear 

217.59 218.86 B: read about them that are doing 

219.02 219.43 B: you know 

219.70 221.46 B: uh numerous numerous shops a day and 

221.90 222.44 A: uh-huh 

221.96 224.92 B: and um i think the most i've ever done in a day is maybe four 

225.30 225.95 A: oh wow 

226.29 227.54 B: so um you know 

227.70 229.62 B: but to go very far you have to do 

229.86 231.86 B: several to make it worthwhile or it is not worth going 

231.95 232.35 B: you know 

231.97 232.76 A: mhm 

232.86 234.01 B: very far (( for us )) so 

234.51 235.09 A: well that is 

235.27 242.74 A: i the ones i registered for they are (( appro- )) fifty miles away just like one like for five dollars and i'm thinking well i'm not sure if that is 

240.38 240.85 B: right 

241.06 242.11 B: well that is really worth it 

242.22 244.39 B: you know you 

242.83 246.02 A: especially with the gas prices so high 

245.63 247.17 B: i know exactly 

248.04 248.48 A: so 

249.09 254.22 B: anyway i assume we are being taped on this call i mean it is like i'm wondering what they are 

252.99 258.13 A: i'm not sure if we are going to uh say i mean we can talk about the hypothetical situation 

258.36 260.47 B: yeah 

259.97 263.44 A: we could make it interesting and say yes we would take the million dollars 

263.33 265.56 B: yeah i guess we could 

265.27 268.36 A: and you can just tell your best friend to change her name and things 

265.70 266.39 B: oh 

268.17 270.13 B: well nah 

270.88 271.45 B: uh 

272.03 273.03 B: i don't know i mean 

273.18 277.40 B: sounds money sounds good but yet i'm not sure i'd be any happier then you know 

278.48 281.25 A: yeah it is -cause uh it probably brings a lot of problems too 

280.93 281.72 B: oh i know 

284.65 287.70 A: but a million dollars you make be able to hide from anyone that 

287.45 288.39 B: yeah 

287.95 289.55 A: so they wouldn't know 

290.20 291.33 A: just live off the interest 

290.28 290.93 B: uh 

291.86 292.36 B: i guess 

295.25 298.04 A: are you a stay at home mom or just want some extra money 

296.87 298.05 B: um actually 

298.19 298.74 B: i it's 

298.89 303.12 B: for some extra i um am a church secretary so i work three days doing that and 

303.55 305.88 B: and this is just for some extra stuff that i'm doing 

306.88 309.93 A: and some fun things to do um 

307.16 307.42 B: so 

307.58 308.09 B: how about you 

309.27 309.76 B: yeah 

310.78 313.18 A: today was my actually last day at work so 

313.27 314.14 B: oh okay 

314.03 316.57 A: i decided to be a stay at home mom 

316.64 317.25 B: oh that is neat 

317.57 318.35 B: so how old are your kids 

318.58 321.00 A: um i three a month old and then a two year old 

321.41 326.65 B: oh wow oh that's it's really neat to be home i was home when my kids were young too so i right now have 

326.75 329.15 B: three teenage boys thirteen fifteen and eighteen so 

329.56 330.41 B: um i 

330.68 335.14 B: have been working for several years now but when they were really little i was at home and it is it's 

335.29 336.63 B: really neat to be able to be home with them 

335.99 337.21 A: and it is best 

337.32 337.85 B: definitely 

337.99 341.11 A: i said i can always go back to work i can't make up their 

341.20 341.79 B: that is right 

341.78 342.94 A: little baby years 

343.10 343.73 B: that is right 

344.03 344.34 A: so 

347.42 350.28 A: being with uh the state of everything that's going on is like i think 

351.52 356.20 A: wanted to stay home and close by so i work like forty five miles away 

352.78 353.30 B: mhm 

353.89 354.42 B: mhm 

356.39 357.13 B: oh yeah 

361.21 364.97 B: i assume they would come back on after awhile on this thing i don't know what is happening 

364.77 368.22 A: i think they said you have to talk for ten minutes and then 

368.33 371.76 A: they would come hopefully it would beep or something 

371.90 374.08 B: oh i see okay i didn't read that part i guess 

374.20 374.75 A: yeah it's 

375.20 375.86 B: okay 

375.36 377.26 A: a ten minute minute conversation 

377.51 379.28 B: a ten minute conversation okay 

380.12 383.10 A: but i didn't read if they were supposed to if you are supposed to talk about the 

380.22 380.80 B: so long 

383.30 383.98 A: subject 

384.10 384.72 B: right 

384.58 385.42 A: the entire time 

385.90 386.49 B: okay 

387.36 387.61 A: -cause 

387.49 388.12 B: so um 

389.80 391.76 A: i wouldn't think so because i don't know what else to 

391.92 394.74 B: i know i'm not sure um 

395.00 395.43 B: you know 

396.20 396.80 B: you're um 

397.20 399.83 B: i guess we could start by who would who you would consider to be your best friend 

401.59 402.66 A: well it 

402.99 405.93 A: really it has changed since since i've had children -cause my 

406.35 408.72 A: best friend from many many years ago 

409.23 410.09 A: she is single 

410.83 412.19 A: and she has no children so 

412.34 415.05 A: a lot of things that we used to do 

415.04 415.55 B: uh-huh 

415.87 417.20 A: we don't do anymore 

418.37 418.71 A: so 

419.21 421.19 A: i found a friend that has she just 

421.66 423.20 A: she had her first child 

424.60 425.39 A: six months ago 

426.52 429.83 A: and we became re-acquainted we didn't talk for like two or three years 

430.17 430.68 B: uh-huh 

430.83 431.13 A: but 

432.94 435.39 A: we've started doing things -cause she is a stay at home mom now 

436.69 437.63 A: that is different 

436.89 437.21 B: (( )) 

437.78 438.20 B: yeah 

438.87 439.82 B: well and that way i mean you could if 

439.93 443.31 B: you know you have a lot more in common too now if you both have kids and and stuff 

441.44 442.05 A: uh-huh 

443.42 443.69 B: so 

445.86 447.02 A: and who is your best friend 

447.39 450.47 B: well i would have to say my husband i definitely um 

451.33 456.66 B: as far as anybody to spend time with he is who i want to be with and so i probably would have to say that um 

456.90 457.90 B: he is my best friend 

457.84 461.37 A: well i guess yeah a million dollars isn't worth it giving up your husband 

458.11 458.69 B: and (( just )) 

459.92 463.24 B: no it it definitely wouldn't be 

463.43 463.77 B: so 

463.98 464.59 B: uh yeah 

465.12 466.21 B: no he um 

467.43 467.83 B: um 

470.20 472.29 B: there is probably time i mean i know there's times 

472.48 475.85 B: in my life i didn't feel like he was best friend so it is kind of nice that now i do 

477.32 481.20 A: i guess if you said your husband was your best friend and you were getting a divorce maybe that would be a good thing 

481.32 482.60 B: yeah 

481.62 482.98 A: but go ahead and give me the million dollars 

483.09 485.78 B: oh maybe 

485.98 486.70 B: but um 

487.09 487.70 B: i don't know 

488.46 491.33 B: i don't know we've been married twenty five years and uh 

491.92 492.18 B: have 

492.86 494.64 B: like i said weathered through a lot of things and 

495.25 496.07 B: and uh 

496.19 499.55 B: so it's been really good right now so that is how i'll keep it 

499.73 500.86 A: the next twenty five at least 

500.88 501.88 B: for the next twenty five right 

502.77 504.92 A: probably uh with the kids growing up 

505.63 506.47 A: in the last 

506.85 509.01 A: fifteen years were probably the most difficult 

509.16 510.98 B: uh-huh really 

511.13 511.82 B: but uh 

512.72 513.12 B: yeah 

514.18 517.60 B: except for we i don't know we had (( some )) at the very beginning um it seemed like we had 

518.24 519.52 B: pretty rough years so
