42.87 48.15 B: [sigh] if i could go back and change a part of my life 

48.67 50.63 B: (( i think ))

75.92 78.84 B: (( [laughter] )) 

78.86 81.49 B: well because i want i 

82.04 88.15 B: i should have gone into gemology which is re- researching gemstones and 

84.43 85.60 A: uh-huh

95.26 96.37 B: [laughter] 

96.39 106.43 B: [laughter] that's that's one thing i don't know if i would change it but it was it's something that i've thought of before so 

105.63 108.48 A: well yeah that's true 

108.71 110.64 A: that's true i um 

112.98 115.06 A: went to nursing school 

115.04 116.79 B: oh yeah 

116.12 119.96 A: and i possibly would change that 

120.36 123.47 B: what do you think you would have rather studied 

123.37 124.53 A: (( um )) 

125.39 130.06 A: i really don't well i really should've studied accounting that's what i do 

129.83 132.41 B: you know i do accounting also 

132.55 134.25 B: isn't that funny 

133.45 136.60 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] right that is strange )) 

136.01 138.66 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

137.62 141.79 A: that's what i should've studied but that's not what i did so 

142.11 150.17 B: it think it's kind of funny that you know what e- every [mn] you know no matter what you study it still all comes down to the numbers doesn't it 

144.13 145.23 A: it's kind of 

149.78 151.34 A: (( oh yeah )) 

150.97 153.57 B: (( [laughter] )) 

152.35 155.94 A: 'cause if if the numbers don't work nothing else does 

155.34 160.07 B: that's right that's right and so we feel at our company 

157.57 158.50 A: yeah 

160.20 164.19 B: so ah you do accounting now were you ever a nurse 

164.09 164.87 A: no

170.60 172.10 B: oh i see 

172.22 176.18 A: but i think i would have been better off had i gone to 

176.81 179.79 A: into a different field rather than nursing 

180.00 181.41 B: okay 

181.98 190.20 B: that's got to be a lot harder than than it looks i'm sure a lot of people go into it thinking it's one thing and then realising that it's another 

189.80 191.86 A: it's a lot of hard work a 

191.25 192.47 B: yeah 

191.90 193.62 A: lot of hard work 

193.06 195.29 B: (( you've got to pay your dues )) 

193.79 195.91 A: but actually um 

196.09 201.89 A: but at the main reas- i was much more interested in getting married than i was in finishing school 

201.45 202.97 B: [laughter] 

202.13 205.27 A: and at the time that i 

205.61 209.38 A: got married you could not be married 

209.56 212.56 A: and be in nurses training

213.32 214.43 A: right 

213.91 215.89 B: oh gosh [laughter]

222.95 226.60 B: oh that's so wonderful congratulations 

224.61 228.24 A: [laughter] that was not a bad choice 

227.73 229.77 B: no no 

228.50 230.87 A: in fact that was a very good choice 

230.31 236.96 B: yeah you you made a real life time decision there yeah oh that's wonderful 

233.32 240.62 A: right right but but had i chosen to study accounting i could have a degree 

240.79 243.95 A: (( [laughter] )) 

242.11 243.34 B: [laughter]
