31.19 32.39 B: (( [laughter] )) 

34.98 35.99 A: um 

37.24 45.44 A: i think there's a lot of things that i would like to go back and change but then i don't know um i think that they kind of make you who you are so 

46.24 49.69 B: see anytime that i've thought about that i ah 

50.33 52.26 B: i've always gone back to the well 

53.24 54.99 B: [noise]

58.46 59.39 A: uh-huh 

59.81 61.70 B: you go back and you change something 

62.25 63.97 B: and it changes everything else 

63.73 64.80 A: right 

65.31 70.62 B: so then you go with the okay so if i went back and changed something that i did ten years ago 

73.55 76.00 B: it doesn't necessarily mean things would be any 

76.12 77.34 B: better than they 

78.60 79.59 A: right 

78.90 80.21 B: than they are now 

80.04 87.67 A: right right they could be worse [laughter] right that's what i kind of think so go ahead i'm sorry 

81.78 82.94 B: exactly 

84.93 86.16 B: you know you could have 

87.59 93.26 B: oh i [mn] was going to say that that you know you can think that you know oh this would be so much better if i had done this 

94.36 97.91 B: and you don't necessarily know that 

98.15 99.33 A: right 

101.13 103.56 A: that's i agree with that [laughter] 

105.20 106.33 B: i mean like 

106.61 110.08 B: okay i'm divorced so [noise] 

110.58 111.50 B: you know 

111.56 113.56 B: very tempting sometimes to say 

113.84 114.76 B: you know 

114.80 117.00 B: it would have been better if i'd never gotten married 

117.27 119.19 A: right do you have kids though 

119.40 120.18 B: i do 

121.38 123.09 B: um although 

121.38 124.93 A: so so then you wouldn't have kids [laughter] 

124.68 125.73 B: um 

126.30 129.65 B: well i should that's another thing i actually had her before 

130.15 138.13 B: before i got married but so it's like okay well sh- y- you know there was some debate as to whether or not i should actually attempt the single parent thing you know 

139.19 144.03 B: [noise] some of my family thought i should ah you know like go for adoption or something 

145.06 148.85 B: but my life would be totally different than what it is now 

149.43 158.39 A: right right i i'm actually in a exact same situation it's funny that they said ten years ago because ten years ago i got married and um 

158.35 164.96 A: i you know i got divorced and stuff and i i wonder about that but i can't imagine 

165.02 166.87 A: what i would be doing or 

166.93 167.91 A: what my life 

167.23 168.94 B: do you also have kids 

168.78 169.84 A: what's that 

169.71 171.94 B: do you also have children or 

171.35 177.65 A: yes yes i have one um one from that marriage and then i am remarried so i have another 

179.90 180.92 B: (( yeah see i )) 

181.61 183.96 B: it it's so hard to to say 

184.45 185.52 B: well 

187.44 190.06 B: you know things would be better i mean like 

190.76 194.07 B: well and and there are little specific things 

194.10 195.82 B: when i was pregnant 

196.48 201.06 B: you know i got lots of oh you shouldn't have gotten pregnant kind of things 

200.10 201.29 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

201.57 204.67 B: of course because well you know it happens 

204.71 208.75 B: but at my pre natal appointment my fir- very first one 

209.27 215.18 B: they discovered an ovarian cyst that was not causing any pain 

212.50 213.31 A: oh 

215.63 218.40 B: so i never would have like gone in for it or anything 

218.68 219.67 A: (( oh )) 

218.86 225.47 B: and when they found it it was already so i mean it i was measuring at thirty two weeks pregnant when i was ten weeks pregnant 

225.24 226.49 A: wow 

226.47 228.93 B: um and so 

231.14 236.36 B: they were saying you know if i if i hadn't gotten pregnant i may very well have died from it 

231.14 232.02 A: you might 

236.21 237.37 A: right 

237.43 243.38 B: so you know you can go back and say that something was a mistake something would be different 

243.99 246.36 B: but [laughter] 

246.48 248.77 B: you you don't know why 

249.48 251.13 B: it happened 

250.55 253.80 A: right well i think that everything happens for a reason 

254.12 257.64 A: and um even like if you can't see it you know 

258.04 259.32 A: that um 

259.79 262.73 A: something eventually comes good out of it i think 

263.30 264.71 B: (( [noise] right )) 

264.70 274.30 A: but yeah i could say gee i wish i would have not married and ah done what i was doing and life would be great except that it might not be [laughter] 

275.52 276.51 B: right 

277.44 281.26 A: i might have um finished college and ah [laughter] 

277.60 278.46 B: ah 

281.94 292.12 A: had had a job i stay at home now so um occasionally i get those you know i don't do anything i'm not worth anything days you know

307.56 312.26 B: about that reflection time you know to to look back and say okay you know 

312.87 314.13 B: (( [sigh] )) 

314.37 318.99 B: it's taken me eight years to get another semester's worth of college done it would 

318.00 319.65 A: [laughter] 

319.32 320.62 B: (( have )) 

320.76 323.30 B: taken me another year to graduate if i hadn't 

323.85 324.96 B: chosen 

325.22 326.27 A: (( right right )) 

325.23 327.08 B: what what i did choose 

327.36 328.59 B: but 

328.99 330.71 B: (( you know how do you ah )) 

332.19 339.74 B: if you had some sort of like little time machine sort of deal that you could go in and you know input 

339.98 342.44 B: okay let's 

342.45 346.76 B: see what would happen you know if if i changed this here 

346.85 348.25 B: show me the future 

348.00 349.67 A: right [laughter] 

348.38 355.59 B: you know or or show the present based on that you know if you could do that then going back and changing things could be cool 

355.75 356.86 A: right 

356.15 365.98 B: because then you could you know go back and play with well what if i'd done this ooh no don't like that result okay well what if i'd done this oh that looks good

367.81 369.26 A: i know 

369.52 375.29 A: i a- i agree with that because i um i feel the same way you know 

375.41 376.55 A: that 

377.24 387.00 A: um maybe i would have my degree and i would be making a lot of money and i would be somewhere but you know would i be totally lonely and you know or 

387.16 388.09 B: right 

388.40 390.10 B: um you know or

410.27 413.22 A: yeah well and i was um 

413.33 417.84 A: i was actually sixteen when i got married because i had graduated out of high school early 

418.23 419.20 A: and so 

419.55 424.17 A: that was obviously a really bad choice that i can see in hindsight but um 

424.83 428.63 A: at the same time it made me grow up really fast [laughter] 

428.85 436.77 B: right well and i mean that's the same kind of thing um i mean i say yeah deciding at the age of twenty 

436.94 438.11 B: to

447.60 450.14 B: had some major financial issues and everything and 

450.57 454.89 B: i know that a lot of the reason i made the choice that i did is because 

455.01 458.04 B: she was born at the end of march and my mom died march first 

457.77 459.04 A: oh 

458.32 459.68 B: so i just wasn't 

460.93 463.34 B: i i was too emotionally f- 

463.74 465.78 B: falling apart already to 

466.50 469.45 B: voluntarily make it even worse 

469.70 471.03 A: right 

470.37 472.53 B: (( but on the other hand )) 

473.29 474.64 B: um 

475.40 476.85 B: i also know that 

477.57 478.87 B: it was my 

479.72 481.58 B: third year in college 

481.92 483.99 B: but i was still 

484.49 488.52 B: oh i don't know half way through my sophomore year credit wise 

488.34 489.77 A: oh yeah 

489.17 491.92 B: you know i just i didn't have 

492.01 494.35 B: i had no self discipline and 

495.06 496.90 B: no real clear 

497.04 501.13 B: goal or vision of what i wanted to do or where i wanted to go with it 

502.02 506.07 B: so i was just kind of doing the well i graduated from high school

541.93 543.04 A: to grow up 

542.13 545.93 B: do whatever it is [mn] that that yeah um 

544.22 545.28 A: [laughter] 

546.69 554.17 A: i i hear you i went through the same thing and you know sometimes yeah i'd love to go back and change those but 

555.12 556.19 A: you know i 

556.43 563.80 A: i think that i'm a better person i think i would have been ah maybe more of a spoiled brat type person if i hadn't [laughter]
