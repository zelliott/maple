142.19 143.07 A: (( right it's )) 

143.89 147.78 A: yeah it's mine too they keep trying but i haven't ever been here 

147.39 152.17 B: [laughter] oh yes me too [laughter] and then my password was wrong 

148.45 151.06 A: [laughter] well 

151.94 156.60 A: yeah i did that too yesterday when they called i i did the wrong pin number 

156.20 160.69 B: yeah but they gave me the wrong pin i kept punching it in so i called back 

158.24 159.25 A: oh 

161.01 163.79 B: um they had me registered twice 

163.66 165.01 A: oh okay 

164.45 171.69 B: okay but anyway let's see best friend you know my best friend isn't here anyway 

166.09 167.43 A: yeah we're just 

167.68 168.87 A: yeah 

171.77 174.28 B: and you know i don't talk to her 

175.16 182.77 B: as often i mean we know we're there for each other mates even if even if we don't ever talk you know i 

178.34 179.31 A: right 

183.16 192.64 B: mean and we went a long time over a year without um even writing but i knew she was still my best friend you 

187.89 189.22 A: right 

191.62 198.56 A: yeah yeah there's a woman that i guess i would consider her my best friend and she's she lives in washington 

198.96 201.67 A: so i haven't seen her in years 

201.90 207.90 A: and every now and then we'll go a very very long time you know without uh emailing or anything 

207.63 214.32 B: know but i think that if they were a good enough friend they would understand a million dollars 

213.27 215.94 A: yeah you could always go find another friend 

215.39 226.36 B: well but even that i mean if they're your best friend i mean i think if it was me if it was somebody my best friend and they couldn't talk to me 

226.37 230.71 B: because they a million dollars and not talk to me i would understand 

226.49 227.68 A: mhm 

231.51 234.14 B: you know and i would feel happy for them for her 

233.97 237.08 A: right especially if she sent some money 

234.81 235.74 B: (( you know )) 

237.13 238.76 B: yeah [laughter] 

237.55 240.05 A: [laughter] 

240.57 243.97 B: but if you never if you could never talk to 'em again 

244.87 246.63 B: um i just i um 

247.06 253.61 B: you know i don't think i'm shallow either i mean i just don't think that's shallow i think that a friend understands i mean 

248.75 250.54 A: yeah 

253.64 255.69 B: stipulations like that 

255.44 261.19 A: well i think in my case i just don't really have you know incredibly close friends i have 

260.22 262.49 B: right i don't think any of us do 

262.14 263.39 A: yeah 

262.77 269.44 B: you know we're in a the environ- a different environment now i mean the wor- uh do you work 

266.48 268.10 A: oh yeah 

269.60 272.00 A: um i'm unemployed right now 

272.29 274.94 B: okay are are you usually a worker 

274.58 275.62 A: yes 

275.35 279.89 B: okay see w- and so am i i mean i've worked for 

280.05 283.37 B: twenty eight years and then i got sick 

280.90 282.07 A: yeah 

283.39 287.64 B: and i've been home nine months now but i still don't 

287.88 294.27 B: you know i i still don't take you know go out with people and you know it's it's just 

292.62 293.73 A: yeah 

294.09 306.93 A: me neither in fact one of the things when i lost my job one of the one of the biggest problems was that the majority of people in my life that i talked to and you know felt close to were people that i worked with 

306.87 308.66 B: exactly me too 

307.64 316.43 A: and now that i wasn't going to work i never saw them any more and you know with very very rare exception never heard from them again 

316.14 317.59 B: exactly 

317.05 323.15 A: and which is kinda worse 'cause then you really feel cut off you not only don't have a job you don't have all of your friends either 

322.82 333.24 B: but i think the word friend has changed since our gener- in our generation the baby boomers because our families v- [noise] 

328.72 330.03 A: right 

330.83 332.62 A: well yeah 

334.95 339.89 B: our fa- our parents' best friends you know and then my mother never worked 

340.02 341.01 A: mhm 

340.16 345.94 B: and my dad you know they actually he was in the army so his friends were in the army too 

345.90 347.26 A: right 

346.79 351.96 B: but [sigh] um i just you know i think that we're all mature enough to 

352.50 357.38 B: understand that now maybe when we get in our seventies or eighties we might say different 

357.16 363.17 A: yeah well and there are those people too who have a friend they grew up with and 

363.18 366.85 A: you know stayed close to through high school and college and 

367.05 369.91 A: but uh i don't know that's just not me 

371.22 374.93 B: well my friend is one i grew up with but we 

373.61 374.85 A: mhm 

376.07 379.83 B: we moved um we- i was in augusta georgia 

379.55 380.55 A: mhm 

379.87 384.43 B: and that's where i grew up and then when i was thirteen we moved to charleston south carolina 

384.82 390.24 B: and you know she is still i mean i haven't i haven't seen her but 

390.87 393.61 B: once since thirteen 

393.86 397.25 B: [laughter] i mean we haven't written each other in 

394.28 395.33 A: yeah 

397.58 403.96 B: over a year but if anybody said who's your best friend i would have to say her 

403.84 408.17 A: yep well then you wouldn't have it too tough [laughter] 

407.53 409.27 B: where where did you work 

409.28 411.93 A: i worked for fox television 

411.31 412.19 B: oh wow

417.86 418.91 A: um 

418.10 420.72 B: well i was just an old secretary [laughter] 

419.95 426.27 A: yeah unfortunately since there's not a lot of t._v. jobs i'm looking for an old secretary job right now but 

426.57 431.47 A: and it's it's hard because well in the first place there aren't a lot of 'em 

431.50 436.50 A: but it just seems so incredibly boring to me to be working for you know just 

436.61 441.20 A: a company that makes widgets and you do paperwork and stuff 

440.09 441.20 B: right 

441.39 442.15 A: and 

441.43 443.49 B: well and that's kinda your

449.88 453.07 B: we're my husband and i are both part of a base closure 

453.28 455.15 B: um in charleston 

454.70 455.64 A: uh-huh 

455.18 456.41 B: and 

456.70 466.43 B: um they just basically closed down and said everybody go wherever you could and with so many years' service we were both at twenty five years he had to um 

461.55 462.34 A: (( ooh )) 

466.75 469.07 B: find the closest base 

469.36 472.46 B: to charleston to be able to keep his job 

472.29 473.43 A: uh-huh 

472.68 474.29 B: and that was here

480.12 481.40 B: in charleston 

481.24 482.39 A: mhm 

481.45 485.15 B: at this navy base and i loved it [laughter] 

485.31 494.89 B: it was and i'd pr- finally worked my way up out of the secretarial field you know and proven myself to get this really good job 

495.44 499.27 B: and [sigh] then [laughter] finally we took a cut 

499.53 504.17 B: and they closed us down so that happened and then i had to 

501.57 502.51 A: yeah 

505.49 510.55 B: um find anything you know which meant going back to being a secretary 

508.00 509.17 A: (( yep )) 

510.53 511.69 A: (( oh it's )) 

510.69 517.53 B: and the closest thing i could find was in jacksonville florida and w- and that's about an hour from
