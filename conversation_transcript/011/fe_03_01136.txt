41.62 42.93 A: yes 

46.02 47.16 B: um 

50.05 51.61 B: i think 

52.51 64.15 B: th- the thing that i would change most that i would be would have been more serious in college when i got to college i was just like so excited to be away from home i didn't know what to do so [laughter] so um 

61.19 65.17 A: oh yeah [laughter] i know how that is 

64.55 68.56 B: you know um so i went 

65.29 66.38 A: mhm 

68.94 73.75 B: i went to michigan university of michigan which is a real big party school i think 

74.04 80.05 B: there should have been a major for that but um i [laughter] i would have um 

75.50 77.78 A: oh [laughter] 

80.96 90.55 B: you know gotten more serious like in my freshman and sophomore year and and gotten a l- little bit more focused but i was like a really sheltered child anyway so 

89.61 90.65 A: yeah 

90.87 101.76 B: i don't think it would have done any good i was just so excited to about being away form home so um i i think that's what i would concentrate on and and and change

95.26 96.59 A: yeah 

101.15 110.96 A: yeah yeah i can understand that myself actually [laughter] yeah i think though that a- you know for me i think it would be um

111.73 116.65 A: i don't know i i you know how they say love is blind right [laughter] 

115.31 116.25 B: (( mhm )) 

116.64 117.78 B: right 

116.94 130.49 A: i mean not that i've not been ah 'cause i've been married for quite a long time and i've got my kids my they're teenagers now and i wouldn't do you know take them give them away for anything in the world but i think i would you know 

120.87 121.70 B: uh-huh 

127.89 128.97 B: mhm 

130.65 131.82 B: [laughter] 

131.01 136.44 A: [laughter] if given another chance to go back and if i knew i'd have the kids i have now 

135.98 137.00 B: mhm 

136.42 144.08 A: i think i would have ha- waited for a different guy [laughter] isn't that awful that's bad to say but it's true 

139.96 141.88 B: (( would ya okay )) 

142.78 144.08 B: no not really 

144.04 157.96 A: you know my husband and i i mean we we i mean we get along at times and at times it's really bad and then you know like my mum will tell me you know a- a- a lot of wh- like what you were saying about college she said that

170.64 179.79 A: step back out of the situation you know [noise] it's very it's very possible [laughter] you know as much as you don't want to have to admit it and i think 

178.48 184.85 B: right and i agree with that too because i'm i'm remarried and as soon as i got out of college and went back home and then 

179.86 180.80 A: you know

218.22 219.20 B: mhm 

219.17 227.28 A: you know because i told her one time you know when i was younger um yeah before graduating highschool i said you know i i really don't want to be lonely

245.99 249.74 B: right you can be lonely in a crowd full of people you know 

249.49 260.29 A: yeah but i mean you never can a- a- i don't know you kinda wish that you could just take one day and just jump ahead you know just to see what it would be like years from then 

256.20 257.43 B: mhm 

259.83 263.41 B: first evolve type of thing yeah i know i know

402.94 404.76 B: right right right 

403.92 414.64 A: it's not like they're beating down on my door or anything like that and you know how it is you just get so used to certain things and that's the way you so it's easy for you to keep in that 

407.06 408.66 B: exact- oh 

414.36 415.88 B: exactly 

415.17 416.66 A: in that mode

441.94 443.37 B: right you know 

442.95 444.03 A: outlook 

443.67 453.60 B: it's it would just be a tweak you know not a life changing hundred and eighty degree turn or anything like that just you know a little nudge here a nudge there 

446.20 447.25 A: yes 

452.86 462.43 A: yeah or or who knows you know like you said maybe i you know i would have been the same person but maybe you know i would be able to get him to be a little bit different 

462.44 463.48 B: mhm 

462.62 467.20 A: you know behaviour wise and and and you know that kind of thing who knows 

463.78 464.84 B: exactly 

466.34 467.32 B: mhm 

467.21 471.10 A: if i could go back and change maybe i'd change him [laughter] 

469.58 474.15 B: [laughter] we should all be given magic wands you know 

473.49 477.49 A: (( oh lord yes wouldn't that be great [laughter] )) 

474.28 480.45 B: [laughter] just a little tap there and everything and little sparkle dust everything will be fine
