131.73 134.71 A: a matter of fact i dedicated a ga- a pool game to him 

132.00 132.44 B: (( )) 

134.73 145.65 B: oh wow um well i'm sure he would've been he would've been very interested to have you on his show and and to use the pool table to to show kids about the you know the principles of motion and such 

145.17 145.81 A: uh-huh 

146.21 153.86 B: but at any rate i i was a little kid when that show first came on and i remember watching it and 

161.09 165.02 B: you know he was easy to make fun of um you know the ultra slow 

165.14 171.93 B: speech patterns and you know he he sort of never lost his cool and you know he never tried to be cool 

170.18 170.94 A: right 

171.05 172.95 A: yeah um the study was on valium 

173.00 178.72 B: yeah you know and he never tried to be cool or hip or with it uh i mean how many people even 

179.20 183.64 B: nowadays dress up at the office to the extent that they need to you know take off the jacket 

183.74 185.89 B: put on the cardigan when they get home these days

190.75 191.21 B: uh-huh

212.05 213.91 A: i know i know 

222.44 222.85 B: not 

222.96 225.11 B: full of commercial messages 

225.23 236.93 B: or too much stimulation or trying to make him grow up and act hip and with it you know i mean they they they have this thing i've heard about telemarketers call it getting older younger

237.43 239.48 B: um the the you know

287.16 287.79 A: uh-huh 

287.50 292.17 B: and so i thought oh okay well plenty of time then and then he like died two months later 

292.81 298.56 B: and it just it gave me such a pang you know all the more you know like with your parents 

298.69 299.38 B: that 

299.48 302.74 A: that made the loss it just made the loss even more 

299.56 300.55 B: you want to
