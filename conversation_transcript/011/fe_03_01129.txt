179.02 179.40 B: jeeze 

179.76 180.19 B: um 

181.16 181.97 A: well i guess we should

183.35 185.44 B: really you don't even have kids yet 

183.82 184.37 A: yeah 

185.47 187.73 A: no 

186.18 187.01 B: oh man 

187.49 189.07 B: you are missing out a little bit 

189.49 190.53 A: well 

190.71 191.34 B: you're not ready 

192.53 194.81 A: hm actually i hadn't 

195.00 200.70 A: put much thought into it i know it's a lot of responsibility and i guess it's the 

196.86 197.80 B: really 

200.14 201.00 B: is it your career 

201.80 203.88 A: no no um 

204.19 205.31 A: well i'm not married 

205.38 206.02 B: oh 

205.40 205.85 A: um 

206.44 206.97 B: well you 

207.15 209.39 B: you don't have to be married these days 

207.17 208.18 A: and i'm not a- 

209.00 211.96 A: yeah i'm i'm not in a relationship either 

213.04 215.11 B: yeah i guess that would put a lot on it 

216.05 220.33 A: yeah so i i guess it's just timing you know some people have kids late and 

219.99 221.07 B: oh 

221.43 221.86 B: yeah 

221.56 223.19 A: so i'm i'm just not 

224.36 225.77 A: there at that place yet 

225.95 226.93 B: i hear that 

228.33 229.29 B: well 

229.57 232.83 B: i w- i w- wish i could say i'd be in i wish i could be in your shoes but 

233.09 234.87 B: i know what i'm i'd be missing 

235.93 238.08 B: my children are a handful but 

238.20 240.97 B: i wouldn't change i mean i would ch- i would change probably the 

241.21 242.65 B: the timing of everything 

243.01 243.51 A: yeah 

243.45 246.60 B: cause now i'm having to go back and do the school thing and 

247.67 248.09 B: with 

248.26 250.28 B: with children money's real tight 

250.43 253.03 B: cause that wasn't secure when it happens so 

253.36 254.87 B: a lot of things could have been different 

255.92 256.90 A: yeah well i 

257.38 259.44 A: i got to assume that there's some kind of 

260.30 262.04 A: gratification in it i mean 

262.40 263.03 A: um you 

263.47 265.96 A: you kind of get to experience something with your kids that 

266.09 274.35 A: that i didn't experience with my parents i mean my father was in the air force and my mother was a homemaker up until they got divorced you know and 

274.03 274.59 B: wow 

274.56 277.36 A: she always wanted to go back to school but she never did 

277.76 280.82 A: and it i mean you know you making that effort so 

280.98 283.42 A: you're kind of teaching your kids a lot you know 

284.07 288.19 B: yeah well i'm no perfect no means but i do try 

292.48 295.83 A: to raise me and my brother by her- by herself you know 

295.80 298.19 B: yeah especially when there's only one home 

296.22 297.24 A: for the most part 

298.08 300.24 A: yeah exactly you know and 

299.98 300.33 B: yeah 

300.80 303.10 A: i just learned so much from her i mean we're 

303.25 307.83 A: our relationship is so strong so it's it's got to be some benefit yeah 

306.48 307.22 B: really 

307.97 308.39 A: yeah 

308.00 312.08 B: i'm i'm backwards i used to be really tight with my father and couldn't stand my mother 

313.98 314.60 B: yeah 

314.99 322.00 B: i (( )) i don't know but i have seen women um get along with mothers like they're best friends and i'm like how do you do that 

322.11 324.30 B: i just i couldn't imagine myself doing that 

324.33 327.31 A: well i guess it's because we're we're very different 

327.55 332.67 A: and we respect each other for our differences you know she's kind of 

332.01 333.27 B: you overlook the differences 

333.35 335.05 A: yeah you know she's kind of tom- 

334.52 335.46 B: you don't harp over them 

342.76 347.71 A: when i was younger she used to be very feminine very pretty you know very lacy frilly type 

347.94 351.30 A: woman you know and now she's more tomboyish i guess 

351.08 351.97 B: down to earth 

351.68 358.55 A: yeah you know and and see i'm that way now but i've always been that way i don't ever foresee me you know 

358.11 359.57 B: right 

358.70 359.98 A: you know 

360.11 361.21 A: being any any 

360.19 360.61 B: well

385.52 387.03 B: you know i just don't like

393.62 395.26 B: and some others that i've known
